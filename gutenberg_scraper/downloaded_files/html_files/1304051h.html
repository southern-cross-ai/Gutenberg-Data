<p>Bellarion the Fortunate, self-styled adopted son of Facino Cane,
Governor of Milan, was to need every favour that Fortune could
bestow when he found himself caught up in the web of intrigue and
ambition that characterized the ducal courts of Italy in the 15th
century.</p>
<p>Leaving the sheltered cloisters of a monastery, an orphan
without title or fortune, Bellarion became the unwitting tool of
the ruthless Marquis Theodore, Regent of Montferrat. Barely
escaping with his life by claiming noble parentage, Bellarion fled
to Milan, thereby forfeiting the trust and regard of the beautiful
Princess Valeria, who had looked to him to champion the cause of
her brother, the rightful ruler of Montferrat. But in Milan,
falling victim of its vicious and imbecilic young Duke, Bellarion
found himself thrown upon the mercy of the very nobleman whose name
he had adopted in an hour of desperate need.</p>
<p>How Bellarion, despite his cloistered upbringing, grasped the
sword which Fortune held out to him, and with it carved for himself
power and wealth beyond his wildest dreams, makes exciting reading,
and we share the moments of high drama in an age when a whispered
word could mean life or death, and humanity and honour were
sacrificed with barbarous cruelty to the schemings of ambitious
men.</p>
<hr>
<h2>BOOK I</h2>
<h2><a name="ch-1-01" id="ch-1-01"></a>CHAPTER I. THE
THRESHOLD</h2>
<p>"Half-god, half-beast," the Princess Valeria once described him,
without suspecting that the phrase describes not merely Bellarion,
but Man.</p>
<p>Aware of this, the anonymous chronicler who has preserved it for
us goes on to comment that the Princess said at once too much and
too little. He makes phrases in his turn&mdash;which I will spare
you&mdash;and seeks to prove that if the moieties of divinity and
beastliness are equally balanced in a man, that man will be neither
good nor bad. Then he passes on to show us a certain poor swineherd
who rose to ultimate eminence in whom the godly part so far
predominated that naught else was humanly discernible, and a great
prince&mdash;of whom more will be heard in the course of this
narrative&mdash;who was just as the beasts that perish, without any
spark of divinity to exalt him. These are the extremes. For each of
the dozen, or so, intermediate stages which he discerns our
chronicler has a portrait out of history, of which his learning
appears to be considerable.</p>
<p>From this, from his general manner, from the fact that most of
his illustrations are supplied by Florentine sources, and from the
austerely elegant Tuscan language in which he writes, a fairly
definite conclusion is possible on the score of his identity. It is
more than probable that this study of Bellarion the Fortunate
(Bellarione Fortunato) belongs to that series of historical
portraits from the pen of Niccolo Macchiavelli, of which The Life
of Castruccio Castracane is, perhaps, the most widely known.
Research, however, fails to discover the source from which he
draws. Whilst many of his facts agree completely with those
contained in the voluminous monkish Vita et Gesta Bellarionis, left
us by Fra Serafino of Imola, whoever he may have been, yet
discrepancies are frequent and irreconcilable.</p>
<p>Thus, at the very outset, on the score of his name, Macchiavelli
(to cling to my assumption) tells us that he was called Bellarion
not merely because he was a man of war, but because he was the very
child of War, born, as it were, out of the very womb of
conflict&mdash;"edi guerra propriamente partorito". The use of this
metaphor reveals a full acquaintance with the tale of the child's
being plucked from the midst of strife and alarums. But Fra
Serafino's account of the name is the only one that fits into the
known facts. That this name should have been so descriptive of
Bellarion's afterlife merely provides one of those curious
instances of homonymy in which history abounds.</p>
<p>Continuing his comments upon the Princess Valeria's phrase,
Macchiavelli states that Bellarion's is not a nature thus to be
packed into a sentence. Because of his perception of this fact, he
wrote his biographical sketch. Because of my perception of it, I
have embarked upon this fuller narrative.</p>
<p>I choose to begin at a point where Bellarion himself may be said
to make a certain beginning. I select the moment when he is to be
seen standing upon the threshold of the secular world, known to him
until that moment only from the writings of other men, yet better
known to him thus than it is to many who have lived a lifetime
among their fellows. After all, to view a scene from a distance is
to enjoy advantages of perspective denied to the actors in that
scene.</p>
<p>Bellarion's reading had been prodigious. There was no branch of
learning&mdash;from the Theological Fathers to Vegetius Hyginus on the
Art of War&mdash;to which he had not addressed his eager spirit. And his
exhaustion of all immediately available material for study was one
of the causes of his going forth from the peace of the convent of
which he was a nursling in quest of deeper wells of learning to
slake his hot intellectual thirst. Another cause was a certain
heretical doctrine of which it was hoped that further study would
cure him; a doctrine so subversive of theological teaching that a
hundred years later it must have made him closely acquainted with
the operations of the Holy Office and probably&mdash;in Spain
certainly&mdash;have brought him to the fire. This abominable heresy,
fruit of much brooding, was that in the world there is not, nor can
be, such a thing as sin. And it was in vain that the abbot, who
loved him very dearly, sought by argument to convert him.</p>
<p>"It is your innocence that speaks. Alas, my child, in the world,
from which hitherto you have been mercifully sheltered, you will
find that sin is not only real, but terribly abundant."</p>
<p>Bellarion answered with a syllogism, the logical formula to
which he had reduced his doctrine. He presented it in the Socratic
manner of inquiry, which was the method of argument he ever
preferred.</p>
<p>"Are not all things in the world from God? Is not God the fount
of all goodness? Can, therefore, any created thing be other than
good?"</p>
<p>"And the devil, then?" quoth the abbot.</p>
<p>Bellarion smiled, a singularly sweet smile that had power to
draw men's love and lead them into agreement with him.</p>
<p>"Is it not possible that those who invented the devil may have
studied divinity in Persia, where the creed obtains that powers of
light and darkness, Ormuzd and Ahriman, strive perpetually for
mastery of the world? Surely, otherwise, they would have remembered
that if the devil exists God must have created him, which in itself
is blasphemy, for God can create no evil."</p>
<p>Aghast, the abbot descended at a stride from the theological to
the practical.</p>
<p>"Is it not evil to steal, to kill, to commit adultery?"</p>
<p>"Ah yes. But these are evils between men, disruptive of society,
and therefore to be suppressed lest the gregariousness which men
desire should become impossible. But that is all."</p>
<p>"All? All!" The abbot's deep-set eyes surveyed the youth with
sorrow. "My son, the devil lends you a false subtlety to destroy
your soul."</p>
<p>And gently now that benign and fatherly man preached him a
sermon of the faith. It was followed by others in the days that
ensued. But to all the weapons of his saintly rhetoric Bellarion
continued to oppose the impenetrable shield of that syllogism of
his which the abbot knew at heart to be fallacious, yet whose
fallacy he laboured in vain to expose. When at last the good man
began to fear lest this heresy should come to trouble and corrupt
the peace and faith in his convent, he consented to speed its
author to Pavia and to those further studies which he hoped would
cure him of this heretical pravity. And that is how, on a day of
August of the year of grace 1407, Bellarion departed from the
Convent of our Lady of Grace of Cigliano.</p>
<p>He went on foot. He was to be dependent for food and shelter
mainly upon the charity of the religious houses that lay on his way
to Pavia, and as a passport to these he bore in his scrip a letter
from the Abbot of the Grazie. Beside it lay a purse containing for
emergencies five ducats, a princely sum, not only in his own eyes,
but in those of the abbot, who at parting had bestowed it upon him.
The tale of his worldly possessions is completed by the suit of
coarse green cloth he wore, and the knife at his girdle, which was
to serve all purposes from the carving of his meat to affording him
a means of defence from predatory beasts and men. To fortify him
spiritually in his adventurous pilgrimage through Lombardy he had
the abbot's blessing and a memory of the fond tears in the eyes of
that old man who loved him and who had reared him from the age of
six. At the last the abbot had again reminded him of the peace of
the convent and of the strife and unhappiness that distract the
world.</p>
<p>"Pax multa in cella, foris autem plurima bella."</p>
<p>The mischief began&mdash;and you may account it symbolical&mdash;by his
losing his way. This happened a mile or two beyond the township of
Livorno. Because the peace of the riverside allured a mind that for
seventeen years had been schooled in peace, because the emerald
meadows promised to be soft and yielding to his feet, he left the
dusty highway for the grassy banks of Po. Beside its broad waters
winding here about the shallow pleasant hills of Montferrat,
Bellarion trudged, staff in hand, the green hood of his cape thrown
back, the long liripipe trailing like a tail behind him, a tall,
lithe stripling of obvious vigour, olive-skinned, black-haired and
with dark eyes that surveyed the world bold and fearlessly.</p>
<p>The day was hot. The air was laden with the heavy perfumes of
late summer, and the river swollen and clouded by the melting snows
on distant Monte Rosa.</p>
<p>He wandered on, lost in day-dreams, until the sunlight passed
with the sinking of the sun behind the heights across the river,
and a breeze came whispering through the trees on his own bank. He
checked, his dark eyes alert, a frown of thought rumpling the fair
smoothness of his lofty brow. He looked about, became aware of a
deep forest on his left, bethought him of the road, remembered
where the sun had set, and realized hence that for some time he had
been travelling south, and consequently in the wrong direction. In
following the allurements offered to his senses he had gone astray.
He made some homely philosophy upon that, to his infinite
satisfaction, for he loved parallels and antitheses and all such
intellectual toys. For the rest, there was about him no doubt or
hesitation. He computed from the time he had taken and the pace at
which he had come the extent to which he had wandered from the
road. It must run too far beyond this forest to leave him any hope
of lying that night, as he had intended, with the Augustinian
fathers at their house on the Sesia, on the frontiers of the State
of Milan.</p>
<p>Save for the hunger that beset him, he was undismayed. And what,
after all, is a little hunger to one schooled to the most rigid
lenten feasts in season?</p>
<p>He entered the wood and resolutely went forward in the direction
in which he knew the road to lie. For a half-mile or more he
penetrated by a path growing less visible at every step, until
darkness and the forest swallowed him. To go on would certainly be
to lose himself completely in this maze. Better far to lie down and
sleep where he was and wait for the morning sun to give him his
orientation.</p>
<p>So he spread his cloak upon the ground, and, this proving no
harder as a couch than the pallet to which he was accustomed, he
slept soundly and peacefully.</p>
<p>When he awakened he found the sunlight in the forest and
something else of almost more immediate interest: a man in the grey
habit of a minor friar. This man, tall and lean, was standing
beside him, yet half-turned from him in a curious attitude of
arrested movement, almost as if the abrupt suddenness with which
Bellarion had sat up&mdash;a single heartbeat after his eyes had
opened&mdash;had checked his intention to depart.</p>
<p>Thus an instant, then the friar was facing him again, his hands
folded within the loose sleeves of his robe, a smile distending his
countenance. He uttered a benedictory greeting.</p>
<p>"Pax tecum."</p>
<p>"Et tecum, frater, pax," was Bellarion's mechanical answer, what
time he studied this stranger's villainous, patibulary countenance,
marking the animal looseness of the mouth and the craft peering
from the little eyes that were like black beads thrust into a face
of clay. A closer scrutiny softened his judgment. The man's face
was disfigured; ridged, scarred and pitted from the smallpox. Those
scars had contracted the skin about the eyes, thus altering the
expression, and to the ravages of the disease was also due the
sickly pallor overspreading cheek and brow.</p>
<p>Considering this and the habit which he wore&mdash;a habit which
Bellarion had no cause to associate with anything that was not
sweet and good&mdash;he disposed himself to make amends for the
hastiness of his first assumptions.</p>
<p>"Benedictus sis," he murmured, and with that abandoned Latin for
the vulgar tongue. "I bless the Providence that sends you to a poor
traveller who has lost his way."</p>
<p>The friar laughed aloud at this, and the lingering apprehension
left his eyes, which, thus relieved, grew pleasanter to look
upon.</p>
<p>"Lord! Lord! And I, like a fool and coward, having almost
trodden upon you, was for creeping off in haste, supposing you a
sleeping robber. This forest is a very sanctuary of thieves. They
infest it, thick as rabbits in a warren."</p>
<p>"Why, then, do you adventure in it?"</p>
<p>"Why? One! And what shall they steal from a poor
friar-mendicant? My beads? My girdle?" He laughed again. A humorous
fellow, clearly, taking a proper saintly joy in his indigenous
condition. "No, no, my brother. I have no cause to go in fear of
thieves."</p>
<p>"Yet supposing me a thief, you were in fear of me?"</p>
<p>The man's smile froze. This stripling's simple look was
disconcerting.</p>
<p>"I feared," he said at last, slowly and solemnly, "your fear of
me. A hideous passion, fear, in man or beast. It makes men
murderers at times. Had you been the robber I supposed you, and,
waking suddenly, found me beside you, you might have suspected some
intent to harm you. It is easily guessed what would have followed
then."</p>
<p>Bellarion nodded thoughtfully. No explanation could have been
more complete. The man was not only virtuous, but wise. "Whither to
do you journey, brother?"</p>
<p>"To Pavia," Bellarion answered him, "by the way of Santa
Tenda."</p>
<p>"Santa Tenda! Why, that is my way, too; at least, as far as the
Augustinian Monastery of the Sesia. Wait here, my son, and we will
go together. It is good to have a comrade on a journey. Wait but
sortie few moments, to give me time to bathe, which is the purpose
for which I came. I will not keep you long."</p>
<p>He went striding off through the grass. Bellarion called after
him: "Where do you bathe?"</p>
<p>Over his shoulder the friar answered him: "There is a rivulet
down yonder. But a little way. Do not stray from that spot, so that
I may find you again, my son."</p>
<p>Bellarion thought the form of address an odd one. A minorite is
brother, not father, to all humanity. But it was no suspicion based
on this that brought him to his feet. He was a youth of cleanly
habits, and if there was water at hand he, too, would profit by it.
So he rose, picked up his cloak, and went off in the wake of the
swiftly-moving friar.</p>
<p>When presently he overtook him, Bellarion made him a present of
a proverb:</p>
<p>"Who goes slowly, goes soundly."</p>
<p>"But never gets there," was the slightly breathless answer. "And
it's still some way to the water."</p>
<p>"Some way? But you said..."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay, I was mistaken. One place is like another in this
labyrinth. I am none so sure that I am not as lost as you are."</p>
<p>It must have been so, for they trudged a full mile before they
came to a brook that flowed westwards towards the river. It lay in
a dell amid mossy boulders and spreading fronds of ferns all
dappled now with the golden light that came splashing through the
trees. They found a pool of moderate dimensions in a bowl of grey
stone fashioned by the ceaseless sculpture of the water. It was too
shallow to afford a bath. But the friar's ablutionary dispositions
scarce seemed to demand so much. He rinsed his face and hands
perfunctorily, whilst Bellarion stripped to the waist, and
displaying a white torso of much beauty and more vigour, did what
was possible in that cramped space.</p>
<p>After that the friar produced from one of the sack-like pockets
of his habit an enormous piece of sausage and a loaf of rye
bread.</p>
<p>To Bellarion, who had gone supperless to bed, this was as the
sight of manna in the desert.</p>
<p>"Little brother!" he cooed in sheer delight. "Little
brother!"</p>
<p>"Ay, ay. We have our uses, we little brothers of Saint Francis."
The minorite sliced the sausage in two equal halves. "We know how
to provide ourselves upon a journey."</p>
<p>They fell to eating, and with the stilling of his hunger
Bellarion experienced an increasing kindliness to this Good
Samaritan. At the friar's suggestion that they should be moving so
as to cover the greater part of the road to Casale before the
noontide heat, Bellarion stood up, brushing the crumbs from his
lap. In doing so his hand came in contact with the scrip that
dangled from his girdle.</p>
<p>"Saints of God," he ejaculated, as he tightened his clutch upon
that bag of green cloth.</p>
<p>The beady eyes of the minorite were upon him and there was blank
inquiry in that ashen corrugated face.</p>
<p>"What is it, brother?"</p>
<p>Bellarion's fingers groped within the bag a moment, then turned
it inside out, to reveal its utter emptiness. He showed his
companion a face which blended suspicion with dismay.</p>
<p>"I have been robbed," he said.</p>
<p>"Robbed?" the other echoed, then smiled a pitying concern. "My
surprise is less than yours, my son. Did I not say these woods are
infested by thieves? Had you slept less soundly you might have been
robbed of life as well. Render thanks to God, Whose grace is
discernible even in misfortune. For no evil befalls us that will
not serve to show how much greater that evil might have been. Take
that for comfort ever in adversity, my child."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay!" Bellarion displayed ill-humour whilst his eyes abated
nothing of their suspicious glance. "It is easy to make philosophy
upon the woes of others."</p>
<p>"Child, child! What is your woe? What is the full sum of it?
What have you lost when all is said?"</p>
<p>"Five ducats and a letter." Bellarion flung the answer
fiercely.</p>
<p>"Five ducats!" The friar spread his hands in pious remonstrance.
"And will you blaspheme God for five ducats?"</p>
<p>"Blaspheme?"</p>
<p>"Is not your furious frame of mind a blasphemy, your anger at
your loss where there should be a devout thankfulness for all that
you retain? And you should be thankful, too, for the Providence
that guided my steps towards you in the hour of your need."</p>
<p>"I should be thankful for that?" Bellarion stressed the question
with mistrust.</p>
<p>The friar's countenance changed. A gentle melancholy invested
it.</p>
<p>"I read your thoughts, child, and they harbour suspicion of me.
Of me!" he smiled. "Why, what a madness! Should I turn thief?
Should I imperil my immortal soul for five paltry ducats? Do you
not know that we little brothers of Saint Francis live as the birds
of the air, without thought for material things, our trust entirely
in God's providence? What should I do with five ducats, or five
hundred? Without a single minted coin, with no more than my gown
and my staff, I might journey from here to Jerusalem, living upon
the alms that never fail us. But assurances are not enough for
minds poisoned by suspicion." He flung wide his arms and stood
cruciform before the youth. "Come, child, make search upon me for
your ducats, and so assure yourself. Come!"</p>
<p>Bellarion flushed and lowered his head in shame.</p>
<p>"There...there is not the need," he answered lamely. "The gown
you wear is a full assurance. You could not be what you are and yet
the thing that for a moment I..." He broke off. "I beg that you'll
forgive my unworthiness, my brother."</p>
<p>Slowly the friar lowered his arms. His eyes were smiling
again.</p>
<p>"I will be merciful by not insisting." He laid a hand, lean and
long in the fingers as an eagle's claw, upon the young man's
shoulder. "Think no more of your loss. I am here to repair it.
Together we will journey. The habit of Saint Francis is wide enough
to cover both of us, and you shall not want for anything until you
reach Pavia."</p>
<p>Bellarion looked at him in gratitude. "It was Providence,
indeed, that sent you."</p>
<p>"Did I not say so? And now you see it for yourself. Benedicamus
Domine."</p>
<p>To which Bellarion sincerely made the prescribed answer: "Deo
gratias!"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-02" id="ch-1-02"></a>CHAPTER II. THE GREY
FRIAR</h2>
<p>They made their way towards the road, not directly, but by a
course with which Fra Sulpizio&mdash;as the friar announced himself
named&mdash;seemed singularly well acquainted. It led transversely
across the forest. And as they went Fra Sulpizio plied Bellarion
with questions.</p>
<p>"There was a letter, you said, that was stolen with your
gold?"</p>
<p>"Ay," Bellarion's tone was bitter. "A letter worth many times
five ducats."</p>
<p>"Worth many times...? A letter?" The incredulity on the friar's
face was ludicrous. "Why, what manner of letter was that?"</p>
<p>Bellarion, who knew the contents by heart, recited them word for
word.</p>
<p>Fra Sulpizio scratched his head in perplexity. "I have Latin
enough for my office; but not for this," he confessed, and finding
Bellarion's searching glance upon him, he softened his voice to
add, truly enough: "We little brothers of Saint Francis are not
famed for learning. Learning disturbs humility."</p>
<p>Bellarion sighed. "So I know to my cost," said he, and
thereafter translated the lost letter: "This is our dearly beloved
son Bellarion, a nutritus of this house, who goes hence to Pavia to
increase his knowledge of the humanities. We commend him first to
God and then to the houses of our own and other brethren orders for
shelter and assistance on his journey, invoking upon all who may
befriend him the blessing of Our Lord."</p>
<p>The friar nodded his understanding. "It might have been a
grievous loss, indeed. But as it is, I will do the office of your
letter whilst I am with you, and when we part I will see you armed
with the like from the Prior of the Augustinians on the Sesia. He
will do this at my word."</p>
<p>The young man thanked him with a fervour dictated by shame of
certain unworthy suspicions which had recurred. Thereafter they
trudged on awhile in silence, broken by the friar at last.</p>
<p>"And is your name Belisario, then? An odd name that!"</p>
<p>"Not Belisario. Beliario or, rather, Bellarione."</p>
<p>"Bellarione? Why, it is even less Christian than the other.
Where got you such a name?"</p>
<p>"Not at the font, you may be sure. There I was christened
Ilario, after the good Saint Hilary, who is still my patron
saint."</p>
<p>"Then why...?"</p>
<p>"There's a story to it; my story," Bellarion answered him, and
upon slight encouragement proceeded to relate it.</p>
<p>He was born, he told the friar, as nearly as he could guess,
some six years after the outbreak of the Great Schism; that is to
say, somewhere about the year 1384, in a village of whose name,
like that of his own family, he had no knowledge.</p>
<p>"Of my father and my mother," he continued, "I can evoke no
mental picture. Of my father my only positive knowledge is that he
existed. Of my mother I know that she was a termagant of whom the
family, my father included, stood in awe. Amongst my earliest
impressions is the sense of fear that invaded us at the sound of
her scolding voice. It was querulous and strident; and I can hear
it to this day harshly raised to call my sister. Leocadia was that
sister's name, the only name of all my family that I remember, and
this because I must have often heard it called in that dread voice.
There were several of us. I have one vivid memory of perhaps a
half-dozen tumbling urchins playing at some game in a bare, chill
room that was yellow washed, lighted by an unglazed window beyond
which the rain was streaming down upon a narrow dismal street.
There was a clang of metal in the air, as if armourers were at work
in the neighbourhood. And we were in the charge, I remember, of
that same Leocadia, who must have been the eldest of us. I have an
impression, vague and misty, of a lanky girl whose lean, bare legs
showed through a rent in her tattered petticoat. Faintly I discern
a thin pinched face set in a mane of untidy yellow hair, and then I
hear a heavy step and the creak of a stair and a shrill discordant
voice calling, 'Leocadia!' and then a scuttle amongst us to shelter
from some unremembered peril.</p>
<p>"Of my family, that is all that I can tell you, brother. You'll
agree, perhaps, that since my memory can hold so little it is a
pity that it should hold so much. But for these slight impressions
of my infancy, I might weave a pleasant romance about it, conceive
myself born in a palace and heir to an illustrious name.</p>
<p>"That these memories of mine concern the year 1389 or 1390, I
know from what the abbot tells me, and also from later studies and
deductions of my own. As you may know, there was at that time a
bitter war being waged hereabouts between Ghibelline Montferrat and
Guelphic Morea. It may have ravaged these very lands by which we
travel now. One evening at the hour of dusk a foraging troop of
Montferrat horse swept into my native place. There was pillage and
brutality of every kind, as you can imagine. There was terror and
confusion in every household, no doubt, and even in our own,
although, heaven knows, we had little cause to stand in dread of
pillage. I remember that as night descended we huddled in the dark
listening to the sounds of violence in the distance, coming from
what I now imagine to have been the more opulent quarter of that
township. I can hear my mother's heavy breathing. For once she
inspired no terror in us, being herself stricken with terror and
cowed into silence. But this great terror was upon us all, a sense
of impending evil, of some horror advancing presently to overwhelm
us. There were snivelling whimpering sounds in the gloom about me
from Leocadia and the other children. It is odd how things heard
have remained stamped upon my mind so much more vividly than things
seen, which usually are more easily remembered. But from that
moment my memory begins to grow clear and consecutive, perhaps from
the sudden sharpening of my wits by this crisis.</p>
<p>"It was probably the instinct to withdraw myself beyond the
reach of that approaching evil which drew me furtively from the
room. I remember groping my way in the dark down a steep crazy
staircase and tumbling down three stone steps at the door of that
hovel into the mud of the street.</p>
<p>"I picked myself up, bruised and covered with filth. At another
time this might have set me howling. Just then my mind was filled
with graver concerns. In the open the noises were more distinct. I
could hear shouts, and once a piercing scream that made my young
blood run cold. Away on my right there was a red glow in the sky,
and, associating it with the evil that was to be escaped, I turned
down the alley and made off, whimpering as I ran. Soon there was an
end to the houses, and I was out of their shadow in the light of a
rising moon on a road that led away through the open country into
eternity, as it must have seemed to me. From this I have since
argued either that the township had neither gates nor walls, or
else that the mean quarter we inhabited was outside and beyond
them.</p>
<p>"I cannot have been above five years of age, and I must have
been singularly sturdy, for my little legs bore me several miles
that night, driven by unreasoning fear. At last I must have sunk
down exhausted by the roadside and there fallen asleep, for my next
memory is of my awakening. It was broad daylight, and I was in the
grasp of a big bearded man who, from his cap to his spurs, was all
steel and leather. Beside him stood the great bay horse from which
he had just leaped, and behind him, filling the road in a staring,
grinning cluster, was ranged a troop of fully fifty men with lances
reared above them.</p>
<p>"He soothed my terrors with a voice incredibly gentle in one so
big and fierce, and asked me who I was and whence I came, questions
to which I could return no proper answers. To increase my
confidence, perhaps, he gave me food&mdash;some fruit and bread&mdash;such
bread as I had never tasted.</p>
<p>"'We cannot leave you here, baby', he said. 'And since you don't
know where you belong I will take charge of you.'</p>
<p>"I no longer feared him or those with him. What cause had I to
fear them? This man had stroked and petted and fed me. He had used
me more kindly than I could remember ever to have been used before.
So when, presently, I was perched in front of him on the withers of
his great horse, I knew no sense but one of entire
satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Later that day we came to a town, whose inhabitants regarded us
in cringing awe. But perhaps, because its numbers were small, the
troop bore itself with circumspection, careful to give no
provocation.</p>
<p>"The man-at-arms who had befriended me kept me in his train for
a month or more. Then the exigencies of the campaign against Morea
demanding it, he placed me with the Augustinian fathers at the
Grazie near Cigliano. They cared for me as if I had been a prince's
child instead of a stray waif picked up by the roadside. Thereafter
at intervals he would come to visit me, and these visits, although
the intervals between them grew ever longer, continued for some
three or four years, after which we never saw or heard of him
again. Either he died or else lost interest in the child he had
saved and protected. Thereafter the Augustinians were my only
friends. They reared me and educated me, hoping that I would one
day enter the order. They made endeavours to trace my birthplace
and my family, but without success. And that," he ended, "is all my
story."</p>
<p>"Ah, not quite all," the friar reminded him. "There is this
matter of your name."</p>
<p>"Ah yes. On the first day when I rode with my man-at-arms we
went to a tavern in the town I mentioned, and there he delivered me
into the hands of the taverner's wife, to wash and clothe me. It
was an odd fancy in such a man, as I now realize; but I am
persuaded that whilst he rode that morning with my little body in
the crook of his great arm he conceived the notion to adopt me for
his own. Men are like that, their natures made up of contradictory
elements; and a rough, even brutal, soldier of fortune, not
normally pitiful, may freakishly be moved to pity by the sight and
touch of a poor waif astray by the roadside." And on that he fell
to musing.</p>
<p>"But the name?" the friar reminded him again.</p>
<p>He laughed. "Why, when the taverner's wife set me before him,
scoured clean and dressed in a comely suit of green cloth, not
unlike the suit I am wearing now&mdash;for I have affected green ever
since in memory of him and of the first fine raiment I ever wore,
which was of his providing&mdash;it may be that I presented a comely
appearance. He stared at me in sheer surprise. I can see him now,
seated on a three-legged stool in a patch of sunlight that came
through the blurred glass of the window, one hand on the knee of
his booted leg, the other stroking his crisp black beard, his grey
eyes conning me with an increasing kindliness.</p>
<p>"'Come hither, boy', he bade me, and held out his hand.</p>
<p>"I went without fear or hesitation. He rested me against his
knee, and set a hand upon my head, still tingling from its recent
combing.</p>
<p>"'What did you tell me is your name?' he asked.</p>
<p>"'Ilario', I answered him.</p>
<p>"He stared a moment. Then a smile, half scornful, broke upon his
rugged weather-beaten face. 'Ilario, thou? With that solemn
countenance and those big melancholy eyes?' He ran on in words
which I remember, though I barely caught their meaning then. 'Was
there ever an Ilario less hilarious? There's no hilarity about you,
child, nor ever has been, I should judge. Ilario! Faugh! Bellario,
rather, with such a face. Is he not a lovely lad?' He turned me
about for the approval of the taverner's wife, who stood beside me,
and she, poor woman, made haste to agree with fawning smiles, as
she would have agreed with anything uttered by this dread man who
must be conciliated. 'Bellario!' he repeated, savouring the word of
his invention with an inventor's pride. 'That were a better name
for him, indeed. And by the host, Bellario, he shall be renamed. Do
you hear me, boy? Henceforth you are Bellario'."</p>
<p>Thus, he explained, the name so lightly bestowed became his own;
and later, because of his rapid and rather excessive growth, the
monks at the Grazie fell into the habit of calling him Bellarione,
or big Bellario.</p>
<p>It still wanted an hour or so to noon when the twain emerged
from the forest on to the open road. A little way along this they
came upon a homestead set amid rice fields, now denuded, and
vineyards where men and women were at the labours of the vintage,
singing as they harvested the grape. And here Bellarion had an
instance of how the little brothers of St. Francis receive alms
without being so much as put to the trouble of asking for them. For
at sight of the friar's grey frock, one of the labourers, who
presently announced himself the master of the homestead, came
hurrying to bid them stay and rest and join the household at
dinner, of which the hour was at hand.</p>
<p>They sat down to rough abundant fare in the roomy kitchen amid
the members of that considerable family, sharing with them the
benches set against a trestle table of well-scoured deal.</p>
<p>There was a cereal porridge, spread, like mortar, upon a board,
into which each dipped a wooden spoon, and after this came strips
of roast kid, with boiled figs and bread moist and solid as cheese.
To wash all down there was a rough red wine, sharp on the palate
but wholesome and cool from the cellar, of which the friar drank
over copiously.</p>
<p>They numbered a round dozen at table: the old peasant and his
wife, a nephew and seven children of full age, three of whom were
young women, red-lipped, dark-skinned, deep-bosomed wenches with
lusty brown arms and bright eyes which were over busy about
Bellarion for his ease.</p>
<p>Once, across the board, he caught the eye of the friar, and
about these and the fellow's loose lips there played a smile of sly
unpleasant amusement at Bellarion's uneasiness under these feminine
attentions. Later, when Fra Sulpizio's excessive consumption of
wine had brought a flush to the cheekbones of that pallid face and
set a glitter in the beady eyes, Bellarion caught him pondering the
girls with such a wolfish leer that all his first instincts against
the man were roused again, and not the thought of his office or the
contemplation of his habit could efface them.</p>
<p>After dinner the friar must rest awhile, and Bellarion beguiled
the time of waiting, which was also the time of siesta in which all
labour is suspended, by wandering in the vineyard whither the
peasant's daughters led him, and where they engaged him in chatter
that he found monstrous tedious and silly.</p>
<p>Yet, but for this and the fact that the vineyard bordered on the
road, Bellarion's association with the friar would have ended
there, and all his subsequent history must have been different
indeed. The minorite's siesta was shorter than might have been
expected, and when, something less than an hour later, he resumed
his journey, so confused was he by sleep and wine that he appeared
to have forgotten his companion quite. Had not Bellarion seen him
striding away along the road to Casale, it is certain the young man
would have been left behind.</p>
<p>Nor did he manifest much satisfaction when Bellarion came
running after him. The scowl on his face argued displeasure. But
his excuses and his explanations that he was but half-awake
permitted the assumption that it was himself with whom he was
displeased.</p>
<p>He moved briskly now, swinging his long legs in great strides,
and casting ever and anon a glance behind him.</p>
<p>Bellarion offered a remonstrance at the pace, a reminder that
Casale was but some two leagues away and they had the afternoon in
which to. reach it. He was answered churlishly:</p>
<p>"If I go too fast for you, you may follow at your leisure." It
was for an instant in Bellarion's mind to take him at his word,
then partly perversity, and partly a suspicion which he strove in
vain to stifle, overcame his natural pride.</p>
<p>"No, no, little brother. I'll accommodate my pace to yours, as
befits."</p>
<p>A grunt was the only answer; nor, indeed, although Bellarion
made several attempts to resume conversation, was there much said
between them thereafter as they trudged on in the heat of the
afternoon along the road that crosses the fertile plains from Trino
to Casale.</p>
<p>They did not, however, proceed very far on foot. For, being
presently overtaken by a string of six or seven mules with
capacious panniers slung on either flank, the leading beast
bestridden by the muleteer, Bellarion received another
demonstration of how a little brother of St. Francis may travel
upon charity. As the column advanced upon them at a brisk trot, Fra
Sulpizio stepped to the middle of the road, with arms held wide as
if to offer a barrier.</p>
<p>The muleteer, a brawny, black-bearded fellow, drew rein within a
yard of him.</p>
<p>"What now, little brother? How can I serve you?"</p>
<p>"The blessing of God upon you, brother! Will you earn it by a
little charity besought in the name of the Blessed Francis? If your
beasts are not overladen, will you suffer them to carry a poor
footsore Franciscan and this gentle lad into Casale?"</p>
<p>The muleteer swung one cross-gartered leg over to the side of
the other and slipped to the ground, that he might assist them to
mount, each on one of the more lightly laden mules. Thereupon,
having begged and received Fra Sulpizio's blessing, he climbed back
into his own saddle and they were off at a sharp trot.</p>
<p>To Bellarion the experience of a saddle, or of what did duty for
a saddle, was as novel as it was painful, and so kept his thoughts
most fully engaged. It was his first essay in equitation, and the
speed they made shook and tossed and bruised him until there was
not a bone or muscle in his body that did not ache. His humour,
too, was a little bruised by the hilarity which his efforts to
maintain his seat excited in his two companions.</p>
<p>Thankful was he when they came in sight of the brown walls of
Casale. These surged before them almost suddenly in the plain as
they took a bend of the road; for the city's level position was
such as to render it inconspicuous from afar. The road led straight
on to the San Stefano Gate, towards which they clattered over the
drawbridge spanning the wide moat. There was a guard-house in the
deep archway, and the door of this stood open, revealing some three
or four soldiers lounging within. But they kept a loose and
careless guard, for these were peaceful times. One of them, a young
man in a leather hacketon but bare of head, sauntered forward as
far as the doorway to fling a greeting at the muleteer, which was
taken by the fellow as permission to pass on.</p>
<p>From that gateway, cool and cavernous, they emerged into one of
the streets of the busy capital of the war-like State of
Montferrat, which at one time, none so far distant, had bidden fair
to assume the lordship of Northern Italy.</p>
<p>They proceeded slowly now, perforce. The crooked street, across
which the crazy houses seemed to lean towards each other so as to
exclude the sunlight from all but a narrow middle line, was
thronged with people of all degrees. It was ever a busy
thoroughfare, this street of San Stefano, leading from the gate of
that name to the Cathedral Square, and from his post of vantage on
the back of the now ambling mule, Bellarion, able at last to sit
unshaken, looked about him with deep interest upon manifestations
of life known to him hitherto through little more than the
imagination which had informed his extensive reading.</p>
<p>It was market-day in Casale, and before the shops the way was
blocked by trestle tables, on which the merchants displayed their
wares, shouting their virtues to lure the attention of the
wayfarers.</p>
<p>Through this they came, by low and narrow archways, to an even
greater bustle in the open space before the cathedral, founded, as
Bellarion knew, some seven hundred years before by Liutprand, King
of the Lombards. He turned to stare at the Roman architecture of
the red and white facade, flanked by slender square towers, each
surmounted by an hexagonal extinguisher roof. He was still
considering the cruciform windows, when the mule halted, and
recalled his attention.</p>
<p>Ahead of him Fra Sulpizio was slipping to the ground, bestowing
thanks and invoking the blessings of God upon the muleteer.
Bellarion dismounted, a little stiff from his ride, and very
thankful to be at the end of it. The muleteer flung them a "God
guard you" over his shoulder, and the string of mules passed
on.</p>
<p>"And now, brother, we'll seek a supper, if you please," the
friar announced.</p>
<p>To seek it was natural enough, but hardly, thought Bellarion, in
the tavern across the square, whither he was led.</p>
<p>On the threshold, under the withered bough that was hung as a
sign above the portal, the young man demurred, protesting that one
of the religious houses of the town were a fitter resort, and its
charitable shelter more suitable to a friar mendicant.</p>
<p>"Why, as to charity," quoth Fra Sulpizio, "it is on charity I
depend. Old Benvenuto here, the taverner, is my cousin. He will
make us free of his table, and give me news of my own folk at the
same time. Is it not natural and proper that I seek him?"</p>
<p>Reluctantly Bellarion was forced to agree. And he reminded
himself, to buttress a waning faith in his companion, that not once
had he voiced a suspicion of the friar's actions to which the
friar's answer had not been ready and complete.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-03" id="ch-1-03"></a>CHAPTER III. THE DOOR
AJAR</h2>
<p>The event which was to deviate Bellarion so abruptly and
brutally from the peaceful ways of a student and a scholar, and to
extinguish his cherished hopes of learning Greek at Pavia under the
far-famed Messer Chrysolaras, was upon him so suddenly and so
unheralded that he scarcely realized it until it was overpast.</p>
<p>He and the friar had supped in the unclean and crowded
common-room of the Hostelry of the Stag&mdash;so called, it is presumed,
in honour of the Lords of Montferrat, who had adopted the stag as
their device&mdash;and it is to be confessed that they had supped
abundantly and well under the particular auspices of Ser Benvenuto,
the host, who used his cousin Fra Sulpizio with almost more than
cousinly affection. He had placed them a little apart from the
noisy occupants of that low-ceilinged, grimy chamber, in a recess
under a tall, narrow window, standing open, so that the stench,
compounded of garlic, burnt meats, rancid oil and other things,
which pervaded the apartment, was here diluted for them by the pure
evening air. And he waited upon them himself, after a protracted
entertainment with the friar, conducted in a mutter of which
nothing reached Bellarion. He brought them of his best, of which
the most conspicuous item was a lean and stringy fowl, and he
produced for them from his cellar a flask of Valtelline which at
least was worthy of a better table.</p>
<p>Bellarion, tired and hungry, did justice to the viands, without
permitting himself more than a passing irritation at his
companion's whining expositions of the signal advantages of
travelling under the aegis of the Blessed Francis. The truth is
that he did not hear more than the half of all that Fra Sulpizio
found occasion to urge. For one thing, in his greed, the friar
spoke indistinctly, slobbering the while at his food; for another,
the many tenants of the inn were very noisy. They made up a motley
crowd, but had this in common that all belonged to the lower walks
of life, as their loud, coarse speech, freely interlarded with
blasphemy and obscenity, abundantly bore witness. There were some
peasants from Romaglia or Torcella, or perhaps from Terranova
beyond the Po, who had come there to market; rude, brawny men for
the most part, accompanied by their equally brawny barelegged
women. There were a few labourers of the town and others who may
have been artisans, one or two of them, indeed, so proclaimed by
their leather aprons; and at one table a group of four men and a
woman were very boisterous over their wine. The men were soldiers,
so to be judged at a glance from their leather hacketons and
studded girdles with heavy daggers slung behind. The woman with
them was a gaudy, sinuous creature with haggard, painted cheeks,
whose mirth, now shrill, now raucous, was too easily moved. When
first he heard it, Bellarion had shuddered.</p>
<p>"She laughs," he had told the friar, "as one might laugh in
hell."</p>
<p>For only answer Fra Sulpizio had looked at him and then veiled
his eyes, almost as if, himself, he were suppressing laughter.</p>
<p>Soon, however, Bellarion grew accustomed to the ever-recurring
sound and to the rest of the din, the rattle of platters and
drinking cans, the growling of a dog over a bone it had discovered
among the foul rushes rotting on the bare earthen floor.</p>
<p>Having eaten, he sat back in his chair, a little torpid now, and
drowsy. Last night he had lain in the open, and he had been afoot
almost since dawn. It is little wonder that presently, whilst again
the taverner was muttering with his cousin the friar, he should
have fallen into a doze.</p>
<p>He must have slept some little while&mdash;a half-hour perhaps&mdash;for
when he awakened the patch of sunlight had faded from the wall
across the alley, visible from the window under which they sat.
This he did not notice at the time, but remembered afterwards. In
the moment of awakening, his attention was drawn by the friar, who
had risen, and instantly afterwards by something else beyond the
friar. At the open window behind and above Fra Sulpizio there was
the face of a man. Upon the edge of the sill, beneath his face,
were visible the fingers by which he had hoisted himself thither.
The questing eyes met Bellarion's, and seemed to dilate a little;
the mouth gaped suddenly. But before Bellarion could cry out or
speak, or even form the intention of doing either, the face had
vanished. And it was the face of the peasant with whom they had
dined that day.</p>
<p>The friar, warned by Bellarion's quickening stare, had swung
round to look behind him. But he was too late; the window space was
already empty.</p>
<p>"What is it?" he asked, suddenly apprehensive. "What did you
see?"</p>
<p>Bellarion told him, and was answered by an obscenely
morphological oath, which left him staring. The friar's countenance
was suddenly transfigured. A spasm of mingled fear and anger bared
his fangs; his beady eyes grew cruel and sinister. He swung aside
as if to depart abruptly, then as abruptly halted where he
stood.</p>
<p>On the threshold surged the peasant, others following him.</p>
<p>The friar sank again to his stool at the table and composed his
features.</p>
<p>"Yonder he sits, that friar rogue. That thief!" Thus the peasant
as he advanced.</p>
<p>The cry, and, more than all, the sight of the peasant's
companions, imposed a sudden silence upon the babel of that room.
First came a young man, stalwart and upright, in steel cap and
gorget, booted and spurred, a sword swinging from his girdle, a
dagger hanging on his hip behind. A little crimson feather adorning
his steel cap proclaimed him an officer of the Captain of Justice
of Casale. After him came two of his men, armed with short
pikes.</p>
<p>Straight to that table in the window recess the peasant led the
way. "There he is. This is he." Belligerently he thrust his face
into the friar's, leaning his knuckles on the table's edge. "Now,
rogue..." he was beginning furiously, when Fra Sulpizio, raising
eyes of mild astonishment to meet his anger, gently interrupted
him.</p>
<p>"Little brother, do you speak so to me! Do you call me rogue?
Me?" He smiled sadly, and so calm and gently wistful was his manner
that it clearly gave the peasant pause. "A sinner I confess myself,
for sinners are we all. But I am conscious of no sin against you,
brother, whose charity was so freely given me only today."</p>
<p>That saintly demeanour threw the peasant's simple wits into
confusion. He was thrust aside by the officer.</p>
<p>"What is your name?"</p>
<p>Fra Sulpizio looked at him, and his look was laden with
reproach.</p>
<p>"My brother!" he cried.</p>
<p>"Attend to me," the officer barked at him. "This man charges you
with theft."</p>
<p>"With theft!" Fra Sulpizio paused and sighed. "It shall not move
me to the sin of anger, brother. It is too foolish: a thing for
laughter. What need have I to steal, when under the protection of
Saint Francis I have but to ask for the little that I need? What
use to me is worldly gear? But what does he say I stole?"</p>
<p>It was the peasant who answered him.</p>
<p>"Thirty florins, a gold chain, and a silver cross from a chest
in the room where you rested."</p>
<p>Bellarion remembered how the friar had sought to go slinking off
alone from the peasant homestead and how fearfully he had looked
behind him as they trudged along the road until overtaken by the
muleteer. And by the muleteer it would be, he thought, that they
had now been tracked. The officer at the gate would have told the
peasant of how the friar and his young companion in green had
ridden in; then the peasant would have sought the muleteer, and the
rest was clear. As clear as it was to him that his companion was a
thieving rogue and that his own five ducats were somewhere about
that scoundrel's person.</p>
<p>In future, he swore, he would be guided by his own keen
instincts and the evidence of his senses only, and never again
allow a preconception to befool him. Meanwhile, the friar was
answering:</p>
<p>"So that not only am I charged with stealing; but I have
returned evil for good; I have abused charity. It is a heavy
charge, my brother, and very rashly brought."</p>
<p>There was a murmur of sympathy from the staring, listening
company, amongst whom many lawless ones were, by the very instinct
of their kind, ready to range themselves against any who stood for
law.</p>
<p>The friar opened his arms wide and invitingly.</p>
<p>"Let me not depart from my vows of humility in the heat of my
own defence. I will say nothing. Do you, sir, make search upon me
for the gear which this man says I have stolen, though all his
evidence is that it chanced to be in a room in which for a little
while I rested."</p>
<p>"To accuse a priest!" said someone in a tone of indignation, and
a murmur arose at once in sympathy.</p>
<p>It moved the young officer to mirth. He half-swung on his heel
so as to confront those mutterers.</p>
<p>"A priest!" he jeered. Then his keen eyes flashed once more upon
the friar. "When did you last say Mass?"</p>
<p>Before that simple question Fra Sulpizio seemed to lose some of
his assurance. Without even giving him time to answer, the officer
fired another question: "What is your name?"</p>
<p>"My name?" The friar was looking at him from eyes that seemed to
have grown beadier than ever in that white pitted face. "I'll not
expose myself to ribald mischief. You shall have written proof of
my name. Behold." And from his gown he fetched a parchment, which
he thrust under the soldier's nose.</p>
<p>The officer conned it a moment, then his eyes went over the edge
of it back to the face of the man that held it.</p>
<p>"How can I read it upside down?"</p>
<p>The friar's hands, which shook a little, made haste to turn the
sheet. As he did so Bellarion perceived two things: that the sheet
had been correctly held at first, and that it was his own lost
letter. He had a glimpse of the abbot's seal as the parchment was
turned.</p>
<p>He was momentarily bewildered by a discovery that was really
threefold: First, the friar was indeed the thief who had rifled his
scrip; second, he must be in a more desperate case than Bellarion
suspected to seek to cloak himself under a false identity; and
third, the pretence that the document was proffered upside down was
a test to discover whether the fellow could read, a trap into which
the knave had tumbled headlong.</p>
<p>The officer laughed aloud, well pleased with his own cleverness.
"I knew you were no clerk," he mocked him. "I have more than a
suspicion who you really are. Though you may have stolen a friar's
habit, it would need more than that to cover your ugly pock-marked
face and that scar on your neck. You are Lorenzaccio da Trino, my
friend; and there's a halter waiting for you."</p>
<p>The mention of that name made a stir in the tavern and brought
its tenants a step nearer to the group about that table in the
window recess. It was a name known probably to every man present,
with the single exception of Bellarion, the name of a bandit of
evil fame throughout Montferrat and Savoy. Something of the kind
Bellarion may have guessed. But at that moment the recovery of the
abbot's letter was his chief concern.</p>
<p>"That parchment's mine," he cried. "It was stolen from me this
morning by this false friar."</p>
<p>The interpolation diverted attention to himself. After a
moment's blank stare the officer laughed again. Bellarion began
actively to dislike that laugh of his. He was too readily moved to
it.</p>
<p>"Why, here's Paul disowning Peter. Oh, to be sure, the associate
becomes the victim when the master rogue is taken. It's a stale
trick, my young cockerel. It won't serve in Casale."</p>
<p>Bellarion bristled. He assumed a great dignity. "Young sir, you
may come to regret your words. I am the man named in that
parchment, as the Abbot of the Grazie of Cigliano can testify."</p>
<p>"No need to plague Messer the Abbot," the officer mocked him. "A
taste of the cord, my lad, a hoist or two, and you'll vomit all the
truth."</p>
<p>"The hoist!" Bellarion felt the skin roughening along his
spine.</p>
<p>Was it to be taken for granted that he was a rogue simply from
his association with this spurious friar, and were his bones to be
broken by the torturers to make him accuse himself? Was this how
justice was dispensed?</p>
<p>He was bewildered, and, as he afterwards confessed, he grew
suddenly afraid. And then there was a cry from the peasant, and
things happened quickly and unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Whilst the officer's attention had been on Bellarion, the false
friar had moved very softly and stealthily nearer to the window.
The peasant it was who detected the movement and realized its
import.</p>
<p>"Lay hands on him!" he cried, in sudden alarm lest his florins
and the rest should take flight again, and, that alarm spurring
him, himself he leapt to seize Lorenzaccio by arm and shoulder.
Fury blazed from the bandit's beady eyes; his yellow fangs were
bared in a grin of rage; something flashed in his right hand, and
then his knife sank into the stomach of his assailant. It was a
wicked, vicious, upward, ripping thrust, like the stroke of a
boar's tusk, and the very movement that delivered it flung the
peasant off so that he hurtled into the arms of the two soldiers
and momentarily hampered their advance. That moment was all that
Lorenzaccio needed. He swung aside, and with a vigour and agility
to execute, as remarkable as the rapidity of the conception itself,
he hoisted himself to the sill of the narrow open window, crouched
there a second, measuring his outward leap, and was gone.</p>
<p>He left a raging confusion behind him and an exclamatory din,
above which rang fierce and futile commands from the Podesta's
young officer.</p>
<p>One of the men-at-arms supported the swooning body of the
peasant, whilst his fellow vainly and stupidly sought to follow by
the way Lorenzaccio had gone, but failed because he lacked the
bandit's vigour.</p>
<p>Bellarion, horror-stricken and half-stupefied, stood staring at
the wretched peasant whose hurt he judged to be mortal. He was
roused by a gentle tugging at his sleeve. He half-turned to find
himself looking into the painted face of the woman whose laughter
earlier had jarred his sensibilities. It was a handsome face,
despite the tawdriness it derived from the raddled cheeks and too
vividly reddened lips. The girl&mdash;she was little more&mdash;looked kindly
concern upon him out of dark, slanting eyes that were
preternaturally bright.</p>
<p>"Away, away!" she muttered feverishly. "This is your chance.
Bestir!"</p>
<p>"My chance?" he echoed, and was conscious of the colour mounting
to his cheeks.</p>
<p>His first emotion was resentment of this misjudgment; his next a
foolish determination to stand firm and advance his explanations,
insisting upon justice being done him. All this whilst he had flung
his question, "My chance?" With the next heart-beat he perceived
the strength of the appearances against him. This poor drab, these
evil ones about her and him, offering him their sympathy only
because they believed him made kin with them by evil, advised the
only course a sane man in his case must follow.</p>
<p>"Make haste, child," the woman urged him breathlessly. "Quick,
or it will be too late."</p>
<p>He looked beyond her at the others crowding there, to meet
glances that seemed to invite, to urge; and from one bloated face
which he recognized for Benvenuto's came an eloquent wink, whilst
the fellow jerked a dirty thumb backwards towards the door in a
gesture there was no misunderstanding. Then, as if Bellarion's
sudden resolve had been reflected in his face, the press before him
parted, men and women shouldered and elbowed a way for him. He
plunged forward. The company closed behind him, opening further
ahead, closed again as he advanced and again opened before him,
until his way to the door was clear. And behind him he could hear
the young officer's voice raised above the din in oaths and
imprecations, urging his men-at-arms to clear a way with their
pikes, calling upon those other soldiers lounging there to lend a
hand so as to make sure, at least, of one of these two rogues.</p>
<p>But that rascally company, it seemed, was skilled in the tactics
the occasion needed. Honest men there may have been, and no doubt
there were, amongst them. But they were outnumbered, and moreover,
honest though they might be, they were poor folk, and therefore so
far in sympathy perhaps with an unfortunate lad as not to hinder
him even if they would not actively help. And meanwhile the others,
making pretence of being no more than spectators solicitous for the
condition of the peasant who had been stabbed, pressed so closely
about the officer and his men that the latter had no room in which
to swing their pikes.</p>
<p>All this Bellarion guessed by the sounds behind him rather than
saw. For he gave no more than a single backward glance at that
seething group as he flung across the threshold out of that
evil-smelling chamber into the clean air of the square. He turned
to the left and made on towards the cathedral, his first thought
being to seek sanctuary there. Then, realizing that thus he would
but walk into a trap, he dived down an alley just as the officer
gained the tavern door and with a view-halloo started after him,
his two pikemen and the other soldiers clattering at his heels.</p>
<p>As Bellarion raced like a stag before hounds down that narrow
street of mean houses in the shadow of Liutprand's great church, it
may well be that he recalled the abbot's parting words, "Pax multa
in cella; foris autem plurima bella", and wished himself back in
the tranquillity of the cloisters, secure from the perils and
vexations of secular existence.</p>
<p>This breathless flight of his seemed to him singularly futile
and purposeless. He knew what he was running from; but not what he
might be running to, nor indeed whither to run at all. And for
escape, knowledge of the latter is as important as of the former.
Had not instinct&mdash;the animal instinct of self-preservation&mdash;been
stronger than his reason, he would have halted, saved his breath
and waited for his pursuers to overtake him. For he was too
intelligent to wear himself in attempting to escape the
inescapable. Fortunately for him, the instinct of the hunted animal
sent him headlong forward in despite of reason. And presently there
was reason, too, to urge him. This when he realized that, after
all, his pursuers were not as fleet of foot as himself. Be it from
their heavy boots and other accoutrements, be it from his greater
youth and more Spartan habits of life, he was rapidly outdistancing
them, and thus might yet succeed in shaking them off altogether.
Then, too, he reflected that if he kept a straight course in his
flight he must end by reaching the wall of this accursed city and
by following this must gain one of the gates into the open country.
It was close on sunset. But there would be at least a full hour yet
before the gates were closed.</p>
<p>Heartened, he sped on, and only once was he in any danger. This
was when the straight course he laid himself brought him out upon
an open square, along one side of which ran a long grey building
with a noble arcade on the ground level. There was a considerable
concourse of people moving here both in the open and under the
arches, and several turned to stare at that lithe green figure as
it sped past. Caring nothing what any might think, and concerned
only to cross that open space as quickly as possible, Bellarion
gained the narrow streets beyond. Still intent upon keeping a
straight line, he turned neither to right nor to left. And
presently he found himself moving no longer between houses, but
along a grass-grown lane, between high brown walls where the ground
underfoot was soft and moist. He eased the pace a little to give
his aching lungs relief; nor knew how nearly spent he was until the
peace of his surroundings induced that lessening of effort. It
lessened further until he was merely walking, panting now, and
gasping, and mopping the sweat from his brow with the back of his
hand. He had been too reckless, he now told himself. The pace had
been too hot. He should have known that it must defeat him. Unless
by now he had shaken off those pursuers, or others they might have
enlisted&mdash;and that was his great fear&mdash;he was a lost man.</p>
<p>He came to a standstill, listening. He could hear, he fancied,
sounds in the distance which warned him that the pursuit still
held. Panic spurred his flanks again. But though it might be urgent
to resume his flight, it was more urgent still to pause first to
recover breath.</p>
<p>He had come to a halt beside a stout oaken door which was
studded with great nails and set in a deep archway in that high
wall. To take his moment's rest he leaned against these solid
timbers. And then, to his amazement, under the weight of his body,
the ponderous door swung inwards, so that he almost fell through it
into a space of lawn and rose-beds narrowly enclosed within tall
boxwood hedges which were very dense and trimly cut.</p>
<p>It was as if a miracle had happened, as if that door had been
unlocked for his salvation by supernatural agency. Thus thought he
in that moment of exaggerated reaction from his panic, nor stayed
to reflect that in entering and in closing and bolting that door he
was as likely to entrap as to deliver himself. There was a deep
sill some two feet above the ground on the inner side. On this
Bellarion sat down to indulge the luxury of a sense of security.
But not for very long. Presently steps, quick and numerous, came
pattering down that lane, to an accompaniment of breathless
voices.</p>
<p>Bellarion listened, and smiled a little. They would never guess
that he had found this door ajar. They would pass on, continuing
their now fruitless quest, whilst he could linger until night
descended. Perhaps he would spend the night there and be off in the
morning by the time the gates of the city should have been
reopened.</p>
<p>Thus he proposed. And then the steps outside came to a sudden
halt, and his heart almost halted with them.</p>
<p>"He paused hereabouts," said a gruff voice. "Look at the trodden
ground."</p>
<p>That was a shrewd-eyed sleuth, thought Bellarion as he listened
fearfully.</p>
<p>"Does it matter?" quoth another. "Will you stand pausing too
whilst he makes off? Come on. He went this way we know."</p>
<p>"Hold, numbskull!" It was the gruff voice again. "He came this
way, but he went no farther. Bah! Peace, don't argue with me, man.
Use your eyes. It's plain to see. No one has gone past this door
today. He's here." And on the word a heavy blow, as from a pike
butt, smote the timbers and brought Bellarion to his feet as if he,
himself, had been struck.</p>
<p>"But this door is always locked, and he could scarcely have
climbed the wall."</p>
<p>"He's here, I say. Don't argue. Two men to guard the door lest
he come forth again. The rest with me to the palace. Come." His
voice was harsh and peremptory. There were no further words in
answer. Steps moved off quickly, returning up the lane. Steps paced
outside the door, and there was a mutter of voices of the men
placed on guard.</p>
<p>Bellarion wondered if prayer would help him. He could think of
nothing else that would.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-04" id="ch-1-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. SANCTUARY</h2>
<p>These grounds into which he had stepped through that doorway in
the red wall seemed, so far as the tall hedges of his hortus
inclusus would permit him to discover, to be very spacious.
Somewhere in their considerable extent there would surely be a
hiding-place into which he could creep until the hunt was over.</p>
<p>He went forward to investigate, stepping cautiously towards a
deep archway cut in the dense boxwood. In this archway he paused to
survey a prospect that evoked thoughts of Paradise. Beyond a wide
sweep of lawn whereon two peacocks strutted sparkled the waters of
a miniature lake, where a pavilion of white marble, whose smooth
dome and graceful pillars suggested a diminutive Roman temple,
appeared to float. Access to this was gained from the shore by an
arched marble bridge, over whose white parapet trailing geraniums
flamed.</p>
<p>From this high place the ground fell away in a flight of two
terraces, and the overflow from the lake went cascading over
granite boulders into tanks of granite set in each of them, with
shading vine trellises above that were heavy now with purple fruit.
Below, another emerald lawn was spread, sheltered on three sides
within high walls of yew fantastically cut at the summit into the
machicolations of an embattled parapet and bearing at intervals
deep arched niches in which marble statues gleamed white against
the dusky green. Here figures sauntered, courtly figures of men and
women more gaudy and glittering in their gay raiment than the
peacocks nearer at hand; and faintly on the still warm air of
evening came the throbbing of a lute which one of them was idly
thrumming.</p>
<p>Beyond, on the one open side, another shallow terrace rose, and
upon this a great red house that was half-palace, half-fortress,
flanked at each side by a massive round tower with covered
battlements.</p>
<p>So much Bellarion's questing eyes beheld, and then he checked
his breath, for his sharp ears had caught the sound of a stealthy
step just beyond the hedge that screened him. An instant later he
was confronted by a woman who, with something furtive and cautious
in her movements, appeared suddenly before him in the archway.</p>
<p>For half a dozen heart-beats they stood thus, each regarding the
other; and the vision of her in the breathless moment was destined
never to fade from Bellarion's mind. She was of middle height, and
her close-fitting gown of sapphire blue, laced in gold from neck to
waist, revealed her to be slender. There was about her an air of
delicate dignity, of command tempered by graciousness. For the
rest, her hair was of a tawny golden, a shade deeper than the
golden threads of the jewelled caul in which it was confined; her
face was small and pale, too long in the nose, perhaps, for perfect
symmetry, yet for that very reason the more challenging in its
singular, elusive beauty. Great wistful eyes of brown, wide set and
thoughtful, were charged with questions as they conned Bellarion.
They were singularly searching, singularly compelling eyes, and
they drew from him forthwith a frank confession.</p>
<p>"Lady!" he faltered. "Of your charity! I am pursued!"</p>
<p>"Pursued!" She moved a step, and her expression changed. The
wistfulness was replaced by concern in those great sombre eyes. "I
am likely to be hanged if taken," he added, to quicken the
excellent emotions he detected.</p>
<p>"By whom are you pursued?"</p>
<p>"An officer of the Captain of Justice and his men." He would
have added more. He would have said something to assure that in
seeking her pity he sought it for an innocent man betrayed by
appearances. But she gave signs that her pity needed no such
stimulant. She made a little gesture of distraction, clasping her
long tapering hands over which the tight blue sleeves descended to
the knuckles. She flung a swift searching glance behind her from
the green archway to the open spaces.</p>
<p>"Come," she said, and beckoned him forward. "I will hide you."
And then on a note of deeper anxiety, for which he blessed her
tender, charitable heart, she added: "If you are found here all is
lost. Crouch low and follow me."</p>
<p>Obediently he followed, almost on all fours, creeping beside a
balustrade of mellow brick that stood breast-high to make a parapet
for the edge of that very spacious terrace.</p>
<p>Ahead of him the lady moved sedately and unhurried, thereby
discovering to Bellarion virtues of mental calm and calculating
wit. A fool, he told himself, would have gone in haste, and thus
provoked attention and inquiry.</p>
<p>They came in safety to the foot of the marble bridge, which
Bellarion now perceived to be crossed by broad steps ascending to a
platform at the summit and descending thence again to the level of
the temple on the water.</p>
<p>"Wait. Here we must go with care." She turned to survey the
gardens below, and as she looked he saw her blench, saw the
golden-brown eyes dilate as if in fear. He could not see what she
saw: the glint of arms upon hurrying men emerging from the palace.
But the guess he made went near enough to the fact before she cried
out: "Too late! If you ascend now you will be seen." And she told
him of the soldiers. Again she gave evidence of her shrewd sense.
"Do you go first," she bade him, "and on hands and knees. If I
follow I may serve as a screen for you, and we must hope they will
not see you."</p>
<p>"The hope," said Bellarion, "is as slender as the screen your
slenderness would afford me, lady." He was lying now flat on the
ground at her feet. "If only it had pleased Heaven to make you as
fat as you are charitable, I'd not hesitate. As it is, I think I
see a better way."</p>
<p>She stared down at him, a little frown puckering her white brow.
But for the third time in that brief space she proved herself a
woman whose mind seized upon essentials and disregarded lesser
things.</p>
<p>"A better way? What way, then?"</p>
<p>He had been using his eyes. Beyond the domed pavilion a tongue
of land thrust out into the lake, from which three cypresses rose
in black silhouette against the afterglow of sunset, whilst a
little alder-bush, its branches trailing in the water, blunted the
island's point.</p>
<p>"This way," said Bellarion, and went writhing like an eel in the
direction of the water.</p>
<p>"Where will you go?" she cried, and added sharply as he reached
the edge: "It is very deep; two fathoms at the shallowest."</p>
<p>"So much the better," said Bellarion. "They'll be the less like
to seek me in it."</p>
<p>He took a succession of deep breaths to prepare himself for the
long submersion.</p>
<p>"Ah, but wait!" she cried on a strained note. "Tell me, at
least..."</p>
<p>She broke off with a catch in her breath. He was gone. He had
slipped in taking the water quietly as an otter, and save for the
wave that sped across the lake no sign of him remained.</p>
<p>The lady stood breathlessly at gaze waiting to see the surface
broken by his emerging head. But she waited vainly and in growing
alarm. The moments passed. Voices behind her became audible and
grew in volume. The men-at-arms were advancing swiftly, the
courtiers following to see the sport their captain promised.
Suddenly from the alder-bush on the island's point a startled
water-hen broke forth in squawking terror and went scudding across
the lake, its feet trailing along the water, into which it finally
splashed again within a yard of the farther shore. From within the
bush itself some slight momentary disturbance sent a succession of
ripples across the lesser ripples whipped up by the evening breeze.
Then all grew still again, including the alarms of the watching
lady, who had perceived and read these signs.</p>
<p>She drew closer about her white slender shoulders a little
mantle edged with miniver and moved like one impelled by natural
curiosity to meet the soldiers who came surging up the terrace
steps. There were four of them, led by that same young officer who
had invaded the Hostelry of the Stag in quest of Lorenzaccio.</p>
<p>"What is this?" the lady greeted him, her tone a little hard, as
if his abrupt invasion of her garden were in itself an offence.
"What are you seeking here?"</p>
<p>"A man, Madonna," the captain answered her shortly, having at
the moment no breath for more.</p>
<p>Her sombre eyes went past him to dwell upon the three gallants
in the courtly group of five that followed at the soldier's
heels.</p>
<p>"A man?" she echoed. "I do not remember to have seen such a
portent hereabout in days."</p>
<p>Of the three at whom the shaft of her irony was directed two
laughed outright in shameless sycophancy; the third flushed
scarlet, his glance resentful. He was the youngest by some years,
and still a boy. He had her own brown eyes and tawny hair, and
otherwise resembled her, save that his countenance lacked the firm
strength that might be read in hers. His slim, graceful stripling
figure was gorgeously arrayed in a kilted tunic of gold brocade
with long green, deeply foliated sleeves, the ends of which reached
almost to his toes. His girdle was of hammered gold whence hung a
poniard with a jewelled hilt, and a ruby glowed in his bulging cap
of green silk. One of his legs was cased in green, the other in
yellow, and he wore a green shoe on the yellow foot and a yellow on
the green. This, in the sixteenth year of his age, was the Lord
Gian Giacomo Paleologo, sovereign Marquis of Montferrat.</p>
<p>His two male companions were Messer Corsario, his tutor, a
foxy-faced man of thirty, whose rich purple gown would have been
more proper to a courtier than a pedant, and the Lord Castruccio da
Fenestrella, a young man of perhaps five-and-twenty, very gorgeous
in a scarlet houppelande, and not unhandsome, despite his pallid
cheeks, thin lank hair and rather shifty eyes. It was upon him that
Giacomo now turned in peevishness.</p>
<p>"Do not laugh, Castruccio."</p>
<p>Meanwhile the captain was flinging out an arm in command to his
followers. "Two of you to search the enclosure yonder about the
gate. Beat up the hedges. Two of you with me." He swung to the lady
before she could answer her brother. "You have seen no one,
highness?"</p>
<p>Her highness was guilty of an evasion. "Should I not tell you if
I had?"</p>
<p>"Yet a man certainly entered here not many minutes since by the
garden door."</p>
<p>"You saw him enter?"</p>
<p>"I saw clear signs that he had entered."</p>
<p>"Signs? What signs?"</p>
<p>He told her. Her mobile lips expressed a doubt before she
uttered it.</p>
<p>"A poor warrant that for this intrusion, Ser Bernabo."</p>
<p>The captain grew uncomfortable. "Highness, you mistake my
motives."</p>
<p>"I hope I do," she answered lightly, and turned her shoulder to
him.</p>
<p>He commanded his two waiting followers. The others were already
in the enclosed garden. "To the temple!"</p>
<p>At that she turned again, her eyes indignant. "Without my leave?
The temple, sir, is my own private bower."</p>
<p>The captain hesitated, ill at ease. "Hardly at present,
highness. It is in the hands of the workmen; and this fellow may be
hiding there."</p>
<p>"He is not. He could not be in the temple without my knowledge.
I am but come from there."</p>
<p>"Your memory, highness, is at fault. As I approached, you were
coming along the terrace from the enclosed garden."</p>
<p>She flushed under the correction. And there was a pause before
she slowly answered him: "Your eyes are too good, Bernabo." In a
tone that made him change countenance she added: "I shall remember
it, together with your reluctance to accept my word."
Contemptuously she dismissed him. "Pray make your search without
regard for me."</p>
<p>The captain stood a moment hesitating. Then he bowed stiffly
from the hips, tossed his head in silent command to his men, and so
led them off over the marble bridge.</p>
<p>After he had drawn blank, like the soldiers he had sent to
search the enclosure, he returned, baffled, with his four fellows
at his heels. The Princess Valeria wandered now in company with
those other gay ones along the terrace by the balustrade.</p>
<p>"You come empty-handed, then," she rallied him.</p>
<p>"I'll stake my life he entered the garden," said the captain
sullenly.</p>
<p>"You are wise in staking something of no value."</p>
<p>He disregarded alike the taunt and the titter it drew from her
companions. "I must report to his highness. Do you say positively,
Madonna, that you did not see this fellow?"</p>
<p>"Lord, man! Do you still presume to question me? Besides, if
you're so confident, why waste time in questions? Continue your
search."</p>
<p>The captain addressed himself to her companions. "You, sirs and
ladies, did you have no glimpse of this knave&mdash;a tall youngster,
dressed in green?"</p>
<p>"In green?" cried the Lady Valeria. "Now that is interesting. In
green? A dryad, perhaps; or, perhaps my brother here."</p>
<p>The captain shook his head. "That is not possible."</p>
<p>"Nor am I in green," added the young Marquis. "Nor have I been
outside the garden. She mocks you, Messer Bernabo. It is her cursed
humour. We have seen no one."</p>
<p>"Nor you, Messer Corsario?" Pointedly now the captain addressed
the pedant, as by his years and office the likeliest to return him
a serious answer.</p>
<p>"Indeed, no," the gentleman replied. "But then," he added, "we
were some way off, as you observed. Madonna, however, who was up
here, asserts that she saw no one."</p>
<p>"Ah! But does she so assert it?" the captain insisted.</p>
<p>The Lady Valeria looked him over in chill disdain. "You all
heard what I said. Repetition is a weariness."</p>
<p>"You see?" the captain appealed to them.</p>
<p>Her brother came to his assistance. "Why can't you answer
plainly and have done, Valeria? Why must you for ever remember to
be witty? Why can't you just say 'no'?"</p>
<p>"Because I've answered plainly enough already, and my answer has
been disregarded. Ser Bernabo shall have no opportunity to repeat
an offence I am not likely to forget." She turned away. "Come,
Dionara, and you, Isotta. It is growing chilly."</p>
<p>With her ladies obediently following her she descended towards
the lower gardens and the palace.</p>
<p>Messer Bernabo stroked his chin, a man nonplussed. The Lord
Castruccio chided him.</p>
<p>"You're a fool, Bernabo, to anger her highness. Besides, man,
what mare's nest are you hunting?"</p>
<p>The soldier was pale with vexation. "You saw as I did that as we
crossed the gardens her highness was coming from that
enclosure."</p>
<p>"Yes, booby," said Corsario, "and we saw as you did that she
came alone. If a man entered by that gate as you say, he got no
farther than the enclosed garden, and this your men have searched
already. You gain nothing by betraying suspicions. Who and what do
you suppose this man?"</p>
<p>"Suppose! I know."</p>
<p>"What do you know?"</p>
<p>"That he is a rogue, a brigand scoundrel; associate of
Lorenzaccio da Trino, who slipped through our fingers an hour
ago."</p>
<p>"By the Host!" cried Corsario, in genuine surprise. "I
thought..." He checked abruptly, and dissembled the break by a
laugh. "And can you dream that the Lady Valeria would harbour a
robber?"</p>
<p>"Can I dream, can any man dream, what the Lady Valeria will
do?"</p>
<p>"I could dream that she'll put your eyes out, if ever the power
is hers," lisped the Lord of Fenestrella with the malice that was
of his nature.</p>
<p>"You heard her say they are too good and that she'll remember
it. You should be less ready to tell her all you see. He is a fool
who helps to make a woman wise."</p>
<p>The Marquis laughed to applaud his friend's philosophy, and his
glance approved him fawningly.</p>
<p>The young soldier considered them. "Sirs, I will resume my
search."</p>
<p>When they had searched until night closed in upon the world,
investigating every hedge and bush that might afford concealment,
the captain came to think that either he had been at fault in
concluding that the fugitive had sought shelter in the garden, or
else the rogue had found some way out and was now beyond their
reach.</p>
<p>He retired crestfallen, and the three gentleman who had
accompanied his search and who did not conceal their amusement at
his failure went in to supper.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-05" id="ch-1-05"></a>CHAPTER V. THE PRINCESS</h2>
<p>At about the time that the young Lord of Montferrat was sitting
down belatedly to table with his tutor and his
gentleman-in-waiting, a very bedraggled and chilled Bellarion, who
for two hours had been standing immersed to the chin in water, his
head amid the branches of the alder-bush, came cautiously forth at
last. He ventured no farther, however, than the shallow tongue of
land behind the marble pavilion, ready at the first alarm to plunge
back into his water concealment.</p>
<p>There he lay, shivering in the warm night and taking stock of
his plight, an exercise which considerably diminished him in his
self-confidence and self-esteem.</p>
<p>"Experience," he had been wont to say&mdash;being rather addicted, I
gather, to the making of epigrammatic formulae&mdash;"is the hornbook of
fools, unnecessary for the practical purposes of life to the man of
wit."</p>
<p>It is possible that he was tempted to revise this dictum in the
light of the events of that disastrous day, recognizing that a
little of the worldly experience he despised might have saved him
most, if not all, of its disasters. If he admitted this without yet
admitting the fallacy of his aphorism it was only to reach a
conclusion even more humiliating. He had strayed from lack of
experience, therefore it followed, he told himself, that he was a
fool. That is one of the dangers of reasoning by syllogism.</p>
<p>He had accepted the companionship of a man whose face pronounced
him a scoundrel, and whose various actions in the course of the day
confirmed the message of his face, and this for no better reason
than that the man wore a Franciscan's frock. If his sense did not
apprise him that a Franciscan's habit does not necessarily cover a
St. Francis, there was a well-known proverb&mdash;"cucullum non facit
monachum"&mdash;which he might have remembered. Because sense and memory
had alike failed him, he had lost his purse, he had lost the letter
which was his passport for the long and arduous journey before him,
he had narrowly escaped losing his liberty, and he would be lucky
if he were quit of all this mischief without losing his life. The
lesser evils of the ruin of a serviceable suit of clothes and the
probability of taking a rheum as the result of his immersion went
for the moment disregarded.</p>
<p>Next he considered the rashness, the senselessness, of his
seeking sanctuary in this garden. Was worldly experience really
necessary, he wondered, to teach a man that the refuge of which he
does not know the exit may easily become a trap? Had he not
excelled at the Grazie as a chess player from his care and ability
in pondering the moves that must follow the immediate one? Had he
read&mdash;amongst other works on the art of war which had ever held his
mind in fascination&mdash;the De Re Militari of Silvius Faustus to so
little purpose that he could not remember one of its first axioms,
to the effect that he is an imprudent leader who goes into action
without making sure that his line of retreat is open?</p>
<p>By such questions as these did Bellarion chastise himself as he
crouched there shivering in the dark. Still lower did he crouch,
making himself one with the earth itself, when presently a moon,
like a golden slice of melon, emerged from behind the black bulk of
the palace and shed a ghostly radiance upon those gardens. He set
himself then at last to seek a course by which he might extricate
himself from this trap and from this city of Casale.</p>
<p>He was still far from any solution of that problem when a sound
of voices recalled him to more immediate things. Two figures
mounting the steps of the terrace had to him the appearance of two
black human silhouettes that were being slowly pushed up out of the
ground. Their outline defined them for women even before he made
out their voices to be feminine. He wondered would one of them be
the gracious and beautiful lady who had given him sanctuary, a lady
whose like hitherto he had seen only painted on canvas above altars
and in mural frescoes, the existence of whose living earthly
counterparts had been to him a matter of some subconscious
doubt.</p>
<p>At the height of the bridge, so tremulously reflected in silver
on the black water below, the ladies paused, speaking the while in
subdued voices. Then they came down the nearer steps and vanished
into the temple, whence presently one of them emerged upon that
narrow shallow promontory calling softly and very vaguely:</p>
<p>"Ola! Ola! Messer! Messer!"</p>
<p>He recognized the voice, and recognizing it realized that its
quality was individual and unforgettable.</p>
<p>To the Lady Valeria as she stood there, it seemed that a part of
the promontory's clay at her feet heaved itself up amorphously,
writhed into human shape, and so resolved itself into the man she
sought. She checked a startled outcry, as she understood the nature
of this materialization.</p>
<p>"You will be very wet, sir, and cold." Her voice was gentle and
solicitous; very different from that in which she had addressed her
brother's companions and the captain.</p>
<p>Bellarion was quite frank. "As wet as a drowned man, and very
nearly as cold." And he added: "I would I could be sure I shall yet
be hung up to dry."</p>
<p>The lady laughed softly at his rueful humour. "Nay now, we have
brought the means to make you dry more comfortably. But it was very
rash of you to have entered here without first making sure that you
were not observed."</p>
<p>"I was not observed, Madonna. Else be sure I should not have
entered."</p>
<p>He caught in the gloom the sound of her breath indrawn with a
hiss of sudden apprehension. "You were not observed? And yet...Oh,
it is just as I was fearing." And then more briskly, and before he
could reply. "But come," she urged him. "We have brought fresh
clothes for you. When you are dry you shall tell me all."</p>
<p>Readily enough he allowed himself to be conducted within the
single circular chamber of the marble pavilion, where Madonna
Dionara, her lady, awaited. The place was faintly lighted by a
lantern placed on a marble table. It contained besides this some
chairs that were swathed in coarse sheets, and a long wooden
coffer, carved and painted, in shape and size like a sarcophagus,
from which another such sheet had just been swept. The three open
spaces, between twin pillars, facing towards the palace were now
closed by leather curtains. The circular marble floor was laid out
as a dial, with the hours in Roman figures of carved brass sunk
into the polished surface, a matter this which puzzled him. He was
not to guess that this marble pavilion was a copy in miniature of a
Roman temple of Apollo, and that in the centre of the domed roof
there was a circular opening for the sun, through which its rays so
entered that as the day progressed a time-telling shadow moved
across the hours figured in their circle on the floor.</p>
<p>Overhead there was a confusion of poles and scaffolding and
trailing dust-sheets, and in a corner an array of pails and buckets
and all the litter of suspended painters' work. Dimly, on one of
the walls, he could make out a fresco that was half-painted, the
other half in charcoal outline.</p>
<p>On the table, which was swathed like all the other furnishings,
the lantern revealed a bundle of red garments lately loosed from a
confining cloak of black. Into these he was bidden to change at
once. Red, he was told, had been deliberately chosen because all
that the captain seemed to know of him was that he had been dressed
in green. So that not merely would his protectress render him dry
and warm again; she would disguise him. The ladies meanwhile would
keep watch in the garden immediately below. They had brought a
lute. If one of them should sing to it, this would mean that she
sounded the alarm, and he must hide in the coffer, taking with him
everything that might betray his presence, including the lantern
which he must extinguish. Flint and steel and tinder had not been
forgotten, so that light might be rekindled when the danger was
overpast. Her highness raised the lid of the coffer to reveal to
him the mechanism of the snap lock. This was released, of course,
by the key, which should then be withdrawn. Provided he did this,
once he allowed the lid to close upon him none would be able to
open it from the outside; whilst from the inside it was an easy
matter, even in the dark, to release the catch. Meanwhile the
keyhole would provide him with sufficient air and at the same time
permit him to judge by sounds what was happening. The wet garments
he removed were to be made into a bundle and dropped into the
coffer, whence they would afterwards be taken and destroyed.
Finally, he was given ten minutes in which to make the change.</p>
<p>Abruptly he found himself alone and so impressed by her commands
that already his fingers were swiftly untrussing his points. He
went briskly to work, first to strip himself, then to rub himself
dry and restore his chilled circulation, for which purpose he
heedlessly employed the black cloak in which the fresh garments had
been bundled. Then he set about donning that scarlet raiment of
fine quality and modish fashion, all the while lost in wonder of
her graciousness and resource. She revealed herself, he reflected,
as a woman fit to lead and to command, a woman with a methodical
mind and a well-ordered intelligence which many a captain of men
might envy. And she revealed herself, too, as intensely womanly an
angel of compassion. Although clearly a lady of great rank she
nevertheless went to so much pains and thought to save a wretched
fugitive like himself, and this without pausing to ascertain if he
were worthy of compassion.</p>
<p>As abruptly as she had left him did she now return, even as he
was completing his hasty toilet. And she came alone, having left
her lady with the lute on guard below.</p>
<p>He stood now before her, a brave figure despite his tumbled
black locks and the fact that the red hose of fine cloth was a
little short for his long shanks, and therefore a little cramping.
But the kilted tunic became him well with its girdle of steel and
leather which he was buckling even as she entered.</p>
<p>She swept forward to the table and came straight to
business.</p>
<p>"And now, sir, your message?"</p>
<p>His fingers stood arrested on the buckle and his solemn dark
eyes opened wide as they searched her pale face.</p>
<p>"Message?" quoth he slowly.</p>
<p>"Message&mdash;yes." Her tone betrayed the least impatience. "What
has happened? What has become of Ser Giuffredo? Why has he not been
near me this fortnight? What did the Lord Barbaresco bid you tell
me? Come, come, sir. You need not hesitate. Surely you know that I
am the Princess Valeria of Montferrat?"</p>
<p>All that he understood of this was that he stood in a princely
presence, before the august sister of the sovereign Marquis of
Montferrat. Had he been reared in the world he might have been
awe-stricken by the circumstance. But he knew princes and
princesses only from books written by chroniclers and historians,
who treat them familiarly enough. If anything about her commanded
his respect it was her slim grace and her rather elusive beauty, a
beauty that is not merely of colour and of features but of the soul
and mind alive in these.</p>
<p>His hands fell limply away from the buckle, which he had made
fast at length. His lively countenance looked almost foolish as
dimly seen in the yellow light of the lantern.</p>
<p>"Madonna, I do not understand. I am no messenger. I..."</p>
<p>"You are no messenger?" Her tawny head was thrust forward, her
dark eyes glowed. "Were you not sent to me? Answer, man! Were you
not sent?"</p>
<p>"Not other than by an inscrutable Providence, which may desire
to preserve me for better things than a rope."</p>
<p>The whimsical note of the answer may have checked her stirring
anger. There was a long pause in which she pondered him with eyes
that were become unfathomable. Mechanically she loosed the long
black cloak that covered her low-cut sheathing gown of sapphire
blue. "Why then, did you come? Was it to spy?...No, no. You are not
that. A spy would have gone differently to work. What are you,
then?"</p>
<p>"Just a poor scholar on his travels, studying life at first hand
and a trifle more rapidly than he can digest it. As for how I came
into your garden, let me tell you."</p>
<p>And he told her with admirable succinctness the sorry tale of
that day's events. It drove the last vestige of wrath from her face
and drew the ghost of a smile to the corners of a mouth that could
be as tender as imperious. Observing it, he realized that whilst
she had given him sanctuary under a misapprehension, yet she was
not likely to visit her obvious disappointment too harshly upon
him.</p>
<p>"And I thought..." She broke off and trilled a little laugh
between mirth and bitterness. "It was a lucky chance for you,
master fugitive." She considered him again, and it may be that his
stalwart young male beauty had a hand unconsciously in shaping her
resolves concerning him. "What am I to do with you?" she asked
him.</p>
<p>He answered simply and directly, speaking not as a poor nameless
scholar to a high-born princess but as equal to equal, as a young
man to a young woman.</p>
<p>"If you are what your face tells me, Madonna, you will let me
profit by an error that entails no loss for yourself beyond that of
these garments, which, if you wish it..."</p>
<p>She waved the proposal aside before it was uttered. "Pooh, the
garments. What are they?" She frowned thoughtfully. "But I named
names to you."</p>
<p>"Did you? I have forgotten them." And in answer to the hard
incredulity of her stare he explained himself. "A good memory,
Madonna, lies as much in an ability to forget as in a capacity to
remember. And I have an excellent memory. By the time I shall have
stepped out of this. garden I shall have no recollection that I was
ever in it."</p>
<p>Slowly she spoke after a pause. "If I were sure that I can trust
you..." She left it there.</p>
<p>Bellarion smiled. "Unless you are certain that you can, you had
better call the guard. But then, how could you be sure that in that
case I should not recall the names you named which are now
forgotten?"</p>
<p>"Ah! You threaten!"</p>
<p>The sharp tone, the catch in her breath, the sudden movement of
her hand to her breast showed him that his inference was right.</p>
<p>This lady was engaged in secret practices. And the inference
itself displayed the swift activity of his wits just as his answer
displayed them.</p>
<p>"Nay, lady. I show you only that trust me you must, since if you
mistrust me you can no more order my arrest than you can set me
free."</p>
<p>"My faith, sir, you are shrewd for one who's convent-bred."</p>
<p>"There's a deal of shrewdness, lady, to be learned in convents."
And then, whether the beauty and charm of her so wrought upon him
as to breed in him the desire to serve her or whether he merely
offered a bargain, a return for value received and to be received,
it is probable that he did not know himself. But he made his
proposal. "If you would trust me, Madonna, you might even use me,
and so repay yourself."</p>
<p>"Use you?"</p>
<p>"As a messenger. In the place of him whom you expected. That is
if you have messages to send, as I think you should have."</p>
<p>"You think it?"</p>
<p>"From what you have said."</p>
<p>"I said so little." She was clearly suspicious.</p>
<p>"But I inferred so much. Too much perhaps. Let me expose my
reasoning," The truth is he was a little vain of it. "You expected
a messenger from one Lord Barbaresco. You left the garden gate ajar
to facilitate his entrance when he came, and you were on the watch
for him, and alone. Your ladies, one of whom at least is in your
confidence, were beguiling the gentleman and keeping them in the
lower garden whilst you loitered watchful by the hedged enclosure.
Hence I argue on your part anxiety and secrecy. You were anxious
because no message had come for a fortnight, nor had Messer
Giuffredo, the usual messenger, been seen. Almost you may have
feared that some evil had befallen Messer Giuffredo, if not the
Lord Barbaresco himself. Which shows that the secret practices of
which these messages are the subject may themselves be dangerous.
Do I read the signs fluently enough?"</p>
<p>There was little need for his question. Her face supplied the
answer.</p>
<p>"Too fluently, I think. Too fluently for one who is no more than
you represent yourself."</p>
<p>"It is, Madonna, that you are not accustomed to the exercise of
pure reason. It is rare enough.'</p>
<p>"Pure reason!" Her scorn, where his fatuity had expected wonder,
was like a searing iron. "And do you know, sir, what my pure reason
is?"</p>
<p>"I can believe anything, Madonna," he said, alluding to the tone
she used with him.</p>
<p>"That you were sent to set a trap for me."</p>
<p>He perceived exactly by what steps she had come to that
conclusion. He smiled reassuringly and shook his moist head.</p>
<p>"The reasoning is not pure enough. If I had been so sent, should
I have been pursued and hunted? And should I not have come prepared
with some trivial message to assure you that I am the messenger you
were so very ready to believe me?"</p>
<p>She was convinced. But still she hesitated.</p>
<p>"But why, concluding so much and so accurately, should you offer
to serve me?"</p>
<p>"Say from gratitude to one who has saved perhaps my life."</p>
<p>"But I did so under a misapprehension. That should compel no
gratitude."</p>
<p>"I like to think, Madonna, that you would have shown me the same
charity even if there had been no misapprehension. I am the more
grateful for what you have done because I choose to believe that in
any case you would have done it. Then there is this handsome suit
to be paid for, and lastly and chiefly the desire to serve a lady
in need of service, which I believe is not an altogether strange
desire in a man of sensibility. It has happened aforetime."</p>
<p>That was as near as he would go to the confession that she had
beglamoured him. Since it was a state of mind that did not rest
upon pure reason, it is one to which he would have been reluctant
to confess even to himself.</p>
<p>She pondered him, and it seemed to him that her searching glance
laid bare all that he was and all that he was likely to be.</p>
<p>"These are slight and unwordly reasons," she said at last.</p>
<p>"I am possibly an unworldly fellow."</p>
<p>"You must be, indeed, to propose knight-errantry." but her need,
as he had already surmised, and as he was later fully to
understand, was great and urgent. It may almost have seemed to her
indeed, as if Providence had brought her this young man not only
for his salvation but for hers.</p>
<p>"The service may entail risk," she warned him, "and a risk far
greater than any you have run tonight."</p>
<p>"Risk sweetens enterprise," he answered, "and wit can conquer
it."</p>
<p>Her smile broadened; almost she laughed. "You have a high
confidence in your wit, sir."</p>
<p>"Whereas, you would say, the experience of the last
four-and-twenty hours should make me humble. Its lesson, believe
me, has not been lost. I am not again to be misled by
appearances."</p>
<p>"Well, here's to test you, then." And she gave him her message,
which was, after all, a very cautious one, the betrayal of which
could hardly harm her. He was to seek the Lord Barbaresco, of whom
she told him nothing beyond the fact that the gentleman dwelt in a
house behind the cathedral, which any townsman would point out to
him. He was to inquire after his health, about which, he was to
add, the absence of news was making her uneasy. As a credential to
the Lord Barbaresco she gave him the broken half of a gold
ducat.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow evening," she concluded, "you will find the garden
gate ajar again about the same hour and I shall be waiting."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-06" id="ch-1-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. THE WINDS OF
FATE</h2>
<p>You behold Messer Bellarion treading the giddy slope of high and
mysterious adventure, fortuitously launched upon a course whose end
he was very far from discerning, but which most certainly was not
the University of Pavia, the pursuit of Greek studies, and the
recovery of an unblemished faith.</p>
<p>Lorenzaccio da Trino is answerable for more than the acts of
brigandage for which the law pursued him.</p>
<p>In the gloom of that September night, after the moon had set,
Bellarion, in raiment which already might be taken to symbolize the
altered aim and purpose of his life&mdash;whereof himself, poor straw
upon the wind of Fate, he was as yet unconscious&mdash;slipped from a
gateway that was no longer guarded and directed his steps towards
the heart of the town.</p>
<p>Coming in the Cathedral Square upon a company of the watch going
the rounds with pikes and lanterns, he staggered a little in his
gait and broke raucously into song to give himself the air of a
belated care-free reveller. Knowing no bawdy worldly ditties proper
to a man of his apparent circumstances and condition, he broke into
a Gregorian chant, which he rendered in anything but the unisonous
manner proper to that form of plain-song. The watch, deeming him,
as he computed that they would, an impudent parodist, warned him
against disturbing the peace of the night, and asked who he was,
whence he came, and whither he went.</p>
<p>Unprepared for these questions, he rose magnificently and rather
incoherently to the occasion.</p>
<p>He knew that there was a house of Augustinian fathers in
Casale.</p>
<p>And boldly he stated that he had been supping there. Thus
launched his invention soared. His sister was married to the
Prior's brother, and he had borne messages to the Prior from that
same brother who dwelt in Cigliano, and was, like himself, a
subject of the Duke of Savoy. He was lodged with his cousin-german,
the Lord Barbaresco, whose house, having arrived but that day in
Casale, he was experiencing some difficulty in finding.</p>
<p>"Body of Bacchus! Is that the reason?" quoth the leader of the
patrol to the infinite amusement of his men.</p>
<p>They were as convinced as he himself was appalled by the fluency
of his lying. Perhaps from that sympathy which men in his supposed
state so commonly command, perhaps from the hope of a reward, they
volunteered to escort him to his cousin's dwelling.</p>
<p>To the narrow street behind the cathedral of which the Lord
Barbaresco's was the most imposing house they now conducted him,
and loudly they battered on his lordship's iron-studded door, until
from a window overhead a quavering voice desired to know who
knocked.</p>
<p>"His lordship's cousin returning home," replied the officer of
the watch. "Make haste to open."</p>
<p>There was a mutter of voices in the dark overhead, and Bellarion
awaited fearfully the repudiation that he knew must come.</p>
<p>"What cousin?" roared another, deeper voice. "I am expecting no
cousin at this hour."</p>
<p>"He is angry with me," Bellarion explained. "I had promised to
return to sup with him." He threw back his head, called up into the
night in a voice momentarily clear. "Although the hour is late, I
pray you, cousin, do not leave me standing here. Admit me and
all&mdash;all shall be explained." He stressed the verb, which for the
Lord Barbaresco should have one meaning and for the too
pertinacious watch another. And then he added certain mystic words
to clinch the matter: "And bring a ducat to reward these good
fellows. I have promised them a ducat, and have upon me only half a
ducat. The half of a ducat," he repeated, as if with inebriate
insistence. "And what is half a ducat? No more than a broken
coin."</p>
<p>The soldiers grinned at his drunken whimsicality. There was a
long moment's pause. Then the deep voice above said, "Wait!" and a
casement slammed.</p>
<p>Soon came a rasping of bolts, and the heavy door swung inwards
revealing a stout man in a purple bed-gown, who shaded a
candle-flame with his hand. The light was thrown up into a red
fleshly face that was boldly humorous, with a hooked nose and alert
blue eyes under arched black brows.</p>
<p>Bellarion was quick to supply the cue. "Dear cousin, my excuses.
I should have returned sooner. These good fellows have been most
kind to me in this strange town." Standing a little in front of the
unsuspecting members of the watch, he met the Lord Barbaresco's
searching glance by a grimace of warning. "Give them the ducat for
their pains, cousin and let them go with go with God."</p>
<p>His lordship came prepared, it seemed. "I thank you, sir," he
said to the antient, "for your care of my cousin, a stranger here."
And he dropped a gold coin into the readily projected palm. He
stood aside, his hand upon the edge of the door. "Come you in,
cousin."</p>
<p>But once alone with his enforced visitor in the stone passage,
dimly lighted by that single candle, his lordship's manner
changed.</p>
<p>"Who the devil are you, and what the devil do you seek?"</p>
<p>Bellarion showed his fine teeth in a broad smile, all sign of
his intoxication vanished. "If you had not already answered those
questions for yourself you would neither have admitted me nor
parted with your ducat, sir. I am what you were quick to suppose
me. To the watch, I am your cousin, lodging with you on a visit to
Casale. Lest you should repudiate me, I mentioned the half-ducat as
a password."</p>
<p>"It was resourceful of you," Barbaresco grunted. "Who sent
you?"</p>
<p>"Lord! The unnecessary questions that you ask! Why, the Lady
Valeria, of course. Behold!" Under the eyes of Messer Barbaresco he
flashed the half of a broken ducat.</p>
<p>His lordship took the golden fragment and, holding it near the
candle-flame, read the half of the date inscribed upon it. When he
returned it to Bellarion he invited him at last to come above
stairs.</p>
<p>They went up, Barbaresco leading, to a long low-ceilinged
chamber of the mezzanine, the walls of which were hung with soiled
and shabby tapestries, the floor of which had been unswept for
weeks. His lordship lighted a cluster of candles in a leaden
candlebranch, and their golden light further revealed the bareness
of the place, its sparse and hardworn furnishings heavy with dust.
He drew an arm-chair to the table, where writing implements and
scattered papers made an untidy litter. He waved his guest to a
seat and asked his name.</p>
<p>"Bellarion."</p>
<p>"I never heard of the family."</p>
<p>"I never heard of it myself. But that's no matter. It's a name
that serves as well as another."</p>
<p>"Ah!" Barbaresco accepted the name as assumed. He brushed the
matter aside by a gesture. "Your message?"</p>
<p>"I bring no message. I come for one. Her highness is distracted
by the lack of news from you and by the fact that, although she has
waited daily for a fortnight, in all that time Messer Giuffredo has
not been near her."</p>
<p>Bellarion was still far from surmising who this Messer Giuffredo
might be, or what. But he knew that mention of the name must
confirm him in Barbaresco's eyes, and perhaps lead to a discovery
touching the identity of its owner. Because of the interest which
the tawny-headed, sombre-eyed princess inspired in him, Bellarion
was resolved to go beyond the precise extent of his mission as
defined by her.</p>
<p>"Giuffre took fright. A weak-stomached knave. He fancied himself
observed when last he came from the palace garden, and nothing
would induce him to go again."</p>
<p>So that whatever the intrigue, Bellarion now perceived it was
not amorous. Giuffredo clearly was a messenger and nothing more.
Barbaresco himself, with his corpulence and his fifty years or so,
was incredible as a lover.</p>
<p>"Could not another have been sent in his place?"</p>
<p>"A messenger, my friend, is not readily found. Besides, nothing
has transpired in the last two weeks of which it was urgently
necessary to inform her highness."</p>
<p>"Surely it was urgently necessary to inform her highness of just
that, so as to allay her natural anxiety?"</p>
<p>Leaning back in his chair, his plump hands, which were red like
all the rest of him that was visible, grasping the ends of its
arms, the gentleman of Casale pondered Bellarion gravely.</p>
<p>"You assume a deal of authority, young sir. Who and what are you
to be so deeply in the confidence of her highness?"</p>
<p>Bellarion was prepared for the question. "I am an amanuensis of
the palace, whose duties happen to have brought me closely into
touch with the Princess."</p>
<p>It was a bold lie, but one which he could support, at least, and
at need, by proofs of scholarliness.</p>
<p>Barbaresco nodded slowly.</p>
<p>"And your precise interest in her highness?"</p>
<p>Bellarion's smile was a little deprecating.</p>
<p>"Now, what would you suppose it?"</p>
<p>"I am not supposing. I am asking."</p>
<p>"Shall we say...the desire to serve her?" and Bellarion's smile
became at once vague and eloquent. This, taken in conjunction with
his reticence, might seem to imply a romantic attachment.
Barbaresco, however, translated it otherwise.</p>
<p>"You have ambitions! So! That is as it should be. Interest is
ever the best spur to endeavour."</p>
<p>And he, too, now smiled; a smile so oily and cynical that
Bellarion set him down at once for a man without ideals, and
mistrusted him from that moment. But he was strategist enough to
conceal it, even to reflect something of that same cynicism in his
own expression, so that Barbaresco, believing him a kindred spirit,
should expand the more freely. And meanwhile he drew a bow at a
venture.</p>
<p>"That which her highness looks to me to obtain is some
explanation of your...inaction."</p>
<p>He chose the most non-committal word; but it roused Lord
Barbaresco almost to anger.</p>
<p>"Inaction!" He choked, and his plethoric countenance deepened to
purple. To prove the injustice of the charge he urged his past
activities, of which he thus rendered an account.</p>
<p>Luring him thence by skilful question, assertion, and
contradiction along the apparent path of argument upon matters of
which he must assume the young man already fully informed,
gradually Bellarion drew from him a full disclosure of what was
afoot. He learnt also a good deal of history of which hitherto he
had been in ignorance, and he increased considerably his not very
elevating acquaintance with the ways of men. It was an evil enough
thing which the Princess Valeria set herself to combat with the
assistance of some dispossessed Guelphic gentlemen of Montferrat,
the chief of whom was this Lord Barbaresco; and it magnified her in
the eyes of Bellarion that she should evince the high courage
necessary for the combat.</p>
<p>The extensive and powerful state of Montferrat was ruled at this
time by the Marquis Theodore as regent during the minority of his
nephew Gian Giacomo, son of that great Ottone who had been slain in
the Neapolitan wars against the House of Brunswick.</p>
<p>These rulers of Montferrat, from Guglielmo the great Crusader
onwards, had ever been a warlike race, and Montferrat itself a
school of arms. Nor had their proud belligerent nature been diluted
by the blood of the Pateologi when, on the death without male issue
of Giovanni the Just a hundred years before these dominions had
passed to Theodore I., the younger son of Giovanni's sister
Violante, who was married to the Emperor of the East, Andronicus
Comnenus Patlaeologus.</p>
<p>The present Regent Theodore, however, combined with the
soldierly character proper to his house certain qualities of craft
and intrigue rarely found in knightly natures. The fact is, the
Marquis Theodore had been ill-schooled. He had been reared at the
splendid court of his cousin the Duke of Milan, that Gian Galeazzo
whom Francesco da Carrara had dubbed "the Great Viper", in allusion
as much to the man's nature as to the colubrine emblem of his
house. Theodore had observed and no doubt admired the subtle
methods by which Gian Galeazzo went to work against those whom he
would destroy. If he lacked the godlike power of rendering them
mad, at least he possessed the devilish craft of rendering them by
their own acts detestable, so that in the end it was their own kin
or their own subjects who pulled them down.</p>
<p>Witness the manner in which he had so poisoned the mind of
Alberto of Este as to goad him to the brutal murder of almost all
his relatives. It was his aim thus to render him odious to his
Ferrarese subjects that by his extinction Ferrara might ultimately
come under the crown of Milan. Witness how he forged love letters,
which he pretended had passed between the wife and the secretary of
his dear friend Francesco Gonzaga Lord of Mantua, whereby he
infuriated Gonzaga into murdering that innocent lady&mdash;who was
Galeazzo's own cousin and sister-in-law&mdash;and tearing the secretary
limb from limb upon the rack, so that Mantua rose against this
human wolf who governed there. Witness all those other Lombard
Princes whom by fraud and misrepresentation, ever in the guise of a
solicitous and loving friend, he lured into crimes which utterly
discredited them with their subjects. This was an easier and less
costly method of conquest than the equipping of great armies; and
also it was more effective, because an invader who imposes himself
by force can never hope to be so secure or esteemed as one whom the
people have invited to become their ruler.</p>
<p>All this the Marquis Theodore had observed and marked, and he
had seen Gian Galeazzo constantly widening his dominions by these
means, ever increasing in power and consequence, until in the end
he certainly would have made of all Northern Italy a kingdom for
his footstool had not the plague pursued him into the Castle of
Melegnano, where he had shut himself up to avoid it, and there
slain him in the year of grace 1402.</p>
<p>Trained in that school, the Marquis Theodore had observed and
understood many things that would have remained hidden from an
intelligence less acute.</p>
<p>He understood, for instance, that to rise by the pleasure of the
people is the only way of reaching stable eminence, and that to
accomplish this noble qualities must be exhibited. For whilst men
singly may be swayed by vicious appeals, collectively they will
respond only to appeals of virtue.</p>
<p>Upon this elementary truth, according to Barbaresco, the Marquis
Theodore was founding the dark policy which, from a mere temporary
regent during the minority of his nephew, should render him the
absolute sovereign of Montferrat. By the lavish display of public
and private virtues, by affability towards great and humble, by
endowments of beneficences by the careful tempering of justice with
mercy where this was publicly desired he was rendering himself
beloved and respected throughout the state. And step by step with
this he was secretly labouring to procure contempt for his nephew,
to whom, in the ordinary course of events, he would presently be
compelled to relinquish the reins of government.</p>
<p>Nature, unfortunately, had rendered the boy weak. It was a
weakness which training could mend as easily as increase. But to
increase it were directed all the efforts which Theodore took care
should be applied. Corsario the tutor, a Milanese, was a venal
scoundrel, unhealthily ambitious. He kept the boy ignorant of all
those arts that mature and grace the intellect, and confined
instruction to matters calculated to corrupt his mind, his nature,
and his morals. Castruccio Lord of Fenestrella, the boy's first
gentleman-in-waiting, was a vicious and depraved Savoyard, who had
gamed away his patrimony almost before he had entered upon the
enjoyment of it. It was easy to perceive the purpose for which the
Regent had made him the boy's constant and intimate companion.</p>
<p>Here Bellarion, with that assumption of knowledge which had
served to draw Barbaresco into explanations, ventured to interpose
a doubt. "In that matter I am persuaded that the Regent overreaches
himself. The people know that he permits Castruccio to remain; and
when they settle accounts with Castruccio they will also present a
reckoning to the Regent."</p>
<p>Barbaresco laughed the argument to scorn.</p>
<p>"Either you do not realize Theodore's cunning, or you are
insufficiently observant. Have not representations been made
already to the Regent that Castruccio is no fit companion for the
future Lord of Montferrat, or indeed for any boy? It merely enables
Messser Theodore to parade his own paternal virtues, his gentleness
of character the boy's wilfulness, and the fact that he is, after
all, no more than Regent of Montferrat. He would dismiss, he
protests, Messer Castruccio but the prince is so devoted and
attached to him that he would never be forgiven And, after all, is
that not true?"</p>
<p>"Ay, I suppose it is," Bellarion confessed.</p>
<p>Barbaresco was impatient of his dullness. "Of course it is. This
Castruccio has known how to conquer the boy's love and wonder by
pretended qualities that fire youth's imagination. The whole world
could hardly have yielded a better tool for the Regent or a worse
companion for the little prince."</p>
<p>Thus were the aims of the Marquis Theodore revealed to Bellarion
and the justifications for the movement that was afoot to thwart
him. Of this movement for the salvation of her brother the Princess
Valeria was the heart and Barbaresco the brain. Its object was to
overthrow the Marquis Theodore and place the government in the
hands of a council of regency during the remainder of Gian
Giacomo's minority. Of this council Barbaresco assumed that he
would be the president.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully Bellarion expressed a doubt of the future.</p>
<p>"The mischief is that the Marquis Theodore is already so well
established in the respect and affection of the people."</p>
<p>Barbaresco reared his head and threw out his chest. "Heaven will
befriend a cause so righteous."</p>
<p>"My doubt concerns not the supernatural, but the natural means
at our command."</p>
<p>It was a sobering reminder. Barbaresco left the transcendental
and attempted to be practical. Also, a subtle change was observable
in his manner. He was no longer glibly frank. He became reserved
and vague. They were going to work, he said, by laying bare the
Regent's true policy. Already they had at least a dozen nobles on
their side, and these were labouring to diffuse the truth. Once it
were sufficiently diffused the rest would follow as inevitably as
water runs downhill.</p>
<p>And this assurance was all the message that Bellarion was
invited to take back to the Princess. But Bellarion was determined
to probe deeper.</p>
<p>"That, sir, adds nothing to what the Lady Valeria already knows.
It cannot allay the anxiety in which she waits. She requires
something more definite."</p>
<p>Barbaresco was annoyed. Her highness should learn patience and
should learn to trust them. But Bellarion was so calmly insistent
that at last Barbaresco angrily promised to summon his chief
associates on the morrow, so that Bellarion might seek from them
the further details he desired on the Lady Valeria's behalf.</p>
<p>Content, Bellarion begged a bed for the night, and was conducted
to a mean, poverty-stricken chamber in that great empty house. On a
hard and unclean couch he lay pondering the sad story of a wicked
Regent, a foolish boy, and a great-hearted lady, who, too finely
reckless to count the cost of the ill-founded if noble enterprise
to which she gave her countenance, would probably end by destroying
herself together with her empty brother.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-07" id="ch-1-07"></a>CHAPTER VII. SERVICE</h2>
<p>Stimulated by the insistence of this apparently accredited and
energetic representative of the Princess, Messer Barbaresco
assembled in his house in the forenoon of the following day a
half-dozen gentlemen who were engaged with him upon that
crack-brained conspiracy against the Regent of Montferrat. Four of
these, including Count Enzo Spigno, were men who had been exiled
because of Guelphic profession, and who had returned by stealth by
Barbaresco's summons.</p>
<p>They talked a deal, as such folk will; but on the subject of
real means by which they hoped to prevail they were so vague that
Bellarion, boldly asserting himself, set about provoking
revelation. "Sirs, all this leads us nowhere. What, indeed, am I to
convey to her highness? Just that here in Casale at my Lord
Barbaresco's house some gentlemen of Montferrat hold assemblies to
discuss her brother's wrongs? Is that all?"</p>
<p>They gaped and frowned at him, and they exchanged dark glances
among themselves, as if each interrogated his neighbour. It was
Barbaresco at last who answered, and with some heat:</p>
<p>"You try my patience, sir. Did I not know you accredited by her
highness I would not brook these hectoring airs..."</p>
<p>"If I were not so accredited, there would be no airs to brook."
Thus he confirmed the impression of one deeper than they in the
confidence of the Lady Valeria.</p>
<p>"But this is a sudden impatience on the Lady Valeria's part!
said one.</p>
<p>"It is not the impatience that is sudden. But the expression of
it. I am telling you things that may not be written. Your last
messenger, Giuffredo was not sufficiently in her confidence. How
should she have opened her mind to him? Whilst you, sirs, are all
too cautious to approach her yourselves, lest in a subsequent
miscarriage of your aims there should be evidence to make you
suffer with her."</p>
<p>The first part of that assertion he had from themselves; the
second was an inference, boldly expressed to search their
intentions. And because not one of them denied it, he knew what to
think&mdash;knew that their aims amounted to more, indeed, than they
were pretending.</p>
<p>In silence they looked at him as he stood there in a shaft of
morning sunlight that had struggled through the curtain of dust and
grime on the blurred glass of the mullioned window. And then at
last Count Spigno, a lean, tough, swarthy gentleman, whose
expressions had already revealed him the bitterest enemy there of
the Marquis Theodore, loosed a short laugh.</p>
<p>"By the Host! He's in the right." He swung to Bellarion. "Sir,
we should deserve the scorn you do not attempt to dissemble if our
plans went no farther than&mdash;"</p>
<p>The voices of his fellow conspirators were raised in warning.
But he brushed them contemptuously aside, a bold, rash man.</p>
<p>"A choicely posted arbalister will&mdash;"</p>
<p>He got no further. This time his utterance was smothered by
their anger and alarm. Barbaresco and another laid rough hands upon
him, and through the general din rang the opprobrious epithets they
bestowed upon him, of which "fool" and "madman" were the least.
Amongst them they cowed him, and when it was done they turned again
to Bellarion who had not stirred from where he stood, maintaining a
frown of pretended perplexity between his level black brows.</p>
<p>It was Barbaresco, oily and crafty, who sought to dispel, to
deviate any assumption Bellarion might have formed.</p>
<p>"Do not heed his words, sir. He is for ever urging rash courses
upon us. He is too impatient. And impatience is a dangerous mood to
brine to such matters as these."</p>
<p>Bellarion was not deceived. They would have him believe that
Count Spigno had intended no more than to urge a course, whereas
what he perceived was that the Count had been about the disclose
the course already determined, and had disclosed enough to make a
guess of the remainder easy. No less did he perceive that to betray
his apprehension of this fact might be never to leave that house
alive. He could read it in their glances, as they waited to learn
how much he took for granted Therefore he used a deep
dissimulation. He shrugged ill-humouredly.</p>
<p>"Yet patience, sirs, can be exceeded until from a virtue it
becomes a vice. I have more respect for an advocate of rash
courses"&mdash;and he inclined his head slightly to Count Spigno&mdash;"than
for those who practise an excessive caution whilst time is slipping
by."</p>
<p>"That, sir," Barbaresco rebuked him, "is because you are young.
With age, if you are spared, you will come to know better."</p>
<p>"Meanwhile," said Bellarion completely to reassure them, "I see
plainly enough that your message to her highness is scarce worth
carrying." And he flung himself down into his chair with simulated
petulance.</p>
<p>The conference came to an end soon afterwards, and the
conspirators went their ways again singly. Shortly after the
departure of the last of them Bellarion took his own, promising
that he would return that night to Messer Barbaresco's house to
inform him of anything her highness might desire him to convey. One
last question he asked his host at parting.</p>
<p>"The pavilion in the palace gardens is being painted. Can you
say by whom?"</p>
<p>Barbaresco's eyes showed that he found the question odd. But he
answered that most probably one Gobbo, whose shop was in the Via
del Cane, would be entrusted with the work.</p>
<p>Into that shop of Gobbo's, found by inquiry, Bellarion
penetrated an hour later. Old Gobbo himself, amid the untidy litter
of the place, was engaged in painting an outrageous scarlet angel
against a star-flecked background of cobalt blue. Bellarion's first
question ascertained that the painting of the pavilion was indeed
in Gobbo's hands.</p>
<p>"My two lads are engaged upon it now, my lord."</p>
<p>Bellarion winced at the distinguished form of address, which
took him by surprise until he remembered his scarlet suit with its
imposing girdle and gold-hilted dagger.</p>
<p>"The work progresses all too slowly," said he sharply.</p>
<p>"My lord! My lord!" The old man was flung into agitation. "It is
a beautiful fresco, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"They require assistance, those lads of yours."</p>
<p>"Assistance!" The old man flung his arms to heaven. "Where shall
I find assistants with the skill?"</p>
<p>"Here," said Bellarion, and tapped his breast with his
forefinger.</p>
<p>Amazed, Gobbo considered his visitor more searchingly. Bellarion
leaned nearer and lowered his voice to a tone of confidence.</p>
<p>"I'll be frank with you, Ser Gobbo. There is a lady of the
palace, a lady of her highness..." He completed his sentence by
roguishly closing an eye.</p>
<p>Gobbo's lean brown old face cracked across in a smile, as
becomes an old artist who finds himself face to face with
romance.</p>
<p>"You understand, I see," said Bellarion, smiling in his turn.
"It is important that I should have a word with this lady. There
are grave matters...I'll not weary you with these and my own sad
story. Perform a charitable act to your own profit."</p>
<p>But Gobbo's face had grown serious. "If it were discovered..."
he was beginning.</p>
<p>"It shall not be. That I promise you full confidently. And to
compensate you...five ducats."</p>
<p>"Five ducats!" It was a great sum, and confirmed Master Gobbo in
the impression made by Bellarion's appearance, dress, and manner
that here he dealt with a great lord. "For five ducats&mdash;" He broke
off, and scratched his head.</p>
<p>Bellarion perceived that he must not be given time for
thought.</p>
<p>"Come my friend, lend me the clothes for the part and a smock
such as is proper and do you keep these garments of mine in pledge
for my safe return and for the five ducats that shall then be
yours."</p>
<p>He knew how to be irresistible, and he was fortunate in his
present victim. He went off a half-hour or so later in the garb of
his suddenly assumed profession and bearing a note from Gobbo to
his sons.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon Bellarion lounged in the pavilion in the
palace garden to which his pretence had gained him easy admission.
He mixed some colours for the two young artists under their
direction. But beyond that he did nothing save wait for sunset,
when the light would fail and the two depart. Himself, though not
without the exertion of considerable persuasions based upon a
display of his amorous intentions, he remained behind to clear
things up.</p>
<p>Thus it happened that as the Lady Dionara was walking by the
lake she heard herself addressed from the bridge that led to the
pavilion.</p>
<p>"Madonna! Gracious Madonna!"</p>
<p>She turned to behold a tall young man with tumbled black hair
and a smear of paint across his face, in a smock that was daubed
with every colour of the rainbow, waving a long-handled brush in a
gesture towards the temple.</p>
<p>"Would not her highness," he was asking, "graciously condescend
to view the progress of the frescoes?"</p>
<p>The Lady Dionara looked down her nose at this greatly
presumptuous fellow until he added softly: "And receive news at the
same time of the young man she befriended yesterday?"</p>
<p>That changed her expression so swift and ludicrously that
Bellarion was moved to silent laughter.</p>
<p>To view those frescoes came the Lady Valeria alone, leaving
Madonna Dionara to loiter on the bridge. Within the temple her
highness found the bedaubed young painter dangling his legs from a
scaffold and flourishing a brush in one hand, a mahlstick in the
other. She looked at him in waiting silence. He did not try her
patience.</p>
<p>"Madonna, you do not recognize me." With the sleeve of his smock
he wiped the daub of paint from across his features. But already
his voice had made him known.</p>
<p>"Messer Bellarion! Is it yourself?"</p>
<p>"Myself." He came to the ground. "To command."</p>
<p>"But...why this? Why thus?" Her eyes were wide: she was a little
breathless.</p>
<p>"I have had a busy day, Madonna, and a busy night, and I have
more to report than may hurriedly be muttered behind a hedge."</p>
<p>"You bring messages?"</p>
<p>"The message amounts to nothing. It is only to say that Messer
Giuffredo, fancying himself followed and watched on the last
occasion, is not to be induced to come again. And in the meanwhile
nothing has happened of which it was worth while to inform you.
Messer Barbaresco desires me further to say that everything
progresses satisfactorily, which I interpret to mean that no
progress whatever is being made."</p>
<p>"You interpret&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And I venture to add, having been entertained at length not
only by Messer Barbaresco, but also by the other out-at-elbow
nobles in this foolish venture, that it never will progress in the
sense you wish, nor to any end but disaster."</p>
<p>He saw the scarlet flame of indignation overspread her face, he
saw the anger kindle in her great dark eyes, and he waited calmly
for the explosion. But the Lady Valeria was not explosive. Her
rebuke was cold.</p>
<p>"Sir, you presume upon a messenger's office. You meddle in
affairs that are not your concern."</p>
<p>"Do you thank God for it," said Bellarion, unabashed. "It is
time someone gave these things their proper names so as to remove
all misconception. Do you know whither Barbaresco and these other
fools are thrusting you, Madonna? Straight into the hands of the
strangler."</p>
<p>Having conquered her anger once she was not easily to be
betrayed into it again.</p>
<p>"If that is all you have to tell me, sir, I will leave you. I
will not stay to hear my friends and peers maligned by a base knave
to whom I speak by merest accident."</p>
<p>"Not accident, Madonna." His tone was impressive. "A base knave
I may be. But base by birth alone. These others whom you trust and
call your peers are base by nature. Ah, wait! It was no accident
that brought me," he cried, and this with a sincerity from which
none could have suspected the violence he did to his beliefs. "Ask
yourself why I should come again to do more than is required of me,
at some risk to myself? What are your affairs, or the affairs of
the State of Montferrat to me? You know what I am and what my aims.
Why, then, should I tarry here? Because I cannot help myself.
Because the will of Heaven has imposed itself upon me."</p>
<p>His great earnestness, his very vehemence, which seemed to
invest his simple utterances with a tone of inspiration, impressed
her despite herself, as he intended that they should. Nor did she
deceive him when she dissembled this in light derision.</p>
<p>"An archangel in a painter's smock!"</p>
<p>"By Saint Hilary, that is nearer the truth than you suppose
it."</p>
<p>She smiled, yet not entirely without sourness. "You do not lack
a good opinion of yourself."</p>
<p>"You may come to share it when I've said all that's in my mind.
I have told you, Madonna, whither these crack-brained adventurers
are thrusting you so that they may advance themselves. Do you know
the true import of the conspiracy? Do you know what they plan,
these fools? The murder of the Marquis Theodore."</p>
<p>She stared at him round-eyed, afraid. "Murder?" she said in a
voice of horror.</p>
<p>He smiled darkly. "They had not told you, eh? I knew they dared
not. Yet so indiscreet and rash are they that they betrayed it to
me&mdash;to me of whom they know nothing save that I carried as an
earnest of my good faith your broken half-ducat. What if I were
just a scoundrel who would sell a piece of information for which
the Marquis Theodore would no doubt pay handsomely? Do you still
think that it was accident brought me to interfere in your
concerns?"</p>
<p>"I can't believe you! I can't!" And again she breathed aghast
that horrid word: "Murder!"</p>
<p>"If they succeeded," said Bellarion, coldly, "all would be well.
Your uncle would have no more than his deserts, and you and your
brother would be rid of an evil incubus. The notion does not shock
me at all. What shocks me is that I see no chance of success for a
plot conducted by such men with such inadequate resources. By
joining them you can but advance the Regent's aims, which you
believe to be the destruction of your brother. Let the attempt be
made, and fail, or even let evidence be forthcoming of the
conspiracy's existence and true purpose, and your brother is at the
Regent's mercy. The people themselves might demand his outlawry or
even his death for an attempt upon the life of a Prince who has
known how to make himself beloved."</p>
<p>"But my brother is not in this," she protested. "He knows
nothing of it."</p>
<p>Bellarion smiled compassionately. "Cui bono fuerit? That is the
first question which the law will ask. Be warned, Madonna!
Dissociate yourself from these men while it is time or you may
enable the Regent at a single stride to reach his ultimate
ambition."</p>
<p>The pallor of her face, the heave of her breast were witnesses
to her agitation. "You would frighten me if I did not know how
false is your main assumption: that they plot murder. They would
never dare to do this thing without my sanction, and this they have
never sought."</p>
<p>"Because they intend to confront you with an accomplished fact.
Oh, you may believe me, Madonna. In the last twenty-four hours, and
chiefly from these men, I have learnt much of the history of
Montferrat. And I have learnt a deal of their own histories, too.
There is not one amongst them who is not reduced in circumstances,
whose state has not been diminished by lack of fortune or lack of
worth."</p>
<p>But for this she had an answer, and she delivered it with a
slow, wistful smile.</p>
<p>"You talk, sir, as if you contained all knowledge, and yet you
have not learnt that the fortunate desire no change, but labour to
uphold the state whence their prosperity is derived. Is it
surprising, then, that I depend upon the unfortunate?"</p>
<p>"Say also the venal, the greedy of power and of possessions,
whose only spur is interest; desperate gamblers who set their heads
upon the board and your own and your brother's head with theirs.
Almost they divided among themselves in their talk the officers of
State. Barbaresco promised to me that the ambition he perceived in
me should be fully gratified. He assumed that I, too, had no aim
but self-aggrandizement, simply because he could assume no other
reason why a man should expose himself to risks. That told me all
of him that I require to know."</p>
<p>"Barbaresco is poor," she answered. "He has suffered wrongs.
Once, in my father's time, he was almost the greatest man in the
State. My uncle has stripped him of his honours and almost of his
possessions."</p>
<p>"That is the best thing I have heard of the Marquis Theodore
yet."</p>
<p>She did not heed him, but went on: "Can I desert him now? Can
I..." She checked and stiffened, seeming to grow taller. "What am I
saying? What am I thinking?" She laughed, and there was scorn of
self in her laugh. "What arts do you employ, you an unknown man, a
self-confessed starveling student, base and nameless, that upon no
better warrant than your word I should even ask such a
question?"</p>
<p>"What arts?" said he, and smiled in his turn, though without
scorn. "The art of pure reason based on truth. It is not to be
resisted."</p>
<p>"Not if based on truth. But yours is based on prejudice."</p>
<p>"Is it prejudice that they are plotting murder?"</p>
<p>"They have been misled by their devotion..."</p>
<p>"By their cupidity, Madonna."</p>
<p>"I will not suffer you to say that." Anger flared up again in
her, loyal anger on behalf of those she deemed her only friends in
her great need. She checked it instantly. "Sir, I perceive your
interest, and am grateful. If you would still do me a service, go
tell Messer Barbaresco from me that this plot of assassination must
go no further. Impose it upon him as my absolute command. Tell him
that I must be obeyed and that rather than be a party to such an
act I would disclose the intention to the Marquis Theodore."</p>
<p>"That is something, Madonna. But if when you have slept upon
it&mdash;"</p>
<p>She interrupted him. "Upon whatever course I may determine I
shall find means to convey the same to my Lord Barbaresco. There
will not be the need to trouble you again. For what you have done,
sir, I shall remain grateful. So go with God, Messer
Bellarion."</p>
<p>"It is a little personal matter this. I am in need of five
ducats."</p>
<p>He saw the momentary frown, chased away by the beginnings of a
smile.</p>
<p>"You are consistent in that you misunderstand me, though I have
once reminded you that if I needed money for myself I could sell my
information to the Regent. The five ducats are for Gobbo, who lent
me this smock and these tools of my pretended trade." And he told
her the exact circumstances.</p>
<p>She considered him more gently. "You do not lack resource,
sir?"</p>
<p>"It goes with intelligence, Madonna," he reminded her as an
argument in favour of what he said. But she ignored it.</p>
<p>"And I am sorry that I...You shall have ten ducats unless your
pride is above..."</p>
<p>"Do you see pride in me?"</p>
<p>She looked him over with a certain haughty amusement. "A
monstrous pride, an overweening vanity in your acuteness."</p>
<p>"I'll take ten ducats to convince you of my humility. I may yet
need the other five in the service of your highness."</p>
<p>"That service, sir, is at an end, or will be when you have
conveyed my message to the Lord Barbaresco."</p>
<p>Bellarion accepted his dismissal in the settled conviction that
her highness was mistaken and would presently be glad to admit
it.</p>
<p>She was right, you see, touching that vanity of his.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-08" id="ch-1-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII. STALEMATE</h2>
<p>Bellarion and Barbaresco sat at supper, waited upon by an untidy
and unclean old man who afforded all the service of that decayed
establishment. The fare was frugal; more frugal far than the
Convent of Cigliano had afforded out of Lent; and the wine was thin
and sharp.</p>
<p>When the repast was done, and the old servant, having lighted
candles, had retired Bellarion startled his host by the portentous
gravity of his tone.</p>
<p>"My lord you and I must talk. I told you that her highness sends
no answer to your message, which is the truth, and all that you
could expect since there was no message and consequently could be
no answer. I did not tell you, however, that she sends you a
message which is in some sense an answer to certain suspicions that
I voiced to her."</p>
<p>Barbaresco's mouth fell open, and the stare of his blue eyes
grew fixed. Clearly he was startled, and clearly paused to command
himself before asking:</p>
<p>"Why did you not tell me this before?"</p>
<p>"I preferred to wait so as to make sure of not going supperless.
It may of course, offend you that I should have communicated my
suspicions to her highness. But the poor lady was so downcast by
your inaction that to cheer her I ventured to express the opinion
that you are perhaps not quite so aimless as you wish to
appear."</p>
<p>Whatever his convent education may have done for him, it does
not seem&mdash;as you will long since have gathered&mdash;that it had
inculcated a strict regard for exactitude. Dissimulation, I fear,
was bred in the bones of him, although he would have answered any
such charge by informing you that Plato had taught him to
distinguish between the lie on the lips and the lie in the
heart.</p>
<p>"Oh, but proceed! The opinion?" Barbaresco fiercely challenged
him.</p>
<p>"You'll remember what Count Spigno said before you others
checked him. The arbalister...You remember." Bellarion appeared to
falter a little under the glare of those blue eyes and the fierce
set of that heavy jaw. "So I told her highness, to raise her
drooping spirits, that one of these fine days her friends in Casale
might cut the Gordian knot with a cross-bow shaft!"</p>
<p>Barbaresco suggested by his attitude a mastiff crouching for a
spring.</p>
<p>"Ah!" he commented. "And she said?"</p>
<p>"The very contrary of what I expected. Where I looked for
elation I found only distress. It was in vain I pleaded with her
that thus a consummation would speedily be reached, that if such a
course had not yet been determined, it was precisely the course
that I should advocate."</p>
<p>"Oh! You pleaded that! And she?"</p>
<p>"She bade me tell you that if such a thing were indeed in your
minds you must dismiss it. That she would be no party to it. That
sooner she would denounce the intention to the Marquis
Theodore."</p>
<p>"Body of God!" Barbaresco came to his feet, his great face
purple, the veins of his temple standing forth like cords.</p>
<p>Whilst appearing unmoved, Bellarion braced his muscles for
action. The attack came. But only in words. Barbaresco heaped
horrible and obscene abuse upon Bellarion's head. "You infamous
fool! You triple ass! You chattering ape!" With these amongst other
terms, the young man found himself bombarded. "Get you back to her
and tell her, you numskulled baboon, that there was never any such
intention."</p>
<p>"But was there not?" Bellarion cried with almost shrill
ingenuousness of tone. "Yet Count Spigno&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Devil take Count Spigno, fool. Heed me. Carry my message to her
highness."</p>
<p>"I carry no lies," said Bellarion firmly, and rose with great
dignity.</p>
<p>"Lies!" gurgled Barbaresco.</p>
<p>"Lies," Bellarion insisted. "Let us have done with them. To her
highness I expressed as a suspicion what in my mind was a clear
conviction. The words Count Spigno used, and your anxiety to
silence him, could leave no doubt in the mind of any man of
wit&mdash;and I am that, I hope, my lord. If you will have this message
carried, you will first show me the ends you serve by its
falsehood, and let me, who am in this thing as deep as any, be the
judge of whether it is justified."</p>
<p>Before this firmness the wrath went out of Barbaresco. Weakly he
wrung his hands a moment, then sank sagging into his chair.</p>
<p>"If the others, if Cavalcanti or Casella, had known how much you
had understood, you would never have left this house alive, lest
you should do precisely what you have done."</p>
<p>"But if it is on her behalf&mdash;hers and her brother's&mdash;that you
plan this thing, why should you not take her feeling first? What
else is right or fair?"</p>
<p>"Her feeling?" Barbaresco sneered, and Bellarion understood that
the sneer was for himself. "God deliver me from the weariness of
reasoning with a fool. Our bolt would have been shot, and none
could have guessed the hands that loosed it. Now you have made it
known, and you need to be told what will happen if we were mad
enough to go through with it. Why, the Princess Valeria would be
our instant accuser. She would come forth at once and denounce us.
That is the spirit of her&mdash;wilful, headstrong, and mawkish. And I
am a fool to bid you go back to her and persuade her that you were
mistaken. When the blow fell she would see that what you had first
told her was the truth, and our heads would pay."</p>
<p>He set his elbows on the table, took his head in his hands, and
fetched a groan from his great bulk. "The ruin you have wrought!
God! The ruin!"</p>
<p>"Ruin?" quoth Bellarion.</p>
<p>"Of all our hopes," Barbaresco explained in petulance. "Can't
you see it? Can you understand nothing for yourself, animal, save
the things you were better for not understanding? And can't you see
that you have ruined yourself with us? With your face and shape and
already close in the Lady Valeria's confidence as you are, there
are no heights in the State to which you might not have
climbed."</p>
<p>"I had not thought of it," said Bellarion, sighing.</p>
<p>"No, nor of me, nor of any of us. Of me!" The man's grief became
passionate. "At last I might have sloughed this beggary in which I
live. And now..." He banged the table in his sudden rage and got to
his feet again. "That is what you have done. That is what you have
wrecked by your silly babbling."</p>
<p>"But surely, sir, by other means&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There are no other means. Leastways, no other means at our
command. Have we the money to levy troops? Oh, why do I waste my
breath upon you? You'll tell the others tomorrow what you've done
and they shall tell you what they think of it."</p>
<p>It was a course that had its perils. But if once in the
stillness of the night Bellarion's shrewd wits counselled him to
rise, dress, and begone, he stilled the coward counsel. It remained
to be seen whether the other conspirators would be as easily
intimidated as Barbarcsco. To ascertain this Bellarion determined
to remain. The Lady Valeria's need of him was not yet done, he
thought, though why the Lady Valeria's affairs should be the cause
of his exposing himself to the chances of a blade between the ribs
was perhaps more than he could satisfactorily have explained.</p>
<p>That the danger was very far from imaginary the next morning's
conference showed him. Scarcely had the plotters realized the
nature of Bellarion's activities than they were clamouring for his
blood. Casella, the exile, breathing fire and slaughter, would have
sprung upon him with dagger drawn had not Barbaresco bodily
interposed.</p>
<p>"Not in my house!" he roared. "Not in my house!" His only
concern being the matter of his own incrimination.</p>
<p>"Nor anywhere, unless you are bent on suicide," Bellarion calmly
warned them. He moved from behind Barbaresco to confront them. "You
are forgetting that in my murder the Lady Valeria will see your
answer. She will denounce you, sirs, not only for this, but for the
intended murder of the Regent. Slay me, and you just as surely slay
yourselves." He permitted himself to smile as he looked upon their
stricken faces. "It's an interesting situation known in chess as a
stalemate."</p>
<p>In their baffled fury they turned upon Count Spigno, whose
indiscretion had created this situation. Enzo Spigno, sitting there
with a sneer on his white face, let the storm rage. When at last it
abated, he expressed himself.</p>
<p>"Rather should you thank me for having tested the ground before
we stand on it. For the rest, it is as I expected. It is an ill
thing to be associated with a woman in these matters."</p>
<p>"We did not bring her in," said Barbaresco. "It was she who
appealed to me for assistance."</p>
<p>"And now that we are ready to afford it her," said Casella, "she
discovers that it is not of the sort she wishes. I say it is not
hers to choose. Hopes have been raised in us, and we have laboured
to fulfil them."</p>
<p>How they all harped on that, thought Bellarion. How concerned
each was with the profit that he hoped to wrest for himself, how
enraged to see himself cheated of this profit. The Lady Valeria,
the State, the boy who was being corrupted that he might be
destroyed&mdash;these things were nothing to these men. Not once did he
hear them mentioned now in the futile, disorderly debate that
followed whilst he sat a little apart and almost forgotten.</p>
<p>At last it was Spigno&mdash;this Spigno whom they dubbed a fool, but
who, alter all, had more wit than all of them together&mdash;who
discovered and made the counter-move.</p>
<p>"You, there, Master Bellarion!" he called. "Here is what you are
to tell your lady in answer to her threat: We who have set our
hands to this task of ridding the State of the Regent's thraldom,
will not draw back. We go forward with this thing as seems best to
us, and we are not to be daunted by threats. Make it clear to this
arrogant lady that she cannot betray us without at the same time
betraying herself; that whatever fate she invoked upon us will
certainly overtake her as well."</p>
<p>"It may be that she has already perceived and weighed that
danger," said Bellarion.</p>
<p>"Ay, as a danger; but certainly not as a certainty. And tell her
also that she as certainly dooms her brother. Make her understand
that it is not so easy to play with the souls of men as she
supposes, and that here she has evoked forces which it is not
within her power to lay again." He turned to his associates. "Be
sure that when she perceives precisely where she stands she will
cease from troubling us with her qualms either now or when the
thing is done."</p>
<p>Bellarion had mockingly pronounced the situation interesting
when by a shrewd presentment of it he had given pause to the
murderous rage of the conspirators. Considering it later that day
as he took the air along the river brink, he was forced to confess
it more disturbingly interesting even than he had shown it to
be.</p>
<p>He had not been blind to that weakness in the Lady Valeria's
position. But he had been foolishly complacent, like the skilfull
chess-player who, perceiving a strong move possible to his
opponent, takes it for granted that the opponent will not himself
perceive it.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that nothing remained but to resume his
interrupted pilgrimage to Pavia, leaving the State of Montferrat
and the Lady Valeria to settle their own affairs. But in that case
her own ruin must inevitably follow, precipitated by the action of
those ruffians with whom she was allied, whether that action
succeeded or failed.</p>
<p>Then he asked himself what to him were the affairs of Montferrat
and its princess that he should risk his life upon them.</p>
<p>He fetched a sigh. The abbot had been right. There is no peace
in this world outside a convent wall. Certainly there was no peace
in Montferrat. Let him shake the dust of that place of unrest from
his feet and push on towards Pavia and the study of Greek.</p>
<p>And so by olive grove and vineyard he wandered on, assuring
himself that it was towards Pavia that he now went, and repeating
to himself that he would reach the Sesia before nightfall, and seek
shelter in some hamlet thereabouts.</p>
<p>Yet dusk saw him re-entering Casale by the Lombard Gate, which
faces eastwards. And this because he realized that the service he
had shouldered was a burden not so lightly to be cast aside: if he
forsook her now, the vision of her tawny head and wistful eyes
would go with him to distract him with reproach.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-09" id="ch-1-09"></a>CHAPTER IX. THE MARQUIS
THEODORE</h2>
<p>The High and Mighty Marquis Theodore Palaeologo, Regent of
Montferrat, gave audience, as was his gracious custom, each
Saturday to all who sought it, and received petitions from all who
proffered them.</p>
<p>A fine man, this Marquis Theodore, standing fully six feet tall,
of a good shape and soldierly carriage, despite his fifty years.
His countenance was amiable and open, with boldly chiselled
features and healthily tanned.</p>
<p>Affable of manner, accessible of person, he nowise suggested the
schemer The privilege of audience which he granted so freely was
never abused so that on the Saturday of this week with which we are
dealing the attendance in the audience chamber was, as usual, of
modest proportions. His highness came, attended by his chancellor
and his captain of justice, and followed by two secretaries; he
made a leisurely progress through the chamber, pausing at every
other step to receive this one, or to say a word to that one; and
at the end of an hour departed again, one of his secretaries
bearing away the single petition that had been proffered, and this
by a tall dark-haired young man who was vividly dressed in
scarlet.</p>
<p>Within five minutes of the Regent's withdrawal, that same
secretary returned in quest of the tall young man.</p>
<p>"Are you named Cane, sir?"</p>
<p>The tall young man bowed acknowledgment, and was ushered into a
small pleasant chamber whose windows overlooked the gardens, with
which Bellarion had already made acquaintance. The secretary closed
the door, and Bellarion found himself under the scrutiny of a pair
of close-set pale eyes whose glance was crafty and penetrating.
Cross-legged, his parti-coloured hose revealed by the fall of the
rich gown of mulberry velvet, the Regent sat in a high-backed chair
of leather wrought with stags' heads in red and gold, his left
elbow resting upon a carved writing-pulpit.</p>
<p>Between hands that were long and fine he held a parchment
cylinder, in which Bellarion recognized the pretended petition he
had proffered.</p>
<p>"Who are you, sir?" The voice was calm and level; the voice of a
man who does not permit his accents to advertise his thoughts.</p>
<p>"My name is Bellarion Cane. I am the adoptive son of Bonifacio
Cane, Count of Biandrate."</p>
<p>Since he had found it necessary for his present purposes to
adopt a father, Bellarion had thought it best to adopt one whose
name must carry weight and at need afford protection. Therefore he
had conferred this honour of paternity upon that great soldier,
Facino Cane, who was ducal governor of Milan.</p>
<p>There was a flash of surprise from the eyes that conned him.</p>
<p>"You are Facino's son! You come from Milan, then?"</p>
<p>"No, my lord. From the Augustinian Convent at Cigliano, where my
adoptive father left me some years ago, whilst he was still in the
service of Montferrat. It was hoped that I might take the habit.
But a restlessness of spirit has urged me to prefer the world."
Thus he married pure truth to the single falsehood he had used, the
extent of which was to clothe the obscure soldier who had
befriended him with the identity of the famous soldier he had
named.</p>
<p>"But why the world of Montferrat?"</p>
<p>"Chance determined that. I bore letters from my abbot to help me
on my way. It was thus I made the acquaintance of the Lord
Barbaresco; and his lordship becoming interested in me, and no
doubt requiring me for certain services, desired me to remain. He
urged that here was a path already open to my ambition which if
steadily pursued might lead to eminence."</p>
<p>There was no falsehood in the statement. It was merely truth
untruly told&mdash;truth unassailable under test, yet calculated to
convey a false impression.</p>
<p>A thin smile parted the Prince's shaven lips. "And when you had
learnt sufficient, you found that a surer path to advancement might
lie in the betrayal of these poor conspirators?"</p>
<p>"That, highness, is to set the unworthiest interpretation upon
my motives." Bellarion made a certain show in his tone and manner
of offended dignity, such as might become the venal rascal he
desired to be considered.</p>
<p>"You will not dispute that the course you have taken argues more
intelligence than honesty or loyalty."</p>
<p>"Your highness reproaches me with lack of loyalty to
traitors?"</p>
<p>"What was their treason to you? What loyalty do you owe to me?
You have but looked to see where lies your profit. Well, well, you
are worthy to be the son, adoptive or natural, of that rascal
Facino. You follow closely in his footsteps, and if you survive the
perils of the journey you may go as far."</p>
<p>"Highness! I came to serve you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Silence!" The pleasant voice was scarcely raised. "I am
speaking. I understand your service perfectly. I know something of
men, and if I choose to use you, it is because your hope of profit
may keep you loyal to me and because I shall know how to detect
disloyalty and how to punish it. You engage, sir, in a service full
of perils." The Regent seemed faintly to sneer. "But you have
thrust yourself willingly into it. It will test you sternly and at
every step. If you survive the tests, if you conquer the natural
baseness and dishonesty of your nature, you shall have no cause to
complain of my generosity."</p>
<p>Bellarion flushed despite himself under the cold contempt of
that level voice and the amused contempt of those calm pale
eyes.</p>
<p>"The quality of my service should lead your highness to amend
your judgment."</p>
<p>"Is it at fault? Will you tell me, then, whence springs the
regard out of which you betray to me the aims and names of these
men who have befriended you?"</p>
<p>Bellarion threw back his head, and in his bold dark eyes was
kindled a flame of indignation. Inwardly he was a little uneasy to
find the Regent accepting his word so readily and upon such slight
examination.</p>
<p>"Your highness," he choked, "will give me leave to go."</p>
<p>But his highness smiled, savouring his power to torture souls
where lesser tyrants could torture only bodies.</p>
<p>"When I have done with you. You came at your own pleasure. You
abide at mine. Now tell me, sir: Besides the names you have here
set down of these men who seek my life, do you know of any others
who work in concert with them?"</p>
<p>"I know that there are others whom they are labouring to seduce.
Who these others are I cannot say, nor, with submission, need it
matter to your highness. These are the leaders. Once these are
crushed the others will be without direction."</p>
<p>"A seven-headed hydra, of which these are the heads. If I lop
off these heads..." He paused. "Yes, yes...But have you heard none
others named in these councils?" He leaned forward a little, his
eyes intent upon Bellarion's face. "None who are nearer to me?
Think well, Master Bellarion, and be not afraid to name names,
however great." Bellarion perceived here, almost by instinct, the
peril of excessive reticence.</p>
<p>"Since they profess to labour on behalf of the Marquis Gian
Giacomo, it is natural they should name him. But I have never heard
it asserted that he has knowledge of their plot."</p>
<p>"Nor any other?" The Marquis was singularly insistent. "Nor any
other?"</p>
<p>Bellarion showed a blank face. "Why? What other?"</p>
<p>"Nay, sir. I am asking you."</p>
<p>"No, highness," he answered slowly, a man perplexed. "I recall
the mention of no other."</p>
<p>The Prince sank back into his chair, his searching eyes never
quitting the other's face. Then he committed what in a man so
subtle was a monstrous indiscretion, giving Bellarion the
explanation that he lacked.</p>
<p>"You are not deep enough in their confidence yet. Return to
their councils and keep me informed of all that transpires in them.
Be diligent, and you shall find me generous."</p>
<p>Bellarion was genuinely aghast. "Your highness will delay to
strike, when by delay you may imperil...?"</p>
<p>He was sternly silenced. "Is your counsel sought? You understand
what I require of you. You have leave to go."</p>
<p>"But, highness! To return amongst them now, after openly coming
here to you, will not be without its danger."</p>
<p>The Regent did not share his alarm. He smiled again.</p>
<p>"You have chosen a path of peril, as I told you. But I will help
you. I discover that I have letters from Facino humbly soliciting
my protection for his adoptive son whilst in Casale. It is a
position I cannot disregard. Facino is a great lord in Milan these
days. My court shall be advised of it, and it will not be
considered strange that I make you free of the palace. You will
persuade your confederates that you avail yourself of my
hospitality so that you may abuse it in their interests. That
should satisfy them, and I shall look to see you here this evening.
Now go with God."</p>
<p>Bellarion stumbled out distracted. Nothing had gone as he
intended after that too promising beginning. Perhaps had he not
disclosed himself as Facino Cane's adoptive son, he would not have
supplied the Regent with a pretence that should render plausible
his comings and goings. But the necessity for that disclosure was
undeniable. His conduct had been dictated by the conviction that he
could do for the Lady Valeria what she could not without
self-betrayal do for herself. Confidently he had counted upon
instant action of the Regent's to crush the conspirators, and so
make the Princess safe from the net in which their crazy ambitions
would entangle her. Instead, he had made the discovery&mdash;from the
single indiscretion of the Regent&mdash;that the Marquis Theodore was
already fully aware of the existence of the conspiracy and of the
identity of some, if not all, of the chief conspirators. That was
why he had so readily accepted Bellarion's tale. The disclosure
agreed so completely with the Regent's knowledge that he had no
cause to doubt Bellarion's veracity. And finding him true in these
most intimate details, he readily believed true the rest of his
story and the specious account of his own intervention in the
affair. Possibly Bellarion's name was already known to him as that
of one of the plotters who met at Barbaresco's house.</p>
<p>Far, then, from achieving his real purpose, all that Bellarion
had accomplished was to offer, himself as another and apparently
singularly apt instrument for the Regent's dark purposes.</p>
<p>It was a perturbed Bellarion, a Bellarion who perceived in what
dangerous waters he was swimming, who came back that noontide to
Barbaresco's house.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-10" id="ch-1-10"></a>CHAPTER X. THE WARNING</h2>
<p>They were very gay that night at the hospitable court of the
Marquis Theodore. A comedy was performed early in the evening, a
comedy which Fra Serafino in his chronicle describes as lascivious,
by which he may mean no more than playful. Thereafter, there was
some dancing in the long hall, of which the Regent himself set the
example, leading forth the ugly but graceful young Princess of
Morea.</p>
<p>His nephew, the Marquis Gian Giacomo, followed with the Countess
of Ronsecco, who would have declined the honour if she had dared,
for the boy's cheeks were flushed, his eyes glazed, his step
uncertain and his speech noisy and incoherent. And there were few
who smiled as they observed the drunken antics of their future
prince. Once, indeed, the Regent paused, grave and concerned of
countenance, to whisper an admonition. The boy answered him with a
bray of insolent laughter and flung away, dragging the pretty
countess with him. It was plain to all that the gentle, knightly
Regent found it beyond his power to control his unruly, degenerate
nephew.</p>
<p>Amongst the few who dared to smile was Messer Castruccio da
Fenestrella, radiant in a suit of cloth of gold, who stood watching
the mischief he had made. For it was he who had first secretly
challenged Gian Giacomo to a drinking bout during supper, and
afterwards urged him to dance with the pretty wife of stiff-necked
Ronsecco.</p>
<p>Awhile he stood looking on. Then, wearying of the entertainment,
he sauntered off to join a group apart, of which the Lady Valeria
was the centre. Her ladies, Dionara and Isotta, were with her, the
pedant Corsario, looking even less pedantic than his habit, and a
half-dozen gallants who among them made all the chatter. Her
highness was pale, and there was a frown between her eyes that so
wistfully followed her unseemly brother, inattentive of those about
her, some of whom from the kindliest motives sought to distract her
attention. Her cheeks warmed a little at the approach of
Castruccio, who moved into the group with easy, insolent grace.</p>
<p>"My lord is gay tonight," he informed them lightly. None
answered him. He looked at them with his flickering shifty eyes, a
sneering smile on his lips. "So are not you," he informed them.
"You need enlivening." He thrust forward to the Princess, and
bowed. "Will your highness dance?"</p>
<p>She did not look at him. Her eyes were fixed, and their glance
went beyond him and was of such intensity that Messer Castruccio
turned to seek the object of that curious contemplation.</p>
<p>Down the hall came striding Messer Aliprandi, the Orator of
Milan, and with him a tall, black-haired young man, in a suit of
red that was more conspicuous than suitable of fashion to the place
or the occasion. Into the group about the Princess they came,
whilst the exquisite Castruccio eyed this unfashionable young man
with frank contempt, bearing his pomander-ball to his nostrils as
if to protect his olfactory organs from possible offence.</p>
<p>Messer Aliprandi, trimly bearded, elegant in his furred gown,
and suavely mannered, bowed low before the Lady Valeria.</p>
<p>"Permit me, highness, to present Messer Bellarion Cane, the son
of my good friend Facino Cane of Biandrate."</p>
<p>It was the Marquis Theodore who had requested the Orator of
Milan&mdash;as was proper, seeing that by reason of his paternity
Bellarion was to be regarded as Milanese&mdash;to present his assumed
compatriot to her highness.</p>
<p>Bellarion, modelling himself upon Aliprandi, executed his bow
with grace.</p>
<p>As Fra Serafino truthfully says of him: "He learnt manners and
customs and all things so quickly that he might aptly be termed a
fluid in the jug of any circumstance."</p>
<p>The Lady Valeria inclined her head with no more trace of
recognition in her face than there was in Bellarion's own.</p>
<p>"You are welcome, sir," she said with formal graciousness, and
then turned to Aliprandi. "I did not know that the Count of
Biandrate had a son."</p>
<p>"Nor did I, Madonna, until this moment. It was the Marquis
Theodore who made him known to me." She fancied in Aliprandi's tone
something that seemed to disclaim responsibility. But she turned
affably to the newcomer, and Bellarion marvelled at the ease with
which she dissembled.</p>
<p>"I knew the Count of Biandrate well when I was a child, and I
hold his memory very dear. He was in my father's service once, as
you will know. I rejoice in the greatness he has since achieved. It
should make a brave tale."</p>
<p>"Per aspera ad astra is ever a brave tale," Bellarion answered
soberly. "Too often it is per astra ad aspera, if I may judge by
what I have read."</p>
<p>"You shall tell me of your father, sir. I have often wished to
hear the story of his advancement."</p>
<p>"To command, highness." He bowed again.</p>
<p>The others drew closer, expecting entertainment. But Bellarion,
who had no such entertainment to bestow, nor knew of Facino's life
more than a fragment of what was known to all the world, extricated
himself as adroitly as he could.</p>
<p>"I am no practised troubadour or story-singer. And this tale of
a journey to the stars should be told under the stars."</p>
<p>"Why, so it shall, then. They shine brightly enough. You shall
show me Facino's and perhaps your own." She rose and commanded her
ladies to attend her.</p>
<p>Castruccio fetched a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"Give thanks," he said audibly to those about him, "for Heaven's
mercy which has spared you this weariness."</p>
<p>The door at the end of the hall stood open to the terrace and
the moonlight. Thither the Princess conducted Bellarion, her ladies
in close attendance.</p>
<p>Approaching the threshold, they came upon the Marquis Gian
Giacomo, reeling clumsily beside the Countess of Ronsecco, who was
almost on the point of tears. He paused in his caperings that he
might ogle his sister.</p>
<p>"Where do you go, Valeria? And who's this long-shanks?"</p>
<p>She approached him. "You are tired, Giannino, and the countess,
too, is tired. You would be better resting awhile."</p>
<p>"Indeed, highness!" cried the young countess, eagerly
thankful.</p>
<p>But the Marquis was not at all of his sister's wise opinion.</p>
<p>"Tired? Resting! You're childish, Valeria. Always childish.
Childish and meddlesome. Poking your long nose into everything.
Some day you'll poke it into something that'll sting it. And what
will it look like when it's stung? Have you thought of that?" He
laughed derisively, and caught the countess by the arm. "Let's
leave long-nose and long-shanks. Ha! Ha!" His idiotic laughter
shrilled up. He was ravished by his own humour. He let his voice
ring out that all might hear and share the enjoyment of his comical
conceit. "Long-nose and long-shanks! Long-nose and long-shanks!</p>
<p>"Said she to him, your long shanks I adore. Said he to her, your
long nose I deplore."</p>
<p>Screaming with laughter, he plunged forward to resume the dance,
trod upon one of his trailing exaggerated sleeves, tripped himself
and went sprawling on the tesselated floor, his laughter growing
still louder and more idiotic. A dozen ran to lift him.</p>
<p>The Princess tapped Bellarion sharply on the arm with her fan of
ostrich-plumes. Her face was like graven stone.</p>
<p>"Come," she commanded, and passed out ahead of him.</p>
<p>On the terrace she signed to her ladies to fall behind, whilst
she drew her companion beyond earshot along the marble balustrade,
whose moonlit pallor was here and there splashed by the black tide
of trailing plants.</p>
<p>"Now, sir," she invited in a voice of ice, "will you explain
this new identity, and your presence?"</p>
<p>He answered in calm level tones: "My presence explains itself
when I tell you that my identity is accepted by his highness the
Regent. The son of Facino Cane is not to be denied the hospitality
of the Court of Montferrat."</p>
<p>"Then why did you lie to me when...?"</p>
<p>"No, no. This is the lie. This false identity was as necessary
to gain admission here as was the painter's smock I wore
yesterday&mdash;another lie."</p>
<p>"You ask me to believe that you..." Indignation choked her. "My
senses tell me what you are&mdash;an agent sent to work my ruin."</p>
<p>"Your senses tell you either more or less, or else you would not
now be here."</p>
<p>And then it was as if the bonds of her self-control were
suddenly snapped by the strain they sought to bear. "Oh, God!" she
cried out. "I am near distraction. My brother..." She broke off on
something akin to a sob.</p>
<p>Outwardly Bellarion remained calm. "Shall we take one thing at a
time? Else we shall never be done. And I should not remain here too
long with you."</p>
<p>"Why not? You have the sanction of my dear uncle who sends
you."</p>
<p>"Even so." He lowered his voice to a whisper. "It is your uncle
is my dupe, not you."</p>
<p>"That is what I expected you to say."</p>
<p>"You had best leave inference until you have heard me out.
Inference, highness, as I have shown you once already, is not your
strength."</p>
<p>If she resented his words and the tone he took, she gave no
expression to it. Standing rigidly against the marble balustrade
she looked away from him and down that moonlit garden with its inky
shadows and tall yew hedges that were sharp black silhouettes
against the faintly irradiated sky.</p>
<p>Briefly, swiftly, lucidly, Bellarion told her how her message
had been received by the conspirators.</p>
<p>"You thought to checkmate them. But they perceived the move you
have overlooked, whereby they checkmate you. This proves what I
already have told you: that they serve none but themselves. You and
your brother are merely the instruments with which they go to work.
There was only one way to frustrate them: one only way to serve and
save you. That way I sought."</p>
<p>She interrupted him there. "You sought? You sought?" Her voice
held bewilderment, unbelief and even some anger. "Why should you
desire to save or serve me? If I could believe you, I must account
you impertinent. You were a messenger, no more."</p>
<p>"Was I no more when I disclosed to you the true aims of these
men and the perils of your association with them?"</p>
<p>"Ay, you were more," she said bitterly. "But what were you?"</p>
<p>"Your servant, Madonna," he answered simply.</p>
<p>"Ah yes. I had forgotten. My servant. Sent by Providence, was it
not?"</p>
<p>"You are bitter, lady."</p>
<p>"Am I?" She turned at last to look at him. But his face was no
more than a faint white blur. "Perhaps I find you too sweet to be
real."</p>
<p>He sighed. "The rest of my tale will hardly change that opinion.
Is it worth while continuing?" He spoke without any heat, a little
wistfully.</p>
<p>"It should be entertaining if not convincing."</p>
<p>"For your entertainment, then: what you could not do without
destroying yourself was easily possible to me." And he told her of
his pretended petition, giving the Regent the names of those who
plotted against his life.</p>
<p>He saw her clutch her breast, caught the gasp of dread and
dismay that broke from her lips.</p>
<p>"You betrayed them!"</p>
<p>"Was it not what you announced that you would do if they did not
abandon their plan of murder? I was your deputy, no more. When I
presented myself as Facino Cane's adopted son I was readily
believed&mdash;because the Regent cared little whether it were true or
not, since in me he perceived the very agent that he needed."</p>
<p>"Ah, now at last we have something that does not strain
belief!"</p>
<p>"Will it strain belief that the Regent was already fully
informed of this conspiracy?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Why else should he have trusted or believed me? Of his own
knowledge he knew that what I told him was true."</p>
<p>"He knew, and he held his hand?" Again the question was made
scornful by unbelief.</p>
<p>"Because he lacked evidence that you, and through you, your
brother, were parties to the plot. What to him are Barbaresco's
shabby crew? It is the Marquis Gian Giacomo who must be removed in
such a manner as not to impair the Lord Regent's credit. To gather
evidence am I now sent."</p>
<p>She tore an ostrich-plume from her fan in her momentary
passion.</p>
<p>"You do not hesitate to confess how you betray each in turn:
Barbaresco to the Regent, the Regent to me, and now, no doubt, me
to the Regent."</p>
<p>"As for the last, Madonna, to betray you I need not now be here.
I could have supplied the Regent with all the evidence he needs
against you at the same time that I supplied the evidence against
the others."</p>
<p>She was silent, turning it over in her mind. And because her
mind was acute she saw the proof his words afforded. But because
afraid, she mistrusted proof.</p>
<p>"It may be part of the trap," she complained. "If it were not,
why should you remain after denouncing my friends? The aims you
pretend would have been fully served by that."</p>
<p>His answer was prompt and complete.</p>
<p>"If I had departed you would never have known the answer of
those men whom you trust, nor would you have known that there is a
Judas amongst them already. It was necessary to warn you."</p>
<p>"Yes," she said slowly. "I see, I think." And then in sudden
revolt against the conviction he was forcing upon her, and in tones
which if low were vehement to the point of fierceness: "Necessary!"
she cried, echoing the word he had used. "Necessary! How was it
necessary? Whence this necessity of yours? A week ago you did not
know me. Yet for me, who am nothing to you, whose service carries
no reward, you pretend yourself prepared to labour and to take
risks involving even your very life. That is what you ask me to
believe. You suppose me mad, I think."</p>
<p>As she faced him now she fancied that a smile broke upon that
face so indistinctly seen. His voice, as he answered her, was very
soft.</p>
<p>"It is not mad to believe in madness. Madness exists, Madonna.
Set me down as suffering from it. The air of the world is proving
too strong and heady perhaps for one bred in cloisters. It has
intoxicated me, I think."</p>
<p>She laughed chillingly. "For once, you offer an explanation that
goes a little lame. Your invention is failing, sir."</p>
<p>"Nay, lady; my understanding," he answered sadly.</p>
<p>She set a hand upon his arm. He felt it quivering there, which
surprised him almost as much as the change in her voice, now
suddenly halting and unsteady.</p>
<p>"Messer Bellarion, if my suspicions wound you, set them down to
my distraction. It is so easy, so dangerously easy, to believe what
we desire to believe."</p>
<p>"I know," he said gently. "Yet when you've slept on what I've
said, you'll find your safety lies in trusting me."</p>
<p>"Safety! Am I concerned with safety only? Tonight you saw my
brother..."</p>
<p>"I saw. If that is Messer Castruccio's work..."</p>
<p>"Castruccio is but a tool. Come; sir. We talk in vain." She
began to move along the terrace towards her waiting ladies.
Suddenly she paused. "I must trust you, Ser Bellarion. I must or I
shall go mad in this ugly tangle. I'll take the risk. If you are
not true, if you win my trust only to abuse it and work the evil
will of the Regent, then God will surely punish you."</p>
<p>"I think so, too," he breathed.</p>
<p>"Tell me now," she questioned, "what shall you say to my
uncle?"</p>
<p>"Why, that I have talked with you fruitlessly: that either you
have no knowledge of Barbaresco or else you withheld it from
me."</p>
<p>"Shall you come again?"</p>
<p>"If you desire it. The way is open now. But what remains to
do?"</p>
<p>"You may discover that." Thus she conveyed that, having resolved
to give him her trust, she gave it without stint.</p>
<p>They came back into the hall, where stiff and formally Bellarion
made his valedictory bow then went to take leave of the Regent.</p>
<p>The Regent disengaged himself from the group of which he was the
centre, and taking Bellarion by the arm drew him apart a
little.</p>
<p>"I have made a sounding," Bellarion informed him. "Either she
mistrusts me or else she knows nothing of Barbaresco."</p>
<p>"Be sure of the former, sir," said the Regent softly. "Procure
credentials from Barbaresco and try again. It should be easy,
so."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-11" id="ch-1-11"></a>CHAPTER XI. UNDER
SUSPICION</h2>
<p>At Barbaresco's a surprise awaited Messer Bellarion. The whole
company of plotters swarmed about him as he entered the long dusty
room of the mezzanine, and he found himself gripped at once between
the fierce Casella and the reckless Spigno. He did not like their
looks nor those of any man present. Least of all did he like the
looks of Barbaresco, who confronted him, oily and falsely suave of
manner.</p>
<p>"Where have you been, Master Bellarion?"</p>
<p>He realized that he had need of his wits.</p>
<p>He looked round with surprise and contempt in his stare.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, you're conspirators to the life," he told them. "You
see a spy in every neighbour, a betrayal in every act. Oh, you have
eyes; but no wit to inform your vision. God help those who trust
you! God help you all!" He wrenched at the arms that held him. "Let
me go, fools."</p>
<p>Barbaresco licked his lips. His right hand was held behind his
back. Stealthily almost he came a step nearer, so that he was very
close.</p>
<p>"Not until you tell us where you have been. Not then unless you
tell us more."</p>
<p>Bellarion's sneer became more marked; but no fear showed in his
glance. "Where I have been, you know. Hence these tragical airs.
I've been to Court."</p>
<p>"To what end, Bellarion?" Barbaresco softly questioned. The
others preserved a frozen, watchful silence.</p>
<p>"To betray you, of course." He was boldly ironical. "Having done
so, I return so that you may slit my throat."</p>
<p>Spigno laughed and released the arm he held.</p>
<p>"I, for one, am answered. I told you from the first I did not
believe it."</p>
<p>Casella, however, hung on fiercely. "I'll need a clear answer
before I..."</p>
<p>"Give me air, man," cried Bellarion impatiently, and wrenched
his arm free. "No need to maul me. I'll not run. There are seven of
you to prevent me, and reflection may cool your humours. Reflect,
for instance, that if I were running I should not have come
back."</p>
<p>"You tell us what you would not or did not do. We ask you what
you did," Barbaresco insisted.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you yet another thing I would not have done if my aim
had been betrayal. I should not have gone openly to Court so that
you might hear of my presence there."</p>
<p>"The very argument I employed," Spigno reminded them with
something of Bellarion's own scorn in his manner now. "Let the boy
tell his tale."</p>
<p>They muttered among themselves. Bellarion crossed the room under
their black looks, moving with the fearless air of a man strong in
the sense of his own integrity. He slid into a chair.</p>
<p>"There is nothing to tell that is not self-evident already. I
went to carry your message to the Princess Valeria; to point out to
her the position of checkmate in which you hold her; to make her
realize that, being committed to this enterprise, she cannot now
either draw back or dictate to us the means by which our aims are
to be reached. All this, I rejoice to tell you, I have happily
accomplished."</p>
<p>Again it was Barbaresco who was their spokesman. "All this we
may believe when you tell us why you chose to go to Court to do it,
and how, being what you represent yourself to be, you succeeded in
gaining admission."</p>
<p>"God give me patience with you, dear Saint Thomas!" said
Bellarion, sighing. "I went to Court because the argument I foresaw
with the Princess was hardly one to be conducted furtively behind a
hedge. It threatened to be protracted. Besides, for furtive
dealing, sirs, bold and open approaches are best when they are
possible. They were possible to me. It happens, sirs, that I am
indeed the adoptive son of Facino Cane, and I perceived how I might
use that identity to present myself at Court and there move
freely."</p>
<p>A dozen questions rained upon him. He answered them all in a
phrase.</p>
<p>"The ambassador of Milan, Messer Aliprandi, was there to sponsor
me."</p>
<p>There was a silence, broken at last by Barbaresco. "Aliprandi
may have been your sponsor there. He cannot be your sponsor here,
and you know it."</p>
<p>"Ay," growled white-haired Lungo. "An impudent tale!"</p>
<p>"And a lame one," added Casella. "If you had this means of going
to Court, why did you wait so long to seize it?"</p>
<p>"Other ways were open on former occasions. You forget that
Madonna Valeria was not expecting me; the garden gate would not be
ajar. And I could not this time go as a painter, which was the
disguise I adopted on the last occasion. Besides, it is too
expensive. It cost me five ducats."</p>
<p>Again their questions came together, for it was the first they
heard of the disguise which he had used. He told them at last the
story. And he saw that it pleased them.</p>
<p>"Why did you not tell us this before?" quoth one.</p>
<p>Bellarion shrugged. "Is it important? So that I was your
Mercury, did it matter in what shape I went? Why should I trouble
you with trivial things? Besides, let me remind you&mdash;since you
can't perceive it for yourselves&mdash;that if I had betrayed you to the
Marquis Theodore, the Captain of Justice would now be here in my
place."</p>
<p>"That at least is not to be denied," said Spigno, and in his
vehemence carried two or three others with him.</p>
<p>But the fierce Casella was not of those, nor Lungo, nor
Barbaresco. The latter least of all, for a sudden memory had
stirred in him. His blue eyes narrowed until they were almost
hidden in his great red cheeks.</p>
<p>"How does it happen that none at Court recognized in you the
palace amanuensis?"</p>
<p>Bellarion perceived his danger, and learnt the lesson that a lie
may become a clumsy obstacle to trip a man. But of the apprehension
he suddenly felt, no trace revealed itself upon his
countenance.</p>
<p>"It is possible some did. What then? Neither identity
contradicts the other. And remember, pray, that Messer Aliprandi
was there to avouch me."</p>
<p>"But he cannot avouch you here," Barbaresco said again, and
sternly asked: "Who can?"</p>
<p>"Bellarion looked at him, and from him to the others who seemed
to await almost in breathlessness his answer.</p>
<p>"Do you demand of me proof that I am the adoptive son of Facino
Cane?" he asked.</p>
<p>"So much do we demand it that unless you can afford it your
sands are run, my cockerel," Casella answered him, his fingers on
his dagger as he spoke.</p>
<p>It was a case for bold measures if he would gain time. He knew
that in time all things may become possible, and there was one
particular thing his shrewd calculations accounted probable here if
only he could induce them to postpone until tomorrow the slitting
of his throat.</p>
<p>"So be it. From here to Cigliano it is no more than a day's ride
on a good horse. Let one of you go ask the Abbot of the Grazie the
name of him Facino left in the convent's care."</p>
<p>"A name?" cried Casella, sneering. "Is that all the proof?"</p>
<p>"All if the man who goes is a fool. If not, he may obtain from
the Abbot a minute description of this Bellarion. If more is
needed, I'll give you a note of the clothes I wore and the gear and
money with which I left the Grazie, that you may obtain
confirmation of that, too."</p>
<p>But Barbaresco was impatient. "Even so, what shall all this
prove? It cannot prove you true. It cannot prove that you are not a
spy sent hither to betray and sell us."</p>
<p>"No," Bellarion agreed. "But it will prove that the identity on
which I won to Court is what I represent it, and that will be
something as a beginning. The rest&mdash;if there is more&mdash;can surely
wait."</p>
<p>"And meanwhile...?" Casella was beginning.</p>
<p>"Meanwhile, I am in your hands. You're never so bloodthirsty
that you cannot postpone murdering me until you've verified my
tale?"</p>
<p>That was what they fell to discussing among themselves, there in
his very presence, affording him all the excitement of watching the
ball of his fate tossed this way and that among the disputants.</p>
<p>In the end, the game might have gone against him but for Count
Spigno, who laboured Bellarion's own argument that if he had
betrayed them he would never have incurred the risk of returning
amongst them.</p>
<p>In the end they deprived Bellarion of the dagger which was his
only weapon, and then Barbaresco, Casella and Spigno jointly
conducted him above-stairs to a shabby chamber under the roof. It
had no windows whence an evasion might be attempted, and was
lighted by a glazed oblong some ten feet overhead at the highest
part of the sharply sloping ceiling. It contained no furniture, nor
indeed anything beyond some straw and sacking in a corner, which he
was bidden to regard as his bed for that night and probably for the
next.</p>
<p>They pinioned his wrists behind him for greater safety, and
Casella bade him to be thankful that the cord was not being
tightened about his neck instead. Upon that they went out, taking
the light with them, locking the door, and leaving him a prisoner
in the dark.</p>
<p>He stood listening to their footsteps receding down the stairs,
then he looked up at the oblong of moonlight in his ceiling. If the
glass were removed, there would be room for a man to pass through
and gain the roof. But considering the slope of it, the passage
might as easily lead to a broken neck as to liberty, and in any
case he had neither the power nor the means to reach it.</p>
<p>He squatted upon the meagre bedding, with his chin almost upon
his knees, in an attitude of extreme discomfort, making something
in the nature of an assessment of his mental and emotional
equipment. Seen now from the point of view of cold reason to which
danger had sharply brought him, his career since leaving the peace
of the Grazie a week ago seemed fantastic and incredible. Destiny
had made sport with him. Sentimentality had led him by the nose. He
had mixed himself in the affairs of a State through which he was no
more than a wayfarer, because moved to interest in the fortunes of
a young woman of exalted station, who would probably dismiss his
memory with a sigh when she came to learn how his throat had been
cut by the self-seeking fools with whom so recklessly she had
associated herself. It was, he supposed, a manifestation of that
romantic and unseasonable phenomenon known as chivalry. If he
extricated himself alive from this predicament, he would see to it
that whatever follies he committed in the future, chivalry would
certainly not be found amongst them. Experience had cured him of
any leanings in that direction. It had also inspired doubts of the
infallibility of his syllogism on the subject of evil. He suspected
a flaw in it somewhere. For evil most certainly existed. His
respect for the value of experience was rapidly increasing.</p>
<p>He shifted his position, stretched himself out, and lay on his
side, contemplating the patch of moonlight on the floor, and
speculating upon his chances of winning out of this death-trap. Of
these he took an optimistic view. The assistance upon which
Bellarion chiefly counted was that of the traitors amongst the
conspirators, whom he strove vainly to identify in the light of
their behaviour that evening. Spigno had been the only one who, by
advocating Bellarion's cause, had procured him this respite. Yet
Spigno was one of the first to spring upon him, dagger in hand, on
his return from Court. But the traitor, whoever he might be, would
probably report the event to the Marquis Theodore, and the Marquis
should take steps, directly or indirectly, to procure the release
of one whom he must now regard as a valuable agent.</p>
<p>That, thought Bellarion, was the probability. Meanwhile, he
would remember that probabilities are by no means certainties, and
he would be watchful for an opportunity to help himself.</p>
<p>On these reflections he must have fallen asleep, and he must
have slept for some time, for when suddenly he awakened the patch
of moonlight was gone from the floor. That was his first conscious
observation; his second was that something was stirring near at
hand. He raised himself on his elbow, an operation by no means easy
with pinioned wrists, and turned his head in the direction of the
sound, to perceive a faint but increasing rhomb of light from the
direction of the doorway and to understand with the next heart-beat
that the door was being slowly and stealthily pushed open.</p>
<p>That was, he afterwards confessed, his first real acquaintance
with the emotion of fear; fear that roughened his skin and chilled
his spine; fear inspired by the instantaneous conviction that here
came someone to murder him as he lay there bound and helpless.</p>
<p>The suspense was but of seconds, yet in those seconds Bellarion
seemed to live an age as he watched that slowly widening gap and
the faint light which increased in area but hardly in illumination.
Then the shadowy form of a man slipped through, darkly discernible
in the faint glow from the veiled light he carried.</p>
<p>Very softly came his voice: "Sh! Quiet! Make no sound!" The note
of warning partially calmed the tumult of Bellarion's heart, which
was thudding in his throat as if to suffocate him.</p>
<p>As quietly as it had been opened, the door was closed again; a
thin and partially translucent mantle was pulled from the lantern
it had been muffling, and the light beating through the horn panes
was reflected from the floor and walls upon the lean aquiline
features of Count Spigno. Bellarion uttered something that sounded
like a chuckle. "I was expecting you," said he.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-12" id="ch-1-12"></a>CHAPTER XII. COUNT
SPIGNO</h2>
<p>Spigno set the lantern on the floor and came forward.</p>
<p>"No need to talk," he muttered. "Roll over so that I can free
your hands." He drew his dagger and with it cut Bellarion's
bonds.</p>
<p>"Take off your shoes. Make haste."</p>
<p>Bellarion squatted upon his bedding, and with blundering fingers
still numbed from the thong he removed his footgear. His wits
worked briskly, and it was not at all upon the subject of his
escape that they were busy. Despite his late resolves, and although
still far from being out of peril, with the chance of salvation no
more than in sight, he was already at his knight-errantry
again.</p>
<p>He stood up at last, and Spigno was whispering urgently.</p>
<p>"Wait! We must not go together. Give me five minutes to win
clear; then follow."</p>
<p>Bellarion considered him, and his eyes were very grave.</p>
<p>"But when my evasion is discovered..." he was beginning. Spigno
impatiently broke in, explaining hurriedly:</p>
<p>"I am the last they will suspect. The others are all here
tonight. But I pleaded urgent reasons why I could not remain. I
made a pretence of departing, then hid below until all were asleep.
They will be at each other's throats in the morning over this." He
smiled darkly in satisfaction of his cunning. "I'll take the light.
You know your way about this house better than I do. Tread softly
when you come."</p>
<p>He was turning to take up the lantern when Bellarion arrested
him.</p>
<p>"You'll wait for me outside?"</p>
<p>"To what end? Nay, now. There is no purpose in that."</p>
<p>"Let me come with you, then. If I should stumble in the dark
they'll be upon me."</p>
<p>"Take care that you do not."</p>
<p>"At least leave me your dagger since you take the light."</p>
<p>"Here, then." Spigno unsheathed and surrendered the weapon to
him.</p>
<p>Bellarion gripped the hilt. With very sombre eyes he considered
the Count. The latter was turning aside again for the lantern.</p>
<p>"A moment," said Bellarion.</p>
<p>"What now?"</p>
<p>Impatiently Spigno faced once more the queer glance of those
dark eyes, and in that moment Bellarion stabbed him.</p>
<p>It was a swift, hard-driven, merciful stroke that found the
unfortunate man's heart and quenched his life before he had time to
realize that it was threatened.</p>
<p>Without a sound he reeled back under the blow. Bellarion's left
arm went round his shoulders to ease him to the ground. But
Spigno's limbs sagged under him. He sank through Bellarion's
embrace like an empty sack and then rolled over sideways.</p>
<p>The murderer choked back a sob. His legs were trembling like
empty hose with which the wind makes sport. His face was
leaden-hued and his sight was blurred by tears. He went down on his
knees beside the dead Count, turned him on his back, straightened
out the twitching limbs, and folded the arms across the breast. Nor
did he rise when this was done.</p>
<p>In slaying Count Spigno he had performed a necessary
act&mdash;necessary to the service to which he had dedicated himself.
Thus at a blow he had shattered the instrument upon which the
Marquis Theodore was depending to encompass his nephew's ruin; and
the discovery tomorrow of Spigno's death and Bellarion's own
evasion, in circumstances of unfathomable mystery, must strike such
terror into the hearts of the conspirators that there would
probably be an end to the plotting which served no purpose but to
advance the Regent's schemes.</p>
<p>Yet despite these heartening reflections, Bellarion could not
shake off his horror. He had done murder, and he had done it in
cold blood, deliberate and calculatingly. Worse than all&mdash;his
convent-rearing asserting itself here&mdash;he had sent a man unshriven
to confront his Maker. He hoped that the unexpectedness with which
Spigno's doom had overtaken him would be weighed in the balance
against the sins which death had surprised upon him.</p>
<p>That is why he remained on his knees, and with joined hands
prayed fervently and passionately for the repose of the soul which
he had despatched to judgment. So intent was he that he took no
heed of the precious time that was meanwhile speeding. For perhaps
a quarter of an hour he continued there in prayer, then, crossing
himself, he rose at last and gave thought to his own escape.</p>
<p>Thrusting his shoes into his belt and muffling the lantern as
Spigno had muffled it, he set out, the naked dagger in his right
hand.</p>
<p>A stair creaked under his step and then another and each time he
checked and caught his breath, listening intently. Once he fancied
that he heard a movement below, and the sound so alarmed him that
it was some moments before he could proceed.</p>
<p>He gained the floor below in safety, and rounding the balusters
continued his cautious descent towards the mezzanine, where, as he
knew, Barbaresco slept. Midway down he heard that sound again, this
time unmistakably the sound of someone moving in the passage to the
right, in the direction of Barbaresco's room. He stopped abruptly
and thrust the muffled lantern behind him so that the faint glow of
it might not beat downwards upon the gloom to betray him. He was
conscious of pulses drumming in his temples, for, shaken by the
night's events, he was now become an easy prey to fear.</p>
<p>Suddenly, to his increasing horror, another, stronger light fell
along the passage. It grew steadily as he watched it, and with it
came a sound of softly shod feet, a mutter in a voice that he knew
for Barbaresco's, and an answering mutter in the high-pitched voice
of Barbaresco's old servant.</p>
<p>His first impulse was to turn and flee upwards, back the way he
had come. But thus he would be rushing into a trap, which would be
closed by Barbaresco's guests, who slept most probably above.</p>
<p>Then, bracing himself for whatever fate might send, he bounded
boldly and swiftly forward, no longer troubling to tread lightly.
His aim was to round the stairs and thereafter trust to speed to
complete the descent and gain the street. But the noise he made
brought Barbaresco hurrying forward, and at the foot of that flight
they confronted each other, Bellarion's way barred by the gentleman
of Casale, who loosed at sight of him a roar that roused the
house.</p>
<p>Barbaresco was in bedgown and slippers, a candle in one hand,
his servant following at his heels. He was unarmed. But not on that
account could he shirk the necessity of tackling and holding his
fugitive, whose flight was an abundant advertisement of his
treachery, and whose evasion now might be attended by direst
results.</p>
<p>He passed the candle to his servant and flung himself bodily
upon Bellarion, pinning the young man's arms to his sides and
roaring lustily the while. Bellarion struggled silently and grimly
in that embrace, which was like the hug of a bear; for, despite his
corpulence, Barbaresco was as strong as he was heavy. But the grip
he had taken, whilst having the advantage of pinning down the hand
that held the dagger, was one that it is impossible long to
maintain upon an opponent of any vigour; and before he could
sufficiently bend him to receive his weight, Bellarion had broken
loose. Old Andrea, the servant, having set the candle upon the
floor, was running in now to seize Bellarion's legs. He knocked
Andrea over, winded by a well-directed kick in the stomach, then
swung aloft his dagger as Barbaresco rushed at him again. It was in
his mind, as he afterwards declared, that he did not desire another
murder on his soul that night. But if another murder there must be,
he preferred that it should not be his own. So he struck without
pity. Barbaresco swerved, throwing up his right arm to parry the
blow, and received the long blade to the hilt in his fleshy
forearm.</p>
<p>He fell back, clapping his hand to the bubbling wound and
roaring like a bull in pain, just as Casella, almost naked, but
sword in hand, came bounding down the stairs with Lungo and yet
another following.</p>
<p>For a second it seemed to Bellarion that he had struck too late.
If he attempted now to regain the staircase he must inevitably be
cut off, and how could he hope with a dagger to meet Casella's
sword? Then, on a new thought, he darted forward and plunged into
the long room of that mezzanine. He slammed the door and shot home
the bolts before Casella and Lungo brought up against it on the
other side.</p>
<p>He uncovered at last his lantern and set it down. He dragged the
heavy table across the door so as to reinforce it against their
straining shoulders. Then, snatching up the cloak in which the
lantern had been muffled, he made for the window and threw it
open.</p>
<p>He paused to put on his shoes, what time the baffled
conspirators were battering and straining at the door. Then he
forced the naked dagger as far as it would go into the empty sheath
that dangled from his own belt and tied a corner of the cloak
securely to one of the stone mullions so that some five or six feet
of it dangled below the sill. On to this sill he climbed, turned,
knelt and laid hold of the cloak with both hands.</p>
<p>He had but to let himself down hand over hand for the length of
cloth, and then only an easy drop of a few feet would lie between
himself and safety.</p>
<p>But even as he addressed himself to this, the house door below
was opened with a clatter, and out into the street sprang two of
the conspirators.</p>
<p>He groaned as he looked down upon them from his precarious
position, whilst they, in their shirts, capering fantastically as
it seemed to him in the shaft of light that cut athwart the gloom
from the open door, brandished their glittering blades and
waited.</p>
<p>Since there could be no salvation in climbing back, he realized
that he was at the end of the wild career he had run since leaving
the peace of the Grazie a week ago. A week! He had lived a lifetime
in that week, and he had looked more than once in the face of
death. He thought of the Abbot's valedictory words: "Pax multa in
cella, foris autem plurima bella". What would he not give now to be
back in the peace of that convent cell?</p>
<p>As he hung there, between two deaths, he sought to compose his
mind to prayer, to prepare his soul for Judgment by an act of
contrition for his sins. Nor could he in that supreme hour take
comfort in his old heresy that sin is a human fiction.</p>
<p>And then even as his despair of body and spirit touched its
nadir, he caught a sound that instantly heartened him: the approach
of regularly tramping feet.</p>
<p>Those below heard it too. The watch was on its rounds. The
murderous twain took counsel for a moment. Then, fearing to be
surprised there, they darted through the doorway and closed the
door again just as the patrol with lanterns swinging from their
halberts came round the corner not a dozen yards away.</p>
<p>With nothing to fear from these, Bellarion now let himself
swiftly down the length of the cloak and dropped lightly to the
ground.</p>
<p>He was breathing easily and oddly disposed to laugh when the
officer came up with him, and the patrol of six made a half-circle
about him.</p>
<p>"What's this?" he was challenged. "Why do you prefer a window to
a door, my friend?"</p>
<p>Bellarion was still seeking a plausible answer, when the
officer's face came nearer to his own upon which the light was
beating down. Recognition was mutual. It was that same officer who
had hunted him from the Tavern of the Stag to the Palace
Gardens.</p>
<p>"By the Blood!" cried Messer Bernabo. "It is Lorenzaccio's fleet
young friend. Well met, my cockerel! I've been seeking you this
week. You shall tell me where you've been hiding."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-13" id="ch-1-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. THE TRIAL</h2>
<p>The court of the Podesta of Casale was commonly well-attended,
and often some of the attendance would be distinguished. The
Princess Valeria, for instance, would sometimes sit with her ladies
in the little minstrel's gallery of what had once been the
banqueting-hall of the Communal Palace, and by her presence attest
her interest in all that concerned the welfare of the people of
Montferrat. Occasionally, too, as became a prince who desired to be
regarded as a father of his people, the Marquis Theodore would come
to observe for himself how justice was administered in his name, or
in the name of the boy whose deputy he was.</p>
<p>On the morning after that affray at Messer Barbaresco's house,
both the Regent and his niece were to be seen in that hall of
justice, the latter aloft in the gallery, the former in a chair
placed on the dais alongside of the Podesta's seat of state. The
Regent's countenance was grave, his brow thoughtful. This was
proper to the occasion, but hardly due to the causes supposed by
the spectators. Disclosures now inevitable might win him an
increase of the public sympathy he enjoyed. But because premature
they temporarily wrecked his real aims, wrecked in any case by the
death of his agent Spigno.</p>
<p>There were other notabilities present. Messer Aliprandi, who had
expressly postponed his departure for Milan, was seated beside the
Regent. Behind them against the grey stone wall lounged a
glittering group of courtiers, in which Castruccio da Fenestrella
was conspicuous. In the body of the court seethed a crowd composed
of citizens of almost every degree, rigidly kept clear of the wide
space before the dais by a dozen men-at-arms forming a square with
partisans held horizontally. On the left of the Podesta, who was
clothed in a scarlet robe and wore a flat round scarlet cap that
was edged with miniver, sat his two assessors in black, and below
these two scriveners. The Podesta himself, Angelo de' Ferraris, a
handsome bearded man of fifty, was a Genoese, to comply with the
universal rule throughout Italy that the high office of justiciary
should ever be held by one who was a foreigner to the State, so as
to ensure the disinterestedness and purity of the justice he
dispensed.</p>
<p>Some minor cases had briefly been heard and judged, and the
court now awaited the introduction of that prisoner who was
responsible for this concourse above the average in numbers and
quality.</p>
<p>He came in at last, between guards, tall, comely, with thick,
glossy black hair that fell to the nape of his neck, his brave red
suit considerably disordered and the worse for wear. He was pale
from lack of sleep, for he had spent what was left of the night in
the town-gaol among the vermin-infested scourings of Casale, where
he had deemed it prudent to maintain himself awake. Perhaps because
of this, too, he suffered a moment's loss of his admirable
self-command when upon first entering there he found himself
scanned by eyes so numerous and so varied. For an instant he
paused, disconcerted, experiencing something of that shyness which
is a mixture of mistrust and resentment peculiar to wild creatures.
But the emotion was transient. Before it could be remarked, he had
recovered his normal poise and advanced to the place assigned him
on the broad stone flags, bowed to the Regent and the Podesta, then
waited, his head high, his glance steady.</p>
<p>On the hush that fell came the Podesta's voice, sternly calm.
"Your name?"</p>
<p>"Bellarion Cane." Since that was the name he had given himself
when he had sought the Regent, the lie must be maintained. It was
dangerous, of course. But dangers hemmed him in on every side.</p>
<p>"Your father's name?"</p>
<p>"Facino Cane is my adoptive father's name. The name of my carnal
parents I do not know."</p>
<p>Desired to explain himself, he did so; and his explanation was a
model of brevity and lucidity. It bore witness to a calm which
argued to his listeners an easy conscience. But the Podesta was to
deal with certain facts rather than uncertain personal
impressions.</p>
<p>"You came hither a week ago in the company of one Lorenzaccio da
Trino, a bandit with a price on his head. To this, one of my
officers who is present bears witness. Do you deny it?"</p>
<p>"I do not. It is possible for an honest man to travel in the
company of a rogue."</p>
<p>"You were with him at a house in the district of Casale where a
theft was committed and the owner of which was subsequently
murdered here in the Hostelry of the Stag by this same Lorenzaccio
whilst in your company. The murdered man recognized you before he
died. Do you confess to this?"</p>
<p>"Confession implies sin and the seeking of forgiveness. I admit
the facts freely. They nowise contradict my previous statement. But
that is not a confession."</p>
<p>"Yet if you were innocent of evil why did you run away from my
officer? Why did you not remain and state then what you have stated
now?"</p>
<p>"Because appearances were against me. I acted upon impulse, and
foolishly, as men act when they do not pause first to reflect."</p>
<p>"You found shelter in the house of the Lord Annibale Barbaresco.
No doubt you told him your story, represented yourself as an
innocent man betrayed by appearances, and so moved his
compassion."</p>
<p>The Podesta paused. Bellarion did not answer. He let the
statement pass. He knew the source of it. Last night when the
officer had roused the house and announced to Barbaresco his
prisoner's supposed association with Lorenzaccio, Barbaresco had
fastened upon it to explain the events.</p>
<p>"Last night you attempted to rob him and, being caught in the
act by Count Spigno, you slew the count and afterwards wounded the
Lord Barbaresco himself. You were in the act of escaping from the
house by one of its windows when the watch supervened and caught
you. Do you admit all this?"</p>
<p>"I do not. Nor will the circumstances. I am a robber, it is
said. I spend a week in Messer Barbaresco's house. On any night of
that week I was alone with him, save only for his decrepit old
servant. Yet it is pretended that I chose as the occasion for
robbing him a night on which seven able-bodied friends are with
him. Your potency must see that the facts are mocked by
likelihood."</p>
<p>His potency saw this, as did all present. They saw more. This
young man's speech and manner were those of the scholar he
proclaimed himself rather than of the robber he was
represented.</p>
<p>The justiciary leaned forward, combing his short pointed
beard.</p>
<p>"What, then, do you say took place? Let us hear you."</p>
<p>"Is it not within the forms of law that we should first hear my
accuser&mdash;this Messer Barbaresco?" Bellarion's bold dark eyes raked
the court, seeking the stout person of his late host.</p>
<p>The Podesta smiled a little, and his smile was not quite
nice.</p>
<p>"Ah, you know the law, do you? Trust a rogue to know the
law."</p>
<p>"Which is to make a rogue of every lawyer in the land," said
Bellarion and was rewarded by a titter from the crowd, pleased with
a sarcasm that contained more truth than he suspected. "I know the
law as I know divinity and rhetoric and other things. Because I
have studied it."</p>
<p>"Maybe," said the Podesta grimly. "But not as closely as you are
to study it now." Messer de' Ferraris, too, could deal in sarcasm.
An officer, with excitement spread upon his face, came bustling
into the court, but paused upon perceiving that the justiciary was
speaking.</p>
<p>"Your accuser," said Messer de' Ferraris, "you have heard
already, or at least his accusation, which I have pronounced to
you. That accusation you are now required to answer."</p>
<p>"Required?" said Bellarion, and all marvelled at the calm of
this man who knew no fear of persons. "By what am I so required?
Not by the law which prescribes that an accused shall hear his
accuser in person and be given leave to question him upon his
accusations. Your Excellency should not be impatient that I stand
upon the rights of an accused. Let Messer Barbaresco come forth,
and out of his own mouth he shall destroy his falsehood."</p>
<p>His manner might impress the general, but it did not conciliate
his judge.</p>
<p>"Why, rogue, do you command here?"</p>
<p>"The law does," said Bellarion, "and I voice the law."</p>
<p>"You voice the law!" The Podesta smiled upon him. "Well, well I
I will be patient as you bid me in your impudence. Messer
Barbaresco shall be heard." There was an infinite threat in his
tone. He leaned back and looked round the court. "Let Messer
Barbaresco stand forth."</p>
<p>There was a rustle and mutter of expectation through the court,
for this stiff-necked young cockerel promised to give good
entertainment. Then the excited officer who had lately entered
thrust forward into the open space.</p>
<p>"Excellency, Messer Barbaresco is gone. He left Casale at
sunrise, as soon as the gates were opened, and with him went the
six whose names were on Messer Bernabo's list. The captain of the
Lombard Gate is here to speak to it."</p>
<p>Bellarion laughed, and was sternly bidden to remember where he
stood and to observe the decencies.</p>
<p>The captain of the Lombard Gate stood forth to confirm the
other's tale. A party of eight had ridden out of the town soon
after sunrise, taking the road to Lombardy. One who rode with his
arm in a sling he had certainly recognized for my Lord Barbaresco,
and he had certainly recognized three others whom he named, and a
fourth whom he knew for Barbaresco's servant.</p>
<p>The Regent stroked his chin and turned to the Podesta who was
clearly taken aback.</p>
<p>"Why was this permitted?" he asked sternly.</p>
<p>The Podesta was ill at ease. "I had no news of this man's arrest
until long after sunrise. But in any case it is not usual to detain
accusers."</p>
<p>"To detain them, no. But to take certain precautions where the
features are so peculiar."</p>
<p>"Their peculiarity, highness, with submission, becomes apparent
only in this flight."</p>
<p>The Regent sank back in his chair, and his pale blue eyes were
veiled behind lowered lids. "Well, well! I interrupt the course of
justice. The prisoner waits."</p>
<p>A little bewildered, not only by the turn of events, but by the
Regent's attitude, the Podesta addressed Bellarion with a lessening
of judicial sternness.</p>
<p>"You have heard, sir, that your accuser is not here to speak in
person."</p>
<p>Again Bellarion laughed. "I have heard that he has spoken. His
flight is an eloquent testimony to the falsehood of his
charge."</p>
<p>"Sir, sir," the Podesta admonished him. "You are to satisfy this
court. You are to afford us your own version of what took place
that the ends of justice may be served."</p>
<p>Now here was a change of tone, thought Bellarion, and he was no
longer addressed contemptuously as "rogue". He took full advantage
of it.</p>
<p>"I am to testify? Why, so I will." He looked at the Regent and
found the Regent's eyes upon him, stern and commanding in a face
that was set. He read its message.</p>
<p>"But there is little to which I can speak, for I do not know the
cause of the quarrel that broke out between Count Spigno and Messer
Barbaresco. I was not present at the beginnings. I was drawn to it
by the uproar, and when I arrived Count Spigno was already dead. At
sight of me, perhaps because I was a witness and might inform
against them, I was set upon by Messer Barbaresco and his friends.
I wounded Barbaresco and so got away, locking myself in a room. I
was escaping thence by a window when the watch came up. That is all
I can say."</p>
<p>It was a tale, he thought, that must convey to the Regent the
full explanation. But whatever it may have done in that quarter, it
did not satisfy the Podesta.</p>
<p>"I could credit this more easily," said the latter, "but for the
circumstance that Count Spigno and yourself were fully dressed,
whilst Messer Barbaresco and the others were in their shirts. That
in itself suggests who were the aggressors, who were the
attacked."</p>
<p>"It might, but for the flight of Messer Barbaresco and the
others. Innocent men do not run away."</p>
<p>"Out of your own mouth you have pronounced it," thundered the
Podesta. "You profess innocence of association with Lorenzaccio.
Yet you ran away on that occasion."</p>
<p>"Oh, but the difference...The appearances against a single man
unknown in these parts..."</p>
<p>"Can you explain how you and the dead Count came to be dressed
and the others not?" It was more than a question. It was a
challenge.</p>
<p>Bellarion looked at the Regent. But the Regent made no sign. He
continued to eye Bellarion coldly and sternly. Ready enough to tell
the full lie he had prepared, yet he had the wit to perceive that
the Regent, whilst not suspecting its untruth, might find the
disclosure inconvenient, in which case he would certainly be lost.
As a spy, he reasoned, he could only be of value to the Regent as
long as this fact remained undisclosed. So he took his resolve.</p>
<p>"Why Count Spigno was dressed, I cannot say. My own condition
was the result of accident. I had been to court last night. I
returned late, and I was tired. I fell asleep in a chair, and slept
until the uproar aroused me."</p>
<p>Bellarion fancied that the Regent's glance approved him. But the
Podesta slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>"Convenient tale," he sneered, "but lame. Can you do no
better?"</p>
<p>"Can any man do better than the truth?" demanded Bellarion
firmly, and in the circumstances impudently. "You ask me to explain
things that are outside my knowledge."</p>
<p>"We shall see." The tone was a threat. "The hoist has often been
known to stimulate a man's memory and to make it accurate."</p>
<p>"The hoist?" Bellarion's spirit trembled, for all that his mien
preserved its boldness. He looked again at the Regent, this time
for succour. The Regent was whispering to Messer Aliprandi, and
almost at once the Orator of Milan leaned forward to address the
Podesta.</p>
<p>"May I speak a word in your court, my lord?"</p>
<p>The Podesta turned to him in some surprise. It was not often
that an ambassador intervened in the trial of a rogue accused of
theft and murder.</p>
<p>"At your good pleasure, my lord."</p>
<p>"With submission, then, may I beg that, considering the identity
claimed by this prisoner and the relationship urged with his
Magnificence the Count of Biandrate, the proceedings against him be
suspended until this identity shall have been tested by ordinary
means?"</p>
<p>The ambassador paused. The Podesta, supreme autocrat of justice,
had thrown up his head, resentful of such very definite
interference. But before he could answer, the Regent was adding the
weight of his support to the orator's request.</p>
<p>"However unusual this may be, Messer de' Ferraris," he said in
his quiet, cultured voice, "you will realize with me that if the
prisoner's identity prove to be as he says, and if his present
position should be the result of a chain of unfortunate
circumstances, we should by proceeding to extremes merely provoke
against Montferrat the resentment of our exalted friend the Count
of Biandrate."</p>
<p>Thus it was demonstrated to Bellarion how much may hang upon a
man's wise choice of a parent.</p>
<p>The Podesta bowed his head. There was a moment's silence before
he spoke.</p>
<p>"By what means is it proposed that the accused's pretended
identity shall be tested?"</p>
<p>It was Bellarion who spoke. "I had a letter from the Abbot of
the Grazie of Cigliano, which this Lorenzaccio stole from me, but
which the officer&mdash;"</p>
<p>"We have that letter," the Podesta interrupted, his voice harsh.
"It says nothing of your paternity, and for the rest it can prove
nothing until you prove how it was acquired!"</p>
<p>"He claims," Aliprandi interposed again, "to come from the
Convent of the Grazie of Cigliano, where Messer Facino Cane placed
him some years ago. It should not be difficult, nor greatly delay
the satisfaction of justice, to seek at the convent confirmation of
his tale. If it is confirmed, let one of the fathers who knows him
attend here to say whether this is the same man."</p>
<p>The Podesta combed his beard in silence. "And if so?" he
inquired at last.</p>
<p>"Why, then, sir, your mind will be delivered at least of the
prejudice created by this young man's association with a bandit.
And you will be in better case to judge his share in last night's
events."</p>
<p>There, to the general disappointment, ended for the moment the
odd affair of Bellarion Cane, which in the disclosures it
foreshadowed had promised such unusual entertainment.</p>
<p>The Regent remained in court after Bellarion's removal, lest it
be supposed that his interest in the administration of justice had
been confined to that case alone. But Messer Aliprandi withdrew, as
did most of those others who came from the palace, and amongst
them, pale and troubled; went the Princess Valeria. To Dionara she
vented something of her dismay and anger.</p>
<p>"A thief, a spy, a murderer," she said. "And I trusted him that
he might ruin all my hopes. I have the wages of a fool."</p>
<p>"But if he were what he claims to be?" Madonna Dionara asked
her. "Would that make him any less what he is? He was sent to spy
on me, that he might discover what was plotting. My heart told me
so. Yet to the end I heeded rather his own false tongue."</p>
<p>"But if he were a spy, why should he have urged you to break off
relations with these plotters?"</p>
<p>"So that he might draw from me a fuller revelation of my
intentions. It was he who murdered Spigno&mdash;Spigno the shrewdest,
the most loyal and trustworthy of them all&mdash;Spigno upon whom I
depended to curb their recklessness and yet to give them audacity
in season. And this vile creature of my uncle's has murdered him."
Her eyes were heavy with unshed tears.</p>
<p>"But if so, why was he arrested?"</p>
<p>"An accident. That was not in the reckoning. I went to see how
they would deal with that. And I saw."</p>
<p>Madonna Dionara's vision, however, was less clear, or else
clearer. "Yet I do not understand why he should murder the
Count."</p>
<p>"Do you not?" The Princess laughed a little, quite mirthlessly
"It is not difficult to perceive what happened. Spigno was dressed,
and so was he. Spigno suspected him and followed him last night to
watch him. The scoundrel's bold appearance at Court was his one
mistake, his inexplicable impudence. Spigno taxed him with it on
his return, pressed him perhaps with questions that unmasked him,
and so to save his own skin this Bellarion slew the Count. Why else
are the others all fled? Because they know themselves detected. Is
it not all crystal clear?"</p>
<p>The Lady Dionara shook her head. "If it was your brother's ruin
the Marquis Theodore plotted, this surely frustrates his own ends.
If it were as you say, Messer Bellarion would have spoken out
boldly in court and told his tale. Why, being what you suppose him,
should he keep silent, when by speaking he could best serve the
Regent's purposes?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," the Princess confessed, "nor does any ever know
the Regent's purposes. He works quietly, craftily, slowly, and he
will never strike until he is sure that the blow must be final.
This rogue's conduct was an obedience to the Regent's commands. Did
you not see that when Messer Aliprandi intervened it was after a
whisper from my uncle?"</p>
<p>"But if this man were not what he says he is, what can the
intervention avail in the end?"</p>
<p>Madonna Valeria was wholly scornful now. "He may be what he
claims and yet at the same time what I know him to be. Why not?
Where is the contradiction? Yet I dare to prophesy. This Messer
Bellarion will not again be brought to trial. The means will be
afforded him of breaking prison."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-1-14" id="ch-1-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. EVASION</h2>
<p>Bellarion was returned to the common gaol, which was perched
high upon the city's red wall, to herd once more with the vile
pariahs there incarcerated. But not for long. Within an hour came
an order for his removal to a diminutive stone chamber whose
barred, unglazed window looked out upon a fertile green plain
through which the broad silvery ribbon of the River Po coiled its
way towards Lombardy.</p>
<p>Thither, a little later in the afternoon, came the Marquis
Theodore to visit him in quest of the true facts. Bellarion lied to
him as fluently as he had lied earlier to the Podesta. But no
longer with the same falsehoods.</p>
<p>His tale now went very near the truth. He had come under the
suspicion of the conspirators last night as a result of his visit
to court. Explanations had been demanded, and he had afforded them
as he exactly stated. But conscience making cowards of the
conspirators, they bound him and locked him in a room until from
Cigliano they should have confirmation of his tale. Count Spigno,
fearing that his life might be in danger, came in the night to set
him free.</p>
<p>"Which leads me to suspect," said Bellarion, "that Count Spigno,
too, was an agent of your potency's. No matter. I keep to the
events."</p>
<p>The conspirators, he continued, were more watchful than Spigno
suspected. They came upon the twain just as Bellarion's bonds had
been cut, and Spigno had, fortunately, thrust a dagger into his
hand. They fell upon Spigno, and one of them&mdash;the confusion at the
moment did not permit him to say which&mdash;stabbed the unfortunate
Count. Bellarion would have shared his fate, but that he hacked
right and left with fist and dagger, wounding Barbaresco and
certainly one other, possibly two others. Thus he broke through
them, flung down the stairs, locked himself in the room on the
mezzanine, and climbed out of the window into the arms of the
watch.</p>
<p>"If your highness had not desired me to go to court, this would
not have happened. But at least the conspirators are fled and the
conspiracy is stifled in panic. Your highness is now safe."</p>
<p>"Safe!" His highness laughed hard and cruelly. There was now in
his mien none of that benignity which Montferrat was wont to admire
in it. The pale blue eyes were hard as steel, a furrow at the base
of his aquiline nose rendered sinister and predatory the whole
expression of his countenance.</p>
<p>"Your blundering has destroyed the evidence by which I might
have made myself safe."</p>
<p>"My blundering! Here's justice! Besides, if I were to give the
evidence I withheld from the Podesta, if I were to give a true
account of what happened at Barbaresco's&mdash;"</p>
<p>"If you did that!" The Regent interrupted angrily. "How would it
look, do you suppose? A vagrant rogue, the associate of a bandit,
was closeted yesterday with me, and so far received my countenance
that he was bidden to court. It would disclose a plot, indeed. It
would be said that I plotted to fashion evidence against my nephew.
Do you think that I have no enemies here in Casale and elsewhere in
Montferrat besides Barbaresco and his plotters? If Spigno had
lived, it would have been different, or even if we had Barbaresco
and the others and could now wring the truth from them under
torment. But Spigno is dead and the others gone."</p>
<p>Bellarion deemed him bewildered by his own excessive
subtleties.</p>
<p>"Does Barbaresco's flight give no colour to my tale?" he asked
quietly.</p>
<p>"Only until some other tale is told, as told it would be. Then
what of the word of a rascal like yourself? And what of me who
depend upon the word of so pitiful a knave?"</p>
<p>"Your highness starts at shadows." Bellarion was almost
contemptuous. "In the end it may be necessary to tell my tale if I
am to save my neck."</p>
<p>The Regent's look and tone made Bellarion feel cold.</p>
<p>"Your neck? Why, what does your neck matter?"</p>
<p>"More to me than anybody else's."</p>
<p>The Regent sneered, and the hard eyes grew harder still. "You
become inconvenient, my friend."</p>
<p>Bellarion perceived it. The Regent feared lest investigation
should reveal that he had actually fostered the conspiracy for
purposes of his own, using first Count Spigno and then Bellarion as
his agents.</p>
<p>"Aye, you become inconvenient," he repeated. "Duke Gian Galeazzo
would never have boggled over you. He would have wrung this
precious neck by which you lay such store. Do you thank God that I
am not Gian Galeazzo."</p>
<p>He took the cloak from his left arm. From within its folds he
let fall at Bellarion's feet a coif of rope; from his breast he
drew two stout files which he placed upon Bellarion's stool.</p>
<p>"If you remove one of those bars, that should give you passage.
Attach the rope to another, and descend by it at dusk. When you
touch ground, you will be outside the walls. Go your ways and never
cross the frontiers of Montferrat again. If you do, my friend, I
promise you that you shall be hanged out of hand for having broken
prison."</p>
<p>"I should deserve it," said Bellarion. "Your highness need have
no anxiety."</p>
<p>"Anxiety, you dog!" The Regent measured him with that cold
glance a moment, then swung on his heel and left him.</p>
<p>Next morning when it was learnt that the prisoner had escaped,
wild and varied were the speculations in Casale to explain it, and
stern, searching and fruitless the inquiry conducted by the
governor of the prison. None was known to have visited Bellarion
save only the Marquis Theodore, and only one person was so mad as
to suppose that the Regent had made possible the evasion.</p>
<p>"You see," said the Princess Valeria to her faithful Dionara.
"Has my prophecy been fulfilled? Was I not right in my reading of
this sordid page?" But in her dark eyes there was none of the
exultation that commonly goes with verified conjecture.</p>
<p>And at about the same time Bellarion, having found a fisherman
to put him across the Po beyond Frassinetto, was trudging
mechanically along, safe now in the territory of Milan. But his
thoughts went back to Montferrat and the Princess Valeria.</p>
<p>"In her eyes I am a rogue, a trickster, a spy, and perhaps
worse, which matters nothing; for in her eyes I never could have
been anything that signifies. Nor does it really matter that she
should know why Spigno died. Let her think what she will. I have
made her and her brother safe for the present."</p>
<p>That night he lay at an inn at Candia and reflected that he lay
there at the Princess Valeria's charges, for he still possessed
three of the five ducats she had given him for his needs.</p>
<p>"Some day," he said, "I shall repay that loan."</p>
<p>Next morning he was up betimes to resume at last in earnest his
sorely interrupted journey to Pavia. But he found that the Muses no
longer beckoned him as alluringly as hitherto. He had in the last
few days tasted stronger waters than those of Castalia's limpid
spring. He had also made the discovery that in fundamental matters
all his past learning had but served to lead him astray. He
questioned now his heresy on the score of sin. It was possible
that, after all, the theologians might be right. Whether sin and
evil were convertible terms he could not be sure. But not only was
he quite sure that there was no lack of evil in the world; he
actually began to wonder if evil were not the positive force that
fashions the destinies of men, whilst good is but a form of
resistance which, however strong, remains passive, or else, when
active, commonly operates through evil that it may ultimately
prevail.</p>
<p>So much for his syllogism which had seemed irrefragable. It had
fallen to dust at the first touch of worldly experience. Yet, for
all his apprehension of the world's wickedness, it was with a sigh
of regret that he turned his back upon it. The school of living,
striving men called him now with a voice far stronger than that of
Pavia and the learned Chrysolaras, and reminded him that he was
pledged to a service which he could not yet consider fully
rendered.</p>
<h2>BOOK II</h2>
<h2><a name="ch-2-01" id="ch-2-01"></a>CHAPTER I. THE MIRACLE OF
THE DOGS</h2>
<p>Bellarion took his way through the low-lying and insalubrious
marshlands about Mortara, where the rice-fields flourished as they
had flourished almost ever since the grain was first introduced
from China some three hundred years before. It touched his
imagination to know himself treading the soil of the great State of
Milan, a state which Gian Galeazzo Visconti had raised to such
heights of fame and power.</p>
<p>From the peace which Gian Galeazzo had enforced at home, as much
as from his conquest abroad, there had ensued a prosperity such as
Milan had never known before. Her industries throve apace. Her
weavers of silk and wool sent their products to Venice, to France,
to Flanders and to England; the work of her armourers was sought by
all Europe; great was the trade driven with France in horses and
fat Lombardy cattle. Thus the wealth of the civilized world was
drawn to Milan, and such was the development there of banking, that
soon there was scarcely an important city in Europe that had not
its Lombard Street, just as in every city of Europe the gold coins
of Gian Galeazzo, bearing his snake device, circulated freely,
coming to be known as ducats, in honour of this first Duke of
Milan.</p>
<p>His laws, if tinctured by the cruelty of an age which held human
lives cheap, were, nevertheless, wise and justly administered; and
he knew how to levy taxes that should enrich himself without
impoverishing his subjects, perceiving with an intuition altogether
beyond his age that excessive taxation serves but to dry up the
sources of a prince's treasury. His wealth he spent with a
staggering profusion, creating about himself an environment of
beauty, of art, and of culture which overwhelmed the rude French
and ruder English of his day with the sense of their own
comparative barbarism. He spent it also in enlisting into his
service the first soldiers of his time; and, by reducing a score of
petty tyrannies and some that were of consequence, the coils of the
viper came to extend from the Alps to the Abbruzi. So wide, indeed,
were his dominions become that they embraced the greater part of
Northern Italy, and justified their elevation to the status of a
kingdom and himself to the assumption of the royal crown.</p>
<p>In the Castle of Melagnano, where he had shut himself up to
avoid the plague that was crawling over the face of Italy, the
regalia was already prepared, when this great prince, whom no human
enemy had yet been able to approach, was laid low by the invincible
onslaught of that foul disease.</p>
<p>Because at the time of their great father's death Gian Maria was
thirteen, and Filippo Maria twelve years of age, they remained, as
Gian Galeazzo's will provided against such a contingency, under the
tutelage of a council of regency composed of the condottieri and
the Duchess Catherine.</p>
<p>Dissensions marked the beginnings of that council's rule, and
dissensions at a time when closest union was demanded. For in the
death of the redoubtable Gian Galeazzo the many enemies he had made
for Milan perceived their opportunity, whilst Gian Galeazzo's great
captains, disgusted with the vacillations of the degenerate Gian
Maria, who was the creature now of this party, now of that,
furthered the disintegration of his inheritance by wrenching away
portions of it to make independent states for themselves. Five
years of misrule had dissipated all that Gian Galeazzo had so
laboriously built; and of all the great soldiers who had helped him
to build, the only one who remained loyal&mdash;sharing with the bastard
Gabriello the governorship of the Duchy&mdash;was that Facino Cane,
Count of Biandrate, whom Bellarion had in his need adopted for his
father.</p>
<p>Bellarion lay at Vigevano on the second night from Casale, and
on the morrow found a boatman to put him across the broad waters of
the Ticino, then took the road to Abbiategrasso, where the Lords of
Milan possessed a hunting seat.</p>
<p>He sang as he tramped; not from any joyousness of heart, but to
dispel the loneliness that increased upon him with every step that
took him from Casale towards this great city of Milan, this Rome of
the North, which it was his intention to view on his way to
Pavia.</p>
<p>Beyond Abbiategrasso, finding that he was growing footsore on
the hard and dusty road, he forsook it for the meadows, where fat
cattle, the like for which of bulk he had never seen, were
contentedly grazing. Early in the afternoon, by one of the many
watercourses that here intersected the ground, he sat munching the
bread and cheese which he had stuffed into his scrip before leaving
Abbiategrasso.</p>
<p>From the wood crowning the slight eminence beyond the stream
came presently a confused sound of voices, human and canine, a
cracking of whips and other vaguer noises. Suddenly the figure of a
man all in brown broke from the little belt of oaks and cams racing
down the green slope towards the water. He was bareheaded, and a
mane of black hair streamed behind him as he ran.</p>
<p>He was more than midway across that open space between wood and
water when his pursuers came in sight; not human pursuers, but
three great dogs, three bloodhounds, bounding silently after
him.</p>
<p>And then from the wood emerged at last a numerous mounted
company led by one who seemed little more than a boy, very richly
dressed in scarlet and silver, whose harsh and strident voice urged
on the dogs. Of those who followed, the half perhaps were gay and
richly clad like himself, the rest were grooms in leather, and two
of them as they rode held each in leash six straining, yelping
hounds. Immediately behind the youth who led rode a
powerfully-built fellow, black-bearded and black-browed, on a big
horse, wielding a whip with a long lash, who seemed neither groom
nor courtier and yet something of both. He, too, was shouting, and
cracking that long whip of his to urge the dogs to bring down the
human quarry before it could reach the water.</p>
<p>But terror lent wings to the heels of the hunted man. He gained
the edge of the deep sluggish stream a dozen yards ahead of the
hounds, and, without pause or backward glance, leapt wide and
struck the water cleanly, head foremost. Through it he clove,
swimming desperately and strongly, using in the effort the last
remnants of his strength. After him came the dogs, taking the water
almost together.</p>
<p>Bellarion, in horror and pity, ran to the spot where the swimmer
must land and proffered a hand to him as he reached the bank. The
fugitive clutched it, and was drawn vigorously upwards.</p>
<p>"May God reward you, sir!" he gasped, and again, in a voice of
extraordinary fervour, considering how little really had been
accomplished: "May God reward you!" Then he dropped on hands and
knees, panting, exhausted, just as the foremost of the dogs came
clambering up the slippery clay of the bank, to receive in its
throat the dagger with which Bellarion awaited it.</p>
<p>A shout of rage from across the water did not deter him from
slitting the throat of the second dog that landed, and he had
hurled the body of it after the first before that cavalcade brought
up on the far side, vociferous and angry.</p>
<p>The third dog, however, a great black-and-yellow hound, had
climbed the bank whilst Bellarion was engaged with the second. With
a deep-throated growl it was upon him in a leap which bore him
backwards and stretched him supine under the brute's weight.
Instinctively Bellarion flung his left arm across his throat to
shield it from those terrible fangs, whilst with his right he
stabbed upwards into the beast's vitals. There was a howl of pain,
and the dog shrank together a little, suspending its attack.
Bellarion stabbed again, and this time his dagger found the beast's
heart. It sank down upon him limp and quivering, and the warm
gushing blood soaked him from head to foot. He heaved aside the
carcass, which was almost as heavy as a man's, and got slowly to
his feet, wondering uneasily what might be the sequel.</p>
<p>The young man in red and silver was blaspheming horribly. He
paused to scream an order.</p>
<p>"Loose the pack on them! Loose the pack, Squarcia!"</p>
<p>But the big man addressed, on his own responsibility, had
already decided on action of another sort. From his saddle-bow he
unslung an arbalest, which was ready at the stretch, fitted a bolt,
and levelled it at Bellarion. And never was Bellarion nearer death.
It was the youth he had compassionated who now saved him, and this
without intending it.</p>
<p>Having recovered something of his breath, and urged on by the
terror of those dread pursuers, he staggered to his feet, and
without so much as a backward glance was moving off to resume his
flight. The movement caught the eye of the black-browed giant,
Squarcia, just as he was about to loose his shafts. He swung his
arbalest to the fugitive, and as the cord hummed the young man span
round and dropped with the bolt in his brain.</p>
<p>Before Squarcia had removed the stock from his shoulder to wind
the weapon for the second shot he intended, he was slashed across
the face by the whip of young red-and-silver.</p>
<p>"By the Bones of God! Who bade you shoot, brute beast? My order
was to loose the pack. Will you baulk me of sport, you son of a
dog? Did I track him so far to have him end like that?" He broke
into obscenest blasphemy, from which might be extracted an order to
the grooms to unleash the beasts they held.</p>
<p>But Squarcia, undaunted either by blasphemy or whiplash,
interposed.</p>
<p>"Will your highness have that knave kill some more of your dogs
before they pull him down? He's armed, and the dogs are at his
mercy as they climb the bank."</p>
<p>"He killed my dogs, and dog shall avenge dog upon him, the
beast!"</p>
<p>From that pathetic heap at his feet Bellarion realized the fate
that must overtake him if he attempted flight. Fear in him was
blent with loathing and horror of these monsters who hunted men
like stags. Whatever the crime of the poor wretch so ruthlessly
slain under his eyes, it could not justify the infamy of making him
the object of such a chase.</p>
<p>One of the grooms spoke to Squarcia, and Squarcia turned to his
young master.</p>
<p>"Checco says there is a ford at the turn yonder, Lord Duke."</p>
<p>The form of address penetrated the absorption of Bellarion's
feeling. A duke&mdash;this raging, blaspheming boy, whose language was
the language of stables and brothels! What Duke, then, but Duke of
Milan? And Bellarion remembered tales he had lately heard of the
revolting cruelty of this twenty-year-old son of the great Gian
Galeazzo.</p>
<p>Four grooms were spurring away towards the ford, and across the
stream came the thunder of Squarcia's voice, as the great ruffian
again levelled his arbalest.</p>
<p>"Move a step from there, my cockerel, and you'll stand before
your Maker."</p>
<p>Through the ford the horses splashed, the waters, shrunken by a
protracted drought, scarce coming above their fetlocks. And
Bellarion, waiting, bethought him that, after all, the real ruler
of Milan was Facino Cane, and took the daring resolve once more to
use that name as a scapulary.</p>
<p>When the grooms reached him they found themselves intrepidly
confronted by one who proclaimed himself Facino's son, and bade
them sternly have a care how they dealt with him. But if he had
proclaimed himself son of the Pope of Rome it would not have moved
those brutish oafs, who knew no orders but Squarcia's and whose
intelligence was no higher than that of the dogs they tended. With
a thong of leather they attached his right wrist to a stirrup and
compelled him, raging inwardly, to trot with them. He neither
struggled nor protested, realizing the futility of both at present.
At one part of the ford the water rose to his thighs, whilst the
splashing of the horses about him added to his discomfort. But
though soaked in blood and water, he still carried himself proudly
when he came to stand before the young Duke.</p>
<p>Bellarion beheld a man of revolting aspect. His face was almost
embryonic, the face of a man prematurely born whose features in
growing had preserved their half-modelled shape. A bridgeless nose
broad as a negro's splayed across his fresh-complexioned face
immediately above the enormous purple lips of a shapeless mouth.
Round, pale-coloured eyes bulged on the very surface of his face;
his brow was sloping and shallow, and his chin receded. From his
handsome father he inherited only the red-gold hair that had
distinguished Gian Galeazzo.</p>
<p>Bellarion stared at him, fascinated by that unsurpassable
ugliness, and, meeting the stare, a frown descended between the
thick sandy eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Here's an insolent rogue! Do you know who I am?"</p>
<p>"I am supposing you to be the Duke of Milan," said Bellarion in
a lone that was dangerously near contempt.</p>
<p>"Ah! You are supposing it? You shall have assurance of it before
we are done with each other. Were you supposing it when you slew my
dogs?"</p>
<p>"Not when I perceived that you hunted with them
deliberately."</p>
<p>"Why so?"</p>
<p>"Could I suspect that a prince should so hunt a human
quarry?"</p>
<p>"Why, you bold dog..."</p>
<p>"Your highness knows my name!"</p>
<p>"Your name, oaf? What name?"</p>
<p>"What your highness called me. Cane." Thus again, with more
effectiveness than truth, did he introduce the identity that had
served so well before. "I am Bellarion Cane, Facino Cane's
son."</p>
<p>It was an announcement that produced a stir in that odd
company.</p>
<p>A handsome, vigorous young man in mulberry velvet, who carried a
hooded falcon perched on his left wrist, pushed forward on his tall
black horse to survey this blood-smeared ragamuffin with fresh
interest.</p>
<p>The Duke turned to him.</p>
<p>"You hear what he says, Francesco?</p>
<p>"Aye; but I never heard that Facino had a son."</p>
<p>"Oh, some by-blow. No matter." A deepening malice entered his
evil countenance. The mere fact of Bellarion's parentage would give
an added zest to his maltreatment. For deep down in his dark soul
Gian Maria Visconti bore no love for the great soldier who
dominated him.</p>
<p>"We'll rid Facino of the inconvenient incubus. Fall back there,
you others. Line the bank."</p>
<p>The company spread itself in a long file along the water's edge,
like beaters, to hinder the quarry's escape in that direction.</p>
<p>Grim fear took hold of Bellarion. He had shot his bolt, and it
had missed its mark. He was defenceless and helpless in the hands
of this monster and his bestial crew. At a command from the Duke
they loosed the thong that bound him to the stirrup, and he found
himself suddenly alone and free, with more than a glimmering in his
mind of the ghastly fate intended for him.</p>
<p>"Now, rogue," the Duke shrilled at him. "Let us see you run." He
swung to Squarcia. "Two dogs," he commanded.</p>
<p>Squarcia detached two hounds from a pack of six which a groom
was holding in leash. Taking each by its collar, he went down on
one knee between them, awaiting the Duke's command for their
release.</p>
<p>Bellarion meanwhile had not moved. In fascinated horror he
watched these preparations, almost incredulous of their obvious
purport. He was not to know that the love of the chase, which had
led Bernabo Visconti to frame game laws of incredible barbarity,
had been transmitted to his grandson in a form that was loathsomely
depraved. The deer and the wild boar which had satisfied the
hunting instincts of the terrible Bernabo were inadequate for the
horrible lusts of Gian Maria; the sport their agonies yielded could
not compare in his eyes with the sport to be drawn from the chase
of human quarries, to which his bloodhounds were trained by being
fed on human flesh.</p>
<p>"You are wasting time," the Duke admonished him. "In a moment I
shall loose the dogs. Be off while you may, and if you are fleet
enough your heels may save your throat." But he laughed
slobberingly over the words, which were merely intended to befool
the wretched victim with a false hope that should stimulate him to
afford amusement.</p>
<p>Bellarion, white-faced, with such a terror in his soul as he had
never known and should never know again, in whatever guise he might
find death confronting him, turned at last and broke wildly,
instinctively, in a run towards the wood. The Duke's bestial
laughter overtook him before he had covered twenty yards. His
manhood, his human dignity rose in revolt, conquering momentarily
even his blind terror. He checked and swung round. Not another yard
would he run to give sport to that pink-and-silver monster.</p>
<p>The Duke, seeing himself thus in danger of being cheated, swore
at him foully.</p>
<p>"He'll run fast enough, highness, when I loose the dogs,"
growled Squarcia.</p>
<p>"Let go, then."</p>
<p>As Bellarion stood there, the breeze ruffling the hair about his
neck, the hounds bounded forward. His senses swam, a physical
nausea possessed him. Yet, through swooning reason, he resolved to
offer no resistance, so that this horror might be the sooner ended.
They would leap for his throat, he knew, and so that he let them
have their way, it would speedily be done.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes. He groaned. "Jesus!" And then his lips began
to shape a prayer, the first that occurred to him, mechanically
almost: "In mano tuas, Domine..."</p>
<p>The dogs had reached him. But there was no impact. The eager,
furious leaps with which they started had fallen to a sedate and
hesitating approach. They sniffed the air, and, at close quarters
now, they crouched down, nosing him, their bellies trailing in the
grass, their heavy tails thumping the ground, in an attitude of
fawning submission.</p>
<p>There were cries of amazement from the ducal party. Amazement
filled the soul of Bellarion as he looked down upon those
submissive dogs, and he sought to read the riddle of their
behaviour; thought, indeed, of divine interventions, such as that
by which the saints of God had at times been spared from the
inhumanities of men.</p>
<p>And this, too, was the thought of more than one of the
spectators. It was the thought of the brutal Squarcia, who, rising
from the half-kneeling attitude in which he had remained, now
crossed himself mechanically.</p>
<p>"Miracle!" he cried in a voice that was shaken by supernatural
fears.</p>
<p>But the Duke, looking on with a scowl on his shallow brow, raged
forth at that. The Visconti may never have feared man; but most of
them had feared God. Gian Maria was not even of these.</p>
<p>"We'll test this miracle, by heavens!" he cried; "Loose me two
more dogs, you fool."</p>
<p>"Highness..." Squarcia was beginning a protest.</p>
<p>"Loose two more dogs, or I'll perform a miracle on you."</p>
<p>Squarcia's fear of the Duke overwhelmed his fear of the
supernatural. With fumbling, trembling fingers he did as he was
bidden. Two more dogs were launched against Bellarion, incited by
the Duke himself with his strident voice and a cut of his whip
across their haunches.</p>
<p>But they behaved even as the first had behaved, to the
increasing awe of the beholders, but no longer to Bellarion's awe
or mystification. His wits, recovered from their palsy, had found a
physical explanation for the sudden docility of those ferocious
beasts. Right or wrong, his conclusions satisfied him, and it was
without dread that he heard the Duke raging anew. So long as they
sent only dogs against him, he had no cause for fear.</p>
<p>"Loose Messalina," the Duke was screaming in a frenzy that
thickened his articulation and brought froth and bubbles to his
purple lips.</p>
<p>Squarcia was protesting, as were, more moderately, some of the
members of his retinue. The handsome young man with the falcon
opined that here might be witchcraft, and admonished his highness
to use caution. "Loose Messalina," his highness repeated more
furiously insistent.</p>
<p>"On your highness's head the consequences," cried Squarcia, and
released that ferocious bitch, the fiercest of all the pack.</p>
<p>But whilst she came loping towards him, Bellarion, grown
audacious in his continued immunity, was patting the heads and
flanks of the dogs already about him and speaking to them
coaxingly, in response to which they leapt and barked in
friendliness. When, presently, the terrible Messalina was seen to
behave in the same fashion, the excitement in the Duke's following
shed its last vestige of restraint. Opinions were divided between
those who cried "Miracle!" with the impious yet credulous Squarcia,
and those who cried "Witchcraft!" with Messer Francesco Lonate the
gentleman of the falcon.</p>
<p>In the Duke's own mind some fear began to stir. Whether of God
or Devil only supernatural intervention could explain this
portent.</p>
<p>He spurred forward, his followers moving with him; and
Bellarion, as he looked upon the awe-stricken countenances of that
ducal company, was moved to laughter. Reaction from his palsy of
terror had come in a mental exaltation, like the glow that follows
upon immersion in cold water. He was contemptuous of these fellows,
and particularly of Squarcia and his grooms who, whilst presumably
learned in the ways of dogs, were yet incapable of any surmise by
which this miracle might be naturally explained. Mockery crept into
that laugh of his, a laugh that brought the scowl still lower upon
the countenance of the Duke.</p>
<p>"What spell do you weave, rascal? By what artifice do you do
this?"</p>
<p>"Spells?" Bellarion stood boldly before him. He chose to be
mysterious, to feed their superstition. He answered with a proverb
that made play upon the name he had assumed. "Did I not tell you
that I am Cane? Dog will not eat dog. That is all the magic you
have here."</p>
<p>"An evasion," said Lonate, like one who thinks aloud.</p>
<p>The Duke flashed him a sidelong glance of irritation. "Do I need
to be told?" Then to Bellarion: "This is a trick, rogue. God's
blood! I am not to be fooled. What have you done to my dogs?"</p>
<p>"Deserved their love," said Bellarion, waving a hand to the
great beasts that still gambolled about him.</p>
<p>"Aye, aye, but how?"</p>
<p>"How? Does anyone know how love is deserved of man or beast?
Loose the rest of your pack. There's not a dog in it will do more
than lick my hands. Dogs," he added, again with a hint at
mysteries, "have perceptions oft denied to men."</p>
<p>And Bellarion, yielding to his singular exaltation, laughed
again as he answered: "Ah! Who shall say?"</p>
<p>The Duke empurpled. "Do you mock me, filth?"</p>
<p>Lonate, who was afraid of wizardry, laid a hand upon his arm.
But the Duke shook off that admonitory grasp. "You shall yield me
your secret. You shall so, by the Host!" He turned to the gaping
Squarcia. "Call off the dogs and make this knave fast. Fetch him
along."</p>
<p>On that the Duke rode off with his gentlemen, leaving the grooms
to carry out his orders. They stood off reluctantly, despite
Squarcia's commands, so that in the end, for all his repugnance,
the kennel-master was constrained, himself, to take the task in
hand. He whistled the dogs to heel and left one of his knaves to
leash them again. Then he approached Bellarion almost timidly.</p>
<p>"You heard the orders of his highness," he said in the resigned
voice of one who does a thing because he must.</p>
<p>Bellarion proffered his wrists in silence. The Duke and his
following had almost reached the wood, and were out of earshot.</p>
<p>"It is the Duke who does this," that black-browed scoundrel
excused himself. "I am but the instrument of the Duke." And
cringing a little, he proceeded to do the pinioning, but lightly,
so that the thong should not hurt the prisoner&mdash;a tenderness
exercised probably for the first time in his career as the
villainous servant of a villainous master. His hands trembled at
the task, which again was a thing that had never happened yet. The
truth is that Squarcia was inspired by another fear as great as his
dread of the supernatural. On both counts he desired to stand well
with this young man.</p>
<p>He cast a glance over his shoulder to satisfy himself that the
grooms were out of earshot.</p>
<p>"Be sure," he muttered in his dense black beard, "that his
Excellency the Count of Biandrate shall know of your presence
within an hour of our arrival in Milan."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-02" id="ch-2-02"></a>CHAPTER II. FACINO CANE</h2>
<p>On the ground that they had far to travel, but in reality to
spare this unwelcome prisoner, Bellarion was mounted on the crupper
of Squarcia's great horse, his lightly pinioned wrists permitting
him to hang on by the kennel-master's belt.</p>
<p>Thus he made his first entrance into the fair city of Milan as
dusk was descending. Some impression of the size and strength of it
Bellarion gathered when, a couple of miles away, they made a
momentary halt on a slight eminence in the plain. And though
instruction had prepared him for an imposing spectacle, it had not
prepared for what he actually beheld. He gazed in wonder on the
great spread of those massive red walls, reflected in a broad
navigable moat, which was a continuation of the Ticinello, and,
soaring above these, the spires of a half-dozen churches, among
which he was able from what he had read to identify the slender
belfry of Sant' Eustorgio and the octagonal brick and marble tower,
surmounted by its headless gilded angel, belonging to the church of
Saint Gothard, built in honour of the sainted protector of the
gouty by the gout-ridden Azzo Visconti a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>They entered the city by the Norta Nuova, a vast gateway, some
of whose stonework went back to Roman times, having survived
Barbarossa's vindictive demolition nearly three centuries ago. Over
the drawbridge and through the great archway they came upon a
guardhouse that was in itself a fortress, before whose portals
lounged a group of brawny, bearded mercenaries, who talked loudly
amongst themselves in the guttural German of the Cantons. Then
along Borgo Nuovo, a long street in which palace stood shoulder to
shoulder with hovel and which, though really narrow&mdash;by comparison
with other streets of Milan&mdash;appeared generously broad to
Bellarion. The people moving in this thoroughfare were as oddly
assorted as the dwellings that flanked it. Sedately well-nourished
opulent men of the merchant class, glittering nobles attended by
armed lackeys with blazons on their breasts, some mounted but more
on foot, were mingled here with aproned artisans and with gaunt
ragged wretches of both sexes whose aspect bespoke want and hunger.
For there was little of the old prosperity left in Milan under the
rule of Gian Maria.</p>
<p>Noble and simple alike stood still to bare and incline their
heads as the Duke rode past. But Bellarion, who was sharply using
his eyes, perceived few faces upon which he did not catch a
reflection, however fleeting, of hatred or of dread.</p>
<p>From this long street they emerged at length upon a great open
space that was fringed with elms. On its northern side Bellarion
beheld, amid a titanic entanglement of poles and scaffolding, a
white architectural mass that was vast as a city in itself. He knew
it at a glance for the great cathedral that was to be the wonder of
the world. It rose on the site of the old basilica of Saint
Ambrose, dedicated to Marias Nascenti: a votive offering to the
Virgin Mother for the removal of the curse upon the motherhood of
Milan, as a result of which the women bore no male children, or, if
they bore them, could not bring them forth alive. Gian Galeazzo had
imagined his first wife, the sterile Isabella of Valois, to lie
under the curse. Bellarion wondered what Gian Galeazzo thought of
the answer to that vast prayer in marble when his second wife
Caterina brought forth Gian Maria. There are, Bellarion reflected,
worse afflictions than sterility.</p>
<p>Gian Galeazzo had perished before his stupendous conception
could be brought to full fruition, and under his degenerate son the
work was languishing, and stood almost suspended, a monument as
much to the latter's misrule as to his father's colossal ambition
and indomitable will.</p>
<p>They crossed the great square, which to Bellarion, learned in
the history of the place, was holy ground. Here in the now vanished
basilica the great Saint Augustine had been baptized. Here Saint
Ambrose, that Roman prefect upon whom the episcopate had been
almost forced, had entrenched himself in his great struggle with
the Empress Justina which marked the beginnings of that strife
between Church and Empire still kept alive by Guelph and Ghibbeline
after the lapse of a thousand years.</p>
<p>Flanking the rising cathedral stood the old Broletto,
half-palace, half-stronghold, which from the days of Matteo
Visconti had been the residence of the Lords of Milan.</p>
<p>They rode under the portcullis into the great courtyard of the
Arrengo, which derived a claustral aspect from its surrounding
porticoes, and passed into the inner quadrangle known as the Court
of St. Gothard. Here the company dismounted, and to Lonate, who
held his stirrup for him, Gian Maria issued his orders concerning
the prisoner before entering.</p>
<p>"This bewitcher of dogs," he announced, "should make
entertainment for him after supper."</p>
<p>Bellarion was conducted to a stone cell underground, which was
supplied with air and as much light as would make a twilight of
high moon by a grating high in the massive door. It was very cold
and pervaded by a moist, unpleasant, fungoid odour. The darkness
and chill of the place struck through him gradually to his soul. He
was very hungry, too, which did not help his courage, for he had
eaten nothing since mid-day, and not so much as a crust of bread
did his goalers have the charity to offer him.</p>
<p>At long length&mdash;at the end of two hours or more&mdash;the Duke's
magnificence came to visit him in person. He was attended by Messer
Lonate and four men in leather jerkins, one of whom was Squarcia.
His highness sought to make up in gaudiness of raiment for what he
lacked of natural endowments. He wore a trailing high-necked velvet
houppelande, one half of which was white, the other red, caught
about his waist by a long-tongued belt of fine gold mail that was
studded with great rubies. From waist to ground the long gown fell
open as he moved, showing his legs, which were cased the one in
white the other in scarlet. They were the colours of his house,
colours from which he rarely departed in his wear, following in
this the example set him by his illustrious sire. On his head he
wore a bulging scarlet cap tufted at the side into a jagged upright
mass like a cock's comb.</p>
<p>His goggling eyes measured the prisoner with a glance which
almost sent a shudder through Bellarion.</p>
<p>"Well, rogue? Will you talk now? Will you confess what was the
magic that you used?"</p>
<p>"Lord Duke, I used no magic."</p>
<p>The Duke smiled. "You need a Lenten penance to bring you to a
proper frame of mind. Have you never heard of the Lent of my
invention? It lasts for forty days, and is a little more severe
than mere fasting. But very salutary with obstinate or offending
rogues, and it teaches them such a contempt of life that in the end
they were usually glad to die. We'll make a beginning with you now.
I dare make oath you'll be as sorry that you killed my dogs as that
my dogs did not kill you." He turned to Squarcia. "Bring him
along," he commanded, and stalked stiffly out.</p>
<p>They thrust Bellarion into a larger stone chamber that was as an
anteroom to the cell. Here he now beheld a long wooden engine,
standing high as a table, and composed of two oblong wooden frames,
one enclosed within the other and connected by colossal wooden
screws. Cords trailed from the inner frame.</p>
<p>The Duke growled an order. "Lay the rogue stark."</p>
<p>Without waiting to untruss his points, two of the grooms ripped
away his tunic, so that in a moment he was naked to the waist.
Squarcia stood aloof, seeking to dissemble his superstitious awe,
and expecting calamity or intervention at any moment.</p>
<p>The intervention came. Not only was it of a natural order, but
it was precisely the intervention Squarcia should have been
expecting, since it resulted from the message he had secretly
carried.</p>
<p>The heavy studded door at the top of a flight of three stone
steps swung slowly open behind the Duke, and a man of commanding
aspect paused on the threshold. Although close upon fifty years of
age, his moderately tall and vigorous shapely frame, his tanned
shaven face, squarely cut, with prominent bone structures, his
lively dark eyes and his thick fulvid hair, gave him the appearance
of no more than forty. A gown of mulberry velvet edged with brown
fur was loosely worn over a dress of great richness, a figured
tunic of deep purple and gold with hose of the colour of wine.</p>
<p>A moment he stood at gaze, then spoke in a pleasant, resonant
voice, its tone faintly sardonic.</p>
<p>"Upon what beastliness is your highness now engaged?"</p>
<p>The Duke span round; the grooms stood arrested in their labours.
The gentleman came sedately down the steps.</p>
<p>"Who bade you thither?" the Duke raged at him.</p>
<p>"The voice of duty. First there is my duty as your Governor, to
see that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My Governor!" Sheer fury rang in the echoing words. "My
Governor! You do not govern me, my lord, though you may govern
Milan. And you govern that at my pleasure, you'll remember. I am
the master here. It is I who am Duke. You'll be wise not to forget
it."</p>
<p>"'Perhaps I am not wise. Who shall say what is wisdom?" The tone
continued level, easy, faintly mocking. Here was a man very sure of
himself&mdash;too sure of himself to trouble to engage in argument. "But
there is another duty whose voice I have obeyed&mdash;parental duty. For
they tell me that this prisoner, with whom you are proposing to be
merry after your fashion, claims to be my son."</p>
<p>"They tell you? Who told you?" There was a threat to that
unknown person in the inquiry.</p>
<p>"Can I remember? A court is a place of gossip. When men and
women discover a piece of unusual knowledge they must be airing it.
It doesn't matter. What matters to me is whether you, too, had
heard of this. Had you?" The pleasant voice was suddenly hard: it
was the voice of the master, of the man who holds the whip. And it
intimidated, for whilst the young Duke stormed and blustered and
swore, yet he did so in a measure of defence.</p>
<p>"By the bones of Saint Ambrose! Did you not hear that he slew my
dogs? Slew three of them, and bewitched the others."</p>
<p>"He must have bewitched you, Lord Duke, at the same time, since,
although you heard him claim to be my son, yet you venture to
practise upon him without so much as sending me word."</p>
<p>"Is it not my right? Am I not lord of life and death in my
dominions?"</p>
<p>The dark eyes flashed in that square shaven face. "You are..."
He checked. He waved an imperious hand towards Squarcia Giramo.
"Go, you, and take your curs with you."</p>
<p>"They are here in attendance upon me," the Duke reminded
him.</p>
<p>"But they are required no longer."</p>
<p>"God's light, you grow daily more presumptuous, Facino."</p>
<p>"If you will dismiss them, you may think differently."</p>
<p>The Duke's prominent eyes engaged the other's stern glance,
until, beaten by it, he swung sullenly to his knaves: "Away with
you! Leave us!" Thus he owned defeat.</p>
<p>Facino waited until the men had gone, then quietly admonished
the Duke.</p>
<p>"You set too much store by your dogs. And the sport you make
with them is as dangerous as it is bestial. I have warned your
highness before. One of these days the dogs of Milan will turn upon
you and tear out your throat."</p>
<p>"The dogs of Milan? On me?" His highness almost choked.</p>
<p>"On you, who account yourself lord of life and death. To be Duke
of Milan is not quite the same thing as to be God. You should
remember it." Then he changed his tone. "That man you were hunting
today beyond Abbiate was Francesco da Pusterla, I am told."</p>
<p>"And this rogue who calls himself your son attempted to rescue
him, and slew three of my best dogs..."</p>
<p>"He was doing you good service, Lord Duke. It would have been
better if Pusterla had escaped. As long as you hunt poor miscreants
guilty of theft or violence or of no worse crime than being needy
and hungry, retribution may move slowly against you. But when you
set your dogs upon the sons of a great house you walk the edge of
an abyss."</p>
<p>"Do I so? Do I so? Well, well, my good Facino, as long as a
Pusteria remains above ground, so long shall my hounds be active. I
don't forget that a Pusterla was castellan of Monza when my mother
died there. And you that hear so much gossip about the town and
court must have heard what is openly said: that the scoundrel
poisoned her."</p>
<p>Facino looked at him with such grim significance that the Duke's
high colour faded under the glance. His face grew ashen. "By the
Bones of God!" he was beginning, when Facino interrupted.</p>
<p>"This young man here was not to know your motives. Indeed, he
did not know you were the leader of that vile hunt. All that he saw
was a fellow-creature inhumanly pursued by dogs. None would call me
a gentle, humane man. But I give you my word, Lord Duke, that he
did what in his place I hope I should have had the courage to do
myself. I honour him for it. Apart from that, he told you that his
name was Cane. It is a name that deserves some respect in Milan,
even from the Duke." His voice grew cold and hard as steel. "Hunt
the Pusterla all you please, magnificent, and at your own peril.
But do not hunt the Cane without first giving me warning of the
intention."</p>
<p>He paused. The Duke, slow-witted ever, stood between shame and
rage before him, silent. Facino turned to Bellarion, his tone and
manner expressing contempt of his ducal master. "Come, boy. His
highness gives you leave. Put on your tunic and come with me."</p>
<p>Bellarion had waited in a fascinated amusement that held a deal
of fear, based on the conviction that he escaped Scylla to be
wrecked upon Charybdis. For a long moment he gazed now into that
indolently, good-humoured, faintly mocking countenance. Then, with
mechanical obedience, he took up the garment which had been reduced
almost to rags, and followed the Count of Biandrate from that stone
chamber.</p>
<p>Sedately Facino went up the narrow staircase with no word for
the young man who followed in uneasy wonder and dread speculation
of what was now to follow.</p>
<p>In a fine room that was hung with Flemish tapestries and
otherwise furnished with a richness such as Bellarion had never yet
beheld, lighted by great candles in massive gilt candlesticks that
stood upon the ground, the masterful Facino dismissed a couple of
waiting lackeys, and turned at last to bestow a leisurely scrutiny
upon his companion.</p>
<p>"So you have the impudence to call yourself my son," he said,
between question and assertion. "It seems I have more family than I
suspected. But I felicitate you on your choice of a father. It
remains for you to tell me upon whom I conferred the honour of
being your mother."</p>
<p>He threw himself into a chair, leaving Bellarion standing before
him, a sorry figure in his tattered red tunic pulled closely about
him, his flesh showing in the gaps.</p>
<p>"To be frank, my lord, in my anxiety to avoid a violent death I
overstated our relationship."</p>
<p>"You overstated it?" The heavy eyebrows were raised. The humour
of the countenance became more pronouncedly sardonic. "Let me judge
the extent of this overstatement."</p>
<p>"I am your son by adoption only."</p>
<p>Down came the eyebrows in a frown, and all humour passed from
the face</p>
<p>"Nay, now! That I know for a lie. I might have got me a son
without knowing it. That is always possible. I was young once,
faith, and a little careless of my kisses. But I could scarcely
have adopted another man's child without being aware of it."</p>
<p>And now Bellarion, judging his man, staked all upon the indolent
good-nature, the humorous outlook upon life which he thought to
perceive in Facino's face and voice. He answered him with a studied
excess of frankness.</p>
<p>"The adoption, my lord, was mine; not yours." And then, to
temper the impudence of that, he added: "I adopted you, my lord, in
my hour of peril and of need, as we adopt a patron saint. My wits
were at the end of their resources. I knew not how else to avert
the torture and death to which wanton brutality exposed me, save by
invoking a name in itself sufficiently powerful to protect me."</p>
<p>There was a pause in which Facino considered him, half-angrily,
so that Bellarion's heart sank and he came to fear that in his bold
throw with Fortune he had been defeated. Then Facino laughed
outright, yet there was an edge to his laugh that was not quite
friendly. "And so you adopted me for your father. Why, sir, if
every man could choose his parents&mdash;" He broke off. "Who are you,
rogue? What is your name?"</p>
<p>"I am called Bellarion, my lord."</p>
<p>"Bellarion? A queer name that. And what's your story? Continue
to be frank with me, unless you would have me toss you back to the
Duke for an impostor."</p>
<p>Bellarion took heart, for the phrase implied that if he were
frank this great soldier would befriend him at least to the extent
of furthering his escape. And so Bellarion used an utter frankness.
He told his tale, which was in all respects the true tale which he
had told Lorenzaccio da Trino.</p>
<p>It was, when all is said, an engaging story, and it caught the
fancy of the Lord Facino Cane, as Bellarion, closely watching him,
perceived.</p>
<p>"And in your need you chose to think that this rider who
befriended you was called Facino!" The condottiero smiled now, a
little sardonically. "It was certainly resourceful. But this
business of the Duke's dogs? Tell me what happened there."</p>
<p>Bellarion's tale had gone no farther than the point at which he
had set out from Cigliano on his journey to Pavia. Nor now, in
answer to this question, did he mention his adventure in Montferrat
and the use he had made there already of Facino's name, but came
straight to the events of that day in the meadows by Abbiategrasso.
To this part of his narrative and particularly to that of
Bellarion's immunity from the fierce dogs, Facino listened in
incredulity, although it agreed with the tale he had already
heard.</p>
<p>"What patron did you adopt to protect you there?" he asked,
between seriousness and derision. "Or did you use magic, as they
say."</p>
<p>"I answered the Duke on that score with more literal truth than
he suspected when I told him that dog does not eat dog."</p>
<p>"How? You pretend that the mere name of Cane&mdash;?"</p>
<p>"Oh no. I reeked&mdash;I stank of dog. The great hound I had ripped
up when it was upon me had left me in that condition, and the other
hounds scented nothing but dog in me. The explanation, my lord,
lies between that and miracle."</p>
<p>Facino slowly nodded. "And you do not believe in miracles?" he
asked.</p>
<p>"Your lordship's patience with me is the first miracle I have
witnessed."</p>
<p>"It is the miracle you hoped for when you adopted me as your
father?"</p>
<p>"Nay, my lord. My hope was that you would never hear of the
adoption."</p>
<p>Facino laughed outright. "You're a frank rogue," said he, and
heaved himself up. "Yet it would have gone ill with you if I had
not heard that a son had suddenly been given to me." To Bellarion's
amazement, the great soldier came to set a hand upon his shoulder;
the dark eyes, whose expressions could change so swiftly from
humour to melancholy, looked deeply into his own. "Your attempt to
save Pusterla's life without counting the risk to yourself was a
gallant thing, for which I honour you, and for which you deserve
well of me. And they are to make a monk of you, you say?"</p>
<p>"That is the abbot's hope." Bellarion had flushed a little under
the sudden, unexpected praise and the softening of the voice that
bestowed it. "And it may follow," he added, "when I return from
Pavia."</p>
<p>"The abbot's hope? But is it your own?"</p>
<p>"I begin to fear that it is not."</p>
<p>"By Saint Gothard, you do not look a likely priest. But that is
your own affair." The hand fell from his shoulder. Facino turned
and sauntered away in the direction of the loggia, beyond which the
night glowed luminously blue as a sapphire. "From me you shall have
the protection you invoked when you adopted me, and tomorrow,
well-accredited and equipped, you shall resume the road to Pavia
and your studies."</p>
<p>"You establish, my lord, my faith in miracles," said Bellarion.
Facino smiled as he beat his hands together. Lackeys in his
blue-and-white liveries appeared at once in answer to that summons.
His orders were that Bellarion should be washed and fed, whereafter
they would talk again.</p>
<h2><a name="ch&mdash;03" id="ch-2-03"></a>CHAPTER III. THE COUNTESS OF
BIANDRATE</h2>
<p>Facino Cane and Bellarion talked long together on the night of
their first meeting, and as a result the road to Pavia was not
resumed upon the morrow, nor yet upon the morrow's morrow. It was
written that some years were yet to pass before Bellarion should
see Pavia, and then not at all with the eyes of the student seeking
a seat of learning.</p>
<p>Facino believed that he discovered in the lad certain likenesses
to himself: a rather whimsical, philosophical outlook, a readiness
of wit, and an admirable command of his person such as was unusual
amongst even the most cultured quattrocentists. He discovered in
him, too, a depth and diversity of learning which inspired respect
in one whose own education went little beyond arts of reading and
writing, but who was of an intelligence to perceive the great
realms that lie open to conquest by the mind. He admired, also, the
lad's long, clean-limbed grace and his boldly handsome, vivid
countenance. Had God given him a son, he could not have desired him
other than he found Bellarion. From such a thought in this
childless man&mdash;thrust upon him, perhaps, by the very manner of
Bellarion's advent&mdash;it was but a step to the desire to bind the boy
to himself by those ties of adoption which Bellarion had so
impudently claimed. That step Facino took with the impulsiveness
and assurance that were his chief characteristics. He took it on
the third day of Bellarion's coming, at the end of a frank and
detailed narrative by Bellarion of the events in Montferrat. He had
for audience on that occasion not only Facino, but Facino's young
and languidly beautiful countess. His tale moved them sometimes to
laughter, sometimes to awe, but always to admiration of Bellarion's
shrewdness, resource and address.</p>
<p>"A sly fox the Marquis Theodore," Facino had commented.
"Subtlety curbs ambition in him. Yet his ambition is such that one
of these days it will curb his subtlety, and then Messer Theodore
may reap his deserts. I know him well. Indeed, it was in his
father's service that I learnt the trade of arms. And that's a
better trade for a man than priesthood."</p>
<p>Thus from the subject of Theodore he leapt abruptly to the
subject of Bellarion, and became direct at once. "With those limbs
and those wits of yours, you should agree with that. Will you let
them run to waste in cloisters?"</p>
<p>Bellarion sighed thoughtfully. He scented the inspiration of
that question, which fell so naturally into place in this dream in
which for three days he had been living. It was all so different,
so contrary to anything that he could have imagined at the hands of
this man with whose name he had made free, this man who daily bade
him postpone the resumption of his journey until the morrow.</p>
<p>Softly now, in answer to that question, he quoted the abbot:
"'Pax multa in cela, foris autem plurima bella.' And yet...And yet
is the peace of the cloisters really better than the strife of the
world? Is there not as much service to be done in righting wrongs?
Is not peace stagnation? Are not activity and strife the means by
which a man may make his soul?" He sighed again. His mention of
righting wrongs was no vague expression of an ideal. He had a
particular wrong very vividly in mind.</p>
<p>Facino, watching him almost hungrily, was swift to argue. "Is
not he who immures himself to save his soul akin to the steward who
buried his talents?"</p>
<p>He developed the argument, and passed from it to talk of feats
of arms; of great causes rescued, of nations liberated, of fainting
right upheld and made triumphant.</p>
<p>From broad principles his talk turned, as talk will, to details.
He described encounters and actions, broad tactical movements and
shrewd stratagems. And then, to his amazement, the subject was
caught up, like a ball that is tossed, by Bellarion; and Bellarion
the student was discoursing to him, the veteran of a score of
campaigns and a hundred battles, upon the great art of war. He was
detailing, from Thucydides, the action of the Thebans against
Plataea, and condemning the foolish risk taken by Eurymachus,
showing how the disastrous result of that operation should have
been foreseen by a commander of any real military sense. Next he
was pointing the moral to be drawn from the Spartan invasion of
Attica which left the Peloponessus uncovered to the attack of the
Athenians. From that instance of disastrous impetuosity he passed
to another of a different kind and of recent date in the battle of
Tagliacozzo, and, revealing a close acquaintance with Primatus and
Bouquet, he showed how a great army when it thrust too deeply into
hostile territory must do so always at the risk of being unable to
extricate itself in safety. Then from the broad field of strategy
he ran on, aglow now with a subject of his predilection, to
discourse upon tactics, and chiefly to advocate and defend the more
general use of infantry, to enlarge upon the value of the hedge-hog
for defensive purposes against cavalry, supporting his assertions
by instancing the battle of Sempach and other actions of the
Swiss.</p>
<p>It could not be expected that a great leader like Facino, who
had depended all his life upon the use of cavalry, should agree
with such views as these. Yet the knowledge displayed by this
convent-reared youngster, and the shrewd force and lucidity with
which Bellarion, who had never seen a pitched battle, argued upon
matters that were regarded as mysteries hidden from all but the
initiates in the difficult science of arms, amazed him so
profoundly that he forgot to argue at all.</p>
<p>Facino had learnt the trade of war by actual practice in a long
and hard apprenticeship. It had never even occurred to him that
there was a theory to be learnt in the quiet of the study, to be
culled from the records of past failure and achievement in the
field. Nor now that this was revealed to him was he disposed to
attach to it any considerable importance. He regarded the young
man's disquisitions merely in the light of interesting mental
exercises. Yet, at the same time, he concluded that one who showed
such understanding and critical appreciation of strategy and
tactics should, given the other qualities by Facino considered
necessary, be quick to gather experience and learn the complex
military art. Now, every man who truly loves the trade by which he
lives is eager to welcome a neophyte of real aptitude. And thus
between Facino and Bellarion another link was forged.</p>
<p>Deep down in Bellarion's soul there was that vague desire,
amounting as yet to little more than a fantastic hope, to
consummate his service to the brave Princess of Montferrat. It was
a dream, shadowy, indefinite, almost elusive to his own
consciousness. But the door Facino now held so invitingly open
might certainly lead to its ultimately becoming a reality.</p>
<p>They were occupying at the time the loggia of Facino's
apartments above the court of St. Gothard. Facino and his lady were
seated, one at each end of that open space. Bellarion stood
equi-distant from either, leaning against one of the loggia's
slender pillars that were painted red and white, his back to the
courtyard, which lay peaceful now in the bright sunlight and almost
forsaken, for it was the rest hour of early afternoon. He was
dressed in very courtly fashion in a suit of purple which Facino's
wardrobe had supplied. The kilted tunic was caught about his waist
by a belt of violet leather with gold trimmings, and his long black
hair had been carefully combed and perfumed by one of Facino's
servants. He made a brave figure, and the languid sapphire eyes of
the countess as they surveyed him confirmed for her the conviction
already gathered from his frank and smoothly told tale that between
himself and her husband there existed no relationship such as she
had first suspected, and such as the world in general would
presently presume.</p>
<p>"My Lord Count advises you shrewdly, Ser Bellarion," she
ventured, seeing him thoughtful and wavering. "You make it very
plain that you are not meant for cloisters."</p>
<p>She was a handsome woman of not more than thirty, of middle
height, with something feline in her beautifully proportioned
litheness, and something feline too in the blue-green eyes that
looked with sleepy arrogance from out of her smoothly pallid face
set within a straight frame of ebony-black hair.</p>
<p>Bellarion considered her, and the bold, direct appraising glance
of his hazel eyes, which seemed oddly golden in that light, stirred
an unaccountable uneasiness in this proud daughter of the Count of
Tenda who had married out of ambition a man so much older than
herself. Languidly she moved her fan of peacock feathers, languidly
surveyed herself in the mirror set in the heart of it.</p>
<p>"If I were to await further persuasions I must become
ridiculous," said Bellarion.</p>
<p>"A courtly speech, sir," she replied with her slow smile. Slowly
she rose. "You should make something of him, Facino."</p>
<p>Facino set about it without delay. He was never dilatory when
once he had taken a resolve. They removed themselves next
day&mdash;Facino, his lady, his household and Bellarion&mdash;to the ducal
hunting palace at Abbiategrasso, and there the secular education of
Bellarion was at once begun, and continued until close upon
Christmastide, by when some of the sense of unreality, of dream
experiences, began at last to fade from Bellarion's mind.</p>
<p>He was taught horsemanship and all that concerns the management
of horses. Followed a training in the use of arms, arduous daily
exercises in the tiltyard supervised by Facino himself,
superficially boisterous, impatient; at times even irascible in his
zeal, but fundamentally of an infinite patience. He was taught such
crude swordsmanship as then obtained, an art which was three parts
brute force and one part trickery; he was instructed in ballistics,
trained in marksmanship with the crossbow, informed in the
technicalities of the mangonel, and even initiated into the
mysteries of that still novel weapon the cannon, an instrument
whose effects were moral rather than physical, serving to terrify
by its noise and stench rather than actually to maim. A Swiss
captain in Facino's service, named Stoffel, taught him the uses of
the short but formidable Swiss halbert, and from a Spaniard named
de Soto he learnt some tricks with a dagger.</p>
<p>At the same time he was taken in hand by the countess for
instructions in more peaceful arts. An hour each evening was
devoted to the dance, and there were days when she would ride forth
with him in the open meadows about the Ticino to give him lessons
in falconry, a pursuit in which she was greatly skilled&mdash;too
skilled and too cruelly eager, he thought, for womanhood, which
should be compassionate.</p>
<p>One autumn day when a northerly wind from the distant snows
brought a sting which the bright sunshine scarcely sufficed to
temper, Bellarion and the Countess Beatrice, following the flight
of a falcon that had been sent soaring to bring down a
strong-winged heron, came to the edge of an affluent of the Ticino,
now brown and swollen from recent rains, on the very spot where
Duke Gian Maria had loosed his hounds upon Bellarion.</p>
<p>They brought up there perforce just as overhead the hawk stooped
for the third time. Twice before it had raked wide; but now a
hoarse cry from the heron announced the strike almost before it
could be seen, then both birds plumbed down to earth, the spread of
the falcon's great wings steadying the fall.</p>
<p>One of the four grooms that followed sprang down, lure in hand,
to recapture the hawk and retrieve the game.</p>
<p>Bellarion looked on in silence with brooding eyes, heedless of
the satisfaction the countess was expressing with almost childish
delight.</p>
<p>"A brave kill! A brave kill!" she reiterated, and looked to him
in vain for agreement. A frown descended upon the white brow of
that petulant beauty, rendered by vanity too easily sensitive to
disapproval and too readily resentful. Directly she challenged him.
"Was it not a brave kill, Bellarion?"</p>
<p>He roused himself from his abstraction, and smiled a little. He
found her petulance amusing ever, and commonly provoked her by the
display of his amusement.</p>
<p>"I was thinking of another heron that almost fell a victim
here." And he told her that this was the spot on which he had met
the dogs.</p>
<p>"So that we're on holy ground," said she, enough resentment
abiding to provide the sneer.</p>
<p>But it went unheeded. "And from that my thoughts ran on to other
things." He pointed across the river. "That way I came from
Montferrat."</p>
<p>"And why so gloomy about that? You've surely no cause to regret
your coming."</p>
<p>"All cause, indeed, for thankfulness. But one day I shall hope
to return, and in strength enough to hood a hawk that's stooping
there."</p>
<p>"That day is not yet. Besides, the sun is sinking, and we're far
from home. So if you're at the end of your dreams we had best be
moving."</p>
<p>There was a tartness in her tone that did not escape him. It had
been present lately whenever Montferrat was mentioned. It arose, he
conceived, from some misunderstanding which he could not fathom.
Either to fathom or to dispel it, he talked now as they rode,
unfolding all that was in his mind, more than he knew was in his
mind, until actual utterance discovered it for him.</p>
<p>"Are you telling me that you have left your heart in
Montferrat?" she asked him.</p>
<p>"My heart?" He looked at her and laughed. "In a sense you may
say that. I have left a tangle which I desire one day to unravel.
If that is to have left my heart there..." He paused.</p>
<p>"A Perseus to deliver Andromeda! A complete knight-errant aflame
to ride in the service of beauty in duress! Oh, you shall yet live
in an epic."</p>
<p>"But why so bitter, lady?</p>
<p>"Bitter? I? I laugh, sir, that is all."</p>
<p>"You laugh. And the matter is one for tears, I think."</p>
<p>"The matter of your love-sickness for Valeria of
Montferrat?"</p>
<p>"My..." He gasped and checked, and then he, who a moment ago had
gently chided her for laughing, himself laughed freely.</p>
<p>"You are merry on a sudden, sir!"</p>
<p>"You paint a comic picture, dear Madonna, and I must laugh.
Bellarion the nameless in love with a princess! Have you discovered
any other signs of madness in me?"</p>
<p>He was too genuinely merry for deceit, she thought, and looked
at him sideways under her long lashes.</p>
<p>"If it is not love that moves you to these dreams, what
then?"</p>
<p>His answer came very soberly, austerely. "Whatever it may be,
love it certainly is not, unless it be love of my own self. What
should I know of love? What have I to do with love?"</p>
<p>"There speaks the monk they almost made of you. I vow you
shuddered as you spoke the word. Did the fathers teach you the
monkish lie that love is to be feared?"</p>
<p>"Of love, Madonna, they taught me nothing. But instinct teaches
me to endeavour not to be grotesque. I am Bellarion the nameless,
born in squalor, cradled in a kennel, reared by charity&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Beatific modesty! Saintly humility. 'Even as the dust am I',
you cry in false self-abasement that rests on pride of what you are
become, of what you may yet become, pride of the fine tree grown
from such mean soil. Survey yourself, Bellarion."</p>
<p>"That, lady, is my constant endeavour."</p>
<p>"But you bring no honesty to the task, and so your vision's
warped."</p>
<p>"Should I be honest if I magnified myself in my own eyes?"</p>
<p>"Magnified? Why, where's the need? Was Facino more than you are
when he was your age? His birth could not have been less lowly, and
he had not the half of your endowments, not your beauty, nor your
learning, nor your address."</p>
<p>"Lady, you will make me vain."</p>
<p>"Then I shall advance your education. There is Ottone Buonterzo,
who was Facino's brother-in-arms. Like you, he, too, was born in
the mud. But he kept his gaze on the stars. Men go whither they
look, Bellarion. Raise your eyes, boy."</p>
<p>"And break my nose in falling over the first obstacle in my
path."</p>
<p>"Did they do this? Ottone is Tyrant of Parma, a sovereign
prince. Facino could be the same if his heart were big enough. Yet
in other things he did not want for boldness. He married me, for
instance, the only daughter of the Count of Tenda, whose rank is
hardly less than that, of your lady of Montferrat. But perhaps she
is better endowed. Perhaps she is more beautiful than I am. Is
she?"</p>
<p>"Lady," said Bellarion, "I have never seen anyone more beautiful
than you." The slow solemnity of his delivery magnified and
transformed the meaning of his words.</p>
<p>A scarlet flush swept across the ivory pallor of the countess.
She veiled her eyes behind lids which were lowered until the long
lashes swept her cheek; a little smile crept into the corners of
her full and perfect lips. She reached out a hand and momentarily
let it rest upon his own as he rode beside her.</p>
<p>"That is the truth, Bellarion?"</p>
<p>He was a little bewildered to see so much emotion evoked so
lightly. It testified, he thought, to a consuming vanity.</p>
<p>"The truth," he said shortly and simply.</p>
<p>She sighed and smiled again. "I am glad&mdash;so glad to have you
think well of me. It is what I have desired of you, Bellarion. But
I have been afraid. Afraid that your Princess of Montferrat
might...supply an obstacle."</p>
<p>"Could any supply an obstacle? I scarcely understand. All that I
have and am I owe to my Lord Count. Am I an ingrate that I could be
less than your slave, yours and my Lord Count's?"</p>
<p>She looked at him again, and now she was oddly white, and there
was a hard brightness in her eyes which a moment ago had been so
soft and melting.</p>
<p>"Oh! You talk of gratitude!" she said.</p>
<p>"Of what else?"</p>
<p>"Of what else, indeed? It is a great virtue, gratitude; and a
rare. But you have all the virtues. Have you not, Bellarion?"</p>
<p>He fancied that she sneered.</p>
<p>They passed from the failing sunlight into the shadows of the
wood. But the chill that fell between them was due to deeper
causes.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-2-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. THE CHAMPION</h2>
<p>Facino Cane took his ease at Abbiategrasso in those declining
days of 1407, and zestfully devoted himself to the training and
education of Bellarion. It was the first rest the great soldier had
known in ten years, a rest he would never have taken but for the
novel occupation which Bellarion provided him. For Facino was of
those who find no peace in utter idleness. He was of a restless,
active mind, and, being no scholar, found no outlet for his energy
save in physical directions. Here at Abbiategrasso, away from
turbulence, and able for the first time since Gian Galeazzo's death
to live without being perpetually on guard, he confessed himself
happier than he could remember to have been.</p>
<p>"If this were life," he said to Bellarion one evening as they
sauntered, through the parklands where the red deer grazed, "a man
might be content."</p>
<p>"Content," said Bellarion, "is stagnation. And man was not made
for that. I am coming to perceive it. The peace of the convent is
as the peace of the pasture to the ox."</p>
<p>Facino smiled. "Your education progresses."</p>
<p>"I have left school," said Bellarion. "You relish this lull in
your activities as a tired man relishes sleep. But no man would be
glad to sleep his life away."</p>
<p>"Dear philosopher, you should write a book of such sayings for
man's entertainment and information."</p>
<p>"I think I'll wait until I am a little older. I may change my
mind again."</p>
<p>It was not destined that the rest by which Facino was setting
such store should endure much longer. Rumours of trouble in Milan
began to reach them daily, and in the week before Christmas, on a
morning when a snowstorm kept them within doors about a great
hissing fire in the main hall, Facino wondered whether he should
not be returning.</p>
<p>The bare suggestion seemed to anger his countess, who sat
brooding in a chair of brown walnut set at one of the corners of
the hearth.</p>
<p>"I thought you said we should remain here until spring." Her
tone revealed the petulance that was ever just under the surface of
her nature.</p>
<p>"I was not to know," he answered her, "that in the meantime the
duchy would go to pieces."</p>
<p>"Why should you care? It is not your duchy. Though a man might
have made it so by this."</p>
<p>"To make you a duchess, eh?" Facino smiled. His tone was quiet,
but it bore the least strain of bitterness. This was an old
argument between them, though Bellarion heard it now for the first
time. "There are obstacles supplied by honour. Shall I enumerate
them?"</p>
<p>"I know them by heart, your obstacles of honour." She thrust out
a lip that was very full and red, suggesting the strong life within
her. "They did not suffice to curb Pandolfo or Buonterzo, and they
are at least as well born as you."</p>
<p>"We will leave my birth out of the discussion, Madonna."</p>
<p>"Your reluctance to be reminded of it is natural enough," she
insisted with malice.</p>
<p>He turned away and moved across to one of the tall mullioned
windows, trailing his feet through the pine-needles and slim boughs
of evergreens with which the floor was strewn in place of rushes,
unprocurable at this season of the year. His thumbs were thrust
into the golden girdle that cinctured his houppelande of crimson
velvet edged with lynx fur.</p>
<p>He stood a moment in silence, his broad square shoulders to the
room, looking out upon the wintry landscape.</p>
<p>"The snow is falling more heavily," he said at last.</p>
<p>But even upon that her malice fastened. "It will be falling
still more heavily in the hills about Bergamo where Pandolfo
rules&mdash;"</p>
<p>He span round to interrupt her, and his voice rasped with
sarcasm.</p>
<p>"And not quite so heavily in the plain about Piazenza, where
Ottone Buonterzo is tyrant. If you please, Madonna, we will change
the subject."</p>
<p>"I do not please."</p>
<p>"But I do." His voice beat upwards to the tones that had reduced
whole squadrons to instant obedience.</p>
<p>The lady laughed, and none too tunefully. She drew her rich
cloak of ermine more closely about her shapely figure.</p>
<p>"And of course what you please is ever to be the law. We come
when you please, and we depart again as soon as you are tired of
country solitude."</p>
<p>He stared at her frowning, a little puzzled. "Why, Bice," he
said slowly, "I never before knew you attached to Abbiategrasso.
You have ever made a lament of being brought hither, and you
deafened me with your complaints three months ago when we left
Milan."</p>
<p>"Which, nevertheless, did not restrain you from forcing me to
come."</p>
<p>"That does not answer me." He advanced towards her. "What is
this sudden attachment to the place? Why this sudden reluctance to
return to the Milan you profess to love, the gaieties of the court
in which you strain to shine?"</p>
<p>"I have come to prefer peace, if you must know, you must have
reason for all things. Besides, the court is not gay these days.
And I am reminded there of what it might be; of what you might make
it if you had a spark of real spirit. There's not one of them&mdash;not
Buonterzo, nor Pandolfo, nor dal Verme nor Appiano&mdash;who would not
be Duke by now if he had the chance accorded to you by the people's
love."</p>
<p>Bellarion marvelled to see him still curb himself before this
display of shameless cupidity.</p>
<p>"The people's love is mine, Bice, because the people believe me
to be honest and loyal. That faith would leave them the moment I
became a usurper, and I should have to rule by terror, with an iron
hand, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"So that you ruled..." she was interrupting him when he swept
on:</p>
<p>"I should be as detested as is Gian Maria today. I should have
wars on my hands on every side, and the duchy would become a parade
ground."</p>
<p>"It was so in Gian Galeazzo's early days. Yet upon that he built
the greatness of Milan and his own. A nation prospers by victorious
war."</p>
<p>"Today Milan is impoverished. Gian Maria's misrule has brought
her down. However you squeeze her citizens, you cannot make them
yield what they lack&mdash;the gold that will hire and furnish troops to
defend her from a general attack. But for that would Pandolfo and
Buonterzo and the others have dared what they have dared? I have
made you Countess of Biandrate, my lady, and you'll rest content
with that. My duty is to the son of the man to whom I owe all that
I have."</p>
<p>"Until that same son hires someone to murder you. What loyalty
does he give you in return? How often has he not tried to shake you
from the saddle?"</p>
<p>"I am not concerned so much with what he is as with what I
am."</p>
<p>"Shall I tell you what you are?" She leaned towards him,
contempt and anger bringing ageing lines into her lovely white
face.</p>
<p>"If it will ease you, lady, you may tell me what you think I am.
A woman's breath will neither make nor unmake me."</p>
<p>"A fool, Facino!"</p>
<p>"My patience gives proof of that, I think. Do you thank God for
it."</p>
<p>And on that he wheeled and sauntered out of the long grey
room.</p>
<p>She sat huddled in the chair, her elbows on her knees, her dark
blue eyes on the flames that leapt about the great sizzling logs.
After a white she spoke.</p>
<p>"Bellarion!"</p>
<p>There was no answer. She turned. The long high-backed form on
which he had sat over against the wall was vacant. The room was
empty. She shrugged impatiently and swung again to the fire.</p>
<p>"And he's a fool too. A blind fool," she informed the
flames.</p>
<p>It was dinner-time when they returned together. The table was
spread, and the lackeys waited.</p>
<p>"When you have dined, Madonna," Facino quietly informed her,
"you will prepare to leave. We return to Milan today."</p>
<p>"Today!" There was dismay in her voice. "Oh! You do this to vex
me, to assert your mastership. You&mdash;"</p>
<p>His raised hand interrupted her. It held a letter&mdash;a long
parchment document. He dismissed the servants then briefly told her
his news.</p>
<p>There was trouble in Milan, dire trouble. Estorre Visconti,
Bernabo's bastard, together with the young Giovanni Carlo,
Bernabo's grandson, were harassing the city in the Ghibbeline
interest. In a recent raid Estorre had fired the quarter about the
Ticinese Gate. There was want in the city, and this, added to
insecurity, was rendering the citizens mutinous. And now, to crown
all, was news that, taking advantage of the distress and unrest,
Ottone Buonterzo was raising an army to invade the duchy.</p>
<p>"It is Gabriello who writes, and in the Duke's interest begs me
to return immediately and take command."</p>
<p>"Command!" She laughed. "And the faithful lackey runs to serve
his master. You deserve that Buonterzo should whip you again as he
whipped you a year ago. If he does, I have a notion who will be
Duke of Milan. He's a man this Buonterzo."</p>
<p>"When he's Duke of Milan, Bice, I shall be dead," said Facino
smiling. "So you may marry him then, become his duchess, and be
taught how to behave to a husband. Call the servants,
Bellarion."</p>
<p>They dined in haste, a brooding silence presiding over the meal,
and within an hour of dining they were ready to set out.</p>
<p>There was a mule litter for the countess, horses for Facino and
Bellarion, a half-dozen mounted grooms, and a score of lances to
serve as escort. The company of a hundred Swiss, which Facino had
taken with him to Abbiategrasso, were to follow on the morrow under
their own captain, Werner von Stoffel, to guard the baggage which
would be brought in bullock-carts.</p>
<p>But at the last moment Facino, who since rising from table had
worn a thoughtful, undecided air, drew Bellarion aside.</p>
<p>"Here's a commission for you, boy," he said, and drew a letter
from his breast. "Take ten lances for escort, and ride hard for
Genoa with this letter for Boucicault, who is Vicar there for the
King of France. Deliver it in person, and at need supplement it.
Listen: It is to request from him the hire of a thousand French
lances. I have offered him a fair price in this letter. But he's a
greedy fellow, and may require more. You have authority, at need,
to pledge my word for twice the sum stated. I am taking no risks
this time with Buonterzo. But do not let Boucicault suspect that we
are menaced or he will adapt the price to our need. Let him suppose
that I require the men for a punitive expedition against some of
the rebellious Milanese fiefs."</p>
<p>Bellarion asked a question or two, and then professed himself
not only ready, but honoured by the trust reposed in him.</p>
<p>They embraced, and parted, Facino to mount and ride away,
Bellarion to await the groom who was to fetch his horse and Werner
von Stoffel who was to detail the men for his special escort.</p>
<p>As Facino gave the word to ride, the countess thrust her head
between the leather curtains of her litter.</p>
<p>"Where is Bellarion?"</p>
<p>"He does not ride with us."</p>
<p>"He doesn't...? You are leaving him at Abbiate?"</p>
<p>"No. But I have other work for him. I am sending him on a
mission."</p>
<p>"Other work?" Her usually sleepy eyes grew wide awake and round.
"What work?"</p>
<p>"Nothing that will imperil him." He spurred his horse forward to
avoid further questions. "Push on there!"</p>
<p>They reached Milan as dusk was falling, and the snow had ceased.
They entered by Porta Nuova, and went at a trot through the slush
and filth of the borgo. But miraculously the word of Facino's
coming ran ahead. They found the great square thronged with people
who had turned out to acclaim him.</p>
<p>Never yet, since Gian Galeazzo's death, had it happened to
Facino to enter Milan unacclaimed. But never yet had he received so
terrific a manifestation of affection and good will as this. It
expressed reaction from the terror sown by a rumour lately current
that even Facino had at last forsaken Gian Maria's service, leaving
the people at the mercy of their maniacal Duke and of such men as
della Torre and Lonate as well as of the enemies now known to be
rising against them. Facino was the people's only hope. In war he
had proved himself a bulwark. In peace he had been no less their
champion, for he had known how to curb the savagery of his master
and how to bring some order out of the chaos into which Gian
Maria's misrule was plunging the duchy.</p>
<p>His presence now in the very hour of crisis, in one of the
darkest hours which Gian Maria's dark reign had provided for them,
uplifted them on wings of confidence to exaggerated heights of
hope.</p>
<p>As the thunders of the acclamations rolled across the great
square to the Old Broletto, from one of whose windows the Duke
looked down upon his people, Facino, bareheaded, his fulvid hair
tossed by the breeze, his square-cut, shaven face looking oddly
youthful for his fifty years, smiled and nodded, whilst his
countess, drawing back the curtains of her litter, showed herself
too, and for Facino's sake was acclaimed with him.</p>
<p>As the little troop reached the gateway Facino raised his eyes
and met the glance of the Duke at the window above. Its malevolence
dashed the glow from his spirit. And he had a glimpse of the
swarthy saturnine countenance of della Torre, who was looking over
Gian Maria's shoulder.</p>
<p>They rode under the gloomy archway and the jagged teeth of the
portcullis, across the Court of the Arrengo and into the Court of
Saint Gothard. Here they drew up, and it was a gentleman of Milan
and a Guelph, one of the Aliprandi, who ran forward to hold the
stirrup of Facino, the Ghibbeline champion.</p>
<p>Facino went in his turn to assist his countess to alight. She
leaned on his arm more heavily than was necessary. She raised her
eyes to his, and he saw that they were aswim with tears. In a
subdued but none the less vehement voice she spoke to him.</p>
<p>"You saw! You heard! And yet you doubt. You hesitate&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I neither doubt nor hesitate," he quietly answered. "I know
where my path lies, and I follow it."</p>
<p>She made a noise in her throat. "And at the window Gian Maria
and that other. Did you see them?"</p>
<p>"I saw. I am not afraid. It would need more courage than theirs
to express in deeds their hatred. Besides, their need of me is too
urgent."</p>
<p>"One day it may not be so."</p>
<p>"Let us leave that day until it dawn."</p>
<p>"Then it will be too late. This is your hour. Have they not told
you so?"</p>
<p>"They have told me nothing that I did not know already&mdash;those in
the streets and those at the window. Come, Madonna."</p>
<p>And the countess, raging as she stepped beside him, from between
her teeth cursed the day when she had mated with a man old enough
to be her father who at the same time was a fool.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-05" id="ch-2-05"></a>CHAPTER V. THE COMMUNE OF
MILAN</h2>
<p>"They deafen us with their acclamations of you, those sons of
dogs!"</p>
<p>Thus the Duke, in angry greeting of the great condottiero, who
was the last of his father's captains to stand beside him in his
hour of need. Nor did he leave it there. "Me they distracted with
their howling lamentations when I rode abroad this morning. They
need a lesson in loyalty, I think. I'll afford it them one of these
fine days. I will so, by the bones of St. Ambrose! I'll show them
who is Duke of Milan."</p>
<p>There was a considerable concourse in the spacious chamber known
as the Hall of Galeazzo, in which the Duke received the
condottiero; and as Facino's wide-set dark eyes raked their ranks
he perceived at once the influence that had been at work during the
few months of absence. Here at the Duke's elbow was the sinister
della Torre, the leader of the Guelphic party, the head of the
great house of the Torriani, who had striven once with the Visconti
for supremacy in Milan, and in the background wherever he might
look Facino saw only Guelphs: Casati, Bigli, Aliprandi, Biagi,
Porri, and others. They were at their ease, and accompanied by
wives and daughters, these men who two years ago would not have
dared come within a mile of the Visconti palace. Indeed, the only
noteworthy Ghibbeline present, and he a man so amiably weak as to
count for little in any party, was the Duke's natural brother,
Gabriello Maria, the son who had inherited the fine slender height,
good looks and red gold hair of Gian Galeazzo. Facino was moved to
anger.</p>
<p>"The people perceive in me the possible saviour of your duchy."
He was smiling, but his eyes were hard. "It is well to propitiate
those who have the power to serve us."</p>
<p>"Do you reprove his highness?" wondered della Torre, scowling.
"Do you boast your power?" growled the Duke.</p>
<p>"I rejoice in it since it is to be used in your potency's
service, unlike Buonterzo's which is being used against you."</p>
<p>Behind Facino his countess watched, and inwardly smiled. These
fools were stirring her lord, it seemed, where she could not stir
him.</p>
<p>Gabriello, however, interposed to clear the air. "And you are
very welcome, Lord Count; your coming is most timely."</p>
<p>The Duke flashed him a sidelong glance and grunted: "Huh!"</p>
<p>But Gabriello went on, his manner affable and courtly. "And his
highness is grateful to you for the despatch you have used in
responding to his call."</p>
<p>After all, as titular governor, Gabriello spoke with the voice
of authority, in matters of administration being even superior to
the Duke. And Facino, whose aim was far from provocative, was glad
enough to pass through the door Gabriello held for him.</p>
<p>"My despatch is natural enough since I have no object but the
service of his highness and the duchy."</p>
<p>Later, however, when Facino attended a council that evening to
determine measures a certain asperity was again his tone.</p>
<p>He came to the business exacerbated by another scene with his
countess in which again she had upbraided him for not dealing with
these men as their ill-will deserved by seizing upon the duchy for
himself.</p>
<p>Della Torre's undisguised malice, the Duke's mean, vindictive,
unreasoning jealousy, scarcely held in curb even by his needs, and
Gabriello's hopeless incompetence, almost drove Facino to conclude
that Beatrice was in the right and that he was a fool to continue
to serve where he might command.</p>
<p>Trouble came when the question arose of the means at their
disposal to resist Buonterzo, and Gabriello announced that the
whole force under their hands amounted to the thousand mercenaries
of Facino's own condotta commanded by his lieutenant, Francesco
Busone of Carmagnola, and some five hundred foot made up of
Milanese levies.</p>
<p>Facino denounced this force as utterly inadequate, and informed
the Council that to supplement it he had sent to Boucicault for a
thousand men.</p>
<p>"A thousand men!" Gabriello was aghast, and so were the others.
"But a thousand men will cost the treasury&mdash;"</p>
<p>Facino interrupted him. "I have offered fifteen gold florins a
month for each man and fifty for the officer commanding them. But
my messenger is authorized to pay twice that sum if necessary."</p>
<p>"Fifteen thousand florins and perhaps thirty thousand! Why,
you're surely mad! That is twice the sum contributed by the
Commune. Whence is the remainder to come? His highness's allowance
is but two thousand five hundred florins a month."</p>
<p>"The Commune must be made to realize that the duchy is in danger
of utter shipwreck. If Buonterzo sacks Milan it will cost them
fifty times the hire of these troops. So they must provide the
means to defend it. It is your business, my lord, as one of the
ducal governors, to make that clear to them."</p>
<p>"They will take the view that this levy is far beyond the needs
of the case."</p>
<p>"You must persuade them of their error."</p>
<p>Gabriello became impatient in his turn. "How can I persuade them
of what I do not, myself, believe? After all, Buonterzo cannot be
in great strength. I doubt if his whole force amounts to more than
a thousand men."</p>
<p>"You doubt!" Facino stormed now, and banged the table in his
wrath "Am I to get myself and my condotta cut to pieces because you
allow conjecture to fill the place of knowledge? You set my
reputation on the board in your reckless gambling."</p>
<p>"Your reputation stands high, Lord Count," Gabriello sought to
mollify him.</p>
<p>"But how long will you let it stand so? I shall presently be
known for improvidence and carelessness in estimating the enemy
forces and in opposing my troops to impossible odds. Once I am
given that character, where do you think I shall be able to hire
men to follow me? Mercenaries who make a trade of war do not go
into battle to get themselves slaughtered and they do not follow
leaders under whom this happens. That, my lord, you should know. I
suffered enough last year against this same Buonterzo, when your
reckless lack of information sent me with six hundred men to meet
his four thousand. Then, as now, you argued that he was in small
strength. That is not an error into which a condottiero is suffered
to fall twice. Let it happen again and I shall never be able to
raise another condotta."</p>
<p>Gian Maria laughed softly, secretly nudged by della Torre.
Facino span round on his stool to face him, and he was white with
anger, for he read the meaning of that laugh. In his stupid
jealousy the loutish prince would actually welcome such a
consummation, unable to perceive its inevitable consequence to
himself.</p>
<p>"Your highness laughs! You will not laugh when it is
accomplished. You will discover that when there is an end to me as
a condottiero, there will be an end to your highness as Duke of
Milan. Do you think these will save you?" And rising in his passion
he swept a hand to indicate Gabriello, della Torre and Lonate. "Who
will follow Gabriello when he takes the field? All the world knows
that his mother was a better soldier than he and that when she died
he could not hold Pisa. And how will these two poor pimps who fawn
upon you serve you in your need?"</p>
<p>Gian Maria, livid with anger, was on his feet, too, by now. "By
heavens! Facino, if you had dared say the half of this before my
father's face, your head would have been on the Broletto
Tower."</p>
<p>"If I had said it before him I should have deserved no less. I
should deserve no less if I did not say it now. We need plain
speaking here to clear away these vapours of suspicion and
ill-will."</p>
<p>Gian Maria's wits, which ever worked sluggishly and crookedly,
were almost paralyzed now under the eyes of this stern soldier.
Facino had ever been able to whistle him to heel, which was the
thing he most detested in Facino. It was an influence which lately,
during Facino's absence, he had been able to shake off. But he
found himself cowed now, despite the support he received from the
presence of Facino's enemies.</p>
<p>It was della Torre who answered for him.</p>
<p>"Is that a threat, Lord Count? Dare you suggest to his highness
that you might follow the example of Buonterzo and the others? You
plead for plain speaking. Be plain, then, so that his highness may
know precisely what is in your mind."</p>
<p>"Aye!" cried his highness, glad enough to be supplied with this
command. "Be plain."</p>
<p>Facino controlled his wrath until he found it transmuted into
contempt.</p>
<p>"Does your highness heed this witling? Did it require the
welcome given me today to prove my loyalty?"</p>
<p>"To prove it? How does it prove it?"</p>
<p>"How?" Facino looked at the others, taking his time to answer.
"I I had a disloyal thought, all I need is to go down into the
streets and unfurl my banner. The banner of the dog. How long, do
you think, would the banner of the snake be seen in Milan after
that?"</p>
<p>Gian Maria sat down abruptly, making incoherent noises in his
throat, like a hound snarling over a bone. The other three,
however, came to their feet, and della Torre spoke the thought of
all.</p>
<p>"A subject who proclaims himself a danger to his prince has
forfeited the right to live."</p>
<p>But Facino laughed at them. "To it, then, sirs," he invited.
"Out with your daggers. There are three of you, and I am almost
unarmed." He paused and smiled into their sullen eyes. "You
hesitate. You realize, I see, that, having done it, you would need
to make your souls and prepare yourself to be torn in pieces by the
mob." He turned again to the Duke, who sat glowering. "If I boast
the power which comes to me from the people's love, it is that your
highness may fully appreciate a loyalty which has not thought of
using that power but to uphold your rights. These councillors of
yours, who have profited by my absence to inspire in you black
thoughts against me, take a different view. I will leave your
highness to deliberate with them."</p>
<p>He stalked out with a dignity which left them in confusion.</p>
<p>At last it was della Torre who spoke. "A hectoring bully,
swollen with pride! He forces his measures down our throats,
commits us to extravagance whose only purpose is to bolster his
reputation as a condottiero, and proposes to save the duchy from
ruin in one day by ruining it as effectively another."</p>
<p>But Gabriello, weak and incompetent though he might be, and
although sore from Facino's affronts, yet realized the
condottiero's indubitable worth and recognized the cardinal fact
that a quarrel with him now would mean the end of all of them. He
said so, thereby plunging his half-brother into deeper
mortification and stirring his two fellow-councillors into
resentful opposition.</p>
<p>"What he is doing we could do without him," said Lonate. "Your
highness could have hired these men from Boucicault and used them
to put down Facino's insolence at the same time as
Buonterzo's."</p>
<p>But Gabriello showed him the weakness of his argument. "Who
would have led them? Do you dream that Boucicault would hire out
the troops of the King of France without full confidence in their
leader? As Facino himself says, mercenaries do not hire themselves
out to be slaughtered."</p>
<p>"Boucicault himself might have been hired," suggested the
fop.</p>
<p>"At the price of setting the heel of the King of France upon our
necks. No no." Gabriello was emphatic, which did not, however,
restrain della Torre from debating the point with him.</p>
<p>In the midst of the argument Gian Maria, who had sat gnawing his
nails in silence, abruptly heaved himself up.</p>
<p>"A foul plague on you and your wrangles! I am sick of both.
Settle it as you like. I've something better to do than sit here
listening to your vapourings." And he flung out of the room in
quest of the distractions which his vapid spirit was ever
craving.</p>
<p>In his absence those three, the weakling, the fop and the
schemer, settled the fortunes of his throne. Della Torre, realizing
that the moment was not propitious for intrigue against Facino,
yielded to Gabriello. It was decided that the Commune's
confirmation should be sought for Facino's action in increasing his
condotta.</p>
<p>So Gabriello summoned the Communal Council, and, because he
feared the worst, demanded the maximum sum of thirty thousand
florins monthly for Facino's troops.</p>
<p>The Commune of Milan, so impoverished by the continuous
rebellious depredations of the last five years, was still wrangling
over the matter, its members were still raising their hands and
wagging their heads, when, three days later, Bellarion rode into
Milan with a thousand horse, made up chiefly of Gascons and
Burgundians, and captained by one of Boucicault's lieutenants, an
amiable gentleman named Monsieur de la Tour de Cadillac.</p>
<p>The people's fear of storm and pillage, whilst diminished by
Facino's presence, was not yet entirely subdued. Hence there was a
glad welcome for the considerable accretion to the defensive
strength represented by this French legion.</p>
<p>That gave the Commune courage, and presently it was also to be
afforded relief upon hearing that not thirty thousand florins
monthly, as Gabriello Maria Visconti had stated, but fifteen
thousand, was to be the stipend of the French lances.</p>
<p>Facino was delightedly surprised when he learnt this from
Bellarion.</p>
<p>"You must have found that French pedlar in a singularly easy
humour that he should have let you have the men on my own terms:
and low terms they are."</p>
<p>Bellarion rendered his accounts.</p>
<p>"I found him anything but easy, and we spent the best part of
two days haggling. He began by laughing at your offer; described it
as impudent; wondered if you took him for a fool. Thereupon I made
shift to take my leave of him. That sobered him. He begged me not
to be hasty; confessed that he could well spare the men; but that I
must know the price was not more than half the worth of his
soldiers. At thirty florins a month for each man he would appoint a
leader for them at his own charges. I said little beyond asserting
that no such price was possible: that it was beyond the means of
the Commune of Milan. He then proposed twenty-five florins, and
finally twenty, below which he swore by all the Saints of France
that he would not go. I begged him to take time for thought, and as
the hour was late to let me know his decision in the morning. But
in the morning I sent him a note of leave-taking, informing him
that as his terms were beyond our means and, as our need was none
too pressing, I was setting out for the Cantons to raise the men
there."</p>
<p>Facino's mouth fell open. "Body of God! That was a risk!"</p>
<p>"No risk at all. I had the measure of the man. He was so
covetous, so eager to drive the bargain, that I almost believe I
could have got the men for less than your price if you had not
stated it in writing. I was not suffered to depart. He sent a
messenger to beg me wait upon him before leaving Genoa, and the
matter was concluded on your terms. I signed the articles in your
name and parted such good friends with the French Vicar that he
presented me with a magnificent suit of armour as an earnest of his
esteem of Facino Cane and Facino Cane's son."</p>
<p>Facino loosed his great full-throated laugh over the
discomfiture of the crafty Boucicault, slapped Bellarion's
shoulder, commended his guile, and carried him off at once to the
Palace of the Ragione in the New Broletto, where the Council
awaited him.</p>
<p>By one of six gates that pierced this vast walled enclosure,
which was the seat of Milan's civic authority, they came upon the
mulitude assembled there and to the Palace of the Ragione in its
middle. This was little more than a great hall carried upon an open
portico to which access was gained by an exterior stone staircase.
As they went up, Bellarion, to whom the place was new, looked over
the heads of the clamorous multitude in admiring wonder at the
beautiful loggia of the Os with its delicately pointed arcade in
black and white marble and its parapet hung with the shields of the
several quarters of the city.</p>
<p>Before the assembled council, with the handsome Gabriello Maria
richly robed beside the president, Facino came straight to the
matter nearest his heart at the moment.</p>
<p>"Sirs," he said, "you will rejoice to see in the increase of our
strength by a thousand lances hired from the King of France an
assurance of Milan's safety. For, with a force now of some three
thousand men with which to take the field against Buonterzo, you
may tell the people from me that they may sleep tranquil o' nights.
But that is not the end of my good tidings." He took Bellarion by
the shoulder and thrust him forward upon the notice of those
gentlemen. "In the terms made with Monsieur Boucicault, my adoptive
son here has saved the Commune of Milan the sum of fifteen thousand
florins a month, which is to say a sum of between thirty and fifty
thousand florins, according to the length of this campaign." And he
placed the signed and sealed parchment which bore the articles on
the council table for their inspection.</p>
<p>This was good news indeed; almost as good, considering their
depleted treasury, as would have been the news of a victory. They
did not dissemble their satisfaction. It grew as they considered
it. Facino dilated upon Messer Bellarion's intelligent care of
their interests. Such foresight and solicitude were unusual in a
soldier, and were usually left by soldiers contemptuously to
statesmen. This the president of the Council frankly confessed in
the little speech in which he voiced the Commune's thanks to Messer
Bellarion, showing that he took it for granted that a son of
Facino's, by adoption or nature, must of necessity be a
soldier.</p>
<p>Nor was the expression of that gratitude confined to words. In
the glow of their enthusiasm the Communal Council ended by voting
Messer Bellarion a sum of five thousand florins as an earnest of
appreciation of his care of their interests.</p>
<p>Thus, suddenly and without warning, Bellarion found not merely
fame&mdash;as it seemed to his modest notions&mdash;riches thrust upon him.
The President came to shake him by the hand, and after the
President there was the Ducal Governor, the Lord Gabriello Maria
Visconti sometime Prince of Pisa.</p>
<p>For once he was almost disconcerted.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-06" id="ch-2-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. THE FRUITLESS
WOOING</h2>
<p>To have done what Bellarion had done was, after all, no great
matter to the world of the court, and would have attracted no
attention there. But to have received the public thanks of Milan's
civic head, and a gift of five thousand florins in recognition of
his services, was instantly to become noteworthy. Then there was
the circumstance that he was the son of the famous Facino&mdash;for
"adoptive" was universally accepted as the euphemism for "natural",
and this despite the Countess Beatrice's vehement assertions of the
contrary&mdash;and lastly there was the fact that he was so endowed by
nature as to commend himself to his fellow-men and no less to his
fellow-women. He moved about the court of Milan during those three
or four weeks of preparation for the campaign against Buonterzo
with the ease of one who had been bred in courts. With something of
the artist's love of beauty, he was guilty almost of extravagance
in his raiment, so that in no single detail now did he suggest his
lowly origin and convent rearing. Rendered conspicuous at the
outset by events and circumstances, he became during those few
weeks almost famous by his own natural gifts and attractions.
Gabriello Maria conceived an attachment for him, the Duke himself
chose to be pleasant and completely to forget the incident of the
dogs. Even della Torre, Facino's mortal but secret enemy, sought to
conciliate him.</p>
<p>Bellarion, whose bold penetrating glance saw everything, whose
rigid features betrayed nothing, steered a careful course by the
aid of philosophy and a sense of humour which grew steadily and
concurrently with the growth of his knowledge of men and women.</p>
<p>If he had a trouble in those days when he was lodged in Facino's
apartments in the ducal palace, it lay in the too assiduous
attentions of the Countess Beatrice. She was embittered with
grievances against Facino, old natural grievances immeasurably
increased by a more recent one; and to his discomfort it was to
Bellarion that she went with her plaints.</p>
<p>"I am twenty years younger than he is," she said, which was an
exaggeration of five years. "I am as much of an age to be his
daughter as you are, Bellarion, to be his son."</p>
<p>Bellarion refused to perceive in this the implication that she
and he were well matched in years.</p>
<p>"Yet, Madonna," said he gently, "you have been wed these ten
years. It is a little late to repine. Why did you marry him?"</p>
<p>"Ten years ago he seemed none so old as now."</p>
<p>"He wasn't. He was ten years younger. So were you."</p>
<p>"But the difference seemed less. We appeared to be more of an
age until the gout began to trouble him. Ours was a marriage of
ambition. My father compelled me to it. Facino would go far, he
said. And so he would, so he could, if he were not set on cheating
me."</p>
<p>"On cheating you, Madonna?"</p>
<p>"He could be Duke of Milan if he would. Not to take what is
offered him, is to cheat me, considering why I married him."</p>
<p>"If this were so, it is the price you pay for having cheated him
by taking him to husband. Did you tell him this before you were
wed?"</p>
<p>"As if such things are ever said! You are dull sometimes,
Bellarion."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. But if they are not said, how are they to be
known?"</p>
<p>"Why else should I have married a man old enough to be my
father? It was no natural union. Could a maid bring love to such a
marriage?"</p>
<p>"Ask someone else, Madonna." His manner became frosty. "I know
nothing of maids and less of love. These sciences were not included
in my studies."</p>
<p>And then finding that hints were wasted against Bellarion's
armour of simplicity&mdash;an armour assumed like any other panoply&mdash;she
grew outrageously direct.</p>
<p>"I could repair the omission for you, Bellarion," she said, her
voice little more than a tremulous whisper, her eyes upon the
ground.</p>
<p>Bellarion started as if he had been stung. But he made a good
recovery.</p>
<p>"You might, if there were no Facino."</p>
<p>She flashed him an upward glance of anger, and the colour
flooded her face. Bellarion, however, went calmly on:</p>
<p>"I owe him a debt of loyalty, I think; and so do you, Madonna. I
may know little of men, but from what I have seen I cannot think
that there are many like Facino. It is his loyalty and honesty
prevents him from gratifying your ambition."</p>
<p>It is surprising that she should still have wished to argue with
him. But so she did.</p>
<p>"His loyalty to whom?"</p>
<p>"To the Duke his master."</p>
<p>"That animal! Does he inspire loyalty, Bellarion?"</p>
<p>"To his own ideals, then."</p>
<p>"To anything, in fact, but me," she complained. "It is natural
enough perhaps. Just as he is too old for me, so am I too young for
him. You should judge me mercifully when you remember that,
Bellarion."</p>
<p>"It is not mine to judge you at all, Madonna, and Heaven
preserve me from any such presumption. It is only mine to remember
that all I have and all I am I owe to my Lord Count, and that he is
my adoptive father."</p>
<p>"You'll not, I hope, on that account, desire me to be a mother
to you," she sneered.</p>
<p>"Why not? It is an amiable relationship."</p>
<p>She flung away in anger at that. But only to return again on the
morrow to invite his sympathy and his consolation, neither of which
he was prepared to afford her. Her wooing of him grew so flagrant,
so reckless in its assault upon the defences behind which he
entrenched himself, that one day he boldly sallied forth to rout
her in open conflict.</p>
<p>"What do you seek of me that my Lord Count cannot give you?" he
demanded. "Your grievance against him is that he will not make you
a duchess. Your desire in life is to become a duchess. Can I make
you that if he cannot?"</p>
<p>But it was he himself who was routed by the counter-attack.</p>
<p>"How you persist in misunderstanding me. If I desire of him that
he make me a duchess, it is because it is the only thing that he
can make me. Cheated of love, must I be cheated also of
ambition?"</p>
<p>"Which do you rate more highly?"</p>
<p>She raised that perfect ivory-coloured face, from which the
habitual insolent languor had now all been swept; her deep blue
eyes held nothing but entreaty and submission.</p>
<p>"That must depend upon the man who brings it."</p>
<p>"To the best of his ability, my Lord Facino has brought you
both."</p>
<p>"Facino! Facino!" she cried out in sudden petulance. "Must you
always be thinking of Facino?"</p>
<p>He bowed a little. "One of us must, Madonna," he answered with
grave finality.</p>
<p>And meanwhile the profligate court of Gian Maria observed this
assiduity of Facino's lady, and the Duke himself set the fashion of
making it a subject for jests. It is not recorded of him that he
made many jests in his brief day, and certainly none that were not
lewd.</p>
<p>"Facino's adoptive son should soon be standing in nearer
relationship to him," he said. "He will be discovering presently
that his wife has become by Messer Bellarion's wizardry his
adoptive daughter."</p>
<p>So pleased was his highness with this poor conceit that he
repeated it on several occasions. It became a theme upon which his
courtiers played innumerable variations. Yet, as commonly happens,
none of these reached the ears of Facino. If any had reached them
it would have been bad only for him who uttered it. For Facino's
attachment to his quite unworthy lady amounted to worship. His
trust in her was unassailable. Judging the honesty of others after
his own, he took it for granted that Beatrice's attitude towards
his adoptive son was as motherly as became the wife of an adoptive
father.</p>
<p>This, indeed, was his assumption even when the countess supplied
what any other man must have accounted grounds for suspicion.</p>
<p>The occasion came on an evening of early April. Bellarion had
received a message by a groom to wait upon Facino. He came to the
count's apartments, to find him not yet returned, whereupon with a
manuscript of Alighieri's Comedy to keep him company he went to
wait in the loggia, overlooking the inner quadrangle of the
Broletto, which was laid out as a garden, very green in those first
days of April.</p>
<p>Thither, a little to his chagrin, for the austere music of
Dante's Tuscan lines was engrossing him, came the countess,
sheathed in a gown of white samite, with great sapphires glowing
against the glossy black of her hair to match the dark mysterious
blue of her languid eyes.</p>
<p>She came alone, and brought with her a little lute, an
instrument which she played with some expertness. And she was
gifted, too, in the making of little songs, which of late had been
excessively concerned with unrequited love, despair and death.</p>
<p>The count, she told Bellarion, had gone to the Castle, by which
she meant, of course, the great fortress of Porta Giovia, built and
commonly inhabited by the late Duke. But he would be returning
soon. And meanwhile, to beguile the tedium of his waiting, she
would sing to him.</p>
<p>Singing to him Facino found her, and he was not to guess with
what reluctance Bellarion had suffered her voice to substitute the
voice of Dante Alighieri. Nor, in any case, was he at all concerned
with that.</p>
<p>He came abruptly into the room from which the loggia opened, his
manner a little pressed and feverish. And the suddenness of his
entrance acting upon a conscience not altogether at rest cropped
her song in mid-flight. The eyes she raised to his flushed and
frowning face were startled and uneasy. Bellarion, who sat
dreaming, holding the vellum-bound manuscript, which was closed
upon his forefinger, sprang up with something in his manner of that
confusion usually discernible in one suddenly recalled from dreams
to his surroundings.</p>
<p>Facino strode out to the loggia, and there loosed his news at
once. "Buonterzo is moving. He left Parma at dawn yesterday, and is
advancing towards Piacenza with an army fully four thousand
strong."</p>
<p>"Four thousand!" cried Bellarion. "Then he is in greater
strength than you even now."</p>
<p>"Thanks to the French contingent and the communal militia, the
odds do not perturb me. Buonterzo is welcome to the advantage.
He'll need a greater when we meet. That will be in two days' time;
in three at latest. For we march at midnight. All is in readiness.
The men are resting between this and then. You had best do the
same, Bellarion."</p>
<p>Thus with a complete change from his usual good-tempered,
easygoing manner, already the commander rapping out his orders
without waste of words, Facino delivered himself.</p>
<p>But now his countess, who had risen when he announced the
imminence of action, expressed her concern.</p>
<p>"Bellarion?" she cried. Her face was white to the lips, her
rounded bosom heaving under its close-fitting sheath; there was
dread in her eyes. "Bellarion goes with you?"</p>
<p>Facino looked at her, and the lines between his brows grew
deeper. It wounded him sharply that in this hour concern for
another should so completely override concern for himself. Beyond
that, however, his resentment did not go. He could think no evil
where his Bice was concerned, and, indeed, Bellarion's eager
interposition would have supplied the antidote had it been
necessary.</p>
<p>"Why, Madonna, you would not have me left behind! You would not
have me miss such an occasion!" His cheeks were aglow; his eyes
sparkled.</p>
<p>Facino laughed, "You hear the lad? Would you be so cruel as to
deny him?"</p>
<p>She recaptured betimes the wits which surprise had scattered,
and prudently dissembled her dismay. On a more temperate note, from
which all passion was excluded, she replied: "He's such a child to
be going to the wars!"</p>
<p>"A child! Pooh! Who would become master should begin early. At
his age I was leader of a troop."</p>
<p>He laughed again. But he was not to laugh later when he recalled
this trivial incident.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-07" id="ch-2-07"></a>CHAPTER VII. MANOEUVRES</h2>
<p>Shortly before midnight they rode out from the Palace of the old
Broletto: Facino, attended by Bellarion for his esquire, a page
bestriding a mule that was laden with his armour, and a half-dozen
men-at-arms.</p>
<p>Facino was silent and pensive. His lady's farewells had lacked
the tenderness he craved, and the Duke whose battles he went to
fight had not even been present to speed him. He had left the
palace to go forth upon this campaign, slinking away like a
discharged lackey. The Duke, he had been told, was absent, and for
all that he was well aware of the Duke's detestable pernoctations,
he preferred to believe that this was merely another expression of
that ill-will which, despite all that he had done and all that lay
in his power to do, the Duke never failed to display towards
him.</p>
<p>But as the little company rode out in the bright moonlight down
the borgo of Porta Giovia, out of a narrow side street emerged a
bulky man almost dragged along by three great hounds straining at
the leash and yelping eagerly, their noses to the ground. A slender
figure in a cloak followed after him, calling petulantly as he
came:</p>
<p>"Not so fast, Squarcia! Body of God! Not so fast, I say. I am
out of breath!"</p>
<p>There was no mistaking that strident voice. It was the Duke
himself, and close upon his heels came six armed lackeys to make a
bodyguard.</p>
<p>Squarcia and his powerful hounds crossed the main street of the
borgo, almost under the head of Facino's horse, the brawny huntsman
panting and swearing as he went.</p>
<p>"I cannot hold them back, Lord Duke," he answered. "They're hot
upon the scent, and strong as mules, devil take them!"</p>
<p>He vanished down the dark gulf of an alley. From the leader of
the Duke's bodyguard came a challenge:</p>
<p>"Who goes there at this hour?"</p>
<p>Facino loosed a laugh that was full of bitterness.</p>
<p>"Facino Cane, Lord Duke, going to the wars."</p>
<p>"It makes you laugh, eh?" The Duke approached him. He had missed
the bitterness of the laughter, or else the meaning of that
bitterness.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, it makes me laugh. I go to fight the battles of the
Duke of Milan. It is my business and my pleasure. I leave you, Lord
Duke, to yours."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay! Bring me back the head of that rogue Buonterzo. Good
fortune to you!"</p>
<p>"Your highness is gracious."</p>
<p>"God be with you!" He moved on. "That rogue Squarcia is getting
too far ahead. Ho, there! Squarcia! Damn your vile soul! Not so
fast!" The gloom of the alley absorbed him. His bodyguard
followed.</p>
<p>Again Facino laughed, "God be with me, says the Duke's
magnificence. May the devil be with him. I wonder upon what
foulness he is bent tonight, Bellarion." He touched his horse with
the spur. "Forward!"</p>
<p>They came to the Castle of Porta Giovia, the vast fortress of
Gian Galeazzo, built as much for the city's protection from without
as for his own from the city. The drawbridge was lowered to receive
them, and they rode into the great courtyard of San Donato, which
was thronged with men-at-arms and bullock-carts laden with the
necessaries of the campaign. Here, in the inner courtyard and in
the great plain beyond the walls of both castle and city, the army
of Facino was drawn up, marshalled by Carmagnola.</p>
<p>Facino rode through the castle, issuing brief orders here and
there as he went, then, at the far end of the plain beyond at the
very head of the assembled forces, he took up his station, attended
by Bellarion, Beppo the page, and his little personal bodyguard.
There he remained for close upon an hour, and in the moonlight,
supplemented by a dozen flaring barrels of tar, he reviewed the
army as it filed past and took the road south towards
Melegnano.</p>
<p>The order of the going had been preconcerted between Facino and
his lieutenant, Carmagnola, and it was Carmagnola who led the
vanguard, made up of five hundred mounted men of the civic militia
of Milan and three hundred German infantry, a mixed force composed
of Bavarians, Swabians and Saxons, trailing the ponderous German
pike which was fifteen feet in length. They were uniform at least
in that all were stalwart bearded men; and they sang as they
marched, swinging vigorously to the rhythm of their outlandish
song. They were commanded by a Swabian named Koenigshofen.</p>
<p>Next came de Cadillac with the French horse, of whom eight
hundred rode in armour with lances erect, an imposing array of
mounted steel which flashed ruddily in the flare from the tar
barrels; the remaining two hundred made up a company of mounted
arbalisters.</p>
<p>After the French came an incredibly long train of lumbering
wagons drawn by oxen, and laden, some with the ordinary baggage of
the army&mdash;tents, utensils, arms, munitions and the like&mdash;and the
others with mangonels and siege implements, including a dozen
cannon.</p>
<p>Finally came the rearguard composed of Facino's own condotta,
increased by recent recruitings to twelve hundred men-at-arms and
supplemented by three hundred Switzers under Werner von Stoffel, of
whom a hundred were arbalisters and the remainder infantry armed
with the short but terribly effective Swiss halbert.</p>
<p>When the last had marched away to be absorbed into the darkness,
and the song of the Germans at the head of the column had faded out
of earshot, muffled by the tramp of the rearguard, Facino and his
little knot of personal attendants set out to follow.</p>
<p>Towards noon of the following day, with Melegnano well behind
them, they came to a halt in the hamlet of Ospedaletto, having
covered twenty-five miles in that first almost unbroken march. The
pace was not one that could be maintained, nor would it have been
maintained so long but that Facino was in haste to reach the south
bank of the Po before Buonterzo could cross. Therefore, leaving the
main army to rest at Ospedaletto, he pushed on with five hundred
lances as far as Piacenza.</p>
<p>With these at need he could hold the bridgehead whilst waiting
for the main army to join him on the morrow.</p>
<p>At Piacenza, however, there was still no sign of the enemy, and
in the Scotti who held the city&mdash;one of the possessions wrested
from the Duchy of Milan&mdash;Facino found an unexpected ally. Buonterzo
had sent to demand passage of the Scotti. And the Scotti, with the
true brigand instinct of their kind, had replied by offering him
passage on terms. But Buonterzo, the greater brigand, had mocked
the proposal, sending word back that unless he were made free of
the bridge he would cross by force and clean up the town in
passing. As a consequence, whilst Buonterzo's advance was retarded
by the necessity of reaching Piacenza in full force, Facino was
given free and unhindered passage by the Scotti, so that he might
act as a buckler for them.</p>
<p>Having brought his army on the morrow safely across the Po,
Facino assembled it on the left bank of the little river Nure. He
destroyed the bridge by which the Aemilian Way crosses the stream
at Pontenure, and sat down to await Buonterzo, who was now reported
to be at Firenzuola, ten miles away.</p>
<p>Buonterzo, however, did not come directly on, but, quitting the
Aemilian Way, struck south, and, crossing the shallow hills into
the valley of the Nure, threatened thence to descend upon Facino's
flank.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of a series of movements, of marchings
and counter-marchings, which endured for a full week without ever
bringing the armies in sight of each other. These movements carried
them gradually south, and their operations became a game of
hide-and-seek among the hills.</p>
<p>At first it bewildered Bellarion that two commanders, each of
whom had for aim the destruction of the other, should appear so
sedulously to avoid an engagement. But in the end he came to
understand the spirit actuating them. Each fought with mercenary
troops, and just as it is not the business of mercenaries to get
themselves killed, neither is it their business to slay if
slaughter can be avoided. They fought for profit, and whilst
prisoners were profitable, since they yielded not only arms and
horses but also ransoms, dead men yielded nothing beyond their
harness. Therefore they demanded that their commanders should lead
them as nearly as possible into a position of such strategical
advantage that the enemy, perceiving himself at their mercy, should
have no choice but to surrender. To this general rule the only
exception was afforded by the Swiss who were indifferent to
bloodshed. But of Swiss there were only a few on Facino's side, and
none at all on Buonterzo's.</p>
<p>At the end of a week, after endless manoeuvres, matters were
very much as they had been at the beginning. Buonterzo had fallen
back again on Firenzuola, hoping to draw Facino into open country,
whilst Facino, refusing to be drawn, lay patiently at San
Nicolo.</p>
<p>Three days Facino waited there, to be suddenly startled by the
news that Buonterzo was at Aggazano, eight miles away. Suspecting
here an attempt to slip past himself in a disadvantageous position,
leaving an opening for attack, Facino decided upon instant
action.</p>
<p>In the best house of San Nicolo, which he had temporarily
adopted for his quarters, Facino assembled on the morning of the
10th of May his chief officers, Francesco Busone of Carmagnola,
Koenigshofen, the Swiss Werner von Stoffel, and the French
Commander de Cadillac.</p>
<p>In a small plain room on the ground floor, darkened by
semi-closed shutters to exclude the too ardent sun, they were
gathered, Bellarion with them, about the plain deal table at which
Facino sat. On the table's white surface the condottiero with a
stick of charcoal had drawn a map which, if rough, was fairly
accurate of scale. In the past week Bellarion had seen and studied
a half-dozen such charts and had come to read them readily.</p>
<p>Charcoal stick in hand, Facino expounded.</p>
<p>"Buonterzo lies here, and the speed at which he has moved from
Firenzuola will constrain him to rest there, whatever his ultimate
intention."</p>
<p>Carmagnola interposed. He was a large young man, handsome,
florid, and self-assured.</p>
<p>"He is too favourably placed for an attack from the plain. At
Aggazano he holds the slopes, whence he can roll down like an
avalanche."</p>
<p>"You are interrupting me, Francesco." Facino's voice was dry and
cold. "And you point out the obvious. It is not my intention to
make a frontal attack; but merely to simulate one. Here is my plan:
I divide the army into two battles. One of these, composed of the
French horse, the civic militia and Koenigshofen's pikes, you shall
lead, Francesco, marching directly upon Aggazano as if intending to
attack. Thus you engage Buonterzo's attention and pin him there.
Meanwhile, with the remainder of the forces I, myself, march up the
valley of the Trebbia as far as Travo, and then, striking over the
hills, descend thence upon Buonterzo's camp. That will be the
moment of your simulated attack from the plain below to become
real, so that whichever way Buonterzo turns we are upon his
rear."</p>
<p>There was a murmur of approval from the four officers.</p>
<p>Facino looked from one to another smiling a little. "No
situation could be better suited for such a manoeuvre."</p>
<p>And now Bellarion the chess-player and student of the art of
war, greatly daring, yet entirely unconscious of it, presumed to
advance a criticism.</p>
<p>"The weakness lies in the assumption that this situation will be
maintained until action is joined."</p>
<p>Carmagnola gasped, and with Koenigshofen and de Cadillac gave
the young man a stare of haughty, angry amazement. Facino laughed
outright at so much impudence.</p>
<p>Werner von Stoffel, between whom and Bellarion a certain
friendship had sprung up during the month they had spent together
at Abbiategrasso, was the only one who spared his feelings, whilst
Facino, having vented his scorn in laughter, condescended to
explain.</p>
<p>"We ensure that by the speed of our onset, which will leave him
no time to move. It is the need for rest that has made him take up
his strong position. Its very strength is the trap in which we'll
take him." He rose, brushing the matter aside. "Come! The details
each of you can work out for himself. What imports is that we
should move at once, leaving camp and baggage so that we may march
unhampered. Here speed is all."</p>
<p>But Bellarion was so little abashed by their contempt that he
actually returned to the attack.</p>
<p>"If I were in Buonterzo's place," he said, "I should have scouts
along the heights from Rivergaro to Travo. Upon discovering your
intentions from your movements, I should first descend upon
Carmagnola's force, and, having routed it, I would come round and
on, to engage your own. Thus the division of forces upon which you
count for success might easily be made the cause of your ruin."</p>
<p>Again there was silence of amazement at this babe in warlike
matters who thrust his opinions upon the notice of tried
soldiers.</p>
<p>"Let us thank God," said Carmagnola with stinging sarcasm, "that
you do not command Buonterzo's troops, or our overthrow would be
assured." And he led the rather cruel laughter, which at last
silenced Bellarion.</p>
<p>The two battles into which the army was divided moved at dusk,
leaving all baggage and even the cannon, of which Facino judged
that he would have no need in operations of the character intended.
Before midnight Carmagnola had reached his station within a mile of
Aggazano, and Facino was at Travo, ready to breast the slopes at
dawn, and from their summit descend upon Buonterzo's camp.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the forces rested, and Facino himself snatched a few
hours' sleep in a green tent which had hurriedly been pitched for
him.</p>
<p>Bellarion, however, too excited by the prospect of action to
think of sleeping, and rendered uneasy for his apprehensions, paced
by the river, which murmured at that point over a broad shallow,
its waters sadly shrunken by the recent drought. Here in his
pacings he was joined by Stoffel.</p>
<p>"I did not laugh at you today," the Swiss reminded him.</p>
<p>"I have to thank you for that courtesy," said Bellarion
gravely.</p>
<p>"Courtesy wasn't in my mind."</p>
<p>A patriotic Swiss and an able soldier, Stoffel had the
appearance of neither. He was of middle height and a gracefully
slim figure which he dressed with elegance and care. His face was
shaven, long and olive-skinned with a well-bridged nose and dark
pensive eyes under straight black eyebrows. There was about him
something mincing and delicate but entirely pleasant, for with it
all he was virile and intrepid.</p>
<p>"You voiced," he said now, "a possibility which should not have
been left outside their calculations."</p>
<p>"I have never seen a battle," said Bellarion. "But I do not need
to see one to know that all strategy is bad which does not consider
and provide for every likely counter-move that is discernible."</p>
<p>"And the counter-move you suggested was discernible enough&mdash;at
least, when you suggested it."</p>
<p>Bellarion looked at the Swiss so far as the Swiss was visible in
the faint radiance of that warm summer night.</p>
<p>"Thinking as you do, why did you not support me, Stoffel?"</p>
<p>"Carmagnola and de Cadillac are soldiers of repute, and so is
even Koenigshofen, whilst I am but the captain of a small body of
Swiss infantry, whose office it is to carry out the duties imposed
upon him. I do not give advice unasked, which is why even now I
dare not suggest to Facino that he repair his omission to&mdash;place
scouts on the heights. He takes Buonterzo's vulnerability too much
for granted."</p>
<p>Bellarion smiled. "Which is why you seek me, hoping that I will
suggest it to him."</p>
<p>"I think it would be well."</p>
<p>Bellarion considered. "We could do better, Stoffel. We could go
up ourselves and make observations."</p>
<p>They came an hour or so later to the crest of the hill, and
there remained on watch until the light of dawn was strong enough
to disclose to them in detail the slopes towards Aggazano. And what
they saw in that cold grey light was the realization, if not of the
exact possibility Bellarion had voiced, at least of something very
near akin. The difference lay in that, instead of moving first
against Carmagnola and later against Facino, Buonterzo was
beginning with the latter course. And Bellarion instantly perceived
the advantages of this. Buonterzo could descend upon Facino from
above in a position of enormous tactical advantage, and, having
destroyed him, go round to meet Carmagnola on level terms of
ground.</p>
<p>The order of the movements, however, was a detail of comparative
unimportance. What mattered was that Buonterzo was actually moving
to destroy severally the two battles into which Facino had divided
his army. In the upland valley to the north, a couple of miles
away, already breasting the gentle slopes towards the summit from
which Bellarion and Stoffel observed them, swarmed the whole army
of Ottone Buonterzo.</p>
<p>The watchers waited for no more. Down the hill again to Travo
they raced and came breathless into the tent where Facino slept.
Their news effectively awakened him. He wasted no time in futile
raging, but, summoning his officers, issued orders instantly to
marshal the men and march down the valley so as to go round to
effect a reunion with Carmagnola's battle.</p>
<p>"It will never be effected that way," said Bellarion
quietly.</p>
<p>Facino scowled at him, dismissed the officers to their tasks,
and when only Stoffel remained, angrily demanded of Bellarion what
the devil he meant by constantly intruding opinions that were not
sought.</p>
<p>"If the last opinion I intruded had been weighed," said
Bellarion, "you would not now be in this desperate case."</p>
<p>"Desperate!" Facino almost exploded on the word. "How is it
desperate?"</p>
<p>"Come outside, my lord."</p>
<p>To humour his self-sufficiency, to allow it to swell into a
monstrous bubble which even when fully swollen he would reduce to
nothing by a single prick, Facino went with him from the tent,
Stoffel gravely following. And in the open, by the river under that
long line of shallow hills, Bellarion expounded the situation in
the manner of a pedant lecturing a scholar.</p>
<p>"Already by his present position, Buonterzo has driven the wedge
too deeply between yourself and Carmagnola. A reunion of forces is
no longer possible by marching down the valley. In less than an
hour Buonterzo will command the heights and observe your every
movement. He will be at a centre whence he can hurl his force along
a radius to strike you at whatever point of the periphery you
chance to occupy. And he will strike you with more than twice your
numbers, falling upon your flank from a position of vantage which
would still render him irresistible if he had half your strength.
Your position, my lord, with the river on your own flank, is much
as was the position of the Austrians at Morgarten, when they were
utterly broken by the Swiss."</p>
<p>Facino's impatience and anger had gradually undergone a
transmutation into wonder and dismay, and he knew not whether to be
more dismayed because he had failed to perceive the situation for
himself or because it was pointed out to him by one whose knowledge
of the art of war was all derived from books.</p>
<p>Without answering, he stood there brooding, chin in hand,
striving to master his bitter vexation.</p>
<p>"If you had heeded me yesterday..." Bellarion was beginning,
which was very human but hardly generous, when Facino roughly cut
him short.</p>
<p>"Peace!" he growled. "What is done is done. We have to deal with
what we find." He turned to Stoffel. "We must retreat across the
river before Buonterzo thrusts us into it. There is a ford here
above Travo at this height of water."</p>
<p>"That," ventured Stoffel, "is but to increase our separation
from Carmagnola."</p>
<p>"Don't I know it?" roared Facino, now thoroughly in a rage with
himself and all the world. "Do you suppose I can perceive nothing?
Let a messenger ride at once to Carmagnola, ordering him to fall
back and cross below Rivergaro. The river should be fordable just
below the islands. Thus it is possible he might be able to rejoin
me."</p>
<p>"It should certainly be possible," the Swiss agreed, "if
Buonterzo pursues us across the ford, intent upon delivering battle
whilst the odds are so heavily in his favour."</p>
<p>"I am counting upon that. We draw him on, rufusing battle until
Carmagnola is also across and in his rear. Thus we'll snatch
victory from defeat."</p>
<p>"But if he doesn't follow?" quoth Bellarion. And again, in spite
of what had happened, Facino frowned his haughty impatience of this
fledgling's presumption. Unintimidated Bellarion went on: "If you
were in Buonterzo's place, would you follow, when by remaining on
this bank and marching down the valley you might keep the two enemy
battles apart so as to engage each at your convenience?"</p>
<p>"If Buonterzo were to do that, I should re-cross, and he would
then have me upon his rear. After all, if his position has
advantages, it has also disadvantages. However he turn, he will be
between two forces."</p>
<p>"Which is no disadvantage to him, unless the two can operate
simultaneously, and this he can prevent, once you have crossed the
river, by leaving a force to watch you and dispute your passage
should you attempt to return. And for that a small force will
suffice. With a hundred well-posted arbalisters I could hold that
ford for a day against an enemy."</p>
<p>"You could?" Facino almost laughed.</p>
<p>"I could, and I will, if the plan commends itself to you."</p>
<p>"What plan?"</p>
<p>It was a plan that had occurred to Bellarion even as they
argued, inspired by the very arguments they had used. He had been
conning the ground beyond the water, a line of shallow hills, with
a grey limestone bluff crowned by a dense wood of lofty elms
commanding the fold itself.</p>
<p>"Buonterzo should be drawn to pursue you across the river, which
might easily happen if you cross in full sight of his forces and
with all the appearance of disorder. An army in flight is an almost
irresistible lure to an overwhelming force. It was thus that Duke
William of Normandy endured his own ultimate victory at Senlac. The
slopes across the water offer no difficulty to a pursuer, and the
prospect of bringing you to an engagement before Carmagnola can
rejoin you should prove too seductive. It should even render
Buonterzo obstinate when he finds his passage disputed. And for
this, as I have said, a hundred arbalisters will suffice. In the
end he must either force a passage or decide to abandon the attempt
and go instead against Carmagnola first. But before either happens,
if you act promptly, you may have rejoined Carmagnola by crossing
to him at Rivergaro and then come round the hills upon Buonterzo's
rear, thus turning the tables upon him. Whether he is still here,
attempting to cross, or whether he is marching off down the valley,
he will be equally at your mercy if you are swift. And I will
undertake to hold him until sunset with a hundred
cross-bowmen."</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with amazement by that lucid exposition of a
masterly plan, Facino stood and stared at him in silence. Gravely,
at last, he asked him:</p>
<p>"And if you fail?"</p>
<p>"I shall still have held him long enough to enable you to
extricate yourself from the trap in which you are now caught."</p>
<p>Facino's bewildered glance sought the dark comely face of
Stoffel. He smiled grimly. "Am I a fool, Stoffel, that a boy should
instruct me in the art by which I have lived? And would you trust a
hundred of your Swiss to this same boy?"</p>
<p>"With confidence."</p>
<p>But still Facino hesitated. "You realize, Bellarion, that if the
passage is forced before I arrive it will go very hard with
you?"</p>
<p>Bellarion shrugged in silence. Facino thought he was not
understood.</p>
<p>"Such an action as you propose will entail great slaughter
perhaps. Buonterzo will be impatient of that and he may terribly
avenge it."</p>
<p>Bellarion smiled. "He will have to cross first, and meanwhile, I
shall count upon his impatience and vindictiveness to hold him here
when he should be elsewhere."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-08" id="ch-2-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII. THE BATTLE OF
TRAVO</h2>
<p>The morning sunlight falling across the valley flashed on the
arms of Buonterzo's vanguard on the heights even as Facino's
rearguard went splashing through the ford, which at its deepest did
not come above the bellies of the horses or the breasts of
Bellarion's hundred Swiss, who, with arbalists above their heads,
to keep the cords dry, were the last to cross.</p>
<p>From his eyrie Buonterzo saw the main body of Facino's army
straggling in disorder over the shallow hill beyond the water, and,
persuaded that he had to deal with a rabble disorganized by fear,
he gave the order to pursue.</p>
<p>A squadron of horse came zigzagging down the hillside at speed,
whilst a considerable body of infantry dropped more directly.</p>
<p>The last stragglers of the fugitive army had vanished from view
when that cavalry gained the ford and entered the water. But before
the head of the column had reached midstream there was a loud hum
of arbalist cords, and fifty bolts came to empty nearly as many
saddles. The column backed, and whilst it hesitated another fifty
bolts from the enemy invisible in the woods that crowned the bluff
dealt fresh destruction.</p>
<p>There was a deal of confusion after that, a deal of raging and
splashing; some sought to turn and retreat; others behind, who had
not been exposed to that murderous hail, clamoured to go on. So
that by the time Bellarion's men had drawn their cords anew and set
fresh bolts the horsemen in the water had gone neither forward nor
back. And now Bellarion let them have a full hundred in a single
volley, and thereby threw them into such panic that there was an
end to all hesitation. They turned about&mdash;those that were still
able to do so&mdash;and, driving riderless horses before them and
assisting wounded 'comrades to regain the shore, they floundered
their way back.</p>
<p>The effect of this upon Buonterzo was precisely as Bellarion in
his almost uncanny knowledge of men had reckoned. He was filled
with fury, which he expressed to those about him, denouncing the
action as insensate.</p>
<p>From the eminence on which he sat his horse he could see that
over the shallow hills across the river the disorderly flight of
Facino's troops continued, and, raging at the delay in the pursuit,
Buonterzo rode down the hill with the remainder of his forces.</p>
<p>Excited officers met him below to deafen him with facts which he
had already perceived. The ford was held against them by a party of
cross-bowmen, rendering impossible the pursuit his potency had
commanded.</p>
<p>"I'll show you," Buonterzo savagely promised them, and he
ordered a hundred men into the village of Travo to bring thence
every door and shutter the place contained.</p>
<p>Close upon three hours were spent in that measure of
preparation. But Buonterzo counted upon speedily making up for that
lost time once the bluff were cleared of those pestilential
cross-bowmen.</p>
<p>His preparations completed, Buonterzo launched the attack,
sending a body of three hundred foot to lead it, each man bearing
above his head one of the cumbrous improvized shields, and trailing
after him his pike, attached now to his belt.</p>
<p>From the summit of the bluff Bellarion looked down upon what
appeared to be a solid roof of timber thrusting forward across the
stream. A troop of horse was preparing to follow as soon as the
pikemen should have cleared the way. Bellarion drew two-thirds of
his men further off along, the river. Thus, whilst lengthening the
range, rendering aim less certain and less effective, at least it
enabled the arbalisters to shoot at the vulnerable flank of the
advancing host.</p>
<p>The attack was fully two-thirds of the way across the ford,
which may have been some two hundred yards in width, before
Bellarion's men were in their new positions. He ordered a volley of
twenty bolts, so as to judge the range; and although only half of
these took effect, yet the demoralization created in men who had
been conceiving themselves invulnerably sheltered was enough to
arrest them. A second volley followed along the low line of exposed
flank, and being more effective than the first, flung the column
into complete disorder.</p>
<p>Dead men lay awash where they had fallen, wounded men were
plunging in the water, shouting to their comrades for help, what
time their comrades cursed and raved, arousing the echoes of that
normally peaceful valley as they had been roused before when the
horsemen found themselves in similar plight. Odd shutters and doors
went floating down the stream, and, the continuity of the
improvized roof having been broken, those immediately behind the
fallen found themselves exposed now in front as well as on the
flank.</p>
<p>A mounted officer spurred through the water, shouting a command
repeatedly as he came and menacing the disordered ranks with his
sword. At last his order was understood, and the timber shields
were swung from overhead to cover the flank that was being
assailed. That, thought Buonterzo, should checkmate the defenders
of the ford, who with such foresight had shifted their position.
But scarcely was the manoeuvre executed when into them came a
volley from the thirty men Bellarion had left at the head of the
bluff in anticipation of just such a counter movement. Because the
range here was short, not a bolt of that volley failed to take
effect, and by the impression it created of the ubiquity of this
invisible opponent it completed the discomfiture of the assailants.
They turned, flung away their shields, and went scrambling back out
of range as fast as they could breast the water. To speed them came
another volley at their flanks, which claimed some victims, whilst
several men in their panic got into deep water and two or three
were drowned.</p>
<p>Livid with rage and chagrin, Buonterzo watched this second
repulse. He knew from his earlier observations and from the extent
of the valleys that it was the work of a negligible contingent
posted to cover Facino's retreat, and his wrath was deepened by the
reflection that as a result of this delay Facino might, if not
actually escape, at least compel him now to an arduous pursuit. No
further than that could Buonterzo see in the blindness of his rage,
precisely as Bellarion had calculated. And because he could see no
further, he stood obstinately in his resolve to put a strong force
across the river.</p>
<p>The sun was mounting now towards noon, and already over four
hours had been spent at that infernal ford. Yet realizing, despite
his impatience, that speed is seldom gained by hastiness, Buonterzo
now deliberately considered the measures to be taken, and he sent
men for a mile or more up and down stream to seek another passage.
Another hour was lost in this exploration, which proved fruitless
in the end. But, meanwhile, Buonterzo held in readiness a force of
five hundred men-at-arms in full armour, commanded by an intrepid
young knight named Varallo.</p>
<p>"You will cross in spite of any losses," Buonterzo instructed
him. "I compute them to number less than two hundred men, and if
you are resolute you will win over without difficulty. Their bolts
will not take effect save at short range, and by then you will be
upon them. You are to give no quarter and make no prisoners. Put
every man in that wood to the sword."</p>
<p>An ineffective volley rained on breastplate and helmet at the
outset. and, encouraged by this ineffectiveness, Varallo urged
forward his men-at-arms. Thus he brought them steadily within a
range whereat arbalistbolt could pierce their protecting steel
plates. But Bellarion, whose error in prematurely loosing the first
volley was the fruit of inexperience, took no chances thereafter.
He ordered his men to aim at the horses.</p>
<p>The result was a momentary check when a half-score of stricken
chargers reared and plunged and screamed in pain and terror and
flung off as many riders to drown helplessly in their armour,
weighed down by it and unable to regain their feet.</p>
<p>But Varallo, himself scatheless, urged them on with a voice of
brass, and brought them after that momentary pause of confusion to
the far bank. Here another dozen horses were brought down and two
or three men directly slain by bolts before Varallo had marshalled
them and led them charging up and round the shallow hill, where the
ascent was easy to the wood that crowned the bluff.</p>
<p>The whole of Buonterzo's army straggling along the left bank of
the river cheered them lustily on, and the dominant cry that rang
out clearly and boldly was "No quarter!"</p>
<p>That cry rang in the ears of Facino Cane as he mounted the
hill-top above and behind Buonterzo's force. He had made such good
speed, acting upon Bellarion's plain, that, crossing at Rivergaro,
he had joined Carmagnola, whom he met between there and Aggazano,
and sweeping on, round and up, he had completed a circuit of some
twelve miles in a bare five hours.</p>
<p>And here below him, at his mercy now, the strategic position of
that day's dawn completely reversed, lay Buonterzo's army, held in
check there by the skill and gallantry of Bellarion and his hundred
Swiss. But it was clear that he had arrived barely in time to
command victory, and possible that he had arrived too late to save
Bellarion.</p>
<p>Instantly he ordered de Cadillac to cleave through and cross, in
a forlorn attempt to rescue the party in the wood from the
slaughter obviously intended. And down the hill, like an avalanche,
went the French horse upon an enemy too stricken by surprise to
take even such scant measures of defence as the ground
afforded.</p>
<p>Over and through them went de Cadillac, riding down scores and
hurling hundreds into the river. Through the ford his horses
plunged and staggered at almost reckless speed to turn Varallo's
five hundred who, emerging from the wood, found themselves cut off
by a force of twice their strength. Back into the wood they plunged
and through it, with de Cadillac following. Out again beyond they
rode, and down the slope to the plain at breakneck speed. For a
mile and more de Cadillac pursued them. Then, bethinking him that,
after all, his force amounted to one-third of Facino's entire army,
and that his presence might be required on the main scene of
action, he turned his men and rode back.</p>
<p>They came again by way of the wood and along the main path
running through it they found nigh upon a score of Swiss dead, all
deliberately butchered, and one who still lived despite his
appalling wounds, whom they brought back with them.</p>
<p>By the time they regained the ford, the famous Battle of
Travo&mdash;as it is known to history&mdash;was all but over.</p>
<p>The wide breach made in Buonterzo's ranks by de Cadillac's
charge was never healed. Perceiving the danger that was upon them
from Facino's main army, the two broken ends of that long line went
off in opposite directions, one up the valley and the other down,
and it must be confessed that Buonterzo, realizing the hopelessness
of the position in which he had been surprised, himself led the
flight of the latter and more numerous part of his army. It may
have been his hope to reach the open plains beyond Rivergaro and
there reform his men and make a stand that should yet retrieve the
fortunes of the day. But Facino himself with his own condotta of
twelve hundred took a converging line along the heights to head
Buonterzo off at the proper moment. When he judged the moment to
have arrived Facino wheeled his long line and charged downhill upon
men who were afforded in that narrow place no opportunity of
assuming a proper formation.</p>
<p>Buonterzo and some two hundred horse, by desperate spurring,
eluded the charge. The remainder, amounting to upwards of a
thousand men, were rolled over, broken and hemmed about, so that
finally they threw down their arms and surrendered before they were
even summoned to do so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Koenigshofen with the third battle, into which the
army had been so swiftly divided, dealt similarly with the
fugitives who had attempted to ascend the valley.</p>
<p>Two thousand prisoners, fifteen hundred horses, a hundred
baggage-carts well laden, a score of cannon, beside some tons of
armour and arms, was the booty that fell to Facino Cane at Travo.
Of the prisoners, five hundred Burgundian men-at-arms were taken
into his own service. A thousand others were stripped of arms,
armour and horses, whilst the remainder, among whom were many
officers and knights of condition, were held for ransom.</p>
<p>The battle was over, but Facino had gone off in pursuit of
Buonterzo; and Carmagnola, assuming command, ordered the army to
follow. They came upon their leader towards evening between
Rivergaro and Piacenza, where he had abandoned the pursuit,
Buonterzo having crossed the river below the islands.</p>
<p>Carmagnola, flushed and exultant, gave him news of the
completeness of the victory and the richness of the booty.</p>
<p>"And Bellarion?" quoth Facino, his dark eyes grave.</p>
<p>De Cadillac told of the bodies in the wood; Stoffel, with sorrow
on his long swarthy face, repeated the tale of the wounded Swiss
who had since died. The fellow had reported that the men-at-arms
who rode in amongst them shouting, "No quarter!" had spared no
single life. There could be no doubt that Bellarion had perished
with the rest.</p>
<p>Facino's chin sank to his breast, and the lines deepened in his
face.</p>
<p>"It was his victory," he said slowly, sorrowfully. "His was the
mind that conceived the plan which turned disaster into success.
His the gallantry and self-sacrifice that made the plan possible."
He turned to Stoffel, who, more than any other there, had been
Bellarion's friend. "Take what men you need for the task and go
back to recover me his body. Bring it to Milan. The whole nation
shall do honour to his ashes and his memory."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-09" id="ch-2-09"></a>CHAPTER IX. DE MORTUIS</h2>
<p>There are men to whom death has brought a glory that would have
never been theirs in life. An instance of this is afforded by the
history of Bellarion at its present stage.</p>
<p>Honest, loyal and incapable of jealousy or other kindred
meanness, Facino must have given Bellarion a due measure of credit
for the victory over Buonterzo if Bellarion had ridden back to
Milan beside him. But that he would have given him, as he did, a
credit so full as to make the achievement entirely Bellarion's,
could hardly be expected of human nature or of Facino's. A living
man so extolled would completely have eclipsed the worth of Facino
himself; besides which to the man who in achieving lays down his
life we can afford to be more generous&mdash;because it is less
costly&mdash;than to the man who survives his achievement.</p>
<p>Never perhaps in its entire history had the Ambrosian city been
moved to such a delirium of joy as that in which it now hailed the
return of the victorious condottiero who had put an end to the grim
menace overhanging a people already distracted by internal
feuds.</p>
<p>News of the victory had preceded Facino, who reached Milan ahead
of his army two days after Buonterzo's rout.</p>
<p>It had uplifted the hearts of all, from the meanest scavenger to
the Duke himself. And yet the first words Gian Maria addressed to
Facino in the audience chamber of the Broletto, before the
assembled court, were words of censure.</p>
<p>"You return with the work half done. You should have pursued
Buonterzo to Parma and invested the city. This was your chance to
restore it to the crown of Milan. My father would have demanded a
stern account of you for this failure to garner the fruits of
victory."</p>
<p>Facino flashed to the temples. His jaw was thrust forward as he
looked the Duke boldly and scathingly between the eyes.</p>
<p>"Your father, Lord Prince, would have been beside me on the
battlefield to direct the operations that were to preserve his
crown. Had your highness followed his illustrious example there
would be no occasion now for a reproach that must recoil upon
yourself. It would better become your highness to return thanks for
a victory purchased at great sacrifice."</p>
<p>The goggle eyes looked at him balefully until their glance
faltered as usual under the dominance of the condottiero's will,
the dominance which Gian Maria so bitterly resented. Ungracefully
the slender yet awkward body sprawled in the great gilded chair,
red leg thrown over white one.</p>
<p>It was della Torre, tall and dark at his master's side, who came
to the Duke's assistance. "You are a bold man, Lord Count, so to
address your Prince."</p>
<p>"Bold, ay!" growled the Duke, encouraged by that support. "Body
of God! Bold to recklessness. One of these days..." He broke off,
the coarse lips curling in a sneer. "But you spoke of sacrifices?"
The cunning that lighted his brutishness fastened upon that. It
boded, he hoped, a tale of losses that should dim the lustre of
this popular idol's achievement.</p>
<p>Facino rendered his accounts, and it was then that he proclaimed
Bellarion's part; he related how Bellarion's wit had devised the
whole plan which had reversed the positions on the Trebbia, and he
spoke sorrowfully of how Bellarion and his hundred Swiss had laid
down their lives to make Facino's victory certain.</p>
<p>"I commend his memory to your highness and to the people of
Milan."</p>
<p>If the narrative did not deeply move Gian Maria, at least it
moved the courtiers present, and more deeply still the people of
Milan when it reached them later.</p>
<p>The outcome was that, after a Te Deum for the victory, the city
put on mourning for the martyred hero to whom the victory was due;
and Facino commanded a Requiem to be sung in Saint Ambrose for this
Salvator Patriae, whose name, unknown yesterday, was by now on
every man's lips. His origin, rearing, and personal endowments were
the sole subjects of discussion. The tale of the dogs was recalled
by the few who had ever heard of it, and now widely diffused as an
instance of miraculous powers which disposed men almost to canonize
Bellarion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, Facino, returning exacerbated from that
audience, was confronted by his lady, white-faced and
distraught.</p>
<p>"You sent him to his death!" was the furious accusation with
which she greeted him.</p>
<p>He checked aghast both at the words and the tone. "'I sent him
to his death!"</p>
<p>"You knew to what you exposed him when you sent him to hold that
ford."</p>
<p>"I did not send him, Himself he desired to go; himself proposed
it."</p>
<p>"A boy who did not know the risk he ran!"</p>
<p>The memory of the protest she had made against Bellarion's going
rose suddenly, invested with new meaning. Roughly, violently, he
caught her by the wrist. His face suddenly inflamed was close to
her own, the veins of his brow standing out like cords.</p>
<p>"A boy, you say. Was that what you found him, lady?"</p>
<p>Scared, but defiant, she asked him: "What else?"</p>
<p>"What else? Your concern suggests that you discovered he's a
man. What was Bellarion to you?"</p>
<p>For once he so terrified her that every sense but that of
self-preservation abandoned her on the instant.</p>
<p>"To me?" she faltered. "To me?"</p>
<p>"Ay, to you. Answer me." There was death in his voice and in the
brutal crushing grip upon her wrist.</p>
<p>"What should he have been, Facino?" She was almost whimpering.
"What lewdness are you dreaming?"</p>
<p>"I am dreaming nothing, madam. I am asking.'"</p>
<p>White-lipped she answered him. "He was as a son to me." In her
affright she fell to weeping, yet could be glad of the ready tears
that helped her to play the part so suddenly assumed. "I have no
child of my own. And so I took him to my empty mother's
breast."</p>
<p>The plaint, the veiled reproach, overlaid the preposterous
falsehood. After all, if she was not old enough to be Bellarion's
mother, at least she was his senior by ten years.</p>
<p>Facino loosed his grip and fell back, a little abashed and
ashamed.</p>
<p>"What else could you have supposed him to me?" she was
complaining. "Not...not, surely, that I had taken him for my
lover?"</p>
<p>"No," he lied lamely. "I was not suspecting that."</p>
<p>"What then?" she insisted, playing out her part.</p>
<p>He stood looking at her with feverish eyes. "I don't know," he
cried out at last. "You distract me, Bice!" and he stamped out.</p>
<p>But the suspicion was as a poison that had entered his veins,
and it was a moody, silent Facino who sat beside his lady at the
State supper given on the following night in the Old Broletto
Palace. It was a banquet of welcome to the Regent of Montferrat,
his nephew, and Marquis Gian Giacomo, and his niece, the Princess
Valeria, whose visit was the result of certain recent machinations
on the part of Gabriello Maria.</p>
<p>Gabriello Maria had lately been exercised by the fundamental
weakness of Gian Maria's position, and he feared lest the victory
in the conflict between Facino and Buonterzo might, in either case,
become a menace to the duchy. No less was he exercised by the
ascendary which was being obtained in Milan by the Guelphs under
della Torre, an ascendary so great that already there were rumours
of a possible marriage between the Duke and the daughter of
Malatesta of Rimini, who was regarded as the leader of the Guelphic
party in Italy. Now Gabriello, if weak and amiable, was at least
sincere in his desire to serve his brother as in his desire to make
secure his own position as ducal governor. For himself and his
brother he could see nothing but ultimate disaster from too great a
Guelphic ascendancy.</p>
<p>Therefore had he proposed an alliance between Gian Maria and his
father's old ally and friend, the Ghibbeline Prince of Montferrat.
Gian Maria's jealous fear of Facino's popularity had favourably
disposed him, and letters had been sent to Aliprandi, the Orator of
Milan, at Casale.</p>
<p>Theodore, on his side, anxious to restore to Montferrat the
cities of Vercelli and Alessandria, which had been wrested from it
by the all-conquering Gian Galeazzo, and having also an eye upon
the lordship of Genoa, once an appanage of the crown of Montferrat,
had conceived that the restoration of the former should be a
condition of the treaty of alliance which might ultimately lead to
the reconquest of the latter.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he made haste, in response, to come in person to
Milan, so that he might settle the terms of his treaty with the
Duke. With him he had brought his niece and the nephew on whose
behalf he ruled, who were included in Gabriello's invitation.
Gabriello's aim in this last detail was to avert the threatened
Malatesta marriage. A marriage between the Duke and the Princess of
Montferrat might be made by Theodore an absolute condition of that
same treaty, if his ambition for his niece were properly fired.</p>
<p>At the banquet that night Gabriello watched his brother, who sat
with Theodore on his right and the Princess Valeria on his left,
for signs from which he might calculate the chances of bringing the
secret part of his scheme to a successful issue. And signs were not
wanting to encourage him. It was mainly to the Princess that Gian
Maria addressed himself. His glance devoured the white beauty of
her face with its crown of red-gold hair; his pale goggle eyes
leered into the depths of her own which were so dark and
inscrutable, and he discoursed the while, loud and almost
incessantly, in an obvious desire to dazzle and to please.</p>
<p>And perhaps because the lady remained unmoved, serenely calm, a
little absent almost, and seldom condescending even to smile at his
gross sallies, he was piqued into greater efforts for his
entertainment, until at last he blundered upon a topic which
obviously commanded her attention. It was the topic of the
hour.</p>
<p>"There sits Facino Cane, Count of Biandrate," he informed her
"That square-faced fellow yonder, beside the dark lady who is his
countess An overrated upstart, all puffed up with pride in an
achievement not his own."</p>
<p>The phrase drew the attention of the Marquis Theodore. "But if
not his own, whose, then, the achievement, highness?"</p>
<p>"Why, a fledgling's, one whom he claims for his adoptive son."
The adjective was stressed with sarcasm. "A fellow named
Bellarion."</p>
<p>"Bellarion, eh?" The Regent betrayed interest. So, too, did the
Princess. For the first time she faced her odious host. Meanwhile,
Gian Maria ran on, his loud voice audible even to Facino, as he no
doubt intended.</p>
<p>"The truth is that by his rashness Facino was all but
out-fought, when this Bellarion showed him a trick by which he
might turn the tables on Buonterzo."</p>
<p>"A trick?" said she in an odd voice, and Gian Maria, overjoyed
to have won at last her attention, related in detail the strategy
by which Facino's victory had been snatched.</p>
<p>"A trick, as your highness said," was her comment. "Not a deed
of arms in which there is cause for pride."</p>
<p>Gian Maria stared at her in surprise, whilst Theodore laughed
aloud. "My niece is romantic. She reads the poets and from them
conceives of war as a joyous joust or a game of chivalry with equal
chances and a straightforward encounter."</p>
<p>"Why, then," laughed the Duke, "the tale should please you,
Madonna, of how with a hundred men this rascal held the ford
against Buonterzo's army for as long as the trick's success
demanded."</p>
<p>"He did that?" she asked, incredulous.</p>
<p>"He did more. He laid down his life in doing it. He and his
hundred were massacred in cold blood. That is why on Wednesday, at
Saint Ambrose, a Requiem Mass is to be sung for him who in the eyes
of my people deserves a place in the Calendar beside Saint
George."</p>
<p>His aim in this high praise was less to bestow laurels upon
Bellarion than to strip them from Facino. "And I am not sure that
the people are wrong. 'Vox populi, vox Dei'. This Bellarion was
oddly gifted, oddly guarded." In illustration of this he passed on
to relate that incident which had come to be known by them in Milan
as "The Miracle of the Dogs". He told the tale without any shame
for the part he had played, without any apparent sense that to hunt
human beings with hounds was other than a proper sport for
princes.</p>
<p>As she listened she was conscious only of horror of this
monstrous boy, so that the flesh of her arm shrank under the touch
of his short, broad, jewelled paw, from which the finger-nails had
been all but entirely gnawed. Anon, however, in the solitude of the
handsome chamber assigned to her, she came to recall and weigh the
things the Duke had said. This Bellarion had laid down his life in
the selfless service of adoptive father and country like a hero and
a martyr. She could understand that in one of whom her knowledge
was what it was of Bellarion as little as she could understand the
miracle of the dogs.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-10" id="ch-2-10"></a>CHAPTER X. THE KNIGHT
BELLARION</h2>
<p>That Requiem Mass at Saint Ambrose's for the repose of the soul
of Bellarion was never sung. And this because, whilst the bells
were solemnly tolling in summons to the faithful, Messer Bellarion,
himself very much in the flesh, and accompanied by Werner von
Stoffel, who had been sent to recover his body, marched into the
city of Milan by the Ticinese Gate at the head of some seventy
Swiss arbalisters, the survival of his hundred.</p>
<p>There was some delay in admitting them. When that dusty company
came in sight, swinging rhythmically along in steel caps and
metal-studded leather tunics, cross-bows shouldered, the officer of
the gate assumed them to be one of the marauding bands which were
continually harassing the city by their incursions.</p>
<p>By the time that Bellarion had succeeded in persuading him of
his identity, rumour had already sped before him with the amazing
news. Hence, in a measure, as he penetrated further into the city,
the greater was his difficulty in advancing through the crowd which
turned out to meet him and to make him acquainted with the fame to
which his supposed death had hoisted him.</p>
<p>In the square before the cathedral the crowd was so dense that
he could hardly proceed at all. The bells had ceased. For news of
his coming had reached Saint Ambrose, and the intended service was
naturally abandoned. This Bellarion deplored, for a sermon on his
virtues would have afforded him an entertainment vouchsafed to few
men.</p>
<p>At last he gained the Broletto and the courtyard of the Arrengo,
which was thronged almost as densely as the square outside.
Thronged, too, were the windows overlooking it, and in the loggia
on the right Bellarion perceived the Duke himself, standing between
the tall, black, saturnine della Torre and the scarlet Archbishop
of Milan, and beside the Archbishop the Countess Beatrice, a noble
lady sheathed in white samite, with black hair fitting as close and
regularly to her pale face as a cap of ebony. She was leaning
forward, one hand upon the parapet, the other waving a scarf in
greeting.</p>
<p>Bellarion savoured the moment critically, like an epicure in
life's phenomena. Fra Serafino rightly described the event as one
of those many friendly contrivings of fortune, as a result of which
he came ultimately to be known as Bellarion the Fortunate.</p>
<p>Similarly he savoured the moment when he stood before the Duke
and his assembled court in the great frescoed chamber known as the
Hall of Galeazzo, named after that son of Matteo Visconti who was
born at cockcrow&mdash;ad cantu galli.</p>
<p>Facino, himself, had fetched him thither from the court of the
Arrengo, and he stood now dusty and travel-stained, in steel cap
and leather tunic, still leaning upon the eight-foot halbert which
had served him as a staff. Calm and unabashed under the eyes of
that glittering throng, he rendered his account of this fresh
miracle&mdash;as it was deemed&mdash;to which he owed his preservation. And
the account was as simple as that which had explained to Facino the
miracle of the dogs.</p>
<p>When Buonterzo's men-at-arms had forced the passage of the ford,
Bellarion had been on the lower part of the bluff with some
two-thirds of his band. He had climbed at once to the summit, so as
to conduct the thirty men he had left there to the shelter on the
southern slope. But he came too late. The vindictive soldiers of
Buonterzo were already pursuing odd survivors through the trees to
the cry of "No quarter!" To succour them being impossible,
Bellarion conceived it his duty to save the men who were still with
him. Midway down the wooded farther slope he had discovered, at a
spot where the descent fell abruptly to a ledge, a cave, whose
entrance was overgrown and dissembled by a tangle of wild vine and
jessamine. Thither he now led them at the double. The cave burrowed
deeply into the limestone rock.</p>
<p>"We replaced," he related, "the trailing plants which our
entrance had disturbed, and retired into the depths of the cave
just as the first of the horsemen topped the summit. From the edge
of the wood they surveyed the plain below. Seeing it empty, they
must have supposed that those they had caught and slain composed
the entire company which had harassed them. They turned and rode
back, only to return again almost at once, their force enormously
increased, as it seemed to us, who could judge only by sounds.</p>
<p>"I realized now that in reality they were in flight before the
French horse which had been sent across to rescue us.</p>
<p>"For an hour or more after their passage we remained in our
concealment. At last I sent forth a scout, who reported a great
body of cavalry advancing from the Nure. This we still assumed to
be Buonterzo's horse brought by news of Facino's real movements.
For another two hours we remained in our cave, and then at last I
climbed to the summit of the bluff whence I could survey the
farther bank of the Trebbia. To my amazement, I found it empty, and
then I became aware of men moving among the trees near at hand, and
presently found myself face to face with Werner von Stoffel, who
told me of the battle fought and won whilst we had lain in
hiding."</p>
<p>He went on to tell them how they had crossed the river and
pushed on to Travo in a famished state. They found the village
half-wrecked by the furious tide of war that had swept over it. Yet
some food they obtained, and towards evening they set out again so
as to overtake Facino's army. But at San Giorgio, which they
reached late at night, and where they were constrained to lie, they
found that Facino had not gone that way, and that, therefore, they
were upon the wrong road. Next morning, consequently, they decided
to make their way back to Milan.</p>
<p>They crossed the Po at Piacenza, only to find themselves
detained by the Scotti for having marched into the town without
permission. The Scotti knew of the battle fought, but not of its
ultimate issue. Buonterzo was in flight; but he might rally. And so
for two days Bellarion and his little band were kept in Piacenza
until the truth was known there. Then, at last, his departure was
permitted, since to have detained him longer must provoke the
resentment of the victorious Facino.</p>
<p>"We have made haste on the march since," he concluded, "and I
rejoice to have arrived at least in time to prevent a Requiem which
would have been rendered a mockery by my obstinate tenacity to
life."</p>
<p>Thus, on a note of laughter, he closed a narrative that was a
model of lucid brevity and elegant Tuscan delivery.</p>
<p>But there were two among the courtly crowd who did not laugh.
One was Francesco Busoni of Carmagnola, Facino's handsome,
swaggering lieutenant, who looked sourly upon this triumph of an
upstart in whom he had already feared a rival. The other was the
Princess Valeria, who, herself, unseen in that concourse,
discovered in this narrative only an impudent confession of
trickery from one whom she knew for a trickster. Almost she
suspected him of having deliberately contrived that men should
believe him dead to the end that by this sensational resurrection
he should establish himself as the hero of the hour.</p>
<p>Gabriello Maria, elegant and debonair, came to shake him by the
hand, and after Gabriello came the Duke, with della Torre, to
praise him almost fawningly as the Victor of Travo.</p>
<p>"That title, Lord Duke, belongs to none but my Lord Facino."</p>
<p>"Modesty, sir," said della Torre, "is a garment that becomes a
hero."</p>
<p>"If my Lord Facino did not wear it, sir, you could not lie under
your present error. He must have magnified to his own cost my
little achievement."</p>
<p>But they would not have made him elude their flattery, and when
at last they had done with him he was constrained to run the
gauntlet of the sycophantic court, which must fawn upon a man whom
the Duke approved. And here, to his surprise, he found the Marquis
Theodore, who used him very civilly and with no least allusion to
their past association.</p>
<p>At last Bellarion escaped, and sought the apartments of Facino.
There he found the countess alone. She rose from her seat in the
loggia when he entered and came towards him so light and eagerly
that she seemed almost to drift across the floor.</p>
<p>"Bellarion!"</p>
<p>There was a flush on her usually pale cheeks, a glitter in her
bright slanting eyes, and she came holding out both hands in
welcome.</p>
<p>"Bellarion!" she cried again, and her voice throbbed like the
plucked chords of a lute.</p>
<p>Instantly he grew uneasy. "Madonna!" He bowed stiffly, took one
of her proffered hands, and bore it formally to his lips. "To
command!"</p>
<p>"Bellarion!" This time that melodious voice was pitched
reproachfully. She seized him by his leather-clad arms and held him
so, confronting him.</p>
<p>"Do you know that I have mourned you dead? That I thought my
heart would break? That my own life seemed to have gone out with
yours? Yet all that you can say to me now&mdash;in such an hour as
this&mdash;so cold and formally is 'to command'! Of what are you made,
Bellarion?"</p>
<p>"And of what are you made, Madonna?" Roughly almost, he
disengaged himself from her grip. He was very angry, and anger was
a rare emotion in his cold, calculating nature. "O God! Is there no
loyalty in all this world? Below, there was the Duke to nauseate me
with flattery which was no more than base disloyalty to my lord. I
escape from it to meet here a disloyalty which wounds me infinitely
more."</p>
<p>She had fallen back a little, and momentarily turned aside.
Suddenly she faced him again, breathless and very white. Her long
narrow eyes seemed to grow longer and narrower.</p>
<p>"Why, what are you assuming?" There was now no music in her
voice. It was harshly metallic. "Has soldiering made you fatuous,
by chance?" She laughed unpleasantly, as upon a sudden
scorn-provoking revelation. "I see! I see! You thought that I...!
You thought...! Why, you fool! You poor, vain fool! Shall I tell
Facino what you thought, and how you have dared to insult me with
it?"</p>
<p>He stood bewildered, aghast and indignant. He sought to recall
her exact expressions. "You used words, Madonna..." he was
beginning hotly when suddenly he checked; and when he resumed, the
indignation had all gone out of him. "What have you said is very
just. I am a fool, of course. You will give me leave?"</p>
<p>He made to go, but she had not yet done with him.</p>
<p>"I used words, you say. What words? What words that could
warrant your assumptions? I said that I had mourned you. It is
true. As a mother might have mourned you. But you...You could
think...!" She swung past him towards the open loggia. "Go, sir. Go
wait elsewhere for my lord."</p>
<p>He departed without another word, not indeed to await Facino,
whom he did not see again until the morrow, a day which for him was
very full.</p>
<p>Betimes he was sought by the Lord Gabriello Maria, who came at
the request of the Commune of Milan to conduct him to the Ragione
Palace, there to receive the thanks of the representatives of the
people.</p>
<p>"I desire no thanks, and I deserve none." His manner was almost
sullen.</p>
<p>"You'll receive them, none the less. To disregard the invitation
were ungracious."</p>
<p>And so the Lord Gabriello carried off Bellarion, the son of
nobody, to the homage of the city. In the Communal Palace he
listened to a recital by the President of his shining virtues and
still more shining services, in token of their appreciation of
which the fathers of the Ambrosian City announced that they had
voted him the handsome sum of ten thousand gold florins. In other
words, they had divided between himself and Facino the sum they had
been intending to award the latter for delivering the city from the
menace of Buonterzo.</p>
<p>After that, and in compliance with the recommendation of the
council, the rather bewildered Bellarion was conducted by his noble
escort to receive the accolade of knighthood. Empanoplied for the
ceremony in the suit of black armour which had been Boucicault's
gift to him, he was conducted into the court of the Arrengo, where
Gian Maria in red and white, attended by the nobility of Milan,
awaited him. But it was Facino, very grave and solemn, who claimed
the right to bestow the accolade upon one who had so signally and
loyally served him as an esquire. And when Bellarion rose from his
knees it was the Countess of Biandrate, at her husband's bidding,
who came to buckle the gold spurs to the heels of the new
knight.</p>
<p>For arms, when invited to choose a device, he announced that he
would adopt a variant of Facino's own: a dog's head argent on a
field azure.</p>
<p>At the conclusion a herald proclaimed a joust to be held in the
Castle of Porta Giovia on the morrow when the Knight Bellarion
would be given opportunity of proving publicly how well he deserved
the honour to which he had acceded.</p>
<p>It was a prospect which he did not relish. He knew himself
without skill at arms, in which he had served only an elementary
apprenticeship during those days at Abbiategrasso.</p>
<p>Nor did it increase his courage that Carmagnola should come
swaggering towards him, his florid countenance wreathed in smiles
of simulated friendliness, to claim for the morrow the honour of
running a course and breaking a lance with his new
brother-knight.</p>
<p>He smiled, nevertheless, as falsely as Carmagnola himself.</p>
<p>"You honour me, Ser Franceso. I will do my endeavour."</p>
<p>He noted the gleam in Carmagnola's eyes, and went, so soon as he
was free, in quest of Stoffel, with whom his friendship had ripened
during their journey from Travo.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Werner, have you ever seen Carmagnola in the
tilt-yard?"</p>
<p>"Once, a year ago, in the Castle of Porta Giovia."</p>
<p>"Ha! A great hulking bull of a man."</p>
<p>"You describe him. He charges like a bull. He bore off the prize
that day against all comers. The Lord of Genestra had his thigh
broken by him."</p>
<p>"So, so!"' said Bellarion, very thoughtful. "It's my neck he
means to break tomorrow. I read it in his smile."</p>
<p>"A swaggerer," said Stoffel. "He'll take a heavy fall one
day."</p>
<p>"Unfortunately that day will not be tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Are you to ride against him, then?" There was concern in
Stoffel's voice.</p>
<p>"So he believes. But I have a feeling that tomorrow I shall not
be in case to ride against anyone. I have a fever coming on: the
result of hardships suffered on the way from Travo. Nature will
compel me, I suspect, to keep my bed tomorrow."</p>
<p>Stoffel considered him with grave eyes. "Are you afraid?"</p>
<p>"What else?"</p>
<p>"And you confess it?"</p>
<p>"It asks courage. Which shows that whilst afraid I am not a
coward. Life is full of paradox, I find."</p>
<p>Stoffel laughed. "No need to protest your courage to me. I
remember Travo."</p>
<p>"There I had a chance to succeed. Here I have none. And who
accepts such odds is not a brave man, but a fool. I don't like
broken bones, and still less a broken reputation. I mean to keep
what I've won against the day when I may need it. Reputation,
Stoffel, is a delicate bubble, easily pricked. To be unhorsed in
the lists is no proper fate for a hero."</p>
<p>"You're a calculating rogue!"</p>
<p>"That is the difference between me and Carmagnola, who is just a
superior man-at-arms. Each to his trade, Werner, and mine isn't of
the tilt-yard, however many knighthoods they bestow on me. Which is
why tomorrow I shall have the fever."</p>
<p>This resolve, however, went near to shipwreck that same
evening.</p>
<p>In the Hall of Galeazzo the Duke gave audience, which was to be
followed by a banquet. Bidden to this came the new knight,
Bellarion, bailing a splendid houppelande of sapphire velvet edged
with miniver that was caught about his waist by a girdle of
hammered silver. He had dressed himself with studied care in the
azure and argent of his new blazon. His tunic, displayed at the
breast, where the houppelande fell carelessly open and at the arms
which protruded to the elbow from the wide short sleeves of his
upper garment, was of cloth of silver, whilst his hose was in broad
vertical stripes of alternating blue and white. Even his thick
black hair was held in a caul of fine silver thread that was
studded with sapphires.</p>
<p>Imposingly tall, his youthful lankness dissembled by his dress,
he drew the eyes of the court as he advanced to pay homage to the
Duke.</p>
<p>Thereafter he was held awhile in friendly talk by della Torre
and the Archbishop. It was in escaping at last from these that he
found himself suddenly looking into the solemn eyes of the Princess
Valeria, of whose presence in Milan this was his first
intimation.</p>
<p>She stood a little apart from the main throng under the fretted
minstrel's gallery, at the end of the long hall, with the handsome
Monna Dionara for only companion.</p>
<p>Startled, he turned red then white under the shock of that
unexpected encounter. He had a feeling, under those inscrutable
eyes, of being detected, stripped of his fine trappings and
audacious carriage, and discovered for an upstart impostor, the son
of nobody, impudently ruffling it among the great.</p>
<p>Thus an instant. Then recovering his poise he went forward with
leisurely dignity to make his bow, in which there was nothing
rustic.</p>
<p>She coloured slightly. Her eyes kindled, and she drew back as if
to depart. A single interjectory word escaped her.</p>
<p>"Audacious!"</p>
<p>"Lady, I thank you for the word. It shall supply the motto I
still lack. 'Audax', remembering that 'Audaces fortuna juvat'."</p>
<p>She had not been a woman had she not answered him.</p>
<p>"Fortune has favoured you already. You prosper, sir."</p>
<p>"By God's grace, Madonna."</p>
<p>"God has less to do with it, I think, than your own arts."</p>
<p>"My arts?" He questioned not the word but the meaning she
applied to it.</p>
<p>"Such arts as Judas used. You should study the end he made."</p>
<p>On that she would have gone, but the sharpness of his tone
arrested her.</p>
<p>"Madonna, if I ever practised those arts, it was in your
service, and a reproach is a poor requital."</p>
<p>"In my service!" Her eyes momentarily blazed. "Was it in my
service that you came to spy upon me and betray me? Was it in my
service that you murdered Enzo Spigno?" She smiled with terrible
bitterness. "I have, you see, no illusions left of the service that
you did me."</p>
<p>"No illusions!" His voice was wistful. She reasoned much as he
had feared that she would reason. "Lord God! You are filled with
illusions, the result of inference; and I warned you, Madonna, that
inference is not your strength."</p>
<p>"You poor buffoon! Will you pretend that you did not murder
Spigno?"</p>
<p>"Of course I did."</p>
<p>The admission amazed her where she had expected denial.</p>
<p>"You confess it? You dare to confess it?"</p>
<p>"So that in future you may assert with knowledge what you have
not hesitated to assert upon mere suspicion. Shall I tell you the
reason at the same time? I killed Count Spigno because he was the
spy sent by your uncle to betray you, so that your brother's ruin
might be accomplished."</p>
<p>"Spigno!" she cried in so loud a voice of indignation that her
lady clutched her arm to impose caution. "You say that of Spigno?
He was the truest, bravest friend I ever knew, and his murder shall
be atoned if there is a justice in Heaven. It is enough."</p>
<p>"Not yet, Madonna. Consider only that one circumstance which
intrigued the Podesta of Casale: that at dead of night, when all
Barbaresco's household was asleep, only Count Spigno and I were
afoot and fully dressed. Into what tale does that fit beside the
lie I told the Podesta? Shall I tell you?"</p>
<p>"Shall I listen to one who confesses himself a liar and a
murderer?"</p>
<p>"Alas! Both: in the service of an ungracious lady. But hear now
the truth."</p>
<p>Briefly and swiftly he told it.</p>
<p>"I am to believe this?" she asked him in sheer scorn. "I am to
be so false to the memory of one who served me well and faithfully
as to credit this tale of his baseness upon no better word than
yours? Why, it is a tale which even if true must brand you for a
beast. This man, whatever he may have been, was moved to rescue
you, you say, from certain doom; and all the return you made him
for that act of charity was to stab him."</p>
<p>He wrung his hands in despair. "Oh, the perversity of your
reasoning! But account me a beast, if you will, for the deed. Yet
admit that the intention was selfless. Judge the result. I killed
Count Spigno to make you safe. And safe it has made you. If I had
other aims&mdash;if I were an agent to destroy you, why did I not speak
out in the Podesta's court?"</p>
<p>"Because your unsupported word would hardly have sufficed to
doom persons of our condition."</p>
<p>"Which, again, is precisely why I killed Count Spigno: because
if he had lived he would have supported it. Is it becoming
clear?"</p>
<p>"Clear? Shall I tell you what is clear? That you killed Spigno
in self-defence when he discovered you for the Judas that you were.
Oh, believe me, it is very clear. To make it so there are your lies
to me, your assertion that you were a poor nameless scholar who had
imposed himself upon the Marquis Theodore by the pretence of being
Facino Cane's son. A pretence you said it was. You'll deny that
now."</p>
<p>Some of his assurance left him. "No. I don't deny it."</p>
<p>"You'll tell me perhaps that you deceived the Lord Facino
himself with that pretence?" And now, without waiting for an
answer, she demolished him with the batteries of her contempt. "In
so great a pretender even that were possible. You pretended to lay
down your life at Travo; yet behold you resurrected to garner the
harvest which that trick has earned you."</p>
<p>"O shameful!" he cried out, stirred to anger by a suspicion so
ignoble.</p>
<p>"Are you not rewarded and knighted for the stir that was made by
the rumour of your death? You are to give proof of your knightly
worth in the lists tomorrow. It will be interesting."</p>
<p>On that she left him standing there with wounds in his soul that
would take long to heal. When at last he swung away, a keen eye
observed the pallor of his face and the loss of assurance from his
carriage&mdash;the eye of Facino's lady, who approached him on her
lord's arm.</p>
<p>"You are pale, Bellarion," she commented in pure malice, having
watched his long entertainment with the Princess of Montferrat.</p>
<p>"Indeed, Madonna, I am none so well."</p>
<p>"Not ailing, Bellarion?" There was some concern in Facino's tone
and glance.</p>
<p>And there and then the rogue saw his opportunity and took
it.</p>
<p>"It will be nothing." He passed a hand across his brow. "The
excitement following upon the strain of these last days."</p>
<p>"You should be abed, boy."</p>
<p>"It is what I tell myself."</p>
<p>He allowed Facino to persuade him, and quietly departed. His
sudden illness was rumoured at the banquet when his place remained
vacant, and consequently there was little surprise when it was
known on the morrow that a fever prevented him from bearing his
part in the jousts at Porta Giovia.</p>
<p>By the doctor who ministered to him he sent a message to
Carmagnola of deepest and courtliest regard that he was not
permitted to rise and break a lance with him.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-11" id="ch-2-11"></a>CHAPTER XI. THE SIEGE OF
ALESSANDRIA</h2>
<p>Gabriello Maria Visconti's plans for the restoration of
Ghibbeline authority suffered shipwreck, as was to be expected, in
a council mainly composed of Guelphs.</p>
<p>The weapon placed in their hands by Gabriello Maria for his own
defeat was the Marquis Theodore's demand, as the price of his
alliance, that he should be supported in the attempt to recover
Genoa to Montferrat.</p>
<p>Della Tore laughed the proposal to scorn. "And thereby incur the
resentment of the King of France!" He developed that argument so
speciously that not even Facino, who was present, suspected that it
did not contain the true reason of della Torre's opposition.</p>
<p>In hiring a French contingent to strengthen the army which he
had led against Buonterzo, Facino had shown the uses that could be
made of Baucicault. What Facino had done della Torre could do
nominally on the Duke's behalf. He could hire lances from
Boucicault to set against Facino himself when the need for this
arose.</p>
<p>"Possibly," ventured Gabriello, "the surrender of Vercelli and
certain other guarantees would suffice to bring Montferrat into
alliance."</p>
<p>But della Torre desired no such alliance. "Surrender Vercilli!
We have surrendered too much already. It is time we sought
alliances that will restore to Milan some of the fiefs of which she
has been robbed."</p>
<p>"And where," Facino quietly asked him, "will you find such
allies?"</p>
<p>Della Torre hesitated. He knew as well as any man that policies
may be wrecked by premature disclosure. If his cherished scheme of
alliance with Malatesta of Rimini were suspected, Facino,
forewarned, would arm himself to frustrate it. He lowered his
glance.</p>
<p>"I am not prepared to say where they may be found. But I am
prepared to say that they are not to be found in Theodore of
Montferrat at the price demanded by that Prince."</p>
<p>Gabriello Maria was left to make excuses he could to the Marquis
Theodore; and the Marquis Theodore received them in no pleasant
manner. He deemed himself slighted, and said so, hinting darkly
that Milan counted enemies enough already without wantonly seeking
to add to them. Thus in dudgeon he returned to Montferrat.</p>
<p>Della Torre's patient reticence was very shortly justified.</p>
<p>In the early days of June came an urgent and pitiful appeal from
the Duke's brother, Filippo Maria, Count of Pavia, for assistance
against the Vignate of Lodi, who were ravaging his territories and
had seized the city of Alessandria.</p>
<p>The Duke was in his closet with della Torre and Lonate when that
letter reached him. He scowled and frowned and grunted over the
parchment awhile, then tossed it to della Torre.</p>
<p>"A plague on him that wrote it! Can you read the scrawl,
Antonio?"</p>
<p>Della Torre took it up. "It is from your brother, highness, the
Lord Filippo Maria."</p>
<p>"That skin of lard!" Gian Maria was contemptuous. "If he
remembers my existence, he must be in need of something."</p>
<p>Della Torre gravely read the letter aloud. The Prince guffawed
once or twice over a piteous phrase, meanwhile toying with the head
of a great mastiff that lay stretched at his feet.</p>
<p>He guffawed more heartily than ever at the end, the malice of
his nature finding amusement in the calamities of his brother. "His
Obesity of Pavia is disturbed at last! Let the slothful hog exert
himself and sweat away some of his monstrous bulk."</p>
<p>"Do not laugh yet, my lord." Della Torre's lean, crafty, swarthy
face was grave. "I have ever warned you against the ambition of
Vignate and that if would not be satisfied with the reconquest of
Lodi. He is in arms, not so much against your brother as against
the house of Visconti."</p>
<p>"God's bones!" Goggle-eyed, the Duke stared at his adviser. Then
to vent unreasoning fury he rose and caught the dog a vicious kick
which drove it yelping from him. "By Hell, am I to go in arms
against Vignate? Is that your counsel?"</p>
<p>"No less."</p>
<p>"And this campaign against Buonterzo scarcely ended! Am I to
have nothing but wars and feuds and strife to distract my days? Am
I to spend all in quelling brigandage? By the Passion! I'd as soon
be Duke of Hell as reign in Milan."</p>
<p>"In that case," said della Torre, "do nothing, and the rest may
follow."</p>
<p>"Devil take you, Antonio!" He caught up a hawk-lure from the
table end set himself to strip it as he talked, scattering the
feathers about the room. "Curb him, you say? Curb this damned thief
of Lodi? How am I to curb him? The French lances are gone back to
Boucicault. The parsimonious fathers of this miserly city were in
haste to dismiss them. They think of nothing but ducats, may their
souls perish! They think more of ducats than of their Duke."
Inconsequently, peevishly, he ranted on, reducing the hawk-lure to
rags the while, and showing the crafty della Torre his
opportunity.</p>
<p>"Vignate," he said at last, when the Duke ceased, "can be in no
great strength when all is reckoned. Facino's own condotta should
fully suffice to whip him out of Alessandria and back to Lodi."</p>
<p>Gian Maria moved restlessly about the room.</p>
<p>"What if it should not? What if Facino should be broken by
Vignate? What then? Vignate will be at the gates of Milan."</p>
<p>"He might be if we could not prepare for the eventuality."</p>
<p>With a sudden curious eagerness Gian Maria glared at his mentor.
"Can we? In God's name, can we? If we could..." He checked. But the
sudden glow of hate and evil hope in his prominent pale eyes showed
how he was rising to the bait.</p>
<p>Della Torre judged the moment opportune. "We can," he answered
firmly.</p>
<p>"How, man? How?"</p>
<p>"In alliance with Malatesta your highness would be strong enough
to defy all comers."</p>
<p>"Malatesta!" The Duke leapt as if stung. But instantly he curbed
himself. The loose embryonic features tightened, reflecting the
concentration of the embryonic wicked mind within. "Malatesta, eh?"
His tone was musing. He let himself drop once more into his broad
armchair, and sat there, cross-legged, pondering.</p>
<p>Della Torre moved softly to his side, and lowered his voice to
an impressive note.</p>
<p>"Indeed, your highness should consider whether you will not in
any event bring in Malatesta so soon as Facino has departed on this
errand."</p>
<p>The handsome profligate Lonate, lounging, a listener by the
window, cleared up all ambiguity: "And so make sure that this
upstart does not return to trouble you again."</p>
<p>Gian Maria's head sank a little between his shoulders. Here was
his chance to rid himself for all time of the tyrannical tutelage
of that condottiero, made strong by popular support.</p>
<p>"You speak as if sure that Malatesta will come."</p>
<p>Della Torre put his cards on the table at last. "I am. I have
his word that he will accept a proposal of alliance from your
highness."</p>
<p>"You have his word!" The ever-ready suspicions of a weak mind
were stirring.</p>
<p>"I took his feeling against the hour when your potency might
need a friend."</p>
<p>"And the price?"</p>
<p>Della Torre spread his hands. "Malatesta has ambitions for his
daughter. If she were Duchess of Milan..."</p>
<p>"Is that a condition?" The Duke's voice was sharp.</p>
<p>"A contingency only," della Torre untruthfully assured him. "Yet
if realized the alliance would be consolidated. It would become a
family affair."</p>
<p>"Give me air! Let me think." He rose, thrusting della Torre away
by a sweep of his thin arm.</p>
<p>Ungainly in his gaudy red and white, shuffling his feet as he
went, he crossed to the window where Lonate made way for him. There
he stood a moment looking out, whilst between Lonate and della
Torre a look of intelligence was flashed.</p>
<p>Suddenly the boy swung round again, and his grotesque
countenance was flushed. "By God and His Saints! What thought does
it ask?" He laughed slobberingly at the picture in his mind of a
Facino Cane ruined beyond redemption. Nor could he perceive, poor
fool, that he would be but exchanging one yoke for another probably
heavier.</p>
<p>Still laughing, he dismissed della Torre and Lonate and sent for
Facino. When the condottiero came he was given Filippo Maria's
letter, which he spelled out with difficulty, being little more of
a scholar than the Duke.</p>
<p>"It is grave," he said when he had reached the end.</p>
<p>"You mean that Vignate is to be feared?"</p>
<p>"Not so long as he is alone. But how long will he so continue?
What if he should be joined by Estorre Visconti and the other
malcontents? Singly they matter nothing. United they become
formidable. And this bold hostility of Vignate's may be the signal
for a league."</p>
<p>"What then?"</p>
<p>"Smash Vignate and drive him out of Alessandria before it
becomes a rallying ground for your enemies."</p>
<p>"About it, then," rasped the Duke. "You have the means."</p>
<p>"With the Burgundians enlisted after Travo, my condotta stands
at two thousand three hundred men. If the civic militia is
added&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It is required for the city's defence against Estorre and the
other roving insurgents."</p>
<p>Facino did not argue the matter.</p>
<p>"I'll do without it, then."</p>
<p>He set out next day at early morning, and by nightfall, the half
of that march to Alessandria accomplished, he brought his army,
wearied and exhausted by the June heat, to rest under the red walls
of Pavia.</p>
<p>To proceed straight against the very place which Vignate had
seized and held was a direct course of action in conflict with
ideas which Bellarion did not hesitate to lay before the
war-experienced officers composing Facino's council. He prefaced
their exposition by laying down the principle, a little
didactically, that the surest way to defeat an opponent is to
assault him at the weakest point. So much Facino and his officers
would have conceded on the battleground itself. But Bellarion's
principle involved a wider range, including the enemy's position
before ever battle was joined, so as to ensure that the
battleground itself should be the enemy's weakest point. The course
he now urged entailed an adoption of the strategy employed by the
Athenians against the Thebans in the Peloponnesian war, a strategy
which he so much admired and was so often to apply.</p>
<p>In its application now, instead of attacking Alessandria, behind
whose walls the enemy lay in strength, he would have invaded
Vignate's own temporarily unguarded Tyranny of Lodi.</p>
<p>Facino laughed a little at Bellarion's self-sufficiency, and,
emboldened by that, Carmagnola took it upon himself to put the
fledgling down.</p>
<p>"It is in your nature, I think, to avoid the direct attack." He
sneered as he spoke, having in mind the jousts at Milan and the
manner in which Bellarion had cheated him of the satisfaction upon
which he counted. "You forget, sir, that your knighthood places you
under certain obligations."</p>
<p>"But not, I hope," said Bellarion innocently, "under the
obligation of being a fool."</p>
<p>"Do you call me that?" Carmagnola's sudden suavity was in itself
a provocation.</p>
<p>"You boast yourself the champion of the direct attack. It is the
method of the bull. But I have never heard it argued from this that
the bull is intelligent&mdash;even among animals."</p>
<p>"So that now you compare me with a bull?" Carmagnola flushed a
little, conscious that Koenigshofen and Stoffel were smiling.</p>
<p>"Quiet!" growled Facino. "We are not here to squabble among
ourselves. Your assumptions, Bellarion, sometimes become
presumptions."</p>
<p>"So you thought on the Trebbia."</p>
<p>Facino brought his great fist down upon the table. "In God's
name! Will you be pert? You interrupt me. Battering-ram tactics are
not in my mind. I choose a different method. But I attack
Alessandria, none the less, because Vignate and his men are
there."</p>
<p>Discreetly Bellarion said no more, suppressing the argument that
by reducing unguarded Lodi and restoring it to the crown of Milan
from which it had been ravished, a moral effect might be produced
of far-reaching effect upon the fortunes of the Duchy.</p>
<p>After a conference with Filippo Maria in his great castle of
Pavia, Facino resumed his march, his army now increased by six
hundred Italian mercenaries under a soldier of fortune named
Giasone Trotta, whom Filippo Maria had hired. He took with him a
considerable train of siege artillery, of mangonels, rimbaults and
cannon, to which the Count of Pavia had materially added.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he did not approach Alessandria within striking
distance of such weapons. He knew the strength to withstand assault
of that fortress city, built some three hundred years before on the
confines of the Pavese and Montferrat to be a Guelphic stronghold
in the struggle between Church and Empire. Derisively then the
Ghibbelines had dubbed it a fortress of straw. But astride of the
river Tanaro, above its junction with the Bormida, this Alessandria
of Straw had successfully defied them.</p>
<p>Facino proposed to employ the very strength of her strategic
position for the undoing of her present garrison if it showed
fight. And, meanwhile, he would hem the place about so as to reduce
it by starvation.</p>
<p>Crossing the Po somewhere in the neighbourhood of Bassignana, he
marched up the left bank of the Tanaro to Pavone, a village in the
plain by the river, just within three miles of Alessandria. There
he took up his quarters, and thence on a radius of some three miles
he drew a cordon through that low-lying insalubrious land,
intersected with water-courses, where only rice-fields flourished.
This cordon crossed the two rivers just above their junction, swept
thence to Marengo, recrossing the Bormida, ran to Aulara in the
south and on to Cassalvagliano in the West, just beyond which it
crossed the Tanaro again, and, by way of San Michele in the north,
went on to complete the circle at Pavone.</p>
<p>So swift had been the movement, that the Alessandrians' first
intimation that they were besieged was from those who, issuing from
the city on the morrow, were stopped at the lines and ordered to
return.</p>
<p>From information yielded by these, in many cases under threat of
torture, it became clear that the populous city was indifferently
victualled and unequal, therefore, to a protracted resistance. And
this was confirmed during the first week by the desperate efforts
made by Vignate, who was raging like a trapped wolf in Alessandria.
Four times he attempted to break out in force. But within the outer
circle and close to the city, so as to keep it under observation,
Facino had drawn a ring of scouts, whose warning in each case
enabled him to concentrate promptly at the point assailed. The
advantage lay with Facino in these engagements, since the cavalry
upon which Vignate chiefly depended found it impossible to operate
successfully in those swampy plains. Over ground into which the
horses sank to their fetlocks at every stride a cavalry charge was
a brutum fulmen. Horses were piked by Koenigshofen's foot, and
formations smashed and hurled back by an enemy upon whom their
impact was no more than a spent blow.</p>
<p>If they escaped it was because Facino would make no prisoners.
He would not willingly relieve Alessandria of a single mouth that
would help to eat up its power of endurance. For the same reason he
enjoined it upon his officers that they should be as sparing as
possible of life.</p>
<p>"That is to say, of human life," said Bellarion, raising his
voice in council for the first time since last rebuked. They looked
at him, not understanding. "What other life is in question?" asked
Carmagnola. "There are the horses. If allowed to survive, they may
be eaten in the last extremity."</p>
<p>They acted upon that reminder when Vignate made his next sally.
Facino did not wait as hitherto to receive the charge upon his
pikes, but raked the enemy ranks during their leisurely advance,
and again during their subsequent retreat, with low-aimed arbalist
bolts which slew only horses.</p>
<p>Whether Vignate perceived the reason, or whether he came to
realize that the ground was not suitable for cavalry, his fourth
sally, to the north in the direction of San Michele, was made on
foot. He had some two thousand men in his following, and had they
been lightly armed and properly led it is probable that they would
have broken through, for the opposing force was materially less.
But Vignate, unaccustomed to handling infantry, committed the error
of the French at Agincourt. He employed dismounted men-at-arms in
all the panoply in which normally they rode to battle. Their fate
was similar to that of the French on that earlier occasion. Toiling
over the clammy ground in their heavy armour, their advance became
leaden-footed, and by the time they reached Facino's lines they
were exhausted men easily repulsed, and as glad as they were
surprised to escape death or capture.</p>
<p>After that failure, three representatives of the Commune of
Alessandria, accompanied by one of Vignate's captains, presented
themselves at Facino's quarters in the house of the Curate of
Pavone, temporarily appropriated by the condottiero.</p>
<p>They were ushered into a plain yellow-washed room, bare of all
decorations save that of a crudely painted wooden crucifix which
hung upon the wall above a straight-backed wooden settle. An oblong
table of common pine stood before this settle; a writing-pulpit,
also of pine, placed under one of the two windows by which the
place was lighted, and four rough stools and a shallow arm-chair
completed the furniture.</p>
<p>The only gentle touch about that harsh interior was supplied by
the sweet-smelling lemon verbena and rosemary mingled in the fresh
rushes with which the floor was copiously strewn to dissemble its
earthen nudity.</p>
<p>Carmagnola, showily dressed as usual in blue and crimson, with
marvellously variegated hose and a jewelled caul confining his
flaxen hair, had appropriated the arm-chair, and his gorgeous
presence seemed to fill the place. Stoffel, Koenigshofen, Giasone
Trotta and Vougeois, who commanded the Burgundians, occupied the
stools and afforded him a sober background, whilst Bellarion leaned
upon the edge of the settle, where Facino sat alone, square-faced
and stern, whilst the envoys invited him to offer terms for the
surrender of the city.</p>
<p>"The Lord Count of Pavia," he told them, "does not desire to
mulct too heavily those of his Alessandrian subjects who have
remained loyal. He realizes the constraint of which they may have
been the victims, and he will rest content with a payment of fifty
thousand florins to indemnify him for the expenses of this
expedition." The envoys breathed more freely. But Facino had not
yet done. "For myself I shall require another fifty thousand
florins for distribution among my followers to ransom the city from
pillage."</p>
<p>The envoys were aghast. "One hundred thousand gold florins!"
cried one. "My lord, it will..."</p>
<p>He raised his hand for silence. "That as regards the Commune of
Alessandria. Now as concerns the Lord Vignate, who has so rashly
ventured upon this aggression. He is allowed until noon tomorrow to
march out of Alessandria with his entire following, but leaving
behind all arms, armour, horses, bullocks and war material of
whatsoever kind. Further, he will enter into a bond for one hundred
thousand florins, to be paid either by himself personally or by the
Commune of Lodi to the Lord Count of Pavia's city of Alessandria to
indemnify the latter for the damages sustained by this occupation.
And my Lord Vignate will further submit to the occupation of the
City of Lodi by an army of not more than two thousand men, who will
be housed and fed and salaried at the City of Lodi's charge until
the indemnity is paid, with the further condition that if payment
is not made within one month the occupying army shall take it by
putting the city to sack."</p>
<p>The officer sent by Vignate, a stiff black-bearded fellow named
Corsana, flushed indignantly. "These terms are very harsh," he
complained.</p>
<p>"Salutary, my friend," Facino corrected him. "They are intended
to show the Lord Vignate that brigandage is not always ultimately
profitable."</p>
<p>"You think he will agree?" The man's air was truculent. The
three councillors looked scared.</p>
<p>Facino smiled grimly. "If he has an alternative, let him take
advantage of it. But let him understand that the offer of these
terms is for twenty-four hours only. After that I shall not let him
off so lightly."</p>
<p>"Lightly!" cried Corsana in anger, and would have added more but
that Facino cropped the intention. "You have leave to go." Thus,
royally, Facino dismissed them.</p>
<p>They did not return within the twenty-four hours, nor as day
followed day did Vignate make any further sign. Time began to hang
heavily on the hands of the besiegers, and Facino's irritation grew
daily, particularly when an attack of the gout came to imprison him
in the cheerless house of the Curate of Pavone.</p>
<p>One evening, a fortnight after the parley and nearly a month
after the commencement of the siege, as Facino sat at supper with
his officers, all save Stoffel, who was posted at Casalbagliano,
the condottiero, who was growing impatient of small things,
inveighed against the quality of the food.</p>
<p>It was Giasone Trotta, to whose riders fell the task of
provisioning the army, who answered him. "Faith! If the siege
endures much longer it is we who will be starved by it. My men have
almost cleaned up the countryside for a good ten miles in every
direction."</p>
<p>It was a jocular exaggeration, but it provoked an explosion from
Facino.</p>
<p>"God confound me if I understand how they hold out. With two
thousand ravenous soldiers in the place, a week should have brought
them to starvation."</p>
<p>Koenigshofen thoughtfully stroked his square red beard. "It's
colossally mysterious," said he.</p>
<p>"Mysterious, aye! That's what plagues me. They must be fed from
outside."</p>
<p>"That is quite impossible!" Carmagnola was emphatic. As Facino's
lieutenant, it fell to his duty to see that the cordon was properly
maintained.</p>
<p>"Yet what is the alternative," wondered Bellarion, "unless they
are eating one another?"</p>
<p>Carmagnola's blue eyes flashed upon him almost malevolently, for
this further reflection upon his vigilance.</p>
<p>"You set me riddles," he said disdainfully.</p>
<p>"And you're not good at riddles, Francesco," drawled Bellarion,
meeting malice with malice. "I should have remembered it."</p>
<p>Carmagnola heaved himself up. "Now, by the bones of God, what do
you mean?"</p>
<p>The ears of the ill-humoured Facino had caught a distant
sound.</p>
<p>"Quiet, you bellowing calf!" he snapped. "Listen! Listen! Who
comes at that breakneck speed?"</p>
<p>It was a hot breathless night of July, and the windows stood
wide to invite a cooling draught. As the four men, so bidden, grew
attentive, they caught from the distance the beat of galloping
hooves.</p>
<p>"It's not from Alessandria," said Koenigshofen.</p>
<p>"No, no," grunted Facino, and thereafter they listened in
silence.</p>
<p>There was no reason for it, save such colour as men's imaginings
will give a sound breaking the deathly stillness of a hot dark
night, yet each conceived and perhaps intercommunicated a feeling
that these hooves approaching so rapidly were harbingers of
portents.</p>
<p>Carmagnola went to the door as two riders clattered down the
village street, and, seeing the tall figure silhouetted against the
light from within, they slackened pace.</p>
<p>"The Lord Facino Cane of Biandrate? Where is he quartered?"</p>
<p>"Here," roared Carmagnola, and at the single word the horses
were pulled up with a rasping of hooves that struck fire from the
ground.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-12" id="ch-2-12"></a>CHAPTER XII. VISCONTI
FAITH</h2>
<p>If Facino Cane's eyes grew wide in astonishment to see his
countess ushered into that mean chamber by Carmagnola, wider still
they did grow to behold the man who accompanied her and to consider
their inexplicable conjunction. For this man was Giovanni Pusterla
of Venegono, cousin to that Pusterla who had been Castellan of
Monza and who, by Gian Maria's orders, had procured the
assassination of Gian Maria's mother.</p>
<p>In a vain attempt to mask his own matricide, to make the crime
appear as the work of another, Gian Maria had seized the
unfortunate Castellan, who had served his evil will too faithfully,
and, charging him with the crime, caused him barbarously and
without trial to be done to death. Thereafter, because he perceived
that this did not suffice to turn the public mind from the
conviction of his own horrible guilt, Gian Maria had vowed the
extermination of the Pusterla family as a blood-offering to the
Manes of his murdered mother. It was a Pusterla whom he had hunted
with his dogs into the arms of Bellarion in the meadows of
Abbiategrasso; and that was the fifth innocent member of the family
whom he had done to death in satisfaction of his abominable
vow.</p>
<p>This Pusterla of Venegono, who now led the Countess Beatrice
into her husband's presence, was a slight but vigorous and
moderately tall man of not more than thirty, despite the grey that
so abundantly mingled with his thick black hair. His shaven
countenance was proud and resolute, with a high-bridged nose
flanked perhaps too closely by dark eyes that glowed and flashed as
in reflection of his superabundant energy of body and of
spirit.</p>
<p>Between himself and Facino there was esteem, but no other link
to account for his sudden appearance as an escort to the Lady
Beatrice.</p>
<p>From the settle which he occupied, his ailing leg stretched upon
it, the amazed Facino greeted them by a rough soldier's oath on a
note of interrogation.</p>
<p>The countess, white and lovely, swept towards him.</p>
<p>"You are ailing, Facino!" Concern changed her murmuring voice as
she stooped to receive his kiss.</p>
<p>His countenance brightened, but his tone was almost testy. To
discuss his ailments now was but to delay the explanation that he
craved. "That I ail is no matter. That you should be here...What
brings you, Bice, and with Venegono there?"</p>
<p>"Aye, we take you by surprise," she answered him. "Yet Heaven
knows there would be no need for that if ever you had heeded me, if
ever you had used your eyes and your wits as I bade you."</p>
<p>"Will you tell me what brings you, and leave the rest?"</p>
<p>She hesitated a moment, then swung imperially to her travelling
companion. "Tell him, Messer da Venegono."</p>
<p>Venegono responded instantly. He spoke rapidly, using gestures
freely, his face an ever-shifting mirror of his feelings, so that
at once you knew him for a brisk-minded impulsive man. "We are here
to speak of what is happening in Milan. Do you know nothing of it,
my lord?"</p>
<p>"In Milan? Despatches reach me weekly from his highness. They
report nothing that is not reassuring."</p>
<p>The countess laughed softly, bitterly. Venegono plunged on.</p>
<p>"Is it reassuring to you that the Malatesta of Rimini, Pandolfo
and his brother Carlo are there with an army five thousand
strong?"</p>
<p>Facino was genuinely startled. "They are moving against
Milan?"</p>
<p>Again the countess laughed, and this time Venegono laughed with
her.</p>
<p>"Against it?" And he launched his thunderbolt. "They are there
at the express invitation of the Duke." Without pausing for breath
he completed the tale. "On the second of the month the Lady Antonia
Malatesta was married to Duke Gian Maria, and her father has been
created Governor of Milan."</p>
<p>A dead silence followed. The thing was utterly incredible.
Facino refused to believe it, and said so at last with an oath.</p>
<p>"My lord, I tell you of things that I have witnessed," Venegono
insisted.</p>
<p>"Witnessed? Have you been in Milan? You?"</p>
<p>Venegono's features twisted into a crooked smile. "After all,
there are still enough staunch Ghibellines in Milan to afford me
shelter. I take my precautions, Lord Count. But I do not run from
danger. No Pusterla ever did; which is why this hellhound Duke has
made so many victims."</p>
<p>Appalled, Facino looked at him from under heavy brows. Then his
lady spoke, a faint smile of bitter derision on her pale face.</p>
<p>"You'll understand now why I am here, Facino. You'll see that it
was no longer safe in Milan for Facino's wife: the wife of the man
whose ruin is determined and to be purchased by the Duke at all
costs, even at the cost of putting his neck under Malatesta's
heel."</p>
<p>Facino's mind, however, was still entirely absorbed by the main
issue.</p>
<p>"But Gabriello?" he cried.</p>
<p>"Gabriello, my lord," said Venegono promptly, "is as much a
victim, and has been taken as fully by surprise as you and every
Ghibelline in Milan. It is all the work of della Torre. To what end
he strives only himself and Satan know. Perhaps he will lead Gian
Maria to destruction in the end. It may be his way of resuming the
old struggle for supremacy between Visconti and Torriani. Anyhow,
his is the guiding brain."</p>
<p>"But did that weak bastard Gabriello never raise a hand?"</p>
<p>"Gabriello, my lord, has gone to earth for his own safety's sake
in the Castle of Porta Giovia. There Malatesta is besieging him,
and the city has been converted into an armed camp labouring to
reduce its own citadel. That monster, Gian Maria, has set a price
upon the head of the brother who has so often shielded him from the
just wrath of the Commune and the people. There is a price, too,
upon the heads of his cousins Antonio and Francesco Visconti, who
are with Gabriello in the fortress, together with many other
Ghibellines among whom my own cousin Giovanni Pusterla. Lord!" he
ended passionately, "if the great Galeazzo could but come to life
again to see the filthy shambles his horrible son has made of the
great realm he built!"</p>
<p>Silence followed. Facino, his head lowered, his brows knitted,
was drawing a geometrical figure on the table with the point of a
knife. Presently, while so engaged, he spoke slowly,
sorrowfully:</p>
<p>"I am the last of all those condottieri who were Gian Galeazzo's
brothers-in-arms; the last of those who helped him build up the
great State, which his degenerate son daily dishonours. His
faithless, treacherous nature drove the others away from him one by
one, each taking some part of his dominions to make an independent
State for himself. I alone have remained, loyally to serve and
support his tottering throne, making war upon my brother
condottieri in his defence, suffering for him and from him for the
sake of his great father who was my friend, for the sake of the
trust which his father left me when he died. And now I have my
wages. I am sent to restore Alessandria to the pestilential hands
of these false Visconti from which it has been wrested, and whilst
I am about this errand my place is usurped by the greatest Guelph
in Italy and measures are taken to prevent my ever returning." His
voice almost broke.</p>
<p>There was a long-drawn sigh from the countess. "There is no need
to tell you more," she murmured. "You begin to open your eyes and
to see for yourself at last."</p>
<p>And then Venegono was speaking.</p>
<p>"I come to you, Facino, in the name of all the Ghibellines of
Milan, who look to you as to their natural leader, who trust you
and have no hope save in you. Before this Guelphic outrage they
cringe in terror of the doom that creeps upon them. Already Milan
is a city of blood and horror. You are our party's only hope,
Milan's only hope, in this dreadful hour."</p>
<p>Facino buried the knife-blade deep in the table with sudden
violence, and left it quivering there. He raised at last his eyes.
They were blood-injected, and the whole expression of his face had
changed. The good nature of which it habitually wore the stamp had
been entirely effaced.</p>
<p>"Let God but heal this leg of mine," he said, "and from my hands
the Visconti shall eat the fruits of treachery until they choke
them."</p>
<p>He stretched out his hand as he spoke towards the crucifix that
hung upon the wall, making of his threat a solemn vow.</p>
<p>Bellarion, looking beyond him at the countess, read in the
covert exultation of her face her assumption that her greed for
empire was at last promised gratification and her insensibility
that it should be purchased on terms that broke her husband's
heart.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-13" id="ch-2-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. THE
VICTUALLERS</h2>
<p>In the torrid heat of the following noontide, Bellarion rode
alone to visit Stoffel at Casalbagliano. He did not go round by the
lines, but straight across country, which brought him past the
inner posts of surveillance and as close under the red walls of
Alessandria as it was safe to go.</p>
<p>The besieged city seemed to sleep in the breathless heat of the
low-lying lands upon which it had been reared. Saving an occasional
flash of steel from the weapon or breastplate of some sentinel on
the battlements, there was no sign of a life which starvation must
by now have reduced to the lowest ebb.</p>
<p>As Bellarion rode he meditated upon the odd course of
unpremeditated turbulence which he had run since leaving the
seclusion of Cigliano a year ago. He had travelled far indeed from
his original intention, and he marvelled now at the ease with which
he had adapted himself to each new set of circumstances he met,
applying in wordly practice all that he had learnt in theory by his
omnivorous studies. From a mental vigour developed by those studies
he drew an increasing consciousness of superiority over those with
whom fate associated him, a state of mind which did not bring him
to respect his fellow-man.</p>
<p>Greed seemed to Bellarion that morning the dominant impulse of
worldly life. He saw it, and all the stark selfish evil of it,
wherever he turned his retrospective glance. Most cruelly, perhaps,
had he seen it last night in the Countess Beatrice, who dignified
it&mdash;as was common&mdash;by the name of ambition. She would be well
served, he thought, if that ambition were gratified in such a way
that she should curse its fruit with every hour of life that might
be hers thereafter. Thus might she yet save her silly empty
soul.</p>
<p>He was drawn abruptly from the metaphysical to the physical by
two intrusions upon his consciousness. The first was a spent
arbalist-bolt, which struck the crupper of his horse and made it
bound forward, a reminder to Bellarion that he had all but got
within range of those red walls. The second was a bright object
gleaming a yard or two ahead of him along the track he
followed.</p>
<p>The whole of Facino's army might have passed that way seeing in
that bright object a horseshoe and nothing more. But Bellarion's
mind was of a different order. He read quite fluently in that iron
shoe that it had been cast from the hind hoof of a mule, and this
within the last twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Two nights ago a thunderstorm had rolled down from the
Montferrine hills, which were now hazily visible in the distance on
his right. Had the shoe been cast before that, rust must have
dimmed its polished brightness, yet, as closer examination
confirmed, no single particle of rust had formed upon it. Bellarion
asked himself a question: Since no strangers were allowed to come
or go within the lines, what man of Facino's had, during the last
two days, ridden to a point so barely out of range of an
arbalist-bolt from the city? And why had he ridden a mule?</p>
<p>He had dismounted, and he now picked up the shoe, to make a
further discovery. A thick leather-cased pad attached to the
under-side of it.</p>
<p>He did not mount again, but leading his horse he proceeded
slowly on foot along the track that led to Casalbagliano.</p>
<p>It was an hour later when the outposts challenged him on the
edge of the village. He found Stoffel sitting down to dinner when
he reached the house where the Swiss was quartered.</p>
<p>"You keep an indifferent watch somewhere between here and
Aulara;" was Bellarion's greeting.</p>
<p>"You often bewilder me," Stoffel complained.</p>
<p>"Here's to enlighten you, then."</p>
<p>Bellarion slapped down the shoe on the table, adding precise
information as to where he had found it and his reasons for
supposing it so recently cast.</p>
<p>"And that's not all. For half a mile along that track there was
a white trail in the grass, which investigation proved to be
wheaten flour, dribbled from some sack that went that way perhaps
last night."</p>
<p>Stoffel was aghast. He had not sufficient men, he confessed, to
guard every yard of the line, and, after all, the nights could be
very dark when there was no moon.</p>
<p>"I'll answer for it that you shall have more men tonight,"
Bellarion promised him, and without waiting to dine, rode back in
haste to Pavone.</p>
<p>He came there upon a council of war debating an assault upon
Alessandria now that starvation must have enfeebled the
besieged.</p>
<p>In his present impatience Facino could not even wait until his
leg, which was beginning to mend, should be well again. Therefore
he was delegating the command to Carmagnola, and considering with
him, as well as with Koenigshofen and Giasone Trotta, the measures
to be taken. Monna Beatrice was at her siesta above stairs in the
house's best room.</p>
<p>Bellarion's news brought them vexation and dismay.</p>
<p>Soon, however, Carmagnola was grandiosely waving these
aside.</p>
<p>"It matters little now that we have decided upon assault."</p>
<p>"It matters everything, I think," said Bellarion, and so drew
upon himself the haughty glare of Facino's magnificent lieutenant.
Always, it seemed, must those two be at odds. "Your decision rests
upon the assumption that the garrison is weakened by starvation. My
discovery alters that."</p>
<p>Facino was nodding slowly, gloomily, when Carmagnola, a reckless
gambler in military matters, ready now to stake all upon the chance
of distinction which his leader's illness afforded him, broke in
assertively.</p>
<p>"We'll take the risk of that. You are now in haste, my lord, to
finish here, and there is danger for you in delay."</p>
<p>"More danger surely in precipitancy," said Bellarion, and so put
Carmagnola in a rage.</p>
<p>"God rid me of your presumption!" he cried. "At every turn you
intrude your green opinions upon seasoned men of war."</p>
<p>"He was right at Travo," came the guttural tones of
Koenigshofen, "and he may be right again."</p>
<p>"And in any case," added Trotta, who knew the fortifications of
Alessandria better than any of them, "if there is any doubt about
the state of the garrison it would be madness to attack the place.
We might pay a heavy price to resolve that doubt."</p>
<p>"Yet how else are we to resolve it?" Carmagnola demanded, seeing
in delay the loss of his own opportunity.</p>
<p>"That," said Bellarion quietly, "is what you should be
considering."</p>
<p>"Considering?" Carmagnola would have added more, but Facino's
suddenly raised hand arrested him.</p>
<p>"Considering&mdash;yes," said the condottiero. "The situation is
changed by what Bellarion tells us, and it is for us to study it
anew."</p>
<p>Reluctant though he might be to put this further curb upon his
impatience, yet he recognized the necessity.</p>
<p>Not so, however, his lieutenant. "But Bellarion may be mistaken.
The evidence, after all&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Was hardly necessary," Bellarion interrupted. "If Vignate had
really been in the straits we have supposed, he must have
continued, and ever more desperately, his attempts to fight his way
out. Having found means to obtain supplies from without, he has
remained inactive, because he wishes you to believe him starving,
so that you may attack him. When he has damaged and weakened you by
hurling back your assault, then he will come out in force to
complete your discomfiture."</p>
<p>"You have it all clear!" sneered Carmagnola. "And you see it all
in the cast shoe of a mule and a few grains of wheat." He swung
about to the others, flinging wide his arms. "Listen to him! Learn
your trade, sirs! Go to school to Master Bellarion."</p>
<p>"Indeed, you might do worse," cut in Facino, and so struck him
into gaping, angry amazement. "Bellarion reasons soundly enough to
put your wits to shame. When I listen to him&mdash;God help me!&mdash;I begin
to ask myself if the gout is in my leg or my brains. Continue, boy.
What else have you to say?"</p>
<p>"Nothing more until we capture one of these victualling parties.
That may be possible tonight if you double, or even treble,
Stoffel's force."</p>
<p>"Possible it may be," said Facino. "But how exactly do you
propose that it be done?"</p>
<p>Bellarion took a stick of charcoal and on the pine board drew
lines to elucidate his plan. "Here the track runs. From this the
party cannot stray by more than a quarter-mile on either side, for
here the river, and there another watercourse, thickly fringed with
young poplars, will prevent it. I would post the men in an unbroken
double line along an arc drawn across this quarter-mile from
watercourse to watercourse. At some point of that arc the party
must strike it, as fish strike a net. When that happens the two
ends of the arc will swing inwards until they meet, thus completely
enclosing their prey against the chance of any single man escaping
to give the alarm."</p>
<p>Facino nodded, smiling through his gloom. "Does anyone suggest a
better, way?"</p>
<p>After a pause it was Carmagnola who spoke. "That plan should
answer as well as any other." Though he yielded, vanity would not,
permit him to do so graciously. "If you approve of it, my lord, I
will see the necessary measures taken."</p>
<p>But Facino pursed his lips in doubt. "I think," he said after a
moment's pause, "that Bellarion might be given charge of the
affair. He has it all so clear."</p>
<p>Thus it fell out that, before evening, Bellarion was back again
in Stoffel's quarters. To Casalbagliano also were moved after night
had fallen two hundred Germans from Koenigshofen's command at
Aulara. Not until then did Bellarion cast that wide human arc of
his athwart the track, exactly midway between Casalbagliano and
Alessandria, from the Tanaro on the one side to the lesser
watercourse on the other. Himself he took up his station in the
arc's middle, on the track itself. Stoffel was given charge of the
right wing, and another Swiss named Wenzel placed in command of the
left.</p>
<p>The darkness deepened as the night advanced. Again a
thunderstorm was descending from the hills of Montferrat, and the
clouds blotted out the stars until the hot gloom wrapped them about
like black velvet. Even so, however, Bellarion's order was that the
men should lie prone, lest their silhouettes be seen against the
sky.</p>
<p>Thus in utter silence they waited through the breathless hours
that were laden by a storm which would not break. Midnight came and
went, and Bellarion's hopes were beginning to sink, when at last a
rhythmical sound grew faintly audible&mdash;the soft beat of padded
hooves upon the yielding turf. Scarcely had they made out the sound
than the mule-train, advancing in almost ghostly fashion, was upon
them.</p>
<p>The leader of the victualling party who, knowing himself well
within the ordinary lines, had for some time now been accounting
himself secure, was startled to find his way suddenly barred by a
human wall which appeared to rise out of the ground. He seized the
bridle of his mule in a firmer grip and swung the beast about even
as he yelled an order. There was a sudden stampede, cries and
imprecations in the dark, and the train was racing back through the
night, presently to find its progress barred by a line of pikes.
This way and that the victuallers flung in their desperate
endeavours to escape. But relentlessly and in utter silence the net
closed about them. Narrower and narrower and ever denser grew the
circle that enclosed them, until they were hemmed about in no more
space than I would comfortably contain them.</p>
<p>Then at last lights gleamed. A dozen lanterns were uncovered
that Bellarion might take stock of his capture. The train consisted
of a score of mules with bulging panniers, and half a dozen men
captained by a tall loose-limbed fellow with a bearded pock-marked
face. Sullenly they stood in the lantern-light, realizing the
futility of struggling, and already in fancy feeling the rope about
their gullets.</p>
<p>Bellarion asked no questions. To Stoffel, who had approached him
as the ring closed, he issued his orders briefly. They were
surprising, but Stoffel never placed obedience in doubt. A hundred
men under Wenzel to remain in charge of the mules at the spot where
they had been captured until Bellarion should make known his
further wishes; twenty men to escort the muleteers, disarmed and
pinioned, back to Casalbagliano; the others to be dismissed to
their usual quarters.</p>
<p>A half-hour later, in the kitchen of the peasant's house on the
outskirts of Casalbagliano, where Stoffel had taken up his
temporary residence, Bellarion and the captured leader faced each
other.</p>
<p>The prisoner, his wrists pinioned behind him, stood between two
Swiss pikemen, whilst Bellarion, holding a candle level with his
face, scanned those pallid pock-marked features, which seemed
vaguely familiar.</p>
<p>"We've met before, I think&mdash;" Bellarion broke off. It was the
beard that had made an obstacle for his memory. "You are the false
friar who journeyed with me to Casale, that brigand
named...Lorenzaccio da Trino."</p>
<p>The beady eyes blinked in terror. "I don't deny it. But I was
your friend then, and but for that blundering peasant&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Quiet!" he was curtly bidden. Bellarion set down the candle on
the table, which was oak, rough-hewn and ponderous as a refectory
board, and himself sat down in the arm-chair that stood by its
head. Fearfully Lorenzaccio considered him, taking stock of the
richness of his apparel and the air of authority by which the timid
convent nursling of a year ago was now invested. His fears withheld
him from any philosophical reflections upon the mutability of human
fortunes.</p>
<p>Suddenly Bellarion's bold dark eyes were upon him, and the
brigand shuddered despite the stifling heat of the night. "You know
what awaits you?"</p>
<p>"I know the risks I ran. But&mdash;"</p>
<p>"A rope, my friend. I tell you, so as to dispel any fond doubt."
The man reeled a little, his knees sagging under him. The guards
steadied him. Watching him, Bellarion seemed almost to smile. Then
he took his chin in his hand, and for a long moment there was
silence save for the prisoner's raucous, agitated breathing. At
last Bellarion spoke again, very slowly&mdash;painfully slowly to the
listening man, since he discerned his fate to be wrapped up in
Bellarion's words.</p>
<p>"You claim that once you stood my friend. Whether you would,
indeed, have stood my friend to the end I do not know.
Circumstances parted us prematurely. But before that happened you
had stolen all that I had. Still, it is possible you would have
repaid me had the chance been yours."</p>
<p>"I would! I would!" the wretched man protested. "By the Mother
of God, I would!"</p>
<p>"I am so foolish as to permit myself to believe you. And
remember that your life hangs upon my belief. You were the
instrument chosen by Fate to shape my course for me, and there is
on my part a desire to stand your friend&mdash;"</p>
<p>"God reward you for that! God&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Quiet! You interrupt me. First I shall require proof of your
goodwill."</p>
<p>"Proof!" Lorenzaccio was confused. "What proof can I give?"</p>
<p>"You can answer my questions, clearly and truthfully. That will
be proof enough. But at the first sign of prevarication there will
be worse than death for you, as certainly as there will be death at
the end. Be open with me now, and you shall have your life and
presently your freedom."</p>
<p>The questions followed, and the answers came too promptly to
leave Bellarion any suspicion of invention. He tested them by
cross-questions, and was left satisfied that from fear of death and
hope of life Lorenzaccio answered truthfully throughout. For a
half-hour, perhaps, the examination continued, and left Bellarion
in possession of all the information that he needed. Lorenzaccio
was in the pay of Girolamo Vignate, Cardinal of Desana, a brother
of the besieged tyrant, who, operating from Cantalupo was sending
these mule-trains of victuals into Alessandria on every night when
the absence of moonlight made it possible; the mules were left in
the city to be eaten, together with their loads, and the men made
their way back on foot from the city gates; the only one ever
permitted to enter was Lorenzaccio himself, who invariably returned
upon the morrow in possession of the password to gain admission on
the next occasion. He had crossed the lines, he confessed, more
than a dozen times in the last three weeks. Further, Bellarion
elicited from him a minute description of the Cardinal of Desana,
of Giovanni Vignate of Lodi and of the principal persons usually
found in attendance upon him, of the topography of Alessandria, and
of much else besides. Many of his answers Bellarion took down in
writing.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-14" id="ch-2-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. THE
MULETEER</h2>
<p>It wanted less than an hour to dawn when the mule-train came up
to the Southern Gate of Alessandria, and its single leader
disturbed the silence of the night by a shrill whistle thrice
repeated.</p>
<p>A moment later a light showed behind the grating by the narrow
postern gate, built into the wall beside the portcullis. A voice
bawled a challenge across the gulf.</p>
<p>"Who comes?"</p>
<p>"Messenger from Messer Girolamo," answered the muleteer.</p>
<p>"Give the word of the night."</p>
<p>"Lodi triumphant."</p>
<p>The light was moved, and presently followed a creaking of
winches and a rattle of heavy chains. A great black mass, faintly
discernible against the all encompassing darkness, slowly descended
outwards and came to rest with a thud almost at the very feet of
the muleteer. Across that lowered drawbridge the archway of the
guard-house glowed in light and revealed itself aswarm with
men-at-arms under the jagged teeth of the raised portcullis.</p>
<p>The muleteer spoke to the night. He took farewell of men who
were not with him, and called instructions after someone of whom
there was no sign, then drove his laden mules across the bridge,
and himself came last into the light, amid the men-at-arms drawn up
there to ensure against treachery, ready to warn those who manned
the winches above in the event of an attempt to rush the
bridge.</p>
<p>The muleteer, a tall fellow, as tall as Lorenzaccio, but much
younger, dressed in a loose tunic of rough brown cloth with
leg-clothing of the same material cross-gartered to the knees,
found himself confronted by an officer who thrust a lantern into
his face.</p>
<p>"You are not Lorenzaccio!"</p>
<p>"Devil take you," answered the muleteer. "You needn't burn my
nose to find that out."</p>
<p>His easy impudence allayed suspicion. Besides, how was a
besieged garrison to suspect a man who brought in a train of mules
all laden with provisions?</p>
<p>"Who are you? What is your name?"</p>
<p>"I am called Beppo, which is short for Guiseppe. And tonight I
am the deputy of Lorenzaccio who has had an accident and narrowly
escaped a broken neck. No need to ask your name, my captain.
Lorenzaccio warned me I should meet here a fierce watchdog named
Chrisoforo, who would want to eat me alive when he saw me. But now
that I have seen you I don't believe him. Have you anything to
drink at hand, my captain? It's a plaguily thirsty night." And with
the back of his hand the muleteer swept the beads of sweat from his
broad comely forehead, leaving it clean of much of the grime that
elsewhere disfigured his countenance.</p>
<p>"You'll take your mules to the Communal," the captain answered
him shortly, resenting his familiarity.</p>
<p>Day was breaking when Messer Beppo came to the Communal Palace
and drove his mules into the courtyard, there to surrender them to
those whom he found waiting. It was a mixed group, made up of
Vignate's officers and representatives of the civic government. The
officers were well-nourished and vigorous, the citizens looked
feeble and emaciated, from which the muleteer inferred that in the
matter of rationing the citizens of Alessandria were being
sacrificed to the soldiery.</p>
<p>Messer Beppo, who for a muleteer was a singularly self-assertive
fellow, demanded to be taken at once to the Lord Giovanni Vignate.
They were short with him at first for his impudence, until he
brought a note almost of menace into his demand, whereupon an
officer undertook to conduct him to the citadel.</p>
<p>Over a narrow drawbridge they entered the rocca, which was the
heart of that great Guelphic fortress, and from a small courtyard
they ascended by a winding staircase of stone to a stone chamber
whose grey walls were bare of arras, whose Gothic windows were
unglazed and whose vaulted ceiling hung so low that the tall
muleteer could have touched it with his raised hand. A monkish
table of solid oak, an oaken bench and a high-backed chair were all
its furniture, and a cushion of crimson velvet the only sybaritic
touch in that chill austerity.</p>
<p>Leaving him there, the young officer passed through a narrow
door to a farther room. Thence came presently a swarthy man who was
squat and bowlegged, with thick pointing lips and an air of great
consequence. He was wrapped in a crimson gown that trailed along
the stone floor, and attended by a black-robed monk and a tall lean
man in a soldier's leathern tunic with sword and dagger hanging
from a rich belt.</p>
<p>The squat man's keen haughty eyes played searchingly over the
muleteer.</p>
<p>"I am to suppose you have a message for me," he said, and sat
down in the only chair. The monk, who was stout and elderly, found
a place on the bench, leaning his elbows on the table. The captain
stationed himself behind Vignate, whilst the officer who had
brought Messer Beppo lingered in the background by the wall.</p>
<p>The tall young muleteer lounged forward, no whit abashed in the
presence of the dread lord of Lodi.</p>
<p>"His Excellency the Cardinal of Desana desires you to
understand, my lord, that this mule-train of victuals is the last
one he will send."</p>
<p>"What?" Vignate clutched the arms of his chair and half-raised
himself from his seat. His countenance lost much of its chill
dignity.</p>
<p>"It isn't that it's no longer safe; but it's no longer possible.
Lorenzaccio, who has had charge of these expeditions, is a prisoner
in the hands of Facino. He was caught yesterday morning on his way
back from Alessandria. As likely as not he'll have been hanged by
now. But that's no matter. What is important is that they've found
us out, and the cordon is now so tightly drawn that it's madness to
try to get through."</p>
<p>"Yet you," said the tall captain, "have got through."</p>
<p>"By a stratagem that's not to be repeated. I took a chance. I
stampeded a dozen mules into Facino's lines near Aulara. At the
alarm there was a rush for the spot. It drew, as I had reckoned,
the men on guard between Aulara and Casalbagliano, leaving a gap.
In the dark I drove through that gap before it was repaired.''</p>
<p>"That was shrewd," said the captain.</p>
<p>"It was necessary," said Beppo shortly. "Necessary not only to
bring in these provisions, but to warn you that there are no more
to follow."</p>
<p>Vignate's eyes looked out of a face that had turned grey. The
man's bold manner and crisp speech intrigued him.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" he asked. "You are no muleteer."</p>
<p>"Your lordship is perspicacious. After Lorenzaccio was taken, no
muleteer could be found to run the gauntlet. I am a captain of
fortune. Beppo Farfalla, to serve your lordship. I lead a company
of three hundred lances, now at my lord Cardinal's orders at
Cantalupo. At my lord Cardnial's invitation I undertook this
adventure, in the hope that it may lead to employment."</p>
<p>"By God, if I am to be starved I am likely to offer you
employment."</p>
<p>"If your lordship waits to be starved. That was not my lord
Cardinal's view of what should happen."</p>
<p>"He'll teach me my trade, will he, my priestly brother?"</p>
<p>Messer Beppo shrugged. "As to that, he has some shrewd
notions."</p>
<p>"Notions! My lord Cardinal?" Vignate was very savage in his
chagrin. "What are these notions?"</p>
<p>"One of them is that this pouring of provisions into Alessandria
was as futile as the torment of the Danaides."</p>
<p>"Danaides? Who are they?"</p>
<p>"I hoped your lordship would know. I don't. I quote my lord
Cardinal's words; no more."</p>
<p>"It's a pagan allusion out of Appolodorus," the monk
explained.</p>
<p>"What my lord Cardinal means," said Beppo, "is that to victual
you was a sheer waste, since as long as it continued you sat here
doing nothing."</p>
<p>"Doing nothing!". Vignate was indignant. "Let him keep to his
Mass and his breviary and what else he understands."</p>
<p>"He understands more than your lordship supposes."</p>
<p>"More of what?"</p>
<p>"Of the art of war, my lord."</p>
<p>My lord laughed unpleasantly, being joined by his captain, but
not by the monk, whom it offended to see a cardinal derided.</p>
<p>And now Beppo went on: "He assumes that this news will, be the
spur you need."</p>
<p>"Why, damn his impudence and yours! I need no spur. You'll tell
him from me that I make war by my own judgment. If I have sat here
inactive, it is that I have sat here awaiting my chance."</p>
<p>"And now that the threat of starvation will permit you to sit
here no longer, you will be constrained to go out and seek that
chance."</p>
<p>"Seek it?" Vignate was frowning darkly, his eyes aflame. He
disliked this cockerel's easy, impudent tone. Captains of fortune
did not usually permit themselves such liberties with him. "Where
shall I seek it? Tell me that and I'll condone your insolence."</p>
<p>"My lord Cardinal thinks it might be sought in Facino's quarters
at Pavone."</p>
<p>"Oh yes; or in the Indies, or in Hell. They're as accessible. I
have made some sorties from here&mdash;four of them, and all disastrous.
Yet the disasters were due to no fault of mine."</p>
<p>"Is your lordship quite sure of that?" Messer Beppo smiled a
little.</p>
<p>The Lord of Lodi exploded. "Am I sure?" His grey face turned
purple and inflated. "Dare any man suggest that I am to blame?"</p>
<p>"My lord Cardinal dares. He more than suggests it. He says so
bluntly."</p>
<p>"And your impudence no doubt agrees with him?"</p>
<p>"Upon the facts, could my impudence do less?" His tone was
mocking. The three stared at him in sheer unbelief. "Consider now,
my lord: You made your sallies by day, in full view of an enemy who
could concentrate at whatever point you attacked, over ground upon
which it was almost impossible for your horse to charge
effectively. My lord Cardinal thinks that if you had earlier done
what the threat of starvation must now compel you to do, and make a
sally under cover of night, you might have been upon the enemy
lines before ever your movement could be detected and a
concentration made to hold you."</p>
<p>Vignate looked at him with heavy contempt, then shrugged. "A
priest's notion of war!" he sneered.</p>
<p>The tall captain took it up with Messer Beppo. Less disdainful
in tone, he no less conveyed his scorn of the Cardinal Girolamo's
ideas.</p>
<p>"Such an action would have been well if our only aim had been to
break through and escape, leaving Alessandria in Facino's hands.
But so ignoble an aim was never in my Lord Vignate's thoughts." He
leaned on the tall back of his master's chair and thrust out a
deprecatory lip.</p>
<p>"Necessity may unfortunately bring him to consider it now
that&mdash;"</p>
<p>Messer Beppo interrupted him with a laugh.</p>
<p>"The necessity is no more present now than it has ever been.
Facino Cane will lie as much at your mercy tomorrow night as he has
lain on any night in all these weeks of your inaction."</p>
<p>"What do you say?" breathed Vignate. "At our mercy?" The three
of them stared at him.</p>
<p>"At your mercy. A bold stroke and it is done. The line drawn out
on a periphery some eighteen miles in length is very tenuous. There
are strong posts at Marengo, Aulara, Casalbagliano and San
Michele."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. This we know."</p>
<p>"Marengo and San Michele have been weakened since yesterday to
strengthen the line from Aulara to Casalbagliano, in view of the
discovery that Alessandria has been fed from there. Aulara and
Casalbagliano are the posts farthest from Pavone, which is the
strongest post of all, and Facino's quarters."</p>
<p>Vignate's eyes began to kindle. He was sufficiently a soldier,
after all, to perceive whither Messer Beppo was going. "Yes, yes,"
he mattered.</p>
<p>"Under cover of night a strong force could creep out by the
Northern Gate so as to be across the Tanaro at the outset, and,
going round by the river, fall upon Pavone almost before an alarm
could be raised. Before supports could be brought up you would have
broken the force that is stationed there. The capture of Facino and
his chief captains, who are with him, would be as certain as that
the sun is rising now. After that, your besiegers would be a body
without a head."</p>
<p>Followed a silence. Vignate licked his thick lips as he sat
huddled there considering.</p>
<p>"By God!" he said, and again after further thought, "By God!" He
looked at his tall captain. The captain tightened his lips and
nodded.</p>
<p>"It is well conceived," he said.</p>
<p>"Well conceived!" cried Beppo on that note of ready laughter.
"No better conception is possible in your present pass. You snatch
victory from defeat."</p>
<p>His confidence inspired them visibly. Then Vignate asked a
question:</p>
<p>"What is Facino's force at Pavone? Is it known?"</p>
<p>"Some four or five hundred men. No more. With half that number
you could overpower them if you took them by surprise."</p>
<p>"I do not run unnecessary risks. I'll take six hundred."</p>
<p>"Your lordship has decided, then?" said the tall captain.</p>
<p>"What else, Rocco?"</p>
<p>Rocco fingered his bearded chin. "It should succeed. I'd be
easier if I were sure the enveloping movement could be made without
giving the alarm."</p>
<p>Unbidden, the audacious Messer Beppo broke into their
counsel.</p>
<p>"Ay, that's the difficulty. But it can be overcome. That is
where I can serve you; I and my three hundred lances. I move them
round during the day wide of the lines and bring up behind Pavone,
at Pietramarazzi. At the concerted hour I push them forward, right
up against Facino's rear, and at the moment that you attack in
front I charge from behind, and the envelopment is made."</p>
<p>"But how to know each other in the dark?" said Rocco. "Your
force and ours might come to grips, each supposing the other to be
Facino's."</p>
<p>"My men shall wear their shirts over their armour if yours will
do the same."</p>
<p>"Lord of Heaven!" said Vignate. "You have it all thought
out."</p>
<p>"That is my way. That is how I succeed."</p>
<p>Vignate heaved himself up. On his broad face it was to be read
that he had made up his mind.</p>
<p>"Let it be tonight, then. There is no gain in delay, nor can our
stomachs brook it. You are to be depended upon, Captain
Farfalla?"</p>
<p>"If we come to terms," said Beppo easily. "I'm not in the
business for the love of adventure."</p>
<p>Vignate's countenance sobered from its elation. His eyes
narrowed. He became the man of affairs. "And your terms?" quoth
he.</p>
<p>"A year's employment for myself and my condotta at a monthly
stipend of fifteen thousand gold florins."</p>
<p>"God of Heaven!" Vignate ejaculated. "Is that all?" And he
laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>"It is for your lordship to refuse."</p>
<p>"It is for you to be reasonable. Fifteen thou...Besides, I don't
want your condotta for a year."</p>
<p>"But I prefer the security of a year's employment. It is
security for you, too, of a sort. You'll be well served."</p>
<p>"Ten thousand florins for your assistance in this job," said
Vignate firmly.</p>
<p>"I'll be wishing you good morning," said Messer Beppo as firmly.
"I know my value."</p>
<p>"You take advantage of my urgent needs," Vignate complained.</p>
<p>"And you forget what you already owe me for having risked my
neck in coming here."</p>
<p>After that they haggled for a full half-hour, and if guarantees
of Messer Beppo's good faith had been lacking, they had it in the
tenacity with which he clung to his demands.</p>
<p>At long length the Lord of Lodi yielded, but with an ill grace
and with certain mental reservations notwithstanding the bond drawn
up by his monkish secretary. With that parchment in his pocket
Messer Beppo went gaily to breakfast with the Lord Vignate, and
thereafter took his leave and slipped out of the city to carry to
the Cardinal at Desana the news of the decision, and to prepare for
his own part in it.</p>
<p>It was a dazzling morning, all sign of the storm having been
swept from the sky and the air being left the cleaner for its
passage.</p>
<p>Messer Beppo smiled as he walked, presumably because on such a
morning it was good to live. He was still smiling when, towards
noon of the same day, he strode unannounced into Facino's quarters
at Pavone.</p>
<p>Facino was at dinner with his three captains, and the countess
faced her lord at the foot of the board. He looked up as the
newcomer strode to the empty place at the table.</p>
<p>"You're late, Bellarion. We have been awaiting you and your
report. Was there any attempt last night to put a victualling party
across the lines?"</p>
<p>"There was," said Bellarion.</p>
<p>"And you caught them?"</p>
<p>"We caught them. Yes. Nevertheless, the mule-train and the
victuals won into Alessandria."</p>
<p>They looked at him in wonder. Carmagnola laughed contemptuously.
"How, sir? And this in spite of your boast that you caught
them?"</p>
<p>Bellarion fixed him with eyes that were red and rather bleary
from lack of sleep.</p>
<p>"In spite of it," he agreed. "The fact is, that mule-train was
conducted into Alessandria by myself." And he sat down in the
silence that followed.</p>
<p>"Do you say that you've been into Alessandria?"</p>
<p>"Into the very citadel. I had breakfast with the squat Lord of
Lodi."</p>
<p>"Will you explain yourself?" cried Facino irritably.</p>
<p>Bellarion did so.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-15" id="ch-2-15"></a>CHAPTER XV. THE
CAMISADE</h2>
<p>The sequel you already guess, and its telling need not keep us
long.</p>
<p>That night Vignate and six hundred men, wearing their shirts
over their armour, rode into as pretty an ambush about the village
of Pavone as is to be found in the history of such operations. It
was a clear night, and although there was no moon there was just
light enough from the star-flecked sky to make it ideal, from the
point of view of either party, for the business in hand.</p>
<p>There was some rough fighting for perhaps a half-hour, and a
good deal of blood was shed; Vignate's men, infuriated at finding
themselves trapped, fought viciously, and invited hard knocks in
return.</p>
<p>Bellarion in the handsome armour of Boucicault's gift, but
without a headpiece, to which as yet he had been unable to accustom
himself, held aloof from the furious scrimmage, just as he had held
aloof from the jousts in Milan. He had a horror of personal
violence and manhandling, which some contemporaries who detected it
have accounted a grave flaw in his nature. Nevertheless, one blow
at least for his side was forced upon him, and, all things
considered, it was a singularly appropriate blow. It was towards
the end of the fight, just as the followers of Vignate began to own
defeat and throw down their weapons, that one man all cased in
armour and with a headpiece whose peaked vizor gave him the
appearance of some monstrous bird, came charging furiously at the
ring of enemies that confined him. He was through and over them in
that terrific charge, and the way of escape was clear before him,
save for the aloof Bellarion, who of his own volition would have
made no move to check that impetuous career. But the fool must
needs drive straight at Bellarion through the gloom. Bellarion
pulled his horse aside, and by that swerve avoided the couched
lance which he suspected rather than saw. Then, rising in his
stirrups as that impetuous knight rushed by, he crashed the mace
with which he had armed himself upon the peaked vizor, and rolled
his assailant from the saddle.</p>
<p>Thereafter he behaved with knightly consideration. He got down
from his horse and relieved the fallen warrior of his helmet so as
to give him air, which presently revived him. By the usages of
chivalry the man was Bellarion's prisoner.</p>
<p>The fight was over. Already men with lanterns were going over
the meadow which had served for battle ground; and into the village
of Pavone, to the great alarm of its rustic inhabitants, the
disarmed survivors of Vignate's force, amounting still to close
upon five hundred, were being closely herded by Facino's men.
Through this dense press Bellarion conducted his prisoner, in the
charge of two Burgundians.</p>
<p>In the main room of Facino's quarters captor and captive first
confronted each other in the light. Bellarion laughed as he looked
into that flat swarthy countenance with the pouting lips that were
frothing now with rage.</p>
<p>"You filthy, venal hound! You've sold yourself to the highest
bidder! Had I known it was you, you might have slit my throat or
ever I should have surrendered to you."</p>
<p>Facino in the chair to which his swathed leg confined him and
Carmagnola who had come but a moment ago to report the engagement
at an end, stared now at Bellarion's raging prisoner, in whom they
recognized Vignate. And meanwhile Bellarion was answering him.</p>
<p>"I was never for sale, my lord. You are not discerning. I was my
Lord Facino's man when I sought you this morning in
Alessandria."</p>
<p>Vignate looked at him, and incredulity was tempering the hate of
his glance.</p>
<p>"It was a trick!" He could hardly believe that a man should have
dared so much. "You are not Farfalla, captain of fortune?"</p>
<p>"My name is Bellarion."</p>
<p>"It's the name of a trickster, then; a cheat, a foul treacherous
hind who imposed upon me with lies." He looked past his captor at
Facino, who was smiling. "Is this how you fight, Facino?"</p>
<p>"Merciful God!" Facino laughed. "Are you to prate of chivalry
and knight-errantry, you faithless brigand! Count it against him,
Bellarion, when you fix his ransom. He is your prisoner. If he were
mine I'd not enlarge him under fifty thousand ducats. His people of
Lodi should find the money, and so learn what it means to harbour
such a tyrant."</p>
<p>Savage eyes glowered at Facino. Pouting lips were twisted in
vicious hate. "Pray God, Facino, that you never fall prisoner of
mine."</p>
<p>Bellarion tapped his shoulder, and tapped hard. "I do not like
you, Messer Vignate. You're a fool, and the world is troubled
already by so many of your kind. So little am I venal that from a
sense of duty to mankind I might send your head to the Duke of
Milan you betrayed, and so forgo the hundred thousand ducats ransom
you're to pay to me."</p>
<p>Vignate's mouth fell open.</p>
<p>"Say nothing more," Bellarion admonished him. "What you've said
so far has already cost you fifty thousand ducats. Insolence is a
costly luxury in a prisoner." He turned to the attendant
Burgundians. "Take him above-stairs, strip off his armour, and bind
him securely."</p>
<p>"Why, you inhuman barbarian! I've surrendered to you. You have
my word."</p>
<p>"Your word!" Bellarion loosed a laugh that was like a blow in
the face. "Gian Galeazzo Visconti had your word, yet before he was
cold you were in arms against his son. I'll trust my bonds rather
than your word, my lord." He waved them out, and as he turned
Facino and Carmagnola saw that he was quivering.</p>
<p>"Trickster and cheat, eh! And to be called so by such a
Judas!"</p>
<p>Thus he showed what had stirred him. Yet not quite all. They
were not to guess that he could have borne the epithets with
equanimity if they had not reminded him of other lips that had
uttered them.</p>
<p>"Solace yourself with the ransom, boy. And you're not modest,
faith! A hundred thousand! Well, well!" Facino laughed. "You were
in luck to take Vignate prisoner."</p>
<p>"In luck, indeed," Carmagnola curtly agreed. Then turned to face
Facino. "And so, my lord, the affair is happily concluded."</p>
<p>"Concluded?" There was derision in Bellarion's interjection.</p>
<p>"Why, sir, the affair has not yet begun. This war no more than
the prelude."</p>
<p>"Prelude to what?"</p>
<p>"To the capture of Alessandria. It's to be taken before
daylight."</p>
<p>They stared at him, and Facino was frowning almost in
displeasure.</p>
<p>"You said nothing of this."</p>
<p>"I thought it would be clear. Why do I lure Vignate to make a
camisade from Alessandria with six hundred men wearing their shirts
over their arms, to be met there by another three hundred under
Captain Farfalla similarly bedecked? Nine hundred horsemen, or
thereabouts, with their shirts over their arms, will ride back in
triumph to Alessandria in the dim light of dawn. And the jubilant
garrison will lift up its gates to receive them."</p>
<p>"You intended that?" said Facino, when at last he found his
voice,</p>
<p>"What else? Is it not a logical consummation? You should break
your morning fast in Alessandria, my lord."</p>
<p>Facino, the great captain, looked almost with reverence at this
fledgling in the art of war.</p>
<p>"By God, boy! You should go far. At Travo you showed your
natural talent for this game of arms. But..."</p>
<p>"Shall we come to details?" said Bellarion to remind them that
time was precious.</p>
<p>Little, however, remained to be concerted. By Bellarion's
contriving the entire condotta was waiting under arms. Facino
offered Bellarion the command of what he called the white-shirts,
to be supported by Carmagnola with the main battle. Bellarion,
however, thought that Carmagnola should lead the white-shirts.</p>
<p>"Theirs will be the honour of the affair," Facino reminded him.
"I offer it to you as your due."</p>
<p>"Let Messer Carmagnola have it. What fighting there may be will
fall to the lot of the pretended returning camisaders when the
garrison discovers the imposture. There is a business which Messer
Carmagnola understands better than I do."</p>
<p>"You are generous, sir," said Carmagnola.</p>
<p>Bellarion looked sharply to see if he were sneering. But for
once Carmagnola was obviously sincere.</p>
<p>As Bellarion had planned, so the thing fell out.</p>
<p>In the grey light of breaking day, creeping pallid and
colourless as the moonstone over the meadows about Alessandria, the
anxious watchers from the walls beheld a host approaching, whose
white shirts announced them for Vignate and his raiders. Down went
drawbridge, up portcullis to admit them. Over the timbers of the
bridge they thundered, under the deep archway of the gatehouse they
streamed, and the waiting soldiery of Vignate deafened the ears of
the townsfolk with their cheers, which abruptly turned to cries of
rage and fear. For the camisaders were amongst them, beating them
down and back, breaking a way into the gatehouse, assuming
possession of the machinery that controlled drawbridge and
portcullis, and spreading themselves out into the square within to
hold the approaches of the gate. Their true quality was at last
revealed, and in the tall armoured man on the tall horse who led
and directed them Francesco Busone of Carmagnola was recognized by
many.</p>
<p>And now as the daylight grew, another host advanced upon the
city, the main battle of Facino's army. This was followed by yet a
third, a force detailed to escort the disarmed camisaders of
Vignate who were being brought back as prisoners.</p>
<p>When two hours later Facino broke his fast in the citadel, as
Bellarion had promised him that he should with his officers about
him, and his countess, her beauty all aglow, at the table's foot,
there was already peace and order in the captured city.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-16" id="ch-2-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. SEVERANCE</h2>
<p>The Knight Bellarion rode alone in the hot glow of an August
afternoon through the moist and fertile meadow-land between
Alessandria and San Michele. He was dejected by the sterility of
worldly achievement and mourned the futility of all worldly
endeavour. In endeavour, itself, as he had to admit from his own
experience, there was a certain dynamic entertainment, affording an
illusion of useful purpose. With achievement the illusion was
dispelled. The purpose grasped was so much water in the hands.
Man's greatest accomplishment was to produce change. Restlessness
abode in him, none the less, because no one state could be shown to
be better than another. The only good in life was study, because
study was an endeavour that never reached fulfilment. It busied a
man to the end of his days, and it aimed at the only true reality
in all this world of shams and deceits.</p>
<p>Messer Bellarion conceived that in abandoning the road to Pavia
and Master Chrysolaras he had missed his way in life. Nay, further,
his first false step had been taken when, driven by that heresy of
his, rooted in ignorance and ridiculous, he had quitted the
monastery of Cigliano. In conventual endeavour, after all, there
was a definite purpose. There, mortal existence was regarded as no
more than the antechamber to real life which lay in the hereafter:
a brief novitiate wherein man might prepare his spirit for
Eternity. By contrast with that definite, peaceful purpose, this
world of blindly striving, struggling, ever-restless men, who
addressed themselves to their span of mortal existence as if it
were to endure for ever, was no better, no more purposeful and of
no more merit in its ultimate achievement than a clot of writhing
earthworms.</p>
<p>Thus Messer Bellarion, riding by sparkling waters in the dappled
shade of poplars standing stark against the polished azure of the
summer sky, and the very beauty with which God had dressed the
world made man's defilement of it the more execrable in his
eyes.</p>
<p>Emerging from the screen of trees, he emerged also from his
gloomy reflections, dragged thence by the sight of a lady on a
white horse that was gaily caparisoned in blue and silver. She was
accompanied by a falconer and attended by two grooms whose liveries
in the same colours announced them of the household of Messer
Facino Cane, Count of Biandrate, and now by right of conquest and
self-election Tyrant of Alessandria. For in accepting his tacit
dismissal from the Duke of Milan, Facino had thrown off his
allegiance to all Visconti and played now, at last, for his own
strong hand.</p>
<p>Bellarion would have turned another way. For such had become his
habit whenever he espied the countess. But the lady hailed him,
consigning the hooded falcon on her wrist into the keeping of her
falconer, who, with the grooms, fell back to a respectful distance
as Bellarion, reluctantly obedient, approached.</p>
<p>"If you're for home, Bellarion, we'll ride together."</p>
<p>Uncomfortable, he murmured a gratified assent that sounded as
false as he intended that it should.</p>
<p>She looked at him sideways as they moved on together. She spoke
of hawking. Here was fine country open for the sport. A flight
could be followed for miles in any direction, moving almost as
directly along the ground as the birds moved in the air above. Yet
sport that day had been provokingly sluggish, and quarries had been
sought in vain. It would be the heat, she opined, which kept the
birds under cover.</p>
<p>In silence he jogged beside her, letting her prate, until at
last she, too, fell silent. Then, after a spell, with a furtive
sidelong glance from under her long lashes, she asked him a
question in a small voice.</p>
<p>"You are angry with me, Bellarion?"</p>
<p>He was startled, but recovered instantly. "That were a
presumption, Madonna."</p>
<p>"In you it might be a condescension. You are so aloof these
days. You have avoided me as persistently as I have sought
you."</p>
<p>"Could I suppose you sought me?"</p>
<p>"You might have seen."</p>
<p>"If I had not deemed it wiser not to look."</p>
<p>She sighed a little. "You make it plain that it is not in you to
forgive."</p>
<p>"That does not describe me. I bear no malice to any living man
or woman."</p>
<p>"But what perfection! I wonder you could bear to stray from
heaven!" It was no more than an impulsive display of her claws.
Instantly she withdrew them. "No, no. Dear God, I do not mean to
mock at you. But you're so cold, so placid! That is how you come to
be the great soldier men are calling you. But it will not make men
love you, Bellarion."</p>
<p>Bellarion smiled. "I don't remember to have sought men's
love."</p>
<p>"Nor women's, eh?"</p>
<p>"The fathers taught me to avoid it."</p>
<p>"The fathers! The fathers!" Her mockery was afoot again. "In
God's name, why ever did you leave the fathers?"</p>
<p>"It was what I was asking myself when I came upon you."</p>
<p>"And you found no answer when you saw me?"</p>
<p>"None, Madonna."</p>
<p>Her face whitened a little, and her breath came shorter.</p>
<p>"You're blunt," she said, and uttered a little laugh that was
hard and unpleasant.</p>
<p>He explained himself. "You are my Lord Facino's wife."</p>
<p>"Ah!" Her expression changed again. "I knew we should have that.
But If I were not? If I were not?" She faced him boldly, in a
sudden eagerness that he deemed piteous.</p>
<p>The solemnity of his countenance increased. He looked straight
before him. "In all this idle world there is naught so idle as to
consider what we might be if it were different."</p>
<p>She had no answer for a while, and they rode a little way side
by side in silence, her attendants following out of earshot.</p>
<p>"You'll forgive, I think, when I explain," said she at last.</p>
<p>"Explain?" he asked her, mystified.</p>
<p>"That night in Milan...the last time we spoke together. You
thought I used you cruelly."</p>
<p>"No more cruelly than I deserve to be used in a world where it
is expected of a man that he shall be more sensible to beauty than
to honour."</p>
<p>"I knew it was honour made you harsh," she said, and reached
forth a hand, to touch his own where it lay upon the pommel. "I
understood. I understand you better than you think, Bellarion.
Could I have been angry with you, then?"</p>
<p>"You seemed angry."</p>
<p>"Seemed. That is the word. It was necessary to seem. You did not
know that Facino was behind the arras that masked the little
door."</p>
<p>"I hoped that you did not."</p>
<p>It was like a blow between the eyes. She snatched away her hand.
Brows met over staring, glaring eyes, and her nether lip was caught
in sharp white teeth.</p>
<p>"You knew!" she gasped at last, and her voice held all the
emotions.</p>
<p>"The arras quivered, and there was no air. That drew my eyes,
and I saw the point of my lord's shoe protruding from the curtain's
hem."</p>
<p>Her face held more wickedness in that moment than he would have
thought possible to find wed with so much perfection.</p>
<p>"When...when did you see? Was it before you spoke to me as you
did?"</p>
<p>"Your thoughts do me poor credit. If I had seen in time, should
I have been quite so plain and uncompromising in my words? I did
not see until after I had spoken."</p>
<p>The explanation nothing mollified her. "Almost I hoped you'd say
that the words you used you used because you knew of Facino's
presence."</p>
<p>After that, he thought, no tortuous vagaries of the human mind
should ever again astonish him.</p>
<p>"You hoped I would confess myself a bloodless coward who uses a
woman as a buckler against a husband's righteous wrath!"</p>
<p>As she made no answer, he continued: "Each of us has been
defrauded in his hopes. Mine were that you did not suspect Facino's
presence and that you spoke from a heart at last aroused to
loyalty."</p>
<p>It took her a moment fully to understand him. Then her face
flamed scarlet, and unshed tears of humiliation and anger blurred
her vision. Butcher voice, though it quivered a little, was
derisive.</p>
<p>"You spare me nothing," she said. "You strip me naked in your
brutal scorn and then fling mud upon me. I have been your friend,
Bellarion&mdash;aye, and more. But that is over now."</p>
<p>"Madonna, if I have offended&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Let be." She became imperious. "Listen now. You must not
continue with my Lord Facino, because where he goes thither must I
go too."</p>
<p>"You ask me to take my dismissal from his service?" He was
incredulous.</p>
<p>"I beg it...a favour, Bellarion. It is yourself have brought
things to the pass where I may not meet you without humiliation.
And continue daily to meet you I will not." Her ready wicked temper
flared up.</p>
<p>"You'll go, or else I swear&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Swear nothing," he thundered, very suddenly aroused. "Threaten,
and you bind me to Facino hand and foot."</p>
<p>Instantly she was all soft and pleading. A fool she was.
Nevertheless&mdash;indeed, perhaps because of it&mdash;she had a ready grasp
of the weapons of her sex.</p>
<p>"Oh, Bellarion, I do not threaten. I implore...I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Silence were your best agent now." He was curt. "I know your
wishes, and..." He broke off with a rough wave of his hand. "Where
should I go?" he asked; but the question was addressed to Fate and
not to her. She answered it, however.</p>
<p>"Do you ask that, Bellarion? Why, in this past month since
Alessandria fell your fame has gone out over the face of Italy. The
credit for two such great victories as those of Travo and
Alessandria is all your own, and the means by which you won them
are on every man's tongue."</p>
<p>"Aye! Facino is generous!" he said, and his tone was bitter.</p>
<p>"There's not a prince in Italy would not be glad to employ
you."</p>
<p>"In fact, the world is full of places for those we would
dismiss."</p>
<p>After that they rode in silence until they were under the walls
of the city.</p>
<p>"You'll go, Bellarion?"</p>
<p>"I am considering." He was very grave, swayed between anger and
a curious pity, and weighing other things besides.</p>
<p>In the courtyard of the citadel he held her stirrup for her. As
she came to earth and turned, standing very close to him, she put
her little hand on his.</p>
<p>"You'll go, Bellarion, I know. For you are generous. This, then,
is farewell. Be you fortunate!"</p>
<p>He bowed until his lips touched her hand in formal homage. As he
came upright again he saw the square-shouldered figure of Facino in
the Gothic doorway, and Facino's watching eyes, he thought, were
narrow. That little thing was the last item in the scales of his
decision.</p>
<p>Facino came to greet them. His manner was pleasant and hearty.
He desired to know how the hawking had gone, how many pheasants his
lady brought him back for supper, how far afield she had ridden,
where Bellarion had joined her and other similar facts of amiable
commonplace inquiry. But Bellarion, watching him, perceived that
his excessively ready smile never reached his eyes.</p>
<p>Throughout supper, which he took as usual in the company of his
captains and his lady, Facino was silent and brooding, nor even
showed great interest when Carmagnola told of the arrival of a
large body of Ghibelline refugees from Milan to swell the forces
which Facino was assembling against the coming struggle, whether
defensive or offensive, with Malatesta and Duke Gian Maria.</p>
<p>Soon after the countess had withdrawn, Facino gave his captains
leave; Bellarion, however, still kept his place. His resolve was
taken. That which the countess claimed of him as a sacrifice to her
lacerated vanity he found his sense of duty to Facino claiming also
and his prudent, calculating wits confirming.</p>
<p>Facino raised heavy eyes from the contemplation of the board and
leaned back in his chair. He looked old that night in the
flickering candle-light. His first words betrayed the subject upon
which his thoughts had been lingering.</p>
<p>"Ha, boy! I am glad to see the good relations between Bice and
yourself. I had fancied a coolness between you lately."</p>
<p>"I am the countess's servant, as I am yours, my lord."</p>
<p>"Aye, aye," Facino grunted, and poured himself wine from a jug
of beaten gold. "She likes your company. She grudged you once when
I sent you on a mission to Genoa. I'm brought to think of it
because I am about to repeat the offence."</p>
<p>"You wish me to go to Boucicault for men?" Bellarion showed his
surprise.</p>
<p>Facino looked at him quizzically. "Why not? Do you think he will
not come?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he'll come. He'll march on Milan with you to smash
Malatesta, and afterwards he'll try to smash you in your turn that
he may remain sole master in the name of the King of France."</p>
<p>"You include politics in your studies?"</p>
<p>"I use my wits."</p>
<p>"To some purpose, boy. To some purpose. But I never mentioned
Boucicault, nor thought of him. The men I need must be procured
elsewhere. Where would you think of seeking them?"</p>
<p>And then Bellarion understood. Facino wanted him away, and
desired him to understand it, which was why he had dragged in that
allusion to the countess. Facino was made reticent by his deep love
for his unworthy lady; his need for her remained fiercely strong,
however she might be disposed to stray.</p>
<p>Bellarion used his wits, you see, as he had lately boasted.</p>
<p>Why had Facino spied that night in Milan? Surely because in the
relations between Bellarion and the countess he had already
perceived reason for uneasiness. That uneasiness his spying had
temporarily allayed. Yet not so completely but that he continued
watchful, and now, at the first sign of a renewal of that
association, it took alarm. Though Facino might still be sure that
he had nothing to avenge, he could be far from sure that he had
nothing to avert.</p>
<p>A great sorrow welled up from Bellarion's heart. All that he now
was, all that he possessed&mdash;his very life itself&mdash;he owed to
Facino's boundless generosity. And in return he was become a thorn
in Facino's flesh.</p>
<p>"Why, sir," he said slowly, smiling a little as if in
deprecation, "this matter of levies has been lately in my thoughts.
To be frank, I have been thinking of raising a condotta of my
own."</p>
<p>Facino sat bolt upright in his surprise. Clearly his first
emotion was of displeasure.</p>
<p>"Oho! You grow proud?"</p>
<p>"I have my ambitions."</p>
<p>"How long have you nursed this one? It's the first I hear of
it."</p>
<p>Blandly Bellarion looked across at him, and bland was his
tone.</p>
<p>"I matured the conceit as I rode abroad today."</p>
<p>"As you rode abroad?"</p>
<p>Facino's eyes were intently upon his face. It conserved its
blandness. The condottiero's glance flickered and fell away. They
understood each other.</p>
<p>"I wish you the luck that you deserve, Bellarion. You've done
well by me. You've done very well. None knows it better than I. And
it's right you should go, since you've the sense to see that it's
best for...you."</p>
<p>The colour had faded from Bellarion's face, his eyes were very
bright. He swallowed before he could trust himself to speak, to
play the comedy out.</p>
<p>"You take it very well, sir&mdash;this desertion of you. But I'm your
man for all my ambition."</p>
<p>Thereafter they discussed his future. He was for the Cantons, he
announced, to raise a body of Swiss, the finest infantry in the
world; and Bellarion meant to depend on infantry. As a parting
favour he begged for the loan of Stoffel, who would be useful to
him as a sponsor to his compatriots of Uri and the
Vierwaldstaetter. Facino promised him not only Stoffel himself, but
fifty men of the Swiss cavalry Stoffel had latterly recruited, to
be a nucleus of the condotta Bellarion went to raise.</p>
<p>They pledged each other in a final cup, and parted, Facino to
seek his bed, Bellarion in quest of Stoffel.</p>
<p>Stoffel having heard the proposal, at once engaged himself,
protesting that the higher pay Bellarion offered him had no part in
the decision.</p>
<p>"And as for men, there's not one of those who fought with you on
the bluff above the Trebbia but will want to come."</p>
<p>They numbered sixty when they were called up, and with Facino's
consent they all went with Bellarion on the morrow. For having
decided upon departure there was no reason to delay it.</p>
<p>Betimes in the morning Bellarion had business with a banker of
Alessandria named Torella, with whom Vignate's ransom was deposited
in return for certain bills of exchange negotiable in Berne.
Thereafter, he went to take his leave of Facino, and to lay before
him a suggestion, which was the fruit of long thinking in the
stillness of a wakeful night. He was guilty, he knew, of a
duplicity, of serving ends very different indeed from those that he
pretended. But his conscience was at ease, because, although he
might be using Facino as a tool for the performance of his ultimate
secret aims, yet the immediate aims of Facino himself would
certainly be advanced.</p>
<p>"There is a service I can perhaps do you as I go," said
Bellarion at parting. "You are levying men, my lord, which is a
heavy drain upon your own resources."</p>
<p>"Prisoners like Vignate don't fall into the hands of each of
us."</p>
<p>"Have you thought, instead, of seeking alliances?"</p>
<p>Facino was disposed to be hilarious. "With whom? With the dogs
that are baying and snarling round Milan? With Estorre and Gian
Carlo and the like?"</p>
<p>"There's Theodore of Montferrat," said Bellarion quietly.</p>
<p>"So there is, the crafty fox, and the price he'll want for his
alliance."</p>
<p>"You might find it convenient to pay it. Like myself, the
Marquis Theodore has ambitions. He covets Vercelli and the lordship
of Genoa. Vercelli would be in the day's work in a war on
Milan."</p>
<p>"So it would. We might begin hostilities by occupying it. But
Genoa, now..."</p>
<p>"Genoa can wait until your own work is done. On those terms
Montferrat comes in with you."</p>
<p>"Ha! God's life! You're omniscient."</p>
<p>"Not quite. But I know a great deal. I know, for instance, that
Theodore went to Milan at Gabriello's invitation to offer alliance
to Gian Maria on those terms. He left in dudgeon, affronted by Gian
Maria's refusal. He's as vindictive as he's ambitious. Your
proposal now might tickle both emotions."</p>
<p>This was sound sense, and Facino admitted it emphatically.</p>
<p>"Shall I go by way of Montferrat and negotiate the alliance for
you with Messer Theodore?"</p>
<p>"You'll leave me in your debt if you succeed."</p>
<p>"That is what Theodore will say when I propose it to him."</p>
<p>"You're sanguine."</p>
<p>"I'm certain. So certain that I'll impose a condition. Messer
Theodore shall send the Marquis Gian Giacomo to you to be your
esquire. You'll need an esquire in my place."</p>
<p>"And what the devil am I to do with Gian Giacomo?"</p>
<p>"Make a man of him, and hold him as a guarantee. Theodore grows
old, and accidents often happen on a campaign. If he should die
before it's convenient you'll have the sovereign of Montferrat
beside you to continue the alliance."</p>
<p>"By God! You look ahead!"</p>
<p>"In the hope of seeing something some day. I've said that the
Regent Theodore has his ambitions. Ambitious men are reluctant to
relinquish power, and in a year's time the Marquis Gian Giacomo
will be of age to succeed. Have a care of him when he's with
you."</p>
<p>Facino looked at him and blew out his cheeks. "You're
bewildering sometimes. You seem to say a hundred things at once.
And your thoughts aren't always nice."</p>
<p>Bellarion sighed. "My thoughts are coloured by the things they
dwell on."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-17" id="ch-2-17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. THE
RETURN</h2>
<p>The Knight Bellarion contrasted the manner of his departure from
Casale a year ago with the manner of his return, and took
satisfaction in it. There was more worldliness in his heart than he
suspected.</p>
<p>He rode, superbly mounted on a tall grey horse, with Stoffel at
his side, a little way ahead of the troop of sixty mounted
arbalisters, all well equipped and trim in vizorless steel caps and
metal-studded leather hacketons, their leader rearing a lance from
which fluttered a bannerol bearing Bellarion's device, on a field
azure the dog's head argent. The rear was brought up by a string of
pack-mules laden with tents and equipment of the company.</p>
<p>Clearly this tall young knight was a person of consequence, and
as a person of consequence he found himself entreated in
Casale.</p>
<p>The Regent's reception of him admirably blended the
condescension proper to his own rank with the deference due to
Bellarion's. The Regent, you'll remember, had been in Milan at the
time of Bellarion's leap to fame and honour, and that was all that
he chose now to remember of Facino Cane's adoptive son. He had
heard also&mdash;as all Italy had heard by now&mdash;of how Alessandria had
been taken, and his present deference was a reflection of true
respect for one who displayed such shining abilities of military
leadership. By no word or sign did he betray recollection of the
young man's activities in Casale a year ago. A tactful gentleman,
this Regent of Montferrat. His court, he professed, was honoured by
this visit of the illustrious son of an illustrious sire, and he
hoped that in the peace of Montferrat Messer Bellarion would rest
him awhile from his late glorious labours.</p>
<p>"You may yet count me a disturber of that peace, Lord Marquis. I
come on an embassy from my Lord of Biandrate."</p>
<p>"Its purport?"</p>
<p>"The aims wherein your highness failed in Milan might find
support in Alessandria."</p>
<p>Theodore took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Well, well," said he. "We will talk of it when you have dined..
Our first anxiety is for your comfort."</p>
<p>Bellarion understood that he had said enough. What Theodore
really needed was time in which to weigh the proposal he perceived
before they came to a discussion of it.</p>
<p>They dined below in a small room contiguous to the great hall, a
cool pleasant room whose doors stood wide to those spacious sunlit
gardens into which Bellarion had fled when the Podesta's men
pursued him. They were an intimate family party: the Princess
Valeria; the Marquis Gian Giacomo; his tutor, Corsario; and his
gentleman, the shifty-eyed young Lord of Fenestrella. The year that
was sped had brought little change to the Court of Casale; yet some
little change a shrewd eye might observe. The Marquis, now in his
seventeenth year, had aged materially. He stood some inches taller,
he was thinner and of a leaden pallor. His manner was restless, his
eyes dull, his mouth sullen. The Regent might be proceeding slowly,
but he proceeded surely. No need for the risk of violent measures
against one who was obligingly killing himself by the profligacy so
liberally supplied him.</p>
<p>The Princess, too, was slighter and paler than when last.
Bellarion had seen her. A greater wistfulness haunted her dark
eyes, a listlessness born of dejection hung about her.</p>
<p>But when Bellarion, conducted by her uncle, had stood
unexpectedly before her, straight as a lance, tall and assured, the
pallor had been swept from her face, the languor from her
expression. Her lips had tightened and her eyes had blazed upon
this liar and murderer to whose treachery she assigned the ruin of
her hopes.</p>
<p>The Regent, observing these signs, made haste to present the
visitor to the young Marquis in terms that should ensure a
preservation of the peace.</p>
<p>"Giacomo, this is the Knight Bellarion Cane. He comes to us as
the envoy of his illustrious father, the Count of Biandrate, for
whose sake, as for his own, you will do him honour."</p>
<p>The youth looked at him languidly. "Give you welcome, sir," he
said without enthusiasm, and wearily proffered his princely hand,
which Bellarion dutifully kissed.</p>
<p>The Princess made him a stiff, unsmiling inclination of her head
in acknowledgment of his low bow. Fenestrella was jocosely
familiar, Corsario absurdly dignified.</p>
<p>It was an uncomfortable meal. Fenestrella, having recognized
Bellarion for the prisoner in the Podesta's court a year ago, was
beginning to recall the incident, when the Regent headed him off
and swung the talk to the famous seizure of Alessandria, rehearsing
the details of the affair: how Bellarion, disguised as a muleteer,
had entered the besieged city and how, pretending himself next a
captain of fortune, he had proposed the camisade in which
subsequently he had trapped Vignate; and how, thereafter, with his
own men in the shirts of the camisaders, he had surprised the
city.</p>
<p>"Trick upon trick," said the Princess in a colourless voice,
speaking now for the first time.</p>
<p>"Just that," Bellarion shamelessly agreed.</p>
<p>"Surely something more," Theodore protested. "Never was
stratagem more boldly conceived or more neatly executed. A great
feat of leadership, Ser Bellarion, deserving the renown it has
procured you."</p>
<p>"And a hundred thousand florins," said Valeria.</p>
<p>So, they knew that too, reflected Bellarion.</p>
<p>Fenestrella laughed. "You set a monstrous value on the Lord
Vignate."</p>
<p>"I hoped his people of Lodi, who had to find the gold, would
afterwards ask themselves if it was worth while to retain a tyrant
quite so costly."</p>
<p>"Sir, I have done you wrong," the Princess confessed. "I judged
you swayed by the thought of enriching yourself."</p>
<p>He affected to miss the sarcasm. "Your highness would have done
me wrong if you had left that out."</p>
<p>Valeria alone did not smile at that. Her brown eyes were hard as
they held his gaze.</p>
<p>"It was Messer Carmagnola, they tell me, who led the charge into
the city. That is a gallant knight, ever to be found where knocks
are to be taken."</p>
<p>"True," said Bellarion. "It's all he's fit for. An ox of a
man."</p>
<p>"That is your view of a straightforward, honest fighter?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps I am prejudiced in favour of the weapon of
intelligence."</p>
<p>She leaned forward a little to dispute with him. All were
interested and only Theodore uneasy.</p>
<p>"It is surely necessary, even in the lists. I remember at a
tournament in Milan the valour and address of this knight
Carmagnola. He bore off the palm that day. But, then, you were not
present. You had a fever, or was it an ague?"</p>
<p>"Most likely an ague. I always shiver at the thought of a
personal encounter."</p>
<p>The Regent led the laugh, and now even Valeria smiled, but it
was a smile of purest scorn.</p>
<p>Bellarion remained solemn. "Why do you laugh, sirs? It is no
more than true."</p>
<p>"True!" cried Fenestrella. "And it was you unhorsed
Vignate!"</p>
<p>"That was an accident. I slid aside when he rode at me. He
overshot his aim and I took advantage of the moment."</p>
<p>Valeria's eyes was still upon him, almost incredulous in their
glance. Oh, he was utterly without shame. He retorted upon her with
the truth; but it was by making truth sound like a mockery that he
defeated her. She looked away at last, nor spoke to him again.</p>
<p>Delivered from her attacks, Bellarion addressed himself to the
young Marquis, and by way of polite inquiry into his studies asked
him how he liked Virgil.</p>
<p>"Virgilio?" quoth the boy, mildly surprised. "You know Virgilio,
do you? Bah, he's a thieving rogue, but very good with dogs."</p>
<p>"I mean the poet, my lord."</p>
<p>"Poet? What poet? Poets are a weariness. Valeria reads me their
writings sometimes. God knows why, for there's no sense in
them."</p>
<p>"If you read them to yourself, you might&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Read them to myself? Read? God's bones, sir! You take me for a
clerk! Read!" He laughed the notion contemptuously away and buried
his face in his cup.</p>
<p>"His highness is a backward scholar," Corsario deprecated. "We
do not thrust learning upon him," Theodore explained. "He is not
very strong."</p>
<p>Valeria's lip quivered. Bellarion perceived that it was with
difficulty she kept silent.</p>
<p>"Why, you know best, sir," he lightly said, and changed his
subject.</p>
<p>Thereafter the talk was all of trivial things until the meal was
done. After the Princess had withdrawn and the young Marquis and
Fenestrella had begged leave to go, the Regent dismissed Messer
Corsario and the servants, but retained his guest to the last.</p>
<p>"I will not keep you now, sir. You'll need to rest. But before
we separate you may think it well to tell me briefly what my Lord
Facino proposes. Thus I may consider it until we come to talk of it
more fully this evening."</p>
<p>Bellarion, who knew, perhaps, as few men knew, the depth of
Theodore's craft, foresaw a very pretty duel in which he would have
need of all his wits.</p>
<p>"Briefly, then," said he, "your highness desires the recovery of
Vercelli and similarly the restoration of the Lordship of Genoa.
Alone you are not in strength to gratify your aims. My Lord Facino,
on the other hand, is avowedly in arms against the Duke of Milan.
He is in sufficient strength to stand successfully on the
defensive. But his desire is to take the offensive, drive out
Malatesta and bring the Duke to terms, An alliance with your
highness would enable each of you to achieve his ends."</p>
<p>The Regent took a turn in the room before he spoke.</p>
<p>He came at last, to stand before Bellarion, his back to the
Gothic doorway and the sunlight beyond, graceful and tall and so
athletically spare that a boy of twenty might have envied him his
figure. He looked at Bellarion with those pale close-set eyes which
to the discerning belied the studiedly benign expression of his
handsome shaven face.</p>
<p>"What guarantees does the Lord of Biandrate offer?" he asked
quietly.</p>
<p>"Guarantees?" echoed Bellarion, and nothing in his blank face
betrayed how his heart had leapt at the Regent's utterance of that
word. "Guarantees that when I shall have done my part he will do
his."</p>
<p>Calm, passionless and indifferent he might show himself. But if
underneath that well-managed mask he did not see the eagerness,
spurred on by ambition and vindictiveness, then Bellarion knew
nothing. If he paused to ask for guarantees it was because he so
ardently desired the thing Facino offered that he would take no
risk of being cheated.</p>
<p>Bellarion smiled ingenuously. "My Lord Facino proposes to open
the campaign by placing you in possession of Vercelli. That is
better than a guarantee. It is payment in advance."</p>
<p>A momentary gleam in the pale eyes was instantly suppressed.
"Part payment," said the Regent's emotionless voice. "And
then?"</p>
<p>"Of necessity, to consolidate your possession, the next movement
must be against Milan itself."</p>
<p>Slowly the Regent inclined his head.</p>
<p>"I will consider," he said gravely. "I will summon the Council
to deliberate with me, and we will weigh the means at our command.
Meanwhile, whatever my ultimate decision, I am honoured by the
proposal."</p>
<p>Thus calm, correct, displaying no eagerness, leaving it almost
in doubt whether the consideration was due to inclination or merely
to deference for Facino, the Regent quitted the matter. "You will
need rest, sir." He summoned his chamberlain, to whom he entrusted
his guest, assured the latter that all within the Palace and City
of Casale were at his orders, and ceremoniously took his leave.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-2-18" id="ch-2-18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII. THE
HOSTAGE</h2>
<p>The golden light of eventide lay on the terrace palace gardens,
on the white temple mirrored in the placid lake, on granite
balustrades where roses trailed, on tall trim boxwood hedges that
were centuries old and on smooth emerald lawns where peacocks
sauntered.</p>
<p>Thither the Princess Valeria, trimly sheathed in russet and her
ladies Isotta and Dionara, in formally stiff brocades had come to
take the air, and thither came sauntering also the Knight Bellarion
and the pedant Corsario.</p>
<p>The knight was discoursing Lucretius to the pedant, and the
pedant did not trouble to conceal his boredom. He had no great love
of letters, but displayed a considerable knowledge of Apuleius and
Petronius, and smirkingly quoted lewdnesses now from <i>The Golden
Ass</i>, now from <i>Trimalchio's Supper</i>.</p>
<p>Bellarion forsook Lucretius and became a sympathetic listener,
displaying a flattering wonder at Messer Corsario's learning. Out
of the corner of his eye he watched the upper terrace where the
Princess lingered.</p>
<p>Presently he ventured a contradiction. Messer Corsario was at
fault, he swore. The line he quoted was not from Petronius, but
from Horace. Corsario insisted; the dispute grew heated.</p>
<p>"But the lines are verses," said Bellarion, "and <i>Trimalchio's
Supper</i> is in prose."</p>
<p>"True. But verses occur in it." Corsario kept his patience with
difficulty in the face of such irritating, mistaken assurance.</p>
<p>When Bellarion laughed his assertion to scorn, he went off in a
pet to fetch the book, so that he might finally silence and shame
this ignorant disputant. Bellarion took his way to the terrace
above, where the Princess Valeria sauntered.</p>
<p>She observed his approach with stern eyes; and when he bowed
before her she addressed him in terms that made of the difference
in their ranks a gulf between them.</p>
<p>"I do not think, sir, that I sent for you."</p>
<p>He preserved an unruffled calm, but his answering assertion
sounded foolish in his own ears.</p>
<p>"Madonna, I would give much to persuade you that I am your
servant."</p>
<p>"Your methods do not change, sir. But why should they? Are they
not the methods that have brought you fame?"</p>
<p>"Will you give your ladies leave a moment while I speak two
words with you? Messer Corsario will not be absent long. I have
sent him off on, a fool's errand, and it may be difficult to make
another opportunity."</p>
<p>For a long moment she hesitated. Then, swayed perhaps by her
very mistrust of him, she waved her ladies back with her fan.</p>
<p>"Not in that direction, highness," he said quickly, "but in
that. So they will be in line with us, and anyone looking from the
Palace will not perceive the distance separating us, and imagine us
together."</p>
<p>She smiled a little disdainful amusement. But she gave the
order.</p>
<p>"How well equipped you are!" she said.</p>
<p>"I came into the world, Madonna, with nothing but my wits. I
must do what I can with them." Abruptly, for there was no time to
lose, he plunged into the business. "I desire to give you a word of
warning in season, lest with your great talent for misunderstanding
you should be made uneasy by what I hope to do. If I succeed in
that which brings me, your brother will be sent hence tomorrow or
the next day to my Lord Facino's care at Alessandria."</p>
<p>That turned her white. "Oh, God! What now? What villainy is
meant?"</p>
<p>"To remove him from the Regent's reach, to place him somewhere
where he will be safe until the time comes for his own succession.
To this end am I labouring."</p>
<p>"You are labouring! You? It is a trap! A trap to...to..." She
was starkly terrified.</p>
<p>"If it were that, why should I tell you? Your foreknowledge will
no more assist than it can hinder. I do this, in your service. I am
here to propose an alliance between my Lord Facino and Montferrat.
This alliance was suggested by me for two purposes: to serve
Facino's immediate needs, and to ensure the Regent's ultimate ruin.
It may be delayed; but it will come, just as surely as death comes
to each of us. To make your brother safe while we wait, I shall
impose it as a condition of the alliance that the Marquis Gian
Giacomo goes to Facino as a hostage."</p>
<p>"Ah! Now I begin to understand."</p>
<p>"By which you mean that you begin to misunderstand. I have
persuaded Facino that the Marquis will serve as a hostage for the
Regent's good behaviour, and the Regent shall be made to believe
that this is our sole purpose. But the real aim is as I have told
you: to make your brother safe. By Facino he will be trained in all
those things which it imports that a prince should learn; he will
be made to forsake the habits and pursuits by which he is now being
disgraced and ruined. Lady, for your peace of mind believe me!" He
was emphatic, earnest, solemn.</p>
<p>"Believe you?" she cried out in mental torture. "I have cause to
do that, have I not? My past dealings with you; indeed, all that is
known of you bear witness to your truth and candour. By falsehood,
trickery and treachery you have raised yourself to where you stand
today. And you ask me to believe you...Why...why should you do
this? Why? That is the only test. What profit do you hope to
make?"</p>
<p>He looked at her with pain and misery in his dark eyes.</p>
<p>"If in this thing there were any design to hurt your brother, I
ask you again, Madonna, why should I stand here to tell you what I
am about to attempt?"</p>
<p>"Why do you tell me at all?"</p>
<p>"To relieve you from anxiety if I succeed in removing him. To
let you know if I should fail of the attempt of the earnest desire
to serve you, although you make it very hard."</p>
<p>Messer Corsario was hurrying towards them, a volume in his
hands.</p>
<p>She stood there, silent, stricken, not knowing what to believe,
desiring hungrily to trust Bellarion, yet restrained by every known
action in his past.</p>
<p>"If I live, Madonna," he said quietly, lowering his voice to a
murmur, "you shall yet ask me to forgive your cruel unbelief."</p>
<p>Then he turned to meet Corsario's chuckling triumph and to
submit that the pedant should convict him of error.</p>
<p>"Not so great a scholar as he believed himself, this Messer
Bellarion," Corsario informed the Princess. And then to Bellarion
himself: "You'll dispute with soldiers, sir, in future, who lack
the learning and the means to put you right. Here are the lines;
here in <i>Trimalchio's Supper</i>, as I said. See for
yourself."</p>
<p>Bellarion saw. He simulated confusion. "My apologies, Messer
Corsario, for having given you the trouble to fetch the book. You
win the trick."</p>
<p>It was an inauspicious word. To Valeria it was clear that the
trick had lain in temporarily removing Messer Corsario's
inconvenient presence, and that trick Bellarion had won.</p>
<p>She moved away now with her ladies, who had drawn close upon
Corsario's approach, and Bellarion was left to endure the pedant's
ineffable company until supper-time.</p>
<p>Later that night Theodore carried him off to his own closet to
discuss in private and in greater detail the terms of the proposed
alliance.</p>
<p>His highness had considered and had taken his resolve, now that
he was prepared to enter into a treaty. He looked for a clear
expression of satisfaction. But Bellarion disappointed him.</p>
<p>"Your highness speaks, of course, with the full concurrence of
your Council?"</p>
<p>"My Council?" The Regent frowned over the question.</p>
<p>"Where the issues are so grave, my Lord Facino will require to
be sure that all the terms of the treaty are approved by your
Council, so that there may be no going back."</p>
<p>"In that case, sir," he was answered a little frostily, "you had
better attend in person before the Council tomorrow and satisfy
yourself."</p>
<p>That was precisely what Bellarion desired, and having won the
point, whose importance the shrewd Theodore was far from
suspecting, Bellarion had no more to say on the subject that
evening.</p>
<p>In the morning he attended before the Council of Five, the
Reggimento, as it was called, of Montferrat. At the head of the
council-table the Marquis Theodore was enthroned in a chair of
State flanked by a secretary on either hand. Below these sat the
councillors, three on one side and two on the other, all of them
important nobles of Montferrat, and one of them, a white-bearded
man of venerable aspect, the head of that great house of Carreto,
which once had disputed with the Palaeologi the sovereignty of the
State.</p>
<p>When the purpose for which Bellarion came had been formally
stated, there was a brief announcement of the resources at
Montferrat's disposal and a demand that the occupation of Vercelli
should be the first step of the alliance.</p>
<p>When at last Bellarion was categorically informed that
Montferrat was prepared to throw her resources into an alliance
which they thanked the Court of Biandrate for proposing, Bellarion
rose to felicitate the members of the Council upon their decision
in terms calculated to fan their smouldering ardour into a roaring
blaze. The restoration to Montferrat of Vercelli, the subsequent
conquest of Genoa, were not indeed to be the end in view, but
merely a beginning. The two provinces of high and low Montferrat,
into which the state at present was divided, should be united by
the conquest of the territory now lying between. Thus fortified,
there would be nothing to prevent Montferrat from pushing her
frontiers northwards to the Alps and southwards to the sea. Then,
indeed, might she at last resuscitate and realize her old
ambitions. Established not merely as the equal but as the superior
of neighbouring Savoy, with Milan crumbling into ruins on her
eastward frontiers, it was for Montferrat to assume the lordship of
Northern Italy.</p>
<p>It went to their heads, and when Bellarion resumed his seat it
was they who now pressed the alliance. No longer asking him what
means Facino brought to it, they boasted and exaggerated the
importance of those which they could offer.</p>
<p>Thus the treaty came there and then to be drawn up, article by
article. The secretaries' pens spluttered and scratched over their
parchments, and throughout it seemed to the Regent and his gleeful
councillors that they were getting the better of the bargain.</p>
<p>But at the end, when all was done, and the documents complete,
Messer Bellarion had a word to say which was as cold water on the
white-heat to which he had wrought their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"There remains only the question of a guarantee from you to my
Lord Facino."</p>
<p>"Guarantee!" They echoed the word in a tone which clearly said
they did not relish it. The Regent went further.</p>
<p>"Guarantee of what, sir?"</p>
<p>"That Montferrat will fulfil her part of the undertaking."</p>
<p>"My God, sir! Do you imply a doubt of our honour?"</p>
<p>"It is no question of honour, highness, but of a bargain whose
terms are clearly to be set forth to avoid subsequent disputes on
either side. Does the word 'guarantee' offend your highness? Surely
not. For it was your highness who first used that word between
us."</p>
<p>The councillors looked at the Regent. The Regent remembered, and
was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Yesterday your highness asked me what guarantees my Lord Facino
would give that he would fulfil his part. I did not cry out in
wounded honour, but at once conceded that the immediate occupation
of Vercelli should be your guarantee. Why, then, sirs, should it
give rise to heat in you if on my lord's behalf I ask a return in
kind, something tangible to back the assurance that when Vercelli
is occupied you will march with my Lord Facino against Milan as he
may deem best?"</p>
<p>"But unless we do that," said the Regent impatiently, "there can
follow no conquest of Genoa for us."</p>
<p>"If there did not, you would still be in possession of Vercelli,
and that is a great deal. Counsels of supineness might desire you
to rest content with that."</p>
<p>"Should we heed them, do you suppose?" said the Marquis of
Carreto.</p>
<p>"I do not. Nor will my lord. But suppositions cannot be enough
for him."</p>
<p>This interruption, where all had flowed so smoothly, was clearly
fretting them. Another interposed: "Would it not be well, highness,
to hear what guarantees my Lord of Biandrate will require?"</p>
<p>And Theodore assenting, Bellarion spoke to anxious ears.</p>
<p>"It is in the nature of a hostage, and one that will cover
various eventualities. If, for instance, the Marquis Gian Giacomo
should come to the throne before these enterprises are concluded,
it is conceivable that he might decline to be bound by your
undertakings. If there were no other reasons&mdash;and they will be
plain enough to your excellencies&mdash;that one alone would justify my
lord in asking, as he does, that the person of the Marquis of
Montferrat be delivered into his care as a hostage for the
fulfilment of this treaty."</p>
<p>Theodore, betrayed into a violent start, sat now pale and
thoughtful, commanding his countenance by an effort. Another in his
place would have raged and stormed and said upon impulse things
from which he might not afterwards retreat. But Theodore Palaeologo
was no creature of impulse. He weighed and weighed again this
thing, and allowed his councillors to babble, listening the
while.</p>
<p>They were hostile, of course, to the proposal. It had no
precedent, they said. Whereupon Bellarion smothered them in
precedents culled from the history of the last thousand years.
Retreating from that assertion, then, they became defiant, and
assured him that, precedent or no precedent, they would never lend
themselves to any such course.</p>
<p>The Regent still said nothing, and whilst vaguely suspicious he
wondered whether the emphatic refusal of the councillors was based
upon some suspicion of himself. Had they, by any chance, despite
his caution, been harbouring mistrust of his relations with his
nephew, and did they think that this proposal of Facino's was some
part of his own scheming, covering some design nefarious to the
boy?</p>
<p>One of them turned to him now. "Your highness says no word to
this?" And the others with one voice demanded his own
pronouncement. He stirred. His face was grave.</p>
<p>"I am as stricken as you are. My opinion, sirs, you have already
expressed for me."</p>
<p>Bellarion, smiling a little, as one who is entirely mystified,
now answered them.</p>
<p>"Sirs, suffer me to say that your heat fills me with wonder. My
Lord Facino had expected of you that the proposal would be
welcome."</p>
<p>"Welcome?" cried Carreto.</p>
<p>"To view life in a foreign court and camp is acknowledged to be
of all steps the most important in the education of the future
prince. This is now offered to the Lord Gian Ciacomo in such a way
that two objects would simultaneously be served."</p>
<p>The simple statement, so simply uttered, gave pause to their
opposition.</p>
<p>"But if harm should befall him while in Facino's hands?" cried
one.</p>
<p>"Can you suppose, sirs, that my Lord Facino, himself, would
dread the consequences of such a disaster less than you? Can you
suppose that any measure would be neglected that could make for the
safety and well-being of the Marquis?"</p>
<p>He thought they wavered a little, reassured by his words.</p>
<p>"However, sirs, since you feel so strongly," he continued, "my
Lord Facino would be very far from wishing me to insist." One of
them drew a breath of relief. The others, if he could judge from
their countenances, moved in apprehension. The Regent remained
inscrutable. "It remains, sirs," Bellarion ended, "for you to
propose an alternative guarantee."</p>
<p>"Time will be lost in submitting it to my Lord Facino," Carreto
deplored: and the others by their nods, and one or two by words,
showed the returning eagerness to seal this treaty which meant so
much to Montferrat.</p>
<p>"Oh no," Bellarion reassured them. "I am empowered to determine.
We have no time to lose. If this treaty is not concluded by
tomorrow, my orders are to assume that no alliance is possible and
continue my journey to the Cantons to levy the troops we need."</p>
<p>They looked at one another blankly, and at last the Regent asked
a question.</p>
<p>"Did the Count of Biandrate, himself, suggest no alternative
against our refusing him this particular guarantee?"</p>
<p>"It did not occur to him that you would refuse. And, frankly,
sirs, in refusing that which himself he has suggested, it would be
courteous to supply your reasons, lest he regard it as a reflection
upon himself."</p>
<p>"The reason, sir, you have already been afforded," Theodore
answered. "We are reluctant to expose our future sovereign to the
perils of a campaign."</p>
<p>"That assumes perils which could not exist for him. But I am
perhaps presuming. I accept your reason, highness. It is idle to
debate further upon a matter which is decided."</p>
<p>"Quite idle," Theodore agreed with him. "That guarantee we
cannot give."</p>
<p>"And yet..." began the Marquis of Carreto.</p>
<p>The Regent interrupted him; for once he was without suavity.</p>
<p>"There is no 'and yet' to that," he snapped.</p>
<p>Again the councillors looked at one another. They were growing
uneasy. The immediate benefits and the future glory of Montferrat
which had been painted for them were beginning to dissolve under
their eyes like a mirage.</p>
<p>In the awkward pause that followed, Bellarion guessed their
minds.</p>
<p>He rose.</p>
<p>"In this matter of determining the guarantee you will prefer, no
doubt, to deliberate without me." He bowed in leave-taking. Then
paused.</p>
<p>"It would be a sad thing indeed if a treaty so mutually
desirable and so rich in promise to Montferrat should fail for no
good reason." He bowed again. "To command, sirs."</p>
<p>One of the secretaries came to hold the door for him, and he
passed out. An echo of the Babel that was loosed in that room on
his departure reached him before he had gone a dozen paces. He
smiled quietly as he sought his own apartments. He warmly approved
himself. It had been shrewd of him to have kept back all hint of
the hostage until he stood before the Council. If he had breathed a
suggestion of it in his preliminary talks with the Regent, he would
have been dismissed at once. Now, however, Messer Theodore was
committed to a battle in which his own conscience would fight
against him, weakening him by fear of discovery of his true
aims.</p>
<p>"The wicked flee when no man pursueth," said Bellarion to
himself. "And you'll never stand to fight this out, my wicked
one."</p>
<p>An hour and more went by before he was summoned again to hear
the decision of the Council. That decision is best given in
Bellarion's own words as contained in the letter preserved for us
in the Vatican Library which he wrote that same night to Facino
Cane, one of the very few writings of his which are known to
survive. It is couched in the pure and austere Lingua Tosca which
Dante sanctioned, and it may be Englished as follows:</p>
<p class="letter">My Dear Lord,<br>
<br>
These will reach you by the hand of Wenzel, who goes hence to
Alessandria tomorrow together with ten of my Swiss to serve as
escort for the young Prince of Montferrat. To render this escort
worthy of his rank, it is supplemented by ten Montferrine lances
sent by his highness the Marquis Theodore. Wenzel also bears the
treaty with Montferrat, into which I have entered in your name. Its
terms are as we concerted. It was not without a deal of cajolery
and strategy and only by setting the Regent at odds with his
Council that I was able to obtain as a hostage the person of the
Marquis Gian Giacomo. The Regent, had the choice been given him,
would rather, I think, have sent you his right hand. But he was
constrained by the Council, who see, and rightly, only good to the
State in this alliance with your excellent Lordship.<br>
<br>
He has insisted, however, that the boy be accompanied by his tutor
Corsario, a scoundrel who has schooled him in naught but lewdness,
and his gentleman Fenestrella, who, though young, is an even
greater preceptor in those same Stygian arts. Since it is proper
that a prince on his travels should be attended by tutor and
companion, there was no good objection that I could make to this.
But I beg of you, my dear lord, to regard these two as the agents
of the Marquis Theodore, to watch them closely, and to deal with
them drastically should you discover or suspect even that they
practise anything against the young marquis. It would be a good
service to the boy, and acceptable no doubt in the sight of God, if
you were to wring the necks of these two scoundrels out of hand.
But difficulties with the Regent of Montferrat would follow.<br>
<br>
As for the Prince himself, your lordship will find him soft in body
and empty in mind, or at least empty of all but viciousness. If,
despite your many occupations and preoccupations, your lordship
could trouble yourself to mend the lad's ways, or to entrust him to
those who will undertake the mending of them and at the same time
watch over him vigilantly, you would perform a deed for which God
could not fail to reward you.<br>
<br>
I need not remind you, my dear lord, that the safety of a hostage
is a very sacred matter, nor should I presume so to remind you but
for my reasons for believing, as your lordship already knows, that
this young Prince may be beset by perils from the very quarters
which ordinarily should be farthest from suspicion. In addition to
these twain, the Marquis is attended by a physician and two
body-servants. Of these I know nothing, wherefore they should be
observed as closely as the others.<br>
<br>
The responsibility under which you lie towards the State of
Montferrat will be your justification for placing attendants of
your own choosing to act jointly with these. The physician should
be permitted to give the boy no physic of which he does not
previously partake. In this way, and if you do not warn him of it
beforehand, you may speedily and effectively be rid of him.<br>
<br>
I am grieved that you should be troubled with this matter at such a
season. But I hope that you will not count the price too dear for
the alliance of Montferrat, which puts into the field at once close
upon six thousand well-equipped men, between horse and foot. You
will now be in sufficient strength to deal at your pleasure with
that base Duke and his Guelphic Riminese brigands.<br>
<br>
Send me your commands by Wenzel, who is to rejoin me at Lucerne. I
shall set out in the morning as soon as the Marquis Gian Giacomo
has left Casale for Alessandria. Your lordship shall have news of
me soon again.<br>
<br>
Humbly I kiss the hands of my lady your Countess; and for you, my
dear Lord, that God may bless and prosper you is the fervent prayer
of this your son and servant.<br>
<br>
Bellarion.</p>
<h2>BOOK III</h2>
<h2><a name="ch-3-01" id="ch-3-01"></a>CHAPTER I. THE LORD
BELLARION</h2>
<p>On a day of September of the year of our Lord 1409, a dust-laden
horseman clattered into the courtyard of a palace near the Bridge
of the Trinity in Florence and announced himself a courier with
letters for the noble Lord Bellarion.</p>
<p>He was consigned by a man-at-arms to an usher, by the usher to a
chamberlain, and by the chamberlain to a slim young secretary. From
this you will gather that access to the Lord Bellarion was no
longer a rough-and-ready business; and, from this again, that he
had travelled far since detaching himself from the Lord Facino Cane
a year ago.</p>
<p>At the head of the condotta which he had raised, he had fought
in the course of that year a half-score of engagements, now in this
service and now in that, and in all but one he had won easy
triumphs. Even his single failure&mdash;which was at Verruno in the pay
of the Estes of Ferrara&mdash;was such as to enhance his reputation.
Forced by overwhelming numbers to admit defeat, yet by sheer skill
he had baffled the great Pandolfo's attempt to surround him, and
had brought off his condotta with such little loss that Pandolfo's
victory was a barren one.</p>
<p>His condotta, now known as the Company of the White Dog, from
the device he had adopted, had grown to the number of twelve
hundred men, with a heavy preponderance of infantry, his handling
of which was giving the other great captains of Italy food for
thought: In fame he was the rival of Piccinino, almost the rival of
Sforza himself, under whose banner he had served in the war against
his old opponent Buonterzo. And Fra Serafino da Imola tells us
unequivocally in his chronicle that the ambush in which Buonterzo
ended his turbulent life in March of that year was of Bellarion's
planning. Since then he had continued in the service of the
Florentine Republic at a monthly stipend which had gradually been
raised with the growth of his condotta to twenty thousand gold
florins.</p>
<p>Like all famous men, he was not without detractors. He was
charged with a cold ruthlessness which brought, it was claimed, an
added horror into warfare, shocking adversaries as it had shocked
Buonterzo on the Trebbia into ordering that no quarter should be
given. So opposed, indeed, was this ruthlessness to the accepted
canons of Italian warfare, that it was said Bellarion could enlist
only Swiss mercenaries who notoriously were not queasy in these
matters. The probable truth, however, is that he employed only
Swiss because they were the best infantry in the world and,
further, so as to achieve in his following a solidarity and
cohesion not to be found in other companies made up of a medley of
nationalities.</p>
<p>Lastly, he was found lacking in those spectacular qualities of
leadership, in that personal knightly prowess by which such men as
Carmagnola took the eye. Never once had he led a charge,
stimulating his followers by his own heroic example; never had he
taken part in an escalade, or even been seen at work in a melee. At
Subriso, where he had routed the revolted Pisans, it was said that
he had never left the neighbourhood of his tent and never mounted
his horse until the engagement was all but over.</p>
<p>Hence, whilst his extraordinary strategic talents were duly
respected, it began to be put about that he was lacking in personal
courage.</p>
<p>Careless of criticism, he had pursued the course he prescribed
himself, gathering laurels as he went. On those laurels he was
momentarily resting in the City of the Lillies, when that courier
rode into the courtyard of his palace with letters from the Count
of Biandrate.</p>
<p>The Lord Bellarion&mdash;as men now called this leader grown out of
the erstwhile nameless waif&mdash;in a pleated, full-sleeved tunic of
purple satin gripped about his loins by a golden girdle and with a
massive chain of gold about his neck, stood in a window embrasure
to decipher the crabbed, untidy characters indited from Alessandria
on the feast of Saint Anthony.</p>
<p class="letter">My dear son (Facino wrote),<br>
<br>
I need you. So come to me at once with every man that you can
bring. The Duke has called in the French. Boucicault is in Milan
with six thousand men, and has been appointed ducal governor.
Unless I strike quickly before I am myself stricken, Milan will be
made a fief of France and the purblind Duke a vassal of the French
King. It is the Duke's subjects themselves who summon me. The gout,
from which I have been free for months, is troubling me again
infernally. It always seizes me just when I most need my strength.
Send me word by the bearer of these that you follow at speed.</p>
<p>Bellarion lowered the letter and gazed out across the spacious
sunlit courtyard. There was the ghost of a smile on his bronzed
face which had gained in strength and virility during the year that
was sped. He was faintly, disdainfully amused at the plight into
which Gian Maria's evil blundering must have placed him before he
could take the desperate step of calling in the French.</p>
<p>The Malatesta domination had not been long-lived. Their Guelphic
grip had been ruthlessly crushing the city, where every office,
even that of Podesta, was given into the hands of Guelphs. And that
same grip had been crushing the Duke himself, who discovered
belatedly that in throwing off the yoke of Facino for that of the
Malatesta he had exchanged King Log for King Stork. Then in his
shifty, vacillating way, he sent ambassadors to beg Facino to
return. But the ambassadors fell into the hands of the Malatesta
spies, and the Duke was constrained to shut himself up in the
fortress of Porta Giovia to evade their fury. Whereupon the
Malatesta had drawn off to Brescia, which they seized, Pandolfo
loudly boasting that he would not rest until he was Duke of Milan,
so that Gian Maria Visconti should pay the price of breaking faith
with him.</p>
<p>Terror now drove the Duke to lengths of viciousness and
inhumanity unprecedented even in his own vile career.</p>
<p>Issuing from the Castle of Porta Giovia to return to his palace,
so soon as the immediate menace was removed, he found himself beset
by crowds of his unfortunate people, distracted by the general
paralysis of industry and menaced by famine. Piteously they
clamoured about him.</p>
<p>"Peace, Lord Duke! Peace! Give us Facino for our governor, and
give us peace! Peace, Lord Duke! Peace!"</p>
<p>His fair face grimly set, his bulging eyes glaring venomously,
he had ridden ahead with his escort, closing his ears to their
cries, and more than one unfortunate was trampled under the horses'
hooves as they pressed on. But the cries continuing, that evil boy
suddenly reined in his bravely caparisoned charger.</p>
<p>"You want peace, you dogs? You'll deafen me with hell-cat cries
of peace! What peace do you give me, you filthy rabble! But you
shall have peace! Oho! You shall have it." He stood in his stirrups
and swung round to his captain. "Ho, there, you!" His face was
inflamed with fury, a wicked mockery and evil mirth hung about his
swollen purple lips. So terrible, indeed, was his aspect that della
Torre, who rode beside him, ventured to set upon his arm a
restraining hand. But the Duke flung the hand off, snarling like a
dog at his elderly mentor. He backed his horse until he was thigh
to thigh with his captain.</p>
<p>"Give them what they ask for," he commanded. "Clear me a way
through this dung-heap! Use your lances. Give them the peace they
crave."</p>
<p>A great cry arose from those who stood nearest, held there by
the great press behind.</p>
<p>"Lord Duke! Lord Duke!" they wailed.</p>
<p>And he laughed at them, laughed aloud in maniacal mockery, in
maniacal anticipation of the gratification of his unutterable
blood-lust.</p>
<p>"On! On!" he commanded. "They are impatient for peace!"</p>
<p>But the captain of his guard, a gentleman of family, Bertino
Mantegazza, sat his horse appalled, and issued no such order as he
was bidden.</p>
<p>"Lord Duke..." he began, but got no further, for the Duke,
catching the appealing note in his voice, seeing the horror in his
eyes, suddenly crashed his iron glove into the young man's face.
"God's blood! Will you stay to argue when I command?"</p>
<p>Mantegazza reeled under that cruel blow, and with blood
suffusing his broken face would have fallen but that one of his men
caught and supported him in the saddle.</p>
<p>The Duke laughed to see what he had done, and took command
himself. "Into them! Charge!" he commanded in a shout on which his
voice shrilled up and cracked. And the Bavarian mercenaries who
composed the guard, to whom the Milanese were of no account and all
civilians contemptible, lowered their lances and charged as they
were bidden.</p>
<p>Two hundred of those poor wretches found in death the peace for
which they clamoured. The others fled in panic and the Duke rode on
to the Broletto through streets which terror had emptied.</p>
<p>That night he issued an edict forbidding under pain of death the
utterance of the word "Peace" in his City of Milan. Even from the
Mass that accursed word be expunged.</p>
<p>If they had not also clamoured for Facino, it is probable that
to Facino fresh ambassadors would have been sent to invite him to
return. But the Duke would have men know that he was Duke, that he
was not to be coerced by the wishes of his subjects, and so, out of
perversity so blind that it took no account of the pit he might be
digging for himself, the Duke invited Boucicault to Milan.</p>
<p>When Boucicault made haste to answer, then the appeal to Facino
which should have gone from the Duke went, instead, from the Duke's
despairing subjects. Hence Facino's present summons to
Bellarion.</p>
<p>There was no hesitation in Bellarion's mind, and, fortunately,
no obstacle in his present employment. His agreement with the
Florentine Republic had been determined in the last few days. Its
renewal was at present under consideration.</p>
<p>He went at once to take his leave of the Signory, and four days
ahead of his army he was in Alessandria being affectionately
embraced by Facino.</p>
<p>He arrived at the very moment at which, in council with his
captains and his ally the Marquis Theodore, who had come over from
Vercelli, Facino was finally determining the course of action.</p>
<p>"I planned in the sure belief that you would come, bringing at
least a thousand men."</p>
<p>"I bring twelve hundred, all of them well-seasoned."</p>
<p>"Good lad, good lad!" Facino patted his shoulder. "Come you in
and let them hear it from you."</p>
<p>Leaning heavily upon Bellarion's arm, for the gout was troubling
him, he led his adoptive son up that winding stone staircase which
Bellarion so well remembered ascending on the morning when, as a
muleteer, he went to fool Vignate.</p>
<p>"So Master Theodore is here?" said Bellarion.</p>
<p>"And glad to come. He's been restive in Vercelli, constantly
plaguing me to place him in possession of Genoa. But I've held him
off. I do not trust Master Theodore sufficiently to do all my part
before he has done any of his. A sly fox that and an
unscrupulous!"</p>
<p>"And the young Marquis?" Bellarion inquired.</p>
<p>Facino laughed. "You will not recognize him, he has grown so
demure and staid. He thinks of entering holy orders. He'll yet come
to be a man."</p>
<p>Bellarion stared. "That he was well your letters told me. But
this...how did you accomplish it?"</p>
<p>"By driving out his tutor and the others who came with him. A
foul crew!" He paused on the stairs. "I took their measure at a
glance, and I had your hint when one night Fenestrella and the
tutor made the boy drunk and themselves drunk with him. I sent them
back to Theodore with a letter in which I invited him to deal with
them as their abuse of trust deserved. I dismissed at the same time
the physician and the body-servants, and I informed Theodore that I
would place about the Marquis in future none but persons whom I
could trust. Perforce he must write to thank me. What else could he
do? You laugh! Faith, it's laughable enough! I laughed too, which
didn't prevent me from being watchful!"</p>
<p>They resumed the ascent, and Bellarion expressed the hope that
the Lady Beatrice was well. Common courtesy demanded that he should
conquer his reluctance to name her to Facino. He was answered that
she was at Casale, Facino having removed her thither lest
Alessandria should come to be besieged.</p>
<p>Thus they came to the chamber where the council sat. It was the
same stone chamber, with its vaulted ceiling and Gothic windows
open to the sky, in which Vignate had given audience to Bellarion.
But it was no longer as bare as when the austere Tyrant of Lodi had
inhabited it. The walls were hung with arras, and rich furnishings
had been introduced by the more sybaritic Facino.</p>
<p>About the oaken table sat five men, four of whom now rose. The
one who remained seated, as if in assertion of his rank, was the
Regent of Montferrat. To the newcomer's bow he returned a short
nod.</p>
<p>"Ah! The Lord Bellarion!" His tone was languid, and Facino
fancied that he sneered. Wherefore he made haste to snap:</p>
<p>"And he brings twelve hundred men to the enterprise, my
lord."</p>
<p>"That should ensure him a welcome," the Regent admitted, but
without cordiality. He seemed, Bellarion observed, out of humour
and disgruntled, shorn of his habitual suavity.</p>
<p>The others came forward to greet Bellarion. First the
magnificent Carmagnola, taking the eye as ever by the splendour of
his raiment, the dignity of his carriage and the poise of his
handsome fair head. He was more cordial than Bellarion had yet
known him. But there was something of patronage, of tutorial
commendation in his congratulatory allusions to Bellarion's
achievements in the field.</p>
<p>"He may yet be as great a soldier as yourself, Francesco,"
Facino growled, as he sagged into the chair at the table's head to
ease his leg.</p>
<p>Missing the irony, Carmagnola bowed. "You'll make me vain, my
lord."</p>
<p>"My God!" said Facino.</p>
<p>Came the brawny, bearded, red-faced Koenigshofen, grinning
honest welcome and taking Bellarion's hand in a grip that almost
hurt. Then followed the swarthy, mercurial little Piedmontese
captain, Giasone Trotta, and lastly there was a slight, graceful,
sober, self-contained boy in whom Bellarion might have failed to
recognize the Gian Giacomo of a year ago but for the increased
likeness he bore to the Princess Valeria. So strong was that
likeness grown that Bellarion was conscious of a thrill as he met
the solemn searching gaze of those dark and rather wistful eyes.
Place at the table was found for Bellarion, and he was informed of
the situation and of the resolve which had been all but reached.
With his own twelve hundred, and with three thousand men that
Montferrat would send after leaving a sufficient force to garrison
Vercelli, Facino would put eight thousand men into the field, which
should be ample for the undertaking. They were well mounted and
well equipped, the equipment including a dozen cannon of three
hundred pounds apiece and ten bombards throwing balls of two
hundred pounds.</p>
<p>"And the plan of campaign?" Bellarion asked.</p>
<p>It was expounded to him. It was extremely simple. They were to
march on Milan and reduce it. All was in readiness, as he would
have seen for himself; for as he rode into Alessandria he had come
through the great encampment under the walls, where the army
awaited the order to march.</p>
<p>When Facino had done, Bellarion considered a moment before
speaking.</p>
<p>"There is an alternative," he said at last, "which you may not
have considered. Boucicault is grasping more than he can hold. To
occupy Milan, whose people are hostile to a French domination, he
has drawn ail his troops from Genoa, where he has made himself
detested by his excessive rigours. You are confusing the issues
here. You plan under the persuasion that Milan is the enemy,
whereas, the only real adversary is Boucicault. To cover himself at
one point, he has uncovered at another. Why aim your blow at his
heart, which is protected by his shield, when you may aim it at his
head which is unguarded by so much as a helmet?"</p>
<p>They made him no answer save with their eyes, which urged that
he, himself, should answer the question he propounded.</p>
<p>"March, then, not on Milan, but on Genoa, which he has so
foolishly left open to attack&mdash;a folly for which he may have to
answer to his master, the King of France. The Genoese themselves
will offer no resistance, and you may take possession of the city
almost without a blow."</p>
<p>Approval came warm and eagerly from the Marquis Theodore, to be
cut short by Facino.</p>
<p>"Wait! Wait!" he rasped. The notion of Theodore's ambitions
being entirely gratified before Theodore should have carried out
any of his own part of the bargain was not at all in accordance
with Facino's views. "How shall the possession of Genoa bring us to
Milan?"</p>
<p>"It will bring Boucicault to Genoa," Bellarion answered. "It
will draw him from his stronghold into the open, and his strength
will be reduced by the fact that he must leave some force behind to
keep the Milanese in subjection during his absence."</p>
<p>So strategically sound did the plan appear to Facino upon
consideration that it overcame his reluctance to place the Regent
of Montferrat at this stage in possession of Genoa.</p>
<p>That reluctance he afterwards expressed to Bellarion when they
were alone.</p>
<p>"You do it, not for Theodore, but for yourself," he was
answered. "As for Theodore..." Bellarion smiled quietly. "You need
not grudge him any advantages. They will prove very transient.
Pay-day will come for him."</p>
<p>Facino looked sharply at his adoptive son. "Why, boy," said he
at last in a voice of wonder, "what is there between you and
Theodore of Montferrat?"</p>
<p>"Only my knowledge that he's a scoundrel."</p>
<p>"If you mean to make yourself the scourge of scoundrels you'll
be busy in Italy. Why, it's sheer knight-errantry!"</p>
<p>"You may call it that," said Bellarion, and became
thoughtful.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-02" id="ch-3-02"></a>CHAPTER II. THE BATTLE OF
NOVI</h2>
<p>The rest of this affair&mdash;this campaign against the too-ambitious
vicar of the King of France&mdash;is a matter of history, which you may
read in the chronicles of Messer Coiro and elsewhere.</p>
<p>With a powerful army numbering close upon nine thousand men,
Facino descended upon Genoa, which surrendered without a blow. At
first there was alarm at the advance of so large an army. The fear
of pillage, with its attendant violence, ran through the Genoese,
who took the precaution of sending their women and their valuables
to the ships in the harbour. Then the representatives of the people
went out to meet Facino and to assure him that they would welcome
him and the deliverance from the French yoke provided that he would
not bring his troops into the city.</p>
<p>"The only purpose for which I could wish to do so," Facino
answered from the litter to which he was confined by the gout,
grown worse since he had left Alessandria, "would be to enforce the
rightful claims of the Marquis of Montferrat. But if you will take
him for your prince, my army need advance no nearer. On the
contrary, I will withdraw it towards Novi to make of it a shield
against the wrath of Marshal Boucicault when he returns."</p>
<p>And so it befell that, attended only by five hundred of his own
men, Theodore of Montferrat made his state entry into Genoa on the
morrow, hailed as a deliverer by the multitude, whilst Facino fell
back on Novi, there to lie in wait for Boucicault. Nor was his
patience tried. Upon Boucicault, confidently preparing for Facino's
attack, the news of the happenings in Genoa fell like a thunderbolt
from a clear sky.</p>
<p>Between fury and panic he quitted Milan, and by his very haste
destroyed what little chance he may have had ever of mending the
situation. By forced marches he reached the plains about Novi to
find the road held against his jaded men. And here he piled error
upon error. Being informed that Facino, himself incapacitated by
the gout, had been carried that morning into Genoa, and that his
army was commanded in his absence by his adoptive son, Bellarion,
the French commander decided to strike at once before Facino should
recover and return to direct the operations in person.</p>
<p>The ground was excellent for cavalry, and entirely of cavalry,
some four thousand strong, was Boucicault's main battle composed.
Leading it in person, he hurled it upon the enemy centre in a
charge which he thought must irresistibly cleave through. Nor did
the mass of infantry, of which Bellarion's centre was composed,
resist. It yielded ground before the furious onslaught of the
French lances. Indeed, as if swayed by panic, it began to yield
long before any contact was established, and the French, in their
rash exultation, never noticed the orderliness of that swift
retreat, never suspected the trap, until they were fast caught in
it. For whilst the centre yielded, the wings stood firm, and the
wings were entirely composed of horse, the right commanded by the
Piedmontese Trotta, the left by Carmagnola, who, sulky and
disgruntled at his suppression in a supremo command which he deemed
his right, had never wearied of denouncing this disposition of
forces as an insensate reversal of all the known rules.</p>
<p>Back and back, ever more swiftly, fell the foot. On and on
pressed the French, their lances couched, their voices already
clamantly mocking these opponents, who were being swept away like
the leaves by the mere gust of the charge.</p>
<p>Bellarion, riding in the rear of his retreating infantry with a
mounted trumpeter beside him, uttered a single word. A trumpet
blast rang out, and before its note had died the retreat was
abruptly checked. Koenigshofen's men, who formed the van of that
centre, suddenly drove the butts of their fifteen-foot German pikes
into the ground. Each man of the two front ranks went down on one
knee. A terrible hedge of spears suddenly confronted the
men-at-arms of France, riding too impetuously in their confidence.
Half a hundred horses were piked in the first impact. Then the
impetus of those behind, striking the leading ranks which sought
desperately to check, drove them forward on to those formidable
German points. The entire charging mass was instantly thrown into
confusion.</p>
<p>"That," said Bellarion grimly, "will teach Boucicault to respect
infantry in future. Sound the charge!"</p>
<p>The trumpeter wound another blast, thrice repeated, and in
answer, as Bellarion had preconcerted, the right and left wings,
which had gradually been extending, wheeled about and charged the
French on both flanks simultaneously. Only then did Boucicault
perceive whither his overconfident charge had carried him. Vainly
did he seek to rally and steady his staggering followers. They were
enveloped, smashed, ridden down before they could recover.
Boucicault, himself, fighting like a man possessed, fighting,
indeed, for very life, hacked himself a way out of that terrible
press and contrived to join the other two of the three battles into
which he had divided his army and which were pressing forward now
to the rescue. But they arrived too late. There was nothing left to
rescue. The survivors of the flower of Boucicault's army had thrown
down their arms and accepted quarter, and the reserves ran in to
meet a solid enemy front, which drove wedges into their ranks and
mercilessly battered them, until Boucicault, routed beyond
redemption, drew off with what was left.</p>
<p>"A swift action, which was a model of the harmonious
collaboration of the parts." Thus did Bellarion describe the battle
of Novi, which was to swell his ever-growing fame.</p>
<p>Boucicault, as Bellarion said, had sought to grasp more than he
could hold when he had responded to Gian Maria's invitation, and at
Novi he lost not only Milan but Genoa as well. In ignominy he took
the road to France, glad to escape with his life and some battered
remnants of his army, and Italy knew him no more after that
day.</p>
<p>In the Fregoso Palace at Genoa, overlooking the harbour, where
Theodore of Montferrat had taken up his quarters and where the
incapacitated Facino was temporarily lodged, there was a great
banquet on the following night to celebrate at once the overthrow
of the French and the accession of Theodore as Prince of Genoa. It
was attended by representatives of the twelve greatest families in
the State as well as by Facino, hobbling painfully on a crutch, and
his captains; and whilst the official hero of the hour was
Theodore, the new Prince, the real hero was Bellarion.</p>
<p>He received without emotion, without any sign either of pride or
of modesty, the tribute lavishly paid him by illustrious men and
distinguished women, by the adulatory congratulatory speech of
Theodore, or the almost malicious stress which Carmagnola laid on
his good fortune.</p>
<p>"You are well named Bellario 'Fortunato'," that splendid soldier
had said. "I am still wondering what would have happened if
Boucicault had perceived the trick in time."</p>
<p>Bellarion was coldly amiable in his reply.</p>
<p>"It will provide you with healthy mental exercise. Consider at
the same time what might have happened if Buonterzo had fathomed
our intentions at Travo, or Vignate had guessed my real purpose at
Alessandria."</p>
<p>Bellarion moved on, leaving Carmagnola to bite his lip and
digest the laughter of his brother captains.</p>
<p>His interview later with Prince Theodore was more serious. From
its outset he mistrusted the fawning suavity of the courtly Regent,
so that when at the end of compliments upon his prowess the Regent
proposed to take him and his company into the pay of Montferrat at
a stipend vastly in excess of that which Florence had lately paid
him, Bellarion was not at all surprised. Two things became
immediately clear. First, that Theodore desired greatly to increase
his strength, the only reason for which should be the shirking, now
that all his aims were accomplished, of his engagements towards
Facino. Second, that he took it for granted&mdash;as he had done
before&mdash;that Bellarion was just a venal self-seeking adventurer who
would never permit considerations of honour to stand in the way of
profit.</p>
<p>And the cupidity and calculation now revealed in Bellarion's
countenance assured Theodore that his skill in reading men had not
been at fault on this occasion.</p>
<p>"You offer me..." Bellarion broke off. Stealthily his glance
swept the glittering groups that moved about the spacious
white-and-gold room, to Facino Cane where he sat at the far end on
a great crimson chair. He lowered his voice a little. "The loggia
is empty, my lord. We shall be more private there."</p>
<p>They sauntered forth to that covered balcony overlooking the
great harbour where ranks of shipping drawn up against the mole
were slumbering under the stars. A great towering galley was moving
across the water with furled sails, her gigantic oar-blades
flashing silver in the moonlight.</p>
<p>With his glance upon that craft, his voice subdued, Bellarion
spoke, and the close-set eyes of the tall, elegant Regent strained
to pierce the shadows about the young condottiero's face.</p>
<p>"This is a very noble offer. Lord Prince..."</p>
<p>"I hope I shall never begrudge a man his worth." It was a speech
true to the character he loved to assume. "You are a great soldier.
Bellarion. That fact is now established and admitted."</p>
<p>Bellarion did not contradict him. "I do not perceive at present
your need for a great soldier, highness. True, your proposal seems
to argue plans already formed. But unless I know something of them,
unless I may judge for myself the likely extent of the service you
require, these generous terms may in effect prove an illusion."</p>
<p>Theodore resumed his momentarily suspended breath. He even
laughed a little, now that the venal reason for Bellarion's
curiosity was supplied. But he deemed it wise to probe a little
further.</p>
<p>"You are, as I understand, under no present engagement to the
Count of Biandrate?"</p>
<p>Bellarion's answer was very prompt.</p>
<p>"Under none. In discharge of past favours, I engaged to assist
him in his campaign against the Marshal Boucicault. That campaign
is now ended, and with it my engagement. I am in the market, as it
were, my lord."</p>
<p>"That is what I assumed. Else, of course, I should not have come
to you with my offer. I lose no time because soon you will be
receiving other proposals. That is inevitable. For the same reason
I name a stipend which I believe is higher than any condottiero has
ever yet commanded."</p>
<p>"But you have not named a term. That was why I desired to know
your plans, so that for myself I might judge the term."</p>
<p>"I will make the engagement to endure for three years," said
Theodore. "The proposal becomes generous, indeed."</p>
<p>"Is it acceptable?"</p>
<p>Bellarion laughed softly. "I should be greedy if it were
not."</p>
<p>"It will carry the usual condition that you engage for such
service as I may require and against any whom circumstances may
make my enemy."</p>
<p>"Naturally," said Bellarion. But he seemed to falter a little.
"Naturally," he repeated. "And yet..." He paused, and Theodore
waited, craftily refraining from any word that should curb him in
opening his mind. "And yet I should prefer that service against my
Lord Facino be excepted."</p>
<p>"You would prefer it?" said Theodore. "But do you make it a
condition?"</p>
<p>Bellarion's hesitation revealed him to the Regent for a man torn
between interest and scruples. Weakly, at last, he said: "I would
not willingly go in arms against him."</p>
<p>"Not willingly? That I can understand. But you do not answer my
question. Do you make it a condition?"</p>
<p>Still Bellarion avoided answering.</p>
<p>"Would the condition make my employment impossible?"</p>
<p>And now it was Theodore who hesitated, or seemed to hesitate.
"It would," he said at last. Very quickly he added: "Nothing is
less likely than that Facino and I should be opposed to each other.
Yet you'll understand that I could not possibly employ a
condottiero who would have the right to desert me in such a
contingency."</p>
<p>"Oh yes. I understand that. I have understood it from the first.
I am foolish, I suppose, to hesitate where the terms are so
generous." He sighed, a man whose conscience was in labour. "My
Lord Facino could hardly blame me..." He left the sentence
unfinished. And Theodore, to end the rogue's hesitation, threw more
weight into the scales.</p>
<p>"And there will be guarantees," he said.</p>
<p>"Guarantees? Ah!"</p>
<p>"The lands of Asti along the Tanaro from Revigliasco to Margaria
to be made into a fief and placed under your vicarship, with the
title of Count of Asti."</p>
<p>Bellarion caught his breath. He turned to face the Marquis, and
in the moonlight his countenance looked very white.</p>
<p>"My lord, you promise something that is not yours to
bestow."</p>
<p>"It is to make it mine that I require your service. I am frank,
you see."</p>
<p>Bellarion saw more. He saw the infernal subtlety with which this
tempter went to work. He made clear his intentions, which must
amount to no less than the conquest and occupation of all those
rich lands which lay between high and low Montferrat. To accomplish
this, Alessandria, Valenza and a score of other cities now within
the Duchy of Milan would pass under his dominion. Inevitably, then,
must there be war with Facino, who to the end of his days would be
in arms to preserve the integrity of the Duchy. And Theodore
offered this condottiero, whose services he coveted, a dazzling
reward to be gained only when those aims were fulfilled.</p>
<p>On that seducer's arm Bellarion placed a hand that shook with
excitement.</p>
<p>"You mean this, my lord? It is a solemn undertaking?"</p>
<p>With difficulty Theodore preserved his gravity. How shrewdly had
he taken the measure of this greedy rogue.</p>
<p>"Your patent shall be made out in anticipation and signed at the
same time as the contract."</p>
<p>Bellarion stared out to sea. "Count Bellarion of Asti!" he
murmured, a man dazzled, dazed. Suddenly he laughed and, laughing,
surrendered his last scruple, as Theodore was already confident
that he would. "When do we sign, Lord Prince?"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow morning, Lord Count," Theodore answered with a
tight-lipped smile, and on that, the matter satisfactorily
concluded, they quitted the loggia and parted company.</p>
<p>They met again for the signing of the documents early on the
following morning in the Regent's closet, in the presence of the
notary who had drawn up the contract at Theodore's dictation, of
two gentlemen of Montferrat, and of Werner von Stoffel, who
accompanied Bellarion, and who, as Bellarion's lieutenant, was an
interested party.</p>
<p>The notary read first the contract, which Bellarion pronounced
correct in all particulars, and then the ennobling parchment
whereby Theodore created him Count of Asti, anticipatorily
detailing the lands which he was to hold in fief. This document,
already signed and sealed, was delivered to Bellarion, together
with the contract, which he was now invited to sign. The notary
dipped a quill and proffered it. But Bellarion looked at the
Regent.</p>
<p>"Documents," he said, "are perishable, and the matter contained
in these is grave. For which reason I have brought with me a
witness, who in case of need can hereafter testify to your
undertaking, my lord."</p>
<p>The Marquis frowned. "Let Messer Stoffel examine them for
himself then."</p>
<p>"Not Messer Stoffel. The witness I prefer waits in your
antechamber, highness." He stepped quickly to the door, followed by
the Regent's surprised glance. He pulled it open, and at once
Facino was revealed to them, grave of countenance, leaning upon his
crutch.</p>
<p>The Regent made a noise in his throat as Facino hobbled in to
take the parchments which Bellarion proffered him. Thereafter there
was a spell of dreadful silence, broken at last by the Lord
Theodore, who was unable longer to control himself.</p>
<p>"You miserable trickster! You low-born, swaggering Judas! I
should have known better than to trust you! I should have known
that you'd be true to your false shifty nature. You dirty fox!"</p>
<p>"A trickster! A Judas! A fox!" Bellarion appealed mildly to the
company against the injustice of these epithets. "But why such
violence of terms? Could I in loyalty to my adoptive father put my
signature to this contract until it had received his approval?"</p>
<p>"You mock me, you vile son of a dog!"</p>
<p>Facino looked up. His face was stern, his eyes smouldered.</p>
<p>"Think of some fouler epithet, my lord, so that I may cast it at
you. So far no term that you have used will serve my need."</p>
<p>That gave Theodore pause in his reviling of another. But only
for a moment. Almost at once he was leaping furiously towards
Facino. The feral nature under his silken exterior was now
displayed. He was a man of his hands, this Regent of Montferrat,
and beggared of words to meet the present case he was prepared for
deeds. Suddenly he found Bellarion in his way, the bold mocking
eyes level with his own, and Bellarion's right hand was behind his
back, where the heavy dagger hung.</p>
<p>"Shall we be calm?" Bellarion was saying. "There are half a
dozen men of mine in the anteroom if you want violence."</p>
<p>He fell back, and, for all that his eyes still glared, he made
an obvious effort to regain his self-command. It was difficult in
the face of Facino's contemptuous laughter and the words Facino was
using.</p>
<p>"You treacherous slug! I place you in possession of Vercilli; I
made you Prince of Genoa, before calling upon you to strike a
single blow on my behalf, and you prepare to use this new-found
power against me! You'll drive me from Alessandria! You'll seduce
from me the best among my captains to turn his weapons against me
in your service. If Bellarion had been an ingrate like yourself, if
he had not been staunch and loyal whom you dare to call a Judas, I
might have known nothing of this until too late to guard myself.
But I know you now, you dastardly usurper, and by the bones of God,
your days are numbered. You'll prepare for war on Facino Cane, will
you? Prepare then, for, by the Passion, that war is coming to
you."</p>
<p>Theodore stood there white to the lips, between his two dismayed
gentlemen, and said no word in answer.</p>
<p>Facino, with curling lips, considered him.</p>
<p>"I'd never have believed it if I had not read these for myself,"
he added. Then proffered the documents to Bellarion again. "Give
him back his parchments and let us go. The sight of the creature
nauseates me." And without more he hobbled out.</p>
<p>Bellarion lingered to tear the parchments across and across. He
cast them from him, bowed ironically, and was going out with
Stoffel when the Regent found his voice at last.</p>
<p>"You kite-hearted trickster! What stipend have you wrung from
Facino as the price of this betrayal?"</p>
<p>Bellarion paused on the threshold. "No stipend, my lord," he
answered equably. "Merely a condition that so soon as the affairs
of Milan are settled he will see justice done to your nephew the
Marquis Gian Giacomo, now of age to succeed, and put a definite end
to your usurpation."</p>
<p>His sheer amazement betrayed for him the sudden question: "What
is Gian Giacomo to you, villain?"</p>
<p>"Something he is, or else I should never have been at pains to
make him safe from you by demanding him as a hostage. I have been
labouring for him for longer than you think, Highness."</p>
<p>"You have been labouring for him? You? In whose pay?"</p>
<p>Bellarion sighed. "You must be supposing me a tradesman, even
when I am really that quite senseless thing, a knight-errant." And
he went out with Stoffel.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-03" id="ch-3-03"></a>CHAPTER III. FACINO'S
RETURN</h2>
<p>A strong party of men-at-arms rode out of Genoa that morning,
their corselets flashing in the sunshine, and took the upland road
by the valley of the Scrivia towards Novi and Facino's camp. In
their midst went a mule-litter wherein Facino brooded upon the
baseness and ingratitude of man and asked himself whether perhaps
his ambitious countess were not justified of her impatience with
him because he laboured for purposes other than the aggrandisement
of himself.</p>
<p>From Novi he dispatched Carmagnola with a strong escort to
Casale to bring the Countess Beatrice thence to Alessandria without
loss of time. He had no mind to allow Theodore to hold her as a
hostage to set against Gian Giacomo who remained with Facino.</p>
<p>Three days after leaving Novi, Facino's army, reduced by
Theodore's contingent of three thousand men, which had been left
behind, but still in great strength, reached Vigevano and halted
there to encamp again outside the town. Facino's vanity was the
main reason. He would not cross the Ticino until he could sit a
horse again, so that he might ride, lance on thigh, into Milan.
Already his condition was greatly improved under the ministrations
of a Genoese physician named Mombelli, renowned for his treatment
of the podagric habit, who was now in Facino's train.</p>
<p>A week passed, and Facino, now completely restored, was
restrained from pushing on only by the arguments of his physician.
Meanwhile, however, if he did not go to Milan, many from Milan were
coming to him. Amongst the first to arrive was the firebrand
Pusterla of Venegono, who, out of his passionate vindictiveness,
came to urge Facino to hang Gian Maria and make himself Duke of
Milan, assuring him of the support of all the Ghibelline faction.
Facino heard him without emotion, and would commit himself to
nothing.</p>
<p>Amongst the last to arrive was the Duke himself, in a rash
trustfulness which revealed the desperate view he must take of his
own case and of the helplessness to which his folly and
faithlessness had reduced him. He came accompanied by his evil
genius, Antonia della Torre; the fop Lonate; the captain of his
guard, Bertino Mantegazza, and a paltry escort of a hundred
lances.</p>
<p>With those three attending him, he was received by Facino in the
house of the Ducal Prefect of Vigevano.</p>
<p>"Your highness honours me by this proof of your trust in my
integrity," said Facino, bending to kiss the jewelled ducal
hand.</p>
<p>"Integrity!" The Duke's grotesque face was white, his red
eyebrows drawn together in a scowl. "Is it integrity that brings
you in arms against me, Facino?"</p>
<p>"Not against you, Lord Duke. Never yet have I stood in arms
against your highness. It is upon your enemies that I make war. I
have no aim but the restoration of peace to your dominions."</p>
<p>"Fine words on the lips of a mutinous traitor!" sneered the
Duke. He flung himself petulantly into a chair.</p>
<p>"If your highness believed that, you would not dare to come
here."</p>
<p>"Not dare? God's bones, man! Are these words for me? I am Duke
of Milan."</p>
<p>"I study to remember it, highness," said Facino, and the
rumblings of anger in his voice drove della Torre to pluck at his
master's sleeve.</p>
<p>Thus warned, Gian Maria changed&mdash;the subject but not his tone.
"You know why I am here?"</p>
<p>"To permit me, I hope, to place myself at your potency's
commands."</p>
<p>"Ah! Bah! You make me sick with your fair words." He grew
sullen. "Come, man. What is your price?"</p>
<p>"My price, highness? What does your highness conceive I have to
sell?"</p>
<p>"A little patience with his magnificence, my lord," della Torre
begged.</p>
<p>"I thought I was displaying it," said Facino. "Otherwise it
might be very bad for everybody." He was really growing angry.</p>
<p>And now the idiot Duke must needs go prodding him into fury.</p>
<p>"What's that? Do you threaten me? Why, here's an insolent
dog!"</p>
<p>Facino turned livid with passion. A tall fellow among his
captains, very noble-looking in cloth of silver under a blue
houppelande, laughed aloud. The pale bulging eyes of Gian Maria
sought him out venomously.</p>
<p>"You laugh, knave?" he snarled, and came to his feet, outraged
by the indignity. "What is here for laughter?"</p>
<p>Bellarion laughed again as he answered: "Yourself, Lord Duke,
who in yourself are nothing. You are Duke of Milan at present by
the grace of God and the favour of Facino Cane. Yet you do not
hesitate to offend against both."</p>
<p>"Quiet, Bellarion," Facino growled. "I need no advocate."</p>
<p>"Bellarion!" the Duke echoed, glaring malevolently. "I remember
you, and remember you I shall. You shall be taught..."</p>
<p>"By God, it is your highness shall be taught!" Facino crashed
into the threatening speech, roaring like a thunder god. "Get you
hence, back to your Milan, until I come to give you the lesson that
you need, and thank God that you are your father's son and I have
grace enough to remember it, for otherwise you'd never go hence
alive! Away with you, and get yourself schooled in manners before
we meet again, or, as God's my life, I'll birch you with these
hands."</p>
<p>Terrified, cowering before that raging storm, the like of which
had never yet broken about his ducal head, Gian Maria shrank back
until his three companions were between himself and Facino. Della
Torre, almost trembling, sought to pacify the angry
condottiero.</p>
<p>"My Lord! My Lord! This is not worthy!"</p>
<p>"Not worthy! Is it worthy that I shall be called 'dog' by a
cross-grained brat to whom I've played the foster-father? Out of my
sight, sir! Out of my sight, all of you! The door, Bellarion! The
Duke of Milan to the door!"</p>
<p>They went without another word, fearing, indeed, that another
word might be their last. But they did not yet return to Milan.
They remained in Vigevano, and that evening della Torre came
seeking audience again of Facino to make the Duke's peace with him,
and Facino, having swallowed his rage by then, consented to receive
his highness once more.</p>
<p>The young man came, this time well schooled in prudence, to
announce that he was prepared to give Facino peaceful entrance into
Milan and to restore him to his office of ducal governor. In short,
that he was prepared to accord all that which he had no power to
refuse.</p>
<p>Facino's answer was brief and clear. He would accept the office
again, provided that it was bestowed upon him for a term of three
years, and the bestowal guaranteed by an oath of fealty to be sworn
upon his hands by the syndics of the Grand Council. Further, the
Castle of Porta Giovia was to be delivered into his keeping
absolutely, and not only the Guelphic Sanseverino who now held the
office of Podesta, but all other Guelphs holding offices of State
must be dismissed. Lastly, Antonio della Torre, whom Facino accused
of being at the root of most of the trouble which had distracted
Milan, must go into banishment together with Lonate.</p>
<p>This last was the condition that Gian Maria would not swallow.
He swore it was a vile attempt to deprive him of all his
friends.</p>
<p>Thus the conference ended inconclusively, and it was not until
three weeks later that the Duke finally yielded and accepted
Facino's terms in their entirety.</p>
<p>On the evening of Wednesday, the sixth of November of that year,
attended by a large company, Facino Cane, Count of Biandrate, rode
into Milan to resume his governorship, a governorship which he was
resolved to render absolute this time. They entered the city in a
downpour of rain, notwithstanding which the streets were thronged
by the people who turned out to welcome the man in whom they beheld
their saviour.</p>
<p>And in the Old Broletto, the young Duke, without a single
friendly Guelph at hand to comfort him, sat listening to that
uproar, gnawing his fingernails and shuddering with rage and
spite.</p>
<p>It becomes necessary, however, to remember, lest we should be
swept along by this stream of Viscontean history, that this present
chronicle is concerned not with the fortunes of Milan but with
those of Bellarion, and that in these Facino and Gian Maria
Visconti are concerned only to the extent of the part they bore in
moulding them.</p>
<p>In the confused pages of old Corio you may read in detail,
though you may not always clearly understand, the events that
followed upon Facino's triumphant return to Milan. You will gather
that the strength in which he was known to be gave pause to
Malatesta's plans to seize the Duchy; that in fact the arch-Guelph
chose to content himself with his usurpation of the Lordship of
Brescia and Bergamo, and in Bergamo he remained until Facino went
to seek him there some two years later. If he did not go before, it
was because other more immediate and active enemies of Milan
claimed his attention. Vignate was in arms again, as were also
Estorre Visconti and his nephew Giovanni Carlo and a host of lesser
insurgents, chief of whom was the Duke's own brother, that Filippo
Maria Visconti who was Count of Pavia. By the Ghibellines who had
fled to him from Milan during the days of Malatesta and
Boucicault's domination, Filippo Maria had been flattered into
believing that he was that party's only hope in Northern Italy. His
ambition thus aroused, he was all ready to take advantage of the
general distraction, and to appropriate for himself the ducal
chlamys. To this purpose was he arming when Facino returned to
Milan, and news of his preparations reached Facino whilst he was
suppressing the various rebellious outbreaks in the Milanese,
stamping out the embers of revolt in such places as Desio and
Gorgonzola. Only when he had restored order, established a proper
administration and so brought back tranquillity to that harassed
land, did he turn his attention to the menace of the enemies
farther afield. And the first of these was Filippo Maria. He
marched on to Pavia, carried the city by assault and put it to
sack, choosing of all nights in the year for that operation the
night of Christmas.</p>
<p>That sack of Pavia is one of the most unsparing and terrible in
the terrible history of sacks, and the deed remains a blot upon the
fame of a soldier who, although rough and occasionally even brutal
in his ways, was yet a leader of high principles and a high sense
of duty.</p>
<p>Thereafter he dealt with Filippo Maria much as he had dealt with
his ducal brother. He appointed himself governor of the young man's
dominions, filled the offices of State with men in his own
confidence, and completely stripped the Count of authority.</p>
<p>The fat flabby young prince submitted in a singularly apathetic
fashion. He was of solitary, studious habits, a recluse almost,
savagely shy, shunning the society of men because of his excessive
consciousness of his own grotesque ugliness.</p>
<p>The spark of ambition that had been struck from him having been
thus summarily quenched, he retired to his books again and let
Facino have his way with the State, nor complained so long as
Facino left him in the enjoyment of the little that was really
necessary to his eremitic ways.</p>
<p>Facino made now of Pavia his headquarters, coming to dwell in
the great castle itself, and bringing thither from Alessandria his
countess. And with the Countess of Biandrate came also the Princess
Valeria of Montferrat to rejoin at last her brother, who had
continued throughout in Facino's train. The Princess had left
Casale with the Countess when Carmagnola appeared there as Facino's
envoy with an escort. Her going had been in the nature of a flight,
whose object had been first to rejoin her cherished brother, and
second to remove herself from the power of her uncle, which, in all
the circumstances made clear by Carmagnola, seemed prudent. It is
possible that she may also have hoped by her presence near Facino
to stimulate him into the fulfilment of the threat against the
Regent on which he had parted from him in Genoa.</p>
<p>But Facino had still more immediate matters to rectify before
coming to the affair of the Lord Theodore. The Regent must wait his
turn.</p>
<p>He moved against Canturio in the following May, and made short
work of it. The campaign against Crema followed, and meanwhile
Bellarion, with a condotta increased to fifteen thousand men and
supported by Koenigshofen, had marched out of Milan to deal with
the rebellious Vignate, whom in the end he finally and definitely
defeated. That done, he returned to Milan where, ever since
Facino's descent upon Pavia, he had held the position of Facino's
deputy and had earned respect and even affection by the equable
wisdom of his rule.</p>
<p>All this in great detail you will find set forth by Corio and
Fra Serafino of Imola, and it is Fra Serafino who tells us that
Facino, determined that Bellarion should not suffer by the loyalty
which had made him refuse the County of Asti, had constrained Gian
Maria to create him Count of Gavi and the Commune of Milan to
enlist the services of his condotta for two years at a stipend of
thirty thousand ducats monthly.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-04" id="ch-3-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. THE COUNT OF
PAVIA</h2>
<p>In the vast park of Pavia the trees stood leafless and black
against the white ground of snow that covered the chilled earth.
The River Ticino gurgled and swirled about the hundred granite
pillars which carried the great roofed bridge, five hundred feet in
length, spanning its grey and turgid waters. Beyond this, Pavia the
Learned reared above white roofs her hundred snow-capped towers to
the grey December sky, and beyond the city, isolated, within the
girdle of a moat that was both wide and deep, stood the massive
square castle, pink as coral, strong as iron, at once impregnable
fortress and unrivalled palace, one of the great monuments of
Viscontean power and splendour, described by Petrarch as the
princeliest pile in Italy.</p>
<p>The pride of the place was the library, a spacious square
chamber in one of the rectangular towers that rose at each of the
four corners of the castle. The floor was of coloured mosaics,
figuring birds and beasts; the ceiling of ultramarine, star-flecked
in gold, and along the walls was ranged a collection of some nine
hundred manuscript-parchment volumes bound in velvet and damask, or
in gold and silver brocades. Their contents contained all that was
known of theology, astrology, medicine, music, geometry, rhetoric
and the other sciences. This room was the favourite haunt of the
lonely, morose and studious boy, the great Gian Galeazzo's younger
son, Filippo Maria Visconti, Count of Pavia.</p>
<p>He sat there now, by the log fire that hissed and spluttered and
flamed on the cavernous hearth diffusing warmth and a fragrance of
pine throughout the chamber. And with him at chess sat the Lord
Bellarion Cane, Count of Gavi, one of the new-found friends who had
invaded his loneliness and broken through the savage shyness which
solitude and friendlessness had set about him like a shell.</p>
<p>The others, the dark and handsome Countess of Biandrate, the
fair and now almost ethereal Princess of Montferrat and that
sturdier counterpart of herself, her brother, were in the
background by one of the two-light windows with their trefoil
arches springing from slender monials.</p>
<p>The Princess was bending low over a frame, embroidering in red
and gold and blue an altar-cloth for San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro. The
Countess was yawning over a beautifully illuminated copy of
Petrarch's "Trionfo d'Amore." The boy sat idle and listless between
them, watching his sister's white tapering fingers as they flashed
to and fro.</p>
<p>Presently he rose, sauntered across to the players, drew up a
stool, and sat down to watch the game over which they brooded
silently.</p>
<p>A crutch lay beside Bellarion, and his right leg was thrust out
stiff and unbending to explain why he sat here on this day of late
December playing chess whilst the campaign against Malatesta
continued to rage in the hills of Bergamo. He was suffering the
penalty of the pioneer. Having already demonstrated to his
contemporaries that infantry when properly organized and manoeuvred
can hold its own in the field against cavalry, he had been turning
his attention to artillery. Two months ago he had mounted a park of
guns under the walls of Bergamo with the intention of breaching
them. But at the outset of his operations a bombard had burst,
killing two of his bombardiers and breaking his thigh, thus proving
Facino's contention that artillery was a danger only to those who
employed it.</p>
<p>The physician Mobelli, who still continued in Facino's train,
had set the bone, whereafter Bellarion had been carefully packed
into a mule-litter, and by roads which torrential rains had reduced
to quagmires he had been despatched to Pavia to get himself mended.
His removal from the army was regretted by everybody with two
exceptions: Carmagnola, glad to be relieved of a brother-captain by
comparison with whose military methods his own were constantly
suffering in the general esteem, and Filippo Maria when he
discovered in Bellarion a chess-player who was not only his equal
but his master and who in other ways won the esteem of that very
friendless boy. The Princess Valeria was dismayed that this man who
out of unconquerable prejudice she continued to scorn and mistrust
should become for a season her fellow-inquiline. And it was in vain
that Gian Giacomo, who in the course of his reformation had come to
conceive a certain regard for Bellarion, had sought to combat his
sister's deep-rooted prejudice.</p>
<p>When he insisted that it was by Bellarion's contriving that he
had been removed from his uncle's control, she had been moved to
vehement scorn of his credulity.</p>
<p>"That is what the trickster would have us think. He no more than
carried out the orders of the Count of Biandrate. His whole life
bears witness to his false nature."</p>
<p>"Nay, now, Valeria, nay! You'll not deny that he is what all
Italy now proclaims him: one of the greatest captains of his
time."</p>
<p>"And how has he made himself that? Is it by knightly qualities,
by soldierly virtues? All the world knows that he prevails by guile
and trickery."</p>
<p>"You've been listening to Carmagnola," said her brother. "He
would give an eye for Bellarion's skill."</p>
<p>"You're but a boy," she reminded him with some asperity,</p>
<p>"And Carmagnola, of course, is a handsome man."</p>
<p>She crimsoned at the sly tone. On odd visits to Pavia,
Carmagnola had been very attentive to the Princess, employing all a
peacock's arts of self-display to dazzle her.</p>
<p>"He is an honest gentleman," she countered hotly. "It is better
to trust an upright honest soldier than a sly schemer whose
falsehood has been proven to us."</p>
<p>"If he schemes my ruin for my uncle's profit, he goes about it
oddly, neglecting opportunities."</p>
<p>She looked at him with compassion. "Bellarion never aims where
he looks. It is the world says that of him, not I.''</p>
<p>"And at what do you suspect that he is aiming now?"</p>
<p>Her deep eyes grew thoughtful. "What if he serves our uncle to
destroy us, only so that in the end he may destroy our uncle to his
own advantage? What if he should aim at a throne?"</p>
<p>Gian Giacomo thought the notion fantastic, the fruit of too much
ill-ordered brooding. He said so, laughing.</p>
<p>"If you had studied his methods, Giannino, you would not say
that See how he has wrought his own advancement. In four short
years this son of nobody, without so much as a name of his own, has
become the Knight Bellarion, the Lord Bellarion of the Company of
the White Dog, and now the Lord Count of Gavi, holding the rich
lands of Gavi in feud."</p>
<p>One there was who might have told her things which would have
corrected her judgment, and that was Facino's countess. For the
Lady Beatrice knew the truth of those events in Montferrat which
was at the root of the Princess Valeria's bitter prejudice, of
which also she was aware.</p>
<p>"You hate him very bitterly," the Countess told her once when
Bellarion had been the subject of their talk.</p>
<p>"Would not you, if you were in my place?"</p>
<p>And the Countess, looking at her with those long indolent eyes
of hers, an inscrutable smile on her red lips, had answered with
languorous slowness: "In your place it is possible that I
should."</p>
<p>The tone and the smile had intrigued the Princess for many a day
thereafter. But either she was too proud to ask what the Countess
had meant, or else afraid.</p>
<p>When, after some eight weeks abed, Bellarion had begun to hobble
about the castle, and it was impossible for the Princess entirely
to avoid him, she was careful never to be alone where he might so
surprise her, using him when they met in the company of others with
a distant, frigid courtesy, which is perhaps the most piercing of
all hostility.</p>
<p>If it wounded Bellarion, he gave no sign. He was&mdash;and therein
lay half the secret of his strength&mdash;a very patient man. He was
content to wait for the day when by his contriving the reckoning
should be presented to the Marquis Theodore, and she should know at
last whose servant he really was. Meanwhile, he modelled his
demeanour upon her own. He did not seek her company, nor indeed
that of any in the castle save Filippo Maria, with whom he would
spend long hours at chess or instructing him out of his own deep
learning supported by one or another of the treatises in that fine
library.</p>
<p>Until the coming of Bellarion, the Count of Pavia had believed
himself a strong chess-player. Bellarion had made him realize that
his knowledge of the game was elementary. Where against former
opponents he had swept to easy triumphs, he now groaned and puffed
and sweated over the board to lessen the ignominy of his inevitable
defeats.</p>
<p>Today, however, he was groaning less than usual. He had piled up
a well-supported attack on Bellarion's flank, and for the first
time in weeks&mdash;for these games had begun whilst Bellarion was still
abed&mdash;he saw victory ahead. With a broad smile he brought up a
bishop further to strengthen the mass of his attack. He saw his way
to give check in three and checkmate in four moves.</p>
<p>Although only in his twentieth year, he was of a hog-like bulk.
Of no more than middle height, he looked tall when seated, for all
the length of him was in his flabby, paunchy body. His limbs were
short and shapeless. His face was as round as the full moon and as
pale. A great dewlap spread beneath his chin, and his neck behind
hung in loose fat folds upon his collar, so that the back of his
head which was flat, seemed to slope inwards towards the crown. His
short black hair was smooth and sleek as a velvet cap, and a fringe
of it across his forehead descended almost to the heavy black
eyebrows, thus masking the intellectual depth of the only noble
feature of that ignoble countenance. Of his father all that he had
inherited physically was the hooked predatory nose. His mouth was
coarsely shaped, and its lines confirmed the impression of cruelty
you gathered from the dark eyes, which were small and lack-lustre
as a snake's. And the impression was a true one, for the soul of
this shy, morose young prince was not without its share of that
sadic cruelty which marked all the men of his race.</p>
<p>To meet the bishop's move, Bellarion advanced a knight. The
Prince's laugh rang through the silent room. It was a shrill,
almost womanish laugh, and it was seldom heard. High-pitched, too,
was the voice that followed.</p>
<p>"You must delay the inevitable, Bellarion," he said, and took
the knight.</p>
<p>But the move of the knight, which had appeared purely defensive
to the Prince in his intentness upon his own attack, had served to
uncover the file of Bellarion's queen. Supports had been previously
and just as cunningly provided. Bellarion advanced his hand, a long
beautiful hand upon which glowed a great carved sapphire set in
brilliants&mdash;the blue and white that were his colours. Forth flashed
his queen across the board.</p>
<p>"Checkmate, Lord Prince," said Bellarion quietly, and sank back
smiling into the brocaded chair.</p>
<p>Filippo Maria stared unbelieving at the board. The lines of his
mouth drooped, and his great pendulous cheeks trembled. Almost he
seemed on the point of tears.</p>
<p>"God rot you, Bellarion! Always, always is it the same! I plan
and build, and, whilst you seem to do no more than defend, you are
preparing a death-stroke in an unexpected quarter." Between jest
and earnest he added: "You slippery rogue! Always you defeat me by
a trick."</p>
<p>The Princess Valeria looked up from her embroidery on the word.
Bellarion caught the movement and the glance in his direction. He
knew the thought behind and it was that thought he answered.</p>
<p>"In the field, my opponents use the same word to decry me. But
those who are with me applaud my skill." He laughed. "Truth is an
elusive thing, highness, as Pontius Pilate knew. The aspect of a
fact depends upon the angle from which you view it."</p>
<p>Filippo Maria sat back, his great chin sunk to his breast, his
podgy white hand gripping the arms of his chair, his humour
sullen.</p>
<p>"I'll play no more today," he said.</p>
<p>The Countess rose and crossed the room with a rustle of stiff
brocade of black and gold.</p>
<p>"Let me remove the board," she said. "A vile, dull game. I
wonder that you can waste such hours upon it."</p>
<p>Filippo Maria raised his beady eyes. They kindled as they
observed her, raking her generous yet supple lines from head to
foot. It was not the first time that the watchful Bellarion had
seen him look so at Facino's lady; not the first time that he had
seen her wantonly display herself to provoke that unmistakable
regard. She bent now to the board, and Filippo's smouldering glance
was upon the warm ivory beauty of her neck and the swell of her
breast revealed by the low-cut gown.</p>
<p>"It is human to despise what we do not understand," Bellarion
was answering her.</p>
<p>"You would defend the game, of course, since you excel in it.
That is what you love, Bellarion: to excel, to wield mastery."</p>
<p>"Do we not all? Do not you, yourself, Madonna, glory in the
power your beauty gives you?"</p>
<p>She looked at Filippo. Her heavy eyelids drooped. "Behold him
turned courtier, my lord. He perceives beauty in me."</p>
<p>"He would be blind else," said the fat youth, greatly daring.
And the next moment in a reaction of shyness a mottled flush was
staining his unhealthy pallor.</p>
<p>Lower drooped the lady's eyelids, until a line of black lashes
lay upon her cheek.</p>
<p>"The game," Gian Giacomo interposed, "is a very proper one for
princes. Messer Bellarion told me so."</p>
<p>"He means, child," Filippo answered him, "that it teaches them a
bitter moral: that whilst a State depends upon the prince, the
prince himself is entirely dependent upon others, being capable in
his own person of little more than his meanest pawn."</p>
<p>"To teach that lesson to a despot," said Bellarion, "was the
game invented by an Eastern philosopher."</p>
<p>"And the most potent piece upon the board, as in the State, is
the queen, symbolizing woman." Thus Filippo Maria, his eyes full
upon the Countess again.</p>
<p>Bellarion laughed. "Ay! He knew his world, that ancient
Oriental!"</p>
<p>But he did not laugh as the days passed and he observed the
growing lechery in the beady eyes with which the Count of Pavia
watched the Lady Beatrice's every movement and the Lady Beatrice's
provocative complacency under that vigilance.</p>
<p>One day, at last, coming upon the Countess alone in that
library, Bellarion unmasked the batteries he had been
preparing.</p>
<p>He hobbled across to the arched window by which she was seated,
and, leaning against its monial, looked out upon the desolate park.
The snows had gone, washed away by rains, and since these had come
a frost under which the ground lay now as grey and hard as
iron.</p>
<p>"They will be feeling the rigours of the winter in the camp
under Bergamo," he said, moving, as ever, obliquely to the
attack.</p>
<p>"They will so. Facino should have gone into winter
quarters."</p>
<p>"That would mean recommencing in the spring a job that is half
done already."</p>
<p>"Yet, with his gout and the infirmities of age, it might prove
wiser in the end."</p>
<p>"Each age has its own penalties, Madonna. It is not only the
elderly among humanity who need compassion."</p>
<p>"Wisdom comes from you like sweat from another." There was a
tartness in her accents. "If I were your chronicler, Bellarion, I
should write of you as the soldier-sage, or the
philosopher-at-arms."</p>
<p>Propped on his crutch and his one sound leg, Bellarion
considered her, his head on one side, and fetched a sigh.</p>
<p>"You are very beautiful, Madonna."</p>
<p>She was startled. "God save us!" she cried. "Does the
soldier-sage contain a mere man, after all?"</p>
<p>"Your mouth, Madonna, is too sweetly formed for acids."</p>
<p>"The choicest fruits, sir, have an alloy of sharpness. What else
about me finds favour in your eyes?"</p>
<p>"In my eyes! My eyes, Madonna, are circumspect. They do not
prowl hungrily over another's pastures."</p>
<p>She looked at him between anger and apprehension, and slowly a
wave of scarlet came to stain her face and bosom, to tell him that
she understood. He lowered himself carefully to a chair, thrusting
out his damaged leg, to the knee-joint of which articulation was
only just beginning to return.</p>
<p>"I was saying, Madonna, that they will be feeling the rigours of
the winter in the camp under Bergamo. There was a hard frost last
night, and after the frost there will be rains under which the
hills thereabouts will melt in mud." He sighed again. "You would
regret, Madonna, to exchange for that the ease and comfort of
Pavia."</p>
<p>"You have the fever again. I am not thinking of making that
exchange."</p>
<p>"No. I am thinking of it for you."</p>
<p>"You! Saint Mary! And do you dispose of me?"</p>
<p>"It will be cold up there, Madonna. But you need cooling. For
coolness restores judgment. It will bring you back to a sense of
duty to your lord."</p>
<p>She came to her feet beside him, quivering with anger. Almost he
thought her intention was to strike him.</p>
<p>"Have you come here to spy upon me?"</p>
<p>"Of course. Now you know why I broke my leg."</p>
<p>She looked unutterable scorn. "The Princess Valeria is right in
her opinion of you, in her disdain of you."</p>
<p>His eyes grew sad. "If you were generous, Madonna&mdash;nay, if you
were merely honest&mdash;you would not embrace her opinions; you would
correct them. For you have the knowledge that would suffice to do
so. But you are not honest. If you were, there would be no need for
me to speak now in defence of the honour of your absent Lord."</p>
<p>"Is it for you to say I am not honest?" There was now more of
sorrow than indignation in her voice, and tears were gathering in
her eyes, to deepen their sapphire hue. "God knows I have been
honest with you, Bellarion. It is this very honesty you abuse in
your present misjudgment of me. Oh! Me miserable!" It was the cry
of a wounded soul. She sank down again into her chair. Self-pity
welled in her to drown all else. "I am to be starved of everything.
If ever woman was pitiable, I am that woman; and you, Bellarion,
you of all living men that know my heart, can find for me only
cruelty and reproach."</p>
<p>It moved him not at all. The plea was too inconsequent and
illogical, and the display of a lack of reason repelled him like a
physical defect.</p>
<p>"Your plaint, Madonna, is that Facino will not make you a
duchess. He may do so yet if you are patient." Her tears had
suddenly ceased.</p>
<p>"You know something!" she exclaimed in a hushed voice. The rogue
fooled her with that illusion, whilst refraining from using words
which might afterwards be turned against him.</p>
<p>"I know that you will lose the chance if meanwhile you should
cease to be Facino's wife. If you were so mad as to become the
leman of another, you know as well as I do that the Lord Facino
would put you from him. What should you be then? That is why I am
your friend when I think of the camp at Bergamo for you."</p>
<p>Slowly she dried her eyes. Carefully she removed all stains of
tears. It consumed a little time. Then she rose and went to him and
took his hand.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Bellarion, my friend." Her voice was hushed and
tender. "You need have no fear for me." She paused a moment.
"What...what has my lord said to you of his intent?"</p>
<p>"Nay, nay," he laughed. "I betray no confidences." The
trickster's tone was a confidence in itself. He swept on. "You bid
me have no fear for you. But that is not enough. Princes are
reckless folk. I'd not have you remain in jeopardy."</p>
<p>"Oh! But Bergamo!" she cried out. "To be encamped in
winter!"</p>
<p>"You need not go so far, nor under canvas. In your place,
Madonna, I should retire to Melagnano. The castle is at your
disposal. It is pleasanter than Pavia."</p>
<p>"Pleasanter! In that loneliness?"</p>
<p>"It is the company here that makes it prudent. And you may take
the Princess Valeria and her brother with you. Come, come, Madonna.
Will you trifle with Fate at such a time? Will you jeopardize a
glorious destiny for the sake of an obese young lordling?"</p>
<p>She considered, her face fretful. "Tell me," she begged again,
"what my lord has divulged to you of his intentions?"</p>
<p>"Have I not said enough already?"</p>
<p>The entrance of Filippo Maria at that moment saved him the need
of further invention. It perturbed him not at all that the Prince's
round white face should darken at the sight of them so close and
fond. She was warned. Her greed of power and honour would curb her
wantonness and ensure her withdrawal to Melagnano as he urged.
Bellarion glowed with the satisfaction of a battle won, nor
troubled about the deceit he had practised.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-05" id="ch-3-05"></a>CHAPTER V. JUSTICE</h2>
<p>The Epiphany mummeries were long overpast, the iron hand of
winter was withdrawn from the land, and in the great forest of
Pavia, where Gian Galeazzo had loved to hunt, the trees were
breaking into bud before Bellarion's condition permitted him to
think of quitting the ease of Filippo Maria's castle. His leg had
mended well, the knee-joint had recovered its suppleness, and only
a slight limp remained.</p>
<p>He spoke of returning to Bergamo. "This lotus-eating has endured
too long already," he told the Prince in answer to the latter's
remonstrances; for Filippo Maria was reluctant to part with one who
in many ways had beguiled for him the tedium of his lonely life,
rendered lonelier than ever before by the withdrawal of the
Countess of Biandrate, who had gone with the Montferrine princes to
Melagnano.</p>
<p>But it was not written that Filippo Maria should be left alone;
for on the very eve of Bellarion's intended departure Facino
himself was borne into the Castle of Pavia, crippled by an attack
of gout of a severity which had compelled him to leave his camp
just as he was preparing to reap the fruits of his long and patient
siege.</p>
<p>He had lost weight, and his face, out of which the healthy tan
had departed, was grey and drawn. His hair from fulvid that it had
been was almost white. But the spirit within remained unchanged,
indomitable, and tolerant of this enforced inertia of the
flesh.</p>
<p>He was put to bed immediately on his arrival, for he was in
great pain, and swore that the gout, which he called by all manner
of evil names, had got into his stomach.</p>
<p>"Mombelli warned me there was danger of it."</p>
<p>"Where is Mombelli?" Bellarion asked. He stood with Filippo
Maria by the canopied bed in a spacious chamber in the northern
tower, adjacent to the Hall of Mirrors.</p>
<p>"Mombelli, devil take his soul, left me a month ago, when I
seemed well, to go to Duke Gian Maria who desired to appoint him
his physician. I've sent for him again to the Duke. Meanwhile some
Pavese doctor will be required to give me ease." He groaned with
pain. Then, recovering, rapped out his orders to Bellarion. "It's a
mercy you are recovered, for you are needed at Bergamo. Meanwhile
Carmagnola commands there but he has my orders to surrender his
authority to you on your arrival."</p>
<p>It was an order which Carmagnola did not relish, as he plainly
showed when Bellarion reached the camp two days later. But he dared
not disobey it.</p>
<p>Bellarion examined the dispositions, but changed nothing. He
carried forward the plans already made by Facino. The siege could
be tightened no further, and, considering the straits to which
Malatesta must be reduced, there could be little point in wasting
lives on an assault.</p>
<p>A week after Bellarion's coming there rode into the great camp
of green tents under the walls of Bergamo a weary, excited fellow
all splashed with mud from the fury of his riding.</p>
<p>Brought, by the guards who had checked his progress, to Facino's
large and handsomely equipped pavilion, pitched beside the rocking
waters of the Serio, this slight, swarthy, fierce-eyed man proved
to be that stormy petrel, Giovanni Pusterla of Venegono.</p>
<p>Bellarion rose from the couch, which was covered by a black
bear-skin, and closed the beautifully illuminated copy of Juvenal's
"Satires", which had been a parting gift from Filippo Maria. His
gesture dismissed the Swiss halberdier who had ushered in this
visitor. The very name of Venegono was of ill-omen, and ill-omened
was the man's haggard countenance now, and his own
announcement.</p>
<p>"I bring evil tidings, Lord Count."</p>
<p>"You are consistent," said Bellarion. "A great quality."</p>
<p>Venegono stared at him. "Give me to drink," he begged. "God! How
I thirst. I have ridden from Pavia without pause save to change
horse at Caravaggio."</p>
<p>"From Pavia!" Bellarion's tone and manner changed; apprehension
showed in both. But not on that account was he neglectful of the
needs of his guest. On an ample square table in mid-tent stood a
jug of wine and some beautiful drinking-cups, their bowls of beaten
gold, their stems of choicely wrought silver, beside a dish of
sweetmeats, bread and a small loaf of cheese. Bellarion poured a
cup of strong red Valtelline. Venegono drained it.</p>
<p>"Ay, I am consistent, as you say. And so is that hell-spawn Gian
Maria Visconti. Of his consistency, mine. By your leave."</p>
<p>He flung himself wearily into the cushioned faldstool by the
table, and set down his cup. Bellarion nodded, and resumed his seat
on the bearskin.</p>
<p>"What has happened in Pavia?"</p>
<p>"In Pavia, nothing. Nothing yet. I rode there to warn Facino of
what is happening in Milan, but Facino...The man is ill. He could
do nothing if he would; so I come on to you." And now leaning
forward and scarcely pausing to draw breath, he launched the news
he had ridden so desperately to bring. "Della Torre is back in
Milan, recalled by Gian Maria."</p>
<p>Bellarion waited, but nothing further came.</p>
<p>"Well, man?" he asked. "Is that all?"</p>
<p>"All? Does it mean so little to you that you ask that? Don't you
know that this damned Guelph whom Facino banished when he should
have hanged him has been throughout the inspirer of all the evil
that has been wrought against Facino and against all the
Ghibellines of Milan? Don't you understand that his return bodes
ill?"</p>
<p>"What can he do? What can Gian Maria do? Their wings are
clipped."</p>
<p>"They are growing fresh ones." Venegono came to his feet again,
his weariness forgotten in his excitement. "Since della Torre's
secret return a month ago, orators have been sent to Theodore of
Montferrat, to the battered Vignati, to the Esti and even to
Estorre Visconti, to invite them into a league."</p>
<p>Bellarion laughed. "Let them league. If they are so mad as to do
so, Facino will smash their league into shards when this Bergamo
business is over. You forget that under his hand is the strongest
army in Italy today. We muster over twelve thousand men."</p>
<p>"My God! I seem to be listening to Facino himself." Venegono
slobbered in his excitement, his eyes wild. "It was thus he
answered me."</p>
<p>"Why, then, have troubled to come to me?"</p>
<p>"In the hope that you would see what he will not. You talk as if
the army were all. You forget that Gian Maria is a thing of venom,
like the emblem of his accursed house. Where there is venom and the
will to use it, beware the occasion. If anything should happen to
Facino, what hope will remain for the Ghibellines of Milan?"</p>
<p>"What should happen to Facino? At what are you hinting,
man?"</p>
<p>Venegono looked at him between rage and compassion. "Where is
Mombelli?" he asked. "Why is he not with Facino now that Facino
needs him? Do you know?"</p>
<p>"But is he not with Facino? Has he not yet arrived?"</p>
<p>"Arrived? Why was he ever withdrawn? To be made physician to the
Duke. A pretext, my friend, to deprive Facino of his healing
services. Do you know that since his coming to Milan he has not
been seen? There are rumours that he is dead, that the Duke has
murdered him."</p>
<p>Bellarion considered. Then he shrugged. "Your imagination fools
you, Venegono. If Gian Maria proposed to strike Facino, he would
surely attempt something more active and effective."</p>
<p>"It may be little, I confess. But it is a straw that points the
way of the wind."</p>
<p>"A straw indeed," Bellarion agreed. "But in any case, what do
you require of me? You have not told me that."</p>
<p>"That you take a strong detachment of your men and repair at
once to Milan to curb the Duke's evil intentions and to deal with
della Torre."</p>
<p>"For that my lord's orders would be necessary. My duty is here,
Venegono, and I dare not neglect it. Nor is the matter so urgent.
It can wait until Bergamo has been reduced, which will not be
long."</p>
<p>"Too long it may be."</p>
<p>But not all the passionate pleading with which he now distressed
Bellarion could turn the latter from his clear duty or communicate
to him any of the vague alarms which agitated Venegono. And so, at
last, he went his ways in despair, protesting that both Bellarion
and Facino were beset by the blindness of those whom the Gods
wished to destroy.</p>
<p>Bellarion, however, saw in Venegono's warning no more than an
attempt to use him for the execution of a private vengeance. Three
days later he thought he had confirmation of this. It came in a
letter bearing Facino's signature, but penned in the crabbed and
pointed hand of the Countess, who had been summoned from Melagnano
to minister to her lord. It informed Bellarion that the physician
Mombelli had' come at last in response to Facino's request, and
that Facino hoped soon to be afoot again. Indeed, there was already
a perceptible improvement in his condition.</p>
<p>"So much for Venegono's rumours that Mombelli has been
murdered," said Bellarion to himself, and laughed at the
scaremongering of that credulous hot-head.</p>
<p>But he thought differently when after another three days a
second letter reached him signed by the Countess herself.</p>
<p class="letter">My lord begs you to come to him at once [she
wrote]. He is so ill that Messer Mombelli despairs of him. Do not
lose a moment, or you may be too late.</p>
<p>He was more deeply stirred by that summons than by anything he
could remember. If those who accounted him hard and remorselessly
calculating could have seen him in that moment, the tears filming
his eyes at the very thought of losing this man whom he loved, they
must have formed a gentler opinion of his nature.</p>
<p>He sent at once for Carmagnola and ordered a strong horse to be
saddled and twenty lances to prepare to ride with him. Ride with
him, however, they did not. They followed. For he rode like one
possessed of devils. In three hours he covered the forty miles of
difficult road that lay between Bergamo and Pavia, leaving one
horse foundered and arriving on a second one that was spent by the
time he reached Filippo Maria's stronghold. Down he flung from it
in the great courtyard, and staggering and bespattered he mounted
the main staircase so wide and of such shallow steps that it was
possible to ascend it on horseback.</p>
<p>Without pausing to see the Prince, he had himself conducted
straight to Facino's chamber, and there under the damask-hung
canopy he found his adoptive father supine, inert, his countenance
leaden-hued, looking as if he were laid out in death, save for his
stertorous breathing and the fire that still glowed in the eyes
under their tufted fulvid brows.</p>
<p>Bellarion went down on his knees beside the bed and took in both
his own, that were so warm and strong, the cold, heavy hand that
lay upon the coverlet.</p>
<p>The grey head rolled a little on its pillow; the ghost of a
smile irradiated the strong, rugged face; the fingers of the cold
hand faintly pressed Bellarion's.</p>
<p>"Good lad, you have lost no time," said a weak, rasping voice.
"And there is no time to lose. I am sped. Indeed, my body's dead
already. Mombelli says the gout is mounting to my heart."</p>
<p>Bellarion looked up. Beyond the bed stood the Countess, fretful
and troubled. At the foot was Mombelli, and in the background a
servant.</p>
<p>"Is this so?" he asked the physician. "Can your skill avail
nothing here?"</p>
<p>"He is in God's hands," said Mombelli, mumbling
indistinctly.</p>
<p>"Send them away," said Facino, and his eyes indicated Mombelli
and the servants. "There is little time, and I have things to tell
you. We must take orders for what's to follow."</p>
<p>The orders did not amount to very much. He required of Bellarion
that he should afford the Countess his protection, and he
recommended to him also Filippo Maria.</p>
<p>"When Gian Galeazzo died he left his sons in my care. I go to
meet him with clean hands. I have discharged my trust, and, dying,
I hand it on to you. Remember always that Gian Maria is Duke of
Milan, and, whatever the shortcomings he may show, for your own
sake if not for his, practise loyalty to him, as you would have
your own captains be loyal to you."</p>
<p>When at last, wearied, and announcing his desire to rest, Facino
bade him go, Bellarion found Mombelli pacing the Hall of Mirrors,
and sent him to Facino.</p>
<p>"I shall remain here within call," he said, and, oblivious of
his own fatigue, he paced in his turn that curious floor whereon
birds and beasts were figured in mosaics under the gaudy flashing
ceiling of coloured glass, whence the place derived its name.</p>
<p>There Mombelli found him a half-hour later, when he emerged.</p>
<p>"He sleeps now," he said. "The Countess is with him."</p>
<p>"It is not yet the end?" Bellarion asked.</p>
<p>"Not yet. The end is when God wills. He may linger for some
days."</p>
<p>Bellarion looked sharply at the doctor, considered him, indeed,
now for the first time since his arrival. This Mombelli was a man
of little more than thirty-five. He had been vigorous of frame,
inclining a little to portliness, rubicund if grave of countenance,
with strong white teeth and bright dark eyes. Bellarion beheld now
an emaciated man upon whose shrunken frame a black velvet gown hung
in loose folds. His face was pale, his eyes dull; but, oddest of
all, the very shape of his face had changed; his jaw had fallen in,
so that nose and chin were brought closer like those of an old man,
and when he spoke he hissed and mumbled indistinctly over toothless
gums.</p>
<p>"By the Host, man! What has happened to you?"</p>
<p>Mombelli shrank visibly from the questions and from the stern
eyes that seemed to search his very soul.</p>
<p>"I...I...I have been ill," he faltered. "Very ill. It is a
miracle I am alive today."</p>
<p>"But your teeth, man?"</p>
<p>"I have lost them, as you see. A consequence of my disease."</p>
<p>A horrible suspicion was sprouting in Bellarion's mind,
nourished by the memory of the rumour of this man's death which
Venegono had reported. He took the doctor by the sleeve of his
velvet gown and drew him towards one of the double windows. His
shrinking, his obvious reluctance to undergo this closer
inspection, were so much added fuel to Bellarion's suspicion.</p>
<p>"How do you call this disease?" he asked.</p>
<p>Clearly, from his hesitancy, Mombelli had been unprepared for
the question. "It...it is a sort of podagric affection," he
mumbled.</p>
<p>"And your thumb? Why is that bandaged?"</p>
<p>Terror leapt to Mombelli's eyes. His toothless jaws worked
fearfully. "That? That is naught. An injury."</p>
<p>"Take off the bandage. Take it off, man. I desire to see this
injury. Do you hear me?"</p>
<p>At last Mombelli with shaking fingers stripped the bandage from
his left thumb and displayed it naked.</p>
<p>Bellarion went white, and his eyes were dreadful. "You have been
tortured, master doctor. Gian Maria has subjected you to his
Lent."</p>
<p>This Lent of Gian Maria's invention was a torment lasting forty
days, on each of which one or more teeth were torn from the
patient's jaws, then day by day a fingernail, whereafter followed
the eyes and finally the tongue, whereupon, the sufferer being
rendered dumb and unable to confess what was desired, he was shown
at last the mercy of being put to death.</p>
<p>Mombelli's livid lips moved frantically, but no words came. He
reeled where he stood until he found the wall to steady him, and
Bellarion watched him with those dreadful, searching eyes.</p>
<p>"To what end did he torture you? What did he desire of you?"</p>
<p>"I have not said he tortured me. It is not true."</p>
<p>"You have not said it. No. But your condition says it. You have
not said it, because you dare not. Why did he do this? And why did
he desist?" Bellarion gripped him by the shoulders. "Answer me. To
what did the torments undergone suffice to constrain you? Will you
answer me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, God!" groaned the physician, sagging limply there against
the wall, and looking as if he would faint.</p>
<p>But there was no pity in Bellarion's face. "Come with me," he
said, and it was almost by main force that he dragged the wretched
doctor across the hall out to the gallery and down the wide steps
to the great court. Here, under the arcade, some men-at-arms of
Facino's bodyguard were idling. Into their hands Bellarion
delivered Mombelli. "To the question chamber," he said shortly.
Mombelli, shattered in nerve and sapped of manhood by his
sufferings cried out, piteously inarticulate. Pitilessly Bellarion
waved him away and the soldiers bore him off screaming to the stone
chamber under the north-eastern tower. There, in the middle of the
uneven stone floor, stood the dread framework of the rack.</p>
<p>Bellarion, who had followed, ordered them to strip him. The men
were reluctant to do the office of executioners, but under the eyes
of Bellarion, standing as implacable as the god of wrath, they set
about it nevertheless, and all the while the broken man's cries for
mercy filled that vaulted place with an ever-mounting horror. At
the last, half-naked, he broke from the men's hands and flung
himself at Bellarion's feet.</p>
<p>"In the name of the sweet Christ, my lord, take pity on me! I
can bear no more. Hang me if you will, but do not let me be
tortured again."</p>
<p>Bellarion looked down on the grovelling, slobbering wretch with
an infinite compassion in his soul. But there was no sign of it on
his countenance or in his voice.</p>
<p>"You have but to answer my question, sir, and you shall have
your wish. You shall be hanged without further suffering. Why did
the Duke torture you, and why did the torture cease when it did? To
what importunities did you yield?"</p>
<p>"Already you have guessed it, my lord. That is why you use me
so! But it is not just. As God's my witness, it is not just. What
am I but a poor man caught in the toils of the evil desires of
others? As long as God gave me strength to resist, I resisted. But
I could bear no more. There was no price at which I would not have
purchased respite from that horror. Death I could have borne had
that been all they threatened. But I had reached the end of my
endurance of pain. Oh, my lord, if I were a villain there would
have been no turture to endure. They offered me bribes, bribes
great enough to dazzle a poor man, that would have left me rich for
the remainder of my days. When I refused they threatened me with
death unless I did their infamous will. Those threats I defied.
Then they subjected me to this protracted agony which the Duke
impiously calls his Lent. They drew my teeth, brutally with
unutterable violence, two each day until they were all gone. Broken
and almost starved as I was, distracted by pain which for a
fortnight had been unceasing, they began upon my fingernails. But
when they tore the nail from my left thumb I could bear no more. I
yielded to their infamy."</p>
<p>Bellarion made a sign to the men, and they pulled Mombelli to
his feet. But his eyes dared not meet the terrible glance of
Bellarion's.</p>
<p>"You yielded to their demands that, under the pretence of curing
him, you should poison my Lord Facino. That is the thing to which
you yielded. But when you say 'they' whom do you mean?"</p>
<p>"The Duke Gian Maria and Antonio della Torre." Bellarion
remembered Venegono's warning. "He is a thing of venom, like the
emblem of his house."</p>
<p>"Poor wretch!" said Bellarion. "You deserve some mercy and you
shall have it, provided you can undo what you have done."</p>
<p>"Alas, my lord!" Mombelli groaned, wringing his hands in a
passion of despair. "Alas! There is no antidote to that poison. It
works slowly, gradually corroding the intestines. Hang me, my lord,
and have done. Had I been less of a coward I would have hanged
myself before I did this thing. But the Duke threatened that if I
failed him the torture should be resumed and continued until I died
of sheer exhaustion. Also, he swore that my refusal would not save
my Lord Facino whom he could find other means of dispatching."</p>
<p>Bellarion stood between loathing and compassion. But there was
no thought in his mind of hanging this poor wretch who had been the
victim of that malignant Duke.</p>
<p>He uttered an order in cold, level tones: "Restore him his
garments and place him in confinement until I send for him
again."</p>
<p>On that he departed from that underground chamber and slowly,
thoughtfully, made his way above.</p>
<p>By the time he reached the courtyard his resolve was taken.
Though his neck should pay for it, Gian Maria should not escape.
For the first and only time in those adventurous years of his did
he swerve from the purpose by which he laid his course and turn his
hand to attack that was not more or less directly concerned with
its ultimate fulfilment.</p>
<p>And so, without pausing for rest or food, you behold him once
more in the saddle, riding hard for Milan, on that Monday
afternoon.</p>
<p>He conceived that he bore thither the first news of Facino's
moribund condition.</p>
<p>But rumour had been ahead of him by a day and a half, and the
rumour ran not that Facino was dying, but that he was already
dead.</p>
<p>In all the instances history affords of poetic justice to give
pause to those who offend against God and man, none is more
arresting than that of the fate of Gian Maria Visconti. Already on
the previous Friday word had reached the Duke not only from
Mombelli, but from at least one of the spies he had placed in his
brother's household, that the work of poisoning was done and that
Facino's hours were numbered. Gloating with della Torre and Lonate
over the assurance that at last the ducal neck was delivered from
that stern heel under which so long it had writhed like the serpent
of evil under the heel of Saint Michael, Gian Maria had been unable
to keep the knowledge to himself. About the court on that same
Friday night he spoke unguardedly of Facino as dead or dying, and
from the Court the news filtered through to the city and was known
to all by the morning of Saturday. And that news carried with it a
dismay more utter and overwhelming than any that had yet descended
upon Milan since Gian Maria had worn the ducal crown. Facino, when
yielding the authority of ducal governor, had been the people's
bulwark against the extortions, brutalities and criminal follies of
their Duke. When absent and deposed from power, he had still been
their hope, and they had possessed their souls as best they could
against the day of his return, which they knew must dawn. But
Facino dead meant an unbridling of the Duke's bestiality, a free
charter to his misrule, and for his people an outlook of utter
hopelessness. It may be that they exaggerated in their own minds
this calamity. It was for them the end of the world. Despair
settled that morning upon the city. The Duke would have laughed if
it had been reported to him, because he lacked the wit to perceive
that when men are truly desperate catastrophes ensue.</p>
<p>And at once, whilst the great mass of the people were stricken
by horror into a dull inertia, there were those who saw that the
situation called for action. Of these were members of the leading
Ghibelline families of Bagio, of del Maino Trivulzi, Aplirandi and
others. There was that Bertino Mantegazza, Captain of the Ducal
Guard, whose face the Duke had one day broken with his iron
gauntlet, and fiercest and most zealous of all there was that
Giovanni Pusterla of Venegono, whose family had suffered such deep
and bitter wrongs at the Duke's hands.</p>
<p>There was no suspicion in the mind of any that the Duke himself
was responsible for the death of Facino. It was simply that
Facino's death created a situation only to be met by the
destruction of the Duke. And this situation the Duke himself had
been at such hideous pains to bring about.</p>
<p>And so, briefly to recapitulate here a page of Visconti History,
it came to pass that on the Monday morning, which was the first day
of the Litany of May, as Gian Maria, gaily clad in his colours of
red and white, was issuing from his bedroom to repair to Mass in
the Church of Saint Gothard, he found in the antechamber a score of
gentlemen not latterly seen about his court. Mantegazza, who had
command of the entrance, was responsible for their presence.</p>
<p>Before the Duke could comment upon this unusual attendance,
perhaps before he had well observed it, three of them were upon
him.</p>
<p>"This from the Pusterla!" cried Venegono, and with his dagger
clove the Duke's brow, slaying him instantly. Yet before he fell
Andrea Bagio's blade was buried in his right thigh, so that
presently that white-stockinged leg was as red as its fellow.</p>
<p>As a consequence, Bellarion, reaching Milan at dusk that
evening, found entrance denied him at the Ticinese Gate, which was
held by Paolo del Bagio with a strong following of men-at-arms. Not
until he had disclosed himself for Facino's lieutenant was he
admitted and informed of what had taken place.</p>
<p>The irony of the event provoked in him a terrible mirth.</p>
<p>"Poor purblind fool," was his comment. "He never guessed when he
was torturing Mombelli that he was signing his own death warrant."
That and the laugh with which he rode on into the city left Bagio
wondering whether his wits had turned.</p>
<p>He rode through streets in uproar, where almost every man he met
was armed. Before the broken door of a half-shattered house hung
some revolting bleeding rags of what had been a man. These were all
that remained of Squarcia Giramo, the infamous kennel-master, who
had been torn into pieces that day by the mob and finally hung
there before his dwelling, which on the morrow was to be razed to
the ground.</p>
<p>He came to the old Broletto and the Church of Saint Gothard, and
paused there to survey the Duke's body where it lay under an
apronful of roses which had been cast upon it by a harlot. Thence
he repaired to the stables of the palace, and by making himself
known procured a fresh horse. On this he made his way through the
ever-increasing tumult of the streets, back to the Ticinese Gate,
and he was away through the darkness to cover for the second time
that day the twenty miles that lay between Milan and Pavia.</p>
<p>It was past midnight when, so jaded that he kept his feet by a
sheer effort of the will, he staggered into Filippo Maria's
bedchamber, ushered by the servant who had preceded him to rouse
the Prince.</p>
<p>Filippo Maria sat up in bed, blinking in the candle-light at
that tall swaying figure that was almost entirely clothed in
mud.</p>
<p>"Is that you, Lord Bellarion? You will have heard that Facino is
dead&mdash;God rest his soul!"</p>
<p>A harsh, croaking voice made him answer. "Ay, and avenged, Lord
Duke."</p>
<p>A quiver crossed the pale fat face under its sleek black cap of
hair. The coarse lips parted. "Lord...Lord Duke...you said?" The
high-pitched voice was awe-stricken.</p>
<p>"Your brother Duke Gian Maria is dead, my lord, and you are Duke
of Milan."</p>
<p>"Duke of Milan? I am...?" The grotesque young face showed
bewilderment, confusion, fear. "And Gian Maria...Dead, do you
say?"</p>
<p>Bellarion did not mince matters, "He was dispatched to Hell this
morning by some gentlemen in Milan."</p>
<p>"Jesus-Mary!" croaked the Prince, and fell to trembling.
"Murdered... And you...?" He heaved himself higher in the bed with
one arm, whilst he flung out the other in accusation. He did not
love his brother. He profited greatly by his death. But a Visconti
did not permit that others should lay hands on a Visconti.</p>
<p>Bellarion laughed oddly. He had been forestalled. Perhaps it was
as well. No need now to speak of his intentions.</p>
<p>"He was slain on his way to Mass this morning at just about the
hour that I arrived here from Bergamo."</p>
<p>The accusing arm fell heavily to the Prince's obese flank. The
beady, lack-lustre eyes still peered at the young condottiero.</p>
<p>"Almost I thought...And Giannino is dead...murdered. God rest
him!" The phrase was mechanical. "Tell me about it."</p>
<p>Bellarion recited what he knew, then staggered out on the arm of
the servant who was to conduct him to the room prepared for
him.</p>
<p>"What a world! What a dunghill!" he muttered as he went. "And
how well the old abbot knows it. Pax multa in cella, foris autem
plurima bella!"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-06" id="ch-3-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. THE
INHERITANCE</h2>
<p>Facino Cane, Count of Biandrate, Lord of Novara, Dertona,
Varese, Rosate, Valsassina and of all the lands on Lake Maggiore as
far as Vogogna, was buried with great pomp in the Church of San
Pietro in Ciel d'Oro.</p>
<p>His chief mourners were his captains, summoned from Bergamo to
do that last honour to their departed leader. At their head, as
mourner-in-chief, walked Facino's adoptive son, Bellarion Cane,
Count of Gavi. The others included Francesco Busone of Carmagnola,
Giorgio Valperga, Nicolino Marsalia, Werner von Stoffel and
Vaugeois the Burgundian.</p>
<p>Koenigshofen and the Piedmontese, Giasone Trotta, were absent,
having remained at Bergamo with the army.</p>
<p>Thereafter the captains assembled in the Hall of Mirrors to hear
the will and last instructions of Facino. To read them came
Facino's secretary, accompanied by the Pavese notary who had drawn
up the testament three days ago. Thither also came the Countess,
robed entirely in black, and heavily veiled.</p>
<p>The rich and important fief of Valsassina was now disclosed to
have been left by Facino to his adoptive son Bellarion, "in earnest
of my love and to recompense his loyalty and wort." Apart from that
and a legacy in money for Carmagnola, the whole of his vast
territorial possessions of cities, lands and fortresses&mdash;mostly
acquired since he had been deposed in favour of Malatesta&mdash;besides
the enormous sum of four hundred thousand ducats, were all
bequeathed to his widow. He expressed the wish that Bellarion
should succeed him in the command of his condotta, and, reminding
his other captains that strength lies in unity, he recommended them
to remain united under Bellarion's leadership, at least until the
task of restoring order to the Duchy should be fulfilled. To his
captains, also, he recommended his widow, putting it upon them to
see her firmly established in the dominions he bequeathed to
her.</p>
<p>When the reading was done, the captains rose in their places and
turned to Madonna Beatrice where she sat like an ebony statue at
the table's head. Carmagnola, ever theatrical, ever a man of
attitudes, drew his sword with a flourish and laid it on the
board.</p>
<p>"Madonna, to you I surrender the authority I held under my Lord
Facino, and I leave it in your hands until such time as it shall
please you to reinvest me in it."</p>
<p>The ceremonious gesture caught the fancy of the others. Valperga
followed the example instantly, and presently five swords lay naked
on the oak. To these Bellarion, after a moment, a little scornful
of this ritual, as he was of all unnecessary displays, added his
own.</p>
<p>The Countess rose. She thanked them in a voice that shook with
emotion, and one by one restored their weapons to them, naming each
as she did so. Bellarion's, however, she left upon the board,
wherefore Bellarion, wondering a little, remained when she
dismissed the others.</p>
<p>Slowly then she resumed her seat. Slowly she raised and threw
back her veil, disclosing a face which, beyond a deeper pallor,
resulting perhaps from contrast with her sable raiment, showed
little trace of grief. Her feline eyes considered him, a little
frown between their fine black brows.</p>
<p>"You were the last to offer me that homage, Bellarion." Her
voice was slow and softly attuned. "Why did you hesitate? Are you
reluctant?"</p>
<p>"It was a gesture, Madonna, that becomes the Carmagnolas of this
world. Sincerity requires no symbols, and it was only at the symbol
that I boggled. My service and my life are unreservedly at your
command."</p>
<p>There was a pause. Her eyes continued to ponder him. "Take up
your sword," she said at last.</p>
<p>He moved to do so, and then checked. "Yourself, you restored
theirs to the others."</p>
<p>"The others are not as you. Upon you has fallen the mantle of
Facino. How much of that mantle will you wear, Bellarion?"</p>
<p>"As much of it as my lord intended. You have heard his
testament, Madonna."</p>
<p>"But not your own interpretation of it."</p>
<p>"Have I not said that my life and service are at your command,
as my lord to whom I owe everything enjoined upon me?"</p>
<p>"Your life and services," she said slowly. Her breast heaved as
if in repressed agitation. "That is much to offer, Bellarion. Do
you ask nothing in return?"</p>
<p>"I offer these in return for all that I have received already.
It is I who make payment, Madonna."</p>
<p>Again there was a baffled pause. She sighed heavily. "You make
it hard for me, Bellarion." There was a pathetic break in her
voice.</p>
<p>"What do I make hard?"</p>
<p>She rose and, in evident timidity, came to stand before him. She
set a white hand on the black velvet sleeve of his tunic. Her
lovely face, with which time had dealt so mercifully, was upturned
to his, and there was now no arrogance in its lines or in her
glance. She spoke quietly, wistfully.</p>
<p>"You may think, Bellarion, that with my lord scarce buried this
is not the hour for...what I have to say. And yet by the very fact
of my lord's death, and by the very terms of his testament, this is
the hour, because it must be the hour of decision. Here and now we
must determine what is to follow."</p>
<p>Tall and coldly stern he stood looking down upon her who swayed
a little there so close to him that his nostrils were invaded by
the subtle essences she used.</p>
<p>"I await your commands, Madonna."</p>
<p>"My commands? My commands? Dear God! What commands have I for
you?" She looked away for an instant, then brought her eyes back to
his face and her other hand to his other sleeve so that she held
him completely captive now. A faint colour stirred in the pale
cheeks.</p>
<p>"My lord has left me great possessions. They might serve as a
footstool to help you mount to a great destiny."</p>
<p>A little smile hovered about his lips as he looked down upon her
who waited so breathlessly, her breast now touching his own.</p>
<p>"You are offering me..." he said, and stopped.</p>
<p>"Can you doubt what I am offering? It is the hour of great
decisions, Bellarion, for me and for you." Closer she pressed, so
that her weight was against him. She was deathly pale again, her
eyes were veiled. "In unity is strength. That was Facino's last
reminder to us. And in what unity could there be greater strength
than in ours? Facino's army, the strongest that ever followed him,
is solidly behind us, so that we stand together. With that and my
resources you need set no bounds to your ambition. You may be Duke
of Milan, if you will. You may even realize Galeazzo's dream and
make yourself King of Italy."</p>
<p>His hovering smile settled and deepened. But the dark eyes grew
sad.</p>
<p>"The world and you have never suspected," he said gently, "that
I am not really ambitious. You have witnessed my rise in four short
years from a poor, nameless starveling scholar to knighthood,
lordships, wealth and fame; and, therefore, you imagine that I am
one who has striven for the bounties of Fortune. It is not so,
Madonna. I have laboured for ends that are nowise bound up with the
hope of any of these rewards, which I hold cheap. They are hollow
vanities, empty bubbles, gewgaws to delight the children of the
world. Possessions come to me, titles, honours; but they deceive me
no more than I desire them."</p>
<p>She drew away from him a little and looked at him almost in awe.
"God! You talk like a monk!"</p>
<p>"It is possible that I think like one, and very natural,
remembering how I was nurtured. There is one task, one purpose
which has detained me in this world of men. When that is
accomplished I think I shall go back to the cell where there is
peace."</p>
<p>"You!" Her hands had fallen from his arms. She gasped now in her
amazement. "With the world at your feet if you choose! To renounce
all? To go back to the chill loneliness and joylessness of
monkhood? Bellarion, you are mad."</p>
<p>"Or else sane, Madonna. Who shall judge?"</p>
<p>"And love, Bellarion? Is there no love in the world? Does that
not lend reality to all these things that you deem shams?"</p>
<p>"Does it heal the vanity of the world?" he cried. "It is a great
power, as I perceive. For love men will go mad, they will become
beasts; they will murder and betray."</p>
<p>"Heretic!"</p>
<p>That startled him a little. Once before he had been dubbed
heretic for beliefs to which he clung with assurance; and
experience had come to lay bare his heresy to his own eyes.</p>
<p>"Upon occasion, Madonna, we have talked of love, you and I. Had
I given heed, had your beauty beglamoured me, what a treacherous
thing should I not have been in Facino's eyes? Do you wonder that I
mistrust love as I mistrust all else the world can offer me?"</p>
<p>"While Facino lived, that..." She broke off. Her eyes were on
the ground, her hands now folded in her lap. She bad drawn away
from him a little and leaned against the table's edge. "Now..." She
parted her hands and held them out, leaving him to guess her
mind.</p>
<p>"Now his behests are upon me, and they shall be obeyed as if he
still lived."</p>
<p>"What is there in his behests against...against what I was
offering? Am I not commended to you by his testament? Am I not a
part of his legacy to you?"</p>
<p>"The service of you is; and your loyal servant, Madonna, you
shall ever find me."</p>
<p>She turned aside with a little gesture of irritation and
remained silent, thoughtful.</p>
<p>A sleek secretary broke in upon them. The Count of Pavia
commanded the Lord Bellarion's presence in the library. A courier
had just arrived from Milan with grave news.</p>
<p>"Say to his highness that I come."</p>
<p>The secretary withdrew.</p>
<p>"You give me leave, Madonna?"</p>
<p>She stood leaning sideways against the heavy table, her face
averted. "Ay, you may go." Her voice rasped.</p>
<p>But he waited yet a moment. "The sword, Madonna? Will you not
arm me with your own hands for your service?"</p>
<p>She turned her head to look at him again, and there was now a
curl of disdain on her pale lips.</p>
<p>"I thought you looked askance on symbols. Was not that your
profession?" She paused, but without waiting for his answer, added:
"Take up your sword yourself, you that are so fully master of your
own destinies."</p>
<p>And on that she turned and went, trailing her funeral draperies
over the gay mosaics of that patterned floor.</p>
<p>He remained where she left him until she had passed out of that
great hall and the door had closed. Then at last he fetched a sigh,
and went to restore his blade to its scabbard.</p>
<p>His thoughts were on Facino hardly cold in the grave, on this
widow who had so shamelessly wooed him, yet in terms which demanded
as a condition the satisfaction of her inordinate ambition, and
lastly on that obese young Prince who waited for him. And in the
mirror of his mind he saw a reflection of a scene now some months
old. He saw again the glance of those beady, lecherous eyes lambent
about Facino's Countess.'</p>
<p>Inspiration came to him of how best he might gratify her vast
ambition, her greed of greatness. Her suggestion to him had been
that he should make her Duchess of Milan; and Duchess of Milan he
would make her yet.</p>
<p>On that half-ironic thought he came to the library where the
Prince waited. Filippo Maria was seated at a table near one of the
windows. Spread before him were some parchments, writing-materials
and a horn of unicorn that was almost a yard long, of solid ivory,
one of the library's most treasured possessions.</p>
<p>The Prince was more than usually pallid, his glance unsteady,
his manner nervous and agitated. Perfunctorily he made the
inquiries concerning the obsequies of Facino which courtesy
demanded. He reiterated excuses already made for his own absence
from the ceremony, an absence really based on resentment of the
yoke which Facino had imposed upon him. That done, he picked up a
parchment from the table.</p>
<p>"Here's news," he said, and his voice trembled. "Estorre
Visconti has been created Duke of Milan." He paused, and the little
dark eyes blinked up at the tall Bellarion standing composed at his
side. "You know already?"</p>
<p>"Not so, highness."</p>
<p>"And you show no surprise?"</p>
<p>"It is a bold step, and it should cost Messer Estorre his head.
But it was to be expected from what had gone before."</p>
<p>The beady eyes returned to the parchment which shook in the
podgy fingers.</p>
<p>"Fra Berto Caccia, the Bishop of Piacenza, preached a sermon to
the people, lauding the murder of my brother and promising in
Estorre's name a Golden Age for Milan, with immunity from taxation.
Thereupon they laid at his bastard feet the keys of the city, the
standard of the republic and the ducal sceptre." He dropped the
parchment and sat back, folding plump white hands across his
paunch. "This calls for action speedily."</p>
<p>"We can provide action enough to surfeit Messer Estorre."</p>
<p>"Ha!" The great flabby face grew almost kindly, the little eyes
beamed upon the condottiero. "Serve me well in this, Bellarion, and
you shall know gratitude."</p>
<p>Bellarion's gesture seemed to wave the notion of reward aside.
He came straight to facts. "We can withdraw eight thousand men from
Bergamo. The place is at the point of surrender, and four thousand
will well suffice to tighten the last grip upon the Malatesta
vitals. Perhaps the Lord Estorre has not included that in his
calculations. With eight thousand men we can sweep him out of Milan
at our pleasure."</p>
<p>"And you'll give orders? You'll give orders at once? The army,
they tell me, is now in your control. Facino's authority has
descended to you and has been accepted by your brother
captains."</p>
<p>And now this arch-dissembler went to work.</p>
<p>"Hardly so much, highness. Facino's captains have sworn fealty
not to me, but to the Lady Beatrice."</p>
<p>"But...But you, then?" The news dismayed him a little. "What
place is yours?"</p>
<p>"At your highness's side, if your highness commands me."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. But whom do you command? Where, exactly, do you stand
now?"</p>
<p>"At the head of the army in any enterprise into which the
Countess sends her captains."</p>
<p>"The Countess?" The Prince shifted his bulk uneasily in his
chair, slewing round so as to face the soldier more fully.</p>
<p>"What, then, if...What if the Countess should not..." He waved
his fat hands helplessly.</p>
<p>"It is not likely that the Countess should oppose your own
wishes, highness."</p>
<p>"Not likely? But&mdash;Lord of Heaven!&mdash;it's possible." He heaved
himself up, nervous, agitated. "I must know. I must...I'll send for
her." He reached for a hand-bell on the table. But Bellarion's hand
closed over his own before he could ring.</p>
<p>"A moment, Lord Prince. Before you send for the Lady Beatrice,
had you not best consider precisely what you will say to her?"</p>
<p>"What is to say beyond discovering her disposition towards
me?"</p>
<p>"Can you entertain a doubt upon that, Lord Prince?" Bellarion
was smiling. Their hands came away together from the bell and fell
apart. "Her disposition towards your potency is, to my knowledge,
of the very kindliest. Such, indeed, that&mdash;I'll be frank with
you&mdash;I found it necessary once to remind her of her duty to her
lord."</p>
<p>"Ah!" The fat pale face quivered into something akin to
malevolence. The Prince remembered a sudden coolness in the
Countess and her removal to Melagnano, and perceived in this
meddler's confession the explanation of it. "By Saint Ambrose, that
was bold of you!"</p>
<p>"I am accounted bold," Bellarion reminded him, deeming it
necessary.</p>
<p>"Ay, ay!" The shifty eyes fell away uncomfortably under the
other's steady glance. "But if she is kindly disposed, then..."</p>
<p>"I know that she was, highness, and may be rendered so again.
Though perhaps less easily now than heretofore."</p>
<p>"Less easily? Why so?"</p>
<p>"As Facino's widow, she is in wealth and power the equal of many
a prince in Italy. She has considerable dominions..."</p>
<p>"Torn by Facino from the great heritage left by the Duke, my
father." In that rare burst of indignation his whole bulk quivered
like a great jelly.</p>
<p>"They might be restored to the ducal crown by peaceful
arts."</p>
<p>"Peaceful arts? What arts? Will you be plain?"</p>
<p>But the time for direct answers was not yet. "And not only has
the Countess lands, but the control of a vast fortune&mdash;some four
hundred thousand ducats. You will need money, highness, for the pay
of this great army now under Bergamo, and your own treasury will
hardly supply it. There is taxation. But your highness knows the
ills that wait on that for a Prince newly come into his own. And
not only the lands and money of which your highness stands in need,
but the men also, does the Countess bring."</p>
<p>"You but repeat yourself."</p>
<p>Bellarion looked at him and smiled. "Never, do I believe, did a
Prince find a bride more richly dowered."</p>
<p>"A bride?" The youth was startled, terrified almost. "A
bride?"</p>
<p>"Would less content your highness? Would you be satisfied to
receive the assistance of the Countess's possessions when you may
make them your own and wield them at your pleasure?"</p>
<p>The Prince stared, his jaw fallen. Then slowly he brought his
lips together again and licked them thoughtfully, screwing up his
mean eyes.</p>
<p>"You are proposing that I should take to wife Facino's widow,
who is twice my age?" He asked the question very slowly, as if
pondering each word of it.</p>
<p>Bellarion laughed. "Not proposing it, highness. It is not for me
to make such proposals. I do not even know what the lady will say.
But if she is willing to become Duchess of Milan she can provide
the means to make you Duke."</p>
<p>Filippo Maria sat down suddenly. The sweat broke from his pale
brow. He mopped it with his hand, disturbing the black fringe that
disfigured it. Then, lost in thought, he stroked the loose folds of
his enormous chin, and gradually his eyes kindled.</p>
<p>At long length he put forth his hand again to the bell. This
time Bellarion did not interfere. He perceived in the act the young
Prince's surrender to the forces of greed and lust which Bellarion
himself had loosed against him.</p>
<p>He took his leave, and went out with the sad knowledge that
greed and wantonness would make of the woman, too, a ready
prey.</p>
<p>His work was done. She should have the thing she coveted, and
find in it her punishment.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-07" id="ch-3-07"></a>CHAPTER VII. PRINCE OF
VALSASSINA</h2>
<p>Once more as Bellarion had calculated and disposed, so things
fell out, and Filippo Maria Visconti in the twenty-second year of
his age led to the altar the widowed Countess of Biandrate, who was
thirty-nine.</p>
<p>As a young girl, she had married at the bidding of ambition a
man who was twenty years her senior; as a middle-aged woman now,
and for the same reason, she married one who was almost as much her
junior. She had not the foresight to perceive that the grievance on
the score of disparity of years which she had nursed against Facino
would be nursed against herself, to her ultimate destruction, by
this sly, furtive and cruel Prince to whom now she gave herself and
her vast possessions. That, however, is no part of the story I have
set myself to tell.</p>
<p>Estorre Visconti defended in vain his usurped dominion against
Gian Maria's legitimate successor. Filippo Maria, with Carmagnola
in command of some seven thousand men, laid siege to Milan, whilst
Bellarion went north to make an end of the Bergamo resistance.
Because in haste to have done, he granted Malatesta easy terms of
surrender, permitting him to ride out of the city with the honours
of war, lance on thigh. Thereafter, having restored order in
Bergamo and left there a strong garrison under an officer of trust,
he marched with the main army to join Filippo Maria, who was
conducting operations from the mills on Monte Lupario, three miles
from Milan. Some four weeks already had he spent there, with little
progress made. Estorre had enrolled and constrained to the defence
of the city almost every man of an age to bear arms. It was
necessary to make an end, and Bellarion himself with a few
followers entered the Castle of Porta Giovia, which was being held
against Estorre by Vimercati the Castellan. From its walls, having
attracted the people by trumpet-blast, he published Filippo Maria's
proclamation, wherein the Prince solemnly undertook that if the
city were at once surrendered to him it should have nothing to
fear; that there should be no pillage, executions or other measures
punitive of this resistance to the State's, legitimate lord.</p>
<p>The news flew in every direction, with the result that before
nightfall all those whom Estorre had constrained to follow him had
fallen away, and he was left with only his mercenaries. With these,
next morning, he hacked a way out through the Comasina Gate as the
people were throwing open to the new Duke the gates of the city on
the other side.</p>
<p>Filippo Maria entered with a comparatively small following and
in the wake of a train of bread-carts sent ahead to relieve the
famine which already was beginning to press upon the inhabitants.
The acclamations of "Live the Duke!" quieted his natural timidity
as he rode through the streets to shut himself up in the Castle of
Porta Giovia, which remained ever afterwards his residence. Not for
Filippo Maria the Palace of the Old Broletto or the gaiety of
courts. His dark, scheming yet pusillanimous nature craved the
security of a stronghold.</p>
<p>For assisting him to the ducal throne, and no doubt to ensure
their continued support, he rewarded his captains generously, and
none more generously than Bellarion, to whom he considered that he
owed everything. Bellarion was not only confirmed in the lordship
of Valsassina in feud, for himself and his heirs for ever, but the
Duke raised the fief into a principality.</p>
<p>Bellarion remained the Duke's marshal-in-chief and military
adviser, and it was by the dispositions which he made during that
summer and autumn of 1412 that the lands of the duchy were finally
cleared of the insurgent brigands who had renewed their
depredations.</p>
<p>Peace being restored at home, and industry being liberated at
last from the trammels that had lain upon it since the death of
Gian Galeazzo, prosperity flowed swiftly back to the State of
Milan, and the people heaped blessings upon the shy, furtive ruler
of whom they saw so little.</p>
<p>It is possible that Filippo Maria would have been content to
rest for the present upon what was done, to leave the frontiers of
the duchy as he found them, and to dismiss the greater part of the
costly condottas in his employ. But Bellarion at his elbow goaded
him to further enterprise and met his sluggish reluctance with a
culminating argument that shamed him into action.</p>
<p>"Will you leave, in tranquil possession, the brigands who have
encroached upon the glorious patrimony built up by your illustrious
father? Will you dishonour his memory and be false to your name,
Lord Duke?"</p>
<p>Thus, and similarly, Bellarion, with a heat that was purely
histrionic. He cared no more for the integrity of Gian Galeazzo's
patrimony than he cared for that of the Kingdom of England. What he
cared for was that the order to dispossess those tyrants would
sound the knell of Theodore of Montferrat. Thus, at last, should he
be enabled to complete the service to which five years ago he had
dedicated himself, and to which unfalteringly, if obscurely and
tortuously, he had held. Very patiently had he waited for this hour
when, yielding at last to his bold importunities, the Duke summoned
a council of the officers of State and the chief condottieri to
determine the order in which action should be taken.</p>
<p>At once Bellarion urged that a beginning should be made by
recovering Vercelli, than which few strongholds were of more
importance to the safety of the duchy.</p>
<p>It provoked a protest from Beccaria, who was the Duke's minister
of State.</p>
<p>"An odd proposal this from you, Lord Bellarion, remembering that
it was by your own action, in concert with the Count of Biandrate,
that the Marquis Theodore was placed in possession of
Vercelli."</p>
<p>Bellarion crushed him with his logic. "Not odd, sir; natural.
Then I was on the other side. And if, being on the other side, I
conceived it important that Theodore should hold Vercelli, now that
I am opposed to him I conceive it equally important that he should
be driven from it."</p>
<p>There was a pause. Filippo Maria, somnolent in his great chair,
looked round the group. "What is the military view?" he asked. He
had noticed that not one of the captains had voiced an opinion. He
was answered now by the burly Koenigshofen.</p>
<p>"I have no views that are not Bellarion's. I have followed him
long enough to know that he's a safe man to follow."</p>
<p>Giasone Trotta, uninvited, expressed the same sentiment. Filippo
Maria turned to Carmagnola, who sat silent and thoughtful. "And
you, sir?" he asked.</p>
<p>Carmagnola reared his blond head, and Bellarion braced himself
for battle. But to his amazement, for once&mdash;for the first time in
their long association&mdash;Carmagnola was on his side.</p>
<p>"I am of Bellarion's mind, magnificent. We who were with my Lord
Facino when he made alliance with Theodore of Montferrat know
Theodore for a crafty, daring man of boundless ambition. His
occupation of Vercelli is a menace to the peace of the duchy."</p>
<p>After that the other captains, Valperga and Marsilio, who had
been wavering, threw in their votes, so that the military opinion
was solidly unanimous.</p>
<p>Filippo Maria balanced the matter for a moment. "You are not
forgetting, sirs, that for Theodore's good behaviour I have in my
hands a precious hostage in the person of his nephew, the Marquis
Gian Giacomo, in whose name Theodore rules. You laugh,
Bellarion?"</p>
<p>"That hostage was procured to ensure not the good faith of
Theodore, but the safety of the real Prince of Montferrat.
Carmagnola has told your magnificence that Theodore is crafty,
daring and ambitious. It is a part of his ambition to make himself
absolute sovereign where at present he is no more than Regent. Let
your magnificence judge if the thought of harm to the hostage you
hold would be a deterrent to him."</p>
<p>A while still they debated. Then Filippo Maria announced that he
would take thought and make known his decision when it was reached.
On that he dismissed them.</p>
<p>As they went from the Council Chamber the captains witnessed the
phenomenon of a yet closer unity between Bellarion and Carmagnola.
The new Prince of Valsassina linked arms with Francesco Busone and
drew him away. "You will do a service in this matter, Ser
Francesco, if you send word to the Lady Valeria and her brother
urging them to come at once to Milan and petition the Duke to place
Gian Giacomo upon his throne. He is of full age, and only his
absence from Montferrat enables Theodore to continue in the
Regency."</p>
<p>Carmagnola looked at him suspiciously. "Why do you not send that
message yourself?"</p>
<p>Bellarion shrugged and spread his hands a little. "I have not
the confidence of the Princess. A message from me might be
mistrusted."</p>
<p>Carmagnola's fine blue eyes pondered him still with that
suspicious glance. "What game do you play?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I see that you mistrust me too."</p>
<p>"I ever have done."</p>
<p>"It's a compliment," said Bellarion.</p>
<p>"If it is, I don't perceive it."</p>
<p>"If you did you wouldn't pay it. You are direct, Carmagnola, and
for that I honour you. I am not direct, and yet you may come to
honour me for that too when you understand it, if you ever do. You
ask what game I play. A game which began long ago, in which this is
the last move. The alliance I brought about between Facino and
Theodore was a move in this game; the securing of the person of
Gian Giacomo of Montferrat as a hostage was another; to make it
possible for Theodore to occupy Vercelli and make himself Lord of
Genoa, yet another. My only aim was to unbridle his greed so that
he should become a menace to the duchy against such a day as this
when on the Duke's side it is my duty to advise his definite
destruction."</p>
<p>Carmagnola's eyes were wide, amazement overspread his florid,
handsome face.</p>
<p>"By the bones of Saint Ambrose, you play mighty deep!"</p>
<p>Bellarion smiled. "I am frank with you. I explain myself. It is
tedious, but necessary so as to conquer your mistrust and procure
your co-operation."</p>
<p>"To make me a pawn in this game of yours?"</p>
<p>"That is to describe yourself unflatteringly. Francesco Busone
of Carmagnola is no man's pawn."</p>
<p>"No, by God! I am glad you perceive that."</p>
<p>"Should I have explained myself if I did not?" said Bellarion,
to assure him of a fact of which, clearly, he was far from
sure.</p>
<p>"Tell me why you so schemed and plotted?"</p>
<p>Bellarion sighed. "To amuse myself, perhaps. It interests me.
Facino said of me that I was a natural strategist. This broader
strategy upon the great field of life gives scope to my
inclinations." He was thoughtful, chin in hand. "I do not think
there is more in it than that." And abruptly he asked: "You'll send
that message?"</p>
<p>Carmagnola, too, considered. There was a dream that he had
dreamed, a game that he could play, making in his turn a pawn of
this crafty brother-captain who sought to make a pawn of him.</p>
<p>"I'll go to Melagnano in person," he announced.</p>
<p>He went, and there dispelled the fretful suspense in which the
Princess Valeria waited for a justice of which she almost
despaired.</p>
<p>He dealt, in that directness which was the only thing Bellarion
found to honour in him. But the sweetness now was in his manner
only.</p>
<p>"Lady, I come to bid you take a hand in your own and your
brother's reinstatement. Your petition to the Duke is all that is
needed now to persuade him to the step which I have urged; to march
against the usurper Theodore and cast him out."</p>
<p>It took her breath away. "You have urged this! You, my lord? Let
me send for my brother that he may thank you; that he may know that
he has at least one stout, brave friend in the world."</p>
<p>"His friend and your servant, Madonna." He bore her white hand
to his lips, and there were tears in her eyes as she looked upon
his bowed, handsome head. "My hopes, my plans, my schemes for you
are to bear fruit at last."</p>
<p>"Your schemes for me?"</p>
<p>Her brows were knit over her moist, dark eyes. He laughed. A
jovial, debonair and laughter-loving gentleman, this Francesco
Busone of Carmagnola.</p>
<p>"So as to provide a cause disposing the Duke of Milan to proceed
against the Regent Theodore. The hour has come, Madonna. It needs
but your petition to Filippo Maria, and the army marches. So that I
command it, I will see justice done to your brother."</p>
<p>"So that you command it? Who else should?"</p>
<p>Carmagnola's bright face was overcast. "There is Bellarion
Cane."</p>
<p>"That knave!" She recoiled, her countenance troubled. "He is the
Regent's man. It was he who helped the Regent to Vercelli and to
the Lordship of Genoa."</p>
<p>"Which he never could have done," Carmagnola assured her, "but
that I abetted him. I saw that thus I should provide a reason for
action against the Regent when later I should come to be on the
Duke's side."</p>
<p>"Ah! That was shrewd! To feed his ambition until he over-reached
himself."</p>
<p>Carmagnola strutted a little. "It was a deep game. But we are at
the last move in it. If you mistrust this Bellarion..."</p>
<p>"Mistrust him!" She laughed a bitter little laugh, and she
poured forth the tale of how once he had been a spy sent by
Theodore to embroil her, and how, thereafter, he had murdered her
one true and devoted friend Count Spigno.</p>
<p>Feeding her mistrust and bringing Gian Giacomo fully to share
it, Carmagnola conducted them to Milan and procured audience for
them with the Duke.</p>
<p>Filippo Maria received her in a small room in the very heart of
the fortress, a room to which he had brought something of the
atmosphere of his library at Pavia. Here were the choicely bound
manuscripts, and the writing-table with its sheaves of parchment
and its horn of unicorn, which, as all the world knows, is a
prophylactic against all manner of ills of the flesh and the
spirit. Its double window looked out upon the Court of San Donato,
where the October sunshine warmed the red brick to the colour of
the rose.</p>
<p>He gave her a kindly welcome, then settled into the inscrutable
inertia of an obese Eastern idol whilst she made her prayer to
him.</p>
<p>When it was done, he nodded slowly and dispatched his secretary
in quest of the Prince of Valsassina. The name conveyed nothing to
her, for she had not heard of Bellarion's latest dignity.</p>
<p>"You shall have my decision later, Madonna. It is almost made
already, and in the direction you desire. When I have conferred
with the Prince of Valsassina upon the means at our command, I will
send for you again. Meanwhile, the Lord of Carmagnola will conduct
you and your brother to my duchess, whom it will delight to care
for you." He cleared his throat. "You have leave to go," he added
in his shrill voice.</p>
<p>They bowed, and were departing, when the returning secretary
opening the door and holding up the arras that masked it,
announced: "The Prince Valsassina!"</p>
<p>He came in, erect and proud of bearing, for all that he still
limped a little. His tunic was of black velvet with dark brown fur,
a heavy gold chain hung upon his breast, a girdle of beaten gold
gripped his loins and carried his stout dagger. His hose were in
white and blue stripes.</p>
<p>From the threshold he bowed low to the Prince and then to
Madonna Valeria, who was staring at him in sudden panic.</p>
<p>She curtseyed to him almost despite herself, and then made haste
to depart with Carmagnola and her brother. But there was a weight
of lead in her breast. If action against Theodore depended upon
this man's counsel, what hope remained? She put that question to
Carmagnola. He quieted her fears.</p>
<p>"After all, he is not omnipotent. Our fealty is not to him, but
to the Duchess Beatrice. Win her to your side and things will shape
the course you desire, especially if I command the enterprise."</p>
<p>And meanwhile this man whom she mistrusted was closeted with the
Duke, and the Duke was informing him of this new factor in their
plans against Montferrat.</p>
<p>"She desired us to break a lance in her brother's behalf. But
Montferrat is loyal to Theodore. They have no opinion there of Gian
Giacomo, and to impose by force of arms a Prince upon a people is
perhaps to render that people hostile to ourselves."</p>
<p>"If that were so&mdash;and I confess that I do not share your
potency's apprehensions&mdash;it would still be the course I should
presume to advise. In Theodore you have a neighbour whom ambition
makes dangerous. In Gian Giacomo you have a mild and gentle youth,
whose thoughts, since his conversion from debauchery, turn rather
to religion than to deeds of arms. Place him upon the throne of his
fathers, and you have in such a man not only a friendly neighbour
but a grateful servant."</p>
<p>"Ha! You believe in gratitude, Bellarion?"</p>
<p>"I must, since I practise it."</p>
<p>There followed that night a council of the captains, and, since
they were still nominally regarded as in the service of Facino's
widow, the Duchess herself attended it; and since the fortunes of
the legitimate ruler of Montferrat was one of the issues, the
Marquis Gian Giacomo and his sister were also invited to be
present.</p>
<p>The Duke, at the head of the long table, with the Duchess on his
right and Bellarion on his left, made known the intention to
declare war immediately upon the Regent of Montferrat, upon two
grounds: his occupation of the Milanese stronghold and lands of
Vercelli, and his usurpation of the regency beyond the Marquis Gian
Giacomo's attainment of full age. Of his captains now he desired an
account of the means at their disposal, and afterwards a decision
of those to be employed in the undertaking.</p>
<p>Carmagnola came prepared with a computation of the probable
forces which Theodore could levy, and they were considerable&mdash;not
less than five thousand men. The necessary force to deal with him
was next debated, having regard also to certain other enterprises
to which Milan was elsewhere committed. At length this was fixed by
Bellarion. It was to consist of the Germans under Koenigshofen,
Stoffel's Swiss, Giasone Trotta's Italian mercenaries, and
Marsilio's condotta, amounting in all to some seven thousand men.
That would leave free for other eventualities the condottas of
Valperga and of Carmagnola, with whom were Ercole Belluno and
Ugolino da Tenda.</p>
<p>Against this, and on the plea that the Duke might require the
service of the Prince of Valsassina at home, Carmagnola begged that
the enterprise against Montferrat should be confided to his
leadership, his own condotta taking the place of Bellarion's, but
all else remaining as Bellarion disposed.</p>
<p>The Duke, showing in his pale face no sign of his surprise at
this request, looked from Carmagnola to Bellarion, appearing to
ponder, what time the Princess Valeria held her breath.</p>
<p>At length the Duke spoke. "Have you anything to say to that,
Valsassina?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, if your highness is content. You will remember that
Theodore of Montferrat is one of the most skilful captains of the
day, and if this business is not to drag on unduly&mdash;indeed, if it
is to be brought to a successful issue&mdash;you would do well to send
your best against him."</p>
<p>A sly smile broke upon that sinisterly placid countenance.</p>
<p>"By which you mean yourself."</p>
<p>"For my part," said Koenigshofen, "I do not willingly march
under another."</p>
<p>"And for mine," said Stoffel, "whilst Bellarion lives I do not
march under another at all."</p>
<p>The Duke looked at Carmagnola. "You hear, sir?"</p>
<p>Carmagnola flushed uncomfortably. "I had set my heart upon the
enterprise, Lord Duke."</p>
<p>The Princess Valeria interposed. "By your leave, highness, does
my vote count for anything in this matter?"</p>
<p>"Assuredly, Madonna. Your own and your brother's."</p>
<p>"Then, Lord Duke, my vote, indeed my prayer, is that my Lord of
Carmagnola be given the command."</p>
<p>The Duchess raised her long eyes to look at her in wonder.</p>
<p>Bellarion sat inscrutable.</p>
<p>The request wounded without surprising him. He knew her
unconquerable mistrust of him. He had hoped in the end, which was
now approaching, to prove to her its cruel injustice. But if
occasion for that were denied him it would be no great matter. What
signified was that her own aims should be accomplished, and, after
all, they were not beyond the strength and skill of Carmagnola, who
had his talents as a leader when all was said.</p>
<p>The Duke's lack-lustre eyes were steadily upon Valeria. He spoke
after a pause.</p>
<p>"Almost you imply a doubt of the Prince of Valsassina's
capacity."</p>
<p>"Not of his capacity. Oh, not of that!"</p>
<p>"Of what, then?"</p>
<p>The question troubled her...She looked at her brother, and her
brother answered for her.</p>
<p>"My sister remembers that the Prince of Valsassina was once the
Marquis Theodore's friend."</p>
<p>"Was he so? When was that?" The Duke looked at Bellarion, but it
was Gian Giacomo who answered the question.</p>
<p>"When, in alliance with him, he placed him in possession of
Vercelli and Genoa."</p>
<p>"The alliance was the Lord Facino's, not Valsassina's. Bellarion
served under him. But so also did Carmagnola. Where is the
difference between them?"</p>
<p>"My Lord of Carmagnola acted then with a view to my brother's
ultimate service," the Princess answered. "If he was a party to the
Marquis Theodore's occupation of Vercelli, it was only so that in
that act the Marquis might provide a cause for the action that is
now proposed against him by the Duke of Milan."</p>
<p>Bellarion laughed softly at the light he suddenly perceived.</p>
<p>"Do you mock that statement, sir?" Carmagnola challenged him.
"Do you dare to say what was in my mind at the time?"</p>
<p>"I have honoured you for directness, Carmagnola. But it seems
you can be subtle too."</p>
<p>"Subtle!" Carmagnola flushed indignantly. "In what have I been
subtle?"</p>
<p>"In the spirit in which you favoured Theodore's occupation of
Vercelli," said Bellarion, and so left him gaping foolishly. "What
else did you think I had in mind?" He smiled almost ingeniously
into the other's face.</p>
<p>The Duke rapped the table. "Sirs, sirs! We wander. And there is
this matter to solve."</p>
<p>Bellarion answered him.</p>
<p>"Here, then, is a solution your highness may be disposed to
adopt. Instead of Valperga and his troops, I take with me
Carmagnola and his own condotta, which is of a similar strength
and, like Valpergas', mainly horse. Thus we march together and
share the enterprise."</p>
<p>"But unless Bellarion commands it, Lord Duke, your highness will
graciously consider sending another condotta in the place of mine,"
said Koenigshofen; and Stoffel was about to add his own voice to
that, when the Duke, losing patience, broke in:</p>
<p>"Peace! Peace! I am Duke of Milan, and I give orders here. You
are summoned to advise, not to browbeat me and say what you will
and will not do. Let it be done as Valsassina says, since
Carmagnola has set his heart upon being in the campaign. But
Valsassina leads the enterprise. The matter is closed on that. You
have leave to go."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-08" id="ch-3-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII. CARMAGNOLA'S
BRIDGES</h2>
<p>Dissensions at the very outset between Carmagnola and Bellarion
protracted by some days the preparations for the departure of the
army. This enabled Theodore of Montferrat fully to make his
dispositions for Resistance, to pack the granaries of Vercelli and
otherwise victual it for a siege, and to increase the strong body
of troops already under his hand, with which he threw himself into
the menaced city. Further, by working furiously during those
October days, he was enabled to strengthen his bastions and throw
up fresh earth-works from which to shatter the onslaught when it
should come.</p>
<p>Upon these very circumstances, of which Bellarion and his
captains were duly informed, followed fresh dissensions. Carmagnola
advocated that operations should be begun by the reduction of
Mortara, which was being held for Theodore, and which if not seized
before they marched upon Verceili would constitute, he argued, a
menace upon their rear. Bellarion's view was that the menace was
not sufficiently serious to merit attention; that whilst they were
reducing it Theodore would further be strengthening himself at
Verceili, and that, in short, they should march straight upon
Verceili, depending that when they forced it to a capitulation
Mortara would thereby be scared into immediate surrender.</p>
<p>Of the captains some held one view, some the other.
Koenigshofen, Stoffel, and Trotta took sides with Bellarion. Ercole
Belluno, who commanded the foot in Carmagnola's condotta, took
sides with his leader, as did also Ugolino da Tenda, who captained
a thousand horse. Yet Bellarion would have overruled them, but for
the Princess Valeria, who, with her brother, entered now into all
their councils. These were on the side of Carmagnola. Hence a
compromise was effected. A detachment under Koenigshofen, including
Trotta's troops, was to go against Mortara, to cover the rear of
the main army proceeding to Verceili.</p>
<p>To Verceili that army, now not more than some four thousand
strong, yet strong enough, in Bellarion's view, for the task in
hand, made at last a speedy advance. But at Borgo Vercelli they
were brought to a halt by the fact that Theodore had blown up the
bridge over the Sesia, leaving that broad, deep, swift-flowing
river between the enemy and the city which was their goal.</p>
<p>At Carpignano, twenty miles higher up, there was a bridge which,
Bellarion ascertained, had been left standing. He announced that
they must avail themselves of that.</p>
<p>"Twenty miles there and twenty miles back!" snorted Carmagnola.
"It is too much. A weariness and a labour."</p>
<p>"I'll not dispute it. But the alternative is to go by way of
Casale, which is even farther."</p>
<p>"The alternative," Carmagnola answered, "is to bridge the Sesia
and the Cerva above their junction, where the streams are narrower.
Our lines of communication with the army at Mortara should be as
short as possible."</p>
<p>"You begin to perceive one of the disadvantages of having left
that army at Mortara."</p>
<p>"It is no disadvantage if we make proper provision."</p>
<p>"And you think that your bridges will afford that provision?"
Bellarion's manner was almost supercilious. Carmagnola resented
it.</p>
<p>"I can do more. I can foresee what will happen. Sometimes,
Francesco, you leave me wondering where you learnt the art of war
or how ever you came to engage in it."</p>
<p>They held their discussion in the kitchen of a peasant's house
which, for the Princess Valeria's sake, they had invaded. And the
Princess and her brother were its only witnesses. When Carmagnola
now moved wrathfully in great strides about the dingy chamber,
stamping upon the earthen floor and waving his arms as he begun to
storm, one of those witnesses became an actor to calm him. The
Princess Valeria laid a hand upon one of those waving arms in its
gorgeous sleeve of gold-embroidered scarlet.</p>
<p>"Do not heed his taunts, Messer Carmagnola. You have my utter
trust and confidence. It is my wish that you should build your
bridges."</p>
<p>Bellarion tilted his chin to look at her, between anger and
amusement.</p>
<p>"If you are to take command, highness, I'll say no more." He
bowed and went out.</p>
<p>"One of these days I shall give that upstart dog a lesson in
good manners," said Carmagnola between his teeth.</p>
<p>The Princess shook her head.</p>
<p>"It is not his manners, sir, that trouble me, but his possible
aims. If I could trust him..."</p>
<p>"If you could trust his loyalty, you should still mistrust his
skill."</p>
<p>"Yet he has won great repute as a soldier," put in Gian Giacomo,
who instinctively disliked the thrasonical airs of the swaggering
Carmagnola and disliked still more his fawning manner towards
Valeria.</p>
<p>"He has been fortunate," Carmagnola answered, "and his good
fortune has gone to his head."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bellarion went straight from that interview to
dispatch Werner von Stoffel with five hundred arbalisters and six
hundred horse to Carpignano.</p>
<p>There was a fresh breeze with Carmagnola when the latter
discovered this. He demanded to know why it should have been done
without previous consultation with himself and the Princess, and
Valeria was at his side when he asked the question.</p>
<p>Bellarion's answer was a very full one.</p>
<p>"You will be a week building your bridges. In that time it may
occur to Theodore to do what he should have done already: to
destroy the bridge at Carpignano."</p>
<p>"And what do I care about the bridge at Carpignano when I shall
have bridges of my own here?"</p>
<p>"When you have bridges of your own here, you need not care. But
I have a notion that it will be longer than you think before you
have these bridges and that we may have to go by way of Carpignano
in the end."</p>
<p>"I shall have my bridges in a week," said Carmagnola.</p>
<p>Bellarion smiled. "When you have them, and when you have put two
thousand men across to hold them, I'll bid Stoffel return from
Carpignano."</p>
<p>"But in the meantime..."</p>
<p>Bellarion interrupted him, and suddenly he was very stern.</p>
<p>"In the meantime you will remember that I command. Though I may
choose to humour you and her highness, as the shortest way to
convince you of error, yet I do not undertake to obey you against
my better judgment."</p>
<p>"By God, Bellarion!" Carmagnola swore at him. "I'll not have you
gay with me. You'll measure your words, or else you'll eat
them."</p>
<p>Very coldly Bellarion looked at him and observed Valeria's white
restraining hand, which again was upon Carmagnola's sleeve.</p>
<p>"At the moment I have a task in hand to which I belong entirely.
While it is doing, if you forget that I command, I shall remove you
from the army."</p>
<p>He left the swaggerer fuming.</p>
<p>"Only my regard for you, Madonna, restrains me," he assured the
Princess. "He takes that tone when he should remember that if it
came to blows between us the majority of the men here would be upon
my side now that he has sent nearly all his own away." He clenched
his hands in anger. "Yet for your sake, lady, I must suffer it.
There can be no quarrel between his men and mine until we have
placed you and your brother in possession of Montferrat."</p>
<p>These and other such professions of staunch selfless loyalty
touched her deeply; and in the days that followed, whilst the
troopers toiling like woodmen were felling trees and building the
bridges above the junction of the rivers, Carmagnola and Valeria
were constantly together.</p>
<p>She was driven now to the discomfort of living under canvas,
sharing the camp life of these rude men of war, and Carmagnola did
all in his power to mitigate for her the hardships it entailed,
hardships which she bore with a high, gay courage. She would go
with him daily to watch the half-naked labourers in the river
bundling together whole trees as if they were mere twigs, to serve
as pontoons. And daily he gave her cause to admire his skill, his
ingenuity and his military capacity. That Bellarion should have
sneered at this was but another proof of Bellarion's worthlessness.
Either he could not understand it, or else, of treacherous intent,
he desired to deprive her of its fruits.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Carmagnola beglamoured her with talk of actions past,
in all of which he played ever the heroic part. The eyes of her
mind were dazzled by the pictures his words drew for her. Now she
beheld him leading a knightly charge that shattered an enemy host
into shards; now she saw him at the head of an escalade,
indomitably climbing enemy walls under a hail of stones and
scalding pitch; now she saw him in counsel, wisely planning the
means by which victory might be snatched from overwhelming
opposition.</p>
<p>One day when he spoke of these things, as they sat alone
watching the men who swarmed like ants about the building of his
bridge, he touched a closer note.</p>
<p>"Yet of all the enterprises to which I have set those rude
soldier hands, none has so warmed me as this, for none has been
worthier a man's endeavour. It will be a glorious day for me when
we set you in your place at Casale. A glorious day, and yet a
bitter."</p>
<p>"A bitter?" Her great dark eyes turned on him in question.</p>
<p>His countenance clouded, his own glance fell away. "Will it not
be bitter for me to know this service at an end; to know that I
must go my ways; resume a mercenary's life, and do for hire that
which I now do out of...enthusiasm and love."</p>
<p>She shifted her own glance, embarrassed a little.</p>
<p>"Surely you do yourself less than justice. There is great honour
and fame in store for you, my lord."</p>
<p>"Honour and fame!" He laughed. "I would gladly leave those to
tricksters like Bellarion, who rise to them so easily because no
scruples ever deter them. Honour and fame! Let who will have those
so that I may serve where my heart bids me."</p>
<p>Boldly now his hand sought hers. She let it lie in his. Above
those pensive mysterious eyes her fine brows were knit.</p>
<p>"Ay," she breathed, "that is the great service of life. That is
the only worthy service&mdash;as the heart bids."</p>
<p>His second hand came to recruit the first. Lying almost at her
feet, he swung round on his side upon the green earth, looking up
at her in a sort of ecstasy. "You think that too! You help me to
self-contempt, Madonna."</p>
<p>"To self-contempt? It is the only contempt that you will ever
know. But why should you know that?"</p>
<p>"Because all my life, until this moment, I have served for hire.
Because if this adventure had not come to me by God's grace, in
such worthless endeavours would my life continue. Now&mdash;now that I
know the opinion in which you must hold such service&mdash;it is over
and done for me. When I shall have served you to your goal I shall
have performed my last."</p>
<p>There fell a long pause between them. At last: "When my brother
is crowned in Casale he will need a servant such as you, Messer
Carmagnola."</p>
<p>"Ay, but shall you, Madonna? Shall you?" She looked at him
wistfully, smiling a little. He was very handsome, very splendid
and very brave, a knight to win a lady's trust&mdash;and she was a very
lonely friendless lady, in sore need of a stout arm and a gallant
heart to help her through the trials of this life.</p>
<p>The tapering fingers of her disengaged hand descended gently
upon his golden head.</p>
<p>"Shall I not?" she asked with a little tremulous laugh. "Shall I
not?"</p>
<p>"Why, then, Madonna, if you will accept my service it shall be
yours for as long as I endure. It shall never be another's.
Valeria! My Valeria!"</p>
<p>That hand upon his head, over-heating its very indifferent
contents, drove him now to an excessive precipitancy.</p>
<p>He carried the hand he held almost fiercely to his lips. It was
withdrawn, gently but firmly, as was its fellow. His kiss and the
bold use of her name scared her a little. "Carmagnola, my
friend..."</p>
<p>"Your friend, and more than your friend, Madonna."</p>
<p>"Why, how much more can there be than that?"</p>
<p>"All that a man may be to a woman, my Valeria. I am your knight.
I ever have been since that day in the lists at Milan when you
bestowed the palm on me. I joy in this battle that is to be fought
for you. I would joy in death for you if it were needed to prove my
worship!"</p>
<p>"How glibly you say these things! There will have been queens in
other lists in which you have borne off the palm. Have you talked
so to them?"</p>
<p>"O cruelty!" he cried out like a man in pain. "That you should
say this to me! I am swooning at your feet, Valeria, you wonder of
the world!"</p>
<p>"My nose, sir, is too long for that!" She mocked him, but with
an underlying tenderness, and tenderness there was, too, in her
moist eyes. "You are a whirlwind in your wooing as in the lists.
You are reckless, sir."</p>
<p>"Is it a fault? A soldier's fault, then. But I'll be patient, if
you bid me. I'll be whatsoever you bid me, Valeria. But when we
come to Casale..."</p>
<p>He paused for words, and she took advantage of that pause to
check him.</p>
<p>"It is unlucky to plan upon something not yet achieved, sir.
Wait...wait until that time arrives."</p>
<p>"And then?" he asked her breathlessly. "And then?"</p>
<p>"Have I not said that to plan is unlucky?"</p>
<p>Boldly he read the converse of that statement. "I'll not tempt
fortune, then. I dare not. I will be patient, Valeria." But he let
it appear that his confidence was firm, and she added nothing now
to shake it.</p>
<p>And so in ardent wooing whilst he waited for his bridge,
Carmagnola spent most of the time that he was not engaged in
directing the construction of it. Bellarion in those days sulked
like Achilles in his tent, with a copy of Vegetius, which he had
brought from Milan in his baggage.</p>
<p>The bridges took not a week, but eleven days to build. At last,
however, on the eve of All Saints, as Fra Serafino tells us,
Carmagnola, accompanied by Valeria and her brother, bore word
himself to Bellarion that the bridges were ready and that a party
of fifty of his men were encamped on the peninsula between the
rivers. He came to demand that Bellarion should so dispose that the
army should begin to cross at dawn. "That," said Bellarion,
"assumes that your bridges endure until dawn."</p>
<p>He was standing, where he had risen to receive his visitors, in
the middle of his roomy pavilion, which was lighted by a group of
three lanterns hung at the height of his head on the tent-pole. The
book in which he had been reading was closed upon his
fore-finger.</p>
<p>"Endure until dawn?" Carmagnola was annoyed by the suggestion.
"And why should they not endure?"</p>
<p>Bellarion's remark had been imprudent. Still more imprudent was
the laugh he now uttered.</p>
<p>"Ask yourself who should destroy them," he said. "In your place
it is what I should have asked myself before I went to the trouble
of building them."</p>
<p>"How should Theodore know of it, shut up as he is in Vercelli,
eight miles away?"</p>
<p>Part of his question was answered on the instant by a demoniacal
uproar from the strip of land across the water. Cries of rage and
terror, shouts of encouragement and command, the sound of blows,
the clash of steel, and all the unmistakable din of conflict rose
fiercely upon the deepening gloom.</p>
<p>"He knows, it seems," said Bellarion, and again he laughed.</p>
<p>Carmagnola stood a moment, clenching and unclenching his hands,
his face white with rage. Then he spun round where he stood, and
with an inarticulate cry dashed from the tent.</p>
<p>One withering glance Valeria flashed into Bellarion's
sardonically amused countenance, then, summoning her brother, she
followed Carmagnola.</p>
<p>Bellarion set down his book upon the table by the tent-pole,
took up a cloak, and followed them at leisure through the screen of
bare trees behind which his pavilion had been pitched, and along
the high bank of the swirling river towards the head of
Carmagnola's bridge.</p>
<p>There, as he expected, he found them, scarcely visible in the
gloom, and with them a knot of men-at-arms and a half-dozen
stragglers, all that had escaped of the party that Carmagnola had
sent across an hour ago. The others had been surrounded and
captured. Last of all to win across, arriving just as Bellarion
reached the spot, was Belluno, who had commanded them, an excitable
Neopolitan who leapt up the bank from the bridge ranting by all the
patrons of Naples that they had been betrayed.</p>
<p>Over the river came a sound of tramping feet. Dimly reflected in
the water, they could see the forms of men who were otherwise
invisible on the farther bank, and presently came a sound of axes
on timber.</p>
<p>"There goes your bridge, Francesco," said Bellarion, and for the
third time he laughed.</p>
<p>"Do you mock me, damn you!" Carmagnola raged at him, and then
raised his voice to roar for arbalisters. Three or four of the men
went off vociferously at a run to fetch them, whilst Valeria turned
suddenly upon Bellarion, whose tall cloaked figure stood beside
her.</p>
<p>"Why do you laugh?" Her voice, sharp with disdain, resentment
and suspicion, silenced all there that they might hear his
answer.</p>
<p>"I am human, I suppose, and, therefore, not entirely without
malice."</p>
<p>"Is that all your reason? Is your malice so deep that you can
laugh at an enemy advantage which may wreck the labour of days?"
And then, with increasing sharpness and increasing accusation: "You
knew!" she cried. "You knew that the bridges would be destroyed
tonight. Yourself, you said so. How did you know? How did you
know?"</p>
<p>"What are you implying, Madonna?" cried Carmagnola, aghast. For
all his hostility towards Bellarion, he was very far from ready to
believe that he played a double game.</p>
<p>"That I have no wits," said Bellarion, quietly scornful.</p>
<p>And now the impetuous Belluno, smarting under his own particular
misadventure and near escape, must needs cut in.</p>
<p>"Madonna is implying more than that. She is implying that you've
sold us to Theodore of Montferrat."</p>
<p>"Are you implying it too, Belluno?" His tone had changed. There
was now in his voice a note that the Princess had never heard? a
note that made Belluno's blood run cold. "Speak out, man! Though I
give licence for innuendo to a lady, I require clear speech from
every man. So let us have this thing quite plainly."</p>
<p>Belluno was brave and obstinate. He conquered his fear of
Bellarion sufficiently to make a show of standing his ground.</p>
<p>"It is clear," he answered sullenly, "that we have been
betrayed."</p>
<p>"How is it clear, you fool?" Bellarion shifted again from cold
wrath with an insubordinate inferior to argument with a fellow man.
"Are you so inept at the trade by which you live that you can
conceive of a soldier in the Marquis Theodore's position neglecting
to throw out scouts to watch the enemy and report movements? Are
you so much a fool as that? If so, I shall have to think of
replacing you in your command."</p>
<p>Carmagnola interposed aggressively; and this partly to protect
Belluno, who was one of his own lieutenants, and partly because the
sneer at the fellow's lack of military foresight was a reflection
upon Carmagnola himself.</p>
<p>"Do you pretend that you foresaw this action of Theodore's?"</p>
<p>"I pretend that any but a fool must have foreseen it. It is
precisely what any soldier in his place would do: allow you to
waste time, material and energy on building bridges, and then
promptly destroy them for you."</p>
<p>"Why, then, did you not say this ten days ago?"</p>
<p>"Why?" Bellarion's voice sounded amused. His face they could not
see. "Because I never spend myself in argument with those who learn
only by experience."</p>
<p>Again the Princess intervened. "Is that the best reason you can
give? You allowed time, material and energy, and now even a
detachment of men, to be wasted, merely that you might prove this
folly to my Lord of Carmagnola? Is that what you ask us to
believe?"</p>
<p>"He thinks us credulous, by God!" swore Carmagnola. Bellarion
kept his patience.</p>
<p>"I had another reason, a military one, with which it seems that
I must shame your wits. To move the whole army from here to
Carpignano would have taken me at least two days, perhaps three. A
mounted detachment from Vercelli to destroy the bridge could reach
Carpignano in a few hours, and once it was seen that I moved my
army thither that detachment would have been instantly dispatched.
It was a movement I feared in any case, until your bridge-building
operations here deceived Theodore into believing that I had no
thought of Carpignano. That is why I allowed them to continue.
Though your bridges could never serve the purpose for which you
built them, they could excellently serve to disguise my own
intentions of crossing at Carpignano, Tomorrow, when the army
begins to move thither, that detachment of Theodore's will most
certainly be sent to destroy the bridge. But it will find it held
by a thousand men under Stoffel, and the probable capture of that
detachment will compensate for the loss of men you have suffered
tonight."</p>
<p>There was a moment's utter silence when he had done, a silence
of defeat and confusion. Then came an applauding splutter of
laughter from the group of men and officers who stood about.</p>
<p>It was cut short by a loud crash from across the stream, and,
thereafter, with a groaning and rending of timbers, a gurgling of
swelling, momentarily arrested waters, and finally a noise like a
thunderclap, the wrecked bridge, swinging out into the stream,
snapped from the logs that held it to the Northern shore.</p>
<p>"There it goes, Carmagnola," said Bellarion. "But you no longer
need bewail your labours. They have served my purpose." He cast his
cloak more tightly about him, wished them good night almost gaily,
and went striding away towards his pavilion.</p>
<p>Carmagnola, crestfallen, swallowing his chagrin as best he
could, stood there in silence beside the equally silenced
Princess.</p>
<p>Belluno swore softly, and vented a laugh of some little
bitterness.</p>
<p>"He's deep, always deep, by Saint Januarius! Never does he do
the thing he seems to do. Never does he aim where he looks."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-09" id="ch-3-09"></a>CHAPTER IX. VERCELLI</h2>
<p>A letter survives which the Prince of Valsassina wrote some
little time after these events to Duke Filippo Maria, in which
occurs the following criticism of the captains of his day: "They
are stout fellows and great fighters, but rude, unlettered and
lacking culture. Their minds are fertile, vigorous soil, but
unbroken by the plough of learning, so that the seeds of knowledge
with which they are all too sparsely sown find little roots
there."</p>
<p>At Carpignano, when they came there three days after breaking
camp below, they found that all had fallen out as Bellarion
calculated. A detachment of horse, one hundred strong, had been
sent in haste with the necessary implements to destroy the bridge.
That detachment Stoffel had surrounded, captured, disarmed and
disbanded.</p>
<p>They crossed, and after another three days' marching down the
right bank of the Sesia they crossed the Cervo just above Quinto,
where Bellarion took up his quarters in the little castle owned
there by the Lord Girolamo Prato, who was with Theodore in
Vercelli.</p>
<p>Here, too, were housed the Princess and her brother and the Lord
of Carmagnola, the latter by now recovered from his humiliation in
the matter of his bridges to a state of normal self-complacency and
arrogance.</p>
<p>An eighteenth-century French writer on tactics, M. Dvinequi, in
his <i>L'Art Militaire au Moyen Age</i>, in the course of a lengthy
comparison between the methods of Bellarion Cane and the almost
equally famous Sir John Hawkwood, offers some strong adverse
criticisms upon Bellarion's dispositions in the case of this siege
of Vercelli. He considers that as a necessary measure of
preparation Bellarion when at Quinto should have thrown bridges
across the Sesia above and below the city, so as to maintain
unbroken his lines of circumvallation, instead of contenting
himself with ferrying a force across to guard the eastern
approaches. This force being cut off by the river, could, says M.
Devinequi, neither be supported at need, nor afford support.</p>
<p>What the distinguished French writer has missed is the fact
that, once engaged upon it, Bellarion was as little in earnest
about the siege of Vercelli as he was about Carmagnola's bridges.
The one as much as the other was no more than a strategic
demonstration. From the outset&mdash;that is to say from the time when
arriving at Quinto he beheld the strong earthworks Theodore had
thrown up&mdash;he realized that the place was not easily to be carried
by assult, and it was within his knowledge that it was too well
victualled to succumb to hunger save after a siege more protracted
than he himself was prepared to impose upon it.</p>
<p>But there was Carmagnola, swaggering and thrasonical in spite of
all that had gone, and there was the Princess Valeria supporting
the handsome condottiero with her confidence. And Carmagnola, not
content that Bellarion should girdle the city, arguing, reasonably
enough, that months would be entailed in bringing Theodore to
surrender from hunger, was loud and insistent in his demands that
the place be assaulted. Once again, as in the case of the bridges,
Bellarion yielded to the other's overbearing insistence, went even
the length of inviting him to plan and conduct the assaults. Three
of these were delivered, and all three repulsed with ease by an
enemy that appeared to Bellarion to be uncannily prescient. After
the third repulse, the same suspicion occurred to Carmagnola, and
he expressed it; not, however, to Bellarion, as he should have
done, but to the Princess.</p>
<p>"You mean," she said, "that someone on our side is conveying
information to Theodore of our intentions?"</p>
<p>They were alone together in the armoury of the castle of Quinto,
whose painted windows overlooked the river. It was normally a bare
room with stone walls and a vaulted white ceiling up which crawled
a troop of the rampant lions of the Prati crudely frescoed in a
dingy red. Bellarion had brought to it some furnishings that made
it habitable, and so it became the room they chiefly used.</p>
<p>The Princess sat by the table, in a great chair of painted
leather faded but comfortable. She was wrapped in a long blue gown
that was lined with lynx fur against the chill weather which had
set in. Carmagnola, big and gaudy in a suit of the colour of
sulphur, his tunic reversed with black fur, his powerful yet
shapely legs booted to the knee, strode to and fro across the room
in his excitement.</p>
<p>"It is what I begin to fear," he answered her, and resumed his
pacing. A silence followed, and remained unbroken until he went to
plant himself, his feet wide, his hands behind him, before the logs
that blazed in the cavernous fireplace.</p>
<p>She looked up and met his glance. "You know what I am thinking,"
he said. "I am wondering whether you may not be right, after all,
in your suspicions."</p>
<p>Gently she shook her head. "I dismissed them on that night when
your bridges were destroyed. His vindication was so complete, what
followed proved him so right, that I could suspect him no longer.
He is just a mercenary fellow, fighting for the hand that pays. I
trust him now, because he must know that he can win more by loyalty
than by treachery."</p>
<p>"Ay," he agreed, "you are right, my Princess. You are always
right."</p>
<p>"I was not right in my suspicions of him. So think no more of
those." Standing as he did, he was completely screening the fire
from her.</p>
<p>She rose and crossed to it, holding out her hands to the blaze,
when he made room for her beside him.</p>
<p>"I am chilled," she said. "As much, I think, by our want of
progress as by these November winds."</p>
<p>"Nay, but take heart, Valeria," he bade her. "The one will last
no longer than the other. Spring will follow in the world and in
your soul."</p>
<p>She looked up at him and found him good to look upon, so big and
strong, so handsome and so confident.</p>
<p>"It is heartening to have such a man as you for company in such
days."</p>
<p>He took her in his arms, a masterful, irresistible fellow.</p>
<p>"With such a woman as you beside me, Valeria, I could conquer
the world."</p>
<p>A dry voice broke in upon that rapture:</p>
<p>"You might make a beginning by conquering Vercelli."</p>
<p>Starting guiltily apart, they met the mocking eyes of Bellarion,
who entered. He came forward easily, as handsome in his way as
Carmagnola, but cast in a finer, statelier mould. "I should be
grateful to you, Francesco, and so would her highness, if you would
accomplish that. The world can wait until afterwards."</p>
<p>And Carmagnola, to cover his confusion and Valeria's, plunged
headlong into contention.</p>
<p>"I'd reduce Vercelli tomorrow if I had my way."</p>
<p>"Who hinders you?"</p>
<p>"You do. There was that night attack..."</p>
<p>"Oh, that!" said Bellarion. "Do you bring that up again? Will
you never take my word for anything, I wonder? It is foredoomed to
failure."</p>
<p>"Not if conducted as I would have it." He came forward to the
table, swaying from the hips in his swaggering walk. He put his
finger on the map that was spread there. "If a false attack were
made here, on the east, between the city and the river, so as to
draw the besieged, a bold simultaneous attack on the west might
carry the walls."</p>
<p>"It might," said Bellarion slowly, and fell to considering.
"This is a new thought of yours, this false attack. It has its
merits."</p>
<p>"You approve me for once! What condescension!"</p>
<p>Bellarion ignored the interruption. "It also has its dangers.
The party making the feinte&mdash;and it will need to be a strong one,
or its real purpose will be guessed&mdash;might easily be thrust into
the river by a determined sally."</p>
<p>"It will not come to that," Carmagnola answered quickly.</p>
<p>"You cannot say so much."</p>
<p>"Why not? The feinte will draw the besieged in that direction,
but before they can sally they will be recalled by the real attack
striking on the other side."</p>
<p>Bellarion pondered again, but finally shook his head. "I have
said that it has its merits, and it tempts me. But I will not take
the risk."</p>
<p>"The risk of what?" Carmagnola was being exasperated by that
quiet, determined opposition. "God's death! Take charge of the
feinte yourself, if you wish. I'll lead the storm party, and, so
that you do your part, I'll answer for it that I am inside the town
before daybreak and that Theodore will be in my hands."</p>
<p>Valeria had remained with her shoulders to them, facing the
fire. Bellarion's entrance, discovering her in Carmagnola's arms,
had covered her with confusion, filled her with a vexation not only
against himself but against Carmagnola also. From this there was no
recovery, until Carmagnola's words came now to promise a conclusion
of their troubles far speedier than any she had dared to hope.</p>
<p>"You'll answer for it?" said Bellarion. "And if you fail?"</p>
<p>"I will not fail. You say yourself that it is soundly
planned."</p>
<p>"Did I say so much? Surely not. To be frank, I am more afraid of
Theodore of Montferrat than of any captain I've yet opposed."</p>
<p>"Afraid!" said Carmagnola, and sneered.</p>
<p>"Afraid," Bellarion repeated quietly. "I don't charge like a
bull. I like to know exactly where I am going."</p>
<p>"In this case, I have told you."</p>
<p>Valeria slowly crossed to them. "Make the endeavour, at least,
Lord Prince," she begged him.</p>
<p>He looked from one to the other of them. "Between you, you
distract me a little. And you do not learn, which is really sad.
Well, have your way, Francesco. The adventure may succeed. But if
it fails do not again attempt to persuade me to any course through
which I do not clearly see my way."</p>
<p>Valeria in her thanks was nearer to friendliness than he had
ever known her since that last night at Casale. Those thanks he
received with a certain chill austerity.</p>
<p>It was to be Carmagnola's enterprise, and he left it to
Carmagnola to make all the dispositions. The attempt was planned
for the following night. It was to take place precisely at
midnight, which at that time of year was the seventh hour, and the
signal for launching the false attack was to be taken from the
clock on San Vittore, one of the few clocks in Italy at that date
to strike the hour. After an interval sufficient to allow the
defenders to engage on that side, Carmagnola would open the real
attack.</p>
<p>Empanoplied in his armour and carrying his peaked helm in the
crook of his arm, Carmagnola went to ask of the Princess a blessing
on his enterprise. She broke into expressions of gratitude.</p>
<p>"Do not thank me yet," he said. "Before morning, God helping me,
I shall lay the State of Montferrat at your feet. Then I shall ask
your thanks."</p>
<p>She flushed under his ardent gaze. "I shall pray for you," she
promised him very fervently, and laid a hand upon his steel
brassard. He bore it to his lips, bowed stiffly, and clanked out of
the room.</p>
<p>Bellarion did not come to seek her. Lightly armed, with no more
than back and breast and a steel cap on his head, he led out his
men through the night, making a wide detour so that their movements
should not be heard in Vercelli. Since mobility was of the first
importance, he took with him only a body of some eight hundred
horse. They filed along by the river, to the east of the city,
which loomed there, a vast black shadow against the faintly
irradiated sky. They took up their station, dismounted, unlimbered
the scaling ladders which they had brought for the purposes of
their demonstration, and waited.</p>
<p>They were, as Bellarion calculated, close upon the appointed
hour, when at one point of the line there was a sudden commotion. A
man had been caught who had come prowling forward, and who, upon
being seized, demanded to be taken at once before their leader.</p>
<p>Roughly they did as he required of them. And there in the dark,
for they dared kindle no betraying light, Bellarion learnt that
this was a loyal subject of the Duke of Milan, who had slipped out
of the city to inform them that the Marquis Theodore was advised of
their attack and ready to meet it.</p>
<p>Bellarion swore profusely, a rare thing in him who seldom
allowed himself to be mastered by his temper. If Theodore was
forewarned, who could say what counter measures Theodore had not
prepared? This came of lending ear to that bellowing calf
Carmagnola!</p>
<p>Fiercely he gave the order to mount. There was some delay in the
dark, and whilst they were still being marshalled the bell of San
Vittore tolled the seventh hour. Some moments after that were lost
before they were spurring off to warn and withdraw Carmagnola. Even
then it was necessary to go cautiously through the dark over ground
now sodden by several days of rain.</p>
<p>Before they were half-way round, the din of combat burst upon
the air,</p>
<p>Theodore had permitted Carmagnola's men to reach and faggot the
moat, and even to plant some ladders, before moving. Then he had
thrown out his army in two wings, one from the gate to the north
and the other from a gate on the opposite side, and these two wings
had swept round to charge Carmagnola in flank and to envelop
him.</p>
<p>Two things only saved Carmagnola: in the first place, Theodore's
counter-attack was prematurely launched, before Carmagnola was
sufficiently committed; in the second, Stoffel, taking matters into
his own hands, and employing the infantry tactics advocated by
Bellarion, drew off his men and formed them up to receive the
charge he heard advancing from the north. That charge cost Theodore
a score of piked horses, and it failed to break through the
bristling human wall that rose before it in the dark. Having flung
the charge back, Stoffel formed his men quickly into the hedgehog,
embracing within it all that he could compass of Carmagnola's other
detachments, and in this formation proceeded to draw off, intent
upon saving all that he could from the disaster that was upon
them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other battle issuing from the gate on the south,
and led by Theodore himself, had crashed into Carmagnola's own
body, which Carmagnola and Belluno were vainly seeking to marshal.
They might have made an end of that detachment, which comprised the
best part of Bellarion's condotta, had not Bellarion with his eight
hundred horse at last come up to charge the enemy rear. That was
the saving stroke. Caught now between two masses, realizing that
his counter-surprise had failed, and unable in the dark to attempt
a fresh manoeuvre, Theodore ordered his trumpeters to sound the
retreat.</p>
<p>Each side accounted itself fortunate in being able to retire in
good order.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-10" id="ch-3-10"></a>CHAPTER X. THE ARREST</h2>
<p>In the armoury of the castle of Quinto, Carmagnola paced like a
caged panther, the half of his armour still clinging upon him, his
blond head still encased in the close-fitting cap of blood-red
velvet that served to protect it from the helmet. And as he paced
he ranted of treachery and other things to Valeria and Gian Giacomo
of Montferrat, to the half-dozen captains who had returned to
render with him the account of that galling failure.</p>
<p>The Princess occupied the big chair by the table, whilst her
brother leaned upon the back of it. Beyond stood ranged Ugolino da
Tenda, Ercole Belluno, Stoffel and three others, their armour
flashing in the golden light of the cluster of candles set upon the
table. Over by the hearth in another high-backed chair sat
Bellarion, still in his black corselet, his long legs in their
mud-splashed boots stretched straight before him, his head cased in
a close-fitting cap of peach-coloured velvet, disdainfully
listening to Carmagnola's furious tirade. He guessed the bitterness
in the soul of the boaster who had promised so much to achieve so
little. Therefore he was patient with him for a while. But to all
things there must be an end, and an end there was to Bellarion's
patience.</p>
<p>"Talking mends nothing, Francesco," he broke in at last.</p>
<p>"It may prevent a repetition."</p>
<p>"There can be no repetition, because there will be no second
attempt. I should never have permitted this but that you plagued me
with your insistence."</p>
<p>"And I should have succeeded had you done your part," roared
Carmagnola in fury, a vain, humiliated man reckless of where he
cast the blame for his own failure. "By God's Life, that is why
disaster overtook us. Had you delivered your own attack as was
concerted between us, Theodore must have sent a force to meet
it."</p>
<p>Bellarion remained calm under the accusation and under the eyes
of that company, all reproachful save Stoffel's. The Swiss, unable
to contain himself, laughed aloud..</p>
<p>"If the Lord Bellarion had done that, sir, you might not now be
alive. It was his change of plan and the charge he delivered upon
Theodore's rear that enabled us to extricate ourselves, and so
averted a disaster that might have been complete."</p>
<p>"And whilst you are noticing that fact," said Bellarion, "it may
also be worthy of your attention that if Stoffel had not ranged his
foot to receive the charge from Theodore's right wing, and
afterwards formed hedgehog to encircle and defend you, you would
not now be ranting here It occurs to me that an expression of
gratitude and praise for Stoffel would be not so much gracious as
proper."</p>
<p>Carmagnola glared from one to the other of them. "Ah, yes! You
support each other! We are to thank you now for a failure, which
your own action helped to bring about, Bellarion."</p>
<p>Bellarion continued, unruffled. "The accusation impugns only
your own intelligence."</p>
<p>"Does it so? Does it so? Ha! Where is this man who came, you
say, to tell you that Theodore was forewarned of the attack?"</p>
<p>Bellarion shrugged. "Do I know where he is? Do I care? Does it
matter?"</p>
<p>"A man comes to you out of the night with such a message as
that, and you don't know what has become of him!"</p>
<p>"I had other things to do than think of him. I had to think of
you, and get you out of the trap that threatened you."</p>
<p>"And I say that you would have best done that by attacking on
your own side, as we agreed."</p>
<p>"We never agreed that I should attack. But only that I should
pretend to attack. I had not the means to push home an escalade."
His suavity suddenly departed. "But it seems to me that I begin to
defend myself." He reached for his steel cap, and stood up.</p>
<p>"It becomes necessary," cried Carmagnola, who in two strides was
at his side.</p>
<p>"Only that I should defend myself from a charge of rashness in
having yielded to your insistence to attempt this night attack.
There was a chance, I thought, of success, and since the
alternative of starving the place would entail a delay of months, I
took that chance. It has missed, and so forces me to a course I've
been considering from the outset. Tomorrow I shall raise the
siege."</p>
<p>"You'll raise the siege!"</p>
<p>That ejaculation of amazement came in chorus.</p>
<p>"Not only of Vercelli, but also of Mortara."</p>
<p>"You'll raise the siege, sir?" It was Gian Giacomo who spoke
now. "And what then?"</p>
<p>"That shall be decided tomorrow in council with my officers. It
is almost daybreak. I'll wish you a good repose, Madonna, and you,
sirs." He bowed to the company and moved to the door.</p>
<p>Carmagnola put himself in his way. "Ah, but wait,
Bellarion..."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow." Bellarion's voice was hard, peremptory. "By then
your wits may be cooler and clearer. If you will all gather here at
noon, you shall learn my plans. Good night." And he went out.</p>
<p>They gathered there, not at noon on the morrow, but an hour
before that time, summoned by messages from Carmagnola, who was the
last to arrive and in prey to great excitement. Belluno, da Tenda,
Stoffel and three other officers awaited him with the Princess and
the Marquis Gian Giacomo. Bellarion was not present. He had not
been informed of the gathering, for reasons which Carmagnola's
first words made clear to all.</p>
<p>When Bellarion did arrive, punctually at noon, for the council
to which he had bidden the captains, he was surprised to find them
already seated about the table in debate and conducting this with a
vehemence which argued that matters had already gone some way.
Their voices, raised in altercation, reached him as he mounted the
short flight of stone steps, at the foot of which a half-dozen men
of Belluno's company were lounging.</p>
<p>A silence fell when he entered, and all eyes at once were turned
upon him. He smiled a greeting and closed the door. But as he
advanced he began to realize that the sudden silence was unnatural,
and ominous.</p>
<p>He came to the foot of the table, where there was a vacant
place. He looked at the faces on either side of it, and lastly at
Carmagnola seated at its head, between Valeria and Gian
Giacomo.</p>
<p>"What do you debate here?" he asked them.</p>
<p>Carmagnola answered him. His voice was hard and hostile, his
blue eyes avoided the steady glance of Bellarion's.</p>
<p>"We were about to send for you. We have discovered the traitor
who is communicating with Theodore of Montferrat, forewarning him
of our every measure, culminating in last night's business."</p>
<p>"That is something, although it comes at a time when it can no
longer greatly matter. Who is your traitor?"</p>
<p>None answered him for a long moment. Saving Stoffel, who was
flushed and smiling disdainfully, and the Princess, whose eyes were
lowered, they continued to stare at him, and he began to dislike
their stare. At last Carmagnola pushed towards him a folded square
of parchment bearing a broken seal.</p>
<p>"Read that."</p>
<p>Bellarion took it and turned it over. To his surprise he found
it superscribed "To the Magnificent Lord Bellarion Cane, Prince of
Valsassina". He frowned, and a little colour kindled in his cheeks.
He threw up his head, stern-eyed. "How?" he asked. "Who breaks the
seals of a letter addressed to me?"</p>
<p>"Read the letter," said Carmagnola peremptorily.</p>
<p>Bellarion read:</p>
<p class="letter">Dear Lord and Friend,<br>
<br>
Your fidelity to me and my concerns saved Vercelli last night from
a blow that in its consequences might have led to our surrender;
for without your forewarning we should assuredly have been taken by
surprise. I desire you to know my recognition of my debt and to
assure you again of the highest reward that it lies in my power to
bestow if you continue to serve me with the same loyal
devotion.<br>
<br>
Theodore Paleologo of Montferrat.</p>
<p>Bellarion looked up from the letter with some anger in his face,
but infinitely more contempt, and even a shade of amusement.</p>
<p>"Where was this thing manufactured?" he asked.</p>
<p>Carmagnola's answer was prompt. "In Vercelli, by the Marquis
Theodore. It is in his own hand, as Madonna here has testified, and
it is sealed with his own seal. Do you wonder that I broke it?"</p>
<p>Sheer amazement overspread Bellarion's face. He looked at the
Princess, who fleetingly looked up to answer the question in his
glance.</p>
<p>"The hand is my uncle's, sir," she said.</p>
<p>He turned over and conned the seal with its stag device Then the
amazement passed out of his face, light broke on it, and he uttered
a laugh. He turned, pulled up a stool and sat down at the table's
foot, whence he had them all under his eye.</p>
<p>"Let us proceed with method. How did this letter reach you,
Carmagnola?"</p>
<p>Carmagnola waved to Belluno, and Belluno, hostile of tone and
manner, answered the question. "A clown coming from the direction
of the city blundered into my section of the lines this morning. He
begged to be taken to you. My men naturally brought him to me. I
questioned him as to what he desired with you. He answered that he
bore a message. I asked him what message he could be bearing to you
from Vercelli. He refused to answer further, whereupon I threatened
him, and he produced this letter. Seeing its seal, I took both the
fellow and the letter to my Lord Carmagnola."</p>
<p>Bellarion, himself, completed the tale "And Carmagnola,
perceiving that seal, took it upon himself to break it, and so
discovered the contents to be what already he suspected."</p>
<p>"That is what occurred."</p>
<p>Bellarion, entirely at his ease, looked at them with amused
contempt, and finally at Carmagnola in whose face he laughed.</p>
<p>"God save you, Carmagnola! I often wonder what will be the end
of you."</p>
<p>"I am no longer wondering what will be the end of you," he was
furiously answered, which only went to increase his amusement.</p>
<p>"And you others&mdash;you were equally deceived. The letter and
Carmagnola's advocacy of my falseness and treachery were not to be
resisted?"</p>
<p>"I have not been deceived," Stoffel protested.</p>
<p>"I was not classing you with those addled heads, Stoffel."</p>
<p>"It will need more than abuse to clear you," Tenda warned him
angrily.</p>
<p>"You, too, Ugolino! And you, Madonna, and even you, Lord
Marquis! Well, well! It may need more than abuse to clear me, but
surely not more than this letter. Falsehood is in every line of it,
in the superscription, in the seal itself."</p>
<p>"How, sir?" the Princess asked him. "Do you insist that it is
forged?"</p>
<p>"I have your word that it is not. But read the letter
again."</p>
<p>He tossed it to them. "The Marquis Theodore pays your wits a
poor compliment, Carmagnola, and the sequel has justified him. Ask
yourselves this: If I were indeed Theodore's friend and ally, could
he have taken a better way than this of putting it beyond my power
to serve him further? It is plainly superscribed to me, so that
there shall be no mistake as to the person for whom it is intended,
and it bears his full signature, so that there shall be no possible
mistake on the score of whence it comes. In addition to that, he
has sealed it with his arms, so that the first person into whose
hands it falls shall be justified in ascertaining, as you did, what
Theodore of Montferrat may have occasion to write to me."</p>
<p>"It was expected that the soldiers who caught the clown would
bear him straight to you," Carmagnola countered.</p>
<p>"Was it? Is there no oddness in the fact that the clown should
walk straight into your own men, Carmagnola, on a section of the
line that does not lie directly between Vercelli and Quinto? But
why waste time even on such trifles of evidence? Read the letter
itself. Is there a single word in that which it was important to
convey to me or which would not have been conveyed otherwise if it
had been intended for any purpose other than to bring me under this
suspicion? Almost has Theodore overreached himself in his guile.
Out of his intentness to destroy me, he has revealed his true
aims."</p>
<p>"The very arguments I used with them," said Stoffel.</p>
<p>Bellarion looked in amazement at his lieutenant. "And they
failed?" he cried, incredulous.</p>
<p>"Of course they failed, you foul traitor!" Carmagnola bawled at
him. "They are ingenious, but they are obvious to a man caught as
you are."</p>
<p>"It is not I that am caught; but you that are in danger of it,
Carmagnola, in danger of being caught in the web that Theodore has
spun."</p>
<p>"To what end? To what end should he spin it? Answer that."</p>
<p>"Perhaps to set up dissensions amongst us, perhaps to remove the
only one of the captains opposed to him whom he respects."</p>
<p>"You're modest, by God!" sneered Carmagnola.</p>
<p>"And you're a purblind fool, Carmagnola!" cried Stoffel in
heat.</p>
<p>"Then are we all fools," said Belluno. "For we are all of the
same mind on this."</p>
<p>"Ay," said Bellarion sadly. "You're all of the same emptiness.
That's clear. Well, let us have in this clown, and question
him."</p>
<p>"To what purpose?"</p>
<p>"That we may wring from him his precise instructions, since the
letter does not suffice."</p>
<p>"You take too much for granted. The letter suffices fully. You
forget that it is not all the evidence against you."</p>
<p>"What? Is there more?"</p>
<p>"There is your failure last night to make the false attack you
undertook to make, and there is the intention you so rashly
proclaimed here afterwards that you would raise the seige of
Vercelli today. Why should you wish to do that if you are not
Theodore's friend, if you are not the canker-hearted traitor we now
know you to be?"</p>
<p>"If I were to tell you, you would not understand. I should
merely give you another proof that I am Theodore's ally."</p>
<p>"That is very probable," said Carmagnola with a heavy sneer.
"Fetch the guard, Ercole."</p>
<p>"What's this!" Bellarion was on his feet even as Beluno rose,
and Stoffel came up with him, laying hands on his weapons. But
Ugolino da Tenda and another captain between them overpowered him,
whilst the other two ranged themselves swiftly on Bellarion's
either hand. Bellarion looked at them, and from them again to
Carmagnola. He was lost in amazement.</p>
<p>"Are you daring to place me under arrest?"</p>
<p>"Until we deliberate what shall be done with you. We shall not
keep you waiting long."</p>
<p>"My God!" His wits worked swiftly, and he saw clearly that they
might easily work their will with him. Of the four thousand men out
there, only Stoffel's eight hundred Switzers would be on his side.
The others would follow the lead of their respective captains. The
leaders upon whom he could have depended in this pass&mdash;Koenigshofen
and Giasone Trotta were away at Mortara. Perceiving at last this
danger, hitherto entirely unsuspected, he turned now to the
Princess.</p>
<p>"Madonna," he said, "it is you whom I serve. Once before you
suspected me, in the matter of Carmagnola's bridges, and the sequel
proved you wrong."</p>
<p>Slowly she raised her eyes to look at him fully for the first
time since he had joined that board. They were very sorrowful and
her pallor was deathly.</p>
<p>"There are other matters, sir, besides that, which I remember.
There is the death of Enzo Spigno, for one."</p>
<p>He recoiled as if she had struck him. "Spigno!" he echoed, and
uttered a queer little laugh. "So it is Spigno who rises from his
grave for vengeance?"</p>
<p>"Not for vengeance, sir. For justice. There would be that if
there were not the matter that Messer Carmagnola has urged to
convict you."</p>
<p>"To convict me! Am I, then, convicted without trial?"</p>
<p>None answered him; and in the pause that followed the
men-at-arms summoned by Belluno clanked in and, at a sign from
Carmagnola, closed about Bellarion. There were four of them. One of
the captains deprived him of his dagger, the only weapon upon him,
and flung it on the table. At last Bellarion roused himself to some
show of real heat.</p>
<p>"Oh, but this is madness! What do you intend by me?"</p>
<p>"That is to be deliberated. But be under no delusive hope,
Bellarion."</p>
<p>"You are to decide my fate? You?" From Carmagnola he looked at
the others. He had paled a little; but amazement still rode above
fear.</p>
<p>Stoffel, unable longer to contain himself, turned furiously upon
Carmagnola. "You rash, vainglorious fool! If Bellarion is to be
tried there is none under the Duke's magnificence before whom he
may be arraigned."</p>
<p>"He has been arraigned already before us here. His guilt is
clear, and he has said nothing to dispel a single hair of it. There
remains only to decide his sentence."</p>
<p>"This is no proper arraignment. There has been no trial, nor
have you power to hold one," Stoffel insisted.</p>
<p>"You are wrong, captain. There are military laws..."</p>
<p>"I say this is no trial. If Bellarion is to be tried, you'll
send him before the Duke."</p>
<p>"And at the same time," put in Bellarion, "you'll send your
single witness&mdash;this clown who brought that letter. Your refusal to
produce him here before me now in itself shows the malice by which
you're moved."</p>
<p>Carmagnola flushed, and scowlingly considered the prisoner. "If
the form of trial you've received does not content you, and since
you charge me with personal feeling, there is another I am ready to
afford." He drew himself up and flung back his handsome head.
"Trial by battle, Lord Prince."</p>
<p>Over Bellarion's white face a sneer was spread.</p>
<p>"And what shall it prove if you ride me down? Shall it prove
more than that you have the heavier weight of brawn, that you are
more practised in the lists and have the stronger thews? Does it
need trial by battle to prove that?"</p>
<p>"God will defend the right," said Carmagnola.</p>
<p>"Will He so?" Bellarion laughed. "I am glad to have your word
for it. But you forget that the right to challenge lies with me,
the accused. In your blundering stupidity, you overlook essentials
always. Your very dullness acquits you of hypocrisy. Shall I
exercise that right upon the person in whose service I am carrying
arms, upon the body of the Marquis Gian Giacomo of Montferrat?"</p>
<p>The frail boy named started, and looked up with dilating eyes.
His sister cried out in very real alarm. But Carmagnola covered
them with his answer.</p>
<p>"I am your accuser, sir; not he."</p>
<p>"You are his deputy, no more," Bellarion answered, and now the
boy came to his feet, white and tense.</p>
<p>"He is in the right," he announced. "I cannot refuse him."</p>
<p>Smiling, Bellarion looked at Carmagnola, confused and
awkward.</p>
<p>"Always you overreach yourself," he mocked him. He turned to
Gian Giacomo. "You could not refuse me if I asked it. But I do not
ask it. I only desired to show the value of Carmagnola's
offer."</p>
<p>"You have some decency still," Carmagnola told him.</p>
<p>"Whilst you...God made you a fool, and that's the end of the
matter."</p>
<p>"Take him away."</p>
<p>Already it seemed they had their orders. They laid hands upon
him, and submitting without further words, he suffered them to lead
him out.</p>
<p>As the door closed upon him, Stoffel exploded. He raged and
stormed. He pleaded, argued, and vituperated them, even the
Princess, herself, for fools and dolts, and finally threatened to
raise the army against them, or at least to do his utmost with his
Swiss to prevent them from carrying out their evil intentions.</p>
<p>"Listen!" Carmagnola commanded sternly, and in the silence they
heard from the hall below a storm of angry outcries. "That is the
voice of the army, answering you: the voice of those who were
maimed last night as a result of his betrayal. Saving yourself,
there is not a captain in the army, and saving your own Swiss
hardly a man who is not this morning clamouring for Bellarion's
death."</p>
<p>"You are confessing that you published the matter even before
Bellarion was examined here! My God, you villain, you hell-kite,
you swaggering ape, who give a free rein to the base jealousy in
which you have ever held Bellarion! Your mean spite may drive you
now to the lengths of murder. But look to yourself thereafter.
You'll lose your empty head over this, Carmagnola!"</p>
<p>They silenced him and bore him out, whereafter they sat down to
seal Bellarion's fate.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-11" id="ch-3-11"></a>CHAPTER XI. THE PLEDGE</h2>
<p>Unanimously the captains voted for Bellarion's death. The only
dissentients were the Marquis and his sister. The latter was
appalled by the swiftness with which this thing had come upon them,
and shrank from being in any sense a party to the slaying of a man,
however guilty. Also, not only was she touched by Bellarion's
forbearance in the matter of trial by battle against her brother,
but his conduct in that connection showed in her mind the first
real doubt of his guilt. Urgently she pleaded that he should be
sent for trial before the Duke.</p>
<p>Carmagnola, in refusing, conveyed the impression of a great soul
wrestling with circumstances, a noble knight, placing duty above
inclination. It was a part that well became his splendid
person.</p>
<p>"Because you ask it, Madonna, for one reason; because of the
imputations of malice against me for another, I would give years of
my life to wash my hands of him and send him to Duke Filippo Maria.
But out of other considerations, in which your own and your
brother's future are concerned, I dare not. Saving perhaps Stoffel
and his Swiss, the whole army demands his death. The matter has
gone too far."</p>
<p>The captains, one and all, proved him right by their own present
insistence.</p>
<p>"Yet I do not believe him guilty," the young Marquis startled
them, "and I will be no party to the death of an innocent man."</p>
<p>"Would any of us?" Carmagnola asked him. "Is there any room for
doubt? The letter..."</p>
<p>"The letter," the boy interrupted hotly, "is as Bellarion says,
a trick of my uncle's to remove the one enemy he fears."</p>
<p>That touched Carmagnola's vanity with wounding effect. He
dissembled the hurt. But it served to strengthen his purpose.</p>
<p>"That vain boaster has seduced you with his argument, eh?"</p>
<p>"No; not with his argument, but with his conduct. He could have
challenged me to trial by combat, as he showed. What am I to stand
against him? A thing of straw. Yet he declined. Was that the action
of a trickster?"</p>
<p>"It was," Carmagnola answered emphatically. "It was a trick to
win you over. For he knew, as we all know, that a sovereign prince
does not lie under that law of chivalry. He knew that if he had
demanded it, you would have been within your right in appointing a
deputy."</p>
<p>"Why, then, did you not say so at the time?" the Princess asked
him.</p>
<p>"Because he did not press the matter. Oh, Madonna, believe me
there is no man in Italy who less desires to have Bellarion's blood
on his hands than I." He spoke sorrowfully, heavily. "But my duty
is clear, and whether it were clear or not, I must be governed by
the voice of these captains, all of whom demand, and rightly, this
double-dealing traitor's death."</p>
<p>Emphatically the captains confirmed him in the assertion; as
emphatically Gian Giacomo repeated that he would be no party to
it.</p>
<p>"You are not required to be," Carmagnola assured him. "You may
stand aside, my lord, and allow justice to take its course."</p>
<p>"Sirs," the Princess appealed to them. "Let me implore you
again, at least to send him to the Duke. Let the responsibility of
his death lie with his master."</p>
<p>Carmagnola rose. "Madonna, what you ask would lead to mutiny.
Tomorrow either I send Bellarion's head to his ally in Vercelli, or
the men will be out of hand and there will be an end to this
campaign. Dismiss your doubts and your fears. His guilt is crystal
clear. You need but remember his avowed intention of raising the
siege, to see in whose interest he works."</p>
<p>Heavy-eyed and heavy-hearted she sat, tormented by doubt now
that she was face to face with decision where hitherto no single
doubt had been. "You never asked him what alternative he proposed,"
she reminded him.</p>
<p>"To what end. That glib dissembler would have fooled us with
fresh falsehoods."</p>
<p>Belluno got to his feet. He had been manifesting impatience for
some moments. "Have we leave to go, my lord? This matter is at an
end."</p>
<p>Ugolino da Tenda followed his example. "The men below are
growing noisier. It is time we pacified them with our
decision."</p>
<p>"Ay, in God's name." Carmagnola waved them away, and himself
strode off from the table towards the hearth. He stirred the logs
with his boot, and sent an explosion of sparks flying up the
chimney. "Bear him word of our decision, Belluno. Bid him prepare
for death. He shall have until daybreak tomorrow to make his
soul."</p>
<p>"O God! If we should be wrong!" groaned the Princess.</p>
<p>The captains clanked out, and the door closed. Slowly Carmagnola
turned; reproachfully he regarded her.</p>
<p>"Have you no faith in me, Valeria? Should I do this thing if
there were any room for doubt?"</p>
<p>"You may be mistaken. You have been mistaken before,
remember."</p>
<p>He did not like to remember it. "And you? Have you been mistaken
all these years? Are you mistaken on the death of your friend Count
Spigno and what followed?"</p>
<p>"Ah! I was forgetting that," she confessed.</p>
<p>"Remember it. And remember what he said at that table, which
may, after all, be the truth. That Count Spigno has risen from the
grave at last for vengeance."</p>
<p>"Will you not send for this clown at least?" cried Gian
Giacomo.</p>
<p>"To what purpose now? What can he add to what we know? The
matter, lord marquis, is finished."</p>
<p>And meanwhile, Belluno was seeking Bellarion in the ground floor
of the castle.</p>
<p>With perfect composure Bellarion heard the words of doom. He did
not believe them. This sudden thing was too monstrously impossible.
It was incredible the gods should have raised him so swiftly to his
pinnacle of fame merely to cast him down again for their amusement.
They might make sport with him, but they would hardly carry it to
the lengths of quenching his life.</p>
<p>His only answer now was to proffer his pinioned wrists and beg
that the cord might be cut. Belluno shook his head to that in
silence. Bellarion grew indignant.</p>
<p>"What purpose does it serve beyond a cruelty? The window is
barred, the door is strong, and there is probably a guard beyond
it. I could not escape if I would."</p>
<p>"You'll be less likely to attempt it with bound wrists."</p>
<p>"I'll pass you my parole of honour to remain a prisoner."</p>
<p>"You are convicted of treachery, and you know as well as I do
that the parole of a convicted traitor is never taken."</p>
<p>"Go to the devil, then," said Bellarion, which so angered
Belluno that he called in the guard and ordered them to bind
Bellarion's ankles as well.</p>
<p>So trussed that he could move only by hops, and then at the risk
of falling, they left him. He sat down on one of the two stools
which, with a table, made up all the furniture of that bare chill
place. He wagged his head and even smiled over the thought of
Belluno's refusal to accept his parole, or, rather, over the
thought that in offering it he had no notion of keeping it.</p>
<p>"I'd break more than my pledged word to get out of this," said
he to himself. "And only an idiot would blame me."</p>
<p>He looked round the bare stone wails, and lastly at the window.
He rose and hopped over to it. Leaning on the sill which was at the
height of his breast, he looked out. It opened upon the inner
court, he found, so that wherever escape might lie, it lay not that
way. The sill upon the rough edge of which he leaned was of
granite. He studied it awhile attentively.</p>
<p>"The fools!" he said, and hopped back to his stool, where he
gave himself up to quiet meditation until they brought him a hunch
of bread and a mug of wine.</p>
<p>To the man-at-arms who acted as gaoler he held out his pinioned
wrists. "How am I to eat and drink?" he asked.</p>
<p>"You'll make shift as best you can."</p>
<p>He made shift, and by using his two hands as one contrived to
eat and drink. After that he spent some time at the sill, patiently
drawing his wrists backwards and forwards along the edge of it,
with long rests between whiles to restore the blood which had
flowed out of upheld arms. It was wearying toil, and kept him fully
engaged for some hours.</p>
<p>Towards dusk he set up a shouting which at last brought the
guard into his prison.</p>
<p>"You're in haste to die, my lord,'" the fellow insolently mocked
him. "But quiet you. The stranglers are bidden for daybreak."</p>
<p>"And I am to perish like a dog?" Bellarion furiously asked him.
With pinioned wrists and ankles he sat there by his table. "Am I
never to have a priest to shrive me?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Ah! A priest?" The fellow went out. He went in quest of
Carmagnola. But Carmagnola was absent, marshalling his men against
a threatened attempt by Stoffel and the Swiss to rescue Bellarion.
The captains were away about the same business, and there remained
only the Princess and her brother.</p>
<p>"Messer Bellarion is asking for a priest," he told them</p>
<p>"Has none been sent to him?" cried Gian Giacomo.</p>
<p>"He'd not be sent until an hour before the stranglers."</p>
<p>Valeria shuddered, and sat numbed with horror. Gian Giacomo
swore under his breath. "In God's name let the poor fellow have a
priest at once. Let one be sent for from Quinto."</p>
<p>It would be an hour later when a preaching friar from the
convent of St. Dominic was ushered into Bellarion's prison, a tail
frail man in a long black mantle over his white habit.</p>
<p>The guard placed a lantern on the table, glanced compassionately
at the prisoner, who sat there as he had earlier seen him, with
pinioned wrists and ankles. But something had happened to the cords
meanwhile, for no sooner had the guard passed out and closed the
door than Bellarion stood up and his bonds fell from him like
cobwebs, startling the good monk who came to shrive him. Infinitely
more startled was the good monk to find himself suddenly seized by
the throat in a pair of strong, nervous hands whose thumbs were so
pressed into his windpipe that he could neither cry out nor
breathe. He writhed in that unrelenting grip, until a fierce
whisper quieted him.</p>
<p>"Be still if you would hope to live. If you undertake to make no
sound tap your foot twice upon the ground, and I'll release
you."</p>
<p>Frantically the foot was tapped.</p>
<p>"But remember that at the first outcry I shall kill you without
mercy."</p>
<p>He removed his hands, and the priest almost choked himself in
his sudden greed of air.</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;why do you assault me?" he gasped. "I come to comfort
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know why you come better than you do, brother. You think you
could bring me the promise of eternal life. All that I require from
you at present is the promise of temporal existence. So we'll leave
the shriving for something more urgent."</p>
<p>It would be a half-hour later, when, cowled as he had entered,
the tall bowed figure of the priest emerged again from the room,
bearing the lantern.</p>
<p>"I've brought the light, my son," he said almost in a whisper.
"Your prisoner desires to be alone in the dark with his
thoughts."</p>
<p>The man-at-arms took the lantern in one hand, whilst with the
other he was driving home the bolt. Suddenly he swung the lantern
to the level of the cowl. This priest did not seem quite the same
as the one who had entered. The next moment, on his back, his
throat gripped by the vigorous man who knelt upon him, the guard
knew that his suspicions had been well-founded. Another moment and
he knew nothing, for the hands that held him had hammered his head
against the stone floor until consciousness was blotted out.</p>
<p>Bellarion extinguished the lantern, pushed the unconscious
man-at-arms into the deepest shadow of that dimly-lighted hall,
adjusted his mantle and cowl, and went quickly out.</p>
<p>The soldiers in the courtyard saw in that cowled figure only the
monk who had gone to shrive Bellarion. The postern was opened for
him, and with a murmured, "Pax vobiscum", he passed out across the
lesser bridge and gained the open. Thereafter, under cover of the
night, he went at speed, the monkish gown tucked high, for he knew
not how soon the sentinel he had stunned might recover to give the
alarm. In his haste he almost stumbled upon a strong picket, and in
fleeing from that he was within an ace of blundering into another.
Thereafter he proceeded with more caution over ground that was
everywhere held by groups of soldiers posted by Carmagnola against
any attempt on the part of the Swiss.</p>
<p>As a result, it was not until an hour or so before midnight that
he, came at last to Stoffel's quarter, away to the south of
Vercelli, and found there everything in ferment. He was stopped by
a party of men of Uri to whom at once he made himself known to
their captain; the news of his presence ran like fire through the
Swiss encampment.</p>
<p>Stoffel, who was in full armour when Bellarion entered his tent,
gasped his questioning amazement, whilst Bellarion threw off his
mantle and white woolled habit and stood forth in his own proper
person and garments.</p>
<p>"We were on the point of coming for you," Stoffel told him.</p>
<p>"A fool's errand, Werner. What could you have done against three
thousand men, who are ready and expecting you?" But he spoke with a
warm hand firmly gripping Stoffel's shoulders and a heart warmed
indeed by this proof of trust and loyalty.</p>
<p>"Something we might have done. There was a will on our side that
must be lacking on the other."</p>
<p>"And the walls of Quinto? You'd have beaten your heads in vain
against those, even had you succeeded in reaching them. It's as
lucky for you as for me that I've saved you this trouble."</p>
<p>"And what now?" Stoffel asked him.</p>
<p>"Give the order to break camp at once. We march to Mortara to
rejoin the Company of the White Dog, from which I should never have
separated. We'll show Carmagnola and those Montferrine princes what
Bellarion can do."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they already had some notion of it. The alarm at his
escape had spread through Quinto, and Carmagnola had been fetched
from the lines to be informed of it in detail by a half-naked
priest and a man-at-arms with a bandaged head. It had taken some
time to find him. It took more for him to resolve what should be
done. At last, however, he decided that Bellarion would have fled
to Stoffel; so he assembled his captains, and with the whole army
marched on the Swiss encampment. But he came too late. At the last
the Swiss had not waited to strike their camp, realizing the danger
of delay, but had departed leaving it standing.</p>
<p>Back to Quinto and the agitated Princess went Carmagnola with
the news of failure. He found her waiting alone in the armoury,
huddled in a great chair by the fire.</p>
<p>"That he will have gone to his own condotta Mortara is certain,"
he declared. "But without knowing which road he took, how could I
follow in the dark? And to follow meant fulfilling that traitor's
intention of raising this siege."</p>
<p>He raged and swore, striding to and fro there in his wrath,
bitterly upbraiding himself for not having taken better
precautions, knowing with what a trickster he had to deal, damning
the priest and the sentry and the fools in the courtyard who had
allowed Bellarion to walk undetected through their ranks.</p>
<p>She watched him, and found him less admirable than hitherto in
the wildness of his ravings. Unwillingly almost her mind contrasted
his behaviour under stress with the calm she had observed in
Bellarion. She fetched a weary sigh. If only Bellarion had been
true and loyal, what a champion would he not have been!</p>
<p>"Raging will not help you, Carmagnola," she said at last, the
least asperity in her tone.</p>
<p>It brought him, pained, to a halt before her. "And whence,
Madonna, is my rage? Have I lost anything? Do I strive here for
personal ends? Ha! I rage at the thought of the difficulties that
will rise up for you."</p>
<p>"For me?"</p>
<p>"Can you doubt what will follow? Do you think that all that we
have lost tonight is Bellarion, with perhaps his Swiss? The men at
Mortara are mostly of his own company, the Company of the Dog. A
well-named company as God lives! And those who are not, serve under
captains who are loyal to him and who, knowing nothing of his
discovered treachery here, will be beguiled by that seducer. In
strength he will be our superior, with close upon four thousand
men."</p>
<p>She looked up at him in alarm. "You are suggesting that we shall
have him coming against us!"</p>
<p>"What else? Do we not know enough already of his aims? By all
the Saints! things could not have fallen out better to give him the
pretext that he needed." He was raging again. "Had this sly devil
contrived these circumstances himself, he could not have improved
them. By these he can justify himself at need to the Duke. Oh, he's
turned the tables on us. Now you see why I meant to give him no
chance."</p>
<p>She kept her mind to the essence of the matter.</p>
<p>"Then if he comes against us we are lost. We shall be caught
between his army and my uncle's."</p>
<p>His overwhelming vanity would not permit him to admit or even to
think so much. He laughed, confident and disdainful.</p>
<p>"Have you so little faith in me, Valeria? I am no apprentice in
this art of war. And, with the thought of you to spur me on, do you
think that I will suffer defeat? I'll not lay down my arms while I
have life to serve you. I will take measures tomorrow. And I will
send letters to the Duke informing him of Bellarion's defection,
and begging reinforcements. Can you doubt that they will come? Is
Filippo Maria the man to let one of his captains mutiny and go
unpunished?" He laughed again, full of a confidence by which she
was infected. And he looked so strong and masterful, so handsome in
the half-armour he still wore&mdash;a very god of war.</p>
<p>She held out a hand to him. "My friend, forgive my doubt. You
shall be dishonoured by no more fears of mine."</p>
<p>He caught her hand. He drew her out of the chair and towards him
until she brought up against his broad mailed breast. "That is the
fine brave spirit that I love in you as I love all in you, Valeria.
You are mine, Valeria! God made us for each other."</p>
<p>"Not yet," she said, smiling a little, her eyes downcast and
veiled from his ardent glance.</p>
<p>"When, then?" was his burning question.</p>
<p>"When Theodore has been whipped out of Montferrat."</p>
<p>His arms tightened about her until his armour hurt her.</p>
<p>"It is a pledge, Valeria?"</p>
<p>"A pledge?" she echoed on a questioning exalted tone. "The man
who does that may claim me when he wants me. I swear it."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-12" id="ch-3-12"></a>CHAPTER XII. CARMAGNOLA'S
DUTY</h2>
<p>My Lord Carmagnola had shut himself up in a small room on the
ground floor of the castle of Quinto to indite a letter to the High
and Most Potent Duke Filippo Maria of Milan. A heavy labour this,
of quill on parchment, for one who had little scholarship. It was a
labour that fell to him so rarely that he had never perceived until
now the need to equip himself with a secretary.</p>
<p>The Princess and her brother newly returned from Mass on that
Sunday morning, four days after Bellarion's escape, were together
in the armoury discussing their situation, and differing a good
deal in their views, for the mental eyes of the young Marquis were
not dazzled by the effulgence of Carmagnola's male beauty or
deceived by his histrionic attitudes.</p>
<p>Into their presence, almost unheralded, were ushered two men.
One of these was small and slight and active as a monkey, the other
a fellow of great girth with a big red, boldly humorous face, blue
eyes under black brows flanking a beak of a nose, and a sparse
fringe of grey hair straggling about a gleaming bald head.</p>
<p>The sight of those two, who smirked and bowed, brought brother
and sister very suddenly to their feet.</p>
<p>"Barbaresco!" she cried on a note of gladness, holding out both
her hands. "And Casella!"</p>
<p>"And," said Barbaresco, as he rolled forward, "near upon another
five hundred refugees from Montferrat, both Guelph and Ghibelline,
whom we've been collecting in Piedmont and Lombardy, to swell the
army of the great Bellarion and settle accounts with Master
Theodore."</p>
<p>They kissed her hand and then her brother's. "My Lord Marquis!"
cried the fire-eating Casella, his gimlet glance appraising the
lad. "You're so well grown I should hardly have known you. We are
your servants, my lord, as Madonna here can tell you. For years
have we laboured for you and suffered for you. But we touch the end
of all that now, as do you. Theodore is brought to bay at last. We
are hounds to help you pull him down."</p>
<p>At no season could their coming have been more welcome or
uplifting than in this hour of dark depression, when recruits to
the cause of the young Marquis were so urgently required. This she
told them, announcing their arrival a good omen. Servants were
summoned and dispatched for wine, and whilst the newcomers drank
the hot spiced beverage provided they learnt the true meaning of
her words.</p>
<p>It sobered their exultation. This defection of Bellarion and his
powerful company, amounting to more than half the entire army,
altered their outlook completely.</p>
<p>Barbaresco blew out his great cheeks, frowning darkly.</p>
<p>"You say that Bellarion is the agent of Theodore?" he cried.</p>
<p>"We have proof of it," she sadly assured him, and told him of
the letter. His amazement deepened. "Does it surprise you, then?"
she asked. "Surely it should be no news to you!"</p>
<p>"Once it would not have been. For once I thought that I held
proof of the same; that was on the night that Spigno died at his
hands. Later, before that same night was out, I understood better
why he killed Spigno."</p>
<p>"You understood? Why he killed him?" She was white to the lips.
Gian Giacomo was leaning forward across the table, his face eager.
She uttered a fretful laugh. "He killed him because he was my
friend, mine and my brother's, the chief of all our friends."</p>
<p>Barbaresco shook his great head. "He killed him because this
Spigno whom we all trusted so completely was a spy of
Theodore's."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Her world reeled about her; her senses battled in a mist. The
thick droning voice of Barbaresco came to deepen her confusion.</p>
<p>"It is all so simple; so very clear. The fact that Spigno was
dressed as we found him and in the attic where we had imprisoned
Bellarion should in themselves have explained everything. How came
he there '? Bellarion was all but convicted of being an agent of
Theodore's. But for Spigno we should have dealt with him out of
hand. Then at dead of night Spigno went to liberate him, and by
that very act convicted himself in Bellarion's eyes. And for that
Bellarion stabbed him. The only flaw is how one agent of Theodore's
should have come to be under such a misapprehension about the
other. Saving that, the thing would have been clear at once."</p>
<p>"That I can explain," said Valeria breathlessly, "if you have
sound proof of Spigno's guilt, if it is not all based on rash
assumption."</p>
<p>"Assumption!" laughed Casella, and he took up the tale. "That
night, when we determined upon flight, we first repaired, because
of our suspicions, to Spigno's lodgings. We found there a letter
superscribed to Theodore to be delivered in the event of Spigno's
death or disappearance. Within it we found a list of our names and
of the part of each of us in the plot to kill the Regent; and the
terms of that letter made it more than clear that throughout Spigno
had been Theodore's agent for the destruction of the Marquis
here."</p>
<p>"That letter," said Barbaresco, "was a safeguard the scoundrel
had prepared in the event of discovery. The threat of its dispatch
to Theodore would have been used to compel us to hold our hands.
Oh, a subtle villain, your best and most loyal friend Count Spigno!
And but for Bellarion..." He spread his hands and laughed.</p>
<p>Then Casella interposed.</p>
<p>"You said, Madonna, that you could supply the link that's
missing in our chain." But she was not listening. She sat with
drooping head, her hands listlessly folded in her lap.</p>
<p>"It was all true. All true!" Her tone seemed the utterance of a
broken heart. "And I have mistrusted him and...Oh God!" she cried
out. "When I think that by now he might have been strangled and
with my consent. And now..."</p>
<p>"And now," cut in her brother almost brutally, considering the
pain she was already bearing, "you and that swaggering fool
Carmagnola have between you driven him out and perhaps set him
against us."</p>
<p>The swaggering fool came in at that moment with inky fingers and
disordered hair. The phrase that greeted him brought him to a halt
on the threshold, his attitude magnificent.</p>
<p>"What's this?" he asked with immense dignity.</p>
<p>He was told by Gian Giacomo, so fiercely and unsparingly, that
he went red and white by turns as he listened. Then commanding
himself, and wrapped in his dignity as in a mantle, he came slowly
forward. He smiled even, condescendingly.</p>
<p>"Of all this that you tell I know nothing. It may well be as you
say. It is no concern of mine. What concerns me is what has
happened here; the discovery that Bellarion was in correspondence
with Theodore and his avowed intention to raise this siege; add to
this that he has slipped through our hands and is now abroad to
work your ruin, and consider if you are justified in using hard
words to me, but for whom your ruin would already have been
encompassed."</p>
<p>His majestic air and his display of magnanimity under their
reproach imposed upon all but Valeria. It was she who answered
him:</p>
<p>"You are forgetting that it was only my conviction that he had
been Theodore's agent aforetime which disposed me to believe him
Theodore's agent now."</p>
<p>"But the letter, then?" Carmagnola was showing signs of
exasperation.</p>
<p>"In God's name, where is this letter?" growled the deep voice of
Barbaresco.</p>
<p>"Who are you to question me now? I do not know your right, sir,
or even your name."</p>
<p>The Princess presented him and at the same time Casella. "They
are old and esteemed friends, my lord, and they are here to serve
me with all the men that they can muster. Let Messer Barbaresco see
this letter."</p>
<p>Impatiently Carmagnola produced it from the scrip that hung
beside his dagger from a gold-embossed girdle of crimson
leather.</p>
<p>Slowly Barbaresco spelled it out, Casella reading over his
shoulder. When he had done, he looked at Carmagnola, and from
Carmagnola to the others, first in sheer amazement then in scornful
mirth.</p>
<p>"Lord of Heaven, Messer Carmagnola! You've the repute of a great
fighter, and to be sure you're a fine figure of a man; also, I must
assume you honest. But I should sooner put my trust in your animal
strength than in your wits."</p>
<p>"Sir!"</p>
<p>"Oh ay, to be sure, you can throw out your chest and roar and
strut. But use your brains for once, man." The boldly humorous red
face was overspread by a sardonic grin. "Master Theodore took your
measure shrewdly when he thought to impose upon you with this foxy
piece of buffoonery, and my faith, if Bellarion had been less
nimble this trick would have served its purpose. Nay, now don't
puff and blow and swell! Read the letter again. Ask yourself if it
would have borne that full signature and that superscription if it
had been sincere, and, considering that it imparts no useful
information save that Bellarion was betraying you, ask yourself if
it would have been written at all had anything it says been
true."</p>
<p>"The very arguments that Bellarion used," cried the Marquis.</p>
<p>"To which we would not listen," said the Princess bitterly.</p>
<p>Carmagnola sniffed. "They are the arguments any man in his case
would use. You overlook that the letter is an incentive, an
undertaking to reward him suitably if he..."</p>
<p>Barbaresco broke in, exasperated by the man's grandiose
stupidity. "To the devil with that, numskull!"</p>
<p>"Numskull, sir? To me? By heaven..."</p>
<p>"Sirs, sirs!" The Princess laid her hand on Barbaresco's great
arm. "This is not seemly to my Lord Carmagnola..."</p>
<p>"I know it. I know it. I crave his pardon. But I was never
taught to suffer fools gladly. I..."</p>
<p>"Sir, your every word is an offence. You..." Valeria calmed
them. "Don't you see, Messer Carmagnola, that he but uses you as my
whipping boy. It is I who am the fool, the numskull in his eyes;
for these deeds are more mine than any other's. But my old friend
Barbaresco is too courteous to say so."</p>
<p>"Courteous?" snorted Carmagnola. "That is the last term I should
apply to his boorishness. By what right does he come hectoring
here?"</p>
<p>"By the right of his old affection for me and my brother. That
is what makes him hot. For my sake, then, bear with him, sir."</p>
<p>The great man bowed, his hand upon his heart, signifying that
for her sake there was no indignity he would not suffer.</p>
<p>Thereafter he defended himself with great dignity. If the letter
had been all, he might have taken Barbaresco's views. But it was,
he repeated, the traitor Bellarion's avowed intention to raise the
siege. That, in itself, was a proof of his double dealing.</p>
<p>"How did this letter come to you?" Barbaresco asked. Gian
Giacomo answered, whilst Valeria added in bitter self-reproach:
"And this messenger was never examined, although Bellarion demanded
that he should be brought before us."</p>
<p>"Do you upbraid me with that, Madonna?" Carmagnola cried. "He
was a poor clown who could have told us nothing. He was not
examined because it would have been waste of time."</p>
<p>"Let us waste it now," said Barbaresco. "To what purpose,
sir?"</p>
<p>"Why, to beguile our leisure. No other entertainment
offers."</p>
<p>Carmagnola contained himself under that sardonic leer.</p>
<p>"Sir, you are resolved, it seems, to try my patience. It
requires all my regard and devotion for her highness to teach me to
endure it. The messenger shall be brought."</p>
<p>At Valeria's request not only the messenger, but the captains
who had voted Bellarion's death were also summoned. Carmagnola
demurred at first, but bowed in the end to her stern
insistence.</p>
<p>They came, and when they were all assembled they were told by
the Princess why they had been summoned as well as what she had
that morning learnt from Barbaresco. Then the messenger was brought
in between guards, and it was the Princess herself who questioned
him.</p>
<p>"You have nothing to fear, boy," she assured him gently, as he
cowered in terror before her. "You are required to answer
truthfully. When you have done so, and unless I discover that you
are lying, you shall be restored to liberty."</p>
<p>Carmagnola, who had come to take his stand at her side, bent
over her.</p>
<p>"Is that prudent, Madonna?"</p>
<p>"Prudent or not, it is promised." There was in her tone an
asperity that dismayed him. She addressed herself to the clown.</p>
<p>"When you were given this letter were you given precise
instructions for its delivery?"</p>
<p>"Yes, magnificent Madonna."</p>
<p>"What were those instructions?"</p>
<p>"I was taken to the ramparts by a knight, to join some other
knights and soldiers. They pointed to the lines straight ahead. I
was to go in that direction with the letter. If taken, I was to ask
for the Lord Bellarion."</p>
<p>"Were you bidden to go cautiously? To conceal yourself?"</p>
<p>"No, Madonna. On the contrary. My orders were to let myself be
seen. I am answering truthfully, Madonna."</p>
<p>"When you were told to go straight ahead into the lines that
were pointed out to you, on which side of the ramparts were you
standing?"</p>
<p>"On the south side, Madonna. By the Southern Gate. That is
truth, as God hears me."</p>
<p>The Princess leaned forward, and she was not the only one to
move.</p>
<p>"Were you told, or did you know, what soldiers occupied the
section of the lines to which you were bidden?"</p>
<p>"I just knew that they were soldiers of the besieging army, or
the Lord Bellarion's army. I am telling you the truth, Madonna. I
was told to be careful to go straight and not to wander into any
other part of the line but that."</p>
<p>Ugolino da Tenda made a sharp movement forward. "What are you
saying?"</p>
<p>"The truth! The truth!" cried the lad in terror. "May God strike
me dumb for ever if I have uttered a lie."</p>
<p>"Quiet! Quiet!" the Princess admonished him. "Be sure we know
when you speak the truth. Keep to it and fear nothing. Did you hear
mention of any name in connection with that section of the
line?"</p>
<p>"Did I?" He searched his mind, and his eyes brightened. "Ay, ay,
I did. They spoke amongst them. They named one Carmaldola,
or...Carmandola..."</p>
<p>"Or Carmagnola," da Tenda cut in, and laughed splutteringly in
sheer contempt. "It's clear, I think, that Theodore's letter was
intended for just the purpose that it's served."</p>
<p>"Clear? How is it clear?" Carmagnola's contempt was in the
question.</p>
<p>"In everything, now that we have heard this clown. Why was he
sent to the southern section? Do you suppose Theodore did not know
that Valsassina himself and those directly under him, of whom I was
one, were quartered in Quinto; on the western side?" Then his voice
swelled up in anger: "Why was this messenger not examined sooner,
or"&mdash;he checked and his eyes narrowed as they fixed themselves on
Carmagnola's flushed and angry face&mdash;"or, was he?"</p>
<p>"Was he?" roared Carmagnola. "Now what the devil do you
mean?"</p>
<p>"You know what I mean, Carmagnola. You led us all within an ace
of doing murder. Did you lead us so because you're a fool or a
villain? Which?"</p>
<p>Carmagnola sprang at him, roaring like a bull. The other
captains got between, and the Princess, on her feet, commanding,
imperious, added her voice sharply to theirs to restore order. They
obeyed that slim frail woman, scarcely more than a girl, as she
stood there straight and tense in her wine-coloured mantle, her
red-gold head so proudly held, her dark eyes burning in her white
face.</p>
<p>"Captain Ugolino, that was ill said of you," she reproved him.
"You forget that if this messenger was not examined before, the
blame for that is upon all of us. We took too much for granted, and
too readily, against the Prince of Valsassina."</p>
<p>"It is now that you take too much for granted," answered
Carmagnola. "Why did Valsassina intend to raise this siege if he is
honest? Answer me that?"</p>
<p>His challenge was to all. Ugolino da Tenda answered it. "For
some such reason as he had when he sent his men to hold the bridge
at Carpignano while you were building bridges here. Bellarion's
intentions are not clear to dull eyes like yours and mine,
Carmagnola."</p>
<p>Carmagnola considered him malevolently. "You and I will discuss
this matter further elsewhere," he promised him. "You have used
expressions I am not the man to forget."</p>
<p>"It may be good for you to remember them," said the young
captain, no whit intimidated. "Meanwhile, Madonna, I take my leave.
I march my condotta out of this camp within an hour."</p>
<p>She looked at him in sudden distress. He answered the look. "I
am grieved, Madonna. But my duty is to the Prince of Valsassina. I
was seduced from it by too hasty a judgment. I return to it at
once." He bowed low, gathered up his cloak, and went clanking
out.</p>
<p>"Hold there!" Carmagnola thundered after him. "Before you go
I've an account to settle with you."</p>
<p>Ugolino turned on the threshold, drawn up to his full height.
"I'll afford you the opportunity," said he, "but only after I have
the answer to my question, whether you are a villain or a fool, and
only if I find that you're a fool."</p>
<p>The captains made a barrier which Carmagnola could not pass.
Livid with anger and humiliation, his grand manner dissipated, he
turned to the Princess.</p>
<p>"Will your highness suffer me to go after him? He must not be
permitted to depart."</p>
<p>But she shook her red-gold head. "No, sir. I detain no man here
against his inclinations. And Captain Ugolino seems justified of
his."</p>
<p>"Justified! Dear God! Justified!" He apostrophized the groined
ceiling, then swung to the other four captains standing there. "And
you?" he demanded. "Do you also deem yourselves justified to
mutiny?"</p>
<p>Belluno was prompt to answer. But then Belluno was his own
lieutenant. "My lord, if there has been an error we are all in it,
and have the honesty to admit it."</p>
<p>"I am glad there is still some honesty among you. And you?" His
angry eyes swept over the others. One by one they answered as
Belluno had done. But they were men of little account, and the
defection of the four of them would not have reduced the army as
did Ugolino's, whose condotta amounted to close upon a thousand
men.</p>
<p>"We are forgetting this poor clown," said the Princess.</p>
<p>Carmagnola looked at him as if he would with joy have wrung his
neck.</p>
<p>"You may go, boy," she told him. "You are free. See that he
leaves unhindered."</p>
<p>He went with his guards. The captains, dismissed, went out
next.</p>
<p>Carmagnola, his spirit badly bruised and battered, looked at the
Princess, who had sunk back into her chair.</p>
<p>"However it has been achieved," he said. "Theodore's ends could
not better have been served. What is left us now?"</p>
<p>"If I might venture to advise..." quoth Barbaresco, smooth as
oil, "I should say that you could not do better than follow Ugolino
da Tenda's example."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Return to your duty to Bellarion."</p>
<p>"Return?" Carmagnola leaned towards him from his fine height,
and his mouth gaped. "Return?" he repeated. "And leave
Vercelli?"</p>
<p>"Why not? That would no more than fulfil Bellarion's intention
to raise the siege. He will have an alternative."</p>
<p>"I care nothing for his alternatives; and let us be clear upon
this: I owe him no fealty. My fealty was sworn not to him, but to
the Duchess Beatrice. And my orders from Duke Filippo Maria are to
assist in the reduction of Vercelli. I know where my duty
lies.''</p>
<p>"It is possible," said the Princess slowly, "that Bellarion had
some other plan for bringing Theodore to his knees."</p>
<p>He stared at her. There was pain in his handsome eyes. His face
was momentarily almost convulsed. And there was more than pain in
his voice when he spoke.</p>
<p>"Oh, Madonna! Into what irreparable error is your generous heart
misleading you? How can you have come in a breath to place all your
trust in this man whom for years you have known, as many know him,
for a scheming villain?"</p>
<p>"Could I do less, having discovered the cruelty of my
error?"</p>
<p>"Are you sure&mdash;can you be sure upon such slight grounds&mdash;that
you were in error? That you are not in error now? You heard what
Belluno said of him on the night my bridges were destroyed&mdash;that
Bellarion never looks where he aims."</p>
<p>"That, sir, is what has misled me, to my present shame."</p>
<p>"Is it not rather what is misleading you now?"</p>
<p>"You heard what Messer Barbaresco had to tell me."</p>
<p>"I do not need to hear Messer Barbaresco or any other. I know
what I can see for myself, what my wits tell me."</p>
<p>She looked at him, almost slyly for one normally so wide-eyed,
and her answer, all considered, was a little cruel.</p>
<p>"Are you still unshaken in your confidence in your wits? Do you
still think that you can trust them?"</p>
<p>That was the death-blow to his passion for her, as it was the
deathblow of the high hopes he is suspected of having centred in
her, seeing himself, perhaps, as the husband of the Princess
Valeria of Montferrat, supreme in Montferrine court and camp. It
was a sword-thrust full into his vanity, which was the vital part
of him.</p>
<p>He stepped back, white to the very lips, his countenance
disordered. Then, commanding himself, he bowed and steadied his
voice to answer.</p>
<p>"Madonna, I see that you have made your choice. My prayer will
be that you may not have occasion to repent it. No doubt the troops
accompanying these gentlemen of Montferrat will be your sufficient
escort to Mortara, or you may join forces with Ugolino da Tenda's
condotta. Although I shall be left with not more than half the men
the enterprise demands, with these I must shift to reduce Vercelli,
as my duty is. Thus, Madonna, you may yet owe your deliverance to
me. May God be with you!" He bowed again.</p>
<p>Perhaps he hoped still for some word to arrest him, some
retraction of the injustice with which she used him. But it did not
come.</p>
<p>"I thank you for your good intentions, my lord," she said
civilly. "God be with you too."</p>
<p>He bit his lip, then turned and threw high that handsome golden
head, which he was destined to leave, some few years later, between
the pillars of the Piazetta in Venice. Thus he stalked out. All
considered, it was an orderly retreat; and that was the last she
ever saw of him.</p>
<p>As the door banged, Barbaresco smacked his great thigh with his
open palm and exploded into laughter.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-13" id="ch-3-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. THE OCCUPATION
OF CASALE</h2>
<p>When Bellarion proclaimed his intention of raising the siege of
Vercelli he had it in mind, in view of the hopelessness of being
able to reduce the place reasonably soon, to draw Theodore into the
open by means of that strategic movement which Thucydides had
taught him, and to which he had so often already, and so
successfully, had recourse.</p>
<p>His Swiss, being without baggage, travelled lightly and swiftly.
They left their camp before Vercelli on the night of Wednesday, and
on the evening of the following Friday Bellarion brought them into
the village of Pavone, where Koenigshofen had established himself
in Facino's old quarters of three years ago. There they lay for the
night. But whilst his weary followers rested, himself he spent the
greater part of the night in the necessary dispositions for
striking camp at dawn. And very early on that misty November
morning he was off again with Giasone Trotta, Koenigshofen and all
the horse, leaving Stoffel to follow more at leisure with the foot,
the baggage and the artillery.</p>
<p>Before nightfall he was at San Salvatore, where his army rested,
and on the following Sunday morning, at just about the time that
Barbaresco was reaching Vercelli, Bellarion, Prince of Valsassina,
was approaching the Lombard Gate into Casale by the road along
which he had fled thence years before, a nameless outcast waif
whose only ambition was the study of Greek at Pavia.</p>
<p>He had travelled by many roads since then, and after long delays
he had reached Pavia, no longer as a poor nameless scholar, but as
a condottiero of renown, not to solicit at the University the alms
of a little learning, but to command whatever he might crave of the
place, holding even its prince in subjection. Greek he had not
learnt; but he had learnt much else instead, though nothing that
made him love his fellow-man hold the world in high regard.
Therefore he was glad to think that here he touched the end of that
long journey begun five years ago along this Lombard Road: the
mission upon which he had set out blindly that day was, after many
odd turns of Fortune, all but accomplished. When it was done, he
would strip off this soldier's harness, abdicate his princely
honours, and return on foot, humbler than when he had set out, and
cured of his erstwhile heresy, to the benign and peaceful shelter
of the Convent at Cigliano.</p>
<p>There was no attempt to bar his entrance into the Montferrine
capital. The officer commanding the place knew himself without the
necessary means to oppose this force which so unexpectedly came to
demand admittance. And so the people of Casale issuing from Mass on
that Sunday morning found the great square before Liutprand's
Cathedral and the main streets leading from it blocked by
outlandish men-at-arms&mdash;Italians, Gascons, Burgundians, Swabians,
Saxons and Swiss&mdash;whose leader proclaimed himself Captain-General
of the army of the Marquis Gian Giacomo of Montferrat.</p>
<p>It was a proclamation that not at all reassured them of their
dread at the presence of a rapacious and violent soldiery.</p>
<p>The Council of Ancients, summoned by Bellarion's heralds,
assembled in the Communal Palace to hear the terms of this brigand
captain&mdash;as they conceived him&mdash;who had swooped upon their
defenceless city.</p>
<p>He came attended by a group of officers. He was tall and
soldierly of bearing, in full armour, save for his helm, which was
borne after him by a page; and his escort, from the brawny bearded
Koenigshofen, to the fierce-eyed ferrety Giasone, was calculated to
inspire dread in peaceful citizens. But his manner was gentle, and
his words were fair.</p>
<p>"Sirs, your city of Casale has nothing to fear from this
occupation, for it is not upon its citizens that we make war; and,
so that they give no provocation, they will find my followers
orderly. We invite your alliance with ourselves in the cause of
right and justice. But if you withhold this alliance we shall not
visit it against you provided that you do not go the length of
actively opposing us.</p>
<p>"The High and Mighty Lord Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan,
weary of the encroachments upon his dominions resulting from the
turbulent ambition of your Prince-Regent, the Marquis Theodore, has
resolved to make an end of a regency which in itself has already
become a usurpation and to place in the authority to which his
majority entitles, him, your rightful Prince, the Marquis Gian
Giacomo Palaeologo. I invite you, sirs, to perform your duty as
representatives of the people by swearing upon my hands fealty to
that same Marquis Gian Giacomo in the Cathedral at the hour of
Vespers this evening."</p>
<p>That invitation was a command, and it was punctually obeyed by
men who had not the strength to resist. Meanwhile, a measure of
reassurance had been afforded the city by Bellarion's proclamation
enjoining order upon his troops. The proclamation was in no
equivocal terms. It reminded the men that they were in occupation
of a friendly city which they were sent to guard and defend, and
that any act of pillage or violence would be punished by death.
They were housed, some in the citadel and the remainder in the
fortress-palace of the Montferrine princes, where Bellarion himself
took up his quarters.</p>
<p>In Theodore's own closet, occupying the very chair in which
Theodore had sat and so contemptuously received the unknown
Bellarion on that day when the young student had first entered
those august walls, Bellarion that night penned a letter to the
Princess Valeria, wherein he gave her news of the day's events.
That letter, of a calligraphy so perfect that it might be mistaken
for a page from monkish manuscript of those days, is one of the few
fragments that have survived from the hand of this remarkable man
who was adventurer, statesman, soldier and humanist.</p>
<p class="letter">Most honoured and most dear lady, he addresses
her&mdash;Riveritissima et Carissima Madonna. The exordium is all that
need concern us now.<br>
<br>
Ever since at your invitation I entered your service that evening
in your garden here at Casale, where today I have again wandered,
reviving memories that are of the fairest in my life, that service
has been my constant study. I have pursued it, by tortuous ways and
by many actions appearing to have no bearing upon it, unsuspected
by you when not actually mistrusted by you. That your mistrust has
wounded me oftentimes and deeply would have weighed lightly with me
had I not perceived that by mistrusting you were deprived of that
consolation and hope which you would have found in trusting. The
facts afforded ever a justification of your mistrust. This I
recognized, and that facts are stubborn things not easily destroyed
by words. Therefore I did not vainly wear myself in any endeavour
to destroy them, but toiled on, so that in the ultimate achievement
of your selfless aims for your brother, the Marquis, I might prove
to you without the need of words the true impulse of my every
action in these past five years. The fame that came to me as a
condottiero, the honours I won and the increase of power they
brought me I have, never regarded as anything but weapons to be
employed in this your service, as means to the achievement of your
ends. But for that service accepted in this garden my life would
have been vastly different from all that it has been. No burden
heavier than a scholar's would have been mine, and today I might
well be back with the brethren at Cigliano, an obscure member of
their great brotherhood. To serve you I have employed trickery and
double-dealing, until men have dubbed me a rogue, and some, besides
yourself have come to mistrust me, and once I went the length of
doing murder.<br>
<br>
But I take no shame in any of these things nor, most dear lady,
need you take shame in that your service should have entailed them.
The murder I did was the execution of a rogue; the conspiracy I
scattered was one that would have made a net in which to take you;
the deceits I have put upon the Marquis Theodore, chiefly when I
made him serve my dear Lord Facino's turn and seduced him into
occupying Vercelli, so as subsequently to afford the Duke of Milan
a sound reason for moving against him, were deceits employed
against a deceiver whom it would be idle to combat in honest
fashion. In his eyes, more than any other's&mdash;for he is not the only
victim of the duplicity I have used to place you ultimately where
you should be&mdash;I am a double-dealing Judas. And it is said of me,
too, that in the field, as in the council, I prevail by subterfuge
and never by straightforward blows. But my conscience remains
tranquil. It is not what a man does or says that counts; but what a
man intends. I have embraced as a part of my guiding philosophy
that teaching of Polato's which discriminates between the lie on
the lips and the lie in the heart. On my lips and in my actions
lies have been employed. I confess it frankly. But in my heart no
lie has ever been. If I have employed at times dishonest means, at
least the purpose for which they have been employed has been
unfalteringly, unswervingly honest and one in the final achievement
of which there can be only pride and a sense of duty done.<br>
<br>
To this, if you believe it&mdash;and the facts will presently constrain
you to do so, unless my fortune in the field should presently
desert me&mdash;I need add no details of the many steps in your service.
By the light of faith in me from what is written and what is
presently to do, you will now read aright those details for
yourself.<br>
<br>
We touch now the goal whither all these efforts have been
addressed.</p>
<p>Upon this follows his concise account of the events from the
moment of his escape from Quinto, and upon that an injunction to
her to come at once with her brother to Casale, depending upon the
protection of his arm and the loyalty of a people which only
awaited the sight of its rightful prince to be increased to
enthusiasm and active support.</p>
<p>That letter was dispatched next day to Quinto, but it did not
reach her until almost a week later between Alessandria and
Casale.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, early on the morrow, the city was thrown into alarm
by the approach of a strong body of horse. This was Ugolino da
Tenda's condotto, and Ugolino himself rode in with a trumpeter to
make renewed submission to the Lord Bellarion and to give him news
of what had happened in Quinto upon the coming of Barbaresco.</p>
<p>Bellarion racked him with questions as to what was said,
particularly as to what the Princess said and how she looked, and
what passed between her and Carmagnola. And when all was done, far
from the stern reproaches Ugolino had been expecting, he found
himself embraced by a Bellarion more joyous than he had ever yet
known that sardonic soldier.</p>
<p>That gaiety of Bellarion's was observed by all in the days that
followed. He was a man transformed. He displayed the
light-heartedness of a boy, and moved about the manly tasks
claiming his attention with a song on his lips, a ready laugh upon
the slightest occasion, and a sparkle in his great eyes that all
had hitherto known so sombre.</p>
<p>And this notwithstanding that these were busy and even anxious
days of preparation for the final trial of strength. He rode abroad
during the day with two or three of his officers, one of whom was
always Stoffel, surveying the ground of the peninsula that lies
between Sesia and Po to the north of Casale, and at night he would
labour over maps which he was preparing from his daily notes.
Meanwhile he kept himself day by day informed by means of a line if
scouts which he had thrown out of what was happening at
Vercelli.</p>
<p>With that clear prescience, which in all ages has been the gift
of all great soldiers, he was able not merely to opine, but quite
definitely to state the course of action that Theodore would
pursue. Because of this, on the Wednesday of that week he moved
Ugolino da Tenda and his condotta out of Casale and transferred
them, bag and baggage&mdash;by night, so that the movement might not be
detected and reported to the enemy&mdash;to the woods about Trino, where
they were ordered to encamp and to lie close until required.</p>
<p>On the morning of Friday arrived at last in Casale the Marquis
Gian Giacomo and his sister, escorted by the band of Montferrine
exiles under Barbaresco and Casella, and the people turned out to
welcome not only the princes, but in many cases their own relatives
and friends. Bellarion, with his captains and a guard of honour of
fifty lances, received the princes at the Lombard Gate, and
escorted them to the palace, where their apartments had been
prepared.</p>
<p>The acclamations of the people lining the streets brought tears
to the eyes of the Princess and a flush to the cheeks of her
brother, and there were tears in her eyes when she sought Bellarion
in his room to abase herself in the admission of her grievous
misjudgment and to sue pardon.</p>
<p>"Your letter, sir," she told him, "touched me more deeply than
anything I can remember in all my life. Think me a fool, if you
must, for what is past, but not an ingrate. My brother shall prove
our gratitude so soon as ever it lies within his power."</p>
<p>"Madonna, I ask no proofs of it, nor need them. To serve you has
not been a means, but an end, as you shall see."</p>
<p>"That vision at least does not lie in the future. I see now, and
very clearly."</p>
<p>He smiled, a little wistfully, as he bowed to kiss her hand.</p>
<p>"You shall see more clearly still," he promised her.</p>
<p>That colloquy went no further. Stoffel broke in upon them to
announce that his scouts had come galloping in from Vercelli with
the news that the Lord Theodore had made a sally in force,
shattering a way through Carmagnola's besiegers, and that he was
advancing on Casale with a well-equipped army computed to be
between four and five thousand strong.</p>
<p>The news had already spread about the city and was causing
amongst the people the gravest apprehension and unrest. The
prospect of a siege and of the subsequent vengeance of the Lord
Theodore upon the city for having harboured his enemies filled them
with dread.</p>
<p>"Send out trumpeters," Bellarion ordered, "and let it be
proclaimed in every quarter that there will be no siege and that
the army is marching out at once to meet the Marquis Theodore
beyond the Po."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-14" id="ch-3-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. THE
VANQUISHED</h2>
<p>Theodore's sally from Vercelli had been made at daybreak on that
Friday morning. It had been shrewdly planned, for Theodore was no
bungler, and before he had brought more than half his men into
action, Carmagnola, startled by the suddenness of the blow that
fell upon him, was routed and in flight.</p>
<p>After that, this being no more than the preliminary of the task
before him, Theodore marched out every man of his following to go
against Bellarion at Casale. Thus by that ancient plan of attacking
a vital point that had been left undefended had Bellarion succeeded
in drawing his enemy from a point of less importance in which he
was almost impregnably entrenched. Theodore had perceived, as
Bellarion had calculated that he would, that it could serve little
purpose for him to hold an outpost like Vercelli if in the meantime
the whole of his dominions were to be wrenched from his grasp.</p>
<p>No sooner was he gone, however, than Carmagnola, informed of his
departure, rallied his broken troops, and with drums beating,
trumpets blaring and flags flying, marched like a conqueror into
the now undefended city of Vercelli. For the resistance it had
made, he subjected it to a cruel sack, giving his men unbounded
licence, and that same evening he wrote to Duke Filippo Maria in
the following terms:</p>
<p class="letter">Most Potent Duke and my Good Lord,<br>
<br>
It is my joyous task to give your highness tidings that, informed
of the reduction in our numbers resulting from the defection of the
Prince of Valsassina and several other captains acting in concert
with him, the Lord Theodore of Montferrat, greatly presumptuous,
did today issue from Vercelli for wager of battle against us. A
vigorous action was fought in the neighbourhood of Quinto, in
which, despite our inferior numbers, we put the Marquis to flight.
Lacking numbers sufficient to engage in pursuit, particularly as
this would have led us into Montferrine territory, and since the
re-occupation of Vercelli and its restoration to your duchy was the
task with which your highness entrusted us, I marched into the city
at once, and I now hold it in the name of your exalted potency. By
this complete and speedy victory I hope to merit the approbation of
your highness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Theodore's march on Casale had anything but the
aspect of a flight. The great siege train he dragged along with him
over the sodden and too-yielding ground of that moist plain delayed
his progress to such an extent that it was not until late on that
November afternoon when he reached Villanova, here to receive news
from his scouts that a considerable army, said to be commanded by
the Prince of Valsassina, was circling northward from
Terranova.</p>
<p>The news was unexpected and brought with it some alarm. He had
gone confidently and rather carelessly forward, fully expecting to
find the enemy shut up in Casale. Hence all the ponderous siege
train which had so hampered his progress. That Bellarion, forsaking
the advantage of Casale's stout walls, should come out to meet him
and engage him in the open was something beyond his dreams, and,
but for the unexpectedness of it, he would have rejoiced in such a
decision on the part of his redoubtable opponent.</p>
<p>It was in that unexpectedness, as usual, that lay Bellarion's
advantage. Theodore, compelled now to act in haste, not knowing at
what moment the enemy might be upon him, made dispositions to which
it was impossible to give that thought which the importance of the
issues demanded. The first of these was to order the men, who were
preparing to encamp for the night, to be up again and to push on
and out of this village before they found themselves hemmed into
it. That circling movement reported suggested this danger to
Theodore.</p>
<p>They came out in rather straggling order, to be marshalled even
as they marched. Theodore's aim&mdash;and it was shrewd enough&mdash;was to
reach the broad causeway of solid land between Corno and Popolo,
where marshlands on either side would secure his flanks, and compel
the enemy to engage him on a narrow front. What was to follow he
had not yet had time to consider. But if he could reach that
objective he would be secure for the present, and he could rest his
men in the two hamlets on the marshes.</p>
<p>But a mile beyond Villanova, Bellarion was upon his left flank
and rear. He had little warning of it before the enemy was charging
him. But it was warning enough. He threw out his line in a crescent
formation using his infantry in a manner which merited Bellarion's
entire approval, and obviously intent upon fighting a rearguard
battle whilst bringing his army to the coveted position.</p>
<p>But the infantry were not equal to their commander, and they
were insufficiently trained in these tactics. Some horses were
piked, but almost every horse piked meant an opening in the human
wall that opposed the charge, and through these openings Giasone
Trotta's heavy riders broke in, swinging their ponderous maces.
From a rearguard action on Theodore's part, the thing grew rapidly
to the proportions of a general engagement, and for this Theodore
could not have been placed worse than he was with his left, now
that he had swung about upon the quaking boglands of Dalmazzo and
his back to the broad waters of the Po. He swung his troops farther
round, so as to bring in his rear upon the only possible line of
retreat, which was that broad firm land between Corno and Popolo.
At last his skilful manoeuvres achieved the desired result, and
then, very gradually, fighting every inch of the way, he began to
fall back. At every yard now the front must grow narrower, and
unless Bellarion's captains were very sure of their ground some of
them would presently be in trouble in the bogs on either side. If
this did not happen, they would soon find it impossible, save at
great cost and without perceptible progress, to continue the
engagement; and with night approaching they would be constrained to
draw off. Theodore smiled darkly to himself in satisfaction and
took heart, well pleased with his clever tactics by which he had
extricated himself from a dangerous situation. He had won a
breathing-space that should enable him to marshal his men so as to
deal with this rash enemy who came to seek him in the open.</p>
<p>And then suddenly, a quarter-mile away from the direction of
Corno, towards which they were so steadily falling back, came a
pounding of hooves that swelled swiftly into a noise of thunder,
and before any measures could be taken to meet this new menace
Ugolino da Tenda's horse was upon Theodore's rear.</p>
<p>Ugolino had handled his condotta well, and strictly in
accordance with his orders from Bellarion. From Balzola, whither he
had been moved at noon, so as to be in readiness, he had made a
leisurely and cautious advance, filing his horse along the very
edge of the bogland so that their hooves should give no warning of
their approach. Thus until he had won within striking distance. And
the blow he now struck, heavy and unexpected, crumpled up
Theodore's rear, clove through, driving his men right and left to
sink to their waist in the marshes, and scattered such fear and
confusion in those ahead that their formation went to pieces and
gaped to Bellarion's renewed frontal attacks.</p>
<p>Less than three hours that engagement lasted, and of all those
who had taken the field with Theodore, saving perhaps a thousand
who fled helter-skelter towards Trino after Ugolino's passage,
there was not a survivor who had not yielded. Stripped of their
arms and deprived of their horses, they were turned adrift, to go
whithersoever they listed so long as it was the outside of
Montferrat territory. The maimed and wounded of Theodore's army
were conveyed by their fellows into the villages of Villanova,
Terranova and Grassi.</p>
<p>It was towards the third hour of that November night when the
triumphant army returned from that stricken field, re-entered
Casale, lighted by the bonfires that blazed in the streets, whilst
the bells of Liutprand's Cathedral crashed out their peals of
victory. Deliriously did the populace acclaim Bellarion, Prince of
Valsassina, in its enormous relief at being saved the hardships of
a siege and delivered from the possible vengeance of Theodore for
having opened its gates to Theodore's enemies.</p>
<p>Theodore, on foot, marched proudly at the head of a little band
of captives of rank, who had been retained by their captors for the
sake of the ransoms they could pay. The jostling, pushing crowd
hooted and execrated and mocked him as he passed by in his hour of
humiliation. White-faced, his head held high, he passed on,
apparently unmoved by that expression of human baseness, knowing in
his heart that if he had prove master the acclamations now raised
for his conqueror would have been raised for him by the very lips
that now execrated him.</p>
<p>He was conducted to the palace, to the very room whence for so
many years he had ruled the State of Montferrat, and there he found
his nephew and niece awaiting him when he was brought in between
Ugolino da Tenda and Giasone Trotta.</p>
<p>Bareheaded, stripped of his armour, his tall figure bowed, he
stood like a criminal before them, whilst they remained seated on
either side of the writing-table that once had been his own. From
the seat whence he had dispensed justice was justice now to be
dispensed to him by his nephew.</p>
<p>"You know your offence, my lord," Gian Giacomo greeted him, a
cold, dignified and virile Gian Giacomo, in whom it was hardly
possible to recognize the boy whom he had sought to ruin in body
and in soul. "You know how you have been false to the trust reposed
in you by my father, to whom God give peace. Have you anything to
say in extenuation?"</p>
<p>He parted his lips, then stood there opening and closing his
hands before he could sufficiently control himself to answer.</p>
<p>"In the hour of defeat what can I do but cast myself upon your
mercy?"</p>
<p>"Are we to pity you in defeat? Are we to forget in what you have
been defeated?"</p>
<p>"I ask not that. I am in your hands a captive&mdash;helpless. I do
not claim mercy. I may not deserve it. I hope for it. That is
all."</p>
<p>They considered him and found him a broken man indeed.</p>
<p>"It is not for me to judge you," said Gian Giacomo, "and I am
glad to be relieved of that responsibility. For though you may have
forgotten that I am of your blood, I cannot forget that you are of
mine. Where is his highness of Valsassina?"</p>
<p>Theodore fell back a pace. "Will you set me at the mercy of that
dastard?"</p>
<p>The Princess Valeria looked at him coldly. "He has won many
titles since the day when, to fight a villainy, he pretended to
become your spy. But the title you have just conferred upon him,
coming from your lips, is the highest he has yet received. To be a
dastard in the sight of a dastard is to be honourable in the sight
of all upright men."</p>
<p>Theodore's white face writhed into a smile of malice. But he
answered nothing in the little pause that followed before the door
opened upon Bellarion.</p>
<p>He came in supported by two of his Swiss, and closely followed
by Stoffel. His armour had been removed, and the right sleeve of
his leather hacketon, as of the silken tunic and shirt beneath, had
been ripped up and now hung empty at his side, whilst his breast
bulged where his arm was strapped to his body. He was very pale and
obviously weak and in pain.</p>
<p>Valeria came to her feet at sight of him thus, and her face was
whiter than his own.</p>
<p>"You are wounded, my lord!"</p>
<p>He smiled rather whimsically. "It sometimes happens when men go
to battle. But I think my Lord Theodore here has taken the deeper
hurt."</p>
<p>Stoffel pushed forward a chair, and the Swiss carefully lowered
Bellarion to it. He sighed in relief, and leaned forward so as to
avoid contact with the back.</p>
<p>"One of your knights, my lord, broke my shoulder in the last
charge."</p>
<p>"I would he had broken your neck."</p>
<p>"That was the intention." Bellarion's pale lips smiled. "But I
am known as Bellarion the Fortunate."</p>
<p>"Just now my lord had another name for you," said Valeria, and
Bellarion, observing the set of her lips and the scorn in her
glance as it flickered over Theodore, marvelled at the power of
hate in one naturally so gracious. He had had a taste of it
himself, he remembered, and perhaps she was but passing on to
Theodore what rightly had belonged to him throughout. "He is a rash
man," she continued, "who will not trouble to conciliate the
arbiter of his fate. My Lord Theodore has lost his guile I think,
together with the rest."</p>
<p>"Ay," said Bellarion, "we have stripped him of all save his
life. Even his mask of benignity is gone."</p>
<p>"You are noble!" said Theodore. "You gird at a captive. Am I to
remain here to be mocked?"</p>
<p>"Not for me, faith," Bellarion answered him. "I have never
contemplated you with any pleasure. Take him away, Ugolino. Place
him securely under guard. He shall have judgment tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Dog!" said Theodore with venom, as he drew himself up to
depart.</p>
<p>"That's my device, as yours is the stag. Appropriate, all things
considered. I had you in my mind when I adopted it."</p>
<p>"I am punished for my weakness," said Theodore. "I should have
left Justice to wring your neck when you were its prisoner here in
Casale."</p>
<p>"I'll repay the debt," Bellarion answered him. "Your own neck
shall remain unwrung so that you withdraw to your Principality of
Genoa and abide there. More of that tomorrow."</p>
<p>Peremptorily he waved him away, and Ugolino hustled him out. As
the door closed again, Bellarion, relaxing the reins of his will,
sank forward in a swoon.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-3-15" id="ch-3-15"></a>CHAPTER XV. THE LAST
FIGHT</h2>
<p>When he recovered he was lying on his sound side on a couch
under the window, across which the curtains of painted and gilded
leather had been drawn.</p>
<p>An elderly bearded man in black was observing him, and someone
whom he could not see was bathing his brow with a cool aromatic
liquid. As he fetched a sigh that filled his lungs and quickened
his senses into full consciousness, the man smiled.</p>
<p>"There! It will be well with him now. But he should be put to
bed."</p>
<p>"It shall be done," said the woman who was bathing his brow, and
her voice, soft and subdued, was the voice of the Princess Valeria.
"His servants will be below by now. Send them to me as you go."</p>
<p>The man bowed and went out. Slowly Bellarion turned his head and
looked up in wonder at the Princess, with whom he was now alone.
Her eyes, more liquid than their wont, smiled wistfully down upon
him.</p>
<p>"Madonna!" he exclaimed. "Do you serve me as a handmaid? That is
not&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You are thinking it an insufficient return for your service to
me. But you must give me time, sir; this is only a beginning."</p>
<p>"I am not thinking that at all."</p>
<p>"Then you are not thinking as you should. You are weak. Your
wits work slowly. Else you might remember that for five years in
which you have been my loyal, noble, unswerving friend, I, immured
in my stupidity, have been your enemy."</p>
<p>"Ah!" He smiled. "I knew I should convince you in the end. Such
knowledge gives us patience. A man may contain his soul for
anything that is assured. It is the doubtful only that makes him
fret and fume."</p>
<p>"And you never doubted?" she asked him, wondering.</p>
<p>"I am too sure of myself," he answered.</p>
<p>"And God knows you have cause to be; more cause than any man of
whom ever I heard tell. Do you know, Lord Prince, that in these
five years there is no evil I have not believed of you. I even
deemed you a coward, on the word of that vain boaster,
Carmagnola."</p>
<p>"He was none so wrong, by his own lights. I am not a fighter of
his pattern. I have ever been careful of myself."</p>
<p>"Your condition now proves that."</p>
<p>"Oh, this, today...That was different. Too much depended on the
issue. It was the last throw. I had to take a hand, much though I
dislike a rough-and-tumble. So that we won through, it would not
have mattered if the vamplate of that fellow's lance had brought up
against my throat. There are no more fights for me, so what matter
if I left my life in the last one?"</p>
<p>"The last one, Lord Prince!"</p>
<p>"And that is not my title any more. I am a prince no longer. I
leave the rank behind with all the other vanities of the
world."</p>
<p>"You leave it behind?" She found him obscure.</p>
<p>"When I go back to Cigliano, which will be as soon as I can
move."</p>
<p>"What do you go to do at Cigliano?"</p>
<p>"What? Why, what the other brethren do. Pax multa in cella. The
old abbot was right. There is yonder a peace for which I am craving
now that my one task here is safely ended. In the world there is
nothing for me."</p>
<p>"Nothing!" She was amazed. "And in five years you have won so
much."</p>
<p>"Nothing that I covet," he answered gently. "It is all vanity;
all madness, greed and bloodlust. I was not made for worldliness,
and but for you I should never have shown it. Now I have done."</p>
<p>"And your dominions&mdash;Gavi and Valsassina?"</p>
<p>"I'll bestow them upon you, Madonna, if you will deign to accept
a parting gift from these hands."</p>
<p>There was a long pause. She had drawn back a little. He could
not see her face. "You have the fever, I think," she said presently
in an odd voice. "It is your hurt."</p>
<p>He sighed. "Ay, you would think so. It is difficult for one
reared in the world to understand that a man's eyes should remain
undazzled by its glitter. Yet, believe me, I leave it with but one
regret."</p>
<p>"And that?" The question came breathlessly upon a whisper.</p>
<p>"That the purpose for which I entered it remains unfulfilled.
That I have learnt no Greek."</p>
<p>Again there was a pause. Then she moved forward, rustling a
little, and came directly into his line of vision.</p>
<p>"I hear your servants, I think. I will leave you now."</p>
<p>"I thank you, Madonna. God be with you."</p>
<p>But she did not go. She stood there between himself and the
fireplace, slight and straight as on the first evening when he had
seen her in her garden. She was dressed in a close-fitting gown of
cloth of silver. He observed in particular now the tight sleeves
which descended to the knuckles of her slim tapering hands, and
remembered that just such sleeves had she worn when first his eyes
beheld her. Over this gown she wore a loose houppelande of sapphire
velvet, reversed at throat, and wide gaping sleeves with ermine.
And there were sapphires in the silver caul that confined her
abundant red-gold hair.</p>
<p>"Ay," he said wistfully, dreamily. "It was just so you looked,
and just so will I remember you as long as I remember anything. It
is good to have served you, lady mine. It has made me glorious in
my own eyes."</p>
<p>"You have made yourself glorious, Lord Prince, in the eyes of
all."</p>
<p>"What do they matter?"</p>
<p>Slowly she came back to him. She was very pale, and a little
frown was puckering her fine brows. Very wistful and mysterious as
deep pools were those dark eyes of hers. She came back, drawn by
the words he had used, and, more than the words, by something odd
in his gentle musing tone.</p>
<p>"Do I matter nothing, Bellarion?"</p>
<p>He smiled with an infinite sadness. "Must you ask that now? Does
not the whole of my life in the world give you the answer, that
never woman mattered more to a man? I have known no service but
yours. And I have served you&mdash;per fas et nefat."</p>
<p>She stood above him, and her lips quivered. What she said when
at last she spoke had no apparent bearing upon the subject.</p>
<p>"I am wearing your colours, Bellarion."</p>
<p>Surprise flickered in his eyes, as they sought confirmation of
her statement in the azure and argent of her wear.</p>
<p>"And I did not remark the chance," he cried.</p>
<p>"Not chance. It is design."</p>
<p>"It was sweetly and generously courteous so to honour me."</p>
<p>"It was not only to honour you that I assumed these colours.
Have they no message for you, Bellarion?"</p>
<p>"Message?" For the first time in their acquaintance she saw fear
in his bold eyes.</p>
<p>"Clearly they have not; no message that you look for. You have
said that you covet nothing in this world."</p>
<p>"Nothing within my reach. To covet things beyond it is to taste
the full bitterness of life."</p>
<p>"Is there anything in the world that is not within your reach,
Bellarion?"</p>
<p>He looked at her as she smiled down upon him through her tears.
He caught his breath gaspingly. With his sound left hand he
clutched her left, which hung at the level of his head.</p>
<p>"I am mad, of course," he choked.</p>
<p>"Not mad, Bellarion. Only stupid. Do you still covet
nothing?"</p>
<p>"Ay, one thing!" His face glowed. "One thing that would change
into a living glory the tinsel glitter of the world; one thing that
would make life...God! What am I saying?"</p>
<p>"Why do you break off, Bellarion?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid!"</p>
<p>"Of me? Is there anything I could deny you, who have given all
to serve me? Must I in return offer you all I have? Can you claim
nothing for yourself?"</p>
<p>"Valeria!"</p>
<p>She stooped to kiss his lips. "My very hate of you in all these
years was love dissembled. Because my spirit leapt to yours, almost
from that first evening in the garden there, did it so wound and
torture me to discover baseness in you. I should have trusted my
own heart rather than my erring senses, Bellarion. You warned me
early that I am not good at inference. I have suffered as those
suffer who are in rebellion against themselves."</p>
<p>He pondered her, very pale and sorrowful. "Yes," he said slowly,
"I have the fever, as you said a while ago. It must be that."</p>
