<h2><a id="note"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h2>

<p class="first">ARTHUR LEO ZAGAT'S classic science fiction fantasy <i>Seven Out of Time</i> was originally published as a 6-part serial in <i>Argosy</i> in 1939.</p>

<p>This PGA edition is based on the version of the novel published in book form by Fantasy Press, Pennylvania, ten years later. This version included numerous textual changes. The book contains 28 chapters&mdash;one more than the serial, and most of them were renamed. Here are the two tables of contents for comparison.</p>

<p style="text-align:right">&mdash; Roy Glashan, 20 January 2020</p>


<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">1. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE</a></h2>

<p class="first">"You have not found Evelyn Rand."</p>

<p>"No sir," I agreed. "But I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No excuses, Mr. March." The office was enormous, the desk
massive, but sitting behind the latter Pierpont Alton Sturdevant
dominated both. Not because of any physical quality. He was below
average in stature nor did his graying hair have the patches of
white at the temples that fiction writers and the illustrators of
advertisements seem to think are the invariable mark of 'men of
distinction.' It was rather his hawk's nose and the sexless
austerity of his thin mouth that made me think of him as
resembling some Roman Emperor, and myself, a very junior attorney
on the staff of the august firm of Sturdevant, Hamlin, Mosby and
Garfield, as some young centurion returned from Ulterior Gaul.
"You should know by this time," the dry voice rustled, "that I am
not interested in excuses, but only in facts."</p>

<p>I had, in truth, just returned to the city, from the remote
reaches of suburban Westchester, and what I had to report was
failure. "The fact is, sir, that I have not found Evelyn
Rand."</p>

<p>Sturdevant was very still, looking at me in the huge leather
armchair to which he'd motioned me with a terse, 'Good morning.'
He was expressionless and still for a long moment and then he
asked, "If you continue searching for her, how soon do you think
you will be able to locate her?"</p>

<p>I didn't like that if. I didn't like it at all but I contrived
to keep my dismay out of my face and my voice. "I can't say, Mr.
Sturdevant. I haven't been able to unearth a single clue as to
what happened to her." The girl had walked out of her Park Avenue
apartment house that Sunday morning, two weeks ago yesterday, and
vanished. "The doorman seems to have been the last person ever to
see her. He offered to call a taxi for her and she said that she
would walk to church. He watched her go down the block and around
the corner."</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p class="first"><i>"I could not take my eyes off the lass," the
grizzled attendant had told me, "though my 'phone was buzzing
like mad. She swung along freelike an' springy like as if it was
the ould sod was under her feet ate not this gray cancrete that
chokes the good dirt. I was minded o' the way my own Kathleen
used to come up Balmorey Lane to meet me after work was done,
longer ago than I care to think."</i> </p>

<p><i>By the way he spoke and the look in his faded eyes, I knew
I needed only to tell him what it would mean to Evelyn Rand if
the fact that she had never returned&mdash;never been seen again,
got out, to keep him silent. And so it had been with the elevator
boy who had brought her down from her penthouse home and with the
servants she had there; the granite-faced butler, the buxom cook,
Renee Bernos, the black-haired and vivacious maid. Each of them
would go to prison for life sooner than say a single word that
might harm her. Nor was this because she was generous with her
wages and her tips. One cannot buy love.</i> </p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p class="first">"That is all you have been able to discover,"
Sturdevant pressed me.</p>

<p>"That is all."</p>

<p>"In other words you are precisely where you were two weeks
ago," he murmured, "except for this." He turned a paper on his
desk so that I could see it, then tapped it with a long, bony
finger. "Except, Mr. March, for this."</p>

<br>

<p class="cp"><span class="smcap">ESTATE OF DARIUS RAND in the MATTER OF EVELYN RAND,<br>
debtor to STURDEVANT, HAMLIN AND STURDEVANT.</span></p>

<br>

<pre style="font-size:1.6em; font-weight:bold; margin-left:20%">

</pre>

<p><br>
"Two thousand, four hundred and seventy dollars and sixty-two
cents," Sturdevant's finger tapped the total, "up to last
Saturday. To which must be added the charge for this quarter hour
of my time and yours, plus whatever you have spent over the
weekend. Two and a half thousand dollars, Mr. March, and no
result."</p>

<p>He paused but I said nothing. I was waiting for what he would
say next.</p>

<p>He said it. "As trustee of the Estate of Darius Rand I cannot
approve any further expenditure. You will return to your regular
duties, Mr. March, and I shall notify the police that Miss Rand
has disappeared."</p>

<p>And that was when I lost my grip on myself&mdash;"No!" I
fairly yelled as I came up to my feet. "You can't do that to
her." He wasn't the Head of the Firm to me in that moment. He was
a shrivelled old curmudgeon whose scrawny neck I lusted to wring.
"You can't make her a pauper. You don't know what you're
doing."</p>

<p>I stopped. Not by reason of anything Sturdevant said or did,
for he said or did nothing. I don't know how he made me aware I
was making a fool of myself, but he did.</p>

<p>And now he said, quietly, "I know exactly what I am doing. I
know better than you do that because of the embarrassment his
actress wife had caused him, before she died, by trailing her
escapades through the newspapers, Darius Rand's will tied up his
fortune in a trust fund the income of which goes to his daughter
Evelyn only as long as her name never appears for any reason
whatsoever in the news columns of the public press. When she
vanished I determined as her legal guardian to conceal the
situation for a reasonable length of time since a report to the
police must inevitably bring her name into the newspapers. That
reasonable time has in my opinion now expired without any hope of
her return and I no longer can justify my silence. Therefore, as
trustee of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Estate of Darius Rand," I broke in. "You're measuring the
happiness of a girl against dollars and cents."</p>

<p>The faint shadow that clouded Sturdevant's ascetic countenance
might mean I'd gotten under his skin but his answer did not admit
it.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. March. I am measuring a sentimental attachment to a
young lady over whose welfare I have watched for more than six
years against the dictates of duty and conscience."</p>

<p>"Aren't there times, sir, when one may compromise a bit with
duty and even conscience?" Not him, I thought. Not this dried
mummy, but I had to try to persuade him. "Give me a week more.
Just the week. I'll take a leave of absence without pay, I'll
even resign, so you won't have to charge the Estate for my time.
I'll pay the expenses out of my own pocket. If you'll only keep
this thing away from the police and the papers for a week I'll
find Evelyn. I'm sure I will."</p>

<p>Gray eyebrows arched minutely. "It seems to me that you are
oddly concerned," Sturdevant mused, "with a young lady whom you
have never seen, whom you never even heard of up to fourteen days
ago. Or am I mistaken in that?"</p>

<p>"No," I admitted. "Fourteen days ago I was not aware that
Evelyn Rand existed. But today," I leaned forward, palms pressing
hard on the desktop, "today I think I know her better even than I
know myself. I know her emotional makeup, how she would react in
any conceivable situation. I have literally steeped myself in her
personality. I have spent hours in her home, her library, her
boudoir. I have talked on one pretext or another with everyone
who was close to her; her servants, her dressmaker, her
hairdresser. I know that her hair is the color of honey and
exactly how she wears it. I know that she favors light blues in
her dress and pastel tones of pink and green. I have even smelled
the perfume she had especially compounded for her."</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p class="first"><i>In his little shop on East Sixty-third
Street, the walrus-mustached old German in the long chemist's
smock had looked long and uncertainly at me. "Ich weiss
nicht&mdash;" he muttered.</i> </p>

<p>"You say a friend from Fraulein Rand you are und a bottle from
her individual perfoom you want to buy her for a present. Aber I
don't know. Ven I say so schoen ein maedchen many loffers must
haff, she laughs und says she hass none. She says dot ven someone
she finds who can say to her so true tings about her as dot I say
in der perfoom I make for her, den she vill haff found her loffer
but such a one she hass not yet met."</p>

<p>"Look," I argued. "Would I know the number of the formula if
she had not told it to me?"</p>

<p>It was from Renee Bernos I had gotten it, but the German was
convinced. When I opened the tiny bottle he'd sold me for enough
to have fed a slum family a month, my dreary hotel room was
filled with the fragrance of spring; of arbutus and crocuses and
hyacinths and the evasive scent of leaf-buds; and with another
fainter redolence I could not name but that was the very essence
of dreams.</p>

<p><i>For a moment it had seemed almost is if Evelyn Rand herself
was there in my room...</i> </p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p class="first">"Ah," Sturdevant murmured. "What did you hope to
accomplish by so strange a procedure?"</p>

<p>"I figured that if I could understand her, if I could get
inside her mind somehow, I should know exactly what was in it
when she walked down Park Avenue to Seventy-third Street and
turned the corner and never reached the church for which
apparently she had set out."</p>

<p>"Is that all you've done in two weeks?"</p>

<p>"This weekend I went out to the house in which Evelyn's
childhood was spent. It is closed, of course, but I got the keys
from your secretary. I spent most of Saturday in that house and
all of yesterday."</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p class="first"><i>The other rooms had told me nothing about
Evelyn Rand, and now I was in the last one, the nursery. It was
dim and dusty and musty-smelling, for it had been closed and
never again entered after a little girl of six had been sent to
boarding school because her mother had no time to be bothered
with her.</i> </p>

<p>I pulled out a bureau drawer too far. It fell to the floor and
split and that was how I found the thing that had slipped into
the crack between the drawer's side and its warped bottom, at
least fourteen years ago.</p>

<p>As my fingers closed on the bit of carved stone that lay in a
clutter of doll's clothes, battered toys and mummified insects,
something seemed to flow from it and into me; a vague
excitement.</p>

<p>And a vaguer fear.</p>

<p>It was slightly smaller than a dime, approximately an eighth
of an inch thick and roughly circular in outline and there was,
strangely enough, no dust upon it. It was black, a peculiar,
glowing black that though utterly unrelieved appeared to shimmer
with a colorless iridescence so that almost it seemed I held in
my palm a bit of black light strangely solid. Too, it was
incongruously heavy for its size, and when on impulse I tested
it, I found it hard enough to scratch glass.</p>

<p>The latter circumstance made more remarkable the
accomplishment of the artist who had fashioned the gem. For it
was not a solid mass with a design etched seal-like upon it, but
a filigree of ebony coils that rose to its surface and descended
within its small compass and writhed again into view 'til the eye
grew weary of following the Findings.</p>

<p>Close-packed and intricate as were the thread-thin loops, they
formed a single continuous line. True, two or three of the coils
were interrupted at one point in the periphery by a wedge-shaped
gap about an eighth of an inch deep, but the rough edges of the
break made it obvious that this was the result of some later
accident and not a Part of the original intent.</p>

<p>I could not bring myself to believe that any human could have
had the skill and the infinite patience to have carved this out
of a single piece of whatever the stone was. It must have been
made in parts and cemented together. I bent closer to see if I
could find some seam, some evidence of jointure.</p>

<p>I saw none. But I saw the snake's head.</p>

<p>Almost microscopically small yet exquisitely fashioned, it lay
midway between the gem's slightly convex surfaces, at its very
center. I made out the lidless eyes, the nostrils, the muscles at
the corners of the distended mouth.</p>

<p>To avoid any interruption of the design, as I then thought,
the reptile had been carved as swallowing its own tail.</p>

<p><i>A strange, weird toy for a little girl, I thought, and put
it away in my vest pocket meaning to fathom out later what it
could tell me about Evelyn Rand.</i> </p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p class="first">"You seem to have been making a good thing of
your assignment," Pierpont Alton Sturdevant remarked, "wangling a
week-end in the country out of it, at the Estate's expense."</p>

<p>I felt my face flush and anger pound my temples but if I said
what I wanted to, what faint chance there was of persuading him
to delay reporting Evelyn's disappearance would be lost. I
swallowed, said, "I also talked to the woman who was Evelyn
Rand's nurse and with whom she spent the summer before you sent
her to college."</p>

<p>"And what did you learn from Faith Corbett?" For the first
time a note of interest crept into his voice although his face
still was an expressionless Roman mask. "What did you learn from
Evelyn's old nurse?"</p>

<p>What I had learned he would not understand. "Nothing," I
answered him. "Nothing that I can put into words."</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p class="first"><i>Faith Corbett, so shrunken and fragile it
seemed she was one with the shadows of her tiny cottage, had
asked me in for a cup of tea. "Evelyn was a dear child," her
tenuous voice mused as the scrubbed kitchen grew misty with
winter's early dusk, "but sometimes I was frightened of her. I
would hear her prattling in the nursery and when I opened the
door she would be quite alone, but she would look up at me with
those great, gray eyes of hers and gravely say that so-and-so had
been there just now, and it would be a name I had never
heard."</i> </p>

<p>"Oh," I said. "She was just an imaginative child. And she was
always alone except for you and so dreamed up playmates for
herself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," the old woman agreed, "but she was no child that
summer she stayed here with me, and what happened the day before
she went away I did not understand and I will never forget."</p>

<p>She took a nibble of toast and a sip of tea and though I
waited silently for her to go on, she did not. Her thoughts had
wandered from what she'd been saying, as old people's thoughts
have a way of doing. "What was it?" I called them back. "What
happened the day before Evelyn went away to college?"</p>

<p>"I was packing her trunk," the old lady mused. "I could not
find her tennis shoes so I went downstairs to ask her what she
had done with them. Evelyn was not in the house, but when I went
out to the porch I saw her on the garden path. She was going
toward the gate through the twilight, and there was an eagerness
in the way she moved that was new to her.</p>

<p>"I stood and watched, my heart fluttering in my breast, for I
knew there was no youngster about that ever had had so much as a
second glance from my sweet. She came to the gate and stopped
there, taking hold of the pickets with her hands. Like a quiet
white flame she was as she looked down the road.</p>

<p>"They had not put the macadam on it yet and the dust lay
glimmering in the dimness. All of a sudden Evelyn got stiff-like
and I looked to see who was coming.</p>

<p>"The road was as empty and still as it had been before, and
there was no one upon it.</p>

<p>"The air was smoky, kind of, like it gets in the fall and
there wasn't a leaf stirring, but there must have been a breath
of wind on the road 'cause I saw a little whirl of dust come
drifting along it. When it came to the gate where Evelyn was, it
almost stopped. But it whispered away, and all at once it was
gone.</p>

<p>"All the eagerness was out of Evelyn. I heard her sob and I
ran down the path calling her name. She turned. There were tears
on her cheeks. 'Not yet', she sobbed. 'Oh Faith! It isn't time
yet.'"</p>

<p><i>"'It isn't time for what?' I asked her, but she would say
nothing more and I knew it was no use to ask again. And the next
day she went away</i>..."</p>

<p><i>Faith Corbett's voice went on and on about how she rented
this cottage with the pension the Estate granted her and how it
was hard to live alone, but I heard her with only half an ear. I
was thinking of how in that smoky fall twilight it had seemed to
Faith Corbett as if Evelyn Rand were going down through the
garden to meet her lover, and I was recalling how the grizzled
old doorman had said, 'I was minded a' the way my Kathleen used
to walk up Balmorey Lane to meet me.' And trailing across my
brain had been the frightening thought that perhaps when Evelyn
Rand had turned the corner into Seventy-third Street a whirl of
dust might have come whispering across the asphalt...</i> </p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p class="first">"You learned nothing at all from Evelyn's old
nurse?" Sturdevant insisted. "I cannot quite believe that."</p>

<p>"Well," I conceded, "she did make me certain the girl was
unhappy and lonely in that motherless home of hers. But, as an
imaginative child will, she found ways of consoling herself."</p>

<p>"Such as?"</p>

<p>"Such as writing verse." I indicated the yellowed papers I had
laid on Sturdevant's desk when I came in.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p class="first"><i>The only light left in the cottage kitchen
had been the wavering radiance of the coal fire in the range. So
much talking had tired Faith Corbett and she nodded in her chair,
all but asleep.</i> </p>

<p>"Thank you for the tea," I said rising. "I'll be going along
now."</p>

<p>The old woman came awake with a start. "Wait," she exclaimed.
"Wait! I have something to show you. Something nobody but me has
ever seen before." She rose too and went out of the room, the
sound of her feet on the clean boards like the patter of a
child's feet except that it was slower. I stood waiting and
wondering, and in a little while she was back with a number of
yellowed papers in her hand, pencilled writing pale and smudged
upon them.</p>

<p>"Here," she said, giving them to me. "Maybe they will help you
find her."</p>

<p><i>The papers rustled in my hand. I had been very careful to
conceal from Faith Corbett the object of my visit and I was
wondering how she could possibly know Evelyn Rand had
vanished.</i> </p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p class="first">"Verse?" Sturdevant peered at the sheets as he
might have looked at something slightly distasteful. "Poems?"</p>

<p>Eager as I was to pierce the dry husk of rectitude in which he
was encased, I had sense enough to retreat from my intention of
reading to him, in that great room with its drape-smothered
windows and its walls lined by drab law books, the lines a child
had penned in a sun-bright garden. He would hear the limping
rhythm and the faulty rhymes; he never would understand the
wistful imagery of the words, the nostalgia for some vaguely
apprehended Otherland where all was different and being different
must be happier.</p>

<p>"Poems," I assented. "They have told me more than anything
else exactly what Evelyn Rand is like."</p>

<p>"And so it has cost the Estate almost two and a half thousand
dollars to find out that Evelyn Rand once wrote poems. You
haven't even located a photograph of her, so that I can give the
authorities more to go by than a word of mouth description."</p>

<p>As far as anyone knew Evelyn never had been photographed. But,
"I've done better than that," I said, triumphantly. "I've found
out that a portrait of her is in existence, painted by&mdash;" I
named a very famous artist but shall not, for reasons that
shortly appear, repeat that name here.</p>

<p>"Indeed. Why did you not bring that portrait here instead of
these?" He flicked a contemptuous finger at the sheaf of old
papers. "Why did you not bring it here, Mr. March?"</p>

<p>"Because it is in a gallery on Madison Avenue. I intend to go
there as soon as you finish with me and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sturdevant's frosty look checked me. "You seem to forget, Mr.
March, that I have cancelled your assignment to this matter."</p>

<p>There it was. I hadn't changed his decision in the least. My
disappointment was too keen for speech for an instant, and in
that instant the Call-O-Vox on his desk grated, with its metallic
distortion of human tones: "Nine-thirty, Mr. Sturdevant. Mr.
Holland of United States Steel is here for his appointment."</p>

<p>Sturdevant clicked the switch that permitted his secretary to
hear him. "Send Mr. Holland in, Miss Carter. And please make a
note. John March has been granted a leave of absence without pay
for one week from date. This office will do nothing in the matter
of Evelyn Rand until Monday the twenty-first."</p>

<p>He turned to me and I swear that there was a twinkle in his
eyes. "Do not forget, Mr. March," he said, using a well-worn
lawyer's phrase, "that time is of the essence of this
contract."</p>

<p>I was to recall that warning, but in a sense far different
from that which he intended.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">2. THE PORTRAIT OF EVELYN RAND</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Art lovers are not as a rule early risers, and
so after I had purchased a catalogue from the drowsy Cerberus in
the foyer and passed through the red plush portieres before which
he sat, I had the high-ceiled exhibition room to myself.</p>

<p>Shaded, tubular lights washing the surfaces of the paintings
on the walls accentuated the dimness that filled the reaches of
the gallery. A decorous hush brooded here; the thick, soft
carpeting muffling the sound of my feet, close-drawn window
drapes smothering traffic noise from without. I passed a circular
seat in the center of the floor and saw Evelyn Rand looking at me
from the further wall.</p>

<p>Although I had never seen her pictured anywhere, as sure was I
that this was the portrait I had come to see that I did not took
at the gray catalogue I'd picked up at the door but went right to
it.</p>

<p>I was aware only of her face at first, ethereal and some how
luminous against the dark amorphous background the artist had
chosen to give her. It seemed to me that there was a message for
me in the gray, frank eyes that met mine, message somewhere
beneath their surface. It almost seemed to me that the satin-soft
red lips were on the point of speaking.</p>

<p>Those lips were touched with a wistful smile, and there was
something sad about them. Somehow the portraitist had contrived
to make very real the glow of youth in the damask cheeks, the
lustre of girlhood in the honeyed texture of the hair, but there
was, too, something ageless about that face, and a yearning that
woke a responsive ache within me.</p>

<p>Yes, this girl could have written the poems that were locked
now in a drawer of my own desk. Yes, she would be loved by
everyone who had the good fortune to know her.</p>

<p>She must have been about sixteen at the time of the portrait.
The body one sensed within the gossamer frock, a misty blue such
as tinctures the sky when it is lightly brushed with cloud, was
just burgeoning into womanhood. The hollows at the base of the
neck were not quite yet filled.</p>

<p>A fine gold chain circled that neck and pendant from it was a
black gem, replica of the one I'd found in the nursery. There
had, then, been two of them. Odd! I looked closer. I was not
mistaken. The edge of the painted amulet was marred by a wedge-
shaped break. But the same accident could not have marred two
artifacts in precisely the same way. Nor could the one in the
portrait be the same as that I had found in the nursery. The
Evelyn Rand painted here was at least sixteen as I've said and
when she'd sat for the portrait the black stone I'd found had
been lost and locked behind a door that had not been opened for
almost ten years.</p>

<p>I was wrong, of course, in thinking the breaks were exactly
matched. I must be wrong, yet it was with curious reluctance that
I fished the gem I'd found out of my vest pocket.</p>

<p>It was the same. It was precisely the same as the one in the
portrait.</p>

<p>The stroke of a tower clock came dully into the dim gallery.
<i>Bonn-n-ng.</i> As if to escape from the thoughts that probed
at my mind I counted the strokes. <i>Bonn-n-ng.</i> Two. <i>Bo-
nn-n-ng.</i> Three. Automatically I glanced at my wrist watch.
Ten o'clock. <i>Bonn-n-ng...</i></p>

<p>"An interesting bit," a low voice murmured. "Well worth the
study you are giving it."</p>

<p>The little man had come up so quietly beside me that he seemed
almost to have materialized out of the air of the empty gallery,
yet somehow I was not startled. "Yes," I responded, slipping the
stone back into my pocket. "Yes, it is quite interesting."</p>

<p>The fellow was short, so short that the top of his head,
completely bald, barely came to my shoulder. That head seemed out
of proportion, seemed almost grotesquely too large for his small
figure and his round face seemed to float almost disembodied in
the light from Evelyn Rand's portrait, the rest of him in
shadow.</p>

<p>His skin was yellowish and of an odd lustreless texture I
should have thought of as 'parchment-like' except that parchment
is wrinkled and this skin was so smooth that I had a disquieting
impression it might be artificial. There was nothing artificial
about the tiny eyes that peered unblinkingly at the picture,
black eyes keener and more piercing than any I'd 'til then
seen.</p>

<p>"You have noticed," the little man was saying, "how
painstakingly the artist has depicted every physical detail. You
feel that merely by reaching out you can touch the warmth of the
girl's flesh, or straighten that fold in her frock the wind has
disarranged, or take that black pendant in your hand and examine
it more closely."</p>

<p>Did his glance flash to my face at this mention of the gem, as
if to trap any change in my expression before I could mask it? I
could not be sure. He was looking at the portrait again and his
low, clear voice flowed on.</p>

<p>"But I wonder if you appreciate how much of his subject's
personality the artist has contrived to convey. She is not quite
in tune with the world where she finds herself. All her life she
has been lonely, because she does not quite belong. She has a
sort of half-knowledge of matters hidden from others of her race
and time, not altogether realized but sufficiently so that very
dimly she is aware of the peril the full unveiling of that
knowledge would bring upon her."</p>

<p>"What peril?" I demanded, twisting to him. "What do you know
about her?"</p>

<p>He smiled blandly at me, answered, "I know what the artist put
on that canvas for me to read. And for you. Look at it
again."</p>

<p>I did. I saw the girl. I saw the dark, amorphous background
and that was all.</p>

<p>"Look." I felt fingers brush lightly across my eyes but I did
not resent the liberty, forgot it, forgot the little man who had
taken it.</p>

<p>Behind the painted girl there was no longer formless shadow.
There was, instead, a desolate landscape so informed with
strangeness that I knew if it existed anywhere it was nowhere on
Earth. And from that scene there reached out to me a sense of awe
and a sense of overpowering dread.</p>

<p>No living thing was visible to explain that apprehension. It
stemmed from the vista itself, from the grayish purple hue of its
shadows, from the sky that was too low and of a color no sky
should be. Most of all, however, it was aroused in me by the
monstrous monument that loomed from the too-near horizon.</p>

<p>Black this tremendous shape was, the same strangely living
black as the little stone in my vest pocket, and incredibly
formed; and there spread from it an adumbration of menace of
which Evelyn was as yet unaware.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" I squeezed through my locked larynx. "Tell me
where that place is."</p>

<p>"Not yet." The little man peered at me with the detached
interest of an entomologist observing an insect specimen. "Not
yet," he repeated and it seemed to me that he was answering not
my demand but the thought in my throbbing brain, the thought that
Evelyn was in some nameless danger and I must go to her to save
her from it. "When it is time you will come to me and learn what
you want to know." He thrust a white oblong into my hand.
Automatically, I glanced down at the card.</p>

<p>There was not enough light to read it. I lifted it to catch
the reflection from the portrait&mdash;and realized that the man
was no longer beside me.</p>

<p>He was nowhere in the room. He must have gone swiftly out, the
carpeting making his footfalls soundless. <i>Bon-n-ng.</i> The
tower clock was striking again. Muffled as it was, I was grateful
for the familiar sound. <i>Bon-n-ng...Bon-n-ng.</i> It was not
the half-hour that was striking, but the hour<i>! Bon-n-ng.</i>
We had not seemed to have been talking nearly that long. <i>Bon-
n-ng.</i> The dull sound welled into the hush of that painting-
walled room. <i>Bon-n-ng</i>...The gong died to silence.</p>

<p>Six! There had been only six strokes of the clock! I had not
heard the first five. That was only natural. My attention had
been on the little man. The clock had struck five times before he
was gone and I became aware of it.</p>

<p>It takes only a small distraction of one's attention to blot
out awareness of a striking clock. I'd been counting those
strokes an hour ago. I had counted four when the little man spoke
to me, and yet I didn't recall hearing the rest of the ten at
all.</p>

<p><i>Four and six are ten!</i> </p>

<p>Nonsense! This I was thinking was arrant, impossible nonsense.
Nevertheless my lifted hand trembled slightly as I turned it to
look at the watch strapped to its wrist.</p>

<p>Its hands stood at ten. At ten o'clock precisely, just as they
had when the little man first spoke to me.</p>

<p>For a long minute the shadows of that art gallery hid the Lord
alone knows what shapes of dread. The painted faces leered at me
from the walls&mdash;</p>

<p>All but one. The face of Evelyn Rand, its wistful smile
unchanged, its gray eyes cool, and frank and friendly, brought me
back to reason. Her face, and the fact that behind her I could
see no strange, unearthly landscape but a formless swirl of dark
pigment, warm in tone and texture and altogether without meaning
except to set off her slim and graceful shape.</p>

<p>I was still uneasy, but not because of any supernatural
occurrence. A fellow who's never known a sick day in his life can
be forgiven for being upset when he finds out there are limits to
his endurance.</p>

<p>For two weeks I had been plugging away at my hunt for Evelyn
Rand, and I hadn't been getting much sleep, worrying about her. I
hadn't had any at all last night, returning from Westchester in a
smoke-filled day, coach on the nerve-racking Putnam Division. I
was just plain fagged out, and I'd had a waking dream between two
strokes of the tower clock.</p>

<p>Dreams I knew from the psychology course I once took to earn
an easy three credits, can take virtually no time to go through
one's mind. From what I'd learned in that same course, that I
should have imagined Evelyn in some strange land, with some
obscure menace overhanging her, was a symbolization of the
mystery of her whereabouts and of my fears for her. The little
man represented my own personality, voicing my inchoate dreads
and tantalizing me with a promise of a solution to the riddle
deferred to some indefinite future. 'Not yet', he had said...</p>

<p>It was all simple and explicable enough, but it was disturbing
that I should have undergone the experience. Maybe I ought to see
a doctor. I had a card somewhere&mdash;</p>

<p>A card in my hand was the one I dreamed the little man had
given me. <i>It was real!</i> Objects in dreams do not remain
real when one wakes...</p>

<p>Hold everything! There was a rational explanation for this
too. The card hadn't come out of the dream. It had been in the
dream because I already had it in my hand. It must have been in
the catalogue. Leafing the pamphlet as I was absorbed in
contemplation of Evelyn's portrait, I had abstractedly taken it
out unaware that I was doing so.</p>

<p>I looked at it, expecting it to be the ad of some other
gallery connected with this one, or of some art school or
teacher. It might be the latter but it didn't say so.</p>

<p>All there was on the card was a name and address:</p>

<p><i>ACHRONOS ASTARIS</i> </p>

<p><i>419 Furman Street, Brooklyn</i> </p>

<p>Brooklyn.</p>

<p>There is something solid and utterly matter-of-fact about that
Borough of Homes and Churches, something stodgy and unimaginative
and comfortable about its very name. I stuffed the card among a
number of others in my wallet (lawyers accumulate such things as
a blue serge suit accumulates flecks of air-floated thread) and
forgot it.</p>

<p>I took a last, long look at the portrait of Evelyn Rand. My
reconstruction of her personality was complete. All that was left
was to find her.</p>

<p>All that was left! I laughed shortly and a little bitterly as
I turned to leave the exhibition room. I had hoped somehow,
somewhere among the things she had touched, the people she had
known, the scenes through which she had moved, to come upon a
hint of where and how to look for her. I had found nothing.
Worse, every new fact about her that had come to light denied any
rational explanation of her disappearance.</p>

<p>There was no youth in whom she was enough interested to make
the idea of an elopement even remotely possible. She had
manifested every evidence of contentment with her way of life;
quiet, luxurious, interfered with not at all by the trustees of
the Estate. To conceive the sensitive, shy girl as stagestruck
would be the height of absurdity.</p>

<p>No reason for voluntary disappearance that I had been able to
think of would fit into Evelyn's makeup as I knew it now.</p>

<p>Foul play was as thoroughly eliminated. Kidnappers would have
made their demand for ransom by this time. Seventy-third Street
had been crowded with churchgoers that Sunday morning; no hit-
and-run accident, with the driver carrying off his victim, could
have occurred unobserved. The police and hospital records had
offered no suggestion of any more ordinary casualty that might
have involved her. The charitable organizations to whom the
income of the Estate of Darius Rand would go were to be chosen by
the trustees only after the event of a lapse of her right to it.
Evelyn Rand was the last person on earth to have an enemy, secret
or otherwise.</p>

<p>The more I had learned about her&mdash;the less explicable her
absence had become. I was licked. I ought to go back to the
office and tell old Sturdevant to call in the police&mdash;I
stopped stockstill in the brittle winter sunshine of Madison
Avenue. Tentatively, almost fearfully, I tested the air with
flaring nostrils.</p>

<p>I had not been mistaken. Faint but unmistakable I smelled what
I'd thought I had; the mingled scent of arbutus and crocuses and
hyacinths and the nameless fragrance of dreams. The perfume that
was used by Evelyn Rand, and Evelyn Rand alone.</p>

<p>She was near. She was very near. She had passed this way
minutes before. Seconds, for the delicate aroma could not have
lived longer in the gasoline fumes and the reek of this city
street.</p>

<p>I looked for her. Eagerly I looked for the girl of the
portrait, and saw a messenger boy slouching down the pavement, a
rotund beldame swathed in mink entering her sleek limousine,
business men bustling past, someone's chic secretary on her way
to the bank on the corner with a deposit book held tightly in her
gloved small hand. A shabbily dressed old man pored over a tome
at the sidewalk stall of a used bookstore beside me. I was in the
middle of the block and nowhere on it was anyone who possibly
could be Evelyn Rand.</p>

<p>The scent was gone and I felt empty inside. Weak. People were
turning to stare at me. A man in a gray Homburg hat and a double
breasted dark overcoat started toward me; if he spoke to me I'd
probably pop him on that clipped little triangle of beard that
waggled from his chin. I wheeled to the bookstall, plucked a
ragged volume out of it&mdash;anything to hide my face, to give
me a chance to pull myself together.</p>

<p>If this sort of thing kept up I was destined for an asylum.
First I'd seen, talked to, someone who didn't exist. Now I was
taking to smelling things. I tried to recall if I'd ever heard of
anyone having olfactory hallucinations...</p>

<p>The bookworm next to me was watching me curiously. That was
because I hadn't opened the book I'd picked up, wasn't even
looking at it. If I didn't do so right away he'd be sure
something was wrong.</p>

<p>The cloth binding was blistered and water-soaked, but the
lettering on it still was distinct. The title of the book
was&mdash;THE VANISHED!</p>

<p>It was, of course, pure coincidence. Nevertheless the short
hairs at the nape of my neck bristled. It was too damned pat a
coincidence for comfort.</p>

<p>The cover almost came away from the rest of the volume as I
opened it. The paper was mildewed, powdery. I found the title
page. The words, <i>'The Vanished',</i> were repeated. Beneath
the Old English type was a short paragraph in italics:</p>

<p><i>"Here are tales of a scant few of those who from the
earliest dawn of history have vanished quietly from among the
living yet are not numbered among the dead. Like so many
whispering whorls of dust they went out of space and out of time,
to what Otherwhere no one still among us knows,</i> and <i>none
will ever know."</i></p>

<p>'Like so many whispering whorls of dust.' Could it be pure
coincidence that those words wavered on this stained page? My
fingers were cold and numb as I turned it and stared at the
headings; Elijah, Prophet in Israel. The Tsar Alexander the
First. King Arthur of Camelot. John Orth, Archduke of Tuscany.
Francois Villon, Thief, Lover and Poet. The Lost Dauphin. They
Who Sailed on the <i>Marie Celeste</i>. Judge Crater of New
York.</p>

<p>And, How Many Unrecorded Others?</p>

<p>Was Evelyn Rand one of the 'unrecorded others' who have
vanished 'out of space and out of time?' Perhaps, the thought
came to me, perhaps somewhere in this book I may find that hint,
that suggestion of what has happened to her for which I've hunted
so long in vain.</p>

<p>Not rational, of course. But remember I was not rational at
that moment. Distinctly not rational, so far from it in fact that
once the idea occurred to me it seemed to me that Evelyn
approved, that she was urging me to act upon it.</p>

<p>I went into the store, shadowed, musty with the peculiar aroma
of old paper and rotted leather and dried glue found only in such
establishments. A gray man in a long gray smock shuffled out of
the gray dusk between high shelfstacks.</p>

<p>"How much is this?" I inquired, holding the volume up.</p>

<p>"Hey?" He peered at me with bleared, half-blind eyes.
"Hey?"</p>

<p>"I want to buy this book," I repeated. "How much do you ask
for it?"</p>

<p>"This?" He took it in his clawlike hands, brought it so close
to his face I thought he would bruise his nose. "<i>The
Vanished</i>? Hm-m&mdash;" He pondered a matter of life and
death. Finally he came out with the price. "Thirty-five
cents."</p>

<p>"Little enough." I shoved my hand in my pocket, discovered I
had no small change. "But you'll have to break a five for me," I
said, taking my wallet from my breastpocket. "That's the smallest
I have."</p>

<p>"You're a lucky man," the bookseller squeaked. "To have five
dollars these days. Heh, heh, heh." I suppose the shrill twitter
was meant for a laugh, but it irritated me. I jerked the bill
from the fold so hard that it brought out with it a card that
fluttered to the floor.</p>

<p>The gray man took the greenback and shuffled off into some
misty recesses beyond the shelving. I bent to retrieve the white
oblong.</p>

<p>I didn't pick it up. I remained stooped, my fingers just
touching it, my nostrils flaring once more to the scent of
spring, to the perfume of Evelyn Rand.</p>

<p>The sense of her presence was overpowering but now I knew it
did not mean she was anywhere near. The perfume came from the
card I was picking up and the printed name on that card was
<i>Achronos Astaris.</i></p>

<p>At last I knew where to look for her.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">3. SAFARI TO BROOKLYN</a> </h2>

<p class="first">"Here's your change, mister."</p>

<p>I thrust the card into my coat's side pocket as I
straightened. "Keep it," I told the bookseller grinning.</p>

<p>"And keep the book too. I don't need it any more." The way he
stared at me, pop-eyed, was excruciatingly funny. I laughed aloud
as I strode out of that musty old store of his. I didn't know
where Furman Street was&mdash;like most Manhattanites I thought
of Brooklyn as some strange bourne the other side of the
moon&mdash;but I'd soon find out. I looked around for a
policeman, saw one standing on the corner observing a bevy of
giggling young females board a bus. "Furman Street," he repeated,
scratching his head. "Never heard of it."</p>

<p>"It's in Brooklyn," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Oh, Brooklyn." He looked disgusted. I felt that I ought to
apologize for wanting to go there but decided not to, waited
silently as he stripped off a white glove and from somewhere in
the inner mysteries of his uniform dug out a dog-eared small book
with a red paper cover. "How do you spell it?"</p>

<p>"B-R&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! Fur&mdash;That street."</p>

<p>"F-U-R-M-A-N."</p>

<p>The cop wet a thumb and started turning frayed pages.
"Fairfield," he muttered. "Flatlands. Freedom Square. Here it is,
Furman Avenue."</p>

<p>"No," I said. "Furman <i>Street."</i></p>

<p>"Oh! Yeah, there's a Furman Street too. What's the
number?"</p>

<p>I glanced at the card. "Four hundred nineteen."</p>

<p>"Yeah. Yeah, I got it. You take the IRT subway. It says here
IRT Sub Borough Hall four blocks west."</p>

<p>"I see." But I didn't, not quite. "Does that mean the Borough
Hall station is four blocks west of Furman Street or that I walk
four blocks west from the station?"</p>

<p>The policeman took off his cap and made a more thorough job of
scratching his head. "Hanged if I know." Then he got a sudden
inspiration. "I'll look in the front of the book."</p>

<p>"When I went to school," I said wearily, "the answers were in
the back of the book. Thanks for your trouble but if it's as
complicated as all that I'll take a taxi."</p>

<p>I hailed one, gave the driver the address and climbed in. For
the first time that day I felt like smoking. I got my pipe out,
tamped into its bowl the mixture that after much experimentation
I've found suits me exactly, puffed flame into it.</p>

<p>The bit was comfortable between my teeth and the smoke
soothing. I shoved over into a corner, leaned back, stretching
out diagonally legs too long to be comfortable in any vehicle.
The change of position brought my face into the rear view mirror
and, not from any Narcissism but to relax my brain as my body was
relaxed, I studied it critically.</p>

<p>There are two things that irk me about that phiz of mine. It
is unconscionably young-looking in spite of my twenty-seven years
and the staid and serious mien I assume when I can remember the
appearance expected of an attorney, even a junior attorney, on
the staff of Sturdevant, Hamlin, Mosby and Garfield. Then too, my
nose is slightly thickened midway of the bridge, and there is a
semicircular scar on my left cheek, mementoes of a certain
encounter with a son of Nippon who wielded his Samurai sword a
bit too dexterously for my comfort.</p>

<p>Otherwise mine is not too unpleasant a countenance with which
to live. I have a thick shock of ruddy brown hair, eyes that
almost match it in hue and a squarish jaw I like to think appears
strong and determined. I'll never take first prize in a beauty
contest, but neither do babes scream at the sight of me. Not even
grown-up ones.</p>

<p>Madison Avenue died and was buried in the Square of the same
name. We were on Fourth Avenue for a while and then on Lafayette
Street. The old Tombs Prison, abandoned now, lifted its
formidable granite wall on the left, was succeeded by the white
majesty of the government buildings that front Foley Square. The
Municipal Building straddled Chambers Street like a modern
Colossus of Rhodes and then the blare of City Hall Park was
raucous in my ears.</p>

<p>An overalled truck driver disputed the right of way with my
cabby. "Where the hell do you think you're goin'?" he wanted to
know.</p>

<p>Where did I think I was going? Why did I think I was going
towards Evelyn Rand when all the evidence I had of any connection
between her and this Achronos Astaris was the faint hint of her
perfume on his card?</p>

<p>Evidence? I was a hell of a lawyer! That card need never have
been anywhere near Furman Street or Astaris.</p>

<p>Hundreds of them must have been inserted between the leaves of
the art gallery's catalogues, and that had been done at the
gallery. She'd never been on Furman Street. She had never heard
of this Astaris nor he of her.</p>

<p>But the card carried her perfume. I fished it out, lifted it
to my nostrils and sniffed. All I smelled was paper and ink.</p>

<p>The fragrance had not, then, come from this bit of pasteboard.
But I'd smelled it, I was certain that I had smelled in the
street outside that bookstore and again inside. I was a
blithering ass. Evelyn had been in that store seconds before I'd
entered it. I was running away from, not towards her. "Hey," I
yelled to the driver. "Turn around. Turn around fast and go back
to where we started from."</p>

<p>"Nix, fella," the cabby grunted. "It's ten days suspension of
my license if I turn here on the bridge."</p>

<p>"What bridge?" But staring out of the window I saw that we
were on the bridge to Brooklyn and I knew that the ordinance
prohibiting a U-turn on it was rigidly enforced. "Okay," I
grunted, resignedly. "Guess I've got to wait."</p>

<p>That was the longest, most chafing mile I've ever ridden. The
noon rush was just beginning and the roadway was jammed, but at
long last the taxi reached the trolley-cluttered plaza at the
other end and slowed. "Well," my driver growled at his
windshield. "Yuh change your mind again or is it go back?"</p>

<p>"Go on." That wasn't I who'd answered. It was a woman's voice;
but so clear, so imperative that the cab's sudden burst of speed
thrust me back into my corner and before I'd recovered myself it
already was wheeling down a narrow street liberally supplied with
one-way arrows.</p>

<p>And with signs that said, TO BOROUGH HALL. Some woman in a car
alongside had said 'Go on' to her own driver and somehow her
voice had carried to mine. Simple. So simple that in deciding it
no longer mattered if I delayed an hour in returning to that
bookstore, that I might as well go on and interview Achronos
Astaris, I had no sense of yielding to any guidance outside my
own will.</p>

<p>And then the driver veered the cab to the curb, braked
hard.</p>

<p>"I got a flat, buddy," he turned to inform me, quite
unnecessarily, as he heaved out of his seat. "Take me five, six
minutes to fix. That's Borough Hall right ahead there. Mebbe if
you'd ask a coupla guys where this here Furman Street is while
I'm workin' it'll save us time."</p>

<p>"I've got a better idea," I grunted. "I'll pay you off now and
walk the rest of the way. According to the cop's book it's only
four blocks from here." I, paid him his fare and alighted. If
travelling in Brooklyn was a matter of asking questions, I could
do that with the best.</p>

<p>Asking questions was one thing, getting informative replies
another. In turn a newsstand attendant, a brother attorney
hurrying, briefcase in hand, toward the nearby Courthouse and a
bearded derelict standing hopefully beside a little portable
shine-box shrugged doubtful shoulders and looked blank. Finally,
I approached a policeman with some trepidation. If he produced a
little red booklet&mdash;</p>

<p>But he didn't. "Furman Street," he said. "That's over on the
edge of Brooklyn Heights. Cross this here street and go past that
there corner cigar store and keep going and you'll walk right
into it."</p>

<p>I heaved a sigh of relief. It was exceedingly premature. My
brisk pace slowed as I found myself in a maze of narrow, decorous
streets labelled with such curious names as Orange, Cranberry,
Pineapple. I entered a still narrower one designated College
Place and brought up facing a blank wall that forbade further
progress. I extricated myself from that <i>Cul-de-sac,</i> walked
a little further and halted.</p>

<p>I had lost all sense of direction.</p>

<p>From not far off came the growl of city traffic, the honk of
horns, the busy hum of urban life, but all this seemed oddly
alien to this street where I was, this street of low, gray-
facaded houses with high stone stoops and windows shuttered
against prying eyes. Years and the weather had spread over them a
dark patina of age yet there was about them a timeless quality,
an air of aloofness from the flow of events, from the petty
affairs of the very mankind for whose shelter they had been
erected. The houses seemed to possess the street so utterly that
no one moved along the narrow sidewalks or appeared at the
blinded windows, or let his voice be heard.</p>

<p>I was strangely alone in the heart of the city, strangely
cloistered in drowsy quiet.</p>

<p>Into that quiet there came a low sonorous hoot, swelling 'til
the air was vibrant with it, fading away. The sound came again
and I knew what it was. A steamboat whistle. I recalled that the
taxi had not run far from the Bridge, that the East River must be
very near. I recalled, too, what the policeman had just said
about Furman Street's being on the edge of Brooklyn Heights. It
would overlook the River, then, and the direction from which the
whistle had come would be the direction in which lay the
thoroughfare I sought.</p>

<p>I turned in that direction, saw a drugstore on the nearest
corner, and started for it. I'd get straightened out there.</p>

<p>The shop was small, low-ceiled, the shelving and showcases
white and very clean. There was no soda fountain. Glass vases
filled with colored water, red and green, stood at either end of
a high partition.</p>

<p>I heard the clink of a pestle on a wedgewood mortar behind
that partition. It stopped when I cleared my throat loudly. A
dark green portiere moved aside to open a doorway and the
spectacled, white-coated pharmacist came out.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" he greeted me pleasantly, tugging at one
drooping wing of a pair of walrus mustaches. "Warm for this time
of the year, isn't it?" He came leisurely toward me, smiling.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you can direct me to Furman Street."</p>

<p>"Certainly." The druggist took me by the arm, impelled me
gently to the door, opened it. "You haven't far to go, but it
makes a difference which number you want. The two hundreds are
that way," pointing, "but it's shorter to the four hundreds if
you go up Plum Street." He indicated a thoroughfare at an acute
angle to the one he'd first gestured to.</p>

<p>"I'd better go up Plum, then," I said. "The number I'm looking
for is four-nineteen."</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken, sir. There is no such number on
Furman."</p>

<p>I answered his smile with my own. "But there is. I'm positive
that is the address." I brought the card out of my overcoat
pocket and once more read it. The number was distinctly and
indubitably 419. "Look here." I displayed the pasteboard to the
pharmacist. "Isn't that 419 Furman Street?"</p>

<p>The druggist looked at the card. Then he looked up at me, and
the smile was gone from his face. "Listen, old man." His hand was
on my arm, solicitously. "Furman Street is very long and there
might be an easier way for you to get to where you want to go
than along Plum. Sit down here a minute," he led me to a bentwood
chair in front of a showcase, "while I go in back and look up
just where four-nineteen is."</p>

<p>I couldn't quite make him out, but he was being so decent to
me that I couldn't argue with him. I sat down and watched him
hurry back behind the partition to consult, as I supposed,
another one of those little red guidebooks.</p>

<p>I was mistaken. I have exceptionally keen hearing and so I
caught from behind that mirrored wall something I definitely
wasn't supposed to hear. The pharmacist's whisper, suddenly
excited: "Tom! Grab that 'phone and dial Dr. Pierce. I think that
fellow out there is the patient that got away from his asylum
last night."</p>

<p>Another whisper came back: "How do you figure that?"</p>

<p>"He just asked me for four-nineteen Furman. Four-nineteen,
mind you. And he showed me what he said was a card with that
number on it. But there wasn't any card in his hand. There was
nothing in it at all."</p>

<p>"Certainly sounds like a nut," I heard the other whisper
respond. "You go back out there and keep him talking and I'll get
Pierce's keepers over here. Here, you better take this gun along
in case he gets violent."</p>

<p>That got me out of the chair and out of that store in a rush.
I was a block away before I slowed and stopped.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">4. FORMAN STREET</a> </h2>

<p class="first">There <i>was</i> a card in my hand. By the
evidence of every possible sense I held the card of Achronos
Astaris in my hand. A man who seemed sane insisted that hand was
empty, but I could feel the card in it, see it, read the name and
address printed on it. It was there. I'd found it in the
catalogue of the exhibit where Evelyn Rand's portrait hung.</p>

<p>I did not know that. I'd <i>decided</i> the card had been
between the pages of that pamphlet because it was madness to
permit myself to believe that it had been handed to me during a
space of time that occupied no time at all, by a man who did not
exist.</p>

<p><i>But if the card itself did not exist!</i> </p>

<p>Here it was between my thumb and fingers, white, crisp,
unquestionable. Even if the pharmacist hadn't seen it, others
had. The gray bookseller. The policeman on Madison Ave.</p>

<p>Had they? I had dropped it in the bookstore, had bent to pick
it up, but the near-sighted dealer in second-hand tomes had said
nothing, done nothing, to indicate that he was aware of why I
stooped, of what I reached for. Nor, I now recalled, had I shown
the card to either officer.</p>

<p>What if I had not? The card was real, couldn't be anything
else but real. I had been meant to hear the druggist's whisper,
saying that it was not. It was his perverted idea of a joke. The
best thing to do about the incident was to forget it. The card
<i>had</i> to be real. The alternative was&mdash;</p>

<p>I dared not put that alternative into words, even in thought.
I could test it however, very simply.</p>

<p>I could go to Furman Street and look for number four-nineteen.
If it was there, if a man named Achronos Astaris lived there, I
was sane.</p>

<p>My skull felt drained, empty, when I reached that decision. I
stared about me. I saw a lamp post and a street sign stiffly
projecting from it. The sign said, Plum Street. By continuing on
the way I was going I would come to Furman Street, in the four
hundred block.</p>

<p>I got moving. This street was as deserted as those through
which I had come. Yet I had a queer feeling that I was not alone
in it, that someone was keeping ahead of me, just ahead, although
I could see no one. The sidewalk curved, climbed quite steeply to
brightness about a hundred yards before me. I thought I caught a
flutter of misty blue up ahead, but when I looked more closely it
was gone.</p>

<p>The houses beside me ended and I halted, staring out into the
brightness of sky over water, gazing raptly at the mountainous
mass that seemed suspended in that brightness.</p>

<p>Stone and steel and glass, across the bustling water each
gargantuan tower was separate and distinct, but all were merged
in a jagged pyramid that climbed, colossal in beauty, 'til its
topmost pinnacle challenged the sun. Manhattan's skyscrapers.</p>

<p>After awhile my gaze drifted downward to the swirling,
cloudlike haze that obscured the bases of the skyscrapers and
made it seem as though they hung unsupported in midair.</p>

<p>Strange, I was thinking, that so late in the day the mists
still should be heavy on the Bay, and then I realized that the
obscurity was neither cloud nor mist and that it lay not on the
water but on the nearer shore.</p>

<p>What my unfocussed eyes had diagnosed as vapor I saw now was a
low building that faced the end of Plum Street, a low gable-
roofed wooden house, white-painted, with a little green lawn
before it. A narrow gravel path went up through the lawn to an
oaken door that made a dark, semicircle-topped rectangle in the
clapboard facade.</p>

<p>One comes upon such relics of a more gracious past in the most
unlikely parts of New York. Mostly, though, they are dilapidated,
ramshackle, mouldering to ruin. This one seemed perfectly
preserved. The pickets of the wrought iron fence around its
pocket handkerchief of a lawn were unscarred by rust, its windows
obviously were washed and gleaming even if darkened by the blinds
pulled down behind their panes.</p>

<p>From the center of the roof a small domed cupola rose and
around it ran a narrow, railed balcony.</p>

<p>Recalling something of my school history, I wondered if George
Washington had not perhaps stood on that balcony, spyglass to
eye, watching General Gates' redcoats filling the barges that
would bring them across the river to the Battle of Brooklyn
Heights. Perhaps this house had been his headquarters during that
momentous encounter. That would explain its preservation.</p>

<p>On either side of it was a four-storied structure of gray
stone, each the beginning of a row running off to right and left
paralleling the shore. In front of the building to the
left&mdash;my left&mdash;of the gabled wooden house was a tall
brown lamp post and the sign on the lamp post read Furman
<i>Street.</i></p>

<p>The number painted on the third step of the high stoop of the
house behind the lamp post was 415. The number painted on the
third stoop of the stone house to the right&mdash;my
right&mdash;of the low white house was 423.</p>

<p>The house between them, the house with the little lawn and the
balconied cupola must be, then, Number 419 Furman Street.</p>

<p>As I went across to it some errant breeze lifted a whirl of
dust from the asphalt. It accompanied me across the opposite
sidewalk and through the gate in the tall fence of wrought iron.
It whispered about me as I went up the path and although I felt
the gravel crunch under my feet there was no other sound in the
hush than the whisper of that tiny whorl of dust.</p>

<p>The high portal, oak darkened by the years to the tone of old
leather and to its secret glow, opened smoothly, silently before
me. Without hesitation, almost as though I were no longer master
of my own movement, I stepped through the aperture into cool
dimness.</p>

<p>The door thudded dully behind me. It shut out the city's low
murmur, so omnipresent that I had not been aware of it 'til now
it was gone. It was as if a barrier had come between me and the
world I knew.</p>

<p>Passing from the bright winter sunshine to this semidarkness,
I was temporarily blinded. I halted, a bit bemused, waiting for
sight to be restored.</p>

<p>I could make out no detail of the place where I was. I could
see only a gray, featureless blur. But I had an impression of
spaciousness&mdash;of space really. Of a vast, limitless space
that by no imaginable means could be confined within the four
walls of a house. Of a space that could not be confined within
the four points of the compass!</p>

<p>Abruptly my thigh muscles were quivering and the nausea of
vertigo was twisting within me! I seemed to be on the brink of a
bottomless chasm. If I took another step I would hurtle down,
forever down. The impulse seized me to take that step, to hurl
myself, plummeting, into that illimitable abyss&mdash;</p>

<p>Hold it, Johnny March! I told myself, voicelessly. Hold
everything! This is only the hall of an old house. In a moment
your pupils will adjust themselves and you will see
it&mdash;walls papered with the weeping-willow design you've
always liked, hooked rugs on a floor of axe-hewn planks, perhaps
a graceful balustraded staircase&mdash;</p>

<p>Subconsciously I must already have been aware of all this, for
the very foyer I described took shape out of the formless blur.
The design I remembered from the Early American Exhibit of the
Metropolitan Museum patterned the faded walls. Wide planks made
the floor, rutted with decades of treading feet and keyed
together by tiny double wedges of wood, and their dull sheen was
brightened by oval rugs whose colors were still glowing despite
the years since patient hands had fashioned them. Directly ahead
of me the wide staircase I had imaged rose, gently curving, to
obscurity above, its dark rails tenuous and graceful.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, turning to the person who had admitted me.
"This is&mdash;" I never finished the sentence.</p>

<p>No one was there. No one at all!</p>

<p>Someone had opened the door for me, and no one had passed me,
going away from it. But of course whoever it was had slipped out
the door, as I entered.</p>

<p>Was Brooklyn inhabited exclusively by practical jokers? This
one wasn't going to get away with it. He couldn't have gotten
far. I grabbed the doorknob, determined to go after him.</p>

<p>The door didn't open. It was locked! I was locked in!</p>

<p>That was going too far, much too far. I&mdash;</p>

<p>A silken rustle behind me twisted me around. I started to say
just what I thought of the proceedings&mdash;My mouth remained
open, the angry words dying unspoken.</p>

<p>Down the stairs from above were coming tiny feet, a froth of
lace, a circular billow of foaming lace that could only be the
hems of the multitudinous petticoats women wore in the days when
this house was built. Then the filmy blue of a wide hoopskirt
descended into view, a pointed bodice tight on a waist my hand
could span.</p>

<p>I shook my head, trying to shake the cobwebs out of it. What
the devil was this?</p>

<p>The crinolined maiden paused on the stairs, a slim white hand
to her startled bosom. For a moment the shadow of the ceiling was
across her face, and then I saw it, whitely luminous against the
dark background of the stairs.</p>

<p>It was the face of Evelyn Rand! The soft red mouth was tight
with pain, the gray eyes peering down at me were haunted with a
strange dread; but this was the face that had looked out from the
portrait on Madison Avenue...</p>

<p>"Evelyn!" I cried, leaping forward. My feet struck the bottom
step, pounding upward&mdash;</p>

<p>And suddenly were motionless.</p>

<p>She wasn't there any longer. She wasn't above me on the
stairs. She hadn't retreated, startled by my cry. She had
<i>blinked out,</i> in the instant it had taken me to get across
the floor and three steps up.</p>

<p>Something was left of her. A faint sweetness on the air. The
scent of spring. The scent of dreams.</p>

<p>Of dreams. Was I at it again? Had I only dreamed that I saw
her?</p>

<p>"Not quite," a low, toneless voice said behind me. "She was
not there, but neither did you dream that she was."</p>

<p>I wheeled, my breath caught in my throat.</p>

<p>Just below me at the stairs' foot, vagrant light from
somewhere gleaming on the polished scalp of his too-large head,
his lashless and disquieting eyes pinpoints of flame in the
gloom, was the little man of the art gallery!</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">5. THE RIDDLES OF ACHRONOS
ASTARIS</a> </h2>

<p class="first">MY FINGERS DUG INTO the rail they had grasped to
pull me up the stairs. That at least was firm and hard. That at
least was real.</p>

<p>"Less real than I," said the little man who twice apparently
had materialized out of nothingness. "The staircase exists only
as you have conceived it. So do the walls about us and the floor
on which you see me stand."</p>

<p>I'd not spoken aloud the thought to which he responded. Was he
reading my mind?</p>

<p>"A crude way of phrasing it," he answered that unspoken
thought, "but as near the truth as you can comprehend." Damn him!
He was laughing at me. I knew he was laughing at me even though
his round face with its artificial-seeming skin was as still as a
modelled mask. He was&mdash;Hold on, John March. You're in that
dream again, that confounded dream. What you think you hear him
say is just the answer of one part of your mind to the thoughts
of another. You no more see this odd human than just now you saw
Evelyn Rand&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wrong," the little man said. "You saw her, or rather a
projection of her that I presented to you in order to ascertain
if what I already had observed is a constant of your psyche or an
aberration."</p>

<p>I could not be dreaming that. I had no idea of what it
meant.</p>

<p>"The hell you say," I flung at him to conceal my growing
apprehension. "What am I, some kind of guinea pig with which
you're experimenting?"</p>

<p>A faint, mocking smile brushed his still lips. Or did it?</p>

<p>"Exactly," he murmured.</p>

<p>That enraged me.</p>

<p>"Experiment with this," I yelled and leaped down at him, my
fist flailing straight for his round, inhuman face&mdash;</p>

<p>It whizzed through empty air! My feet pounded on the floor.
The little man had vanished&mdash;</p>

<p>Sound behind me whirled me around. The fellow was on the
staircase, three steps up. He was exactly where I had been, an
instant before! But how in the name of reason had he gotten
there? He couldn't have passed me, he couldn't possibly have
passed me. To get to where he was he would have had to go up the
steps at the same time, by the same path, I had plunged down
them. Two bodies cannot occupy the same space&mdash;</p>

<p>"Matter can be in one place and then in another," he said in
the slow, patient way one explains some complex idea to a child,
choosing phrases suitable to its limited comprehension, "without
ever having been anywhere between. Even you should know that. Or
are you not acquainted with the observations on the behavior of
electrons that already had been made in your time."</p>

<p>"In my time! What time?"</p>

<p>"The Twentieth Century, as you reckon it." I had the curious
feeling that he was speaking of some period in the remote past.
"I am certain our researches are correct on that point."</p>

<p>I shook my head. He couldn't be saying that, he just could
not. It didn't make sense. With my confused sense of
<i>wrongness</i> about all this was mingled a sort of baffled
exasperation. Damn him! He was coldly amused by my
bewilderment.</p>

<p>Queer! No flicker of the muscles in his face, no changing
light in his black and piercing eyes, revealed that to me. But I
was as aware of his amusement as though he had laughed aloud. Was
I too, very dimly, beginning to learn to do without speech? Was I
tapping some subtle current of communication that 'til now I had
not even suspected to exist?</p>

<p>"Who are you?" I blurted. "Who the devil are you?"</p>

<p>He was growing tired of this colloquy between us. "If you must
think of me by a name, Achronos Astaris will do." He had stopped
playing, was coming to the nub of his purpose with me.</p>

<p>"What, John March, is it that has impelled you to forget
everything else in your desire to find Evelyn Rand? What is it
that makes her a necessity to you, so that without her you are
not complete? What is it that has made ambition, the anxiety for
preferment, pride in the occupation you chose for your lifework,
insignificant compared with the need you feel for her? What force
is it that draws you to her with a strength greater than the
attraction of gravity, greater than the thirst of the sodium ion
for the hydroxyl group it tears even from water? What chemistry
of the emotions has governed your actions since she became real
to you?"</p>

<p>His eyes, his dreadful, probing eyes, demanded an answer. "I
love her," I flung at Astaris. "God help me, I have fallen in
love with her."</p>

<p>I had not known it 'til that moment, had not realized it. But
it was true. I <i>was</i> in love with the girl for whom I had
been searching so long, the girl whom I'd never seen, with whom I
had never spoken.</p>

<p>"Ahhh," Achronos Astaris breathed. "I know that the name of
your reaction to her is love." For the first time I sensed a
wavering in the clear, cold surety of him. "But what, precisely,
does that mean?"</p>

<p>I glared at him, anger once more mounting within me. His eyes
gripped mine with a hold almost palpable. He was invading the
most secret recesses of my being, was stripping naked my very
soul.</p>

<p>Melodramatic phrases, but no phrases less turgid would
fit.</p>

<p>"It is most puzzling." Did I hear Astaris say that or was I
reading his thoughts? "There is something more than physical
chemistry, more than biological tropism, involved. It is plain
that he has an urge to hold her naked against his nakedness, to
merge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn you!" I yelled, outraged. "Damn your rotten, prurient
mind," and the wrath that exploded in my brain hurled me up the
stairs to smash him&mdash;</p>

<p>I smashed instead against&mdash;nothingness! Against a wall
invisible, immaterial, but as impenetrable as though a screen of
armor plate had sprung up between me and the little man.</p>

<p>Still so possessed of wrath that I did not apprehend its full
enormity, I clubbed at the unseen barrier with my fists. There
was no sound of impact, none at all, but my knuckles were bruised
and bleeding. I kicked at empty air and saw the toes of shoes
buckle against nothing I could see. Exhausted, I put palms
against it and felt perdurable nothingness warm as though it were
animate flesh, vibrant with some ineluctable life, impenetrable
as granite.</p>

<p>And all the time Achronos Astaris watched me with a cold,
mildly interested detachment, as some scientist might watch a
Siamese fighting fish batter its nose against glass inserted into
its aquarium to bar it from the other <i>Betta</i> it has marked
as its victim.</p>

<p>He sighed now as I hung, panting and weak against the
invisible partition. "You learned quite quickly. There is a
definite advance in five hundred years."</p>

<p>I stared at him too choked to speak by anger that had not
subsided at all.</p>

<p>Oddly, while Astaris was still clear and distinct as he had
been, the staircase, the ceiling and the walls were fading again
into the gray, shapeless blur out of which they had formed. I
glanced down, anger giving way to panic! There was only grayness
beneath me, empty grayness! I looked behind. Nothing was behind
me but a fearsome gray vacancy. I was enclosed by it, suspended
in it. Once more the terror of height possessed me, the
vertiginous, heart-stopping awareness of an unfathomable abyss
into which I must plunge when Achronos Astaris released me.</p>

<p>For, wheeling again, I had found his eyes upon me, pulsating
pinpoints of black flame, and it seemed to me that only those
eyes held me where I was. Not the eyes but an impalpable
something, a Force unknowable, that merely manifested itself in
those eyes as it reached through the infrangible barrier that had
frustrated my attack on Astaris, and embraced me.</p>

<p>And those eyes were not only holding me there, suspended. They
were dissecting me, not my body but my ego? soul?&mdash;the me
that is not physical yet lacking which I would not be. Keen,
cutting lancets, they were peeling layer after layer from my
psyche, searching, searching for something that was there but
that they could not find.</p>

<p>Anger they found, and fear, and bewildered awe transcending
fear, but that for which they probed they could not find.
Gradually they faltered, at a loss. And then I was aware that
Astaris had given up his search, that he was sending a message
out into the boundless ether, that he was waiting for a
reply.</p>

<p>I do not know, even yet, how I knew all this. I know only that
for a little while I had the power, and that I was soon to lose
it.</p>

<p>"No," the answer came. Not a voice. Not sound at all. Naked
thought from an infinite distance. "Send him to us, but you must
remain yet awhile."</p>

<p>Astaris did not like that. I was aware he did not, but I was
aware also that he would submit. Abruptly fear flared into
terror, into such paralyzing, agonized terror that it rocked the
very foundations of my mind.</p>

<p>Now! NOW! <i>Astaris' eyes released me!</i> Astaris himself
was obliterated by an inward swoop of the grayness. It swirled
about me, and I was enveloped by a dizzy darkness.</p>

<p>Not darkness! An absence of form, of color, of reality itself.
I was falling through nothingness. I was not <i>falling.</i> I
was caught up in some vast maelstrom. I was whirling through some
spaceless, timeless non-existence altogether beyond experience. I
was rushing headlong through incalculable distances, distances
beyond comprehension, yet I knew myself to be altogether
motionless. The Universe had fallen away from me, was somewhere
behind me, light centuries behind me. I was beyond life. I was
beyond death. I was beyond being itself.</p>

<p>And all about me was the soft, voiceless whisper of swirling
dust.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">6. A SKY TOO LOW, A FEAR TOO
GREAT</a> </h2>

<p class="first">It ended.</p>

<p>The catapulting rush through infinite distances that were not
distances at all, the headlong flight that was static as the
stars, ended as it had begun; without jar and without
transition.</p>

<p>There was solidity beneath my feet. There was vision once more
in my eyes. I was John March again and I was back to reality.</p>

<p>Reality? I stood on a slight eminence in the center of a
desolate plain across which a jumble of shattered, great boulders
stretched to a horizon strangely too near. There was
something&mdash;incoherent was the word that rose in my
mind&mdash;in the shape of the rocks, in the dim hues of their
fractured surfaces, and their shadows were not black as shadows
ought to be, but a grayish purple. They lay in dark pools about
the shattered rocks and the light that made them streamed
sourceless out of a sky too low for any normal sky.</p>

<p>The sky weighed upon me as a storm sky would, heavy and
ominous, but although no star hung in it, no moon nor star, it
was lucidly transparent so that I knew no cloud mass made of it
the lowering dome it was. And it was informed with a color such
as no sky ever has had, an earthy and fathomless brown that
seemed innate in the very air.</p>

<p>The brown lucence bathed the plain, wan and shimmering, and it
dawned on me that the wrongly shaped rocks marched toward and
past me across the plain as though once they had formed endless
collonades and anciently had been smashed by some unimaginable
cataclysm. And it seemed to me that in the gray-purple shadows of
the rocks Things lurked so outrageous in shape that they had
crawled into the deepest shadows to hide even from
themselves.</p>

<p>Strangest of all, this landscape seemed vaguely familiar.</p>

<p>A sky too low? A sense of imminent threat? I felt, I swear
that I felt fingers brush my eyes and in memory I saw a slim,
graceful shape and behind it&mdash;</p>

<p><i>This was the vista that momentarily I had seen, or thought
I had seen, form out of the dark, amorphous background of the
portrait of Evelyn Rand.</i> </p>

<p>My pulses hammered. Evelyn was somewhere in this gaunt and
brooding land. As surely as I knew that I was here myself, I knew
that somewhere here was the girl I had sought so long, the girl
that in the last few terrible minutes&mdash;I'd learned I loved.
Somewhere, there had been a landmark in the fleeting glimpse I'd
had of this land in the art gallery on Madison Avenue. I turned
slowly, searching for it.</p>

<p>And found it.</p>

<p>It loomed against the horizon of the strange low sky, an
immensity hewn out of some starless night somehow solid. Black as
night and as lustreless, it blotted out a full quadrant of the
horizon to which I'd turned, a stygian escarpment deeply scarred
and awesome in grandeur, and I now saw that the shattered pillars
marched to it from every point of the compass and that their
final coming together was buried beneath a black detritus of
fragments riven from the monument by the same catastrophe that
had destroyed them.</p>

<p>Fragments? They were masses huge as houses and myriads of them
were piled in that wide, nocturnal tumulus, yet so tremendous was
the shape from which they'd been torn that its configuration had
been altered only as much as weathering may alter some heroic
statue.</p>

<p>A statue it was, vast beyond any concept of vastness, but of
what?</p>

<p>Its haunched body, on whose flanks the skin hung in pendulous
folds that were mountainsides in themselves, was a beast's. Its
legs&mdash;the hinder ones miles-long ridges folded under the
colossal body, the fore-limbs soaring towers&mdash;were an
animal's in contour and posture. But the tremendous head was not
that of a beast.</p>

<p>Nor was it human.</p>

<p>It was sunk neckless between the figure's shoulders. It was
wide-jawed, lean-jowled. The eyes were hooded with a black,
scalp-tight hood, yet somehow I was aware of them, aware of the
waiting that brooded in them as long as all the centuries that
have been and will yet be, the patience endless as Time.</p>

<p>Impossible to describe that stupendous countenance whose very
wrinkles were ravines, impossible not to read in its lineaments a
knowledge that transcended the inner mysteries of the Universe
and probed to where Space itself ceases to exist.</p>

<p>Limned in that face was all Good. And yet&mdash;</p>

<p>And yet stupendously below it, where the curve of one
sculptured paw rose out of the jumbled shards, was the shattered
outline of another figure modelled out of some pinkish and
fleshlike stone. This was the representation of a man and he was
contorted in unendurable agony, and into him were driven the
monstrous claws to pin him down.</p>

<p>Good above, Evil below. Love above, Hate below and the
esoteric knowledge in the vast countenance was that in the
eternity-long progress of life from its inchoate beginnings to
its ultimate goal, Good and Evil, Love and Hate, are one and the
same.</p>

<p>How long I stood immobile, scarcely breathing, possessed
wholly by that wonder, I shall never know. How long I might have
remained in its spell I cannot tell, for abruptly I was torn from
it by the rattle of small stones behind me and a deep-chested,
ferocious bellow.</p>

<p>I snatched up a fist-size stone as I whirled, saw that the
avid roar was not meant for me. Near the base of my mound a man
rolled, scrabbling to regain his feet, and a gorilla leaped
toward him, would reach him before he could possibly do so.</p>

<p>With some unformed idea of distracting the shaggy brute I let
out an incoherent yell and started running across its line of
sight. The beast twisted, saw me, bounded not towards me but
angling to intercept me; and as I realized that the slope was
steeper than I thought, that I could not change direction. I
discerned also that he was no beast. A furry pelt was draped
across the hairy torso and over its big-thewed shoulder, and his
huge calloused hand clutched the wood handle of a flint-headed
axe.</p>

<p>A yard from me, that axe lifted&mdash;I flung my stone, and by
sheer luck it struck the Stone Age weapon's head squarely, jolted
it from the dawn man's grip. But I could not stop my impetuous
rush, plunged headlong into him. I got in one blow that might
have been the flick of a butterfly's wing for all the effect it
had on him, and then his shaggy arms folded me to his barrel
chest and constricted, drove the breath out of me, squeezed my
ribs. Sight dimmed&mdash;</p>

<p>I was on my knees, hanging head down on arms that knuckled the
stony ground, and the dark bulk shuddering to lifelessness on the
ground here beside me incredibly was the Neanderthal man who'd
almost taken my life. <i>"Ve vous remercier,"</i> a light, almost
musical voice said above me, <i>"A fond de ma couar je vous
remercier."</i></p>

<p>It was the man whom the brute had pursued who thanked me for
saving his life. He wiped blood from a long and slender poniard
with a lacy but tattered kerchief, and his spindly legs were
sheathed in long hose of maroon silk laddered by runs. A sort of
vest with sleeves wrapped mangy blue velvet about his meagre
chest, and the ruffles at his neck and sleeves were ragged and
dingy.</p>

<p>He scabbarded his poniard at his belt and bent to me, his
sharp featured, predatory countenance anxious, and spoke again in
his queer, archaic French which, oddly, I had no difficulty in
comprehending. "You are much hurt, my old?"</p>

<p>"No." I let him help me up. "Not much." He seemed to
understand my English as well as I did his French, for he looked
relieved. "Seems to me it's I who ought to thank you, mister. I'd
have been done for if you hadn't sunk that dagger into him."</p>

<p>"But no." Under a wide brimmed hat, its plumes fluttering, his
hair was gray but the scar of an old slash gave a permanently
raffish twist to his mouth, and his cheeks, blued by stubble,
were sunken and emaciated. "It is my life that I owe to you,
monsieur, and though it has many times been declared forfeit to
the King's justice, I still set upon it a certain value." The
sidewise cant of his eyes was slinking and furtive but in them
was a certain dark sparkle of gaiety and about his lank, bony
figure there was a swaggering devil-be-damnedness altogether
intriguing. "If you had not come to my rescue you would not have
been in danger so great."</p>

<p>He swept that wide hat from his head and brought it to his
breast as he bowed. "I salute you, monsieur. Such clan, such
courage I have not often seen in a life perhaps too much filled
with episodes that have required them." He returned the hat to
his jauntily cocked head. "If I may have the honor of being made
acquainted with your name?"</p>

<p>"John March," I told him, somewhat dazed by this
ebullience.</p>

<p>"John March. I shall not forget it when once again I set about
my <i>Grant Testamente.</i> A vilanelle, perhaps, to express my
gratitude. I shall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your <i>Grant Testamente!"</i> I blurted. "A vilanelle? Who
are you? In the name of all that is holy, <i>who are
you!"</i></p>

<p>"There is very little holy about me." A bitter smile twisted
the man's thin mouth. "Or so the abbot of Paris would hold. A
jailbird, a liar, a thief. A consort of slitpurses and doxies. A
picklock, a runagate o'nights and a lack-brained clerk by day.
And&mdash;" He straightened, and drew pride around him like a
cloak. "And a poet of sorts, I hope. My name&mdash;for what it is
worth&mdash;Francois Villon."</p>

<p>"Villon!" I gasped. "You're kidding me. Francois Villon died
four hundred years ago."</p>

<p>"No," the man in doublet and hose said. "Villon did not die.
His sins overtaking him at last, he was banished from his beloved
Paris. He trudged out through the Porte Sainte Jacques, all he
possessed on his back and in a starveling packet under his arm.
He plodded out on the Orleans road, weary of life, weary unto
death. Though the day was breathless, a tiny swirl of dust
whispered towards him, and," once more he bowed, "here you find
Francis Villon. Not dead. Most assuredly not dead."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" I still could not bring myself to believe him.
"But four centuries. It is impossible!"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my friend," interrupted Francois Villon, "is
impossible. Least of all in this land where Time&mdash;" He
paused.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In this Land," he began again, "where Time is not."</p>

<p>"Where Time&mdash;! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That, my friend, you will learn&mdash;too soon." Villon was
once more furtive, his eyes sliding away from mine as he said,
"Suppose you satisfy the curiosity that is ever a flame burning
within me, and burning me. You are from Britain?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered. "From America." I recalled that the Western
Hemisphere had just been discovered in his day, that he might not
know the name. "From the continent, Columbus
discovered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," he cut in. "I know. She has told me of it. The maiden
with the hair of honey and the gray eyes that hide laughter and
dreams."</p>

<p>I grabbed his arm, my fingers bruising the thin flesh. "You've
seen her, talked with her!" I could hardly get the words out.
"She is here."</p>

<p>"She is here indeed. I&mdash;" He stopped abruptly. He was
looking over my shoulder, and his face was suddenly pallid.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" I demanded. "Take me to her."</p>

<p>"No," Villon responded, and his voice was hollow with fear. "I
cannot take you to the fair Evelyn. I cannot take you anywhere.
For our hosts appear. I had thought to escape them, but they have
found me and they have found you, and now there is no longer any
hope for us, or for Evelyn Rand, or for that pleasant world into
which we were born and which we shall never see again."</p>

<p>The air burst into an infinitude of darting sparks, green and
blue and yellow and scarlet. My skin prickled sharply. Somewhere
a white orb blazed. It was the hub of the sparks that immediately
whirled about it in countless threadlike circles of luminance
that merged into a solid shining disk. This drew in upon its
dazzling center.</p>

<p>It was no longer light at all but a Shape, a Thing grotesque
and weird and incredible, where nothing had been seconds
before.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">7. THE EMPTY SHAPE OF A MAN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Francois Villon was laughing. There was no
amusement in his high, thin laugh, but a sort of wild despair and
a sort of madness. Mad indeed was that which had materialized out
of a whirl of coruscant light and poised now before us.</p>

<p>It was almost all head, three-quarters a huge ovoid head;
yellow-gray skin naked of hair drawn tightly over a monstrous
skull. Two enormous eyes, lidless and lashless, swam with an oily
iridescence. The head's face had no nose, unless two black
orifices just below its midpoint were nares. A round, tiny mouth
beneath these putative nostrils was innocent of lips or teeth.
Where ears should be, two circular areas of skin pulsed as though
the brain within momentarily would burst through membranes too
frail to restrain it.</p>

<p>The rest, invested by some dark hued, horny integument, was a
bulbous torso out of which grew two boneless tentacles each
terminated by splayed and writhing branches&mdash;caricatures of
hands. Legs there must have been also, and feet of sorts, for the
apparition stood upright as a man stands.</p>

<p><i>"Voila,</i> John March," Villon chuckled, "he who calls
himself Kass."</p>

<p>It was that chuckle, I think, the amazing effrontery of it,
that set my thought processes going again. I did not really see
this thing, I told myself. I was the victim of a hypnotic
illusion induced by the whirling lights and the white blaze at
its center. It was not, it could not be real.</p>

<p>I dragged the side of my hand across my eyes, and looked
again, and the great head was still there, its bulging eyes fixed
upon me. In their gaze was the same hard, impersonal speculation
I had so resented in Achronos Astaris. Somehow more dreadful it
was now, for Astaris at least had been human, while this...</p>

<p>"I am human," Kass broke in. "A million years more human than
you." He did not <i>say</i> it. The words were within my own
mind, a thought perceived, not heard, but it must have come from
him. I could not have formulated it.</p>

<p>Moreover, Villon heard the soundless message too. "A million
years more human than you or I," he drawled to prove it, his
accents slurred. "Look well, my friend. See to what all mankind's
aspirations, all mankind's strivings, shall bring us in the end."
My gaze shifted to him. A sardonic grin twisted those thin,
scarred lips of his. "In truth there must be a God, for only God
could play so bitter a jest."</p>

<p>What they were saying seemed so much grim nonsense, but before
I had time to react to it I became aware that Kass's attention
had swung to Villon, and I sensed that Kass was puzzled. Once
more I was reminded of Astaris, of how when the strange little
man had demanded from me the meaning of love I had felt him to be
troubled by some queer urgency, by some driving need for a
knowledge that was denied him.</p>

<p>"Why do you not fear me?" Kass was inquiring of the Frenchman.
"There is the consciousness of utter defeat in you, and despair,
but you do not fear me. Why?"</p>

<p>"Fear you?" Villon murmured, insolence in the cant of his
narrow head, divine contempt in the stance of the scrawny frame
on whose bony angles hung his tattered finery. "I? Who have made
a ballade of love's betrayal and a villanelle of torture's rack?
Who have metered a rondeau by the clatter of my best friend's
bones swung from a gibbet, and flung a roundelay to the rabble
with the hangman's knot under my own left ear? Fear you? I who
have listened to the music of the Universe and dreamed the dreams
of the angels and the damned?</p>

<p>"There is that within me Lucifer cannot touch, nor the God
your existence blasphemes destroy. I have gone up into a Heaven
of my own devising and down into a Hell of my own imagining, and
you can show me no terrors I have not known aforetime. Fear you?
I am a poet."</p>

<p>He slapped the face of Kass with his mocking laugh, and there
was a hush that was not of sound alone. Or there may have been
some reply, but I did not know of it, for in that instant the
corner of my eye caught furtive movement among the rocks and my
look slid to it, my head not turning.</p>

<p>I glimpsed them only for an eye-blink before the shadows hid
them, but in that split-second I saw them clearly and I knew I
could not be mistaken, though reason insisted I must be. Reason,
even with the animate, tangible presence of Francois Villon to
confute it, insisted I could not have seen a knight in chain mail
and a forester in the brilliant green of Sherwood Forest peering
from behind a boulder's jagged edge, gesturing to me not to
betray them.</p>

<p>I did something then that until that moment I should not have
dreamed either possible or necessary. I deliberately blotted what
I'd seen out of my consciousness, made myself think of something
else at once; of the way the pallid and sourceless light
glimmered on the round of Kass's skull, of how his monstrous
shadow was a grayish-purple like no shadow I had elsewhere
seen.</p>

<p>And I did this just in time, for once more he was reading me.
"Matters stranger to you than the color of a shadow there will be
to wonder at," he remarked, "before we are prepared to deal with
you." It is difficult to convey the feeling
of&mdash;nakedness&mdash;given one by the realization that one's
thoughts are exposed to another. "Come. The Council awaits
me."</p>

<p>"Lead on, fellow," I said, trying to get jauntiness into my
tone. Villon had set me an example of courage I was ashamed not
to emulate. "Whither thou goest I shall go." I rather suspected I
wouldn't be very successful if I objected, and, too, I had a
pretty good hunch that wherever he wanted to take me would bring
me nearer Evelyn Rand.</p>

<p>No. All this weirdness into which I had been plunged had not
driven the thought of her from my mind. Rather it had multiplied
many times my anxiety for her. If she were here, and in the power
of creatures like this...</p>

<p>A stinging prickle netted my body. Kass's fingers were
touching my shoulder; his other hand gripped Villon. "Come!" It
was as if abruptly I was at the heart of a maelstrom of some
electric force. Panic struck at me. I had felt this same
sensation at the moment the grotesque being appeared. Was I about
to dissolve into a whirl of flashing, multi-colored sparks?</p>

<p>Nothing happened. Nothing except that the rocks about, the
ground beneath, abruptly were flowing past us. We were
motionless. It was the plain, the horizon, that moved. A sharp,
twanging sound came from my left. Kass's touch was gone and the
speeding earth pulled my feet from beneath me. I pitched forward
headlong. Falling, I twisted, saw the writhing fingers that had
released me pluck something from the air. A feathered arrow!</p>

<p>My shoulder hit the now motionless dirt. "Up, <i>St.
George!"</i> a deep-chested voice bellowed, metal rattling
through it. "Have at thee, hell spawn!" The burly, mailed figure
I had glimpsed lunged out from behind a rock, his linked
gauntlets sweeping a great two-handed sword down upon our
captor's sickly-hued, immense skull. "Die, caitiff!" someone else
cried, and a lithe green figure leaped past Villon, also fallen,
and thrust a dagger at Kass's great eye.</p>

<p>The knight's broadsword shattered into a thousand clanging
shards; the forester's knife, arrested in blank air, shivered as
though it had jabbed into the trunk of an oak.</p>

<p>Neither blade had touched Kass, though the latter had not
moved by the tenth of an inch. No one was moving now. All the
fierce motion had stopped; the pounce of the ambushers from the
covert which the flow of the landscape had brought to us, the
skid of our momentum that had taken Villon and myself yards along
the suddenly halted ground.</p>

<p>The scene held. Kass; one tentacle lifted to grasp the arrow,
the membranes at either side of his gargantuan eyes a trifle
distended, no other sign of emotion about him. The knight;
bladeless hilt clutched in chain-gloved fists, longskirted cloak
of iron mesh enveloping columnar legs straddled to give
foundation to his futile blow, all his head but his swarthy,
hate-darkened face swathed in metal fabric, all his immense
strength impotent. The other, the forester&mdash;</p>

<p>He was a lithe and slender arc, fluid movement abruptly rigid.
His shoes, of some soft, chamois-like leather and pointed of toe,
were green. His taut legs were tightly sheathed to the waist in
the emerald of May leaves and his sleeveless leather jerkin
repeated the hue as did the fabric that puffed about his
shoulders and enveloped his extended arm, thrusting a dagger into
the nothingness that held it. In spite of a flame-colored beard
his countenance was youthful and debonair, though contorted now
by a furious despair. The green, conical hat he wore sported a
cocky, crimson feather.</p>

<p>Curious how one's mind works sometimes. There was in mine at
that instant, not disappointment at the failure of the ambush I
had anticipated and done my best not to betray, not consternation
at the manner in which Kass had defeated it, but only a sort of
dazed amazement at the anachronistic assembling of the figures in
that strange tableau.</p>

<p>The cut of his coat of mail dated the sword-wielder as from
the twelfth century. It was in the fourteenth that the
Lincolnshire lads prowled Sherwood Forest attired in the green
the forester wore. Francois Villon's Paris was that of the
fifteen hundreds, and I&mdash;my birth date was the year nineteen
hundred and twenty. Kass aside, we represented eight centuries of
history. Eight hundred years! Absurd! They were
masqueraders&mdash;</p>

<p>What of the Dawn Man I had fought and Villon had slain? That
slavering brute had been no actor. Abruptly I was cold with
recollection of the Frenchman's words: "Nothing, my friend, is
impossible in this Land Where Time is Not," and then I was cold
with something more imminent; a sound, a toneless squeal so
shrill that it was at the upper threshold of hearing, a high,
thin whine that pierced my ears and set my teeth on edge. It came
from the tiny, puckered mouth that seemed so ludicrously inept in
the vast yeasty expanse of Kass's visage and it was the first
actual sound I had heard him utter.</p>

<p>It went on and on like a wire pulling through my brain, a blue
fine wire that was all edge, all wounding edge. It flickered out
into the dull, desolate glow brooding over that plain of tumbled
rock and ominous shadows, and somewhere out there it found a
response. Somewhere from among the malformed boulders, from among
the gray-purple shadows that lurked at their bases and filled the
mouths of their caves with mystery, <i>something</i> was
answering Kass.</p>

<p>I rolled, tried to find the source of that second thin whine.
My straining eyes could discover nothing alive in all that dreary
tumulus. I saw only vacant chaos, only the gaping empty maws of
caverns filled by impenetrable shadows.</p>

<p>The shadows were lengthening. That was queer, here where there
was no sun to lower; then I realized that only one of the shadows
was lengthening. It was flowing like a dark cloud, out of the
mouth of a nearby cave. Like a gray-purple fog that somehow had
more substance than a fog, it still was formless as drifting
mist.</p>

<p><i>"Pater Noster in excelsis..."</i> I heard Villon mumble a
Latin prayer. And then I heard him gasp, "A drina. God preserve
us! I thought they were chained to their lairs by the light."</p>

<p>The cloud parted from the shadow and was a shapeless blob
about the size of a small auto, moving more and more swiftly
toward us. The tenuous whine that answered Kass's call came from
it. It was animate with a blind and groping sort of life, yet it
had no shape. Or rather its shape was constantly changing as it
billowed toward us, as once in a microscope I had seen the
outlines of an amoeba change. Because of this it had no identity,
but individuality it had in full measure, and a terrible
malevolence.</p>

<p>Kass's call rose shriller. The approach of that purple-gray
mass grew swifter, and something in the sightless way it moved
made me more certain that were it not for the strange sound Kass
made it would not have appeared, and having appeared would not
know which way to move. I could see it more clearly, could see
now that near its center there was a throbbing spot of deeper
purple that did not change in shape, and I was afraid.</p>

<p>I was deathly afraid of the thing Villon had called a
<i>drina.</i> I was afraid of it because, for all its
formlessness, for all its blindness, I sensed intelligence within
it, and I knew that intelligence was different in some terrible
way from the intelligence of any creature I'd ever known.</p>

<p>Its shrill whine had an eager sound now. It rushed past me and
two heart-stopping screams twisted me about!</p>

<p>Knight and forester hung high above the ground, each wrapped
around the waist by one of Kass's pipestem tentacles. They were
puppets with jerking, boneless limbs, with white masks on which
the features had been ineptly splotched, so little of human had
terror left in them. The drina boiled toward them.</p>

<p>Kass flung them down and the gray-purple mass rolled over
them. Rolled over them and&mdash;rolled past where they'd fallen,
and they were no longer there.</p>

<p>I saw them! I saw them sprawled within that monstrous purple
bulk, forms blurred and indistinct like shapes seen in a pea-soup
fog&mdash;and <i>still alive!</i> Still moving. And then, as the
pitch of Kass's squeal changed, <i>I saw them melt.</i></p>

<p>The drina was scudding away towards the nearest shadow-pool,
reached it, merged with it. It was gone, and mailed knight and
green-clad forester were gone, and there was only Kass, poised
here, motionless and silent now, to all appearances already
oblivious to what had occurred.</p>

<p>On the ground between him and the cave into which the drina
had vanished lay the bladeless hilt of a two-handed sword, a
dagger, and a heap of iron links that still retained the empty
shape of a man. That was all...</p>

<p>Not quite. A little farther away, caught on jagged stone, a
conical green hood flaunted a cocky, crimson feather.</p>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8">8. ADALON, CITY OF DREAD</a> </h2>

<p class="first">"They were fools," I heard Villon murmur. "But
they were brave fools. May God rest their troubled souls."</p>

<p>"Amen!" I managed to say.</p>

<p>Kass was gesturing for us to rise. I shoved shaking hands
against the ground to obey, but I was sick, mentally and
physically sick. I must have looked it, for the Frenchman,
misunderstanding, said as he rose lithely. "There is nothing for
you to fear, my friend. Not, at least, 'til you have served the
purpose for which they have brought you here, or until, like
those whose passing we have just looked upon, they have found you
useless for that purpose."</p>

<p>"They!" I snapped. "Who are they? And what do they want from
me?"</p>

<p>"He is one of them," Villon answered, nodding at the
approaching Kass, "and the others are as like him as I am like
you. They say they are men, as you have heard, and they say that
between them and us stretches a million years and more of time.
How that can be I do not know, yet neither do I know how it can
be that we two are met, living, and nearly of an age though four
centuries divide our natal days. If this smaller miracle can come
to pass, why not the greater?"</p>

<p>Before I could answer that Kass reached us and laid his
splayed hands on our shoulders. At once my body was again stung
with countless prickles, and the landscape was once more moving
past us.</p>

<p>It accelerated rapidly 'til the plain and the rocks and the
sky itself became nothing but a streaked, brownish blur whizzing
past us. We were not moving at all, it was everything outside of
us that moved. I felt not the slightest intimation of that inner
awareness of motion that the psychologists call the kinesthetic
sense. There was nothing around me, nothing to protect me, yet
there was no wind on my face...Wind! At this unguessable speed
the air should have been a solid thing, driving the breath from
my lungs, tearing the clothes from my back.</p>

<p>It was, I thought, as if somehow we were detached from the
Earth and it were spinning beneath us.</p>

<p>"You are not upon Earth at all," Kass's soundless voice told
me. "You are no longer in its space nor of its time."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I yelled. "What in hell do you mean?" I
shouted because I was frightened, because I was desperately
afraid&mdash;and hated myself for it.</p>

<p>"It shall be explained to you, if the Council so decides."
Kass seemed to be coldly interested in my agitation, in the way I
might have been interested, watching a puppy growl at its image
in a mirror. "You have, in what you already know, a foundation
for comprehension of the matter such as is possessed by none of
the others Astaris has sent us, except one. The female from your
own generation."</p>

<p>The female! Did he mean Evelyn? The landscape about us was
slowing! I made out that we were in a narrow, rugged ravine whose
rocky walls were speeding past us.</p>

<p>Then these were gone, and there was no longer any motion.</p>

<p>Some five hundred yards behind us was the towering tumulus
that had sped past us. Between it and us stretched a plain level
and uncluttered as a concrete highway at dawn.</p>

<p>Ahead, and too close for comfort, the ground dropped sharply
down as at the edge of a precipice and I was staring across miles
of sheer vacancy to another plateau. There was a shimmering,
dreamlike quality about this, an appearance, I discerned, due to
my seeing it through a peculiar quiver of the air that rose from
the curving edge of the chasm to the low, brooding sky. Like a
vast, transparent curtain this was, intangible yet very real.</p>

<p>"Down, my friend," the Frenchman said softly. "Look down."</p>

<p>I stepped a little nearer the verge of the cliff. I looked
down&mdash;a thousand feet, two thousand! I saw nothing but rock,
gently curving inward, glass-smooth rock glimmering with high
polish. My sight slid down another thousand feet and another, to
where that astounding wall curved inward and levelled out to
become the bottom of a vast bowl, a mile deep and five miles, I
was to learn, across the diameter of its circling rim.</p>

<p>I have mentioned once, I think, the effect of height upon me.
Now the illness seized me; my stomach went plummeting down into
that yawning gulf. My muscles lost all strength. I toppled
forward over the brink of that awful precipice...I did not fall.
I hung, arms sprawled out, a scream choked in my throat, my skin
clammy with the sweat of terror. I hung above that sheer and
terrible drop, and I was sustained by nothing I could feel or
see.</p>

<p>Kass did not seem to notice but Villon pulled me back and
stood me erect on legs gone rubbery, and he smiled at me and
said, "You could not fall, my friend."</p>

<p>Our captor's bulging eyes were unfocussed, he was motionless
as if absorbed in some weird voiceless communication with someone
I could not see. I pulled in breath. "What do you mean, I could
not fall?"</p>

<p>"The Veil of Ishlak," Villon gestured to the shimmering
curtain that was no more substantial than the quiver of heated
air above a railroad track in midsummer, "will not permit you to.
So look down without fear, my friend, upon the city of Adalon
while yet there is time for you to see what manner of place it is
to which your fate has brought you."</p>

<p>I gritted my teeth and peered over that brink once more.
Nausea still made me most unhappy, but because I knew now that I
could not fall, the vertigo did not blind me. I took it by easy
stages, let my eyes drift slowly down along that infernal
wall.</p>

<p>My first impression of its smoothness was confirmed. The
contour of the precipice was utterly regular, too regular to be
natural. This abysmal pit had been quarried out of the solid
rock&mdash;not quarried. There were no marks of tools or
blasting. It seemed, rather, that the huge depression had been
hollowed out by a heat so great that the unwanted stone had
boiled into vapor and steamed away.</p>

<p>That was, of course, manifestly impossible, but how otherwise
the formation could be explained I did not know. My gaze reached
the level floor of the bowl. I saw the city of Adalon, dwarfed by
height and laid out for me like a map.</p>

<p>Its structures were of the same color and texture as the rock,
as though they had not been built but had grown or been moulded
out of it. They were square and squat and ugly and no attempt at
beautification, no thought of anything but utility, was evident
in their design.</p>

<p>One, at the very center of the circular area, dominated all
the rest by reason of its vastly greater size, and differed from
them also in having a domed roof instead of a flat one. There
were eleven other buildings. They were of varying sizes and they
were scattered about the bowl's floor at varying distance from
the hub, yet I had a curious sense that they were located
according to some definite plan, and that the plan had some
meaning for me.</p>

<p>"Like a sow and its rooting piglets," Villon murmured, "are
they not? And see, some of the piglets themselves have their own
offspring clinging close."</p>

<p>"Yes." Except for the central building and the two nearest it,
each of the structures of Adalon had other smaller ones very near
to it. The third had only one, the fourth two, but there were
nine about the fifth.</p>

<p>The sixth also had nine&mdash;but these were connected by a
wide-topped circular wall in which they were embedded like
scattered stones in a ring. "Saturn," I exclaimed. "The ringed
planet. The planet with nine satellites and a ring." Now I knew
what Adalon's design represented. "The biggest building at the
center is the Sun. Mercury, nearest it, and Venus, have no
satellites. The Earth, third away, has one moon, Mars has two,
and Jupiter nine. It works out, by George, it works out. The
three the other side of Saturn would be Uranus and Neptune and
Pluto. Don't you see it, Villon? They've built their city in the
pattern of the Solar System, of the Sun and its planets."</p>

<p>He looked at me rather queerly. "The Sun and its planets," he
whispered. "Aye, it seems to me that once I heard the rector of
the university prate of this Mercury and Venus and Mars whereof
you speak, and Jupiter too, as stars in the sky of nights, though
those other names are strange to me. The Sun and its planets," he
repeated. "Now is there some meaning here? I have wondered why
they builded thus, higgledy-piggledy, when all else they do has a
straight design serving its purpose and no more."</p>

<p>There were little flecks of light between his drooping lids.
"Can it be," he whispered. "Can it be that these men a million
years older than us, to whom love and beauty and even awe of
their Creator are things forgotten and unknown, have yet some
sentiment left? A nostalgia, perchance, for the skies they have
forsaken, for the orbs that gave them birth?"</p>

<p>He had some other thought, some thought he was as carefully
blotting out of his consciousness as I had blotted from mine the
thought of the ambush that had failed so disastrously, and for
the same reason. But what he had said was enough to make me grab
his arm, my fingers digging in.</p>

<p>"Look here," I demanded. "Don't tell me you've swallowed all
that stuff Kass has been spilling. That this isn't the Earth, and
they're men of the future, and the rest of it."</p>

<p>Villon shrugged, expression draining from his narrow
countenance. "It is what they say and they do not lie. There is
much about them I do not know, but of one thing I am certain. To
the Ishlak in nothing is sacred save the Truth, and the Truth to
them is Divine."</p>

<p>I almost believed it all, in that moment I almost believed
that Kass and the others who had built Adalon were men of a
million years from my own time, that this strange place was not
on Earth, that it was beyond the Solar System, perhaps beyond
even our Galaxy. But not quite. It was too much to ask a man to
believe, too much to ask him to conceive. All that one has been
taught cannot be discarded in a single hour no matter how crowded
that hour has been with happenings that seem to controvert the
very essentials of one's philosophy.</p>

<p>Or was it an hour? Was it not years, a timeless time, since
I'd walked along a Brooklyn street&mdash;"Listen, Villon," I
exclaimed, recalling why I'd walked along that street. "Twice
you've mentioned Evelyn Rand. Was it down there that you met
her?"</p>

<p>"Aye," he replied and the sparkle was back in those black eyes
of his. "She brightened that city of dread so that one did not
quite so much miss the sun."</p>

<p>"Okay," I growled, my pulses pounding. "If she's in it, city
of dread or no I'm going down there."</p>

<p>"Yes" Villon sighed. "I think you are." He pointed a long
finger down to the dome of the central structure, and in that
great hemispherical roof a hole was opening, irislike. "I doubt
me that you will like much what you find there, yet I would give
my hopes of salvation, such as they are, if I were awaited as you
are in Adalon."</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9">9. "MORE MERCIFUL IS THE GALLOWS'
DROP"</a> </h2>

<p class="first">A silvery something leaped out of the aperture
of the roof of the structure I'd likened to the Sun. It shot, on
a long, steep slant, straight for us, and so fast was its flight
I could see nothing of it but blurred light streaking the
air.</p>

<p>In the next instant it was hanging before me, absolutely
motionless, in midair. Long axis horizontal, it was cylindrical,
one end blunt-tapered like the nose of a bullet, the other
square-cut. It was nine or ten feet long, about five in diameter.
It seemed to be made of some metal that was a little grayer than
silver, and it hovered there without visible support of any
kind.</p>

<p>The only man-made things I know of that might approximate this
feat are the balloon and the helicopter. No balloon could have
moved with anything like the speed this had, nor could one have
been brought to a standstill with such abruptness. It was no
helicopter either. It had no whirling windmill vanes. In fact, I
could make out no protruding part of any kind. The thing simply
and unequivocally defied gravity.</p>

<p>I had just about time to note this and to become aware of a
curious whirr that seemed to come from the object, when at its
nose there was a quick succession of crimson sparks. At once I
heard a long, ripping sound, like silk tearing.</p>

<p>"The Veil has parted," Villon answered my startled look,
gesturing to a still place in the curtain of shimmer, like an oil
slick on water. The projectile leaped inward, hissed along the
ground, was static again beside Kass, who seemed to be rousing
from his absorption. The whirr cut off.</p>

<p>"They call it a <i>stratcar,"</i> the Frenchman told me. "I
went to my knees in prayer when first one sprang upon me." Impish
amusement danced in his eyes, and he chuckled. "I was persuaded
that Lucifer in very person had arrived in it to claim my soul,
so many times over forfeit to him."</p>

<p>A pale inner glow wavered over the surface of that about which
he spoke, like waves of luminosity fluctuating over the surface
of superheated steel, yet within a long stride of it I felt no
heat. A white line was stripping along its side, from truncated
rear to where the taper of its prow began.</p>

<p>"The magic art," Villon's chatter continued, "by which they
cause the ground itself to flow past them, miles in a twinkling,
appears to fail them at the brink of this chasm. To reach their
Adalon from here they fly down to it in this iron contrivance.
They fly, mark you. Now this indeed fills me with doubt of my
senses, for while magic is a proper matter recognized by all
theologians and metaphysicians, for a man to build an engine that
flies, goes against Nature. Yet I swear to you, my John, that
this stratcar is no uncouth bird but a thing wrought out of
metal."</p>

<p>The line that slashed the side of it was widening. The upper
half of the stratcar's curved skin was sliding up and around.
From within it, toward the front, projected the big head and
bulbous upper body of a goggle-eyed individual who might be
Kass's twin except that the hard-looking stuff covering his torso
was a brilliant orange instead of the dark brown that clothed the
other.</p>

<p>Kass's tentacles lifted in what was evidently a salute. The
newcomer imitated him, perfunctorily. Then I realized that they
were conversing, though I heard nothing, aurally or within my
skull.</p>

<p>"Kass seems pretty damned respectful to this new goon," I
remarked. "Who is he? Mayor of Adalon?"</p>

<p>"He calls himself Daster," Villon replied. I thought I
detected a puzzled note in his voice, and his eyes were narrowed.
"The hue of his singlet marks him as a <i>Doctil</i>, as that of
Kass tells that he is a <i>Plebo.</i> Daster is one of the
<i>Kintat,</i> the Council of Five who rule this land, and that
he should come to meet us is passing strange. Does it mean that
something has occurred to change the even tenor of their ways
during my witless attempt at escape from them?"</p>

<p>I had already begun to suspect that the membranes at the sides
of the heads of the Adalonians were their sole features that
might be said to have expression. Those of both were vibrating
rapidly, seeming to confirm the poet's idea that they were
disturbed.</p>

<p>Their colloquy ended, Kass swung to us. "Go," he commanded.
"Into the stratcar."</p>

<p>Villon shrugged. "It appears that you are to have your wish,
John." He started for the strange vehicle and I followed him. I
can't say that I was very comfortable at that particular moment.
I didn't like being ordered around, for one thing. And for
another, Villon's warnings had convinced me that some very
unpleasant experiences were waiting for me in the place to which
I was about to be taken.</p>

<p>But Evelyn Rand was down there. There were two seats inside
the stratcar, very much like those of an auto. Daster occupied
the front one. I got into that in the rear, alongside Villon. I
was surprised that the conveyance did not roll as I pressed down
on its side, climbing in. It should have, balanced as it was on
its rounded bottom. It certainly should have. But it was rigid as
though that bottom lay flat against the ground.</p>

<p>I turned to see what would hold it steady when Kass got in,
but he did not. His tentacles lifted in repetition of the salute
with which he'd greeted Daster. The latter answered him, and then
the Plebo was moving away. We were moving away from him, rather,
though in relation to the ground we were not moving at all. The
mouth of the ravine across the plain swallowed him.</p>

<p>"Didn't he say that the Council was waiting for him?" I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," Villon breathed. "And that too is strange, for they do
not easily change their plans. Something indeed is not as it
should be in Adalon. Has it any meaning for us? Dare we
hope&mdash;?" he cut off, and I knew that once more he was
veiling his thoughts.</p>

<p>Ignoring us, Daster reached forward to a bank of buttons on
the back of the stratcar's nose, that was a circle-edged wall
before him. The vehicle's side-wall slid up from beyond Villon,
slid over and came down on my side. We were at once in absolute
darkness, a blackness that seemed to thumb my eyes with palpable
weight.</p>

<p>The lightlessness lasted only a second. Daster's grotesque
head was silhouetted against a greenish, spectral glow. The wall
in front of him had become a luminous screen on which, about the
level of my chest, rows of buttons were spots of scarlet. Above
these, vague blurs took form, became a picture in grays and
blacks of the plain outside, the high, rocky cliff that edged
it.</p>

<p>They have radar, I thought. But this is more highly developed
than any I know.</p>

<p>The Doctil touched another button. The stratcar filled with
the whirr I had heard as it hung in midair. Villon gasped and
caught at my arm, his fingers digging in.</p>

<p>The whole structure within which we were enclosed was
vibrating in correspondence with that whirr. I was thrown to the
right, hard against the carside, and Villon against my own left
side. The photo-like scene on the screen was whisking to the
right and I realized that the stratcar was spinning around to
point at the Veil through which it had come.</p>

<p>The pressure against my sides eased. The screened image was
steady again. Past Daster's head it photoed space and beyond it
the distant rim of the bowl within which Adalon lay. My ears
seemed stuffed with that infernal whirring. It rose in pitch and
I was forced against the back of the seat. Blankness flashed over
the screen...was replaced at once by a picture of a vast, glass-
smooth, curved precipice leaning precariously toward
us...shifting into a view of the bowl bottom lifted in a
disturbing slant so that the buildings seemed about to slide off
it.</p>

<p>Those buildings ballooned in size with breathtaking swiftness.
It was we who were catapulting down to them, of course, with
heart-stopping speed. The acceleration was a weight crushing me
against the seat-back, crushing in my chest. Pluto flicked off
the screen-edge. Uranus. Saturn. The screen showed only the
immense rounded dome of the House of the Sun, a lustrous
convexity against which we were going to smash!</p>

<p>A black splotch spotted the exact center of that roof-image,
widened to swallow it. I could breathe again. I was no longer
crushed in my seat. The whirr had ended. Light was coming into
the stratcar, a bar of daylight cutting horizontally across the
right hand wall, and widening rapidly. A bar of white sunlight,
not the drab, oppressive glow out of which we had just come.</p>

<p>The stratcar's upper half slid over and down beyond my
seatmate. The poet's eyes were closed. He had slumped, motionless
and limp.</p>

<p>I grabbed for his shoulder. "Villon," I exclaimed. If
something had happened to him. "Francois!" I realized how much
his indomitable cheerfulness, his insouciance, had endeared him
to me in the short time I'd known him. If I was still sane it was
because of his jauntiness, his gay fatalism.</p>

<p>His eyelids fluttered open and a rueful grimace twisted his
mocking lips. "Thus one must fall," he murmured, "when the gibbet
trap is sprung from beneath one's feet. But at the end of that
drop is at least oblivion, provided the executioner has rightly
knotted his noose. Aye, more merciful is the gallows' drop than
that which awaits us."</p>

<p>"You've got hanging on your mind a devil of a lot," I
snapped.</p>

<p>"And so would you, my John," he grinned wanly, "if you had
been condemned to hang as often as I have been."</p>

<p>I twisted to a touch on my shoulder. It was Daster's splayed
hand. He had climbed out of the stratcar and he wanted me to do
the same. We were in a barn-like room, its floor apparently of
the same fused and congealed rock that formed the sides of the
bowl. The illumination was not sunlight but came from a wide,
shining band circling the walls just where the domed ceiling
rested on them, walls that lacked any sign of door or window.</p>

<p>Our stratcar was one of many that stood in a straight row
across the chamber. Three Adalonians were clustered about a
machine whose nose had been stripped of its metal covering to
reveal an intricate mass of gears that they seemed to be
repairing. They were, judging by the brown of their torso
covering, Plebos, but an orange-clad Doctil was coming toward
us.</p>

<p>He reached us as I dismounted from the stratcar. "Gohret,"
Daster greeted him, lifting his tentacles in salute. "This is
John March, whom Astaris' last message concerned."</p>

<p>Gohret's great eyes rested on me very briefly, shifted to
Villon who by now stood beside me. "And the other, of course, is
the one who was lately found missing," he remarked. "I understand
that the scanners located him near the entrance whorl."</p>

<p>"Exactly," Daster agreed. "And so Kass was able to pick up
both at once and bring them to the brink together."</p>

<p>"Have you determined how this Villon succeeded in penetrating
the Veil of Ishlak?"</p>

<p>"No. Kass reported that he evidently has learned how to
conceal his thoughts from us. We shall have to probe his mind in
the observation cell."</p>

<p>"Which must be done at once. We must find and punish the Plebo
who assisted him. If it was a Plebo." Seeing the two together in
that bright light I realized that there was a definite variance
in their appearance, difficult to describe but differentiating
them sufficiently for recognition. "I shall take charge of him
and have the matter attended to immediately."</p>

<p>It seemed to me that Daster resented Gohret's dictatorial
tone, but he said nothing to confirm this impression. "Come
along," Gohret commanded Villon. "Unless you wish to tell us now
that which we want to know."</p>

<p>Francois' lip curled scornfully. "I am too experienced a
jailbird to be frightened into blabbing by hints of torture."</p>

<p>"We are not compelled to resort to torture," Gohret responded,
"to obtain information we desire. Our methods are
more&mdash;efficient."</p>

<p>Villon winced. In spite of your pretty speech about a poet and
fear, I thought, you're scared, my friend. Hellish scared. That's
because you don't know what they're going to do to you and that
excellent imagination of yours is working overtime.</p>

<p>"Come along," Gohret commanded again, reaching a long tentacle
for Francois. The latter shrank back against the stratcar and the
Doctil's writhing limb wrapped around him. Villon's mouth gaped
in a soundless scream as agony grayed his face. I swung a fist at
the Adalonian. Its knuckles sank into squashy, rot-soft flesh
under Gohret's tiny mouth and my other fist, driving in, was
caught in midair as Daster's arms roped me, lifted me from the
floor. I kicked back at him, furiously. My heels crunched. Pain
rayed through me, traced every nerve in my body.</p>

<p>I hung from those terrible tentacles, paralyzed, halfblinded
and, inconsequently, resenting it that the Plebos had not even
turned from their work to watch me fight.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friend," Villon called, his voice thin with his
own agony. "You meant well but you could have done me no good, no
good at all." Gohret's tentacle grooved the poet's scrawny chest
and on the back of Villon's dangling hand blood trickled from the
crushed flesh of his arm. "You cannot help me." They were
sinking, visibly they were sinking into the floor and unless I
was mistaken&mdash;I must be mistaken&mdash;the floor rose along
their bodies undisturbed.</p>

<p>"Farewell, John March." He was smiling. He actually was
smiling up at me, the indomitable fellow, only his shoulders and
his head and his plumed hat still visible. "Tell the fair Evelyn
that though I go now into eternal darkness I take with me the
recollection of the gray-eyed Angel I met in Hell."</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10">10. SOME INCREDIBLE
OTHERWHERE</a> </h2>

<p class="first">The floor was solid over where Francois Villon
had vanished. Daster set me down and the power of my muscles
returned and the agony of my nerves faded.</p>

<p>I was alone in that stratcar hangar now with those strange
beings that were so unhuman in appearance and yet so oddly human.
I was alone and, I admit it without shame, I was afraid.</p>

<p>It was my turn, now, to be punished. For striking Gohret. For
kicking at Daster. I faced around to the remaining Doctil, doing
my best to stand straight, forcing myself to look into his mucid
eyes. They were coldly impersonal. They lay upon me for what
seemed a long time, altogether without emotion. Astaris had
looked at me like that, and Kass, and slow resentment welled up
in me again at the sense of inferiority that steady, speculative
gaze inflicted upon me.</p>

<p>Daster's arm lifted in a gesture, and I knew I was to go with
him&mdash;somewhere.</p>

<p>We started moving across the hangar floor, myself a little
ahead. The Plebos to one side busied themselves with their task,
not for one instant interrupted.</p>

<p>Where was I being taken? We were walking directly towards the
opposite wall of that vaulted chamber, and there was nothing
there but the blind face of the stone. It was so highly polished
that it reflected us, vaguely. There was no seam where it rounded
into the floor. Floor and wall and dome were of one piece, like
concrete that had been formed in a mould. But they were not
concrete. They were rock. How could rock have been poured that
way?</p>

<p>"All things are plastic," Daster answered me, "at some degree
of heat."</p>

<p>"True enough." Aeons ago, I recalled from my geology, the
Earth itself was molten, shaped into an orb by the very speed of
its spinning, bulging at the equator because there the
centrifugal force was the greatest. "But the heat that melts rock
is so great that it would be impossible for men to shape it, in
such large masses at any rate."</p>

<p>"Nothing," the Doctil answered, "is impossible to man."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;!" I stopped short. I was face to face with my
reflection in the wall, another half-step would bring me against
it.</p>

<p>"Go on, John March." His hand on my back shoved me forward,
gently. I went into that rock...<i>Not against</i> it,
<i>into</i> it! It impeded me no more than so much air, but for a
moment I was blinded by intangible grayness. Then there was light
again and I was in a narrow corridor that spiralled downward, the
pitch so steep that I had to lean back and dig heels to keep
myself from going too fast.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what the devil!" I couldn't help the exclamation.
"How did that happen?"</p>

<p>"Matter is not really solid," Daster answered, "as you should
know, but is composed of vibrating electrons separated by spaces
compared to which their own sizes are minute. The rate of
vibration of the wall rock has been adjusted so that the
electrons of which we are composed may flow through,
<i>between</i> its particles."</p>

<p>"It's as simple as all that, is it?" I tried to be sarcastic.
"Good thing the boys in Sing Sing don't know about it or they'd
walk out some fine morning."</p>

<p>"Precisely. Except that the technique of changing the
vibration rate of the prison walls would have been beyond the
ability of even the most profound scientists of your time. That
was not developed until some five hundred years after your
period."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" I wasn't going to let myself be worked up again by
the way these people kept tossing the centuries about,
regardless. "Just a little matter of five hundred years." If I
let myself believe that time had folded into itself, Daster and
his friends might really be a million years beyond me in
evolution. The inevitable implication of that would be that I was
up against people I could have no hope of fighting. And I wasn't
ready to admit that, not quite yet. "Just the day after tomorrow
to you."</p>

<p>"No," Daster dissented, dryly. "The day before yesterday."</p>

<p>Now what could I do about that except shut up? We kept on
going down and around, and though my own footfalls echoed within
the confines of that interminable spiral, the Adalonian's
movements were soundless. A Latin tag came out of my high school
days&mdash;<i>facile descensus Averni</i>, greasy is the descent
to Hades&mdash;and the speculation trailed across my mind that
perhaps I had died in that old house on Brooklyn Heights; that,
as disembodied soul, I wandered through some Afterland beyond
death.</p>

<p>Abruptly the passage leveled out under my feet, straightened
out. Far ahead there was a tiny oblong of the same curiously
brownish light that had pervaded the plain above. It grew larger
swiftly, although I was walking at an ordinary pace. I realized
that all this time my footing had been moving, without vibration,
an endless belt spiralling down from that lofty stratcar
hangar.</p>

<p>The rectangle of light ahead became a squared opening at which
the tunnel ended. I was through it, Daster's touch on my elbow
keeping me from falling as I left the conveyor. I half-spun, saw
that I'd emerged from an aperture in a blue-gray wall, lifted my
look and saw that wall towering, windowless, tremendously above
me.</p>

<p>So great was its height that it appeared to lean appallingly
forward, to be about to hurtle down upon me. I whirled away from
it, faced the wide expanse of the bowl floor down on which I had
looked from the brink of the sheer, mile-high cliff that closed
it in. Directly ahead, across a perfectly level stretch of fused
rock, was a low building, blue-gray and windowless like the one
out of which I had just come, but tiny in comparison to it. To my
right and quite a distance farther off, there was another,
somewhat larger, and to one side of it one about a quarter its
size.</p>

<p>If I recalled correctly the layout of Adalon seen from above,
the nearer structure was...</p>

<p>"Mercury," Daster supplied. "Correct. And the farther one is
Earth, with its Moon. Mars is hidden behind Sun. You are the
first of our&mdash;guests&mdash;to perceive that Adalon is
planned to portray the Solar System." He seemed approving, and I
could not help being a little pleased with myself.</p>

<p>"You call the buildings after the planets they represent?" I
noted.</p>

<p>"Yes," the Doctil agreed.</p>

<p>There were a few Plebos about, grotesque caricatures of
humanity with their tremendous heads, their bulbous bodies, their
writhing, tentacular arms. They were moving briskly across the
terrain in various directions, but they weren't walking. They
stood on little wheeled platforms of the same odd metal of which
the stratcars were built, and these were rolling swiftly along
the trackless pavement. I could see no steering wheels or other
means of control; the peculiar vehicles stopped and started and
changed direction almost as if they were endowed with some queer
life of their own.</p>

<p>One, somewhat larger than the others, and unoccupied, came
toward us. It was like a child's playcart, except that it had no
sides, but at the front end there was a boxlike protuberance from
which rods ran to either end of the forward axle. As it neared I
heard a low burr of machinery. It came up to us, wheeled around
and stopped.</p>

<p>"They're worked by remote radio control," I decided,
remembering a demonstration I had seen in New York's Museum of
Science and Industry. "But I can't see the advantage. It must
require an operator for each one and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The rider of each <i>rado</i> is its operator," Daster
interrupted, motioning for me to get on to the thing and doing so
himself. We faced forward on it and it started rolling smoothly
towards Earth. "I summoned this one, for instance, and am
directing it now." It deftly avoided collision with another,
whose Plebo rider lifted his tentacles in salute to Daster.</p>

<p>"Where's your sending set?" I challenged skeptically. I was
getting more used to the Doctil's weird appearance, more aware of
him as an individual with whom I could talk naturally, whom I
could question. "You haven't anything in your hands and certainly
you can't be hiding it anywhere about you."</p>

<p>"My brain is the only sending set I need for the rado."</p>

<p>"Oh now, listen! You don't expect me to believe that, do
you?"</p>

<p>"I do. You have information and intelligence enough to
understand it. Even in your time it was already becoming known
that the processes of the brain and nervous system are
essentially electrical in character. My control of the rado
through what you would call will alone is merely a projection of
the same manifestation of energy by which you wiggle your great
toe."</p>

<p>"I get it," I exclaimed. "Just as radio is a development of
telegraphing over wires. Then...then your means of communication,
my hearing you without your speaking aloud, must be something
similar."</p>

<p>"Precisely. Except that in that case your brain is acting as a
receiving unit. It has not yet evolved sufficiently for it to be
used efficiently as a transmitter, although our researches seem
to indicate that some among those of your time did have that
power in a rudimentary manner."</p>

<p>"There have been some experiments with it," I recalled. "At
Duke University, for instance. They call it telepathy, extra-
sensory perception, and&mdash;" I broke off. We were being
carried past the House of Mercury. Coming around from behind it
and turning towards us was another rado like the one we rode. On
this, beside a Plebo, was a man like myself.</p>

<p>Not quite like myself. He was much taller, built in a heavier
mould. His colossal frame was clothed in a flowing dark robe down
whose front flowed a luxuriant, silver-white beard. His massive
features were swarthy, broadly sculptured, his nose wide-winged
and bent-ridged, his brooding eyes sunken beneath shaggy white
brows. I thought of Rodin's statue of Jehovah in the
Metropolitan. There was about this man the same Semitic cast of
countenance, the same consciousness of majesty, the same quiet
strength.</p>

<p>His rado, shot by us and ran swiftly toward the great building
we'd just quitted, too swiftly for me, startled as I was, to call
to him. "Who is that?" I demanded, twisting to Daster. "Who is
that man?"</p>

<p>"His name is Elijah," was what the Doctil responded. "He was
known as a Prophet of Israel in the age to which he belongs."</p>

<p>"But..." I gasped. "But Elijah was taken up to Heaven in a
chariot of fire."</p>

<p>"So it was reported by Elisha, his disciple, who saw him go.
The sun struck through the whirlwind of desert dust that parted
them and gave it the appearance of flame, and when it was gone,
Elijah too was gone." And then, quite simply, quite convincingly,
Daster the Doctil said, "I saw it. I was there."</p>

<p>Francois Villon! Elijah! A pattern, a faint and appalling
pattern, was forming at the back of my brain. Elijah:</p>

<p>Prophet in Israel. <i>Francois Villon:</i> Thief, Lover and
Poet. I had read those names not very long before. On a yellowed,
crumbling page they had been, part of a list headed, The
Vanished. And on the page before that one, in rubbed italics, had
been words that now took on a heart-squeezing significance:</p>

<p><i>Like so many whispering whorls of dust they went out of
space and out of time, to what Otherwhere no one still among us
knows, and none will ever know.</i> </p>

<p>"None will ever know." But I knew. Very terribly I knew where
Elijah and Villon and I had come. And Evelyn Rand.</p>

<p>This, this Adalon, was that incredible Otherwhere out of space
and out of time!</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11">11. THE SCENT OF DREAMS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The rado rolled up to the grayblue wall of the
building called Earth, stopped. Daster dismounted and I followed,
my mind occupied with trying really to comprehend the conclusion
to which it had come.</p>

<p>There was an opening here like the exit from the gigantic
central structure. The Doctil waited for me to enter this before
him. Inside there was a tunneled passage similar to the one in
the House of the Sun, lit similarly with a twilight glow. But the
floor of this did not move. The corridor went in about five feet,
turned sharply right. It did not rise as that other had but went
straight on. I walked along it too shaken to be fully aware of
what I was doing, too shaken to be curious about my surroundings
or my destination.</p>

<p>Up to the moment when Daster had told me the long-bearded man
in the dark mantle was Elijah, <i>and I had believed</i> him, I
had neither accepted nor rejected the actuality of any of my
strange experiences. Perhaps I can best explain what I mean by an
analogy. Once, on Okinawa, a shell fragment slashed my leg. I sat
on the ground staring at the inch-deep gash in my flesh, at the
blood welling out of it and for minutes had absolutely no emotion
about it at all. I knew it was my leg that was sliced to the
bone. I knew it was my blood pouring out. I knew that it was
beginning to hurt damnably but all of that seemed to concern me
not at all. Then someone had yelled, "Hell. They got the
lieutenant," and visions had smashed into my brain of that leg
having been chewed up so badly that it would have to come off, of
my going around on crutches all the rest of my life.</p>

<p>A medic had put a tourniquet on me in a hurry, that time, and
penicillin and plasma and the miracle men they call Army surgeons
had made my leg good as new more quickly than I'd had any right
to expect. But this thing I was up against now was different.
Nobody was going to get me out of this mess. Nobody could. It was
strictly and entirely up to me, myself.</p>

<p>That was a laugh! These people in whose power I was, these
Adalonians, had demonstrated themselves to be masters of forces I
could not even begin to conceive. The Adalonians could read my
thoughts at will, could sense them almost before I was aware of
them myself. Against them I was far more at a disadvantage than
the most benighted Australian aborigine had been against the
invading white man equipped with all the knowledge and the tools
of civilization. I was finished. Kaput. Done for. It was
fantastic to imagine that I could do anything against them.
Anything at all.</p>

<p>If I behaved myself, did exactly as they told me, maybe they'd
let me live for a while. That was the best I could hope for.</p>

<p>"You have come to a wise decision," I heard behind me. "You
are quite helpless, and your realization of that will save you a
great deal of difficulty." I actually heard someone say that. It
was no echo inside my brain, it was sound, a voice, in my ears! I
twisted around.</p>

<p>It wasn't the Doctil I stared at, my jaw dropping. It was a
man properly proportioned, properly clothed in a brown suit very
much like my own. He was about my height too, but he was older
than I. Gray-haired, high-foreheaded, blinkingly near-sighted, he
had a distinctly professional air. He might just have stepped out
of some university lecture hall.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;?" I spluttered. "Who are you? Where did you come
from?"</p>

<p>He smiled rather vaguely. "I am still Daster," he said in that
thin, old man's voice. "I have merely assumed this appearance
because I have found that my real form disturbs the natural
reactions of the person we are about to join, and it is important
that this should not happen. Now, if you'll step aside so that I
can get to that door..."</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> a door, an honest-to-goodness wooden door
with a knob of black glass, beside me where an instant before
there had been only blank wall.</p>

<p>Daster stepped by me to the door. It is an index to my state
of mind that I found more astonishing than his metamorphosis,
more surprising than the sudden materilization of the door, the
fact that he lifted his hand and knocked on it. The familiar,
sharp rap of knuckles on wood was startling.</p>

<p>Someone inside said, "Come."</p>

<p>I knew that voice, though I'd never heard it before, and my
breath caught in my throat. Daster's blue-veined hand was on the
doorknob. He was turning it. It seemed to me I was watching a
slow-motion film, of a knob turning, of a door swinging open. It
swung outward toward me, so that it blocked my view of what was
behind it. Daster went past its edge, was screened by it.</p>

<p>Very faint in my nostrils was the perfume of arbutus and
crocuses and hyacinths, and the evasive scent of leafbuds, the
fragrance of spring in a countryside I could never hope to see
again. And underlying this was the redolence I could not name,
the very breath of dreams.</p>

<p>"I have brought you someone," I heard Daster say, "whom I know
you will be happy to see." I realized that I was going past the
edge of that door, that I was going into the room on which it had
opened.</p>

<p>She was standing with her white fingers to the soft round of
her breast, her lips half-parted. There was an attitude of
expectancy about the poise of her slim, young body, a look in her
cool gray eyes that seemed to say she had been waiting for me all
the time I had searched for her. She was not beautiful. Even in
that moment I knew that in the ordinary sense of the word she was
not beautiful, her features were too irregular for that, her
mouth too generous. But her hair was a misty amber cloud, and the
throbbing curve of her throat was a lilting line of melody. There
was strength in her small blunt chin and in her face an aching
sweetness.</p>

<p>"John March," Daster's voice said, somewhere to one side.
"And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Evelyn Rand," I put in, deep-throated.</p>

<p>A smile touched her lips, sunshine caressing rose petals. "You
know me, Mr. March? I don't recall our having met."</p>

<p>"We haven't. I have never seen you. But I know you. I am one
of your guardian's junior attorneys and I've been hunting for you
for all of two weeks."</p>

<p>"Two weeks?" Her little frown of puzzlement was intriguing. "I
don't understand. If Mr. Sturdevant wanted to get in touch with
me why didn't he call me up? He knows my number and I was home
'til yesterday morning."</p>

<p>"You were..." I stopped myself. Something queer here.
Something very queer. Daster was watching us. I didn't like the
way he was watching us. His eyes were too glittering, too
feverishly eager. "Of course you were," I said vaguely. "I...I
confused you with another client."</p>

<p>"I shall leave you," the Adalonian interrupted. "I have some
matters to attend to." He was moving toward the door. "I shall
return in a little while." Turning to him, I became aware of the
room, a quietly furnished living room; rugs, furniture, very like
those I was accustomed to all my life. Except for one thing.
There were two other doors, but there was no window. No sign of
one.</p>

<p>The door closed on Daster, and I was alone with Evelyn
Rand.</p>

<p>She'd come close. Her fingers were on the back of my hand,
cold. "Tell me," she breathed. "What did you mean when you said
you have been hunting for me for two weeks?" Her pupils were
widening and the color was draining from her lips.</p>

<p>"I said that I was mistaken, didn't I?" It was clear that she
was bewildered, and afraid. "Another client..."</p>

<p>"You said that, but it isn't true. A veil dropped over your
eyes when you said it." Her hand had closed on mine now, was
clinging to it. I wanted to take her in my arms. I wanted to hold
her tightly, to still the flutter of her pulse in her neck, like
the hurried beat of a frightened bird's heart. "Tell me what kind
of place this is. Tell me who they are, in there." Her free hand
jerked to one of the closed doors. "Tell me what's happened to
me."</p>

<p>All the strength was running out of her, all the courage. She
was on the verge of breaking. The Lord alone knew how long she'd
been holding herself together by sheer will, how long she'd been
facing down her fears. She'd been surrounded by a strangeness she
could not understand and she'd held her terror of it tight within
her. Now I'd come, someone she recognized to be her own kind, and
abruptly the burden had become too great for her.</p>

<p>"Easy," I told her. "Take it easy." The truth would be better
for her, kinder, than any lie that probably would be disproven at
once. But what <i>was</i> the truth? "I don't know very much
about it myself but I know there's nothing to be scared of. We're
both in something of a mess, and we've got to be brave and
sensible and figure out together just what it is and just how to
get out of it."</p>

<p>The idea was to let her know that she had help, but also to
make her feel that she had to take hold of herself and cooperate.
It was like rescuing a drowning person. If you let them go
hysterical on you they'll go down and drag you with them, but if
you get across to them that they've got to do something for
themselves you can get somewhere. It worked. She let go of my
hand, straightened and smiled wanly. "I...I'm all right now." But
there was still dread under the surface of her eyes. "You...are
you a doctor?"</p>

<p>"A doctor? What makes you&mdash;" And then I got it. The poor
kid! "Look here." I took hold of her shoulders. "Look into my
eyes, and listen to me. I'm not a doctor and this is not a
sanitarium and you're not crazy." I said that slowly, with all
the conviction I could put into it. "You're as sane as algebra.
Not only you, but the man who told you he is Francois Villon is
sane, and the man who calls himself Elijah is sane. That is who
they really are, unbelievable as it may seem."</p>

<p>I knew she'd spoken with Villon, and I guessed that she must
have spoken with others out of time. It was quite natural for her
to think them suffering from delusions. From what he had said she
must have seen Daster in his real shape, and been convinced that
she too was the victim of hallucinations. The only reasonable
conclusion would be that this was a madhouse and she an
inmate.</p>

<p>"You believe me," I went on. "You must believe me. Whatever
else is wrong, you are not mad. Do you believe me?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Say it. Say it aloud. 'I know that I am sane. Whatever has
happened, whatever is going to happen, I am sane.'"</p>

<p>"I know that I am sane." Her voice was just above a whisper,
her lips tremulous. "Whatever has happened, whatever is going to
happen, I am sane." But her eyes were more natural now, the fear
was gone from them. "Thank you, John March. Oh, thank you."</p>

<p>"Nothing to thank me for yet. Wait 'til I've gotten us out of
this." I made myself sound brisk, confident. I was very far from
either. About two minutes ago I'd decided that I hadn't the
slightest chance of extricating myself from the predicament in
which I'd found myself, had resigned myself to take whatever the
Adalonians wanted to hand me. Nothing had changed since then.
"That sofa looks comfortable." Nothing except that now I had
Evelyn Rand to look out for. "Let's sit down and talk things
over."</p>

<p>I put my hands in my trouser pockets and strolled over to the
couch I'd indicated, giving a good imitation of nonchalance. Some
coins jingled in the right-hand pocket, in the left I felt a
wallet and a latch-key in its little leather case. Evelyn Rand
was coming along beside me, her pale blue dress whispering
against the thighs of those long, free-swinging legs of hers.</p>

<p>We might have been any boy and gal about to spend a pleasant
evening in a New York living room. Except that there was no
window in this living room, and that not far beyond its walls a
man named Francois Villon was suffering some unimaginable
fate.</p>

<p>No. The Twentieth Century couple we most resembled was a
Jewish one in some Berlin parlor, pretending that all was right
with the world while all the time they were aware of horror
outside, and the inevitable closing in of doom upon them. I knew
this was only a brief respite, a short moment of truce our
captors were according us for some inscrutable reason of their
own.</p>

<p>I kept my face averted from Evelyn 'til I was certain I had
gained control of it, 'til I was certain she could not read from
it the dread and the despair that were in my thoughts. If I had
known then what there was to dread, what there was to despair of,
I should not have been able to conceal those emotions from
her.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12">12. "WALK INTO MY PARLOR"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"Suppose we begin," I said, when Evelyn Rand and
I were seated, "with your story. You started out to go to church.
You went around the corner&mdash;and then?"</p>

<p>"And then I had a curious feeling that I was about to meet
someone who'd been waiting for me a long time." Just the tip of a
tiny ear showed from beneath the honeycolored cap of her hair.
"The street was full of people with Sunday shining in their eyes,
but it wasn't any of them. It was someone else. I'd had that same
feeling, dreamlike but altogether actual, once before."</p>

<p>"In Faith Corbett's garden in Westchester," I murmured, "the
day before you went away to college."</p>

<p>"Yes." She didn't seem at all surprised that I knew. "That
time I was sure Johnny, the boy I'd pretended to play with all
the lonely years 'til he'd become very real and very dear, was
about to meet me at the gate&mdash;Oh!" She broke off. "Your name
is John, isn't it? And you've got reddish brown hair and eyes
too, like my Johnny, and a cleft in your chin."</p>

<p>"Wait," I cut in, a cold breath blowing on the base of my
skull. "Wait. Let's not talk about me. Let's go back to
Sunday."</p>

<p>"I was excited, though I kept telling myself I was being very
silly." Her gaze stayed on my face, and her eyes were luminous.
"Halfway down the block I stopped, because there was a strange
little man in front of me, bowing to me with old fashioned
courtesy.</p>

<p>"'You are Evelyn Rand,' he said, in a whispery sort of far-
away voice. He'd popped up so suddenly, right there. He was so
queer-looking too, bald, with a round face and tight, yellowish
skin and a head a little too large for him."</p>

<p>"Achronos Astaris!" I exclaimed, under my breath.</p>

<p>"What? What did you say?"</p>

<p>"I've met your little man." And how! "But go on."</p>

<p>"I admitted my name. I was a bit nervous, but I wasn't afraid.
Not yet. There was something about him I didn't like, but nothing
could happen to me there in the heart of New York, with crowds
all around. 'And you are--?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'A friend of Faith Corbett's,' he told me. 'Your old
nurse&mdash;I've come from her for you.'</p>

<p>"'Faith's ill,' I cried. 'She's dying!'</p>

<p>"The little man shook his head. 'No. Not dying. But if you'll
be good enough to come with me. It will not take long.' He put
his hand on my elbow, as if to urge me, and a strange thing
happened. The buildings, the street, everything, melted into
grayness, everything but the little man's eyes. Those eyes got
larger and larger. I seemed to plunge into them. The grayness
seemed to be rushing by me at a perfectly awful speed, and it was
empty, most dreadfully empty. And then&mdash;and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped, her pupils widening again, the faint rose that
had spread under her skin when she'd spoken of my resemblance to
her imaginary Johnny fading to a transparent pallor.</p>

<p>"Steady, Evelyn," I said softly. "Steady." My hand slid along
'til it reached hers. "Look. You don't have to go on. I can guess
the rest."</p>

<p>"But I want to, John. I want to tell you."</p>

<p>I'm no Galahad. I'd held hands with girls before, and done
plenty more than hold hands. But there was something about the
feel of hers, something about the way her icy fingers took hold
of mine, quite simply, quite naturally. "Go ahead." I couldn't
trust myself to say any more, just then.</p>

<p>"The grayness got solid. I was standing among a lot of queer
rocks. Beside me there was something out of a nightmare, a Thing
with a tremendous head, and awful eyes, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Skip the rest. I've seen them."</p>

<p>"You have! Then it was real!"</p>

<p>"It's real enough," I answered dryly. "Too real to suit me.
What happened next?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I must have fainted. The next thing I knew I
was in this room, lying on this sofa, and the gentleman who
brought you here was telling me that I was all right, that I must
not be frightened. But I was. I was terrified, though I couldn't
seem to do anything but lie here and stare at him. Mr. Daster
kept on talking, low-voiced and very soothingly. I...it's funny,
John...but I can't remember what he said. I can remember only
that little by little my heart stopped pounding, and the iron
band that seemed to be squeezing my brain was gone and I&mdash;I
think I fell asleep."</p>

<p>They had been kinder to her than to me, I thought. Thank God
for that.</p>

<p>"I woke up," Evelyn went on, "with the feeling that someone
was in the room. Someone was, a girlish looking little boy about
nine or ten years old, with the saddest eyes I've ever seen. He
smiled shyly at me and spoke in beautiful French, apologizing for
his intrusion. I asked him who he was, and, John, he said he was
Citizen Louis Charles, <i>cidevant</i> Louis Bourbon, heir to the
throne of France."</p>

<p>"The Lost Dauphin," I exclaimed. "It checks. By all that's
holy, it checks. He was on the list too."</p>

<p>"What checks?" she demanded. "What list are you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. I'll tell you about it later." I had a pretty
clear idea of what happened next, from what I'd seen and what I'd
gathered from her manner. "When the boy said that, you were sure
he was mad. Then you met the others he spoke of and each one told
you he was someone else who couldn't possibly be alive, and you
were sure that you'd lost your mind and were in an asylum with a
lot of other lunatics." I wanted to get her past that part.
"Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she breathed. "What else could I think?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not the truth, the utterly incredible truth." The
jittery look was in her eyes again. I'd learn the rest of what I
needed to know later. "Look here, young lady, you've been talking
long enough, it's about time you gave another fellow a chance.
One thing though. You haven't been harmed, have you, or annoyed
in any way?"</p>

<p>"No. But the time has been so long, so awfully long. I never
knew a day and a night and half of another day could seem like
eternity."</p>

<p>A day and a night. I checked myself. It was two weeks since
she'd vanished. "Is that how long it is since you came here?" Did
time run differently here? If it did that was proof, indubitable
proof, that this was not some hidden-away place on Earth, as I
still half-hoped. "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>She shrugged. "I'm not sure of anything. But I've only slept
once, in the bedroom in there," she nodded at the door opposite
to that to which she had pointed before. "And I've only eaten
four meals. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>Here was something else that I'd have to break to her
carefully. "Because that fits in, too, to my idea of what this is
all about. Listen to me, Evelyn. We're involved in something very
strange, something almost uncanny. It's quite unbelievable, but
we've got to believe it, because it's true. And because the only
way we can get out of the predicament we're in is to understand
it thoroughly. What's more, we've got to keep remembering,
always, that we can and will find a way out, no matter who or
what opposes us, no matter how impossible it seems."</p>

<p>I was talking for my own benefit as well as hers. I needed the
confidence I was preaching.</p>

<p>"I understand." Her grave, gray look was fixed on my face and
I read utter trust there. "You'll find a way out, I know you
will." I didn't deserve that. I was just a confused, bewildered
guy up against something too big for him. And I was altogether a
stranger to her.</p>

<p>Or was I? There was that imaginary playmate of hers, who had
my name, my features. There was the way she had become a very
real, very intimate person to me long before I'd seen her, a
person so real that I loved her before I set eyes on her. "Now
that we're together at last, Johnny," she said, "I'm not afraid
any longer. I'm not afraid of anything at all."</p>

<p>I couldn't let her down after that. Now could I? "Thanks,
Eve," was all that I said, but she got what I meant. "Now let me
tell you my experience." I let her have it, lock, stock and
barrel, the essentials of everything I'd been through from the
time Astaris had shown up in the Art Gallery to when Daster had
brought us together. Of <i>almost</i> everything. For no good
reason I left out mention of the carved black stone I'd found in
her nursery, the gem whose replica was so paradoxically painted
into her portrait. Because it was so nerve-shaking I omitted the
incident of the ambush on the entrance plain and the fate of the
two who had attacked Kass. And I left out Villon's cryptic
speculation about the implication of the arrangement of the
buildings in Adalon for another very good reason, a reason that
was sending ripples chasing up and down my spine at the same time
as it tightened my throat with helpless anger.</p>

<p>We were being spied on.</p>

<p>As we talked I had gradually become aware of this, I don't
know how or why. We were alone in that room. The doors,
keyholeless, were shut. There was no sign of a crack or peephole
in the walls and nothing hung on them that might conceal one. I
had heard nothing out of the way.</p>

<p>Perhaps I had become sensitized, vaguely, to the waves of
nervous force of which Daster had spoken. Whatever it was, I was
conscious, as distinctly as one is conscious of a stare on the
back of one's neck, that our every word, our every thought, our
every emotion, was being observed and noted.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13">13. THE LOTTERY OF DOOM</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">There was nothing I could do about it. There was
no point in alarming the girl by telling her about it, no point
in undoing what I had accomplished in setting her at her ease.
Moreover, there might be some advantage in concealing from the
Adalonians my awareness of what they were up to. And so I went on
as I had intended.</p>

<p>"It all adds up to something like this, Evelyn. In some quite
incomprehensible way, we have been carried off to a region that
isn't on Earth at all, that in all likelihood isn't anywhere in
the Solar System. Tentatively, at least, we've got to assume that
what's been hinted to me is true, that those who have done this,
the people I've been calling the Adalonians for lack of a better
name, come from Earth too, but from an Earth far, far older than
that which we know. Whether this is so or not, they have a
knowledge and powers far greater than we can conceive.</p>

<p>"One of these powers seems to be that of ranging backward and
forward in time at will, for not only we, but other individuals
from a number of far separated periods in Earth's history, have
been gathered here by them. How they do this I can't even begin
to think, but there is no question that they have done it, and
done it with a definite purpose. That purpose seems to be the
acquisition of some information from us, some knowledge that,
omniscient as they seem, they lack."</p>

<p>"If you're right about them, what could we possibly know that
they don't?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "Don't ask me that. But you must remember
that the knowledge of a race is not always cumulative. Mankind
forgets, just as every man forgets. Haven't we often run across
hints that the ancients had skills, arts, of which all trace has
been lost? To take a simple thing, the secret of Michaelangelo's
pigments has been lost."</p>

<p>"And no one knows how Stradivarius got that wonderful tone in
his violins," Evelyn put in.</p>

<p>"Exactly. But I have a notion that what the Adalonians, want
from us is something we don't know ourselves that we know." I was
thinking of the questions that Astaris and Kass had put to me.
"And even finding out what it is isn't quite as important as
discovering why they need the information they're after, why they
are so eager to get it. I don't think it's merely scientific
curiosity, they're going to too much trouble for that."</p>

<p>The uneasy sense of being watched, listened to, persisted. It
was a creepy feeling, that of an unseen Presence hovering over
us, of privacy invaded and of being helpless to avoid it. A
damned uncomfortable feeling.</p>

<p>"Why is it important, Johnny?" Evelyn asked. "How would it
help us to know all this?"</p>

<p>Her inquiry seemed to crystallize something that all this time
had been at the back of my mind. "Because, Eve, if we know what
they want and why they want it, we may be able to trade it for
our release. We can't fight them, but I have an idea that we can
dicker with them."</p>

<p>I didn't say that for her. I said it for him, for whomever it
was that was listening. And I waited for some indication that he
had heard, for some sign that my offer was accepted. As if she
sensed what I was about Evelyn waited too, her damask lips a
little parted, her fingers tightening on my hand, tightening and
trembling almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>No hint came that I'd been heard, no slightest hint that what
I'd said had made any impression on the eavesdropper. I was a
fool to have hoped it. The Adalonians were too certain of their
powers, too completely certain. They would squeeze us dry of what
they wanted from us, and then toss us away like so much pulped
orange. Toss us to the Drina.</p>

<p>"What is it, Johnny?" Evelyn exclaimed. "What's scared
you?"</p>

<p>"Scared me?"</p>

<p>"Your face went white all of a sudden, your lips gray." Small
wonder they had, with the vision flashing across my mind, of her
graceful form swallowed within a gray-purple loathesome mass, of
her lovely body blurring, melting away...</p>

<p>"White?" I laughed. "No wonder I'm white. I'm so hungry I'm
carnivorous now, and in about a half an hour more I'll turn
cannibalistic. If you don't look out I'm likely to be lunching on
you."</p>

<p>Her laugh, responding to mine, was a silvery tinkle. "I'm
afraid I wouldn't afford you much nourishment, I'm all skin and
bones." She broke off. "Remember when I said that last, Johnny?
We were playing we were shipwrecked and we were arguing which one
of us should eat the other. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>The queer thing was that I seemed to. Very, very dimly, as if
it were something I'd dreamed. But all kids play shipwreck
sometime or other. "How did it come out?" I asked. "Who ate
whom?"</p>

<p>"You ate me, of course. I meant you to, all the time."</p>

<p>"That must have been a pretty swell meal. But all kidding
aside, is there any prospect of being fed around here?" Get a
grip on yourself, chump, I was saying to myself. Keep your eye on
the ball. "Or am I doomed to slow starvation?" Part of me was
aching to take her in my arms, and never let her go. And another
part of me was telling me that was just what I must not do. "A
tenderloin about four inches thick, with the blood oozing out
from under a blanket of mushrooms and onions, would just about
put the roses you seem to miss so much back in my pallid cheeks."
I sucked said cheeks in and pressed my hands to my middle,
groaning.</p>

<p>This clowning brought that musical laugh from her again. Which
was my intention. "It's quite likely your life may be saved," she
said, "very shortly." She glanced at her wrist, at a tiny dial,
no bigger than a fingernail, cased in crystal and clinging there
by grace of a bracelet braided from platinum strands. "It's
almost noon!" She rose from the couch, "Come on. We'll go
see."</p>

<p>As I got to my feet, I was thinking: Almost noon! But it was
almost noon when I started for Brooklyn, and that was hours ago.
"Are you sure that's the right time, Eve?" I asked aloud. "Hasn't
your watch stopped?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I wound it this morning and it was going
then." She was walking toward one of the doors and I was
following her.</p>

<p>"How many times have you wound it since you left for church,"
I asked softly.</p>

<p>"Only that once, Johnny. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh nothing. I thought anything as small as that would have to
be wound every couple of hours or so." Nothing?</p>

<p>It was the indisputable proof that we were somewhere else than
on Earth. Evelyn might have been deceived as to elapsed time,
that faint of hers might have been a coma lasting for days, but
the little mechanism on her wrist could not be deceived. Measured
by Earth time she had started for church more than two weeks ago,
but she'd only had to wind her watch once since then, and it had
not stopped. Time ran differently here, there could be no
question of that, and the rest followed inevitably.</p>

<p>Evelyn opened the door and a strange polyglot of voices came
through to me. The room we entered was large, high-ceilinged. It
was as windowless as the one from which we came. But that one had
been empty save for the two of us. A dozen or so men were in
here.</p>

<p>And such men! The one I first set my eyes on was olive-
skinned, his face angular. He wore a short-skirted robe
diagonally striped in vivid coloring, and leather sandals whose
thongs were crisscrossed about his muscular legs. His mop of
black, kinky hair came down on either side of his head almost to
the jaws and it was square cut. He might have stepped down from a
mural in the Egyptian Room of the Museum.</p>

<p>He was conversing, more by signs than words, with a blonde
giant dressed in skins, his yellow shock bristling with strange
ornaments of bone. A Briton barbarian from long before the
invasion of the Picts or I missed my guess. Beyond them was a
group whose members were a togaed Roman, an American Indian in
full panoply of quill-embellished buckskin and a fierce eyed
Mongolian jingling with hammered silver accoutrements who might
well have been a lieutenant of Genghis Khan.</p>

<p>To describe all the occupants of that long chamber would be to
make a catalogue of all the races of Man through five thousand
years of history. It would require an etymologist to name all the
languages they spoke. In speech, in customs, in origin, they were
utterly different. But there was one thing they had in common,
one thing I felt at once, in the moment I entered among them.</p>

<p>That thing was betrayed by a tautness of the cords in their
necks, by a continual shifting of their eyes to the door that
from its location I knew opened on the corridor that had brought
me to Evelyn, by a jerkiness of movement that could come only
from almost unendurable tension.</p>

<p>One of the grizzled elevator men in the building that houses
the offices of Sturdevant, Hamlin, Mosby and Garfield was a
Russian aristocrat, an ex-Baron. He'd been captured by the
Bolsheviks during the Revolution, had been imprisoned for some
years, had escaped by some fluke or other. We'd gotten friendly,
and once he'd told me of the jails of the Cheka, of the rooms in
which the prisoners were gathered, each one knowing that sooner
or later he would be called out to be executed, none knowing
when, or if he would be the next, or if he would be the last. All
knowing that doom was certain, and waiting, waiting,
waiting...</p>

<p>They were like that, exactly like that, the men assembled
here, except that their case was worse because they did not know
to what fate they were to be summoned. They knew only that it
would be something less merciful than death.</p>

<p>"There's someone here I want you to meet, Johnny," Evelyn
said. Her hand on my arm, she guided me to a corner where stood
two men and a boy, a little withdrawn from the others, a little
aloof.</p>

<p>The boy was the one she had already described to me; the Lost
Dauphin, son of Marie Antoinette and the ill-fated Louis XVI of
France. His clothing was almost in rags, his toes thrust through
the broken uppers of his shoes and there was a bruise on the side
of his face. The mark of some brutal jailer's blow, I thought,
recalling that History's last certain glimpse of him was in a
prison of the Terror.</p>

<p>One of the men with the Dauphin was a tall and stately Teuton,
square-jawed, black polled. There was something of the military
in his posture, but the long-fingered hand with which he seemed
to be fumbling for a sword hilt was the sensitive hand of a
musician, and his haggard countenance was too eloquent of thought
to be a soldier's. I was afterward to learn that this was John
Orth, Archduke of Tuscany, son of Princess Marguerite of the Two
Sicilies and closest friend of that scion of the Emperor Franz
Josef of Austria who died for love at Mayerling.</p>

<p>It was the last of that trio who interested me most.</p>

<p>He was shorter than his companion, broader of shoulder and
chest. His powerful body was swathed in a cloak of dark purple,
and if the little Dauphin's pose was kingly, this man's was
imperial. His hair, his beard, were blonde and silken, the eyes
that watched me as we approached were the deepest blue I'd ever
seen and keen as the thrust of a rapier. At one instant there was
a sad sweetness about his mouth, almost effeminate, at the next
it firmed and I knew that here was a man to venerate, and to
fear.</p>

<p>He spoke as we came up to the group. "Ali, Maid Evelyn. Thou
hast deprived us of thy sweet company too long." His voice,
though low, was sonorous and it was mellow, and something inside
of me thrilled to it. "And who is this thou bringest with
thee?"</p>

<p>"Someone from my own time and age. John March."</p>

<p>I'll be damned if I didn't have the impulse to go down on one
knee when he turned to look at me. "Johnny," Evelyn said, "This
is King Arthur of Britain."</p>

<p>"John March," he repeated, and lifted his hand. I didn't know
whether to shake or kiss it, that's how bewildered I was. I did
neither.</p>

<p>I did neither because in the next instant Arthur was no longer
paying any attention to me, nor I to him. Because there was
another voice in that room, a rasping, imperative voice. The
voice that all its occupants were waiting for, saying a name.
Saying two names.</p>

<p>"John March. Evelyn Rand. You are wanted."</p>

<p>The lottery of doom had been drawn again, and it was our names
that had been drawn!</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14">14. A DEAL WITH DISASTER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Evelyn stiffened, beside me, her winsome face
drained of all color. "Us," she whispered. "Johnny. They have
come for us."</p>

<p>Across the high-ceilinged chamber the strip of secret
blackness between the portal's edge and its jamb widened with a
fearful slowness...</p>

<p>"Chin up, Eve." My arm went around the girl's slender waist
and I pulled her quivering body against my side. "Head up." My
voice was steady, though how I contrived to keep it so I still do
not comprehend. "There's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at
all." My forehead was wet with a chill sweat.</p>

<p>The togaed Roman backed away from the widening door, his
haughty, patrician features gray with terror. A mustached Tartar
lurched against a wing-helmeted Viking from the Fjords.</p>

<p>"Don't let them take me," Eve moaned. "Don't let
them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that we shall not, Maid Evelyn," King Arthur's deep-
chested tones cut across her plea. "As long as there remains
breath in our body and strength in our arms." He shoved past me
to interpose himself between us and the grotesque beings who now
were entering the now open doorway.</p>

<p>"Nor so long as I have powder and ball with which to defend
you," John Orth added and ranged himself beside Arthur, his hand
fumbling out from within his oddly cut jacket a long-barreled
pistol whose butt was of silver intricately engraved. "Never has
it been said that an Archduke of Tuscany failed to champion the
cause of a maid in distress."</p>

<p>"Nor a Bourbon." The little Dauphin joined the three, somehow
no longer a child as he whisked a stiletto from somewhere among
his rags.</p>

<p>And toward those three from the past there advanced across the
wide space that had cleared between them and the entrance three
men of the dim future, two Plebos and Daster in his true shape.
Arthur's purple cloak fell back from his arm and a sword flashed
out, a great gleaming sword full four feet in length, its blade a
shaft of silver light, its hilt jewelled gold. "Excalibur has not
forgot its skill," he boomed, "nor its master his chivalry."</p>

<p>Written down all this seems mere rhodomontade, then it was
rather splendid. The bald and bulbous skulls of the trio they
defied held all knowledge&mdash;unimaginably transcending the
magic of Merlin, the esoteric powers to which Cagliostro laid
claim. The ogling eyes could read our every thought, our every
intention, almost before we were ourselves aware of them. The
boneless, writhing tentacles could paralyze a man with agony, yet
knowing all this Arthur, and Orth dared to challenge them with a
sword, an ancient pistol and a stiletto.</p>

<p>A curious exaltation pounded in my veins as I stepped forward
beside them, my empty fists clenched. And the Future Men advanced
toward us, slowly, inexorably.</p>

<p>"Stop!" Orth cried. "Stop where you are or I fire." His pistol
pointed at Daster. "Stop, I say."</p>

<p>The Adalonians kept advancing.</p>

<p>Orth's shot slapped my ears and orange-red flame lanced true
to the Doctil's head. Utterly unperturbed, Daster came on,
neither slackening nor hastening his relentless pace. "Missed,"
the Austrian groaned.</p>

<p>"The hell you did!" I jabbed a forefinger at a silvery splash
on the wall directly behind the leader of the Future Men. "Your
bullet went right through him." An eerie prickle scampered my
spine. Though reason told me that this was only one more
manifestation of that same mastery over the vibrations of matter
that had enabled me to pass through a solid wall, no such
scientific rationalization could make the occurrence less
uncanny. "Bullets or steel are no good against them."</p>

<p>Now the Adalonians were within five feet of us and as though
I'd not spoken Arthur's shaft rose, gleaming. "Halt," he roared,
"an ye do not wish to feel the bite of a blade that hath never
known defeat."</p>

<p>It was magnificent; and it was as pathetically ludicrous as
Don Quixote's tilt with a windmill, as Canute bidding the tide
retreat. It was worse than ridiculous, it was killing what faint
hope I had of saving Evelyn from&mdash;"Daster!" Abruptly I was
quite calm, my mind crystal clear. "Listen to me."</p>

<p>The Doctil's ear membranes pulsed and the three paused. I
sensed Daster's question. "What is it, John March, that you wish
to say?"</p>

<p>I pulled in a wheezing breath. Arthur and Orth were warriors
and their weapons were futile against these strange beings who
were our captors. I was a lawyer. My weapons were those of the
weak against the strong; temporizing, compromise, stratagem.</p>

<p>"These men will fight you 'til you destroy them. You don't
want to do that. You want them alive or you would not have
brought them here in the first place."</p>

<p>"Exactly," the Doctil responded. "But they are of no use to us
as they are. They must be taught to submit to our will."</p>

<p>"Taught? How? Read them, Daster, as I know you can. Read them
and ask yourself if there is anything you can do, with all your
powers, that will break their indomitable spirit."</p>

<p>His tremendous eyes moved to Arthur and Orth, and to the
frail, boyish Dauphin. For what seemed an endless time the room
was breathless.</p>

<p>Then: "No," the Adalonian sighed. "Even if we reduce them to
their ultimate atoms they still will defy us." His thought
flicked to the Plebos. He was giving them an order, "Feed them to
the <i>drina</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" I cut in. "Wait, Daster. I can tell you how you may
bend them to your purpose. Will you listen to me?"</p>

<p>"Hold!" he told the Plebos. Then to me, "What do you
propose?"</p>

<p>"What you cannot accomplish by force, you may by reason. Be
frank with us. Tell us what you want of us and why, then offer us
in exchange our release, our return to our own place and time,
unharmed, and we will do our best to give you what you want. You
have nothing to lose. You have to gain that for which you have
gone to the trouble of gathering us here."</p>

<p>I sensed interest in the Doctil, then indecision. "If the rest
of the Kintat agree&mdash;" He sank into the same sort of
listening trance that had enveloped Kass on the brink of the
plateau overhanging Adalon and I knew that he was in
communication with his fellow Doctils, was transmitting my
proposition to them.</p>

<p>"By the Holy Rood!" King Arthur growled, his countenance
darkening. "We mislike this traffic with sorcerers. Merlin hath
placed an enchantment upon Excalibur that rendereth it puissant
against all evil witcheries, and we fainer would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You damn fool," I blurted. "They could wipe you out in the
twinkling of an eye, and you want to fight them. You're a
blathering infant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, knave!" he thundered. "Thou art insolent." His eyes
flashed blue lightnings and his sword rose in a swift, shining
arc. "For less have we slain an hundred caitiffs." The blade
swept down, straight for my skull swerved in the last instant to
avoid Evelyn, who had leaped in front of me, her arms
outspread.</p>

<p>"Arthur Pendragon!" she cried, stamping her foot. "Aren't you
ashamed of yourself? Johnny's just saved your life and you try to
kill him. You&mdash;you ungrateful&mdash;"</p>

<p>He glared at her, his great brows beetling. "This," he
growled, "is not to be borne. We&mdash;" Abruptly his face was
lit by a twinkling smile. "Nay. We cannot be wroth with thee,
fair maid, who hath made endurable these dreary hours of our
imprisonment. For thy sake we shall be merciful. Let this bold
varlet crave our pardon on bended knee and it will be
accorded."</p>

<p>"I'll be blasted if I will," I burst out, hotly. "I'm free,
white and Amer&mdash;"</p>

<p>A soft palm across my lips cut me off. "Johnny," Eve
whispered, her eyes pleading. "Do what he wants. Can't you see
he's nothing but a big baby and has to be humored."</p>

<p>There was, indeed, something of the overgrown kid dressed up
for 'let's pretend' about his purple trappings, something
endearingly childish about the petulant scowl that had replaced
his brief smile.</p>

<p>"Please," Eve begged. "Please, Johnny dear." Her hands tugged
at my lapels and her mouth was moist and seductive. "For me."</p>

<p>"Oh well," I shrugged, and dropped to one knee. "I'm sorry I
called you a fool, King Arthur," I muttered as graciously as I
could manage.</p>

<p>"We grant thee our forgiveness." He held the back of his free
hand to my lips. I might as well, I decided, make a complete ass
of myself, so I kissed it and was rewarded by a grin from the
hulking king and the tingling touch of Evelyn's fingertips on my
cheek. "All the same," I grunted, scrambling to my feet, "you
better cut out any idea of scrapping with these people if you
ever want to see Camelot again."</p>

<p>"Camelot," Arthur sighed. "We misdoubt that we desire very
greatly to return there. All our brave company that used
aforetime to gather about the Table Round is scattered and the
gray winds howl over our desolate land. The banners of our
<i>gentil</i> and <i>parfait</i> knights are mired by fraternal
strife, their shields besmirched with the breaking of their vows
of fealty and fast friendship. All have abandoned us, all the
noble chivalry who served God and us. Only Bedivere is left us,
Sir Bedivere the Faithful."</p>

<p>That massively moulded countenance of his darkened and his
lips twitched with pain. "But yestere'en, sore wounded in the
Last Great Battle in the West, we gave Bedivere our blade
Excalibur to cast back into the lake whence it came, and&mdash;"
he broke off, staring at the storied sword he had named. "But we
still have it! Now how&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"The legends say that a hand appeared out of the Lake and
caught Excalibur from Bedivere, King Arthur." A thrill ran
through me as I recalled the ancient tale. "And the legends say
also that you did not die, which is the truth as we can see. But
the story of your passing that has come down to us tells that
three Queens bore you away from that misted battlefield on a
black-swathed barge, and that I know to be false. Wasn't it in a
whorl of dust that you vanished?"</p>

<p>"A whispering whorl of dust!" His deep blue eyes fastened on
my face, and in them was a starry wonder, and a growing awe.
"Aye. Out of the drab fog it came, out of the dun veil that
shrouded the moans of the wounded, the throat-rattles of the
dying. Out of the battle in which none were victorious it stole,
and made us part of it. Now indeed this is such a matter of
clairvoyance as is worthy of Merlin himself. How know you this,
John March?"</p>

<p>"I know it, and I know many things that are beyond your
understanding, Arthur Pendragon," I pressed my sudden advantage.
"Which ought to convince you that you'd better take my advice, as
you used to take Merlin's. You may be a grand fighter, but when
it comes to using your brain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Johnny!" Eve broke in. "Daster's coming out of his
trance."</p>

<p>The Doctil's great orbs were focussed on me again. He was
about to give me the Kintat's answer to my proposition and I
seemed to empty out, inside; was a cold, shivering shell.</p>

<p>"You will come with me," I heard. "John March and Evelyn
Rand." My heart sank. "And you also, Louis Capet, John Orth, and
Arthur Pendragon."</p>

<p>I had won!</p>

<p>It was not to be long before I learned how hollow a triumph it
was.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15">15. THEY TOO CAN FEAR</a> </h2>

<p class="first">Evelyn stayed close to me as, led by Daster and
shepherded by the two Plebos, we emerged from the strange,
windowless House of Earth. A tightening of her fingers on my
hand, a sharp inhalation, reminded me that this was her first
sight of Adalon.</p>

<p>"The city's built on a rather interesting plan," I remarked,
in an easy, conversational tone, "if you notice." I wanted to get
her thoughts off what lay ahead of us. She was trying hard to be
brave, but her face was dreadfully white and her little chin was
quivering. "Look at that enormous building in the center, these
eight others scattered around." For some reason Daster was not
using rados for us. We were walking across the plaza towards the
domed, enormous House of Sun.</p>

<p>"Scattered is right, Johnny." Eve smiled wanly. "I can't see
what you mean by a plan."</p>

<p>"You can't? Look..." I pointed out how the pattern of the city
was that of the Solar System. The others listened as attentively
as Eve, though to Arthur what I was saying must have seemed the
sheerest doubletalk. "I don't even think that it is by
coincidence that our prison is the building corresponding to
Earth. I think&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Pardonnez, Monsieur Marsh,"</i> the Dauphin interrupted.
<i>"Ditez moi, s'il vous plait, qu'est ce que c'est qui mont, la
bas?"</i> The thin-bodied lad's face was alive with a boyish,
eager interest as he asked me what it was that lifted from the
ground beyond the House of Mercury.</p>

<p>It was a lacy erection of crisscrossed, metallic beams, a
spindling tower some five hundred feet high. "Jove!" I exclaimed.
"They work fast, these Adalonians. There wasn't a sign of that
when I passed here before, and that can't be more than an hour
ago."</p>

<p>"It is not yet completed," Orth put in, in his too precisely
enunciated English. "See there, Herr March, what goes on."</p>

<p>I discerned what he referred to. At the top of the tower, and
at its base, what I had taken at first glance to be excrescences
from its netted surface were machines, their gears turning, their
piston arms shuttling frenetically.</p>

<p>I saw now that from the distant House of Pluto, clear across
the plaza, a conveyor belt brought a stream of silvery girders to
the machine on the ground. It seized them, swallowed them,
disgorged them to another endless belt, changed in shape and
studded with what from here looked very much like rivets.</p>

<p>Now the girders were carried almost vertically up to the
machine at the tower's summit and the tower visibly grew upward
as the machine moved upward with it, building it.</p>

<p>"Where are the workmen?" Eve demanded. "Those machines can't
be simply working all by themselves."</p>

<p>"Oh," I replied airly. "An Adalonian somewhere out of sight is
directing them by remote control."</p>

<p>"No," Daster corrected me. "They were set for their task by a
stencilled pattern inserted into them. They will need no further
supervision until the tower is finished."</p>

<p>"Of course," I made a quick recovery. "Just like our own
jacquard looms for weaving intricately designed rugs and
laces&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was lost on Louis. "How high will it be?" he asked the
Doctil in that beautiful French of his. "When it is
finished?"</p>

<p>"Its apex will be level with the lip of the encircling
precipice."</p>

<p>"Whew!" I whistled. "That's a mile&mdash;five times the height
of the Empire State&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is its purpose," Orth inquired. "And why is it being
built in such haste?"</p>

<p>Daster didn't answer him, not intelligibly, but the Austrian
paled, his black eyes flashing, his hand straying to the sword-
hilt that was not at his waist. "Easy, mister," I said softly,
realizing that he had been rebuffed in no uncertain manner and in
his resentment was on the point of an overt act that might undo
all I had accomplished. "Easy. They've got a right to their
secrets."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the incident held a meaning I would have given a
lot to fathom.</p>

<p>I glanced around the expanse we were crossing, wondering if
there were any other significant changes I had failed to notice.
It seemed to me that there were fewer Plebos than before. Those I
did see, darting about on their rados, paid not the slightest
attention to us but none failed to manifest a keen interest in
the swiftly mounting tower. I had the impression that this
interest was underlaid by some pressing anxiety.</p>

<p>Eve got it too. "There's worry in the air here," she
whispered. "Fear almost. That thing's being built to protect them
against something, and they won't feel safe until it's finished."
As if to confirm her one of the Plebos accompanying us glanced
upward. I caught the beginning of a quick thought-flash between
him and Daster, curtained from me at once.</p>

<p>Up there at the brink of the cliff, a gray-purple shadow was
flattened against the shimmering Veil of Ishlak. I saw it only
momentarily, and then it had oozed away in a fashion that told me
it was a <i>drina.</i></p>

<p>Had it been spying on us? I wasn't sure whether that was my
own speculation or whether I was intercepting some communication
among the Future Men, but somehow I fancied a vast horde of the
formless creatures bursting through the Veil, flowing down the
immense, rocky ramparts, filling the bowl and swallowing every
living being within it. So vivid was the illusion that my nerves
drew taut.</p>

<p>"By our halidom!" King Arthur exclaimed. "So bright a bird we
have never seen!"</p>

<p>It wasn't a bird that leaped from the Sun Dome. It was a
stratcar that zoomed with blurring speed straight for the spot
where the drina had peered down at us, hovered there for a split
second and dived through the Veil. Once more, in that swift leap,
I sensed alarm. The feeling of apprehension in the air of Adalon
seemed to deepen.</p>

<p>Villon's voice came back to me, musing when Kass was ordered
back to the wild and rocky tableland out of which he'd just
conducted us, "Something is not as it should be among them. Dare
we hope...?"</p>

<p>I must blot that line of thought before Daster tuned in on it.
Poor Francois! He was himself undoubtedly beyond hope by this
time. His audacity, that a dozen times had saved him from
hanging, would be futile against the Future Men. His luck had run
out. Decidedly it had run out when Gohret took him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look out, Johnny!" Eve's tug pulled me to a stop. "You almost
walked into the wall."</p>

<p>Daster and the Plebos shooed us now into the corridor in the
House of Sun out of which I had emerged not so long ago. Or was
it the same? The passage we entered went straight into the depths
of the structure. Nowhere was there any sign of the spiral ramp
by which I had descended from the stratcar hangar. The doorway
through which we had entered was the same. It must be the same;
there had been only that single opening on this side of the great
building...</p>

<p>But here, within, was a hall different in direction, in
contour. A little while ago, in the House of Earth, a door had
appeared in a blank wall beside me where an instant before there
had been no door. In that same instant the great-headed,
tentacular Daster had become a near-sighted, professorial
human...</p>

<p>This impermanency of things apparently substantial was the
most disquieting of all the phenomena of Adalon. Villon first,
then Arthur and Orth and the Dauphin, had proved so altogether
human that I had grown to accept, not through logic alone but
with an inner conviction, the fact that our company had been
assembled out of fifteen disparate centuries. Once oriented to
such a telescoping of Time, I could also comprehend that Daster
and the other Adalonians were beings out of a remote Future.</p>

<p>But that flesh and bone, that solid stone, should be subject
to unpredictable flux in shape and appearance still seemed
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>It was, I had come to realize, this very flavor of unreality,
menacing though it might be, that had enabled me to carry on. One
may know utter, stifling terror in a nightmare, but in a
nightmare one never quite despairs. One keeps on fleeing the
inescapable succubus, one keeps on battling the unconquerable
apparitions, because in the depths of one's being one somehow is
still aware that awakening will come in the end.</p>

<p>I knew that this was no dream. I knew that the ghastly dilemma
with which I was confronted would not be solved by a merciful
awakening. And yet, because so much that had happened had the
quality of a nightmare, I did not quite despair.</p>

<p><i>"Mordieu!"</i> King Arthur exclaimed abruptly, halting.
Eve's fingers dug painfully into my arm. I saw little Louis'
narrow face go white. Orth's jaw ridged and my own throat was
dry.</p>

<p>We were, with no gradation, with no warning of any kind, far
within a chamber so vast that it dwarfed us to inconsiderable
midges. Its walls were so immensely distant that they were misty
limits to our sight, its ceiling so far above that it was a
cloudy, indefinable dome. Only the floor beneath was definite,
and this was a level expanse black as space itself. A gleaming,
polished black it was, so that it seemed to have no substance and
we appeared to be suspended in a featureless void, balanced sole
to sole on our own inverted images.</p>

<p>In this gargantuan cavern there were only the five of us.
Daster and the Plebos had vanished!</p>

<p>As a vaulted Gothic Cathedral is imbued with the very essence
of the God to whose worship it has been erected, so was this
unimaginable nave with some awesome Presence. It laid upon us,
upon our hushed and crouching souls, a dark shadow of awed
anticipation that had some fraternity with fear but transcended
fear. It silenced us. It held us motionless. It held us peering
wordlessly into the endless, empty reaches&mdash;</p>

<p>Far off there was movement. <i>Something</i> was coming toward
us!</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16">16. "WHAT DO YOU WANT OF
US?"</a> </h2>

<p class="first">It seemed at first a speck moving jerkily across
that gleaming black expanse. There was no point of reference
against which to measure the speed of its approach but it did
approach, because very gradually it grew larger.</p>

<p>I heard King Arthur's sword slide from its scabbard. I heard
the click of John Orth's pistol as he cocked it. I didn't bother
to remind them how futile their weapons were. My own muscles were
tautening across the back of my shoulders and in my thighs. For
seconds I held my breath. Evelyn's hushed voice was in my ears.
"They're men, Johnny. They're two men like us, not like the
Adalonians."</p>

<p>Her eyesight must have been far keener than mine, because it
wasn't 'til several heartbeats after that, that I made out the
tiny forms. There was infinite weariness about the way they
approached, a desperate fatigue that carried somehow across the
distance between us. Once one of them fell, and it took a long
time for the other to lift him to his feet.</p>

<p>And then, quite suddenly, they were near enough for us to see
who they were.</p>

<p><i>"Villon!"</i> the Dauphin exclaimed. <i>"Et le Prophete
Elijah!"</i> He broke away from us, was scampering toward them,
excited and eager as a ten-year-old boy might be expected to be
and as reckless in his excitement of any precaution.</p>

<p>In the next instant the rest of us were streaming after him,
our feet curiously making no sound on that marble-hard floor.</p>

<p>With a strange swiftness we had reached the two, were crowding
around them. I had eyes for Villon alone. He held himself erect,
but I could see that it was with tremendous effort that he did
so. He was clothed as he had been when I had last seen him, and
there was no wound visible about him, but all his jauntiness was
gone and he was drained, somehow, of his infrangible spirit,
emptied of all his indomitable courage.</p>

<p>"Francois!" I groaned. "What have they done to you? What have
they done to you, man?"</p>

<p>He looked at me out of eyes that were like soot marks thumbed
into hollow sockets. A shadow of his old mocking smile crossed
his scarred lips.</p>

<p>"What have they done to me, my old?" A long shudder ran
through him. "I know not. I know only that though they laid not a
hand on me they have torn from my breast matters I kept secret
from God Himself. I know only that I have babbled to them every
thought I have had since I lay in the warm womb of my mother,
though not a single word crossed my lips. I know only that they
did not learn what they wished, and that I was about to be cast
to the drina when some message came to them and I found myself
here instead, this venerable Jew leading me across midnight's
floor."</p>

<p>"But you must have seen something, heard something."</p>

<p>"Light only, John March. A blaze of white light about me and
within me, and eyes in the light, the terrible eyes of our
captors. Light that possessed me utterly. Eyes that read my very
soul. And I read theirs too and&mdash;" He pulled the back of his
hand across his seamed brow. In his eyes there was such horror as
I hope never to see again in the eyes of any man.</p>

<p>"And what, Francois?" It was inflicting torture on him to ask,
but I had to know.</p>

<p>He stared at me. "What?" His long-fingered hands went out from
his sides, palms toward me, in a baffled gesture. "Why&mdash;I
have forgotten, John." Dismay in his sultry look. "I remember
that it was very terrible, but what it was, I have
forgotten."</p>

<p>"Don't lie to me, Francois," I choked through the tightness in
my throat. "The lives of all of us depend on what you've
learned."</p>

<p>"More, far more than the lives of us seven is in balance," the
poet answered, his countenance that of one who has died and been
reborn with the memory of Hell searing him. "That much I know and
the knowledge is a cloud of terror that invests me. But I swear
to you, by the Crown of Thorns that was pressed on His brow, more
I cannot remember and meseems that is because it is too terrible
to recall."</p>

<p>"May Jehovah scourge them with the whips of His lightnings."
The interruption was in sonorous Hebrew. "May He crush them with
the bolts of His thunders." I understood it though I had not 'til
that moment ever heard the ancient tongue spoken. "May He smite
the sight from their eyes and the light of reason from their
brains. May the plagues He sent upon the Egyptians rot them and
their sons and their sons' sons unto the twentieth
generation."</p>

<p>Intoning this curse, Elijah stood straight and tall and
vibrant with an awful majesty. His gnarled hands were lifted high
above the silver mane of his unkempt hair; his silver browed eyes
were pits filled with a black and blazing fire and the nostrils
of his craggy nose were pinched and quivering.</p>

<p>"May oblivion swallow them," he thundered, "and their names be
a stink and an abomination even unto the end of Eternity. Hear
me, Adonai, my God&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your God," Francois broke in, "old man, your God, Who is ours
also, has forsaken us. Here are only we seven and none else, and
if we are to be saved it is we alone who can save ourselves."</p>

<p>Did I say that his courage had been drained out of him? I was
mistaken.</p>

<p>"But how?" Evelyn's voice was thin with the new terror that
their appearance had brought to her, to all of us. "How can we
save ourselves, Francois?" Her hands were thrown out to him,
appealingly, and they were trembling.</p>

<p>Villon turned lithely to her. He swept to his breast his wide-
brimmed, cone-crowned hat, its bedraggled feather fluttering.
"Nay, Evelyn of the honeyed hair, I must indeed be bemused that I
have not yet observed your presence. I know now that we have
naught to fear, for not even Lucifer could be so evil as to harm
one so fair."</p>

<p>I didn't like that. I didn't like the bold admiration that had
come into his look in spite of what he'd just passed through, in
spite of the threat hovering over us. I didn't like, as far as
that went, the way Eve had turned to him for help, nor the tender
smile that brushed her white lips.</p>

<p>"Please," she murmured. "Please, Francois, answer me. How are
we to save ourselves?"</p>

<p>He shrugged bony shoulders. "That, sweet maiden, is not for
me. You have at your service a prophet of Israel, a king and a
princeling, a duke and a barrister at the law. Apt these are in
the art of arms and in the more subtle skills of tongue and
brain, and surely so brave a company can devise ways to defeat
our enemies. To myself, rhymster that I am, is left the more
difficult task of essaying to enshrine your beauty and glamour in
a ballade of gray eyes. Hmmmm." He laid a finger against the side
of his rascally nose. "Let me see. Let me see..." He winked at me
with the eye that was thus hidden from Evelyn!</p>

<p>That wink said, as clearly as though he had spoken, "Don't
worry, my friend. I'm putting on this act just to calm her down.
She's going to pieces and the only thing that will hold her
together is a bit of skilled love-making."</p>

<p>"You might leave that to me," I thought, but I grinned at the
Gallic effrontery, my heart warming again to the fellow. And then
the grin was wiped from my face and my eyes were widening. The
wall from whose direction Francois and I had come had swirled
forward 'til it loomed starkly over us, black and shining as the
floor, but, because it rose to unguessable heights, indescribably
menacing. High up, a long, arc-roofed niche opened in it, a niche
filled with a golden, luminous vapor.</p>

<p>For an instant of awestruck silence this aureate cloud
billowed in upon itself, vibrant somehow and somehow alive.
Somehow the very essence of life. Then, as we stared at it
gaping-mouthed, it seemed to become more solid, to coalesce and
divide and take on definition. Abruptly there was no longer a
mist in that recess, but in a golden light that etched it sharply
against its Stygian background, five figures gazed down at
us.</p>

<p>Whether by some trick of perspective or in actuality, they
seemed gigantic apparitions high in some ebony sky, godlike
rather than mortal. But they had the bulbous bodies, the
tentacles, the enormous heads, enormous-eyed, of the Future
Men.</p>

<p>I recognized Daster at one end of their rank and Gohret at the
other and so I knew the five to be the Kintat of Adalon. Some
ineluctable, psychic effluvium emanated from them, invisible yet
all but palpable, and there was nothing grotesque about those
misshapen bodies, those tremendous occiputs.</p>

<p>It was we who were grotesque; we with our tiny brain pans, our
clumsy hands, our groping, purblind eyes, dependent on inept
physical senses for our small acquaintance with the world about
us. We were only by courtesy human. They were truly human, and
more than human. They had progressed immeasurably farther beyond
us than we had beyond our furred and hand-footed simian ancestors
who not so long ago roamed chattering in the jungle treetops. Our
only right to existence was that we might be of service to them,
and to be of service to them was high privilege.</p>

<p>I might actually have gone to my knees in genuflection had not
Evelyn's cold fingers, just then, crept into the palm of my
hand.</p>

<p>One does not easily strip oneself of pride in the presence of
one's beloved. That silent appeal of Eve's restored my manhood. I
straightened, the awed humility that had invested me sloughing
off. Gohret's head-membranes pulsed once, at that, and I knew
that by grace of that which lay between Evelyn Rand and myself I
had won the first skirmish of a duel just beginning.</p>

<p>They were my opponents, that they were my masters was yet to
be proved. As though we were about to appear against one another
in the forum of some court, I weighed their qualities. Gohret was
ruthless, coldly cruel, implacable. Daster, at the other
extremity of the line, had a modicum of kindliness, a trace of
benevolence that had impelled him to assume a shape that would
not frighten Evelyn, and to answer my wanderings about the
miracles of Adalon.</p>

<p>The Doctil next to Daster&mdash;Oddly, there was something
familiar about him. Not in appearance, though there were the
indefinable differences about him that made the Adalonians
individuals. It was rather a matter of imponderables&mdash;I knew
who he was. Astaris! The 'little man' who had appeared to me in
the Madison Avenue Art Gallery that was worlds, and eons, distant
from here. The emissary who had plucked me, and Evelyn, out of
our own time and space.</p>

<p>He was the only one of the Five whose brooding gaze was other
than general and unfocussed. He had singled out Eve for his
attention, and there was a peculiar quiver about his tiny
mouth&mdash;</p>

<p><i>"John March!"</i> </p>

<p>The same demanding summons that had sounded in the House of
Earth; it was the voice, not of any one of the Kintat, but of all
five. It pulled me out in front of our little group. Eve clung to
my hand and came with me, but I was scarcely aware of it.</p>

<p>"Yes?" My own voice was a hoarse croak.</p>

<p>"You have offered to yield to us that which we require of you,
in return for your safe release. You have prevailed upon Arthur
Pendragon, John Orth, Louis Capet and Evelyn Rand to accede to
the treaty. We require that Elijah of Israel and Francois Villon
signify their assent to it before we procede."</p>

<p>"Now indeed they are most gracious," I heard Villon mutter,
behind me. "Can it be that they have found prophet and poet more
obdurate than they deemed possible?"</p>

<p>I was reminded of the horror in his eyes, the horror of
something he had learned but could not recall. Were the
Adalonians tricking us into some promise we might have reason to
regret?</p>

<p>"One moment, Doctils," I objected. "My words, as I remember,
were 'Tell us what you want of us, and why. Offer us then our
return to our own place and time, unharmed, and we will do our
best to give you what you want.' That was my proposition, that
was the proposition to which my friends agreed, and it is the one
on which we stand."</p>

<p>"A Daniel," Elijah's murmur approved. "A very Daniel." But it
was not so much this as another pulse at the sides of Gohret's
head, a throb of his membrane that once more seemed to betray
disappointment, that made me glad I'd said it. I was certain now
that we had something with which to trade, something that they
had gone to great lengths in their effort to obtain, and would go
to greater. I would insist on knowing what it was before I would
commit my clients to any irretrievable contract.</p>

<p>"We must know," I repeated, my tone firmer with the greater
assurance this intuition gave me, "what you want of us, and
why."</p>

<p>"What we want of you?" It was like a vast sigh filling all
that enormous vault. Then there were no more words in my brain,
but only an indescribable something beating upon it, swamping
it&mdash;</p>

<p>Who was I to demand anything of those beings so superior to
me? They were all wise, all-powerful. I was presumptions. I must
withdraw&mdash;Fingers were tightening on my hand. Eve's fingers.
Against my shoulder, on the other side, was the pressure of a
comradely shoulder&mdash;Villon's. Behind me there was a rustle
of moving feet, Arthur, Elijah, Orth and the Dauphin were
crowding close.</p>

<p>"Precisely," a voice that was mine, yet somehow unwilled by
me, sounded in my ears. It was not only my voice but the voice of
us seven, of all of us. "Before we can proceed we must know what
you want of us," I said firmly, abject no longer, nor
fearful.</p>

<p>Silence received that demand, a throbbing silence behind whose
veil I sensed that there was communication among the five who
loomed high above us in that aureate niche. And then the voice of
the Kintat was replying.</p>

<p>"Of you, Elijah," I sensed it to say, "we want the secret of
Faith. We want to know what it was that sustained your kith
through centuries of oppression, what it was that moved a certain
Man of your people to pay with His agony for the sins of
generations yet unborn."</p>

<p>"Of you, Francois Villon, we want the secret of Beauty. We
want to know how, with words laid together in a certain order,
with sound vibrations combined in certain simple relations, with
color and with shape, some among our ancestors could recreate in
men born long after they had died their own ecstasy, an ecstasy
whose very nature we do not understand.</p>

<p>"Of you, Arthur Pendragon, we want the secret of Obligation.
We want to know why you inspired a devotion in those you ruled
that transcended all selfish motives. We want to know why, having
the power over your people that this devotion gave you, you yet
used that power for their welfare and their happiness rather than
for your own ends.</p>

<p>"Of you, John Orth, we want the secret of Loyalty. We want to
know why, when your prince and friend had slain himself at
Mayerling and in no manner could reproach you, you yet gave up
all the honors and the luxuries that were yours to carry to some
undivulged destination a casket with which he entrusted you, for
some purpose you never learned. Because of that something you
called loyalty you became a wanderer on the face of the earth.
What is there in you that made it impossible for you to do
otherwise?"</p>

<p>As I have said, the voice we heard was the voice of all the
Kintat, yet, in some way that I did not quite understand, each of
the divisions of this long speech seemed to be the contribution
of a different Doctil. It had been the one in the center, I later
learned he was called Bolar, who had spoken of Faith, Daster of
Beauty, Gohret of Obligation. Favril, between Gohret and Bolar,
had been the one to question Orth concerning Loyalty. Now it was
the turn of Astaris, and his demand was very simply put.</p>

<p>"Of you, John March and Evelyn Rand, we want the secret of
Love."</p>

<p>I heard Eve gasp at that, and felt her press even closer to me
than she had been. My arm already was about her, so that I did
not know whether it was she or I who had brought that about, but
beside us there was a soft chuckle that could come only from
Villon.</p>

<p>It would amuse a Frenchman, that!</p>

<p>In the next instant my attention was back to the voice, and
now it was once more that of the whole Kintat. "We have attained
all knowledge. There is not one smallest Law of the Universe
which we have not mastered. We know the rules that govern the
interaction of Galaxy with Nebula, of proton with neutron and the
interplay of all the vast range of entities between. We know the
Laws that bind all into one organic whole. Nothing in Nature has
any mystery for us, and we have learned that everything in Nature
exists and is governed by rigid, immutable laws. We know
all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know not the Eternal, O Benighted!" Elijah's resonant
tones flung at them. "You know not God, and without you know Him,
you know nothing."</p>

<p>"Precisely, prophet. The laws which govern these five things
we do not yet know: Faith, Beauty, Obligation, Loyalty and Love.
But their nature also we can learn, in the same manner that we
have learned all else, by studying those entities which manifest
them. We have found them neither in the stars nor in the ultimate
atom, but in you we find them and you shall give us their
key."</p>

<p>"When," I responded quietly, "and only when we know <i>why</i>
you are so anxious to find out about them."</p>

<p>"But that speaks of itself, Monsieur Marsh," the Dauphin's
boyish tones broke in. "Is it not that the more understanding a
savant acquires, the greater is his thirst to learn more? These
creatures here have of knowledge all but these small fragments
and it is their nature to not rest 'til they have fitted the
final bits into their picture. There," proudly, "I have solved
for you the problem."</p>

<p>I groaned. With one impetuous splutter of his tongue the
youngster had stultified everything I had been trying to
accomplish. He had supplied the Kintat with a good, a sufficient
reason for their demands&mdash;</p>

<p>"Remember, my old," Villon whispered. "Truth is their
religion. They cannot lie."</p>

<p>"Bless you," I said huskily. And then, "Is that true, Doctils
of the Kintat? Is it merely the desire to fill out the last gaps
in your view of the Universe that inspires you?"</p>

<p>The response was long in coming. But it came at last,
reluctant. "No, John March. We have a definite need for
understanding of Faith, Beauty, Obligation, Loyalty and
Love."</p>

<p>"What is it? What need have you of these secrets?"</p>

<p>Once more that sense of reluctance, of inaudible consultation
among them. Once more the exultant awareness that I had won my
point.</p>

<p>"We shall answer you. But it would take too long to set the
answer forth in words. Therefore you shall learn it without
words."</p>

<p>At that the golden light in the lofty niche above us faded and
utter blackness possessed the wall. Possessed not only the wall
but that whole vast space and us, a blackness that thumbed my
eyes and lay thick against my skin and choked me, so absolute it
was.</p>

<p>It was a blackness of non-being. And yet within it there was a
stir as of infinitely vast masses moving, and the rush of great
winds, and the rumbling thunders of many waters.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," Eve quavered, close to my ear. "Oh, Johnny, I'm
terribly afraid."</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17">17. DESTINY</a> </h2>

<p class="first">A fleck of light flowered in the heart of utter
lightlessness. Then the light was the Sun, and about the shining
orb danced midge-like the spheres of its planets, and the
backdrop for them was the whole vast, gold-speckled panoply of
the heavens.</p>

<p>Now you must remember that we had no scale of distance or
direction by which to measure the tremendous drama now beginning.
To say we viewed it is really incorrect. <i>Experienced</i> is
more nearly the proper term, though this too does not quite
convey the manner by which it became part of our
consciousness.</p>

<p>Perhaps it progressed on a screen before us. Perhaps it moved
wholly within our brains, as a dream does. Perhaps within the
plasma of our component cells ancestral memories were awakened,
and pre-memories (I know no better word) of events yet to be;
events implicit in each cell of ours as they were implicit in the
microscopic protoplasm that first blindly stirred with life
within the primal deep. However it was, we seemed to be of that
which passed in the same manner that humanity itself was of it,
not as individuals but as the race itself.</p>

<p>This is as clear an explanation as I can make. It is as clear
as it was to me and the others when the final terrible
realization burst upon us, and once more we were ourselves. Only
the dreadful thing we had learned was clear then, not how we had
learned it.</p>

<p>At any rate, there was the Sun, and there its wheeling
planets, and we looked upon them as a god might. The next instant
a sea, warm and gray and limitless, heaved sluggishly on a green-
scummed shore and out upon that shore we crawled, a fish that
somehow had gained the ability to breathe.</p>

<p>Hot was the sun, and steamy the air with vapors, and the
great, fronded ferns everlastingly dripped moisture on the oozy
slime they feathered. So like our own native brine was that
climate that we flourished and multiplied.</p>

<p>The land heaved as the sea had heaved. Red-glowing rock split
its covering of lush black mud, here to be cooled by the hot air
that was frigid to its own infernal temperature, there to flow,
moving landscapes of molten fire, into the hissing waters. Many
of us perished, but some survived when at last the land froze in
the shape it was to hold for aeons.</p>

<p>Legless, scaled creatures we were then, but within us there
were mute, inchoate strivings. These gave us blurred sight, and a
sort of hearing, and the power to make small, peeping sounds.
Some of us thrust out limbs, and some of us learned to carry our
progeny within our bodies 'til they were miniature replicas of
ourselves and more fitted to survive in the inimical world.</p>

<p>Now it was cold that threatened our existence, great moving
mountains of solid cold that crept indomitably down upon us,
pinching us between their groaning walls of death, so that only
in a narrow zone was life possible, and there only in a sluggish
and dormant way. The ice retreated, and those of us who were left
reawakened and the changes to our forms resumed, adapting us to
the changes in our habitat. We were furred now, and toothed. Some
of us rose erect, and the shapes of our forelimbs changed so that
we could swing chattering from limb to limb in the tops of the
trees that now cloaked the earth.</p>

<p>We learned that with sticks we could lengthen our reach to
secure things that otherwise we might not. We learned that when
the over-arching foliage failed to shield us from the rains we
could find shelter in the caves. We learned that we could soften
the rocky floors of the caves and fashion many needed things out
of the reeds and out of the mud of the swamps.</p>

<p>In the swamps were monstrous beasts that stalked us for food
as we stalked other beasts smaller than ourselves. When we saw
the fearful creatures looming upon us, terror wrenched sounds
from us and these sounds were always the same. When we heard them
we knew they meant danger, and we would flee. After a while we
would make these sounds intentionally as warning to others of our
kind, even when we who made them were safe.</p>

<p>This worked so well that we set other meanings to other
sounds, and no longer had we to rely on gestures alone to convey
our groping thoughts.</p>

<p>Because of our own hunting, and because of the hunting of the
greater beasts, the small creatures upon which we lived grew
sparse. It became a question of which would survive, the giant
beasts or us; and since we were so puny we seemed to be doomed.
But it dawned on us that though singly we were helpless against
them, if we fought against them in hordes we were often
triumphant.</p>

<p>To help us in our fight against the giant beasts we devised
nets of the vines that everywhere grew luxuriant, and shaped
stones and fastened them to the ends of sticks that they might
the more dexterously be handled. Yet were we still inept and
clumsy in our common endeavours, interfering with one another,
'til we ceded to one of us, the strongest first, afterwards the
wisest, command over us in our raids.</p>

<p>Hunting together we came to dwell together, and it was natural
to obey the chief huntsman in all things. Because he was the
greatest among us, his was the right to first choice of meat, and
the dryest cave, and the most desirable among our females.</p>

<p>Sometimes one among us disputed the right of another to be
chief, and the horde would divide, some cleaving to the one, some
to the other. Then would we tear and rend one another with fang
and with claw, and with our axes and knives of sharpened flint,
'til only one of the parties remained, and the dispute was thus
settled.</p>

<p>Sometimes there would be poor hunting in the land where we
dwelt and it would be decided to find some other land. Sometimes
that other land would be inhabited by some other clan who did not
wish to give it up, and so it was necessary to fight with them
'til they were slain or enslaved. If our own land was most
desirable it was natural that some other tribe should covet it
and attempt to wrest it from us. Thus we learned that any men who
were different in appearance from us, or whose speech-sounds were
not the same as ours, were by these very signs our enemies, to be
destroyed if we were in greater force than they, to be fled from
if they were the more numerous or the more subtle.</p>

<p>There were these enemies to fear, and there were the beasts to
fear, the sabre-toothed tiger, the great snakes of the jungle.
But there were things in the world more greatly to be feared than
these. There was the great maw that nightly swallowed the sun and
that some morning might not disgorge it. There was the recurring
winter-death of the world from which we were never sure it would
awaken. There were invisible beings who rumbled monstrously in
the skies and hurled jagged spears of blue fire down upon us.
There were the unseen wraiths of the dark who made men's limbs
like water, and heated their blood 'til it was liquid flame in
their veins, and stole away their minds.</p>

<p>Luckily there were among us some who could hold converse with
these dread beings, and who could placate them. More powerful
than the chiefs became the medicine men, for they could call upon
the unseen to destroy the chiefs, and the chiefs feared them.</p>

<p>We learned many things. We learned how to make fire, and how
to use it to warm us, and to make more palatable our foods, and
to melt certain stones so that they became at once malleable and
harder so that from them we could fashion for ourselves better
weapons and tools and vessels for cooking and storage. We learned
how to go upon the waters, and to journey far from sight of the
land, and we found other lands and other peoples to conquer. Our
tribes became nations; our chiefly, kings; our medicine men,
priests.</p>

<p>Our ways changed, but one way did not change. If men differed
from us in language or appearance, they were our enemies and it
was our right to take from them that which they possessed and we
desired, though we had to destroy or enslave them.</p>

<p>Our knowledge and our skills grew. We changed the face of the
earth to suit our desires. We harnessed the lightning to our
purpose and laced the continents with roads of stone and of
steel. We builded ourselves magnificent cities. We conquered the
air and projected our sight and our thought into the farthermost
reaches of the heavens. We shifted the atoms at will, making new
and ever new compounds.</p>

<p>We bickered and fought among ourselves as we had when we wore
skins for clothing and prowled the lush jungle. The wealth we had
created we destroyed with a passion and a savagery transcending
that of the jungle-men we once were, as the weapons we now used
transcended our ancient flint-axes.</p>

<p>Where once a war might involve two tribes or two nations and
few hundred square miles of territory, wars now raged over a
continent, a hemisphere, over all the globe. Where once only the
men of a nation battled in set lines behind which there were
hunger and distress but at least no peril to limb and life, now
crashing bombs and deadly gases rained out of the sky and our
women and children, our aged and crippled were engulfed in the
holocaust.</p>

<p>As war after war spawned new and more terrible instruments of
mass murder, in the intervals between wars we would attempt the
formation of some world organization that would put an end to
war. Each such league would be born with the same high hopes,
each would be born with the same cancer; the reluctance of every
nation to yield what was called its 'sovereignty.' Sometimes
indeed, so dreadful were the weapons that the last war had
evolved, it appeared that rather than bring upon the world the
universal destruction they promised, the nations would yield as
much as was required of this 'sovereignty.' But always in the end
the scientists of one nation or another would devise a defence,
or what they thought was a defence, against the latest avatar of
death or perhaps would secretly invent a new and more terrible
one, and the latest League of Peace would die.</p>

<p>Triumph for one side or the other, or exhaustion of both
sides, would end a war, and such was our indomitable spirit that
we would turn back at once to the arts of peace. Science all but
conquered disease and began even to find ways of combatting the
slow deterioration of senility so that our life span grew always
longer.</p>

<p>Through the ravages of war and our other careless dealing with
natural resources, the area of tillable land kept lessening. But
biologists discovered how to grow our vegetable foods with their
roots in liquid plasma of inorganic salts that filled enormous
trays, piled high in gigantic tiered structures.</p>

<p>Domestic animals, too, were bred in factories rather than on
farms. Huge sheds of steel these were, miles long; their one end
alive with the bawling of cattle, the cackling of hens, the
baaing of sheep, the other shaking with the hammer and pound of
the slaughtering and dressing machines; pouring forth the
products of an agriculture that had become a mechanized
industry.</p>

<p><i>These agricoles</i> were built near the cities whose
population they fed; and so, there being no longer need for any
of us to live separated from our fellows, we gathered together in
the cities. These grew infinitely vaster than we could have
conceived in the Twentieth Century; but where there were no
cities the wilderness reclaimed its own, cloaking with tangled
greenery the unpeopled land.</p>

<p>Mile upon mile the cities stretched, great masses of concrete
and steel. Many-levelled they were, covered over against the
elements by monstrous shells, lighted no longer by the Sun, but
by a cold and sourceless artificial light that never lessened and
never brightened.</p>

<p>The cities breathed air held to an even temperature, moistened
to the optimum degree, dustless and germless. Within them were
the teeming warrens where we dwelt; the throbbing, thunderous
factories where we labored; arenas for such sports as our
thinning blood permitted us to partake in; theatres and music
halls. Threading the cities in soaring arabesques were the
street-ways, trafficless because their paving itself moved,
slowly at the outer margins, swifter and more swiftly towards the
center. Always the Ways were crowded, for there was no longer day
or night for us but only the work and rest and sleep periods that
the Aristos decreed.</p>

<p>The Aristos were the brain of our body politic, the Leaders
and Masters of men. Obsolete as the chiefs of the ancient clans
had become kings and presidents, outmoded as the fire-centered
tribal Councils were parliaments and congresses. Forgotten except
by some wild-eyed anachronisms was the quaint idea that the State
exists to serve its people, a contention as fantastic as that a
human body exists to serve the cells of which it is composed.</p>

<p>The State, we had learned, was the be-all and end-all of life,
each citizen subordinate to its weal. Each contributed to the
State the best that he was able, each received from the State a
recompense measured by what he contributed.</p>

<p>Centuries of leadership, of training had endowed the Aristos
with their innate genius for management, their congenital fitness
to govern. They were the incarnation of the State, their decrees
its laws, their will, its will. They regulated our every act, set
our every task, dictated our every thought, ruled all the
minutiae of our lives so that the State might best be served.</p>

<p>It was their due, was it not, that they should be rewarded
with every luxury the civilization they created could produce?
Was it not their right to have first choice of all the best of
life, even though the Plebos were by millions the more
numerous?</p>

<p>The Plebos carried out the behests of the Aristos, serving the
State and grateful that by being of use to the State they earned
the right to live at all. Cast by birth in a grosser mould, they
were fit only to give to the State their labor in time of peace,
their bodies when war flared between the cities.</p>

<p>Not that their labor was long or arduous. For this we had to
thank the Doctors of Learning, the Doctils.</p>

<p>A caste apart were the Doctils. Like the Plebos they were
amenable to the Aristos, but their rewards in luxury of living
were but little, if at all, inferior to those which accrued to
the Masters themselves.</p>

<p>Magnificent were the Doctils' contributions to the State; in
machines that did all the world's work under the unremittent
attendance of the Plebos; in knowledge that probed the Universe
for new ways to exalt the State. They gave us stratcars that
shuttled above earth's atmosphere and brought the farthest
distant of our cities within an hour's journey. They gave us
spaceships that visited Mars and Venus and fetched for us new and
strange elements to make more godlike our life. They fashioned
for us our brave, new world.</p>

<p>It was the Doctils who made the State the efficient mechanism
it had become. Take, for instance, the matter of human
procreation.</p>

<p>By the old, biological process, a full half of the Plebos, the
females, were incapacitated for their usual employment during the
recurring periods of gestation. This was, of course, a direct
loss to the common weal, but the disturbance to the State's
economy did not end with that. Since the only limits to life now
were those set by war, and infrequent accident, there were times
when no additions to our population were required, others when
great numbers of Plebos were badly needed. But, utterly obedient
to the decrees of the Aristos as they were in all else, the
Plebos could not be regimented in their mating habits. This
situation seriously threatened the meticulous balance of work and
workers that had been set up, and posed economic problems not
even the genius of the Aristos could solve.</p>

<p>The scientists changed all that in a single brilliant stroke.
They devised a method by which ova were removed from the human
body, artificially fertilized, and kept in a state of suspended
animation until such time as additions to the population were
required. When the need arose, by various ingenious processes the
maturation of the stored eggs was brought about at twenty times
the previous rate, so that within one year exactly the desired
number of new Plebos at the efficient age were produced. Thus it
became possible to sterilize all male Plebos, and all but the
comparatively small number of females required to supply the
basic ova. Thereafter, by certain treatment of the growing
embryos; only neuter Plebos were matured, except for the few
females, the Matras, required to replace those who for one reason
or another ceased to function.</p>

<p>The Aristos directed that the Doctils apply the process to
their own class as well as to the Plebos, but exempted themselves
from it. Their superior self-discipline, they proclaimed,
rendered it needless as far as they were concerned.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the Doctils argued against this decree,
maintaining that they did not fall behind the Aristos in self-
discipline. But their appeal was denied, and there was nothing
for them but to obey, since all the weapons they had
invented&mdash;the disintegrating rays, the atom bombs, the sonic
vibrators that changed the frequency of nervous impulses 'til
those upon whom they were focused became insane&mdash;were
entirely in the hands of the Aristos and none knew better than
the scientists how futile opposition to them would be.</p>

<p>So dreadful, indeed, were these weapons, that no City any
longer dared to make war upon another, and we knew peace at last
had come to Earth.</p>

<p>For some centuries we occupied ourselves with the business of
living. To the Plebos it was a dreary business, because they were
cogs in machines that ran smoothly and without vibration and
without purpose, unless that purpose were to provide luxury for
the Aristos.</p>

<p>The Doctils occupied themselves with the pursuit of ultimate
knowledge, and with many curious experiments, such as that of
changing our shape and form in better adaptation to the tasks set
for us. The Aristos were amused by the results of these trials,
and mildly interested in the discoveries the Doctils made as they
probed even farther into the infinite and infinitesimal, but
mostly they were engrossed in their own sybaritic pleasures,
pleasures neither Doctils nor Plebos any longer could
comprehend.</p>

<p>How could the sexless understand dalliance between male and
female? How could those whose very bodies had been changed so
that they were fit only for their assigned function in the
economy of the State understand beauty of sound or color or form?
How could those whose every act was meshed into the acts of those
about them in absolute and rigid cooperation understand the joy
of competitive sport?</p>

<p>Somewhere in these centuries the Doctils learned how to
transmute energy into matter, so that no longer was it needful
for our ships to ply space, nor our stratcars to dart across the
skies in trade between the Cities.</p>

<p>This was a consummation welcomed by us. The people of each
city spoke different languages, differed from one another in
color, in cephalic formation, in bony structure; hence they were
natural enemies. As long as we had been mutually interdependent
for the unique resources of our contiguous territories, we had
been forced to maintain a certain basis for more or less peaceful
intercourse. Now the need for this was done away with. It took
only a brief conference of the Aristos of the world to decide
upon a complete severance of relations. The City shells were
ordered permanently sealed against entrance or exit and now each
City was a world unto itself, completely self-sufficient.</p>

<p>Man himself at last was completely self-sufficient, wholly
independent of Nature, wholly independent of all but his own
powers. Two million years after the first lunged fish crawled out
of a steamy sea, Mankind had reached its apogee.</p>

<p>"BUT THEY DENY JEHOVAH!" a sonorous voice thundered across the
heavens. "THEY SPURN THE ETERNAL. BEHOLD! THEY HAVE TURNED THEIR
FACES FROM GOD AND HE HAS TURNED HIS FACE FROM THEM AND LACKING
HIS COUNTENANCE THEY MUST PERISH."</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18">18. THE CURTAIN FALLS</a> </h2>

<p class="first"><i>I was vaguely aware that it was Elijah who
had thus broken into the tremendous drama of Man's Destiny. As
vaguely I was aware of the others who shared with me this
experience, but it seemed to me that someone was missing.</i>
</p>

<p>"There is neither nobility nor chivalry among them." Arthur's
voice was something heard half dreaming, half waking. "Their
rulers govern only for themselves without obligation to their
subjects..." It was all dim and unreal but quite clearly there
were six of us, not seven, as Orth's deep accents rumbled,
"Nothing but machines they are and like machines they work only
how and as long as they are ordered. There is not one who is
loyal to his task or to another. Not one..."</p>

<p>Evelyn was phantasmal, but wraithlike as she was there still
was a thrill for me in her bated whisper. "How terrible, Johnny.
How very terrible. There is no love in that world, no one to
love..."</p>

<p>They were shimmering back into the blackness; Elijah, Arthur,
Louis, John Orth. Evelyn was fading as the blackness closed in;
but where was Villon! He had not spoken of the absence of Beauty
from the drear world of Man's future. He was gone from among
us.</p>

<p>Was he only the first to go? Were we to vanish one by one
while those who remained were engrossed in this pageant of Man's
Destiny? The blackness became absolute again.</p>

<p><i>Once more we were part of the colossal drama, of the cosmic
tragedy that moved swiftly&mdash;now and inevitably to its final
curtain.</i> </p>

<p>Man had attained the ultimate. Within the sealed shells of the
Cities we had achieved perfection.</p>

<p>Between the Cities spread a dark and whispering wilderness.
Through the gloomy forest aisles of the Wastelands prowled wild
beasts that had changed but little from those that we had
hunted&mdash;and feared&mdash;in the dim and shadowed past. Out
there the winds still seethed through rustling leaves, streams
still babbled down to an untracked sea, and the sun still shone,
but none of this had any meaning for us.</p>

<p>'Til, in Moska, farthest north of the Cities, the Plebos in
charge of the climate machines noted that these were speeding up
beyond any rate known before in their effort to warm to the
thermostatically predetermined degree the air drawn, through
immense ducts, from outside the shell.</p>

<p>In accordance with regulations, this curious circumstance was
reported to the Aristos of Moska. These ordered their Doctils to
investigate.</p>

<p>The Doctils checked the climate machines and found nothing
wrong with them. Their peculiar performance must be due to an
unprecedented drop in the temperature of the Wasteland air. The
scientists made some adjustments in the machines and requested
permission of the Aristos to break the seals of the City shell,
so that they might determine just what changes were occurring
outside.</p>

<p>This permission the Aristos denied. The Doctils, they argued,
were trying to cover up some mistake of their own, or perhaps
were even involved in some conspiracy against the State. This
accusation they held proven when the scientists took the
unprecedented step of persisting in their plea and dared even to
hint that the Aristos were something less than all-wise. The
matter was settled out of hand by a mass execution of all the
Doctils of Moska. They were, after all, no longer needed since
Man had attained perfection.</p>

<p>The Aristos returned to their pleasures. The Plebos continued
functioning in the rhythmic routine of their labors. Nothing had
changed. Nothing except that the climate machines continued
speeding up.</p>

<p>Then the enclosing shell of Moska commenced to groan under
some inexplicable pressure from without.</p>

<p>For the first time in memory, the Plebos were aware of an
emotion&mdash;that of apprehension. But habit confined them
inexorably to their routine, and it was the Aristos, themselves
breaking the seals, who discovered that Moska was doomed.</p>

<p>Mountains of ice, an endless continent of it, were moving down
from the Pole to swamp the City! It was possible that Doctils
might have devised some means of dissipating the ice or forcing
it back, but there were no longer any Doctils in Moska. As
matters stood, there was no recourse but to abandon the City
before its human occupants were ground to pulp in the ruin of its
soaring structures.</p>

<p>The advance of the glacier, inevitable though it was, was
infinitely slow and the shell was very strong, so there was time
to prepare an orderly evacuation while messengers were dispatched
in hastily reconditioned stratcars to arrange for accommodation
by the Cities of Berl, Par and Lond, Moska's nearest
neighbors.</p>

<p>Meantime, the far southern City of Melbour was commencing to
have difficulties with its own climate machines. These were as
yet, however, not serious enough to be alarming.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of confusion in Moska. The Plebos,
wrenched from their accustomed tasks, were bewildered. The
Aristos, deprived of the guidance of the Doctils, were not at all
certain as to just what should be done, or how. There was,
however, nothing approaching panic until the stratcars returned
with their reports.</p>

<p>These were all three alike. Each crew had had trouble in
penetrating the shells of the Cities to which they had been sent.
When they had succeeded in this and delivered their plea, the
answer in each case had been an immediate and incontinent
refusal.</p>

<p>"Moska's predicament is no concern of ours," the Aristos of
Lond, for example, had replied. "We see no reason to upset the
balanced economy of our State on behalf of strangers."</p>

<p>The consternation with which these reports were received was
followed by boiling wrath, and then a grim determination. "What
they will not give us," was the decision, "we shall take."</p>

<p>A rending crash, the first crack of the shell, emphasized the
need for haste. Before the Great Glacier had advanced another
meter, the sky was darkened with a vast cloud of stratcars and
rocket-ships, crewed with Plebos, captained by Aristos.</p>

<p>The destruction of Moska was earth-shaking thunder in the
north as its fleets swept toward Berl and Par and Lond.</p>

<p>But these were not taken by surprise. They had sent spies on
the trail of the homing Moskvites to verify the truth of their
tales, and these had sounded the warning. Up from the threatened
Cities leaped their own myriad-numbered fleets and the enemies
met fifty miles high over the Wastelands.</p>

<p>An Inferno took possession of the startled silences of the
substratosphere; a hell of lancing, lethal beams, of crepitating
ionic discharges; a cataclysmic Hades of sounds that invaded
men's brains and set them mad.</p>

<p>Across the heavens that prodigious battle raged, and the
heavens were a sheet of flame out of which rained soot that had
been men, and white-glowing embers that moments before had been
proud, space-eating ships and fleet stratcars. The forests
received this dust-hail of destruction, and the heat of the
disrupted atoms set fire to the forests, and the flame above was
matched by the searing spread of flame below.</p>

<p>For a little space the remnants of those mighty fleets still
fought, and that little while was sufficient to complete the
contagion of disaster. While the darting ion-lances of the cosmic
annihilators, the radioactive blasts of the atom bombs, and the
beams of the disintegrators obeyed the laws of ethereal vibration
and sped off into outer space in straight-line tangents from
Terra's globe, the maddening shrills of the sonic vibrators were
conducted to Earth's surface by its atmosphere, were carried to
the Cities not as yet involved in the explosion. High pitched and
fiendish, they penetrated the shells of Madri and of Byzant, of
Ning and Tok and Nyork, and curdled the brains of the Aristos and
Doctils and Plebos that dwelt there.</p>

<p>The madness seized upon all of us who heard those sounds, and
none of us escaped. We were stripped of all that the centuries
had taught us, were left only with what we had learned in the
steamy jungles in whose treetops we had swung chattering, in the
caves where we had shivered with fear of the beasts and hate for
alien men ingrained itself in the germinal genes of our race.
<i>The hordes were on the move! The enemy hordes were swooping
down upon us! If we did not kill them they would kill us.</i></p>

<p>Kill! Kill! KILL! <i>KILL!</i></p>

<p>From Losan and Washton, from Alexan and Buenos and Capetin,
burst our fleets to hurricane across the world, seeking those of
alien speech and alien countenance who because they were
different from us needs must be our enemies.</p>

<p>We found one another in the screaming empyrean, we found those
who sought us as we sought them, and we shattered together with
the crash of our atom bombs and the lightnings of our
disintegrators and the lunatic shriek of our sirens.</p>

<p>Now the skies were a fury of death, and the face of the Earth
was a seething conflagration and the madness that wailed, "kill,
kill, KILL," ringed the spinning sphere where Man had achieved
the ultimate. The ultimate in self-destruction, for nowhere on
that blazing orb, nowhere in the incandescent atmosphere
enveloping it, could life longer exist.</p>

<p>There were no victors in that last war of all, and there were
no vanquished; for when the fires had burned themselves out Earth
was a dead planet, its flesh of soil blasted and torn and
blackened, its bones of rock melted into the tortured, nightmare
skeleton of that which had been the Sun's most favored child.</p>

<p>There could be no life left on such an Earth, but all Earth-
life was not extinct.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19">19. THE WILL TO LIVE AND
KILL</a> </h2>

<p class="first">If, some centuries back, THE Aristos had not
included the Doctils in the Law of Controlled Procreation, the
Story of Mankind would now be ended.</p>

<p>Although they had ventured some feeble protest, the Doctils of
the world had accepted the edict&mdash;except for a certain one
in Moska.</p>

<p>This one, Roya by name, had been perhaps the last human alive
who did not altogether subscribe to the doctrine of the State
Supreme and to the omniscience and omnipotence of the
Masters.</p>

<p>Roya resented the Aristos' act, resented even more his fellow
scientists acquiescence therewith. He became definitely non-
social. Hereafter, he decided, he would share his accomplishments
with no one. He would, moreover, direct his researches toward the
discovery of hitherto unknown natural laws, and new applications
of known laws, that would enable him eventually to gain control
of Moska, and then of the world, for himself.</p>

<p>Benefitting by the pooling of the thought of all the other
Doctils of the City while withholding the bulk of his own
scientific achievements, Roya forged far ahead of the rest of the
fellowship of the Doctils. He learned that beyond the identity of
matter and energy was a more fundamental identity of pure thought
with both, and that this was the true reality. He learned the
nature of Time; that the Past and the Future coexist with the
Present, and he learned how to move pastward along Time's flux,
though he did not quite solve the problem of how to take himself
futureward. He learned how to warp Space at will, so that at will
he could place himself instantaneously at any point in its
infinity.</p>

<p>So many avenues of speculation did his discoveries open up
that even Roya's great brain faltered at the task of exploring
them all. He required aid, but he dared not communicate his
knowledge and his intentions to any man. They would without any
measure of doubt be reported at once to the Aristos, and these
would at once move to purge him. He was not yet quite ready for a
test of his powers, not yet quite sure that single-handed he
could defeat a world.</p>

<p>His dilemma he solved thus: He brought about an accident in
which a score or so of Plebos were killed. When the maturation of
a sufficient number of fertilized ova to replace them was
commenced, Roya managed to be assigned to the task and contrived
to abstract from the storage trays five additional eggs. The
nutrient baths in which these were placed he secretly adjusted so
that they would mature as Doctils possessed of all his own store
of knowledge and with his own non-social psychology.</p>

<p>In a year Roya would have help in his great project, five
Doctils who would not betray him. But Roya did not live quite to
the end of that year. He was one of the scientists purged when
the first premonition of the Glacier brought about the dispute
between them and the Aristos.</p>

<p>The interval between that incident and the departure of the
Moskvite fleets for their attack on their neighboring Cities was
just about sufficient for the five to reach their full growth.
Completely armed with their foster-father's omniscience, they
were at once aware of the implications of what was occurring and
knew instantly what they must do to escape the catastrophe. The
general confusion made it easy for them to seize Moska's largest
spaceship, kill its Aristo officers and get it safely away from
Earth before the sonic vibrators commenced spreading their
contagion of madness. Within our spaceship now were all that
remained of Man: we five newfledged Doctils, our ship's crew of a
hundred Plebos and a single Matra, an egg-bearing female that
Daster had had the inspiration to include in our cargo.</p>

<p>Included in that freight was also a complete assortment of the
various devices our civilization had produced, so that our vessel
was a microcosmic City as self-contained and as self-sufficient
as any of those that now had been blasted into nonexistence. In a
manner that with his inability to travel into the Future Roya
could not have foreseen we who owed our existence to him had
absolute dominion over the destiny of our race.</p>

<p>"It is," Bolar thought to us, "as if this ship were the
germinal cell from which a new and greater civilization will
evolve."</p>

<p>"Aye," sighed Daster. "But where? See. Earth is now a whirling
cinder, heated by the fires of its immolation."</p>

<p>"It will cool," Favril reminded him.</p>

<p>"It will cool," Astaris agreed. "And then the ice will form
again at the Poles, and creep down once more over the blackened
desolation 'til the grinding masses meet at the Equator. A
thousand years, and more, it will be before they once more
retreat. A thousand years&mdash;Do we wish to wait that long
before we rebuild our home?"</p>

<p>Favril had a suggestion. "There are the other planets,
brothers. Mars Perhaps, or Venus&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Neither," Gohret interrupted, "will support life in the form
we know it."</p>

<p>"Then we can change our form of life," Favril argued, "to meet
the conditions on either." But he himself was halfhearted in
advancing the idea, and none thought it necessary to voice the
veto all agreed upon.</p>

<p>Our head-membranes throbbed with an adumbration of despair and
in the brains of more than one of us there was a flicker of
something not quite thought suggesting that it might be best to
flash our ship and all it contained into oblivion. But there is a
Natural Law that compels every entity to cling to the
preservation of its kind.</p>

<p>"I have it!" Daster's thought-waves impacted on our receptors.
"There is no place for us in the Solar System, nor in the Galaxy
of which it is a part. But somewhere among the myriads upon
myriads of planetary bodies with which Space is filled, somewhere
between infinity and infinity, must be another orb upon which the
conditions are enough like Terra's for it to afford us shelter.
Let us find it, brothers!"</p>

<p>"Let us find it!" our minds took up the cry, and at once we
were projecting ourselves through the endless reaches of the
Universe in such a search as even Roya would have been hard put
to it to conceive.</p>

<p>Beyond Pluto, beyond Andromeda, beyond Suns whose light would
have taken a billion years to reach us, we probed the Universe.
Not in actuality. That monumental exploration of ours carried not
one proton of us beyond the walls of our rocketship. It was
mathematical, our hunt for a home for the life that was in our
charge. It was a matter of unreeling countless formulae, of
tracing countless curves, of an infinity of calculations based
upon the infinity of data we had been born possessed of through
the genius of our fosterfather, Roya.</p>

<p>And when it was ended, the result was this: Nowhere in the
Universe was there any orb duplicating exactly the conditions on
Terra. Only one planet, a million galaxies away, would support
life in anything like the form we wished to preserve it. Only
one.</p>

<p>It was Bolar whose calculations lit upon this. We checked,
rechecked, his figures and found them faultless.</p>

<p>"We know where we want to go," Gohret summed it up. "Let us go
there." But we still hesitated, gazing upon devastated Earth,
upon white blazing Sun and its attendant planets wheeling about
it, upon the golden constellations that we were about to leave
forever. Though in point of personal life we were but hours old,
compact within us were the history and the memories of our race;
and these whirling orbs, these spangled skies, were the very warp
and woof of our being.</p>

<p>Something held us, some inchoate and wordless nostalgia
unworthy of creatures of perfect science, of perfect mind, such
as we were.</p>

<p>"Let us go." Gohret the implacable recalled us to our
task.</p>

<p>None of us had actually warped space to translate himself
across it, but we knew how it must be done and we knew that it
must be done just so or irretrievable disaster would overtake us.
The disaster of a timeless, spaceless state of being, of a non-
existence that was yet existence; endless, hopeless, the
incarnation of eternal despair.</p>

<p>Five of us there were, and a hundred Plebos and one Matra, and
we were all that was left of Man. One minutest error in what we
were about to do would end humankind forever.</p>

<p>We set the proper forces at work in the proper manner.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Grayness. Non-being absolute. Non-knowledge. Only a
terrible fear, a terrible certainty, that the error had been made
and we were doomed eternally to this cognizant oblivion.</i> </p>

<p>Our spaceship, the hundred and six of us within it, hung
motionless at the upper limit of a sunless, brown sky such as no
Man had ever viewed. Below was a quarter sphere of the planet we
had traversed the Galaxies to seek and we knew at once that life
was possible upon it, because there <i>was</i> life upon it.</p>

<p>What we could see of the world to which we had come was a
level plain from over whose horizon stalked colonnades of pastel-
hued, immense pillars that converged at its center on a mountain
black and lustreless as the starless wastes between the nebulae.
The wide paths set off by these roofless palisades, close-packed
with the planet's denizens, seemed straight-banked dark rivers
flowing toward the stygian pile that focussed them, and from
those marching myriads a tidal wave of cadenced sound welled up
to us.</p>

<p>A chorus of countless voices, the paean was yet a single,
harmonious whole. There was solemnity to it, and awe, yet there
was to it also joy and an exceeding ecstasy.</p>

<p>We could not read the meaning of that hymn. The meaning was
not thought but an <i>emotion</i> that held those thousands upon
thousands in a single thrall, and Earthman had so long ago
discarded emotion that its very nature was forgotten. But we knew
that it was inspired by the monstrous black mountain&mdash;</p>

<p>It was no mountain, or rather it was a mountain carved into a
stupendous image of a hooded Being neither man nor beast, but
transcending both.</p>

<p>It was not the image itself to which the emotion vocalised by
a world's song was directed, but that which it depicted; not in
form, because the Being had no form, but in representation of Its
attributes. This much, gazing upon it, we could understand, but
what those attributes were we could not comprehend, nor how any
living race could worship them as this one did.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, we were aware that if we held our attention
upon that monument for more than a brief instant, or longer
permitted ourselves to hear the organ tones welling about us, we
should be unable to do that which we had come to do. So at once
we ordered our Plebos to the armament of our ship and they loosed
their bolts upon the singing masses below.</p>

<p>The plain heaved in a vast shattering. The splendid, tall
pillars collapsed upon the worshippers who had marched between
them singing and now screamed their terror at the sudden
destruction that came upon them without warning. No hymn now, but
shrieks, shrilled through the crashing chaos of a world
disrupted, through the rending of rock whose very atoms were
being smashed into their component atoms, through the pealing
thunders of the doom we had hurled upon them.</p>

<p>A cloud of dust rose out of the slaughter, and enveloped the
orb below us. The cloud was luminous with the greens and scarlets
and blinding blues of our armament, and it was black with the
agony it concealed...</p>

<p><i>"Cruel. Oh, cruel."</i> Eve's horrified whisper lay
somewhere within the heart of that terrible spectacle. "They are
not men, they're glorified beasts, Johnny. <i>It can't be that
this is what the years will make of people like you and
me!"</i></p>

<p>Enough of my own personality had shimmered back that I might
have answered her, but I did not. I could only have reminded her
of fiery destruction raining from Twentieth Century skies on
screaming women, and little children, on humans guiltless and
unwarned kneeling at prayer in the cathedrals of their
faith...</p>

<p>It was not our intention to destroy that race entirely, not at
least until we could determine whether they might in some manner
be of use to us and so we ordered our weapons shut off while
still there was some evidence of life below. One disintegrator,
throttled to minimum power, we used to sweep the veiling vapors
out of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The plain was a vast tumulus of rocky shards piled helter-
skelter. The singing thousands were dissipated into their primal
atoms, so that it was as if they had never been, but here and
there gray-purple masses heaved in shocked and aimless
movement.</p>

<p>The monument rose from that desert of desolation, its
configuration altered hardly at all. Its miles-long body was
still haunched as it had been, its great head poised neckless on
gargantuan shoulders as before the holocaust.</p>

<p>Not quite as before. It must be because some fragments had
been riven from it, that it seemed to have moved slightly, so
that the hooded eyes appeared now to be directed towards us,
hanging high above.</p>

<p>There was a sudden coldness within us, a sudden
incomprehensible something that might be fear. And yet we sensed
no anger in that veiled, quiet glance, no menace. Only a waiting,
endlessly patient.</p>

<p>Strange, then, that in our moment of triumph, in the moment
that we had proved ourselves masters of the universe and of all
Life, we should be afflicted by this curious Unease.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch20" name="ch20">20. CHOICE BETWEEN DEATH AND
DEATH</a> </h2>

<p class="first">Our attention returned to those that were left
of the planet's animate inhabitants, was returned to them by a
wave of cold hostility, of hate and malevolence, of determination
to resist us until none of them were left. The wave was thought,
the single thought of the masses below that were writhing back to
awareness, and we could not tolerate it.</p>

<p>That hate would render them useless to us and we could make
use of the drina&mdash;so we were aware now they called
themselves&mdash;as slaves. The problem was easy to solve. We had
not yet used our sonic vibrator. We reduced its power and stepped
up its frequency 'til it emitted a whistle just within the
threshold of audibility, and we unloosed that whistle on the
remnants of the conquered race.</p>

<p>The masses shuddered momentarily, then were still. The drina
were mindless now, whatever intelligence they'd possessed
destroyed. They were ours to control as we controlled the Plebos
we had brought with us, as we controlled the ship whose shell
enclosed us.</p>

<p>We zoomed downward to take possession of our new home.</p>

<p>Our attack upon the planet had blasted its surface into a
wilderness of tumbled rock and had destroyed all evidence of the
<i>drina's</i> civilization, but these circumstances exactly
suited our purpose. We could fashion a city here that would equal
or surpass any that had existed on Earth, and from the ova with
which our Matra would supply us we could people it with exactly
the form of humanity we desired.</p>

<p>We decided to plan carefully and without haste. We would, for
the present, merely construct a temporary abode. Having
recuperated from the tremendous drain on our vitality that all we
had accomplished had entailed, we would design a Super-State.</p>

<p>Pursuant to this decision, we hollowed out for ourselves a
smooth pit as distant from the disturbing black image as we
could. From the molten rock with which our disintegrators thus
furnished us, we moulded a number of structures to temporarily
house ourselves, the freight of our rocketship, the Plebos and
the Matra. For some not very well apprehended reason, we designed
Adalon on the plan of the Solar System we had abandoned
forever.</p>

<p>As matters of reasonable precaution we surrounded the bowl
with a Veil of Ishlak, a wall of force impenetrable unless it is
opened by controls from within, and assigned certain of the
Plebos to roam the lands beyond the Veil, keeping watch on the
drina.</p>

<p>Having thus set matters in order, we rested and refreshed
ourselves for a space, and then called the first council of our
Kintat of Doctils.</p>

<p>"I am aware of a curious feeling of dissatisfaction," Favril
opened the council. "Although when I proposed that We remain
within the confines of our System, I was compelled to acknowledge
that your arguments against it were very cogent, I still feel
that I was not altogether wrong."</p>

<p>"In spite of the fact that Bolar's calculations have proved to
be correct and we find here a temperature and humidity, a
gravity, a range of elements, sufficiently like those of Terra to
make it possible for our form of life to exist, I yet sense in
the very environment some intangible hostility to Mankind that
makes me doubt the success of our experiment."</p>

<p>"What would you have?" Gohret demanded. "A world ready made
for us?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," Daster responded. "We abandoned Earth because it
is a denuded sphere. Have we anything better here? Is not the
same amount of labor required to make this planet tenable as
would have been required had we returned to Terra? And there we
would have been where we belong."</p>

<p>"That is it!" Favril exclaimed. "That is what troubles me. We
do not belong here. We are resented by the very ground, by the
very rocks. We have vanquished its inhabitants, but the planet
itself rejects us. It is because of this, vaguely realized, that
we built Adalon as we did, to comfort us."</p>

<p>Gohret's answer to that was a sneer. "Earth, too, rejected us.
Mait's folly completed the catastrophe that ended Man's life on
Earth, but a natural phenomenon, the advent of a new Glacial Age,
was the spark that initiated the cataclysm. Had Lond and Par and
Berl taken us in, still would the ice have advanced, pinching us
between its walls, 'til we should have been obliterated."</p>

<p>"Not so," Daster objected. "Had we not shut ourselves away
from Nature, had we kept in touch with it, we should have found a
way to avoid disaster. The genius of Man was unconquerable, as
long as Man cooperated with Nature and did not war against
it."</p>

<p>"The mistake was made," Bolar offered, "when the City shells
were sealed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," Favril cut in. "When the Law of Controlled Procreation
was decreed and Man became a designed creation of Man
himself."</p>

<p>"We started to go wrong long before that," Bolar ventured. "I
think it was when the Agricoles were perfected and men abandoned
the good ground for the cities. That was when we definitely
turned our back upon natural evolution and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are all right, and you are all wrong," Astaris said
softly. "All you mention was done because Man had become wholly a
thinking machine, had forgotten certain basic urges not
susceptible to reason but very necessary to his happiness. Only
their names are left to us, their meaningless names. Love.
Loyalty. Obligation. Beauty. And Faith. Faith above all."</p>

<p>"All this is futile," Gohret drowned him out, harshly. "What
is done, is done. Only what is still to be done concerns us. Our
future lies on this planet. We cannot return to the Solar System,
to Earth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, but we can," Astaris answered. "We can go back to Earth,
and to an Earth renewed and vigorous, fully fitted for the Super-
Civilization we intend to erect. We can correct all the errors
our predecessors have made."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By returning not only in Space but in <i>Time</i> to our
native sphere. Here is what I propose. Let us consolidate our
position here, but only temporarily. Let us scout all history for
those among our ancestors in whom the traits I have mentioned
were best developed, bring them here, and probe them for the
secrets of those emotions. Having found them, let us adjust the
nurture of the new race we are founding to include those traits.
This having been done, we can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Select the period of Earth's geological evolution," Gohret
snatched the thesis from him, "when natural conditions were most
favorable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've calculated it," Bolar put in. "The Twentieth
Century&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So long ago!" Favril exclaimed.</p>

<p>"So long ago. That was when the interrelation of Man and
Nature was at its best and that was when Man began to gain that
ascendancy over Nature that eventually led to his undoing. My
figures are irrefutable."</p>

<p>"Very well," Gohret took back the current of thought. "We'll
try Astaris' project. When it is successfully terminated, or we
find it futile, as I think more probable, we shall return to
Earth of the Twentieth Century. We shall take possession of it in
the same manner that we have taken possession of this planet,
destroy or enslave its denizens, repopulate it with the
younglings; we shall create from the ova our Matra bears within
her. With our limitless knowledge, our inheritance of two million
years of evolution, what wonders shall we not bring to pass!
Done, brothers?"</p>

<p>"Done!"</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch21" name="ch21">21. EXPERIMENT IN LOVE</a> </h2>

<p class="first">Blackness blotted out that moment conference of
the Kintat, blackness absolute. Within that blackness I was
rigid, all my bodily warmth gone, unable to think, aware only
that I had heard pronounced the doom of my people, that I had
heard sentence passed on it of destruction, immediate and
terrible.</p>

<p>I no longer was Man in General, living the history of mankind
through the ages. I was John March, lawyer, born June twelfth,
nineteen hundred and twenty into a good, green world I loved. It
was my New York, my America, that these soulless, ruthless beings
intended to seize for their own. It was the boys and girls with
whom I had grown up that they were going to destroy or enslave.
It was the fellows who'd sweated over our studies with me, who'd
chased a pigskin up and down the field beside me. It was the one-
armed newsdealer on the corner, and the people who jostled me in
the subway, it was Pierpont Alton Sturdevant, and Mary, the pert-
nosed telephone girl in the reception room, and the cop who'd
handed me a ticket for speeding, whom they would treat as they
had treated the drina hymning their God!</p>

<p>Evelyn formed out of the blackness, straight and slender as a
naiad, a horror akin to my own graven on her dear face. Arthur
and Orth were real again, straddle-legged, their fists clenched
on their useless weapons. Louis Capet was a shaking, terrified
little boy&mdash;</p>

<p>Elijah's right hand was raised above the shaggy, silver crown
of his great head. His face was upturned to the high, vaulted
roof of the vast nave, and his lips were moving in prayer to the
Jehovah who was not there above him, nor anywhere in this space
or this time. I heard him. I heard the eternal plaint of his
people from his lips, the plaint that was now for me the plaint
of all the people of my world and my time. <i>"My God,"</i> the
sonorous Hebrew rolled from those lips. <i>"My God, why hast thou
forsaken me!"</i></p>

<p>But I could see Francois Villon nowhere.</p>

<p>"John March!" It was the inner voice of the Future Man that
called my name. "John March!" The goldenlighted niche was visible
again in the topless, ebony wall, and within it there was not the
five Doctils of the Kintat, but only one! Achronos Astaris! "We
have told you what we want of you, and we have shown you why. We
have shown you that we had no need to make a bargain with you,
and yet, having made it, we have kept it. Now we call upon you
and your companions to yield to us that which we desire,
promising in exchange to return you to the location in Time and
Space from which we brought you here and now."</p>

<p>Somehow I found my voice. "So that we may be destroyed along
with the rest?"</p>

<p>"Only you and Evelyn Rand are of the Twentieth Century. The
others will live out their span, all memory of their adventure
here blotted from their minds."</p>

<p>"And we two?"</p>

<p>"Will also remember nothing, but will die or be enslaved as
chance may dictate, when we descend upon your world."</p>

<p>My neck corded, so that for a moment my defiant reply was
choked within my throat. In that moment, Eve's hand was on my
arm, her taut voice in my ear.</p>

<p>"Our choice is only between death and death, Johnny, and as
long as we die together I don't care at all. The others have a
real choice. Let them answer."</p>

<p>She was right! I turned to them, my loved one in the circle of
one arm. "It's your chance, my friends," I said, smiling. We were
set apart from them, Eve and I, but we were one, completely and
wholly one, and for that moment nothing else really mattered to
me. I had lost hope and life and a world, but I had gained her.
Everything after that would be anticlimax. "Take it."</p>

<p>Elijah's dark and brooding eyes came down from communion with
the Eternal to fasten on the bizarre creature in the recess. The
Dauphin straightened and was no longer a frightened lad, but the
scion of a king. Arthur was regal in every line of his great
body, his purple robes imperial. Orth was granite-countenanced,
expressionless.</p>

<p>Where was Villon?</p>

<p>"What is your answer?" the Doctil demanded, and there was a
curious impatience in the way he did so. An odd exigency.</p>

<p>It was Louis' high pipe that sounded first, the thin voice of
a little boy. "For myself the answer is&mdash;No!"</p>

<p>"And for me," Orth's deep tones echoed him. "No!"</p>

<p>"The devil and all his fiends take you," King Arthur boomed.
"Rather than live as poltroons, we choose to die as men!"</p>

<p>The Hebrew prophet was the last, statuesque in his white
robes, his hawkbeaked countenance dark as doom. His bearded lips
moved. "Ye have abandoned God. Can I give God back to you?"</p>

<p>They had their faults each of these men, the faults of the
times and the kinds of humans they represented. Elijah, was the
prophet of a creed that could be cruel and relentless, a creed
one of whose dogmas was, "An Eye for an Eye, a Tooth for a
Tooth." Underlying the magnificent pageantry of King Arthur's Age
of Chivalry had been thousands of the disinherited; rags for
their clothing, straw for their beds, bones to gnaw for food and
unremitting, hopeless toil for their way of life. The Dauphin was
the last of a dynasty that had ground and oppressed a nation,
without conscience and without mercy. John Orth had been bred in
an Imperial Court whose intrigue and chicanery and diplomacy of
exploitation was to bring about the first World War and its grim
aftermaths.</p>

<p>But Astaris had offered them life, the living out of their
lives as those lives were meant to be lived, instead of a grisly
death. Neither their world nor their own consciences would know
what they had done, nor reproach them for having done it, yet
they had the courage and the integrity to refuse him.</p>

<p>When I turned back to Astaris I sensed that he shared my
admiration for them. I sensed, too, a certain sadness, a certain
disappointment.</p>

<p>"Consider again," he insisted. "Consider that whether or not
you give us what we ask, we shall nevertheless possess ourselves
of Earth of the Twentieth Century. With or without the knowledge
we seek from you, we shall carry out our plan. You cannot stop
us."</p>

<p>What I said in reply was inane and without meaning and
vainglorious. But I am not sorry I said, "We can try, Astaris. We
can try our damndest."</p>

<p>Our damndest would be little indeed against him and his mates,
who were masters of a knowledge I could not even attempt to
comprehend, but I had to fling that defiance at him and I felt
more of a man for having done so.</p>

<p>"Give us strength, Oh Eternal," I heard Elijah behind me, "to
endure what it is Thy will we shall endure." Then Arthur's voice
was booming, "Have at him brothers. Take him for hostage!" and
the huge, purple-robed form was surging past me, <i>Excalibur</i>
flashing above its flowing blonde locks. Orth pounded beside
Arthur, and beside Orth the boy ran, lithe and pantherlike.</p>

<p>And I had joined them. It might work! If we could make Astaris
our prisoner&mdash;"Down, Orth," I cried, still scheming, lawyer-
like. "Down on your hands and knees to make a spring-board for
us." He went down as I said, at the base of the wall, and Arthur
was leaping from his back for the niche, and had made it. Louis
bounded high, reached the recess. My own feet felt John Orth's
back. My knees bent, straightened, threw me in such a jump as I'd
never yet made, to join the two others.</p>

<p>Arthur's sword-arm was caught helpless in the coils of
Astaris' one tentacle. The other wrapped Louis' waist and held
his kicking, flailing body too far from the Doctil to reach him
with his dagger. Elijah, amazingly here, sprang with me in
between the two, the prophet's gnarled hands clawed, my own
fisted and flailing.</p>

<p>My fists never landed. Something caught my arms, pinned them.
A dark tentacle squeezed my chest, numbing me. Had Astaris
sprouted another? No. A Plebo held Elijah in a similar grip. I
twisted my head and saw that it was a Plebo too who held me.
Others came through the backwall of the niche, wrested away
Arthur's sword, plucked the Dauphin's weapon from his fingers.
Astaris released Arthur and the youngster to Plebos, who held
them helpless.</p>

<p>A scream, shrill and terror-filled, cut through to me.
Evelyn's scream! It gave me strength to drive legs into the
floor, fighting madly to get loose. I staggered my captor,
wrestled him around, but could not get free of him. The crowding,
bulbous forms of the Doctil's bodyguard hid Eve from me. Her
scream had choked off.</p>

<p>I tried to call to her, but a splayed hand was clamped over my
mouth. I could see neither Astaris nor my companions in the
attack on him. Around me were only the Plebos' great, goggling
eyes, their tiny mouths, their pulsing head-membranes. The golden
light was fading. The explosion of super-strength Evelyn's cry
had aroused in me was gone. I slumped, nerveless with fear for
her but emptied of strength and hope.</p>

<p>The crowd of Future Men seemed somehow thinner. I heard
Arthur, below me. "Nay, there is no need to keep tight hold of
me. I have yielded." I heard Evelyn. "Have they hurt you,
Johnny?" All tenderness. "Johnny, have they hurt you?"</p>

<p>And I heard a reply. "No, dear. I'm all right." <i>My
voice.</i> In timbre and accent, my voice. But I had not
spoken!</p>

<p>I lifted my head, my brow wrinkling. The niche was black-dark
now, but the blocking Plebos were gone and there was light enough
out there in the vast vault that I could look out and down to its
floor. The group down there was moving away. Guarded by three
Plebos, I saw Elijah's majestic form, Arthur's. I saw Orth. The
Dauphin. Evelyn.</p>

<p>Someone walked beside Evelyn, his arm thrown protectingly
across her shoulders. Had Villon returned? No. The man was taller
than the poet, more heavily built. He was dressed in a very
modern brown suit. His hair was a reddish brown, and something
about the poise of his head was familiar.</p>

<p>He turned as if to answer some remark of Evelyn's.</p>

<p>I made out very clearly, a semi-circular scar on his left
cheek.</p>

<p>I made out his profile.</p>

<p>It was mine!</p>

<p>It was I who walked beside Evelyn, talked to her. It was I
against whom she shrank, finding courage in the feel of my arm,
strength in my nearness to meet whatever fate the Plebos marched
her off to.</p>

<p>How could I be there, and here too?</p>

<p>"Evelyn!" I shouted. "That's not&mdash;" And checked,
realizing that the Plebo's palm on my lips muffled my cry. I
kicked backward, felt my heel crunch against the pipestem leg of
my captor, lurched forward. Went over the niche edge, thudded on
the floor below. A weight smothered me and something pounded the
side of my head, pounded me down into a sick oblivion.</p>

<p>I lay on the bosom of a shoreless, turgid tide that heaved
beneath me. My throat was parched. My head seemed to have
ballooned to quadruple its normal size. This was the granddaddy
of all hangovers, all right. I couldn't remember where I'd
accumulated it, though I recalled very vividly the nightmare I'd
just been riding, with its weird mess of Future Men and men out
of the past; I recalled something about a terrible doom that
overhung the world. Evelyn Rand had been in the dream, of course.
I'd found her and had fallen in love with her and she with me,
but the dream had wound up with me watching myself walk away from
myself, having stolen my girl from me.</p>

<p>Well, I'd better get up and fix myself a Prairie Oyster and
try to get into shape. Old Persimmon Puss Conklin will give me
the fish eyes if I come strolling into the office late, and the
Head will be sure to hear that I displayed every evidence of
having had a hard night out.</p>

<p>Without trying to unglue my eyelids, I shoved myself up,
groaning. Gingerly balancing on my aching shoulders that grossly
enlarged head of mine, I wiggled a leg sidewise to get it down
off the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>It wouldn't go down. The devil! Was I paralyzed? No liquor
ever hit me this hard before. Wonder who brought me home. Or am I
home? Bed feels awful damned hard. Better get eyes open and look
around.</p>

<p>I went to work on the left one first. It slit, widened. And
then the right flew open, and I was jumping to my feet.</p>

<p>I hadn't been able to get my leg down because it was already
down. The bed was so hard because it was the stone floor of a
small, cell-like chamber whose walls, polished, blue-gray rock,
had neither window nor door, nor opening of any kind. I looked
up. The blue-gray ceiling was solid as the walls.</p>

<p>It was no nightmare I'd been living. It was stark, incredible
reality. I was a prisoner of the Doctils, in the Land where Time
is Not, and Evelyn&mdash;</p>

<p>Was Evelyn already out on the plain, prey to the <i>drina!</i>
Why she and not me? Why had she and the others been taken off,
and I left behind? It was I who'd led the fight against the
Doctils, I who had engaged in an unequal battle of wits with
them. Why should I be spared&mdash;? Wait. Hadn't I seen myself
being marched off with the others, brown suit, scarred
cheek&mdash;</p>

<p>Hold everything! That had not been I out on the black floor.
It couldn't have been. Even the Doctils, with all their million
years advantage over the science I knew, couldn't make two of me,
each complete.</p>

<p>I stood rigid in the center of that cell, trembling a little
as I tried to recall every detail of what had occurred. There had
been our attack on Astaris, the incursion of the Plebos to
frustrate it. Fighting uselessly with the one who'd seized me,
I'd lost sight of my companions, of Astaris. When that futile
fight was over, I'd glimpsed the men of my own time again, and
Evelyn. But&mdash;I was certain of it now&mdash;nowhere had I
seen Astaris.</p>

<p>While that fight was going on, the girl had been hidden from
me by the crowding Plebos. By the same token, I must have been
hidden from her. I still had been hidden from her when it was
over, but she spoke to me.</p>

<p>I could almost hear her now, "Johnny, are you hurt?"</p>

<p>It wasn't of me she had asked that, then, but of my double.
And it was my double who had replied, in a perfect imitation of
my voice. "No, dear. I'm all right." King Arthur had already been
taken down out of the niche, and so probably had the others. I
should have been taken down out of it too, unless there was a
definite reason why I should not.</p>

<p>Was it by accident that the Plebos had crowded around me,
hiding me from my friends? Hiding me from Evelyn? Very little the
Future Men did was accidental.</p>

<p>I recalled how Astaris had projected Evelyn's presence, her
personality, before me in that Brooklyn house. I recalled how, in
a twinkling, Daster had taken on the exact appearance, the
mannerisms, of a professor of my own time.</p>

<p>If I were building up a case in court, I could have
established no better one to confirm the startling hypothesis I
had not yet dared to put into words. Opportunity: A brawling
fight in which I'd been concealed from view. Ability:
Demonstrated.</p>

<p><i>My double was Astaris!</i> Achronos Astaris had assumed my
shape, my voice. He had become me!</p>

<p>Motive? The caress in his tones, his arm tender across Eve's
shoulder, betrayed that. By spying, by threats, by persuasion,
the Doctil had failed to wring from Evelyn and me the secret of
the love that lay between us, but he had not given up. He was
trying another method now. Somewhere, in his wandering through
the ages, he had become aware of the fact that love often begets
love. He knew that Evelyn loved me. By becoming me he would
become the object of her love and perhaps it would arouse that
emotion in him so that he could study it by introspection.</p>

<p>"Damn him!" I cursed aloud. "Oh damn him!" shaken by a white
and blistering rage, a jealous fury that blazed through my veins.
And then I realized that I should be grateful, instead, that the
Doctil had evolved this scheme.</p>

<p>As long as he still thought that it might work, Evelyn was
safe. It was a greater protection for her than any I could give
her.</p>

<p>What protection could I give her, what help could I be to her,
against the Future Men? Physically, I was no match for them.
Mentally, they had outmaneuvered my every attempt to match wits
with them. But there was no shame in that. Not Einstein, not
Michelson or Compton, not all of the outstanding intellects of my
world and my age would make a better showing, pitted against
them.</p>

<p>That might happen too. <i>That would happen.</i> It was only a
matter of time. When they were ready&mdash;</p>

<p>The full and terrible implication of their plans, its promise
of disaster to the civilization out of which I'd been plucked,
swept down on me like a tangible black pall. I had flung defiance
at them, but that defiance had been meaningless as the snarl of a
week-old kitten at a Great Dane.</p>

<p>I stared at the seamless stone wall of my prison, stared at
visions of New York's sky-reaching towers shattering down on
terror-ridden crowds that fled to safety where there was no
safety, of humans shrivelling in the blast of rays seething out
of a menacing sky, of a civilization gone mad with the mad sound
that filled the air, of flame-eyed men killing, killing one
another, their arms, their clawed hands, dripping with gore.</p>

<p>And when the cataclysm was ended, I imagined the pitiful,
mindless remnants of my race enslaved to the creatures of the
Future who claimed to be men&mdash;"John!" A voice penetrated
these appalling mental pictures. "It is you, my old. It is verily
you!"</p>

<p>His velvet doublet more ragged than ever, the lace at his
wrists and his throat more dingy, but with the same jaunty
swagger to his meagre form, the same mocking smile on his thin,
scar-twisted lips, Francois Villon stood beside me!</p>

<p>"Francois!" I gasped. "Where&mdash;how did you get in here?
Where have you been? How&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Softly!" Villon had laid a long finger beside his hawklike
nose. "Softly, my cabbage. If you will permit me to answer one
query before you prod me with another&mdash;I entered this cell
in the same manner you were brought here, through its wall."</p>

<p>"Through&mdash;! Then there's a secret door&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My liver, John, no! They are solid of stone, all four walls,
floor and ceiling. It is through the solid stone I came, as they
do, by help of this." There was, in the hand he held out to me, a
tiny mechanism of what seemed like platinum wiring and glass or
fused quartz. "The Doctils need little beside the power of their
brains to perform their magic, but the Plebos are of lesser
mould. They require this&mdash;key, shall we name it for want of
a better term&mdash;to translate themselves through matter
without door or aperture. It is of a Plebo I had it, the one I
saw carrying you off, when I returned to join you in the Hall of
Miracles. He did not hear me follow him, nor will he miss what I
have taken from him." He touched, delicately, the hilt of his
poniard, and I saw at the throat of its scabbard an edging of
red, sticky wet that had wiped from the blade as it slid into its
tight sheath.</p>

<p>"The poet," Villon smiled slyly, "is also a master thief."</p>

<p>And a Paris apache, I thought, recalling what I had read of
this strangest character in all literature. "Where did they take
Evelyn and the others?" I asked him, trying not to repress a
shudder at the way he could blandly smile, after what he had
done.</p>

<p>"Nay, that I do not know. They were out of sight. Perhaps, if
I had returned a moment sooner&mdash;" he shrugged his bony
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Returned from where? When I saw you were gone I thought they
had taken you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They did not take me. I went of my own accord, and they did
not know it. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They did not know! But they can read our thoughts.
How&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Name of a dog, but you make one imbecile with your questions!
They read our thoughts only when they bend their own upon ours.
To show us the scenes they cast upon the screen of the wall, to
bring us into them as part of them, demanded all of their minds,
to watch them took all the minds of you others. But me, I shut
out from mine that shadow-play and watched the Doctils
themselves, hoping that in an unguarded moment I might see
something that might be of aid to us."</p>

<p>"And you did?"</p>

<p>He shrugged again, and though he still smiled, I thought there
was a shimmer of fear in his eyes. "I saw something, but whether
it gives us hope or is the death of all hope for us, I do not yet
know. A long space of time I saw only five shapes in a high niche
from which the golden light had faded, five monstrous shapes
wholly intent on seizing our senses to make them toys of their
wills. Fighting that intent, I sweated like a whipped coach
horse. Then there was a stir among them. The strain upon me
loosened, and meseemed some distracting word had come to them. I
recall that there was a stir among you others also, as though
their grip upon you had grown less strong."</p>

<p>"We came to ourselves," I interrupted, "for a moment or so. I
wonder if it was then."</p>

<p>"Aye," Villon nodded. "It may well have been, for methought I
heard Elijah cry out something about denying God. But four of the
five Doctils were hastening away, and I did not turn for I was
skulking after them and feared to lose sight of the four in the
dimness."</p>

<p>Four. One had remained behind. It had taken the whole Kintat
to hypnotize us so that we seemed to relive the whole evolution
of civilization and its destruction, but once we were under the
influence, Astaris had been able to hold us alone.</p>

<p>"They went out of that Hall of Midnight," Villon continued,
"and out of the House of Sun. Me, I dared not emerge to the open,
for fear that I might be spied."</p>

<p>"You stopped!" I exclaimed. "You let them get away from
you!"</p>

<p>"Name of the name of a dog, will you let me tell my tale? What
I saw, I saw, and if you have no wish to learn what that was, I
am content to make silent."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Villon," I apologized. "I'll keep still. What did
you see?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, at first, for that a white glare filled the Bowl of
Adalon, and it blinded my eyes that were used to the dimness.
There was a vast hissing in the sky, like a thousand flying
serpents giving vent to their hate of our captors. I peered on
high, striving to make out whence came that monstrous reptilian
sound.</p>

<p>"The white light streamed from the top of the tower we saw
building, that top ablaze as though it had impaled the Sun. The
glare roofed the pit, from rampart to rampart of the cliffs that
form it. It was only stray beams from it that dazzled me below,
up there it was a very white hell of light in which nothing could
live.</p>

<p>"Adown the walls of the bowl dribbled streamlets, gray-purple
and slow, as though at the brink of the cliffs the light from the
tower melted something like fire melts wax. And this indeed was
the case, as I descried when my aching sight became more
accustomed to the glare.</p>

<p>"Circling the verge of the Bowl a dark cloud lay against the
Veil of Ishlak, a heaving cloud that was not a cloud at all but
thousands upon thousands of the weird creatures that people the
plains where we found each other, you and I. The drina. The Veil,
or so it seemed to me, was a little rent here and there, and
where it was rent the gray-purple flesh of the drina oozed
through, striving to rend the Veil still further, and there that
flesh was melting in the white blaze from the tower and running
in slow streamlets down the cliffs."</p>

<p>"I thought the Veil was impenetrable," I could not keep from
again breaking into Villon's narrative, "unless the Future Men
opened it themselves from some control down here."</p>

<p>"So it is," Francois agreed. "The drina masses boiled, behind
each opening in it, about a stratcar, its shining plates torn
apart, its shining form crushed. The Veil had been opened in each
of those places to let a stratcar through, and some of the drina
had blocked its closing again, were writhing through while their
fellows swamped the flying machines that had been sent to hold
them off while the tower was being completed. The drina were
writhing through, and the blaze from the tower, now completed,
was melting them as fast as they oozed through, and still they
came in an implacable dark tide of hate."</p>

<p>"God," I whispered, "they're brave. No human army&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not brave," Villon denied, "but mad. The drina know no fear,
my John, because they are without minds to know fear. They are
animate only with hate and the lust to kill. Now indeed such an
enemy is the worst of all, for only by destruction can they be
defeated, only by complete and utter obliteration. Against
thinking beings like us, against all the armies our world could
muster against them, the Future Men would be invincible. Seeing
that our weapons were powerless against them, seeing that our
defences were powerless against theirs, panic would turn our
blood to water, our strength to weakness, and we would be undone.
But these imbecile monsters that attack them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haven't sense enough to know when they're licked. By all
that's holy, Francois, the Doctils may have beaten themselves." I
was recalling how they'd deliberately destroyed the minds of this
planet's natives, had deliberately made them the idiot things
they were. "But go on. Is that battle still on?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and no. The Veil is whole again, and no drina has
achieved the Bowl. The Plebos, it seems, were able only to obey
instructions. They had been directed to delay the gray-purple
hosts with the stratcars 'til the tower was finished and then to
destroy them with the white light from the tower. This they did,
but when the combat raged too evenly for comfort, they summoned
the Kintat. With the advent of the Doctils a new phase of the
fight set in. I saw a great scurrying about. I saw Plebos swarm
up the tower bearing new devices. And then the light that seethed
from it was no longer white. Crackling streamers of blue and
scarlet and eye-searing yellow flashed overhead, seeking the
rents in the Veil. The flesh of the attackers no longer melted
but whiffed into nothingness. The breaches in the shimmering
barrier were repaired, and the blaze at the tower-top sputtered
out."</p>

<p>The excitement that had made me forget my despair drained out
of me, "Then the Doctils have won. Why did you let me
think&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"They have not altogether conquered, my friend. The Veil of
Ishlak is whole again, and in the Bowl they are safe, but against
the Veil still billows the gray-purple mass of the drina, and
beyond the Veil the Future Men dare not venture. They are
prisoners in Adalon, our captors, 'til they devise some means to
destroy their besiegers."</p>

<p>"We mustn't let them do that." My fingers dug into the poet's
scrawny arm. "We've got to find a way to keep them from doing
that, Villon. We've got to find a way to let the drina get
through the Veil and come down into the Bowl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John!" He pulled back from me, his widened eyes on mine.
"Have you gone mad? Do you not realize that if the drina gain
Adalon we too, all of us, will die with the Plebos and the
Doctils? Those loathsome masses will roll over us, my friend, and
we will be taken up within them, and their acids will rot
us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let them. So long as the Future Men are wiped out, let the
drina wipe us out too. All of us."</p>

<p>"All, John?" Francois' gaze probed my brain. "Even Evelyn,
John?"</p>

<p>An icy shudder ran through me. "Even Evelyn, Francois, if I
cannot kill her with my own hand before that happens. If she were
here, she would tell you the same."</p>

<p>"No," the poet sighed. "There is no madness in your eyes. But
why, then&mdash;?"</p>

<p>I told him. I told him, briefly, what we had seen, and what we
had learned the Kintat planned. "You agree with me, Francois?" I
asked when I had finished. "You agree with me that they must be
wiped out, even if we have to be wiped out with them?"</p>

<p>There was no smile on his lips, and his countenance was gray
under its blue stubble. "Aye, John," he answered. "No matter how
terrible a death it be, our death in the bowels of the drina
would be a cheap price to pay for the destruction of these
demons."</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch22" name="ch22">22. THE DEATH CLOUD</a> </h2>

<p class="first">"Cheap enough," I laughed curtly.</p>

<p>"I'd set the value of our lives right now, at two dozen for a
nickle, and that's too high if we hang around in here much
longer. You say that thing you've got there is a key to this
cell. If it is, let's go. Let's get out of here...What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>Villon was looking at the involved device in his palm, and
something like dismay was in his face.</p>

<p>"It is a key," he said slowly. "And yet it is no key. It
passed me, singly, in through the stone but&mdash;will it take
two of us out?"</p>

<p>"The only way to find out is to try. Look. When we left the
stratcar hangar through its wall, Daster had his hand on my back.
When the plain rushed past us as we came to Adalon, Kass had his
hands on the two of us. Maybe I ought to be touching you while
you try to use that."</p>

<p>"Of a surety you must touch me." Francois' smile was wan.
"Thus, if the magic of this thing avails to carry us into the
stone but not through it, we shall at least be immured with a
comrade near to accompany us into oblivion."</p>

<p><i>That</i> was what he was afraid of. That the power of the
'key' might be enough to get us into the rock, yet not sufficient
to take both of us all the way through it. I admit the thought
was not exactly pleasant.</p>

<p>"Well," I put my arm around his narrow shoulders, "It will be
an interesting experiment." I could feet the shudder that was
running through him. "Come on." I'd hate to be cursed with your
imagination, I thought, aware that he was picturing himself
caught within the rock, entombed there forever...</p>

<p>I have a pretty good imagination too.</p>

<p>"Come on, old man," I urged. "Let's get it over with," and
pressed him toward the wall through which he'd come.</p>

<p>A muscle twitched in his sallow cheek. He lifted his hand,
placed the 'key' against the bluish, perdurable rock. "It was
done thus," he murmured, "as I watched. And then, the Plebo
pressed&mdash;this." His thumb moved.</p>

<p>There was no change in the appearance of the wall. "Damn!" I
muttered. "It doesn't work." I struck the stone with my free
hand&mdash;and my fist went into it! I stepped forward, pressed
Villon with me.</p>

<p>The world blanked out. I felt nothing, saw nothing but
featureless grayness. I seemed to be still moving forward, but
the grayness pressed in on me, held me. I gasped voicelessly.
Then, after one fearful instant, the grayness was gone, and I was
in a dim corridor and Francois was beside me. The floor of the
hall pitched steeply down, curving to the left, ran steeply up,
curving to the right, but just here it was level.</p>

<p>Neither of us said anything for a long minute. Neither of us
could have said anything if our lives depended on it.</p>

<p>Then, "It's done," I heard Villon say, and he was jaunty again
when I turned to him, his black eyes sparkling with triumph. "We
are through."</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed, "we're through." I wasn't as happy over that
as I might have been. I had spied an unmoving form sprawled at
our feet and the skin on my back was crawling. Alive, a Plebo is
not a pretty sight. Dead&mdash;imagine a dead spider big as a
man, all eyes, all glazed, fishy eyes...</p>

<p>Villon was looking at it too. "He died easily," he murmured,
"for so ungainly a creature."</p>

<p>"I don't like leaving him here." I tried to imitate my
companion's nonchalance. "Anyone coming along this passage will
at once know something's gone wrong, and it may mean the loss of
precious minutes for us. I wish there was somewhere we could hide
him."</p>

<p>"There is," Francois responded. "Right at hand."</p>

<p>"Where?" I glanced around, puzzled, saw nothing but bare
walls.</p>

<p>"In here." The poet laid his palm against the wall we'd just
penetrated. "If they do not find him 'til they come for you, we
shall have lost none of those jewelled minutes of which you
speak."</p>

<p>There was no argument as to that, but could it be done? "I
suppose one of us might carry the corpse in," I ventured. "But,
I'd rather not take the chance of your 'key' failing to
work."</p>

<p>"Nor I," Villon shrugged. "But perhaps our friend need not be
carried in there. There is strength in those rounded muscles of
yours, my old, and I suspect that whether he goes all the way
through or not will not matter to him."</p>

<p>I got his idea. "All right. We'll try it." I bent and lifted
the dead Plebo while Francois placed the 'key' against the wall.
The cadaver was lighter than I'd expected. Dangling from my
grasp, it seemed almost boneless. "Ready?"</p>

<p>Villon's thumb pressed, and I threw the corpse at the wall.
Threw it <i>through</i> the wall. It went into the blue, solid-
seeming stone as though that stone were merely an opaque fog.</p>

<p>There was no evidence left of the Plebo, out here in the
corridor, except a small, dark stain on its floor.</p>

<p>"I should like to be there," Francois chuckled, "when they
discover him in that cell, and you gone. Will they think, I
wonder, that we are masters of a magic they do not know?"</p>

<p>"They'll know damned well what's happened, and they'll be
after us like a shot. The only reason I can figure out for their
not having missed you yet is that they're so busy with
strengthening their defences against the drina. If we're to
accomplish anything we've got to get going."</p>

<p>"You have right," he agreed. "Which way shall we be going, up
or down?"</p>

<p>I wanted to say down. That way would lead out of the House of
Sun, would lead to the House of Earth. They must have taken the
others there, back to the room where humans from all the
centuries awaited the dreaded summons. They must have taken
Evelyn there, and Astaris, posing as me. My blood was hot again
with anger and the thought of the Doctil receiving the tenderness
intended for me hammered at my skull. I understood how a man
could kill and have no compunction at killing.</p>

<p>"Which way, my old?" Villon asked again.</p>

<p>"Up!" I answered. "When the Veil opened to let through the
stratcar which Kass summoned, I noticed a flash near the top of
this building. The control for the Veil must be somewhere above,
and if we can get to that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We may be able to raise the Veil and let the drina down into
the Bowl!" Villon finished for me. "You are right; up it is."</p>

<p>And so we climbed upward along the steep spiral of that
passage, while with me went the thought of Evelyn and Astaris and
what might be, what must be, passing between them. It doesn't
matter, I tried to tell myself. It doesn't matter at all. Before
she discovers that the man to whose caresses she gives herself is
not the Johnny she has loved since childhood, he will be dead,
and she will be dead, and the only living things left in the Bowl
of Adalon will be the mindless creatures they call the drina.</p>

<p>We seemed to have been climbing eternally, the curving of the
passage hiding what was behind us, and what was ahead. "Like the
living of life this is," Villon murmured. "A blind and toilsome
mounting whose aim we do not know. And when the end is attained,
we find it to be&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>"There's something at the top of this climb," I growled.
"There's got to be."</p>

<p>The spiral levelled out for a distance of about ten feet.
Ahead it started climbing again&mdash;Villon's clutch on my arm
brought me to a halt. "Hearken," he whispered, his long, grimy
forefinger stabbing toward the slope.</p>

<p>I heard what he meant. A faint whisper of movement, far ahead,
far above. Vague sounds brought to us by the resonance of the
tunnel.</p>

<p>"Some of them are up there," I murmured. "In the passage, and
coming this way. We've got to go back before they spy us."</p>

<p>"We'll not go back," Francois murmured, low-toned. "Hearken
once more, my poor friend."</p>

<p>There were faint sounds behind us now, behind and below. Our
retreat was cut off.</p>

<p>The poet's laugh was soundless, but in his eyes there were the
same bitterness and the same despair as had been in the laugh
with which he'd greeted the appearance of Kass. "They play with
us, my old," he whispered. "They play with us as a cat with a
mouse, or as a certain jailer of Paris with his prisoners,
permitting that they escape from their dungeon only to attain,
after much travail, another more foul and noisome." His poniard
slid from its sheath. "But they shall not take me, alive." The
dagger, stained with the blood of the Plebo he'd killed, flashed
to his breast&mdash;</p>

<p>I caught his wrist before the point had more than pricked the
velvet. "No, you fool," I grunted. "We're not caught yet. The
passage is level here, like it was outside my cell. That may mean
we're at another story of the building and that behind one of
these walls there's a chamber in which we can hide."</p>

<p>"It may. It well may." His eyes were sparkling again. "And
those we hear coming may be proceeding on their own affairs, not
hunting us. But behind which wall, my old, lies safety?"</p>

<p>"Nothing like finding out. This side's my guess. It's this
side the cell was on. Where's that 'key'? Quick. They're a lot
nearer."</p>

<p>I grabbed Villon's arm and his hand went up to the wall I'd
indicated. I was going through the grayness again, but I was
getting quite used to that. What bothered me was whether there
was a room on the other side of the wall, or whether it had
become the outside wall of the building so that, once through,
we'd go hurtling down&mdash;</p>

<p>We didn't. We came out smoothly, safely, on the other
side&mdash;I crouched, forcing Francois down with me, my pulses
pounding.</p>

<p>The space into which we had come was low-ceiled but long and
wide. It was bare as the cell from which Villon had rescued me,
but it was occupied.</p>

<p>At one end King Arthur and Orth and Louis were seated on the
floor, Elijah erect not far from them. Nearer us Evelyn Rand
walked leisurely about.</p>

<p>And strolling beside her was&mdash;<i>myself!</i></p>

<p>"Magic!" Villon gasped. "John is here and he is there,
and&mdash;" My palm over his mouth muffled the rest. Too late.
Astaris had turned, was looking straight at us with my eyes, out
of my face. But he did not see us. He could not have seen us, for
that turn of his had been slow and leisurely and Evelyn had
turned with him. She had not seen us either for now they were
walking slowly away, hand in hand as a couple of lovers might
walk beneath a silver moon.</p>

<p>"Johnny," I heard Evelyn murmur. "Are you sure it wasn't all
something we dreamed? What we've gone through can't be real, and
this too. This garden, this quiet peace, and you here with me,
it's all just as I pictured it, longingly, all those lonely
years."</p>

<p>"Why worry," I heard my own low voice answer from the lips of
that other who was so like me I might be looking in a mirror.
"This is real for now, this loveliness. Don't think of anything
else. Think of me. Think of how much you love me, and of
how&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes, Johnny?"</p>

<p>"And of how I love you." He was looking down at her now, with
a curious eagerness. "Tell me, my very dear, how I love you, and
why."</p>

<p>They were only a pace from us now, and yet there was no hint
that either was aware of our presence. I felt Villon quiver,
under my restraining hand.</p>

<p>"Why don't you <i>tell</i> me, Johnny?" They angled, as though
turning the corner of a path where I could see only naked floor.
"A girl wants to hear things like that from her lover." They were
walking parallel to the wall against which we crouched, about a
yard from it.</p>

<p>"Does she? I wouldn't know, Eve. I don't know how a lover
should speak and act. Will you teach me?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't your own heart teach you&mdash;? Oh look!" She
stopped, half turning to the wall. "Isn't this forsythia lovely?"
Her slim hand reached out to empty air, but her fingers seemed to
be touching something that wasn't there. "It's just like the bush
near the gate of our fence where I waited for you, years
ago."</p>

<p>I got it! Jumping Jupiter, I got it! Eve saw a garden,
shrubbery, where there was nothing at all but gray rock. The
others&mdash;I threw a swift glance at them and saw Orth's
fingers trail along the floor as one trails his fingers through
sod, saw Louis gesture as though he picked up a twig and threw it
from him&mdash;were victims of the same illusion. It was just one
more instance of the mass hypnotism, the capture of our weaker
minds by those infinitely more powerful, tremendously better
trained, that I had already experienced more than once. Its
purpose, this time, was clear.</p>

<p>Astaris had arranged a romantic setting for his laboratory
experiment in romance.</p>

<p>Villon and I were not affected by the illusion because the
Doctil did not know of our presence. And this implied that he
also saw this bare space as, a lovely garden, that to him also
there appeared to be shrubbery here where we crouched, forsythia
bushes that concealed us.</p>

<p>Could this be because he was himself the real subject of the
experiment and so deliberately was exposing himself to its
conditions, or because, assuming my eyes, my brain, he had also
assumed my susceptibility to the mass hypnosis? It didn't matter.
What mattered was that we were hidden from him by those illusory
bushes.</p>

<p>"Don't move," I muttered in Francois' ear. "Don't make a
sound." And then I was stealing away from him, crouched low, was
creeping stealthily toward Evelyn and her companion, their backs
still toward me.</p>

<p>I had to guess how far the invisible shrubbery extended. I had
to take the chance that my very real body would not rustle those
unreal leaves. All I could do was to make no sound on the
corporeal rock across which I stole.</p>

<p>I got within a yard of the two and sprang. My fist flailed,
pounded the jointure of spine and brain-case where a blow is
certain to stun a man. My victim thudded soggily to the
floor.</p>

<p>Evelyn whirled, screaming. Her scream cut off, and only a gasp
came from her throat. There was no color in her face, her lips.
Her pupils were dilated.</p>

<p>A strangled shout came from behind me. "The
garden&mdash;where?" There was the trample of feet running toward
us. There was Arthur's bellow, "Ho, varlet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Evelyn!" My arms went out to her, my hands found her
shoulders. "Eve! Don't look at me like that. I'm real. I'm your
Johnny. He wasn't&mdash;" Fingers bruised my own shoulder,
twisted me around. I saw Orth's furious countenance, King
Arthur's.</p>

<p>"John!" the latter exclaimed. "John March. Thou art he indeed.
But then who&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Astaris," I told him. "One of the Doctils. He took my shape.
He made you think he was I."</p>

<p>The king pulled the edge of his hand across his eyes, his face
ghastly. "Magicked again. A moment ago we were stretched on
greensward, besides a purling stream. Now&mdash;these walls, this
footing and ceil of bare stone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait." It was Orth who had grabbed me, and he had not let me
go. "How do we know this one is March and not&mdash;" He cut off.
He was gaping down at the floor and a green pallor spread across
his blunt jawed countenance. "Ach Gott!"</p>

<p>I twisted as far as his hold on me would permit, looked to see
what had affected him so. It wasn't my double that lay
unconscious at Evelyn's feet. It was Achronos Astaris in his
proper shape; tentacular limbs, bulbous small body clothed in its
orange integument, enormous head, all complete. The huge eyes
were sightless, staring.</p>

<p>"Now you know which one of us is the real John March," I
grated, jerking free from the Archduke's clutch. "Get him tied
up, with your belts, with everything you've got that can be made
into ropes, before he comes to."</p>

<p>"He must not be permitted to come to, John," Villon's quiet
voice said. "Tie him as we may, we cannot prevent him from
sending a mental message to his fellows." The poet dropped to his
knees beside Astaris, and his poniard was in his fingers.</p>

<p>"No!" I cried. "No, Francois!" He looked up at me, his shaggy
brows quizzical, his twisted smile mocking. "Oh, I haven't any
feeling for him, but we thought Arthur's idea of holding him as a
hostage was a good one, and it still may be. We'll tie him up,
and we'll keep him stunned. We'll watch him every minute, and the
instant he shows signs of regaining consciousness, we'll conk him
again."</p>

<p>"He is right, Villon," Orth supported me. "It may do us some
good or not, but to keep him alive yet awhile cannot do
harm."</p>

<p>The Frenchman shrugged. "Perhaps. Yet I would fear him less if
he were dead."</p>

<p>"We approve of our John's advice," Arthur put an end to the
discussion. "The creature shall be bound, and we, in our own
proper person, shall make it our charge that he remains
asleep."</p>

<p>I left the others to tie up the Doctil, got to the girl's
side. "Eve!" She was rigid, her tiny face still and pallid.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" My arm was around her, I was drawing her close
to me.</p>

<p>Her mouth twisted. "I&mdash;I kissed him, Johnny. I gave my
kiss to that&mdash;Thing."</p>

<p>"It was I you gave that kiss to, darling," I murmured. "You
thought it was I you were giving it to, and that makes it all
right. Or it will, as soon as you correct the misdelivery."</p>

<p>"Will it, Johnny?" That tight mouth of hers broke into a
tremulous smile. "Will it?"</p>

<p>It seemed to. At any rate the tenseness went out of her, and
she was very sweet, very warm, in my arms.</p>

<p>We were reminded that we were not alone in some ecstatic
solitude by Louis' boyishly plaintive voice. "I wish someone
would tell me where the garden went to. I liked it. It was the
first time I'd viewed grass and flowers since I was a very little
boy."</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor kid," Evelyn exclaimed. Pulling free of me, she
ran to him, put her arm around him. "You poor, poor child. They
put you in prison when you were only nine years old, didn't
they?"</p>

<p>"The garden wasn't real, Louis," I told him. "Astaris made you
all 'see' it, and when I knocked him out he couldn't make you see
it any longer."</p>

<p>"There will be no gardens anywhere, John," Villon drawled, "if
we spend our time on kisses and prattle. Have you forgotten the
mission on which we set out?"</p>

<p>"What mission?" Orth demanded. "I told them about the
<i>drina's</i> attack, about our plan to attempt to lift the Veil
of Ishlak and let them into the Bowl. There is no doubt in my
mind that if the creatures are powerful enough to keep the Veil
from closing, they will be able to tear down every building in
Adalon," I ended. "And so there will be no safety from them for
anyone in Adalon, for Plebos or Doctils&mdash;or us. Villon and I
made the decision for you, my friends, when you were not there to
ask, because we felt that is how you would want it. Were we
right?"</p>

<p>Elijah was the first to answer me. "Gladly would I embrace the
Angel of Death, knew I that in the same dark flight he would bear
off those heathen who have denied their Creator and would destroy
His work." Looking about at the faces of the others, I read
confirmation in their grave lineaments, their level gaze. I
sought Evelyn's.</p>

<p>"I could not love you," she said, simply, "if I thought you
would consider saving my life at the cost of letting them carry
out their dreadful plan. I am not afraid to die, Johnny, now that
I have been in your arms."</p>

<p>"All right," I said, crisply to hide the emotion that was
tearing at my throat. "We'll go ahead with it then, if we can.
But I'd give a lot to know what's going on out there. If they've
already driven the drina away, or destroyed them, there would be
no use in our trying to find the place from which the Veil is
controlled. But as it's impossible for us to find that out,
I&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Monsieur</i> Marsh!" Louis interrupted. "I think that
perhaps you can do that. When first we were left alone in this
garden I saw you&mdash;this Doctil who pretended to be
you&mdash;gazing into something that appeared like a mirror,
thinking himself unobserved. I wondered then what he saw in it
that made him look afraid and angry, both at once. Maybe this
thing he looked into was no mirror at all, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Some device similar to television," I finished for him. "In
taking my form he seems to have lost a great many of his mental
powers, and he'd want to keep in touch. If we can find it&mdash;"
I turned to Astaris' bound form, and saw that Villon was already
kneeling to it, his long, deft fingers searching it.</p>

<p>"This that he wears is skin-tight as the costumes of the
tumblers who amuse the rabble on Seine's bank of a feastday," the
poet reported. "It gives no space for the concealment&mdash;Ah!"
he broke off. His hand came out from under the body it was
searching, and there was a gleaming plate in it, circular and
about the size of a woman's hand glass. "It lay beneath him. Your
clothing, on him, was an illusion, but this is real."</p>

<p>"I hope the fall hasn't put it out of commission." I reached
for it. "Let me see." He gave it to me.</p>

<p>The thing looked very much like the toilet article to which
I've compared it, except that it had no handle. It was somewhat
thicker too, and the edge of the disk was serried with tiny
protuberances. The mirror itself was oddly milky, so that in it
the reflections, of my face and of Evelyn and the others crowding
about me to peer into it, were vague and wraithlike.</p>

<p>"Post thou see aught?" King Arthur demanded, glanced at him.
He was watching the recumbent Doctil, his scabbarded sword held
clublike in his big hands. He wasn't allowing curiosity to
distract him from his self-delegated task of keeping our hostage
unconscious and innocuous. "What dost thou see?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," I answered, my voice flat with disappointment.
"It's a washout."</p>

<p>"Johnny!" Eve exclaimed. "Those bumps on the edge look like
push-buttons. Why don't you try pressing them?"</p>

<p>"Good girl!" The excrescences were indeed movable. I squeezed
them.</p>

<p>The misty reflections vanished from the glass. It was clear,
abruptly, and glowing. But it showed only a meaningless jumble;
broken shapes of stone, corners, canted walls, a disjointed
tentacle, a single great eye, the confused pieces of a jig-saw
puzzle or a surrealist's nightmare. "Damn!" I grunted. "It's
television all right. But I can't make head or tail&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He held it like this." The Dauphin grabbed the rim of the
disk, tugged at it 'til I was holding it vertically. The chaos
slid beneath its surface as it moved, and changed
kaleidoscopically, but it was still a chaos.</p>

<p>"Oh," Eve stamped her foot. "It's exasperating."</p>

<p>"Wait!" I grunted. "I'm like a kid with a toy piano, banging
all the keys at once." I let all save one of the buttons come up.
"That does it!"</p>

<p>Etched crystal-clear in the mirror was the corridor where
Villon and I almost had been caught. "The buttons control the
distance the thing sees, and by pressing all of them I was
superimposing layer after layer of this building upon one
another, like a dozen transparent pictures." A Plebo went by in
the glass descending, some peculiarly shaped instrument in his
hand. Another followed him. "They're still looking for Francois
and me."</p>

<p>"I doubt that," Orth disputed me. "These people better ways of
finding you will have than running around like chickens with the
heads chopped off. For example, they must have more than one of
these glasses and with them in minutes they could scan the whole
of Adalon."</p>

<p>"He has right, John," Francois agreed. "Me, I think they
hasten to the defence of their city. Perchance the drina once
more have pierced the Veil."</p>

<p>"We'll soon see. Which way was Astaris facing this when you
saw him use it, Louis?"</p>

<p>The youngster showed me, and then, as I pressed buttons in
rotation, room after room of the House of Sun appeared in the
mirror and flicked off. I should have liked to examine each but
it was more important to determine what the situation was
outside.</p>

<p>The last button brought a vista of the Bowl of Adalon into the
round glass.</p>

<p>The aspect of its level floor had not changed much from when
we'd crossed it, shepherded by Daster, except that the girders no
longer flowed across it to the tower, and that the tower was
finished. A number of Plebos were clustered around its base and
Favril and Bolar were among them, but it was up the lacy spire
that my eyes lifted&mdash;to where its apex, level with the rim
of the bowl, was surmounted by a wide platform that held a knot
of Plebos and Daster and several machines whose nature I could
not make out.</p>

<p>The occupants of the platform were looking outward and there
was something in their posture that told me that they were
afraid. I canted the small glass to bring what they gazed at into
its circle, and I saw.</p>

<p>I saw the brink of the cliff and the grayish purple cloud that
mounded monstrously there, more menacing than any thunderhead. It
was not storm with which that cloud was pregnant but hate and the
lust to kill and the vilest of deaths. It was not cloud. It was a
massing of a myriad pulsing bodies merged by their own weight,
their own avid pressure into one, and it was restrained only by
the shimmer of force Villon had called the Veil of Ishlak from
pouring down upon Adalon.</p>

<p>And in Adalon the men of the future watched the dark and
mindless death brooding over their city and were afraid. If the
veil should yield to its awful thrust they would perish
horribly&mdash;and we with them.</p>

<p>But Earth, the Earth of the Twentieth Century, would be saved.
Somehow I must find a way to make the Veil yield.</p>

<p>As these thoughts flashed through my mind, John Orth groaned.
"Mother of all Living. This is horror&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's it!" I exclaimed. "That may be the answer." An idea
that may have lain beneath the surface of my mind all this time
had broken through.</p>

<p>"Maybe," I said trembling with sudden hope, "maybe we don't
have to die after all, my friends. Maybe we can save Earth from
the Doctils without that."</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch23" name="ch23">23. THE MOTHER OF ALL LIVING</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"What?&mdash;How?&mdash;Johnny, what do you
mean?..." A tumult of questions beat at me, but I paid them no
attention as I feverishly thumbed the button of the television
disk that I'd first pressed, at the same time moving the device
to focus again the corridor just outside this chamber.</p>

<p>The plan that had sprung into my mind was breathtaking in its
simplicity, but there were many things I had to know before I
could even attempt carrying it out. The level part of the passage
was now empty of life. I moved the disk so as to follow the
descending spiral and catch up with the last of the hurrying
Plebos I'd glimpsed. The thing he carried was, in the same manner
that a revolver is a miniature cannon, a miniature of one of the
machines on the towertop.</p>

<p>"Yes," I muttered, "that must be it. They've been called
together to guard something or someone tremendously important.
Pray, Elijah. If you have any influence with your God, pray that
it's in this building."</p>

<p>"Look here, March," Orth insisted. "We've got a right to know
what you're up to." The Plebo I watched reached another of the
level places in the ramp, halted, and turned to the blank wall.
"What are you looking for?"</p>

<p>"You named it yourself, Orth. You handed it to me on a silver
platter."</p>

<p>"I named it!" The Plebo melted into the wall and I manipulated
buttons to follow him. "What did I name, John Marsh?"</p>

<p>The room that came into the disk was walled with silver and it
was as large as the one we were in. Ten Plebos, each armed with a
weapon such as the newcomer carried, stood in a circle and at its
center on a raised dais the Doctil Gohret stood above a case of
some transparent substance within which, couched on billows of
white, softly gleaming silk lay&mdash;"Marsh!" Orth was
insisting. "What was it I named?"</p>

<p>"The Mother of All Living," I answered him softly. "Look at
her. The mother-to-be of all the living whom the Doctils intend
shall inherit our own good green Earth when they have conquered
it."</p>

<p>Within that case she was larger by far than any woman any of
us have ever known, but she was formed like the women we knew and
not like the grotesque beings of the Future who guarded her. Her
skin was as white as the cushioned silk on which she lay nude,
her eyes closed, and more lustrous. She was great-bosomed, huge-
limbed, immensely wide of hip. Her face was possessed of pale,
almost unearthly beauty but it was a bovine beauty, a mindless
calm that made of her something less than human.</p>

<p>"The Matra," I breathed. "The Queen Bee. The spawner of ova
for the Doctils and the only one of her kind left alive. From her
they must get the seed of the superhumans of whom they dream, and
without her their dream cannot be fulfilled. Without her they
will be five Doctils and a hundred Plebos, and never any more.
Without her there would be no point in their depopulating Earth
of our race and our generation, for without her they could never
repeople it again with theirs.</p>

<p>"That is why they guard her, and Gohret. If only one Doctil is
left alive with her, he can recreate his race. If all of them
escape the drina, but she dies, they are beaten."</p>

<p>"And so," Villon was the first to comprehend, "we must slay
her."</p>

<p>"No, Johnny!" There was horror in Eve's cry. "She is a woman,
a mother. It would be an unspeakable crime."</p>

<p>I twisted to her. "A crime, Eve, and unspeakable&mdash;but not
mine. They are guilty of it who degraded womanhood to the level
of a breeding machine. You call that Matra a mother, but is she?
It takes love to make a mother, and years of fostering care. That
poor creature will never know her offspring, never even see them.
She is no more a mother than a hen whose eggs are taken from her
as soon as they are laid and placed in an incubator to batch.
And, Eve, million's upon millions of real mothers on the Earth of
our time will die, as horribly as you saw the mothers of this
planet die&mdash;if the Matra lives. If <i>she lives they</i>
will die, and the children whom they have borne in suffering, and
fed at their breasts, and agonised over, will die. It is the
Matra's life against the lives of those mothers, one against
millions."</p>

<p>I was justifying my proposal not only to her but to myself. It
ran counter to all the tradition bred into me, to all I had been
taught. I recalled with what horror I'd watched, in the twentieth
century I was fighting to protect, bombs rain from the sky upon
women, mothers&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Matra is not even a woman, Fraulein Evelyn," Orth put in.
"Look how in that so beautiful face there is no hint of a soul,
no semblance of thought. Were she a woman, did she know what she
is and what is done with her, she would embrace death as a mercy
and a blessed release."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she is asleep," Evelyn objected, weakly. "Maybe if
she were awake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That isn't sleep, darling," I interrupted. "Look. That case
is hermetically sealed. There is no way for air to get into it,
let alone food. She is in a state of suspended animation, a sort
of living death. She is to all intents, already dead. It is only
a very tiny spark of life that would be extinguished if she were
killed."</p>

<p>The girl made a little, halting gesture with her hand. "You
are right, Johnny, and I am wrong." And then she smiled
tremulously and put her hand on my arm. "But look. If you can
take her away from them and not kill her, they'd give anything to
get her back. Promise me you won't kill her unless you have to.
Please, Johnny, promise me that."</p>

<p>I would have promised her the world with a fence around it
right then. "I promise, Eve."</p>

<p>The fluttering touch of her fingertips on my cheek was thanks
enough.</p>

<p>"You promise much, John, and talk much about seizing the Matra
or slaying her," Francois said softly. "But of how it is to be
done you say nothing. Is it that you will enter that room, bow,
and say prettily, 'Messieurs, I have come to slay her whom you
guard, armed with weapons against which I have no means of
attack. Pray stand while I slice her gullet."</p>

<p>He was right. I looked again into the disk, saw again the
quiet, confident circle of Plebos around that gleaming casket,
saw the orange-torsoed Gohret beside it, one splayed hand resting
on its top. Of all the Kintat this one was the most implacable,
the most nearly naked intelligence, the most formidable. What
strength did we have, what strategy could we evolve, that could
have any hope of success against him?</p>

<p>"Have faith in the Eternal, my son," Elijah intoned.</p>

<p>"The Most Holy arms the righteous with the lightnings of His
wrath. Jehovah casts the cloak of His omnipotence about them who
go forth to battle against His enemies."</p>

<p>"I fear me, sage," Villon's slurred accents took issue with
him, "that your Jehovah has forsaken this land and all who people
it. I seem to recall that its inhabitants were in the very act of
worshipping Him, or Someone very like Him, when disaster fell
upon them."</p>

<p>"Silence!" Arthur ordered. "We will not have this squabbling
while our John March meditates upon the means to defeat the
heathen."</p>

<p>And Louis was piping, "You'll win over them, <i>Monsieur</i>
March. You will, I'm sure of it."</p>

<p>Whether I wished it or not, I had assumed the leadership of
the little band. I had to justify their faith in me. I simply had
to. "I'll work out some way of getting at the Matra," I told
them, pretending a confidence I didn't feel. "But we ought to
have two strings to our bow. Suppose we see what chance there is
of our carrying out our original idea, to lift the Veil of Ishlak
and let the drina down into the Bowl."</p>

<p>I moved the disk, pressed the proper button. The scene outside
flashed into the glass once more&mdash;the strange structures
that were arranged as the planets of the Solar System are
arranged, the defending tower with its cluster of Future Men
about its base and on the platform at its top. Their tenseness,
the slow throb of their ear-membranes, filled with a brooding
fear the Bowl of Adalon.</p>

<p>The gray-purple mass of the drina pressed against the Veil,
waiting. They'd wait there 'til the end of time if need be. Hate
would keep them there, the hate that was the last remnant of
mentality the conquerors of their world had left them. The lust
to kill would keep them there, the blind lust to destroy that the
maddening vibrations of those conquerors' sonic vibrators had
instilled in them, a grisly exchange for the souls of which they
had been robbed.</p>

<p>There seemed in this latter circumstance a twisted justice, a
grotesque sort of retribution.</p>

<p>My throat tightened. One of those who crowded around me to
look into the disk may have jolted my arm, or perhaps some
obscure impulse had made me tip it a little, so that I was
looking over the cloud of the drina and beyond it.</p>

<p>At any rate, silhouetted against the low brown sky, I saw
something that had not been there before, that could not, I
swear, before this have been seen from within the Bowl. Black,
and so vast as to blot out a full quadrant of the sky in which it
hung, I saw the statue that was my first memory of the Land Where
Time is Not. The haunched body, the soaring legs, the hooded,
awful head of a Being that was neither man nor beast.</p>

<p>Or was it the statue? Immense as it was, it seemed to have a
quality of life that the great monument had not possessed. Was
this because it was a mirage? Or was it? Reason rejected the
other hypothesis. And yet&mdash;and yet, the tremendous
apparition was not quite the same as the monument that had so
astounded me. Its hood seemed lifted a little. The eyes still
hidden with that hood seemed to be gazing down on the hosts of
the drina. And something in the poise of that vast head, in the
very lines of that monstrous body, seemed to speak of pity, and
sorrow, and also of a patience that was reaching its end.</p>

<p>The others saw it too, they must have seen it. For I heard
Elijah's rolling, orotund tones, answering Villon. "Oh little man
of little faith. The Eternal is infinite and all-present. Nor in
the uttermost reaches of the Firmament, nor in the ultimate end
of Time, is there limit to Him, nor let to His majesty. For His
own inscrutable purpose He may permit His faithful to suffer, but
never, in the end, does He forsake them."</p>

<p>And for once Francois Villon had no mocking reply at the tip
of his tongue.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch24" name="ch24">24. THE MAGNIFICENT FOOLS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The presence in the brown sky faded and was
gone. It must after all, I told myself, have been a mirage. But I
was not quite able to rid myself of a certain awe. I had seen
Something few men have been privileged to see through all the
ages, and the despair, the empty feeling of helplessness that had
weighed me down, curiously was lessened.</p>

<p>I returned to a scrutiny of the tower. I counted the Plebos
under Daster's command on the high platform. Twenty-six. It was
more difficult to count those below, but I saw there were
certainly in the near neighborhood of fifty. Ten were with
Gohret, guarding the Matra and one was dead. Originally, I
recalled, there had been a hundred.</p>

<p>That left only a handful unaccounted for, not more than
fifteen certainly. Where were these?</p>

<p>Blurred movement at the edge of the disk seemed to offer an
answer. I shifted it to bring the movement near its
center&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" I exclaimed. "Look at that."</p>

<p>The movement I'd glimpsed was at the entrance aperture to the
House of Earth. There were coming out of it no Plebos, but the
giant Norseman, light glinting from his winged metal casque, and
the blonde Briton. Streaming after them came the Roman in his
toga, the vividly garmented Egyptian, the Mongol Lieutenant of
Genghis Khan, all the humans who'd congregated in the room from
which Daster had called me and my companions.</p>

<p>They started running, toward the Future Men at the base of the
tower! Something flashed through the air ahead of them and a
Plebo on the fringe of the cluster nearest them toppled, an arrow
quivering in the back of his enormous head. The Redskin who'd
dispatched that arrow fitted another to his bow. The bare,
muscular arm of a patrician-featured Greek swept back to launch a
javelin.</p>

<p>"They're attacking!" Evelyn cried. "They're charging the
Future Men!"</p>

<p>"If they capture and destroy the tower..."</p>

<p>The Viking came on in great bounds, swinging a two-handed
sword broader even than Excalibur. The Roman's, close beside him,
was a short blade little longer than a knife. The Greek's javelin
arced over their heads, found its mark in another Plebo's
eye&mdash;</p>

<p>Passed right through and left the Plebo, standing,
unaffected!</p>

<p>"Damn!" I grunted. "Now that the Future Men know they're
coming those things can do no more harm to them than Orth's
bullet to Daster."</p>

<p>The Indian's second arrow swept harmlessly through the
defenders of the tower. A stone axe hurled by a pelt-clothed Pict
might have been thrown at shadows, for all the effect it had. The
Plebos were facing the charge, their weapons in their hands now,
weapons like those with which the ones guarding the Matra were
armed. The very calmness with which they awaited the attack gave
proof of how little they feared it. But the Norseman came on,
waving his sword, his walrus mustaches drooped on either side of
a mouth wide open to vent a bellow of defiance I could not hear.
The attacking column rushed toward the menace of the Plebos'
mysterious weapons and not one of the motley assortment that
composed it hestitated or turned to flee.</p>

<p>"They are fools," I heard Villon voice what was in my mind.
"But what magnificent fools!"</p>

<p>Or were they? The Plebos held their fire and the Viking, still
foremost, was within ten yards of them. Did the charging men have
a chance? If they had, if they captured the tower&mdash;The wing-
helmeted head vanished from the Norseman's shoulders! The Roman's
sword arm was sheared off clean at the joint and his abruptly
legless torso thudded down, quiveringly, horribly still alive.
The Egyptian was sliced in half, a slashed fragment of the Indian
skidded across the plaza...</p>

<p>It was over. There had been no flashes from the Plebos'
weapons. There had been no evidence that they'd done any thing
but stand there and wait for the charge to reach them, yet there
no longer was any charge. Nothing was left of those who'd
attacked with such magnificent courage save scarcely recognizable
fragments of human bodies scattered over the rocky plain.</p>

<p>There was no blood. It seemed especially horrible that they
did not bleed.</p>

<p>"Take them, Oh Eternal," Elijah droned. "Take their bright
souls to Thy bosom and give them eternal rest."</p>

<p>"Amen," I whispered, and I heard a whispered amen from Orth
and Louis, from Arthur and Evelyn. None of us could possibly have
spoken above a whisper, for a long moment.</p>

<p>The throbbing silence was broken by Villon. "And that, my
friend," he was not smiling, "is what awaits us in the chamber
where the Matra lies."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, poet," I growled, "I'm going to have a try at
making our friends of the future pay for what they've just done
out there."</p>

<p>"You were going to find the controls for the Veil," Evelyn's
soft voice reminded me.</p>

<p>That brought me back a little to myself. I blotted out the
scene outside the House of Sun, drew the probing rays of the
television disk within it, started scanning its every nook and
cranny.</p>

<p>It was a vast labyrinth of passages, a warren of rooms large
and small. Some of the rooms were empty, some piled to the
ceiling with all kinds of things that I should like to have
examined more closely. I went on and on, grimly searching for the
vulnerable heart of Adalon's defences.</p>

<p>I had begun at the lowermost level of the immense structure,
and now my search had reached the base of the dome that
surmounted it, and as yet I had not found that for which I
hunted.</p>

<p>The great stratcar hangar came into the disk. Only one of the
silvery fliers remained there; all the rest, I guessed, had gone
out to fight the drina and had been wrecked. I tried to recall
how many there had been. About a dozen. Each of the missing ones
must have been ridden by at least one Plebo. There still were
four or five to be located. They must be somewhere.</p>

<p>The disk moved slowly in my hand. It was grayed by the
momentary blankness I had learned meant that the beam, or
whatever it was that scanned the distant scenes, was passing
through a wall. The grayness cleared and I was looking at a
vaulted room fully as large as that where the stratcars had
been.</p>

<p>This, however, was not like the hangar, hollow and empty. It
was packed with a maze of gleaming metal, of glowing tubes and
looped cables, the whole vibrating so that I could almost hear
the hum of leashed energy.</p>

<p>"This is it," I said hoarsely. "This is their powerhouse."</p>

<p>Here, for the first time anywhere in the House of Sun except
the room where the Matra slept, I found life. A single Plebo
paced around the intricacy, his enormous eyes intent upon it.</p>

<p>"One," Villon murmured. "There is only one." From the corner
of my eye I saw that he fingered the hilt of his poniard. "Wait,"
I said. "Wait, Villon."</p>

<p>At one end of the plexus of polished steel and copper the
cables joined and formed a huge coil, something like the
intricate induction coils of a radio except that this was perhaps
a hundred yards in diameter. No conductor left it. All the energy
that was being created here was being fed into this, and
apparently remained there.</p>

<p>That was queer, I thought, then recalled what Daster had told
me of the manner in which the Future Men used their own brains as
electrical machines. It dawned on me that they mentally tapped
this reservoir of power and directed it to where it was
needed.</p>

<p>That was that. I could not get at the controls of the Veil of
Ishlak because those controls were the minds of the Doctils
themselves. Wait! I did not have to worry about the controls! The
energy that formed the Veil originated in that room and if we
could reach it, if we could destroy the prime power-source it
housed, the Veil would collapse.</p>

<p>The Veil would collapse and the drina would pour down into
Adalon. They would surge over the Doctils and over the
Plebos.</p>

<p>And over us. Over Evelyn.</p>

<p>I recalled what I had seen on the entrance plain. I recalled
the linked armor that still held the empty shape of a man. Not
even that much would be left of the honey-haired girl, the gray-
eyed girl whose lips I had tasted and found sweet.</p>

<p>There was that other room. The room where Gohret and his
Plebos watched over the Matra.</p>

<p>I had just seen what folly the thought of a frontal attack on
them was. To think of reaching the Matra by stealth was as
futile. Her case was in the chamber's very center, the unbroken
circle of Plebos around it and Gohret beside it. Only an
Adalonian could even enter that room in safety. Now if only I
could assume Astaris' shape as easily as he had mine&mdash;</p>

<p>Maybe that wasn't necessary. Maybe&mdash;"It's worth a try," I
said aloud.</p>

<p>"What's worth a try, Johnny?" Evelyn inquired. "What are you
thinking about?"</p>

<p>I turned to her, drinking in that slender body of hers,
etching on my memory its delicate curves, the translucent oval of
her face. I had come to a decision and I had only a few moments
more to capture an image of her to take with me into
oblivion.</p>

<p>"Johnny." Her hand was in mine. "Why don't you answer me?
You've figured out something. Why don't you tell us what it
is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. I've figured out a way of getting at the Matra
that has a one-in-a-million chance of coming off. But before I
talk about that, I want to arrange for the second string to our
bow, the lifting of the Veil. I'm sure that can be done."</p>

<p>The others were looking at me now, their eyes questioning.</p>

<p>"Francois," I said. "You were watching the disk as closely as
I was. Do you think that you can find the room where the great
machine is?"</p>

<p>"Of a surety, my cabbage. That is very simple for one who
could travel the roofs of the Faubourg St. Germaine on nights
when even the squawling cats were blind, and in all that myriad
of windows find the one behind which slept the maiden to whom his
current fancy drew him."</p>

<p>"Fine. Because I want you to lead them there, Elijah and Orth
and Louis, and Evelyn. Arthur too, carrying Astaris with him.
When you get near it, you will leave the others and sneak into
that place and use your poniard on the Plebo in there."</p>

<p>A crooked grin crossed the Frenchman's face. "Understood, my
carrot."</p>

<p>"When you've disposed of him, call in the others. And
wait."</p>

<p>"Wait? For what?"</p>

<p>"You'll know. Because I'm going to give you this television
disk to take along&mdash;here Louis, you'd better carry
it&mdash;and in it you will watch the room of the Matra. What you
see happen there will tell you, Arthur," I turned to him and
Orth, "whether to smash the lights you will see glowing here and
there about the machine in that room."</p>

<p>"To smash lights." Arthur's brows gathered in puzzlement. "And
why should you set us to smashing lights, John March?"</p>

<p>"If you are discovered," I ignored his question for the
moment, "don't stop to fight but smash those lights. Because,"
now I answered the king, "when they are smashed the power will be
shut off from the Veil of Ishlak and there no longer will be a
Veil to hold back the drina and so there will be no point in
fighting.</p>

<p>"Orth," I continued, trying not to see the effect of that on
them, "give me your gun. Francois, after we are out in the
corridor I shall want the thing you took from the Plebo you
killed, the 'key' as you call it."</p>

<p>"Why, Johnny?" Evelyn broke in, her eyes widening. "What are
you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to try to get to the room of the Matra, darling,
and I'm going to try to kill her. The chances are a million to
one against my succeeding, but if I do succeed, in time, you will
have a chance to live."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"Oh," I shrugged, "I'll make out all right." And quickly, so
that she should not read in my eyes that I lied, that whether I
killed the Matra or not I would surely die, I turned to the
Dauphin. "Louis. It will be your job to act as lookout to warn
the others of the approach of any Plebos or Doctils. And, my boy,
if and when it becomes necessary for the lights to be smashed, to
warn them of the approach of the drina."</p>

<p>Now I was almost finished. I had only one more instruction to
give. "Francois. A word in private with you, if the others will
not mind."</p>

<p>We stepped aside and I murmured what I had to say in his ear.
He heard it, and blinked at me, and then I thought he stood a
little more erect, a little more proudly than before. "John," he
murmured. "John Marsh. I have received the accolades of counts
and dukes, of a king and a Pope but never, in my misspent life
have I been honored as thus at its end you honor me."</p>

<p>What I had told him was that if it came to it that Louis
warned of the drina's approach, he was gently, very gently, to
slip his poniard into Evelyn's heart.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch25" name="ch25">25. TO DIE ALONE</a> </h2>

<p class="first">A soft thud swung me to King Arthur. His
sheathed sword was lifting from Astaris' enormous head.</p>

<p>"The varlet stirred," the king explained, "and we had to quiet
him."</p>

<p>I stared down at the Doctil, grotesque, malignant even lying
there bound and unconscious. If in that instant of dawning
awareness, he'd sent out even one syllable of a cry for help, my
million to one chance of getting to the Matra and gaining for
Evelyn a slim hope of survival was gone.</p>

<p>There was no way of telling whether he had sent out that
appeal.</p>

<p>Villon's arm was across my shoulder. "John," his low voice
murmured. "Indeed there is peril for all of us, but for the task
of greatest peril you have appointed yourself. You are young. You
have the love of that sweet maiden to live for. For me, even were
I to return to my land and my epoch, there is nothing left but a
dreary exile, poverty, the haunted skulking of an outcast. Let me
take your place, and you mine."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Francois," I answered. "But it isn't any
melodramatic heroism that motivates me. If what I'm going to try
to do can be done at all, only I can do it. I'm the only one who
possibly can hope to get near the Matra. We're wasting time.
Let's get started."</p>

<p>I was sure that the 'key' would take two at a time through the
wall, and I didn't want to risk experimenting with more. Our
exodus to the corridor, therefore, took longer than I liked,
Villon ferrying us through one by one. I went first, to stand on
guard with Orth's gun, and each time Francois vanished into the
stone, I wondered whether before he returned I should see a squad
of Plebos hurrying toward us, through simple bad luck or brought
by some call from our prisoner. My palms were wet with cold sweat
by the time Arthur appeared with the stunned Doctil across his
shoulder so for the sake of doing something I took the 'key' from
him myself and went back to bring Francois out.</p>

<p>I dropped it into my vest pocket when we were in the corridor
again, and saluted the men. They moved away, rounded the curve of
the corridor where it lifted upward to continue its long spiral,
passed from sight. I was alone with Evelyn for the last time.</p>

<p>I dared take only a minute for our parting, dared not trust
myself to speak. Nor was it with words that she told me that my
love for her was no greater than hers for me.</p>

<p>Then Evelyn Rand was going away from me, to join the others
who were waiting for her, and I was really alone. Forever. I
turned, started down the long, winding incline towards where, as
surely as though I myself had drawn the plans of the House of
Sun, I knew I would find the cell of the Matra and those who
waited with death in their hands for any enemy who might try to
approach her.</p>

<p>I wasn't afraid of what lay ahead. One is no longer afraid
when one knows that death is imminent and inevitable.</p>

<p>I went over what I contemplated. I would have to rehearse my
every act, my every movement so that they would follow one
another precisely, mechanically. If I had to think, even for an
instant, I would fail. That was&mdash;</p>

<p>My hand flashed to Orth's gun in my pocket as I whirled to a
footfall behind me&mdash;"Eve!" burst from my lips. "My God, Eve.
What&mdash;?"</p>

<p>She slipped her fingers into the crook of my elbow. "You
didn't think I would let you go alone, Johnny," she smiled. "You
didn't really think I would let you die, without me at your side
to die with you." There was a glint of mischief in her eyes, a
mischievous twist at the corners of her mouth. "I waited 'til I
was sure you had gone too far to send me back, and then I came
after you."</p>

<p>"You little fool. You dear little fool. You'll ruin
every&mdash;" I checked. Her being with me wouldn't ruin my plan.
It might even help it.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do, Johnny?" she asked. "What's your
plan?"</p>

<p>I had to tell her. I had to be sure that she understood it in
every detail. "It's very simple, my dear. I'm going to pretend to
be Astaris."</p>

<p>"Astaris! But you can't make yourself look like him."</p>

<p>"I don't have to. He made himself look like me. Gohret knows
that, doesn't know he's changed back. He doesn't know that I've
got hold of one of the instruments that enable the Plebos to go
through the walls. When I come through the wall into that room,
he'll be almost certain, in the first instant, to think I'm
Astaris."</p>

<p>"In the first instant. But he can read our thoughts, Johnny.
He'll read yours, and since you know that you're really John
March he'll know it too, at once."</p>

<p>"That's the weakest point of my scheme. But I think can get
past it."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p><i>"By being</i> Astaris. By convincing myself that I am
Astaris, as a great actor convinces himself that he is the
character he portrays; so that every unconscious gesture of his
is that character's and not his own. I'm no actor, the Lord
knows, but now I have to be one and I will."</p>

<p>"I know you will, Johnny." Her quiet trust in me gave me
renewed confidence. "I know you will. But, Astaris, why should
you keep your disguise as March when you're going to Gohret?"</p>

<p>"Whoa up, Eve. You don't know that I'm Astaris. You still
think I'm John March. You've asked a question that was bothering
me 'til you showed up but now it's answered. Here's the story. I
assumed John March's personality, his whole make-up, in the hope
that your love would evoke a corresponding emotion in me. You
see, I can't conceive that it is anything but a physical or
chemical reaction, requiring only a duplication of conditions to
come about. Well, I've succeeded. I've learned the nature of
love. Under normal conditions I would bring you before the whole
Kintat to confirm it, but because the others are occupied with
the defense against the drina, I'm taking you to Gohret
alone.</p>

<p>"If I changed back to my real form, you would be terrified,
and the experiment ruined. I might even lose the effect it has
had on me. That's why I'm still posing as John March. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>Her brow wrinkled, adorably. "It's a little complicated.
You're Astaris, and you want Gohret to know that, but you want me
to think that you're my Johnny."</p>

<p>"Exactly. I'm posing as Astaris posing as me. I am Astaris
posing as John March. Your part is easy. You know I'm John March,
and you're very much in love with me. You don't understand what
I'm up to but you trust me implicitly."</p>

<p>"In other words I just have to be myself."</p>

<p>"Exactly. You can even be as scared as you please of Gohret
and the Plebos. You only have to be careful to remember to forget
what happened in that garden back there."</p>

<p>"You mean when you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold it, darling. I kissed you in the garden, and we were
very happy with our love, so that you almost forgot all the
strange things that had been happening until then. I asked you to
come somewhere with me, and you answered that you would go
anywhere as long as it was with me, anywhere in the world or out
of it. You're a little startled because you have suddenly found
yourself in this corridor. You'll be somewhat more startled when
I've taken you into the room of the Matra, and you'll be
terrified of Gohret, but you will depend on me to take care of
you. Come on, my very dear. We've got only a little farther to
go. And trust me."</p>

<p>"Yes, Johnny, dear. I trust you always and forever."</p>

<p>She has no suspicion that I am Astaris, I thought. She trusts
me, and she loves me. Queer. This feeling I have towards her,
drawing me to her, thrilling me at the very touch of her, is
baffling. Something electrical in its nature, something chemical.
I can't quite analyze it, using March's brain. If I could use my
own&mdash;I'd better not, just yet. I don't have to. Gohret will
examine us, both of us, and he'll know exactly what change she
has made in me. Ah. We're here, outside the Room of the Matra. I
hope that her terror over what she'll see in it won't mask her
love-reactions from Gohret. Well, that's a chance I have to take.
But I'll try to prepare her for what awaits her.</p>

<p>"We're going through this door, dear," I said aloud. "There
will be things inside you won't understand, but trust me, no harm
is going to come to you."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid, Johnny," she answered. "As long as I'm with
you. But kiss me, before you open that door."</p>

<p>I took her in my arms, the way I'd seen it done so many times,
in so many different centuries, and I pressed my lips against
hers. Her slender body was trembling in the circle of my arms,
and her lips were cold on mine. Mine were cold too, and there was
a tightness around my brow. That was because this was the crucial
moment of my experiment, and I was really quite worried lest it
fail. Strange how this love business makes one susceptible to
other emotions too, how it weakens one's philosophical attitude
toward all the phenomena of nature.</p>

<p>I took her arms tenderly from about my neck. "We've got to go
in, darling," I said. I took her hand in mine. My fingers slid
into my vest pocket and, standing close to the wall, I pressed
against it. We were going through the wall. We were in the Room
of the Matra. The guards circled the crystal case, and Gohret
stood above it, thinking how much depended on the white, sleeping
form within it.</p>

<p>The Plebos were startled. Their weapons came up. "Gohret!" I
sent the thought to my brother Doctil, proud a little of my
triumph. "My experiment has succeeded. I want you to examine the
change in me, but be careful not to disturb the female."</p>

<p>Aloud, I said, as Evelyn Rand might expect John March to say,
"You sent for us, Mister. What do you want?" And I kept moving
toward the center of the room.</p>

<p>We were moving straight on the lifted weapons of the Plebos.
The fools. They look uncertain. They are about to loose their
rays. Is my pose as John March too well done? Don't they, doesn't
Gohret, believe that I am Astaris?</p>

<p><i>John March's hand closed on the butt of the gun in the
pocket of his jacket, and his fingers curled over its
trigger.</i> </p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch26" name="ch26">26. VENGEANCE</a> </h2>

<p class="first">Evelyn Rand's feet dragged. There was no color
in her face and her eyes were dark pits in its pallor. Gohret's
thoughts were unformed, puzzled, as he stood motionless above the
bed of the Matra and watched us come toward him.</p>

<p>They became clearer.</p>

<p>"Something wrong, something blurred, in the way he
communicates with me I do not recognize Astaris' mind."</p>

<p>"That is because my mind uses the cells of March's brain," I
answered him, silently. "I am surprised that you do not
comprehend it."</p>

<p>I was beginning to be a little angry at his stupidity, at the
insolence of the Plebos who stood steadfast, blocking me. Me, a
Doctil! They were blocking my way no longer. Two had moved aside
to let us pass.</p>

<p>We were on the platform. We were within a long pace of the
Matra's case. <i>John March's gun moved a bit to aim at the form
within it&mdash;</i></p>

<p>Gohret's right tentacle lashed forward! <i>March's finger
squeezed the trigger!</i> The Doctil grabbed my arm in that exact
moment. I saw the case smash into splinters, I saw a red splotch
on the Matra's temple. "Goodbye, Eve!" I gasped, as the Plebos
whirled to cut us down&mdash;Darkness smashed into the room,
utter, impenetrable darkness!</p>

<p>Gohret's reaching arm found me, and I pounded it with the butt
of the gun, out of my pocket now. "The power!" I sensed his
startled thought. "All power's off!" All about me was a jumble of
panic, the Plebos' dismay, their confusion. I knew they were
trying to ray me down, but nothing was happening. Nothing was
happening because their weapons no longer tapped the energy that
would have sliced us to pieces as we'd seen the charging men
sliced, out on the floor of the Bowl.</p>

<p>Keeping tight hold of Evelyn I lurched toward where I recalled
the wall was, was using Orth's gun as a club to batter the unseen
Plebos out of my way. Confused, panicky, they were blundering
into one another, into us. Gohret's mind was searching for us,
but we were screened from it by the terror of the Plebos, by
their silent shouts, "The Veil. The Veil of Ishlak is gone. The
drina are coming." Abruptly I was through their heaving mass, was
staggering across a free space, Eve still in the circle of my
arm.</p>

<p>"It wasn't any use," I gasped. "We've killed the Matra, but
Arthur had smashed the machines." We thudded into something hard,
vertical. "We've saved our world, but we're through. The drina
will get us."</p>

<p>"We've saved our world, Johnny," I heard her answer. "And we
can die happy. Like this." Her lips trailed across my cheek,
found mine and clung to them.</p>

<p>"No." I pulled my head back from hers. "Maybe the books are
closing on us, but we aren't dead yet." I was fishing in my vest-
pocket. "We're not giving up. If we're going to die, we'll die
trying." I didn't have any hope the 'key' would get us through
the wall now, with no energy-flux for it to tap, but I was going
to try it. "The drina haven't gotten us yet."</p>

<p>There were two small objects in my pocket. One of them was the
key. The other&mdash;I brought them both out&mdash;the other, I
recalled, was the black gem that I'd found in Evelyn Rand's room
in Westchester and had carried ever since.</p>

<p>"Put your arm around my waist, Eve," I directed. I held the
gem in my left hand while I put the key against the vertical rock
and squeezed it.</p>

<p>Nothing happened. Well, I had expected that. We were done for.
We'd stay here 'til the drina found us&mdash;</p>

<p>We wouldn't be alive when the drina found us. Gohret was
coming toward us! In the same curious manner that I'd been able
to hear their unspoken words, I knew that he'd succeeded in
quieting the Plebos, had located us, and was coming to take
revenge on us for the death of the Matra. He was no longer the
cold, intellectual man of the future. He was white hot with rage,
with fury, and he wasn't going to leave us for the drina. I
turned to meet him&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Started</i> to turn! The floor heaved&mdash;threw me
against the wall. I shoved both hands against it, to save myself
from falling. The black stone in my left hand clicked on the
rock, and there was a sharp, tearing sound. Dim, brownish light
jagged the blackness of the wall and there was dust in my
nostrils. The break in the facade widened, and I half fell
through it.</p>

<p>Evelyn fell with me into the spiral corridor. Its floor heaved
as I spun to meet the menace of the Doctil&mdash;was just in time
to see the cleft in the wall through which we'd come closed by
rock fragments tumbling into it, to see them crush in Gohret's
ungainly skull. Evelyn's little fists were pounding my back. "The
drina, Johnny," she screamed above a shrill vibration of sound
that 'til now I had been unaware of. "Look."</p>

<p>The brownish light came in through the aperture at the end of
the long ramp out of which Daster, long ago, had led me from the
House of Sun. That aperture was jagged-edged now, was growing
wider as I glimpsed it. Was being made wider by amorphous,
purple-gray tendrils tearing at its rocky frame, tearing the
stone from it in great chunks. A purple-gray sea surged out there
beyond it, and it was from this sea that the shrill, ear-piercing
whistle rose.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" I grunted. "The projectors on the tower were
useless when the power was cut off, and there was nothing at all
to hold back the drina. They've swallowed all the Future Men out
there, and now they're tearing this building apart to get at the
few left inside here&mdash;and us. That's why it's shaking so, as
if it were in the grip of an earthquake. It's curtains for
us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not yet, Johnny. Their tearing at the building was what broke
the cleft in the wall, and saved us from Gohret. Don't you get
some hope from that?"</p>

<p>"I don't see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Johnny!" Evelyn shook me. "You said we'd die trying."</p>

<p>"Yeah," I grunted. "But what's there left to try? Look.
They're coming" The aperture large enough, a purple-gray mass was
oozing through it. "And they're tearing the whole building down
over our heads. Wait! They can't tear the whole building down all
at once, it's too huge. It will take them a long time. There's
one thing we can still try. If we can get to the top ahead of
them, if that stratcar can still fly&mdash;Come on!"</p>

<p>We were running up that steep, winding incline. We were
running endlessly. Behind us, and below, was the shrill and
terrible whistle of the drina, and the thud of falling stone, and
abruptly there was a great scream in my mind, a soundless scream
that I knew to be the death cry of the Plebos whom we'd left
behind in the Room of the Matra.</p>

<p>And then the scream was ended, and there was only the shrill
whistle of the drina, and that was fading, and the shuddering of
the floor under our feet had diminished to an almost
imperceptible vibration. We were running, endlessly running in
the sightless dark, endlessly circling, endlessly climbing.</p>

<p>My legs ached, every muscle, every sinew a separate, tearing
pain. An iron band about my chest constricted my lungs and each
gasping breath sliced them. My temples pounded&mdash;</p>

<p>Evelyn wasn't beside me any longer.</p>

<p>I halted, turned back. "Eve!" I gasped. "Eve!"</p>

<p>No answer. No sight of her in that absolute darkness.</p>

<p>I started back, groping. "Eve!" I mustn't pass her in the
dark. "Eve!" I staggered from side to side of the passage to make
sure I would not pass her. "Eve, darling." My feet thudded
against something soft, and I went to my knees.</p>

<p>"Johnny." It was barely audible. "I can't...run any longer.
Kiss me... Johnny...and go."</p>

<p>I bent forward and kissed her. And then I was working my arms
under her, to lift her. I couldn't. I no longer had the strength.
I couldn't lift Eve. I couldn't carry her to safety.</p>

<p>Well, this was as good a place as any to die. I settled down,
like that, her warm body in my arms, the softness of her against
my chest, my lips on hers in a long, long kiss.</p>

<p>Very faintly I began to hear the drina's shrill whistle. They
were coming. They were coming up the black spiral. Very slowly
they were coming, and they had a long way to come, but they'd get
here.</p>

<p>I was tired. So tired...</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch27" name="ch27">27. DUST UNTO DUST</a> </h2>

<p class="first">Something seized me, tore me from Eve, lifted
me. I cried out some unintelligible gibberish, batted feebly at
that which had taken hold of me&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tis he, by my halidom," a familiar voice boomed. "'Tis our
John March." King Arthur's great voice. John Orth's guttural
tones, answering him. "And the Fraulein Evelyn."</p>

<p>"Arthur," I managed to whisper. "What? How...?"</p>

<p>"We essay to sortie from this castle, the Archduke and I," he
answered "The others preferred to await their fate above."</p>

<p>"You can't get out, Arthur. You'll have to go back. Listen. Do
you hear that whistling sound?" It was only a little louder. "The
drina are making that. They're coming up the passage. You can't
get past them."</p>

<p>"Back it is, then." He started off, carrying me. "Follow, Duke
Orth."</p>

<p>"Let me down," I said feebly. "I can walk."</p>

<p>"Nay. Layest thou quietly in our arms, John. Thou art but
hardly able to make thyself heard. Thou hast not strength to make
this exceeding great climb but we have the strength for both. Lie
still, and let thy king carry thee."</p>

<p>There wasn't any use in arguing with him. "What happened,
Arthur? Why did you smash the machinery? Didn't you see in the
disk that we'd gotten into the room of the Matra? Why didn't you
give us a few seconds more?"</p>

<p>"Nay an that we would have, had we been able. The Frenchman
had slain the single guard, and we were gathered in the chamber
where the magical contrivances buzzed like an hundred hives of
bees, all but the lad Louis who guarded without as thou hadst
commanded him. We watched thee in that Satan's circle, marvelling
that the demons permitted thee to pass through their ranks, that
the orange-clad ogre seemed to greet thee amicably but in that
instant the lad cried out, 'Plebos! Ware Plebos!' and instanter I
with <i>Excalibur,</i> the duke and the Jew and the Frenchman
with their bare hands, shattered the witch lights that shone
there.</p>

<p>"In the sudden night we leaped upon the demons already within
the chamber. Then, indeed, Excalibur proved its worth. The
unequal combat was over and done with in a trice. No quarter was
asked in that fray, and none given."</p>

<p>"How about Astaris?"</p>

<p>"He remaineth our prisoner."</p>

<p>I would have asked more, but just then the passage curved and
levelled out, and ahead a wavering yellow light silhouetted
Elijah's tall, bearded form and cast a wavering glimmer on the
faces of Villon and the Dauphin, who seemed absorbed in something
the poet was telling him. The light came from a small, extremely
smoky fire on the floor. "We each gave some article of our
apparel," Arthur explained it. "And Duke Orth set flame to them
with fire dust he beareth with him."</p>

<p>"Powder for that gun of mine," the Austrian made clear.</p>

<p>"Let me down," I told Arthur. "I'm all right now." This time
he took my word for it and so I was on my own feet when Villon
spied me.</p>

<p>"John!" He bounded toward me, and before I could prevent him,
had kissed me on the cheeks. "John! Mourning you for dead, I was
about to compose an elegy for you. And Evelyn," he turned to her.
"The white flower of all man's dreams! Now indeed, Elijah my
bearded rabbi, I begin to have some credence in the efficacy of
your heathen prayers."</p>

<p>"We still need those prayers, Elijah. Listen." I lifted my
hand. The whistle of the drina came clearly from the passage that
had led us here. "We've got just about five minutes to find some
way out of here, and I don't know what that could be, unless the
stratcar's still working. Is there any way we can get into the
hangar?"</p>

<p>"We've searched. Its walls are solid&mdash;But you have the
'key', John!"</p>

<p>"I have it." Somehow I'd held on to it all this time. "But it
isn't any good." I held it out to him. "Want it for a
souvenir&mdash;" It was my left hand I had held out. The black
thing on its palm was not the 'key,' but the carved gem.</p>

<p>"How came you by this?" It was Elijah who demanded that,
staring down at the thing. There was something of surprise,
something almost of awe, in his face. "How came you by it?"</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"The very basis of the Kabbala," the prophet answered me. "The
very essence of all its philosophy. Look you." He pointed at it.
"The Snake of Life, swallowing its own tail, and therefore
without beginning and without end. His coils wind in and out in
symbol that the spirit of the Godhead, no matter how twisted, no
matter through how many planes of existence, how many layers of
time and space it passes, returns always upon itself, and is
always of one nature, one being. Israel possessed this before my
time, and before my time it was lost! How come you by it, John
March?"</p>

<p>"I found it in Eve's room."</p>

<p>Elijah turned to her, but it was to me she said, "You gave it
to me, Johnny."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>She smiled wanly. "I mean the play-friend I called Johnny gave
it to me. At least, I found it on my dresser one day, after he'd
gone. I don't know where it could have come from."</p>

<p>"It was I who left it there." No voice this but a brain-echo I
knew must come from a Doctil. From Astaris, the only Doctil still
alive. "I found it on this planet, Evelyn Rand, and I left it
with you when you were a child so that I should know you again
when you had grown old enough to be brought here." He stood
beside me, his broken bonds at his feet. "When I had brought you
here I replaced it where I had first left it to mark for me the
man you were destined to love."</p>

<p>The nape of my neck prickled. Astaris had brought the gem to
Earth from this planet, yet Elijah had recognized it as a sacred
symbol of the creed that was among the very first on Earth to
proclaim the Oneness of God. It was made of the selfsame
substance as the awesome monument of the Being the drina
worshipped, yet a million years before there had been any contact
between Earthman and drina, it, or something so like it that the
Prophet in Israel had been able at once and fluently to interpret
its intricate message, had existed on Earth. There was meaning
beneath meaning in the carved gem. Was it, I asked myself, by
accident that the wall of the Matra's room had split for Evelyn
and me precisely where I had struck it with the gem&mdash;?</p>

<p>"The drina!" The Dauphin's cry broke in upon these thoughts.
<i>"Messieurs</i>, the drina are upon us," and the shrill whistle
of the drina pierced my ears and their slither was very loud
against the spiral tunnel's walls.</p>

<p>I twisted to where it debauched into the room, saw the first
gray-purple psuedopod squirm in, saw Arthur leap to it, saw
<i>Excalibur</i> flash above his blonde locks and slash down.</p>

<p>The jelled and terrible mass quivered in the doorway,
hesitant. "Take the maid, my old," Villon whispered to me, his
smile still holding the twisted and bitter mockery with which it
greeted life and death alike. "Retreat with her behind the great
engine and do there what you must. We will defend you as long as
we may." Then he was beside the king, his poniard hacking at a
renewed surge of the drina as Orth thrust a twist of powder, a
bullet into my hand, whirled and with a bar snatched from
somewhere had joined the others.</p>

<p>As I feverishly reloaded Orth's pistol, I saw Elijah flailing
the dark protoplasmic surge with a black length of wrist-thick
cable. The gun was ready and I looked for Evelyn, found her
wrestling with the Dauphin who struggled to break her hold and
join the hopeless battle against the <i>drina.</i> I saw her eyes
widen with horror abruptly, saw the boy break loose and dive
headlong to where a slow wave rolled over the Archduke and
engulfed him.</p>

<p>Arthur already was gone, but the white-maned patriarch and the
poet still fought, giving back step by reluctant step from the
horror&mdash;it was utterly useless to fight but that somehow
they slowed in its inexorable advance. "Evelyn," I called. "Eve,"
and as she came about to me strong in my nostrils was the perfume
that had been all I'd known of her for so long, the fragrance of
a terrestrial spring that neither of us would ever know again.
"Eve, darling," I said. "There is only one more thing I can do
for you." Raising the pistol, taking careful aim, I said. "You
understand, I know."</p>

<p>I read comprehension in her gray eyes and thanks and love. I
heard Elijah drone the prayer a devout Hebrew prays when he is
about to die, and I heard the prayer silenced. I heard Villon
cry, "Farewell, John and Evelyn. Fare you very&mdash;" and that
cry was blotted out. I gritted my teeth for the pull on the
trigger that would give Evelyn a clean death&mdash;</p>

<p>"No!" Astaris' voice in my brain forbade the shot. "No, John
March. Wait!"</p>

<p>I'd forgotten him, but now in that blazing instant our minds
were one and I knew that he had the power to save himself or us
but not himself <i>and</i> us.</p>

<p>"I am sending you back, John Marsh. You&mdash;and Evelyn
Rand."</p>

<p>His experiment had been successful. He had set out to learn
love and he had. He'd learned love and in learning love he'd
learned sacrifice.</p>

<p>A scream of ultimate anguish threaded blue-edged through my
brain&mdash;but it was not from Evelyn it came, nor from me. We
were wrapped in sudden darkness. Not darkness. An absence of
color, of form, of reality itself. We were falling through
nothingness. We were caught up in some unimaginable maelstrom, we
were whirling down and down in a spaceless, timeless
nonexistence.</p>

<p>All about us was the soft and voiceless whisper of whirling
dust.</p>

<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch28" name="ch28">28. THE FORK IN TIME'S RIVER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A whorl of dust swirled away from us down the
country road and faded into the gray and quiet light of dusk.</p>

<p>Cicadas began their shrill piping in the thickets. The evening
star twinkled in the sky's darkening blue and I turned to Evelyn.
"We're home, Eve," I murmured. "We're home again, dear heart. In
our own time. In our own world."</p>

<p>"Home, Johnny." She opened the gate and a faded, tenuous voice
came to us out of the dusk. "Come, Evelyn. Come in and bring your
young man with you. Come in to Faith who's been waiting a long
time for you."</p>

<p>The voice came from the porch of a great house that glimmered
whitely in the dusk. Faith Corbett, so shrunken and fragile that
it seemed a not too high wind must blow her away was calling from
the open door that framed a rectangle of light, warm and
welcoming. Hand in hand Evelyn and I went up the path to the
house where a lonely child with curls the hue of honey used to
play with the Johnny of her dreams.</p>

<p>It seemed natural that supper waited piping hot for us on the
table in a high-ceiled dining room walled with dark and lustrous
oak. It seemed so natural that it was not 'til we sat side by
side on the cushioned sofa before the great fireplace in the
parlor that Evelyn thought to ask Faith Corbett how she'd known
to have the house ready for us, how she'd known we were coming
home.</p>

<p>"I knew," she smiled faintly. "When John talked with me in my
cottage I knew then that he would find you and that he would
bring you home in two days."</p>

<p>"Two days, Faith!" I exclaimed. In that Otherwhere it had
seemed but a few hours. "Are you sure it is two days since I
talked with you?"</p>

<p>"Aye, I am sure," her thin voice answered. "That was Sunday
afternoon and this is Tuesday night." And then she was rustling
out of that drowsy room, so bent and shrunken and old that she
seemed a wraith from some, Otherwhere herself, and left us to the
red leap of the fire and to the peace of our being together with
no fear brooding in our hearts and no doom overhanging us and our
world.</p>

<p>Eve stirred in my arms, after a while. "Johnny," she murmured.
"It&mdash;it was all a dream, wasn't it. I dreamed it."</p>

<p>"No, dear heart. You didn't dream it. It was very real.
It&mdash;" my brow puckered. "I&mdash;I'm not so sure. It's
getting so vague now. It does seem as though I dreamed it. But we
couldn't both have had the same dream. That isn't possible."</p>

<p>"How do we know it was the same dream, Johnny?" Eve asked. The
scent of her was in my nostrils, the redolence of spring and the
evasive fragrance of dreams. "Suppose we tell each other what we
remember, and then we'll know whether it was the same&mdash;the
same nightmare we both had."</p>

<p>"No, darling. We won't talk about it any more. Not tonight.
But I'll write it all out, and you'll read what I've written and
tell me whether it checks with your memories."</p>

<p>And so, when at last we went up to the rooms Faith Corbett had
prepared for us, airing them, warming the sheets, I did not go to
sleep but sat down at an old desk to write what I could remember.
This that you have read is what I wrote that night, and all the
next day, and all the next night, and when I read it over after
I'd finished, it was all quite as new to me as it was to you.</p>

<p>And Evelyn had no memory at all of any of her part in the
narrative.</p>

<p>Now this might seem to prove that it was only a particularly
vivid nightmare that I had had, except for this. Evelyn cannot
tell me where she was between Sunday, January 26th and Tuesday,
February 11th of this year nor has the most diligent search
unearthed for us anyone who saw her between when the doorman of
her apartment house watched her set out for church and when Faith
called to us from the doorway of her old home in Westchester. And
none of my friends, my acquaintances can be found who saw hide or
hair of me on Monday the 10th or Tuesday, the 11th.</p>

<p>I have been able to locate the entrance guard of a certain art
gallery on Madison Avenue, the owner of a second hand bookstore
on the same thoroughfare, a policeman who was on post near that
bookstore Monday before noon and a taxi driver. All four of these
men recall me and the latter three recall exactly the details I
have set down in this narrative.</p>

<p>Understandably, I think, I did not care to interview the owner
of the drugstore on Plum Street.</p>

<p>In addition, I have looked up whatever is known about the
other five of us who were taken out of time&mdash;if my story is
true. There is no question as to the inexplicable disappearances
of Francois Villon and John Orth. The incident of Elijah and the
pillar of fire is in the Old Testament, of Arthur's passing in
the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> and in Tennyson's immortal poem. The
evidence as to the Dauphin is confusing. He did vanish from the
Paris prison where he had been jailed from the age of nine, but
some legends still extant insist that he escaped and lived to a
secluded old age on Long Island. But then it will be recalled
that I did not actually see Louis die. It is possible that
Astaris sent him back to his own time as he did Evelyn and me to
ours.</p>

<p>All these circumstances seem to confirm what I have written.
There is another concerning which I cannot make up my mind as to
whether it verifies or casts doubt on my tale.</p>

<p>One day, not very long ago, Evelyn and I decided to make a
pilgrimage to Furman Street, and examine the curious old house at
four-nineteen. We took a taxi, and I dismissed it exactly where
that other had had its flat.</p>

<p>Now that, to my certain knowledge, was the only previous time
I'd ever been in this section of Brooklyn, yet I threaded the
maze of those quiet streets with the curious names of Orange,
Pineapple, Cranberry, in absolute certitude, and found Plum
without any trouble.</p>

<p>We walked past the drugstore where I seem to have had a weird
experience with a card that no one could see but I and started
climbing the slope at whose end was the brightness of a blue sky
over the water of the bay.</p>

<p>The glorious massing of towers at the end of Manhattan Island
rose slowly above the summit of that ascent. "The house is right
at the end of this vista," I told Eve. "We'll see it in a
moment."</p>

<p>We came to the end of the sidewalk, at Furman Street. Along
that waterfront thoroughfare ran the rows of four-storied
graystone houses I recalled, exactly as I recalled them. The one
to our left had the number, 415, painted on the third step of its
high stoop. The one to our right was number 423.</p>

<p>Between them was an iron fence edging a green lawn. The
emerald velvet ran to the edge of the retaining wall that keeps
Furman Street from tumbling into the East River, and there was no
house upon it. None at all.</p>

<p>There was no Four Nineteen Furman Street. There never had
been.</p>

<p>I hope this means that the adventure I have related was some
strange illusion, that Eve's disappearance for two weeks, mine
for two days, has some other explanation. For otherwise there is
this disquieting thought to haunt me.</p>

<p>The Kintat of Doctils who will conquer the planet of the drina
a million years from now, will believe themselves, their Plebos
and their Matra, to be the sole remnant of Mankind. But suppose
they are not. Suppose that from among the people of some other
Earth City other Doctils, another Matra, will survive the
catastrophe. Suppose that these will plan just such a return to
the Earth of what to them is the dim past&mdash;as Astaris and
his fellows will. Suppose that right now they are somewhere among
us, spying on us.</p>

<p><i>Suppose that man in the subway this morning, that man with
the strangely yellow skin and the weird, veiled
eyes</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, Johnny," Evelyn interrupts. She has been reading over my
shoulder, a cute trick now, but I'm afraid I shall have to ask
her to stop that sort of thing when our honeymoon is over. "If it
all really happened, we know the course of history for a million
years and we know that no race of Future Men will come back to
conquer us in this century or any other."</p>

<p>"We know nothing of the sort," I answer her. "We know nothing
about the nature of Time as yet. It might well be that Time is
like a great river with many forks down any or all of which the
great tide of history may flow. Are we certain that Mankind has
only one destiny, the one we saw in the Hall of Midnights. Can we
be wholly sure that the end of Man inevitably must be that which
we saw?"</p>

<p>She has a way, I have learned, of withdrawing into herself
when she is thinking, of seeming to be far and far away. She does
that now, and now she is back to me, her gray eyes wide. "Johnny.
If that's so, Johnny&mdash;"</p>

<p>She checks herself. "If it's so," I ask, "what then?"</p>

<p>With her whimsical irrelevance that is not irrelevance at all,
she responds, "Remember, Johnny, why the Doctils picked our
century for the return to earth? Remember that this was the
critical time when what you just called the great tide of history
was at a fork in the river of Man's destiny?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I say softly, suspecting what is in her mind but
wanting her to put it into words. "Yes, I remember. Go on."</p>

<p>"I can't," Evelyn murmurs, her gray eyes deep and dark with
her thoughts. "I can't go on by myself and you and I can't,
Johnny, not just the two of us. But maybe all the people of all
the world, together, can."</p>

<p>"Can what, Eve?"</p>

<p>"Direct our destiny down the other branch of the fork in
Time's river, the branch that will bring our children's children
to some brighter and happier future than the dreadful one we saw
in that Hall of Midnight."</p>

<p>Her breath catches in her throat and her lip quivers, and she
is a child again, a frightened child in the dark. "Can't we,
Johnny? Please, Johnny, please say that we can. Please say that
we will."</p>

<p><i>I want to. Very terribly I want to reassure her but I
cannot. I alone, John March alone cannot tell her which way Man
will direct his destiny. It does not rest with me alone to
decide.</i> </p>

<p><i>It is for all of us to make that decision, no matter in
what part of the world we dwell, no matter with what tongue we
speak, no matter in what manner we worship Him Who looks down
upon Earth and upon some planet beyond the furthest galaxy. We
still have, or still can recover, Obligation and Loyalty and
Faith, and, yes, and Beauty and Love and with these still can
direct our destiny to some better goal than the Doctils showed me
and Evelyn in that Otherwhere. We still can decide.</i> </p>

<p><i>But we must make the decision soon. As Pierpont Alton
Sturdevant might say, in his lawyer's phrase, Time is of the
essence.</i></p>
