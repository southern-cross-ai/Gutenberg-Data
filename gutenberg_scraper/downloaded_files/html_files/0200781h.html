<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>THE MARK ON THE WALL</h2>

<p>Perhaps it was the middle of January in the present that I first
looked up and saw the mark on the wall. In order to fix a date it
is necessary to remember what one saw. So now I think of the fire;
the steady film of yellow light upon the page of my book; the three
chrysanthemums in the round glass bowl on the mantelpiece. Yes, it
must have been the winter time, and we had just finished our tea,
for I remember that I was smoking a cigarette when I looked up and
saw the mark on the wall for the first time. I looked up through
the smoke of my cigarette and my eye lodged for a moment upon the
burning coals, and that old fancy of the crimson flag flapping from
the castle tower came into my mind, and I thought of the cavalcade
of red knights riding up the side of the black rock. Rather to my
relief the sight of the mark interrupted the fancy, for it is an
old fancy, an automatic fancy, made as a child perhaps. The mark
was a small round mark, black upon the white wall, about six or
seven inches above the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>How readily our thoughts swarm upon a new object, lifting it a
little way, as ants carry a blade of straw so feverishly, and then
leave it...If that mark was made by a nail, it can't have been for
a picture, it must have been for a miniature&mdash;the miniature of
a lady with white powdered curls, powder-dusted cheeks, and lips
like red carnations. A fraud of course, for the people who had this
house before us would have chosen pictures in that way&mdash;an old
picture for an old room. That is the sort of people they
were&mdash;very interesting people, and I think of them so often,
in such queer places, because one will never see them again, never
know what happened next. They wanted to leave this house because
they wanted to change their style of furniture, so he said, and he
was in process of saying that in his opinion art should have ideas
behind it when we were torn asunder, as one is torn from the old
lady about to pour out tea and the young man about to hit the
tennis ball in the back garden of the suburban villa as one rushes
past in the train.</p>

<p>But as for that mark, I'm not sure about it; I don't believe it
was made by a nail after all; it's too big, too round, for that. I
might get up, but if I got up and looked at it, ten to one I
shouldn't be able to say for certain; because once a thing's done,
no one ever knows how it happened. Oh! dear me, the mystery of
life; The inaccuracy of thought! The ignorance of humanity! To show
how very little control of our possessions we have&mdash;what an
accidental affair this living is after all our
civilization&mdash;let me just count over a few of the things lost
in one lifetime, beginning, for that seems always the most
mysterious of losses&mdash;what cat would gnaw, what rat would
nibble&mdash;three pale blue canisters of book-binding tools? Then
there were the bird cages, the iron hoops, the steel skates, the
Queen Anne coal-scuttle, the bagatelle board, the hand
organ&mdash;all gone, and jewels, too. Opals and emeralds, they lie
about the roots of turnips. What a scraping paring affair it is to
be sure! The wonder is that I've any clothes on my back, that I sit
surrounded by solid furniture at this moment. Why, if one wants to
compare life to anything, one must liken it to being blown through
the Tube at fifty miles an hour&mdash;landing at the other end
without a single hairpin in one's hair! Shot out at the feet of God
entirely naked! Tumbling head over heels in the asphodel meadows
like brown paper parcels pitched down a shoot in the post office!
With one's hair flying back like the tail of a race-horse. Yes,
that seems to express the rapidity of life, the perpetual waste and
repair; all so casual, all so haphazard...</p>

<p>But after life. The slow pulling down of thick green stalks so
that the cup of the flower, as it turns over, deluges one with
purple and red light. Why, after all, should one not be born there
as one is born here, helpless, speechless, unable to focus one's
eyesight, groping at the roots of the grass, at the toes of the
Giants? As for saying which are trees, and which are men and women,
or whether there are such things, that one won't be in a condition
to do for fifty years or so. There will be nothing but spaces of
light and dark, intersected by thick stalks, and rather higher up
perhaps, rose-shaped blots of an indistinct colour&mdash;dim pinks
and blues&mdash;which will, as time goes on, become more definite,
become&mdash;I don't know what...</p>

<p>And yet that mark on the wall is not a hole at all. It may even
be caused by some round black substance, such as a small rose leaf,
left over from the summer, and I, not being a very vigilant
housekeeper&mdash;look at the dust on the mantelpiece, for example,
the dust which, so they say, buried Troy three times over, only
fragments of pots utterly refusing annihilation, as one can
believe.</p>

<p>The tree outside the window taps very gently on the pane...I
want to think quietly, calmly, spaciously, never to be interrupted,
never to have to rise from my chair, to slip easily from one thing
to another, without any sense of hostility, or obstacle. I want to
sink deeper and deeper, away from the surface, with its hard
separate facts. To steady myself, let me catch hold of the first
idea that passes...Shakespeare...Well, he will do as well as
another. A man who sat himself solidly in an arm-chair, and looked
into the fire, so&mdash;A shower of ideas fell perpetually from
some very high Heaven down through his mind. He leant his forehead
on his hand, and people, looking in through the open
door,&mdash;for this scene is supposed to take place on a summer's
evening&mdash;But how dull this is, this historical fiction! It
doesn't interest me at all. I wish I could hit upon a pleasant
track of thought, a track indirectly reflecting credit upon myself,
for those are the pleasantest thoughts, and very frequent even in
the minds of modest mouse-coloured people, who believe genuinely
that they dislike to hear their own praises. They are not thoughts
directly praising oneself; that is the beauty of them; they are
thoughts like this:</p>

<p>"And then I came into the room. They were discussing botany. I
said how I'd seen a flower growing on a dust heap on the site of an
old house in Kingsway. The seed, I said, must have been sown in the
reign of Charles the First. What flowers grew in the reign of
Charles the First?" I asked&mdash;(but, I don't remember the
answer). Tall flowers with purple tassels to them perhaps. And so
it goes on. All the time I'm dressing up the figure of myself in my
own mind, lovingly, stealthily, not openly adoring it, for if I did
that, I should catch myself out, and stretch my hand at once for a
book in self-protection. Indeed, it is curious how instinctively
one protects the image of oneself from idolatry or any other
handling that could make it ridiculous, or too unlike the original
to be believed in any longer. Or is it not so very curious after
all? It is a matter of great importance. Suppose the looking glass
smashes, the image disappears, and the romantic figure with the
green of forest depths all about it is there no longer, but only
that shell of a person which is seen by other people&mdash;what an
airless, shallow, bald, prominent world it becomes! A world not to
be lived in. As we face each other in omnibuses and underground
railways we are looking into the mirror that accounts for the
vagueness, the gleam of glassiness, in our eyes. And the novelists
in future will realize more and more the importance of these
reflections, for of course there is not one reflection but an
almost infinite number; those are the depths they will explore,
those the phantoms they will pursue, leaving the description of
reality more and more out of their stories, taking a knowledge of
it for granted, as the Greeks did and Shakespeare perhaps&mdash;but
these generalizations are very worthless. The military sound of the
word is enough. It recalls leading articles, cabinet
ministers&mdash;a whole class of things indeed which as a child one
thought the thing itself, the standard thing, the real thing, from
which one could not depart save at the risk of nameless damnation.
Generalizations bring back somehow Sunday in London, Sunday
afternoon walks, Sunday luncheons, and also ways of speaking of the
dead, clothes, and habits&mdash;like the habit of sitting all
together in one room until a certain hour, although nobody liked
it. There was a rule for everything. The rule for tablecloths at
that particular period was that they should be made of tapestry
with little yellow compartments marked upon them, such as you may
see in photographs of the carpets in the corridors of the royal
palaces. Tablecloths of a different kind were not real tablecloths.
How shocking, and yet how wonderful it was to discover that these
real things, Sunday luncheons, Sunday walks, country houses, and
tablecloths were not entirely real, were indeed half phantoms, and
the damnation which visited the disbeliever in them was only a
sense of illegitimate freedom. What now takes the place of those
things I wonder, those real standard things? Men perhaps, should
you be a woman; the masculine point of view which governs our
lives, which sets the standard, which establishes Whitaker's Table
of Precedency, which has become, I suppose, since the war half a
phantom to many men and women, which soon&mdash;one may hope, will
be laughed into the dustbin where the phantoms go, the mahogany
sideboards and the Landseer prints, Gods and Devils, Hell and so
forth, leaving us all with an intoxicating sense of illegitimate
freedom&mdash;if freedom exists...</p>

<p>In certain lights that mark on the wall seems actually to
project from the wall. Nor is it entirely circular. I cannot be
sure, but it seems to cast a perceptible shadow, suggesting that if
I ran my finger down that strip of the wall it would, at a certain
point, mount and descend a small tumulus, a smooth tumulus like
those barrows on the South Downs which are, they say, either tombs
or camps. Of the two I should prefer them to be tombs, desiring
melancholy like most English people, and finding it natural at the
end of a walk to think of the bones stretched beneath the
turf...There must be some book about it. Some antiquary must have
dug up those bones and given them a name...What sort of a man is an
antiquary, I wonder? Retired Colonels for the most part, I daresay,
leading parties of aged labourers to the top here, examining clods
of earth and stone, and getting into correspondence with the
neighbouring clergy, which, being opened at breakfast time, gives
them a feeling of importance, and the comparison of arrow-heads
necessitates cross-country journeys to the county towns, an
agreeable necessity both to them and to their elderly wives, who
wish to make plum jam or to clean out the study, and have every
reason for keeping that great question of the camp or the tomb in
perpetual suspension, while the Colonel himself feels agreeably
philosophic in accumulating evidence on both sides of the question.
It is true that he does finally incline to believe in the camp;
and, being opposed, indites a pamphlet which he is about to read at
the quarterly meeting of the local society when a stroke lays him
low, and his last conscious thoughts are not of wife or child, but
of the camp and that arrowhead there, which is now in the case at
the local museum, together with the foot of a Chinese murderess, a
handful of Elizabethan nails, a great many Tudor clay pipes, a
piece of Roman pottery, and the wine-glass that Nelson drank out
of&mdash;proving I really don't know what.</p>

<p>No, no, nothing is proved, nothing is known. And if I were to
get up at this very moment and ascertain that the mark on the wall
is really&mdash;what shall we say?&mdash;the head of a gigantic old
nail, driven in two hundred years ago, which has now, owing to the
patient attrition of many generations of housemaids, revealed its
head above the coat of paint, and is taking its first view of
modern life in the sight of a white-walled fire-lit room, what
should I gain?&mdash;Knowledge? Matter for further speculation? I
can think sitting still as well as standing up. And what is
knowledge? What are our learned men save the descendants of witches
and hermits who crouched in caves and in woods brewing herbs,
interrogating shrew-mice and writing down the language of the
stars? And the less we honour them as our superstitions dwindle and
our respect for beauty and health of mind increases...Yes, one
could imagine a very pleasant world. A quiet, spacious world, with
the flowers so red and blue in the open fields. A world without
professors or specialists or house-keepers with the profiles of
policemen, a world which one could slice with one's thought as a
fish slices the water with his fin, grazing the stems of the
water-lilies, hanging suspended over nests of white sea eggs...How
peaceful it is drown here, rooted in the centre of the world and
gazing up through the grey waters, with their sudden gleams of
light, and their reflections&mdash;if it were not for Whitaker's
Almanack&mdash;if it were not for the Table of Precedency!</p>

<p>I must jump up and see for myself what that mark on the wall
really is&mdash;a nail, a rose-leaf, a crack in the wood?</p>

<p>Here is nature once more at her old game of self-preservation.
This train of thought, she perceives, is threatening mere waste of
energy, even some collision with reality, for who will ever be able
to lift a finger against Whitaker's Table of Precedency? The
Archbishop of Canterbury is followed by the Lord High Chancellor;
the Lord High Chancellor is followed by the Archbishop of York.
Everybody follows somebody, such is the philosophy of Whitaker; and
the great thing is to know who follows whom. Whitaker knows, and
let that, so Nature counsels, comfort you, instead of enraging you;
and if you can't be comforted, if you must shatter this hour of
peace, think of the mark on the wall.</p>

<p>I understand Nature's game&mdash;her prompting to take action as
a way of ending any thought that threatens to excite or to pain.
Hence, I suppose, comes our slight contempt for men of
action&mdash;men, we assume, who don't think. Still, there's no
harm in putting a full stop to one's disagreeable thoughts by
looking at a mark on the wall.</p>

<p>Indeed, now that I have fixed my eyes upon it, I feel that I
have grasped a plank in the sea; I feel a satisfying sense of
reality which at once turns the two Archbishops and the Lord High
Chancellor to the shadows of shades. Here is something definite,
something real. Thus, waking from a midnight dream of horror, one
hastily turns on the light and lies quiescent, worshipping the
chest of drawers, worshipping solidity, worshipping reality,
worshipping the impersonal world which is a proof of some existence
other than ours. That is what one wants to be sure of...Wood is a
pleasant thing to think about. It comes from a tree; and trees
grow, and we don't know how they grow. For years and years they
grow, without paying any attention to us, in meadows, in forests,
and by the side of rivers&mdash;all things one likes to think
about. The cows swish their tails beneath them on hot afternoons;
they paint rivers so green that when a moorhen dives one expects to
see its feathers all green when it comes up again. I like to think
of the fish balanced against the stream like flags blown out; and
of water-beetles slowly raiding domes of mud upon the bed of the
river. I like to think of the tree itself:&mdash;first the close
dry sensation of being wood; then the grinding of the storm; then
the slow, delicious ooze of sap. I like to think of it, too, on
winter's nights standing in the empty field with all leaves
close-furled, nothing tender exposed to the iron bullets of the
moon, a naked mast upon an earth that goes tumbling, tumbling, all
night long. The song of birds must sound very loud and strange in
June; and how cold the feet of insects must feel upon it, as they
make laborious progresses up the creases of the bark, or sun
themselves upon the thin green awning of the leaves, and look
straight in front of them with diamond-cut red eyes...One by one
the fibres snap beneath the immense cold pressure of the earth,
then the last storm comes and, falling, the highest branches drive
deep into the ground again. Even so, life isn't done with; there
are a million patient, watchful lives still for a tree, all over
the world, in bedrooms, in ships, on the pavement, lining rooms,
where men and women sit after tea, smoking cigarettes. It is full
of peaceful thoughts, happy thoughts, this tree. I should like to
take each one separately&mdash;but something is getting in the
way...Where was I? What has it all been about? A tree? A river? The
Downs? Whitaker's Almanack? The fields of asphodel? I can't
remember a thing. Everything's moving, falling, slipping,
vanishing...There is a vast upheaval of matter. Someone is standing
over me and saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm going out to buy a newspaper."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Though it's no good buying newspapers...Nothing ever happens.
Curse this war; God damn this war!...All the same, I don't see why
we should have a snail on our wall."</p>

<p>Ah, the mark on the wall! It was a snail.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>KEW GARDENS</h2>

<p>From the oval-shaped flower-bed there rose perhaps a hundred
stalks spreading into heart-shaped or tongue-shaped leaves half way
up and unfurling at the tip red or blue or yellow petals marked
with spots of colour raised upon the surface; and from the red,
blue or yellow gloom of the throat emerged a straight bar, rough
with gold dust and slightly clubbed at the end. The petals were
voluminous enough to be stirred by the summer breeze, and when they
moved, the red, blue and yellow lights passed one over the other,
staining an inch of the brown earth beneath with a spot of the most
intricate colour. The light fell either upon the smooth, grey back
of a pebble, or, the shell of a snail with its brown, circular
veins, or falling into a raindrop, it expanded with such intensity
of red, blue and yellow the thin walls of water that one expected
them to burst and disappear. Instead, the drop was left in a second
silver grey once more, and the light now settled upon the flesh of
a leaf, revealing the branching thread of fibre beneath the
surface, and again it moved on and spread its illumination in the
vast green spaces beneath the dome of the heart-shaped and
tongue-shaped leaves. Then the breeze stirred rather more briskly
overhead and the colour was flashed into the air above, into the
eyes of the men and women who walk in Kew Gardens in July.</p>

<p>The figures of these men and women straggled past the flower-bed
with a curiously irregular movement not unlike that of the white
and blue butterflies who crossed the turf in zig-zag flights from
bed to bed. The man was about six inches in front of the woman,
strolling carelessly, while she bore on with greater purpose, only
turning her head now and then to see that the children were not too
far behind. The man kept this distance in front of the woman
purposely, though perhaps unconsciously, for he wished to go on
with his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Fifteen years ago I came here with Lily," he thought. "We sat
somewhere over there by a lake and I begged her to marry me all
through the hot afternoon. How the dragonfly kept circling round
us: how clearly I see the dragonfly and her shoe with the square
silver buckle at the toe. All the time I spoke I saw her shoe and
when it moved impatiently I knew without looking up what she was
going to say: the whole of her seemed to be in her shoe. And my
love, my desire, were in the dragonfly; for some reason I thought
that if it settled there, on that leaf, the broad one with the red
flower in the middle of it, if the dragonfly settled on the leaf
she would say 'Yes' at once. But the dragonfly went round and
round: it never settled anywhere&mdash;of course not, happily not,
or I shouldn't be walking here with Eleanor and the
children&mdash;Tell me, Eleanor. D'you ever think of the past?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask, Simon?"</p>

<p>"Because I've been thinking of the past. I've been thinking of
Lily, the woman I might have married...Well, why are you silent? Do
you mind my thinking of the past?"</p>

<p>"Why should I mind, Simon? Doesn't one always think of the past,
in a garden with men and women lying under the trees? Aren't they
one's past, all that remains of it, those men and women, those
ghosts lying under the trees...one's happiness, one's reality?"</p>

<p>"For me, a square silver shoe buckle and a dragonfly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For me, a kiss. Imagine six little girls sitting before their
easels twenty years ago, down by the side of a lake, painting the
water-lilies, the first red water-lilies I'd ever seen. And
suddenly a kiss, there on the back of my neck. And my hand shook
all the afternoon so that I couldn't paint. I took out my watch and
marked the hour when I would allow myself to think of the kiss for
five minutes only&mdash;it was so precious&mdash;the kiss of an old
grey-haired woman with a wart on her nose, the mother of all my
kisses all my life. Come, Caroline, come, Hubert."</p>

<p>They walked on the past the flower-bed, now walking four
abreast, and soon diminished in size among the trees and looked
half transparent as the sunlight and shade swam over their backs in
large trembling irregular patches.</p>

<p>In the oval flower bed the snail, whose shelled had been stained
red, blue, and yellow for the space of two minutes or so, now
appeared to be moving very slightly in its shell, and next began to
labour over the crumbs of loose earth which broke away and rolled
down as it passed over them. It appeared to have a definite goal in
front of it, differing in this respect from the singular high
stepping angular green insect who attempted to cross in front of
it, and waited for a second with its antenna trembling as if in
deliberation, and then stepped off as rapidly and strangely in the
opposite direction. Brown cliffs with deep green lakes in the
hollows, flat, blade-like trees that waved from root to tip, round
boulders of grey stone, vast crumpled surfaces of a thin crackling
texture&mdash;all these objects lay across the snail's progress
between one stalk and another to his goal. Before he had decided
whether to circumvent the arched tent of a dead leaf or to breast
it there came past the bed the feet of other human beings.</p>

<p>This time they were both men. The younger of the two wore an
expression of perhaps unnatural calm; he raised his eyes and fixed
them very steadily in front of him while his companion spoke, and
directly his companion had done speaking he looked on the ground
again and sometimes opened his lips only after a long pause and
sometimes did not open them at all. The elder man had a curiously
uneven and shaky method of walking, jerking his hand forward and
throwing up his head abruptly, rather in the manner of an impatient
carriage horse tired of waiting outside a house; but in the man
these gestures were irresolute and pointless. He talked almost
incessantly; he smiled to himself and again began to talk, as if
the smile had been an answer. He was talking about
spirits&mdash;the spirits of the dead, who, according to him, were
even now telling him all sorts of odd things about their
experiences in Heaven.</p>

<p>"Heaven was known to the ancients as Thessaly, William, and now,
with this war, the spirit matter is rolling between the hills like
thunder." He paused, seemed to listen, smiled, jerked his head and
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have a small electric battery and a piece of rubber to
insulate the wire&mdash;isolate?&mdash;insulate?&mdash;well, we'll
skip the details, no good going into details that wouldn't be
understood&mdash;and in short the little machine stands in any
convenient position by the head of the bed, we will say, on a neat
mahogany stand. All arrangements being properly fixed by workmen
under my direction, the widow applies her ear and summons the
spirit by sign as agreed. Women! Widows! Women in black&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he seemed to have caught sight of a woman's dress in the
distance, which in the shade looked a purple black. He took off his
hat, placed his hand upon his heart, and hurried towards her
muttering and gesticulating feverishly. But William caught him by
the sleeve and touched a flower with the tip of his walking-stick
in order to divert the old man's attention. After looking at it for
a moment in some confusion the old man bent his ear to it and
seemed to answer a voice speaking from it, for he began talking
about the forests of Uruguay which he had visited hundreds of years
ago in company with the most beautiful young woman in Europe. He
could be heard murmuring about forests of Uruguay blanketed with
the wax petals of tropical roses, nightingales, sea beaches,
mermaids, and women drowned at sea, as he suffered himself to be
moved on by William, upon whose face the look of stoical patience
grew slowly deeper and deeper.</p>

<p>Following his steps so closely as to be slightly puzzled by his
gestures came two elderly women of the lower middle class, one
stout and ponderous, the other rosy cheeked and nimble. Like most
people of their station they were frankly fascinated by any signs
of eccentricity betokening a disordered brain, especially in the
well-to-do; but they were too far off to be certain whether the
gestures were merely eccentric or genuinely mad. After they had
scrutinised the old man's back in silence for a moment and given
each other a queer, sly look, they went on energetically piecing
together their very complicated dialogue:</p>

<p>"Nell, Bert, Lot, Cess, Phil, Pa, he says, I says, she says, I
says, I says, I says&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My Bert, Sis, Bill, Grandad, the old man, sugar, Sugar, flour,
kippers, greens, Sugar, sugar, sugar."</p>

<p>The ponderous woman looked through the pattern of falling words
at the flowers standing cool, firm, and upright in the earth, with
a curious expression. She saw them as a sleeper waking from a heavy
sleep sees a brass candlestick reflecting the light in an
unfamiliar way, and closes his eyes and opens them, and seeing the
brass candlestick again, finally starts broad awake and stares at
the candlestick with all his powers. So the heavy woman came to a
standstill opposite the oval-shaped flower bed, and ceased even to
pretend to listen to what the other woman was saying. She stood
there letting the words fall over her, swaying the top part of her
body slowly backwards and forwards, looking at the flowers. Then
she suggested that they should find a seat and have their tea.</p>

<p>The snail had now considered every possible method of reaching
his goal without going round the dead leaf or climbing over it. Let
alone the effort needed for climbing a leaf, he was doubtful
whether the thin texture which vibrated with such an alarming
crackle when touched even by the tip of his horns would bear his
weight; and this determined him finally to creep beneath it, for
there was a point where the leaf curved high enough from the ground
to admit him. He had just inserted his head in the opening and was
taking stock of the high brown roof and was getting used to the
cool brown light when two other people came past outside on the
turf. This time they were both young, a young man and a young
woman. They were both in the prime of youth, or even in that season
which precedes the prime of youth, the season before the smooth
pink folds of the flower have burst their gummy case, when the
wings of the butterfly, though fully grown, are motionless in the
sun.</p>

<p>"Lucky it isn't Friday," he observed.</p>

<p>"Why? D'you believe in luck?"</p>

<p>"They make you pay sixpence on Friday."</p>

<p>"What's sixpence anyway? Isn't it worth sixpence?"</p>

<p>"What's 'it'&mdash;what do you mean by 'it'?"</p>

<p>"O, anything&mdash;I mean&mdash;you know what I mean."</p>

<p>Long pauses came between each of these remarks; they were
uttered in toneless and monotonous voices. The couple stood still
on the edge of the flower bed, and together pressed the end of her
parasol deep down into the soft earth. The action and the fact that
his hand rested on the top of hers expressed their feelings in a
strange way, as these short insignificant words also expressed
something, words with short wings for their heavy body of meaning,
inadequate to carry them far and thus alighting awkwardly upon the
very common objects that surrounded them, and were to their
inexperienced touch so massive; but who knows (so they thought as
they pressed the parasol into the earth) what precipices aren't
concealed in them, or what slopes of ice don't shine in the sun on
the other side? Who knows? Who has ever seen this before? Even when
she wondered what sort of tea they gave you at Kew, he felt that
something loomed up behind her words, and stood vast and solid
behind them; and the mist very slowly rose and uncovered&mdash;O,
Heavens, what were those shapes?&mdash;little white tables, and
waitresses who looked first at her and then at him; and there was a
bill that he would pay with a real two shilling piece, and it was
real, all real, he assured himself, fingering the coin in his
pocket, real to everyone except to him and to her; even to him it
began to seem real; and then&mdash;but it was too exciting to stand
and think any longer, and he pulled the parasol out of the earth
with a jerk and was impatient to find the place where one had tea
with other people, like other people.</p>

<p>"Come along, Trissie; it's time we had our tea."</p>

<p>"Wherever <i>does</i> one have one's tea?" she asked with the
oddest thrill of excitement in her voice, looking vaguely round and
letting herself be drawn on down the grass path, trailing her
parasol, turning her head this way and that way, forgetting her
tea, wishing to go down there and then down there, remembering
orchids and cranes among wild flowers, a Chinese pagoda and a
crimson crested bird; but he bore her on.</p>

<p>Thus one couple after another with much the same irregular and
aimless movement passed the flower-bed and were enveloped in layer
after layer of green blue vapour, in which at first their bodies
had substance and a dash of colour, but later both substance and
colour dissolved in the green-blue atmosphere. How hot it was! So
hot that even the thrush chose to hop, like a mechanical bird, in
the shadow of the flowers, with long pauses between one movement
and the next; instead of rambling vaguely the white butterflies
danced one above another, making with their white shifting flakes
the outline of a shattered marble column above the tallest flowers
the glass roofs of the palm house shone as if a whole market full
of shiny green umbrellas had opened in the sun; and in the drone of
the aeroplane the voice of the summer sky murmured its fierce soul.
Yellow and black, pink and snow white, shapes of all these colours,
men, women, and children were spotted for a second upon the
horizon, and then, seeing the breadth of yellow that lay upon the
grass, they wavered and sought shade beneath the trees, dissolving
like drops of water in the yellow and green atmosphere, staining it
faintly with red and blue. It seemed as if all gross and heavy
bodies had sunk down in the heat motionless and lay huddled upon
the ground, but their voices went wavering from them as if they
were flames lolling from the thick waxen bodies of candles. Voices.
Yes, voices. Wordless voices, breaking the silence suddenly with
such depth of contentment, such passion of desire, or, in the
voices of children, such freshness of surprise; breaking the
silence? But there was no silence; all the time the motor omnibuses
were turning their wheels and changing their gear; like a vast nest
of Chinese boxes all of wrought steel turning ceaselessly one
within another the city murmured; on the top of which the voices
cried aloud and the petals of myriads of flowers flashed their
colours into the air.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>SOLID OBJECTS</h2>

<p>The only thing that moved upon the vast semicircle of the beach
was one small black spot. As it came nearer to the ribs and spine
of the stranded pilchard boat, it became apparent from a certain
tenuity in its blackness that this spot possessed four legs; and
moment by moment it became more unmistakable that it was composed
of the persons of two young men. Even thus in outline against the
sand there was an unmistakable vitality in them; an indescribable
vigour in the approach and withdrawal of the bodies, slight though
it was, which proclaimed some violent argument issuing from the
tiny mouths of the little round heads. This was corroborated on
closer view by the repeated lunging of a walking-stick on the
right-hand side. "You mean to tell me...You actually believe..."
thus the walkingstick on the right-hand side next the waves seemed
to be asserting as it cut long straight stripes upon the sand.</p>

<p>"Politics be damned!" issued clearly from the body on the
left-hand side, and, as these words were uttered, the mouths,
noses, chins, little moustaches, tweed caps, rough boots, shooting
coats, and check stockings of the two speakers became clearer and
clearer; the smoke of their pipes went up into the air; nothing was
so solid, so living, so hard, red, hirsute and virile as these two
bodies for miles and miles of sea and sandhill.</p>

<p>They flung themselves down by the six ribs and spine of the
black pilchard boat. You know how the body seems to shake itself
free from an argument, and to apologize for a mood of exaltation;
flinging itself down and expressing in the looseness of its
attitude a readiness to take up with something new&mdash;whatever
it may be that comes next to hand. So Charles, whose stick had been
slashing the beach for half a mile or so, began skimming flat
pieces of slate over the water; and John, who had exclaimed
"Politics be damned!" began burrowing his fingers down, down, into
the sand. As his hand went further and further beyond the wrist, so
that he had to hitch his sleeve a little higher, his eyes lost
their intensity, or rather the background of thought and experience
which gives an inscrutable depth to the eyes of grown people
disappeared, leaving only the clear transparent surface, expressing
nothing but wonder, which the eyes of young children display. No
doubt the act of burrowing in the sand had something to do with it.
He remembered that, after digging for a little, the water oozes
round your finger-tips; the hole then becomes a moat; a well; a
spring; a secret channel to the sea. As he was choosing which of
these things to make it, still working his fingers in the water,
they curled round something hard&mdash;a full drop of solid
matter&mdash;and gradually dislodged a large irregular lump, and
brought it to the surface. When the sand coating was wiped off, a
green tint appeared. It was a lump of glass, so thick as to be
almost opaque; the smoothing of the sea had completely worn off any
edge or shape, so that it was impossible to say whether it had been
bottle, tumbler or window-pane; it was nothing but glass; it was
almost a precious stone. You had only to enclose it in a rim of
gold, or pierce it with a wire, and it became a jewel; part of a
necklace, or a dull, green light upon a finger. Perhaps after all
it was really a gem; something worn by a dark Princess trailing her
finger in the water as she sat in the stern of the boat and
listened to the slaves singing as they rowed her across the Bay. Or
the oak sides of a sunk Elizabethan treasure-chest had split apart,
and, rolled over and over, over and over, its emeralds had come at
last to shore. John turned it in his hands; he held it to the
light; he held it so that its irregular mass blotted out the body
and extended right arm of his friend. The green thinned and
thickened slightly as it was held against the sky or against the
body. It pleased him; it puzzled him; it was so hard, so
concentrated, so definite an object compared with the vague sea and
the hazy shore.</p>

<p>Now a sigh disturbed him&mdash;profound, final, making him aware
that his friend Charles had thrown all the flat stones within
reach, or had come to the conclusion that it was not worth while to
throw them. They ate their sandwiches side by side. When they had
done, and were shaking themselves and rising to their feet, John
took the lump of glass and looked at it in silence. Charles looked
at it too. But he saw immediately that it was not flat, and filling
his pipe he said with the energy that dismisses a foolish strain of
thought:</p>

<p>"To return to what I was saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not see, or if he had seen would hardly have noticed,
that John, after looking at the lump for a moment, as if in
hesitation, slipped it inside his pocket. That impulse, too, may
have been the impulse which leads a child to pick up one pebble on
a path strewn with them, promising it a life of warmth and security
upon the nursery mantelpiece, delighting in the sense of power and
benignity which such an action confers, and believing that the
heart of the stone leaps with joy when it sees itself chosen from a
million like it, to enjoy this bliss instead of a life of cold and
wet upon the high road. "It might so easily have been any other of
the millions of stones, but it was I, I, I!"</p>

<p>Whether this thought or not was in John's mind, the lump of
glass had its place upon the mantelpiece, where it stood heavy upon
a little pile of bills and letters and served not only as an
excellent paper-weight, but also as a natural stopping place for
the young man's eyes when they wandered from his book. Looked at
again and again half consciously by a mind thinking of something
else, any object mixes itself so profoundly with the stuff of
thought that it loses its actual form and recomposes itself a
little differently in an ideal shape which haunts the brain when we
least expect it. So John found himself attracted to the windows of
curiosity shops when he was out walking, merely because he saw
something which reminded him of the lump of glass. Anything, so
long as it was an object of some kind, more or less round, perhaps
with a dying flame deep sunk in its mass, anything&mdash;china,
glass, amber, rock, marble&mdash;even the smooth oval egg of a
prehistoric bird would do. He took, also, to keeping his eyes upon
the ground, especially in the neighbourhood of waste land where the
household refuse is thrown away. Such objects often occurred
there&mdash;thrown away, of no use to anybody, shapeless,
discarded. In a few months he had collected four or five specimens
that took their place upon the mantelpiece. They were useful, too,
for a man who is standing for Parliament upon the brink of a
brilliant career has any number of papers to keep in
order&mdash;addresses to constituents, declarations of policy,
appeals for subscriptions, invitations to dinner, and so on.</p>

<p>One day, starting from his rooms in the Temple to catch a train
in order to address his constituents, his eyes rested upon a
remarkable object lying half-hidden in one of those little borders
of grass which edge the bases of vast legal buildings. He could
only touch it with the point of his stick through the railings; but
he could see that it was a piece of china of the most remarkable
shape, as nearly resembling a starfish as anything&mdash;shaped, or
broken accidentally, into five irregular but unmistakable points.
The colouring was mainly blue, but green stripes or spots of some
kind overlaid the blue, and lines of crimson gave it a richness and
lustre of the most attractive kind. John was determined to possess
it; but the more he pushed, the further it receded. At length he
was forced to go back to his rooms and improvise a wire ring
attached to the end of a stick, with which, by dint of great care
and skill, he finally drew the piece of china within reach of his
hands. As he seized hold of it he exclaimed in triumph. At that
moment the clock struck. It was out of the question that he should
keep his appointment. The meeting was held without him. But how had
the piece of china been broken into this remarkable shape? A
careful examination put it beyond doubt that the star shape was
accidental, which made it all the more strange, and it seemed
unlikely that there should be another such in existence. Set at the
opposite end of the mantelpiece from the lump of glass that had
been dug from the sand, it looked like a creature from another
world&mdash;freakish and fantastic as a harlequin. It seemed to be
pirouetting through space, winking light like a fitful star. The
contrast between the china so vivid and alert, and the glass so
mute and contemplative, fascinated him, and wondering and amazed he
asked himself how the two came to exist in the same world, let
alone to stand upon the same narrow strip of marble in the same
room. The question remained unanswered.</p>

<p>He now began to haunt the places which are most prolific of
broken china, such as pieces of waste land between railway lines,
sites of demolished houses, and commons in the neighbourhood of
London. But china is seldom thrown from a great height; it is one
of the rarest of human actions. You have to find in conjunction a
very high house, and a woman of such reckless impulse and
passionate prejudice that she flings her jar or pot straight from
the window without thought of who is below. Broken china was to be
found in plenty, but broken in some trifling domestic accident,
without purpose or character. Nevertheless, he was often astonished
as he came to go into the question more deeply, by the immense
variety of shapes to be found in London alone, and there was still
more cause for wonder and speculation in the differences of
qualities and designs. The finest specimens he would bring home and
place upon his mantelpiece, where, however, their duty was more and
more of an ornamental nature, since papers needing a weight to keep
them down became scarcer and scarcer.</p>

<p>He neglected his duties, perhaps, or discharged them
absent-mindedly, or his constituents when they visited him were
unfavourably impressed by the appearance of his mantelpiece. At any
rate he was not elected to represent them in Parliament, and his
friend Charles, taking it much to heart and hurrying to condole
with him, found him so little cast down by the disaster that he
could only suppose that it was too serious a matter for him to
realize all at once.</p>

<p>In truth, John had been that day to Barnes Common, and there
under a furze bush had found a very remarkable piece of iron. It
was almost identical with the glass in shape, massy and globular,
but so cold and heavy, so black and metallic, that it was evidently
alien to the earth and had its origin in one of the dead stars or
was itself the cinder of a moon. It weighed his pocket down; it
weighed the mantelpiece down; it radiated cold. And yet the
meteorite stood upon the same ledge with the lump of glass and the
star-shaped china.</p>

<p>As his eyes passed from one to another, the determination to
possess objects that even surpassed these tormented the young man.
He devoted himself more and more resolutely to the search. If he
had not been consumed by ambition and convinced that one day some
newly-discovered rubbish heap would reward him, the disappointments
he had suffered, let alone the fatigue and derision, would have
made him give up the pursuit. Provided with a bag and a long stick
fitted with an adaptable hook, he ransacked all deposits of earth;
raked beneath matted tangles of scrub; searched all alleys and
spaces between walls where he had learned to expect to find objects
of this kind thrown away. As his standard became higher and his
taste more severe the disappointments were innumerable, but always
some gleam of hope, some piece of china or glass curiously marked
or broken lured him on. Day after day passed. He was no longer
young. His career&mdash;that is his political career&mdash;was a
thing of the past. People gave up visiting him. He was too silent
to be worth asking to dinner. He never talked to anyone about his
serious ambitions; their lack of understanding was apparent in
their behaviour.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair now and watched Charles lift the
stones on the mantelpiece a dozen times and put them down
emphatically to mark what he was saying about the conduct of the
Government, without once noticing their existence.</p>

<p>"What was the truth of it, John?" asked Charles suddenly,
turning and facing him. "What made you give it up like that all in
a second?"</p>

<p>"I've not given it up," John replied.</p>

<p>"But you've not the ghost of a chance now," said Charles
roughly.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you there," said John with conviction.
Charles looked at him and was profoundly uneasy; the most
extraordinary doubts possessed him; he had a queer sense that they
were talking about different things. He looked round to find some
relief for his horrible depression, but the disorderly appearance
of the room depressed him still further. What was that stick, and
the old carpet bag hanging against the wall? And then those stones?
Looking at John, something fixed and distant in his expression
alarmed him. He knew only too well that his mere appearance upon a
platform was out of the question.</p>

<p>"Pretty stones," he said as cheerfully as he could; and saying
that he had an appointment to keep, he left John&mdash;for
ever.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>AN UNWRITTEN NOVEL</h2>

<p>Such an expression of unhappiness was enough by itself to make
one's eyes slide above the paper's edge to the poor woman's
face&mdash;insignificant without that look, almost a symbol of
human destiny with it. Life's what you see in people's eyes; life's
what they learn, and, having learnt it, never, though they seek to
hide it, cease to be aware of&mdash;what? That life's like that, it
seems. Five faces opposite&mdash;five mature faces&mdash;and the
knowledge in each face. Strange, though, how people want to conceal
it! Marks of reticence are on all those faces: lips shut, eyes
shaded, each one of the five doing something to hide or stultify
his knowledge. One smokes; another reads; a third checks entries in
a pocket book; a fourth stares at the map of the line framed
opposite; and the fifth&mdash;the terrible thing about the fifth is
that she does nothing at all. She looks at life. Ah, but my poor,
unfortunate woman, do play the game&mdash;do, for all our sakes,
conceal it!</p>

<p>As if she heard me, she looked up, shifted slightly in her seat
and sighed. She seemed to apologise and at the same time to say to
me, "If only you knew!" Then she looked at life again. "But I do
know," I answered silently, glancing at the <i>Times</i> for
manners' sake. "I know the whole business. 'Peace between Germany
and the Allied Powers was yesterday officially ushered in at
Paris&mdash;Signor Nitti, the Italian Prime Minister&mdash;a
passenger train at Doncaster was in collision with a goods
train...' We all know&mdash;the <i>Times</i> knows&mdash;but we
pretend we don't." My eyes had once more crept over the paper's rim
She shuddered, twitched her arm queerly to the middle of her back
and shook her head. Again I dipped into my great reservoir of life.
"Take what you like," I continued, "births, deaths, marriages,
Court Circular, the habits of birds, Leonardo da Vinci, the
Sandhills murder, high wages and the cost of living&mdash;oh, take
what you like," I repeated, "it's all in the <i>Times</i>!" Again
with infinite weariness she moved her head from side to side until,
like a top exhausted with spinning, it settled on her neck.</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> was no protection against such sorrow as hers.
But other human beings forbade intercourse. The best thing to do
against life was to fold the paper so that it made a perfect
square, crisp, thick, impervious even to life. This done, I glanced
up quickly, armed with a shield of my own. She pierced through my
shield; she gazed into my eyes as if searching any sediment of
courage at the depths of them and damping it to clay. Her twitch
alone denied all hope, discounted all illusion.</p>

<p>So we rattled through Surrey and across the border into Sussex.
But with my eyes upon life I did not see that the other travellers
had left, one by one, till, save for the man who read, we were
alone together. Here was Three Bridges station. We drew slowly down
the platform and stopped. Was he going to leave us? I prayed both
ways&mdash;I prayed last that he might stay. At that instant he
roused himself, crumpled his paper contemptuously, like a thing
done with, burst open the door, and left us alone.</p>

<p>The unhappy woman, leaning a little forward, palely and
colourlessly addressed me&mdash;talked of stations and holidays, of
brothers at Eastbourne, and the time of year, which was, I forget
now, early or late. But at last looking from the window and seeing,
I knew, only life, she breathed, "Staying away&mdash;that's the
drawback of it&mdash;" Ah, now we approached the catastrophe, "My
sister-in-law"&mdash;the bitterness of her tone was like lemon on
cold steel, and speaking, not to me, but to herself, she muttered,
"nonsense, she would say&mdash;that's what they all say," and while
she spoke she fidgeted as though the skin on her back were as a
plucked fowl's in a poulterer's shop-window.</p>

<p>"Oh, that cow!" she broke off nervously, as though the great
wooden cow in the meadow had shocked her and saved her from some
indiscretion. Then she shuddered, and then she made the awkward
angular movement that I had seen before, as if, after the spasm,
some spot between the shoulders burnt or itched. Then again she
looked the most unhappy woman in the world, and I once more
reproached her, though not with the same conviction, for if there
were a reason, and if I knew the reason, the stigma was removed
from life.</p>

<p>"Sisters-in-law," I said&mdash;</p>

<p>Her lips pursed as if to spit venom at the word; pursed they
remained. All she did was to take her glove and rub hard at a spot
on the window-pane. She rubbed as if she would rub something out
for ever&mdash;some stain, some indelible contamination. Indeed,
the spot remained for all her rubbing, and back she sank with the
shudder and the clutch of the arm I had come to expect. Something
impelled me to take my glove and rub my window. There, too, was a
little speck on the glass. For all my rubbing it remained. And then
the spasm went through me I crooked my arm and plucked at the
middle of my back. My skin, too, felt like the damp chicken's skin
in the poulterer's shop-window; one spot between the shoulders
itched and irritated, felt clammy, felt raw. Could I reach it?
Surreptitiously I tried. She saw me. A smile of infinite irony,
infinite sorrow, flitted and faded from her face. But she had
communicated, shared her secret, passed her poison she would speak
no more. Leaning back in my corner, shielding my eyes from her
eyes, seeing only the slopes and hollows, greys and purples, of the
winter's landscape, I read her message, deciphered her secret,
reading it beneath her gaze.</p>

<p>Hilda's the sister-in-law. Hilda? Hilda? Hilda Marsh&mdash;Hilda
the blooming, the full bosomed, the matronly. Hilda stands at the
door as the cab draws up, holding a coin. "Poor Minnie, more of a
grasshopper than ever&mdash;old cloak she had last year. Well,
well, with too children these days one can't do more. No, Minnie,
I've got it; here you are, cabby&mdash;none of your ways with me.
Come in, Minnie. Oh, I could carry <i>you</i>, let alone your
basket!" So they go into the dining-room. "Aunt Minnie,
children."</p>

<p>Slowly the knives and forks sink from the upright. Down they get
(Bob and Barbara), hold out hands stiffly; back again to their
chairs, staring between the resumed mouthfuls. [But this we'll
skip; ornaments, curtains, trefoil china plate, yellow oblongs of
cheese, white squares of biscuit&mdash;skip&mdash;oh, but wait!
Half-way through luncheon one of those shivers; Bob stares at her,
spoon in mouth. "Get on with your pudding, Bob;" but Hilda
disapproves. "Why <i>should</i> she twitch?" Skip, skip, till we
reach the landing on the upper floor; stairs brass-bound; linoleum
worn; oh, yes! little bedroom looking out over the roofs of
Eastbourne&mdash;zigzagging roofs like the spines of caterpillars,
this way, that way, striped red and yellow, with blue-black
slating]. Now, Minnie, the door's shut; Hilda heavily descends to
the basement; you unstrap the straps of your basket, lay on the bed
a meagre nightgown, stand side by side furred felt slippers. The
looking-glass&mdash;no, you avoid the looking-glass. Some
methodical disposition of hat-pins. Perhaps the shell box has
something in it? You shake it; it's the pearl stud there was last
year&mdash;that's all. And then the sniff, the sigh, the sitting by
the window. Three o'clock on a December afternoon; the rain
drizzling; one light low in the skylight of a drapery emporium;
another high in a servant's bedroom&mdash;this one goes out. That
gives her nothing to look at. A moment's blankness&mdash;then, what
are you thinking? (Let me peep across at her opposite; she's asleep
or pretending it; so what would she think about sitting at the
window at three o'clock in the afternoon? Health, money, bills, her
God?) Yes, sitting on the very edge of the chair looking over the
roofs of Eastbourne, Minnie Marsh prays to Gods. That's all very
well; and she may rub the pane too, as though to see God better;
but what God does she see? Who's the God of Minnie Marsh, the God
of the back streets of Eastbourne, the God of three o'clock in the
afternoon? I, too, see roofs, I see sky; but, oh, dear&mdash;this
seeing of Gods! More like President Kruger than Prince
Albert&mdash;that's the best I can do for him; and I see him on a
chair, in a black frock-coat, not so very high up either; I can
manage a cloud or two for him to sit on; and then his hand trailing
in the cloud holds a rod, a truncheon is it?&mdash;black, thick,
thorned&mdash;a brutal old bully&mdash;Minnie's God! Did he send
the itch and the patch and the twitch? Is that why she prays? What
she rubs on the window is the stain of sin. Oh, she committed some
crime!</p>

<p>I have my choice of crimes. The woods flit and fly&mdash;in
summer there are bluebells; in the opening there, when Spring
comes, primroses. A parting, was it, twenty years ago? Vows broken?
Not Minnie's!...She was faithful. How she nursed her mother! All
her savings on the tombstone&mdash; wreaths under
glass&mdash;daffodils in jars. But I'm off the track. A
crime...They would say she kept her sorrow, suppressed her
secret&mdash;her sex, they'd say&mdash;the scientific people. But
what flummery to saddle her with sex! No&mdash;more like this.
Passing down the streets of Croydon twenty years ago, the violet
loops of ribbon in the draper's window spangled in the electric
light catch her eye. She lingers&mdash;past six. Still by running
she can reach home. She pushes through the glass swing door. It's
sale-time. Shallow trays brim with ribbons. She pauses, pulls this,
fingers that with the raised roses on it&mdash;no need to choose,
no need to buy, and each tray with its surprises. "We don't shut
till seven," and then it is seven. She runs, she rushes, home she
reaches, but too late. Neighbours&mdash;the doctor&mdash;baby
brother&mdash;the kettle&mdash;scalded&mdash;hospital&mdash;
dead&mdash;or only the shock of it, the blame? Ah, but the detail
matters nothing! It's what she carries with her; the spot, the
crime, the thing to expiate, always there between her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Yes," she seems to nod to me, "it's the thing I did."</p>

<p>Whether you did, or what you did, I don't mind; it's not the
thing I want. The draper's window looped with violet&mdash;that'll
do; a little cheap perhaps, a little commonplace&mdash;since one
has a choice of crimes, but then so many (let me peep across
again&mdash;still sleeping, or pretending sleep! white, worn, the
mouth closed&mdash;a touch of obstinacy, more than one would
think&mdash;no hint of sex)&mdash;so many crimes aren't your crime;
your crime was cheap; only the retribution solemn; for now the
church door opens, the hard wooden pew receives her; on the brown
tiles she kneels; every day, winter, summer, dusk, dawn (here she's
at it) prays. All her sins fall, fall, for ever fall. The spot
receives them. It's raised, it's red, it's burning. Next she
twitches. Small boys point. "Bob at lunch to-day"&mdash;But elderly
women are the worst.</p>

<p>Indeed now you can't sit praying any longer. Kruger's sunk
beneath the clouds&mdash;washed over as with a painter's brush of
liquid grey, to which he adds a tinge of black&mdash;even the tip
of the truncheon gone now. That's what always happens! Just as
you've seen him, felt him, someone interrupts. It's Hilda now.</p>

<p>How you hate her! She'll even lock the bathroom door overnight,
too, though it's only cold water you want, and sometimes when the
night's been bad it seems as if washing helped. And John at
breakfast&mdash;the children&mdash;meals are worst, and sometimes
there are friends&mdash;ferns don't altogether hide 'em&mdash;they
guess, too; so out you go along the front, where the waves are
grey, and the papers blow, and the glass shelters green and
draughty, and the chairs cost tuppence&mdash;too much&mdash;for
there must be preachers along the sands. Ah, that's a
nigger&mdash;that's a funny man&mdash;that's a man with
parakeets&mdash;poor little creatures! Is there no one here who
thinks of God?&mdash;just up there, over the pier, with his
rod&mdash;but no&mdash;there's nothing but grey in the sky or if
it's blue the white clouds hide him, and the music&mdash;it's
military music&mdash;and what they are fishing for? Do they catch
them? How the children stare! Well, then home a back
way&mdash;"Home a back way!" The words have meaning; might have
been spoken by the old man with whiskers&mdash;no, no, he didn't
really speak; but everything has meaning&mdash;placards leaning
against doorways&mdash;names above shop-windows&mdash;red fruit in
baskets&mdash;women's heads in the hairdresser's&mdash;all say
"Minnie Marsh!" But here's a jerk. "Eggs are cheaper!" That's what
always happens! I was heading her over the waterfall, straight for
madness, when, like a flock of dream sheep, she turns t'other way
and runs between my fingers. Eggs are cheaper. Tethered to the
shores of the world, none of the crimes, sorrows, rhapsodies, or
insanities for poor Minnie Marsh; never late for luncheon; never
caught in a storm without a mackintosh; never utterly unconscious
of the cheapness of eggs. So she reaches home&mdash;scrapes her
boots.</p>

<p>Have I read you right? But the human face&mdash;the human face
at the top of the fullest sheet of print holds more, withholds
more. Now, eyes open, she looks out; and in the human eye&mdash;how
d'you define it?&mdash;there's a break&mdash;a division&mdash;so
that when you've grasped the stem the butterfly's off&mdash;the
moth that hangs in the evening over the yellow flower&mdash;move,
raise your hand, off, high, away. I won't raise my hand. Hang
still, then, quiver, life, soul, spirit, whatever you are of Minnie
Marsh&mdash;I, too, on my flower&mdash;the hawk over the
down&mdash;alone, or what were the worth of life? To rise; hang
still in the evening, in the midday; hang still over the down. The
flicker of a hand&mdash;off, up! then poised again. Alone, unseen;
seeing all so still down there, all so lovely. None seeing, none
caring. The eyes of others our prisons; their thoughts our cages.
Air above, air below. And the moon and immortality...Oh, but I drop
to the turf! Are you down too, you in the corner, what's your
name&mdash;woman&mdash;Minnie Marsh; some such name as that? There
she is, tight to her blossom; opening her hand-bag, from which she
takes a hollow shell&mdash;an egg&mdash;who was saying that eggs
were cheaper? You or I? Oh, it was you who said it on the way home,
you remember, when the old gentleman, suddenly opening his
umbrella&mdash;or sneezing was it? Anyhow, Kruger went, and you
came "home a back way," and scraped your boots. Yes. And now you
lay across your knees a pocket-handkerchief into which drop little
angular fragments of eggshell&mdash;fragments of a map&mdash;a
puzzle. I wish I could piece them together! If you would only sit
still. She's moved her knees&mdash;the map's in bits again. Down
the slopes of the Andes the white blocks of marble go bounding and
hurtling, crushing to death a whole troop of Spanish muleteers,
with their convoy&mdash;Drake's booty, gold and silver. But to
return&mdash;</p>

<p>To what, to where? She opened the door, and, putting her
umbrella in the stand&mdash;that goes without saying; so, too, the
whiff of beef from the basement; dot, dot, dot. But what I cannot
thus eliminate, what I must, head down, eyes shut, with the courage
of a battalion and the blindness of a bull, charge and disperse
are, indubitably, the figures behind the ferns, commercial
travellers. There I've hidden them all this time in the hope that
somehow they'd disappear, or better still emerge, as indeed they
must, if the story's to go on gathering richness and rotundity,
destiny and tragedy, as stories should, rolling along with it two,
if not three, commercial travellers and a whole grove of
aspidistra. "The fronds of the aspidistra only partly concealed the
commercial traveller&mdash;" Rhododendrons would conceal him
utterly, and into the bargain give me my fling of red and white,
for which I starve and strive; but rhododendrons in
Eastbourne&mdash;in December&mdash;on the Marshes' table&mdash;no,
no, I dare not; it's all a matter of crusts and cruets, frills and
ferns. Perhaps there'll be a moment later by the sea. Moreover, I
feel, pleasantly pricking through the green fretwork and over the
glacis of cut glass, a desire to peer and peep at the man
opposite&mdash;one's as much as I can manage. James Moggridge is
it, whom the Marshes call Jimmy? [Minnie, you must promise not to
twitch till I've got this straight]. James Moggridge travels
in&mdash;shall we say buttons?&mdash;but the time's not come for
bringing them in&mdash;the big and the little on the long cards,
some peacock-eyed, others dull gold; cairngorms some, and others
coral sprays&mdash;but I say the time's not come. He travels, and
on Thursdays, his Eastbourne day, takes his meals with the Marshes.
His red face, his little steady eyes&mdash;by no means altogether
commonplace&mdash;his enormous appetite (that's safe; he won't look
at Minnie till the bread's swamped the gravy dry), napkin tucked
diamond-wise&mdash;but this is primitive, and, whatever it may do
the reader, don't take me in. Let's dodge to the Moggridge
household, set that in motion. Well, the family boots are mended on
Sundays by James himself. He reads Truth. But his passion?
Roses&mdash;and his wife a retired hospital
nurse&mdash;interesting&mdash;for God's sake let me have one woman
with a name I like! But no; she's of the unborn children of the
mind, illicit, none the less loved, like my rhododendrons. How many
die in every novel that's written&mdash;the best, the dearest,
while Moggridge lives. It's life's fault. Here's Minnie eating her
egg at the moment opposite and at t'other end of the line&mdash;are
we past Lewes?&mdash;there must be Jimmy&mdash;or what's her twitch
for?</p>

<p>There must be Moggridge&mdash;life's fault. Life imposes her
laws; life blocks the way; life's behind the fern; life's the
tyrant; oh, but not the bully! No, for I assure you I come
willingly; I come wooed by Heaven knows what compulsion across
ferns and cruets, table splashed and bottles smeared. I come
irresistibly to lodge myself somewhere on the firm flesh, in the
robust spine, wherever I can penetrate or find foothold on the
person, in the soul, of Moggridge the man. The enormous stability
of the fabric; the spine tough as whalebone, straight as oaktree;
the ribs radiating branches; the flesh taut tarpaulin; the red
hollows; the suck and regurgitation of the heart; while from above
meat falls in brown cubes and beer gushes to be churned to blood
again&mdash;and so we reach the eyes. Behind the aspidistra they
see something: black, white, dismal; now the plate again; behind
the aspidistra they see elderly woman; "Marsh's sister, Hilda's
more my sort;" the tablecloth now. "Marsh would know what's wrong
with Morrises..." talk that over; cheese has come; the plate again;
turn it round&mdash;the enormous fingers; now the woman opposite.
"Marsh's sister&mdash;not a bit like Marsh; wretched, elderly
female...You should feed your hens...God's truth, what's set her
twitching? Not what I said? Dear, dear, dear! these elderly women.
Dear, dear!"</p>

<p>[Yes, Minnie; I know you've twitched, but one moment&mdash;James
Moggridge].</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, dear!" How beautiful the sound is! like the knock
of a mallet on seasoned timber, like the throb of the heart of an
ancient whaler when the seas press thick and the green is clouded.
"Dear, dear!" what a passing bell for the souls of the fretful to
soothe them and solace them, lap them in linen, saying, "So long.
Good luck to you!" and then, "What's your pleasure?" for though
Moggridge would pluck his rose for her, that's done, that's over.
Now what's the next thing? "Madam, you'll miss your train," for
they don't linger.</p>

<p>That's the man's way; that's the sound that reverberates; that's
St. Paul's and the motor-omnibuses. But we're brushing the crumbs
off. Oh, Moggridge, you won't stay? You must be off? Are you
driving through Eastbourne this afternoon in one of those little
carriages? Are you man who's walled up in green cardboard boxes,
and sometimes has the blinds down, and sometimes sits so solemn
staring like a sphinx, and always there's a look of the sepulchral,
something of the undertaker, the coffin, and the dusk about horse
and driver? Do tell me&mdash;but the doors slammed. We shall never
meet again. Moggridge, farewell!</p>

<p>Yes, yes, I'm coming. Right up to the top of the house. One
moment I'll linger. How the mud goes round in the mind&mdash;what a
swirl these monsters leave, the waters rocking, the weeds waving
and green here, black there, striking to the sand, till by degrees
the atoms reassemble, the deposit sifts itself, and again through
the eyes one sees clear and still, and there comes to the lips some
prayer for the departed, some obsequy for the souls of those one
nods to, the people one never meets again.</p>

<p>James Moggridge is dead now, gone for ever. Well,
Minnie&mdash;"I can face it no longer." If she said that&mdash;(Let
me look at her. She is brushing the eggshell into deep
declivities). She said it certainly, leaning against the wall of
the bedroom, and plucking at the little balls which edge the
claret-coloured curtain. But when the self speaks to the self, who
is speaking?&mdash;the entombed soul, the spirit driven in, in, in
to the central catacomb; the self that took the veil and left the
world&mdash;a coward perhaps, yet somehow beautiful, as it flits
with its lantern restlessly up and down the dark corridors. "I can
bear it no longer," her spirit says. "That man at
lunch&mdash;Hilda&mdash;the children." Oh, heavens, her sob! It's
the spirit wailing its destiny, the spirit driven hither, thither,
lodging on the diminishing carpets&mdash;meagre
footholds&mdash;shrunken shreds of all the vanishing
universe&mdash;love, life, faith, husband, children, I know not
what splendours and pageantries glimpsed in girlhood. "Not for
me&mdash;not for me."</p>

<p>But then&mdash;the muffins, the bald elderly dog? Bead mats I
should fancy and the consolation of underlinen. If Minnie Marsh
were run over and taken to hospital, nurses and doctors themselves
would exclaim...There's the vista and the vision&mdash;there's the
distance&mdash;the blue blot at the end of the avenue, while, after
all, the tea is rich, the muffin hot, and the dog&mdash;"Benny, to
your basket, sir, and see what mother's brought you!" So, taking
the glove with the worn thumb, defying once more the encroaching
demon of what's called going in holes, you renew the
fortifications, threading the grey wool, running it in and out.</p>

<p>Running it in and out, across and over, spinning a web through
which God himself&mdash;hush, don't think of God! How firm the
stitches are! You must be proud of your darning. Let nothing
disturb her. Let the light fall gently, and the clouds show an
inner vest of the first green leaf. Let the sparrow perch on the
twig and shake the raindrop hanging to the twig's elbow...Why look
up? Was it a sound, a thought? Oh, heavens! Back again to the thing
you did, the plate glass with the violet loops? But Hilda will
come. Ignominies, humiliations, oh! Close the breach.</p>

<p>Having mended her glove, Minnie Marsh lays it in the drawer. She
shuts the drawer with decision. I catch sight of her face in the
glass. Lips are pursed. Chin held high. Next she laces her shoes.
Then she touches her throat. What's your brooch? Mistletoe or
merry-thought? And what is happening? Unless I'm much mistaken, the
pulse's quickened, the moment's coming, the threads are racing,
Niagara's ahead. Here's the crisis! Heaven be with you! Down she
goes. Courage, courage! Face it, be it! For God's sake don't wait
on the mat now! There's the door! I'm on your side. Speak! Confront
her, confound her soul!</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon! Yes, this is Eastbourne. I'll reach it
down for you. Let me try the handle." [But, Minnie, though we keep
up pretences, I've read you right&mdash;I'm with you now].</p>

<p>"That's all your luggage?"</p>

<p>"Much obliged, I'm sure."</p>

<p>(But why do you look about you? Hilda don't come to the station,
nor John; and Moggridge is driving at the far side of
Eastbourne).</p>

<p>"I'll wait by my bag, ma'am, that's safest. He said he'd meet
me...Oh, there he is! That's my son."</p>

<p>So they walk off together.</p>

<p>Well, but I'm confounded...Surely, Minnie, you know better! A
strange young man...Stop! I'll tell him&mdash;Minnie!&mdash;Miss
Marsh!&mdash;I don't know though. There's something queer in her
cloak as it blows. Oh, but it's untrue, it's indecent...Look how he
bends as they reach the gateway. She finds her ticket. What's the
joke? Off they go, down the road, side by side...Well, my world's
done for! What do I stand on? What do I know? That's not Minnie.
There never was Moggridge. Who am I? Life's bare as bone.</p>

<p>And yet the last look of them&mdash;he stepping from the kerb
and she following him round the edge of the big building brims me
with wonder&mdash;floods me anew. Mysterious figures! Mother and
son. Who are you? Why do you walk down the street? Where to-night
will you sleep, and then, to-morrow? Oh, how it whirls and
surges&mdash;floats me afresh! I start after them. People drive
this way and that. The white light splutters and pours. Plate-glass
windows. Carnations; chrysanthemums. Ivy in dark gardens. Milk
carts at the door. Wherever I go, mysterious figures, I see you,
turning the corner, mothers and sons; you, you, you. I hasten, I
follow. This, I fancy, must be the sea. Grey is the landscape; dim
as ashes; the water murmurs and moves. If I fall on my knees, if I
go through the ritual, the ancient antics, it's you, unknown
figures, you I adore; if I open my arms, it's you I embrace, you I
draw to me&mdash;adorable world!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>A HAUNTED HOUSE</h2>

<p>Whatever hour you woke there was a door shunting. From room to
room they went, hand in hand, lifting here, opening there, making
sure&mdash;a ghostly couple.</p>

<p>"Here we left it," she said. And he added:</p>

<p>"Oh, but here too!"</p>

<p>"It's upstairs," she murmured.</p>

<p>"And in the garden," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Quietly," they said, "or we shall wake them."</p>

<p>But it wasn't that you woke us. Oh, no. "They're looking for it;
they're drawing the curtain," one might say, and so read on a page
or two. "Now they've found it," one would be certain, stopping the
pencil on the margin. And then, tired of reading, one might rise
and see for oneself, the house all empty, the doors standing open,
only the wood pigeons bubbling with content and the hum of the
threshing machine sounding from the farm. "What did I come in here
for? What did I want to find?" My hands were empty. "Perhaps it's
upstairs then?" The apples were in the loft. And so down again, the
garden still as ever, only the book had slipped into the grass.</p>

<p>But they had found it in the drawing room. Not that one could
ever see them. The window panes reflected apples, reflected roses;
all the leaves were green in the glass. If they moved in the
drawing room, the apple only turned its yellow side. Yet, the
moment after, if the door was opened, spread about the floor, hung
upon the walls, pendant from the ceiling&mdash;what? My hands were
empty. The shadow of a thrush crossed the carpet; from the deepest
wells of silence the wood pigeon drew its bubble of sound. "Safe,
safe, safe," the pulse of the house beat softly. "The treasure
buried; the room..." the pulse stopped short. Oh, was that the
buried treasure?</p>

<p>A moment later the light had faded. Out in the garden then? But
the trees spun darkness for a wandering beam of sun. So fine, so
rare, coolly sunk beneath the surface the beam I sought always
burnt behind the glass. Death was the glass; death was between us;
coming to the woman first, hundreds of years ago, leaving the
house, sealing all the windows; the rooms were darkened. He left
it, left her, went North, went East, saw the stars turned in the
Southern sky; sought the house, found it dropped beneath the Downs.
"Safe, safe, safe," the pulse of the house beat gladly. "The
Treasure yours."</p>

<p>The wind roars up the avenue. Trees stoop and bend this way and
that. Moonbeams splash and spill wildly in the rain. But the beam
of the lamp falls straight from the window. The candle burns stiff
and still. Wandering through the house, opening the windows,
whispering not to wake us, the ghostly couple seek their joy.</p>

<p>"Here we slept," she says. And he adds, "Kisses without
number."</p>

<p>"Waking in the morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silver between the trees&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Upstairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the garden&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When summer came&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In winter snowtime&mdash;"</p>

<p>The doors go shutting far in the distance, gently knocking like
the pulse of a heart.</p>

<p>Nearer they come; cease at the doorway. The wind falls, the rain
slides silver down the glass. Our eyes darken; we hear no steps
beside us; we see no lady spread her ghostly cloak. His hands
shield the lantern. "Look," he breathes. "Sound asleep. Love upon
their lips."</p>

<p>Stooping, holding their silver lamp above us, long they look and
deeply. Long they pause. The wind drives straightly; the flame
stoops slightly. Wild beams of moonlight cross both floor and wall,
and, meeting, stain the faces bent; the faces pondering; the faces
that search the sleepers and seek their hidden joy.</p>

<p>"Safe, safe, safe," the heart of the house beats proudly.</p>

<p>"Long years&mdash;" he sighs. "Again you found me."</p>

<p>"Here," she murmurs, "sleeping; in the garden reading; laughing,
rolling apples in the loft. Here we left our treasure&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stooping, their light lifts the lids upon my eyes.</p>

<p>"Safe! safe! safe!" the pulse of the house beats wildly.</p>

<p>Waking, I cry, "Oh, is this your buried treasure? The light in
the heart."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>MONDAY OR TUESDAY</h2>

<p>Lazy and indifferent, shaking space easily from his wings,
knowing his way, the heron passes over the church beneath the sky.
White and distant, absorbed in itself, endlessly the sky covers and
uncovers, moves and remains. A lake? Blot the shores of it out! A
mountain? Oh, perfect&mdash;the sun gold on its slopes. Down that
falls. Ferns then, or white feathers, for ever and ever&mdash;</p>

<p>Desiring truth, awaiting it, laboriously distilling a few words,
for ever desiring&mdash;(a cry starts to the left, another to the
right. Wheels strike divergently. Omnibuses conglomerate in
conflict)&mdash;for ever desiring&mdash;(the clock asseverates with
twelve distinct strokes that it is midday; light sheds gold scales;
children swarm)&mdash;for ever desiring truth. Red is the dome;
coins hang on the trees; smoke trails from the chimneys; bark,
shout, cry "Iron for sale"&mdash;and truth?</p>

<p>Radiating to a point men's feet and women's feet, black or
gold-encrusted&mdash;(This foggy weather&mdash;Sugar? No, thank
you&mdash;The commonwealth of the future)&mdash;the firelight
darting and making the room red, save for the black figures and
their bright eyes, while outside a van discharges, Miss Thingummy
drinks tea at her desk, and plate-glass preserves fur
coats&mdash;</p>

<p>Flaunted, leaf&mdash;light, drifting at corners, blown across
the wheels, silver-splashed, home or not home, gathered, scattered,
squandered in separate scales, swept up, down, torn, sunk,
assembled&mdash;and truth?</p>

<p>Now to recollect by the fireside on the white square of marble.
From ivory depths words rising shed their blackness, blossom and
penetrate. Fallen the book; in the flame, in the smoke, in the
momentary sparks&mdash;or now voyaging, the marble square pendant,
minarets beneath and the Indian seas, while space rushes blue and
stars glint&mdash;truth? content with closeness?</p>

<p>Lazy and indifferent the heron returns; the sky veils her stars;
then bares them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>THE STRING QUARTET</h2>

<p>Well, here we are, and if you cast your eye over the room you
will see that Tubes and trams and omnibuses, private carriages not
a few, even, I venture to believe, landaus with bays in them, have
been busy at it, weaving threads from one end of London to the
other. Yet I begin to have my doubts&mdash;</p>

<p>If indeed it's true, as they're saying, that Regent Street is
up, and the Treaty signed, and the weather not cold for the time of
year, and even at that rent not a flat to be had, and the worst of
influenza its after effects; if I bethink me of having forgotten to
write about the leak in the larder, and left my glove in the train;
if the ties of blood require me, leaning forward, to accept
cordially the hand which is perhaps offered hesitatingly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Seven years since we met!"</p>

<p>"The last time in Venice."</p>

<p>"And where are you living now?"</p>

<p>"Well, the late afternoon suits me the best, though, if it
weren't asking too much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I knew you at once!"</p>

<p>"Still, the war made a break&mdash;"</p>

<p>If the mind's shot through by such little arrows, and&mdash;for
human society compels it&mdash;no sooner is one launched than
another presses forward; if this engenders heat and in addition
they've turned on the electric light; if saying one thing does, in
so many cases, leave behind it a need to improve and revise,
stirring besides regrets, pleasures, vanities, and desires&mdash;if
it's all the facts I mean, and the hats, the fur boas, the
gentlemen's swallow-tail coats, and pearl tie-pins that come to the
surface&mdash;what chance is there?</p>

<p>Of what? It becomes every minute more difficult to say why, in
spite of everything, I sit here believing I can't now say what, or
even remember the last time it happened.</p>

<p>"Did you see the procession?"</p>

<p>"The King looked cold."</p>

<p>"No, no, no. But what was it?"</p>

<p>"She's bought a house at Malmesbury."</p>

<p>"How lucky to find one!"</p>

<p>On the contrary, it seems to me pretty sure that she, whoever
she may be, is damned, since it's all a matter of flats and hats
and sea gulls, or so it seems to be for a hundred people sitting
here well dressed, walled in, furred, replete. Not that I can
boast, since I too sit passive on a gilt chair, only turning the
earth above a buried memory, as we all do, for there are signs, if
I'm not mistaken, that we're all recalling something, furtively
seeking something. Why fidget? Why so anxious about the sit of
cloaks; and gloves&mdash;whether to button or unbutton? Then watch
that elderly face against the dark canvas, a moment ago urbane and
flushed; now taciturn and sad, as if in shadow. Was it the sound of
the second violin tuning in the ante-room? Here they come; four
black figures, carrying instruments, and seat themselves facing the
white squares under the downpour of light; rest the tips of their
bows on the music stand; with a simultaneous movement lift them;
lightly poise them, and, looking across at the player opposite, the
first violin counts one, two, three&mdash;</p>

<p>Flourish, spring, burgeon, burst! The pear tree on the top of
the mountain. Fountains jet; drops descend. But the waters of the
Rhone flow swift and deep, race under the arches, and sweep the
trailing water leaves, washing shadows over the silver fish, the
spotted fish rushed down by the swift waters, now swept into an
eddy where&mdash;it's difficult this&mdash;conglomeration of fish
all in a pool; leaping, splashing, scraping sharp fins; and such a
boil of current that the yellow pebbles are churned round and
round, round and round&mdash;free now, rushing downwards, or even
somehow ascending in exquisite spirals into the air; curled like
thin shavings from under a plane; up and up...How lovely goodness
is in those who, stepping lightly, go smiling through the world!
Also in jolly old fishwives, squatted under arches, oh scene old
women, how deeply they laugh and shake and rollick, when they walk,
from side to side, hum, hah!</p>

<p>"That's an early Mozart, of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the tune, like all his tunes, makes one despair&mdash;I
mean hope. What do I mean? That's the worst of music! I want to
dance, laugh, eat pink cakes, yellow cakes, drink thin, sharp wine.
Or an indecent story, now&mdash;I could relish that. The older one
grows the more one likes indecency. Hall, hah! I'm laughing. What
at? You said nothing, nor did the old gentleman opposite...But
suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;Hush!"</p>

<p>The melancholy river bears us on. When the moon comes through
the trailing willow boughs, I see your face, I hear your voice and
the bird singing as we pass the osier bed. What are you whispering?
Sorrow, sorrow. Joy, joy. Woven together, like reeds in moonlight.
Woven together, inextricably commingled, bound in pain and strewn
in sorrow&mdash;crash!</p>

<p>The boat sinks. Rising, the figures ascend, but now leaf thin,
tapering to a dusky wraith, which, fiery tipped, draws its twofold
passion from my heart. For me it sings, unseals my sorrow, thaws
compassion, floods with love the sunless world, nor, ceasing,
abates its tenderness but deftly, subtly, weaves in and out until
in this pattern, this consummation, the cleft ones unify; soar,
sob, sink to rest, sorrow and joy.</p>

<p>Why then grieve? Ask what? Remain unsatisfied? I say all's been
settled; yes; laid to rest under a coverlet of rose leaves,
falling. Falling. Ah, but they cease. One rose leaf, falling from
an enormous height, like a little parachute dropped from an
invisible balloon, turns, flutters waveringly. It won't reach
us.</p>

<p>"No, no. I noticed nothing. That's the worst of
music&mdash;these silly dreams. The second violin was late, you
say?"</p>

<p>"There's old Mrs. Munro, feeling her way out&mdash;blinder each
year, poor woman&mdash;on this slippery floor."</p>

<p>Eyeless old age, grey-headed Sphinx...There she stands on the
pavement, beckoning, so sternly, the red omnibus.</p>

<p>"How lovely! How well they play! How&mdash;how&mdash;how!"</p>

<p>The tongue is but a clapper. Simplicity itself. The feathers in
the hat next me are bright and pleasing as a child's rattle. The
leaf on the plane-tree flashes green through the chink in the
curtain. Very strange, very exciting.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how&mdash;how!" Hush!</p>

<p>These are the lovers on the grass.</p>

<p>"If, madam, you will take my hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir, I would trust you with my heart. Moreover, we have left
our bodies in the banqueting hall. Those on the turf are the
shadows of our souls."</p>

<p>"Then these are the embraces of our souls." The lemons nod
assent. The swan pushes from the bank and floats dreaming into mid
stream.</p>

<p>"But to return. He followed me down the corridor, and, as we
turned the corner, trod on the lace of my petticoat. What could I
do but cry 'Ah!' and stop to finger it? At which he drew his sword,
made passes as if he were stabbing something to death, and cried,
'Mad! Mad! Mad!' Whereupon I screamed, and the Prince, who was
writing in the large vellum book in the oriel window, came out in
his velvet skull-cap and furred slippers, snatched a rapier from
the wall&mdash;the King of Spain's gift, you know&mdash;on which I
escaped, flinging on this cloak to hide the ravages to my
skirt&mdash;to hide...But listen! the horns!"</p>

<p>The gentleman replies so fast to the lady, and she runs up the
scale with such witty exchange of compliment now culminating in a
sob of passion, that the words are indistinguishable though the
meaning is plain enough&mdash;love, laughter, flight, pursuit,
celestial bliss&mdash;all floated out on the gayest ripple of
tender endearment&mdash;until the sound of the silver horns, at
first far distant, gradually sounds more and more distinctly, as if
seneschals were saluting the dawn or proclaiming ominously the
escape of the lovers...The green garden, moonlit pool, lemons,
lovers, and fish are all dissolved in the opal sky, across which,
as the horns are joined by trumpets and supported by clarions there
rise white arches firmly planted on marble pillars...Tramp and
trumpeting. Clang and clangour. Firm establishment. Fast
foundations. March of myriads. Confusion and chaos trod to earth.
But this city to which we travel has neither stone nor marble;
hangs enduring; stands unshakable; nor does a face, nor does a flag
greet or welcome. Leave then to perish your hope; droop in the
desert my joy; naked advance. Bare are the pillars; auspicious to
none; casting no shade; resplendent; severe. Back then I fall,
eager no more, desiring only to go, find the street, mark the
buildings, greet the applewoman, say to the maid who opens the
door: A starry night.</p>

<p>"Good night, good night. You go this way?"</p>

<p>"Alas. I go that."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>SOCIETY</h2>

<p>This is how it all came about. Six or seven of us were sitting
one day after tea. Some were gazing across the street into the
windows of a milliner's shop where the light still shone brightly
upon scarlet feathers and golden slippers. Others were idly
occupied in building little towers of sugar upon the edge of the
tea tray. After a time, so far as I can remember, we drew round the
fire and began as usual to praise men&mdash;how strong, how noble,
how brilliant, how courageous, how beautiful they were&mdash;how we
envied those who by hook or by crook managed to get attached to one
for life&mdash;when Poll, who had said nothing, burst into tears.
Poll, I must tell you, has always been queer. For one thing her
father was a strange man. He left her a fortune in his will, but on
condition that she read all the books in the London Library. We
comforted her as best we could; but we knew in our hearts how vain
it was. For though we like her, Poll is no beauty; leaves her shoe
laces untied; and must have been thinking, while we praised men,
that not one of them would ever wish to marry her. At last she
dried her tears. For some time we could make nothing of what she
said. Strange enough it was in all conscience. She told us that, as
we knew, she spent most of her time in the London Library, reading.
She had begun, she said, with English literature on the top floor;
and was steadily working her way down to the Times on the bottom.
And now half, or perhaps only a quarter, way through a terrible
thing had happened. She could read no more. Books were not what we
thought them. "Books," she cried, rising to her feet and speaking
with an intensity of desolation which I shall never forget, "are
for the most part unutterably bad!"</p>

<p>Of course we cried out that Shakespeare wrote books, and Milton
and Shelley.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she interrupted us. "You've been well taught, I can
see. But you are not members of the London Library." Here her sobs
broke forth anew. At length, recovering a little, she opened one of
the pile of books which she always carried about with
her&mdash;"From a Window" or "In a Garden," or some such name as
that it was called, and it was written by a man called Benton or
Henson, or something of that kind. She read the first few pages. We
listened in silence. "But that's not a book," someone said. So she
chose another. This time it was a history, but I have forgotten the
writer's name. Our trepidation increased as she went on. Not a word
of it seemed to be true, and the style in which it was written was
execrable.</p>

<p>"Poetry! Poetry!" we cried, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Read us poetry!" I cannot describe the desolation which fell
upon us as she opened a little volume and mouthed out the verbose,
sentimental foolery which it contained.</p>

<p>"It must have been written by a woman," one of us urged. But no.
She told us that it was written by a young man, one of the most
famous poets of the day. I leave you to imagine what the shock of
the discovery was. Though we all cried and begged her to read no
more, she persisted and read us extracts from the Lives of the Lord
Chancellors. When she had finished, Jane, the eldest and wisest of
us, rose to her feet and said that she for one was not
convinced.</p>

<p>"Why," she asked, "if men write such rubbish as this, should our
mothers have wasted their youth in bringing them into the
world?"</p>

<p>We were all silent; and, in the silence, poor Poll could be
heard sobbing out, "Why, why did my father teach me to read?"</p>

<p>Clorinda was the first to come to her senses. "It's all our
fault," she said. "Every one of us knows how to read. But no one,
save Poll, has ever taken the trouble to do it. I, for one, have
taken it for granted that it was a woman's duty to spend her youth
in bearing children. I venerated my mother for bearing ten; still
more my grandmother for bearing fifteen; it was, I confess, my own
ambition to bear twenty. We have gone on all these ages supposing
that men were equally industrious, and that their works were of
equal merit. While we have borne the children, they, we supposed,
have borne the books and the pictures. We have populated the world.
They have civilized it. But now that we can read, what prevents us
from judging the results? Before we bring another child into the
world we must swear that we will find out what the world is
like."</p>

<p>So we made ourselves into a society for asking questions. One of
us was to visit a man-of-war; another was to hide herself in a
scholar's study; another was to attend a meeting of business men;
while all were to read books, look at pictures, go to concerts,
keep our eyes open in the streets, and ask questions perpetually.
We were very young. You can judge of our simplicity when I tell you
that before parting that night we agreed that the objects of life
were to produce good people and good books. Our questions were to
be directed to finding out how far these objects were now attained
by men. We vowed solemnly that we would not bear a single child
until we were satisfied.</p>

<p>Off we went then, some to the British Museum; others to the
King's Navy; some to Oxford; others to Cambridge; we visited the
Royal Academy and the Tate; heard modern music in concert rooms,
went to the Law Courts, and saw new plays. No one dined out without
asking her partner certain questions and carefully noting his
replies. At intervals we met together and compared our
observations. Oh, those were merry meeting! Never have I laughed so
much as I did when Rose read her notes upon "Honour" and described
how she had dressed herself as an Ethiopian Prince and gone aboard
one of His Majesty's ships. Discovering the hoax, the Captain
visited her (now disguised as a private gentleman) and demanded
that honour should be satisfied.</p>

<p>"But how?" she asked.</p>

<p>"How?" he bellowed. "With the cane of course!"</p>

<p>Seeing that he was beside himself with rage and expecting that
her last moment had come, she bent over and received, to her
amazement, six light taps upon the behind.</p>

<p>"The honour of the British Navy is avenged!" he cried, and,
raising herself, she saw him with the sweat pouring down his face
holding out a trembling right hand.</p>

<p>"Away!" she exclaimed, striking an attitude and imitating the
ferocity of his own expression, "My honour has still to be
satisfied!"</p>

<p>"Spoken like a gentleman!" he returned, and fell into profound
thought.</p>

<p>"If six strokes avenge the honour of the King's Navy," he mused,
"how many avenge the honour of a private gentleman?"</p>

<p>He said he would prefer to lay the case before his brother
officers. She replied haughtily that she could not wait. He praised
her sensibility.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he cried suddenly, "did your father keep a
carriage?"</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>"Or a riding horse?"</p>

<p>"We had a donkey," she bethought her, "which drew the mowing
machine."</p>

<p>At this his face lighted.</p>

<p>"My mother's name&mdash;" she added.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, man, don't mention your mother's name!" he
shrieked, trembling like an aspen and flushing to the roots of his
hair, and it was ten minutes at least before she could induce him
to proceed. At length he decreed that if she gave him four strokes
and a half in the small of the back at a spot indicated by himself
(the half conceded, he said, in recognition of the fact that her
great grandmother's uncle was killed at Trafalgar) it was his
opinion that her honour would be as good as new. This was done;
they retired to a restaurant; drank two bottles of wine for which
he insisted upon paying; and parted with protestations of eternal
friendship.</p>

<p>Then we had Fanny's account of her visit to the Law Courts. At
her first visit she had come to the conclusion that the Judges were
either made of wood or were impersonated by large animals
resembling man who had been trained to move with extreme dignity,
mumble and nod their heads. To test her theory she had liberated a
handkerchief of bluebottles at the critical moment of a trial, but
was unable to judge whether the creatures gave signs of humanity
for the buzzing of the flies induced so sound a sleep that she only
woke in time to see the prisoners led into the cells below. But
from the evidence she brought we voted that it is unfair to suppose
that the Judges are men.</p>

<p>Helen went to the Royal Academy, but when asked to deliver her
report upon the pictures she began to recite from a pale blue
volume, "O! for the touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a
voice that is still. Home is the hunter, home from the hill. He
gave his bridle reins a shake. Love is sweet, love is brief.
Spring, the fair spring, is the year's pleasant King. O! to be in
England now that April's there. Men must work and women must weep.
The path of duty is the way to glory&mdash;" We could listen to no
more of this gibberish.</p>

<p>"We want no more poetry!" we cried.</p>

<p>"Daughters of England!" she began, but here we pulled her down,
a vase of water getting spilt over her in the scuffle.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" she exclaimed, shaking herself like a dog. "Now
I'll roll on the carpet and see if I can't brush off what remains
of the Union Jack. Then perhaps&mdash;" here she rolled
energetically. Getting up she began to explain to us what modern
pictures are like when Castalia stopped her.</p>

<p>"What is the average size of a picture?" she asked. "Perhaps two
feet by two and a half," she said. Castalia made notes while Helen
spoke, and when she had done, and we were trying not to meet each
other's eyes, rose and said, "At your wish I spent last week at
Oxbridge, disguised as a charwoman. I thus had access to the rooms
of several Professors and will now attempt to give you some
idea&mdash;only," she broke off, "I can't think how to do it. It's
all so queer. These Professors," she went on, "live in large houses
built round grass plots each in a kind of cell by himself. Yet they
have every convenience and comfort. You have only to press a button
or light a little lamp. Theirs papers are beautifully filed. Books
abound. There are no children or animals, save half a dozen stray
cats and one aged bullfinch&mdash;a cock. I remember," she broke
off, "an Aunt of mine who lived at Dulwich and kept cactuses. You
reached the conservatory through the double drawing-room, and
there, on the hot pipes, were dozens of them, ugly, squat, bristly
little plants each in a separate pot. Once in a hundred years the
Aloe flowered, so my Aunt said. But she died before that
happened&mdash;" We told her to keep to the point. "Well," she
resumed, "when Professor Hobkin was out, I examined his life work,
an edition of Sappho. It's a queer looking book, six or seven
inches thick, not all by Sappho. Oh, no. Most of it is a defence of
Sappho's chastity, which some German had denied, add I can assure
you the passion with which these two gentlemen argued, the learning
they displayed, the prodigious ingenuity with which they disputed
the use of some implement which looked to me for all the world like
a hairpin astounded me; especially when the door opened and
Professor Hobkin himself appeared. A very nice, mild, old
gentleman, but what could he know about chastity?" We misunderstood
her.</p>

<p>"No, no," she protested, "he's the soul of honour I'm
sure&mdash;not that he resembled Rose's sea captain in the least. I
was thinking rather of my Aunt's cactuses. What could they know
about chastity?"</p>

<p>Again we told her not to wander from the point,&mdash;did the
Oxbridge professors help to produce good people and good
books?&mdash;the objects of life.</p>

<p>"There!" she exclaimed. "It never struck me to ask. It never
occurred to me that they could possibly produce anything."</p>

<p>"I believe," said Sue, "that you made some mistake. Probably
Professor Hobkin was a gynecologist. A scholar is a very different
sort of man. A scholar is overflowing with humour and
invention&mdash;perhaps addicted to wine, but what of that?&mdash;a
delightful companion, generous, subtle, imaginative&mdash;as stands
to reason. For he spends his life in company with the finest human
beings that have ever existed."</p>

<p>"Hum," said Castalia. "Perhaps I'd better go back and try
again."</p>

<p>Some three months later it happened that I was sitting alone
when Castalia entered. I don't know what it was in the look of her
that so moved me; but I could not restrain myself, and, dashing
across the room, I clasped her in my arms. Not only was she very
beautiful; she seemed also in the highest spirits. "How happy you
look!" I exclaimed, as she sat down.</p>

<p>"I've been at Oxbridge," she said.</p>

<p>"Asking questions?"</p>

<p>"Answering them," she replied.</p>

<p>"You have not broken our vows?" I said anxiously, noticing
something about her figure.</p>

<p>"Oh, the vow," she said casually. "I'm going to have a baby, if
that's what you mean. You can't imagine," she burst out, "how
exciting, how beautiful, how satisfying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To&mdash;to&mdash;answer questions," she replied in some
confusion. Whereupon she told me the whole of her story. But in the
middle of an account which interested and excited me more than
anything I had ever heard, she gave the strangest cry, half whoop,
half holloa&mdash;</p>

<p>"Chastity! Chastity! Where's my chastity!" she cried. "Help Ho!
The scent bottle!"</p>

<p>There was nothing in the room but a cruet containing mustard,
which I was about to administer when she recovered her
composure.</p>

<p>"You should have thought of that three months ago," I said
severely.</p>

<p>"True," she replied. "There's not much good in thinking of it
now. It was unfortunate, by the way, that my mother had me called
Castalia."</p>

<p>"Oh, Castalia, your mother&mdash;" I was beginning when she
reached for the mustard pot.</p>

<p>"No, no, no," she said, shaking her head. "If you'd been a
chaste woman yourself you would have screamed at the sight of
me&mdash;instead of which you rushed across the room and took me in
your arms. No, Cassandra. We are neither of us chaste." So we went
on talking.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the room was filling up, for it was the day appointed
to discuss the results of our observations. Everyone, I thought,
felt as I did about Castalia. They kissed her and said how glad
they were to see her again. At length, when we were all assembled,
Jane rose and said that it was time to begin. She began by saying
that we had now asked questions for over five years, and that
though the results were bound to be inconclusive&mdash;here
Castalia nudged me and whispered that she was not so sure about
that. Then she got up, and, interrupting Jane in the middle of a
sentence, said:</p>

<p>"Before you say any more, I want to know&mdash;am I to stay in
the room? Because," she added, "I have to confess that I am an
impure woman."</p>

<p>Everyone looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>"You are going to have a baby?" asked Jane.</p>

<p>She nodded her head.</p>

<p>It was extraordinary to see the different expressions on their
faces. A sort of hum went through the room, in which I could catch
the words "impure," "baby," "Castalia," and so on. Jane, who was
herself considerably moved, put it to us:</p>

<p>"Shall she go? Is she impure?"</p>

<p>Such a roar filled the room as might have been heard in the
street outside.</p>

<p>"No! No! No! Let her stay! Impure? Fiddlesticks!" Yet I fancied
that some of the youngest, girls of nineteen or twenty, held back
as if overcome with shyness. Then we all came about her and began
asking questions, and at last I saw one of the youngest, who had
kept in the background, approach shyly and say to her:</p>

<p>"What is chastity then? I mean is it good, or is it bad, or is
it nothing at all?" She replied so low that I could not catch what
she said.</p>

<p>"You know I was shocked," said another, "for at least ten
minutes."</p>

<p>"In my opinion," said Poll, who was growing crusty from always
reading in the London Library, "chastity is nothing but
ignorance&mdash;a most discreditable state of mind. We should admit
only the unchaste to our society. I vote that Castalia shall be our
President."</p>

<p>This was violently disputed.</p>

<p>"It is as unfair to brand women with chastity as with
unchastity," said Poll. "Some of us haven't the opportunity either.
Moreover, I don't believe Cassy herself maintains that she acted as
she did from a pure love of knowledge."</p>

<p>"He is only twenty-one and divinely beautiful," said Cassy, with
a ravishing gesture.</p>

<p>"I move," said Helen, "that no one be allowed to talk of
chastity or unchastity save those who are in love."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother," said Judith, who had been enquiring into
scientific matters, "I'm not in love and I'm longing to explain my
measures for dispensing with prostitutes and fertilizing virgins by
Act of Parliament."</p>

<p>She went on to tell us of an invention of hers to be erected at
Tube stations and other public resorts, which, upon payment of a
small fee, would safeguard the nation's health, accommodate its
sons, and relieve its daughters. Then she had contrived a method of
preserving in sealed tubes the germs of future Lord Chancellors "or
poets or painters or musicians," she went on, "supposing, that is
to say, that these breeds are not extinct, and that women still
wish to bear children&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course we wish to bear children!" cried Castalia,
impatiently. Jane rapped the table.</p>

<p>"That is the very point we are met to consider," she said. "For
five years we have been trying to find out whether we are justified
in continuing the human race. Castalia has anticipated our
decision. But it remains for the rest of us to make up our
minds."</p>

<p>Here one after another of our messengers rose and delivered
their reports. The marvels of civilisation far exceeded our
expectations, and, as we learnt for the first time how man flies in
the air, talks across space, penetrates to the heart of an atom,
and embraces the universe in his speculations, a murmur of
admiration burst from our lips.</p>

<p>"We are proud," we cried, "that our mothers sacrificed their
youth in such a cause as this!" Castalia, who had been listening
intently, looked prouder than all the rest. Then Jane reminded us
that we had still much to learn, and Castalia begged us to make
haste. On we went through a vast tangle of statistics. We learnt
that England has a population of so many millions, and that such
and such a proportion of them is constantly hungry and in prison;
that the average size of a working man's family is such, and that
so great a percentage of women die from maladies incident to
childbirth. Reports were read of visits to factories, shops, slums,
and dockyards. Descriptions were given of the Stock Exchange, of a
gigantic house of business in the City, and of a Government Office.
The British Colonies were now discussed, and some account was given
of our rule in India, Africa and Ireland. I was sitting by Castalia
and I noticed her uneasiness.</p>

<p>"We shall never come to any conclusion at all at this rate," she
said. "As it appears that civilisation is so much more complex than
we had any notion, would it not be better to confine ourselves to
our original enquiry? We agreed that it was the object of life to
produce good people and good books. All this time we have been
talking of aeroplanes, factories, and money. Let us talk about men
themselves and their arts, for that is the heart of the
matter."</p>

<p>So the diners out stepped forward with long slips of paper
containing answers to their questions. These had been framed after
much consideration. A good man, we had agreed, must at any rate be
honest, passionate, and unworldly. But whether or not a particular
man possessed those qualities could only be discovered by asking
questions, often beginning at a remote distance from the centre. Is
Kensington a nice place to live in? Where is your son being
educated&mdash;and your daughter? Now please tell me, what do you
pay for your cigars? By the way, is Sir Joseph a baronet or only a
knight? Often it seemed that we learnt more from trivial questions
of this kind than from more direct ones. "I accepted my peerage,"
said Lord Bunkum, "because my wife wished it." I forget how many
titles were accepted for the same reason. "Working fifteen hours
out of the twenty-four, as I do&mdash;" ten thousand professional
men began.</p>

<p>"No, no, of course you can neither read nor write. But why do
you work so hard?"</p>

<p>"My dear lady, with a growing family&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But why does your family grow?"</p>

<p>Their wives wished that too, or perhaps it was the British
Empire. But more significant than the answers were the refusals to
answer. Very few would reply at all to questions about morality and
religion, and such answers as were given were not serious.
Questions as to the value of money and power were almost invariably
brushed aside, or pressed at extreme risk to the asker.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," said Jill, "that if Sir Harley Tightboots hadn't
been carving the mutton when I asked him about the capitalist
system he would have cut my throat. The only reason why we escaped
with our lives over and over again is that men are at once so
hungry and so chivalrous. They despise us too much to mind what we
say."</p>

<p>"Of course they despise us," said Eleanor. "At the same time how
do you account for this&mdash;I made enquiries among the artists.
Now, no woman has ever been an artist, has she, Polls?"</p>

<p>
"Jane&mdash;Austen&mdash;Charlotte&mdash;Bronte&mdash;George&mdash;Eliot,"
cried Poll, like a man crying muffins in a back street.</p>

<p>"Damn the woman!" someone exclaimed. "What a bore she is!"</p>

<p>"Since Sappho there has been no female of first rate&mdash;"
Eleanor began, quoting from a weekly newspaper.</p>

<p>"It's now well known that Sappho was the somewhat lewd invention
of Professor Hobkin," Ruth interrupted.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, there is no reason to suppose that any woman ever has
been able to write or ever will be able to write," Eleanor
continued. "And yet, whenever I go among authors they never cease
to talk to me about their books. Masterly! I say, or Shakespeare
himself! (for one must say something) and I assure you, they
believe me."</p>

<p>"That proves nothing," said Jane. "They all do it. Only," she
sighed, "it doesn't seem to help us much. Perhaps we had better
examine modern literature next. Liz, it's your turn."</p>

<p>Elizabeth rose and said that in order to prosecute her enquiry
she had dressed as a man and been taken for a reviewer.</p>

<p>"I have read new books pretty steadily for the past five years,"
said she. "Mr. Wells is the most popular living writer; then comes
Mr. Arnold Bennett; then Mr. Compton Makenzie; Mr. McKenna and Mr.
Walpole may be bracketed together." She sat down.</p>

<p>"But you've told us nothing!" we expostulated. "Or do you mean
that these gentlemen have greatly surpassed Jane&mdash;Elliot and
that English fiction is&mdash;where's that review of yours? Oh,
yes, 'safe in their hands.'"</p>

<p>"Safe, quite safe," she said, shifting uneasily from foot to
foot. "And I'm sure that they give away even more than they
receive."</p>

<p>We were all sure of that. "But," we pressed her, "do they write
good books?"</p>

<p>"Good books?" she said, looking at the ceiling "You must
remember," she began, speaking with extreme rapidity, "that fiction
is the mirror of life. And you can't deny that education is of the
highest importance, and that it would be extremely annoying, if you
found yourself alone at Brighton late at night, not to know which
was the best boarding house to stay at, and suppose it was a
dripping Sunday evening&mdash;wouldn't it be nice to go to the
Movies?"</p>

<p>"But what has that got to do with it?" we asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing whatever," she replied.</p>

<p>"Well, tell us the truth," we bade her.</p>

<p>"The truth? But isn't it wonderful," she broke off&mdash;"Mr.
Chitter has written a weekly article for the past thirty years upon
love or hot buttered toast and has sent all his sons to
Eton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The truth!" we demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, the truth," she stammered, "the truth has nothing to do
with literature," and sitting down she refused to say another
word.</p>

<p>It all seemed to us very inconclusive.</p>

<p>"Ladies, we must try to sum up the results," Jane was beginning,
when a hum, which had been heard for some time through the open
window, drowned her voice.</p>

<p>"War! War! War! Declaration of War!" men were shouting in the
street below.</p>

<p>We looked at each other in horror.</p>

<p>"What war?" we cried. "What war?" We remembered, too late, that
we had never thought of sending anyone to the House of Commons. We
had forgotten all about it. We turned to Poll, who had reached the
history shelves in the London Library, and asked her to enlighten
us.</p>

<p>"Why," we cried, "do men go to war?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes for one reason, sometimes for another," she replied
calmly. "In 1760, for example&mdash;" The shouts outside drowned
her words. "Again in 1797&mdash;in 1804&mdash;It was the Austrians
in 1866-1870 was the Franco-Prussian&mdash;In 1900 on the other
hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it's now 1914!" we cut her short.</p>

<p>"Ah, I don't know what they're going to war for now," she
admitted.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The war was over and peace was in process of being signed, when
I once more found myself with Castalia in the room where our
meetings used to be held. We began idly turning over the pages of
our old minute books.</p>

<p>"Queer," I mused, "to see what we were thinking five years
ago."</p>

<p>"We are agreed," Castalia quoted, reading over my shoulder,
"that it is the object of life to produce good people and good
books."</p>

<p>We made no comment upon that.</p>

<p>"A good man is at any rate honest, passionate and
unworldly."</p>

<p>"What a woman's language!" I observed.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," cried Castalia, pushing the book away from her,
"what fools we were! It was all Poll's father's fault," she went
on. "I believe he did it on purpose&mdash;that ridiculous will, I
mean, forcing Poll to read all the books in the London Library. If
we hadn't learnt to read," she said bitterly, "we might still have
been bearing children in ignorance and that I believe was the
happiest life after all. I know what you're going to say about
war," she checked me, "and the horror of bearing children to see
them killed, but our mothers did it, and their mothers, and their
mothers before them. And they didn't complain. They couldn't read.
I've done my best," she sighed, "to prevent my little girl from
learning to read, but what's the use? I caught Ann only yesterday
with a newspaper in her hand and she was beginning to ask me if it
was 'true.' Next she'll ask me whether Mr. Lloyd George is a good
man, then whether Mr. Arnold Bennett is a good novelist, and
finally whether I believe in God. How can I bring my daughter up to
believe in nothing?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Surely you could teach her to believe that a man's intellect
is, and always will be, fundamentally superior to a woman's?" I
suggested. She brightened at this and began to turn over our old
minutes again. "Yes," she said, "think of their discoveries, their
mathematics, their science, their philosophy, their
scholarship&mdash;" and then she began to laugh, "I shall never
forget old Hobkin and the hairpin," she said, and went on reading
and laughing and I thought she was quite happy, when suddenly she
drew the book from her and burst out, "Oh, Cassandra, why do you
torment me? Don't you know that our belief in man's intellect is
the greatest fallacy of them all?"</p>

<p>"What?" I exclaimed. "Ask any journalist, schoolmaster,
politician or public house keeper in the land and they will all
tell you that men are much cleverer than women."</p>

<p>"As if I doubted it," she said scornfully. "How could they help
it? Haven't we bred them and fed and kept them in comfort since the
beginning of time so that they may be clever even if they're
nothing else? It's all our doing!" she cried. "We insisted upon
having intellect and now we've got it. And it's intellect," she
continued, "that's at the bottom of it. What could be more charming
than a boy before he has begun to cultivate his intellect? He is
beautiful to look at; he gives himself no airs; he understands the
meaning of art and literature instinctively; he goes about enjoying
his life and making other people enjoy theirs. Then they teach him
to cultivate his intellect. He becomes a barrister, a civil
servant, a general, an author, a professor. Every day he goes to an
office. Every year he produces a book. He maintains a whole family
by the products of his brain&mdash;poor devil! Soon he cannot come
into a room without making us all feel uncomfortable; he
condescends to every woman he meets, and dares not tell the truth
even to his own wife; instead of rejoicing our eyes we have to shut
them if we are to take him in our arms. True, they console
themselves with stars of all shapes, ribbons of all shades, and
incomes of all sizes&mdash;but what is to console us? That we shall
be able in ten years' time to spend a weekend at Lahore? Or that
the least insect in Japan has a name twice the length of its body?
Oh, Cassandra, for Heaven's sake let us devise a method by which
men may bear children! It is our only chance. For unless we provide
them with some innocent occupation we shall get neither good people
nor good books; we shall perish beneath the fruits of their
unbridled activity; and not a human being will survive to know that
there once was Shakespeare!"</p>

<p>"It is too late," I replied. "We cannot provide even for the
children that we have."</p>

<p>"And then you ask me to believe in intellect," she said.</p>

<p>While we spoke, man were crying hoarsely and wearily in the
street, and, listening, we heard that the Treaty of Peace had just
been signed. The voices died away. The rain was falling and
interfered no doubt with the proper explosion of the fireworks.</p>

<p>"My cook will have bought the Evening News," said Castalia, "and
Ann will be spelling it out over her tea. I must go home."</p>

<p>"It's no good&mdash;not a bit of good," I said. "Once she knows
how to read there's only one thing you can teach her to believe
in&mdash;and that is herself."</p>

<p>"Well, that would be a change," sighed Castalia.</p>

<p>So we swept up the papers of our Society, and, though Ann was
playing with her doll very happily, we solemnly made her a present
of the lot and told her we had chosen her to be President of the
Society of the future&mdash;upon which she burst into tears, poor
little girl.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>BLUE AND GREEN</h2>

<p><i>Green</i>
</p>

<p>The ported fingers of glass hang downwards. The light slides
down the glass, and drops a pool of green. All day long the ten
fingers of the lustre drop green upon the marble. The feathers of
parakeets&mdash;their harsh cries&mdash;sharp blades of palm
trees&mdash;green, too; green needles glittering in the sun. But
the hard glass drips on to the marble; the pools hover above the
dessert sand; the camels lurch through them; the pools settle on
the marble; rushes edge them; weeds clog them; here and there a
white blossom; the frog flops over; at night the stars are set
there unbroken. Evening comes, and the shadow sweeps the green over
the mantelpiece; the ruffled surface of ocean. No ships come; the
aimless waves sway beneath the empty sky. It's night; the needles
drip blots of blue. The green's out.</p>

<p><i>Blue</i>
</p>

<p>The snub-nosed monster rises to the surface and spouts through
his blunt nostrils two columns of water, which, fiery-white in the
centre, spray off into a fringe of blue beads. Strokes of blue line
the black tarpaulin of his hide. Slushing the water through mouth
and nostrils he sings, heavy with water, and the blue closes over
him dowsing the polished pebbles of his eyes. Thrown upon the beach
he lies, blunt, obtuse, shedding dry blue scales. Their metallic
blue stains the rusty iron on the beach. Blue are the ribs of the
wrecked rowing boat. A wave rolls beneath the blue bells. But the
cathedral's different, cold, incense laden, faint blue with the
veils of madonnas.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>IN THE ORCHARD</h2>

<p>Miranda slept in the orchard, lying in a long chair beneath the
apple tree. Her book had fallen into the grass, and her finger
still seemed to point at the sentence 'Ce pays est vraiment un des
coins du monde oui le rire des filles elate le mieux...' as if she
had fallen asleep just there. The opals on her finger flushed
green, flushed rosy, and again flushed orange as the sun, oozing
through the apple-trees, filled them. Then, when the breeze blew,
her purple dress rippled like a flower attached to a stalk; the
grasses nodded; and the white butterfly came blowing this way and
that just above her face.</p>

<p>Four feet in the air over her head the apples hung. Suddenly
there was a shrill clamour as if they were gongs of cracked brass
beaten violently, irregularly, and brutally. It was only the
school-children saying the multiplication table in unison, stopped
by the teacher, scolded, and beginning to say the multiplication
table over again. But this clamour passed four feet above Miranda's
head, went through the apple boughs, and, striking against the
cowman's little boy who was picking blackberries in the hedge when
he should have been at school, made him tear his thumb on the
thorns.</p>

<p>Next there was a solitary cry&mdash;sad, human, brutal. Old
Parsley was, indeed, blind drunk.</p>

<p>Then the very topmost leaves of the apple-tree, flat like little
fish against the blue, thirty feet above the earth, chimed with a
pensive and lugubrious note. It was the organ in the church playing
one of Hymns Ancient and Modern. The sound floated out and was cut
into atoms by a flock of field-fares flying at an enormous
speed&mdash;somewhere or other. Miranda lay asleep thirty feet
beneath.</p>

<p>Then above the apple-tree and the pear-tree two hundred feet
above Miranda lying asleep in the orchard bells thudded,
intermittent, sullen, didactic, for six poor women of the parish
were being churched and the Rector was returning thanks to
heaven.</p>

<p>And above that with a sharp squeak the golden feather of the
church tower turned from south to east. The wind changed. Above
everything else it droned, above the woods, the meadows, the hills,
miles above Miranda lying in the orchard asleep. It swept on,
eyeless, brainless, meeting nothing that could stand against it,
until, wheeling the other way, it turned south again. Miles below,
in a space as big as the eye of a needle, Miranda stood upright and
cried aloud: 'Oh, I shall be late for tea!'</p>

<p>Miranda slept in the orchard&mdash;or perhaps she was not
asleep, for her lips moved very slightly as if they were saying,
'Ce pays est vraiment un des coins du monde...oui le rire des
filles...eclate...eclate...eclate.' and then she smiled and let her
body sink all its weight on to the enormous earth which rises, she
thought, to carry me on its back as if I were a leaf, or a queen
(here the children said the multiplication table), or, Miranda went
on, I might be lying on the top of a cliff with the gulls screaming
above me. The higher they fly, she continued, as the teacher
scolded the children and rapped Jimmy over the knuckles till they
bled, the deeper they look into the sea&mdash;into the sea, she
repeated, and her fingers relaxed and her lips closed gently as if
she were floating on the sea, and then, when the shout of the
drunken man sounded overhead, she drew breath with an extraordinary
ecstasy, for she thought that she heard life itself crying out from
a rough tongue in a scarlet mouth, from the wind, from the bells,
from the curved green leaves of the cabbages.</p>

<p>Naturally she was being married when the organ played the tune
from Hymns Ancient and Modern, and, when the bells rang after the
six poor women had been churched, the sullen intermittent thud made
her think that the very earth shook with the hoofs of the horse
that was galloping towards her ('Ah, I have only to wait!' she
sighed), and it seemed to her that everything had already begun
moving, crying, riding, flying round her, across her, towards her
in a pattern.</p>

<p>Mary is chopping the wood, she thought; Pearman is herding the
cows; the carts are coming up from the meadows; the rider&mdash;and
she traced out the lines that the men, the carts, the birds, and
the rider made over the countryside until they all seemed driven
out, round, and across by the beat of her own heart.</p>

<p>Miles up in the air the wind changed; the golden feather of the
church tower squeaked; and Miranda jumped up and cried: 'Oh, I
shall be late for tea!'</p>

<p>Miranda slept in the orchard, or was she asleep or was she not
asleep? Her purple dress stretched between the two apple-trees.
There were twenty-four apple-trees in the orchard, some slanting
slightly, others growing straight with a rush up the trunk which
spread wide into branches and formed into round red or yellow
drops. Each apple-tree had sufficient space. The sky exactly fitted
the leaves. When the breeze blew, the line of the boughs against
the wall slanted slightly and then returned. A wagtail flew
diagonally from one corner to another. Cautiously hopping, a thrush
advanced towards a fallen apple; from the other wall a sparrow
fluttered just above the grass. The uprush of the trees was tied
down by these movements; the whole was compacted by the orchard
walls. For miles beneath the earth was clamped together; rippled on
the surface with wavering air; and across the corner of the orchard
the blue-green was slit by a purple streak. The wind changing, one
bunch of apples was tossed so high that it blotted out two cows in
the meadow ('Oh, I shall be late for tea!' cried Miranda), and the
apples hung straight across the wall again.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>MRS DALLOWAY IN BOND STREET</h2>

<p>Mrs Dalloway said she would buy the gloves herself.</p>

<p>Big Ben was striking as she stepped out into the street. It was
eleven o'clock and the unused hour was fresh as if issued to
children on a beach. But there was something solemn in the
deliberate swing of the repeated strokes; something stirring in the
murmur of wheels and the shuffle of footsteps.</p>

<p>No doubt they were not all bound on errands of happiness. There
is much more to be said about us than that we walk the streets of
Westminster. Big Ben too is nothing but steel rods consumed by rust
were it not for the care of H.M.'s Office of Works. Only for Mrs
Dalloway the moment was complete; for Mrs Dalloway June was fresh.
A happy childhood&mdash;and it was not to his daughters only that
Justin Parry had seemed a fine fellow (weak of course on the
Bench); flowers at evening, smoke rising; the caw of rooks falling
from ever so high, down down through the October air&mdash;there is
nothing to take the place of childhood. A leaf of mint brings it
back: or a cup with a blue ring.</p>

<p>Poor little wretches, she sighed, and pressed forward. Oh, right
under the horses' noses, you little demon! and there she was left
on the kerb stretching her hand out, while Jimmy Dawes grinned on
the further side.</p>

<p>A charming woman, poised, eager, strangely white-haired for her
pink cheeks, so Scope Purvis, C.C.B., saw her as he hurried to his
office. She stiffened a little, waiting for burthen's van to pass.
Big Ben struck the tenth; struck the eleventh stroke. The leaden
circles dissolved in the air. Pride held her erect, inheriting,
handing on, acquainted with discipline and with suffering. How
people suffered, how they suffered, she thought, thinking of Mrs
Foxcroft at the Embassy last night decked with jewels, eating her
heart out, because that nice boy was dead, and now the old Manor
House (Durtnall's van passed) must go to a cousin.</p>

<p>'Good morning to you!' said Hugh Whitbread raising his hat
rather extravagantly by the china shop, for they had known each
other as children. 'Where are you off to?'</p>

<p>'I love walking in London,' said Mrs Dalloway. 'Really it's
better than walking in the country!'</p>

<p>'We've just come up,' said Hugh Whitbread. 'Unfortunately to see
doctors.'</p>

<p>'Milly?' said Mrs Dalloway, instantly compassionate.</p>

<p>'Out of sorts,' said Hugh Whitbread. 'That sort of thing. Dick
all right?'</p>

<p>'First rate!' said Clarissa.</p>

<p>Of course, she thought, walking on, Milly is about my
age&mdash;fifty, fifty-two. So it is probably that, Hugh's manner
had said so, said it perfectly&mdash;dear old Hugh, thought Mrs
Dalloway, remembering with amusement, with gratitude, with emotion,
how shy, like a brother&mdash;one would rather die than speak to
one's brother&mdash;Hugh had always been, when he was at Oxford,
and came over, and perhaps one of them (drat the thing!) couldn't
ride. How then could women sit in Parliament? How could they do
things with men? For there is this extra-ordinarily deep instinct,
something inside one; you can't get over it; it's no use trying;
and men like Hugh respect it without our saying it, which is what
one loves, thought Clarissa, in dear old Hugh.</p>

<p>She had passed through the Admiralty Arch and saw at the end of
the empty road with its thin trees Victoria's white mound,
Victoria's billowing motherliness, amplitude and homeliness, always
ridiculous, yet how sublime, thought Mrs Dalloway, remembering
Kensington Gardens and the old lady in horn spectacles and being
told by Nanny to stop dead still and bow to the Queen. The flag
flew above the Palace. The King and Queen were back then. Dick had
met her at lunch the other day&mdash;a thoroughly nice woman. It
matters so much to the poor, thought Clarissa, and to the soldiers.
A man in bronze stood heroically on a pedestal with a gun on her
left hand side&mdash;the South African war. It matters, thought Mrs
Dalloway walking towards Buckingham Palace. There it stood
four-square, in the broad sunshine, uncompromising, plain. But it
was character, she thought; something inborn in the race; what
Indians respected. The Queen went to hospitals, opened
bazaars&mdash;the Queen of England, thought Clarissa, looking at
the Palace. Already at this hour a motor car passed out at the
gates; soldiers saluted; the gates were shut. And Clarissa,
crossing the road, entered the Park, holding herself upright.</p>

<p>June had drawn out every leaf on the trees. The mothers of
Westminster with mottled breasts gave suck to their young. Quite
respectable girls lay stretched on the grass. An elderly man,
stooping very stiffly, picked up a crumpled paper, spread it out
flat and flung it away. How horrible! Last night at the Embassy Sir
Dighton had said, 'If I want a fellow to hold my horse, I have only
to put up my hand.' But the religious question is far more serious
than the economic, Sir Dighton had said, which she thought
extraordinarily interesting, from a man like Sir Dighton. 'Oh, the
country will never know what it has lost,' he had said, talking of
his own accord, about dear Jack Stewart.</p>

<p>She mounted the little hill lightly. The air stirred with
energy. Messages were passing from the Fleet to the Admiralty.
Piccadilly and Arlington Street and the Mall seemed to chafe the
very air in the Park and lift its leaves hotly, brilliantly, upon
waves of that divine vitality which Clarissa loved. To ride; to
dance; she had adored all that. Or going long walks in the country,
talking, about books, what to do with one's life, for young people
were amazingly priggish&mdash;oh, the things one had said! But one
had conviction. Middle age is the devil. People like Jack'll never
know that, she thought; for he never once thought of death, never,
they said, knew he was dying. And now can never mourn&mdash;how did
it go?&mdash;a head grown grey...From the contagion of the world's
slow stain,...have drunk their cup a round or two before...From the
contagion of the world's slow stain! She held herself upright.</p>

<p>But how jack would have shouted! Quoting Shelley, in Piccadilly,
'You want a pin,' he would have said. He hated frumps. 'My God
Clarissa! My God Clarissa!'&mdash;she could hear him now at the
Devonshire House party, about poor Sylvia Hunt in her amber
necklace and that dowdy old silk. Clarissa held herself upright for
she had spoken aloud and now she was in Piccadilly, passing the
house with the slender green columns, and the balconies; passing
club windows full of newspapers; passing old Lady Burdett-Coutts'
house where the glazed white parrot used to hang; and Devonshire
House, without its gilt leopards; and Claridge's, where she must
remember Dick wanted her to leave a card on Mrs Jepson or she would
be gone. Rich Americans can be very charming. There was St James's
Palace; like a child's game with bricks; and now&mdash;she had
passed Bond Street&mdash;she was by Hatchard's book shop. The
stream was endless&mdash;endless endless. Lords, Ascot,
Hurlingham&mdash;what was it? What a duck, she thought, looking at
the frontispiece of some book of memoirs spread wide in the bow
window, Sir Joshua perhaps or Romney; arch, bright, demure; the
sort of girl&mdash;like her own Elizabeth&mdash;the only real sort
of girl. And there was that absurd book, Soapy Sponge, which Jim
used to quote by the yard; and Shakespeare's Sonnets. She knew them
by heart. Phil and she had argued all day about the Dark Lady, and
Dick had said straight out at dinner that night that he had never
heard of her. Really, she had married him for that! He had never
read Shakespeare! There must be some little cheap book she could
buy for Milly&mdash;Cranford of course! Was there ever anything so
enchanting as the cow in petticoats? If only people had that sort
of humour, that sort of self-respect now, thought Clarissa, for she
remembered the broad pages; the sentences ending; the
characters&mdash;how one talked about them as if they were real.
For all the great things one must go to the past, she thought. From
the contagion of the world's slow stain...Fear no more the heat o'
the sun...And now can never mourn, can never mourn, she repeated,
her eyes straying over the window; for it ran in her head; the test
of great poetry; the moderns had never written anything one wanted
to read about death, she thought; and turned.</p>

<p>Omnibuses joined motor cars; motor cars vans; vans taxicabs,
taxicabs motor cars&mdash;here was an open motor car with a girl,
alone. Up till four, her feet tingling, I know, thought Clarissa,
for the girl looked washed out, half asleep, in the corner of the
car after the dance. And another car came; and another. No! No! No!
Clarissa smiled good-naturedly. The fat lady had taken every sort
of trouble, but diamonds! orchids! at this hour of the morning! No!
No! No! The excellent policeman would, when the time came, hold up
his hand. Another motor car passed. How utterly unattractive! Why
should a girl of that age paint black round her eyes? And a young
man, with a girl, at this hour, when the country&mdash; The
admirable policeman raised his hand and Clarissa acknowledging his
sway, taking her time, crossed, walked towards Bond Street; saw the
narrow crooked street, the yellow banners; the thick notched
telegraph wires stretched across the sky.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago her great-great-grandfather, Seymour Parry,
who ran away with Conway's daughter, had walked down Bond Street.
Down Bond Street the Parrys had walked for a hundred years, and
might have met the Dalloways (Leighs on the mother's side) going
up. Her father got his clothes from Hill's. There was a roll of
cloth in the window, and here just one jar on a black table,
incredibly expensive; like the thick pink salmon on the ice block
at the fish monger's. The jewels were exquisite&mdash;pink and
orange stars, paste, Spanish, she thought, and chains of old gold;
starry buckles, little brooches which had been worn on sea-green
satin by ladies with high head-dresses. But no good looking! One
must economise. She must go on past the picture dealer's where one
of the odd French pictures hung, as if people had thrown
confetti&mdash;pink and blue&mdash;for a joke. If you had lived
with pictures (and it's the same with books and music) thought
Clarissa, passing the Aeolian Hall, you can't be taken in by a
joke.</p>

<p>The river of Bond Street was clogged. There, like a Queen at a
tournament, raised, regal, was Lady Bexborough. She sat in her
carriage, upright, alone, looking through her glasses. The white
glove was loose at her wrist. She was in black, quite shabby, yet,
thought Clarissa, how extraordinarily it tells, breeding,
self-respect, never saying a word too much or letting people
gossip; an astonishing friend; no one can pick a hole in her after
all these years, and now, there she is, thought Clarissa, passing
the Countess who waited powdered, perfectly still, and Clarissa
would have given anything to be like that, the mistress of
Clarefield, talking politics, like a man. But she never goes
anywhere, thought Clarissa, and it's quite useless to ask her, and
the carriage went on and Lady Bexborough was borne past like a
Queen at a tournament, though she had nothing to live for and the
old man is failing and they say she is sick of it all, thought
Clarissa and the tears actually rose to her eyes as she entered the
shop.</p>

<p>'Good morning,' said Clarissa in her charming voice. 'Gloves,'
she said with her exquisite friendliness and putting her bag on the
counter began, very slowly, to undo the buttons. 'White gloves,'
she said. 'Above the elbow,' and she looked straight into the
shop-woman's face&mdash;but this was not the girl she remembered?
She looked quite old. 'These really don't fit,' said Clarissa. The
shop-girl looked at them. 'Madame wears bracelets?' Clarissa spread
out her fingers. 'Perhaps it's my rings.' And the girl took the
grey gloves with her to the end of the counter.</p>

<p>Yes, thought Clarissa, if it's the girl I remember, she's twenty
years older...There was only one other customer, sitting sideways
at the counter, her elbow poised, her bare hand drooping, vacant;
like a figure on a Japanese fan, thought Clarissa, too vacant
perhaps, yet some men would adore her. The lady shook her head
sadly. Again the gloves were too large. She turned round the glass.
'Above the wrist,' she reproached the grey-headed woman; who looked
and agreed.</p>

<p>They waited; a clock ticked; Bond Street hummed, dulled,
distant; the woman went away holding gloves. 'Above the wrist,'
said the lady, mournfully, raising her voice. And she would have to
order chairs, ices, flowers, and cloak-room tickets, thought
Clarissa. The people she didn't want would come; the others
wouldn't. She would stand by the door. They sold
stockings&mdash;silk stockings. A lady is known by her gloves and
her shoes, old Uncle William used to say. And through the hanging
silk stockings quivering silver she looked at the lady, sloping
shouldered, her hand drooping, her bag slipping, her eyes vacantly
on the floor. It would be intolerable if dowdy women came to her
party! Would one have liked Keats if he had worn red socks? Oh, at
last&mdash;she drew into the counter and it flashed into her
mind:</p>

<p>'Do you remember before the war you had gloves with pearl
buttons?'</p>

<p>'French gloves, Madame?'</p>

<p>'Yes, they were French,' said Clarissa. The other lady rose very
sadly and took her bag, and looked at the gloves on the counter.
But they were all too large&mdash;always too large at the
wrist.</p>

<p>'With pearl buttons,' said the shop-girl, who looked ever so
much older. She split the lengths of tissue paper apart on the
counter. With pearl buttons, thought Clarissa, perfectly
simple&mdash;how French!</p>

<p>'Madame's hands are so slender,' said the shop-girl, drawing the
glove firmly, smoothly, down over her rings. And Clarissa looked at
her arm in the looking-glass. The glove hardly came to the elbow.
Were there others half an inch longer? Still it seemed tiresome to
bother her perhaps the one day in the month, thought Clarissa, when
it's an agony to stand. 'Oh, don't bother,' she said. But the
gloves were brought.</p>

<p>'Don't you get fearfully tired,' she said in her charming voice,
'standing? When d'you get your holiday?'</p>

<p>'In September, Madame, when we're not so busy.'</p>

<p>When we're in the country thought Clarissa. Or shooting. She has
a fortnight at Brighton. In some stuffy lodging. The landlady takes
the sugar. Nothing would be easier than to send her to Mrs Lumley's
right in the country (and it was on the tip of her tongue). But
then she remembered how on their honeymoon Dick had shown her the
folly of giving impulsively. It was much more important, he said,
to get trade with China. Of course he was right. And she could feel
the girl wouldn't like to be given things. There she was in her
place. So was Dick. Selling gloves was her job. She had her own
sorrows quite separate, 'and now can never mourn, can never mourn,'
the words ran in her head. 'From the contagion of the world's slow
stain,' thought Clarissa holding her arm stiff, for there are
moments when it seems utterly futile (the glove was drawn off
leaving her arm flecked with powder)&mdash;simply one doesn't
believe, thought Clarissa, any more in God.</p>

<p>The traffic suddenly roared; the silk stockings brightened. A
customer came in.</p>

<p>'White gloves,' she said, with some ring in her voice that
Clarissa remembered.</p>

<p>It used, thought Clarissa, to be so simple. Down down through
the air came the caw of the rooks. When Sylvia died, hundreds of
years ago, the yew hedges looked so lovely with the diamond webs in
the mist before early church. But if Dick were to die tomorrow, as
for believing in God&mdash;no, she would let the children choose,
but for herself, like Lady Bexborough, who opened the bazaar, they
say, with the telegram in her hand&mdash;Roden, her favourite,
killed&mdash;she would go on. But why, if one doesn't believe? For
the sake of others, she thought, taking the glove in her hand. The
girl would be much more unhappy if she didn't believe.</p>

<p>'Thirty shillings,' said the shop-woman. 'No, pardon me Madame,
thirty-five. The French gloves are more.'</p>

<p>For one doesn't live for oneself, thought Clarissa.</p>

<p>And then the other customer took a glove, tugged it, and it
split.</p>

<p>'There!' she exclaimed.</p>

<p>'A fault of the skin,' said the grey-headed woman hurriedly.
'Sometimes a drop of acid in tanning. Try this pair, Madame.'</p>

<p>'But it's an awful swindle to ask two pound ten!'</p>

<p>Clarissa looked at the lady; the lady looked at Clarissa.</p>

<p>'Gloves have never been quite so reliable since the war,' said
the shop-girl, apologising, to Clarissa.</p>

<p>But where had she seen the other lady?&mdash;elderly, with a
frill under her chin; wearing a black ribbon for gold eyeglasses;
sensual, clever, like a Sargent drawing. How one can tell from a
voice when people are in the habit, thought Clarissa, of making
other people&mdash;'It's a shade too tight,' she said&mdash;obey.
The shop-woman went off again. Clarissa was left waiting. Fear no
more she repeated, playing her finger on the counter. Fear no more
the heat o' the sun. Fear no more she repeated. There were little
brown spots on her arm. And the girl crawled like a snail. Thou thy
worldly task hast done. Thousands of young men had died that things
might go on. At last! Half an rich above the elbow; pearl buttons;
five and a quarter. My dear slow coach, thought Clarissa, do you
think I can sit here the whole morning? Now you'll take twenty-five
minutes to bring me my change!</p>

<p>There was a violent explosion in the street outside. The
shop-women cowered behind the counters. But Clarissa, sitting very
upright, smiled at the other lady. 'Miss Anstruther!' she
exclaimed.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>A WOMAN'S COLLEGE FROM
OUTSIDE</h2>

<p>The feathery-white moon never let the sky grow dark; all night
the chestnut blossoms were white in the green, and dim was the
cow-parsley in the meadows. Neither to Tartary nor to Arabia went
the wind of the Cambridge courts, but lapsed dreamily in the midst
of grey-blue clouds over the roofs of Newnham. There, in the
garden, if she needed space to wander, she might find it among the
trees; and as none but women's faces could meet her face, she might
unveil it blank, featureless, and gaze into rooms where at that
hour, blank, featureless, eyelids white over eyes, ringless hands
extended upon sheets, slept innumerable women. But here and there a
light still burned.</p>

<p>A double light one might figure in Angela's room, seeing how
bright Angela herself was, and how bright came back the reflection
of herself from the square glass. The whole of her was perfectly
delineated&mdash;perhaps the soul. For the glass held up an
untrembling image&mdash;white and gold, red slippers, pale hair
with blue stones in it, and never a ripple or shadow to break the
smooth kiss of Angela and her reflection in the glass, as if she
were glad to be Angela. Anyhow the moment was glad the bright
picture hung in the heart of night, the shrine hollowed in the
nocturnal blackness. Strange indeed to have this visible proof of
the rightness of things; this lily floating flawless upon Time's
pool, fearless, as if this were sufficient&mdash;this reflection.
Which meditation she betrayed by turning, and the mirror held
nothing at all, or only the brass bedstead, and she, running here
and there, patting, and darting, became like a woman in a house,
and changed again, pursing her lips over a black book and marking
with her finger what surely could not be a firm grasp of the
science of economics. Only Angela Williams was at Newnham for the
purpose of earning her living, and could not forget even in moments
of impassioned adoration the cheques of her father at Swansea; her
mother washing in the scullery: pink frocks out to dry on the line;
tokens that even the lily no longer floats flawless upon the pool,
but has a name on a card like another.</p>

<p>A. Williams&mdash;one may read it in the moonlight; and next to
it some Mary or Eleanor, Mildred, Sarah, Phoebe upon square cards
on their doors. All names, nothing but names. The cool white light
withered them and starched them until it seemed as if the only
purpose of all these names was to rise martially in order should
there be a call on them to extinguish a fire, suppress an
insurrection, or pass an examination. Such is the power of names
written upon cards pinned upon doors. Such too the resemblance,
what with tiles, corridors, and bedroom doors, to dairy or nunnery,
a place of seclusion or discipline, where the bowl of milk stands
cool and pure and there's a great washing of linen.</p>

<p>At that very moment soft laughter came from behind a door. A
prim-voiced clock struck the hour&mdash;one, two. Now if the clock
were issuing his commands, they were disregarded. Fire,
insurrection, examination, were all snowed under by laughter, or
softly uprooted, the sound seeming to bubble up from the depths and
gently waft away the hour, rules, discipline. The bed was strewn
with cards. Sally was on the floor. Helena in the chair. Good
Bertha clasping her hands by the fire-place. A. Williams came in
yawning.</p>

<p>'Because it's utterly and intolerably damnable,' said
Helena.</p>

<p>'Damnable,' echoed Bertha. Then yawned.</p>

<p>'We're not eunuchs.'</p>

<p>'I saw her slipping in by the back gate with that old hat on.
They don't want us to know.'</p>

<p>'They?' said Angela. 'She.'</p>

<p>Then the laughter.</p>

<p>The cards were spread, falling with their red and yellow, faces
on the table, and hands were dabbled in the cards. Good Bertha,
leaning with her head against the chair, sighed profoundly. For she
would willingly have slept, but since night is free pasturage, a
limitless field, since night is unmoulded richness, one must tunnel
into its darkness. One must hang it with jewels. Night was shared
in secret, day browsed on by the whole flock. The blinds were up. A
mist was on the garden. Sitting on the floor by the window (while
the others played), body, mind, both together, seemed blown through
the air, to trail across the bushes. Ah, but she desired to stretch
out in bed and to sleep! She believed that no one felt her desire
for sleep; she believed humbly&mdash;sleepily&mdash;with sudden
nods and lurchings, that other people were wide awake. When they
laughed all together a bird chirped in its sleep out in the garden,
as if the laughter...</p>

<p>Yes, as if the laughter (for she dozed now) floated out much
like mist and attached itself by soft elastic shreds to plants and
bushes, so that the garden was vaporous and clouded. And then,
swept by the wind, the bushes would bow themselves and the white
vapour blow off across the world.</p>

<p>From all the rooms where women slept this vapour issued,
attaching itself to shrubs, like mist, and then blew freely out
into the open. Elderly women slept, who would on waking immediately
clasp the ivory rod of office. Now smooth and colourless, reposing
deeply, they lay surrounded, lay supported, by the bodies of youth
recumbent or grouped at the window; pouring forth into the garden
this bubbling laughter, this irresponsible laughter: this laughter
of mind and body floating away rules, hours, discipline: immensely
fertilising, yet formless, chaotic, trailing and straying and
tufting the rose-bushes with shreds of vapour.</p>

<p>'Ah,' breathed Angela, standing at the window in her night-gown.
Pain was in her voice. She leant her head out. The mist was cleft
as if her voice parted it. She had been talking, while the others
played, to Alice Avery, about Bamborough Castle; the colour of the
sands at evening; upon which Alice said she would write and settle
the day, in August, and stooping, kissed her, at least touched her
head with her hand, and Angela, positively unable to sit still,
like one possessed of a wind-lashed sea in her heart, roamed up and
down the room (the witness of such a scene) throwing her arms out
to relieve this excitement, this astonishment at the incredible
stooping of the miraculous tree with the golden fruit at its
summit&mdash;hadn't it dropped into her arms? She held it glowing
to her breast, a thing not to be touched, thought of, or spoken
about, but left to glow there. And then, slowly putting there her
stockings, there her slippers, folding her petticoat neatly on top,
Angela, her other name being Williams, realised&mdash;how could she
express it?&mdash;that after the dark churning of myriad ages here
was light at the end of the tunnel; life; the world. Beneath her it
lay&mdash;all good; all lovable. Such was her discovery.</p>

<p>Indeed, how could one then feel surprise if, lying in bed, she
could not close her eyes?&mdash;something irresistibly unclosed
them&mdash;if in the shallow darkness chair and chest of drawers
looked stately, and the looking-glass precious with its ashen hint
of day? Sucking her thumb like a child (her age nineteen last
November), she lay in this good world, this new world, this world
at the end of the tunnel, until a desire to see it or forestall it
drove her, tossing her blankets, to guide herself to the window,
and there, looking out upon the garden, where the mist lay, all the
windows open, one fiery-bluish, something murmuring in the
distance, the world of course, and the morning coming, 'Oh,' she
cried, as if in pain.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>THE NEW DRESS</h2>

<p>Mabel had her first serious suspicion that something was wrong
as she took her cloak off and Mrs. Barnet, while handing her the
mirror and touching the brushes and thus drawing her attention,
perhaps rather markedly, to all the appliances for tidying and
improving hair, complexion, clothes, which existed on the dressing
table, confirmed the suspicion&mdash;that it was not right, not
quite right, which growing stronger as she went upstairs and
springing at her, with conviction as she greeted Clarissa Dalloway,
she went straight to the far end of the room, to a shaded corner
where a looking-glass hung and looked. No! It was not <i>right</i>.
And at once the misery which she always tried to hide, the profound
dissatisfaction&mdash;the sense she had had, ever since she was a
child, of being inferior to other people&mdash;set upon her,
relentlessly, remorselessly, with an intensity which she could not
beat off, as she would when she woke at night at home, by reading
Borrow or Scott; for oh these men, oh these women, all were
thinking&mdash;"What's Mabel wearing? What a fright she looks! What
a hideous new dress!"&mdash;their eyelids flickering as they came
up and then their lids shutting rather tight. It was her own
appalling inadequacy; her cowardice; her mean, water-sprinkled
blood that depressed her. And at once the whole of the room where,
for ever so many hours, she had planned with the little dressmaker
how it was to go, seemed sordid, repulsive; and her own
drawing-room so shabby, and herself, going out, puffed up with
vanity as she touched the letters on the hall table and said: "How
dull!" to show off&mdash;all this now seemed unutterably silly,
paltry, and provincial. All this had been absolutely destroyed,
shown up, exploded, the moment she came into Mrs. Dalloway's
drawing-room.</p>

<p>What she had thought that evening when, sitting over the
teacups, Mrs. Dalloway's invitation came, was that, of course, she
could not be fashionable. It was absurd to pretend it
even&mdash;fashion meant cut, meant style, meant thirty guineas at
least&mdash;but why not be original? Why not be herself, anyhow?
And, getting up, she had taken that old fashion book of her
mother's, a Paris fashion book of the time of the Empire, and had
thought how much prettier, more dignified, and more womanly they
were then, and so set herself&mdash;oh, it was foolish&mdash;trying
to be like them, pluming herself in fact, upon being modest and
old-fashioned, and very charming, giving herself up, no doubt about
it, to an orgy of self-love, which deserved to be chastised, and so
rigged herself out like this.</p>

<p>But she dared not look in the glass. She could not face the
whole horror&mdash;the pale yellow, idiotically old-fashioned silk
dress with its long skirt and its high sleeves and its waist and
all the things that looked so charming in the fashion book, but not
on her, not among all these ordinary people. She felt like a
dressmaker's dummy standing there, for young people to stick pins
into.</p>

<p>"But, my dear, it's perfectly charming!" Rose Shaw said, looking
her up and down with that little satirical pucker of the lips which
she expected&mdash;Rose herself being dressed in the height of the
fashion, precisely like everybody else, always.</p>

<p>We are all like flies trying to crawl over the edge of the
saucer, Mabel thought, and repeated the phrase as if she were
crossing herself, as if she were trying to find some spell to annul
this pain, to make this agony endurable. Tags of Shakespeare, lines
from books she had read ages ago, suddenly came to her when she was
in agony, and she repeated them over and over again. "Flies trying
to crawl," she repeated. If she could say that over often enough
and make herself see the flies, she would become numb, chill,
frozen, dumb. Now she could see flies crawling slowly out of a
saucer of milk with their wings stuck together; and she strained
and strained (standing in front of the looking-glass, listening to
Rose Shaw) to make herself see Rose Shaw and all the other people
there as flies, trying to hoist themselves out of something, or
into something, meagre, insignificant, toiling flies. But she could
not see them like that, not other people. She saw herself like
that&mdash;she was a fly, but the others were dragonflies,
butterflies, beautiful insects, dancing, fluttering, skimming,
while she alone dragged herself up out of the saucer. (Envy and
spite, the most detestable of the vices, were her chief
faults.)</p>

<p>"I feel like some dowdy, decrepit, horribly dingy old fly," she
said, making Robert Haydon stop just to hear her say that, just to
reassure herself by furbishing up a poor weak-kneed phrase and so
showing how detached she was, how witty, that she did not feel in
the least out of anything. And, of course, Robert Haydon answered
something, quite polite, quite insincere, which she saw through
instantly, and said to herself, directly he went (again from some
book), "Lies, lies, lies!" For a party makes things either much
more real, or much less real, she thought; she saw in a flash to
the bottom of Robert Haydon's heart; she saw through everything.
She saw the truth. <i>This</i> was true, this drawing-room, this
self, and the other false. Miss Milan's little workroom was really
terribly hot, stuffy, sordid. It smelt of clothes and cabbage
cooking; and yet, when Miss Milan put the glass in her hand, and
she looked at herself with the dress on, finished, an extraordinary
bliss shot through her heart. Suffused with light, she sprang into
existence. Rid of cares and wrinkles, what she had dreamed of
herself was there&mdash;a beautiful woman, just for a second (she
had not dared look longer, Miss Milan wanted to know about the
length of the skirt), there looked at her, framed in the
scrolloping mahogany, a grey-white, mysteriously smiling, charming
girl, the core of herself, the soul of herself; and it was not
vanity only, not only self-love that made her think it good,
tender, and true. Miss Milan said that the skirt could not well be
longer; if anything the skirt, said Miss Milan, puckering her
forehead, considering with all her wits about her, must be shorter;
and she felt, suddenly, honestly, full of love for Miss Milan,
much, much fonder of Miss Milan than of any one in the whole world,
and could have cried for pity that she should be crawling on the
floor with her mouth full of pins, and her face red and her eyes
bulging&mdash;that one human being should be doing this for
another, and she saw them all as human beings merely, and herself
going off to her party, and Miss Milan pulling the cover over the
canary's cage, or letting him pick a hemp-seed from between her
lips, and the thought of it, of this side of human nature and its
patience and its endurance and its being content with such
miserable, scanty, sordid, little pleasures filled her eyes with
tears.</p>

<p>And now the whole thing had vanished. The dress, the room, the
love, the pity, the scrolloping looking-glass, and the canary's
cage&mdash;all had vanished, and here she was in a corner of Mrs.
Dalloway's drawing-room, suffering tortures, woken wide awake to
reality.</p>

<p>But it was all so paltry, weak-blooded, and petty-minded to care
so much at her age with two children, to be still so utterly
dependent on people's opinions and not have principles or
convictions, not to be able to say as other people did, "There's
Shakespeare! There's death! We're all weevils in a captain's
biscuit"&mdash;or whatever it was that people did say.</p>

<p>She faced herself straight in the glass; she pecked at her left
shoulder; she issued out into the room, as if spears were thrown at
her yellow dress from all sides. But instead of looking fierce or
tragic, as Rose Shaw would have done&mdash;Rose would have looked
like Boadicea&mdash;she looked foolish and self-conscious, and
simpered like a schoolgirl and slouched across the room, positively
slinking, as if she were a beaten mongrel, and looked at a picture,
an engraving. As if one went to a party to look at a picture!
Everybody knew why she did it&mdash;it was from shame, from
humiliation.</p>

<p>"Now the fly's in the saucer," she said to herself, "right in
the middle, and can't get out, and the milk," she thought, rigidly
staring at the picture, "is sticking its wings together."</p>

<p>"It's so old-fashioned," she said to Charles Burt, making him
stop (which by itself he hated) on his way to talk to some one
else.</p>

<p>She meant, or she tried to make herself think that she meant,
that it was the picture and not her dress, that was old-fashioned.
And one word of praise, one word of affection from Charles would
have made all the difference to her at the moment. If he had only
said, "Mabel, you're looking charming to-night!" it would have
changed her life. But then she ought to have been truthful and
direct. Charles said nothing of the kind, of course. He was malice
itself. He always saw through one, especially if one were feeling
particularly mean, paltry, or feeble-minded.</p>

<p>"Mabel's got a new dress!" he said, and the poor fly was
absolutely shoved into the middle of the saucer. Really, he would
like her to drown, she believed. He had no heart, no fundamental
kindness, only a veneer of friendliness. Miss Milan was much more
real, much kinder. If only one could feel that and stick to it,
always. "Why," she asked herself&mdash;replying to Charles much too
pertly, letting him see that she was out of temper, or "ruffled" as
he called it ("Rather ruffled?" he said and went on to laugh at her
with some woman over there)&mdash;"Why," she asked herself, "can't
I feel one thing always, feel quite sure that Miss Milan is right,
and Charles wrong and stick to it, feel sure about the canary and
pity and love and not be whipped all round in a second by coming
into a room full of people?" It was her odious, weak, vacillating
character again, always giving at the critical moment and not being
seriously interested in conchology, etymology, botany, archeology,
cutting up potatoes and watching them fructify like Mary Dennis,
like Violet Searle.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Holman, seeing her standing there, bore down upon her.
Of course a thing like a dress was beneath Mrs. Holman's notice,
with her family always tumbling downstairs or having the scarlet
fever. Could Mabel tell her if Elmthorpe was ever let for August
and September? Oh, it was a conversation that bored her
unutterably!&mdash;it made her furious to be treated like a house
agent or a messenger boy, to be made use of. Not to have value,
that was it, she thought, trying to grasp something hard, something
real, while she tried to answer sensibly about the bathroom and the
south aspect and the hot water to the top of the house; and all the
time she could see little bits of her yellow dress in the round
looking-glass which made them all the size of boot-buttons or
tadpoles; and it was amazing to think how much humiliation and
agony and self-loathing and effort and passionate ups and downs of
feeling were contained in a thing the size of a threepenny bit. And
what was still odder, this thing, this Mabel Waring, was separate,
quite disconnected; and though Mrs. Holman (the black button) was
leaning forward and telling her how her eldest boy had strained his
heart running, she could see her, too, quite detached in the
looking-glass, and it was impossible that the black dot, leaning
forward, gesticulating, should make the yellow dot, sitting
solitary, self-centred, feel what the black dot was feeling, yet
they pretended.</p>

<p>"So impossible to keep boys quiet"&mdash;that was the kind of
thing one said.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Holman, who could never get enough sympathy and
snatched what little there was greedily, as if it were her right
(but she deserved much more for there was her little girl who had
come down this morning with a swollen knee-joint), took this
miserable offering and looked at it suspiciously, grudgingly, as if
it were a halfpenny when it ought to have been a pound and put it
away in her purse, must put up with it, mean and miserly though it
was, times being hard, so very hard; and on she went, creaking,
injured Mrs. Holman, about the girl with the swollen joints. Ah, it
was tragic, this greed, this clamour of human beings, like a row of
cormorants, barking and flapping their wings for sympathy&mdash;it
was tragic, could one have felt it and not merely pretended to feel
it!</p>

<p>But in her yellow dress to-night she could not wring out one
drop more; she wanted it all, all for herself. She knew (she kept
on looking into the glass, dipping into that dreadfully showing-up
blue pool) that she was condemned, despised, left like this in a
backwater, because of her being like this a feeble, vacillating
creature; and it seemed to her that the yellow dress was a penance
which she had deserved, and if she had been dressed like Rose Shaw,
in lovely, clinging green with a ruffle of swansdown, she would
have deserved that; and she thought that there was no escape for
her&mdash;none whatever. But it was not her fault altogether, after
all. It was being one of a family of ten; never having money
enough, always skimping and paring; and her mother carrying great
cans, and the linoleum worn on the stair edges, and one sordid
little domestic tragedy after another&mdash;nothing catastrophic,
the sheep farm failing, but not utterly; her eldest brother
marrying beneath him but not very much&mdash;there was no romance,
nothing extreme about them all. They petered out respectably in
seaside resorts; every watering-place had one of her aunts even now
asleep in some lodging with the front windows not quite facing the
sea. That was so like them&mdash;they had to squint at things
always. And she had done the same&mdash;she was just like her
aunts. For all her dreams of living in India, married to some hero
like Sir Henry Lawrence, some empire builder (still the sight of a
native in a turban filled her with romance), she had failed
utterly. She had married Hubert, with his safe, permanent
underling's job in the Law Courts, and they managed tolerably in a
smallish house, without proper maids, and hash when she was alone
or just bread and butter, but now and then&mdash;Mrs. Holman was
off, thinking her the most dried-up, unsympathetic twig she had
ever met, absurdly dressed, too, and would tell every one about
Mabel's fantastic appearance&mdash;now and then, thought Mabel
Waring, left alone on the blue sofa, punching the cushion in order
to look occupied, for she would not join Charles Burt and Rose
Shaw, chattering like magpies and perhaps laughing at her by the
fireplace&mdash;now and then, there did come to her delicious
moments, reading the other night in bed, for instance, or down by
the sea on the sand in the sun, at Easter&mdash;let her recall
it&mdash;a great tuft of pale sand-grass standing all twisted like
a shock of spears against the sky, which was blue like a smooth
china egg, so firm, so hard, and then the melody of the
waves&mdash;"Hush, hush," they said, and the children's shouts
paddling&mdash;yes, it was a divine moment, and there she lay, she
felt, in the hand of the Goddess who was the world; rather a
hard-hearted, but very beautiful Goddess, a little lamb laid on the
altar (one did think these silly things, and it didn't matter so
long as one never said them). And also with Hubert sometimes she
had quite unexpectedly&mdash;carving the mutton for Sunday lunch,
for no reason, opening a letter, coming into a room&mdash;divine
moments, when she said to herself (for she would never say this to
anybody else), "This is it. This has happened. This is it!" And the
other way about it was equally surprising&mdash;that is, when
everything was arranged&mdash;music, weather, holidays, every
reason for happiness was there&mdash;then nothing happened at all.
One wasn't happy. It was flat, just flat, that was all.</p>

<p>Her wretched self again, no doubt! She had always been a
fretful, weak, unsatisfactory mother, a wobbly wife, lolling about
in a kind of twilight existence with nothing very clear or very
bold, or more one thing than another, like all her brothers and
sisters, except perhaps Herbert&mdash;they were all the same poor
water-veined creatures who did nothing. Then in the midst of this
creeping, crawling life, suddenly she was on the crest of a wave.
That wretched fly&mdash;where had she read the story that kept
coming into her mind about the fly and the saucer?&mdash;struggled
out. Yes, she had those moments. But now that she was forty, they
might come more and more seldom. By degrees she would cease to
struggle any more. But that was deplorable! That was not to be
endured! That made her feel ashamed of herself!</p>

<p>She would go to the London Library to-morrow. She would find
some wonderful, helpful, astonishing book, quite by chance, a book
by a clergyman, by an American no one had ever heard of; or she
would walk down the Strand and drop, accidentally, into a hall
where a miner was telling about the life in the pit, and suddenly
she would become a new person. She would be absolutely transformed.
She would wear a uniform; she would be called Sister Somebody; she
would never give a thought to clothes again. And for ever after she
would be perfectly clear about Charles Burt and Miss Milan and this
room and that room; and it would be always, day after day, as if
she were lying in the sun or carving the mutton. It would be
it!</p>

<p>So she got up from the blue sofa, and the yellow button in the
looking-glass got up too, and she waved her hand to Charles and
Rose to show them she did not depend on them one scrap, and the
yellow button moved out of the looking-glass, and all the spears
were gathered into her breast as she walked towards Mrs. Dalloway
and said "Good night."</p>

<p>"But it's top early to go," said Mrs. Dalloway, who was always
so charming.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I must," said Mabel Waring. "But," she added in her
weak, wobbly voice which only sounded ridiculous when she tried to
strengthen it, "I have enjoyed myself enormously."</p>

<p>"I have enjoyed myself," she said to Mr. Dalloway, whom she met
on the stairs.</p>

<p>"Lies, lies, lies!" she said to herself, going downstairs, and
"Right in the saucer!" she said to herself as she thanked Mrs.
Barnet for helping her and wrapped herself, round and round and
round, in the Chinese cloak she had worn these twenty years.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>MOMENTS OF BEING</h2>

<p><i>"Slater's pins have no points."</i>
</p>

<p>"Slater's pins have no points&mdash;don't you always find that?"
said Miss Craye, turning round as the rose fell out of Fanny
Wilmot's dress, and Fanny stooped, with her ears full of the music,
to look for the pin on the floor.</p>

<p>The words gave her an extraordinary shock, as Miss Craye struck
the last chord of the Bach fugue. Did Miss Craye actually go to
Slater's and buy pins then, Fanny Wilmot asked herself, transfixed
for a moment. Did she stand at the counter waiting like anybody
else, and was she given a bill with coppers wrapped in it, and did
she slip them into her purse and then, an hour later, stand by her
dressing table and take out the pins? What need had she of pins?
For she was not so much dressed as cased, like a beetle compactly
in its sheath, blue in winter, green in summer. What need had she
of pins&mdash;Julia Craye&mdash;who lived, it seemed in the cool
glassy world of Bach fugues, playing to herself what she liked, to
take one or two pupils at the one and only consenting Archer Street
College of Music (so the Principal, Miss Kingston, said) as a
special favour to herself, who had "the greatest admiration for her
in every way." Miss Craye was left badly off, Miss Kingston was
afraid, at her brother's death. Oh, they used to have such lovely
things, when they lived at Salisbury, and her brother Julius was,
of course, a very well-known man: a famous archaeologist. It was a
great privilege to stay with them, Miss Kingston said ("My family
had always known them&mdash;they were regular Canterbury people,"
Miss Kingston said), but a little frightening for a child; one had
to be careful not to slam the door or bounce into the room
unexpectedly. Miss Kingston, who gave little character sketches
like this on the first day of term while she received cheques and
wrote out receipts for them, smiled here. Yes, she had been rather
a tomboy; she had bounced in and set all those green Roman glasses
and things jumping in their case. The Crayes were not used to
children. The Crayes were none of them married. They kept cats; the
cats, one used to feel, knew as much about the Roman urns and
things as anybody.</p>

<p>"Far more than I did!" said Miss Kingston brightly, writing her
name across the stamp in her dashing, cheerful, full-bodied hand,
for she had always been practical. That was how she made her
living, after all.</p>

<p>Perhaps then, Fanny Wilmot thought, looking for the pin, Miss
Craye said that about "Slater's pins having no points," at a
venture. None of the Crayes had ever married. She knew nothing
about pins&mdash;nothing whatever. But she wanted to break the
spell that had fallen on the house; to break the pane of glass
which separated them from other people. When Polly Kingston, that
merry little girl, had slammed the door and made the Roman vases
jump, Julius, seeing that no harm was done (that would be his first
instinct) looked, for the case was stood in the window, at Polly
skipping home across the fields; looked with the look his sister
often had, that lingering, driving look.</p>

<p>"Stars, sun, moon," it seemed to say, "the daisy in the grass,
fires, frost on the window pane, my heart goes out to you. But," it
always seemed to add, "you break, you pass, you go." And
simultaneously it covered the intensity of both these states of
mind with "I can't reach you&mdash;I can't get at you," spoken
wistfully, frustratedly. And the stars faded, and the child went.
That was the kind of spell that was the glassy surface, that Miss
Craye wanted to break by showing, when she had played Bach
beautifully as a reward to a favourite pupil (Fanny Wilmot knew
that she was Miss Craye's favourite pupil), that she, too, knew,
like other people, about pins. Slater's pins had no points.</p>

<p>Yes, the "famous archaeologist" had looked like that too. "The
famous archaeologist"&mdash;as she said that, endorsing cheques,
ascertaining the day of the month, speaking so brightly and
frankly, there was in Miss Kingston's voice an indescribable tone
which hinted at something odd; something queer in Julius Craye; it
was the very same thing that was odd perhaps in Julia too. One
could have sworn, thought Fanny Wilmot, as she looked for the pin,
that at parties, meetings (Miss Kingston's father was a clergyman),
she had picked up some piece of gossip, or it might only have been
a smile, or a tone when his name was mentioned, which had given her
"a feeling" about Julius Craye. Needless to say, she had never
spoken about it to anybody. Probably she scarcely knew what she
meant by it. But whenever she spoke of Julius, or heard him
mentioned, that was the first thing that came to mind; and it was a
seductive thought; there was something odd about Julius Craye.</p>

<p>It was so that Julia looked too, as she sat half turned on the
music stool, smiling. It's on the field, it's on the pane, it's in
the sky&mdash;beauty; and I can't get at it; I can't have
it&mdash;I, she seemed to add, with that little clutch of the hand
which was so characteristic, who adore it so passionately, would
give the whole world to possess it! And she picked up the carnation
which had fallen on the floor, while Fanny searched for the pin.
She crushed it, Fanny felt, voluptuously in her smooth veined hands
stuck about with water-coloured rings set in pearls. The pressure
of her fingers seemed to increase all that was most brilliant in
the flower; to set it off; to make it more frilled, fresh,
immaculate. What was odd in her, and perhaps in her brother, too,
was that this crush and grasp of the finger was combined with a
perpetual frustration. So it was even now with the carnation. She
had her hands on it; she pressed it; but she did not possess it,
enjoy it, not entirely and altogether.</p>

<p>None of the Crayes had married, Fanny Wilmot remembered. She had
in mind how one evening when the lesson had lasted longer than
usual and it was dark, Julia Craye had said "it's the use of men,
surely, to protect us," smiling at her that same odd smile, as she
stood fastening her cloak, which made her, like the flower,
conscious to her finger tips of youth and brilliance, but, like the
flower, too, Fanny suspected, made her feel awkward.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I don't want protection," Fanny had laughed, and when
Julia Craye, fixing on her that extraordinary look, had said she
was not so sure of that, Fanny positively blushed under the
admiration in her eyes.</p>

<p>It was the only use of men, she had said. Was it for that reason
then, Fanny wondered, with her eyes on the floor, that she had
never married? After all, she had not lived all her life in
Salisbury. "Much the nicest part of London," she had said once,
"(but I'm speaking of fifteen or twenty years ago) is Kensington.
One was in the Gardens in ten minutes&mdash;it was like the heart
of the country. One could dine out in one's slippers without
catching cold. Kensington&mdash;it was like a village then, you
know," she had said.</p>

<p>Here she broke off, to denounce acridly the draughts in the
Tubes.</p>

<p>"It was the use of men," she had said, with a queer wry
acerbity. Did that throw any light on the problem why she had not
married? One could imagine every sort of scene in her youth, when
with her good blue eyes, her straight firm nose, her air of cool
distinction, her piano playing, her rose flowering with chaste
passion in the bosom of her muslin dress, she had attracted first
the young men to whom such things, the china tea cups and the
silver candlesticks and the inlaid table, for the Crayes had such
nice things, were wonderful; young men not sufficiently
distinguished; young men of the cathedral town with ambitions. She
had attracted them first, and then her brother's friends from
Oxford or Cambridge. They would come down in the summer; row her on
the river; continue the argument about Browning by letter; and
arrange perhaps, on the rare occasions when she stayed in London,
to show her Kensington Gardens?</p>

<p>"Much the nicest part of London&mdash;Kensington (I'm speaking
of fifteen or twenty years ago)," she had said once. One was in the
gardens in ten minutes&mdash;in the heart of the country. One could
make that yield what one liked, Fanny Wilmot thought, single out,
for instance, Mr. Sherman, the painter, an old friend of hers; make
him call for her, by appointment, one sunny day in June; take her
to have tea under the trees. (They had met, too, at those parties
to which one tripped in slippers without fear of catching cold.)
The aunt or other elderly relative was to wait there while they
looked at the Serpentine. They looked at the Serpentine. He may
have rowed her across. They compared it with the Avon. She would
have considered the comparison very furiously. Views of rivers were
important to her. She sat hunched a little, a little angular,
though she was graceful then, steering. At the critical moment, for
he had determined that he must speak now&mdash;it was his only
chance of getting her alone&mdash;he was speaking with his head
turned at an absurd angle, in his great nervousness, over his
shoulder&mdash;at that very moment she interrupted fiercely. He
would have them into the Bridge, she cried. It was a moment of
horror, of disillusionment, of revelation, for both of them. I
can't have it, I can't possess it, she thought. He could not see
why she had come then. With a great splash of his oar he pulled the
boat round. Merely to snub him? He rowed her back and said good-bye
to her.</p>

<p>The setting of that scene could be varied as one chose, Fanny
Wilmot reflected. (Where had that pin fallen?) It might be Ravenna;
or Edinburgh, where she had kept house for her brother. The scene
could be changed; and the young man and the exact manner of it all,
but one thing was constant&mdash;her refusal, and her frown, and
her anger with herself afterwards, and her argument, and her
relief&mdash;yes, certainly her immense relief. The very next day,
perhaps, she would get up at six, put on her cloak, and walk all
the way from Kensington to the river. She was so thankful that she
had not sacrificed her right to go and look at things when they are
at their best&mdash;before people are up, that is to say she could
have her breakfast in bed if she liked. She had not sacrificed her
independence.</p>

<p>Yes, Fanny Wilmot smiled, Julia had not endangered her habits.
They remained safe; and her habits would have suffered if she had
married. "They're ogres," she had said one evening, half laughing,
when another pupil, a girl lately married, suddenly bethinking her
that she would miss her husband, had rushed off in haste.</p>

<p>"They're ogres," she had said, laughing grimly. An ogre would
have interfered perhaps with breakfast in bed; with walks at dawn
down to the river. What would have happened (but one could hardly
conceive this) had she had children? She took astonishing
precautions against chills, fatigue, rich food, the wrong food,
draughts, heated rooms, journeys in the Tube. for she could never
determine which of these it was exactly that brought on those
terrible headaches that gave her life the semblance of a
battlefield. She was always engaged in outwitting the enemy, until
it seemed as if the pursuit had its interest; could she have beaten
the enemy finally she would have found life a little dull. As it
was, the tug-of-war was perpetual&mdash;on the one side the
nightingale or the view which she loved with passion&mdash;yes, for
views and birds she felt nothing less than passion; on the other
the damp path or the horrid long drag up a steep hill which would
certainly make her good for nothing next day and bring on one of
her headaches. When, therefore, from time to time, she managed her
forces adroitly and brought off a visit to Hampton Court the week
the crocuses&mdash;those glossy bright flowers were her
favourite&mdash;were at their best, it was a victory. It was
something that lasted; something that mattered for ever. She strung
the afternoon on the necklace of memorable days, which was not too
long for her to be able to recall this one or that one; this view,
that city; to finger it, to feel it, to savour, sighing, the
quality that made it unique.</p>

<p>"It was so beautiful last Friday," she said, "that I determined
I must go there." So she had gone off to Waterloo on her great
undertaking&mdash;to visit Hampton Court&mdash;alone. Naturally,
but perhaps foolishly, one pitied her for the thing she never asked
pity for (indeed she was reticent habitually, speaking of her
health only as a warrior might speak of his foe)&mdash;one pitied
her for always doing everything alone. Her brother was dead. Her
sister was asthmatic. She found the climate of Edinburgh good for
her. It was too bleak for Julia. Perhaps, too, she found the
associations painful, for her brother, the famous archaeologist,
had died there; and she had loved her brother. She lived in a
little house off the Brompton Road entirely alone.</p>

<p>Fanny Wilmot saw the pin; she picked it up. She looked at Miss
Craye. Was Miss Craye so lonely? No, Miss Craye was steadily,
blissfully, if only for that moment, a happy woman. Fanny had
surprised her in a moment of ecstasy. She sat there, half turned
away from the piano, with her hands clasped in her lap holding the
carnation upright, while behind her was the sharp square of the
window, uncurtained, purple in the evening, intensely purple after
the brilliant electric lights which burnt unshaded in the bare
music room. Julia Craye, sitting hunched and compact holding her
flower, seemed to emerge out of the London night, seemed to fling
it like a cloak behind her, it seemed, in its bareness and
intensity, the effluence of her spirit, something she had made
which surrounded her. Fanny stared.</p>

<p>All seemed transparent, for a moment, to the gaze of Fanny
Wilmot, as if looking through Miss Craye, she saw the very fountain
of her being spurting its pure silver drops. She saw back and back
into the past behind her. She saw the green Roman vases stood in
their case; heard the choristers playing cricket; saw Julia quietly
descend the curving steps on to the lawn; then saw her pour out tea
beneath the cedar tree; softly enclosed the old man's hand in hers;
saw her going round and about the corridors of that ancient
Cathedral dwelling place with towels in her hand to mark them;
lamenting, as she went, the pettiness of daily life; and slowly
ageing, and putting away clothes when summer came, because at her
age they were too bright to wear; and tending her father's
sickness; and cleaving her way ever more definitely as her will
stiffened towards her solitary goal; travelling frugally; counting
the cost and measuring out of her tight shut purse the sum needed
for this journey or for that old mirror; obstinately adhering,
whatever people might say, in choosing her pleasures for herself.
She saw Julia&mdash;</p>

<p>Julia blazed. Julia kindled. Out of the night she burnt like a
dead white star. Julia opened her arms. Julia kissed her on the
lips. Julia possessed it.</p>

<p>"Slater's pins have no points," Miss Craye said, laughing
queerly and relaxing her arms, as Fanny Wilmot pinned the flower to
her breast with trembling fingers.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>THE LADY IN THE LOOKING-GLASS</h2>

<p><i>A Reflection</i>
</p>

<p>People should not leave looking-glasses hanging in their rooms
any more than they should leave open cheque books or letters
confessing some hideous crime. One could not help looking, that
summer afternoon, in the long glass that hung outside in the hall.
Chance had so arranged it. From the depths of the sofa in the
drawing-room one could see reflected in the Italian glass not only
the marble-topped table opposite, but a stretch of the garden
beyond. One could see a long grass path leading between banks of
tall flowers until, slicing off an angle, the gold rim cut it
off.</p>

<p>The house was empty, and one felt, since one was the only person
in the drawing-room, like one of those naturalists who, covered
with grass and leaves, lie watching the shyest
animals&mdash;badgers, otters, kingfishers&mdash;moving about
freely, themselves unseen. The room that afternoon was full of such
shy creatures, lights and shadows, curtains blowing, petals
falling&mdash;things that never happen, so it seems, if someone is
looking. The quiet old country room with its rugs and stone chimney
pieces, its sunken book-cases and red and gold lacquer cabinets,
was full of such nocturnal creatures. They came pirouetting across
the floor, stepping delicately with high-lifted feet and spread
tails and pecking allusive beaks as if they had been cranes or
flocks of elegant flamingoes whose pink was faded, or peacocks
whose trains were veiled with silver. And there were obscure
flushes and darkenings too, as if a cuttlefish had suddenly
suffused the air with purple; and the room had its passions and
rages and envies and sorrows coming over it and clouding it, like a
human being. Nothing stayed the same for two seconds together.</p>

<p>But, outside, the looking-glass reflected the hall table, the
sunflowers, the garden path so accurately and so fixedly that they
seemed held there in their reality unescapably. It was a strange
contrast&mdash;all changing here, all stillness there. One could
not help looking from one to the other. Meanwhile, since all the
doors and windows were open in the heat, there was a perpetual
sighing and ceasing sound, the voice of the transient and the
perishing, it seemed, coming and going like human breath, while in
the looking-glass things had ceased to breathe and lay still in the
trance of immortality.</p>

<p>Half an hour ago the mistress of the house, Isabella Tyson, had
gone down the grass path in her thin summer dress, carrying a
basket, and had vanished, sliced off by the gilt rim of the
looking-glass. She had gone presumably into the lower garden to
pick flowers; or as it seemed more natural to suppose, to pick
something light and fantastic and leafy and trailing, travellers'
joy, or one of those elegant sprays of convolvulus that twine round
ugly walls and burst here and there into white and violet blossoms.
She suggested the fantastic and the tremulous convolvulus rather
than the upright aster, the starched zinnia, or her own burning
roses alight like lamps on the straight posts of their rose trees.
The comparison showed how very little, after all these years, one
knew about her; for it is impossible that any woman of flesh and
blood of fifty-five or sixty should be really a wreath or a
tendril. Such comparisons are worse than idle and
superficial&mdash;they are cruel even, for they come like the
convolvulus itself trembling between one's eyes and the truth.
There must be truth; there must be a wall. Yet it was strange that
after knowing her all these years one could not say what the truth
about Isabella was; one still made up phrases like this about
convolvulus and travellers' joy. As for facts, it was a fact that
she was a spinster; that she was rich; that she had bought this
house and collected with her own hands&mdash;often in the most
obscure corners of the world and at great risk from poisonous
stings and Oriental diseases&mdash;the rugs, the chairs, the
cabinets which now lived their nocturnal life before one's eyes.
Sometimes it seemed as if they knew more about her than we, who sat
on them, wrote at them, and trod on them so carefully, were allowed
to know. In each of these cabinets were many little drawers, and
each almost certainly held letters, tied with bows of ribbon,
sprinkled with sticks of lavender or rose leaves. For it was
another fact&mdash;if facts were what one wanted&mdash;that
Isabella had known many people, had had many friends; and thus if
one had the audacity to open a drawer and read her letters, one
would find the traces of many agitations, of appointments to meet,
of upbraidings for not having met, long letters of intimacy and
affection, violent letters of jealousy and reproach, terrible final
words of parting&mdash;for all those interviews and assignations
had led to nothing&mdash;that is, she had never married, and yet,
judging from the mask-like indifference of her face, she had gone
through twenty times more of passion and experience than those
whose loves are trumpeted forth for all the world to hear. Under
the stress of thinking about Isabella, her room became more shadowy
and symbolic; the corners seemed darker, the legs of chairs and
tables more spindly and hieroglyphic.</p>

<p>Suddenly these reflections were ended violently&mdash;and yet
without a sound. A large black form loomed into the looking-glass;
blotted out everything, strewed the table with a packet of marble
tablets veined with pink and grey, and was gone. But the picture
was entirely altered. For the moment it was unrecognizable and
irrational and entirely out of focus. One could not relate these
tablets to any human purpose. And then by degrees some logical
process set to work on them and began ordering and arranging them
and bringing them into the fold of common experience. One realized
at last that they were merely letters. The man had brought the
post.</p>

<p>There they lay on the marble-topped table, all dripping with
light and colour at first and crude and unabsorbed. And then it was
strange to see how they were drawn in and arranged and composed and
made part of the picture and granted that stillness and immortality
which the looking-glass conferred. They lay there invested with a
new reality and significance and with a greater heaviness, too, as
if it would have needed a chisel to dislodge them from the table.
And, whether it was fancy or not, they seemed to have become not
merely a handful of casual letters but to be tablets graven with
eternal truth&mdash;if one could read them, one would know
everything there was to be known about Isabella, yes, and about
life, too. The pages inside those marble-looking envelopes must be
cut deep and scored thick with meaning. Isabella would come in, and
take them, one by one, very slowly, and open them, and read them
carefully word by word, and then with a profound sigh of
comprehension, as if she had seen to the bottom of everything, she
would tear the envelopes to little bits and tie the letters
together and lock the cabinet drawer in her determination to
conceal what she did not wish to be known.</p>

<p>The thought served as a challenge. Isabella did not wish to be
known&mdash;but she should no longer escape. It was absurd, it was
monstrous. If she concealed so much and knew so much one must prise
her open with the first tool that came to hand&mdash;the
imagination. One must fix one's mind upon her at that very moment.
One must fasten her down there. One must refuse to be put off any
longer with sayings and doings such as the moment brought
forth&mdash;with dinners and visits and polite conversations. One
must put oneself in her shoes. If one took the phrase literally, it
was easy to see the shoes in which she stood, down in the lower
garden, at this moment. They were very narrow and long and
fashionable&mdash;they were made of the softest and most flexible
leather. Like everything she wore, they were exquisite. And she
would be standing under the high hedge in the lower part of the
garden, raising the scissors that were tied to her waist to cut
some dead flower, some overgrown branch. The sun would beat down on
her face, into her eyes; but no, at the critical moment a veil of
cloud covered the sun, making the expression of her eyes
doubtful&mdash;was it mocking or tender, brilliant or dull? One
could only see the indeterminate outline of her rather faded, fine
face looking at the sky. She was thinking, perhaps, that she must
order a new net for the strawberries; that she must send flowers to
Johnson's widow; that it was time she drove over to see the
Hippesleys in their new house. Those were the things she talked
about at dinner certainly. But one was tired of the things that she
talked about at dinner. It was her profounder state of being that
one wanted to catch and turn to words, the state that is to the
mind what breathing is to the body, what one calls happiness or
unhappiness. At the mention of those words it became obvious,
surely, that she must be happy. She was rich; she was
distinguished; she had many friends; she travelled&mdash;she bought
rugs in Turkey and blue pots in Persia. Avenues of pleasure
radiated this way and that from where she stood with her scissors
raised to cut the trembling branches while the lacy clouds veiled
her face.</p>

<p>Here with a quick movement of her scissors she snipped the spray
of travellers' joy and it fell to the ground. As it fell, surely
some light came in too, surely one could penetrate a little farther
into her being. Her mind then was filled with tenderness and
regret...To cut an overgrown branch saddened her because it had
once lived, and life was dear to her. Yes, and at the same time the
fall of the branch would suggest to her how she must die herself
and all the futility and evanescence of things. And then again
quickly catching this thought up, with her instant good sense, she
thought life had treated her well; even if fall she must, it was to
lie on the earth and moulder sweetly into the roots of violets. So
she stood thinking. Without making any thought precise&mdash;for
she was one of those reticent people whose minds hold their
thoughts enmeshed in clouds of silence&mdash;she was filled with
thoughts. Her mind was like her room, in which lights advanced and
retreated, came pirouetting and stepping delicately, spread their
tails, pecked their way; and then her whole being was suffused,
like the room again, with a cloud of some profound knowledge, some
unspoken regret, and then she was full of locked drawers, stuffed
with letters, like her cabinets. To talk of "prising her open" as
if she were an oyster, to use any but the finest and subtlest and
most pliable tools upon her was impious and absurd. One must
imagine&mdash;here was she in the looking-glass. It made one
start.</p>

<p>She was so far off at first that one could not see her clearly.
She came lingering and pausing, here straightening a rose, there
lifting a pink to smell it, but she never stopped; and all the time
she became larger and larger in the looking-glass, more and more
completely the person into whose mind one had been trying to
penetrate. One verified her by degrees&mdash;fitted the qualities
one had discovered into this visible body. There were her
grey-green dress, and her long shoes, her basket, and something
sparkling at her throat. She came so gradually that she did not
seem to derange the pattern in the glass, but only to bring in some
new element which gently moved and altered the other objects as if
asking them, courteously, to make room for her. And the letters and
the table and the grass walk and the sunflowers which had been
waiting in the looking-glass separated and opened out so that she
might be received among them. At last there she was, in the hall.
She stopped dead. She stood by the table. She stood perfectly
still. At once the lookingglass began to pour over her a light that
seemed to fix her; that seemed like some acid to bite off the
unessential and superficial and to leave only the truth. It was an
enthralling spectacle. Everything dropped from her&mdash;clouds,
dress, basket, diamond&mdash;all that one had called the creeper
and convolvulus. Here was the hard wall beneath. Here was the woman
herself. She stood naked in that pitiless light. And there was
nothing. Isabella was perfectly empty. She had no thoughts. She had
no friends. She cared for nobody. As for her letters, they were all
bills. Look, as she stood there, old and angular, veined and lined,
with her high nose and her wrinkled neck, she did not even trouble
to open them.</p>

<p>People should not leave looking-glasses hanging in their
rooms.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>THE SHOOTING PARTY</h2>

<p>She got in and put her suit case in the rack, and the brace of
pheasants on top of it. Then she sat down in the corner. The train
was rattling through the midlands, and the fog, which came in when
she opened the door, seemed to enlarge the carriage and set the
four travellers apart. Obviously M. M.&mdash;those were the
initials on the suit case&mdash;had been staying the week-end with
a shooting party. Obviously, for she was telling over the story
now, lying back in her corner. She did not shut her eyes. But
clearly she did not see the man opposite, nor the coloured
photograph of York Minster. She must have heard, too, what they had
been saying. For as she gazed, her lips moved; now and then she
smiled. And she was handsome; a cabbage rose; a russet apple;
tawny; but scarred on the jaw&mdash;the scar lengthened when she
smiled. Since she was telling over the story she must have been a
guest there, and yet, dressed as she was out of fashion as women
dressed, years ago, in pictures, in sporting newspapers, she did
not seem exactly a guest, nor yet a maid. Had she had a basket with
her she would have been the woman who breeds fox terriers; the
owner of the Siamese cat; some one connected with hounds and
horses. But she had only a suit case and the pheasants. Somehow,
therefore, she must have wormed her way into the room that she was
seeing through the stuffing of the carriage, and the man's bald
head, and the picture of York Minster. And she must have listened
to what they were saying, for now, like somebody imitating the
noise that someone else makes, she made a little click at the back
of her throat. "Chk." Then she smiled.</p>

<p>"Chk," said Miss Antonia, pinching her glasses on her nose. The
damp leaves fell across the long windows of the gallery; one or two
stuck, fish shaped, and lay like inlaid brown wood upon the window
panes. Then the trees in the Park shivered, and the leaves,
flaunting down, seemed to make the shiver visible&mdash;the damp
brown shiver.</p>

<p>"Chk." Miss Antonia sniffed again, and pecked at the flimsy
white stuff that she held in her hands, as a hen pecks nervously
rapidly at a piece of white bread.</p>

<p>The wind sighed. The room was draughty. The doors did not fit,
nor the windows. Now and then a ripple, like a reptile, ran under
the carpet. On the carpet lay panels of green and yellow, where the
sun rested, and then the sun moved and pointed a finger as if in
mockery at a hole in the carpet and stopped. And then on it went,
the sun's feeble but impartial finger, and lay upon the coat of
arms over the fireplace&mdash;gently illumined&mdash;the shield,
the pendant grapes, the mermaid, and the spears. Miss Antonia
looked up as the light strengthened. Vast lands, so they said, the
old people had owned&mdash;her forefathers&mdash;the Rashleighs.
Over there. Up the Amazons. Freebooter. Voyagers. Sacks of
emeralds. Nosing round the island. Taking captives. Maidens. There
she was, all scales from the tail to the waist. Miss Antonia
grinned. Down struck the finger of the sun and her eye went with
it. Now it rested on a silver frame; on a photograph; on an
egg-shaped baldish head, on a lip that stuck out under the
moustache; and the name "Edward" written with a flourish
beneath.</p>

<p>"The King..." Miss Antonia muttered, turning the film of white
upon her knee&mdash;"had the Blue Room," she added with a toss of
her head as the light faded.</p>

<p>Out in the King's Ride the pheasants were being driven across
the noses of the guns. Up they spurted from the underwood like
heavy rockets, reddish purple rockets, and as they rose the guns
cracked in order, eagerly, sharply, as if a line of dogs had
suddenly barked. Tufts of white smoke held together for a moment;
then gently solved themselves, faded, and dispersed.</p>

<p>In the deep cut road beneath the hanger, a cart stood, laid
already with soft warm bodies, with limp claws, and still lustrous
eyes. The birds seemed alive still, but swooning under their rich
damp feathers. They looked relaxed and comfortable, stirring
slightly, as if they slept upon a warm bank of soft feathers on the
floor of the cart.</p>

<p>Then the Squire, with the hang-dog stained face, in the shabby
gaiters, cursed and raised his gun.</p>

<p>Miss Antonia stitched on. Now and then a tongue of flame reached
round the grey log that stretched from one bar to another across
the grate, ate it greedily, then died out, leaving a white bracelet
where the bark had been eaten off. Miss Antonia looked up for a
moment, stared wide eyed, instinctively, as a dog stares at a
flame. Then the flame sank and she stitched again.</p>

<p>Then, silently, the enormously high door opened. Two lean men
came in, and drew a table over the hole in the carpet. They went
out; they came in. They laid a cloth upon the table. They went out;
they came in. They brought a green baize basket of knives and
forks; and glasses; and sugar casters; and salt cellars; and bread;
and a silver vase with three chrysanthemums in it. And the table
was laid. Miss Antonia stitched on.</p>

<p>Again the door opened, pushed feebly this time. A little dog
trotted in, a spaniel nosing nimbly; it paused. The door stood
open. And then, leaning on her stick, heavily, old Miss Rashleigh
entered. A white shawl, diamond fastened, clouded her baldness. She
hobbled; crossed the room; hunched herself in the high-backed chair
by the fireside. Miss Antonia went on stitching.</p>

<p>"Shooting," she said at last.</p>

<p>Old Miss Rashleigh nodded. She gripped her stick. They sat
waiting.</p>

<p>The shooters had moved now from the King's Ride to the Home
Woods. They stood in the purple ploughed field outside. Now and
then a twig snapped; leaves came whirling. But above the mist and
the smoke was an island of blue&mdash;faint blue, pure
blue&mdash;alone in the sky. And in the innocent air, as if
straying alone like a cherub, a bell from a far hidden steeple
frolicked, gambolled, then faded. Then again up shot the rockets,
the reddish purple pheasants. Up and up they went. Again the guns
barked; the smoke balls formed; loosened, dispersed. And the busy
little dogs ran nosing nimbly over the fields; and the warm damp
bodies, still languid and soft, as if in a swoon, were bunched
together by the men in gaiters and flung into the cart.</p>

<p>"There!" grunted Milly Masters, the house-keeper, throwing down
her glasses. She was stitching, too, in the small dark room that
overlooked the stable yard. The jersey, the rough woollen jersey,
for her son, the boy who cleaned the Church, was finished. "The end
'o that!" she muttered. Then she heard the cart. Wheels ground on
the cobbles. Up she got. With her hands to her hair, her chestnut
coloured hair, she stood in the yard, in the wind.</p>

<p>"Coming!" she laughed, and the scar on her cheek lengthened. She
unbolted the door of the game room as Wing, the keeper, drove the
cart over the cobbles. The birds were dead now, their claws gripped
tight, though they gripped nothing. The leathery eyelids were
creased greyly over their eyes. Mrs. Masters the housekeeper, Wing
the gamekeeper, took bunches of dead birds by the neck and flung
them down on the slate floor of the game larder. The slate floor
became smeared and spotted with blood. The pheasants looked smaller
now, as if their bodies had shrunk together. Then Wing lifted the
tail of the cart and drove in the pins which secured it. The sides
of the cart were stuck about with little grey-blue feathers, and
the floor was smeared and stained with blood. But it was empty.</p>

<p>"The last of the lot!" Milly Masters grinned as the cart drove
off.</p>

<p>"Luncheon is served, ma'am," said the butler. He pointed at the
table; he directed the footman. The dish with the silver cover was
placed precisely there where he pointed. They waited, the butler
and the footman.</p>

<p>Miss Antonia laid her white film upon the basket; put away her
silk; her thimble; stuck her needle through a piece of flannel; and
hung her glasses on a hook upon her breast. Then she rose.</p>

<p>"Luncheon!" she barked in old Miss Rashleigh's ear. One second
later old Miss Rashleigh stretched her leg out; gripped her stick;
and rose too. Both old women advanced slowly to the table; and were
tucked in by the butler and the footman, one at this end, one at
that. Off came the silver cover. And there was the pheasant,
featherless, gleaming; the thighs tightly pressed to its side; and
little mounds of breadcrumbs were heaped at either end.</p>

<p>Miss Antonia drew the carving knife across the pheasant's breast
firmly. She cut two slices and laid them on a plate. Deftly the
footman whipped it from her, and old Miss Rashleigh raised her
knife. Shots rang out in the wood under the window.</p>

<p>"Coming?" said old Miss Rashleigh, suspending her fork.</p>

<p>The branches flung and flaunted on the trees in the Park.</p>

<p>She took a mouthful of pheasant. Falling leaves flicked the
window pane; one or two stuck to the glass.</p>

<p>"The Home Woods, now," said Miss Antonia. "Hugh's lost that."
"Shooting." She drew her knife down the other side of the breast.
She added potatoes and gravy, brussel sprouts and bread sauce
methodically in a circle round the slices on her plate. The butler
and the footman stood watching, like servers at a feast. The old
ladies ate quietly; silently; nor did they hurry themselves;
methodically they cleaned the bird. Bones only were left on their
plates. Then the butler drew the decanter towards Miss Antonia, and
paused for a moment with his head bent.</p>

<p>"Give it here, Griffiths," said Miss Antonia, and took the
carcase in her fingers and tossed it to the spaniel beneath the
table. The butler and the footman bowed and went out.</p>

<p>"Coming closer," said Miss Rashleigh, listening. The wind was
rising. A brown shudder shook the air; leaves flew too fast to
stick. The glass rattled in the windows.</p>

<p>"Birds wild," Miss Antonia nodded, watching the
helter-skelter.</p>

<p>Old Miss Rashleigh filled her glass. As they sipped their eyes
became lustrous like half precious stones held to the light. Slate
blue were Miss Rashleigh's; Miss Antonia's red, like port. And
their laces and their flounces seemed to quiver, as if their bodies
were warm and languid underneath their feathers as they drank.</p>

<p>"It was a day like this, d'you remember?" said old Miss
Rashleigh, fingering her glass. "They brought him home&mdash;a
bullet through his heart. A bramble, so they said. Tripped. Caught
his foot..." She chuckled as she sipped her wine.</p>

<p>"And John..." said Miss Antonia. "The mare, they said, put her
foot in a hole. Died in the field. The hunt rode over him. He came
home, too, on a shutter...They sipped again.</p>

<p>"Remember Lily?" said old Miss Rashleigh. "A bad 'un." She shook
her head. "Riding with a scarlet tassel on her cane..."</p>

<p>"Rotten at the heart!" cried Miss Antonia.</p>

<p>"Remember the Colonel's letter. Your son rode as if he had
twenty devils in him&mdash;charged at the head of his men. Then one
white devil&mdash;ah hah!" She sipped again.</p>

<p>"The men of our house," began Miss Rashleigh. She raised her
glass. She held it high, as if she toasted the mermaid carved in
plaster on the fireplace. She paused. The guns were barking.
Something cracked in the woodwork. Or was it a rat running behind
the plaster?</p>

<p>"Always women..." Miss Antonia nodded. "The men of our house.
Pink and white Lucy at the Mill&mdash;d'you remember?"</p>

<p>"Ellen's daughter at the Goat and Sickle," Miss Rashleigh
added.</p>

<p>"And the girl at the tailor's," Miss Antonia murmured, "where
Hugh bought his riding breeches, the little dark shop on the
right..."</p>

<p>"...that used to be flooded every winter. It's his boy," Miss
Antonia chuckled, leaning towards her sister, "that cleans the
Church."</p>

<p>There was a crash. A slate had fallen down the chimney. The
great log had snapped in two. Flakes of plaster fell from the
shield above the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Falling," old Miss Rashleigh chuckled. "Falling."</p>

<p>"And who," said Miss Antonia, looking at the flakes on the
carpet, "who's to pay?"</p>

<p>Crowing like old babies, indifferent, reckless, they laughed;
crossed to the fireplace, and sipped the sherry by the wood ashes
and the plaster, until each glass held only one drop of wine,
reddish purple, at the bottom. And this the old women did not wish
to part with, so it seemed; for they fingered their glasses, as
they sat side by side by the ashes; but they never raised them to
their lips.</p>

<p>"Milly Masters in the still room," began old Miss Rashleigh.
"She's our brother's..."</p>

<p>A shot barked beneath the window. It cut the string that held
the rain. Down it poured, down, down, down, in straight rods
whipping the windows. Light faded from the carpet. Light faded in
their eyes, too, as they sat by the white ashes listening. Their
eyes became like pebbles, taken from water; grey stones dulled and
dried. And their hands gripped their hands like the claws of dead
birds gripping nothing. And they shrivelled as if the bodies inside
the clothes had shrunk.</p>

<p>Then Miss Antonia raised her glass to the mermaid. It was the
last drop; she drank it off. "Coming!" she croaked, and slapped the
glass down. A door banged below. Then another. Then another. Feet
could be heard trampling, yet shuffling, along the corridor towards
the gallery.</p>

<p>"Closer! Closer!" grinned Miss Rashleigh, baring her three
yellow teeth.</p>

<p>The immensely high door burst open. In rushed three great hounds
and stood panting. Then there entered, slouching, the Squire
himself in shabby gaiters. The dogs pressed round him, tossing
their heads, snuffling at his pockets. Then they bounded forward.
They smelt the meat. The floor of the gallery waved like a
windlashed forest with the tails and backs of the great questing
hounds. They snuffed the table. They pawed the cloth. Then, with a
wild neighing whimper, they flung themselves upon the little yellow
spaniel who was gnawing the carcass under the table.</p>

<p>"Curse you, curse you!" howled the Squire. But his voice was
weak, as if he shouted against a wind. "Curse you, curse you!" he
shouted, now cursing his sisters.</p>

<p>Miss Antonia and Miss Rashleigh rose to their feet. The great
dogs had seized the spaniel. They worried him, they mauled him with
their great yellow teeth. The Squire swung a leather knotted tawse
this way and that way, cursing the dogs, cursing his sisters, in
the voice that sounded so loud yet so weak. With one lash he curled
to the ground the vase of chrysanthemums. Another caught old Miss
Rashleigh on the cheek. The old woman staggered backwards. She fell
against the mantelpiece. Her stick, striking wildly, struck the
shield above the fireplace. She fell with a thud upon the ashes.
The shield of the Rashleighs crashed from the wall. Under the
mermaid, under the spears, she lay buried.</p>

<p>The wind lashed the panes of glass; shots volleyed in the Park
and a tree fell. And then King Edward, in the silver frame, slid,
toppled, and fell too.</p>

<p>The grey mist had thickened in the carriage. It hung down like a
veil; it seemed to put the four travellers in the corners at a
great distance from each other, though in fact they were as close
as a third class railway carriage could bring them. The effect was
strange. The handsome, if elderly, the well dressed, if rather
shabby woman, who had got into the train at some station in the
midlands, seemed to have lost her shape. Her body had become all
mist. Only her eyes gleamed, changed, lived all by themselves, it
seemed; eyes without a body; eyes seeing something invisible. In
the misty air they shone out, they moved, so that in the sepulchral
atmosphere&mdash;the windows were blurred, the lamps haloed with
fog&mdash;they were like lights dancing, will o' the wisps that
move, people say, over the graves of unquiet sleepers in
churchyards. An absurd idea? Mere fancy! Yet after all, since there
is nothing that does not leave some residue, and memory is a light
that dances in the mind when the reality is buried, why should not
the eyes there, gleaming, moving, be the ghost of a family, of an
age, of a civilization dancing over the grave?</p>

<p>The train slowed down. Lamps stood up. They were felled. Up they
stood again as the train slid into the station. The lights blazed.
And the eyes in the corner? They were shut. Perhaps the light was
too strong. And of course in the full blaze of the station lamps it
was plain&mdash;she was quite an ordinary, rather elderly, woman,
travelling to London on some ordinary piece of
business&mdash;something connected with a cat, or a horse, or a
dog. She reached for her suit case, rose, and took the pheasants
from the rack. But did she, all the same, as she opened the
carriage door and stepped out, murmur "Chk, Chk." as she
passed?</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>THE DUCHESS AND THE JEWELLER</h2>

<p>Oliver Bacon lived at the top of a house overlooking the Green
Park. He had a flat; chairs jutted out at the right
angles&mdash;chairs covered in hide. Sofas filled the bays of the
windows&mdash;sofas covered in tapestry. The windows, the three
long windows, had the proper allowance of discreet net and figured
satin. The mahogany sideboard bulged discreetly with the right
brandies, whiskeys and liqueurs. And from the middle window he
looked down upon the glossy roofs of fashionable cars packed in the
narrow straits of Piccadilly. A more Central position could not be
imagined. And at eight in the morning he would have his breakfast
brought in on a tray by a man-servant: the man-servant would unfold
his crimson dressing-gown; he would rip his letters open with his
long pointed nails and would extract thick white cards of
invitation upon which the engraving stood up roughly from
duchesses, countesses, viscountesses and Honourable Ladies. Then he
would wash; then he would eat his toast; then he would read his
paper by the bright burning fire of electric coals.</p>

<p>"Behold Oliver," he would say, addressing himself. "You who
began life in a filthy little alley, you who..." and he would look
down at his legs, so shapely in their perfect trousers; at his
boots; at his spats. They were all shapely, shining; cut from the
best cloth by the best scissors in Savile Row. But he dismantled
himself often and became again a little boy in a dark alley. He had
once thought that the height of his ambition&mdash;selling stolen
dogs to fashionable women in Whitechapel. And once he had been
done. "Oh, Oliver," his mother had wailed. "Oh, Oliver! When will
you have sense, my son?"...Then he had gone behind a counter; had
sold cheap watches; then he had taken a wallet to Amsterdam...At
that memory he would churckle&mdash;the old Oliver remembering the
young. Yes, he had done well with the three diamonds; also there
was the commission on the emerald. After that he went into the
private room behind the shop in Hatton Garden; the room with the
scales, the safe, the thick magnifying glasses. And then...and
then...He chuckled. When he passed through the knots of jewellers
in the hot evening who were discussing prices, gold mines,
diamonds, reports from South Africa, one of them would lay a finger
to the side of his nose and murmur, "Hum&mdash;m&mdash;m," as he
passed. It was no more than a murmur; no more than a nudge on the
shoulder, a finger on the nose, a buzz that ran through the cluster
of jewellers in Hatton Garden on a hot afternoon&mdash;oh, many
years ago now! But still Oliver felt it purring down his spine, the
nudge, the murmur that meant, "Look at him&mdash;young Oliver, the
young jeweller&mdash;there he goes." Young he was then. And he
dressed better and better; and had, first a hansom cab; then a car;
and first he went up to the dress circle, then down into the
stalls. And he had a villa at Richmond, overlooking the river, with
trellises of red roses; and Mademoiselle used to pick one every
morning and stick it in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>"So," said Oliver Bacon, rising and stretching his legs.
"<i>So</i>..."</p>

<p>And he stood beneath the picture of an old lady on the
mantelpiece and raised his hands. "I have kept my word," he said,
laying his hands together, palm to palm, as if he were doing homage
to her. "I have won my bet." That was so; he was the richest
jeweller in England; but his nose, which was long and flexible,
like an elephant's trunk, seemed to say by its curious quiver at
the nostrils (but it seemed as if the whole nose quivered, not only
the nostrils) that he was not satisfied yet; still smelt something
under the ground a little further off. Imagine a giant hog in a
pasture rich with truffles; after unearthing this truffle and that,
still it smells a bigger, a blacker truffle under the ground
further off. So Oliver snuffed always in the rich earth of Mayfair
another truffle, a blacker, a bigger further off.</p>

<p>Now then he straightened the pearl in his tie, cased himself in
his smart blue overcoat; took his yellow gloves and his cane; and
swayed as he descended the stairs and half snuffed, half sighed
through his long sharp nose as he passed out into Piccadilly. For
was he not still a sad man, a dissatisfied man, a man who seeks
something that is hidden, though he had won his bet?</p>

<p>He swayed slightly as he walked, as the camel at the zoo sways
from side to side when it walks along the asphalt paths laden with
grocers and their wives eating from paper bags and throwing little
bits of silver paper crumpled up on to the path. The camel despises
the grocers; the camel is dissatisfied with its lot; the camel sees
the blue lake and the fringe of palm trees in front of it. So the
great jeweller, the greatest jeweller in the whole world, swung
down Piccadilly, perfectly dressed, with his gloves, with his cane;
but dissatisfied still, till he reached the dark little shop, that
was famous in France, in Germany, in Austria, in Italy, and all
over America&mdash;the dark little shop in the street off Bond
Street.</p>

<p>As usual, he strode through the shop without speaking, though
the four men, the two old men, Marshall and Spencer, and the two
young men, Hammond and Wicks, stood straight and looked at him,
envying him. It was only with one finger of the amber-coloured
glove, waggling, that he acknowledged their presence. And he went
in and shut the door of his private room behind him.</p>

<p>Then he unlocked the grating that barred the window. The cries
of Bond Street came in; the purr of the distant traffic. The light
from reflectors at the back of the shop struck upwards. One tree
waved six green leaves, for it was June. But Mademoiselle had
married Mr. Pedder of the local brewery&mdash;no one stuck roses in
his buttonhole now.</p>

<p>"So," he half sighed, half snorted, "so&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he touched a spring in the wall and slowly the panelling
slid open, and behind it were the steel safes, five, no, six of
them, all of burnished steel. He twisted a key; unlocked one; then
another. Each was lined with a pad of deep crimson velvet; in each
lay jewels&mdash;bracelets, necklaces, rings, tiaras, ducal
coronets; loose stones in glass shells; rubies, emeralds, pearls,
diamonds. All safe, shining, cool, yet burning, eternally, with
their own compressed light.</p>

<p>"Tears!" said Oliver, looking at the pearls.</p>

<p>"Heart's blood!" he said, looking at the rubies.</p>

<p>"Gunpowder!" he continued, rattling the diamonds so that they
flashed and blazed.</p>

<p>"Gunpowder enough to blow Mayfair&mdash;sky high, high, high!"
He threw his head back and made a sound like a horse neighing as he
said it.</p>

<p>The telephone buzzed obsequiously in a low muted voice on his
table. He shut the safe.</p>

<p>"In ten minutes," he said. "Not before." And he sat down at his
desk and looked at the heads of the Roman emperors that were graved
on his sleeve links. And again he dismantled himself and became
once more the little boy playing marbles in the alley where they
sell stolen dogs on Sunday. He became that wily astute little boy,
with lips like wet cherries. He dabbled his fingers in ropes of
tripe; he dipped them in pans of frying fish; he dodged in and out
among the crowds. He was slim, lissome, with eyes like licked
stones. And now&mdash;now&mdash;the hands of the clock ticked on,
one two, three, four...The Duchess of Lambourne waited his
pleasure; the Duchess of Lambourne, daughter of a hundred Earls.
She would wait for ten minutes on a chair at the counter. She would
wait his pleasure. She would wait till he was ready to see her. He
watched the clock in its shagreen case. The hand moved on. With
each tick the clock handed him&mdash;so it seemed&mdash;<i>pate de
foie gras</i>, a glass of champagne, another of fine brandy, a
cigar costing one guinea. The clock laid them on the table beside
him as the ten minutes passed. Then he heard soft slow footsteps
approaching; a rustle in the corridor. The door opened. Mr. Hammond
flattened himself against the wall.</p>

<p>"Her Grace!" he announced.</p>

<p>And he waited there, flattened against the wall.</p>

<p>And Oliver, rising, could hear the rustle of the dress of the
Duchess as she came down the passage. Then she loomed up, filling
the door, filling the room with the aroma, the prestige, the
arrogance, the pomp, the pride of all the Dukes and Duchesses
swollen in one wave. And as a wave breaks, she broke, as she sat
down, spreading and splashing and falling over Oliver Bacon, the
great jeweller, covering him with sparkling bright colours, green,
rose, violet; and odours; and iridescences; and rays shooting from
fingers, nodding from plumes, flashing from silk; for she was very
large, very fat, tightly girt in pink taffeta, and past her prime.
As a parasol with many flounces, as a peacock with many feathers,
shuts its flounces, folds its feathers, so she subsided and shut
herself as she sank down in the leather armchair.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Bacon," said the Duchess. And she held out
her hand which came through the slit of her white glove. And Oliver
bent low as he shook it. And as their hands touched the link was
forged between them once more. They were friends, yet enemies; he
was master, she was mistress; each cheated the other, each needed
the other, each feared the other, each felt this and knew this
every time they touched hands thus in the little back room with the
white light outside, and the tree with its six leaves, and the
sound of the street in the distance and behind them the safes.</p>

<p>"And to-day, Duchess&mdash;what can I do for you to-day?" said
Oliver, very softly.</p>

<p>The Duchess opened her heart, her private heart, gaped wide. And
with a sigh but no words she took from her bag a long washleather
pouch&mdash;it looked like a lean yellow ferret. And from a slit in
the ferret's belly she dropped pearls&mdash;ten pearls. They rolled
from the slit in the ferret's belly&mdash;one, two, three,
four&mdash;like the eggs of some heavenly bird.</p>

<p>"All's that's left me, dear Mr. Bacon," she moaned. Five, six,
seven&mdash;down they rolled, down the slopes of the vast mountain
sides that fell between her knees into one narrow valley&mdash;the
eighth, the ninth, and the tenth. There they lay in the glow of the
peach-blossom taffeta. Ten pearls.</p>

<p>"From the Appleby cincture," she mourned. "The last...the last
of them all."</p>

<p>Oliver stretched out and took one of the pearls between finger
and thumb. It was round, it was lustrous. But real was it, or
false? Was she lying again? Did she dare?</p>

<p>She laid her plump padded finger across her lips. "If the Duke
knew..." she whispered. "Dear Mr. Bacon, a bit of bad luck..."</p>

<p>Been gambling again, had she?</p>

<p>"That villain! That sharper!" she hissed.</p>

<p>The man with the chipped cheek bone? A bad 'un. And the Duke was
straight as a poker; with side whiskers; would cut her off, shut
her up down there if he knew&mdash;what I know, thought Oliver, and
glanced at the safe.</p>

<p>"Araminta, Daphne, Diana," she moaned. "It's for
<i>them</i>."</p>

<p>The ladies Araminta, Daphne, Diana&mdash;her daughters. He knew
them; adored them. But it was Diana he loved.</p>

<p>"You have all my secrets," she leered. Tears slid; tears fell;
tears, like diamonds, collecting powder in the ruts of her cherry
blossom cheeks.</p>

<p>"Old friend," she murmured, "old friend."</p>

<p>"Old friend," he repeated, "old friend," as if he licked the
words.</p>

<p>"How much?" he queried.</p>

<p>She covered the pearls with her hand.</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand," she whispered.</p>

<p>But was it real or false, the one he held in his hand? The
Appleby cincture&mdash;hadn't she sold it already? He would ring
for Spencer or Hammond. "Take it and test it," he would say. He
stretched to the bell.</p>

<p>"You will come down to-morrow?" she urged, she interrupted. "The
Prime Minister&mdash;His Royal Highness..." She stopped. "And
Diana..." she added.</p>

<p>Oliver took his hand off the bell.</p>

<p>He looked past her, at the backs of the houses in Bond Street.
But he saw, not the houses in Bond Street, but a dimpling river;
and trout rising and salmon; and the Prime Minister; and himself
too, in white waistcoat; and then, Diana. He looked down at the
pearl in his hand. But how could he test it, in the light of the
river, in the light of the eyes of Diana? But the eyes of the
Duchess were on him.</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand," she moaned. "My honour!"</p>

<p>The honour of the mother of Diana! He drew his cheque book
towards him; he took out his pen.</p>

<p>"Twenty&mdash;" he wrote. Then he stopped writing. The eyes of
the old woman in the picture were on him&mdash;of the old woman his
mother.</p>

<p>"Oliver!" she warned him. "Have sense! Don't be a fool!"</p>

<p>"Oliver!" the Duchess entreated&mdash;it was "Oliver" now, not
"Mr. Bacon." "You'll come for a long weekend?"</p>

<p>Alone in the woods with Diana! Riding alone in the woods with
Diana!</p>

<p>"Thousand," he wrote, and signed it.</p>

<p>"Here you are," he said.</p>

<p>And there opened all the flounces of the parasol, all the plumes
of the peacock, the radiance of the wave, the swords and spears of
Agincourt, as she rose from her chair. And the two old men and the
two young men, Spencer and Marshall, Wicks and Hammond, flattened
themselves behind the counter envying him as he led her through the
shop to the door. And he waggled his yellow glove in their faces,
and she held her honour&mdash;a cheque for twenty thousand pounds
with his signature&mdash;quite firmly in her hands.</p>

<p>"Are they false or are they real?" asked Oliver, shutting his
private door. There they were, ten pearls on the blotting-paper on
the table. He took them to the window. He held them under his lens
to the light...This, then, was the truffle he had routed out of the
earth! Rotten at the centre&mdash;rotten at the core!</p>

<p>"Forgive me, oh, my mother!" he sighed, raising his hand as if
he asked pardon of the old woman in the picture. And again he was a
little boy in the alley where they sold dogs on Sunday.</p>

<p>"For," he murmured, laying the palms of his hands together, "it
is to be a long week-end."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>LAPPIN AND LAPPINOVA</h2>

<p>They were married. The wedding march pealed out. The pigeons
fluttered. Small boys in Eton jackets threw rice; a fox terrier
sauntered across the path; and Ernest Thorburn led his bride to the
car through that small inquisitive crowd of complete strangers
which always collects in London to enjoy other people's happiness
or unhappiness. Certainly he looked handsome and she looked shy.
More rice was thrown, and the car moved off.</p>

<p>That was on Tuesday. Now it was Saturday. Rosalind had still to
get used to the fact that she was Mrs. Ernest Thorburn. Perhaps she
never would get used to the fact that she was Mrs. Ernest Anybody,
she thought, as she sat in the bow window of the hotel looking over
the lake to the mountains, and waited for her husband to come down
to breakfast. Ernest was a difficult name to get used to. It was
not the name she would have chosen. She would have preferred
Timothy, Antony, or Peter. He did not look like Ernest either. The
name suggested the Albert Memorial, mahogany sideboards, steel
engravings of the Prince Consort with his family&mdash;her
mother-in-law's dining-room in Porchester Terrace in short.</p>

<p>But here he was. Thank goodness he did not look like
Ernest&mdash;no. But what did he look like? She glanced at him
sideways. Well, when he was eating toast he looked like a rabbit.
Not that anyone else would have seen a likeness to a creature so
diminutive and timid in this spruce, muscular young man with the
straight nose, the blue eyes, and the very firm mouth. But that
made it all the more amusing. His nose twitched very slightly when
he ate. So did her pet rabbit's. She kept watching his nose twitch;
and then she had to explain, when he caught her looking at him, why
she laughed.</p>

<p>"It's because you're like a rabbit, Ernest," she said. "Like a
wild rabbit," she added, looking at him. "A hunting rabbit; a King
Rabbit; a rabbit that makes laws for all the other rabbits."</p>

<p>Ernest had no objection to being that kind of rabbit, and since
it amused her to see him twitch his nose&mdash;he had never known
that his nose twitched&mdash;he twitched it on purpose. And she
laughed and laughed; and he laughed too, so that the maiden ladies
and the fishing man and the Swiss waiter in his greasy black jacket
all guessed right; they were very happy. But how long does such
happiness last? they asked themselves; and each answered according
to his own circumstances.</p>

<p>At lunch time, seated on a clump of heather beside the lake,
"Lettuce, rabbit?" said Rosalind, holding out the lettuce that had
been provided to eat with the hardboiled eggs. "Come and take it
out of my hand," she added, and he stretched out and nibbled the
lettuce and twitched his nose.</p>

<p>"Good rabbit, nice rabbit," she said, patting him, as she used
to pat her tame rabbit at home. But that was absurd. He was not a
tame rabbit, whatever he was. She turned it into French. "Lapin,"
she called him. But whatever he was, he was not a French rabbit. He
was simply and solely English-born at Porchester Terrace, educated
at Rugby; now a clerk in His Majesty's Civil Service. So she tried
"Bunny" next; but that was worse. "Bunny" was someone plump and
soft and comic; he was thin and hard and serious. Still, his nose
twitched. "Lappin," she exclaimed suddenly; and gave a little cry
as if she had found the very word she looked for.</p>

<p>"Lappin, Lappin, King Lappin," she repeated. It seemed to suit
him exactly; he was not Ernest, he was King Lappin. Why? She did
not know.</p>

<p>When there was nothing new to talk about on their long solitary
walks&mdash;and it rained, as everyone had warned them that it
would rain; or when they were sitting over the fire in the evening,
for it was cold, and the maiden ladies had gone and the fishing
man, and the waiter only came if you rang the bell for him, she let
her fancy play with the story of the Lappin tribe. Under her
hands&mdash;she was sewing; he was readingthey became very real,
very vivid, very amusing. Ernest put down the paper and helped her.
There were the black rabbits and the red; there were the enemy
rabbits and the friendly. There were the wood in which they lived
and the outlying prairies and the swamp. Above all there was King
Lappin, who, far from having only the one trick&mdash;that he
twitched his nose&mdash;became as the days passed an animal of the
greatest character; Rosalind was always finding new qualities in
him. But above all he was a great hunter.</p>

<p>"And what," said Rosalind, on the last day of the honeymoon,
"did the King do to-day?"</p>

<p>In fact they had been climbing all day; and she had worn a
blister on her heel; but she did not mean that.</p>

<p>"To-day," said Ernest, twitching his nose as he bit the end off
his cigar, "he chased a hare." He paused; struck a match, and
twitched again.</p>

<p>"A woman hare," he added.</p>

<p>"A white hare!" Rosalind exclaimed, as if she had been expecting
this. "Rather a small hare; silver grey; with big bright eyes?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ernest, looking at her as she had looked at him, "a
smallish animal; with eyes popping out of her head, and two little
front paws dangling." It was exactly how she sat, with her sewing
dangling in her hands; and her eyes, that were so big and bright,
were certainly a little prominent.</p>

<p>"Ah, Lapinova," Rosalind murmured.</p>

<p>"Is that what she's called?" said Ernest&mdash;"the real
Rosalind?" He looked at her. He felt very much in love with
her.</p>

<p>"Yes; that's what she's called," said Rosalind. "Lapinova." And
before they went to bed that night it was all settled. He was King
Lappin; she was Queen Lapinova. They were the opposite of each
other; he was bold and determined; she wary and undependable. He
ruled over the busy world of rabbits; her world was a desolate,
mysterious place, which she ranged mostly by moonlight. All the
same, their territories touched; they were King and Queen.</p>

<p>Thus when they came back from their honeymoon they possessed a
private world, inhabited, save for the one white hare, entirely by
rabbits. No one guessed that there was such a place, and that of
course made it all the more amusing. It made them feel, more even
than most young married couples, in league together against the
rest of the world. Often they looked slyly at each other when
people talked about rabbits and woods and traps and shooting. Or
they winked furtively across the table when Aunt Mary said that she
could never bear to see a hare in a dish&mdash;it looked so like a
baby: or when John, Ernest's sporting brother, told them what price
rabbits were fetching that autumn in Wiltshire, skins and all.
Sometimes when they wanted a gamekeeper, or a poacher or a Lord of
the Manor, they amused themselves by distributing the parts among
their friends. Ernest's mother, Mrs. Reginald Thorburn, for
example, fitted the part of the Squire to perfection. But it was
all secret&mdash;that was the point of it; nobody save themselves
knew that such a world existed.</p>

<p>Without that world, how, Rosalind wondered, that winter could
she have lived at all? For instance, there was the golden-wedding
party, when all the Thorburns assembled at Porchester Terrace to
celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of that union which had been so
blessed&mdash;had it not produced Ernest Thorburn? and so
fruitful&mdash;had it not produced nine other sons and daughters
into the bargain, many themselves married and also fruitful? She
dreaded that party. But it was inevitable. As she walked upstairs
she felt bitterly that she was an only child and an orphan at that;
a mere drop among all those Thorburns assembled in the great
drawing-room with the shiny satin wallpaper and the lustrous family
portraits. The living Thorburns much resembled the painted; save
that instead of painted lips they had real lips; out of which came
jokes; jokes about schoolrooms, and how they had pulled the chair
from under the governess; jokes about frogs and how they had put
them between the virgin sheets of maiden ladies. As for herself,
she had never even made an apple-pie bed. Holding her present in
her hand she advanced toward her mother-in-law sumptuous in yellow
satin; and toward her father-in-law decorated with a rich yellow
carnation. All round them on tables and chairs there were golden
tributes, some nestling in cotton wool; others branching
resplendent&mdash;candlesticks; cigar boxes; chains; each stamped
with the goldsmith's proof that it was solid gold, hall-marked,
authentic. But her present was only a little pinchbeck box pierced
with holes; an old sand caster, an eighteenth-century relic, once
used to sprinkle sand over wet ink. Rather a senseless present she
felt&mdash;in an age of blotting paper; and as she proffered it,
she saw in front of her the stubby black handwriting in which her
mother-in-law when they were engaged had expressed the hope that
"My son will make you happy." No, she was not happy. Not at all
happy. She looked at Ernest, straight as a ramrod with a nose like
all the noses in the family portraits; a nose that never twitched
at all.</p>

<p>Then they went down to dinner. She was half hidden by the great
chrysanthemums that curled their red and gold petals into large
tight balls. Everything was gold. A gold-edged card with gold
initials intertwined recited the list of all the dishes that would
be set one after another before them. She dipped her spoon in a
plate of clear golden fluid. The raw white fog outside had been
turned by the lamps into a golden mesh that blurred the edges of
the plates and gave the pineapples a rough golden skin. Only she
herself in her white wedding dress peering ahead of her with her
prominent eyes seemed insoluble as an icicle.</p>

<p>As the dinner wore on, however, the room grew steamy with heat.
Beads of perspiration stood out on the men's foreheads. She felt
that her icicle was being turned to water. She was being melted;
dispersed; dissolved into nothingness; and would soon faint. Then
through the surge in her head and the din in her ears she heard a
woman's voice exclaim, "But they breed so!"</p>

<p>The Thorburns&mdash;yes; they breed so, she echoed; looking at
all the round red faces that seemed doubled in the giddiness that
overcame her; and magnified in the gold mist that enhaloed them.
"They breed so." Then John bawled:</p>

<p>"Little devils!...Shoot 'em! Jump on 'em with big boots! That's
the only way to deal with 'em...rabbits!"</p>

<p>At that word, that magic word, she revived. Peeping between the
chrysanthemums she saw Ernest's nose twitch. It rippled, it ran
with successive twitches. And at that a mysterious catastrophe
befell the Thorburns. The golden table became a moor with the gorse
in full bloom; the din of voices turned to one peal of lark's
laughter ringing down from the sky. It was a blue sky&mdash;clouds
passed slowly. And they had all been changed&mdash;the Thorburns.
She looked at her father-in-law, a furtive little man with dyed
moustaches. His foible was collecting things&mdash;seals, enamel
boxes, trifles from eighteenth-century dressing tables which he hid
in the drawers of his study from his wife. Now she saw him as he
was&mdash;a poacher, stealing off with his coat bulging with
pheasants and partridges to drop them stealthily into a
three-legged pot in his smoky little cottage. That was her real
father-in-law&mdash;a poacher. And Celia, the unmarried daughter,
who always nosed out other people's secrets, the little things they
wished to hide&mdash;she was a white ferret with pink eyes, and a
nose clotted with earth from her horrid underground nosings and
pokings. Slung round men's shoulders, in a net, and thrust down a
hole&mdash;it was a pitiable life&mdash;Celia's; it was none of her
fault. So she saw Celia. And then she looked at her
mother-in-law&mdash;whom they dubbed The Squire. Flushed, coarse, a
bully&mdash;she was all that, as she stood returning thanks, but
now that Rosalind&mdash;that is Lapinova&mdash;saw her, she saw
behind her the decayed family mansion, the plaster peeling off the
walls, and heard her, with a sob in her voice, giving thanks to her
children (who hated her) for a world that had ceased to exist.
There was a sudden silence. They all stood with their glasses
raised; they all drank; then it was over.</p>

<p>"Oh, King Lappin!" she cried as they went home together in the
fog, "if your nose hadn't twitched just at that moment, I should
have been trapped!"</p>

<p>"But you're safe," said King Lappin, pressing her paw.</p>

<p>"Quite safe," she answered.</p>

<p>And they drove back through the Park, King and Queen of the
marsh, of the mist, and of the gorse-scented moor.</p>

<p>Thus time passed; one year; two years of time. And on a winter's
night, which happened by a coincidence to be the anniversary of the
golden-wedding party&mdash;but Mrs. Reginald Thorburn was dead; the
house was to let; and there was only a caretaker in
residence&mdash;Ernest came home from the office. They had a nice
little home; half a house above a saddler's shop in South
Kensington, not far from the tube station. It was cold, with fog in
the air, and Rosalind was sitting over the fire, sewing.</p>

<p>"What d'you think happened to me to-day?" she began as soon as
he had settled himself down with his legs stretched to the blaze.
"I was crossing the stream when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What stream?" Ernest interrupted her.</p>

<p>"The stream at the bottom, where our wood meets the black wood,"
she explained.</p>

<p>Ernest looked completely blank for a moment.</p>

<p>"What the deuce are you talking about?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My dear Ernest!" she cried in dismay. "King Lappin," she added,
dangling her little front paws in the firelight. But his nose did
not twitch. Her hands&mdash;they turned to hands&mdash;clutched the
stuff she was holding; her eyes popped half out of her head. It
took him five minutes at least to change from Ernest Thorburn to
King Lappin; and while she waited she felt a load on the back of
her neck, as if somebody were about to wring it. At last he changed
to King Lappin; his nose twitched; and they spent the evening
roaming the woods much as usual.</p>

<p>But she slept badly. In the middle of the night she woke,
feeling as if something strange had happened to her. She was stiff
and cold. At last she turned on the light and looked at Ernest
lying beside her. He was sound asleep. He snored. But even though
he snored, his nose remained perfectly still. It looked as if it
had never twitched at all. Was it possible that he was really
Ernest; and that she was really married to Ernest? A vision of her
mother-in-law's dining-room came before her; and there they sat,
she and Ernest, grown old, under the engravings, in front of the
sideboard...It was their golden-wedding day. She could not bear
it.</p>

<p>"Lappin, King Lappin!" she whispered, and for a moment his nose
seemed to twitch of its own accord. But he still slept. "Wake up,
Lappin, wake up!" she cried.</p>

<p>Ernest woke; and seeing her sitting bolt upright beside him he
asked:</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I thought my rabbit was dead!" she whimpered. Ernest was
angry.</p>

<p>"Don't talk such rubbish, Rosalind," he said. "Lie down and go
to sleep."</p>

<p>He turned over. In another moment he was sound asleep and
snoring.</p>

<p>But she could not sleep. She lay curled up on her side of the
bed, like a hare in its form. She had turned out the light, but the
street lamp lit the ceiling faintly, and the trees outside made a
lacy network over it as if there were a shadowy grove on the
ceiling in which she wandered, turning, twisting, in and out, round
and round, hunting, being hunted, hearing the bay of hounds and
horns; flying, escaping...until the maid drew the blinds and
brought their early tea.</p>

<p>Next day she could settle to nothing. She seemed to have lost
something. She felt as if her body had shrunk; it had grown small,
and black and hard. Her joints seemed stiff too, and when she
looked in the glass, which she did several times as she wandered
about the flat, her eyes seemed to burst out of her head, like
currants in a bun. The rooms also seemed to have shrunk. Large
pieces of furniture jutted out at odd angles and she found herself
knocking against them. At last she put on her hat and went out. She
walked along the Cromwell Road; and every room she passed and
peered into seemed to be a dining-room where people sat eating
under steel engravings, with thick yellow lace curtains, and
mahogany sideboards. At last she reached the Natural History
Museum; she used to like it when she was a child. But the first
thing she saw when she went in was a stuffed hare standing on sham
snow with pink glass eyes. Somehow it made her shiver all over.
Perhaps it would be better when dusk fell. She went home and sat
over the fire, without a light, and tried to imagine that she was
out alone on a moor; and there was a stream rushing; and beyond the
stream a dark wood. But she could get no further than the stream.
At last she squatted down on the bank on the wet grass, and sat
crouched in her chair, with her hands dangling empty, and her eyes
glazed, like glass eyes, in the firelight. Then there was the crack
of a gun...She started as if she had been shot. It was only Ernest,
turning his key in the door. She waited, trembling. He came in and
switched on the light. There he stood, tall, handsome, rubbing his
hands that were red with cold.</p>

<p>"Sitting in the dark?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ernest, Ernest!" she cried, starting up in her chair.</p>

<p>"Well, what's up now?" he asked briskly, warming his hands at
the fire.</p>

<p>"It's Lapinova..." she faltered, glancing wildly at him out of
her great startled eyes. "She's gone, Ernest. I've lost her!"</p>

<p>Ernest frowned. He pressed his lips tight together. "Oh, that's
what's up, is it?" he said, smiling rather grimly at his wife. For
ten seconds he stood there, silent; and she waited, feeling hands
tightening at the back of her neck.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said at length. "Poor Lapinova..." He straightened his
tie at the looking-glass over the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"Caught in a trap," he said, "killed," and sat down and read the
newspaper.</p>

<p>So that was the end of that marriage.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>THE MAN WHO LOVED HIS KIND</h2>

<p>Trotting through Deans Yard that afternoon, Prickett Ellis ran
straight into Richard Dalloway, or rather, just as they were
passing, the covert side glance which each was casting on the
other, under his hat, over his shoulder, broadened and burst into
recognition; they had not met for twenty years. They had been at
school together. And what was Ellis doing? The Bar? Of course, of
course&mdash;he had followed the case in the papers. But it was
impossible to talk here. Wouldn't he drop in that evening. (They
lived in the same old place&mdash;just round the corner). One or
two people were coming. Joynson perhaps. "An awful swell now," said
Richard.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;till this evening then," said Richard, and went his
way, "jolly glad" (that was quite true) to have met that queer
chap, who hadn't changed one bit since he had been at
school&mdash;just the same knobbly, chubby little boy then, with
prejudices sticking out all over him, but uncommonly
brilliant&mdash;won the Newcastle. Well&mdash;off he went.</p>

<p>Prickett Ellis, however, as he turned and looked at Dalloway
disappearing, wished now he had not met him or, at least, for he
had always liked him personally, hadn't promised to come to this
party. Dalloway was married, gave parties; wasn't his sort at all.
He would have to dress. However, as the evening drew on, he
supposed, as he had said that, and didn't want to be rude, he must
go there.</p>

<p>But what an appalling entertainment! There was Joynson; they had
nothing to say to each other. He had been a pompous little boy; he
had grown rather more self-important&mdash;that was all; there
wasn't a single other soul in the room that Prickett Ellis knew.
Not one. So, as he could not go at once, without saying a word to
Dalloway, who seemed altogether taken up with his duties, bustling
about in a white waistcoat, there he had to stand. It was the sort
of thing that made his gorge rise. Think of grown up, responsible
men and women doing this every night of their lives! The lines
deepened on his blue and red shaven cheeks as he leant against the
wall in complete silence, for though he worked like a horse, he
kept himself fit by exercise; and he looked hard and fierce, as if
his moustaches were dipped in frost. He bristled; he grated. His
meagre dress clothes made him look unkempt, insignificant,
angular.</p>

<p>Idle, chattering, overdressed, without an idea in their heads,
these fine ladies and gentlemen went on talking and laughing; and
Prickett Ellis watched them and compared them with the Brunners
who, when they won their case against Fenners' Brewery and got two
hundred pounds compensation (it was not half what they should have
got) went and spent five of it on a clock for him. That was a
decent sort of thing to do; that was the sort of thing that moved
one, and he glared more severely than ever at these people,
overdressed, cynical, prosperous, and compared what he felt now
with what he felt at eleven o'clock that morning when old Brunner
and Mrs. Brunner, in their best clothes, awfully respectable and
clean looking old people, had called in to give him that small
token, as the old man put it, standing perfectly upright to make
his speech, of gratitude and respect for the very able way in which
you conducted our case, and Mrs. Brunner piped up, how it was all
due to him they felt. And they deeply appreciated his
generosity&mdash;because, of course, he hadn't taken a fee.</p>

<p>And as he took the clock and put it on the middle of his
mantelpiece, he had felt that he wished nobody to see his face.
That was what he worked for&mdash;that was his reward; and he
looked at the people who were actually before his eyes as if they
danced over that scene in his chambers and were exposed by it, and
as it faded&mdash;the Brunners faded&mdash;there remained as if
left of that scene, himself, confronting this hostile population, a
perfectly plain, unsophisticated man, a man of the people (he
straightened himself) very badly dressed, glaring, with not an air
or a grace about him, a man who was an ill hand at concealing his
feelings, a plain man, an ordinary human being, pitted against the
evil, the corruption, the heartlessness of society. But he would
not go on staring. Now he put on his spectacles and examined the
pictures. He read the titles on a line of books; for the most part
poetry. He would have liked well enough to read some of his old
favourites again&mdash;Shakespeare, Dickens&mdash;he wished he ever
had time to turn into the National Gallery, but he
couldn't&mdash;no, one could not. Really one could not&mdash;with
the world in the state it was in. Not when people all day long
wanted your help, fairly clamoured for help. This wasn't an age for
luxuries. And he looked at the arm chairs and the paper knives and
the well bound books, and shook his head, knowing that he would
never have the time, never he was glad to think have the heart, to
afford himself such luxuries. The people here would be shocked if
they knew what he paid for his tobacco; how he had borrowed his
clothes. His one and only extravagance was his little yacht on the
Norfolk Broads. And that he did allow himself, He did like once a
year to get right away from everybody and lie on his back in a
field. He thought how shocked they would be&mdash;these fine
folk&mdash;if they realized the amount of pleasure he got from what
he was old fashioned enough to call the love of nature; trees and
fields he had known ever since he was a boy.</p>

<p>These fine people would be shocked. Indeed, standing there,
putting his spectacles away in his pocket, he felt himself grow
more and more shocking every instant. And it was a very
disagreeable feeling. He did not feel this&mdash;that he loved
humanity, that he paid only fivepence an ounce for tobacco and
loved nature&mdash;naturally and quietly. Each of these pleasures
had been turned into a protest. He felt that these people whom he
despised made him stand and deliver and justify himself. "I am an
ordinary man," he kept saying. And what he said next he was really
ashamed of saying, but he said it. "I have done more for my kind in
one day than the rest of you in all your lives." Indeed, he could
not help himself; he kept recalling scene after scene, like that
when the Brunners gave him the clock&mdash;he kept reminding
himself of the nice things people had said of his humanity, of his
generosity, how he had helped them. He kept seeing himself as the
wise and tolerant servant of humanity. And he wished he could
repeat his praises aloud. It was unpleasant that the sense of his
goodness should boil within him. It was still more unpleasant that
he could tell no one what people had said about him. Thank the
Lord, he kept saying, I shall be back at work to-morrow; and yet he
was no longer satisfied simply to slip through the door and go
home. He must stay, he must stay until he had justified himself.
But how could he? In all that room full of people, he did not know
a soul to speak to.</p>

<p>At last Richard Dalloway came up.</p>

<p>"I want to introduce Miss O'Keefe," he said. Miss O'Keefe looked
him full in the eyes. She was a rather arrogant, abrupt mannered
woman in the thirties.</p>

<p>Miss O'Keefe wanted an ice or something to drink. And the reason
why she asked Prickett Ellis to give it her in what he felt a
haughty, unjustifiable manner, was that she had seen a woman and
two children, very poor, very tired, pressing against the railings
of a square, peering in, that hot afternoon. Can't they be let in?
she had thought, her pity rising like a wave; her indignation
boiling. No; she rebuked herself the next moment, roughly, as if
she boxed her own ears. The whole force of the world can't do it.
So she picked up the tennis ball and hurled it back. The whole
force of the world can't do it, she said in a fury, and that was
why she said so commandingly, to the unknown man:</p>

<p>"Give me an ice."</p>

<p>Long before she had eaten it, Prickett Ellis, standing beside
her without taking anything, told her that he had not been to a
party for fifteen years; told her that his dress suit was lent him
by his brother-in-law; told her that he did not like this sort of
thing, and it would have eased him greatly to go on to say that he
was a plain man, who happened to have a liking for ordinary people,
and then would have told her (and been ashamed of it afterwards)
about the Brunners and the clock, but she said:</p>

<p>"Have you seen the Tempest?"</p>

<p>then (for he had not seen the Tempest), had he read some book?
Again no, and then, putting her ice down, did he never read
poetry?</p>

<p>And Prickett Ellis feeling something rise within him which would
decapitate this young woman, make a victim of her, massacre her,
made her sit down there, where they would not be interrupted, on
two chairs, in the empty garden, for everyone was upstairs, only
you could hear a buzz and a hum and a chatter and a jingle, like
the mad accompaniment of some phantom orchestra to a cat or two
slinking across the grass, and the wavering of leaves, and the
yellow and red fruit like Chinese lanterns wobbling this way and
that&mdash;the talk seemed like a frantic skeleton dance music set
to something very real, and full of suffering.</p>

<p>"How beautiful!" said Miss O'Keefe.</p>

<p>Oh, it was beautiful, this little patch of grass, with the
towers of Westminster massed round it black, high in the air, after
the drawing-room; it was silent, after that noise. After all, they
had that&mdash;the tired woman, the children.</p>

<p>Prickett Ellis lit a pipe. That would shock her; he filled it
with shag tobacco&mdash;fivepence halfpenny an ounce. He thought
how he would lie in his boat smoking, he could see himself, alone,
at night, smoking under the stars. For always to-night he kept
thinking how he would look if these people here were to see him. He
said to Miss O'Keefe, striking a match on the sole of his boot,
that he couldn't see anything particularly beautiful out here.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Miss O'Keefe, "you don't care for beauty." (He
had told her that he had not seen the Tempest; that he had not read
a book; he looked ill-kempt, all moustache, chin, and silver watch
chain.) She thought nobody need pay a penny for this; the Museums
are free and the National Gallery; and the country. Of course she
knew the objections&mdash;the washing, cooking, children; but the
root of things, what they were all afraid of saying, was that
happiness is dirt cheap. You can have it for nothing. Beauty.</p>

<p>Then Prickett Ellis let her have it&mdash;this pale, abrupt,
arrogant woman. He told her, puffing his shag tobacco, what he had
done that day. Up at six; interviews; smelling a drain in a filthy
slum; then to court.</p>

<p>Here he hesitated, wishing to tell her something of his own
doings. Suppressing that, he was all the more caustic. He said it
made him sick to hear well fed, well dressed women (she twitched
her lips, for she was thin, and her dress not up to standard) talk
of beauty.</p>

<p>"Beauty!" he said. He was afraid he did not understand beauty
apart from human beings.</p>

<p>So they glared into the empty garden where the lights were
swaying, and one cat hesitating in the middle, its paw lifted.</p>

<p>Beauty apart from human beings? What did he mean by that? she
demanded suddenly.</p>

<p>Well this: getting more and more wrought up, he told her the
story of the Brunners and the clock, not concealing his pride in
it. That was beautiful, he said.</p>

<p>She had no words to specify the horror his story roused in her.
First his conceit; then his indecency in talking about human
feelings; it was a blasphemy; no one in the whole world ought to
tell a story to prove that they had loved their kind. Yet as he
told it&mdash;how the old man had stood up and made his
speech&mdash;tears came into her eyes; ah, if any one had ever said
that to her! but then again, she felt how it was just this that
condemned humanity for ever; never would they reach beyond
affecting scenes with clocks; Brunners making speeches to Prickett
Ellises, and the Prickett Ellises would always say how they had
loved their kind; they would always be lazy, compromising, and
afraid of beauty. Hence sprang revolutions; from laziness and fear
and this love of affecting scenes. Still this man got pleasure from
his Brunners; and she was condemned to suffer for ever and ever
from her poor poor women shut out from squares. So they sat silent.
Both were very unhappy. For Prickett Ellis was not in the least
solaced by what he had said; instead of picking her thorn out he
had rubbed it in; his happiness of the morning had been ruined.
Miss O'Keefe was muddled and annoyed; she was muddy instead of
clear.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am one of those very ordinary people," he said,
getting up, "who love their kind."</p>

<p>Upon which Miss O'Keefe almost shouted: "So do I!"</p>

<p>Hating each other, hating the whole houseful of people who had
given them this painful, this disillusioning evening, these two
lovers of their kind got up, and without a word, parted for
ever.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>THE SEARCHLIGHT</h2>

<p>The mansion of the eighteenth century Earl had been changed in
the twentieth century into a Club. And it was pleasant, after
dining in the great room with the pillars and the chandeliers under
a glare of light to go out on to the balcony overlooking the Park.
The trees were in full leaf, and had there been a moon, one could
have seen the pink and cream coloured cockades on the chestnut
trees. But it was a moonless night; very warm, after a fine
summer's day.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Ivimey's party were drinking coffee and smoking on
the balcony. As if to relieve them from the need of talking, to
entertain them without any effort on their part, rods of light
wheeled across the sky. It was peace then; the air force was
practising; searching for enemy aircraft in the sky. After pausing
to prod some suspected spot, the light wheeled, like the wings of a
windmill, or again like the antennae of some prodigious insect and
revealed here a cadaverous stone front; here a chestnut tree with
all its blossoms riding; and then suddenly the light struck
straight at the balcony, and for a second a bright disc
shone&mdash;perhaps it was a mirror in a ladies' hand-bag.</p>

<p>"Look!" Mrs. Ivimey exclaimed.</p>

<p>The light passed. They were in darkness again</p>

<p>"You'll never guess what <i>that</i> made me see! she added.
Naturally, they guessed.</p>

<p>"No, no, no," she protested. Nobody could guess; only she knew;
only she could know, because she was the great-grand-daughter of
the man himself. He had told her the story. What story? If they
liked, she would try to tell it. There was still time before the
play.</p>

<p>"But where do I begin?" she pondered. "In the year 1820?...It
must have been about then that my greatgrandfather was a boy. I'm
not young myself"&mdash;no, but she was very well set up and
handsome&mdash;"and he was a very old man when I was a
child&mdash;when he told me the story. A very handsome old man,
with a shock of white hair, and blue eyes. He must have been a
beautiful boy. But queer...That was only natural," she explained,
"seeing how they lived. The name was Comber. They'd come down in
the world. They'd been gentlefolk; they'd owned land up in
Yorkshire. But when he was a boy only the tower was left. The house
was nothing but a little farmhouse, standing in the middle of
fields. We saw it ten years ago and went over it. We had to leave
the car and walk across the fields. There isn't any road to the
house. It stands all alone, the grass grows right up to the
gate...there were chickens pecking about, running in and out of the
rooms. All gone to rack and ruin. I remember a stone fell from the
tower suddenly." She paused. "There they lived," she went on, "the
old man, the woman and the boy. She wasn't his wife, or the boy's
mother. She was just a farm hand, a girl the old man had taken to
live with him when his wife died. Another reason perhaps why nobody
visited them&mdash;why the whole place was gone to rack and ruin.
But I remember a coat of arms over the door; and books, old books,
gone mouldy. He taught himself all he knew from books. He read and
read, he told me, old books, books with maps hanging out from the
pages. He dragged them up to the top of the tower&mdash;the rope's
still there and the broken steps. There's a chair still in the
window with the bottom fallen out; and the window swinging open,
and the panes broken, and a view for miles and miles across the
moors."</p>

<p>She paused as if she were up in the tower looking from the
window that swung open.</p>

<p>"But we couldn't," she said, "find the telescope." In the
dining-room behind them the clatter of plates grew louder. But Mrs.
Ivimey, on the balcony, seemed puzzled, because she could not find
the telescope.</p>

<p>"Why a telescope?" someone asked her.</p>

<p>"Why? Because if there hadn't been a telescope," she laughed, "I
shouldn't be sitting here now."</p>

<p>And certainly she was sitting there now, a well set-up,
middle-aged woman, with something blue over her shoulders.</p>

<p>"It must have been there," she resumed, "because, he told me,
every night when the old people had gone to bed he sat at the
window, looking through the telescope at the stars. Jupiter,
Aldebaran, Cassiopeia." She waved her hand at the stars that were
beginning to show over the trees. It was growing draker. And the
searchlight seemed brighter, sweeping across the sky, pausing here
and there to stare at the stars.</p>

<p>"There they were," she went on, "the stars. And he asked
himself, my great-grandfather&mdash;that boy: 'What are they? Why
are they? And who am I?' as one does, sitting alone, with no one to
talk to, looking at the stars."</p>

<p>She was silent. They all looked at the stars that were coming
out in the darkness over the trees. The stars seemed very
permanent, very unchanging. The roar of London sank away. A hundred
years seemed nothing. They felt that the boy was looking at the
stars with them. They seemed to be with him, in the tower, looking
out over the moors at the stars.</p>

<p>Then a voice behind them said:</p>

<p>"Right you are. Friday."</p>

<p>They all turned, shifted, felt dropped down on to the balcony
again.</p>

<p>"Ah, but there was nobody to say that to him," she murmured. The
couple rose and walked away.</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> was alone," she resumed. "It was a fine summer's day.
A June day. One of those perfect summer days when everything seems
to stand still in the heat. There were the chickens pecking in the
farm-yard; the old horse stamping in the stable; the old man dozing
over his glass. The woman scouring pails in the scullery. Perhaps a
stone fell from the tower. It seemed as if the day would never end.
And he had no one to talk to&mdash;nothing whatever to do. The
whole world stretched before him. The moor rising and falling; the
sky meeting the moor; green and blue, green and blue, for ever and
ever."</p>

<p>In the half light, they could see that Mrs. Ivimey was leaning
over the balcony, with her chin propped on her hands, as if she
were looking out over the moors from the top of a tower.</p>

<p>"Nothing but moor and sky, moor and sky, for ever and ever," she
murmured.</p>

<p>Then she made a movement, as if she swung something into
position.</p>

<p>"But what did the earth look like through the telescope?" she
asked.</p>

<p>She made another quick little movement with her fingers as if
she were twirling something.</p>

<p>"He focussed it," she said. "He focussed it upon the earth. He
focussed it upon a dark mass of wood upon the horizon. He focussed
it so that he could see...each tree...each tree separate...and the
birds...rising and falling...and a stem of smoke...there...in the
midst of the trees...And then...lower...lower...(she lowered her
eyes)...there was a house...a house among the trees...a
farm-house...every brick showed...and the tubs on either side of
the door...with flowers in them blue, pink, hydrangeas, perhaps..."
She paused..."And then a girl came out of the house...wearing
something blue upon her head...and stood there...feeding
birds...pigeons...they came fluttering round her...And
then...look...A man...A man! He came round the corner. He seized
her in his arms! They kissed...they kissed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ivimey opened her arms and closed them as if she were
kissing someone.</p>

<p>"It was the first time he had seen a man kiss a woman&mdash;in
his telescope&mdash;miles and miles away across the moors!"</p>

<p>She thrust something from her&mdash;the telescope presumably.
She sat upright.</p>

<p>"So he ran down the stairs. He ran through the fields. He ran
down lanes, out upon the high road, through woods. He ran for miles
and miles, and just when the stars were showing above the trees he
reached the house...covered with dust, streaming with sweat..."</p>

<p>She stopped, as if she saw him.</p>

<p>"And then, and then...what did he do then? What did he say? And
the girl..." they pressed her.</p>

<p>A shaft of light fell upon Mrs. Ivimey as if someone had
focussed the lens of a telescope upon her. (It was the air force,
looking for enemy air craft.) She had risen. She had something blue
on her head. She had raised her hand, as if she stood in a doorway,
amazed.</p>

<p>"Oh the girl...She was my&mdash;" she hesitated, as if she were
about to say "myself." But she remembered; and corrected herself.
"She was my great-grand-mother," she said.</p>

<p>She turned to look for her cloak. It was on a chair behind
her.</p>

<p>"But tell us&mdash;what about the other man, the man who came
round the corner?" they asked.</p>

<p>"That man? Oh, that man," Mrs. Ivimey murmured, stooping to
fumble with her cloak (the searchlight had left the balcony), "he I
suppose, vanished."</p>

<p>"The light," she added, gathering her things about her, "only
falls here and there."</p>

<p>The searchlight had passed on. It was now focussed on the plain
expanse of Buckingham Palace. And it was time they went on to the
play.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>THE LEGACY</h2>

<p>"For Sissy Miller." Gilbert Clandon, taking up the pearl brooch
that lay among a litter of rings and brooches on a little table in
his wife's drawing-room, read the inscription: "For Sissy Miller,
with my love."</p>

<p>It was like Angela to have remembered even Sissy Miller, her
secretary. Yet how strange it was, Gilbert Clandon thought once
more, that she had left everything in such order&mdash;a little
gift of some sort for every one of her friends. It was as if she
had foreseen her death. Yet she had been in perfect health when she
left the house that morning, six weeks ago; when she stepped off
the kerb in Piccadilly and the car had killed her.</p>

<p>He was waiting for Sissy Miller. He had asked her to come; he
owed her, he felt, after all the years she had been with them, this
token of consideration. Yes, he went on, as he sat there waiting,
it was strange that Angela had left everything in such order. Every
friend had been left some little token of her affection. Every
ring, every necklace, every little Chinese box&mdash;she had a
passion for little boxes&mdash;had a name on it. And each had some
memory for him. This he had given her; this &mdash;the enamel
dolphin with the ruby eyes&mdash;she had pounced upon one day in a
back street in Venice. He could remember her little cry of delight.
To him, of course, she had left nothing in particular, unless it
were her diary. Fifteen little volumes, bound in green leather,
stood behind him on her writing table. Ever since they were
married, she had kept a diary. Some of their very few&mdash;he
could not call them quarrels, say tiffs&mdash;had been about that
diary. When he came in and found her writing, she always shut it or
put her hand over it. "No, no, no," he could hear her say, "After
I'm dead&mdash;perhaps." So she had left it him, as her legacy. It
was the only thing they had not shared when she was alive. But he
had always taken it for granted that she would outlive him. If only
she had stopped one moment, and had thought what she was doing, she
would be alive now. But she had stepped straight off the kerb, the
driver of the car had said at the inquest. She had given him no
chance to pull up...Here the sound of voices in the hall
interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Miss Miller, Sir," said the maid.</p>

<p>She came in. He had never seen her alone in his life, nor, of
course, in tears. She was terribly distressed, and no wonder.
Angela had been much more to her than an employer. She had been a
friend. To himself, he thought, as he pushed a chair for her and
asked her to sit down, she was scarcely distinguishable from any
other woman of her kind. There were thousands of Sissy
Millers&mdash;drab little women in black carrying attache cases.
But Angela, with her genius for sympathy, had discovered all sorts
of qualities in Sissy Miller. She was the soul of discretion; so
silent; so trustworthy, one could tell her anything, and so on.</p>

<p>Miss Miller could not speak at first. She sat there dabbing her
eyes with her pocket handkerchief. Then she made an effort.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Clandon," she said.</p>

<p>He murmured. Of course he understood. It was only natural. He
could guess what his wife had meant to her.</p>

<p>"I've been so happy here," she said, looking round. Her eyes
rested on the writing table behind him. It was here they had
worked&mdash;she and Angela. For Angela had her share of the duties
that fall to the lot of a prominent politician's wife. She had been
the greatest help to him in his career. He had often seen her and
Sissy sitting at that table&mdash;Sissy at the typewriter, taking
down letters from her dictation. No doubt Miss Miller was thinking
of that, too. Now all he had to do was to give her the brooch his
wife had left her. A rather incongruous gift it seemed. It might
have been better to have left her a sum of money, or even the
typewriter. But there it was&mdash;"For Sissy Miller, with my
love." And, taking the brooch, he gave it her with the little
speech that he had prepared. He knew, he said, that she would value
it. His wife had often worn it...And she replied, as she took it
almost as if she too had prepared a speech, that it would always be
a treasured possession...She had, he supposed, other clothes upon
which a pearl brooch would not look quite so incongruous. She was
wearing the little black coat and skirt that seemed the uniform of
her profession. Then he remembered&mdash;she was in mourning, of
course. She, too, had had her tragedy&mdash;a brother, to whom she
was devoted, had died only a week or two before Angela. In some
accident was it? He could not remember&mdash;only Angela telling
him. Angela, with her genius for sympathy, had been terribly upset.
Meanwhile Sissy Miller had risen. She was putting on her gloves.
Evidently she felt that she ought not to intrude. But he could not
let her go without saying something about her future. What were her
plans? Was there any way in which he could help her?</p>

<p>She was gazing at the table, where she had sat at her
typewriter, where the diary lay. And, lost in her memories of
Angela, she did not at once answer his suggestion that he should
help her. She seemed for a moment not to understand. So he
repeated:</p>

<p>"What are your plans, Miss Miller?"</p>

<p>"My plans? Oh, that's all right, Mr. Clandon," she exclaimed.
"Please don't bother yourself about me."</p>

<p>He took her to mean that she was in no need of financial
assistance. It would be better, he realized, to make any suggestion
of that kind in a letter. All he could do now was to say as he
pressed her hand, "Remember, Miss Miller, if there's any way in
which I can help you, it will be a pleasure..." Then he opened the
door. For a moment, on the threshold, as if a sudden thought had
struck her, she stopped.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clandon," she said, looking straight at him for the first
time, and for the first time he was struck by the expression,
sympathetic yet searching, in her eyes. "If at any time," she
continued, "there's anything I can do to help you, remember, I
shall feel it, for your wife's sake, a pleasure..."</p>

<p>With that she was gone. Her words and the look that went with
them were unexpected. It was almost as if she believed, or hoped,
that he would need her. A curious, perhaps a fantastic idea
occurred to him as he returned to his chair. Could it be, that
during all those years when he had scarcely noticed her, she, as
the novelists say, had entertained a passion for him? He caught his
own reflection in the glass as he passed. He was over fifty; but he
could not help admitting that he was still, as the looking-glass
showed him, a very distinguished-looking man.</p>

<p>"Poor Sissy Miller!" he said, half laughing. How he would have
liked to share that joke with his wife! He turned instinctively to
her diary. "Gilbert," he read, opening it at random, "looked so
wonderful..." It was as if she had answered his question. Of
course, she seemed to say, you're very attractive to women. Of
course Sissy Miller felt that too. He read on. "How proud I am to
be his wife!" And he had always been very proud to be her husband.
How often, when they dined out somewhere, he had looked at her
across the table and said to himself, She is the loveliest woman
here! He read on. That first year he had been standing for
Parliament. They had toured his constituency. "When Gilbert sat
down the applause was terrific. The whole audience rose and sang:
'For he's a jolly good fellow.' I was quite overcome." He
remembered that, too. She had been sitting on the platform beside
him. He could still see the glance she cast at him, and how she had
tears in her eyes. And then? He turned the pages. They had gone to
Venice. He recalled that happy holiday after the election. "We had
ices at Florians." He smiled&mdash;she was still such a child; she
loved ices. "Gilbert gave me a most interesting account of the
history of Venice. He told me that the Doges..." she had written it
all out in her schoolgirl hand. One of the delights of travelling
with Angela had been that she was so eager to learn. She was so
terribly ignorant, she used to say, as if that were not one of her
charms. And then&mdash;he opened the next volume&mdash;they had
come back to London. "I was so anxious to make a good impression. I
wore my wedding dress." He could see her now sitting next old Sir
Edward; and making a conquest of that formidable old man, his
chief. He read on rapidly, filling in scene after scene from her
scrappy fragments. "Dined at the House of Commons...To an evening
party at the Lovegroves. Did I realize my responsibility, Lady L.
asked me, as Gilbert's wife?" Then, as the years passed&mdash;he
took another volume from the writing table&mdash;he had become more
and more absorbed in his work. And she, of course, was more often
alone...It had been a great grief to her, apparently, that they had
had no children. "How I wish," one entry read, "that Gilbert had a
son!" Oddly enough he had never much regretted that himself. Life
had been so full, so rich as it was. That year he had been given a
minor post in the government. A minor post only, but her comment
was: "I am quite certain now that he will be Prime Minister!" Well,
if things had gone differently, it might have been so. He paused
here to speculate upon what might have been. Politics was a gamble,
he reflected; but the game wasn't over yet. Not at fifty. He cast
his eyes rapidly over more pages, full of the little trifles, the
insignificant, happy, daily trifles that had made up her life.</p>

<p>He took up another volume and opened it at random. "What a
coward I am! I let the chance slip again. But it seemed selfish to
bother him with my own affairs, when he has so much to think about.
And we so seldom have an evening alone." What was the meaning of
that? Oh, here was the explanation&mdash;it referred to her work in
the East End. "I plucked up courage and talked to Gilbert at last.
He was so kind, so good. He made no objection." He remembered that
conversation. She had told him that she felt so idle, so useless.
She wished to have some work of her own. She wanted to do
something&mdash;she had blushed so prettily, he remembered, as she
said it, sitting in that very chair&mdash;to help others. He had
bantered her a little. Hadn't she enough to do looking after him,
after her home? Still, if it amused her, of course he had no
objection. What was it? Some district? Some committee? Only she
must promise not to make herself ill. So it seemed that every
Wednesday she went to Whitechapel. He remembered how he hated the
clothes she wore on those occasions. But she had taken it very
seriously, it seemed. The diary was full of references like this:
"Saw Mrs. Jones...She has ten children...Husband lost his arm in an
accident...Did my best to find a job for Lily." He skipped on. His
own name occurred less frequently. His interest slackened. Some of
the entries conveyed nothing to him. For example: "Had a heated
argument about socialism with B. M." Who was B. M.? He could not
fill in the initials; some woman, he supposed, that she had met on
one of her committees. "B. M. made a violent attack upon the upper
classes...I walked back after the meeting with B. M. and tried to
convince him. But he is so narrow-minded." So B. M. was a
man&mdash;no doubt one of those "intellectuals," as they call
themselves, who are so violent, as Angela said, and so
narrow-minded. She had invited him to come and see her apparently.
"B. M. came to dinner. He shook hands with Minnie!" That note of
exclamation gave another twist to his mental picture. B. M., it
seemed, wasn't used to parlour-maids; he had shaken hands with
Minnie. Presumably he was one of those tame working men who air
their views in ladies' drawing-rooms. Gilbert knew the type, and
had no liking for this particular specimen, whoever B. M. might be.
Here he was again. "Went with B. M. to the Tower of London...He
said revolution is bound to come...He said we live in a Fool's
Paradise." That was just the kind of thing B. M. would
say&mdash;Gilbert could hear him. He could also see him quite
distinctly&mdash;a stubby little man, with a rough beard, red tie,
dressed as they always did in tweeds, who had never done an honest
day's work in his life. Surely Angela had the sense to see through
him? He read on. "B. M. said some very disagreeable things
about&mdash;" The name was carefully scratched out. "I told him I
would not listen to any more abuse of&mdash;" Again the name was
obliterated. Could it have been his own name? Was that why Angela
covered the page so quickly when he came in? The thought added to
his growing dislike of B.M. He had had the impertinence to discuss
him in this very room. Why had Angela never told him? It was very
unlike her to conceal anything; she had been the soul of candour.
He turned the pages, picking out every reference to B. M. "B. M.
told me the story of his childhood. His mother went out
charring...When I think of it, I can hardly bear to go on living in
such luxury...Three guineas for one hat!" If only she had discussed
the matter with him, instead of puzzling her poor little head about
questions that were much too difficult for her to understand! He
had lent her books. <i>Karl Marx, The Coming Revolution</i>. The
initials B.M., B. M., B. M., recurred repeatedly. But why never the
full name? There was an informality, an intimacy in the use of
initials that was very unlike Angela. Had she called him B. M. to
his face? He read on. "B. M. came unexpectedly after dinner.
Luckily, I was alone." That was only a year ago.
"Luckily"&mdash;why luckily?&mdash;"I was alone." Where had he been
that night? He checked the date in his engagement book. It had been
the night of the Mansion House dinner. And B. M. and Angela had
spent the evening alone! He tried to recall that evening. Was she
waiting up for him when he came back? Had the room looked just as
usual? Were there glasses on the table? Were the chairs drawn close
together? He could remember nothing&mdash;nothing whatever, nothing
except his own speech at the Mansion House dinner. It became more
and more inexplicable to him&mdash;the whole situation; his wife
receiving an unknown man alone. Perhaps the next volume would
explain. Hastily he reached for the last of the diaries&mdash;the
one she had left unfinished when she died. There, on the very first
page, was that cursed fellow again. "Dined alone with B.M...He
became very agitated. He said it was time we understood each
other...I tried to make him listen. But he would not. He threatened
that if I did not..." the rest of the page was scored over. She had
written "Egypt. Egypt. Egypt," over the whole page. He could not
make out a single word; but there could be only one interpretation:
the scoundrel had asked her to become his mistress. Alone in his
room! The blood rushed to Gilbert Clandon's face. He turned the
pages rapidly. What had been her answer? Initials had ceased. It
was simply "he" now. "He came again. I told him I could not come to
any decision...I implored him to leave me." He had forced himself
upon her in this very house. But why hadn't she told him? How could
she have hesitated for an instant? Then: "I wrote him a letter."
Then pages were left blank. Then there was this: "No answer to my
letter." Then more blank pages; and then this: "He has done what he
threatened." After that&mdash;what came after that? He turned page
after page. All were blank. But there, on the very day before her
death, was this entry: "Have I the courage to do it too?" That was
the end.</p>

<p>Gilbert Clandon let the book slide to the floor. He could see
her in front of him. She was standing on the kerb in Piccadilly.
Her eyes stared; her fists were clenched. Here came the car...</p>

<p>He could not bear it. He must know the truth. He strode to the
telephone.</p>

<p>"Miss Miller!" There was silence. Then he heard someone moving
in the room.</p>

<p>"Sissy Miller speaking"&mdash;her voice at last answered
him.</p>

<p>"Who," he thundered, "is B. M.?"</p>

<p>He could hear the cheap clock ticking on her mantelpiece; then a
long drawn sigh. Then at last she said:</p>

<p>"He was my brother."</p>

<p>He <i>was</i> her brother; her brother who had killed himself.
"Is there," he heard Sissy Miller asking, "anything that I can
explain?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" he cried. "Nothing!"</p>

<p>He had received his legacy. She had told him the truth. She had
stepped off the kerb to rejoin her lover. She had stepped off the
kerb to escape from him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>TOGETHER AND APART</h2>

<p>Mrs. Dalloway introduced them, saying you will like him. The
conversation began some minutes before anything was said, for both
Mr. Serle and Miss Arming looked at the sky and in both of their
minds the sky went on pouring its meaning though very differently,
until the presence of Mr. Serle by her side became so distinct to
Miss Anning that she could not see the sky, simply, itself, any
more, but the sky shored up by the tall body, dark eyes, grey hair,
clasped hands, the stern melancholy (but she had been told "falsely
melancholy") face of Roderick Serle, and, knowing how foolish it
was, she yet felt impelled to say:</p>

<p>"What a beautiful night!"</p>

<p>Foolish! Idiotically foolish! But if one mayn't be foolish at
the age of forty in the presence of the sky, which makes the wisest
imbecile&mdash;mere wisps of straw&mdash;she and Mr. Serle atoms,
motes, standing there at Mrs. Dalloway's window, and their lives,
seen by moonlight, as long as an insect's and no more
important.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Miss Anning, patting the sofa cushion emphatically.
And down he sat beside her. Was he "falsely melancholy," as they
said? Prompted by the sky, which seemed to make it all a little
futile&mdash;what they said, what they did&mdash;she said something
perfectly commonplace again:</p>

<p>"There was a Miss Serle who lived at Canterbury when I was a
girl there."</p>

<p>With the sky in his mind, all the tombs of his ancestors
immediately appeared to Mr. Serle in a blue romantic light, and his
eyes expanding and darkening, he said: "Yes.</p>

<p>"We are originally a Norman family, who came over with the
Conqueror. That is a Richard Serle buried in the Cathedral. He was
a knight of the garter."</p>

<p>Miss Arming felt that she had struck accidentally the true man,
upon whom the false man was built. Under the influence of the moon
(the moon which symbolized man to her, she could see it through a
chink of the curtain, and she took dips of the moon) she was
capable of saying almost anything and she settled in to disinter
the true man who was buried under the false, saying to herself:
"On, Stanley, on"&mdash;which was a watchword of hers, a secret
spur, or scourge such as middle-aged people often make to
flagellate some inveterate vice, hers being a deplorable timidity,
or rather indolence, for it was not so much that she lacked
courage, but lacked energy, especially in talking to men, who
frightened her rather, and so often her talks petered out into dull
commonplaces, and she had very few men friends&mdash;very few
intimate friends at all, she thought, but after all, did she want
them? No. She had Sarah, Arthur, the cottage, the chow and, of
course <i>that</i>, she thought, dipping herself, sousing herself,
even as she sat on the sofa beside Mr. Serle, in <i>that</i>, in
the sense she had coming home of something collected there, a
cluster of miracles, which she could not believe other people had
(since it was she only who had Arthur, Sarah, the cottage, and the
chow), but she soused herself again in the deep satisfactory
possession, feeling that what with this and the moon (music that
was, the moon), she could afford to leave this man and that pride
of his in the Serles buried. No! That was the danger&mdash;she must
not sink into torpidity&mdash;not at her age. "On, Stanley, on,"
she said to herself, and asked him:</p>

<p>"Do you know Canterbury yourself?"</p>

<p>Did he know Canterbury! Mr. Serle smiled, thinking how absurd a
question it was&mdash;how little she knew, this nice quiet woman
who played some instrument and seemed intelligent and had good
eyes, and was wearing a very nice old necklace&mdash;knew what it
meant. To be asked if he knew Canterbury. When the best years of
his life, all his memories, things he had never been able to tell
anybody, but had tried to write&mdash;ah, had tried to write (and
he sighed) all had centred in Canterbury; it made him laugh.</p>

<p>His sigh and then his laugh, his melancholy and his humour, made
people like him, and he knew it, and yet being liked had not made
up for the disappointment, and if he sponged on the liking people
had for him (paying long calls on sympathetic ladies, long, long
calls), it was half bitterly, for he had never done a tenth part of
what he could have done, and had dreamed of doing, as a boy in
Canterbury. With a stranger he felt a renewal of hope because they
could not say that he had not done what he had promised, and
yielding to his charm would give him a fresh start&mdash;at fifty!
She had touched the spring. Fields and flowers and grey buildings
dripped down into his mind, formed silver drops on the gaunt, dark
walls of his mind and dripped down. With such an image his poems
often began. He felt the desire to make images now, sitting by this
quiet woman.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know Canterbury," he said reminiscently, sentimentally,
inviting, Miss Anning felt, discreet questions, and that was what
made him interesting to so many people, and it was this
extraordinary facility and responsiveness to talk on his part that
had been his undoing, so he thought often, taking his studs out and
putting his keys and small change on the dressing-table after one
of these parties (and he went out sometimes almost every night in
the season), and, going down to breakfast, becoming quite
different, grumpy, unpleasant at breakfast to his wife, who was an
invalid, and never went out, but had old friends to see her
sometimes, women friends for the most part, interested in Indian
philosophy and different cures and different doctors, which
Roderick Serle snubbed off by some caustic remark too clever for
her to meet, except by gentle expostulations and a tear or
two&mdash;he had failed, he often thought, because he could not cut
himself off utterly from society and the company of women, which
was so necessary to him, and write. He had involved himself too
deep in life&mdash;and here he would cross his knees (all his
movements were a little unconventional and distinguished) and not
blame himself, but put the blame off upon the richness of his
nature, which he compared favourably with Wordsworth's, for
example, and, since he had given so much to people, he felt,
resting his head on his hands, they in their turn should help him,
and this was the prelude, tremulous, fascinating, exciting, to
talk; and images bubbled up in his mind.</p>

<p>"She's like a fruit tree&mdash;like a flowering cherry tree," he
said, looking at a youngish woman with fine white hair. It was a
nice sort of image, Ruth Anning thought&mdash;rather nice, yet she
did not feel sure that she liked this distinguished, melancholy man
with his gestures; and it's odd, she thought, how one's feelings
are influenced. She did not like <i>him</i>, though she rather
liked that comparison of his of a woman to a cherry tree. Fibres of
her were floated capriciously this way and that, like the tentacles
of a sea anemone, now thrilled, now snubbed, and her brain, miles
away, cool and distant, up in the air, received messages which it
would sum up in time so that, when people talked about Roderick
Serle (and he was a bit of a figure) she would say unhesitatingly:
"I like him," or "I don't like him," and her opinion would be made
up for ever. An odd thought; a solemn thought; throwing a green
light on what human fellowship consisted of.</p>

<p>"It's odd that you should know Canterbury," said Mr. Serle.
"It's always a shock," he went on (the white-haired lady having
passed), "when one meets someone" (they had never met before), "by
chance, as it were, who touches the fringe of what has meant a
great deal to oneself, touches accidentally, for I suppose
Canterbury was nothing but a nice old town to you. So you stayed
there one summer with an aunt?" (That was all Ruth Anning was going
to tell him about her visit to Canterbury.) "And you saw the sights
and went away and never thought of it again."</p>

<p>Let him think so; not liking him, she wanted him to run away
with an absurd idea of her. For really, her three months in
Canterbury had been amazing. She remembered to the last detail,
though it was merely a chance visit, going to see Miss Charlotte
Serle, an acquaintance of her aunt's. Even now she could repeat
Miss Serle's very words about the thunder. "Whenever I wake, or
hear thunder in the night, I think 'Someone has been killed'." And
she could see the hard, hairy, diamond-patterned carpet, and the
twinkling, suffused, brown eyes of the elderly lady, holding the
teacup out unfilled, while she said that about the thunder. And
always she saw Canterbury, all thundercloud and livid apple
blossom, and the long grey backs of the buildings.</p>

<p>The thunder roused her from her plethoric middle-aged swoon of
indifference; "On, Stanley, on," she said to herself; that is, this
man shall not glide away from me, like everybody else, on this
false assumption; I will tell him the truth.</p>

<p>"I loved Canterbury," she said.</p>

<p>He kindled instantly. It was his gift, his fault, his
destiny.</p>

<p>"Loved it," he repeated. "I can see that you did."</p>

<p>Her tentacles sent back the message that Roderick Serle was
nice.</p>

<p>Their eyes met; collided rather, for each felt that behind the
eyes the secluded being, who sits in darkness while his shallow
agile companion does all the tumbling and beckoning, and keeps the
show going, suddenly stood erect; flung off his cloak; confronted
the other. It was alarming; it was terrific. They were elderly and
burnished into a glowing smoothness, so that Roderick Serle would
go, perhaps to a dozen parties in a season, and feel nothing out of
the common, or only sentimental regrets, and the desire for pretty
images&mdash;like this of the flowering cherry tree&mdash;and all
the time there stagnated in him unstirred a sort of superiority to
his company, a sense of untapped resources, which sent him back
home dissatisfied with life, with himself, yawning, empty,
capricious. But now, quite suddenly, like a white bolt in a mist
(but this image forged itself with the inevitability of lightning
and loomed up), there it had happened; the old ecstasy of life; its
invincible assault; for it was unpleasant, at the same time that it
rejoiced and rejuvenated and filled the veins and nerves with
threads of ice and fire; it was terrifying. "Canterbury twenty
years ago," said Miss Anning, as one lays a shade over an intense
light, or covers some burning peach with a green leaf, for it is
too strong, too ripe, too full.</p>

<p>Sometimes she wished she had married. Sometimes the cool peace
of middle life, with its automatic devices for shielding mind and
body from bruises, seemed to her, compared with the thunder and the
livid apple-blossom of Canterbury, base. She could imagine
something different, more like lightning, more intense. She could
imagine some physical sensation. She could imagine&mdash;</p>

<p>And, strangely enough, for she had never seen him before, her
senses, those tentacles which were thrilled and snubbed, now sent
no more messages, now lay quiescent, as if she and Mr. Serle knew
each other so perfectly, were, in fact, so closely united that they
had only to float side by side down this stream.</p>

<p>Of all things, nothing is so strange as human intercourse, she
thought, because of its changes, its extraordinary irrationality,
her dislike being now nothing short of the most intense and
rapturous love, but directly the word "love" occurred to her, she
rejected it, thinking again how obscure the mind was, with its very
few words for all these astonishing perceptions, these alternations
of pain and pleasure. For how did one name this. That is what she
felt now, the withdrawal of human affection, Serle's disappearance,
and the instant need they were both under to cover up what was so
desolating and degrading to human nature that everyone tried to
bury it decently from sight&mdash;this withdrawal, this violation
of trust, and, seeking some decent acknowledged and accepted burial
form, she said:</p>

<p>"Of course, whatever they may do, they can't spoil
Canterbury."</p>

<p>He smiled; he accepted it; he crossed his knees the other way
about. She did her part; he his. So things came to an end. And over
them both came instantly that paralysing blankness of feeling, when
nothing bursts from the mind, when its walls appear like slate;
when vacancy almost hurts, and the eyes petrified and fixed see the
same spot&mdash;a pattern, a coal scuttle&mdash;with an exactness
which is terrifying, since no emotion, no idea, no impression of
any kind comes to change it, to modify it, to embellish it, since
the fountains of feeling seem sealed and as the mind turns rigid,
so does the body; stark, statuesque, so that neither Mr. Serle nor
Miss Anning could move or speak, and they felt as if an enchanter
had freed them, and spring flushed every vein with streams of life,
when Mira Cartwright, tapping Mr. Serle archly on the shoulder,
said:</p>

<p>"I saw you at the Meistersinger, and you cut me. Villain," said
Miss Cartwright, "you don't deserve that I should ever speak to you
again."</p>

<p>And they could separate.</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>A SUMMING UP</h2>

<p>Since it had grown hot and crowded indoors, since there could be
no danger on a night like this of damp, since the Chinese lanterns
seemed hung red and green fruit in the depths of an enchanted
forest, Mr. Bertram Pritchard led Mrs. Latham into the garden.</p>

<p>The open air and the sense of being out of doors bewildered
Sasha Latham, the tall, handsome, rather indolent looking lady,
whose majesty of presence was so great that people never credited
her with feeling perfectly inadequate and gauche when she had to
say something at a party. But so it was; and she was glad that she
was with Bertram, who could be trusted, even out of doors, to talk
without stopping. Written down what he said would be
incredible&mdash;not only was each thing he said in itself
insignificant, but there was no connection between the different
remarks. Indeed, if one had taken a pencil and written down his
very words&mdash;and one night of his talk would have filled a
whole book&mdash;no one could doubt, reading them, that the poor
man was intellectually deficient. This was far from the case, for
Mr. Pritchard was an esteemed civil servant and a Companion of the
Bath; but what was even stranger was that he was almost invariably
liked. There was a sound in his voice, some accent of emphasis,
some lustre in the incongruity of his ideas, some emanation from
his round, cubbby brown face and robin redbreast's figure,
something immaterial, and unseizable, which existed and flourished
and made itself felt independently of his words, indeed, often in
opposition to them. Thus Sasha Latham would be thinking while he
chattered on about his tour in Devonshire, about inns and
landladies, about Eddie and Freddie, about cows and night
travelling, about cream and stars, about continental railways and
Bradshaw, catching cod, catching cold, influenza, rheumatism and
Keats&mdash;she was thinking of him in the abstract as a person
whose existence was good, creating him as he spoke in the guise
that was different from what he said, and was certainly the true
Bertram Pritchard, even though one could not prove it. How could
one prove that he was a loyal friend and very sympathetic
and&mdash;but here, as so often happened, talking to Bertram
Pritchard, she forgot his existence, and began to think of
something else.</p>

<p>It was the night she thought of, hitching herself together in
some way, taking a look up into the sky. It was the country she
smelt suddenly, the sombre stillness of fields under the stars, but
here, in Mrs. Dalloway's back garden, in Westminster, the beauty,
country born and bred as she was, thrilled her because of the
contrast presumably; there the smell of hay in the air and behind
her the rooms full of people. She walked with Bertram; she walked
rather like a stag, with a little give of the ankles, fanning
herself, majestic, silent, with all her senses roused, her ears
pricked, snuffing the air, as if she had been some wild, but
perfectly controlled creature taking its pleasure by night.</p>

<p>This, she thought, is the greatest of marvels; the supreme
achievement of the human race. Where there were osier beds and
coracles paddling through a swamp, there is this; and she thought
of the dry, thick, well built house stored with valuables, humming
with people coming close to each other, going away from each other,
exchanging their views, stimulating each other. And Clarissa
Dalloway had made it open in the wastes of the night, had laid
paving stones over the bog, and, when they came to the end of the
garden (it was in fact extremely small), and she and Bertram sat
down on deck chairs, she looked at the house veneratingly,
enthusiastically, as if a golden shaft ran through her and tears
formed on it and fell in profound thanksgiving. Shy though she was
and almost incapable when suddenly presented to someone of saying
anything, fundamentally humble, she cherished a profound admiration
for other people. To be them would be marvellous, but she was
condemned to be herself and could only in this silent enthusiastic
way, sitting outside in a garden, applaud the society of humanity
from which she was excluded. Tags of poetry in praise of them rose
to her lips; they were adorable and good, above all courageous,
triumphers over night and fens, the survivors, the company of
adventurers who, set about with dangers, sail on.</p>

<p>By some malice of fate she was unable to join, but she could sit
and praise while Bertram chattered on, he being among the voyagers,
as cabin boy or common seaman&mdash;someone who ran up masts, gaily
whistling. Thinking thus, the branch of some tree in front of her
became soaked and steeped in her admiration for the people of the
house; dripped gold; or stood sentinel erect. It was part of the
gallant and carousing company a mast from which the flag streamed.
There was a barrel of some kind against the wall, and this, too,
she endowed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bertram, who was restless physically, wanted to explore
the grounds, and, jumping on to a heap of bricks he peered over the
garden wall. Sasha peered over too. She saw a bucket or perhaps a
boot. In a second the illusion vanished. There was London again;
the vast inattentive impersonal world; motor omnibuses; affairs;
lights before public houses; and yawning policemen.</p>

<p>Having satisfied his curiosity, and replenished, by a moment's
silence, his bubbling fountains of talk, Bertram invited Mr. and
Mrs. Somebody to sit with them, pulling up two more chairs. There
they sat again, looking at the same house, the same tree, the same
barrel; only having looked over the wall and had a glimpse of the
bucket, or rather of London going its ways unconcernedly, Sasha
could no longer spray over the world that cloud of gold. Bertram
talked and the somebodies&mdash;for the life of her she could not
remember if they were called Wallace or Freeman&mdash;answered, and
all their words passed through a thin haze of gold and fell into
prosaic daylight. She looked at the dry, thick Queen Anne House;
she did her best to remember what she had read at school about the
Isle of Thorney and men in coracles, oysters, and wild duck and
mists, but it seemed to her a logical affair of drains and
carpenters, and this party&mdash;nothing but people in evening
dress.</p>

<p>Then she asked herself, which view is the true one? She could
see the bucket and the house half lit up, half unlit.</p>

<p>She asked this question of that somebody whom, in her humble
way, she had composed out of the wisdom and power of other people.
The answer came often by accident&mdash;she had known her old
spaniel answer by wagging his tail.</p>

<p>Now the tree, denuded of its gilt and majesty, seemed to supply
her with an answer; became a field tree&mdash;the only one in a
marsh. She had often seen it; seen the red-flushed clouds between
its branches, or the moon split up, darting irregular flashes of
silver. But what answer? Well that the soul&mdash;for she was
conscious of a movement in her of some creature beating its way
about her and trying to escape which momentarily she called the
soul&mdash;is by nature unmated, a widow bird; a bird perched aloof
on that tree.</p>

<p>But then Bertram, putting his arm through hers in his familiar
way, for he had known her all her life, remarked that they were not
doing their duty and must go in.</p>

<p>At that moment, in some back street or public house, the usual
terrible sexless, inarticulate voice rang out; a shriek, a cry. And
the widow bird, startled, flew away, describing wider and wider
circles until it became (what she called her soul) remote as a crow
which has been startled up into the air by a stone thrown at
it.</p>
