<h2>COSTUMES.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>MEN.</h3>

<p>1. THE WARDEN is a mature man, between fifty and sixty. He
should be of stalwart proportions, has been a soldier accustomed to
command and to be obeyed. He speaks brusquely and imperiously.
Undress officer's uniform.</p>

<p>2. LORD GLENDARGLE is a handsome manly "Johnnie" slender and of
middle height, distinguished by a certain air of distinction though
without an atom of " side." He is a man of thirty-five, light brown
hair and moustache. <i>1st Dress</i>.&mdash;A light tweed suit,
rather soiled, a soiled lawn tennis shirt, yellow boots, and brown
felt hat. <i>2nd Dress</i>.&mdash;ACT V. Frock coat, white vest,
light trousers, white hat, and wedding favour.</p>

<p>3. VON SWOP, a German speculator. A man of sixty, with
pronounced features. <i>1st Dress</i>.&mdash;A vest of opal velvet
is festooned with huge chains, and there is a great diamond stud in
his shirt front. A pickle cabbage necktie, white hat with a broad
black band. A flaming crimson silk handkerchief continually in
evidence. When he is not smoking a cigar he is taking snuff. His
hands are covered with rings. He carries a pocket-book full of bank
notes, attached to a chain in his pocket. <i>2nd
Dress</i>.&mdash;Change for wedding&mdash;equally loud toned, a
crimson vest, etc.</p>

<p>4. BIG BEN&mdash;A handsome, stalwart, broad-chested, finely
proportioned man of forty, bronzed and bearded. His hair has been a
golden brown, and though streaked with grey here and there, catches
the sun, and retains traces of its former beauty. When he makes his
first appearance his hair and beard are matted, his eyes bloodshot
and inflamed. His whole appearance indicates that he has been
drinking, and is under the influence of liquor. His manner though
brusque, abrupt, and taciturn has a certain air of distinction, and
he is at all times a gentleman. He is sobered the instant SYBIL
appears; from that time to the end of the play he "casts his
nighted colour off," and is himself again. Whenever he appears he
dominates the Scene. <i>1st Dress</i>.&mdash;That of an ordinary
digger. Leather hunting jacket, grey flannel garibaldi,
heather-brown knickers, old ridingboots, all travel-worn and
soiled. Black silk handkerchief loosely tied round neck, soft brown
felt hat. Digger's rug and impedimenta for 1st SCENE.</p>

<p>5. SAILOR JACK.&mdash;Tall handsome fellow of five or six and
twenty, fair and bearded. Frank, open, sailor-like manners, but a
little rough. and hot-tempered. <i>Dress</i>.&mdash;That of a
man-of-war's, very soiled and worn. Trousers tucked into a pair of
tanned leather leggings which reach up to the knee. This dress is
worn throughout the play&mdash;except in Act V where he changes to
light suit for wedding.</p>

<p>6. YORKSHIRE DICK, a genuine Tyke. Golden hair, whiskers, and
moustache. A sturdily built fellow of five and thirty. He speaks
with the accent of the West Riding. "Tho' rugged as his native
North, he is as modest as he is manly, as tender as he is true."
<i>Dress</i>.-Brown leather jacket and trousers, tucked into
leggings of tanned leather. A garibaldi of dark blue flannel. Act
V. In deep mourning.</p>

<p>7. MYLES OF CLONAKILTY.&mdash;A bright, vivacious "Irish boy" of
five-and-twenty; auburn hair and whiskers. <i>1st
Dress</i>.-Knickers of drab Irish freize. Soft felt steeple crowned
drab hat. Knitted worsted stockings to match, rolled up above the
knees. Yellow boots. Loose white flannel garibaldi. <i>2nd
Dress</i>.&mdash;Wedding dress: green frock coat, brass buttons.
Drab vest and trousers. Pumps. White top hat. White shirt and green
necktie.</p>

<p>8. THE CAPTAIN&mdash;Tall, handsome, well-preserved man of
five-and-thirty; dark hair, dark military moustache, the bearing of
an indolent soldier&mdash;a masher and a lady-killer. A man who has
been a gentleman, and who still maintains the manners of one. He
wears an eyeglass and smokes cigarettes. He is continually
adjusting the one and smoking the other. Ordinarily he has a
languid, insolent manner, but when roused to wrath he is terribly
in earnest. His insolence and brutality are real, his love-making
(notably Act III.) is false, but earnestly and admirably simulated.
<i>1st Dress</i>.&mdash;Brown velvet jacket. Scarlet garibaldi.
Brown sash round waist. Yellow handkerchief for neck. Brown
knickers. Yellow knee boots. Drab bowler hat. All kept much more
smartly than those of any other man in the field. <i>2nd
Dress</i>.&mdash;Act V, The former, soiled and very much worn. His
beard has grown. He is haggard, and a woeful looking object.</p>

<p>9. BENDIGO BILL.&mdash;An ex-pugilist; a great, stalwart, red
headed ruffian with a broken nose, a patch over his left eye, a
manner brutal and bullying. <i>Dress</i>.&mdash;Dark woollen jacket
and trousers. Tanned leather leggings. Yellow garibaldi, striped
with black. Black cowboy's hat.</p>

<p>10. MELBOURNE JERRY.&mdash;A larrikin of one-and-twenty, one of
the criminal classes. A beardless young ruffian. Dark hair, cropped
to the poll, except for two carefully-kept love-locks on either
side. <i>Dress</i>.&mdash;Brown corduroy jacket and trousers. Red
and black jersey outside trousers. Yellow and black cap. Trousers
and jacket, cut like our own costers', and profusely decorated with
mother-of-pearl buttons. <i>2nd Dress</i>.&mdash;In Last Act a
grotesquely-cut dress suit, ever so much too big for him.</p>

<p>11. WALLAROO.&mdash;Aboriginal Australian. A proper design will
be provided for this character.</p>

<p>12. MACDONALD.&mdash;Chief of Police. Stalwart Scotsman of
forty. Has been a soldier. <i>Dress</i>.&mdash;Accurate costume of
the period.</p>

<h3>WOMEN.</h3>

<p>1. THE WIDOW O'MARA.&mdash;Buxom fine woman of thirty. Frank,
pleasant manners. Bright as sunshine. <i>Dress</i>.&mdash;Act
I.&mdash;Light cotton gown. Tucker for neck. Coquettish cap and
ribbon for hair. Nattily cut apron, with pockets. Act
II.&mdash;Scotch kirtle jacket, turned up to elbows. Short woollen
petticoat, giving glimpse of ankle. Act III-Dark gown, skirt pinned
back showing green petticoat. Change to nightgown and cap for End
Of Act. Act IV.&mdash;Black gown and dark shawl. Act
V.&mdash;Wedding dress, orange blossoms, etc.</p>

<p>2. SYBIL GREY.&mdash;Young, accomplished, and well-bred. The
best type of an innocent English girl. A stranger in a strange
land. By her mother's death and the loss of her sister, she is
driven to obtain her livelihood by honest work of any kind. Proud
without being haughty, reticent without being rude. "A daughter of
the gods&mdash;divinely tall and most divinely fair;" that is, as
fair as a girl with hair of golden brown, deeply fringed eyelashes,
dark brows, and rosy cheeks can be. "Her voice is music and her
breath sweet air." <i>1st Dress</i>.&mdash;A dark grey woollen
travelling costume; long cloak, hat and gloves. Dress quite plain,
white band at neck, ditto at cuffs. <i>2nd Dress</i>.&mdash;Cloak
and hat removed. Apron with bodice piece, smart cap and ribbon.
<i>3rd Dress</i>.&mdash;Act II. Plain blue and white cotton striped
blouse. Dark short woollen petticoat, apron dainty, trimned leather
shoes, lavender c0loured stockings. <i>4th Dress</i>.&mdash;Act
III. Lavender coloured blouse and petticoat to match, trimmed with
black, cap, apron. Change to nightdress and cloak of ACT I. <i>5th
Dress</i>.&mdash;Same as ACT I. Dark cloak and hat. <i>6th
Dress</i>.&mdash;Act V. Deep mourning. Long dark cloak and hat.</p>

<p>3. NELLIE.&mdash;Handsome, well-proportioned woman of four and
twenty. Although rather coquettish, she is overshadowed with a
great sorrow and a great remorse. She is of a weak, but warm and
affectionate nature. <i>1st Dress</i>.&mdash;A worn blouse of
soiled pink, a striped petticoat, both very much worn and soiled; a
worn cloak thrown over her shoulders, a coloured handkerchief over
her head pinned under her chin. Everything coquettish, but the
worse for wear. <i>2nd Dress</i>.&mdash;Act II. All very bright.
New cotton blouse of pink, petticoat and bunch of ribbons to match,
dainty embroidered scarlet stockings, natty shoes of tanned
leather. <i>3rd Dress</i>.&mdash;Sailor's "man-o'-war's man" shirt
and straw hat, band round it. Blue serge shirt, all very smart and
bright. Change to nightdress. (Note.&mdash;<i>No petticoats
undemeath.)</i></p>

you?"</p>

manner and bearing are brusque to the last degree. Hair and beard
rough and unkempt. All the signs of an habitual drunkard, but the
breeding of a gentleman shines. through it all. At sight of BEN,

<p>BEN. Only more so. Began early this morning with a bottle of
whisky.</p>

<p>DICK. Whisky?</p>

<p>BEN. Well, you see, we were out of water, and as I was

soda, Katty. It's dry as a lime kiln I am.</p>

<p>KATH. We've neither soda nor water, Ben.</p>

<p>BEN. Then dilute the brandy with whisky. It will go down the
easier. <i>(ALL laugh.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. And so would you. Ah, man alive, is it afther killing you
I'd be?</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(With a hard laugh.)</i> What's it matter, wench? I'm no
good living. <i>(Bitterly.)</i> The sooner I'm dead the better.</p>

<p>KATH. Arrah, don't talk nonsense. A live boy like you is betther
than a dozen dead men. Sure, it's a bottle of fiz you're wantin',
and there it is.</p>

<p>BEN. But I can't pay you.</p>

<p>KATH. It's from home.</p>

<p>BEN. Home?</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(Sympathetically.)</i> Yes, lad, but sure it's in
mourning, so it is.</p>

<p>BEN. In mourning? <i>(Takes letter, mechanically eyeing the
black border, then looks at post-mark and starts into C. opens

<p>BEN. (C.) One whose death gives me life!</p>

<p>GLEN. <i>(Aside to DICK.)</i> He means the drunken wife.</p>

<p>DICK. Hush!</p>

<p>BEN. I <i>was</i> bound to a corpse&mdash;a pestilence which
poisoned the springs of life. It has rotted away. The</p>

<p>chains which fettered body and soul are broken. I
breathe&mdash;I live&mdash;I am a man once more&mdash;free! Free!
free! <i>(Crosses to L. and back to C.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. There's the coach from Southern Cross. Look out, boys, for
my lady-help. <i>(SHE runs to meet HER L.C.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. I'm off to-morrow by that same coach.</p>

<p>JACK. Where to, man?</p>

<p>BEN. To Melbourne.</p>

<p>JACK. To Melbourne! What to do?</p>

<p>BEN. To turn a fable into a fact&mdash;solve the enigma that has
baffled mankind ever since the world began. I go to seek&mdash;a
paradox.</p>

<p>JACK. A para&mdash;! What's that?</p>

<p>BEN. A constant woman. <i>(Crosses down to R. radiant with
hope.)</i></p>

<p>JACK. <i>(L. laughing.)</i> Ho, ho, ho! That's a wild goose
chase, and one a chap had better get screwed to start on! So take

God's earth. Sybil&mdash;I&mdash;<i>(Approaching HER. SHE turns

Coolgardie!"</p>

<p>BEN. (L.) My God! what does it all mean?</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(C. Who has watched the scene eagerly, Crosses to BEN
surprised.)</i> Ben, what's dreaming abaght? Thou hast spilt thy
liquor!</p>

<p>BEN. (L.) Damn the liquor!</p>

<p>DICK. Naa, lad, it's bad to damn good stuff. Have another glass.

<p>GLEN. Another glass! Another bottle! Come on, old man, and let
us drink "To the Duchess of Coolgardie!"</p>

<p>OMNES. <i>(Drinking.)</i> Aye, aye, "The Duchess of
Coolgardie."</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Crosses to C. eagerly.)</i> Aye, aye! <i>(Takes

<p>SYBIL. (L.C.) Wide enough indeed, if this be the measure of your
confidence.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(C.)</i> Confidence! <i>(Bitterly.)</i> I gave you

<p>NELL. <i>(Angered.)</i> A bad one! <i>(Restraining herself.)</i>
I won't be angry, dear, only tell me where you have been and what
you've been doing. For the past three days and nights I have never
even seen or heard of you. All that time I've been alone in those
squalid lodgings, penniless. and destitute.</p>

<p>CAPT. There&mdash;there, that'll do! Since we can't agree, the
best thing we can do is to part.</p>

<p>NELL. What! what?</p>

<p>CAPT. Let's see how we stand. Assets&mdash;ahem! A budget of
lovers' vows&mdash;pretty evenly balanced. On the one side&mdash;a
barbarous ruffian, that's me&mdash;on the other&mdash;a frail fair
one, that's you.</p>

blue. <i>(NELL ceases to weep.)</i> Ah! I thought that would wake
you up. Now revenons! <i>(Examining gold.)</i> Five golden James's.
As I like to be generous I'll give you two. <i>(Puts sovereigns in

<p>NELL. <i>(Dazed.)</i> Money&mdash;money! For me? For me?</p>

<p>CAPT. Oui, pour vois, ma chere! You are still young and pretty,
and can find heaps of admirers, so go your way, cherie, and leave
me to go mine.</p>

<p>NELL. What do you mean?</p>

<p>CAPT. I mean&mdash;I'm tired of you. <i>(Crosses down to

<p>NELL. Tired! <i>(Starts up.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. Yes, you bore me. So adieu, ma chere! Bon voyage!</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(Starting to her feet&mdash;indignantly, C.)</i> Take

vanished, and I loathe where once I loved.</p>

<p>SYBIL. Thank God for that, for your emancipation has already
begun. Now for your child!</p>

<p>NELL. Child? My child? Alas, I <i>have</i> none. When I awoke
from my long fever my darling was dead.</p>

<p>SYBIL. Who told you so?</p>

<p>NELL. <i>He</i> did.</p>

<p>SYBIL. The villain lied!</p>

<p>NELL. Lied?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Yes&mdash;lied! He sent the boy to me with news of
<i>your</i> death!</p>

<p>NELL. Mine! Mine! <i>(Astonished.)</i></p>

<p>SYBIL. Yes, <i>yours</i>. But take heart, for your child
lives!</p>

<p>NELL. Lives! <i>(Amazed.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. Well, we're all in it, of course.</p>

<p>BILL. JERRY. MINERS. In course we is! Yes, yes, all!</p>

<p>MYLES. Divil a bit! Yon are all out of it. Do you think I went
navigating, like Captain Cook, to fill <i>your</i> pockets? Divil a
fear! My discovery was made for honest boys like myself!</p>

<p><i>(Re-enter, quickly and excitedly, door R.C., BEN, DICK,
SAILOR JACK, and GLENDARGLE followed by WALLAROO.)</i>
</p>

<p>MYLES. And here they are! What do you think of that, boys?
<i>(Showiug nugget.)</i></p>

<p><i>(BEN, DICK, JACK, GLEN. drop down L.C.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(L.C.)</i> By Jove! A hundred ounces, if it's a
pennyweight.</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(L.C.)</i> Yea, lad, and nearly all pure stuff.</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(R.C.)</i> Well, this takes the biscuit!</p>

<p>GLEN. <i>(L.C.)</i> It's wonderful!</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(C.)</i> I thought it would wipe the cobwebs out of
your eyelashes.</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(R.)</i> Well, it does, and no flies!</p>

<p>MYLES. And there's lashens more where this comes from.</p>

<p>MINERS. You don't say so!</p>

<p>MYLES. But I do! Sure it comes croppin' up in ridges like rows
of pitaties.</p>

<p>BEN. Of course you secured the claim, Myles?
<i>(Abruptly.)</i></p>

<p>MYLES. Av course! Didn't I find it?</p>

<p>BEN. Yes, but did you peg it out?</p>

<p>MYLES. Ah, sure&mdash;I had no time to stop for thrifies like
pegs.</p>

<p>BEN. Don't you know that anyone who pegs out before us can
"jump" it?</p>

<p>MYLES. The divil they can! <i>(Alarmed.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Quickly, aside to BILL and JERRY.)</i> Rather! And
we're the boys to do it! <i>(Takes his gang up and bundles them off
R.C.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Quickly.)</i> While you pack up the tools I'll be off
and hire Bennett's team and a couple of camels to follow with water
and tucker. Mind, if we mean to secure that claim, we haven't a
moment to lose.</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(R.C.)</i> Myles, you thafe o' the world, what's this I
hear? ye've found a goold mine?</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(C.)</i> Of course I have, and here's a chunk of it.
<i>(Showing nugget.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. <i>(Taking nugget.)</i> Murther alive! And so this is real
quartz?</p>

<p>MYLES. Quarts? Sure it's pints, gallons, kilderkins,
hogsheads.</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(Beckoning on SYBIL.)</i> Luk at that jewel&mdash;smell

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Takes it.)</i> And so this is real gold, sir?</p>

<p>MYLES. Faix, you may say that wid your own purty mouth,
Miss.</p>

<p><i>(SYBIL smiles and drops a curtsey as SHE returns nugget and
goes up to KATTY.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(Aside.)</i> Who is that gorgeous creature, Jack?</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(L.C.)</i> The Duchess of Coolgardie!</p>

<p>MYLES. Begorra! she luks like a queen, she's that regal. But who
is she at all, at all?</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(Aside.)</i> Katty's new lady-help.</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(Aside.)</i> Tare an' 'ouns! But it's afeard I'd be to
ax her for anything less than champagne wine and five shilling
cigars.</p>

<p>JACK. I'll chance it. <i>(C. with an elaborate bow.)</i>
Duchess, may we have drinks all round?</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Gaily.)</i> Certainly, Mr Sailor. <i>(Goes up to
bar.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. Give it a name, boys.</p>

<p>MYLES. John Jameson.</p>

<p>OMNES. Aye, aye!</p>

with tray filled with glasses. Men help themselves.)</i>
</p>

<p>GLEN. Now, boys, all charged?</p>

<p>OMNES. Aye, aye!</p>

<p>GLEN. Then here's the disthressful country&mdash;here's to old
Ireland.</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(Enthusiastically.)</i> Right, your sowl, right! Owld
Ireland for ever! Here's "The County Wicklow, and the Gap o'
Dunloe!"</p>

</p>

<p>TABLEAU II.&mdash;THE FIGHT FOR THE GREAT NUGGET.</p>

<h3>SCENE 2.</h3>

<p><i>The wilderness. This scene, which occupies the whole stage,
should indicate the wild shrub, dense foliage of the eucalypti and
indigenous gum trees of the Australian regions. Practicable rushes
should be set at back to enable the CAPT., JERRY, and BENDIGO BILL
to hide behind. The scene begins with characteristic Music which
should suggest the chirping of birds and m1trmuring of insects
awakening from the repose and silence o/ night. The graduation of
light conveys the impression that the day is breaking in the
forest, and the passage of time from one day to the beginning of
another is indicated by skilful manipulation of mediums, floats,
borders, and limelights.</i>
</p>

<p>The flaming red sun slowly rises from the horizon.</p>

<p>MUSIC seque to Myles Music.</p>

<p><i>(MYLES descends from eminence C., plucks aside the rushes,
comes forward and "Cooeys." BEN, JAVK, and DICK reply from withoit,
and then enter severally, carrying miner's swag. BEN. down C.
platform. JACK down platform R. DICK down platform L. THEY are
followed cautiously by the CAPT., BENDIGO BILL, and JERRY. CAPTAIN
down C. BILL down L. JERRY down R.&mdash;he comes a cropper, and
slides down behind rushes. CAPTAIN and BILL hide behind
rushes.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>The MUSIC which has alternately been pp. and ff. now
ceases.</i>
</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(R.C.)</i> We are near the spot, boys. Begorra, here
it is!</p>

<p>OMNES. Where?</p>

<p>MYLES. Here! no, it isn,'t. But sure it's mighty like
it&mdash;as like as two paase in one pod.</p>

<p>BEN. That doesn't help us much. Have you no clue of any
kind?</p>

<p>MYLES. Bedad, but I have! Sure, I left my pick stickin' in the
ground on the very spot where I found the stuff.</p>

<p>BEN. Well, that's better than nothing.</p>

<p>MYLES. Anyhow it's better than a pulthogue on the side o' the
head.</p>

<p>JACK. We'd better crowd all sail or we shall have the girls here
with the waggon before we begin.</p>

<p>MYLES. To be sure. For Katty has got the tame, and the tint, and
the grub, and a case of "boy," and beside that <i>a keg of raal</i>
John Jameson,</p>

<p>BEN. Let us each take a separate path and the first who comes
upon Myles' pick will give the signal.</p>

<p><i>(Exit BIG BEN R. 1 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>DICK. Reet you are, Ben. Here goes!</p>

<p><i>(Exit DICK L. 2 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>JACK. I'm off this way. <i>(Exit JACK R. 3 E.)</i></p>

<p>MYLES. And I this. And when we mate agin maybe we'll join sharp,
like the divil's toe-nails.</p>

<p><i>(Exit MYLES L. 1 E.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(The CAPT., BENDIGO BILL, JERRY, emerge from rushes and
beckon down platform four great bearded ruffians, ALL tracked by W
ALLAROO who comes down C. and hides behind rushes.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(The MUSIC begins.)</i>
</p>

<p>CAPT. After 'em! Sharp's the word!</p>

<p>BILL. And quick's the action!</p>

<p><i>(Exit BILL L. 1 E. and two ruffians.)</i>
</p>

<p>CAPT. Now, Master Ben, for you!</p>

<p><i>(Exit after BEN with two other ruffians R. 1 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>JERRY. The chippin's a-goin' to begin, so I'll retire and see
fair play in the rear.</p>

<p><i>(Exit JERRY L. 2 E.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(The face of WALLAROO is now seen through the bushes behind.
He crawls forward like a snake on the ground, then springs erect,
and rushes over to 1 E.R.H. Looks after CAPT. with a savage
chuckle.)</i>
</p>

<p>WALL. Last now, Cap'n! First byme-bye!</p>

<p><i>(He is moving off cautiously after CAPTAIN R. 1 E.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(MUSIC [loud] ff. of harness bells. WALL. springing to his
feet, looks off L. 2 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>WALL. <i>(Clapping his hands with delight.)</i> Big gee-gee!
lubly white queen and lillie pickalilly! <i>(Runs off

around with surprise.)</i>

<p>KATH. <i>(C.)</i> Why, where are we at all, at all,
Glendargle!</p>

<p>GLEN. <i>(R.C.)</i> This is the rendezvous, Katty, so, for the
present, suppose we call it home!</p>

<p>KATH. Home! G'long with you! Am I to begin business wid the
wombats and the kangaroos! <i>(crosses to R.)</i></p>

<p>GLEN. <i>(L.C.)</i> Oh, when the boys join you'll soon have
customers galore. Meanwhile. we must get the tent up and the stores
out.</p>

<p><i>(Exit GLEN. L. 3 E.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(Enter SYBIL L. 2 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. What a lovely spot! A perfect garden of ferns and
flowers. <i>(Looks around admiringly.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Enter NELL L. 2 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>NELL. Sybil, what have you done with the child!</p>

<p>SYBIL. Left him with that fellow Wallaroo, yonder.</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(Alarmed.)</i> With that savage?</p>

<p>KATH. Oh, the crayture's not a cannibal!</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(Aside.)</i> Lost so long&mdash;so newly found&mdash;I
dare not trust my darling out of sight&mdash;not even for a moment.
Where, oh, where is he?</p>

<p>WALL. <i>(Runs on from L. 2 E. with baby in his arms.)</i> Come

<p>NELL. Harry! Harry! <i>(Runs off after WALL.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. Ah, thim three'll be as thick as thieves in two minutes.
Meanwhile we want wood for a fire, so while I gather some sticks
you had betther look after the waggun, Duchess, and make yourself
at home.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Solus.)</i> Home! Home here! In this wilderness?
<i>(Down C.)</i> Yet while <i>he</i> is here&mdash;it is a Paradise
and not a wilderness! For three years&mdash;three long
years&mdash;it has been my hope by day, my dream by night, that I
should find him. Yet now&mdash;now that the hour has come, we are
as far apart as the poles. <i>(Goes up L.C.)</i> But 'twill not be
for ever. No, no! for when he looks into my eyes he will read the
truth there. Heaven send it may be soon.</p>

<p>Re-enter JACK from eminence at back R. and down C. platform.</p>

<p>JACK. I've found nothing and lost my latitude in this
God-forgotten place. Well, this is a rum look-out! I've got back to

snag&mdash;beastly rotten old stump!</p>

the moss which covers it, revealing to his astonished gaze a
monster nugget of gold.)</i>

<p>CAPTAIN. BILL. JACK. JERRY.</p>

<p><i>(The fight for the nugget begins. The CAPTAIN rushes on JACK,
WHO strikes at HIM with spade. HE recoils R. JERRY now jumps in,
clasping JACK's waist. BILL closes behind securing HIS arms. By a
vigorous kick JACK sends JERRY sprawling to R.H., and gives BILL a
terrific facer which sends him L. with a roar of pain. At that
moment the CAPT. strikes JACK a heavy blow on the head with the
spade. HE staggers, utters a cry, and falls senseless on the ground

sheltering JACK.)</i>

<p>SYBIL <i>(C.)</i> Hold! hold! <i>(To CAPT.)</i> Will you stand
by and see murder done?</p>

<p>CAPT. We don't want murder, but we do want that! <i>(Indicating
nugget.)</i> And we mean to have it!</p>

<p>SYBIL. Help there! Help!</p>

<p>CAPT. Stop her mouth!</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(R.)</i> Muster Garth! Her pen'lum has gone wrong, too.
Seems ah'm one too many here, so ah'd better get back tot'
grub!</p>

<p><i>(Exit into tent.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(C.)</i> Another moment and all would have been clear.
Will it be ever thus? Must my pride and his jealous anger always
stand 'twixt me and happiness?</p>

<p>Music "Tom Bowling" pp.</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(Awaking, faintly.)</i> Avast there! What cheer?</p>

<p><i>(SYBIL starts up and goes over to HIM. HE recognises
HER.)</i>
</p>

<p>JACK. Why it is!&mdash;shiver my timbers&mdash;if it ain't! The
Duchess!</p>

<p>SYBIL. Let me help you. <i>(SHE assists HIM to rise, and to sit
on barrow C.)</i></p>

<p>pp. Music ends.</p>

<p>SBIL <i>(R.C.)</i> You are better? Stronger already?</p>

<p>JACK. As a house a-fire <i>(rises, but staggers and falls
back)</i>, only I haven't quite got my sea legs yet.</p>

<p>SYBIL. So soon as they've settled about the mine, we must pack
you off home.</p>

<p><i>(Re-enter BEN L. 3 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>JACK. Lord love your dear heart&mdash;I ain't got no home.</p>

<p>SYBIL. No?</p>

<p>JACK. Neither home nor friends.</p>

<p>SYBIL. Yes&mdash;one&mdash;</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Coming forward L.)</i> Two, lad! two.</p>

<p>JACK. Ah&mdash;Ben, old chap&mdash;if it hadn't been for you, I
should have been in Kingdom Come long ago.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Coldly.)</i> Oh, you owe more to this lady than to
me.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Aloud R.C.)</i> Your friend owes me nothing, sir.</p>

<p><i>(Aside.)</i> Still obdurate&mdash;well, he shall find I can
be as proud as he. <i>(Exit behind tent R. 2 E.)</i></p>

<p>JACK. <i>(R.C.)</i> I say, Ben&mdash;I wonder how you came to
cotton to a rough chap like me.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(L.C.)</i> Well, the fact is, you remind me of a brother
of mine.</p>

<p>JACK. A brother of yours?</p>

<p>BEN. Yes&mdash;an only one&mdash;a little chap I lost ever so
long ago.</p>

<p>JACK. And you remind me of a brother of mine&mdash;an only
one.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Quickly.)</i> Indeed!</p>

<p>JACK. Yes, indeed&mdash;a great big chap that I lost ever so
long ago.</p>

<p>BEN. No!</p>

<p>JACK. Yes.</p>

<p>BEN. Indeed! <i>(A moment's pause.)</i> What part of the Old
Country do you hail from?</p>

<p>JACK. Norwich.</p>

<p>BEN. Norwich!</p>

<p>JACK. Do you know it?</p>

<p>BEN. I ought to&mdash;seeing it's my birthplace.</p>

<p>JACK. Your birthplace? Happen then you've heard of the
Leighs?</p>

<p>BEN. Of Holmleigh?</p>

<p>JACK. Yes.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Aside.)</i> My God, should it be?</p>

<p>JACK. I was only a little kiddy-widdy when the old folks
died.</p>

<p>BEN. Yes&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>JACK. And my big brother-</p>

<p>BEN. Lionel?</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(Astonished.)</i> You knew him too?</p>

<p>BEN. Slightly.</p>

<p>JACK. Damme, if I don't think you know everybody.</p>

<p>BEN. Not exactly&mdash;but I knew him.</p>

<p>JAUK. No!</p>

<p>BEN. Yes!</p>

<p>JACK. My dear eyes.</p>

<p>BEN. You see we were at Balliol together&mdash;rowed in the
'Varsity eight together&mdash;entered at Lincoln's Inn, and passed
together&mdash;</p>

<p>JACK. Lord&mdash;Lord. Who'd ha' thought o' meetin' a chum o'
dear old Leo's out here in the bush? God's truth&mdash;I'd give all
I have in the world to see his face&mdash;to hear his voice.</p>

<p>BEN. Would you?</p>

<p>JACK. Would I? Ah, you don't know! How should you? I'm a
precious bad lot&mdash;ran away, went to sea and broke poor
mother's heart. Leo's sure to be down on me, yet he was fond of me
once. And could I only hear him say-" Jack, I forgive you!"</p>

<p>BEN. Jack, I forgive you!</p>

<p>JACK. What&mdash;what&mdash;you don't mean&mdash;you are
not!</p>

<p>BEN. Yes&mdash;Jack&mdash;I am!</p>

<p>JACK. Well, I'm damned. <i>(Pause.)</i> I say, Leo, old chap,
d'ye mean it?</p>

<p>BEN. Yes!</p>

<p>JACK. Really?</p>

<p>BEN. Really!</p>

<p>JACK. Then tip us your flipper, old man.</p>

<p><i>(THEY shake hands heartily&mdash;then rise.)</i>
</p>

<p>JACK. My eyes, Leo, but this will be a surprise to our
mates!</p>

<p>BEN. A joyful one&mdash;come with me and we'll break it to
'em.</p>

<p><i>(BEN pulls JACK round L. as HE moves towards tent R.)</i>
</p>

<p>JACK. We will&mdash;we will. <i>(HE moves towards tent supported
by BEN.)</i> Only think, after losin' our reckoning all these
years, to find our latitude in this rum way!</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(R.)</i> No matter, since we have met at last.</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(R.C.)</i> Never to part again, old man!</p>

<p>BEN. Never!&mdash;Never!</p>

<p>BILL. <i>(L.C.-Pointing to bucket.)</i> They have been washing
gold in this bucket. It is a bit thick, but&mdash;</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(Up C.)</i> Thick or thin, let's have a pull.
<i>(Drinks from bucket and smudges his face.)</i> Oh, smother
me.</p>

<p><i>(Sneezing.)</i> Here's a blooming mess I'm in.</p>

<p><i>(Throws bucket down. BILL laughs and moves wheelbarrow
towards L.)</i>
</p>

<p>JERRY. That's a pretty thing to laugh at. Lend us your wipe.</p>

<p>BILL. Can't. It's at the wash. <i>(Grins.)</i> <i>(Exit L. 2
E.)</i></p>

<p>JERRY. Wash your mother. Gawn-'oo are yer a-gettin' at?

<p>JERRY. Easy does it! Bill&mdash;Bill! <i>(Calling BILL on and
appealing to HIM for protection.)</i> Bill, you're a perfessional
bruser, jist cool this wild Irishman's cawfee!</p>

<p>BILL. <i>(L.)</i> I will, make no error. <i>(crosses to C.)</i>
Do you want your chump knocked off, Mr Paddy from Cork?</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(R.C.)</i> It's not Paddy from Cork I am, but Myles
from Ballynamuck, Misther Bully Born Drunk.</p>

<p>BILL. <i>(With a roar.)</i> "Born Drunk!"</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(R.C.)</i> I said "Born Drunk."</p>

<p>BILL. Tell 'ee what it is, I'll give you the darndest
hiding&mdash;</p>

<p>MYLES. Will ye, now? Arrah, only let me be standin' by when you
do it, jewel, and thrust me to give yez your change.</p>

<p>BILL. Remember I licked Sloppy Sam, the champion of
Coolgardie.</p>

<p>MYLES. But I am the champion of Ballynamuck, who never was
licked, and never mane to be. so come on, bad luck to ye! Come on!
<i>(Spars about nimbly.)</i></p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(L. alarmed.)</i> Oh, slap it on, Bill, and give him
"what for! "</p>

hop about sparring. BILL and JERRY get round R. LARR., dodging
behind BILL, gets knocked down.)</i>

</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(L.C.)</i> Hullo&mdash;what's up, Myles?</p>

<p>MYLES. A fight, yer sowl, a fight&mdash;I haven't had one for a

<p>MYLES. Faix, you're right, jewel&mdash;so I'll let thim severely

<p>JERRY. <i>(R.)</i> And you've lots of grub and we've none, we

<p>MYLES. <i>(Shrugging his shoulders.)</i> Katty, in Heaven's name
give the bla'guards a skinful and let 'em go to the devil. <i>(BILL
and JERRY move up R. with alacrity. MYLES goes over to
DICK.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. <i>(R.)</i> This way, ye murtherin' villains. <i>(crosses
to tent in front of BILL and JERRY.)</i> And mind ye behave

them.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Exit into tent R.)</i>
</p>

<p>BILL. Now for the lush l</p>

</p>

<p>JERRY. And the grub. Lord be praised, that wild Irishman has
left me a place to put it in.</p>

<p><i>(Exit into tent.)</i>
</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(L.C.)</i> Myles, hadn't we better keep an eye on them
wastrels?</p>

<p>MYLES. By jabers, ye're right, the spalpeens might be afther
pocketin' the spoons.</p>

<p>Music.</p>

<p><i>(Enter SYBIL and NELL from behind tent. SYBIL, almost romping
on, brings NELL forward. SHE holds her by both hands and swings her
round L.C. SYBIL's hat hangs on her arm by ribbons.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. Come along, Nellie, come along, you mustn't sit moping
all day. <i>(Puts HER hat on NELL.)</i></p>

<p>NELL. But I don't feel well, there's something in the air.</p>

<p>Enter the CAPT. L.2.E. Seeing SYBIL and NELL, drops down
L.C.</p>

<p>SYBIL. Of course there is&mdash;there is the blessed sunshine.
So come along and take a sun-bath. <i>(Moving over&mdash;about to
exit L. 2 E. THEY shrink back C. at sight of CAPTAIN.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Re-enter BEN from tent. HE is about to light His pipe, and
to stroll over to L. in backgronnd.)</i>

jour!</p>

</p>

<p>CAPT. So ho! <i>(The audience. CAPTAIN and BEN only catch one
glimpse of the CHILD, for SYBIL and NELL rush over to R. and drive
W ALLAROO and CHILD off instantly.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(With a brutal sneer C.)</i> So that's the child? Our
child, eh?</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Up L. Starting as if stabbed with a knife. Aside.)</i>
His child- HIS???</p>

<p>CAPT. Um&mdash;an interesting souvenir of an agreeable
acquaintance! <i>(Laughing insolently.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Aside.)</i> Insolent scoundrel. <i>(Subduing HIS
passion with a violent effort and coming down L.)</i> Your business
here?</p>

<p>CAPT. No business&mdash;only pleasure!</p>

<p>BEN. Pleasure!</p>

<p>CAPT. Yes, the pleasure of renewing my acquaintance with these
charming creatures.</p>

<p>NELL. SYBIL. CAPTAIN. BEN.</p>

<p>BEN. I&mdash;I&mdash;<i>(Aside)</i>&mdash;I suppose you were a
gentleman once?</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(C. Sneeringly.)</i> Well, your fair friend yonder
seemed to think so. If you doubt me, ask her!</p>

<p><i>(SYBIL and NELL. turn away indignantly. THEY go up R., cross
behind, and drop down L.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. Ask her&mdash;<i>(Aside.)</i>&mdash;Shall I kill
him&mdash;now&mdash;here before her eyes. <i>(Stifling HIS
rage.)</i> 'Tis useless to appeal to your manhood, I presume?</p>

<p>CAPT. You do presume. You always do. For the
rest&mdash;<i>(Approaching BEN insolently.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. <i>(C.)</i> For the rest. <i>(Quietly. Face to face, eye to
eye.)</i> Insult these ladies by act or deed, by word or look, and
I'll kill you with as little compunction as I would kill a mad dog.
You understand?</p>

<p>CAPT. Perfectly. <i>(crosses to tent with Suppressed
bitterness.)</i></p>

<p>Doubtless we shall understand each other even better by and by.
<i>(Exit behind tent R.)</i></p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(L C. to BEN.)</i> How can I ever thank you?</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(R. Coldly.)</i> You owe me no thanks, madam. <i>(Exit

you, but he shall know all&mdash;now&mdash;this very instant.

<p>SYBIL. <i>(R.C.)</i> Stay&mdash;I forbid you to speak.</p>

<p>NELL. But&mdash;</p>

<p>SYBIL. Silence&mdash;not a word&mdash;not a look.</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(Within, singing.)</i></p>

<p>" I'll sell you for crown, my boy / And that won't be too dear /
For it's my delight on a shiny night /</p>

<p>In the season Of the year."</p>

<p>SYBIL. Hark! the Yorkshireman! Compose yourself.</p>

<p><i>(THEY go up C. SYBIL resumes her work&mdash;NELL stands
embarrassed.)</i>
</p>

<p>Re-enter DICK from the tent R. laughing.</p>

<p>DICK. Body o' me, but them wastrels are stuffin' themselves till
they are welly fit to bust. <i>(HE crosses to L.C.)</i> They're
putting it away as if they hadn't had a meal for a month. <i>(Not
seeing the ladies, about to light his pipe. Turns round towards C.
Sees NELL. Immediately puts pipe away.)</i> Good day again,
Duchess. <i>(Embarrassed.)</i> Fine day, Miss Nellie.</p>

<p>NELL. Very.</p>

<p>DICK. What dost think I saw this morning out yonder?</p>

<p>NELL. Really, I don't know.</p>

<p>DICK. Why, just a clump o' Yorkshire blue forget-me-nots.</p>

<p>NELL. Indeed!</p>

<p>DICK. Happen thou'dst might like to see 'em, I'se gotten hafe an
hour to spare, and&mdash;Wilt come for a bit of a walk?</p>

<p>NELL. I&mdash;I&mdash;<i>(Hesitating.)</i></p>

<p>NELL. <i>(C. remonstrating.)</i> But-</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Pleasantly.)</i> Go, I say.</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(C.)</i> I am ready, Mr Garth.</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(L.C.)</i> Nay, call me Dick.</p>

<p>NELL. But I have known you so short a time.</p>

<p>DICK. Short&mdash;why, it's six long months. No, I mean six
short 'uns&mdash;but long or short, it seems as if I'd known thee
all my life. So do say Dick, please.</p>

<p>NELL. Well, then, Dick.</p>

<p>DICK. That's reet, lass. Jolly&mdash;raal jolly. Just lean on my
arm. Thear ye are&mdash;<i>(Exeunt L. 2 E.)</i></p>

<p>Music.</p>

<p>SYBIL. God has taken compassion on her. In the love of yonder
honest soul she will forget the bitter past. 'Tis I alone who am
miserable. Yes, for he&mdash;he still distrusts&mdash;doubts. Ah,
were his love like mine&mdash;sooner than&mdash;doubt he would die.
<i>(Exit R. 2 E.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Momentary pause.)</i> Music.</p>

<p>A distant "coo-ee " is heard without.</p>

<p>Re-enter WALL. runs on R.C.E., springs on rock and responds.</p>

<p>WALL. Coo-ee!</p>

<p>Re-enter MYLES from tent and looks off L.C.E. ALL the MINERS

Three cheers, boys, for the Warden.</p>

<p>WARD. Well, Ben, how are you?</p>

<p>BEN. Fit as a fiddle and glad to welcome you to "The Golden
Hole."</p>

<p>WARD. Thanks, old man, thanks. We got your letter telling us of
the last grand find and here we are. <i>(Mopping his head.)</i> By
Jove, but it is blazing hot in these diggin's.</p>

<p>Enter KATH. bearing tray with whisky bottle, glasses, and soda

<p>KATH. Would your honour be afther takin' a taste o' the
crayture? <i>(Hands HIM a glass.)</i></p>

<p>WARD. Thanks, Katty. You are a good Samaritan
<i>(Drinks.)</i></p>

<p>GLEN. 'Tis the nectar of the gods.</p>

<p>MYLES. Yes. Raal John Jameson&mdash;as good as ever left
Oireland.</p>

<p>WARD. Ben, Myles, a word with you. <i>(They confer apart
L.C.)</i></p>

<p>GLEN. <i>(Half aside.)</i> By my honor, Katty, you're more
blooming and buxom than ever.</p>

<p>KATH. Ah! be off wid your cunnin' cum-cuddle-me blarney!</p>

<p>GLEN. Cuddle you is it? Faith. I'd like nothing better if I'd a
chance.</p>

<p>KATH. Be aisy wid your nonsense, Glendargle. Sure, if Myles
heerd you, it's afther killin' the pair of us he'd be. <i>(Exit
into tent.)</i></p>

<p>WARD. <i>(C.)</i> Well now, boys, to business. There are two
entries in our books for this claim. And I am here to investigate
the matter myself. Who discovered the ground?</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(L.)</i> Sure 'twas myself and nobody else, your
honour.</p>

<p>JERRY. GLEN.</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(R.H.)</i> But we pegged out first! <i>(Astonishment on
part of everybody.)</i></p>

<p>WARD. <i>(C.)</i> Which of you am I to believe?</p>

<p>BILL. <i>(R.C.)</i> Why, the Cap'n of course, he's a genelman,
he is.</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(R.C.)</i> Does he look as if he'd kid yer? Not
exactly, he couldn't do it if he wor to try.</p>

<p>WARD. But Ben and Myles are in possession.</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(L.C.)</i> Ay, be jabers, and that's nine points of
the law.</p>

<p>BEN. Besides, we have already extracted some five and twenty
thousand pounds' worth of ore. The bulk of it you have already seen
in the bank at Coolgardie. Show them our latest find, Myles.
<i>(WARDEN gets up C.)</i></p>

<p><i>(MYLES rapidly opens boxes, showing the specimens of golden
ore.)</i>
</p>

<p>WARD. <i>(Astonished.)</i> By the living Jingo, this is the
wonder of the world. I've been twenty years at the gold fields, and
dam me if. I ever saw anything like it. You value this and the
Stuff at the bank at five-and-twenty thousand pounds, you say?</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(up C.)</i> Yes, but as we want ready money, if we can
do a deal, we'll sell at £20,000.</p>

<p>GLEN. <i>(L.)</i> I'll give it&mdash;and look here! I've brought
a deposit of £1000 to bind the bargain. Here it is. <i>(Great
astonishment.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Taking note frorn pocket-book, and handing it to BEN.)</i>
</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Aside.)</i> £1000!</p>

<p>JERRY. Oh, bile me tender!</p>

<p>WARD. The stuff is yours, my lord, and you can exchange the
papers at my office as soon as you get back. <i>(Going up L.C. as
if about to exit.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. Mr Warden! I protest against this illegal sale; and as for
the mine, I claim it for myself and partners.</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(L.C.)</i> The divil ye do!</p>

<p>BEN. I should like to know how you're going to do that?</p>

<p>WARD. Where's your evidence?</p>

<p>CAPT. Evidence. Ha, ha! <i>(Laughing defensively.)</i> Only give
me reasonable time and I'll bring twenty witnesses to their
one.</p>

<p>WARD. Very well, then, produce them, and I'll give a final
decision a week hence in my Court at Coolgardie.</p>

<p><i>(About to exit L.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(C.)</i> I thought your Court was burned down a month
ago?</p>

<p>WARD. Yes, but wherever I am my Court is, and I hold it now at
the Circus.</p>

<p><i>(Exeunt WARDEN and GLEN. L. 2 E.&mdash;MINERS R. and L.)</i>

<p>WALL. And so will Wallaroo! <i>(Exit R. 2 E.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. <i>(Appearing at door of tent.)</i> Now, boys, tay is
ready.</p>

<p>MYLES. And we're ready for tay, darlin'. Ben, owld man, hurry
up, look alive and help us to make a good end of a hard day's work.
<i>(Exit into tent.)</i></p>

<p>pp. Music begins.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Solus.)</i> A good end, eh? There is but one end for
me, and the sooner it comes the better. What is
liferiches&mdash;the world itself, and all that's in it, without
her? God help me, my life is over. <i>(Falls into a passion of
tears.)</i></p>

<p>The CAPT. stealthily re-enters R.C.E. and hides behind rushes,
overhearing subsequent speech.</p>

<p>BEN. What, tears&mdash;tears? Oh, shame&mdash;shame! While I
play the woman&mdash;he&mdash;this reptile&mdash;looks on and

<p>OMNES. Ay, Ay.</p>

<p>CAPT. Now, then!</p>

smashing of crockery, etc. etc., JERRY remains R.C. shouting
directions and encouragement to the unseen COMBATANTS.)</i>

<p>BILL. Now, Missis, bring us your best whisky, dy'hear?</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(Sullenly.)</i> Yes, I hear!</p>

<p>BILL. Then look alive about it.</p>

<p>KATH. We don't serve thieves and jail birds.</p>

<p>MYLES. More power to yez, jewel.</p>

<p>BILL. D'ye see this. <i>(Presenting revolver at KATH.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. And do you feel that. <i>(Gives him a clout on the
cheek.)</i> Do you think to frighten me wid your dirty shootin'
iron? That for it. <i>(Snapping her fingers.)</i> And that for you!
you miserable crayture! That! <i>(Exit into tent.)</i></p>

<p>BILL, Well, she's a warm 'un, she is; but I like 'em with a
little ginger.</p>

</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Overwhelmed.)</i> Lost! lost!</p>

<p>WALL. Not so, Missy Duchy.</p>

<p>WALL. See dis! <i>(Taking leathem bottle off his neck.)</i></p>

<p>SYBIL. Ah! The Flower of Sleep! Give it to me, boy give it!

<p>CAPT. <i>(Having found pocket-book on BEN&mdash;exultant.)</i>
At last&mdash;at last!</p>

<p>JERRY. Let's have a smell&mdash;never saw sich a thing in my
life afore- only think&mdash;a thousand quid! But I say, my noble
commander, who's a-going to take care o' the swag?</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(R.)</i> Why, I am, to be sure. Who else do you think?
<i>(Sits down on barrel R.1 E. and makes a cigarette.)</i></p>

<p>OMNES. Of course&mdash;of course.</p>

<p>BILL. <i>(C.)</i> The Capting's all square!</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(L.C.)</i> M'yaas&mdash;square all raand!

whisky and water&mdash;one of them a large one.</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(Sullenly.)</i> Here's the whisky!</p>

<p>OMNES. Hooray!</p>

<p><i>(KATH. crosses over to JERRY and 1st RUFFIAN L., serves
them.)</i>
</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(indignantly. Aside.)</i> Whisky for them villyans?
Whist, Katty!</p>

<p>KATH. Ah, be aisy. Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut!
<i>(Aside.)</i></p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(Aside.)</i> Mum's the word! I'm dumb as an
oyster.</p>

<p><i>(KATH. returning C. serves CAPT. R.; serves 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
RUFFIANs, and finally serves BILL.)</i>
</p>

<p>BILL. <i>(C. Taking whisky.)</i> So you've changed your mind,
Missis Brimstone?</p>

<p>KATH. Yes. <i>(Mimicking HIM)</i> I've changed my mind, Misther
Blackguard! And as you're the biggest bla'guard, here's the biggest
dose for you. <i>(Giving Him large pannikin.)</i> You bad son of an
ugly father!</p>

<p>BILL. Oh, cum I say&mdash;my father was a handsome chap! It's
easy seein' that, cos I take arter him!</p>

<p>KATH. Then he must have been a beauty!</p>

<p>MYLES. She had you there, Misther Bendigo Bully!</p>

<p>BILL. You shut up, Misther Paddy from Cork.</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(At door of tent.)</i> Well, now you've got my last
drop. It's afther doin' you good I hope it'll be, you set of
drunken swine! <i>(Exit into tent.)</i></p>

<p>BILL. It's only her pleasant little way! But she likes me, or
she wouldn't have brought me this dolloping lot!</p>

<p><i>(All the RUFFIANs come well forward, drinking and lighting
their pipes.)</i>
</p>

<p>Re-enter SYBIL R. 2 E. Unseen by the RUFFIANS, SHE glides
rapidly behind them to back of the R.C.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Aside.)</i> Jack, try to keep up!</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(Aside.)</i> I can't, old man. They've done for me this
time.</p>

<p>BEN. God forbid! Keep a good heart, old chap! <i>(Aside.)</i> Is
there no hope&mdash;no escape?</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(HER face appearing above them in opening of the tree.
Aside.)</i> Yes&mdash;both! Hist! a moment&mdash;one little moment.
I will unloose your bonds and set you free!</p>

<p>BEN. MYLES. JACK <i>(Together.)</i> Free!</p>

<p>SYBIL. And list! yonder ruffians are drugged!</p>

<p>JACK. BEN. MYLES. Drugged!</p>

<p>SYBIL. Hush! Look! look!</p>

<p><i>(The narcotic now speedily begins to take effect in a more or
less grotesque manner.)</i>
</p>

<p>BILL. <i>(Eagerly drinking.)</i> Never tasted such stuff in my
life! It's rumbo! Hie! Why, Jerry, blowed if I ain't</p>

<p>tight already!</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(L.C.)</i> You are&mdash;you are! Tight as a drum!</p>

<p>BILL. And only one glass done it!</p>

<p>JERRY. A pailful, you mean! Why, it's as big as a bucket!</p>

<p>BILL. So it is&mdash;I&mdash;hic! <i>(Yawns&mdash;OTHERS follow
suit)</i></p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(To 1st RUFFIAN who has bolted his whisky.)</i>
Stunning! <i>(HE sips his whisky.)</i> Goes down like a torchlight
procession.</p>

<p><i>(1st RUFFIAN, who is seated L. starts up, puts his hand on
his stomach.)</i>
</p>

<p>JERRY. Here, I say, Toby&mdash;what's up? <i>(1st RUFFIAN falls
with a crash.)</i> He's daawn&mdash;that's what's up! Why, Capting.
<i>(crosses to R.)</i> They're all mops and brooms. <i>(CAPT.
Laughs heartily.)</i> It is funny, ain't it? <i>(To 2nd
RUFFIAN.)</i> Tommy, did you see Toby? <i>(2nd RUFFIAN falls.)</i>
Naaw he's gawn. Well, this is a rum rig!</p>

<p><i>(The 3rd and 4th RUFFIANs, who occupy the C. of background,
start up as if they had been shot, then, being about to collapse,
slew round planting themselves back to back, supporting each
other.)</i>
</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(crosses over to them.)</i> Here, I say, Hezekiah!
What's wrong with your applecart?</p>

<p><i>(2nd and 3rd RUFFIANS slew round so that THEY meet chest to
chest, their heads resting upon each other's shoulders, their
features fixed, rigid, and immovable, with an expression of idiotic
drunken gravity. Being unable to raise their arms, they only
maintain their perpendicular position by leaning against each
other. THEY swerve slightly and fall with a crash longways, but in
opposite directions, across the stage C. Each MAN lies with his
head level with the other's heels.)</i>
</p>

<p>JERRY. Naaw they're daawn! It's all along o' the whisky! It was
bloomin' strong, and no mistake! <i>(Stretches arms and sways to
and fro.)</i></p>

<p>BILL. <i>(Vainly trying to keep the drop on PRISONERS.)</i>
Dooty is dooty. Mind, Mr Paddy from Cork, I've got&mdash;hic the
drop on you! <i>(Fires pistol in the air and falls.)</i></p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(With a yell of terror, placing his hands behind
HIM.)</i> He's blown my brains out!</p>

<p><i>(Falls beside BILL, their heads pillowed on 3rd and 4th
RUFFIANS&mdash;feet to the AUDIENCE.)</i>
</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Laughing heartily.)</i> Evidently a little whisky goes
a long way with these louts! <i>(Aside.)</i> Happy thought! While
they are sleeping off their booze I'll mizzle with the thousand
quid: But before I go I'll settle accounts here! <i>(R. Aloud to
BEN, MYLEs, and JACK.)</i> So&mdash;l've got you! I've half a mind
to make a good riddance of the lot of you! Anyhow, I'll make sure
of you, Mr Lionel Leigh! You, who half an hour ago talked of
killing me like a dog&mdash;but&mdash;<i>(drawing His
knife)</i>&mdash;it's my turn now! <i>(Advancing upon BEN to kill
HIM.)</i></p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Springs forward C. interrupting him.)</i> Stand back,
I say, stand back!</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Recoiling R.C.)</i> Ha! I'm glad you are here, for
you're just in time to see me kill your man!</p>

<p><i>(Simultaneously)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(WALLAROO re-enters R.C.E. on back platform. Observing the
state of affairs HE beckons on NELLY, who, alarmed at SYBIL's
peril, frantically waves her handkerchief beckoning DICK on from L.

<p>NELL <i>(points to SYBIL)</i></p>

<p>DICK. Plucks forth his knife and is about to rush to her rescue,
when he sees the narcotic has taken hold of CAPAIN. Assured that
SHE is safe, HE quickly and noiselessly <i>(not to interfere with

cuts the ropes which bind the prisoners. Simultaneously WALLAROO
stealthily creeps down R.H. descent. He advances R.C. BEN MYLES

<p>SYBIL. Kill me first.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN. No, no&mdash;him! Out of the way.</p>

<p>SYBL. <i>(Screaming.)</i> Help, help! Dick! Dick!</p>

<p>CAPTAIN. Psha! Out of the way I tell you. <i>(He swings SYBIL
round to R.corner, then as HE advances, knife in hand, to despatch
BEN)</i> As for you, I'll rip, I will, by&mdash;<i>(Knife lifted to
strike the blow when the narcotic takes hold of him, he starts back
to R.C.)</i> Ha, what's this? My arm is palsied, my head turns
around, what can it mean?</p>

<p>SYBIL <i>(Who has got behind him to C.)</i> It means you are
powerless to do your wicked will, for the flower of sleep has done
it;s work.</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(L.C.)</i> Well, that Wally is a cure.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. <i>(R.C.)</i> Ya! he ish dot! Hein! Mister Sailor, I
bring you a tobacco box wid a leedle bit of real cavendish.</p>

<p>JACK. That is real good of you, Mynherr.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. And I have anozer for your brother, the Herr Ben, but
I have oder business wid him. My syndicate in Berlin authorise me
to buy ze Golden Hole.</p>

<p>JACK. You're too late. Glendargle has the call.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. Donnerwetter! Dot it ish to be a lord!</p>

<p>JACK. No, that it is to be a man&mdash;and that's just what
Glendargle is. Then blood is thicker than water, and, you know,
although an Irishman, he comes from England.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. Bah! England cannot stand against Shermany.</p>

<p>JACK <i>(R C.)</i> Rot, sir, rot! England can stand against the
world! She leads the commerce of the universe, and will do so as
long as her flag floats over the sea.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. <i>(R.C.)</i> Bosh! bosh! with big, big B! The
conquering Sherman rules everywhere. Ve outvits you ve undersell
you&mdash;and I am here to do it now. <i>(Chuckles.)</i> Remember,
mein lieben friend, I vas made in Shermany ha, ha!</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(L.C.)</i> Ah, we are used to things made there, and
don't think much of them, or of Shermany either.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. You vill vhen ve vipes you out! Wait, mein young
sailor, till you see our fleet.</p>

<p>JACK. I will, and when we do see it we will wipe that out.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. You vill need a mighty big dish clout for dat job.</p>

<p>JACK. It is ready now, and has been ready ever since we swept
the Spaniard out of the sea in the days of Queen Bess! W e call it
" The Union Jack," and so long as that flies at the fore of a
British ship, manned by British tars, so long will Britannia rule
the waves, and hold her own not only against your precious Germany,
but against the world. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Mr
"Coots Made In Shermany! " <i>(Exit L. 2 E.)</i></p>

<p>VON SWOP. Dose English sailors are right down coot fellows, but
dey are so conceited. We never can teach dem " Dot dem dot fights
and runs away / Will live to fight anoder dey." No, de fools prefer
to stay and be killed. Ah! we knows a dam sight better dan dot in
Shermany! <i>(Exit into Court R.)</i></p>

<p>Music.</p>

<p>Enter SYBIL from the hotel, followed by NELL. SYBIL is knitting.
She sits C.</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(R.C. in hysterical excitement)</i>. Oh! Sybilla,
Sybilla, he's going home.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(C.)</i> He! Whom?</p>

<p>NELL. Why, Dick!</p>

<p>SYBIL. Dick!</p>

<p>NELL. My Dick!</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Archly)</i>. Oh! your Dick. <i>(Sits C.)</i></p>

<p>NELL. Yes! He told me so a moment ago. Told me, too, that he
wished to speak to me&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>SYBIL. Well, there is nothing so terrible in that. <i>(Her sang
froid contrasts strongly with NELL.'s hysteria.)</i></p>

<p>NELL. But it is terrible. Very terrible. For he must know
all.</p>

<p>SYBIL. He must.</p>

<p>NELL. When he does know it. <i>(Going down R., returning C.)</i>
When he does&mdash;</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Archly.)</i> He will know something else.</p>

<p>NELL. And that is&mdash;?</p>

<p>SYBIL. He will know that the woman he loves trusts him with all
her heart, with all her soul.</p>

<p>NELL. Yes! yes!</p>

<p>SYBIL. And if he loves her, he will trust her.</p>

<p>NELL. Yes! yes!</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Grately.)</i> But if he does not?</p>

<p>NELL. Don't, Sybil! don't, I can't bear it. Death were better
than that. <i>(crosses to L. and back up C.)</i></p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Pausing in her work, with great sympathy.)</i> Poor
child, Do you then love this rough diamond of yours so much?</p>

<p>NELL. Much; More than life itself. <i>(L.C.)</i></p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Half reproachfully.)</i> Yet it seems but yesterday
since&mdash;since&mdash;</p>

<p>NELL. Since I was foolish&mdash;mad. True, true, but that was
not love. 'Twas but the infatuation of a froward, thoughtless girl,
who took a piece of pinchbeck for sterling gold. Love! I knew not
then the meaning of the word.</p>

<p>SYBIL. You know it now <i>(smiling)</i> though.</p>

<p>NELL. Ah! yes. Those six months out in the bush yonder revealed
to me a heaven on earth of which I had never dreamt before, even in
my wildest dreams.</p>

<p>SYBIL. And so this Yorkshire paladin has led you to the gates of
Paradise. <i>(Still smiling.)</i></p>

<p>NELL. <i>(Dropping upon her knees beside SYBIL.)</i> You don't
know him. Though rugged as his native North, he is as modest as he
is manly&mdash;as tender as he is true.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Decidedly)</i> The more reason, then, that you should
trust him.</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(Starting up.)</i> I dare not! I dare not! were he to
despise me&mdash;</p>

<p>SYBIL. He will not despise you.</p>

<p>NELL. He might. He might! And then Where could I look for
hope&mdash;for consolation?</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Dropping her knitting and rising with ardour.)</i>
Here, in these arms, here in this heart. <i>(Embrace.)</i></p>

<p>NELL. You teach me my duty, dear, and with God's help I'll do
it.</p>

<p>SYBIL. That's right, dear! <i>(Goes rapidly up to door.)</i></p>

<p>NELL. <i>(Following SYBIL.)</i> Yes, my Dick shall know the
truth, even if the telling it breaks my heart.</p>

<p>SYBIL. That's my own darling! Come, dear, come. <i>(Exeunt into
hotel)</i></p>

<p>Music-Lively.</p>

<p><i>(A shout from within, " Hurray! " Enter tumultuously a CROWD

<p>MYLES. <i>(C.)</i> Owld Ireland and Victory for ever.</p>

<p>OMNES. Hurray!</p>

<p>GLEN. <i>(R.C.)</i> You've won the battle, Myles.</p>

<p>MYLES. Battle? Sure it was not a battle but a rout&mdash;a
regular slaughter of the enemy. Begorra, we drove 'em out of the
field wid a rush, because they daren't show their faces in it.
<i>(Goes L.C.)</i></p>

<p>Enter VON SWOP from Court House R.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. Donner and blitzen, but dot ish so, Mynherr Myles.</p>

<p><i>(Enter BEN from Court.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. The opposition didn't appear, so judgment has gone by
default, and the mine is ours, boys.</p>

<p>OMINES. Hurray!</p>

<p><i>(Exennt MINERS R. and L.)</i>
</p>

<p>GLEN. Aye, Ben, and you've got the Golden Hole besides.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. <i>(L.)</i> Ya, and all de golden stuff in it.</p>

<p>GLEN. Let's crack a bottle on it for the honour of Old
Ireland.</p>

<p>MYLES. A bottle? A dozen bottles! <i>(All go up
towards&mdash;door of hotel.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. Hold hard, Miles! Business first, pleasure next. You are
still of the same mind, Glendargle?</p>

<p>GLEN. Of course, I am.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. But, Herr Ben, I am prepared to make a bid.</p>

<p>BEN. Too late, Mynherr.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. But see here, I'll give five thousand more.</p>

<p>BEN. Not if you were to give fifty thousand. I've given my word
to Glendargle, and he has the call.</p>

<p><i>(Exit BEN. into hotel.)</i>
</p>

<p>VON SWOP. Potz Tansand!</p>

<p>GLEN. Come and have a drink, Von Swop.</p>

<p><i>(Exit GLEN. into hotel.)</i>
</p>

<p>VON SWOP. Donnerwetter! Donner and blitzen!</p>

<p>MYLES. An' don't stand swearin' there, but go in like a.dacent
owld man, and wish the boys luck.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. Potz Tans and. Ei vos?</p>

<p>MYLES. Of coorse ye wur. Away ye go, now.</p>

<p><i>(Pushes VON SWOP into hotel.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(KATH. appearing at window, cleaning glasses, etc.)</i>
</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(Looking admiringly at MYLES.)</i> So you've won the
day, Myles? Ye were always proud of your country. Now your country
will be proud of you. I could jump out of my skin wid joy.</p>

<p>MYLES. Do, darlin', do&mdash;jump into my arms, and taste peace
and plenty. Oh, it's the proud boy I am this day.
<i>(Triumphantly.)</i> Be jabers, I'll not spake a sober word for a
month, unless I am drunk.</p>

<p>KATH. Then divil a drink ye'll get from me this blessed night
out. <i>(Disappears.)</i></p>

<p>MYLES. Oh, listen to that! The barbarous crayture, to deprive a
poor boy of his mother's milk. I that was waned on it. <i>(Exit
into hotel.)</i></p>

<p>Music.</p>

<p><i>(Enter CAPT. and JERRY, They are footsore and weary.)</i>
</p>

<p>CAPT. Too late for the Court.</p>

<p>JERRY. Then we're a day arter the fair. <i>(Goes to
window)</i></p>

<p>Enter WALL. L.C.E.</p>

<p>WALL. <i>(Aside.)</i> But Wallaroo am just in time. <i>(From
this moment WALL. tracks the CAPT. like a bloodhound, shadowing his
every movement.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Looking into hotel.)</i> That Yorkshire lout and
Nellie are coming out. What are they up to?</p>

<p>JERRY. Canoodling.</p>

<p>CAPT. Shut up!</p>

<p>JERRY. Shut up it is. <i>(WALL. disappears.)</i></p>

<p><i>(CAPT. claps hand on JERRY's mouth, and drags him behind tree
L.C.E.)</i>
</p>

<p>Music.</p>

<p><i>(Enter NELL. from hotel, followed by DICK.)</i>
</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(R.C.)</i> Nellie! May I call thee, Nellie? I wuz just
thinkin'&mdash;</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(L.C.)</i> Of what?</p>

<p>DICK. Well, tha' see'st ah've got five thaasand a'ready. T'
Golden Hole's likely to be sold for thaasands more, and as ah'm
abaght stinkin' o' brass ah've made up my mind to get back to
Yorkshire.</p>

<p>NELL. It's a lovely place, is it not?</p>

<p>Music-" North Countree."</p>

<p>DICK. It's just abaght t' bonniest on t' face o' t' earth. Hey!
tha' should'st see aar green valleys, aar becks and brigs, and aar
grand owd minster in aar grand owd city. There's nowt like it i' a'
t' world.</p>

<p>NELL. Really?</p>

<p>DICK. Aye, for soor. Then thear's Rosedale, t' prettiest village
i' t' sweetest valley i' all t' county. There's a sweate little
cottage a' over Virginny creepers, honeysuckles, woodbine, and
sweet-smellin' clematis, an' a wee bit rose garden wi' a wee bit
stream at bottom that runs daawn till it reaches aar river that
raaces away into t' grand owd Humber, reet down to the sea. And eh,
lass, bonnier nor all, there's a grand owd woman wi' white hair and
big blue eyes just like thine, who sits at her spinnin' wheel from
mornin' till neet, countin' t' hours till her great lout of a
lad&mdash;her only one&mdash;comes whoam. Ah'm t' lad; and ah'm
goin' whoam; an' if thou'lt on'y goa wi' me, lass, ah think ah sud
be t' 'appiest chap i' t' wide world. Thear; it's aht na, lass!
<i>(Rises, dropping down R.)</i></p>

<p>pp. Music ends.</p>

<p><i>(NELL. sits trembling, turns away silently, weeping.)</i>
</p>

<p>DICK. Greetin? Why ma pretty! What have ah said or dun to mek
thee greet?</p>

<p>NELL. Nothing, I am only cryin' because&mdash;</p>

<p>DICK. Well&mdash;because?</p>

<p>NELL. Because I am not worthy of you.</p>

<p>DICK. Naa; ah'll none believe that.</p>

<p>NELL. 'Tis truth&mdash;gospel truth. <i>(Pause.)</i> Turn away
your face. Don't look at me, or I shall die of shame. Don't look at
me, I say.</p>

<p>DICK. Ah'm not lookin', lass!</p>

<p>pp. Music-Nellie's.</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(In a low, trembling tone.)</i> While yet almost a
child&mdash;an innocent, ignorant child&mdash;I fell a victim to
the arts of a villain. Deceived, betrayed, I&mdash;who have never
been a wife&mdash;became a mother.</p>

<p>DICK. A muther?</p>

<p>NELL. Yes, the mother of yonder child! <i>(Falls upon her knees.
He starts.)</i> To spare me exposure and disgrace, my sister, my
noble- hearted sister, took upon herself the burden of my shame.
But she is innocent, innocent as the hapless child of whom I am the
unfortunate but guiltless mother. Yes, guiltless, for as God is my
judge, I erred in ignorance but not in guilt. But there, there!
protestations are idle&mdash;words, mere wasted breath; and tears
<i>(even were I to shed an ocean!)</i> can never blot out the past,
which flows 'twixt you and me, like a lake of fire in which all my
hopes lie consumed by unavailing regrets for that which might have
been once, but never can be now&mdash;no never&mdash;never!</p>

<p><i>(Falls into a great passion of grief, sobbing as if her heart
were fit to break. HE remains perturbed but silent.)</i>
<i>(Dashing aside her tears in desperation and springing to her
feet, speaks quickly and decidedly.)</i> I knew it must come to
this sooner or later, but I hoped it wouldn't come quite so soon.
Your kindness, however, wrings the truth from me. <i>(crosses in
front of DICK to R., then up the stage.)</i></p>

<p>And, now that all is over between us, forget&mdash;forgive.
<i>(Turning away.)</i></p>

<p>DICK. Ah've nowt to forgive, lass.</p>

<p>NELL. But you have something to forget&mdash;yes&mdash;forget
that we have ever met&mdash;and now&mdash;good-bye! <i>(Moves
towards door of hotel.)</i></p>

<p>DICK. Naa, naa. Doan't leave me, Nellie.</p>

<p>NELL. I must&mdash;I must. Your honest name shall never be
sullied by my shame.</p>

<p>DICK. Nay, lass, there's no shame where there's no sin. Only
gi'e me t' rate to protect thee, and ah'd like to see t' man or t'
woman who'd look askance at Dick Garth's wife. Cum, lass, cum, and
my muther s'al be thy muther&mdash;thy child, my child.</p>

<p>NELL. God bless you, Dick. <i>(THEY embrace.)</i></p>

<p>DicK. He has blessed me already in thee&mdash;in thee, my hope,
my pride. <i>(Leads HER tenderly up R.)</i> Doan't greet, lass,
doan't greet.</p>

<p>NELL. They are tears of joy.</p>

<p>DICK. Let me kiss 'em away, my own bonnie dearie. Cum, lass,
cum. [DICK and NELL. exeunt R.C.E.</p>

<p>pp. Music now ends.</p>

<p><i>(CAPT. comes forward with a cynical grin on HIS face,
followed by the LARR. and WALLAROO from L.C.E,)</i>
</p>

<p>CAPT. Quite idyllic, isn't it? Ha, ha, ha! <i>(Laughs
sardonically.)</i></p>

<p>JERRY. Idyllic&mdash;hydraulic, you mean; too hydraulic for me.
<i>(Boohooing.)</i> I'm too tender 'arted.</p>

<p>CAPT. You are too tender to live. <i>(Laughs.)</i></p>

<p>JERRY. Well, you swells are rum uns; I shouldn't chuckle that
way if I saw another bloke a-huggin my Sal!.</p>

<p>CAPT. Shouldn't you?</p>

<p>JERRY. No, I shouldn't. Remember what Handel says in his him
mortal hanthem&mdash;" Never hintroduce your donah to a pal." But,
there&mdash;there&mdash;they all do it, in fact, I done it
myself.</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Seeing BEN and GLEN. returning.)</i> Oh, shut up!</p>

<p>JERRY. Shut up it is! <i>(THEY retire and hide L.C.E., preceded
by WALL.)</i></p>

<p>Re-enter BEN and GLEN. from inn, very qnick.</p>

<p>BEN. You understand the price?</p>

<p>GLEN. Perfectly! £150,000 cash and shares, and £50,000 working
capital.</p>

<p>BEN. And a deposit of £2000 for six: months' option.</p>

<p>GLEN. Right you are. I'm off to the bank to get the needful.
Back in five minutes. [Exit L,C.E,</p>

<p><i>(BEN makes note in pocket-book.)</i>

<p>JERRY. If we only could! <i>(Exit L.C.E.)</i></p>

<p>WALL. Wallaroo nobble oo bofe, dam tiefs! <i>(Exit
L.C.E.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Re-enter JACK L. 2 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(L.)</i> Ben.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(C.)</i> Hello! there your are.</p>

<p>JACK. Yes, here I am. What's left of me. <i>(Sits down L.C.
fanning himself.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. That won't be much if you take to loafing about in this
way.</p>

<p>JACK. It's the first walk I've had since we left" The Golden
Hole." The fact is " She " won't let me stir out.</p>

<p>BEN. She? Whom?</p>

<p>JACK. "She" who must be obeyed&mdash;the Duchess.</p>

<p>BEN. Ah'm! The Duchess! <i>(Impatiently.)</i></p>

<p>JACK. She will have her own way. It's "Mr Sailor this and Mr
Sailor that! Time to get up, time to go to roost, time for soup and
slops, time for tea and toast; above all, time for physic! " Oh,
that beastly physic, I can taste it now; o&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;h!
But, bless her dear heart, for all that she's an angel.</p>

<p>BEN. A fallen one, I fear.</p>

<p>JACK. She fallen! Can you look on her face and say so?</p>

<p>BEN. I have seen a face as fair as hers mask the heart of a
devil.</p>

<p>JACK. A devil!</p>

<p>BEN. Yes; the devil who wrecked my life and sent me forth an
outcast and a wanderer&mdash;ruined, disgraced, degraded.</p>

<p>JACK. My poor brother.</p>

<p>BEN. Abandoned both by God and man, on my way to banishment, I
met your friend the Duchess, as you call her. To look upon her was
to love her.</p>

<p>JACK. I can well believe that.</p>

<p>BEN. the voyage out passed like one long happy dream till we
reached Melbourne. Then came the awaking.</p>

<p>JACK. The awaking!</p>

<p>BEN. Yes; for it was then that I realised that I had no right to
cast the shadow of my shame upon the brightness of her life, so I
turned, and without a word or look, fled into the wilderness. For
three years&mdash;three long, dreary years&mdash;! wearied God with
tears and prayers that the time might come when I should be free to
meet her once more. The time came, and when it did, she whom I
adored, stood before me unabashed, with the evidence of her shame
in her arms&mdash;on her breast.</p>

<p>JACK. You mean the child?</p>

<p>BEN. I mean the child.</p>

<p>JACK. Pshaw! She is not married and never has been.
<i>(Rising.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. I know it, for she told me so herself.</p>

<p>JACK. Herself?</p>

<p>BEN. Herself! Worse even than that, barely a week ago, I saw
with these eyes, heard with these ears, that scoundrel Wantley
claim the child for his own.</p>

<p>JACK. Impossible!</p>

<p>BEN. I tell you it's true. These were the words&mdash;" So this
is the child&mdash;our child!"</p>

<p>JACK. Incredible!</p>

<p>BEN. I was about to strike the ruffian to my feet, to trample
his detested features out of all semblance to humanity, when a
sudden revulsion came. The love that had sanctified my life was
stricken dead, and my heart was turned to stone! <i>(Dropping dou;n
R.C.)</i></p>

<p>JACK. <i>(L.C.)</i> Turned to butter you mean. Why, it's</p>

<p>melting at this moment.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Savagely.)</i> Don't jest with me! <i>(Facing
JACK.)</i></p>

<p>JACK. I'm not jesting; I'm soberly, seriously in earnest. Now,
just you tell me one thing. When that blackguard spoke about the
child, was there anyone else present?</p>

<p>BEN. Certainly; little Nell was there.</p>

<p>JACK. I thought so. Now, I'll bet my share of "The</p>

<p>Golden Hole" to an empty 'baccy box, that Nell is the</p>

<p>mother of that child.</p>

<p>BEN. You don't mean-</p>

<p>JACK. I do. While I've been lying on my back these six months
half awake, half asleep, I've seen and heard strange things.</p>

<p>BEN. No!</p>

<p>JACK. Yes! Many a time and oft at nightfall "She"&mdash;that's
the Duchess&mdash;gets me into a corner and begins to
cross&mdash;question me about you, and mighty artful she is about
it. When I tell her what a pickle you were when a boy her bosom
rises and sinks like a lake in a storm, her eyes grow bigger and
bigger, her breath comes and goes in little gasps, her voice
trembles into music, until the stars stand still to listen. Then,
my dear eyes! it's a caution to see her turn pale as death one
minute, and at the next kindle into flame at the very sound of your
voice.</p>

<p>BEN. If this were true!</p>

<p>JACK. It's gospel truth. Why, man alive, with all her beauty and
all her pride, she adores the very ground you walk on!</p>

<p>BEN. Do you think so?</p>

<p>JACK. Think? I know it; I'm sure of it.</p>

<p>BEN. It is; it must be so! God! what a brute beast I've been!
But I'll kneel at her feet and never rise till she forgives me! Oh,
how changed it all is. A moment ago 'twas dark as night, now 'tis
bright, as the living day. A moment ago I doubted the Eternal
Justice, now I know God reigns in heaven, while Love, his
first-born, is lord of all on earth, and the heart which I thought
dead, is beating, bounding</p>

<p>here, till well nigh fit to burst with joy. And I owe it all to
you, Jack&mdash;to you! God bless you, old man, God bless you!

nothing to sit down on.</p>

<p>MYLES. But I do! Sure I saw Yorkshire Dick makin' sheep's eyes
at her a while ago, as big as a duck's egg, and then they strolled
out quite promiscuously and purposely, by accident. Katty, darlin',
it's near pairin' time, and if you'd only be afther makin' up your
mind; and if the Duchess would only follow suit, and give one o'
the boys that's dyin' to make a doormat of himself for her to wipe
her purty feet on, the chance of a look&mdash;in, we might all be
spliced at onst [once].</p>

family away.</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(R.C.)</i> There's many a true word spoken i' jest.
Nellie and ah are goin' to get wed, good people.</p>

<p>OMNES. <i>(Astonished.)</i> No!</p>

<p>NELL. Yes! and I invite you all to the wedding.</p>

<p>GLEN. All right&mdash;we'll be there.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. Ya! All dere, Mees Nellie.</p>

<p>MYLES. Katty, your sow!, come on! Sure the same weddin'
breakfast will do for the whole boilin' of us.</p>

<p><i>(HE puts his arm round her waist. SHE puts the hot teapot on
his hand, and he starts away.)</i>
</p>

<p>KATH. Be off wid yez out o' that.</p>

<p><i>(SYBIL goes rapidly down L.C. to NELL. and DICK.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL <i>(To NELL, aside.)</i> You have told him?</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(Aside.)</i> All.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Tenderly embracing her.)</i> That's my own sister.
<i>(Anxiously, putting NELL. round L.)</i> And you, Mr Garth?</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(Aside.)</i> Ah've told her-" My mother sal be her
mother, and her child my child."</p>

<p>SYBIL. Then her sister shall be your sister, Richard.</p>

<p>DICK. No?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Yes. There's my hand! <i>(Gives her hand to DICK. SHE
then joins their hands. DICK puts NELL. tenderly round to R. so
that HE stands between them.)</i></p>

<p>DICK. Eh, Duchess, wi' such a wife and such a sister ah'm that
proud.</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(Coming down L.C.)</i> Ye are&mdash;ye are&mdash;ye're
as proud as a dog wid two tails.</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(Laughing.)</i> Ah've niver seed one, but if he's a
happier dog this day than ah'm, ah sud like to know where to find
him. <i>(HE places the arms of the Two GIRLS in HIS.)</i></p>

<p>MYLES. Begorra, when I see you standin' there wid beauty on one
arm and ilegance on the other, I'm mortal sure there isn't a boy in
Coolgardie but will say, "How happy could I be with either."</p>

<p>DICK. But thear's where ah've gotten the pull, for ah'm happy
wi' both.</p>

<p>MYLES. Well, if you aren't you ought to be, for by jabers, the
three of yez make a purty fine couple.</p>

<p><i>(They go up to tea-table.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(Re-enter JACK 2 E. L.)</i>
</p>

<p>JACK. I always turn up in time for tea, for your brew is
tip-top, Duchess.</p>

<p>DICK. It is that, Jack.</p>

<p>JACK. And as for your jam, Kitty&mdash;it almost reconciles me
to my physic. Thank you, don't mind if I do! <i>(About to take jam
pot.)</i></p>

<p>MYLES. No you don't&mdash;I'll do it myself.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. Meestress Katty, I have taken ze liberty of bringing
my leetle contribution to ze feast. <i>(Xcrosses behind to table L.
and produces from box a huge sausage.)</i> Dis sausage made in
Shermany!</p>

<p><i>(ALL laugh.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Laughing.)</i> Good gracious! What a big one!</p>

<p>DICK. A regular whopper!</p>

<p>MYLES. Arrah! How many pigs did it take to make that
monsther?</p>

<p>JACK. Hand it over, old man, and I'll sample it. <i>(Snatches it
and runs down to bottom of table, chased by VON SWOP, who tries to
regain it, but is forced into his seat by DICK and GLEN.)</i></p>

<p>JACK. Give us a knife, Nell.</p>

<p>NELL. Here you are. <i>(Giving one.)</i></p>

<p><i>(JACK standing with back to audience, cuts slices from the
sausage. N.B.-This is a trick sausage. Case at top contains the
slices which JACK is supposed to cut.)</i>
</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(Fills his plate with slices and goes to his place at
table.)</i> There you are! You couldn't be better served in a
sausage shop.</p>

<p>KATH. Sausage shop! Misther Jack, I'd have ye to know the " Erin
Go Bragh" is the first hotel in Coolgardie!</p>

<p>JACK. Oh, of course&mdash;of course&mdash;that goes without
saying.</p>

<p>MYLES. And the sausage is going without saying too. I'll trouble
you for another slice, Nellie.</p>

<p>JACK. Well, Myn Herr, if all the goods made in Germany were half
as good as this, I wouldn't mind turning German myself.</p>

<p>MYLES. Begorra! I'm half German already&mdash;it's
delicious.</p>

<p><i>(Chokes. KATH. and JACK pat him on the back.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(ALL laugh.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(When silence is restored BEN. re-enters L.C.E.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. How beautiful she looks! She has smiles for
everybody&mdash;everybody but me! <i>(Drops down L.)</i></p>

<p>NELL. Ah! Mr Ben, I think I must scold you for being so late.
Tea for Mr Ben, Sybil. <i>(SHE runs up and brings tea and bread and
butter down to BEN.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. Thanks. <i>(Takes tea from NELL, who resumes HER
seat.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Aside.)</i> She won't even look at me! But she shall.
I'll know my fate&mdash;now&mdash;this very hour. <i>(Averts his
gaze.)</i></p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Aside, stealing a look at BEN.)</i> Colder and
sterner than ever. I detest him!</p>

<p>MYLES. So it's after goin' horne ye are, Dick?</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(R.)</i> Aye, please God.</p>

<p>SYBIL. Home! Oh! little word that means so much.</p>

<p>BEN. Much? It means everything! It reminds the exile of his
native land with its stately minsters, and its trophied towers; its
peaceful hamlets, and its crowded cities; its flowing rivers; its
fertile valleys, and its smiling plains. It recalls the lost, the
distant, and the dead! Oh, blessed sound that conjures up the dear
loved faces, the sweet familiar voices, and all the thousand happy
memories of old! Nell, sing us the sweet old song you sang the
other night.</p>

<p>NELL. I fear my heart's too full, but if you'll bear with me
I'll try!</p>

<p>Song&mdash;NELL.-" Home, Sweet Home."</p>

<p><i>(ALL remain silent and touched for a moment.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Aside.)</i> Right, right&mdash;"There's no place like
home!"</p>

<p>JACK. And no home like&mdash;Holmleigh, Ben!</p>

<p>GLEN. Except Glendargle, and I wish&mdash;oh, d&mdash;n it all.
<i>(Staring up.)</i> I can't stand this! I'm off.</p>

<p><i>(Exit R. 1 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>DICK. Eh, Nell, lass! Thou'st tekken me back to Rosedale, for
suar.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Taking up teapot.)</i> And me to Lincoln. Dear old
Lincoln! <i>(Exit into inn.)</i></p>

<p>VON SWOP. And me to Shermany. <i>(Crying.)</i> Dear old
Shermany!</p>

<p><i>(Exit R. 1 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>KATH. And me to my dear owld cabin at Ballymena.
<i>(Crying.)</i></p>

<p>MYLES. And me to my beautiful bog at Ballynamuck!</p>

<p>KATH. I can see the meddy and Biddy, my owld cow!</p>

<p>MYLES. And I the pigstye and Barney, my owld pig.</p>

<p>KATH. Ah! but I can smell the clover. <i>(Cryying.)</i></p>

<p>MYLES. And I the pigstye. Begorra, but it's in it I am this
blessed minit! <i>(Howling.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. Arrah, come out o' that wid you and your dirty pigstye,
and be after givin' a hand here.</p>

<p>MYLES. A hand! Sure it's a dozen I'd give you if I had 'em. But
anyhow here's two at your service.</p>

<p><i>(Lights gradually lowered. SYBIL appears at window, NELL,
DICK, and JACK hand things through to HER; MYLES and KATHLEEN
exeunt into hotel carrying tray.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(NELL and DICK and JACK all stand together L.C.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Going off L.C.E. Stops.)</i> Confound it!</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(R.C.)</i> What's up?</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(C.)</i> This precious deposit! <i>(Taking out
pocketbook)</i> It is too late to pay it into the bank.</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(R.)</i> The £2000 you mean?</p>

<p>CAPT. and JERRY <i>(Simultaneously aside.)</i> Ahl</p>

<p>BEN. It's a big sum to carry about, and if it were known</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(L.)</i> You would be in danger?</p>

<p>JACK <i>(R.C.)</i> Better let me come with you.</p>

<p>DICK <i>(L. C.)</i> Nonsense. I'll be up wi' him, and yon
wastrels will think twice afore they tackle Big Ben and Yorkshire
Dick.</p>

<p>BEN. For all that, I wish these notes were under lock and
key.</p>

<p>NELL. Trust them to me. <i>(crosses to C.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. To you?</p>

<p>NELL. Yes, there is a strong iron-bound trunk in my room.</p>

<p>CAPT. Ha! <i>(CAPT. listens at back.)</i></p>

<p>NELL. And here's the key. <i>(Shows BEN key.)</i> I'll lock them
up till morning.</p>

<p>BEN. Capital. Here they are. Take the pocket-book as well, it
will save the trouble of counting them. <i>(Gives
pocketbook.)</i></p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Within, brightly and quickly.)</i> Come, Mr Sailor,
time for Bedfordshire.</p>

<p>JACK. Right you are, doctor. <i>(SYBIL disappears.)</i> <i>(To
BEN)</i> Now's your time. <i>(Aside.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Hesitating.)</i> But I&mdash;</p>

<p>JACK. Don't "but" me&mdash;but go for her. Damme, if you don't,
I'll go for her myself!</p>

<p><i>(Exit JACK and BEN into hotel.)</i>
</p>

<p>DICK. Good neet, ma bonnie dearie. Tell me once more that you
love me, Nellie.</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(Throwing her arm around his neck.)</i> I love you,</p>

<p>DICk, I love you. <i>(SHE runs up to hotel door and kisses her
hand to him.)</i></p>

<p>DICK. <i>(Bursts into a joyouts refrain.)</i> "So early in the
morning / So early in the morning / Before the break of day."</p>

<p><i>(Exit NELL. , Exit DICK L, 1 E)</i>
</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Looking eagerly after BEN.)</i> Curse her&mdash;curse
the whole lot of 'em.</p>

<p>JERRY. That's right; chuck it off your chest!</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Angrily.)</i> Oh! chuck it yourself.</p>

<p>JERRY. Chucked it is.</p>

<p>WALL. <i>(Aside.)</i> Wallaroo chuck oo bofe bymbye.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Within.)</i> Not another word.</p>

<p>CAPT. The Duchess!</p>

<p>JERRY. The devil! <i>(Starts back behind tree.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Re-enter SYBIL from hotel, followed by BEN. SYBIL is angry
and excited, she gets down L.C.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(R.C.)</i> You will not hear me, then?</p>

<p>SYBIL. I've heard too much already! From the very moment of my
arrival you've insulted me!</p>

<p>BEN. Insulted!</p>

<p>SYBIL. For the past six months your every word&mdash;every
look&mdash;has been an outrage. <i>(crosses to R. and up
R.C.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. <i>(L.C.)</i> An outrage!</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(R.C.)</i> I said an outrage&mdash;and now you-</p>

<p>BEN. Now, I come to ask your forgiveness.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Obdurately.)</i> Before I can forgive, I must
forget.</p>

<p>BEN, "Forget!" Forget what? Forget that he who out of the depth
of his love, the agony of his despair wronged you, loved you
then&mdash;loves you now, beyond all hope of happiness in this
world, or salvation in the next! Nay, more, that he would gladly
lay down the burthen of of his wretched life to spare yours one
single pang. Think of that&mdash;and then- "forget" me&mdash;if you
can!</p>

<p><i>(Exit BEN. L. 2 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Solus.)</i> "Forget!" Forget his manliness&mdash;his
devotion&mdash;above all&mdash;his great love. And forgive? Ah
dear! though my proud heart would never let me speak the words, I
forgave you long ago. But I will take it all back! <i>(Runs over to
L. calling)</i> Lionel! Lionel! Too late. He's gone! Is it not
strange that I who can see so clearly for others am blind as a mole
in my own light? When a moment ago my heart prompted my tongue to
say, "I love you, dear&mdash;I love you! " the recollection of his
unjust suspicions stirred my hot blood and my wayward temper into
fire- and now we are further apart than ever. But it</p>

<p>shall be our last misunderstanding, for to-morrow&mdash;yes,
to-morrow-! will bare my heart before him&mdash;and then,
Lionel&mdash;my Lionel <i>(Quotes)</i> "Eyes clearer grown the
truth will see / And every cloud shall roll away / That darkens
life 'twixt you and me." <i>(Exit into hotel)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Absorbed in thought, comes forward C. followed by
JERRY L.C.)</i> Nell's room! her room! and £2000. How are we to get
at those twenty hundred pound notes?</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(Stares at him&mdash;puzzled L. C.)</i> Oh! Garn, ax
me another. How are we to get at twenty pence, which is one and
eightpence, according to Cocker.</p>

<p>CAPT. £2000. How many dinners would that buy? Only
calculate.</p>

<p>JERRY. I can't. It makes me woracious. Oh! when are we agoin' to
have a skinful?</p>

<p>CAPT. Pooh! That's a trifle.</p>

<p>JERRY. Is it? A saveloy, or a sausage, or even a cold tater,
would be no trifle just now.</p>

<p>CAPT. Are you so hard set?</p>

<p>JERRY. Hard set? My teeth is sharper nor a new ground saw.</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Giving coin.)</i> Here. This will take the edge off.
<i>(crosses to L.)</i></p>

<p>JERRY. A joey. <i>(Aside.)</i> What can a cove do with a
joey?</p>

<p><i>(Counts tops of fingers. crosses to C.)</i>
</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Having got over to L.)</i> I have it. <i>(Aside.)</i>
Jerry.</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(L.C.)</i> Oh! bother. I am dividin' nothin' by half,
and addin' up the tottle, and the amount fogs me.</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(C.)</i> Lend me your knife.</p>

<p>JERRY. What for?</p>

<p>CAPT. To cut a plug of cavendish. <i>(Reaching for
knife)</i></p>

<p>JERRY. Well, here it is, but, mind, I bar hoysters! <i>(CAPT.
snatches it.)</i> And look out, for it's got a pint like a
needle.</p>

<p>CAPT. I'll take care. <i>(Cutting a plug of cavendish.)</i></p>

<p>JERRY. Here goes for a tightener in the shape of a penny
buster&mdash;a cup o' corfee and a real Billingsgate pheasant,
by-bye, my noble commander. Now I shan't be long.</p>

<p><i>(Exit 1 E. R.)</i>
</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(C.)</i> This may be useful in case
of&mdash;hem&mdash;interruption. <i>(Pockets knife.)</i></p>

<p>WALL. <i>(L.C. up stage.)</i> So may dis. <i>(Clutching
knife.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. Her room&mdash;but which is her room? That's the question.
If I could only get at her. <i>(Reflects.)</i></p>

<p><i>(NELL. appears at window below with HARRY in her arms. SHE
sits rocking him to sleep humming a song.)</i>
</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Cautiously advancing to L. of Window.)</i> By Jove,
there she is- alone, too. <i>(Taps window, NELL. starts
up.)</i></p>

<p>Hist. <i>(In a whisper.)</i> Nellie, Nellie.</p>

<p>NELL. You here&mdash;you&mdash;you? <i>(Alarmed, and putting
CHILD in cradle.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(L.C.)</i> Yes, me! Weary, footsore, starving, without
a roof to cover me.</p>

<p>NELL. I am sorry.</p>

<p>CAPT. Sorrow can't help me, but you can.</p>

<p>NELL. I? Can you ask me after&mdash;1</p>

<p>0AI'T. I know all you would say; but I was drunk&mdash;mad. You
will forgive me, if only for the child's sake, won't you? And you
won't leave me to die of cold and hunger, you haven't the heart to
do it.</p>

<p>NELL. How can I help you?</p>

<p>CAPT. Money&mdash;a little money!</p>

<p>NELL. I have only a few shillings.</p>

<p>CAPT. Well&mdash;they will suffice for food and shelter.</p>

<p>NELL. You don't deserve it; but I'll see what I can do. <i>(Exit
L.H.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(L.)</i> I can still twist the little fool round my
finger, and if I can only get from her which is her room&mdash;the
room in which that strong box is&mdash;trust me to find a way to?
open it!</p>

<p><i>(Re-enter NELL. at back from L., followed by SYBIL. who
starts when SHE sees CAPTAIN in foreground.)</i>
</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(Stepping out of door of hotel. Aside.)</i> My heart
misgives me! But with all his faults the wretch is still the father
of my child, and I cannot leave him to perish in the streets.
<i>(Drops down R. Aloud.)</i> Here is the money!</p>

<p>CAPT. Damn the money! It's not the money I want but you!</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(Shrinking away in horror.)</i> No, no! Don't
<i>(advancinq C.)</i> touch me&mdash;don't come near me!</p>

<p>CAPT. I must-I will!</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Comes down C. between them.)</i> You will not! <i>(HE
recoils L.)</i> Go to your own room&mdash;go, I tell you, and leave
this reptile to me.</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(R.C.)</i> Sybil!</p>

<p>SYBIL. No words! Do as I bid you&mdash;go!</p>

<p><i>(Exit NELL. door R.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(R.C.)</i> Now, what do you want here?</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(L.C.)</i> My wife!</p>

<p>SYBIL. She is not your wife, and what is more, thank God, she
never will be now.</p>

<p>CAPT. At any rate, I am the father of her child.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(R.C.)</i> The child whom you abandoned, while you
left his mother to the tender mercies of the streets. Go, whilst
you are safe! within hail there are men&mdash;men who will know how
to deal with a scoundrel like you.</p>

<p>CAPT. Have you done?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Unless you wish me to summon the police to discuss the
robbery at "The Golden Hole."</p>

<p>CAPT. Will that redound to the credit of the family? Isn't it
wiser to wash our dirty linen at home? Look here, I want to get out
of this infernal place, but I'm stoney broke.</p>

<p>SYBIL. How much do you require?</p>

<p>CAPT. Thirty pounds.</p>

<p>SYBIL. If I give it, will you go?</p>

<p>CAPT. Upon my honour.</p>

<p>SYBIL. Your honour?</p>

<p>CAPT. Well, the security's shaky, but it's the best I've
got.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Contemptuously.)</i> Bad is the best&mdash;but needs
must&mdash;</p>

<p>CAPT. When the devil drives. <i>(With a sneer.)</i></p>

<p>SYBIL. Just so; one moment. <i>(Goes up to hotel door, is seen
to cross behind window from R. to L.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Solus.)</i> Well&mdash;I've landed that thirty quid,
anyhow&mdash;l feel as if I had it already.</p>

<p>Re-enter SYBIL crossing rapidly from L. to R. behind window,</p>

<p>and entering froom hotel door.</p>

<p><i>(SYBIL takes out purse, and handing three Bank of England
notes to CAPT)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. 'Tis nearly all I have in the world, but take
it&mdash;take it and begone.</p>

<p>CAPT. I'm off. A fond, a last farewell to Nellie; and a
blessing, a broken-hearted father's blessing, to the boy. Farewell,
be happy as you are virtuous&mdash;ta, ta&mdash;so long&mdash;ta,
ta!</p>

<p>Remove</p>

<p><i>(Bows, laughs, and exits L. 2 E., followed by WALL.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(C.)</i> I have saved my darling. She will never look
upon his odious face, or hear his hateful voice again. Sheltered by
the strong arms and the faithful heart of the man who loves her,
and whom she loves, her happiness is secure. <i>(Approaches
door.)</i> And I&mdash;yes, I shall be happy too, for he will know
the truth at last.</p>

time for all daycent people to be in bed. <i>(Re-enter KATH. and
MYLEs from house.)</i> Be off wid you.</p>

<p>MYLES. Have you the heart to send me adrift on a night like

<p>MYLES. But the storm's coming.</p>

<p>KATH. Faix. I'm glad to hear it, for wather's half a crown a
gallon to-night.</p>

out.)</i></p>

shmell?</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(R.C.)</i> Must I box ye? Sure, I'm too tired for
nonsense, and I am that wake. <i>(Throws him off violently to
L.)</i></p>

<p>MYLES. Yes, wake as an elephant or a stame engine. Well, there
is one comfort, when I am landlord here&mdash;</p>

<p>K ATH. Ye'll have to pay the taxes.</p>

<p>MYLES. But there's one tax you'll have to pay first&mdash;poll
tax. One smack, darlin', I must and will have. <i>(About to kiss
her.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. Take it then. There! <i>(Smacks his face, slams door,
bolts it, and is heard laughing inside.)</i></p>

<p>MYLES. Begorra! but I've got it and no mistake.</p>

<p><i>(A roar of drunken voices without R., " We won't go home till
morning." Then a row as if quarrelling.)</i>

<p>MYLES. Murdher alive; but is it a fight that's goin' on, and I
not in it? and my joints getting stiff for the want of a baitin'.
Hurroo! boys, who'll rub me down wid a stick? I'm coming for the
cure. <i>(Yells, and exits R. 2 E.)</i></p>

is empty&mdash;all is quiet. I mean to have that two thousand
pounds. <i>(Producing JERRY's knife&mdash;goes to door of hotel,

<p>CAPT. <i>(In a momentary paroxysm of remorse.)</i> God forbid, I
didn't mean it, Nell. No, no, I didn't mean it! <i>(Approaching
her.)</i></p>

<p>NELL. Don't touch me, don't come near me, midnight robber,
thief, assassin! Help there, help!</p>

<p><i>(She staggers up to window, snatches jug from table L. C. and
smashes panes of glass. CAPT. gets round L. and hides behind tree,
L.C.)</i> Help, help, murder!</p>

what's up? Speak!</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(L.C.)</i> Murder!</p>

KATH., in nightdress, appears at door with a lighted candle in her
hand. She casts it aside and rushes down to NELL.)</i>

exclaiming&mdash;)</i>
</p>

<p>NELL. <i>(C.)</i> Oh, Sybil, Sybil, I'm dying!</p>

<p>OMNES. Dying!</p>

<p>NELL. Yes, murdered!</p>

hastily.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(simultaneouly)</i> Heaven forbid!</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(C.)</i> Naa, naa lass, for God's sake doan't 'ee say

<p>NELL. I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, my child, my poor motherless
child!</p>

<p><i>(SHE falls on SYBIL's shoulder for a moment.)</i>
</p>

<p>To BEN.-To save me she took the shame on herself. I wanted to
tell you, but she wouldn't let me&mdash;she wouldn't let me.

with amazement, not only at the accusation, but at his
presence.)</i>

<p>MYLES. <i>(L.C.)</i> A lie, you thafe o' the world, a lie.</p>

<h3>SCENE 1.</h3>

<p>Front wood. A large log of fallen tree C. Reeds and rutshes in
the foreground.</p>

<p>Music&mdash;Capt.'s Music.</p>

<p>Enter CAPT. L. 1 E., hurriedly, looking round. HE throws himself
breathless and exhausted on the log.</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Opens pocket-book and takes out notes.)</i> Twenty of
'em&mdash;two thousand quid&mdash;enough to make a fresh start
with. Found on me here they mean death. Yet to lose 'em involves
privation and misery worse than death. Death! Self preservation is
the first law of Nature, and 'twas a lucky inspiration to put the
job on that lout of a sailor. Yes, I'd rather he should swing for
it than I. While he is laid by the heels I can bolt and reach
'Frisco.</p>

<p><i>(WALLAROO peeks on)</i>
</p>

<p>Once there, I can change these into coin, meanwhile where can I
hide 'em I Where, where? <i>(Rises, looks off R.H., during which
action, WALLAROO. steals on from L. 1 E., then hides behind log,
watching CAPT.)</i> I have it&mdash;I'll dig a hole
and&mdash;<i>(Takes knife starts)</i>&mdash;Ha, blood, blood, her
blood! I can't endure the sight of it. No, no, there, there!
<i>(Throws knife off.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Exit WALL. glides off unseen after the knife R.H.)</i>
</p>

<p>CAPT. I didn't mean to do it, but it was her life or mine! Poor
Nell&mdash;poor little Nell. <i>(Sits. Takes flask from pocket and
drinks.)</i> So&mdash;that's better&mdash;as for these, on second
thoughts I'll keep 'em and chance it. <i>(Putting pocket-book in
breast pocket.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Enter JERRY, L. 1 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(L.C,)</i> Well, you are a nice 'un, you are, to mop
the drop on a pal. The idea of leavin' a cove in the street on such
a beastly night. And you call yourself Jonnuck? [dinkum,
honest]</p>

<p>CAPT. I was in the street myself.</p>

<p>JERRY. No?</p>

<p>CAPT. Yes!</p>

<p><i>(Re-enter WALL. R. 1 E. HE hides behind log and overhears the
subsequent conversation.)</i>
</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(L.C.)</i> Oh! that alters the case. <i>(HE sits down
beside CAPT.)</i> You didn't nobble that two thousand quid then,
arter all? <i>(Eyes HIM suspiciously.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. How could I, when someone else had been there before
me?</p>

<p>JERRY The ruinous effect of competition in business. <i>(Pause,
then significantly.)</i> I say, this is a hawful fakement, this
is.</p>

<p>CAPT. What is?</p>

<p>JERRY. Why, the cookin' o' that yere pore little donah's
goose!</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(With a shudder.)</i> It is awful.</p>

<p>JERRY. H'm, I believe yer. <i>(Pause.)</i> Do you think it was
the sailor wot put the peas in the pot?</p>

<p>CAPT. Looks like it. <i>(THEY eye each other
donbtfully.)</i></p>

<p>JERRY. H'm&mdash;M'yes&mdash;but the darbies ain't allays on the
right wristesses, you know. Did you raally see him put it
through?</p>

<p>CAPT. Of course I did.</p>

<p>JERRY. Well, it's a big plug to chaw!</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Rises&mdash;annoyed.)</i> Big or little, it has to be
swallowed. <i>(Abuptly.)</i> By the by, we may both be</p>

<p>wanted about that job at the Golden Hole.</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(Alarmed.)</i> Ginger beer!</p>

<p>CAPT. So you'd better bunk at once. Train starts in half an
hour. Take the rail to Albany, catch the boat, and in a few days
you'll be safe in Sydney!</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(Rises.)</i> lt's all very fine to say " Take the rail
and&mdash;catch the boat "&mdash;but who's to do it without a
blessed mag?</p>

<p>CAPT. H'm&mdash;I nobbled a bit last night.</p>

<p>JERRY. A bit&mdash;who did you do?</p>

<p>CAPT. Never mind, so long as it was done. Here's a fiver and a
golden Jimmy. <i>(Gives flash note and gold.)</i></p>

<p>JERRY. Oh! roast me quick and do me tender! <i>(Delighted.)</i>
Well, you are a oner to stand by a pal in a</p>

<p>hole, you is. But I say&mdash;<i>(Suspiciously)</i>&mdash;look
here, as we're both in it, why don't you bunk too?</p>

<p>CAPT. Because I have to wait till tonight for more oof!</p>

<p>JERRY. Oh, got summut else on, eh 'I <i>(Suspicionsly.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Annoyed at HIS distrust.)</i> Yes, damn you, yes!</p>

<p>JERRY. 'Nuff said&mdash;I'm off. <i>(Going L.H., stops.)</i> By
the by, hand over mv chivy.</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(R.C.)</i> Your chivy?</p>

<p>JERRY. Yes, my knife&mdash;the knife I lent you last night.</p>

<p>CAPT. Oh, the knife&mdash;I Remember&mdash;of course.</p>

<p>JERRY, In course you does, so weigh out.</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Pretends to search HIS pockets.)</i> Where can it be?
I suppose I must have dropped it.</p>

<p>JERRY. The doose, you have? But look here, it was a love token
from my donah, and if I go back without it Sally'll play up "Dicky
round the orchard."</p>

<p>CAPT. Better that than be coppered here.</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(Alarmed.)</i> Right you are, my oracle. I takes your
tip and slings my hook&mdash;sudden! <i>(Moves L.)</i> When you
race with the bobbies it's no use beatin' 'em by a head, you've got
to leave 'em at the start. You can stay for the finish, but I means
to come in fust, flags down, so here goes. <i>(Runs off quickly L.
1 E.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. Gone! Ha! ha! Safe! Him! Safe from him-</p>

</p>

<p>WARD. And in that way she died?</p>

<p>DICK. Aye! She never spoke again.</p>

<p>WARD. You knew deceased well?</p>

<p>DICK. Aye, for su&mdash;ur.</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(L.)</i> Ave coarse he did, and so did a hape of us on

<p>WARD. Silence in Court!</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(L.)</i> But sure it is the truth my boy's spakin'!</p>

<p>MYLES. Of coorse it is , divil a lie in it.</p>

<p>MAC. Silence!</p>

<p>KATH. Don't ye want the truth?</p>

<p>MAC. Oh, shut up, woman! <i>(crosses over to KATH.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. Arrah! who are you callin' a woman, I'd like to know,
Misther Mac?</p>

<p>WARD. Remove them both.</p>

<p>MAC. Come on now! <i>(MAC. seizes MYLES they struggle behind

clean and dexterous movement MAC. swings MYLES into arms of POLICE.
The following dialogue up to and inclusive of KATHLEEN's exit
speech accompanies the above action.)</i></p>

<p>MYLES. Divil a peg I'll stir out o' this.</p>

<p>KATH. That's right, Myles.</p>

<p>MAC. Come along!</p>

<p>KATH. Take your hands from my boy, or I'll be afther laying my
ten commandments on your ugly face.</p>

<p>MAC. Out you go.</p>

<p>MYLES. Hands off! I'll not be chucked.</p>

<p><i>(Excitement in Court. MYLES is thrust off R.1.E. by
POLICE.)</i>
</p>

<p>KATH. Don't hurt my boy. <i>(Shrieks.)</i> Och, murdher, ,there
goes his coat. <i>(Follows THEM off R. 1 E. expostulating.)</i></p>

<p>WARD. Really, these interruptions are scandalous. Let us get on
with the case. H'm! I believe prisoner was also attached to
deceased. was he not?</p>

<p>DICK. Well, if he wur, ah never heerd on it.</p>

<p>WARD. Then I presume there had been no quarrel between them on
your account?</p>

<p>DICK. None as ah know of.</p>

<p>WARD. Were you present when deceased took charge of the bank
notes for £2000 that are missing?</p>

<p>DICK. I wur.</p>

<p>WARD. Was the prisoner there?</p>

<p>DicK. Aye, for sure.</p>

<p>WARD. Are the numbers of the notes known? <i>(To GLEN.)</i></p>

<p>GLEN <i>(R. of table.)</i> Oh yes. And I have just been to the
bank to stop them.</p>

<p>WARD. In that case the crime won't be of much service to the
criminal.</p>

<p>GLEN. Not much. In fact, the notes may lead to his
detection.</p>

<p>WARD. Let us hope they may. <i>(To DICK.)</i> When did you last
see deceased prior to&mdash;to the murder?</p>

<p>DICK. Abawt hafe-past eleven last neet.</p>

<p>WARD. Something remarkable?</p>

<p>DICK. Aye, vaary remarkable.</p>

<p>WARD. What did she say?</p>

<p>DICK. Not much, but she did a lot.</p>

<p>WARD. What did she do?</p>

<p>DICK. That's ma business.</p>

<p>WARD. What did she do?</p>

<p>DICK. Mun ah tell him, Ben?</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(L. of table.)</i> Yes, certainly.</p>

<p>DICK. Well, she put her arms round my neck and kissed me, and
whispered, "Ah love you, Dick! Ah love you!" And so she did, God
bless her! So she did! <i>(Overcome with emotion, HE breaks
down.)</i></p>

<p>WARD. <i>(With sympathy.)</i> Mr. Garth, I have no further
questions to ask.</p>

<p>BEN. And I have none. Stand down, Dick.</p>

</p>

<p>MYLES. Ah, ha! ye want me back after kicking me out? Well, ye've
got me fresh from the gutter wid the bloom upon me. Look here, now,
at one of the daisies! <i>(Shows stains of mud.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. Myles, behave yourself now.</p>

<p>MYLES. Divil a fear o' that, darling. Well, I bear no malice, so
shake hands all round. <i>(Eagerly shakes hands with JACK, WARD.,
POLICEMEN, ALL within reach.)</i> How are yez, owld Mac? How are
yez, Jack? How are yez, Ben? How are yez, Mr Warden? How are yez,
everybody?</p>

<p><i>(Leaps on table.)</i>
</p>

<p>WARD. Get off the table, sir.</p>

<p>MYLES. What's wrong wid the table? <i>(BEN remonstrates with
MYLES.)</i> Sure, it's only the chair that's wantin'! Hand one up!
And I'll sit down, as we do at Clonakilty.</p>

<p>MAC. Come off that and come into the box!</p>

<p>KATH. Ah, don't, Myles, don't!</p>

<p>MYLES. I won't. Divil a hinge ye'll put on me. There! <i>(MAC.
pulls HIM down from table.)</i> Bad luck to yez, lave go the scruff
of me neck. <i>(Leaps among the CROWD L. MAC. pursues HIM. HE leaps
out at top, uns over to R., and leaps again among CROWD. MAC.
pursues HIM and pulls HIM out R. and lands HIM in the witness

<p>MAC. <i>(Thrusting HIM in witness box.)</i> Get into the box,
sir.</p>

<p>MYLES. Arrah, do ye call this thing a box? Look at it,
Katty.</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(Standing on chair and looking into box.)</i> I do, and
sure it's a pew widout a sate, so it is.</p>

<p>MAC. Take the Book and take the oath. "The evidence you shall
give the Court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the ttuth, so help you&mdash;"</p>

<p>MYLES. Aisy wid yez, sure I know the rest. <i>(Kisses Book with
a loud smack.)</i> But I must say ye have the quarest
way&mdash;</p>

<p>WARD. Hold your tongue, sir! Now answer me.</p>

<p>KATH. Arrah, how can the poor boy answer your Honour if he
howlds his tongue?</p>

<p><i>(Murmur of voices.)</i>
</p>

<p>MAC. Silence:</p>

<p>WARD. You know the prisoner at the bar'?</p>

<p>MYLES. Know Sailor Jack? Av course I do. Many's the drink he has
stood me.</p>

<p>WARD. That's immaterial now.</p>

<p>MYLES. But it was might convaynient then, wasn't it, Katty?</p>

<p>KATH. Thrue for ye, for many's the score he paid for you in bad
times.</p>

<p>WARD. When did you see him last?</p>

<p>MYLES. This minute, when I looked at him.</p>

<p>W ARD. Yes, yes, but we are referring to yesterday.</p>

<p>MYLES. Ye may be referring to yesterday, but you are spakin'
to-day, your Honour.</p>

<p>KATH. Av coorse ye are.</p>

<p><i>(Langhter in Court.)</i>
</p>

<p>MAC. Silence!</p>

<p>WARD. Y ou knew deceased?</p>

<p>MYLES. Troth did I, and the brightest little blue-eyed colleen
she was that ever stepped in shoe leather, while, as for her
feet&mdash;</p>

<p>WARD. Never mind her feet, we can get on without them.</p>

<p>MYLEs. But she couldn't. How the divil could she, I'd like to
know?</p>

<p><i>(Laughter.)</i>
</p>

<p>MAC. Silence!</p>

<p>WARD. Were she and the prisoner on terms of intimacy'?</p>

<p>MYLES. They were as thick as thieves.</p>

<p>WARD. Did they ever fall out?</p>

<p>MYLES. Divil a bit; sure no one could fall out with Sailor
Jack.</p>

<p>WARD. Why not?</p>

<p>MYLES. Bekase it takes two to make a quarrel, and that fellow
there hasn't the heart to kill a fly or a flea, let alone a
woman.</p>

<p>WARD. Were you present at the scene of the murder?</p>

<p>MYLES. I was, to my sorrow.</p>

<p>WARD. How came you there?</p>

<p>MYLES. Oh! aisy enough! on my feet! Ye see I'd just had a taste
of a scrimmage&mdash;enough to give me an appetite&mdash;when I
heerd cries of "Murder" and thinking there was another bit of a
fight on I tuk my shillelagh wid me, by way av bein' social.</p>

<p>WARD. When you arrived in the Square, what did you see?</p>

<p>MYLES. A sight I'll never forget. The poor darlin' lyin' in the
street in her nightgown, all over blood.</p>

<p>WARD. What did she say?</p>

<p>MYLES. Say, arrah! What does a pig say when his throat's
cut?</p>

<p>WARD. What did she say, sir?</p>

<p>MYLES. Nothin' at all! And them's the very words she uttered.
Weren't they, Katty, darlin'?</p>

<p>KATH. Iss, indeed, for I heerd them myself.</p>

<p>WARD. I can do nothing with you, my good man.</p>

<p>MYLES. And, begorra, I can do less wid you, my good man.</p>

<p>KATH. Ah! whist, Myles.</p>

<p>MYLES. Oh! I am spaichless, honey.</p>

<p>BEN. I have no questions to ask this witness, your Honour.</p>

<p>MYLES. Then you are answered in full, wid fluency. Long life to
you, Ben. <i>(MYLES stands down.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. Well, Myles, ye gave the Warden as good as he brought.</p>

<p>MYLES. Divil a fear, but owld Finn got thirty shillings for his
one pound ten. <i>(A roar of laughter. HE bows and SHE curtsies to
W ARDEN as THEY cross over to L. THEY shake hands with JACK and sit
under dock.)</i></p>

<p>MAC. Order! order!</p>

<p>GLEN. <i>(To WARD.)</i> Rum idea of order. I wonder how they
would deal with these chappies at Bow Street?</p>

<p>WARD. With our rough-and-ready community, strict rule is
impossible. But they get justice, and that is all we want in
Coolgardie. Call the next witness.</p>

<p>MAC. John Wantley.</p>

<p>VOICE. <i>(Without R.)</i> John Wantley.</p>

<p>Enter CAPTAIN JACK. HE is sworn.</p>

<p>WARD. Now, sir, you knew deceased?</p>

<p>CAPT. Yes.</p>

<p>WARD. She was your wife?</p>

<p>CAPT. Not exactly.</p>

<p>WARD. Well, I suppose she ought to have been?</p>

<p>CAPT. If you like to put it that way.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Indignantly interutpting.)</i> You were the father of
her child anyhow!</p>

<p>CAPT. She told me so. <i>(With a sneer.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. <i>(L. Indignantly.)</i> Arrah, do you hear that,
Myles?</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(L. Angrily.)</i> Oh! the dirty blackguard; let me get
at him.</p>

<p><i>(MYLES tries to strip of HIS coat to get at CAPT., but is
restrained by KATH.)</i>
</p>

<p>MAC. Order! order!</p>

<p>WARD. <i>(Severely.)</i> Really, Mr Leigh, these interruptions
are intolerable.</p>

<p>BEN. I beg your Honour's pardon.</p>

<p>WARD. H'm! Did you see deceased last night?</p>

<p>CAPT. Yes.</p>

<p>WARD. Where?</p>

<p>CAPT. At the door of the "Erin Go Bragh."</p>

<p>WARD. Did you have any conversation with her?</p>

<p>CAPT. Yes.</p>

<p>WARD. What took place?</p>

<p>CAPT. I asked her to come home.</p>

<p>WARD. And she?</p>

<p>CAPT. Well, her sister interrupted us-</p>

<p>WARD. And the result?</p>

<p>CAPT. She refused.</p>

<p>WARD. And&mdash;?</p>

<p>CAPT. I went one way, they went another.</p>

<p>WARD. H'm! Did you see her again before the murder 'I</p>

<p>CAPT. No.</p>

<p>WARD. Did you see her afterwards?</p>

<p>CAPT. Yes.</p>

<p>WARD. State precisely what occurred.</p>

<p>CAPT. Passing by the Bank 0f Australasia I heard cries of "Help-
murder."</p>

<p>WARD. Yes.</p>

<p>CAPT. As I came up I saw deceased struggling with the
prisoner.</p>

<p>WARD. You are sure it was the prisoner?</p>

<p>CAPT. Quite sure.</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(Aside.)</i> Oh, the monumental Ananias!
<i>(L.)</i></p>

<p>KATH. <i>(Aside.)</i> Aisy, Myles, aisy. <i>(L.)</i></p>

<p>WARD. Well, what followed?</p>

<p>CAPT. A knife flashed in the air, and with a cry, she fell to
the earth. I accused prisoner of the murder and gave him in
charge.</p>

<p>MYLES. Ye did! ye lyin' vagabone! ye did!</p>

<p>MAC. Silence!</p>

<p>WARD. Mr. Leigh, have you any questions to ask the witness?</p>

<p>BEN. A great many, your Honour. <i>(BEN. rises to cross examine
WANTLEY.)</i> Now, sir, attend to me. Were you not formerly in Her
Majesty's service?</p>

<p>CAPT. I was.</p>

<p>BEN. An officer, I believe?</p>

<p>CAPT. I was, and proud of my regiment.</p>

<p>BEN. Was your regiment proud of you?</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Angrily.)</i> Sir!</p>

<p>BEN. Were you not called upon to send in your papers?</p>

<p>CAPT. That has nothing to do with this inquiry.</p>

<p>BEN. But it has a great deal to do with the credence to be
attached to your evidence. Did you send in your papers in
consequence of having been detected cheating at cards? Yes or
no.</p>

<p>CAPT. I decline to answer.</p>

<p>BEN. Very good. Your Honour can draw your own inference. H'm!
You know the prisoner at the bar?</p>

<p>CAPT. Yes.</p>

<p>BEN. When did you last see him prior to&mdash;to&mdash;the
murder?</p>

<p>CAPT. A week ago.</p>

<p>BEN. Where?</p>

<p>CAPT. At "The Golden Hole."</p>

<p>BEN. Was that on the occasion when you robbed me of a thousand
pounds?</p>

<p>CAPT. I don't know about robbery.</p>

<p>BEN. But I do, and if needs be I shall prove it.</p>

<p>WARD. Mr Leigh, Mr Leigh, you really must proceed by the rules
of evidence.</p>

<p>BEN. Rules! Rules that shelter subterfuge and falsehood. Good
God, sir, can't you see I'm battling for my brother's life, and yet
you seek to fetter me by rottten "rules of evidence."</p>

<p>WARD. Very well, sir, go on, conduct your case in your own
way.</p>

<p>BEN. I will, sir.</p>

<p>MYLES. More power to ye, Ben.</p>

<p>MAC. Silence!</p>

<p>BEN. When did you last see the prisoner prior to the robbery at
"The Golden Hole?"</p>

<p>CAPT. I forget.</p>

<p>BEN. Try to remember. Was it not six months ago, when you
attempted to steal the great nugget, and, failing that, you and
your mates tried to murder him?</p>

<p>CAPT. Murder! Rubbish! We fought, and he had the best of it
through you.</p>

<p>MYLES. As he will now, plase God.</p>

<p>KATH. Amin!</p>

<p>MAC. Silence! <i>(crosses to R.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. Is it a fact that I got back the thousand pounds you robbed
me of?</p>

<p>CAPT. It is a fact that you drugged and hocussed us, and left us
to die out there in the bush.</p>

<p>WARD. Obviously you didn't die.</p>

<p>KATH. Of course not. Them that are born to be hanged may be
drugged, but they'll never be drowned.</p>

<p>MYLES. Thrue for yez, darlin'! <i>(Roar of laughter.)</i></p>

<p>MAC. Silence!</p>

<p>BEN. Will you swear that your object in coming to the "Erin Go
Bragh" last night was not to rob me again of that £1000?</p>

<p>CAPT. I will.</p>

<p>BEN. Take care. Did this unhappy woman not endeavour to prevent
the robbery?</p>

<p>CAPT. How should I know?</p>

<p>BEN. I will tell you by and by. Meanwhile, with your Honour's
permission, I'll postpone the further examination of this
witness.</p>

<p>WARD. Certainly. Stand down, sir.</p>

<p><i>(CAPT. is about to go R.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. But don't leave the Court.</p>

<p><i>(MAC. prevents his leaving.)</i>
</p>

<p>MOB. Yah!</p>

<p>MAC. Order, order!</p>

<p><i>(CAPT. sits down in front of witness box.)</i>
</p>

<p>WARD. Really, if this goes on, I shall order the Court to be
cleared.</p>

<p>MYLES. Aisy, boys, aisy, unless you want to get the order of
"the chuck." <i>(Roars of laughter.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. I shall not waste your Honour's time by making any
preliminary observations for the defence, but shall proceed at
once, not only to prove the prisoner's innocence of any complicity
in this atrocious crime, but to bring it home to the real murderer.
<i>(Sensation in Court.)</i> Call Sybil Grey.</p>

<p>MAC. Sybil Grey. <i>(He stands in front of CAPTAIN so that SYBIL
does not see HIM when SHE enters.)</i></p>

<p>Music.</p>

<p>Enter SYBIL. Silence and sympathy the moment SHE appears.
GLENDARGLE approaches and assists HER into witness box. SHE is
sworn by MAC.</p>

<p>BEN. Miss Grey&mdash;the deceased Nelly Grey&mdash;was your
sister?</p>

<p>SYBIL. My only one.</p>

<p>BEN. Look at the prisoner at the bar. <i>(SHE does so.)</i> Do
you know him?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Certainly.</p>

<p>BEN. Did your sister know him?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Up to yesterday he was one of her most intimate
friends.</p>

<p>BEN. Did anything occur in the course of the day to interrupt
their friendship?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Not that I am aware of.</p>

<p>BEN. When did you last see your sister prior to the murder?</p>

<p>SYBIL. About half-past eleven last night.</p>

<p>BEN. Where?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Just outside the door of the " Erin Go Brag h."</p>

<p>BEN. Was she alone?</p>

<p>SYBIL. No.</p>

<p>BEN. Who was with her?</p>

<p>SYBIL. A&mdash;a&mdash;man.</p>

<p>BEN. If you were to see that man again, would you remember
him</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Bitterly.)</i> Remember! I shall never forget
him.</p>

<p>BEN. Is he in Court?</p>

<p>SYBIL. I don't know.</p>

<p>BEN. Step down and look round.</p>

<p>Music.</p>

<p><i>(SYBIL slowly descends, assisted by GLEN. BEN. crosses to
R.C. while SHE crosses to L., scans the SPECTATORS as SHE faces
round her to R. SHE catches sight of CAPT.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Pointing to CAPT.)</i> That is the man!</p>

<p><i>(CAPT. starts up.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(A TABLEAU of general excitement.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(After a momentary pause.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(R.)</i> You are sure of that?</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(L.)</i> Quite sure.</p>

<p>CAPT. Just so! We met last night. I little thought we should
meet again so soon, and on so sad an occasion; but we can mingle
our tears together, can't we, Duchess?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Wretch! don't speak&mdash;don't look at me! The sight of
your face- the sound of your voice&mdash;sets my blood on fire.</p>

<p>CAPT. Dear me! I'd no idea you were so combustible!</p>

<p>SYBIL. Don't dare to mock my misery. You may baffle human
justice, but you can't escape Divine vengeance. It may not be
to-day or to-morrow&mdash;next week or next year but it will come
as surely as I stand here; and when it does come, God grant I may
be there to see.</p>

<p>BEN. Amen! amen! Now tell the Court what took place during your
interview with this gentleman.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(L.C.)</i> Must I&mdash;must I?</p>

<p>BEN. The life of an innocent man is at stake.</p>

<p>SYBIL. I&mdash;I&mdash;<i>(A pause.)</i></p>

<p>WARD. The Court is already aware, Miss Grey, of the unfortunate
relations between your sister and yonder person, and the truth
cannot shame you.</p>

<p><i>(SYBIL looks appealingly at BEN.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. Must I?</p>

<p>BEN. Speak.</p>

<p>SYBIL. He was endeavouring to induce my sister to return to him
to share his infamous life. I refused to permit it. He threatened
to expose us both, unless we paid him a sum of money.</p>

<p>BEN. Did you do so?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Yes.</p>

<p>BEN. How much?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Thirty pounds.</p>

<p>BEN. When you had submitted to this extortion-</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Interrupting.)</i> Extortion!</p>

<p>BEN. I said extortion! What followed?</p>

<p>SYBIL. He left us for good, as I imagined.
<i>(Significantly.)</i> I saw my sister to her own chamber and
returned to mine.</p>

<p>BEN. And then?</p>

<p>SYBIL. I had barely got to rest when I was aroused by a piercing
cry of "Murder! " It was her voice. I rushed out, and found her
stabbed to the heart and dying in the street.</p>

<p>BEN. Was she alone?</p>

<p>SYBIL. No! The prisoner was supporting her.</p>

<p>BEN. Now, I ask you, was there anything to indicate, or even to
suggest, that he had murdered her?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Nothing whatever.</p>

<p>JACK. God bless you, Duchess.</p>

<p>SYBIL. I know who murdered her! God knows! and in His own good
time He will make it known to all the world. <i>(Fixing HER eye on
the CAPT.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. He will! He will! be sure of that.</p>

<p><i>(BEN. resumes his old place L. of table for remainder of
cross examination.)</i>
</p>

<p>WARD. Sit down, Miss Grey.</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(Supporting SYBIL.)</i> Keep up, darlin', keep up. Sure
God's good, and we're all in His hands.</p>

<p>SYBIL. I know it! I know it!</p>

<p><i>(Sitting L. of table under the dock. SHE fixes the CAPTAIN
with HER eyes. HE tries to avert HER gaze; every time that HE does
so, HE is drawn back to HER in spite of himself.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Commencing cross examination. To CAPT.)</i> Captain
Wantley, I should like to ask you a few more questions. <i>(CAPT.
moves as if about to re-enter the box.)</i></p>

<p>WARD. Don't trouble to return to the box, reply where you
stand.</p>

<p>BEN. Now, sir, you have heard the last witness. Is it true that
she gave you thirty pounds last night?</p>

<p>CAPT. Yes.</p>

<p>BEN. Then why didn't you tell us before?</p>

<p>CAPT. Because I didn't think it necessary.</p>

<p>MYLES. But you got the money all the same, you bla'guard. <i>(A
laugh.)</i></p>

<p>MAC. Order, order!</p>

<p>BEN. Well, sir, after you had levied this blackmail-</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Indignantly.)</i> Blackmail!</p>

<p>BEN. I said blackmail!</p>

<p>WARD. Really, Mr Leigh, this exceeds the licence of the
advocate.</p>

<p>BEN. Licence! licence! God grant me patience! " Blackmail " is
an English word which has a precise significance, so whether you
like it or not, Mr Warden, I stick to the word which denotes the
infamous occupation of a scoundrel.</p>

<p>WARD. Well, go on, sir, go on!</p>

<p>BEN. So, sir, after you had levied this "blackmail" you took
your departure.</p>

<p>CAPT. I did. <i>(Sullenly.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. And you say you did not see deceased again until the moment
of the murder?</p>

<p>CAPT. I did not.</p>

<p><i>(Re-enter DICK hastily, R.1 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>DICK. One moment, Mr Warden, ah've summat important to say to
Ben. May ah speak wi' him jest hafe a minit?</p>

<p>WARD. Certainly.</p>

<p><i>(CAPT. resumes HIS seat. BEN comes rapidly down the front to
DICK WHO whispers to HIM.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Aflame, aside.)</i> You don't mean it, man? You don't
mean it?</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(The same.)</i> But ah do tho'.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Aside.)</i> Thank God! thank God! If what you say be
true&mdash;</p>

<p>DICK. It's God's truth.</p>

<p>BEN. Why, then, I hold his life within my hand. Come, lad, come,
quick, quick.</p>

<p><i>(Exeunt BEN and DICK rapidly R. 1 E.)</i>
</p>

<p>JACK. Please, your Honour, mayn't I have a look in here?</p>

<p>WARD. Better hold your tongue.</p>

<p>JACK. But I can't, while that lubber's lyin' like a lodginghouse
crimp. Ye see it's like this&mdash;I'd just turned into my
hammock&mdash;</p>

<p>WARD. Mind! Every word you say may be used against you.</p>

<p>JACK. The truth can't harm me, your Honour. You see I'd just
dropped off to sleep when I heard a scream, then came cries of
"Murder!" It was poor little Nell's voice. So I jumped into my
duds, crowded all sail for the spot, and found her staggerin' about
like a water-logged barque in a gale. At sight of me she lurches
forrard, and founders in my arms, for the poor lass was bleedin' to
death&mdash;and that's all I know about this cursed business. Ah,
Duchess, if I'm getting water-logged it isn't for myself, it's for
her and poor Dick, and for you, dear&mdash;for you.</p>

<p><i>(SYBIL extends HER hand, HE kisses it, clasps it in both HIS,
and falls silently weeping over it.)</i>
</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(With sympathy and tenderness.)</i> Arrah, don't take
on so, man alive! Sure, it'll all come right by and by. Remember,
"There's a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft to keep a
look-out for poor Jack."</p>

<p>KATH. Luk, luk, Myles! Here's Ben and Dick comin' back.</p>

<p>MYLES. Then&mdash;Attention! Heads up! Eyes right! As you was
before you wur down in the mouth.</p>

<p><i>(JACK stands erect and confident.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(From this moment all is excitement to the end of Act.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(Re-enter BEN and DICK R. 1 E., in a fever heat.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(C. Triumphant, aside.)</i> I have him, man alive, I
have him.</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(Aside R.C.)</i> Ah wish ah had, ah'd shake the life
out of his cowardly carcase.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Aside.)</i> And cheat the hangman? No! leave him to
me&mdash;to me. Be sure you have them ready when I call.</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(Aside.)</i> No fear. <i>(Exit R. 1 E.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Returns to table L.C.)</i> Now, sir, may I trouble you
to stand up again? <i>(CAPT. stands up.)</i> You have sworn that
when you arrived at the scene of the murder, you saw deceased
struggling with the prisoner?</p>

<p>CAPT. I have.</p>

<p>BEN. You have also sworn that you saw a knife flashing in the
air?</p>

<p>CAPT. And so I did.</p>

<p>BEN. Would you know that knife again if you saw it?</p>

<p>CAPT. Certainly.</p>

<p>BEN. Was it anything like&mdash;<i>(showing
knife)</i>&mdash;this? <i>(Great excitement in Court.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Staggered.)</i> No&mdash;o!</p>

<p>BEN. That you swear?</p>

<p>CAPT. That I swear.</p>

<p>BEN. Very good. <i>(CAPTAIN sits.)</i> Call Wallaroo, the
black!</p>

<p>MAC. Wallaroo! Wallaroo!</p>

<p><i>(WALL. springs on R. 1 E. and bounds into witness box.)</i>
</p>

<p>WALL. Here, Massa Ben.</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(To WALL.)</i> Now, attend, Wallaroo. Have you ever seen
this knife before?</p>

<p>WALL. Yohi!</p>

<p>BEN. Where?</p>

<p>WALL. At de cross roads des morning, when dat dar dam tief throw
him away among de rushes, and Wallaroo find him and bring him
here!</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Starts up.)</i> The black beast lies. I never saw the
cursed thing in my life before!</p>

<p>BEN. We shall see about that. Call Jeremiah Simpson.</p>

<p>MAC. Jeremiah Simpson! <i>(Calling off stage R.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Aside, derisively.)</i> Ay, call away; he is half-way
to Southern Cross by this time.</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(Outside.)</i> 'Ere, I say. Take your knuckles out o'
my neck!</p>

<p>CAPT. My God, he is here l</p>

<p><i>(Enter THE LARR. [JERRY] in charge of a POLICEMAN R. 1
E.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(Quickly to MAC.)</i> Keep those men apart. <i>(MAC.
quickly stands between THEM.)</i> Now, sir, look at this knife.
Have you ever seen it before?</p>

<p>JERRY. Seein' it's my own, in course I 'ave.</p>

<p>BEN. When did you see it last?</p>

<p>JERRY. Last night.</p>

<p>BEN. Did you lose it or sell it?</p>

<p>JERRY. Neither.</p>

<p>BEN. What did you do with it?</p>

<p>JERRY. Lent it.</p>

<p>BEN. To whom?</p>

<p>JERRY. To the Captain there. <i>(Points to HIM.)</i></p>

<p>Music.</p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(Passionately.)</i> A lie, a lie! A cursed lie! Let me
pass! Let me pass, I say! <i>(All start up.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Rushing over to R. is confronted by DicK, who re-enters 1 E.
R.)</i>
</p>

<p>DICK. Not this way.</p>

<p><i>(CAPT. now darts over L., is confronted by MYLES.)</i>
</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(L.)</i> No, nor this.</p>

<p><i>(MYLES and BEN simultaneonsly seize CAPT. By one clean and
dexterous movement they swing HIM round to R.C. In the struggle
pocket-book falls to ground L. C.)</i>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(L.C. Snatching up book and plucking out notes.)</i>
Ha! The notes- the stolen notes! <i>(holds them up in HER R.
hand.)</i></p>

<p>BEN. <i>(C. With HIS right hand holds CAPTAIN by throat, forcing
HIM to HIS knees, with HIS left hand pointing to the stolen
notes.)</i> Assassin, behold the proof of your guilt!</p>

<p>WARDEN. <i>(Rising without an instant's pause, and in a voice
which dominates the crowd.)</i> John Wantley, you are committed to

Greecian statue Neptune risin' from the sea, in the full nautical
dress of the period.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. I'm on in this scene?</p>

<p>MYLES. Av coarse ye are! <i>(To JERRY.)</i> A bumper for Misther
Von Swop. Here's your health, Glendargle!</p>

<p>OMNES. Ay! ay!</p>

<p><i>(MEN bring round wine to girls.)</i>

<p>KATH. But where's my single young man lodger? Where's Sailor
Jack?</p>

<p>BRIDESMAIDS. <i>(With great alacrity.)</i>
Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;where's Jack?</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(Entering R.C. and speaking from plaiform.)</i> Here he
is, girls, as large as life and twice as natural! <i>(All laugh as
they turn round to look at him. He comes down C.)</i> My dear eyes,
Kitty, but you are a at Lloyd's&mdash;a regular clipper&mdash;and
I'd like to clip you!</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(Coming down C. to L.)</i> Divil doubt yez, ye
bla'guard! But where have ye been, at all, at all? Faix, ye were
nearly in time to be too late.</p>

<p>JACK. Well, you see I was waitin' for my Sunday-go-to-Meetin'
togs, and they haven't turned up yet.</p>

<p>MYLES. Never mind the togs so long as you are here.</p>

<p>JACK. Myles, you thief o' the world&mdash;you cut me out with
the only woman I ever adored.</p>

<p>KATH. G'long with your nonsense.</p>

<p>JACK. Non sense! It's gospel! and I'm that wild at being
chucked, I've half a mind, out of sheer spite, to marry someone
else&mdash;that is if I could get anyone to have me.</p>

<p>KATH. No fear o' that. Here's half a dozen ready to jump at
yez&mdash;if you'd only give 'em the ghost of a</p>

<p>chance.</p>

<p>JACK. No?</p>

<p>KATH. Yes!</p>

<p>JACK. Then here goes. Who'll have a single young man with a soft
heart and a hard head, sound wind and limb and watch works? By
Jove, if I might only set up a Mormon establishment I'd go for the
whole blessed lot.</p>

<p>GIRLS. No!</p>

<p>JACK. Yes! But, as you see, unfortunately I can only marry
one-at-a-time&mdash;why then&mdash;</p>

<p>GIRLS. Yes, then&mdash;<i>(Eaqerly.)</i></p>

<p>JACK. I must go and see if that darned tailor has turned up. If
he hasn't I'll tan his hide for him.</p>

<p>GIRLS. O-o-oh!</p>

<p><i>(Exit door R.)</i>
</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(Going over R. and calling out after JACK.)</i> But I
say, Jack, where's Ben?</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(Without.)</i> At the Golden Hole.</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(With a scream.)</i> At the Goolden Hole! But he was to
give me away! <i>(Going down C.)</i></p>

<p>VON SWOP. <i>(Advancing L.)</i> Nefare mind! I'll gib you away,
Mistress Katty! though, donner und blitzen, I'd rather keep you for
myself.</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(R.C.)</i> Divil doubt yez, ye owld sinner.
<i>(Wedding BELLS.)</i> D'ye hear thim bells? D'ye know what
they're sa yin', Katty?</p>

<p>KATH. <i>(R.C.)</i> Sorr!l a bit.</p>

<p>MYLES. Divil a bit of sorrow, but a bucketful of joy. They's
sayin' "Good-bye, Katty Darlin', ye're goin' out an O'Mara, and
ye'll come in an O'Hooligan." Take your places! Fall in, boys and
girls, and divil takes the hindmost.</p>

Happiness and me have parted company ever sin' ever sin'. It doan't

<p>JERRY. <i>(With dignity.)</i> Ahem! The Misses left me in

<p>DICK. Left thee in charge? What for?</p>

<p>JERRY. Cos I saved Sailor Jack from the gallows and put the
Captain's neck in the halter.</p>

<p>DICK. To keep thine own out. Ah! thoust nobbut a wastrel!
<i>(Comes down R.C.)</i> ,TmmY. In course! In course I yam! What
else can you expect when a chap's born in the gutter and never has
a chance to git out? <i>(Comes down L.C.)</i> But look y'ere, Mr
Yorkshire. I've starved, lied, cadged, thieved for a livin', but I
wish I may die if I ever lifted a hand crool 'gin a woman in all my
life! I know I'm a bad lot, but I ain't quite so bad as that.
<i>(DicK gives ms hand to JERRY.)</i> When I twigged them there
bank notes in Court and noo 'ow he got 'em, and when I see the
white face and the great starin' eyes of the sweet little donah
that he murdered, then I says to myself, says I Jerry, gawn! Chuck
it off your chest, and give him his gruel! " And I did. I guv it
'im 'ot with a spoon as big as a ladle. And now the rope's ready,

<p>JERRY. Missed! Who's missed? What's missed? <i>(Runt up to

loose and on the rampage, running amuck with a revolver.

for action. HE looks round the stage, peers through doorway R.,
shakes his head, turning sees bar.)</i>

<p>WALL. Ah, dar! <i>(Rushes up, leaps over coutnter. As WALL does

<p><i>(Enter SYBIL, DICK and SAILOR JACK R.C. SYBIL is in deep
mourning.)</i>
</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(R.C.)</i> You can't be serious, Dick?</p>

<p>DICK <i>(L.C.)</i> Ah am tho'.</p>

<p>JACK. You don't mean to say that you won't come to the wedding
breakfast?</p>

<p>DICK. Sorrow's a sore guest at a feast.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(C.)</i> Right, Richard, right! Our loss is too recent
and our grief too great. Besides, our sadness would mar their
joy.</p>

<p>DICK. True, lass, true! For my part, ah hate t' cursed place;
and ah sail never rest till ah'm well out of it.</p>

<p>SYBIL. Nor I either. <i>(crosses toR. and up stage.)</i></p>

<p>DICK. Reet, lass, reet! Twelve o'clock to-day is fixed for
completion of purchase of t' mine; we've only got to cop t' brass,
sign t' papers, and we'll be off wi' t' bairn to-morrow. <i>(Going
L.)</i></p>

<p>JACK. <i>(C.)</i> Going to take the kiddy-widdy with you?</p>

<p>DICK. Aye, lad, for sure! Barely an hour afore ah lost my poor
wench ah promised her that "My mother should be her mother, and her
child my child," and ah'll keep my word.</p>

<p><i>(DICK Exit L. door.)</i>
</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(Aside.)</i> Poor Dick! <i>(Going into R. corner, turns
and sees SYBIL. Rather bitterly.)</i> And so your going to leave
us, too, Duchess&mdash;going home? <i>(R.C.)</i></p>

<p>Music-" The Old House at Home." pp.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(L.C.)</i> I am there already. I see it. The garden
with its wealth of fruit and flowers, the antique dial stone, the
plashing fountain sparkling in the sun, while the weeny red fish
dart to and fro in the basin below. Before us stands the old gabled
grange, with the tall poplars peeping over the roof; high above our
heads, from his eyrie on the steep hill beside the castle keep,
rises the old minster like</p>

<p>some grim Gothic giant mounting guard over the heart of
England&mdash;from the Trent to the Humber, from the centre to the
sea.</p>

<p>pp. Musicc ends.</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(Sarcastically.)</i> A mighty pretty picture! How do
you mean to get there?</p>

<p>SYBIL. By rail to Albany, and thence by ship to England.</p>

<p>JACK. But that will cost money.</p>

<p>SYBIL, <i>(L.C.)</i> I know. <i>(Smiling.)</i></p>

<p>JACK. <i>(R.C.)</i> A month ago you told me you had neither
money nor friends.</p>

<p>SYBIL. True; but now I have both.</p>

<p>JACK. Both!</p>

<p>SYBIL. Yes! Since I spoke to you, a sum of £5000 has been placed
to my account at the bank, by a friend of my mother's.</p>

<p>JACK. Oh! indeed. May I ask this friend's name?</p>

<p>SYBIL. You may, but I can't tell you.</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(R.C.)</i> Can't tell me! Why not?</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(L.C., smiling.)</i> Because I don't know it
myself.</p>

<p>JACK. Don't know it!</p>

<p>SYBIL. No. The people at the bank won't tell me.</p>

<p>JACK. Doesn't that strike you as being rather strange?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Well, yes, it does. I can only surmise that it comes from
Sir Philip Lascelles, my mother's brother. <i>(Going down
L.H.)</i></p>

<p>JACK. <i>(Significantly, and getting excited.)</i> Suppose,
instead of your mother's brother, it came from somebody else's
brother?</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(L.)</i> Somebody else's brother&mdash;somebody
else's? What do you mean? <i>(Eagerly and getting excited.)</i></p>

<p>JACK. <i>(Significantly.)</i> I mean&mdash;that if you knew
where that money carne from&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I only say
perhaps&mdash;for woman are kittle-cattle&mdash;you mightn't be in
such a deuce of a hurry to get away after all.</p>

<p><i>(The remainder of this SCENE very quick.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. Mightn't I?</p>

<p>JACK. Or anyhow, perhaps you wouldn't go alone!</p>

<p>SYBIL. And why not, pray?</p>

<p>JACK. Because I don't think you'd have the heart to leave
him.</p>

<p>SYBIL. Him? Who?</p>

<p>JACK. Never mind.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(L.C.)</i> But I do mind&mdash;of whom are you
speaking?</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(R.C.)</i> Can't you guess?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Guess?</p>

<p>JACK. Do you think there are two men in W estralia who'd leave
themselves penniless for your sake?</p>

<p>SYRIL. For my sake&mdash;mine?</p>

<p>JACK. There, the eat's out of the bag, so go
home&mdash;<i>(crosses to R.C.E. in great excitement)</i>&mdash;or
go to Hong Kong, if you like, but don't expect his brother to say
good luck go with you, for you'll leave bitter bad luck and a
broken heart behind. <i>(Goes towards R.D.)</i></p>

<p>SYBIL. Not so, not so! Where is he?</p>

<p>JACK. On the way here.</p>

<p>SYBIL. Here? here? When will he arrive?</p>

<p>JACK. In half an hour.</p>

<p>SYBIL. In half an hour?</p>

<p>JACK. As sure as he's alive. <i>(At door R.C.)</i></p>

<p>SYBIL. But why? Why did he go away without a word, and why has
he remained silent for three long months?</p>

<p>JACK. If you want to know the truth, ask him yourself.</p>

<p><i>(Exit door R.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL,. <i>(Solus C.)</i> I ought to have known it&mdash;known
it from the first- but he? He took a hasty woman at her word, and
left me&mdash;left without a sign, a look&mdash;and I&mdash;I
thought I had steeled my heart, and in my loneliness and desolation
I longed for home.</p>

<p>Music-" Home, Sweet Home."</p>

<p>SYBIL. Ah, home will be no home without him. <i>(crosses to
L.)</i> Come back then&mdash;oh, come back, my love, and let me
take the sting out of my cruel words; come back, my big, brave man,
come back, and take me to your heart!</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(R.C.)</i> Aye, time's up to complete purchase of" The
Golden Hole."</p>

<p>GLEN. <i>(L.C.)</i> I'm ready&mdash;and the money is lying at

foot-sore, and contrasts strangely and strongly with BRIDAL GUESTS.

<p><i>(A general movement&mdash;EVERYBODY turns round to look at

<p>BEN. And I tell you I am not.</p>

<p>OMNES. Not&mdash;?</p>

<p>GLEN. Why not?</p>

<p>BEN. Because there is not an ounce of gold left in "The Golden
Hole."</p>

<p>KATH. That will I, in less than no time.</p>

<p><i>(Exit off platform L.C.)</i>
</p>

<p>DICK. So then, Ben, " T' Golden Hoel" has turned out a dust hoel
after all?</p>

<p>BEN. Not exactly; but it's a mere chute that's quite cleaned
out.</p>

<p>JACK. <i>(L.)</i> Then it's all UP.</p>

<p>BEN. Not quite.</p>

<p>OMNES. Not quite?</p>

<p>BEN. Not exactly. Listen!</p>

<p>Music.</p>

<p>BEN. I paid off my men to the last shilling and made tracks for
home. All at once night came down with a rush&mdash;black night, so
black that I couldn't see an inch before me. Crawling along, I
stumbled over a snag, and down, down I went, till I came to anchor
with a crash that shook the life out of me. I remembered nothing
more till daybreak, when I awoke and found myself at the bottom of
a shaft twenty or thirty feet deep, with a head fit to split and a
skin full of aching bones. Beside me, almost within touch of my
hand, lay a mouldering skeleton, and clasped to</p>

<p>his bony breast, clutched in his bony fingers, I found this.
<i>(Shows nugget.)</i></p>

<p><i>(General excitement.)</i>
</p>

<p>JACK. By Jove! it's splendid.</p>

<p>VON SWOP. Splendid! It's magnificent!</p>

<p>MYLES. The most gorgeous stuff I ever saw in my life.</p>

<p>DICK. Ten to one it'll run from five to five hundred ounces to
t' ton.</p>

<p>OMNES. Five hundred&mdash;five thousand. No!</p>

<p>BEN. Yes! and what's more! It comes from a true fissure vein,
where there are thousands and thousands of tons waiting to be got
out l</p>

<p>OMNES. You don't say that?</p>

<p>BEN. But I do, though.</p>

<p>MYLES. Then, begorra, it's worth all "The Goolden Holes " in the
world!</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(R.C.)</i> Well, all we've got to do now is to find t'
brass for t' working capital.</p>

<p>GLEN. How much?</p>

<p>DICK. Say ten or twelve thaasand pound.</p>

<p>MYLES &amp; JACK <i>(Simultaneously)</i> Sure that's a
flea-bite; we'll find it ourselves.</p>

<p>GLEN &amp; VON SWOP <i>(Simultaneously)</i> Of course we
will.</p>

<p>DICK. Reet you are, lads; say two thaasand a-piece and t' job's
done.</p>

<p>JERRY. <i>(R.)</i> Then I'm on the job; who'll lend me the oof?
<i>(pause)</i> Don't all speak at once.</p>

<p><i>(SYBIL rushes on L.C. followed by KATHLEEN, SYBIL is
breathless with excitement. SHE remains on platform C. overhearing
conversation in foreground.)</i>
</p>

<p>BEN, Fair and softly, lads. fair and softly; it's all very well
for those who have £2000, but I haven't 2000 pence l</p>

<p>MYLES. <i>(L.C.)</i> The divil!</p>

<p><i>(General astonishment at BEN's poverty.)</i>
</p>

<p>DICK. Then what hast done wi' thy share o' t' brass, lad?</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(C. brusquely.)</i> That's my business l</p>

<p>DICK. <i>(Emphaticallly.)</i> Butsi' thee here, Ben, ah'se
Yorkshire up reet and down straight, and ah cannah understand what
thou'st done wi' thy £5000.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(Coming forward, L.C.)</i> But I can!</p>

<p><i>(BEN starts to L.C. OMNES open out C. and L. in
amazement.)</i>
</p>

<p>OMNES. The Duchess l</p>

<p><i>(From this moment, a rush at fever heat to the end.)</i>
</p>

<p>SYBIL. He parted with it a month ago.</p>

<p>DICK <i>(R.)</i> What! gambled it away?</p>

<p>SYBIL. No, gave it away.</p>

<p>OMNES. Gave it away?</p>

<p>SYBIL. Yes! Gave it to an ungrateful, barbarous woman!</p>

<p>BEN. <i>(L.C. Angrily to JACK.)</i> Oh, Jack, Jack, you've
betrayed me</p>

<p>JACK <i>(L.)</i> Betrayed!</p>

<p>BEN. Silence, I tell you, silence!</p>

<p>SYBIL <i>(R.C.)</i> The time for silence is past. Oh, how blind,
how base I have been not to have known there was but one man in all
the world who would make such a sacrifice for my sake. But I know
all now&mdash;know my own heart, which has always loved you. Ah,
dear, when I was hardest upon you, I loved you best. Take your
money back.</p>

<p>BEN. Take it back?</p>

<p>SYBIL. But take me with it.</p>

<p>BEN. Take you?</p>

<p>SYRIL. Yes, take me to that faithful heart, there let me cling
through life, and until death. <i>(Advancing towards BEN.)</i></p>

<p>CAPT. <i>(leaps on balcony C., exclaiming)</i> In death be it
then. <i>(Fires at BEN.)</i></p>

<p>Music.&mdash;Capt.</p>

<p><i>(All the following action quick as thought. General
consternation. BEN. staggers back to L. Simultaneously. SYBIL
starts R. with a scream. WALL. leaps up C. and stabs CAPT, who
falls dead head at foot of step, feet on platform.)</i>
</p>

<p>WALL. Wallaroo kill&mdash;kill&mdash;kill!</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(To BEN, without an instant's pause.)</i> But you,
dear, you?</p>

<p>BEN. Safe&mdash;unhurt.</p>

<p>SYBIL. <i>(With a ravissement of joy.)</i> Thank God! Thank God!
<i>(Leaps into BENS arms C.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Shouts, waving of hats and handkerchiefs.)</i>
</p>

<p>Music.</p>

<p><i>(The curtain rapidly descends.)</i>
</p>

<p><i>(For call:&mdash;POLICE behind WALL. who stands with folded
arms, REST as before.)</i>
