    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The flat roof of the American House, the most spacious and
      important hotel in Black Thread Centre, Connecticut, was
      lined with sheets of red-painted tin, each embossed with
      'Phoenix, the Tin of Kings'. Though it was only 6.02, this
      July morning in 1897, the roof was scorching. The tin was
      like a flat-iron, and the tar along the brick coping, which
      had bubbled all yesterday afternoon, was stinging to the
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far below, in Putnam Street, a whole three stories down
      from the red tin roof, Tad Smith, the constable, said to
      Mr. Barstow, the furniture-dealer, 'Well, sir, going to be
      another scorcher, like yesterday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barstow thought it over. 'Don't know but what you're
      right. Regular scorcher.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yessir, a scorcher,' ruminated Tad, and went his
      ways--never again, perhaps, to appear in history.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the red tin roof above these burghers, a young poet
      was dancing; child of the skies, rejoicing in youth and
      morning and his new-found power of song. He was alone,
      except for Lancelot, the hotel dog, and unashamed he
      saluted the sun-god who was his brother. Whistling
      'There'll be a Hot Time in the Old Town To-night', he
      strode up and down, his hands swinging as though he were
      leading a military band, his feet making little intricate
      patterns, his whole body lurching, his head bobbing from
      one side to the other in the exhilaration of youth and his
      own genius. Lancelot barked in appreciation--the first,
      this, of the applause the Master was some day to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young poet was named, not very romantically, Ora
      Weagle, but he had read a good deal of Swinburne,
      Longfellow, Tennyson, and Kipling. He was fifteen years
      old, and already he perceived that he belonged to a world
      greater than Black Thread Centre. In fact, he despised
      Black Thread, and in particular all manner of things
      associated with the American House, as owned by his father,
      old Tom Weagle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recollection of the fabulous poem he had written last
      evening turned Ora's faun-like effervescence to awe, and
      (while Lancelot looked disappointed and settled down to
      scratching and slumber), he began to croon, then to murmur,
      then to shout--Ora, the young Keats, rejoicing in his
      masterpiece, aloft between Phoenix Roofing and the sky:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      'Cold are thine eyes and the flanks of the hands of
      thee,<br>
      Cold as crushed snow on Connecticut hills,<br>
      But lo! I will break and dissever the bands of thee,<br>
      Till with blown flame thee the power of me fills!<br>
      See, I am proud, I am potent and terrible,<br>
      Dust of the highway I tread in my scorn!<br>
      Thou unto me art a field that is arable,<br>
      In sun-soaring splendour thy soul shall be born!'
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      'Gee, I don't know where I get it!' he whispered. The
      booming glory exalted him, and he paraded again, tossing
      his arms and chanting:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      'Proud, I am proud,<br>
            I am<br>
                 Potent and terrible,<br>
                      Potent and terrible,<br>
      <br>
      Listen! I'm proud<br>
            And<br>
                 Potent and terrible,<br>
                      Terrible, terrible proud!'<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      And the sun-god showered him with rays which clothed him in
      double glory as they were reflected from the red tin roof.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The whistle of the 6.07 train from the Berkshires reduced
      Ora from cloud-treader, bright with morning fire, to
      kindling-splitter for the American House. Though he still
      murmured 'Potent and terrible', he was drawn to look over
      the coping at the actualities of provincial life. Up from
      the station of the New York, New Haven, and Hartford walked
      a typical, an unavoidable, a cosmic travelling salesman,
      carrying his two grips. Below Ora, abysmal depths below,
      his brother, Myron Weagle, was watering the sidewalk with a
      despicable battered green can. Ora watched this tedious
      daily comedy with amused eyes. His generosity toward Myron
      was as much a part of his poet's sovereignty as fire and
      potency and terribleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Myron! Myron had, Ora meditated, no imagination, no
      passion, no ambition, no consciousness of beauty, no desire
      to be creative or to do anything but keep busy with the
      trivial daily jobs that seemed to satisfy him. Though Myron
      was theoretically two years older--seventeen--Ora felt
      himself a generation older and more worldly. Even
      physically you could see the difference: Ora, so slim,
      quick, dark, with fine hair black like black glass; Myron,
      then tall and lumbering, with big red hands and an absurd
      natural pompadour of rope-coloured hair. Often Ora had
      thought that he himself was like a cat--sinuous, swift,
      independent; while Myron was the perfect dog, and no
      greyhound or Scottie, but a farm dog--clumsy, contemptibly
      good-natured, loyal to any insignificant master.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, the poor devil,' thought Ora, 'he'll probably be
      happier in his hick way than I will. I'm going to New York!
      I'm going to make me some perfect Work of Art! Golly, I bet
      I suffer like all get out, like in <i>Sentimental Tommy</i>
      and <i>David Copperfield,</i> while he sticks here and
      scratches himself in the sun--like you, Lancelot!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora watched his dull big brother clumping down the street
      to welcome the travelling salesman and take his bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Like a servant!' Ora sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come on, Lancelot, we gotta go down and get a little
      breakfast,' he commanded. But before Ora left the coping,
      he looked distastefully over Black Thread Centre, and found
      nothing there. From the roof of the American house,
      towering as it did a whole story above any other building
      in town, he could view the microcosm of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      (There were people, reflected Ora, to whom Black Thread
      Centre and East Black Thread made up the Hub of the
      universe, from which you measured distances to Rome and
      Shanghai and Tierra del Fuego; people to whom a train or a
      circus or a religion was important as it did or did not
      touch Black Thread. Ora marvelled at their provinciality.
      For him--oh, New York, London, Paris, Berlin, Monte Carlo!)
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded with disfavour the red-brick village; Cal
      Bigus's store--clocks, watches, jewellery, bicycles--beside
      the hotel. Barstow's furniture emporium, undertaking in all
      its branches, across the street. The frame station of the
      N.Y., N.H., and Hartford with its greasy platform. The
      village square and the grey cast-iron statue of a Civil War
      soldier. He could, it is true, see the light-flecked
      Housatonic river across the tracks, and on the other side
      of town, a hill thick with elm and maple and spruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But even so, just sort of ordinary country. Nothing
      historical. No castles. Aah! Come on, you, Lancelot!' said
      Ora.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thumbed his nose at the stolid Myron, carrying the
      travelling-man's bags, and skipped to the trap-door,
      singing, 'Potent and terrible'. He paused to muse, 'Nothing
      romantic. Not a doggone thing! What a name for a town!
      Black Thread Centre!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Thaddeus Prout, of Beulah, Connecticut, had
      Sunday after Sunday, through 1637, warned his complacent
      people that they must guard the hill-gap to the north and
      east against the Indians. 'I preach unto you eternal mercy
      and I also preach unto you eternal vigilance,' roared the
      old pastor in the high pulpit of the church. 'I preach to
      you the incessant practice of prayer . . . and the
      incessant practice of musketry, as I learned it in His
      Majesty's Own Right and Royal Worcestershires. I tell you
      that this hill-gap is a black threat . . . a black threat .
      . . a black threat to our peace and well-being!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it so often that his parishioners began jestingly
      to call the settlement north and east of them (a settlement
      of one log tavern and store, and four cabins) 'the Black
      Threat'. They jested too warmly and too soon. When the
      Indians did tiptoe through the gap and circle Beulah, the
      settlers fought with axe and rifle, led by the Reverend
      Thaddeus, with a sabre-belt round his broadcloth and his
      white beard smeared with blood, but the goodly village was
      almost wiped out. Thereafter, the settlement beyond them
      was called 'Black Threat' with more anxious reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a young government surveyor who put the name down as
      'Black Thread' in 1810, considering, in his Harvard manner,
      the probabilities of spellings and the idiocy of myths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all this Ora had never heard--nor anyone else, perhaps,
      in Black Thread Centre in 1897.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed by a subdued Lancelot, the subdued kin of the
      sun-god crept down the ladder from the roof into the hotel,
      into narrow hallways carpeted with straw matting worn in
      channels like foot-paths, into the enveloping smell of
      cheap pink soap and cabbage and sweaty clothes and old
      cotton sheets. The American House had thirty-four bedrooms;
      twenty-nine singles and five doubles. It was, the Weagles
      considered, a vigorously modern hotel; it had gas instead
      of kerosene lamps; and in the office was a telephone, in a
      long dark box like an up-ended coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the single rooms--Ora could see them as he passed
      open doors--contained one wooden bed, the varnish a little
      cracked, one straight chair, one strip of carpet beside the
      bed, lace curtains, very dingy, a gas light in so crafty a
      position on the wall that it neither illuminated the mirror
      nor enabled the guest to read in bed, one wash-stand with
      pitcher and bowl, painted with lilacs or a snow scene, a
      slop jar standing on a strip of linoleum not very
      successfully imitating marble, with white oilcloth tacked
      on the wall behind it, one cake of streaky soap, one thin
      towel, and a concentration of the prevailing smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the double rooms were more elaborate. They added an
      extra towel, an extra straight chair, a table, and usually
      a calendar on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mattresses on the beds were lumpy and sagging in the
      middle. The sheets were coarse, scratchy cotton--though,
      with Edna Weagle, Mrs. Tom Weagle, as housekeeper, they
      were immaculate and free of the bedbug. Edna spoke often
      and bitterly of bedbugs and pursued them daily. The
      blankets were of cotton and the comforters filled with
      cotton batting. They were very heavy and not warm. On
      winter nights, experienced travelling salesmen laid their
      overcoats on top them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he was so used to the hotel, his home these years,
      that he rarely saw it, to-day Ora was so heightened by
      poetic triumph that for ten seconds he did stop to look
      into No. 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a hole!' he sighed. 'Sometime I'll have a room with a
      great big leather chair and a bed with silk sheets! Maybe
      black!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too Black Thread Centre, too 1897, to admit that he
      was considering how voluptuous his slimness, the fine
      whiteness of his body, would seem against black silk
      sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall he met Flossy Gitts, the second maid. Now Ora
      was fifteen and Flossy was twenty, but she was generous and
      without prejudice: she had ringlets and what was then known
      as a bust; she dallied happily with any male from the age
      of ten to one hundred, though she preferred a ripe
      travelling-man of thirty-five, who wore a Masonic ring and
      was willing to hire a livery stable rig to give a girl a
      good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say, lissen, Ora, Myron is sore as a boil you ain't
      cleaned the basement and the sample-rooms!' said Flossy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The hell with him!' said Ora.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yeh, but what he'll do to you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Aw, give us a kiss!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You behave yourself now! Oh! Why, Ora Weagle, you oughta
      be ashamed yourself, acting like that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am potent and terrible!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gee, I bet you swallowed the dictionary--all them words!
      Lissen, Ora, I'll help you clean the basement, soon's I do
      No. 23 and 15.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right, sweetie!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora swaggered down to the 'office'. He did swagger. For all
      his conquests among the village girls of his own age, this
      was his first triumph as a gigolo, a young gallant cajoling
      an older woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls of the office were lined with cane rockers
      alternating with brass spittoons. The desk was of grained
      pine. Back of it hung the room-keys, attached to chunks of
      wood so that they might not be carried off, and on it were
      a pen stuck in a potato, and a register swung on a brass
      swivel. The register was always open, of course, for
      hotel-men of that period knew nothing else so certainly as
      that, if the register was ever closed, you would get no
      more business that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora was relieved not to see Myron. Perhaps, after carrying
      the travelling-man's grips to his room, he had hustled out
      for early-morning shopping--old Tom was supposed to do all
      the buying, but he often slept late, almost till seven, and
      Myron was simpleton enough to be willing to run out for an
      extra pound of bacon in case of a breakfast rush. Ora felt
      free again. He slipped through the dining-room and
      billiard-room to the bar. If Jock McCreedy, the regular
      bartender, was on, he would be able to coax a tiny glass of
      beer before breakfast. But when Ora opened the door into
      that haven, with its cool smell of beer, magnificent
      mahogany bar, delicate pyramids of glassware, and that
      greatest painting Ora had ever seen--a nude lady lying
      among cushions scarlet and saffron and emerald--he
      hesitated, for it was Myron who stood behind the bar, with
      an ebony slicer removing the excess foam from a glass of
      beer for the first morning customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hey, you, come here!' thundered Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's eating you?' whimpered the sun-god's heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      He edged in, irritably facing Myron's sergeant-major eye.
      Seen close, Myron's tow-coloured exuberance of hair was
      stiff, as though his scalp had some extra vitality. His
      strong skin was of the Norse snow-fed pallor that no sun
      ever tanned, no adolescence ever blotched. Myron had, Ora
      sometimes admitted, a certain broad-shouldered power and
      health in him--if he could only have Ora's imagination,
      instead of being a mere human broom standing up-ended!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ora! You haven't swept the balconies for two days! You
      didn't have any kindling, when I started the range this
      morning, and the wood-box about half full! And the
      basement--here's a travelling-man just come in this
      morning; wants a sample-room right away, and both of 'em
      dirty!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling safe, across the bar, Ora jeered, 'What're you
      going to do about it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the air flew a tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had stepped on a beer keg and vaulted the bar. He was
      shaking Ora like a kitten. 'I'll whale the everlasting
      daylights out of you, that's what I'll do! I'm sick and
      tired of your loafing! The only person around this hotel
      that never does any work! Do you clean the sample-rooms and
      so on and so forth right now, or do I lick you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right! All right! Gosh! Gee whiz! You don't have to
      act like a hyena!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'With you, I do! Now git! I'll let you have breakfast
      first, and then . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora, already at the door, popped his small head in to
      retort, 'You'll let me have breakfast! It ain't yours to
      let! I guess it belongs to Pa and Ma!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But he retreated with speed. He knew these 'lickings' by
      Myron: rare but extraordinarily painful and lasting.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Alice Aggerty, the bulky colleague of Flossy Gitts, was
      serving breakfast. Standing between two travelling-men she
      was chanting: 'Omeal, choicaveggs, baconam, steakchops,
      sausage, wheacakes.' Ora himself breakfasted poetically on
      oatmeal, pork chop with an egg, wheat cakes, bacon, coffee,
      and just a nibble or two of johnny-cake, and toast smeared
      with plum jam. The coffee was weak, with grounds floating
      on it. The butter was artificially coloured and, as it had
      come out of a tub preserved with salt, there were salt
      crystals apparent on the brilliantly yellow pat. With the
      chop, which had been fried in lard, there were last night's
      potatoes, warmed up. If Ora's delicacy and vision were
      offended by this coarse plenty, there were no signs of it
      as he wolfed it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate at the family table, behind the two long ones for
      the public. The dining-room had green wall-paper with
      yellow roses, bare floor and, for splendour, an enormous
      black walnut buffet adorned with silver cruet stands and
      fruit-and-nut bowls of imitation cut-glass--thriftily empty
      save at Sunday noon. Beside the double door, on a small
      table with a decorous white linen cover, was a large bowl
      of toothpicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloths of the long tables were clean, but that of the
      Weagle family table was somewhat geographic, with its
      islands of egg yolk, catsup, gravy, and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Ora was breakfasting, his father joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Weagle had a corded brown neck which his watery beard
      did not quite conceal. He wore steel-rimmed spectacles,
      crookedly, and behind them his expression was wistful and
      rather vague. His nose was red. Though he seemed frail, he
      had the leathery hands of a farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Morning,' said old Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Morning,' said Ora.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you sweep the basement, like you was told?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      That seemed to cover the subject. Tom, after ordering
      oatmeal, steak, fried eggs, and a double order of
      wheats--all of which would vanish without evident effect
      into his meagre corporation--was silent. He was long-winded
      enough with travelling-men, in the narration of anecdotes
      about old days on the farm, the wickedness of guests who
      did not pay, servants who did not work, and the wonders of
      his one trip to New York, but with his family he saw no
      gain in wasting wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      They chewed opposite each other, Tom looking vague, Ora
      looking sleepy. But Ora was meditating like a quiescent
      volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      That big brute, Myron. . . . Didn't know any way of trying
      to deal with a slick brain like his brother's except by
      threatening to lick him! . . . And such stinking
      melodrama--vaulting the bar, like that big, fat, ridic'lous
      hero in the melodrama that played here under canvas last
      week, 'Barry O'Leary's Own Company in <i>Bonnets o'
      Dundee'.</i> Myron wouldn't even know the meaning of the
      word melodrama! Huh! Yuh! Sure! No brains, no education!
      Could Myron make a line like 'Till with blown flame thee
      the power of me fills'?
    </p>
    <p>
      He could <i>not!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora felt better, much better.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was damped a little by the spectacle of a fat, moist
      forefinger beckoning from the door to the kitchen (the
      white paint of the door was worn in a blotch halfway up by
      the hips of urgent waitresses pushing out with trays of
      dirty dishes). It was the finger of a lady who had the
      honour of being not only cook of the American House but
      also mother of Ora Weagle--Edna Weagle, who combined the
      seemly plumpness of a cook with the worried intensity of
      the wife of a drunkard. Ora slowly forsook blown flame and
      potency and terror; he scooped up the last sweetness of
      syrup and crumbs of wheat cake with a spoon, while Alice
      Aggerty, the waitress, scowled at him. To think of that
      darn' boy using up a whole spoon, and it would have to be
      washed now, for just one mouthful!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora sauntered gracefully into the heat and the smell of
      frying grease in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you want, Ma?' he complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your Pa has got to drive over to Beulah this morning,
      about some chickens, and we're short of lard, and I want
      you should go to Aldgate's sometime this morning and get a
      pail of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gosh, I gotta do everything around this hotel--clean the
      basement and sweep the balconies and fill the wood-box and
      everything!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, it's too bad about you!' Edna Weagle scoffed, and
      wiped her hands on the not very clean apron round the
      plumpness of her gingham-covered middle. 'I've only been
      working since five! You get that lard, or I'll have Myron .
      . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Myron! Myron! Myron! Ain't I ever going to hear anything
      all my life but Myron! Me highest stand in the whole
      Soph'more Class, and him way down near the foot in the
      Senior!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, baby, I know. Yes. I guess that's right. Maybe you
      ain't suited to this kind of work, like Myron is. I do
      believe and hope that some day you'll be a dentist or a
      lawyer or even a preacher! There.' She stroked his
      hair--which Ora hated, because she smelled of soft yellow
      soap and doughnut fat. 'You just go ahead reading and
      studying and all. But you won't forget my lard, will you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sure not!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognized for the pundit he was, Ora swaggered upstairs,
      to find the fair, fond Flossy Gitts and to persuade her to
      help him sweep the inevitable basement. She grumbled a
      little at having to leave a bed half made, but she came,
      and the sample-rooms and the furnace-room were cleaned and
      made beautiful. It was a satisfactory division of labour:
      Ora talked and Flossy worked. She swept, dusted, and nailed
      down a loose board on one of the long tables which, set
      across trestles in the sample-room, would presently bloom
      in un-Black-Thread-like splendours of the Orient; with silk
      Scotch plaid blouses, Eleganto brand leather belts in two
      colours, dainty Dot veils, gauntlet gloves; in fact, with
      all the choicest wares of M. &amp; I. Vollschutz's Ladies
      Wear Company of New York, Cincinnati, and Kansas City, for
      the inspection of the ardent merchants of Black Thread
      Centre--this modern Oriental market, where the vendors did
      not squat about fires of camels' dung, but in check suits,
      smoking cigars, standing upright with the freedom and
      efficiency of 1897 in America, chose beauty with an eye to
      profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You've done it pretty good, Flossy. Come 'ere and kiss
      me!' said Ora. 'Bye! See you later!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her--somewhat perplexed, as later many ladies were
      to be, as to whether she had done too much or too
      little--and galloping up the stairs he swung through the
      alley behind the American House to Putnam Street,
      slinkingly followed by Lancelot. He had a moment's shudder
      at the greasy garbage in the alley, the debris of hotels
      and the whole frowziness of communal living, but he forgot
      it in the clean hot sun of the street, and Lancelot, again
      convinced that he was the dog of a sun-god and not the dog
      of an hotel, chased an imaginary cat and after it barked
      'Potent and terrible'.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be stated that Lancelot was so named only by Ora.
      To the rest of the hotel personnel he was 'Spot' or merely,
      'Get out of that'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not once, all day, did Ora remember the lard for his
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all! There was a story, once much read, about Mary
      and Martha. And it was Ora's vacation time, it was summer,
      and beyond Black Thread Centre, up on Elm Hill, there were
      things more worth the inquiry of a young poet than lard and
      the state of a sample-room for the travelling
      representative of M. &amp; I. Vollschutz.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c02" id="c02">2</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Up to the little groves and hollows, to the peace and
      freedom of Elm Hill, pounded a young poet and his dog. But
      they stopped a moment at the garden of the man who had
      taught Ora that much existed in this world besides the
      lilies and Sunday-morning languors, the roses and strictly
      respectable raptures of Connecticut. This was the Reverend
      Waldo Ivy, the Episcopal pastor. Despite his name, Mr. Ivy
      was round, red, and breathless. He loved liturgy,
      tradition, cleanliness, and poetry. Black Thread thought
      him 'queer'. In ten years in this church he had found
      precisely one soul who understood his gospel, that beauty
      is truth, truth beauty, and that was Ora Weagle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved to be called, and never save by one was called,
      'Padre'. Again that one was Ora. Ora had probably got it
      from Kipling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taught Ora everything he knew--provided Ora did know
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      In High School, in which he was to be a Junior, this coming
      Fall, Ora had learned that the ways and finalities of
      literature are thus: In the far past--ever so long ago,
      even before the American Revolution--there were good
      writers. Quite good. There was a gentleman named Caesar,
      who went to England and Americanized the natives. There was
      Cicero, who objected to a man named Cataline, and so killed
      all gangsterdom for ever. There was Virgil, who was somehow
      very beautiful. And--though these were actually read only
      in swell schools like Andover--there were Greeks, like
      Homer and Sophocles and Aeschylus, who were pretty
      important. Then the history of literature skipped a long
      while--two hundred or maybe two thousand years--and you
      came to Jane Austen, Dickens, Thackeray, Scott, Tennyson,
      Longfellow, Whittier, Walt Whitman, and Poe. These authors
      were all dead. In fact the Age of Literature was dead, like
      the Age of Chivalry, though there were some pretty good
      hack writers living now--William Dean Howells and Mark
      Twain and a Frenchman named Anatole France. But the
      Reverend Waldo Ivy had told Ora that literature was only
      beginning; that the world's struggle for beauty and justice
      had never been so glorious as now. The boy's eyes
      lightened, his breathing grew rapid, as Mr. Ivy testified
      to his gospel. And in that little Episcopal study, smelling
      of the leather bindings of old Greek books and the buckram
      of new novels, Mr. Ivy at last trusted one disciple, and
      read to him:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble,<br>
          Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink,<br>
      Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble<br>
          The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink,<br>
      Here now in his triumphs where all things falter,<br>
          Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand
      spread,<br>
      As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,<br>
                          Death lies dead.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a little study, Mr. Ivy's, just behind the
      church; a plaster room, looking on a garden seven feet
      square, with a cement walk which he called his ambulatory.
      There were stiff crocuses and timid pansies in the garden.
      On the walls of the study were pictures of S. Paulo Fouri
      le Muri, of Thoreau and Emerson. The priest, after he had
      read Swinburne, looked at Ora diffidently and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is a greater poetry than all of this. It's from the
      Bible. I wonder if you know it. You see, my dear boy, the
      Fathers of my Church knew, so long ago, all that afflicts
      us now. Would you like to hear it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure!' said Ora.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is perhaps the greatest poetry that has ever been
      written. Listen, my son:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be
      broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the
      wheel broken at the cistern.<br>
      <br>
      "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
      spirit shall return unto God who gave it.<br>
      <br>
      "Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity."'
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ivy looked up, over the eyeglasses that creased his red
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I didn't know,' he sobbed, 'that the Bible was poetry! I
      thought it was nothing but religion!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But that had been two years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      This July morning, when Ora condescendingly nodded to Mr.
      Ivy, over the fence, he was not awed. For he himself was a
      poet now, with no need for reverence for the old stiffs
      that were his rivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ora,' said Mr. Ivy, 'do you know the Wordsworth sonnet
      that begins, "The world is too much with us--late and
      soon"?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure. It's swell. Well, gotta be hustling on,' said Ora.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know the sonnet, but then--it was morning, and
      vacation, and he lurched on, followed by a lurching
      Lancelot.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      As it was called 'Elm Hill', naturally it was covered
      mostly with spruce and pine. There was a secret hollow
      which, Ora felt, no one save himself had ever discovered.
      He lay in its hot, resinous sweetness, while Lancelot
      panted and coughed and scratched beside him. He
      dreamed--the formless, visual dreams of a young poet:
      Castles. Girls milk-white. In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a
      stately pleasure-dome decree. Sleek greyhounds with silver
      bells. God through unending aeons drowsing on his throne of
      sharp-cut granite. Swords slender as pain. California and
      sunlight intolerable upon yellow poppies. Wings of the
      albatross. Wild white horses galloping through the desert,
      beneath an orange mesa. An archbishop chanting mass, in
      vestments stiff with gold. A starving explorer staggering
      into a Tibetan village. An English cottage among roses. An
      air-ship--only there could never be any air-ships, of
      course!--flashing through the empyrean at sixty miles an
      hour. . . . Empyrean! What a lovely word! Myron wouldn't
      know a word like 'empyrean'!
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw Osirian Egypt kneel adown before the vine-wreath
      crown. Yea, with red sin the faces of them shine; but in
      all these there was no sin like mine. In the highlands, in
      the country places, where the old plain men have rosy
      faces, and the young fair maidens quiet eyes. The Courts
      where Tamshyd gloried and drank deep. A woman wailing for
      her demon lover. Set forth in something, something mail, to
      search in all lands for the Holy Grail. Delectable. Faerie.
      Clad in white samite, mystic, wonderful. Glamour. Casting
      down their golden crowns around the glassy sea. The owl for
      all his feathers was acold. Lances, lances dipped in light.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, dear God, if I could only <i>do</i> it!' whimpered
      Ora.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Like most healthy young animals, Ora was perpetually
      hungry. Yet rather than go back to the horrors of the
      American House, to his mother nagging, his father nagging,
      Myron nagging, and Alice Aggerty or Flossy Gitts intoning,
      'Oysstew, creamtomato, steak, chop, Irish stew, roaspork,
      vegables,' he lunched on a corn pone which he had
      thoughtfully stolen from the kitchen while talking to his
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What nahm de ploom will I use?' he inquired of Lancelot.
      'Golly! A writer can't be called Ora Weagle!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thunder cracked, lightning vaulted, and inexplicably out of
      the unknown came his nahm de ploom, Marcel Lenoir!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Jiminy, what a peach!' murmured Ora. 'I just don't know
      how I do it! <i>Marcel Lenoir!</i> What a beaut! Hey, you,
      Lancelot! Hear that! Marcel Lenoir!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in a fragrant piney hollow, was born a poet-hero:
      Marcel Lenoir.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Pete Breyette, who was the reportorial staff of the
      <i>Black Thread Centre Star and Tidings</i> had just
      finished an important story,
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Mrs. Trumbull Lambkin last Thursday entertained the Epworth
      League. Coffee, doughnuts, and ice-cream were served, the
      Reverend Swan gave a brief prayer, and a good time was
      reported by all.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Pete leaned back, pocketing his pencil, and sighed with
      contentment. He looked down at the yellow copy-paper. There
      it was, complete literature, the crude fact immortalized.
      But he sprang up, all pride in his style oozing away, for
      through the wide window of the one-story <i>Star and
      Tidings</i> building Ora Weagle was staring. Now Pete was a
      man of eighteen, and Ora but fifteen, yet Pete knew that,
      seasoned journalist though he was, competent to cover the
      G.A.R. parade or even the County Fair, Ora had a genius
      beyond him. He beckoned, and Ora came in, murmuring,
      'Marcel Lenoir!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Huh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Marcel Lenoir. My pen-name. Like it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gee--yes--that's swell. Something <i>like</i> a name.
      Lissen, Ora, what d'you plan to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whaddha I plan to do? Whaddha you mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'About your literary career.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! Well, I'll tell you.' Ora sat down, tilted his chair,
      and put his heels on the desk like Pete at his best. He
      accepted a Sweet Caporal cigarette and smoked it in the
      manliest fashion, coughing only a little. 'I'll tell you.
      It's like this. First, I'm going to be a reporter. Of
      course you got to be a reporter before you can become an
      author--any reporter will tell you that. I guess I'll be on
      the <i>New York Sun,</i> but I won't be ready to accept a
      position there for two-three years; think I ought to have a
      little more schooling first. Then I'll wander--anywhere
      outside this doggone ole town! I think maybe I'll accompany
      an exploring party to Africa or like that. Then I'll get a
      job as secretary to some big author--say like Mark Twain. I
      guess he'd be pretty glad to have a secretary that was a
      literary fellow himself! And educated. Then I'll be ready
      to write. First I'll do poetry. But what I want to head for
      is big novels. I expect I'll be the Dickens of America.
      Golly! With a big house and a swell pair of trotters and
      six-seven suits of clothes! That's how I plan it. Course I
      may change my mind. I might go out and own a big ranch in
      the West for a while, instead of Africa. But time enough t'
      decide that later.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You certainly got ambition, Ora. I shouldn't wonder if you
      might do all that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, certainly I will! Whaddha you think!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, why don't you get out of this hick town now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, it's my hayseed brother. He makes me stick here in
      school, when I already know a whale of a lot more than the
      teachers, only they can look at the book while you're
      reciting and catch you on dates. God, Pete, you don't know
      what I suffer from Myron, the big bully! He hasn't got
      brains enough to hate working in an hotel! Hotel-keeping!
      What a business! Havin' to be nice to drunk guests! Smell
      of cooking! Making beds all morning! What a job! And he
      doesn't even beef about it. Myron's got no imagination, no
      pride, no sense of beauty, you might say. He just naturally
      couldn't never understand how a real artist feels, never!'

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron Weagle was seven years old when his father sold their
      rocky and isolated farm north of Beulah and moved to Black
      Thread Centre, with a notion of having ease and fortune in
      this metropolis of 1600 people. The father, Tom Weagle, was
      complacently certain that he could succeed as livery-stable
      keeper, grocer, undertaker, electric and herbal healer, or
      in any other of a dozen arts, but he chose keepin' hotel
      because his good wife, Edna, was a renowned cook. Her
      doughnuts and lemon meringue pie were without rivals in
      Beulah County, and at the Laurel Grove Congregational
      church-suppers, her scalloped potatoes and devil's-food
      cake roused even more exclamations than Mrs. Lyman
      Barstow's potato salad and sweet-pickle relish. She was
      also, Tom considered, a great hand at keeping bedrooms
      clean, though she was rather sluttish about her own neck
      and nails and hair, and her aprons were always smeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not, at first, enter the glories of keeping the
      American House, with its thirty-four bedrooms. They began
      in an eight-bedroom boarding-house, in the old Tatam
      Mansion, and within a month, Mother Weagle's troubles had
      started. Tom had always had a nose for apple-jack and now,
      with nothing much to do and twenty-four choreless hours a
      day to do it in, he had the leisure, along with money from
      the farm, to soak diligently. He had always resented the
      seclusion of the farm he had inherited from his father and
      had placidly let run down; he had resented having so few
      neighbours to whom he could boast of his ability to make a
      million dollars. Now, Tom sat in the back of Earle Peter's
      grocery, guzzling apple-jack, or with unshaven cronies and
      a jug of white mule, he rowed down to the Island, to fish,
      and crawled home in the evening with his jaw hanging and
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Weagle whisked him out of sight of the boarders and,
      after trying to do her duty in the way of scolding him--but
      she never could really scold anyone--she let him sleep it
      off. When they first took the boarding-house, Tom found
      plenty of little busynesses--nailing up shelves, laying a
      cement walk, which immediately cracked. But as he gradually
      found himself free for urbanity and apple-jack, he did
      nothing whatever, save carve at table when, if ever, he was
      sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Myron became, before he was ten, the Man of the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Weagle liked Myron and Ora equally; Tom preferred
      Ora who, even at the age of five, when they first came to
      Black Thread, regarded his father as an exciting character.
      When he was seven, Ora would sit in the flat unpainted punt
      which Tom had moored in the shadow of willows that leaned
      over to lap the water, and gape and bounce while Tom held
      his long bamboo fishing-rod over the side, took occasional
      pulls at the jug (leaning it on his shoulder and deftly
      tilting it up), and told endless stories--some of them
      almost true: How he had killed the last bear found in the
      state of Connecticut. How, as a young man, he had gone
      clear out to Michigan and seen Indians who, it seemed,
      always said, 'Ugh, me heap big Injun'. How, as a boy of
      thirteen at the end of the Civil War, he had seen the last
      Connecticut troops march out, and they were all six feet
      tall and very valiant, and most of the officers ran about
      six-foot-six and carried swords four feet long. And he
      would sing:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      'Oh, bury me not on the lone pe-rar-ie,<br>
      Where the wyuld cooooooyotes will howl over me<br>
      Where the rattlesnakes hiss, and the wyund blows free,<br>
      Oh, bury me not on the lone pe-rar-ie!'
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Ora leaned forward, transported from boarding-house
      kitchens and greasy school desks to a realm of soldiers and
      cow-punchers and lone mountains. And as much as his father
      he resented it when they returned to the monkey-like
      scolding of Mother Weagle and the scowls of Myron. They
      both suspected, as they sneaked in to their late supper of
      hash and coffee, that while they had been gone, gallantly
      trying to help the struggling household by catching fish,
      Myron had dined on the fat of the land--the thickest
      steaks, the hottest clam chowder, and three helpings of
      butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he was eleven, Myron had been trained in
      housework--'just like a doggone girl', Ora snivelled, when
      he had been particularly slapped. Myron wiped dishes, he
      sometimes washed them; the big lummox could shine a
      water-glass better than his mother, and his large hands
      were firm in handling a fruit-dish. He swept, he made beds,
      he fried or boiled the eggs, he could cook a chop. He
      learned from his mother's anxious whisperings to cajole an
      irritated guest by listening rapturously to any complaint
      and bubbling, 'I'll get Ma to fix it up right away quick'.
      He even learned, watching his mother, a little about cuts
      of meat, and how to tell a ripe melon or a sound pear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he learned more from a certain boarder than from his
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The star boarder was Miss Absolom, the elegant New York
      lady who taught in the high school. In the dining-room,
      Myron watched Miss Absolom, while he helped Minnie, the
      hired girl, wait at table. Feeling that, as a farm boy, he
      ought to learn table-manners, he spied on all the ten
      boarders. He noted that Horace Tiger, of the New York Dry
      Goods Store, had a strikingly refined way of drinking
      coffee: when he raised his cup his little finger stuck out
      as though it detached itself from the coarseness of mere
      guzzling. Miss Abbott, the milliner, picked her teeth
      behind an ample napkin held up before her face. It was
      evident to a waiter, standing behind her, that she did a
      great deal of struggling and gouging, but he was edified by
      her modesty. And contrariwise he was certain that, though
      they had always done it on the farm, it was not nice in old
      Mr. and Mrs. Glenn to blow loudly on their soup and,
      drinking coffee, to leave the spoon in the cup and anchor
      it with a clutching thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Absolom never seemed to have any manners, good or
      bad. He never could remember just what she had done. On the
      infrequent occasions when she did use a toothpick, she just
      used it, without orgies of delicacy. She did not make much
      of laying her knife and fork across her plate when she was
      finished; the others were very clattering and exacting
      about it, but somehow her knife and fork were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gosh, she's so <i>easy</i> about things!' meditated Myron,
      as he polished the heavy plated cruet-stand with its
      bottles of catsup, vinegar, pepper sauce, and
      Worcestershire. 'I wonder if that's how you ought to
      do--so's people don't notice how swell your manners are?'
      It was a profound and disturbing theory. Not get any credit
      for being refined? What was the use, then? Well, he'd have
      to do it. He'd rather be like Miss Absolom, thin, dark,
      resolute, straight-backed, than like the plump and puffing
      Horace Tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was taking a cup of tea to Miss Absolom on an evening
      when she had what was then known as a 'headache' and had
      not come down to supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come in; talk to me,' she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the tradition of exotic New York ladies
      marooned in small towns in 1891, the room should have been
      voluptuous with Turkish hangings, a samovar, and Chinese
      lanterns--such lanterns as glorified a strawberry festival
      on a Black Thread lawn. Actually, there were none of these
      Oriental splendours. But the pine table was covered a foot
      deep with books; beside it was a chintz-covered chair; and
      covering the bed was a Chinese rug. (That was funny, Myron
      always thought--a rug on a bed! But it did look kind of
      nice; made the white iron bedstead seem kind of less
      ornery.) Otherwise the room was of the same clean, bare,
      plaster-and-matting simplicity as the rest of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Absolom was in the deep chair. 'Sit down!' She waved
      to the bed, and he teetered there, embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a boy in the sixth grade to talk privily with a teacher
      way up in the high school was for a private to be chummy
      with a major-general. But at the age of eleven he was,
      after four years of being right-hand man in a
      boarding-house, uncannily acquainted with human beings and
      their loves, their secret whisky bottles, their dirty
      tricks in the matter of weekly bills, generosities to one
      another regarding hot-water bottles and store candy. He
      was, in fact, as sharply aware of human ways as any normal
      boy of eleven would be if he were not squelched by the
      jealous demand of parents and teachers that they be allowed
      to do all the talking and deciding. Yet for all this
      premature knowledge, he was embarrassed when he met Miss
      Absolom not as a boarder, to be bedded, boarded and billed,
      but as a social acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sit down, Myron. Like keeping a boarding-house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I guess I like it all right. I guess so. Gee, I bet
      sometimes <i>you</i> don't like it much in a little place
      like this, after New York!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not so bad. Escape from too much Hebraic Bach and Hebraic
      Kaffeeklatsch and Hebraic cousinry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hunh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I mean . . . don't mind it. I'm just trying to be funny.
      And gallant, or something nasty like that. It doesn't mean
      anything. Myron! What are you going to do with yourself?
      You work hard, I've noticed. What's your ambition?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I dunno. I guess maybe a doctor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I dunno. I guess it would be kind of interesting, taking
      care of people . . . I mean . . . learnin' all about them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You want to get away from here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I guess so. I never thought about it much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, my child, whether you go or stay, you must learn to
      make a little better effect. I mean, be more careful about
      how you dress. I don't mean like Horace Tiger, with his
      silly white vests and his hair that smells like a
      barber-shop. . . . You'll be a big, impressive man, some
      day. You may as well take advantage of it by dressing well.
      Let me see your nails.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He exhibited them, shyly. They were, within reason, clean,
      but they had been hacked short with his mother's larger
      shears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you think mine look a little neater?' demanded Miss
      Absolom. Her almond-shaped nails were probably nothing
      extraordinary but to Myron they seemed exquisite, sleek as
      polished agate. 'You can get a nail-file for ten cents at
      the drug-store. File 'em, my child, file 'em. Now let me do
      your tie. You've just jerked it together.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She patiently unknotted and re-did his slightly frayed blue
      bow, patting the ends. He leaned over, faint with her warm
      feminine scent. 'Now look in the mirror.' He marvelled at
      the cockiness of his tie. It had, now, a waist and
      symmetrical ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll sure work on it!' he said fervently. 'Ora always can
      tie his good, and him only nine! But he won't work.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And listen, young man. I've been observing you. You bully
      Ora, to make him work. I don't blame you. He's a lazy
      little hound. But a solemn young man like you, earnest
      about all good works, must watch himself in a thing even
      more fundamentally spiritual than nail-filing. You must
      wrestle with the Lord and try, a little, to keep from being
      a prig. Tall, clean, earnest young gentlemen have a
      tendency that way . . . as do intellectual Jew girls!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gee!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A prig is a person who . . . well, you see . . . of course
      when it comes to defining. . . . Well, a prig is a person
      who thinks he's marvellous, and lets everybody see it. He's
      . . . oh, he's like a man in a wagon who keeps jeering at
      all the people on foot, "Look at me! I'm riding!" Even when
      you're riding, and Ora is snaking along in the moral dust,
      don't feel too proud. The horse may run away!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I . . . guess . . . maybe . . . I . . . see . . . how . .
      . you . . . mean!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Miss Absolom obvious that he did not. But he
      did.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It is one of life's ironies that the suggestion of a
      passer-by--a man met on a train, the unknown author of an
      editorial, an actor repeating a pure and pompous sentiment
      in a melodrama--may be weightier than years of boring
      advice by parents. Myron, when he became a man and would
      normally have been too absorbed in affairs to think about
      clothes, years after he had forgotten Miss Absolom's name,
      remembered her rebuke of his carelessness and uneasily,
      unwillingly, was forced to dress the part of a successful
      urbanite, which, in despite of Carlyle, had an excellent
      effect on his self-respect and power to command men. He
      came to believe that Miss Absolom and he had talked many
      times, many hours. They had not. She was a goddess in his
      private mythology, with the indestructible sway of a
      goddess, immortal because she had never existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether she also cured him of potential priggishness cannot
      be said. Probably, like other 'successes', Myron was
      priggish. Nor is it certain that the enjoyment of
      priggishness is not one of the most innocent and wholesome
      of pleasures, as seen in the careers of most bishops,
      editors, sergeants major, instructors in athletics, and
      Socialist authors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Myron took twenty-five cents out of the two
      dollars and sixty-five that were his savings and bought a
      red tie, which he wore to Sunday School. It was violently
      red, and Myron considered it very choice. Also, he had
      filed his nails to the quick. They hurt considerably. But
      Miss Absolom did not even notice him. He whimpered, but he
      was the more determined to impress her; to impress all the
      shrewd, cynical Miss Absoloms in the world, and make them
      recognize him as one of them.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday evenings, Mother Weagle's guests in the
      boarding-house always had a party, with a climax of welsh
      rabbit or scrambled eggs or ice-cream, in the small, square
      parlour with its worn red carpet and lavishly nickled
      Garland stove. There was a forlorn palm in one corner, and
      among the seats were the last of the horsehair sofas, a
      patent rocker upholstered in Brussels carpet, and an
      interesting chair made by cutting a segment out of a barrel
      and gilding the remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally Miss Absolom played things she called 'Mozart'
      and 'Mendelssohn', names which Myron had never heard, but
      Horace Tiger was the chief entertainer. He could play on a
      saw, and did. He sang 'Oh my name is Samuel Hall, damn your
      eyes', only he was refined enough to render it 'darn your
      eyes', and 'Daisy, Daisy give me your answer true; you'll
      look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two', and,
      invariably:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      'There is a boarding house<br>
      Not far away,<br>
      Where they have ham and eggs<br>
           Three times a day.<br>
      <br>
      'Oh how the boarders yell<br>
      When they hear that dinner-bell,<br>
      See how they run like--thunder,<br>
           Three times a day.'
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      All the boarders laughed like anything when Horace
      hesitated and winked at them, and put in 'thunder' instead
      of the naughty word. So did Myron--after looking at Miss
      Absolom, to see if she smiled, which she always did. But
      Mother Weagle invariably fretted (fifty-two Saturday
      evenings a year), 'Now I don't think that's real nice! I'm
      sure you don't get ham and eggs three times a day here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And Horace did imitations: a negro preacher, very
      realistic, beginning a sermon with 'Ah absquatulates to
      guess,' which made every one feel very happy and superior
      to the lower races; and a Maine farmer whose remarks
      pleasantly started off, 'Well, by heckalorum, Cy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Absolom always encouraged Horace, extensively; she sat
      with her chin in her thin dark hand, twinkling her eyes at
      him and murmuring, 'Bravissimo'. It did not occur to Myron
      till months after his session with her in the matter of
      nails that she was too encouraging to Horace. He was
      embarrassed after that by Horace's smirking parade, and
      with the inarticulate brooding of a boy of twelve he
      fretted that he must protect himself; not give people a
      chance to ridicule him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought thus none the less when the child prodigy, Ora,
      was persuaded to speak that elevating piece, 'The Wreck of
      the Hesperus'. Myron gloated that his brother was a
      natural-born wonder, recited just like a regular actor, and
      him only ten! But he did kinda wish, he sighed, that Ora
      wouldn't wave his arms and pat his stomach in moments of
      eloquence, as though he had an ache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron learned much from the Saturday evening parties. He
      learned that people have to be 'amused'; that they would do
      almost anything, listen to almost anything, rather than sit
      alone and read, and as for sitting alone and meditating,
      that could be tolerated only by the dullest-eyed clods or
      the calmest-eyed sages. He did not, as yet, formulate this
      for himself, any more than the fisher-boy formulates the
      tricks of steering through surf, but he began to perceive
      that if he ever had to care for a number of people, he must
      keep the childish brutes 'amused'. Bread and circuses,
      sleigh-rides and church-suppers, radios and talkies, opera
      and the horse-show--in any era, in any caste, anything to
      keep from beginning to doubt your complacent superiority by
      being alone.

    </p>
    <p>
      With a hoarse secrecy rare to her, for generally she bawled
      and chuckled her thoughts all over the kitchen, while she
      stirred biscuit dough or whisked the whites of eggs, Mother
      Weagle summoned Myron to the room she shared with her
      husband. Tom was away for the afternoon, theoretically
      hunting quail. She had, after a quarrel in which she had
      threatened to leave him, taken control of all their money,
      and she let Tom have only a dollar a week, but on that he
      managed mysteriously to get drunk with frequency and
      ardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron suspected that his father stole food from the kitchen
      and sold it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was a month short of thirteen, now, five feet seven
      and skinny, but with a sign of big bones to make broad
      shoulders. He did not smile much. His hands were rough from
      incessant housework. To his mother, at least, he was always
      affectionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat on the edge of her bed; she fluttered with
      large-bosomed sighing, while he watched her anxiously. Her
      room was dusty, the bed was unmade, with a swirl of
      bedclothes from Tom's nightly threshing when he came out of
      the stupor of alcohol. On the floor was the last week's
      laundry, half open, a clean sheet dragging in the dirt. It
      was the only room in the house besides his own and Ora's
      that was unkempt: Mother Weagle had no time for herself or
      her own resting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Myron, you're awful young to talk to you about it, but I
      ain't got anybody else. You know how your Pa is. Well, I
      been thinking all this past year, and I got kind of a
      notion he wouldn't act up this way if he had something more
      to do. Ain't hardly anything for him to do round here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I could let him help me make beds and saw the wood, if he
      wanted to,' said Myron, not trying to be funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I guess he wouldn't care for that. He'd like to be
      at the desk, showing off. The fellow that's running the
      American House is going West. It's for rent, furniture and
      all. I been kind of saving, and I could manage the rent for
      two years. Then your Pa could be in the front office, and
      maybe he'd straighten up. What do you think?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That would be something elegant!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Within Myron's eyes was a vision of the splendour of the
      American House: the long spaces of the lobby, where forty
      people could sit, in contrast to the chubby little parlour
      of their boarding-house; the gilded radiators; the
      brilliant tall brass cuspidors; the enormous dining-room,
      with real printed menus, at least for Sunday dinner; the
      unending rows of bedrooms, with no less than four
      bath-rooms; and the building itself, three towering stories
      of brick, and an entrance that had always fascinated
      him--not just a door flush with a wall, but right on the
      corner, cut diagonally across. And the people! He was used
      to the boarding-house residents; most of them elderly local
      couples who had given up the woes of housekeeping. They
      were as familiar and uninspiring to Myron as a wart. But
      entering the American House, staring out through its
      splendid plate-glass window on Main Street, were valorous
      birds of passage: travelling-men in sporty pink vests,
      Ascot ties, and collars almost cutting their lower jaws;
      the star of the Original Drury Lane Touring Company, with
      his astrachan-lined overcoat and hair like a horse's tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gee, Ma, it would be slick! Peachy! But you'd have to work
      so hard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I'd have more help. You'd help me, wouldn't you,
      wouldn't you? Wouldn't you help me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      They clung together. He was never, all his life, to be so
      close to any other human being as to Mother Weagle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We'll make a dandy hotel!' he crowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, maybe we will,' she meditated, roused a little out of
      the melancholy which drugs all of us when we contemplate
      actually doing any of the things we have always wanted to
      do, such as getting married, or dying, or wearing spats, or
      keeping an hotel.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed risky to give Tom Weagle charge of a hotel which
      included a bar-room. But Mother Weagle in a blind, rustic
      way understood people--the first requisite of
      hotel-keeping, as it is of law, medicine, or any other
      learned profession. Tom went on sneaking in little
      whiskies, but he tried to live up to the spectacle of
      himself as manager of a real hotel, one who met the
      glossiest travelling-man as an equal and had the power to
      make him comfortable or shunt him off to the meanest room
      on the third floor. He went so far as to keep his coat on
      in the office, except on the hottest days. He impressively
      rang the bell for Myron, or Uncle Jasper--the venerable
      negro who was porter, 'bus driver, saloon cleaner--to
      'carry up the gennulman's valise and hustle with it'. His
      proudest task was to carve the cooked meats, on a table at
      the end of the dining-room instead of in the kitchen, as
      normally, during meals. Tom was congenitally a master
      carver, and carving, though the layman guest rarely
      appreciates it, is one of the most occult priest-crafts of
      hotel-keeping. He loved the staccato clash of carving knife
      on steel sharpener, the grandeur of the knife's horn handle
      and Roman blade, the war-like flash as he flourished it
      high, and his surgeon's skill in piercing a wing-joint at
      the first precise stroke. Helping him, admiring and
      learning, Myron perceived that in at least this one
      mystery, his father was a savant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom even tried to keep the books, and made so few errors
      that Myron could usually correct them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron's position in the hotel, outside of school hours, was
      definite and simple: he did everything that no one else
      wanted to do. He wiped dishes and scrubbed floors; he swept
      halls and steps and the office; he cooked the breakfast
      eggs before galloping off to school; he roused irate
      travelling-men for the 4.14 freight to Waterbury; he
      occasionally tended bar. He learned in his very bones the
      insignificant, unromantic, all-important details of
      hotel-keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      He learned to broil chickens and steaks instead of frying
      them into a semblance of boot-soles; he learned that there
      are soups outside of oyster stew, cream of tomato,
      vegetable, and chicken, and potatoes other than German
      fried, French fried, baked, and mashed; he learned and
      proved, over his mother's horrified protest, that what she
      called the 'nasty-looking' feet of chickens should not be
      thrown away but skinned and used to make soup stock. He
      even learned, at the bar, under the tutelage of the
      professional bartender, Jock McCreedy, to mix such sacred,
      old-fashioned, and now forgotten drinks as the timber
      doodle, sherry cobbler, golden fizz, spread-eagle punch,
      fish-house punch, pousse-café, balaklava nectar, white
      tiger's milk, rumfustian, and alligator's ear; the very
      names a feast of poesy, and the beverages themselves a
      foretaste for honest drinking men of nectar in the
      innermost saloon bar of Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Myron showed uncommon talent, the first ever he had
      shown in his industrious life: he bought a cook-book. That
      was not extraordinary; people do buy cook-books,
      particularly brides. Between 1896 and 1931, 'The Boston
      Cooking School Cook Book' had sold a million and a half
      copies, making the author, Miss Fannie Merritt Farmer, one
      of the only five important American authors, along with
      Charles Sheldon, of <i>In His Steps,</i> Harriet Beecher
      Stowe, Arthur Brisbane, and Laura Jean Libbey. But
      thereafter his mild talent beat up into indisputable
      genius, for he actually read the cook-book, through and
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he built a linen-chute down the stair-well from the
      third floor to the basement, while old Tom (he was only
      forty-three, now, in 1894, when Myron was fourteen, but he
      was born old and it is believed that he became gently drunk
      on his mother's milk) sat on the stairs and helped by
      holding the nails and giving bad advice and quarrelling
      mildly at Myron for not doing better in school, since aside
      from seven or eight hours' work a day in the hotel, and
      perhaps seven wasted in sleeping, Myron was able to give
      all the rest of his time to attending high school and long,
      sweet, inspiring hours of study.

    <p>
      Not the triumph of entering college, nor even the triumph
      of a broker receiving his LL.D. degree from Muskingum
      College as a recognition of piety and generosity, is so
      satisfying an academic victory as emerging into high-school
      Sophomoredom. Sophomores are admitted now to be men and
      women, and they are still certain, on misinformation and
      belief derived from their parents, that it is worth while
      to become adults and have the privileges of shaving and
      bearing babies and tending the furnace and belching after
      meals. It is now that the boys are expected to smoke,
      though perhaps secretly, and the girls to have fellers and
      silk stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though most of his energy and his ideas were absorbed by
      the American House, now that he was fifteen and a
      Sophomore, Myron found high school diverting. The physical
      background was fairly bad. Not yet had New England towns
      discovered that the young can be educated only in a milieu
      of tapestry brick, Vita glass, $100,000 swimming pools,
      gymnasia with professional instructors, and marble-lined
      model kitchens. The Black Thread Centre High School was a
      slate-grey wooden shack with small, dirty windows and no
      ventilation. The floors were worn into channels around the
      knots in the boards, and the only decorations were
      portraits of the good grey poets. The students' desks were
      cramped, and the teachers still kept apples and punitive
      rulers on their desks instead of graphs of daily variation
      in individual suggestibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      After daily enforced intimacy with old, worn
      travelling-men--thirty and upwards--Myron liked the
      association with causelessly giggling youth. As to the
      studies that year, except for plane geometry and German, he
      did not think so much of them. Caesar was dull--Latin in
      general was dull. What the dickens did the ablative
      absolute, or gerundives, or the fact that the accusative
      was used with ad, ante, apud, circum, contra, inter, per,
      and trans have to do with daily life in Black Thread, or in
      New York or California either? Nor did he much care whether
      Hamlet was crazy, or what was the date of Charles
      Martel--what was Myron Weagle to Charles Martel and what
      was Charles to Myron? He rather liked droning in the
      music-hour, and trying to sketch pots and petunias in the
      drawing-lesson. And German, now that <i>was</i> something!
      With it he could talk to the little colony of Heinies up
      the river at Dutch Bend, and have a lot of fun pretending
      to speak it with his friends. 'Be gehts it Ihr, meiner
      Frund?' they bellowed at one another and, in more serious
      hours of confessed ambition, squatting on the river bluff,
      they planned that some day they would go up the Rhine,
      observing castles and Fräuleins, and they sang softly:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      'Ik weiss nick wot soll it bedeiten<br>
      Dass ik so traurick bin.'
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Particularly, plane geometry was fun. Myron liked the
      neatness and precision of it, sleek triangles and deft
      segments of circles and provable facts about the degrees of
      angles--not all the fuzzy obscurity of Caesar's opinions
      about the Gauls. Anyway, he had to get through the year,
      because next year he would be allowed to take up this new
      course in book-keeping, and that would be useful, whether
      he should become a lawyer, an hotel-man, a railroad-man, or
      keep store. But beyond all, his reason for excitement at
      the beginning of Sophomore year was that he had fallen in
      love with his handsome classmate, Miss Julia Lambkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia Lambkin practically belonged to the aristocracy of
      Black Thread Centre. Her father, Trumbull Lambkin, was not
      only the leading druggist in town, which made him almost
      the same as a doctor, but also a director in the Housatonic
      Savings Bank, a member of the library board, and a
      vestryman in the Episcopal Church, and the Lambkins had
      lived in Black Thread for three long, tradition-crusted
      generations. Julia was a tall wench, with a high laugh, a
      high colour, and a richness of chestnut hair, which she had
      put up before any of the other girls in her class. She
      danced much, and entertained--entertained whole bevies of
      young people at summer-evening parties on her porch, with
      almost unlimited raspberry vinegar and lemonade and banana
      layer cake. She was one of the eleven members of the
      exclusive Pequot Cycling Club, which scorched with a soft
      whirring of wheels on cool evenings, all of them humming
      'Sweet Marie' and looking down their noses at the common
      people and she was the only girl in town so luxurious as to
      own a Columbia bicycle!
    </p>
    <p>
      With such charms in a classroom seat only three from his,
      it was not extraordinary that Myron (along with seven or
      eight other young gentlemen) should have fallen
      volcanically in love with Julia. Though he did not feel
      that he belonged to her set, they went to many of the same
      parties. In the '90's, small-town Connecticut was still
      sufficiently democratic for that. He waltzed with her, and
      he waltzed well, but he was lumbering and ridiculous when
      he tried to caper through the figures of the square
      dances--grand right 'n' lef, sashay all--and Julia snapped
      at him, 'Oh, don't be such a galoot!' It was dreadful, he
      admitted, to be a galoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day long, in school, he sneaked glances at her over his
      geometry, while she bridled and would not look back. The
      other Sophomores watched them and giggled, and one little
      snip of a girl, with the daring of small contemptible
      females (this girl has become a woman and a mother since
      and has done no good; she plays contract by night and by
      day, and goes to a handsome chiropractor) passed along a
      row of seats such notes as 'Myron is crazy about Julie,'
      which everyone read and sniggered over. Evenings, whenever
      he could get away from the hotel and his home-work for a
      quarter of an hour, Myron plodded by Julia's house, poring
      upon it with hang-jawed and sad-eyed longing. The Lambkin
      mansion was in all of Black Thread surpassed only by the
      homes of the Boston Store owner, and of Mr. Dingle, the
      banker. It was of rather faded red brick, with dark-green
      shutters and a mansard roof. The porch was not, as was
      usual, exposed in front, but at the side, where it had a
      choice, mysterious secrecy. Myron gaped at the more
      fashionable and skittish of his classmates--some of the
      richer boys in white duck pants--lolling on the steps of
      this porch, and conversationally screeching at Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not dare join them. He felt too big and awkward and
      graceless; he felt <i>déclassé.</i> But his heart swelled
      to take in every aspect of Lambkinism--the Lambkin
      residence, the fine new Lambkin surrey with its fringed
      whipcord top, Mr. Trumbull Lambkin with his grim leanness
      and grey side-whiskers and smell of camphor and
      formaldehyde. Myron looked with a brother-in-law's
      affection upon Julia's sister, Effie May, aged four. She
      was a dear little golden-haired tot, and had all the
      attributes of a hyena. 'Gosh, Effie May certainly is one
      cute lil trick!' glowed Myron. He took into his devotion
      the Lambkin dog, Fred, a foul animal who was collie in
      front and Newfoundland behind and mean all over, and given
      to nipping night-roaming lovers who slowed up at Julia's
      residence. He even fawned upon Julia's brother, Herbert, a
      cold-eyed, even-eyed young gentleman a year older than
      Myron, who responded to an effusive 'Good morning,' with a
      frosty nod, and who, when it was amiably inquired of him,
      'Going to work in your dad's store this summer?' snapped,
      'Certainly not; I'm pursuing my studies for Yale and for a
      career of architecture.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert really talked that way, and for the time being,
      Myron endured it. He walked past the Lambkin house and
      walked past it and walked past it and agonized over the
      chatterers on the porch, and his heart was lonely--lonely
      still when he got back to the hotel and his father (who,
      this past hour, had done nothing more important than pick
      his teeth and scratch) scolded him for not having taken a
      travelling-man's trunks down to the sample-room. He was
      lonely even when he took the late trick at the bar, and the
      room was filled with the flat rattle of poker chips and the
      clank of glasses touched in toasts of 'Lookin' at yuh' and
      guffaws over the new one about Napoleon and the dead fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had fallen in love on the first day of Sophomore year,
      when his submerged passion had been revealed to him by the
      fact that, with her hair put up for the first time and her
      fine chin held high, Julia was the image of the Gibson
      Girl, who was the Venus and Helen of Troy of the time. Yes!
      He saw it now--saw his own heart. She was the real Gibson
      Girl, and to be worshipped beyond all other mortals. Since
      he was blossoming into the perilous age of fifteen, he
      longed for her with a sickening, defenceless ache. He was
      entirely vague as to what he wanted to do to her. He never
      dared think consciously of anything beyond sitting beside
      her on the steps of the porch, and perhaps shaking hands at
      parting, but that ambition kept him awake in his airless
      and cob-webbed room in the American House, as he pictured
      her: dear face, her large bright hands, her droll mouth,
      even the stuff of her beautiful percale blouse with its
      fashionable puffed sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till after a month of his passion and martyrdom, not
      till an October evening, did he catch her alone on the
      porch. For all his awe of her, he was not too timid a wren
      and, though he had to force his courage, he stalked up the
      path and firmly squatted on the top step, below her rocking
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hello,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hello.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Kind of cool.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, it is kind of cool.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You all alone to-night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' she admitted, 'I'm all alone. Nobody loves me, I
      guess.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gee, I do, all right.' He was pleased by the feat of
      having got just the right lightness and stylishness into
      his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, you do!' sardonically. 'You never come around.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I got my work in the hotel, Jule. Have to help out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you could get off sometimes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it's awful' hard to get off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure, you could get off lots of times.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I can't get off much of the time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, if you wanted to, you'd get off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would you like it if I got off and came over?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She tossed her head--not quite the thing for a big,
      handsome Gibson Girl--and sniffed, 'It don't make me no
      neverminds, smarty. I guess you don't want to come, or
      you'd get off more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'll try to get off more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, if you manage to get off more, then maybe I'll
      believe you want to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'll get off more--you see if I don't! Say, Jule,
      couldn't you go buggy-riding with me, some Sunday
      afternoon? We get half-rates from the stable, at the
      hotel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Uh-huh, Mr. Smarty! So that's why you're so willing and
      all to actually go and take me driving--because you can get
      a rig cheap!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, gee, Jule, I didn't mean . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, that's what you said; just prezactly what you
      said--you get half-rates, so maybe you might be willing to
      condescend to allow me to go driving!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not! I didn't mean it that way at all, and you know
      doggone well I didn't! If you want to go, all right, but if
      you don't, cut out the high and mighty! How about it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather weakly, Julia peeped, 'Oh, I'd like it, but Pa and
      Ma wouldn't stand for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why <i>not?'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      'They wouldn't mind it if you came here, right under their
      eyes, but they wouldn't let me go riding with you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why the heck not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I hate to say it but--they don't exactly approve of
      you, I guess.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pa's an awful old crank about some things, I guess, and
      your Dad is a saloon-keeper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is not! Just because there's a bar in the hotel . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far he had been bold and fluent, but he did not know
      how to finish, because he realized, appalled, that actually
      his father did belong to the class, pariahs in choice
      Connecticut villages, of saloon-keepers. He finished in
      confusion: 'He is not a saloon-keeper! He's an
      hotel-keeper!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, but I guess Pa doesn't think so much-a-much of
      hotel-keeping, either. He thinks waiting on a lot of people
      and feeding 'em and making their beds is kind of common.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me tell you, Julia Lambkin, my dad never made a bed in
      his life! He's the proprietor and manager! He just hands
      out keys and keeps the books and all like that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, <i>you</i> make beds sometimes, and once you washed
      out a pair of socks for a travelling-man--your brother Ora
      told us!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The dirty little snitch! I'll poke his face in! And
      anyway, what's the diff? Don't your father have to wait on
      people, behind the counter, and make up prescriptions for
      their bellyaches?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've never heard such disgusting language in all my life!
      No decent boy would <i>dream</i> of using a word like bel .
      . . like what you said, in the presence of a lady! And I'll
      have you to know, Mr. Smarty Weagle, that a druggist
      doesn't wash socks or sweep floors; he's a professional
      man, that people come to consult him in serious sickness
      and want his advice and let me tell you right here and now,
      Mr. Smarty, that old Doc Winter, and I heard him myself,
      with my own ears, and he said that my dad was a better
      doctor than nine-tenths of the people that <i>call</i>
      themselves "doctors", and if you think for one minute that
      I propose to sit here and let you insult my Papa, you're
      very badly mistaken.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She dashed into the house. She was so subtle that, after
      starting to slam the door in a nice, normal, furious way,
      she closed it with rebuking quietness. Myron sat collapsed,
      like a half-empty hot-water bottle. He rose with pain and
      removed himself with anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this time he kicked Fred, the dog, and enjoyed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way home, amid tornadoes and dust-storms of
      humiliation, he vowed, 'When I get to be a big doctor or
      lawyer, or maybe own a great big hotel or something, she'll
      be sorry! I'll show 'em!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of ways of aggrandizement, as he sat on a fallen
      willow trunk in a secret corner near the bridge. He would
      never wear a celluloid collar again, but always linen, as
      on Sunday, no matter how much his father complained of the
      cost. He would learn German perfectly, and astonish Julia
      Lambkin by discoursing with the teacher (which would, as a
      matter of fact, have been considerably beyond the teacher's
      powers). He would somehow, maybe by picking and selling
      huge quantities of blueberries, get a horse and a
      second-hand buggy of his own and drive scornfully past her
      house, and when Herbert or she wanted a ride, he would
      answer curtly, 'Sorry, but I have an engagement.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His plans for himself flowed into plans for the hotel. If
      it were a statelier establishment, Mr. Lambkin might be
      impressed. Of course Myron would get rid of the bar-room.
      (Of course he wouldn't, he admitted, even in his temporary
      insanity.) He'd persuade his mother to put in a 'ladies'
      parlour. Recently, on a Saturday, he had driven with his
      father to Torrington, and there, in the renowned Eagle
      Hotel, which had seventy rooms, he had seen a parlour all
      red plush and gilt. 'Add a lot of class to our place,' he
      meditated, almost forgetting Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did actually get his parents to install the parlour of
      his dream. His mother hesitated: it would cost so much, and
      take the space of one of their bedrooms. But Myron insisted
      that only at rush seasons, when the travelling-men were in
      the thick of spring or fall orders, were all their bedrooms
      occupied, and with a parlour they could cater to the
      schoolteachers and other lone females who had been their
      mainstay as 'steadies' at the boarding-house but who
      hesitated about living at an hotel in which the only
      lounges were a bar-room and an office infested with
      spittoons and men with hats cocked over their eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parlour was assembled--Myron Weagle's first triumph as
      a creative hotel-keeper, as he was some time to be called
      (to his slight but active nausea) at Rotary Club luncheons
      and Chamber of Commerce dinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new parlour of the American House was an artistic
      triumph. Mother Weagle and Myron went by train clear to
      Hartford, to the second-hand shops there, for the
      furnishings. It had a golden ingrain carpet--at first Myron
      did not like it so well as the hot crimson of the carpet in
      their boarding-house parlour, but after a time he
      considered it more delicate, and likely to knock the eye
      out of even an aristocrat like Julia Lambkin. The
      wall-paper was of poison green, with yellow blotches like
      headless fish. The furniture was ample: four easy chairs
      upholstered in worn brown velvet, with doilies of imitation
      crochet pinned on back and arms, three straight chairs,
      four china cuspidors, and a folding desk incorporating a
      bookcase in which were six novels left behind by guests and
      a directory of Beulah County ten years old. There were
      impressive lace curtains, and plush side curtains with ball
      fringes. But the two glories of the new parlour were the
      enormous vase covered with stamps pasted on and glazed
      over, a vase to be filled with pussy willows and gilded
      cat-tails, and the rare centre table, which had interesting
      bandy legs and a real marble top only partly concealed by
      the embroidered cover. It was, altogether, the handsomest
      room Myron had ever seen, aside from the Lambkin parlour,
      and for several days after Mother Weagle and he had
      completed the arrangement of the furniture (how
      breathlessly they tried the effect of the exotic stamp-vase
      on this side and on that!), he slipped upstairs to peep in
      and sigh with ecstasy. And when he caught Ora reading
      <i>Swiss Family Robinson</i> in the parlour, humped up in
      one velvet chair with his feet on another, Myron yanked him
      out by the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet at the sight of Julia going to church the next Sunday,
      in a new blue frock with ruffles which swept grandly
      through the dust and a superb large new hat on which
      unnatural violets and forget-me-nots bloomed upon a tufted
      bank of green velvet, all the splendour of the parlour
      seemed trivial, and his ambition of the last few days to
      become an hotel-man, to go on to even greater achievements
      than the parlour, became vulgar in his eyes. He longed to
      have a new blue-serge suit and a new Derby hat, and to
      follow Julia into church.
    </p>
    <p>
      (None of the Weagles went to church. Hotel-keeping,
      especially when Sunday-noon dinner is the gala meal of the
      week, is not conducive to attending public worship. Tom
      Weagle sometimes grumbled, 'Well, you can say what you want
      to about Religion, but lemme tell you it never did nobody
      no harm to be religious, and it's the only thing that'll
      keep a lot of these yahoos and toughs and iggoramuses in
      order.' Mrs. Weagle observed, 'I says to him, let me tell
      you, I says, I guess a book like the Bible, that has lasted
      four thousand years like it has, and nobody has been able
      to contradict it, it must be inspired by the Lord, and
      there's no argument about it, I says.' But probably none of
      the Weagles gave five minutes thought a year to theology or
      ecclesiology, except for Ora, who occasionally stirred up a
      lot of interesting family irritation by announcing that he
      was going to become a Catholic, an Episcopalian, a
      Buddhist, or a Seventh Day Adventist.)
    </p>
    <p>
      When pride in the new parlour slipped from him, when Julia
      in her gardened hat, entering the Litchfield County Gothic
      portal of the Congregational Church, seemed to him like an
      embodied light that dazzled him and left him dizzy and
      ridiculous, Myron wistfully gave up his plans to become a
      great hotel-man, and sought for a profession more worthy
      the traditions of Trumbull Lambkin, that distinguished
      seller of patent medicines and bath-sponges. Within a
      fortnight Myron was finally and irrevocably determined to
      become a doctor, a lawyer, a West Pointer, an explorer, a
      banker, a tobacco planter with a thousand lordly acres in
      the Connecticut River valley, the captain of a liner, and a
      professor of Greek--which language he chose as being the
      most unfamiliar of all known tongues. Just in between, and
      not quite so seriously, he considered becoming a tramp or a
      starved trapper in the Northern woods, and breaking Julia's
      cold and brittle heart by letting her know that she had
      ruined his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game of 'what'll we do after school' was familiar
      enough in high school, but none of the other boys went at
      it with such earnestness, such brisk and practical drawing
      up of detailed plans, such excited sending off for
      university catalogues, as did Myron. He discussed it with
      Ora who, though he was but thirteen, was fuller of words
      and bookish misinformation than any boy Myron knew. Ora
      often exasperated him; Ora sulked and wailed; he never
      conceivably did any of the light work assigned to him in
      the hotel, and he was always late for meals. But now Myron
      turned to him, as to an oracle much travelled in the realms
      of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You ought to be a business man,' condescended Ora. 'You
      can stand sitting at a desk doing figgers. You didn't even
      mind arithmetic. Gosh, it drives me crazy! But then, I'm
      never going to be a business man. Maybe a nauthor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      From earliest historical times Ora had desired to be a
      nauthor. Unlike Myron, he had never been tempted by law or
      banking, though where he first got a nauthorial ambition no
      one has an idea, for he had never met one of those exotic
      night-flying creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron half agreed, though he blunderingly indicated that he
      was less interested in making money than in administering
      institutions--hotels, hospitals, law-courts. Maybe there
      were business men, and successful ones, who were not
      money-grubbers but creators, he suggested. The new notion
      inspired him, and for the next fortnight he was, in council
      with Ora, a bicycle-manufacturer, the president of a
      rifle-factory in New Haven making guns so cheaply that any
      farm boy could afford one, and head of all the brass
      industries in Connecticut. Never had he been so intimate
      with Ora as now, when he overlooked disagreeable facts like
      unfilled wood-boxes and submitted his unromantic destiny to
      Ora's poetic vision. He even let Ora quote <i>Hiawatha</i>
      to him, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their brotherly comradeship ended in tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron, returning from school, came round a corner to find
      Ora, encircled by cheers and jeers, in a desperate fight
      with Herbert Lambkin, who was three years older than Ora
      and twenty pounds heavier. Ora's nose was bleeding all over
      his fashionable Eton collar and his hair was mingled with
      his fluent tears, but he was not doing so badly. He was
      butting Herbert in the belly, kicking his shins, and
      scratching his neck, and though the older champion
      occasionally got in a stout cuff on Ora's ear, he was
      giving way, and the gang were yowling plaudits to the young
      warrior-bard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron gave a bark of rage and threw himself in as though he
      were diving. He seized Herbert's collar, he socked Herbert
      upon the salient Lambkin nose, he kicked him, ran him up an
      alley, and came back beaming to his dear little brother. As
      they went off, Ora was sobbing, and when Myron chirped,
      'There, there--you done simply grand!' dear little brother
      howled, 'Damn you, damn you, damn you, you went and spoiled
      everything, like you always do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Huh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was scared of Bert. Then I went and made myself
      unscared, and I jumped on him when he grabbed my hat. And
      then I wasn't scared any more. I was sore. I wasn't scared.
      And I was licking him. And you butted in and kept me from
      licking him and spoiled it all, and you'll get all the
      credit, damn you! That's what you always do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      For weeks Ora would not be confidential, and Myron had by
      his lone self to puzzle out whether he was, to-day, a
      predestined doctor or sea-captain or revolver-manufacturer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then to the American House came the inspired priest of
      commerce, Mr. J. Hector Warlock, and made everything clear.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c05" id="c05">5</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the drummers working out of Bridgeport in 1895, none
      was handsomer, more affable, or more affluent than Mr. J.
      Hector Warlock, travelling representative, as he called it,
      of the Spurgis &amp; Pownall Hardware, Stove, and Kitchen
      Equipment Corporation. He was thirty-four years old. His
      hair was very black, very wavy, and very thick, like the
      more popular manly Christian evangelists of the day, and no
      evangelist could troll out a hymn with a soapier bass. (Not
      that Mr. Warlock was likely to be heard actually singing
      hymns in the House of the Lord on a Sabbath morning; he was
      much more likely to be sleeping off a late Saturday-night
      poker game.) His famous and frequent smile was enlivened by
      two gold teeth, and on his soft, white, swollen fingers he
      wore a Masonic ring, and a ring in the guise of a golden
      snake, with rubies for eyes; while his large watch-chain
      bore a tasty emblem in the way of a golden miniature
      kitchen range.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tall enough and broad enough by nature, but made to
      appear the taller and broader by his correct garments for
      1895; the Derby hat, the thick dark suit with shoulders
      enormously padded, the stiff-bosomed shirt--though its
      solemnity was lightened by sprigs of tiny violets in the
      pattern--and the large bow tie. To this he brightly added
      the fanciest of fancy vests, and he owned not just one,
      like local sports, but half a dozen: yellow with red polka
      dots, blue with white stripes, tan with scarlet sumac
      berries. He also wore the most stylish pointed toothpick
      shoes ever seen in Black Thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      His was a face that barbers loved. That broad, pale yet
      healthy, meaty yet jolly expanse of visage received more
      attention than the cheeks of a duchess. He always took what
      he called 'the whole works' at a barber's: shave, hair-cut,
      singe, shampoo, facial massage, violet water, talcum
      powder, and delicately lilac flavoured tonic for his dense
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was impressive, yet he was not overpowering, so hearty
      and insistent was his good-fellowship. He called all
      trainmen, bellhops, bartenders, and waiters 'Cap'n,' and
      when they saw him coming they chuckled, 'Hello, Mr.
      Warlock! You with us again?' His customers, the greater
      hardware-men of Southern New England, he addressed as
      'Boss', with a nice mixture of friendliness and deference,
      and they liked him, they gave him epic orders, they had him
      at their homes for Sunday noon dinner, which is the
      accolade of a travelling-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the American House, Black Thread Centre, the staff
      lamented that J. Hector came so seldom--only four times a
      year. Mother Weagle would, without visible cue, suddenly
      burst into a communal silence with a giggling, 'The very
      idea--that Mr. Warlock--chucking an old hen like me under
      the chin and telling me I was the best cook in Connecticut!
      Fresh!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert Dumbolton, <i>vulgo,</i> 'Dummy', who as a grocery
      salesman (out of Torrington) got around once every ten
      days, was of nothing so proud as of friendship with J.
      Hector, and he frequently informed the entire bar-room,
      'Say, I've been on the road twenty-six years now, and I
      want to tell you that I've never met a finer drummer, or a
      better man of any kind, than J. Hector Warlock. Say, he's
      got a heart of gold, that fellow has! Pays his bills,
      stands back of his friends, tells a good story, treats you
      like you was the Queen of England no matter <i>who</i> you
      are! And say, that fellow, when he's playing poker he can
      keep his trap shut like he was deef <i>and</i> dumb, and
      then next morning he'll go into a hardware store and talk
      the hind leg right off a donkey. Why, he can sell anything!
      He could sell fleece-lined overshoes in Hell! And
      successful, say, I'll bet Heck Warlock makes his forty-five
      or forty-eight hundred dollars every year--more money than
      any man in <i>this</i> stuck-up town! And educated, why
      say, often on a train, when there ain't anybody he knows to
      talk to, he'll read clear through a book!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this warrior-hero-prophet who came to Black Thread
      just as Myron, aged fifteen, was trying to determine his
      spiritual destiny--which, in the United States of America,
      meant his future job.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was on the desk when the 7.36 p.m. from the South
      came in. There was presently a crepitation of
      'Hello--hello--back again?' outside. Myron wandered to the
      plate-glass window giving on Main Street, and saw none
      other than J. Hector Warlock rolling up the street, seeming
      to fill it, his left thumb in the arm-hole of his vest, his
      right hand waving to the admiring citizenry. He was trailed
      by a boy pushing his suit-case in a wheel-barrow. It was
      not for J. Hector to tote his own bag, like an ordinary
      drummer; still less would it be his way to sleep in his
      shirt in the hotel and wait for his bag to be brought,
      along with his sample-trunks, by the dray-man in the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurled open the door, roaring at Myron, 'Hello, Cap'n,
      here's the baby elephant back again! How's tricks? Chased
      your dad out and took charge of the hotel have you? Well,
      how about a handsome suit with private elevator and a solid
      gold bed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He patted Myron's shoulder. Myron beamed. Myron exulted. J.
      Hector treated him as though he were grown-up, really were
      the manager . . . This was one of the moments, in
      hotel-keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      He galloped behind the desk, smartly swung the register
      about on its brass standard, held out the pen, then hastily
      changed it for another, with a better nib. While he wrote,
      with a flourish and two little marks, like quotation marks,
      under the dashing signature, J. Hector asked genially,
      'Who's in town? How's chances for a little bout of skill?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Al Dumbolton is here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fine! Where's a boy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I guess he's up in his room, writing out his orders. He
      was down here at the desk, but the fellows got to kidding
      him--they put a fire-cracker under his chair--and he got
      sore and went up. But I guess he'll be down in the bar,
      pretty quick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      (Poor Al! He looked like a rumpled red-satin sofa cushion.
      The fellows did 'get to kidding him' with frequency.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'He will! He will! Right down in the well-known bar! Trust
      Dummy. But say, Cap'n. Listen. I got an idea. You go up and
      knock and tell him the sheriff is here looking for him. I
      know doggone good and well he's been sniffing after that
      cute little wife of the night watchman at the mill, and
      he's kind of scared about it. Speak to him real serious.
      I'll be right behind you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not easy for Myron, as it would have been for Ora,
      to enact nervous excitement, but he would try anything for
      J. Hector Warlock. He knocked, and when Mr. Dumbolton came,
      in shirt sleeves and slipperless grey woollen socks, Myron
      croaked, 'Say, Al, gee, the sheriff is downstairs and he
      wants to see you! Looks awful mysterious, and like he was
      sore about something. I told him I thought you was out. You
      could sneak down the back way through the kitchen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dumbolton gaped. His frightened voice sounded like
      steam from a locomotive. 'D-did he say why he wanted to see
      me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, but he sure did insist.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, God, I might of known! What a fool I--Myron! I'll skip
      out the back way. Catch late freight at the crossing. You
      hold my valise. Tell the damn sheriff you can't find me.
      Make out like you're looking for me. Keep him busy! I'll
      make it quick!'
    </p>
    <p>
      J. Hector Warlock, in a voice convincingly changed from his
      natural humorous basso-profundo, growled, 'You will not!
      You won't make it at all, Dumbolton!'
    </p>
    <p>
      While the victim shrank from a big red sofa-cushion into a
      very little red sofa-cushion, J. Hector pushed past Myron
      and stood grinning down at Mr. Dumbolton, who stared and
      wriggled, then groaned, 'Well, I'm a sock-eyed son of a
      gun! I might of known! I thought you wasn't coming for a
      week! If I'd of known you was within fifty miles, I'd of
      known it was you, you old potato-face! I'll get you for
      this!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men pounded each other's backs, most affectionately
      and painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How about a little devotion to the Goddess of Fortune,
      this evening? How about making the aces gallop?' suggested
      J. Hector. 'No, Myron; wait a minute.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sounds elegant to me,' said Dumbolton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then look, Myron. Who's in the house that's good for an
      innocent, friendly little test of skill . . . with dynamite
      in the gloves?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Wood Harris is here from Hartford--boots and shoes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fine. Yes. I've played with him. Ask him to come up to my
      room in half an hour. By the way, you've given me the
      double room with the private bath as usual, I hope, Cap'n.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why!' Hurt and a little indignant. 'Sure! Of
      <i>course,</i> Mr. Warlock! Number 4.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirty years hence, Myron would remember, as it was indeed
      his business to remember, that J. Hector Warlock had been
      pleased to play cards with Mr. Woodland F. Harris; that he
      had the room with private bath; and that he--most
      extraordinary and inexplicable thing about this great
      man--actually preferred tea to coffee for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only there was no room with private bath in the American
      House, Black Thread. The bath was really one of the four
      public tubs, a 'down-the-hall-bath' as it was called. But
      it did have an entrance not only from the hall but from
      Double Room 4, and some six or eight times a year it was
      demanded as a private bath, it was called a private bath,
      and thereby, magically, as in theology, it became a private
      bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Warlock was proceeding, 'Get hold of Harris, boy. Then
      chase out or send that fresh brat of a brother of yours out
      and see if you can get hold of Cal Bigus and Ed Stuart and
      that livery-stable keeper, what's his name? for a game this
      evening. And shoot a bottle of Old Taylor and plenty of
      glasses and ice water up to the room. Here. Don't waste
      this. Invest it in New York Central Preferred.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed Myron a whole quarter. The largest tip Myron had
      ever received was fifty cents; that was from a man who had
      stayed two weeks and who as he had developed symptoms of
      delirium tremens, persecution mania, arthritis, acid
      stomach, and nympholepsy, had required some attention. His
      normal tip was ten cents--no, his normal tip, for dragging
      a leaden bag upstairs and bringing a pitcher of ice water,
      was nothing; ten cents was a New Yorker's tip.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, gee, thanks! I'll send Ora--my brother. I'll be right
      back up with your valise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not going to miss the chance of as much time as
      possible with his idol, J. Hector, who had, to Myron, all
      the subtlety of Miss Absolom, and considerably more point.
      He bullied his father into leaving a game of casino in the
      bar and coming in to take the desk. He bribed Ora to search
      for Cal and Ed and the livery-stable man; bribed him with
      fifteen cents out of the quarter. . . . Perhaps Ora was
      right in saying that Myron was born to business, not the
      arts, for even in this moment of excitement at J. Hector's
      golden coming and of strain in getting the alienated Ora to
      do anything whatever, Myron did not fail to make his
      righteous, capitalistic profit of ten cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      He summoned Mr. Woodland F. Harris from the bar, and tugged
      J. Hector's mighty suitcase up to Room 4. As long as he
      could without feeling intrusive, he hung about watching J.
      Hector unpack, getting a foretaste of the luxuries in the
      Great World to which he hoped some day to belong.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. Hector had such accessories to living as Myron had
      hitherto seen only on the bureau of Miss Absolom, and J.
      Hector's were richer, more male. From his bag, while Myron
      stood at the door and goggled, J. Hector produced not one
      but two hair brushes, thick, heavy, without handles.
      'Military brushes!' throbbed Myron. He had read of them in
      advertisements in the New York papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And shoes with dinguses in them, like pale-yellow wooden
      feet, to keep them unwrinkled. And a bottle with a rubber
      bulb and a sprayer-thing on it. This last J. Hector
      squeezed in Myron's direction, and Myron was conscious of a
      rarer, stranger scent than ever he had known. And these
      newfangled pyjamas, instead of a white night-shirt neatly
      edged at the neck with red binding such as Albert Dumbolton
      and Tom Weagle--and Myron and Ora Weagle--naturally wore.
      And not one or two but no less than six several neckties.
      And a whole box of fifty cigars, with red and gold bands.
      And--aside from the Old Taylor that Myron had brought up--a
      bottle of whisky curiously named 'John Haig'.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book J. Hector tossed to Myron. 'Read much, Cap'n? Good
      thing to do. Broadens your mind and gives you a vocabulary,
      so you can get the customers dizzy and unload the orders on
      'em, and even be able to make a speech at church suppers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron regarded the volume with awe. It was bound in paper,
      with a striking picture of a gentleman with moustache
      kissing a high-haired young lady in the presence of
      moonlight and a church tower, and it was entitled 'The
      Perils of Passion: or The Struggles of Sally St. Cyr: a
      Story of Humble Hearts and Proud Blood o' the Cumberlands'.
    </p>
    <p>
      His unpacking done, J. Hector, brave with cigar smoke,
      thumbs in his arm-holes, lolled in a straight chair which
      seemed transformed into a velvet fauteuil. (Myron knew the
      word 'fauteuil' from the catalogues he had studied when
      they were furnishing the hotel parlour.) Myron did not
      ever, like the blandly intrusive Ora, assume that his
      presence was always wanted; but J. Hector seemed glad of
      his company till the poker game should begin, and Myron
      stood beaming, shyly dragging his foot, while J. Hector
      discoursed on Bridgeport, New York ('lot bigger burg than
      Bridgeport, but you take my word for it, boy, not half as
      live a town'), the wonders of the new Spurgis &amp; Pownall
      kitchen range and the quixotic amount of nickle Mr. Pownall
      had caused to be spread upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To any American village in 1895, except for the half-dozen
      old and wealthy families who were familiars of New York or
      Boston or Chicago or Europe, the travelling-man was the one
      missionary from the Great World, and the young people
      listened to him with reverence. He was the Marquis back
      from Paris; he was Erasmus and Casanova; he was the
      Phoenician galley-captain returned from Ostia; he was the
      radio and the Harvard graduate and the Book of Etiquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. Hector gossiped of cocktails at the Waldorf bar, of
      planked blue-fish in Fulton Market, of champagne at
      Martin's, of the gigantic liners <i>Campania</i> and
      <i>Lucania,</i> each 13,000 tons, big as cathedrals,
      sailing from New York to Liverpool, and of an intimate
      friend of J. Hector's who had actually sailed on one of
      them and spent no less than eight weeks abroad, becoming
      authoritatively acquainted with England, Scotland, France,
      Holland, Belgium, Germany, Austro-Hungary, Italy,
      Switzerland, and Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron looked rapturous and dragged his foot harder than
      ever. 'Golly!' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gamblers arrived, each affectionately greeting J.
      Hector as a horse-thief, a son-of-a-gun, and a
      card-sharper. While J. Hector pump-handled them and called
      them hicks, bank-robbers, and cradle-snatchers, Myron
      bustled blissfully. He brought glasses and ice-water, the
      ice clinking against the side of the white earthenware
      pitcher as he tramped down the hall; he neatly opened the
      bottle of Old Taylor; he snatched an extra table from a
      vacant room and brought it in, balancing one end of the
      table against his stomach, panting and staggering with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five available players, J. Hector, Dummy Dumbolton,
      Woodland F. Harris, Cal Bigus, the jeweller, and Ed Stuart,
      the station agent, stripped off their coats, took off their
      stiff cuffs, and opened their vests, with a slight snifter
      of rye between operations, and sat down at the two joined
      tables with a firmness which indicated that they were here
      for business, and not to be taken lightly. J. Hector
      started by turning his chair about, facing the back,
      instead of waiting till he had to change his luck. This
      innovation astonished and impressed the local sports, and
      Myron was ever to remember it as a professional sort of
      thing to do. But the sports, and Myron, were yet more
      thrilled when J. Hector, tossing an unopened pack of cards
      on the table, stated unboastfully, 'Well, boys, to-night we
      don't play with any fifty-two slabs of butter. That's a
      fifty-cent pack, right from lil old Bridgeport!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had not known that you <i>could</i> pay more than
      fifteen cents for a pack of cards. When they were opened,
      he edged over to look at the backs. They did not have red
      and white scrolls, like all the cards he had ever seen, but
      real pictures, art pictures--a crescent moon against which
      reclined a lovely young woman who was, Myron thought,
      pretty much undressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could find no further excuse for staying. But he came
      back, half a dozen times, to renew the ice water, unasked,
      and once, very urgently asked, to bring two more bottles of
      Old Taylor. Ordinarily he was in bed by ten-thirty, up at
      five-thirty, but to-night he stayed with the greatness and
      adventure of the game, and he saw moments of the titanic
      struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in at midnight, with ice water, and found J. Hector
      and Ed Stuart watching each other with expressions of
      determined expressionlessness. The other three had dropped
      out and were looking on with something like awe. 'Nice lil
      pot,' Dummy Dumbolton whispered to Myron; <i>'only</i>
      sixty-five dollars!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sixty--five--dollars!' groaned Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ed Stuart was no mere victim to J. Hector. He was himself
      rather on the Homeric side, and it was told of him in the
      streets and lands and secret places of Black Thread that he
      had once sat in for thirty-six hours on a poker game at
      Beulah. And he was what Black Thread esteemed, 'pretty darn
      well-to-do'; he was not only station agent but he also had
      an interest in the bicycle shop, and owned and rented out a
      quarter section six miles north of town. Yet his voice was
      sharpening a little now, while J. Hector's was bland as
      mayonnaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Raise you two white ones,' snapped Ed, unbuttoning his
      collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'And</i> two!' crooned J. Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron, having that invisibility which is sometimes the
      humiliation and sometimes the protection of waiters, was
      able to see their hands. Ed Stuart held a full house, while
      J. Hector sat lovingly over the four of spades, the seven
      of diamonds, the eight of diamonds, the jack of hearts, and
      the queen of clubs, a combination approximating the
      absolute zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ed stared at his hand again; he forgot the esteemed virtue
      of looking completely dumb; he glanced anxiously at J.
      Hector as he hesitated, 'Well, up it two little ones.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And fifteen cold bucks more!' chuckled J. Hector joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh hell, take it!' wailed Ed, and as J. Hector coyly laid
      down his cats and dogs, one by reluctant one, all of the
      players howled and did homage to J. Hector Warlock.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      At one o'clock they had stripped to their undershirts (two
      red flannel, two balbriggan, and the elegant soft silk and
      wool of J. Hector). At two, they were speaking with furry
      and wanton tongues, and J. Hector bribed Myron (he need not
      have) to go down and break the law and sneak them another
      Old Taylor. At three, J. Hector had dropped from a lead of
      seventy-four dollars to fifty cents, but he did not, like
      Ed Stuart, look put upon; he looked red-eyed, and his
      profuse hair was in his eyes, but he was good-natured. He
      alone seemed to regard this as a game, something having a
      distant but traceable relationship to pleasure. He rumbled
      at Myron, 'Good Godfrey, boy, you ought to be in bed! We
      keeping you up? You go to bed now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, gee, I don't mind. I want to see the game.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right, Cap'n, you're the boss. No wise drummer ever
      butts in on the Mine Host of a caravansery. Never knows
      when he may need. . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hey, are you playing poker, Heck, or giving a
      Ly-<i>ce</i>-yum lecture?' snarled Ed Stuart.
    </p>
    <p>
      '. . . may need the manager to explain to folks about the
      hairpins in the bed. But if you're going to stay up, Myron,
      how about frying us a couple of eggs--or hippopotamus's
      ears, or whatever's handy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bet I will, Mr. Warlock!'
    </p>
    <p>
      When Myron swayed in with an enormous tray with ten fried
      eggs, bacon, toast, coffee, and the crabapple jelly his
      mother always put up, J. Hector broke all the liturgical
      rules by rising in the middle of a hand, clapping Myron's
      shoulder, and observing, 'Well by the great jumping
      Jehosophat! You're the best night clerk <i>I</i> ever saw,
      Myron! George Boldt better watch his step; you'll be
      running the Waldorf, 'long in about five years! Well,
      what's the damage?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I don't know how to charge you. Usually it's a quarter
      when a guest gets a lunch if he's going to catch the late
      freight or the 6.07 to Bridgeport.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well then, by golly, we'll call this two bucks--that's
      forty apiece for the grub--and here's fifty cents for you,
      Myron.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I can't . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The hell you can't! Here.' He roughly thrust two dollars
      and a half into Myron's pocket, turned him around, shot him
      out of the door, and jovially commanded, 'Now you go to
      bed, or I'll know the reason why, and if I hear you snoring
      or fighting with the bedbugs, I'll be up there and know the
      reason why! You git! Bless you, son; you took fine care of
      us!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron stood outside the door and worshipped, 'That's the
      swellest fellow I ever knew!' He sleepily contrasted J.
      Hector with the bleak and whiskery respectability of
      Trumbull Lambkin, with the snippy superiority of Julia and
      Herbert Lambkin, with the dreary industry of Mr. Barstow,
      the furniture dealer across the street, with the feeble
      irritability of his father, with the contempt of Ora, even
      with the disconcerting secret smile of Miss Absolom.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's just grand!' said Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was at half past three. At a quarter to five, when Mr.
      Dummy Dumbolton tacked wanly down the hall from the
      grandeur of Double Room 4 to his own exiguous apartment, he
      found Myron sleeping in a sway-backed chair beside his
      door. Dummy peered owlishly at this phenomenon. It was all
      a part of the great unreality which had befogged the world,
      this last half hour. Myron awoke, sharply, awoke all awake,
      begging, 'Did he win, Mr. Dumbolton, did he win?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Di' whru win--win what?' gurgled Dummy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Warlock? Did he win?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yesh--couple--guesh couple, couple dollars. G'night. . . .
      Oh my God!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late for Myron to go to bed; that would only
      make him feel the worse when he got up. He would be on duty
      in three-quarters of an hour. He wavered down to the
      kitchen, let the water run till it was icy, soaked his
      head, and not too uncheerfully began to sweep. He knew that
      the three local gladiators would have ganged up on J.
      Hector, and that if J. Hector had won anything at all, he
      had done well. Myron had, he felt, triumphed that night
      along with his idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      By six, he was whistling, awake and lively, which was as it
      should be, for the ability to stay up brightly all day and
      all night and all day again is, probably more than any
      technical trick or profound learning, the secret of
      hotel-men, physicians, sea-captains, aviators, bootleggers,
      and bridegrooms.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When Myron came home from high school at noon, J. Hector
      was in a leather-upholstered rocker in the office, looking
      red-eyed but cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Morning, Cap'n. Get any sleep?' called J. Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, sure, plenty!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, can't say as I did. I sort of realized it this
      morning, when I tried to sell Brother Hickman a line of
      refrigerators at his store, and caught myself informing him
      that they would run on coal, wood, or old rags, and were
      unexcelled for broiling, roasting, and baking. Well . . .
      Say, that was an elegant spread you gave us, last night.
      Did I pay you for it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir. Say, uh, say, Mr. Warlock . . .' Myron ventured
      to sit down beside J. Hector, and to confide, 'Say, do you
      think hotel-keeping is a good business? Or do you think
      that a fellow, if he's got any ambition, had ought to get
      out and become a banker or a manufacturer or a doctor or
      something?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look here, son! Somebody been ribbing you about
      hotel-keeping not being a dignified and highfalutin line of
      business? You tell 'em to go soak their head!
      Dignified--why say, fellow was telling me, he was a college
      professor or something, I met him on a train, and he showed
      me where in the Olden Days surgeons were barbers, too, and
      folks didn't think much of them. They about ranked with the
      third assistant hired girl. But now, good Lord, when a
      surgeon agrees to cut you up, you'd think he was the King
      of France! Hotel-keeping--well, up till now it hasn't been
      so good because the hotels--taverns they used to call 'em,
      and inns, and so on--and they weren't so good. But that's
      all changing. I tell you, way I figure it, some day there's
      going to be even bigger and sweller hotels than the
      Waldorf, and then, as the hotels get better, the hotel-men
      are going to be more important. Lots of swagger folks will
      get sick of housekeeping and go live in hotels. It will be
      one of the most important lines of business in the country,
      with some of the biggest folks in it.
    </p>

      'And as for the usefulness of hotels, well say, it takes a
      travelling-man to appreciate an hotel--come in all tired
      and wet and sick of day coaches and cinders, and get a good
      hot cup o' coffee like Mother Weagle makes, and a good
      clean bed like here--though you <i>might</i> have some of
      the mattresses made of straight-grained pine, next time,
      and not all this knotty stuff. But I'm just joking. Nothing
      you could do more important--<i>or</i> interesting--meet
      all kinds of people, and see 'em with their shirts off, you
      might say; see the Senator soused and the up-state banker
      meeting a peacherino. And you belong to the hotel; you've
      got the start. Nobody, hardly ever, learned hotel-keeping
      right down to the ground unless he was born under the
      kitchen sink and did his teething on a file of overdue
      bills! Go to it, boy! You'll have to learn a lot. You'll
      have to get into a lot bigger hotels than this--say, like
      in Bridgeport--biggest city of its size in the U.S.A.!
      You'll have to learn accounting and purchasing; not just
      run out and pick up a beefsteak, like you do here, but deal
      with big supply houses for maybe a thousand knives and
      forks, a hundred turkeys, five kegs of oysters--how to
      bargain and how to stand in with 'em. You'll have to learn
      <i>manners--</i>learn to be poker-faced with guys that
      would take advantage of you. Now, of course, you're only a
      kid, but even so, you're too doggone open-hearted; I can
      tell right away when you're pleased or kind of hurt. You'll
      have to know all about china and silver and glass and linen
      and brocade and the best woods for flooring and furniture.
      A hotel-manager has to be a combination of a house-frau, a
      chef, a bar-room bouncer, a doctor for emergencies, a wet
      nurse, a lawyer that knows more about the rights and wrongs
      of guests and how far he dast go in holding the baggage of
      skippers than Old Man Supreme P. Court himself, an
      upholsterer, a walking directory that knows right offhand,
      without looking it up, just where the Hardshell Baptist
      Church is and what time the marriage license bureau opens
      and what time the local starts for Hick Junction. He's got
      to be a certified public accountant, a professor of
      languages, a quick-action laundryman, a plumber, a
      heating-engineer, a carpenter, a swell speech-maker, an
      authority on the importance of every tinhorn State Senator
      or one-night-stand lecturer that blows in and expects to
      have the red carpet already hauled out for him, a fly-cop
      that can tell from looking at a girl's ears whether she's
      sure-enough married to the guy or not, a moneylender--only
      he doesn't get any interest or have any security. He's got
      to dress better 'n a Twenty-third Street actor, even if
      he's only got a thin dime in his pocket. He's got to be
      able just from hearing a cow's moo to tell whether she'll
      make good steaks. He's got to know more about wine and
      cigars than the fellows that make 'em--they can fool around
      and try experiments, but he's got to sell 'em. And all the
      time he's got to be a diplomat that would make Thomas F.
      Bayard look like John L. Sullivan on a spree. He's got to
      set a table like a Vanderbilt and yet watch the pennies
      like a Jew pedlar. If you can do all this, you'll have a
      good time. Go to it, Cap'n. Well, I think I'll go in and
      feed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Not again, for more than an occasional hour, did Myron
      aspire to anything save becoming a hotel-keeper--a great
      hotel-keeper of the fabulous coming post-Waldorf days.

    <p>
      To Myron, his brother Ora was a greater mystery than Miss
      Absolom or the Pleiades. He could not understand why Ora
      had no apparent satisfaction out of doing, neatly and on
      time, his small tasks about the hotel; how Ora could enjoy
      reading Scott and Dickens and Thackeray and Tennyson for
      hour on hour. Golly, didn't the kid ever get tired of all
      those fairy stories and lies about a bunch of knights and
      so on? And where did Ora get all these curious ideas?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora would confide, 'Some day I'm going to Venice. . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's in Italy, ain't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hell no! It's in Finland! I'm going to Venice and I'm
      going to have a gon<i>do</i>la of my own, and ride around
      in it, and have a bunch of wha'-juh-call-'ems to sing
      Ytalian songs to me. By moonlight. Every night for years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gosh, I wouldn't think that would be much fun, Ora. Not
      after the first couple a nights. I'd rather get some time
      off from the hotel and go up to Maine, duck-hunting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You would! And I'm going to know a lot of princes and
      dukes and all like that. And the Riveera. Gambling at Monte
      Carlo!'
    </p>
    <p>
      With venerably shaking head Myron fretted, 'Never thought
      much of gambling. Good way to waste your money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, your darned old Hector Warlock--with his fancy
      toothache vests that look like catsup spilled on a
      tablecloth--he gambles!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's different. Just a little cards, with friends. And
      you say anything against Mr. Warlock and I'll slap your
      face off!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You would! That's about the only way you <i>can</i> argue.
      Warlock! I'm going places he never even heard about, with
      all his gassing about Fifth Avenue and Boston and the
      Parker House! I'm going to have a chalette right up on top
      of the Alps, and sleep all day and sit up all night and
      look at the stars. . . . Did you ever think, Myron: the
      stars are flowers in the fields of heaven?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron looked at him suspiciously. Was Ora trying to kid
      him? But his brother was entirely serious. Myron did not
      jeer; he never jeered at Ora, however often he longed to
      assault him. 'No, I never thought about 'em that way.
      Sounds like Reverend Ivy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As the pretty thought had indeed come to him from the lips
      of the Reverend Waldo Ivy, Ora answered furiously, 'It does
      not! He never had as good an idea as that in his life! I
      got lots of ideas. Wait 'll I get time to compose books and
      poems out of 'em! You'll see! I'll make so much money I'll
      have a yacht, and go off cruising to--oh, to Cambodia and
      Nantucket and the Vale of Avalon and all over.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I hope you do. Say, kid, how about filling that
      wood-box now?'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron worried, 'He's certainly got elegant ideas. I guess
      he has a real superior mind. That poem he wrote--what was
      it?--
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      'Through distant seas I long to sail<br>
      To quest everywhere for the Holy Grail'
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0em;">
      something like that, anyway; it certainly was quite an
      unusual poem. Only, why can't he do first things first,
      like Mr. Warlock always says? All fine and dandy to dream
      about Europe and the Alps and all them, but meanwhile he's
      here at the American House, and why not do the jobs he's
      got to do--and he has got to; I'll see he does 'em! Then
      get ready to go all them places when the time comes. I
      don't understand a fellow that just hasn't got a pride in
      doing well whatever he's got to do. . . . Oh, well, prob'ly
      I'm just an old stick. Prob'ly I'm like Ora says: No
      imagination. Just about as bad as that old stiff-neck,
      Trumbull Lambkin. . . . I wonder what kind of hotels they
      got up on the Alps? Must be big ones, with a view all over.
      Wonder if they have many private baths?'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In all the Black Thread High School there was no boy more
      popular than Myron Weagle. Yet he had no friends. For in
      boyhood, friendships are strictly based on leisure hours.
      Friends are the companions of your evening games of
      pom-pom-pullaway and prisoner's base, of Saturday afternoon
      hikes through the woods, of lolling at the swimming hole.
      They need have, these friends of boyhood, no two thoughts
      in common with you, nor any similarity of taste; met after
      a lapse of twenty years, they may be stranger than any
      chance acquaintance of yesterday in the Pullman car. They
      are comrades at arms, not intimates. And thus, having no
      leisure in boyhood, Myron could have no friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      It never came to the jolly Tom Weagle or to the
      affectionate Mother Weagle that they kept Myron so busy,
      every second when he was not in school or in bed, that he
      had no authentic boyhood whatever. They treated him
      handsomely, they felt. Didn't he have, with hotel fare
      instead of the normal boy's restricted home table, more
      than enough to eat? Didn't he have a new suit of clothes
      every single year? And whenever they asked him just to do
      some very tiny little extra task (which they did
      approximately fifty times a day), didn't they put it
      politely, with 'If you can get around to it and it isn't
      too much trouble'? And didn't he usually seem willing to do
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they would have argued if ever, by a miracle, Tom and
      Edna Weagle could have achieved the profundity of thinking
      in any way whatever about their method of rearing Myron. .
      . . They thought enough about rearing Ora, though. Ora saw
      to that, by constantly and heroically complaining over
      whatever he was asked to do, and energetically not doing
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had no fast friends, so Myron had none of the contact
      with Nature which often compensates a village boy for
      provincial dullness and nastiness, for nowhere to go in the
      evening save the same promenade down main street to the
      same drug-store for the same choc'late or strawb'ry
      ice-cream soda, for the invariable family conversation at
      supper table, with dad's same mean little joke about the
      boy's laziness and huge appetite, for the same tight
      crankiness of teachers who are teaching only because they
      have not been able to get married.
    </p>
    <p>
      With most village children, this is usually balanced by a
      consciousness of flowers, groves, birds, little valleys in
      summer haze, but Myron never had time for hours of inspired
      loafing on hillsides, and without these hours of letting
      the sound and colour of the world soak in there can be no
      knowledge of Nature. But if he did not have a lover's
      intimacy with Nature, he did love scenery. The two are not
      at all the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The authentic city-man, to whom all properly planned Nature
      is of cement evenly marked out in squares, may for half an
      hour be able to admire the alienage of a Vermont valley
      with woods sloping up to a stalwart peak, even though he
      may not be sure whether the trees are date-palms or
      monkey-puzzles, and whether the hazy mountain is built of
      reinforced concrete or merely green-painted brick. Ora
      could tell a vesper sparrow from a thrush much farther off
      than Myron, yet when Myron stood on the roof of the
      American House, he found exciting and refreshing the view
      of angling river and demure hills which completely bored
      the sun-god who desired to enthrone his solar divinity in a
      private gon<i>do</i>la.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor had he sports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over that, the high school wept. The baseball captain
      insisted that Myron was a natural pitcher. The football
      captain protested that Myron's chest and shoulders and a
      certain quickness of attack, as beheld in fights behind the
      schoolhouse, marked him as a tackle or half-back. Didn't he
      have any pride in his school? Wasn't he going to Do
      Anything for Good Old Black Thread? Was he so lazy and so
      unpatriotic that he would sit back and let Beulah H.S. lick
      Black Thread again this year?
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron could not, he felt, explain that he was unable to get
      away from the hotel. That would be a criticism of his
      father and mother. He hedged and smiled and covered up, and
      with a poker face, as taught by J. Hector Warlock, he
      concealed his longing to be out on ringing autumn
      afternoons, practising with the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll sure try to make it, but I'm kind of behind on that
      doggone Latin,' he lied amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sixteen now. For a whole year, under J. Hector's
      spell, he had been a professional hotel-man, and he knew
      the loyalty of the guild.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      If Myron lacked intimacy with arbutuses and squirrels, he
      had an intimacy with the much wandering, hard-headed hotel
      employees for which other boys envied him. Wise Uncle
      Jasper, the darky porter, cackled of the 1850's when, still
      a slave, he had swept the bar of the pavilion devoted to
      high-minded drinking at the Rockbridge Alum Springs, in
      Virginia, where the 'young gemmun' were exalted by the
      brandy crusta, the Louisiana sugar house punch, gin and
      tansy, and port wine negus. He told of driving General
      Grant when he had had a victoria at the stand of the Eutaw
      House in Baltimore, and Myron gloated. Some day <i>he</i>
      would have a hotel to which titans like General Grant would
      come, and he would know them!
    </p>
    <p>
      'I trust this suite is to your Excellency's liking,
      General. Pray inform me, General, if there is any service
      which I can--may--may have the pleasure of rendering you,
      and it is my humble hope that your stay with us may be most
      agreeable, General. What, your signed portrait? Why, sir,
      that is a most thoughtful and highly appreciated favour,
      General. My very grandchildren will prize it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      From Mrs. Hobby, the oldest of the
      waitress-chambermaids--she was a reduced lady, considerably
      reduced, and she liked being called the
      'housekeeper'--Myron learned about repairing torn towels on
      the sewing machine, running across the tear over and over.
      Even from Imogene Heck, the frowsy and grease-scented wench
      who washed dishes and prepared the vegetables for Mother
      Weagle to cook, Myron learned kitchen tricks: cleaning
      copper with rock salt and vinegar, cleaning foggy water
      bottles with diced raw potatoes and boiling rancid oil with
      a potato to sweeten it. But it was Jock McCreedy, the
      bartender, who had most to teach Myron, and whose
      amiability made up to him for the loss of sun and wind and
      running laughter, for living most of his out-of-school
      hours in the queer, damp caverns of an inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      No character in pre-Prohibition America, or in the few good
      'American bars' in Europe since then, was quite so friendly
      with such a variety of people as the competent bartender.
      His court was the only authentic democracy America has ever
      known. The confidant of travelling princes and admirals, of
      thirsty authors and scientists, of apprentice drummers and
      of anxious insurance salesmen who wanted to know the rich
      men in town, of tired surgeons and swivel-eyed
      newspapermen, of crooks and yeggs and pan-handlers, of
      pompous merchants and mufti-cloaked clergymen from distant
      towns, the bartender was privileged, or gloomily fated, to
      know them better than did their own brothers, as the magic
      of alcohol opened their wicked hearts and made them say
      what they really thought to the one confessor near at hand.
      He listened to their dirty stories. It was a slow day when
      he didn't hear the Latest One at least seven times over.
      And he cured their morning shakiness. He heard out their
      troubles with their wives, and gave sage advice--the advice
      was never taken, but it did comfort afflicted husbands to
      find someone who was willing to listen to their troubles
      without sneaking away. He lent them money and sometimes got
      it back. He knew the best churches, the best fishing-tackle
      shops, and the best prostitutes in town. Better even than a
      veteran hotel clerk he could divine from the set of a
      stranger's lapels whether he would pay his bills, beat his
      wife, cheat at poker, and appreciate real French cognac.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one, not even a gigolo or a popular pastor, was required
      to practise the art of universal conversation so
      masterfully as a high-ranking bartender. If he could not
      discuss the mechanics of hydro-electric plants, the
      probabilities of the English being the lost tribes of
      Israel, the value of sewing-machine oil in cases of
      ear-ache among juveniles aged 3-7, the styles of Bulwer
      Lytton or of this new author, Richard Harding Davis, the
      amount that should be paid for a blue suit with extra
      pants, the comparative values of pointers and setters in
      quail-hunting, the record of Maud S., and the merits of
      Predestination as a dogma, then was he lost and disgraced,
      and no mastery of mixing a Blue Blazer would excuse his
      lack of intellectual supremacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was a lord among bartenders who trained Myron in the
      social graces as he crept from sixteen to seventeen and
      eighteen and to graduation from high school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was agreeable, especially on an August afternoon
      when outside the pavement was aching with heat. The cool
      bar-room, smelling of beer, of acrid whisky, of water
      sprinkled on sawdust; the pyramids of glasses and the nude
      which Ora admired; companionable men playing casino,
      humming 'Down Went McGinty'; and Jock McCreedy and Myron,
      in superbly clean and starched white jackets, ready for the
      late-afternoon rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a stranger came in, Jock muttered, 'Watch him--get the
      money--don't like his eyes.' But when it was a familiar
      dead-beat, Jock did not leave him to Myron's youthful
      sentiment but tackled the monster himself, crooning sweetly
      as any mother over a cradle, 'Lil drink, Pete? First, how
      about something on account, old man? Tom Weagle told me
      this morning that he'd just about fire me if I didn't
      collect from you. We got to pay the rent. How about five
      dollars?' And when one of the village potentates, a strong
      church and temperance man who never drank anything but
      liquor, came hastily in and muttered, 'Little hooch--got a
      bad cold', Jock served him with the manner of an acolyte
      before the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were great days! Myron began to feel that he knew his
      job--kitchen and linen-room and bedrooms, front office and
      dining-room and bar. He felt the virility of competence. He
      was ready for his graduate school and learned degrees in
      the science of hotel-keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he finished school, he announced to the family
      that he was going to Torrington, to seek a job in the
      magnificent Eagle Hotel, with its seventy rooms and, since
      it was near the depot, its awe-inspiring restaurant
      business from railroad passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother wept, with her old apron over her eyes. How
      could she carry on without him? He would probably not have
      gone, never in many years have left Black Thread, had not
      old Tom Weagle masterfully rushed in with, 'Sure! That's
      always the way! After all the years I've brought you up and
      done for you, now you try to sneak away just when you're
      getting so you might be a little bit of use to your mother
      and me! I've boarded you and fed you and taught you manners
      and given you fifty cents a week spending money, just to
      throw away, and by God, this is the thanks I get for it!
      No, you shut up, mother. Time for me to take a hand and
      tell this thankless young serpent's tooth just what kind of
      a--what kind of a serpent's tooth he is, by God!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron walked the fifteen miles to Torrington, carrying his
      suitcase. The first five miles he wept over the image of
      his mother. The second five miles he was exuberant with
      adventure and freedom. It was the first time since they had
      left the farm, when he was seven years old, that he had had
      time to go off and be his own man on his own road. The last
      five miles he was much too hand-sore to think about
      anything else whatever--even the fact that he was going to
      be welcomed with cheers by the Eagle Hotel, and immediately
      become a hotel manager, famed country-wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept in a haystack a mile from Torrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could only gape, his heart cold, next morning, when Mr.
      Coram, manager of the Eagle, a slim, professorial man with
      eye-glasses, told him that there was no place for him. He
      nearly starved, though not once did he consider going back
      to Black Thread, during the ten days before he got a
      temporary summer job as bell-boy in that most disreputable
      resort hotel, the Fandango Inn, at Buttermilk Springs.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c07" id="c07">7</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He shared, with the other three bell-boys at the Fandango
      Inn, a small room slashed by the slope of the roof almost
      into a pentahedron. The only ventilation was from windows
      two feet high, down on the floor, under the roof-slope.
      This carpetless, paperless room was frequented by bedbugs,
      and the beds were hard canvas cots without sheets, and
      nothing can be harder, after six hours' sleep (which was
      about what Myron got, nightly) than tight-stretched canvas.
      It was rather like a prison cell, but probably not so
      interesting. Myron had been more comfortable in the
      littered 'single room' he had shared with Ora at the
      American House; he had even been more comfortable on rush
      nights, when travelling-men were sleeping on billiard
      tables, on dining-room tables, and on cots set out in the
      hall, and Ora and he had bunked on blankets in the airy
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      His uniform was another distress; it was very tight, it had
      such crampingly tight trousers, and there was a confounded
      row of little brass buttons to do up and keep done up. In
      it he felt like a grind-organ monkey, though when he
      presented this thought to his fellow bell-boys, they
      assured him that he didn't look so--he merely looked like a
      gorilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was badly paid and worse tipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was the toughness, the boisterousness, the shadiness
      of the guests at the Fandango that most worried the
      innocence of Myron, fresh from his mother's housewifely
      inn-keeping. Bad eggs had come to the American House; Myron
      and Jock McCreedy had dragged a homicidal drunk to bed and
      locked him in; but for the most part the
      travelling-salesmen and farmers and widows and itinerant
      oculists who had been their guests were glad to get wearily
      to bed at ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests of the Fandango had all the vices of Monte
      Carlo, done in oilcloth instead of in velvet. They were the
      'cheap skates', the 'tinhorn sports', the 'two-bit
      spendthrifts' whom in secret confidences hotel-men bewail
      along with taxes, leaky coffee percolators, devils who cut
      new towels while wiping razor blades, ash-tray stealers,
      skippers, passers of rubber checks, loose carpet edges in
      dark halls, and the other major tragedies of their
      profession. The Fandango guests left Torrington and
      Hartford and Waterbury and New Britain as humble clerks or
      shop-keepers; they arrived at the hotel as two-weeks
      gentlemen, as millionaires who by God were used to Service
      by God and were going to by God have it or know the reason
      why; and they simply threw away money--on everything but
      laundry and tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goodwife who for years had sat down contentedly at home
      to a supper of creamed chipped beef, johnny cake, cocoa,
      and apple sauce now expanded her proud, jet-glittering
      bosom in hauteur as she viewed a menu with bisque of
      lobster, brook trout, sweetbreads, roast duck, curaçoa
      sherbet, glace panacheé, and thirty other items, and
      wailed, 'Is <i>this</i> all they got for supper?'
    </p>
    <p>
      How they ate! How they drank! And how, and how badly, they
      sang of a moonlit evening, like hound-dogs howling down the
      moon. Half an hour before meal-times, even though for the
      men-folks it meant leaving the delights of the bar-room
      thirty minutes early, the whole corps of guests planted
      their rocking-chairs as near as they could get to the
      dining-room entrance, and the second the double doors were
      slid open by the stately negro head waiter, they made a
      cavalry charge, while the head waiter, visibly paling,
      leaped away to save his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fat men ate and re-ordered and ate three helpings of steak,
      two helpings of salmon, three kinds of pie. Fat men ate and
      drank and panted, and all day long, between meals,
      delicately rested their tender and uneasy bellies against
      the bar rail, while they tried the interesting effect of
      lacing rum punch with gin and maraschino. Lean men stalked
      ladies along the immense porch and crept into rockers
      beside them and cleared their throats and began, 'Hm. Nice
      day. Been here long, Madame?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost every night, Myron and the other bell-boys and the
      porters had to remove some lean man from the bedroom of a
      more or less indignant lady, while the lean man explained
      alcoholically that he had mistaken this for his own room,
      and that the Fandango had gone to hell and he would be
      leaving in the morning. And lean men and fat men and
      indescribable between-men played poker all night long,
      noisily, quarrelsomely, not with the deft, swift quiet of
      J. Hector Warlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fandango Inn had unusual facilities for sport--for
      1898. There were four croquet grounds and a tennis court.
      There were saddle-horses and, not very far away, through
      not very much of a thicket, a small lake where one could
      swim if one liked that sort of thing. It was rumoured that
      in North Buttermilk, only a few miles distant, one could
      even play this new-fangled game, golf. But none of the
      Fandango's guests over the age of eighteen wasted their
      hours in sport. They ate. They drank. They rocked. They
      dozed, and waked to eat again. They made the resplendent
      night loud with the smack of wide dripping kisses, and
      before they went to bed, they had light snacks of ham,
      tongue, corned beef, and fish salad at the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager of the Fandango, a smooth-spoken person with
      oily black hair, who never glanced at you when he talked,
      rubbed his hands and looked content, and when there was a
      perfect devil of a shindy in some bedroom after midnight,
      over a euchre game or an affair of gallantry, this manager
      walked the other way and said softly to the bellboys, 'Mind
      your own business. What you don't hear won't ever make you
      deaf!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And once, when the manager was behind the desk and a lady
      and gentleman, with no baggage other than a bottle of
      bourbon in a paper bag, registered 'President McKinley and
      grandmother,' he simpered and gave them a room. He left it
      to the bell-boys and porters to hush illuminated guests
      when other rooms complained too much; if they didn't quiet
      the rioters, he threatened to fire the boys; if they did
      quiet them, and the rioters themselves complained, he fined
      the boys a day's salary, and beamed, and went into the bar
      and had a drink on the money thus saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that summer Myron learned, or so he believed, how to
      handle any sort of objectionable guest short of a maniac
      with a meat-axe.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The bell-boys had one way of revenge for underpayment and
      over-work. Drinks of rye served in a bedroom, as frequently
      they were, over card-games, cost twenty cents a drink; and
      a dollar bottle of rye furnished from ten to twelve
      drinks--and late at night, fifteen. The oldest bellboy
      invented an interesting device of buying a new bottle at
      the bar and paying for it, on pretence that it was for a
      guest, then hiding it in an empty room and from it serving
      the separate drinks in the bedrooms, at a profit of one to
      two dollars. He generously gave the idea to his colleagues;
      two of them adopted it, with cheers, but Myron balked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's grafting,' he complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure it is. Don't they graft on us? The way they pay
      us--telling us when we signed on what a whale of a lot of
      tips we'd get, and then about one lone dime a day from
      these cheap pikers! And the room and grub we get! Anything
      we can hold out on this joint belongs to us,' explained the
      senior bell-boy, who got fifty cents a week extra, and the
      title of Captain free.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know--I know--but it's bad practice. If we don't like it
      here, we ought to get out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'F' Christ's sake, Weagle, do <i>you</i> like it here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you can learn a lot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The hell with that! I've done my learning. Say, I went
      clear through eighth grade and had prett' near a whole year
      in high school! I've done my learning! So you won't come in
      with us! Getting religious on us, are you? Our little
      Y.M.C.A. secretary! Our cute Sunday-school teacher!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The senior bell-boy meant by 'religious' something like
      'moral', Myron decided. Naturally, at eighteen, there is no
      accusation so grievous as that of morality and general
      priggishness. Myron didn't want to be anything like that.
      He didn't want to be moral. He spoke very evilly of
      morality to the senior bell-boy. He asserted that he was a
      practising hellion; probably about the worst young fellow
      that the senior bell-boy had ever met. He hinted that he
      drank like a cart-horse and was a menace to all women. But
      he could not graft on the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even to himself he could not explain it. The word 'loyalty'
      was not yet in his vocabulary--which was, perhaps, just as
      well, for within a couple of decades 'loyalty' was to be
      altogether too much in the vocabularies of all
      luncheon-club inspiration-merchants. It was just . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, thunder!' he writhed, trying to get it straight. 'I'd
      of been sore if I'd caught Jock McCreedy knocking down even
      ten cents on us at the American House. Even if he did think
      we gave him a raw deal--which I bet Pa did, sometimes! I
      guess I'm a fool not to do the Romans like the Romans do.
      But I'll be everlastingly doggone hornswoggled if I'll get
      ahead by dirty little grafts, even if I never do get to the
      top. . . . But I will!'
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to Torrington, in September, Myron again
      stalked into the Eagle Hotel and asked the manager for a
      job.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Coram demanded, 'Aren't you the young chap that was
      here early this summer?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you propose to keep on coming around here bothering me
      till I do give you a job?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What can you do around an hotel?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Everything, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. Oh, no. There's only one man in any hotel that can do
      everything, front office or back of the house, and that's
      the manager. At least, that's the theory. And
      unfortunately, son, the manager's job here seems to be
      taken. So I'm afraid there's nothing for you. Besides. Why
      don't you start some easy career, while you're young,
      instead of taking up hotel-keeping, which means having to
      stand for all the meanest cranks just when they're away
      from home and at their meanest? You seem a wide-awake young
      fellow. Take up something comparatively easy--say deep-sea
      diving or Arctic exploration. Sorry there's not a thing for
      you. <i>Good morning!'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron lived luxuriously on his summer's savings, $18.65,
      with lovely long hours of sleep, for the two and a half
      weeks before he found the job of assistant night cook at
      the Bijou Lunch-Wagon--Never Closes, in Torrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being eighteen, he found working all night at the
      lunch-wagon exciting. He felt like a man grown, to stay up
      through the forbidden hours. There was mystery in the
      shadowed alleys, the still street lamps, the huddled
      hurrying figures of strangers by night, and dawn was
      freshest and most grateful when it came after a trance not
      of snoozing but of back-break over a low gas-range, in the
      fumes of frying. His customers had a leisure unknown in the
      busy day, and they were odd people, phantoms of the
      night--the two town policemen, the Eagle Hotel 'bus-driver
      who had been a sailor, stray hoboes with a precious dime,
      and furtive travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He learned nothing much here save to be cheery when his
      eyes were gummed with smoke and sleepiness, and the craft
      of lightning cookery--cracking open an egg and frying it
      in, apparently, ten seconds after the order had been given.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much drawling gossip at the Bijou. One night in
      January the Eagle 'bus-driver confided that the meat-cook
      at the Eagle was 'getting through', because he had a better
      job in Hartford.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning, at nine, after an hour and a half of sleep,
      Myron was in the office of Mr. Coram.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Lord, I suppose I'll have to give you the job to get
      rid of you. But can you do it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir. Been cooking at the Bijou Lunch-Wagon since
      September.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's not roasting and boiling. Lunch-wagon! Huh! Short
      orders! Ham and eggs! Hamburger steak! Fried spuds on the
      side and make it snappy! Lunch-wagon! This is an
      <i>hotel,</i> young man.' Mr. Coram spoke proudly. He was
      forty-two years old, and he had worked in hotels for
      thirty-one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Done lots of roasting and boiling and so on, sir. American
      House, Black Thread. Mother's cook there. Helped her on
      everything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, all right, I suppose I'll have to try you, so you'll
      get it out of your system and have the sense to go back
      home. I'll start you at thirty a month, and board and
      laundry. You'll have to hire your own room. When can you
      come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Week from to-morrow, sir--week's notice at the
      lunch-wagon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right. Be here at 6.45 in the morning. By the way: of
      course you have your own white jackets and aprons and cap
      and light overalls? And your own knives and cleavers?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the only lie of our young moralist, and it was no
      longer a lie when he reported for work. He had spent every
      penny he had saved, along with five dollars borrowed from
      his mother, for his kit.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the first morning he was in a panic. They'd find him
      out--he was merely a brat who knew nothing about cooking.
      He was quiveringly polite and anxious when he met the head
      cook (rarely called 'chef' except by himself), who was a
      dried codfish from New Hampshire, named Clint Hosea.
    </p>
    <p>
      By noon he perceived that though the Eagle Hotel kitchen
      was twice as large as that of the American House, and
      served three or four times as many people, the food was of
      about the same dreariness, and no more than Mother Weagle
      did Clint Hosea ever do anything so revolutionary as to
      study a cook-book. Neither of them had tried any new dish
      these ten years. By night Myron was confident, and
      rejoicing in the fact that, though he was not exactly over
      them, the kitchen maid who peeled vegetables and cleaned
      floors, the proud lady dishwasher, and the waitresses all
      received less wages than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two years, Myron worked for the Eagle Hotel, and
      several times Mr. Coram gave him a two-for cigar, and once
      a slight rise in wages.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had learned the carving of cooked meat from his father.
      His difficulty was cutting up the raw material, for he was
      butcher as well as meat-cook. But he had the originality to
      study the diagrams for dissecting unfortunate beasts, as
      given in any cook-book, and evenings he gave voluntary help
      at a butcher shop with whose proprietor he had been
      friendly at the Bijou Lunch.

    </center>
    <p>
      Neither the Weagles, Clint Hosea, nor any of the three
      bell-boys with whom Myron had worked at the Fandango Inn
      knew that there were such things in the world as hotel
      periodicals. Mr. Coram subscribed to the weekly <i>Hotel
      Era,</i> but he rarely read any of it save the gossip that
      Jack Barley, 'the well-known and ever-popular chief clerk
      of the Memphis-Corona, has accepted a corresponding
      position in that ever-popular establishment, the Tartley,
      of Chicago, and his many friends and well-wishers all over
      the south are wishing him every success in his new position
      and predicting for him an ever enlarging career as a
      Boniface', and that 'M. Wilson Stewkey, Mine Host of the
      Hoamfrumhoam Villa, in bustling and beautiful Jax, Fla., is
      planning an extensive three-weeks' tour of the West Indies
      with his missus. Bum voyadj, as the Frogs say, Bill.' (This
      was almost a generation before hotel trade-journals became
      less jolly and along with personals featured such articles
      as a treatise on 'The Norm in Kilowatt Production in
      Independent Hotel Plants', which could be readily
      understood by any manager with authoritative knowledge of
      graphs, differential calculus, thermo-dynamics, and
      electrical engineering.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron saw the <i>Era</i> in Mr. Coram's office, and he was
      excited. That was a fine idea! A publication all about
      hotel-keeping, from which he could become acquainted with
      managers and chefs and stewards all over the country, from
      which he could learn about new recipes and kitchen-ranges
      and material for sheets, about silver-polishing machines
      and bottle-openers and linoleum for floors. He subscribed
      for the <i>Hotel Era</i> with the money he had been saving
      for new shoes--a bold and doubtful piece of adventure,
      since kitchen work is even harder on the feet than
      store-clerking or being a colonel of infantry or any like
      proletarian occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <i>Era</i> he found an advertisement of a book
      called <i>The Steward's Handbook and Dictionary,</i> by
      Jessup Whitehead, and rather doubtfully he sent for it. The
      book had first been published in 1887; in 1899, when Myron
      discovered it, it was still an authority, and well into a
      twentieth century that was to be anaemic with 'scientific
      diets' the handbook carried rich savours from a time when
      citizens, not yet being much afflicted by time-saving
      machinery, considered time not as something just to be
      fanatically saved, but to be devoted to eating,
      hymn-singing, and laughter. Beside it, the contemporary
      manuals of the 1930's on the preparation of canned clam
      juice and sandwiches of cream cheese and walnuts look
      pallid and vomitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Myron found his Book of Words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitehead was to him what an anthology of Shelley, Milton,
      Chaucer, Byron, Swinburne, and the lyrics of Lewis Carroll
      would have been to a young poet who, reared in the sticks,
      had never seen any verse save Longfellow and Bryant.
      Opening it, Myron felt like some watcher of the skies when
      a new planet swims into his ken, like a scientist with his
      first microscope, a youthful capitalist with his first
      dollar. Whitehead revealed to him all the succulences of
      eating, the perfections of service, the elegancies of
      table-decoration which he had, without ever seeing them,
      vaguely known must exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for himself did Myron Weagle desire these juicy dishes,
      these tables fantastic with glass and silver. All his life,
      though he was, as a scientist, curious to taste new dishes,
      for his own daily fare he preferred toast and cold chicken
      and a glass of milk, eaten on a corner of a kitchen table,
      in a surrounding of busy cookery. But he had the instinct
      to provide them for other people. Why he should have had
      that instinct, why he should want to provide too-rich food
      for too-rich people, is as much a mystery as why other,
      more verbal poets, should actually desire to provide rich
      and smoking sonnets for unknown readers.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For many months Myron read Whitehead every evening in his
      narrow, straw-matted furnished room, and every luxurious
      half hour of loafing between crises of bending over reeking
      broilers and stew-pans. He saw and seized the world not
      only of Waldorfs and Tremonts and St. Charleses, but of
      hotels in London and Paris and Berlin as well. He was as
      fascinated by it as any newly rich guest first staying in a
      Grand International Royal Hotel, with the difference that
      Myron, unlike the parvenu, knew that gorgeous tables are
      not entirely evolved in the brains of affable super-gents
      in morning clothes, equipped with gardenias, in the
      panelled Front Office, but by sweaty cooks in overalls, an
      agitated steward in shirt-sleeves, and a panting crew of
      helpers in that hidden, humble, greasy, all-important mass
      of dens, the Back of the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The handbook quoted the menu of an Italian dinner given to
      Sr. Salvini. What more swagger language could there be,
      yearned Myron, than 'Animelle di Vitello alla Minuta con
      Tartuffi' or 'Ravioli al Brodo' or 'Zabbaglione'? He had no
      notion what they meant, but weren't they simply lovely
      words?
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when he learned from the handbook's dictionary of
      dishes that they were only veal and paste and beaten eggs
      and wine, he was yet not disappointed. Mighty nice things,
      he reflected, you could do with eggs and paste and veal;
      grand noble dishes to rejoice the stomach of mankind and
      make a hotel famous.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other literary novelties in the steward's
      handbook. The menu of a dinner given by an association of
      travelling-men in New York was 'written in imitation of a
      railroad ticket, with coupon attachments, to be read from
      bottom to top', and it displayed with each course
      quotations from the choicest poets. With the chicken and
      terrapin there was somewhat cryptically quoted, 'This
      lapwing runs away with the shell on her head', and with the
      liqueurs, 'Spirits, which by mine art I have from their
      confines call'd to enact my present fancies'.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Pink Dinner, in Washington, had fairy lamps with pink
      shades, cheese sticks tied with pink ribbons, and 'menus
      printed on broad pink satin ribbon, fringed at either end,
      and bearing at the top the name of the guest for whom it
      was intended'.
    </p>

      This thirty-dollar-a-month meat-cook, aged nineteen, was
      exhilarated by reading about 'a tropical dinner given by a
      wealthy man, which cost $175.00 a cover, exclusive of wine
      and music. The table was arranged around a miniature lake,
      in which palms, lilies and ferns appeared to be growing,
      while tropical trees rose from the banks amid miniature
      parterres of flowers. Small electric lights, with
      varicoloured globes, were arranged about the lake, and by a
      unique arrangement electricity was introduced under the
      water of the lake and caused to dance about in imitation of
      varicoloured fish. A beautiful palm-leaf fan was placed on
      the table before each guest, and on these the plates
      rested.'

      'Golly, it would be nice to have a chance to fix a spread
      like that, without having to worry about the amount of
      butter you used,' thought Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he felt envy or any irritation at this superb example of
      Conspicuous Waste, he did not know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more enticing to the folly of the young poet were the
      decorated dishes at the renowned reception given by the
      first ducal Mrs. Vanderbilt: '. . . a game pie of pheasants
      resting on a flat surface of wax, the entire piece upheld
      with deer's antlers. Underneath were two rabbits playing
      cards, while to the side of the players was a bridge, under
      which gleamed a lake of water with goldfish swimming about.
      One of the most artistic pieces was a two-foot salmon,
      resting in a wax boat, while on the back of the fish sat a
      cupid; the boat was supported by a Neptune at each end,
      seated in sea shells and driving sea horses before them. A
      fine piece was a flying Mercury poised upon a ham, finely
      ornamented with a delicate tracing of truffles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gosh almighty!' breathed Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      And menus presenting ortolans!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not quite sure what sort of a bird an ortolan was,
      but it sounded far-off and romantic. When he read in the
      dictionary of the handbook a quotation from some casual
      European chef to the effect that 'ortolans should not be
      killed with violence, like other birds, as this might crush
      and bruise the delicate flesh--to avoid which the usual
      mode is to plunge the head of the ortolan into a glass of
      brandy', then he felt sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to him, as he sat tilted back against the bed in a
      hard straight chair in his little bedroom, that all the
      animals and birds he cooked had to be slaughtered,
      bloodily, messily, cruelly; that the veal which some
      red-faced, grunting guest slobbered over came from a
      soft-eyed calf that had come frisking up to the butcher and
      had its head instantly crushed with a sledge hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He forgot it, then, as the medical student forgets the
      dissecting-room with its cold hacked corpses, as all young
      and ambitious men forget--for else they could not endure
      living--the perpetual horror and cruelty of the world.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had read in his handbook for many weeks before he
      dared to criticize it . . . the young poet had long read
      his Milton before it came to him to wonder whether there
      may not be some thumpingly dull passages in <i>Paradise
      Lost.</i> In his Book of Words Myron found the menu of an
      annual game dinner given by Mr. John B. Drake, once the
      dean of Chicago hotel-men, to the dignitaries of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were one hundred and fourteen items, including (for
      this must have been given back in the '80's, when such
      frenzied novelties still existed) ham of black bear, leg of
      mountain sheep, buffalo tongue, saddle of antelope,
      opossum, woodchuck, wild turkey, killdeer, plover, Wilson
      snipe, sandhill crane, Gadwall and canvas-back and red-bill
      Merganser ducks, American widgeon, red-necked grebe, Dunlin
      sandpiper, red-winged starling, and scores of equally
      fantastic prey. For the first three or four readings, he
      was awed. The poet was privileged to peep through glass at
      a volume of sonnets, printed in gold on blue-dyed vellum
      and bound in scarlet silk--and suddenly his common sense
      flashed out and he wanted it bound in morocco and printed
      in honest black on decent white!
    </p>
    <p>
      'This darn bill of fare is a darn sight too darn long!' he
      protested, feeling reckless. 'Too darn much is bad as not
      enough. Take a fellow, say he has ten dishes out of all
      this; still he'll see all these others that he didn't get,
      and be sore, and feel he just hasn't had anything. When I
      own an hotel, I'm going to keep the bill of fare small and
      everything awful good!'
    </p>
    <p>
      With a pencil he cut fifty-two items out of the hundred and
      fourteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And still it's too big,' he sighed. 'But anyway, I've
      saved some money for Mr. Drake and not hurt his party! Hope
      he remembers it on my steward's salary! . . . I wonder what
      the deuce American widgeon is? I wonder if I'll ever taste
      it? I'm going to taste an awful lot of curious new things,
      in a lot of curious new places, before I get through!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The appendix to Whitehead's handbook was a section entitled
      'How to Fold Napkins, with Many Handsome Styles and
      Diagrams Which Show How It is Done'. At that period, the
      great restaurants and hotel dining-rooms were prouder of
      nothing than of tortuously twisted napkins, stiff and white
      and tall, in files on the long tables, and in this appendix
      were revealed the secrets of the greatest conjurors in
      napkin-folding. There was the 'chestnut pocket', making
      four pockets to be stuffed with nuts; the 'mitre' with its
      centre and horns; the 'double horn of plenty', whose folds
      were to be filled with flowers, the 'bridal serviette',
      which looked like a model of a four-story decagonal
      building, and such spirited modelling in stiff linen as
      'the heraldic rose and star', 'the fleur-de-lis', and 'the
      colonne de triomphe'.
    </p>
    <p>
      They seemed, after the simple cocked hats which decorated
      the American House and the Eagle Hotel, like the
      masterpieces of a napkinate Michael Angelo. Myron gaped at
      the sketches of their frosty beauty. And here was something
      he could do with his fingers, forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to start cooking Filet Mignapour aux
      Truffes et aux Champignons with the resources of the Eagle
      Hotel kitchen, but napkins were napkins, and filching half
      a dozen of the Sunday Dinner best ones from the pantry,
      Myron began trying to erect a 'Hamburg drum'. It is quite
      simple, if you know how. 'Fold the serviette in half
      lengthways. Turn down the corners, fold it in half across
      the centre, inwards, from A to B, keeping the corners
      inside. Fold it again from C to D, let down the point E,
      turn down the corners F and G to make a triangle. . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfectly straightforward and simple. Yet Myron sweated
      over it for quarter-hours, till his chair was surrounded by
      piles of crumpled napkins and the head waiter came in to
      stare, bellow, and complain, 'What in hell are you doing
      with my clean napkins, you damn pot-walloper?'
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Myron tried it at home, with stiff paper as a
      substitute for linen . . . a tall, rangy young man, with
      rope-coloured hair, sitting in a stale furnished room with
      his small chair drawn up to the bed, patiently folding
      paper for hours, solemnly, with the tip of his tongue in
      the corner of his mouth. In a fortnight he could do even
      such intricate jewel-work as 'the Victoria Regia',
      'Mercury's cap', 'the swan', and 'the lorgnettes', and felt
      himself prepared to meet any dining-room crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      For did not Whitehead himself say, 'Hotel napkin
      folding--an art worth more than foreign languages. There is
      nothing a waiter can do, if a stranger in a strange place,
      that will so quickly give him introductions and
      acquaintances as to take a dozen sheets of stiff white
      paper and with them execute the finer patterns shown in
      this book and set them up for display. They attract
      attention at once and prove better than a letter of
      introduction for a young man seeking employment, and
      fortunately, this useful art is far easier to learn than a
      foreign language.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron saw himself studying the innkeeper's art all over the
      world, able to get instant and agreeable employment in
      Egypt, China, Finland, or Wales by setting up for display
      his sculptures in linen or stiff white paper. He'd do it.
      And by and by . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose, he reflected, he were a waiter in Claridge's in
      London, and the head waiter dashed into the pantry just
      before a banquet to Royalty, clapping his hands to his brow
      and moaning, 'Who amongst you, my waiters, can fold an
      "Imperial crown"?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The other waiters would flinch and stand dumb, while Myron
      Weagle, from distant America, would step forward and say
      modestly, 'I can, sir.' And next day he would be made a
      captain of waiters, on his way to becoming steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was getting into exalted society. He read in the
      handbook that the Earl Cadogan (hm! that was a slicker name
      for a lord than any he had encountered in the few novels he
      had read) had given a dinner at Chelsea House to
      forty-eight, including the Kings of Denmark, Greece, and
      Belgium, the Crown Princes of Sweden, Austria, and
      Portugal, the Prince and Princess of Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      In waking dreams Myron saw that feast. What would kings be
      like in private life? Did they wear dress suits, or
      uniforms plastered all over with gold lace and medals? The
      King of Greece, now; Myron was sure he had a half-moon of
      black moustache, the Crown Prince of Portugal had black
      whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiters were leaning over them, reverentially
      murmuring, 'Sure, Your Majesty, I'll hustle in another side
      order of peas right away'. And perhaps Claridge's had lent
      that clever captain of waiters, Myron Weagle, the American,
      to the Earl Cadogan for his dinner, and Weagle was standing
      quietly but authoritatively back by the big--buffet, would
      it be? and was Chelsea House a private home or a London
      hotel?--but anyway: he stood back there quietly, but his
      eagle eye never missed a single miscue of the waiters, and
      afterwards, when they were smoking fifty-cent cigars and
      drinking big goblets of brandy, one of the kings said to
      Earl Cadogan (that <i>was</i> his title and not his first
      name, wasn't it?)--he said, 'Earl, I want to congratulate
      you on that dandy head waiter you had here to-night. He
      knows service like I know my throne. Never missed a trick.
      Don't suppose I could get him for my palace, do you? I'd
      make him a Sir, and give him a swell house of his own.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And during the dinner a princess had whispered to her
      neighbour, 'Who <i>is</i> that tall, handsome man with the
      blond hair standing back there by the sideboard? Isn't he
      one of the guests? Why don't he sit down with us?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron studied the dinner which (according to Whitehead) he
      had caused to be served for the Earl Cadogan. It included
      Whitebait, Cotelettes d'Agneau Duchesse, Chaudfroid de
      Cailles aux Truffes, Poulardes aux Pruneaux, Filets Piqués
      froids Sauce Cumberland, Ortolans sur Canapes, Bavaroise à
      la Montreuil, Soufflés de Fraises, Croustades aux Fromages.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a mere list of things to guzzle. It was the
      Catalogue of Ships. It was the recitative of names that
      were fourteen sweet symphonies. It was, to Myron Weagle,
      poetry with Sauce Cumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not much like cornbeef and cabbage and fried pork chop and
      apple sauce,' he sighed, and, 'I wonder if they had any of
      the chow resting in wax boats with cupids on it?' and then,
      violently, 'American widgeon me eye!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Along with the wax cupid nonsense and menus on pink ribbon,
      he stored away solid notions from Whitehead, Ranhofer of
      Delmonico's, Monselet, Brillat-Savarin, and from hotel
      magazines. These he clipped and rustled and sputtered over
      with the air of an earnest beaver. He knew at least the
      names and ingredients of a thousand dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it had, like all other poetic frenzies, the
      disadvantage of alarming more prosaic souls. When he
      prepared an experimental dish of mutton cutlets and brought
      it proudly to Clint Hosea, boasting, 'Taste this. I think
      it would be swell to serve. It's with Sauce Béarnaise! I
      made it!' the sardonic Yankee cook piped, 'It's with what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sauce Béarnaise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And will you tell me what the hell Sauce Bernice may be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, there's white wine vinegar, and young onions--couldn't
      get shallots--and beef extract and egg yolks and herbs. . .
      .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take it away. Taste it, hell! Want to poison me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, could I make it with some Sauce Duchesse then, and
      just try it once and see if the guests like it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You could not! We don't want any Bernice sauce or any
      Dutch sauce or any other kind of crazy Dago sauce! You put
      some decent brown gravy on it, like any other cook ought
      to, and get out of this and don't bother me. You know what
      I think? What's the matter with you? <i>You been reading
      books!'</i>
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      During his first year at the Eagle Hotel, Myron slowly
      built up his plan of preparing himself for managership. He
      would try out every job in the establishment, and be
      intimate with every member of the staff. It was not too
      easy. There are more castes in an hotel than in India, and
      no Gandhi to starve himself. The Front Office looked down
      on the Back of the House as scullions, and the Back of the
      House observed frequently and publicly that the young men
      in the Front Office wore ragged underclothes beneath their
      natty gents' suitings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron saw to it that when he met one of the bell-boys or
      the majestic clerks, at a soda-fountain or a pool-room or
      anywhere in the looser and more adventurous atmosphere
      outside the hotel, he should be polite but friendly. He
      feigned respect for their Front Office opinions of guests
      and of psychology in general which, after years in the
      American House and the Fandango Inn, he certainly did not
      feel. He was even attentive to the Eagle night-clerk, a
      notorious crab who, the Back of the House believed and
      stated, would never have been able to hold his job unless
      he 'had something on' Mr. Coram.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night-clerk was one of the jacks in office, common in
      the hotel-world before 1915 but demoted to the poor-house
      in the days of competition since then, who were proud of
      'never taking nothing from no "fresh" guests'. They have
      been replaced by the 'Greeter', who chants thirty times a
      day the first Beatitude of American hotel-keeping: 'Blessed
      is the Guest, for he is always right'. None of the
      Greeters, of course, are such idiots as to believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Eagle night-clerk boasted, as he sat in one of the tall
      thrones along the wall of the pool-room, that whenever any
      'damn tightwad crank of a guest that's trying to let on
      what an important gazebo he is' complained about anything
      whatever--missing baggage or sour coffee, an unmade bed or
      a room without soap or the fact that he had not been called
      at seven, as promised--he 'just looked the guy straight in
      the face and told him, "Well, I'll tell you, brother. Of
      course you're used to chumming around with the Astors and
      Vanderbilts and having a vallay to look after you, but this
      is just a rube hotel for common folks like me, and I guess
      you'll have to put up with our hick ways till you can get
      back to your suite at the Hoffman House!" Say! Maybe those
      fourflushers don't look cheap when they meet a real
      <i>man</i> behind the desk, and he's got the nerve and the
      savvy to show 'em up!'
    </p>
    <p>
      To him Myron listened with peculiar attention. He was more
      useful to Myron than Whitehead's handbook; he so perfectly
      explained what not to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a large Front Office: Mr. Coram, who was chief
      clerk as well as manager, two other day-clerks, of whom one
      was also book-keeper and cashier and attendant on the
      cigar-counter, the night-clerk, a porter who cleaned the
      floors, two bell-boys, and three bartenders. But Myron
      studied them, found as many exciting and curious quirks in
      their ways of meeting guests and kitchen-hands as though
      they were an entire regiment. He was Jane Austen in a
      tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clint Hosea, the cook, particularly scorned the Front
      Office, including Mr. Coram. They were, he said, a bunch of
      cheap dudes whose mothers were all washerwomen or members
      of even less honoured professions. He composed dreadful
      scandals about them, cackling, as he shoved a dish of
      baking apples into the oven, that the 'grouch of a
      night-clerk had been thrown out of a bedroom at midnight,
      turned right out, bang! on his ear, by the little
      grass-widow up in 57'; that it was he, Mr. Hosea, and not
      Mr. Coram, who made up the bills of fare every day; that
      Myron was sucking around that gang of softies because he
      hoped to be invited to Mr. Coram's suite and steal his
      whisky; and that, as a consequence of his social climbing,
      Myron didn't know corn-beef from roast duckling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Myron persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      By coming to the kitchen at five-thirty in the
      morning--though he had a thirteen-hour trick of his own,
      from 6.45 a.m. to 7.45 p.m., with an hour's loaf in
      mid-afternoon--he was able by helping the baker-pastry-cook
      to learn bread, rolls, and cakes, even vast ornamental
      cakes in the elegant forms of ships and castles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cultivated the supercilious head waiter, who daily
      informed the world that he had worked in no less a city
      than Pittsburgh. He learned from the head waiter and from
      the older waitresses all the subtle and ancient technique
      of waiting: the setting of a table, from which side to
      serve, the proprieties of dress jackets and aprons,
      remembering six orders at once, polishing silverware,
      washing salt-cellars, moulding butter and all the other
      details of 'side work', tactfully keeping cranks out of the
      seats preferred by regular boarders, with what dishes to
      serve mustard, how to open champagne, and, more weighty,
      how to open boiled eggs, and, profoundest of all, how to
      smile so flatteringly upon mean customers that they would
      leave a respectable tip. (Such is the low custom of
      waiters, showing them to be as menial as physicians
      flattering their patients, lawyers flattering their
      clients, authors flattering editors, announcers flattering
      the vast radio audience, merchants flattering the good
      taste of their customers, college-presidents flattering the
      board of regents, senators flattering everybody--all of
      them making certain of their tips.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Initiated into this wisdom, Myron tried to get taken on as
      temporary waiter for evening banquets. It was difficult.
      Everyone, even the alert Mr. Coram, was astonished by such
      eccentricity, and Clint Hosea, that baked-bean philosopher,
      heir to Emerson and Jonathan Edwards, remarked, 'What I
      always say is, a cook is a cook and a waiter is a waiter,
      and there ain't no two ways about it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But in an emergency or two, at a wedding reception and at
      the dinner of the Northern Connecticut Izaak Walton and
      Annual Re-stocking Association, Myron was permitted to try
      his hand. The head waiter was exasperated to discover that
      Myron had already bought a waiter's uniform for himself,
      and that there was nothing else for which he could rebuke
      this presumptuous scullion who had come out of the smoke
      into the refined airs of the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      After his two years at the Eagle, Myron went--with an
      agreeable farewell to Mr. Coram, who sighed, 'I wish we
      could afford to keep you here, son'--as meat-cook to New
      Haven, to the Connecticut Inn, which was almost a really
      good hotel, with a hundred rooms and occasional interesting
      food and guests who shaved daily. There were men waiters,
      and lunch instead of dinner was served at noon, which
      seemed to Myron very urban and fashionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a year and three-quarters in New Haven, he had risen
      to the colonelcy of second-cook, and sometimes he was
      permitted to go to the open markets and help the steward
      buy meats and fowl and vegetables. But he went mad again,
      and informed the steward and the head waiter that, like a
      prototype of Colonel Lawrence of Arabia, he wanted to chuck
      his commission and re-enlist, as a regular waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was twenty-two, no longer a boy and a butt in the steamy
      back caverns of the hotel, but esteemed as an excellent
      cook who, with no jeers now from the chef, did conjuring
      tricks not only with his early loves, Béarnaise and
      Duchesse sauces, but with half a hundred--Bordelaise,
      Cumberland, Poivrade, Admiral, Sainte-Menehould, Raifort,
      Espagnole, Cardinal, Nantaise, Niçoise, romantic names
      which he crooned to himself--mispronouncing them badly--as
      he sifted and stirred. The bustling steward admired, 'I
      wonder where an upstate boy like that ever learned so many
      flavours!' It never came to the steward that all of Myron's
      magic, like precocious success in many other occupations,
      consisted in looking up the recipes in a book and having
      the remarkable energy to try them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      They besought him, now, not to give up his career, not to
      'monkey with the buzz-saw'. The steward remarked, 'Way I
      figure it, a cook is a cook and a waiter is a waiter and no
      sense trying to be both, and that's all there is to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron insisted, and became a waiter, newest and least in
      his watch, making, with wages and tips, one-quarter his
      salary as second-cook. So he stopped smoking cigars, took
      to cigarettes, and was content as he learned every strategy
      of table-waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had sufficiently mastered it so that he did not
      have to worry over broken dishes and unchilled celery, he
      began, through articles in hotel magazines and by snooping
      about the Inn between hours, to study the storekeeper's
      systems of keeping track of the receipt and issuance of
      hotel supplies, the housekeeper's inventory of linen and
      soap and curtains, the office's record of bills payable,
      the hundred ways in which the checker and cashier can keep
      the waiters from socializing the money paid by guests, and
      the three or four ways of keeping the checker and cashier
      from doing the socializing themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he too weary after working all day and studying all
      evening?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is any poet weary or dolorous when he sits up till dawn
      over a newly come parcel of books?

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When Myron first went to the Connecticut Inn, New Haven, he
      remembered Herbert Lambkin of Black Thread Centre, now a
      Senior in Yale College. It seemed a thoughtful sort of
      thing to go visit with him. Wasn't Herbert the brother of
      Julia--with whom, Myron recalled in an amused, mature way,
      he had had some kind of boyish flirtation--the brother also
      of that golden-haired and most tot-like tot, little Effie
      May? Hadn't they played catch together, and jovially
      pretended, in the halcyon days, to be fighting? Why
      certainly! He'd give good old Bert a treat by calling on
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Mr. Herbert Lambkin living in no extraordinary
      luxury in the old dormitory called 'South Middle'. He
      clattered up the hollowed wooden steps and knocked briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come . . . in', sighed a thin and discouraged voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron threw the door open on a rather dirty room with a cot
      bed, a broken-backed revolving chair before a desk heaped
      with black-smeared textbooks and copies of that racy
      periodical of the day, <i>The Standard,</i> a bureau which
      looked irredeemably second-hand--as though it had been
      second-hand even when it was new. The only luxury was a
      window-seat cushion upholstered in gaudy imitation-Oriental
      cretonne portraying Burmese temples, Egyptian camels,
      Sinhalese elephants, Tangier dancing girls, and Florida
      palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the mess stood a young man whom Myron
      barely recognized as Herbert Lambkin, so tall and weedy and
      unhealthily pale had he become, and so thickly spectacled.
      He wore decayed trousers and a sweater.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!' Herbert whined; and 'Oh, you're Weagle, aren't you?
      How are you?' But Herbert did not sound as though he really
      cared how Myron was.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sure--Myron Weagle! Long time since I've seen you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh. Yes. Wel--have a chair! Have two chairs!' This was
      advanced collegiate humour, in 1901, and possibly in 1931.
      'What are you doing in New Haven, Weagle?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm working here. Got a job in the Connecticut Inn.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh. What doing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the kitchen--I'm meat-cook.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the kitchen!' Herbert's giggle was at once high-pitched
      and harsh. He looked as though he were still being jocular
      as he observed, 'I rather thought I smelled grease, when
      you came in!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You did <i>not!</i> I've got on a new suit of clothes and
      had a real barber-shop bath!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh well, my dear fellow, why be ashamed of it? Nice
      wholesome scent, kitchen grease. No doubt it's much more
      fragrant than the odour of printer's ink and the midnight
      lamp, such as afflicts a poor scholar like myself! And your
      mother was a cook, too. Interesting example of heredity!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was too angry to talk, even to grunt affirmative
      interest, while with heavy airiness Herbert discoursed on
      the pleasures of being a Son of Old Eli, on his success in
      getting third prize in the Matthew Twitchell Competition in
      Greek Prosody, on his remarkably close friendship with Stub
      Van Vrump, the scion of no less a family than the
      prehistoric Van Vrumps of Washington Square, and on the
      probability that he, Herbert, would study law and with no
      considerable delay become United States Senator from
      Connecticut.
    </p>
    <p>
      His confidences were interrupted by the arrival of two of
      his friends, apparently class-mates. Myron, from a certain
      experience as junior hotel-keeper, sized them up as being
      amiable, less boastful than Herbert, rather poor, and of
      the most minor ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had always been reputed throughout Connecticut that all
      'Yale men' were young gods, with athletic prowess and
      awe-inspiring wealth. Myron now perceived that they were
      extraordinarily like human beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newcomers were agreeable enough to him in their
      greetings, but non-committal, waiting to see what manner of
      non-collegiate heathen he might prove to be. While he wore
      his clothes better than any of them, and was vastly easier
      in manner, he occasionally said 'He don't', and that
      puzzled them. Herbert was patently alarmed lest they learnt
      that this fellow who dared call him 'Bert' was a
      pot-keeler. He turned his back on Myron, and with shrill
      false excitement drew his class-mates into a discussion of
      one 'Bill' and his chances of 'making' the football team.
      Myron, in growing fury, sat apart on the window-seat,
      bumping the base of it with irritably swinging foot, not
      understanding a word of what they said. He looked out the
      window, aware of the peace and dignity of the campus, with
      the famous Fence in the shadow of the elms, and hated the
      arrogance of that unearned peace. He endured his
      humiliation for five minutes, then popped up, considered
      punching Herbert's long nose, dismissed it, said curtly,
      'Must be running along', and marched out with no
      handshaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he did not hear Herbert's sneering laugh behind him, he
      imagined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for two years then, not till Ora came down from Black
      Thread to see him, did Myron ever step on the Yale campus
      again, and though he saw Herbert in the Connecticut Grill
      and on the street, he did not speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet if this Yankee Jude was obscure enough, he could not be
      awed into remaining so. And he was not bitter, as his
      father would have been. He was too good an hotel-man. He
      had had too much experience with hot and testy boss cooks
      on the one hand, and cold and testy guests on the other, to
      be shaken by any good, normal, human beastliness. He merely
      grunted, 'I'll show the Lambkins, some day!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Though sometimes, after having been imprisoned in the
      kitchen for all of a blue April day, he did hate the young
      gentlemen of Yale as he saw them sauntering, singing, free,
      passing the 'mucker', the townie, without a glance.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had turned from second-cook to waiter when Ora, now
      twenty, came down from Black Thread Centre, to view Yale,
      New Haven, and his brother, in the order named.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for a year had Myron been able to get leave and visit
      his family, and in the meantime he had convinced himself
      that he had not only admiration but noble affection for his
      younger brother, with his astonishing culture, his fancy
      and observation, and his ambition to climb beyond the
      tavern--all the qualities, in fact, Myron sighed, that he
      himself was too stupid and fussy ever to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora, commendably graduating from high school at seventeen,
      a year younger than Myron, had remained in Black Thread,
      cynically amusing himself with jobs which Myron considered
      unworthy of him, while doing what Tom Weagle described
      fondly as 'further pursuing his studies'. He had clerked in
      the American House, he had reported for the Black Thread
      <i>Star and Tidings</i> at a dollar and a half a column, he
      had been agent for a Hartford laundry company, for
      lightning rods, for Little Giant Sporting Tackle, and for
      Dr. Sibelius's World-Renowned Soaps, Facial Creams, and
      Flavouring Extracts. To the local banker, he had sold the
      first horseless carriage known in Black Thread, and he had
      had accepted by the <i>Christian Advocate</i> two poems
      entitled 'Baby's Bedtime Blessing' and 'The Woods Were
      God's First Temple'. Mother Weagle, astonished that her Ora
      had all this while been concealing such religious
      sentiments, began again to hope that he would turn out a
      preacher. She thought the poems were just lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora thought they were tripe, and he so expressed himself to
      the editor of the <i>Star and Tidings,</i> with the
      intimation that he had merely written them to sell, and
      that his own real poetry would deal exclusively with
      vampire women of dusky sunken eyes, strange sins, all
      articles that were scarlet-coloured, and the isles of
      Greece. Anyway, he explained to the Black Thread editor, he
      had received three-fifty apiece for the poems and they had
      taken him only half an hour each. Therefore he could, if he
      worked a ten-hour shift, make seventy dollars a day;
      conservatively, over twenty thousand dollars a year! Could
      do it right now!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was indignant when the editor sniffed, and he took these
      financial tidings home to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever he did, Ora went on living at the American House.
      Theoretically, he paid board, but on any given Saturday he
      found that just this particular week he was a little short
      of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to New Haven to investigate entering Yale. He felt
      a little overripe for it, at twenty, but somehow he must
      gather a much larger stock of beautiful words, so that he
      could write for <i>The Century</i> and get much more than
      three-fifty a poem--perhaps ten or twelve, which would make
      fifty thousand a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wore the latest thing in Black Thread pool-room clothes;
      a red-striped grey-green suit with lapels sticking out like
      the ears of a jackass, with pockets slashed diagonally, and
      the flaps decorated with large pearl buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was uncomfortable when he saw that garment
      conspicuously walking through the dingy hauteur of the old
      New Haven station. 'I wonder if I could get him into a nice
      quiet grey suit, without any thingamabobs on it,' he
      fretted. 'But better not try. Ora's so sort of fine and
      sensitive, he might have his feelings hurt.' And he
      welcomed his young brother with shouts of 'Well, well,
      well, well!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken an afternoon and evening off from the hotel.
      He conducted Ora through the metropolitan hustle of Church
      and Chapel Streets; showed him the wonders of the world
      from East Rock--where, on a bright day, you can look clear
      across to the alien, magic shore of Long Island--and
      finally, uneasily invading the preserves of the gentry,
      dragged him rapidly through the Yale Campus, pattering off,
      'Durfee Hall--dormitory; South Middle--dormitory--ver' old;
      Dwight Hall--Y.M.C.A.; Osborn Hall--rec'ta-tions--let's get
      out of this now and have a nice ice cream soda.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He escorted Ora to a real theatre that evening (it was the
      third time that Myron himself, with all his metropolitan
      experience, had ever been so extravagant and time-wasting)
      and they saw a splendid play called 'Midnight Villa', in
      which a Duke, who had a kind heart but lamentable habits as
      regards gambling, told his haughty family to go to hell,
      and married the lady secretary, instead of the thoroughly
      nasty Lady Montjoie. His Grace also shot a burglar, won a
      motor race at forty-five miles an hour (he did this off
      stage, but he came staggering on in a duster and goggles in
      the most convincing way), and saved the lady secretary's
      father from bankruptcy by presenting the old gentleman with
      his winnings at the Monte Carlo Casino that evening, which
      amounted to no less than a million francs. And at the end
      it proved that the father was really a Hungarian prince,
      characteristically in hard luck, and his daughter,
      therefore, a princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Golly!' sighed Ora, as they ate Bird's Nest Soup and New
      York Chop Suey, at a Chinese restaurant, after the play.
      'I'm going to Monte Carlo some day. Golly! That was an
      exciting play! Dandy acting! I'm going to write a play! A
      real highbrow Ibsen play . . . I wonder how much you get
      for a successful play on Broadway?'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In the room which Myron had taken for Ora on the same floor
      with his own in the rooming-house, Myron tried to make it
      clear, for communication at home, that though he was but a
      tyro waiter, he was doing well, really learning his trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      '. . . and I can run a crew of waiters, I think. I honestly
      believe I could do it right now, if I had to. It looks to
      me, unless I make another switch, say to the Front Office,
      that I'll be head waiter in some smaller hotel in another
      couple years, and then a steward in another three or four.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yuuuuuh, sure, I guess so,' yawned Ora. 'Just climbing
      like a dear lil chipmunk, aren't we! Learned how to cook
      fried rootalulas and then how to hustle the hash! Sure,
      you'll go right on crawling up. You'll be manager and chief
      cook and bottlewasher of some great big cockroach warehouse
      someday. Regular Horatio Alger story: "From Bell-Hop to
      Boss." Don't mind me. I'm just kidding. You've done
      swell--I guess. Well, I think I'll turn in now.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When they had explored the Yale Campus, Ora had insisted
      that they call on Herbert Lambkin who, after a year in Yale
      Law School, had decided that his talents were better suited
      to professing a subject called 'English Literature', which
      dealt with embalming and the revivification of mummies. He
      was staying on to acquire the priestly title of 'M.A.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had hesitated, 'Oh, we won't have time to-day. Maybe
      later.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The second day, Ora insisted again, and Myron blurted, 'No,
      I won't. Bert hasn't been very nice to me. Thinks he's too
      good for a waiter! Maybe he is, but I don't care so much
      for his showing it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right. Hell with him,' said Ora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had to return to work that second day, and Ora was
      left to wander by himself. When Myron took a tray of free
      lunch from the kitchen into the bar-room at five, he found
      Ora and Herbert Lambkin together, at the bar. They ignored
      him. As Myron left, they glanced at him and giggled. The
      back of his neck was rigid with wrath, but--oh, thunder,
      Ora was still a kid! He was the only brother Myron had. Ora
      didn't mean so bad; he was just heedless. He must keep his
      temper and try--after all these years of failure at it--to
      be really friends with the kid and to appreciate his
      wonderful ability at word-slinging and imagination and all
      like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not mention Herbert when Ora came to the
      rooming-house, at nine-thirty, to pack for the Black Thread
      train.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had a dandy day,' glowed Ora. 'Oh, I ran into Bert
      Lambkin--by accident. I agree with you about him. He's a
      cheap snob. Say, I got a raft of Yale catalogues and stuff
      to-day. Maybe I'll try to get into Yale next fall. How'd it
      be to have a real Yale Man in the family, ole man? Say, My,
      could you let me have twenty-five dollars till I get home?
      I'm kind of low just now. I'll shoot it right back to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When Myron next heard of him, Ora was a reporter on a
      Waterbury newspaper. Of his entering Yale, Myron heard as
      much as of his returning the twenty-five dollars.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It irritated Myron occasionally, occasionally it made him
      gloomy, to be that unheeded and automatic machine, a
      waiter, among the Yale students who frequented the
      Connecticut Grill where he often served in the evening and
      late afternoon, when the dining-room was closed. He liked
      being attentive to old, timid people, who were grateful for
      his help. He could even endure those pests the hotel
      children, the children of the 'permanents', with their
      golden ringlets, shrill voices, monstrous orders for
      sweets, and their assumption that everyone on the staff was
      not only a personal servant but filled with joy at being
      called on to entertain them--to bring them extra cakes, to
      let them ride in the elevator, to wash off doors the pencil
      marks they so playfully scrawled there. These he could
      endure, and the average middle-aged guest, travelling-man
      or other, was an amiable and friendly customer. But to be
      irrevocably a stranger among young men his own age, of not
      markedly better manners and of rather less curiosity about
      the mysteries which are supposed to be hidden in books, was
      to be an exile from the self-confidence of youth. They were
      most of them polite enough to him, these young gentlemen in
      tweeds and ties of shot silk who crooned 'Bingo' and 'Delta
      Kappa Upsilon' in corners, and talked actively of journeys
      to Europe, of polo, of week-ends at Northampton, or, at
      humblest, of sailing on the Sound, but after a hundred
      meetings, after he had even guided them out of the door and
      boosted them into cabs when they had had too much crème de
      menthe or pousse café, they still did not remember him. He
      could only meditate, 'Well, probably I'm better off than if
      I were a mechanic in Winchester's and never had a chance to
      meet any new kinds of folks and learn there are different
      ways of living', and again, with a growl like a hurt
      animal's, he would resolve, 'I'll show 'em all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Some day, when I'm manager of a whale of a big hotel and
      these boys are teaching school or clerking in a bank and
      forget they ever were swell Yale Men, it's going to be
      funny to watch 'em coming to me, trying to get friendly and
      hoping His Nibs, the Manager, will be so kind and let 'em
      have a cut rate. No idea they ever saw me before. It'll be
      funny then . . . Maybe it will.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The lonely and love-starved women living in the hotel were
      the greatest trial, and transport, of a stalwart young
      waiter. It has increasingly been the contention of
      novelists and psychologists that practically all of a man's
      emotion and secret thought are devoted to 'sex'. Probably
      this dogma is as false as the Victorian dogma that no
      respectable male ever thought of such matters, and
      invariably, when he happened to notice an unclad lady in
      his bedroom, did so only with dismayed surprise. It is to
      be observed that the citizens diligently given to
      amorousness are often anaemic and sedentary and adorned
      with lop-sided eyeglasses, while the deep-chested human
      gorillas, whether bond-salesmen, economists, or pugilists,
      are often known to flee chastely home to their wives on the
      5.57, and to spend more Sunday afternoons on golf and gin
      and balance-sheets than in dancing with the wives of
      neighbours. If this be heresy to the psychoanalysts, yet we
      have the authority of the Bolsheviks and the Baptists, who
      for once agree, in contending that a lusty male will be
      less devoted to lechery than to his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron Weagle was a vigorous young man, and certainly he had
      applied most of his thought to work, not dalliance. At
      twenty-three he was still a virgin. Yet he had trembled at
      the revelation of girls' ankles and throats on picnics, and
      in his yearning over Julia Lambkin he had, without
      admitting it to himself, longed for much more intimacy than
      just a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was first seduced, quite unromantically, by a meagre
      widow who went about the country 'demonstrating',
      advertising the virtues of Humming Bird Cake Flour by
      exhibitions of cookery in grocery shops, and who between
      campaigns lived at the Connecticut Inn . . . This was five
      years after Ora, at the age of sixteen, had made his first
      laboratory experiments with a German farm girl, the
      laboratory being a disused quarry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was sometimes drafted from the dining-room as a
      floor-waiter. He had taken a tray of breakfast to the
      demonstrating widow in Room 64. She was sitting up in bed.
      She was not enticing. Her face was like crumpled paper, but
      she had rouged extensively and put on a cap of lace and
      blue ribbons and, over her scant nightgown, a bed-jacket of
      knitted pink silk. She was at least forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall I put the tray on the table, Madame?' murmured the
      perfect waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh no-no--that's not so cosy, do you think, Myron? Oh nowy
      no! Ithn't tho thweet, thitting up at dweat big tables, for
      a small, little girl like me, do you think? Put it down
      beside me, boy.' She was crooning. She made the 'boy' sound
      like 'dear'.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Myron was setting the tray on the bed, and wondering
      where the devil she had got hold of his Christian name, she
      seized his hand and bubbled, 'My gracious me! What big
      strong hands! And such lovely strong shoulders. You ought
      to be in Yale, playing football, instead of waiting on
      silly nobodies like silly little me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was alarmed. He wanted to escape. But she retained his
      hand as she went on: 'Don't be in such a hurry. I get so
      lonely, Myron--out on the road all week, and then just this
      lonely room to come back to instead of a real, cosy home,
      and not hardly knowing anybody and all. Sit down on the
      edge of the bed for just a sec' and talk to a fellow, can't
      you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat, as gingerly as though he was occupying an armchair
      in company with a pussy cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you get lonely, too, Myron, after hours?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know. I guess I don't think much about it. I read
      quite a lot. It don't seem so lonely . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It <i>doesn't.</i> Not "it don't". I'm going to give you
      some lessons in grammar and vocabulary, Myron. I used to be
      a school-teacher, but they paid so badly. I'll lend you a
      grammar and some exercise books and make you work hard and
      speak like President Hadley. Would you like that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gee, I'd love it!' He was grateful; he was no longer shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll look through my trunks and dig out the books to-day.
      Could you drop in about nine o'clock this evening . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why . . . uh . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just to get the books, I mean.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure, I'd be glad to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then give me a little good-morning kiss, and run along,
      you funny, timid child!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned toward her lips, uninterestedly, mechanically,
      but that was no mechanical kiss from a kind teacher. Her
      mouth was like hot cream; it was not a sensationless organ
      like the chill lips of the school-girls he had kissed in
      playing 'Post office' at parties, but an entity with a
      tense, skilled life of its own. He forgot that she was
      wrinkled. He shook with astonishment and bewildered
      emotion, and he did not draw back till she had pushed him
      away with a wiry hand on his chest, laughing, 'Now run
      along! You see, you're all safe with the Wild Widdy! Just a
      friendly good-morning kiss. Nine to-night, then. Don't let
      anybody see you come in. They might misunderstand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood outside in the hall, shaking as though he had a
      chill. All day, while he bustled with platters and droned,
      'Yes, sir, beans on the side, sir', he was mooning over the
      Wild Widow. He pictured her as generous and merry and
      beautiful. When he came stumbling in at nine, she was in a
      dressing-gown of lace and peach-coloured satin. Silently
      they clasped each other; quite silently, without
      explanation in anything so worn and frazzled as words, they
      swayed together toward the bed. Not all the youth of Julia
      Lambkin had seemed so fresh to him as the flesh of the
      widow's arm about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Wild Widow was altogether, in every way, good for
      Myron. She was kind, wise, and grateful. He was conscious
      of a lessening in the physical tension which had kept him
      awake nights worrying about cloudy nothings, in the
      spiritual tension which had been making him too grave, too
      diligent, too near the priggishness against which Miss
      Absolom had warned him in the Black Thread boarding-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did teach him many things about proprieties of speech.
      He was supposed to have studied courses labelled 'English
      Grammar' and 'English Literature' in school, but since in
      the American pre-college educational system--of that day as
      of this--it was not necessary for a tall, amiable youth to
      learn any rigid facts or stern laws, but merely to smile on
      the amateur lady teachers and look interested, Myron knew
      rather less now of the rules of English speech than of
      those pertaining to French. Syntax had been a meaningless
      treadmill in airless class-rooms. Now it was a sharp need
      for his career, for association with the men whom he
      pleasantly hoped to oust in the hotel business. The only
      thing for which he really much envied the Yale students
      upon whom he waited was that even when they gabbled the
      slang of the moment, they still seemed to be talking more
      gracefully than Mr. Coram of the Eagle Hotel, or the fussy
      little manager of the Connecticut Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the Wild Widow he read <i>King Lear</i> aloud, and
      patches of Charles Lamb, Addison, De Quincey, and the
      rather highfalutin editorials then regarded as suitable to
      the great newspapers of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, without warning, she suddenly married a mysterious
      Captain somebody from Montclair, New Jersey, and moved to
      that town to live, Myron was shocked. He moped for weeks.
      He pictured the Wild Widow as a Helen of Troy, but wiser
      and more tender. But in three months he became interested
      in a pretty chambermaid, and there were a stock-company
      actress and yet others after her, without any
      complications, or any particular significance, for it is
      very doubtful whether he was ever so interested in any
      woman after the widow as in a proper Sauce Béarnaise.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c10" id="c10">10</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The manager of the Connecticut Inn was also the proprietor.
      He was a high-powered ant. He was a moral fellow who drank
      nothing but hot rum and who talked of closing up the bar,
      though he never went so far as to do it. He was named
      Wheelwright, and was known to the travelling-salesmen as
      'Deacon' Wheelwright. He was not deliberately cruel, but he
      was a fusser, a nagger, a discusser, a reminder; he had
      regular habits and did not see why other people's
      regularities should not jibe with his own. And he hated to
      pay salaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearer he was to people, the more he was irritated by
      their loose ways, so that while he was on reasonably good
      terms with the cooks and waiters in the Back of the House,
      he was always rushing in the manner of an agitated hen at
      the clerks immediately under his eye, and the labour
      turnover in the Front Office was prodigious. So Myron had
      his chance at clerking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third night-clerk in six months was gone, and when
      Deacon Wheelwright came nosing into the pantry, Myron
      tackled him with a bland, 'If you haven't got a new
      night-clerk yet, Mr. Wheelwright, I wish you'd let me sit
      in on the job till you get one. I've had
      experience--American House in Black Thread--father owns it.
      I could serve dinner here and still manage the night-desk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'll think about it, young man, I'll think about it,
      I'll think about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He called Myron in before dinner and, after questioning him
      briefly about his ancestry, education, religion, politics
      (none of which four Myron chanced to possess), and habits
      as regards alcohol, pilfering, women, cocaine,
      ballad-singing, and bathing, he doubtfully let him try the
      job as night-clerk. For a week then, Myron was on from five
      in the afternoon till eight the next morning, and later,
      when other clerks called the Deacon a 'mean ole hound' and
      slammed their clothes into small trunks and went their
      ways, Myron had further opportunity of learning the
      profound science of saying 'Good morning' civilly and
      choosing from among fifty rooms, all alike, which one to
      'give' to the newly-arrived guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began now, as night-clerk, to study accounting, and to
      dip into house-decoration and architecture. In the
      afternoon he sometimes climbed down to the basement, had
      the engineer demonstrate to him the balky ways of dynamos
      and boilers, and he read the manuals in the engineer's
      greasy, cheerful office, smelling always of a corn-cob pipe
      and somehow like a ship's hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he sat studying late at night, the only sounds were
      the street-cars on Church Street, the march of a policeman.
      After the clatter of kitchen and dining-room, the stillness
      was like a plunge into sweet waters. He strode now and then
      to the water-cooler, a zinc barrel enclosed in staves of
      varnished dark-brown wood, the nickled handle of the tap
      worn through to the brass where many thumbs had pressed. He
      washed out the thick water glass and dried it. He looked
      proudly at desk, register, neat pigeon-holes for mail and
      room-keys, lines of chairs--a great hotel, and <i>his.</i>
      He was in supreme charge, from eight in the evening--or at
      least from midnight, when the proprietor had gone to
      bed--till eight in the morning. In case of fire, burglary,
      a guest's illness, a quarrel in a room, <i>he</i> was the
      boss!--it was <i>his</i> hotel!
    </p>
    <p>
      After eight months of this, when Deacon Wheelwright was
      having unusual trouble in getting a new permanent
      night-clerk and Myron had sat in for a fortnight, Myron
      braced him curtly with, 'Why not put me on regularly
      instead of just temporarily? I think I can do it all right
      now'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deacon Wheelwright's pale eyes flickered, and he
      complained, 'But you ain't a clerk! You're a waiter. And
      didn't you use to be a cook?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, yes, but I think . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, no, no! An hotel's like any other business. It's
      got to be run on regular, established principles and
      according to Hoyle, or it just goes to pieces, and there's
      no better rule of business than that a fellow has got to
      stick to the line he's trained to, if he's going to get
      results. That's why a lot of these fellows that take on an
      employee just because he seems like a bright fellow,
      without due and proper attention to how well trained he is,
      don't--well, you don't ever see 'em running a big hotel
      like I am! You prob'ly never thought about it this way, but
      if you get right down to brass tacks, a waiter is a waiter
      and a clerk is a clerk, and you can't get beyond it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I have had some training . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, no, no! And that's one thing I don't like about
      you: you always want to argue and discuss and chew the rag
      about things, instead of coming right to the point, with no
      long-winded gassing about it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, sir, I <i>have</i> been on the night-desk--six weeks
      during this past eight months, and I don't think I've
      fallen . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, no, I tell you! That's entirely different! That's
      just being on <i>temporary</i>!'
    </p>
    <p>
      So within three weeks Myron had gone to the Old Eli Hotel,
      New Haven, as regular night-clerk. When he quit, Deacon
      Wheelwright sent for him and said that he was a fool, that
      he was a hasty and ill-regulated young fool, and that, if
      he just had the sense and the gumption to wait, the Deacon
      might take him on as a permanent clerk almost any time--in
      a year or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Eli was a smaller establishment than the
      Connecticut Inn, and considerably less respectable, though
      the pay of employees was somewhat better. Myron was
      uncomfortable there. He was not too rigidly moral, for a
      native of Northern Connecticut; he liked his infrequent
      highball and he had come to regard his little friend, the
      stock-company actress, as a very sweet and reasonable young
      woman. But that did not mean that he vastly enjoyed working
      in a brothel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Yale students who never dared enter the pious plush and
      walnut lobby of the Connecticut Inn with fly-by-night
      females knew that at the Old Eli Hotel they could, as they
      gratefully said, 'get away with anything'. On Myron's first
      night there, when he refused to give a room to a celebrated
      football star and a flimsy little female in mussed crèpe de
      chine, both drunk and minus baggage, the manager came in on
      the controversy and hesitated, 'Don't do to be too strict,
      Weagle, when the gentleman's an old friend of the house',
      and 'It's all right, Mr. Blank. Boy! Show the gentleman and
      lady up to the Governor's Suite and see there's plenty of
      ice water and towels.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager was a good-natured person, like so many who are
      engaged in catering to what is arbitrarily known as 'the
      vices'. He said nothing to Myron afterward save, 'Don't do
      to be too strict in this business, long as people mind
      their own affairs. Besides, these Yale guys are real
      gents--not like a lot of roughnecks. Give 'em anything they
      want, if they don't get noisy. See how it is?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron saw, and did not especially like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there were theatrical parties, late and extraordinarily
      noisy; magnificent training in fact for a night-clerk who
      had to keep the party-givers happy while soothing the
      embittered guests who were trying to sleep next door, and
      who telephoned down every fifteen minutes. (The Old Eli
      advertised that it was a 'high-class, de luxe, family and
      transient establishment', and that it had been the first
      hotel in New Haven to install electric lights or separate
      room telephones.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Eli was a favourite resort of the lesser and more
      sporting sort of actors. At this time, late in 1903, the
      touring troupes were still numerous, and their custom was
      important to hotel-keepers. The troupers had not yet been
      killed off by the automobile, the movies, the radio. There
      were hundreds of companies constantly out on the road, and
      even in Black Thread Centre, the young Myron had
      encountered actresses who cooked sausages with garlic on
      chafing dishes in their bedrooms, did their washing and
      ironing in the public bathrooms, let their long-haired,
      drooling dogs sleep on bed pillows in a corner, and chose 3
      a.m. as the appropriate hour at which to tell a husband
      that if he was caught flirting with that nasty little
      female blackface comedian just once more, there would be
      trouble and lots of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage, like tavern-keeping, poetry, and pugilism, has
      become respectable, and thereby lost most of its colour and
      joy. Its practitioners wear spats and collect first
      editions. (No philosopher has yet explained why the precise
      opposite to this has occurred in the lesser professions of
      banking and publishing. In 1890, all bankers and publishers
      were middle-aged or ancient, invariably had whiskers and
      broadcloth coats and dignity, and took exercise only in
      squeezing interest and royalties. In 1933 all of
      them--except for the really trifling percentage of bankers
      who are in jail--are youthful, frivolous, given to driving
      fast motors, and, in checked stockings and maniacal
      sweaters, to playing golf. And consequently no one takes
      either actors, tavern-keepers, poets, pugilists, or bankers
      and publishers at all seriously to-day.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But in 1903 the touring actors still retained a joyous and
      gipsy irregularity. To the Old Eli Hotel came the stars of
      burlesque, minor actors in 'straight drama', players of
      vaudeville, and old comedians from melodramas. Before
      midnight, they sent down for cheese crackers,
      Worcestershire, ham, ale, and whisky, and they received
      local admirers till four in the morning. Sometimes lone
      laymen came down from actresses' rooms considerably later
      than that, looking sheepish and wondering whether it was
      the swell, metropolitan thing to give the attentive
      night-clerk five dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatrical shindies Myron did not mind; he was guilty,
      even, of joining them for five minutes at a time on dull
      nights. But he disliked the fact that any obviously
      unacquainted male and female could come in and register for
      a room. It made him feel like a procurer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in 1904, when he was not quite twenty-four years old
      and had been at the Old Eli for only four months, he began
      to look for another job. That year the Louisiana Purchase
      Exposition was to be held in St. Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get out of this house of easy favours, to go West, to
      see the world, to learn quite new ways in
      hotel-keeping--and incidentally in living--that would be an
      adventure of the highest. In his weekly <i>Hotel Era</i>
      Myron found an advertisement of the Elphinstone Hotel and
      Restaurant Company of New York for 'all classes empl. St.
      Louis world fair hotel, open April 15th to abt. Oct. 1st,
      send foto and ref. first letter'.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent foto and ref. first letter. He signed the letter
      'Myron S. Weagle'. The 'S' in his name stood for nothing
      whatever. He had put it in three years before because,
      obviously, a successful man can't go about naked, with no
      middle initial.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was engaged by the Elphinstone Company as night-clerk at
      the Pierre Ronsard, adjoining Forest Park, St. Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pictured it as a chateau with heraldic shields chiselled
      in the stone of immemorial walls.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c11" id="c11">11</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Between New Haven and St. Louis, after a week in Black
      Thread with his mother, Myron made a pilgrimage to the
      hotels and restaurants of New York, nor was any palmer ever
      more refreshed by actually seeing the shrines of which all
      his life he had heard in reverent gossip. Stepping in awe
      through their corridors, humbly peeping at the
      morning-coated high priests and acolytes in brass buttons
      and monkey caps, he viewed the Waldorf-Astoria, the Hoffman
      House, the Holland House, the Fifth Avenue, the Murray
      Hill, the Savoy, Fraunces Tavern, the ancient Brevoort,
      Delmonico's, Sherry's, Mouquin's, Martin's, and Jack's,
      that chapel for night-hawk journalists and actors and
      politicians. . . . The poet, incredulously seeing the
      actual floors trod once by the masters at Dove Cottage and
      Stratford and Weimar; the poet standing stilled in the
      English Cemetery in Rome before the grave of one whose name
      was writ in water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron did not lodge at any of the cathedral hotels; he
      stayed at the Grand Union, for a dollar a night, and once
      in the lobby he saw its famous manager, Simeon Ford, the
      wit, and stood staring, foolish with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to, and did not quite dare, introduce himself to
      clerks and head waiters as an hotel-man. They would laugh
      at such a country cousin. But he did--and thereby used up
      most of his savings beyond a reserve for fare and Pullman
      to St. Louis--dine at the Waldorf and Delmonico's, and
      actually behold and (rather less important) taste the
      Pompano à la Potentini, the Pancakes with Orange-Flower
      Water, the Mousseline Waleski, the Cuissot de Chevreuil à
      la Francatelli which he had known, these years, only in a
      theoretical and literary way, and for the first time he had
      champagne and a half-bottle of Moselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was amiable but demanding with the waiters. There is
      nothing a waiter so vastly enjoys as being a guest while on
      vacation, and lording it over the menials. He is like a
      surgeon with a chance to operate on his personal dentist;
      he is as intolerable as an author reviewing the lesser
      opera of his rivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Myron had gone to New York a practical hotel-man who
      found his work interesting, he came out of it a fanatic who
      found it a holy cause. To give Chaudfroid de
      Bécassines--snipe in a bright brown-jellied gravy--to
      dreary and disillusioned men who considered their offices
      tiresome and their wives infuriating and their sons
      sapheaded--that was a sacred office. Myron did not, it is
      to be feared, reflect on the economic value of giving these
      fat and wealth-oozing guzzlers the good Chaudfroid or
      anything else whatever. He did not know yet, if indeed he
      was ever thoroughly to know, that there was a class
      struggle, a proletarian class, economic determinism, or the
      theory of conspicuous waste. To say this is not to praise
      Myron for his typical poet's absorption in his art; it is
      to indicate a lack in his many patches of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, softly whistling, he took train for St. Louis and the
      Great West.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He had never in his life made a greater journey than the
      seventy-two miles from New Haven to New York. He had never
      till now, at twenty-four, been in a dining-car or a
      Pullman, nor had he ever seen an observation car, with its
      glass sides and arm-chairs and platform like a back porch.
      He was fascinated by every trick of decoration or service;
      he was privileged to see them with the fresh excitement of
      an untravelled boy, yet with the trained observation of an
      expert in making wayfarers comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      His poet's mind noted not new adjectives nor flower-names
      handy for rhyming, but berth-lights for reading in bed, the
      deftness of the porter, tucking in sheets so that they were
      anchored against the worst restlessness of insomniacs, the
      inlaid mahogany and rosewood of this period before the
      coming of steel cars, and the magic of the immense menu
      served from the tiny condensed kitchens. He was not so wary
      of the dining-car steward as of the baronial head waiters
      of New York, and he spent an entire afternoon examining the
      ice box, the gas stove, the miniature sink of the
      travelling kitchen, and in gossiping fraternally with the
      steward and the coloured waiters and cooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never before met Southern darkies. They delighted
      him, and all afternoon he exchanged with his colleagues the
      most scandalous anecdotes about cranky guests--the ones who
      wanted corn muffins made in five minutes, the ones who let
      their coffee stand and then complained because it was not
      hot, the peculiarly pestiferous ones who tried to walk out,
      absent-mindedly humming, without paying their bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was more interested in such technicalities than in the
      new scenery, though out of that scenery he got enough
      thrill to stock a whole tourful of school-teachers. He was
      just more silent about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gloated on the farms of Ohio and Indiana and Illinois,
      fields of a hundred acres that would soon be brilliant with
      young corn and wheat, fields gigantic to the New Englander
      to whom a stretch of twenty acres had been large.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not believe what the Pullman conductor said: that
      in Kansas and Nebraska there were fields ten times as great
      as 'these dinky little Illinois patches'.
    </p>
    <p>
      For almost the first time since his conversion to a life of
      hotel service by J. Hector Warlock, he wanted to get out of
      steamy kitchens and dark corridors into the green sunny
      world. 'Be fine to live here and ride a horse all over--in
      this fresh air--for miles--completely free--no confounded
      city streets to stop you--no grouchy guests to have to
      cater to,' he meditated; but immediately thereafter,
      'Terrible little frame hotels in these villages. Dirty.
      Shanties. Wonder how a chain of really good ones would make
      out--simple food but well-cooked?'
    </p>
    <p>
      So he came, ruddy with adventure, to the Mississippi River
      and across it to St. Louis and the memory of pioneer wagon
      trains.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When he was met at the station by Mr. Alexander Monlux, the
      manager of the Pierre Ronsard, Myron perceived that Monlux
      did not regard him as a back-stairs apprentice but as a
      Trained Eastern Hotel-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Monlux had come from Iowa; he had never been East of
      Chicago, and he believed that any innkeeper or
      college-degree or red-wheeled buggy imported from New
      England must be better than any innkeeper or degree or
      vehicle from the middle west. He was not over thirty-two.
      He tried to keep up the dignity suitable to his very first
      position as manager, but it creaked a little. With Myron he
      was like the president of any American university meeting
      any English author-lecturer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron let himself be received with éclat. 'This is a dandy
      fellow. Him and I--he and I are going to get along
      splendidly,' he decided, as they rode to the Pierre Ronsard
      in the luxury of a real automobile taxicab. (In both New
      Haven and New York he had ridden only on street-cars and
      the elevated.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a week they were calling each other 'Alec' and
      'Myron'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until three years ago, Monlux had been clerk in a Des
      Moines hotel. He was sleek, slender, eager, fond of
      bar-room melodies and of keeping the neatest account-books
      in the West, and he had a small black moustache. He had a
      girl named Isdrella, in the state university, and he had
      showed her picture to Myron before that evening. Even more
      proudly he showed Myron a clipping from the <i>Hotel
      Era--</i>his first recognition by the Press as a national
      celebrity: 'Alec Monlux, assistant manager of the Swilleby,
      Des Moines, goes as manager to the Ronsard at the Big Fair.
      Alec has a real grip among Knights of the Grip.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Alec Monlux was promising, the Hotel Pierre Ronsard
      was appalling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been built only for the Exposition. It was expected
      to last six months, but the contractors had been too
      optimistic. It had bedrooms for six hundred and fifty
      sightseers from the prairies, and all the floors rocked
      gently whenever a fifty-pound child trod upon them. It was
      built of secondhand boards, painted crimson and yellow, and
      had a turret roofed with bright green tin in imitation of
      tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Regular barn, eh?' said Monlux.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young experts grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      More barn-like yet was the immense lobby, two hundred feet
      long, with its miles of cane-seated rockers and dainty,
      innumerable flowered spittoons. Later in the spring and
      summer, when the cheerful, perspiratory tourists flooded
      in, the lobby floor would be littered with tracked mud,
      cigar stubs, rumpled newspapers, and chewing-gum wrappers,
      wearily dealt with by insufficient bell-boys. The desk,
      made of second-rate pine daubed with red and yellow paint,
      was large and busy, with its four day-clerks and assistant
      manager, and the cigar and candy stand was still vaster,
      all prettified with tinsel and paper roses. It was later to
      do a famous business in cheap candy, cheap cigars, picture
      postcards, and such memorable Souvenirs of the Exposition
      as spoons, ash-trays, glass paper-weights, and statuettes
      of jolly darkies holding banners inscribed, 'Ah's been to
      St. Lou, boss.' And in stacks was the song of the day:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Meet me at St. Louis, Louis,<br>
      Meet me at the fair.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The lobby was lined with canary yellow wallboard in panels
      with strips of red pine, and hung with imitations of
      medieval French banners printed on bunting. There was even
      a tin suit of armour from a theatrical costumier's in one
      corner. The ceiling was covered with fireproofed burlap
      dyed a wild sunset red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wallboard, but of a more modest grey, sheathed all the
      bedrooms, and a sneeze in the farthest room on the fourth
      floor could be heard in the basement. The hotel was not
      quite finished when Myron arrived; the carpenters were
      still desperately nailing floor boards on the long porch,
      and panting expressmen still carrying up the stairs the
      lop-sided second-hand furniture which the Elphinstone Hotel
      and Restaurant Company had bought at auction. It was new as
      March. Yet within a month the stairways (there were no
      elevators) would begin to sag and squeak, the walls to open
      in widening cracks between panels of wallboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was World's Fair time, holiday time, and the farmer
      guests had to pay only a dollar and a half or two dollars
      for their rooms, and along the corridors there were real
      city baths, gay with tin imitation tile. All of them,
      guests and 'help' felt that it was a sort of gala, like
      camping out, and there was little complaint even when the
      vat cracked and there was no soup, or when the announced
      sweetbreads for Sunday dinner proved to be pork chops.
      Every evening the dining-room was cleared for a dance, with
      a real five-piece negro orchestra. The lobby was full of
      running, yelping children, and Myron did not mind . . .
      since he did not go on duty until after the children had
      been put to bed. It was full, too, of hearty rustic
      laughter, and of the contented gossip of new
      acquaintances--of couples who had found that 'the man at
      the next table to ours in the dining-room is the cousin of
      a great friend of a neighbour of our son-in-law in Keokuk!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron breathed better than ever he had in the Connecticut
      Inn. And he learned; he was again learning; he was learning
      'Service'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The higher professors of the Science of Hotel-Keeping were,
      in 1904, already pronouncing the thesis that a hotel clerk
      should be what was sweetly named a 'Greeter'; that he
      should bestow on every guest not only food and lodging, but
      a metaphysical blessing called 'Service'; that he should be
      at once the Little Brother and the Kind Uncle of every one
      who registered--call them by name (so that, for example, a
      Mr. Worthingby Bones would be irritated eighteen or twenty
      times a day by being affectionately hailed as 'Mr.
      Worthington'), advise them about theatres, get their
      letters especially mailed, look up their girls, and ask
      them tenderly about the Folks, illnesses, weather, and
      business conditions Back Home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron, as a clerk, was never so gifted as his rivals at
      oozing unfelt cordiality. It was always to cramp him as an
      aspirant, it would possibly be fatal, that though he liked
      people, especially children and the weary old, though he
      was patient with cranks, was swift to fulfil and slow to
      forget orders, yet he never could kiss the feet of
      customers, if indeed 'feet' is the accurate technical word
      in the Science of Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was unconscious of his lack, in the present bustle.
      With all the cheerfulness of this gipsy fair, there was
      tremendous work for the employees. Myron was on alone at
      night, except for two bell-boys and a porter who also acted
      as doorman, when he happened to think about it. The hastily
      installed plumbing, apparently stuck together with flour
      paste and suspended along the walls with cotton thread, was
      always going out of order. Sometimes Myron could get an
      engineer from the basement to stop a toilet flowing or to
      get it to flow at all, but mostly he, with a bell-boy if
      one was left on the bench, had to trot up and try to adjust
      it himself, after shouting to the porter, who was much too
      dull to entrust with anything so delicate and morose as
      plumbing, 'If anybody comes in to register, tell 'em to sit
      down and wait--understand me, Tyrone--to <i>sit
      down--</i>oh my God!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This won't do at all', Myron thought guiltily, a week
      after the hotel was actually open to guests. 'I'm an
      ignorant pup. I don't know anything about plumbing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter, getting up an hour earlier in the afternoon
      than he wanted to, he tagged after the regular hotel
      plumber; watched him, questioned him, learned to handle his
      tools; and he solemnly sent for another of his perpetual
      manuals, one on Plumbing in All Its Branches by a Master
      Plumber: with a Complete Appendix on the Mathematical
      Calculation of Adequate Radiation for Those Who Combine
      Steam-fitting with Plumbing. Within a month he knew rather
      more about such spicy points as stopped sinks and gaskets
      on faucets and the correct temperature of soldering irons
      than the hotel plumber himself, and he amused himself late
      at night, by making a plan of a proper plumbing
      installation for the Pierre Ronsard--if it were only an
      hotel instead of an overgrown tar shanty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month later he had climbed to successes even beyond
      plumbing. He had been able to keep, in the eyes of Alec
      Monlux, his position as a superior Easterner. Monlux had
      introduced him to the rest of the staff impressively, and
      on off evenings he went with Monlux to beer gardens, to
      drink the good St. Louis beer, and sometimes to pick up a
      couple of girl stenographers. Together they visited the
      Fair, to admire the Grand Basin and the Pike--and, still
      more, the Inside Inn, built by E. M. Statler and, temporary
      though it was, the largest hotel ever known in the world,
      with 2,257 rooms. . . . They were much edified, also, to
      discover among the other hotels the 'Christian Endeavour'
      and the 'Epworth'. It was 1904, and God and William
      Jennings Bryan were still alive and popular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron's intimacy with the manager, and the general opinion
      of the staff that he was a sealed adept in night-clerking,
      gave him such self-confidence as he had not known before.
      He forgot tending bar at the American House, and
      bell-hopping at the Fandango Inn, as though they were comic
      incidents in the life of someone else--a man he had known
      once but lost from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      So hastily organized was the whole Pierre Ronsard staff
      that there was an open road for careerists. Presently Myron
      was helping the chief accountant on quiet evenings, and
      when the assistant accountant quit in an agony of snarled
      books, Myron found himself assistant accountant, working
      daytimes, with an increased salary and with, for the first
      time, a private office of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not much of an office. It was an eleven-by-eleven
      wall-boarded coop, roaring with the sound of
      adding-machines and typewriters in the general office
      outside, furnished only with a desk, files, and two chairs,
      and looking out on a coal pile and an ice-cutting machine.
      But to Myron it was a throne-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed late each evening to finish his accounts, and
      during the day he frequently dashed out to help the clerks.
      He was checking in a hot, irritable mob one afternoon, with
      Alec Monlux also behind the desk, when Alec whimpered, 'Oh,
      my Heaven! There's the Old Man himself! I thought he was in
      New York! Didn't think he'd ever come out here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Huh?' said Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The Old Man! Mark Elphinstone! The pug-dog coming toward
      us! President of the Company--they own nine hotels, besides
      this ole barn! . . . Why, Mr. Elphinstone! Didn't have an
      inkling you were coming! Well, sir, mighty proud to see
      you! Why didn't you tip us off, so I could 've met you at
      the train and had a suite ready. We've got two of them
      here, you know!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mark Elphinstone's name remains in the history of the
      American hotel-world from 1900 to 1933 as ranking almost
      with those of Ellsworth M. Statler, John McEntee Bowman,
      Lucius Boomer--cardinals, deans, Pulitzer Prize Winners of
      hotel-keeping. He was not lordly of frame; he was short,
      squat, with cropped sandy hair, and freckles on neck and
      wrist, but he stood squarely, like a man who expected to
      control everything in sight, he gave his orders in brief
      barks, and Myron was later to see him in his New York
      office, posing with stubby fingers thrust between his vest
      buttons, directly under a portrait of Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was barking now:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Suite? Here? Never stay at hotels like this, Monlux.
      Dreadful. Got suite at the Planters. Never seen this place
      before. Dreadful. You boys done well. Made some money for
      us. I'll just poke around. Want to see you and assistant
      manager and clerks. Book-keepers. Cashiers. Steward.
      Housekeeper. Head waiter. Chef. Captain of bell-boys. After
      I've snooped around. Borrow your office. Give 'em each five
      minutes. But you get fifteen. Have 'em ready to come in,
      right on the second. Start with you at three. Then the
      others, right on the dot. So. Three. Prompt. Prob'ly leave
      for New York morrow morning. So. Prompt!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      'First really top-notch hotel boss I ever met. Gives you a
      kick. Gee, he's a dynamo,' sighed Myron to Alec Monlux.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's that, all right,' said Monlux. 'He's the biggest of
      'em all. The company owns some pretty rank hotels, like
      this, and I believe our Florida one, Tippecanoe Lodge, is
      lousy, but of course our New York hotel, the Westward Ho,
      is a top-notch house, and we've got good places in Buffalo
      and Hartford and Worcester and Akron and Scranton, and we
      own that chain of armchair lunches through New Jersey and
      Pennsylvania--the Pan Dandy Lunches. Elphinstone himself!
      It must be grand to be a really <i>significant</i> man like
      that!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When Myron, in his turn, was admitted to Monlux's private
      office for his audience with the Napoleon of Innkeepers,
      Mark Elphinstone was standing by the desk, his left hand
      resting on it with the arched fingers outspread like the
      roots of a banian tree, the right hand ready for oratorical
      gestures. A still-faced intense private secretary, who
      played arc-light to Elphinstone's dynamo, was sitting at
      the desk, calling New York (and later Worcester and
      Trenton) on the long-distance telephone. Neither Myron nor
      Alec Monlux ever knew just how the secretary had come. He
      had not been seen entering the hotel. He was just there. He
      would be. He had eye-glasses and tight lips and a low voice
      that you always understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waving his free hand, Elphinstone commanded Myron, 'Sit
      down. No, I'll stand. Well young man' (Myron shivered),
      'you seem to be a night-clerk, a day-clerk, a
      book-keeper--or accountant, as they like to call their
      grubby trade now--a plumber, a waiter, and a cook.
      Apparently work all the time. What's the trouble? What you
      trying to hide? What vice you covering up? Not normal,
      working all the time. I do. I'm not normal, either. Eaten
      up with fool ambition. What <i>is</i> this vice you're
      trying to forget? Booze? Drugs? Women? Women, eh! Fine big
      fellow like you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, then, gambling? Ah ha, yes, little gambling, eh? Fun
      to watch the hosses run, eh, or sit back with a full house
      and watch a flush trying to bluff you, eh? Yes, good fun!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never play cards, sir, not more than twice a year, or
      solitaire when I'm on nights and get sleepy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then what the devil are you hiding? What's the matter with
      you? Working all the time! Idea!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Guess it's just the same as with you, sir. Ambition. I
      want to get ahead. Like to learn all about hotel-keeping.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You never will! You learn how to run a five-hundred room
      hotel, and they put up a thousand-room monstrosity on you
      and some thirty-year-old snip shows you you're
      old-fashioned and out of the game--and he shows you
      <i>right,</i> by God! Next to love, nothing that loses its
      rank so quick as a "leading hotel". So it's ambition, eh? I
      <i>knew</i> it--I knew you had some vice, and you've picked
      the worst of the whole damn bunch! I can see you walking
      over my neck, one of these days. Well. . . . You dress
      fairly well. Neat grey. I'd get just a tiny bit darker
      shade of blue in the necktie, with that suit. What you
      going to do, this fall, when this dump closes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know yet, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Had many offers? Other companies?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'None, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm. Truthful <i>and</i> ambitious. Oh well, I'm getting
      ripe. Time to be picked off the tree by you young Marshal
      Neys. Want to go to Florida, Tippecanoe Lodge, 'tween St.
      Augustine and Daytona, coming season, as assistant manager?
      Vile place. Nice country, but vile hotel. Not much better'n
      this. Assistant manager. Fifteen a week more'n your present
      salary here, whatever that may be, if any. Want it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir, I . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Done. Report there, November fifteen. Manager's name Fred
      Barrow. Report to him. No need to bother me. No need at
      all. Needn't bother me. Just report to Barrow. Hobbs!' (to
      the intense secretary). 'Make a note of this--make a note
      of it. Weagle here hired assistant manager Tippecanoe.
      Check on his wages here. Fifteen more a week. Send him a
      letter confirming this when we get to New York. And inform
      Barrow. Make a note of it. So. Good morning, young man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron walked out, ten feet tall. He had gone into the
      office a captain; he came out a full colonel, having
      skipped the major's and lieutenant-colonel's ranks of
      day-clerk and chief day-clerk. He was, most magic title, a
      real assistant manager! His attitude toward Mark
      Elphinstone combined his feelings toward his mother, J.
      Hector Warlock, Miss Absolom, Julia Lambkin, Mr. Coram of
      the Eagle Hotel, Alec Monlux, and Brother Ora--that is, his
      feeling for Ora on the off days when Ora was agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The staff of the Pierre Ronsard became slightly hysterical
      during the last month of the season, when that already aged
      shanty was quietly falling down. The stairway to the fourth
      floor gave way, and they shut off the floor. Half the
      bathrooms were out of order. A thick fog was enough to make
      the roof leak. The paper roses on the candy and souvenir
      stand felt, as the stories say, the chill breath of autumn.
      The long porch sagged so that it made an admirable slope
      down which yelping children scooted on thunderous
      roller-skates. The head waiter left, and it was too late to
      hire a new one: his place was sometimes taken by the
      steward, sometimes by Myron, sometimes by Alec Monlux, to
      the considerable disorganization and sniggering of the
      waiters' crew. With these tokens of human mortality about
      them, it was impossible for the staff to pursue man's final
      purpose of chasing dollars with anything like solemnity.
      Monlux climbed down from his dignity--no vast descent, in
      any case--and the staff and the guests chattered, laughed,
      danced, played practical jokes; the captain of bell-boys
      was confidential with even the youngest of his privates,
      the porters openly admitted it when they had been so inept
      as to get only a ten-cent tip instead of a quarter for
      bringing down a heavy trunk, the haughty French chef
      confessed that he had never been nearer to Paris than
      Quebec, the earnestly hemming steward put a burr down the
      neck of the hotel doctor--who was twenty-five and very
      professional and serious--and the prophet and poet of
      inn-keeping, Myron Weagle, discovered with some
      astonishment that his art could be gay as well as
      prayerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark Elphinstone's query into his secret vices had worried
      him. Behind a certain mockery he had felt authentic
      criticism of his Y.M.C.A.ish sobriety and industry. It
      keyed far back to Ora's frequent complaints about his
      unimaginative bossiness, Miss Absolom's warning about
      priggishness, and the disgust of the senior bell-boy at the
      Fandango when he had refused to rob the inn of its whisky
      profits. He worried. Was he a prig? He must do something
      about it. So, on his next off evening after Elphinstone's
      visit, he had gone out, not with Alec Monlux but with the
      kittenish reservation-clerk, and with earnest determination
      had become thoroughly boiled on cocktails and Bourbon, and
      had gone to her home with a lady of 'uncertain reputation',
      which means that her reputation was extremely certain. He
      felt horrible, all next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hell, I guess I just can't be a sport, any more than I can
      be an imaginative, poetical cuss like Ora,' he groaned,
      amid the fumes that filled his head and the world. 'I guess
      I'll just have to go on being a grind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no sadder, less sympathetic character than a young
      man who is so inhibited that he cannot enjoy going to the
      dogs and thus become dramatic. But so it was, though it is
      still related in hotel circles that on the day the Pierre
      Ronsard closed for ever, amid cracking two-by-fours and
      falling plaster, Myron danced a hornpipe through the lobby,
      accompanied by the housekeeper, a venerable and
      Presbyterian lady, and afterward kissed her soundly and
      induced her to drink a gin rickey, and to tie a sign 'Just
      married' on the suitcase of Alec Monlux, who was off to an
      hotel in Kansas City. What is not common knowledge is that
      next day, with the house-wreckers already at work on the
      roof of the Pierre Ronsard, Myron returned to it and,
      sitting on a very little box in front of a very big box,
      finished up the final report for the Elphinstone central
      office of the chief accountant, who had gone home the day
      before, and that he showed his inescapable unromanticism by
      whistling over the forms and looking altogether more
      cheerful than when he had danced through the lobby with
      ledger leaves in his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before the Pierre Ronsard closed, Myron had received a
      note from Ora, and with it a copy of that popular wood-pulp
      magazine the <i>Yankee Doodle,</i> containing Ora's first
      considerable work of fiction, a long short story, or
      perhaps it was a short long story, entitled 'Navajo Moon'.
      It dealt with the wanton adventures of Heck O'Gorra who
      was, it seemed, a homicidal but benevolent and witty
      cow-puncher resident upon a ranch in or near Arizona.
      Though heroic, Heck was a man of doubtful habits, felt
      Myron. He was given to drinking, playing red dog, knocking
      out the teeth of officers of the Law, and on all occasions
      using such foul language as 'Why, you beetle-headed,
      flap-eared cur', which Ora had got out of Shakespeare, 'You
      contemptible scoundrel', apparently a dreadful objurgation,
      West of the Mississippi, and 'Why, you unfortunate
      accident, I'll pound your polyglot--I'll make your ears and
      chin-whiskers change places--I'll drive your medulla
      oblongata right through your saddle-horn, you
      hornswoggling, barn-burning orphan-robber you!' But never
      were the pages of the <i>Yankee Doodle</i> stained with
      such horrifying words as Hell or Damn or Bastard. The
      writers spelled it 'H--l', so that none of the
      travelling-men, mechanics, trainmen, and osteopaths who
      read it could guess what the naughty word was, and be thus
      led on down the path to H--l.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Navajo Moon' was jammed with Local Colour; with words like
      riata and arroyo and mesa and Judas tree and greaser and
      manzanita and chuck-wagon, and with the liveliest
      description of heat-shimmering mountains and jolly times
      around the banjo in the bunk-house. There was also a real
      Western gal, Heck O'Gorra's gal, who wore a short, fringed
      doeskin skirt, embroidered with dyed porcupine quills, and
      a silver-mounted ·44 six-gun. She was all-fired Western.
      She was a breath from the boundless sage. She was also a
      breath from the Arizona glaciers, and she considered
      Easterners lousy--though, in 1904, and in <i>Yankee
      Doodle,</i> Ora had not used so obscene a word as 'lousy',
      but translated it as 'stuck-up tenderfeet that don't know a
      prairie dog from a by jiminy stem-winder'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron wondered. It seemed to him a considerable feat, for
      he knew Ora had never been west of Poughkeepsie. He did
      wish, though, that Ora, with his high-class, refined
      education--always reading poetry, and cultured British
      novelists like Mrs. Humphry Ward--would adopt more elegant
      themes, like Harvard men on the Riviera, or Yale men
      encountering human magnolia blossoms upon Southern
      plantations. His congratulatory letter to Ora he ended
      with, 'Some time you must see more of the hotels. Some of
      the old-timers among the hotel-men could give you a lot of
      material about quaint characters among guests, etc., that
      would sure make a best-seller.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till he had read 'Navajo Moon' a second time did Myron
      realize that it was uncomfortably flippant about morals,
      and that the character of the raw young tavern-keeper was
      probably intended for a portrait of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided then not to go home for his vacation, between
      October 10th, when the Pierre Ronsard would close, and
      November 15th, when he was due at Tippecanoe Lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was eager to see his mother, but the picture of his
      father's frowziness, Ora's jeering, the chilliness of Julia
      and Herbert and Trumbull Lambkin, was forbidding. It is
      only in fiction that busy young men far from home spend
      much time in longing to view the dear, bright, vacant faces
      of childhood friends and every loved spot that their
      infancy knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      But next spring he would have his mother come to New York,
      for her first journey there, and show her the town. (Later,
      he actually did it!)
    </p>
    <p>
      His free month he spent in another pilgrimage to famous
      hotels, zigzagging north and south, to Toledo, Detroit,
      Columbus, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Richmond. Now that he was
      a real assistant manager and less humble, he came to know
      many hotel-men; Middlewesterners and Southerners, gayer and
      friendlier than the sound but over-cautious managers of New
      England, and readier to experiment with every innovation,
      from room-telephones to ten-story towers for towns of fifty
      thousand. He was eager as he crossed the prairies and came
      to the booming towns and bustling inns. Many old and famous
      hotels he saw, too. Alas, that most of the famous
      establishments which then seemed to him indestructible
      monuments were to be torn down before 1930, or, far worse,
      be degraded into lodging-houses, like a portly proud old
      gentleman in filthy linen! The competition of future
      forty-story titans was as unimaginable to the Myron of
      1904, who pleasantly believed that he had seen the 'utmost
      in modern hotel construction', as is to the hotel-man of
      1933 the sort of hotels that will rule in 1962--whether
      they shall be of 150 stories and 10,000 rooms or, in a
      smashed civilization, be again squat and filthy inns.
    </p>
    <p>
      He attained to artistic ecstasy at the old Galt House in
      Louisville, the Burnet House of Cincinnati, and in Chicago,
      the much-hymned Palmer House, Sherman House, Briggs House,
      Bismarck, and Chicago Beach. At the Grand Pacific in
      Chicago he remembered criticizing the famous game dinners
      of John B. Drake, which had actually been served right here
      where he was now standing--he, a much wandering boy from
      obscure Connecticut hills! In Pittsburgh he searched for
      the Monongahela, which had been built in 1841, and in 1857
      housed the first Republican National Convention. It seemed
      to him prehistoric; he gaped at it. 1841! True enough,
      there were a few houses in Black Thread Centre built before
      1790, but they were not hotels. Age, like virtue, is
      comparative; the antiquarian who is all of a bother over an
      arrowhead which must date back to 1400 is likely to be
      indifferent to a hillside rock which has been there for
      uncertain millions of years. The old farmhouses at Black
      Thread meant to Myron only changeless farmers in patched
      trousers, while the Monongahela gave him lively, satisfying
      pictures of ladies in crinolines and a Mine Host (Myron
      called him that, being a reader of hotel magazines) in
      vast, curving beaver, and blue tail-coat with shining brass
      buttons; he saw Civil War generals ride up to the stoop,
      and heard the long, broken ululation at the news of
      Lincoln's murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He doubled back for an hour of worship at Newcomb's Tavern,
      in Dayton, built in 1796, though since it had never been
      what he regarded as a Modern Hotel, his interest was only
      nepotic and amiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Philadelphia he saw the Continental, Lafayette, and
      Girard House; in Baltimore, the Eutaw House, built in 1835,
      even more venerable than the Monongahela. But just that
      year, in February of 1904, the Baltimore fire had destroyed
      those distinguished haunts where great men had eaten great
      oysters, the Carrolton, Howard, and Maltby, and Myron
      trotted reverently out to mourn on their remains. He would
      have hung a rue-draped harp upon them if it had been very
      feasible, and if he had thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington was his veritable Mecca. He had little time, or
      so he decided, for the Capitol, the White House, the
      Washington Monument, Mount Vernon, and it did not greatly
      interest him that just while he was in Washington,
      Roosevelt I defeated Mr. Parker for the presidency. But he
      had plenty of time for studious poring upon the Willard,
      Shoreham, Ebbitt, Riggs, Raleigh, the Arlington, where Mark
      Hanna had throned it during all his regency, and the
      National, built in 1827, where Henry Clay and J. Wilkes
      Booth had lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, filled with pride, proud as a collector coming back
      from Europe with a Rembrandt, Myron went his ways to
      Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the ordinary traveller would have seen in all these
      hotels, new and brisk or sunken with memories, only the
      distance from the railway station, the price-per-day, the
      extra cost of a private bath, the quality of the coffee,
      and the nimbleness of bell-boys, Myron looked through their
      walls and saw the founders risking their fortunes and that
      of their friends in building what would inevitably be
      called 'Howard's Folly' or 'Leland's Folly'. He saw
      distinguished chefs, homesick for Paris, struggling with
      sullen Yankee helpers to create the one really reasonable
      art, that of enticing cookery. He saw ratty little
      'bus-boys growing up into bland <i>maîtres d'hôtel.</i> He
      saw guests glad of a refuge, committing suicide in despair,
      blessing the hospitality or cursing the bills, planning to
      pay with a false cheque, planning to become much better
      acquainted with the pretty lady across the hall,
      waiting--always guests nervously waiting in hotel
      rooms--for customers, for brides, for mistresses, for the
      police, for death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided, meditating as he sat, chin in hand, on the
      train, that no church or capitol or university or fort or
      hospital has so known the heart and blood-circulation of
      history as a great hotel, where all the people, famous and
      petty--but especially the famous, since they must travel
      most--have rested and made plots, forgotten their masks in
      the exhilaration of wine, whispered in darkened chambers
      and roared at banquets in the admiring presence of all the
      press and dignitaries, and publicly thrice thrust aside
      crowns that had never been offered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was ferociously proud of his profession as he learned,
      first-hand, the history of hotel-keeping . . . along with
      such perhaps not less significant matters as his new
      discoveries about the most compact form of towel-racks, the
      commercial value of free shoe-rags, the best position for
      bedside lights, and the excellence of planked Lake Superior
      whitefish, fried onion tops, Philadelphia scrapple, pepper
      pot, and beaten biscuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, on many several trains, he became a very pretty
      authority on Pullman laundry-methods, repair of upholstery,
      and food-supply, and received from a conductor with five
      service-stripes the extraordinary compliment: 'Well, you're
      only an hotel-man, brother, and, of course, you don't have
      to bottle-feed a lot of greenhorn passengers night and day,
      like we do, but I swear, I believe you'd make a fair
      Pullman conductor!'
    </p>
    <p>
      So he came to busy Jacksonville, to contemplative St.
      Augustine, down the coast to the sandy, unpainted village
      of Tippecanoe, and three miles in a crumbling barouche,
      with a crumbling darky driver, to Tippecanoe Lodge.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c12" id="c12">12</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The wide grounds of Tippecanoe Lodge lay beside an estuary
      leading from Pontevedra Inlet, which was separated from
      open sea only by the long sand-bank of Pontevedra Island,
      with its hard bathing-beach. As they drove along the inlet,
      Myron was disappointed by the thickets of anonymous
      grey-green shrubbery. Was this the tropic-coloured Florida?
      It looked like ragged undergrowth on cut-over timber-land.
      But as they passed through the somewhat lopsided wooden
      ornamental gateway into the Tippecanoe grounds, he
      stiffened with admiration. The grounds were a little wild,
      but they were radiant, they were scented with orange trees,
      lemons, coco-nut palms, hairy-trunked palmettoes, live oaks
      cloaked with Spanish moss, cypresses through which
      glistened a swamp alive with bird-wings. He had never
      before seen palms outside a park. And here the geranium
      that in his Connecticut had behaved as a modest pussy-cat
      sort of plant towered up like a bush wanton with crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tropics!' whispered the Northerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the distant beach, across Pontevedra Island, he could
      hear the long rollers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as they drove among the gardens and lawns immediately
      surrounding the Lodge, he was shocked. On one side was a
      row of tar shanties apparently belonging to the negro
      'help' of the Lodge, and in front of the shanties, directly
      upon a driveway supposedly kept chaste for the fashionable
      eyes and noses of the guests, quite pantaletteless negro
      babies tumbled in the weeds, wild roosters chased
      ragged-tailed hens, scabby wash-tubs rested on palmetto
      trunks, and old men sat in listed rockers smoking corncob
      pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be said that after twenty years of training in
      neatness, Myron liked his picturesqueness quite so close at
      hand. He preferred it in China, or in books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearer to the Lodge, the grounds were slightly more trim,
      but over them was an air, an odour, of slackness and decay.
      The two supposedly gravelled tennis-courts were grassy, a
      shining-leaved magnolia was full of dead and broken
      branches, the rose-beds needed weeding, and newspapers
      soggy with yesterday's rain were left on random benches
      that needed painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lodge itself was astounding. It was built of cypress
      logs, with a vast porch in front and balconies above it at
      the second and third stories, and supporting them all, high
      reared, were pillars of peeled cypress, reaching from porch
      to cornice of carved timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porch was scattered with sweaters, tennis rackets,
      dog-eared books, cigarette butts. A negro girl, who
      presumably was supposed to be cleaning, stood at the rail,
      resting her two hands on the broom and gazing off hazily at
      the live oaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had not been met at the station by the manager, as he
      had been at St. Louis. He moved hesitatingly into the large
      lobby, with its unsheathed rafters of cypress and rustic
      chairs of Carolina pine with the bark left on. The desk was
      a broad slab cut from a single pine log, stained and
      polished. The lobby was dimmed by the wide porch roof
      outside, and at first Myron thought no one was about.
      Certainly no one was behind the desk to receive him--a
      major crime in a country hotel just after train-arrival
      time. He did at last make out a couple of aged and raddled
      dames knitting and chewing gum--it may have been
      tobacco--at the far end of the lobby. But all life seemed
      to centre in a room to their left. Coming from it he could
      hear singing, earnest but not very sober, and a web of
      voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irritably, he stalked there, and through an arched open
      door into a magnificent bar-room panelled with waxed pine.
      Four darky barmen in handsome white jackets were very busy,
      and before the bar, drinking mint juleps or straight
      Bourbon, were at least thirty Southern gentlemen. (Many of
      them, though, had been born in New York, or in Poland, and
      had become native Southern by learning to sing 'Dixie Land'
      and by spending portions of two winters in Florida.) Eight
      of the gentlemen, with their heads back, their glasses
      slightly wavering in their hands, were singing 'In the
      Gloaming'. Seven were gathered about a gentleman who was
      telling stories which produced cackling laughter. Three
      were violently discussing the Russo-Japanese War, using the
      phrases 'brave little fighters', and 'lazy damn Moujiks'
      rather often. The others before the bar were attentive to
      their drinking. In one of a series of alcoves along the
      side of the bar-room, five men, less liquefied, were
      snappishly playing cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron stood frowning. From the group about the local
      Boccaccio a round ruddy man detached himself; a man round
      and red as a child's rubber ball, and you felt that he
      would be as flabby to the touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anything I can do for you, brother?' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd like to find the chief day-clerk. Can you tell me
      where he is?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, to tell the truth, he's kind of passed out. We've
      been kind of having a party to-day. Jerry Lietrich--you
      know, the New York stock-broker--fellow that's telling the
      tall yarns--he just got in from the Big Burg to-day, and we
      been kind of holding a celebration--every year when Jerry
      hits town--great egg--comes every year.' The human rubber
      ball hiccupped mildly. 'But maybe I can do something for
      you. I'm Fred Barrow, the manager.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! Oh! Well. . . . Pleasure meet you, Mr. Barrow. I'm
      Weagle. I believe I'm to be assistant manager this season.
      Mr. Elphinstone . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barrow whooped with a voice unbelievably basso in so
      soft a little man, 'Gentle-men! Gentle-men! Lend me your
      ears! Here's the new assistant m.g.r. I told you was
      coming! We'll all have a drink on him! Real, sure-'nough
      New York hotel shark! Lemme make you all 'quainted with
      Brother Weagle. Tim! Set 'em up all around--on Dr. Weagle
      here! Come on, boy! Come on in! The water's fine--as a
      chaser!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When he had escaped from Fred Barrow and the
      too-congratulatory bar-flies and had begun to unpack, in
      his little suite (his first hotel suite!) Myron was angry.
      'It's all very well for Barrow to raise the devil. He has
      his position, as manager. I've got to make mine. And
      everybody will think this crazy-house is my fault. Damn
      funny position when a subordinate, like me, has to coax his
      boss to be allowed to stay sober and go to work,' he
      fretted. 'Well, maybe it'll just be to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But every day thereafter was another 'celebration'--for the
      coming of another habitué of the Tippecanoe, like Jerry
      Lietrich, or for his leaving, or for his just staying on,
      while the food became greasy, the bell-boys disappeared
      half the day, the elevator was stuck between floors--how
      everybody in the bar-room did laugh at that, and at the
      memory of fat Boylston Leclay climbing up from the elevator
      by step-ladder. The socks and handkerchiefs and small
      change of guests disappeared, the floors became dirty, and
      the employees, all of them coloured save the front office
      staff, became daily more impertinent and full of idle
      laughter, for which Myron did not blame them. Fred Barrow
      and Jerry Lietrich were the masters of ceremony on these
      daily drunks, and the affable Barrow apparently did not
      mind the two day-clerks and the night-clerk and the
      dissipated and aged male stenographer imitating him. His
      only complaint, in fact, was against Myron for being so
      stand-offish as to want to quit after two drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Myron undertook rather more jobs than at the Pierre
      Ronsard; he was, at different times, manager, assistant
      manager, night-clerk, all the day-clerks, accountant,
      cashier, auditor, and sometimes bell-boy; with two fingers
      he typed answers to inquiries about reservations; he went
      out to the kitchen to complain to the chef about a menu
      consisting largely of fried potatoes and corn pone--and
      little good it did him, for the chef and all the other help
      were united in a clique which adored the kind Mr. Barrow
      who laughed with them and gave them drinks and did not
      expect them to do anything so exhausting as to work.
      Immediately they hated Myron as a snooper and a spoil-sport
      and a crank and a hypocritical Puritan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so alone! There was not one person, employee or
      guest, in whom he could confide, with whom he could take
      counsel, as to what he ought to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not, at first, believe it was possible that an
      hotel, not too cheap or convenient, should go on with such
      filth, such sour food, such slack service, but as the
      season grew higher and they came to mid-December, every one
      of the 110 rooms was filled, and the door to the terrace
      outside the bar-room stood open night and day, to
      accommodate the extra drinkers, while the unused tennis
      courts grew weedier, the riding horses stood uncurried in
      the paddock, and the boat which was supposed to take
      bathers across to Pontevedra Island and the beach lay at
      the pier half-filled with slimy water, while the negro
      boatman slumbered on the pierhead. Compared with
      Tippecanoe, the Fandango Inn, where Myron had been a
      bell-boy, was a Y.M.C.A. camp with basket-ball and light,
      cheerful hymns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron found the double answer. Not only did the guests,
      women as well as men, come to this secluded and shadowy
      place for a thoroughly good drunk away from the rebuking
      eyes of wives and partners, or of husbands and children,
      but they had the pleasure of rarely paying. Fred Barrow
      regarded them as his dear friends. He let their bills run
      on week after week, to Myron's protesting horror as he sat
      evenings, in the quiet lobby outside the howling bar-room,
      glowering over the carelessly kept books . . . the poet,
      condemned to read doggerel in which 'man' rhymes with
      'lamb'.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not meek about it. He had laughed in gipsy days
      at the Pierre Ronsard, when he had had to repair toilets at
      three in the morning, or take the place of the head waiter.
      He did not laugh now. He considered quitting, he was
      increasingly tart with Fred Barrow, and he put in a good
      many hours--wearily sitting on the edge of his bed when he
      had awakened at five, after having gone to bed at
      twelve-thirty, smoking a dawn cigarette and feeling
      shipwrecked--in fervently hating the Napoleonic Mr. Mark
      Elphinstone for having lured him to this Bedlam.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have left but for the guest whom he most despised,
      the anecdotal Mr. Jared Lietrich. Mr. Lietrich had been
      coming to Tippecanoe Lodge for years. He had some vague
      association with stocks and bonds in New York; he wore many
      various clothes and drank champagne and actually paid his
      bills. For this Myron might have loved him. But it was Mr.
      Lietrich who was always the first in the morning to take
      Fred Barrow away from his office with a rollicking, 'The
      top of the mornin' to ye, Fred. How do you feel, the
      morning's morn? Me, I feel like hell and raise you one! How
      about a little of the hair of the dog--just one, cross my
      heart, and then you can go back to your dull and sordid
      toil, and old Uncle Jerry will go out and hoist his self on
      a hoss.' And at three, then, Lietrich and Barrow would
      still be at the bar, too dubious of stomach to have taken
      noon-dinner or anything whatever except eight or ten
      drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was Lietrich who stopped at the desk when Myron was
      alone, stamping the letters the bell-boy should have
      stamped that afternoon, and grunted, 'Evening!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good evening,' snarled Myron. <i>('How I'd like to poke
      him one. Maybe I will. Good way to wind up here--a decent
      fight. I'd feel better then!')</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come in and have a little drink, Weagle?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thanks, no!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you're right. Look here, son; get me. You're right
      to stay off the big booze, and we're wrong. Probably we
      just do it because we're bored. You're not. You like work
      and having things shipshape. You're lucky, son! Wish I did!
      And--I've never heard you spill a word about him, but I
      know just how you feel about poor old Fred Barrow, the damn
      rum-hound! He's a prince, and I'm mighty fond of him, but I
      admit he must be a pest as a responsible boss. But give him
      credit. He made this place. Before he came here--and that
      was before Elphinstone took it over, and Fred along with
      it--it was just a big boarding-house. He made the grounds,
      the sports--oh, there used to be plenty!--and he enlarged
      the house by maybe forty rooms, and built the swell
      bar-room. In those days, he never took a drink except to be
      sociable. He was a corker at writing letters and getting
      high class, top-notch swells to come here. Then the booze
      got him. I know--bad. Don't be too hard, son. Don't think
      because you happen to have the kind of natural-born make-up
      so you don't care for getting stinko and singing "Nelly was
      a Lady" and generally making a fool of yourself, that folks
      not so lucky are all bad. Stick around, son. Don't quit.
      Try to cover poor old Fred as long as you can. He's kind of
      scared of you! Knows you despise him. He's got a heart of
      gold--honest fact--honest to God. He'd just love you, if
      you didn't freeze him. Well, you can't help that. Don't
      blame you. But cover the poor old coot as long as you can.
      See how good you can make the place without him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After an hour's meditation, Myron vowed, 'I will!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought out Fred Barrow in the bar-room and demanded 'I
      must have just a word with you! In your office.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure, my boy! Have a hundred. But have a lil drink first?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not to-night, but thanks awfully.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrow was cheered at hearing a kind word from his
      subordinate, and trotted out so meekly that Myron was
      touched and snapped at himself, inwardly, 'Just as Miss
      Absolom said! A prig! All right then, hell, I am! And I'm
      not going to see this hotel become a pigsty. I am an
      hotel-man!'
    </p>
    <p>
      In the private office, he said, 'Mr. Barrow, I was going to
      quit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't do that, son! You're the only executive I've got
      that isn't cock-eyed all the time! Even if . . .' No more
      than Myron was Fred Barrow preternaturally meek. He
      stopped, glared, and wound up with an emphatic, 'Even if
      you are a long-faced, blue-nosed, water-guzzling,
      hypocritical baboon!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I may be all that, but it's scarcely the point. I can keep
      this place going, if you let me. The way the accounts are
      now, we won't last till spring. . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, we've gotten through a good many years!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You won't this time. I've dug out the books. Seventeen per
      cent more unpaid accounts than a year ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Honestly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very! I could do something. But I must have authority from
      you, and your complete backing, to hire and fire anybody I
      want to, and to dun your friends for payment. Do you care
      to let me do that, or would you rather I quit--this
      evening!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrow looked thirsty. Dreadful, having to stay away from a
      drink for ten minutes like this! Mouth full of cotton! And
      if Myron went, there would be many evenings even worse,
      when he would have to be in the lobby. But--seventeen per
      cent behind last year?
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrow wailed, 'All right! Hire and fire who you want
      to--except me! And make the damn dogs pay up. I mean, you
      take charge for a week or so. I haven't been feeling well.
      You probably think I've been hoisting too many. Not at all.
      Not t'all. Scarcely drink anything. But I haven't been
      feeling good. Be all right in couple days. You just take
      the bridge till then. Well . . . Got to skip into bar, just
      a minute. Something Jerry Lietrich wants to talk over with
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening Myron walked out to the porch behind the
      kitchen, found the chef happily smoking there in weariness
      and majesty, and discharged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chef called out Fred Barrow from the bar-room and made
      complaint. Barrow threw a glass at him, by way of
      indicating that they were no longer chums. The chef minded
      this violence much less than Myron's cold brevity, but he
      did get the idea that he had really been fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, Myron telephoned to a Jacksonville employment
      agency for a negro cook, who should not be a Floridian,
      with possible relationship to the present Tippecanoe staff,
      but a West Indian. The new cook came at five in the
      afternoon, after a breakfast and noon-dinner, prepared by a
      worried second cook, which were worse than the chef's only
      in that the second cook had tried to cook fancy, instead of
      giving them the good, plain, homelike, watery hash and
      soda-reeking biscuits for which his native gifts were
      better suited. Myron himself met the new chef, a sleek,
      agreeable-looking quadroon with a Jamaica accent, which is
      to Oxonian what Oxonian is to the tongue of South Bend, and
      addressed him: 'Featherstonaugh--that the name?--I'm making
      some changes at the hotel. I don't want you to be too
      intimate with the other help. They're good boys, but
      they've gotten a bit into habits of shiftlessness. You come
      to me for advice, not to them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, sir, I shall be delighted to,' said Mr.
      Featherstonaugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, at ten, when he had run up to his apartment
      for a clean handkerchief, Myron heard Mr. Featherstonaugh
      discoursing to the rest of the kitchen staff, 'And this
      chappie, this Weagle said to me, "Me boy, don't be too
      pally with your fellow-slaves. They're slackers. You are
      graciously permitted to be intimate with me, but never with
      them, no ne'er, me boy!" My word, I thought he was the
      owner, at least, and not a clerk! So I'm to beware of you
      lads and lassies, what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He-yah, he-yah, he-yah!' cackled the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron, still and very lonely at his dark window above,
      sighed as the brisk Myron of the Connecticut Inn could
      never have sighed, and went grimly down to lie in wait for
      Mr. J. Surtayne Staub, the jovial Wilmington
      patent-medicine manufacturer who owed the Tippecanoe for
      three weeks' board and room, and 294 drinks of rye.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He got something done. The discharging of the old chef,
      even though he was supplanted by an oilier and subtler
      conspirator, had slightly disquieted the staff, and Myron
      was able to have the lobby and corridors more nearly
      cleaned, the tennis courts weeded--on behalf of the two
      young men who, out of some hundred and fifty drunks,
      occasionally played tennis--and unscorched chicken added to
      the menu. He collected a few overdue bills, but only a few,
      for over each indignant victim Fred Barrow pleaded, 'Look
      here, Myron, ole boy, don't push Smith too hard--he's sure
      t'pay--fine fellow--just waiting for a cheque.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The monthly financial report, to be sent to the New York
      headquarters of the Elphinstone Company before January 1st,
      1905, would show thirty-seven per cent of bills, payable
      weekly, unpaid for from two to six weeks, Myron estimated.
      He so informed Fred Barrow, who gasped, 'As bad as that? My
      God, I'll have to get busy and collect. You don't know how
      to handle these bums, my boy. Takes old Uncle Fred to get
      the money out of these guys with paralysis of the
      pocket-book!'
    </p>
    <p>
      For a day Barrow was busy cajoling his chums into deigning
      to pay part of their bills. Then he forgot it.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the sunnier souls, enjoying the Florida sunshine, the
      luck of being able to find a drinking-companion at any hour
      from eight a.m. to three next morning, and the lack of
      money-grubbing cashiers, had a glorious Christmas Eve,
      ending with a dance round the Christmas tree at five on the
      blessed morn, Myron was sick over the chicken-yard
      messiness of the place and the feeling that he was a
      failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monthly report--including expenses, receipts, inventory
      of supplies on hand, and estimated future repairs and
      replacements--should have been mailed by December 28th, and
      on that day it had not even been started. When Myron
      scolded the book-keeper, he answered, 'Mr. Barrow told me
      to hold it up a few days till he collects some more cash,
      so's it'll look better.'
    </p>
    <p>
      On January 2nd, headquarters telegraphed, 'Monthly report
      not received stop send at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron fussed up to Barrow with the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I <i>will</i> get busy to-day--right away! We can just do
      a little fancy back-dating on the collections, date 'em
      December, and the report will look all right,' bubbled
      Barrow, from behind a strong Bourbon breath. 'I'll turn to
      and help the damn book-keeper, and we'll get the reports
      off to-morrow morning. I'll work at the report all night,
      if necessary.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was at no financial report that Mr. Barrow worked
      all that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron went early to his room, angry, depressed, hopeless.
      'I'll give him a week's notice, to-morrow. I feel
      <i>dirty</i> here. Aah!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Tansy Quill came in, to turn down the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Tansy Quill was the one girl, or indeed female of any
      generation, whom Myron had noticed at Tippecanoe. As at the
      Connecticut Inn, with the Wild Widow, the conveniently
      unattached Myron had received hints from lady guests that
      they would be glad to see him in their rooms, what time
      their husbands were devoting themselves to serious drinking
      down in the bar. He had been too worried, too gaunt of
      mind, to consider their thoughtful offers. But Tansy had,
      in the few words between them, become his one sure friend
      at Tippecanoe Lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Tansy Quill was a chambermaid and an octoroon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her skin was the colour of a tawny chrysanthemum; her
      Caucasian features were fine but not too sharp; her
      laughter was easy but never meaningless. She was
      intelligent and bookish. She had probably read more, and
      more discriminatingly, than anyone else under the roof of
      Tippecanoe Lodge, except for Jerry Lietrich. And hers was
      the common tragedy of the superior negro, in that the poor
      whites and the poor blacks equally feared her superiority.
      Even more savagely than the thick-headed white roustabout,
      the black peon yelled after her, 'Yeh, uppity high
      yaller--sleepin' wif all de hotel clerks!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Resented by the blacks as too white, and by the whites as
      too black. Resented by the illiterate as too sophisticated
      and resented by the sophisticated as exposing their
      provincial sophistication. Laden with all the complexities
      of twentieth-century America heaped upon the dark burden
      lugged up from old Africa's abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tansy had been grateful to Myron for treating her as
      neither black nor white, as neither intellectual nor
      chambermaid, but simply as a colleague whose work he found
      competent. She would have hated it if he had lavished on
      her that excessive attention with which Bohemian and
      radical white circles, trying to put the negro brother at
      his ease, make him more uncomfortable than would any
      insolence. Myron's most extensive greeting had been, 'Good
      evening, Tansy', but with it had gone an authentic
      smile--smile curiously weary, just now, for a man of only a
      little over twenty-four.
    </p>
    <p>
      She peered at him to-night, as she bustled over the top
      sheet and patted the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tired, Mr. Weagle?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, horribly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The bar-room's noisy to-night--hear 'em way up here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'God, yes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Weagle! It's not my place--and I suppose none of the
      other girls and men would agree with me--and I hope I'm not
      being impertinent--but I do know how you've worked to make
      a decent place out of this dump.' She was anxiously
      clasping her hands, tapering and coloured like old ivory,
      in front of her. 'Please don't get discouraged and leave
      us! It would be terrible, without you. The gentlemen
      would--oh, I reckon they'd bother me again. Oh, I'm afraid
      I'm forward! I'm sorry! Good night!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In amazement he blurted to himself, 'Why, she's lovely!
      Lovely! I could fall in love with her.' He imagined
      stroking Tansy's hand; he gloated that he did have one
      ally; and that night, for the first time in a fortnight, he
      really slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the Elphinstone headquarters telegraphed:
      'Insist on report at once,' and Fred Barrow, looking
      sallow, plodded about the bar collecting bills. But the
      labour, and the disgrace of seeming not to trust his dear
      friends, was too much for him, and he was dead drunk at
      five o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, a telegram not from the head office but
      from Mark Elphinstone himself: 'What's idea send report or
      will be plain and fancy slaughter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrow commanded the book-keeper, 'All right. We'll have to
      shoot in the figures just the way they stand now,' and to
      Myron he explained, 'It'll be all right. We'll pull
      through. Old Mark and me have been friendly for years. He
      appreciates all I've done for him, and I reckon he must've
      cottoned to you, or he'd never have sent you to an old,
      established place like this from a crazy shack like your
      St. Louis hotel. Sure. Let's have a drink. Don't you worry,
      my boy. Besides! I'll get busy right away--this morning.
      Work night and day, if necessary, and the February 1st
      report will look swell. I feel better now. I'm going right
      out and make those damn lazy gardeners clean up the
      grounds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He departed for the gardens--by way of the bar-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three mornings later, when Fred Barrow was again, or still,
      in the bar-room, and Myron, grown reckless despite the soft
      encouragement of Tansy Quill, was refusing to let one of
      Barrow's best drinking-mates take his baggage before he had
      paid his bill, Mark Elphinstone trotted into the lobby.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c13" id="c13">13</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mark Elphinstone shook his head at Myron, commanding
      silence, and slipped out through the dining-room, into the
      kitchen. He reappeared in ten minutes and went upstairs. He
      popped into the lobby again, and charged on the bar-room.
      When he came out, Fred Barrow was following him, wailing,
      while Elphinstone yapped, '. . . I know, very useful then.
      I'll give you a pension of fifteen dollars a week. More
      than deserve. Now get out. Go up and pack. Expect you out
      of here by this evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The recalcitrant guest, at the sight of Elphinstone's
      entrance, had paid his bill and tiptoed upstairs.
      Elphinstone leaned on his pudgy hands, flat on the counter,
      and gazed across at Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're the new manager-in-chief. Try to keep from losing
      any more money this season. Prob'ly all you can do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, I . . . I have the authority to hire and fire and
      make guests pay. . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're the manager, I said! You're the manager! That's up
      to you! You're running things. You're the boss. You're the
      boss! I'll raise you. Don't know what you're getting. Don't
      know at all. Have it looked up at head office. Write you.
      Good morning. Got 'nautomobile waiting. Catch train at St.
      Augustine. Good morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Before noon, Myron had telephoned to the employment agency
      in Jacksonville for a new skeleton staff of chef, second
      cook, working steward, storekeeper, head bartender,
      housekeeper, bell captain, and head waiter, all coloured;
      and two clerks and a book-keeper, white. He specified that
      none of them should ever have worked within twenty miles of
      Tippecanoe or have any relatives there, that they should be
      on the train by eight next morning, and that they should be
      confidentially informed that the new Tippecanoe manager was
      a regular damnyankee slave-driver and they would better not
      take the job if they expected to loaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before evening supper, Fred Barrow had sadly gone off to
      catch the evening train south, and with him had gone Jared
      Lietrich and half a dozen other lights of the bar-room.
      They said good-bye to Myron coldly. He felt guilty. And
      before supper he sent to every employee in the hotel an
      order which he himself had typed and mimeographed, that
      whether they were then supposed to be off-duty or not, all
      of them should meet him in the dining-room at nine-thirty,
      under penalty of discharge. The order included the
      bartender. The bar-room would be closed for the rest of
      this day; the front door of the lobby be closed and locked,
      and guests could use the little side door. On the front
      door he hung up a sign which he himself had painfully
      lettered, 'Hotel under new management and being
      reorganized. No new guests received till January 11'.
    </p>
    <p>
      All afternoon he was besieged by thirsty guests, horrified
      at the drying up of their well-loved oasis. He solemnly
      gave each of them a free drink and a blessing. Few of them
      came back to bother him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine-thirty he was facing the entire staff, in the
      dining-room, which had the cool, lifeless smell of
      second-rate hotel dining-rooms everywhere; of slightly
      rotted woodwork, and old flour paste behind the wall-paper,
      and lemon pie and cold tomato soup and butter, and the
      yellow pasteboard of menus.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sit down, ladies and gentlemen--no, not back there, come
      up to these tables nearest me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The white office-staff anxiously took the table nearest
      Myron; the tables behind were edged with dark faces that
      looked shy but cheerful. Myron held up his hand,
      deliberately histrionic, till the rustle of whispering had
      stopped, and he spoke sharply and loud. He saw Tansy
      Quill's kind face among the chambermaids, but he put the
      thought of her from him as he made oration:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gentlemen and ladies, all of you know, probably better
      than I do, that this hotel has been going very badly--bad
      service, bad food, bad collection, and too much drinking.
      Something severe must be done. I am the new manager, the
      head boss, understand me? My orders go, and no one else's,
      understand? And I'm starting by firing you, all of you,
      every single person! You're all fired!'
    </p>
    <p>
      A universal gasp trembled in air, like a sudden breeze
      rising on a still afternoon. Myron was conscious of Tansy's
      pitiful face, of the fury of the sleek Jamaican chef, of
      the horror of the coloured head bartender who, just that
      morning, had been a revered authority on mint juleps and
      the confidant of white Wall Street financiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When I've finished, I'll be in my private office--formerly
      Mr. Barrow's--till midnight. I'll be glad to see any of
      you, and some of you I may hire back, provided you
      understand there's a complete new deal! I do not, however,
      include the following; none of them will be rehired under
      any circumstances: chef, second, steward, storekeeper, head
      bartender, housekeeper, bell captain, head waiter, or any
      of the office help. I don't want to see any of you
      again--ever!--except that you can come to me and get your
      money tomorrow morning. That's all. Those that want to talk
      to me can form in line in front of my office, right away.
      Good evening!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The polished chef, who had been such a cultural success
      that in his few weeks here he had already been elected
      president of the Drama and Fraternal Insurance League of
      the village of Tippecanoe, rose to ask suavely, 'Boss, am I
      permitted to say one word?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes--just about one!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has it occurred to you that with no cook and a few other
      lacks, the guests are not going to enjoy this place
      particularly--are excessively likely to leave?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has, praise the Lord, brother. You're all dismissed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He faced them for an uncomfortable minute, and inside he
      was thoroughly frightened. There were whispers; there were
      angry faces. He wished that he had summoned a couple of
      deputy sheriffs, and then he was glad that he had not done
      anything so silly. He perceived, coldly watching his own
      hot inner fear, that he was bluffing; that he was depending
      on his position of authority, like a policeman outstaring a
      mob who, accustomed to be ruled by symbols and formulae,
      see before them only the blue uniform and brass buttons and
      not the scared young rookie inside the brass and blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes shifted from his, and he walked out through
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the lobby, he realized that the back of his
      neck was iron-stiff with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the staff, save the leaders whom he had discharged
      without right of appeal, came humbly enough into his office
      before midnight, begging for their jobs and assuring him
      that he always had been the apple of their eyes and their
      notion of a little white father. He rehired perhaps four
      out of six. He had a moment of relief from troubled
      responsibility when Tansy Quill hesitated in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would you . . .' she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're the one person I wanted to be sure to keep,
      Tansy--only you're raised to assistant housekeeper. I'm
      sorry I had to include you when I fired everybody.
      Otherwise I'd have spoiled the show, you understood. Good
      girl! Of course I want you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He patted her hot hand--the only time he ever touched her,
      except for shaking hands at parting, when Tippecanoe Lodge
      closed, the coming April.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, his one-man court martial was fairly horrible to
      him, with the necessity of discharging poor men who needed
      the job. He wanted to weaken, to retain everybody. But he
      was part of a machine, as helpless as they, and if he kept
      on anyone who had been too thoroughly trained in the
      methods of Fred Barrow, they would all be fired, himself
      along with them, and possibly Elphinstone would close the
      place entirely. So he brusquely halted the pleading of
      timidly smiling man after man, the while he was sickeningly
      aware that it meant debt and hunger for a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near midnight, when he had almost completed his ordeal--and
      theirs--a guest shouldered through the line of applicants
      and, bulking over Myron's desk, demanded, 'Have you had
      enough of your damn-fool, silly melodrama, Weagle? When are
      you going to open the bar? I'd suggest right now, if a mere
      <i>guest</i> has any influence in this crazy hole!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It will be open at noon to-morrow, provided this place is
      a little sobered up by then, Mr. Fanton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I also hear that you've fired every flunkey in the
      place. What are we to eat? Florida air?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Breakfast will be rather slim, but there will be a
      complete staff again before dinner. By the way, while
      you're spreading rumours about my madness, Mr. Fanton, just
      let the guests know that to-morrow morning I shall lock the
      room of everybody who owes for more than ten days, and
      their baggage will be held till they pay. Your own bill, if
      I remember, has now run for three weeks!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By God, I have never in my life . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Heard such impertinence from a counter-jumping glorified
      hotel-clerk"! I know. You wait. You haven't even heard the
      beginning! And don't tell me that everybody will pay up and
      leave. That's too good to be true! Good night, Mr. Fanton.
      I'll have your bill put under your door in the morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so done. But Myron did not 'have it put'. There was
      no bell-boy left to put it. Myron himself made out a new
      (perhaps the third) copy of Mr. Fanton's bill, and slipped
      it under the door before he went to bed, at three.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took a certain amount of resolution for him not to lock
      his door, that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course nothing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the following evening he had an inefficient but
      astoundingly willing staff at work; he had collected every
      overdue bill, except four belonging to guests who
      considered the amount of their debt greater than the value
      of their sequestered baggage and who blithely walked over
      to Tippecanoe village to catch a train. Out of the hundred
      and fifty-two happy guests who had been with them the
      morning before, Myron had lost sixty-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had expected to lose more. But those who remained seemed
      slowly to decide that, though Myron meanly expected them to
      pay for what they had, and though the grave new head
      bartender did not encourage them to melody and to
      confidences about sexual experimentation, still, they could
      get down as many highballs as ever, and on the whole it was
      agreeable to have better food, cleaner floors, and service
      that actually bustled up and served.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Myron, his staff working, was utilizing everything he
      had painfully learned about cost-accounting and auditing at
      St. Louis and in his furnished room at New Haven on
      evenings after work. He slapped his face with cold water to
      keep sufficiently awake to give attention to dancing
      figures along dizzy lines. He was checking the books of the
      former steward, chef, and storekeeper. He was discovering
      how many hundreds a month they had stolen from the hotel in
      purchasing materials and selling left-overs. He was
      devising new systems so that weak mortal flesh would not
      have a chance to be so careless again. And when the kitchen
      reports came to his desk, daily, he actually read them,
      unlike Fred Barrow, who had demanded reports but had felt
      that to go so far as to look at them would be carrying
      accuracy to a point of pedantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron's balance-sheet for January twenty-seventh to
      February twenty-seventh, scrupulously mailed to the New
      York office on February twenty-eighth, showed only a slight
      loss in operation, and the number of guests had increased
      from the eighty-seven who had been left two days after he
      had taken charge to one hundred and twenty-three. He had
      retained the address of every prosperous-looking guest whom
      he had known at the Pierre Ronsard, along with the
      addresses of most of the 'better-class'--i.e.,
      richer--guests whom he had met in New Haven. To all of
      these he had written about the glories of swimming at
      Pontevedra Island beach and playing tennis among the palms
      what time the north was paralysed with snow. He had written
      also to his new acquaintances in the hotels he had explored
      on his way south. These letters he dictated to a young
      stenographer whose salary he was paying from his own pocket
      till he should be able to judge of the wisdom of his
      experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was certainly one of the first hotel managers in
      America to write personal letters, curiously frank and not
      too hand-rubbingly cordial, to possible guests. Perhaps he
      was the very first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chary world gives credit to Homer and Hippocrates and
      Gutenberg and the Wright Brothers and Edison and Ivy Lee,
      inventor of government by propaganda, but no one remembers
      the originators of really important details of life--the
      discoverers of fire and coffee and the wheel, the inventors
      of the pocket handkerchief and cigarettes, the innovators
      who first discovered that man can sleep from midnight till
      eight instead of from six to two, or the creators, like
      Myron, of the first enticing and flattering sales-letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      His report sent out March twenty-eighth--next to the last
      for the year, as the Lodge closed on April
      fifteenth--showed a small profit, the first in a year and a
      half; it would provide about two per cent on the
      investment, which was about twelve per cent more than Fred
      Barrow had been able to earn in the two years since he had
      taken to the amusing hobby of collecting jags.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before that end-of-March report went to New York Ora
      Weagle had descended upon Tippecanoe Lodge.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Ora walked in as casually as though he had seen Myron
      yesterday, not a year and a quarter before. Myron,
      arranging a picnic for half a dozen guests, gaped over
      their heads at his brother. Ora was shabby, not much
      shaved, and his hair saw-edged in front of his ears. He
      swayed as though he were half-drunk even now, at nine in
      the morning and just off the train. But he waved at Myron
      most airily, he shouted, 'No hurry, kid', and slouched over
      to a chair, in which he promptly went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Myron woke him, Ora peered up blearily, shivered into
      wakefulness, and croaked, 'Oh, Oh, hello, Myron. How about
      some breakfast? Haven't had anything to eat for two days.
      <i>And</i> a drink!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You haven't lacked <i>that</i> for two days!' complained
      Myron, sniffing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh no; I don't want to be a fanatic--carry things too far!
      Well, hello! Touching picture of reunion of two loving
      brothers! I got sick of New York--remember I wrote you from
      there? Damn cold and sleety. Thought I'd come to see this
      celebrated land of romance, if you can put me up awhile?
      Could you--conveniently?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora had ended his speech with less hint of jeering than
      usual, and Myron roused to cry affectionately, 'Why, sure!
      I'll give you the best room in the house! Tickled to death
      you could come down here. Seen so blame little of you,
      recent years. Like a bath? Then I'll have some breakfast
      sent right up to you, or you can come down, as you prefer.
      We have some beautiful sun-ripened oranges--don't get 'em
      like that up in your lousy frozen north!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And the drink?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well--if you want one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      With a bath, a large breakfast--of which Ora was able to
      endure only orange and coffee and one finger of toast--a
      private bottle of Scotch, a jar of dusky roses, and a large
      dim room with a balcony from which he could look across
      hammock-land to Pontevedra Inlet, Ora felt reorganized, and
      when Myron came up to the room, he sniggered, 'Well, I
      suppose the Big Boss, the manager here, will bawl you out,
      you poor white-collar office slave, for sticking your
      insignificant brother in the bridal suite! Huh!
      Hack-writing may not pay so much, but it certainly leaves
      me independent of grouchy bosses!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm the boss myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Huh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm manager here now, manager-in-chief.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The hell you are! Manager.' Ora reeked with contemptuous
      laughter. 'Well, I told you so, long ago--in New Haven, I
      guess it was. I told you you were a regular Horatio Alger
      Rags-to-Riches hero. Sure, the real climber! Industrious.
      Cautious. Never taking a chance--or taking a drink with a
      man who wouldn't be useful to you! Typical American
      fiction-hero; the edifying young moucher! Kiss the boss's
      hand and keep sober and write a nice Spencerian hand, and
      you'll be able to marry the Old Man's daughter and grow a
      fat belly and be a complete success, while the poor, lazy,
      irreverent sap of a poet is a failure in the gutter.' Ora
      had a drink--another drink. He was rolling it on his tongue
      and thinking up a new dunciad when Myron plunged.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I get the idea, Ora. Let's admit I'm a dull plodder, and
      you're a winged genius . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My God, Myron Weagle, you've been trying to hatch a
      vocabulary! You're lucky, you night-clerks that can sit up
      and have a chance to read while I'm trying to pound out
      Wild West stories! You'll talk like a regular little gent,
      if you keep on!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you shut up?' Ora stared at this new, unapologetic
      brother. 'It's quite true that you have imagination or
      ingenuity or whatever it is, and I haven't much. But I'm
      good and sick and tired of your sneering, Ora. I am what I
      am--and then some! I'm glad you're here, and I thought your
      story in <i>Yankee Doodle</i> was a swell yarn, as I wrote
      you, but I haven't done so badly and I know it and I don't
      want any more would-be funny lip--or any more of your
      getting drunk in the morning like this--at ten o'clock, and
      you a boy of only--let's see, you're only twenty-three.
      Think of it! I'll try to give you a good time here, but I
      don't want any more of your being cute. Savvy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes--yes--sure--I was just trying to be funny. Really,
      I'm awfully obliged to you. Ora, my son, your skit is a
      frost. Go choke yourself,' said Ora with a demure smile
      which suddenly changed him from a haggard wastrel into a
      charming boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went fishing together, next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora was a more talented fisherman than Myron. He had been
      trained by Tom Weagle, with a book of verses underneath the
      boughs of Housatonic willows, and jug of applejack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after that Ora saw Tansy Quill.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was bustling down a corridor, fresh in a new linen
      uniform, inspecting rooms. The pile of towels on her arm
      did not seem menial, for they were of the shining new linen
      which Myron had purchased to replace the wormy old towels
      provided by Fred Barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord, what a picture! Swell-looking dinge. Who is she?'
      Ora demanded of Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Assistant housekeeper--Miss Quill, Miss Tansy Quill.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Introduce me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will not! You keep away from Tansy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But that night Myron saw his brother ambling through the
      grounds with Tansy, and heard from him, from a distance,
      wailing '. . . yes, a hard-working poet, just an
      impractical poet . . .' and '. . . agree with you; old
      Myron, the finest, keenest mind I've ever . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      Worry about Ora's intentions toward Tansy quenched half
      Myron's pleasure in receiving from Mark Elphinstone, early
      in April, the letter for which he had prayed:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Weagle: When you close up the Tippecanoe, come see me
      in New York. I'll have something for you to do, don't know
      just what yet, depends on our talk, come see me as soon as
      you arrive.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to get Ora to go north with him, but Ora
      announced, 'No, I think I'll stay here a while--maybe till
      June. I've found a cabin on the Island that I can rent for
      ten dollars a month. Swell place to write. I have an idea
      for a long story about the big swamp here--it's full of
      atmosphere--thousands of square miles of gloomy cypresses
      and wild orange trees, and secret waterways and moccasins
      and panthers and a hidden refuge for niggers escaped from
      the chain-gang, and their Queen--a marvellous coloured
      wench. By golly, I'll give the world the first real
      psychology of the negro in love and in trouble! To say
      nothing of the grand atmosphere. And of course right here
      is the place to get all the dope!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But there isn't any thousands of miles of swamp here! The
      biggest one within fifteen miles is about four acres. And I
      doubt if there's a panther within two hundred miles. And
      you don't know a thing about the psychology of negroes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh hell, that just goes to show you don't understand! If
      you've got a trained eye for observation, you can see all
      you want in four acres--or half an acre. And Tansy Quill
      has promised to help me with the psychology. She's quite a
      bright girl, for a chambermaid. Now don't go scowling.
      You've got a dirty mind! Typical Puritan, you are--always
      seeing wrong where there isn't any! Tansy and I are just
      friends. Oh, say, could you possibly let me have a hundred
      dollars to see me through till I finish my big story? Send
      it back the minute I get my cheque. You know how I am: I
      always pay my debts.'

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When Myron left for New York and Ora had moved to his
      little cracker cottage, with its scant table, bed, and two
      chairs, the theory was that Tansy was merely coming in to
      cook for him. She was an orphan, living with an indifferent
      uncle who let her drift as she would, and one night of
      relaxed indolence, it was too much trouble to go home, and
      she rested content beside him on the corn-husk bed, and was
      glad in the morning when he (for he did have that genius)
      was neither ashamed nor irritable.
    </p>

      She worshipped him, then, and Myron in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was happy in her, till he felt that he had explored
      her soul and come out on the other side, through the jungle
      to a shore facing new lands which he must enter. No staid
      settler was he, he meditated, but an explorer always.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despair was sickening him, for he could not write, nor
      could Tansy give him wherewith to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of swamp and crouching negroes among the rotting
      cypresses which he had seen, definite as rock, when he had
      boasted of it to Myron, had crumbled day by day. He had
      nothing there, he realized, save one flaring chromo in his
      mind--no fable, no people, no truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tansy gave him nothing new for his story. She knew no more
      about the voodoo or the slavery of the dark quarter of her
      ancestors than Ora knew about the history of Jonathan
      Edwards and Israel Putnam of Connecticut; she knew no more
      about swamps and poisonous moccasins and fevers and hidden
      cabins of refuge than he did about tobacco-curing in the
      Connecticut Valley. Both of them, the white hack writer and
      the part-white chambermaid, had about the same hash of
      American public-school knowledge; a little memory of
      Longfellow and Whittier and Poe; the opinion that Lee and
      Grant had, in vague forgotten ways, shown themselves to be
      excellent generals; the facts that the square root of four
      was two, that the chemical symbol of water was
      H<sub>2</sub>0, that Beethoven was a widely esteemed
      musician, and that the United States was (1), the greatest
      nation in the world and (2), as a residence for sensitive
      souls like theirs, the most inferior nation in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of this knowledge she picked items for the cultured
      chatter for which, all her life, while she had made beds
      and scrubbed out toilets and washed dishes, she had longed.
      She said excitedly, 'Boy dear, don't you think that Justice
      is the most important thing we all have to work for--even
      more than Beauty?' and 'Doesn't it just frighten you, how
      real Stephen Crane makes things when he writes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was bored. Her talk was just near enough to that of
      the more nearly literate of the Happy Hearts group to make
      him lonely for them. Had he been quite alone, he might have
      survived and been content, listening uninterrupted to the
      voices of his own self-praise, but she only tantalized him
      with memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so lonely for his fellow hack writers! And a
      familiar, dependable saloon around the corner! And a jolly
      burlekew show on the Bowery!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, in the evening, you could stay home, or go watch the
      Holy Rollers, shouting in their tabernacle roofed with
      palm-leaves, and that was all you could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hated the view from his cabin door, though it had been
      utter enchantment at first: fishing-boats on the pewter
      surface of Pontevedra Inlet, poinsettias seen through the
      veil of Spanish moss, a log cabin set in arching cypresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so still--and the stillness was insulated by Tansy's
      loquacity as she stirred a hateful pot of beans.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not hear her. He was in despair. He could not write.
      The hundred dollars from Myron would be gone. He was in
      disgrace with that old devil Mousey Glebe--jumping his
      neck, that way, the jackass, for just doing what probably
      plenty of others did! He was marooned way off here, a
      million miles from New York. And he could not write. What
      the devil would he do?
    </p>
    <p>
      'Boy dear, do you like Frank Norris's <i>The Octopus?
      Such</i> a time I had borrowing it. I was just dreadfully
      broke then--I was washing dishes at an orphanage! Did you
      like it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora drawled evenly, quite clearly, 'Like hell! I only like
      decent Northern beefsteak--and a little silence. Even you
      might occasionally note that I'm trying to plan a story,
      and keep your mouth shut!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood so helplessly hurt, a hurt child, with idiotic
      quivering mouth and beseeching eyes, that he hated her. He
      stamped out and did not return for the lunch she had been
      cooking. She was gone, when he came back at five, after a
      wretched afternoon of planless crawling through the heat,
      and he was a little distressed. But that evening she crept
      back again, crawling to him like a bewildered dog which
      does not know why it has been beaten, and he hated her for
      her meekness. He was a man who merited tall proud women!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, for God's sake don't act like a slave--like your damn
      ancestors!' he snarled, assuring himself that he didn't
      really mean it, that he was much kinder than he sounded.
      'Or if you have got to show up the nigger in you, why in
      hell don't you go out and get me some dope for my escaped
      slave in the swamp story, like I've asked you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He could scarcely hear her wail as she fled from the cabin.
      It was less a sound than a vibration in air.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was ashamed--also hungry. He would apologize handsomely
      when she came back. Nobody could ever say that he failed to
      own up when he had been in the wrong, even just a little in
      the wrong!
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not come back, all night, nor all the next day.
      Toward evening he was slightly anxious, and skulked about
      the log quarters where she lived with her uncle. He would
      have seen her if she had been there, easily enough; her
      uncle's dwelling had but two shallow rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was worried now, and bilious with his own cooking. He
      could not sleep, and he flung up from his pallet when,
      after midnight, he heard a long moaning outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He huddled in his doorway to watch a procession of negroes,
      lighted by pitch-pine torches and kerosene lanterns that
      threw maniac shadows on the writhing moss hanging from the
      live-oaks, on cypress trunks and the metallic leaves of
      scrub palmettos. They were bearing an old pine door, sticky
      with dry manure, on which, draped in the earthy jacket of a
      field-hand, was the body of a woman whose long black hair
      dripped water.
    </p>
    <p>
      He burst out, to demand, 'My God, what is it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The foremost negro, powerful as Hercules and humble as a
      slave, his moulded black muscles shining greasily in the
      torch light, muttered, 'It's dat culled gal, Tansy, dat
      cook for you, boss. She's done got drowned. Reckon she must
      of caught her ankle in a cypress root and fell in de swamp.
      Get you another cook, boss? Ah got a smart sister.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dreadful that none of them blamed him, none of them
      were interested enough in him to consider that he might be
      to blame. He must go unshriven, ignored or despised by
      these primitive people whom he had made his brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tramped the floor in horror. He stopped. His eyes
      bulged. 'Saints above!' he whispered, in awe at the wings
      of inspiration. He charged on his typewriter, and banged it
      from one in the morning till dawn, when he arose,
      staggering, to make coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he began his novel, <i>Black Slumber.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished it in two and a half weeks, in first draft. He
      was so absorbed that no life existed beyond the edge of his
      vision. He wrote all afternoon, all night, living on
      coffee, bread on a smeary plate, cigarettes, and white
      mule; unbathed, unshaven, his shirt collar grey-black. He
      roused from his frenzy only to telegraph Myron, in New
      York, 'For heaven's sake send me hundred fifty dollars at
      once really writing nearly finished novel been lazy before
      but now come across gloriously bless you old brother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He got the money. He finished the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the story of Tansy Quill--told from the side of
      Tansy, and relentlessly punishing her swine of a white
      lover. Ora gave her the grandeur of an ocean wave. He wept,
      real tears, the while his ceaseless clattering fingers
      brought to life her sitting amid hog-slop, longing for the
      simple culture that was the birthright of any white girl,
      the cowardly sneering of her lover, and the torchlight
      among the live oaks as they bore her home dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How wonderfully impersonal a real genius can be!' he
      breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shaved, got very drunk, and took the manuscript to New
      York, revising it all the way up in a day-coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was published, and had enormous critical success and no
      sale. He became a hack writer again, and never again did he
      write anything so honest, or financially so unnecessary, as
      <i>Black Slumber.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Within six months he had almost forgotten there was such a
      place as Tippecanoe, such a person as Tansy, and he was
      more or less contentedly ghostwriting the memoirs of a rich
      dowager, and mocking at Myron for his simple-hearted glee
      in being on the staff of that gaudy New York hotel, the
      Westward Ho! Only when he was drunk, and Wilson Ketch had
      gone home and left him to himself, did he again rise to
      such impersonality as to mutter something about dogs and
      their vomit.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c15" id="c15">15</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Westward Ho! to the eyes of Myron Weagle, was a palace.
      The Westward, as its habitués called it, had 650 bedrooms,
      and in 1905 was one of the largest six hotels in the world.
      It was new, built in 1900, and had the benefit not only of
      Byzantine, Moorish, and Gothic architecture, but also of
      the room-telephones, elevators and telautographs of
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Myron reported to Mark Elphinstone--the offices of
      the whole Elphinstone chain were in the Westward--he
      stopped to adore the façade of the new cathedral in which
      he was to serve altar. There were fifteen stories of brown
      sandstone, pleasingly diversified with balconies, grey
      marble plaques, and small pink marble pillars, all rising
      to minarets of corroded green copper and huge Moorish brick
      turrets shaped like hexagonal pears. The building's glory
      was its main entrance: the golden archway above authentic
      red porphyry pilasters from Syria, shadowed by the
      carriage-awning of glass and gilded iron. The lobby,
      inside, was two stories high, floored with pink marble,
      wainscoted with yellow marble, supported with pillars of
      marble pink and yellow and green and black. Above the
      wainscoting was a frieze (painted by one of the best firms
      of commercial painters in New York) showing the development
      of New York from the Dutch, through the English, Irish, and
      Jews, to the Italians: a fine and lively incitement to
      American patriotism. The elevator doors were of
      bronze--rather like the doors of St. Peter's in miniature.
      The café and bar-room at one side of the lobby was lined
      with green marble, and full of tapestries, silver
      medallions, carved oak cabinets, carved ivory chessmen
      under glass, a carved oak ceiling, onyx-topped tables, teak
      tables, Flemish oak tables, English oak tables, French iron
      tables from the boulevards, sporting prints, a gilded harp
      draped with a silken scarf, a portrait of Mark Elphinstone
      draped with a Shriner's sash, a photograph of Oscar of the
      Waldorf inscribed 'To my friend M.E.', tufted leather
      chairs, curved oak chairs, gilded bamboo chairs, and
      lights--a glory and miracle of lights--ceiling-clusters of
      lights, lights peeping out of mauve glass lilies, lights in
      a large horseshoe formation on the wall, lights and lights
      and lights behind the glassware that upreared like fairy
      stalagmites behind the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good gracious what a room! Why, it's like--it's like King
      Edward's own palace!' said Myron.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But Myron had seen, as yet, only what a guest might see.
      The inner shrine was the world behind the green baize doors
      at the ends of corridors; the world of the real
      hotel-makers--the engine-room, large enough to heat and
      light a city, the shops of upholsterers and carpenters and
      plumbers, thousands of sheets, table-cloths, and sets of
      silver and glass and china, mounds of stationery and report
      blanks, detectives, paymasters, tailors, printers,
      musicians, florists, cooks, girls who did nothing all day
      save prepare salads, men who did nothing but open oysters
      and clams, <i>gardes manger</i> who did nothing but prepare
      cold meat and find use for scraps, assistant storekeepers
      who received (and save on written order would not issue to
      the clamorous cooks) everything from five hundredweight of
      sugar to a single vial of rosewater; and all the
      office-world: book-keepers, auditors, telephone-girls,
      telautograph-operators and all the other workers rarely
      seen by the guest, to whom the personnel of an hotel is
      composed only of clerks, bell-boys, elevator-operators,
      waiters, and the affable cigar-stand clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole great hotel was to be torn down, as antiquated,
      by 1929.
    </p>
    <p>
      And long before that, by 1911, Myron was to be an assistant
      manager, one of the princes royal of the Westward, and to
      regard it with affectionate contempt as merely a hovel in
      comparison with the new Plaza and the Ritz-Carlton which,
      now beginning construction, was <i>really</i> to be the
      Last Word in Modern Hotels!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mark Elphinstone had, in a case in his tulipwood-panelled
      private office, one of the least spurious of the guaranteed
      authentic swords of Napoleon Bonaparte.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Elphinstone looked across the top of his desk at Myron and
      piped, 'Do you still want to be a king-pin hotel-man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Want to learn the whole thing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I think I'll start you all over again--as 'bus boy,
      then maybe porter, then maybe ice-cream maker or even
      pot-washer in the kitchen, and then you can shovel coal a
      while in the engine-room . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. I've pretty much done all that. I'm an executive now.
      I'm twenty-five and no use wasting time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, there isn't, eh? What do you propose to do this
      summer? What'll you do if you don't follow my advice,
      Weagle?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't know, till I've had a real talk with you! That's a
      pleasure you promised me six months ago, Mr. Elphinstone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Napoleon in spats chuckled. 'You're growing up. Growing up.
      Maybe you will be of some use to me! All right. Start in as
      day-clerk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Day-clerk. Assistant cashier. Cashier. A sudden switch to
      another department, and chief storekeeper, then assistant
      restaurant and banquet manager, then restaurant and banquet
      manager--a sort of industrialized <i>maître d'hôtel,</i>
      with the rank of assistant manager. During this time, after
      hours, two years of evening school in the New York
      University School of Commerce, really learning accountancy.
      A journey to inspect all the Elphinstone hotels and
      restaurants, and the devising, then, and installation of
      their first scientific food-cost-system.
    </p>
    <p>
      It increased food-profits in various units of the chain
      from five to thirty per cent. Napoleon was pleased, and
      called in Myron one March day in 1911, when Myron was
      thirty-one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office was unchanged, and the two men seemed to each
      other, since they had been together almost daily, unchanged
      in the six years since Myron had first faced the old boar
      at the Westward. But Elphinstone was grey-faced, and puffed
      whenever he moved, while Myron's thinner hair had a
      sleekness, his clothes had an ease, his forehead had lines
      of worry, that had been unknown in the rustic and earnest
      young man who had come to New York from Tippecanoe and
      Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You've done pretty well, Myron,' said Elphinstone. 'Other
      hotels are copying our food-costs dope. Well. So it goes.
      You are now in a new job.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. 'Bus-boy again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It wouldn't hurt you a bit! Not a bit! Like all my young
      men, you feel you could run the whole shebang now. Run the
      whole show. Well, maybe you could. Wish to God you would!
      I'm tired! I'm sixty-two. Forty-five years I've been in the
      hotel business. I suppose I've helped to make beds and
      furnish chow for maybe three hundred thousand different
      folks. And all I've got out of it is confirmation of my
      suspicion that all my waiters drink the heeltaps of
      cocktails when they remove 'em, and all my accountants
      think I'm an old fogey who can't add a column of
      figures--which is perfectly correct. But that isn't what I
      called you in to talk about, my boy. Your new job is chief
      purchasing-agent for the whole chain. I'll expect you to
      put in new systems. Fire any steward or housekeeper or
      chief engineer that doesn't toe the line about buying. Cut
      the costs, my boy, cut the costs, cut the horrid costs.
      Good morning. I'll dictate a memo about your duties, and
      authorization for you to disturb everybody that is singing
      at his work and just raise hell with him, raise hell, yes,
      lots of hell, <i>good morning?'</i>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron's chief worry, just now, aside from feeling more
      fagged than was normal, was that the better his
      food-cost-systems were, the more he made an enemy of Carlos
      Jaynes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlos Jaynes had been the restaurant and banquet manager
      of the Westward, and was now the head of the Pan Dandy
      chain of Elphinstone restaurants. He was a cold, driving,
      handsome, disagreeable, uncomfortably competent man of
      thirty-five; one of the few college graduates, as yet, in
      the Elphinstone organization, and as ambitious as Queen
      Elizabeth, whom he resembled in everything save red hair
      and sex. He had criticized Myron's systems sharply and
      usefully. At first, Myron, the friendly, had been dismayed
      by the evident hatred of Carlos Jaynes; then it gave lively
      drama to his work to be not merely a serenely grinding
      machine but a human being in the midst of a feud, as the
      Elphinstone employees gathered behind Myron or Jaynes, and
      all of them looked to Mark Elphinstone and his royal power
      of life or death.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was none the less tired in that, during this week when
      he was struggling to co-ordinate all his notions for the
      re-organization of purchasing, he had to get Ora out of
      trouble again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora had, after the literary success but financial failure
      of <i>Black Slumber</i> and after a little ghostwriting and
      a little fiction-writing and the production of a Guide to
      Canada, which had cost him two whole weeks of travel, two
      more of research in the library, and three weeks of actual
      writing, been made editor of a fiction magazine named
      <i>Cherry Pie,</i> and had recently been discharged from
      the same for buying stories from himself under six other
      names. He went on a bender which was the talk of all Sixth
      Avenue, and Myron bought him out of jail, got him sobered
      and bathed and re-shaved, lent him another hundred,
      listened to his jeers--Ora aptly mentioned Horatio M.
      Alger--and found him a job with a theatrical press agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But dealing with Ora was picturesque compared with going on
      working. Myron believed that he was ripening for the 'flu,
      and in that irritable, feeble state, he recalled, rather
      surprised, that not in all his life since he was
      seven--over twenty-four years now--had he had a leisurely
      vacation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, he did like his profession; he did take pride in
      mastering it, in being one of the few hotel-men who were by
      new methods actually transforming it. But there had been so
      many details, so many years. Every new guest who arrived at
      any of the Elphinstone hotels on any new day was a new
      problem and there were so many hotels, so many guests, so
      many days, so many years, so many details . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      He was cheered when Elphinstone's secretary whispered that
      he had a notion that the Old Man was, in his secretive
      mind, contemplating the raising of Myron to the position of
      vice-president of the whole chain, with a gambling chance
      that in another ten or twelve years he might actually be
      Elphinstone's successor, if Carlos Jaynes did not get in
      ahead of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That did excite him. And he told himself firmly that he was
      going on being excited. But it was not easy as he struggled
      with 'Standard of Towelling Specifications: test of weight
      per square yard, percentage of sizing, breaking strength,
      warp and filling, threads per inch, fibre', or 'Key Tag
      Specifications: size, weight, composition, mailability,

      So many details, so many years, in the warmed-over air of
      stale hotel offices and lobbies and halls and kitchens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jewett, this lady has left a pocket-book in the Palm
      Court and I want you . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm very sorry, sir; I would like to cash your cheque, but
      we have a rule that we must have identification before . .
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      I want you to try out both sweet butter and salt butter on
      the same group of tables, and give me a detailed report on
      how . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      If the room-service tables tend to rip the carpet seams, it
      would be economy to mount them on wheels not less than six
      inches in diameter . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      (This <i>must</i> be the 'flu. His head ached so.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Experience has not shown that cafeterias require fewer
      employees than lunch-rooms and the wasted space behind the
      bar-room would make . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Exington, I have been very patient, but if you don't
      have that woman out of your room in ten minutes, I'll come
      up with the house officer myself and . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Madame, in reply to your much valued communication of
      the sixteenth inst., would say that we shall be very glad
      to reserve accommodations with bath--without bath--at our
      lowest rate--at a special rate--with bath--with southern
      exposure--near fire-escape--away from elevators--with
      private bath--at our lowest rate--glad to reserve,
      delighted to reserve, enchanted to reserve, beatified to
      reserve--you are the only customer who has ever wanted
      lower rates--we love to make lower rates--we prize your
      custom--with bath--without bath--at lowest rates . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Why no, Mr. Bobbable, I don't think I've ever heard that
      one before; it certainly is a mighty clever story; why no,
      indeed--our theatre-ticket office is closed for the night,
      but I'd be delighted to telephone myself and make
      reservations for seats--two in the orchestra?--with
      bath?--without bath?--all the seats have baths, six hundred
      and fifty seats, six hundred and fifty baths, unexampled
      cuisine, a bath and a half for a dollar and a half . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed, Mrs. Javelain, I'll speak to the engineer
      about your radiator clanking; I'm terribly sorry you were
      disturbed, and I do hope it won't occur . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      At our very best rates. With bath, oh yes indeed, Mr.
      Smith, Mrs. Smith, Mr. Smith, Jun., the very best we can do
      . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast with entrees, oysters should gross at least two
      hundred and fifty on raw cost not taking in labour costs,
      overhead or . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      If you furnished it in Chippendale you would get away from
      that heavy hotel-effect . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you stretch your budget, you've got to include
      pointing up the stonework, and the operating valves have to
      be relined . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed, I thought the Flushing Ladies' League's St.
      Patrick's Day Bridge Tournament was one of the most
      recherché affairs we've ever had in the Carcassonne Room,
      and those score-pads covered with green cardboard cut like
      four-leaf clovers were about the most original and . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentlemen of the Staff, the thought I want you to take away
      from this Conference to-day is that an hotel is like a
      three-legged stool . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Miss Heatherington, at seven dollars a head we can
      serve each of your guests a pint of Rauenthaler Auslese
      with or without bath at our lowest rates with southern
      exposure near fire-escape away from elevators at a very
      special rate by the month with or without bath . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh my Lord!' wailed Myron, as his head cracked.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      'Influenza' or ''flu' is one of those back-attic words into
      which is thrown everything for which no use can be found.
      It is to doctors what the back-attic words 'idealism', and
      'patriotism' are to politicians, 'virtue' to the moralists,
      'realism' and 'satire' to the critics, 'hysteria' to
      husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron presumably did have the 'flu, and for years he had
      worked too steadily, with too little sunshine and exercise,
      eaten too irregularly, and never, in fifteen years, spent
      more than seven consecutive hours in sleep. When he let go,
      the hotel doctor made him stay abed for two weeks. His nose
      ran, his temples ached, his eyes were hot, and he was
      shamefully weak, yet all the while he rather enjoyed his
      first experience of being nursed and not having to be
      responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had time to think--even to think of something beyond the
      comparative costs of bed-linen with and without the hotel
      name woven into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just why have I worked so hard and so long and with so
      little variety?
    </p>
    <p>
      Just why have I, who am youngish and strong and without
      dependents, failed to see foreign lands, make love to more
      women, read more books that did not deal with oil <i>v.</i>
      washed coal for heating, ride horseback, go fishing, learn
      to paint?
    </p>
    <p>
      He meant to be very profound about it. Possibly if his
      furlough had occurred not in 1911 but after the Great War,
      when it became the fashion to be disillusionized and
      revolutionary, he would have decided that his work, along
      with Faith, Hope, Charity, machinery, contemporary art, and
      the Government had been futile. But he could feel none of
      the puritanical guilt which afflicts young socialists and
      anarchists so much more than it ever does Presbyterian
      elders. He had enjoyed keeping hotel! He had enjoyed making
      better bedrooms at lower prices. He had enjoyed competing
      with other driving young men. He did not, he admitted, see
      that his career had contributed notably to making the world
      perfect. But then he did not see that anybody's career had
      done so, except possibly, just possibly, Shakespeare's and
      Goethe's and Edison's and Rembrandt's and Paul Ehrlich's.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave up his effort to make a frugal use of this time-off
      by fretting about his soul. If he fretted at all, it was
      because he could not seem to fret. He envied Ora, who
      could, on the slightest amount of alcohol, begin to fret
      like anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm a smug, complacent, mechanical, ordinary
      food-merchant. But I enjoy it!' he lamented, touched at the
      spectacle of a man who couldn't be modern and melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He actually had time, that fortnight abed and another week
      achair after it, to see his friends, especially Alec
      Monlux, sometime manager of the Pierre Ronsard. Alec was
      manager now of the St. Casimir, a huge, dull, residential
      hotel near Riverside Drive. What small distinction had ever
      been made between them as chief and subordinate had
      vanished now; Alex was pleased to consider Myron an
      innovator in hotel-keeping, while he himself, he said, was
      'simply a glorified boarding-house landlord for a lot of
      old women with more money and fox terriers than good
      sense'. Alec was more tender than any woman in his
      attentions to the sick hero, and he brought in the damndest
      gifts--a nice book of dirty limericks, a bottle of Piper
      Heidsieck, a puzzle in which (for no reason that the
      impatient Myron could ever discover) you were supposed to
      wiggle a steel ball through an asinine labyrinth of tiny
      nails, a box of Chinese candy one-quarter of which would
      have been enough to kill Myron in his present condition,
      and a most interesting pamphlet by John T. Semmelwack, of
      the Prince's Own Hotel, Wabasa, Oklahoma, entitled, 'A
      Study of Modern Flying Machines or Aeroplanes, with an
      Authoritative Account of the Achievements of Wright
      Brothers, Curtiss, Bleriot, &amp; Deperdussin, and a
      Prophetic Suggestion of the Future Effect of Universal
      Flying on the Installation of Resort Hotels in Locations
      Now Inaccessible'.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's certainly a real idea,' said Myron, turning over
      his hot pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, it certainly is--it gives you some real ideas,' said
      Alec.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Alec left, they had planned to open a magnificent
      tavern on top of Mt. Ranier, served by aeroplanes. They
      outlined the size, number of rooms, tariff, method of
      procuring milk, eggs, and oysters, decoration of the lobby,
      and whether to use bamboo or wicker chairs on the great
      porch. And that was the beginning and the end of the Mt.
      Ranier House.
    </p>
    <p>
      More often, Myron saw Luciano Mora.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rumoured that Mora, the young, tall, curly-headed
      Italian, was the son of an important hotel proprietor in
      Naples, but whether or no, he had worked his way up from
      baggage-porter to reservation-clerk at the Westward. He was
      a student of hotel-keeping such as would not often be found
      among native Americans for another ten or fifteen years. He
      had worked in Paris and Baden-Baden and Madrid, and at the
      Adelphi in Liverpool; he had come to New York to learn
      Americanese and American mechanical methods, and he had
      gone so far that he now really liked corn on cob. He
      admitted that he knew more about omelettes, cognac, and
      room-waiters than most people at the Westward, but with all
      the fervour of any recent convert he worshipped, and
      incessantly talked about, the American hotel's superiority
      in mattresses, vacuum-cleaners, express elevators,
      automatically controlled central heating, and coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Myron who had had for pious dogma the belief that the
      worst American hotel had better 'service' and
      'accommodations' than the greatest palace hotel in all
      Europe had been shocked to find that Luciano was swifter
      and suaver in conciliating guests than Mark Elphinstone
      himself, and from Luciano he had received confirmation of
      his own mystical belief in the pride and value and honour
      of hotel-keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Six generations my mouldy old ancestors have kept tavern
      in Napoli, and now I am going to show the old buffers a
      really <i>good</i> hotel,' laughed Luciano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even with Mr. Coram of Torrington, or Alec Monlux or
      Elphinstone had Myron been able to discuss innkeeping as
      though it were anything more than an interesting way of
      earning a living. But Luciano was as fanatic as himself. He
      was the first hotel-man Myron had known who would not have
      been vaguely ashamed, after the hard-boiled Anglo-American
      non-emotional tradition, to hear innkeeping glorified as
      veritably an art. Now, Myron had time, and Luciano Mora
      took it, and for hours they raved in an agreeable, childish
      manner not so unlike that of bearded painters at a
      Montparnasse café.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've been considering,' said Luciano, whose English was,
      of course, better than Myron's, 'the necessary languages
      for the front office of a real international hotel. No one
      person there need speak all of them, but naturally, there
      must be someone who speaks any given one. Well. For a while
      I was content with English, Italian, French, German,
      Spanish, Russian, Dutch, Greek, Swedish, Dano-Norwegian,
      and Hungarian. An hotel could get along if it could provide
      those. But still, I've been feeling lately that if you're
      going to have a really efficient hotel, there ought to be
      people available who speak--here's my list that I
      wrote--who also speak Japanese, Portuguese, which would
      handle Brazilians also, Czech, Arabic, Croatian, Slovene,
      Chinese--the Pekin dialect--Hindustani, Finnish, Roumanian,
      and Turkish. But honestly, with these, too, I tell to you I
      simply cannot see any need of others at all, can you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Luciano was beaming with that naive, defenceless excitement
      which is to be found only in the well-lettered and
      well-bred young European, and he was gratified when Myron
      drawled, 'No, I guess with those, any hotel could get along
      fairly well, though I don't believe you should put your
      ideals too low!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, that is so very so!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say, Luciano, remember we were talking about
      central-station power versus the hotel's own plant? Now
      I've got some really reliable figures on the standard of
      steam costs per kilowatt. . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Splendid!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mark Elphinstone dropped in to inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something had happened to the Old Man; he did not chatter
      now, and he seemed, except for occasional glorious flashes
      of bad temper, not to care what happened to his hotels. He
      would come strutting in, bark 'How's the lad, how's the
      lad--how much longer you going to take a free vacation on
      me, heh, heh?' and subside in an armchair by the window,
      looking out up the zigzag of Broadway, and for half an hour
      the two men would keep each other company in silence. Then
      he would grunt, 'Wasting time--wasting time--thought you
      brats were going to teach me this new stunt you call
      "efficiency". Huh!' And stump out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron believed that, in this dark valley between bright
      crags of industry, he had found his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not expect much of Ora now--though he did keep
      reminding himself that Ora really had paid back one of the
      dozen or so loans. When he had his secretary telephone to
      the press agent's office where Ora worked that 'Mr. Weagle
      was kind of under the weather' and would be glad if 'your
      Mr. Weagle could find a moment to drop in', Myron did not
      expect a response. But Ora came that evening, and when for
      the first time in his life he saw his older brother
      inferior to him in energy and determination, he was all
      friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't see why <i>you</i> should get run down! Nothing to
      do but hand out room-keys and collect from the goats!' he
      jeered, but it was a kindly jeer, and he actually drew up
      the covers--which Myron had just pushed down because he was
      too hot. 'Say, old man, why didn't you put me on to this
      theatrical press-game before? It's the best sport of
      anything I've ever tackled. Oh God, what we put over! Did
      you see this morning's papers about Lizette Lilydale's
      engagement to the Grand Duke of Eisbeintafelberg?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I noticed it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll bet you did. Some story! Of course she's never seen
      His Blooming Highness, but why let little . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mean it's a fake? Why, I don't know that I entirely
      like that, Ora.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now what the hell! Don't be silly! You advertise single
      rooms with bath in the hotel here for three dollars. Have
      you got one?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well . . . Yes we have!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who's occupying it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh . . . a fellow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By the year?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, sort of.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And haven't you ever served fresh peas out of a can?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not exactly--we call 'em "green peas" then, not "fresh".'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, how very scrupulous, Mr. Pickwick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I guess maybe you win, Ora.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look here, when the doc lets you out of this, why don't
      you get away for a while?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I couldn't. I'll have to get right back to work. . .
      .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why? Do you think the "hotel-world", as you always call
      it, won't be able to get on without you? Guests just be
      sleeping in the street?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, but . . .' Proudly: 'They depend on me. I'm going to
      organize a whole new system of chain purchasing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Isn't that nice! I certainly do love to watch you kid
      yourself, Myron! You really like to work, and so you do
      nothing else. You take refuge in it. You're afraid of
      adventure, you're afraid of facing anything unfamiliar, and
      so you wall yourself in with a lot of audit-forms and
      inspection-reports. And yet you get a kick out of feeling
      superior to us lazy dogs, because you think you're more
      industrious, when you're simply more timid. Why don't you,
      for once, let go of the hotel desk and try to swim? Jump on
      a ship and go to Africa?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, that's all nonsense!' Myron said feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered if it was all nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it's none of my business. Heaven knows why I should
      horn in, old man. I'm certainly sorry to see you knocked
      out. What can I do to cheer you up? Shall I bring in a
      couple of pretty actresses from our shop? Like me to come
      and read to you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, thanks, no. Just want to rest.' Myron was so touched
      that he hinted, 'By the way, kid, how are you off for
      money?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I didn't like to speak of it, but . . . You've been
      so darn decent to me, and I've been wretchedly slow about
      paying you back, but . . .'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Jump on a ship and go to Africa? No, that would be too
      much. But the kid was right. He had stuck too closely to
      his knitting. He might take a little more time off and go .
      . . But where? And it wasn't so much fun to travel alone.
      Now if he were only married. Well. But somehow he never
      seemed to meet women who were not hotel employees or
      guests, nor to think of them otherwise than as employees or
      guests. What had ever become of that lovely Tansy Quill?
      Ora had told him that when he had left Florida, six years
      ago, Tansy had been blooming and, Ora understood, engaged
      to a man with whom she was immediately going out West.
      Myron hoped she was well. But . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Where did he want to go?</i> Why should he go anywhere?
      What he wanted to do, this minute, was to get back to
      planning the systematized purchase of knife-cleaning
      machines, pilot valves, butter-cutters . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Butter-cutter, cutter-butter, butter-cutter, with a bath,
      at lowest rates . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, lord, his head! No, he wasn't well yet, not by a long
      shot. He had to go away. But <i>where?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew, suddenly. To Black Thread Centre, to the familiar
      shops and friendly citizens, to the little American House
      where he had made his start, to the fields that would be
      kindly with late May when he came out of the imprisonment
      of sickness, and most of all to his mother, whom he had not
      seen since the trip to New York he had given her two years
      ago. He had seen neither his father nor Black Thread in
      seven years. It would be, he admitted shyly, sort of fun to
      show off to the men he had known as kids--to let them know,
      if they pressed him, that he was making six thousand
      dollars a year and apartment free!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that was childish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Showing off, like a circus ring-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it <i>would</i> be fun!
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, for that least dignified and best of reasons, he
      prepared to go to Black Thread for a fortnight's vacation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day he left, Mark Elphinstone called him in to bark
      that he was to take not a fortnight but two or three
      months, on pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's the only way you can get well. If you're here where
      I can get my hands on you and shove work on you, I'll do
      it. So you damn well stay away for at least two months!'
      yelped Elphinstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that, Myron admitted to himself, was perfectly true.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron looked over his wardrobe. It was extensive; it had to
      be, in the hotel business. It was almost too extensive, for
      he would never dare to appear on the streets of a jeering
      Yankee village in the voluptuous morning coat and striped
      wedding-trousers he had worn as a desk-clerk at the
      Westward. Yet he bought seven new and expensive ties, white
      flannels and white buckskin shoes, a bathing-suit, very
      expensive, and a vaguely useful sweater, and it cannot be
      said that the researcher into Scientific Purchasing
      According to Standards showed himself any more scientific
      when he got into the hands of an uppish haberdashery clerk
      than any other oaf. He stood meekly and held up the tie
      which the clerk had so deftly twisted and cheeped, 'Yes, I
      guess that would look nice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Also he bought, unscientifically, a new pigskin bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for his mother so many stockings, blouses, inlaid
      Italian boxes, fur tippets, satin dressing-gowns, and
      canisters of imported Russian caravan tea that he had to
      get still another bag to hold them. But for his father and
      Jock McCreedy, the bartender, who alone was left of the
      American House staff that Myron had known, he needed no
      great storage space: he wisely took each of them nothing
      but a bottle of forty-year-old Bourbon whisky.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Myron who entrained at the Grand Central was thirteen
      years older than the boy who had left Black Thread for
      Torrington, at eighteen. His face was far older, thinner,
      more lined, yet his quick step was really younger than that
      of the lurching rustic who had gone doubtfully out to
      conquer the world. He had seemed a biggish club of a lout,
      then; now he was a thin sure blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was excited as they came into Bridgeport, as he changed
      cars for Black Thread, as they crept up a valley filled
      with May. He was grateful to Ora. He felt that he was
      entering upon an adventure, perfectly concealed from him
      yet greater than any he had known. Perhaps it was that,
      after learning book-keeping and fish-frying and plumbing
      and buying pillow-cases, he was going to learn Myron
      Weagle.
    </p>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He had not let his family know that he was coming. Not
      expecting him, the 'busman at the Black Thread station, who
      had sat beside him for years in school, looked at this City
      Feller and muttered "Bus, sir? Take your baggage?' with a
      show of respect which he certainly would not have yielded
      to ole Myron Wiggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      His baggage he did send to the hotel, but he walked,
      greeting each small building--the paint-shop that had once
      been a chapel, the farm-machinery warehouse, Lambkin's Drug
      Store, old Mr. Doane's noble Greek residence. 'There's
      where I socked Herbert Lambkin with a snowball!' he
      rejoiced, 'and there's--yes sir, by golly, it's the same
      old sign--there's the grocery sign we stole on Hallowe'en
      and hung on Prof. White's privy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had always heard that when you returned to your native
      village, everything seemed ludicrously smaller and shabbier
      than you remembered. He did not find it so; everything
      seemed extremely important and excellent. What city drug
      store had such a handsome display of soaps, tennis shoes,
      hot-water bags, collyriums and bottled pickles as
      Lambkin's? And that was a most interesting improvement: the
      ratty old junk-shop had been torn down and replaced with a
      handsome new galvanized-iron potato warehouse! He rounded
      the corner and saw the American House. It certainly was as
      tall as the Westward, so built upon with memories was it
      above the visible bricks. He had swept that upper balcony,
      he had washed that plate-glass window, he had tacked up the
      netting on that screen-door, he had hauled trunks out of
      that slanted basement entrance. And there was another Myron
      Weagle, a gangling broad- chested youth, sprinkling the
      sidewalk with, surely, the same battered green
      watering-can!
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly he was no longer Mr. Weagle of the Westward, but
      the unfledged Myron of thirteen years ago. He had to work
      at it, to play his city-feller joke on the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hello, Cap'n!' (But did he really sound like J. Hector
      Warlock?) 'How's chances for a room here to-night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure, boss, come in and we'll fix you right up. What you
      travelling for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Trail and discovery.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't know the company. Is it a new one?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, and probably already bankrupt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That a fact? Well, that's hard luck. Come on in and
      register.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Meek behind this self-confident young hotel man, Myron
      entered the office and beamed upon worn leather rockers,
      tall brass spittoons (not polished as he's polished them!).
      Behind the desk, in his shirt sleeves, sucking a toothpick
      and trying to play tunes on the strings of his suspenders,
      was his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gent wants a room,' said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Right here, brother. Put down your John Hancock,' said old
      Tom, as he had been wont to say it fifty times a week,
      thirteen years ago. Tom whirled the register round with the
      familiar click. The only very modern improvement was that
      the clotted pen reposed in a jar of shot, instead of in a
      potato.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is something <i>like</i> an inn,' Myron gloated to
      himself. 'No signing of an elegant little card, while the
      clerk aims his gardenia at you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The old smell of tomato soup and soap and straw matting and
      roast pork crept round him, instead of the Westward's scent
      of marble and face-powder and fur coats. He sighed
      contentedly as he signed the register.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man had not looked at Myron's face. He did not
      care. He had seen too many guests, and he was sixty years
      old now, and very grey, and the apple-jack wa'n't what
      'twas when he was a youngster, not by a long shot! He was
      uninterestedly reading Myron's signature, upside-down. Then
      he gazed, he gaped, and whooped, 'Well, I'll be
      everlastingly, teetotally doggoned! Myron! Why, boy, I
      never had such a fine surprise in my life! Come right out
      and see your Ma. Why, say, you're dressed as fine as a Jew
      pants-salesman! Well, I guess maybe it's true what they
      say--that you're making good, and pulling down your sixty
      dollars a week.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      His mother was basting a roast, wearing what might have
      been, and possibly was, the same spattered apron she had
      worn thirteen years ago. She straightened up, peered
      through crooked gold-rimmed spectacles as though she was
      frightened, and cried, 'Why, my boy, has anything gone
      wrong?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! No! Mother! I've just come back for a little
      vacation!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!' She kissed him, held him off to look at him, but with
      all her undiminished fondness there was a rustic awe of
      this man who was not so much her son as a Great Success
      from the Big City.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he had lost her, along with his home village;
      lost all of her save her unquestioning love. He felt the
      tragedy of the surrendering generation, in especial the
      tragedy of a woman like his mother who, just because she
      had dedicated herself to managing her men-folk, old Tom and
      Ora and himself, so that they would not go too wrong, and
      had never expected anything more than halfway decency in
      them, was humble before them when one of them did turn out
      normally competent and self-reliant. Had he been a leering
      failure, he might have kept her mothering intimacy!
    </p>
    <p>
      The women who serve without knowing that they serve, or
      ever whining about it!
    </p>
    <p>
      So, while he was being chatty and affectionate, he was
      reflecting, 'I've never done a thing for her. Ora was
      right! I've been so absorbed in making myself a swell clerk
      that I've forgotten to be a human being. But I will do
      something for her, something fine!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Tom did not suffer from obsequiousness to his son.
      'Well, boy, now you're here, you better strip your coat off
      and help us a little. You ought to have some pretty good
      hotel experience by this time. I want to figure out a way
      of perking up the office a little. Guests getting so
      doggone choosy these days. Maybe you might paint it for
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, the very idea!' Myron's mother turned on Tom with
      moist, gravy-smeared wrath. 'He's not going to do anything
      of the kind! Painting! Him all tired out after all his hard
      work in that great, big, huge New York hotel and coming
      home for a rest, and then you expect him to work like a
      nigger! I'm ashamed of you! Don't you want to go up and lie
      down awhile, Myron?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I want to see the old place. Had lots of good times
      here!' said Myron. 'Let's have a look at the old bar!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom found this an admirable excuse to go in for a drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went through the wash-room to the bar-room, Myron
      noticed that above the cast-iron stationary bowl still
      hung, on thin chains, a public comb, and a brush worn soft
      as old linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the bar they found Jock McCreedy, who shouted,
      'Well, I'm a son of a gun! Here's Charley Delmonico come
      back to the old shanty! Shake, boy! Mighty proud!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, he ain't done so much. He's done elegant, but why
      shouldn't he? I taught him all he knows,' observed Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's right,' said Myron. 'Say, wait just a minute. I've
      got something for you boys out in my bag.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought in the two bottles of ripe Bourbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jock McCreedy, tasting, rolled up his eyes, held up his
      hand, and murmured, 'Say, Myron, that certainly makes it up
      to a man for all the woes and tribulations of a sinful
      world, like the fellow says!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tom grumbled, 'Well, I suppose it's good licker, but it
      ain't got much kick. I like to have my stomach telegraph up
      that it's had something stronger than diluted well-water!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Jock looked at him in pious horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was considering that, though his mother was more
      beautiful than ever to him in her tragic timidity, yet Mark
      Elphinstone or Jock McCreedy was spiritually more his
      father than Tom Weagle, Alec Monlux or Luciano more his
      brother than Ora, and his tight sunless office at the
      Westward more his home, now, than Black Thread Centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Tom was droning on about his expert opinions on
      'store whisky', apple-jack, and white mule, Myron was
      thinking that he had paid a good deal for the privilege of
      helping to make a clear, efficient, merciful system out of
      the tangle of commerce and industry. His easy-going
      employees resented him as supercilious and fussy. His old
      friends--even, he now saw, perhaps his father--felt that he
      was a hard money-grubber and climber, who had lost the
      pleasant sentimentality of boyhood. The 'intellectuals',
      like Ora, were certain that he was a vulgar Philistine,
      because he provided excellent bathrooms and ice cream
      (which people wanted) instead of providing atrocious
      paintings or novels (which they didn't want). To the old
      friends, he was too top-lofty an intellectual. To the
      intellectuals, he was too low a pedlar. To the pedlars, he
      was too scrupulous a fanatic about exact financial reports
      and honest advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, let 'em all roast me. I seem to go on living through
      it,' he thought, and delighted Jock McCreedy by asking for
      a golden fizz--a drink in whose mixing, Jock believed, he
      was superior to any barman in Paris, Kokomo, Shanghai, or
      North Braintree.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      During his two months in Black Thread, while he was roaming
      the hills and lying in the sun and swimming in clear
      streams, while he was renewing acquaintance with old
      friends--or really, while he first had the leisure to
      become acquainted with them at all--he was busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mother--Dad--I've got an idea,' he said abruptly at the
      family supper-table, 'I've got an idea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't let it bite you,' said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'Hush! . . .</i> What is it, dearie?' said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I'm to carry it out, I've got to have a free hand and
      no discussions. I haven't got much time here. Now listen.
      The new thing in travel, and in hotel-patronage, is going
      to be automobile touring. Within another five or ten years,
      automobile tourists will be more important than
      travelling-men to an hotel like this, on one of the through
      routes from New York to the Berkshires and Canada. But to
      cater to them, you've got to have a garage, more flexible
      meal-hours, European plan instead of American, and a better
      decorated house all through.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rats!' said his father, authoritatively. 'Never amount to
      nothing, this auto-touring. I was reading here just the
      other day where folks are getting so sick of breakdowns and
      gasoline stink that they're going back to hosses. By 1916
      or so, you won't hardly see an auto.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes? Well, you're wrong. I'll give you my plan, dad. Take
      it or sink it, but don't argue! You ought to own this
      place, not just lease it. I'll buy it for you, and put it
      in shape, and build a garage, financing the whole thing
      through the Hotel Enterprise Bureau, of New York, and we'll
      lease it to a good small-town hotel-man. Even with the
      interest on the mortgage, I think you can count, if my
      figures are correct, on fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars
      a year clear profit to live on, and then you two can rent a
      bungalow here, and you won't have to do anything but loaf.
      I think you deserve it, ma, after all the years you've
      worked!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, it would be lovely to lie abed till seven o'clock
      every morning!' sighed Mrs. Weagle.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      His father did argue, of course, and insist that he needed
      a few days (which meant a few drinks) to do a mysterious
      something to which he airily referred as 'thinking it
      over'. But his mother's nod and smile had been enough for
      Myron. With an hour or two a day of restful business
      between rather tiring spasms of devoting himself to
      loafing, Myron in two months carried on more activity than
      had gone on in the American House in twenty-four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hired as stenographer the smart little daughter of
      Reverend Snibbs, just graduated from business school in
      Bridgeport. That by itself, said Tom, showed Myron had got
      his head full of nonsensical ideas; all his life, running
      this whole hotel, he'd been able to get along by writing
      all the necessary letters by hand. Why! In one single
      letter, he'd ordered as much as four new bureaus!
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron dictated some fifty letters to people, all over the
      country, who were advertising for the lease of country
      hotels. While Daisy Snibbs was writing these, and for the
      first time the American House was echoing to the sound of
      any faster typing than that of a drummer picking out
      reports with two fingers on a portable, Myron dashed down
      to New York, saw the Hotel Enterprise people, and
      apparently came back with assurance of finances, on a
      contract signed by Myron and by Mark Elphinstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark had observed, 'You back? Why, damn you, Myron, I told
      you to get out and loaf in the sun even if it roasts your
      damn hide off! Sign what? All right, all right, don't
      bother me with the details. I got hired men like you to
      look into those things!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared, then, that a quiet, rather shabby little
      lawyer from Torrington, whom Myron had known as a guest at
      the Eagle Hotel, had already taken an option on the
      American House building and plot; and that of the old
      livery stable behind it--and that he had taken it on behalf
      of Myron, who, with a swiftness that made his mother's head
      ache and made his father almost civil for a day or two,
      took up the option, bought the two 'parcels'. Instantly,
      workmen were busy remodelling the stable into a garage;
      tearing out stalls, putting in a cement floor, work bench,
      air pump. Other men were building behind the American House
      a twenty-room addition, with five baths, out over the alley
      and back yard, and providing for deliveries and the
      disposal of garbage through a truck-entrance into the
      basement. Others were installing five new bathrooms in what
      had been single rooms, so that eventually the American
      House would have forty-nine bedrooms and fourteen baths. A
      brisk little lady from a Hartford department-store was
      looking with dislike upon the spittoons and honest old
      scruffy leather chairs in the lobby, the equally honest
      iron beds and straight chairs in the bedrooms, and
      practically, Tom mourned, throwing them away. She then,
      according to Tom, turned the office crazy; in place of the
      straight, respectable lines of chairs along the walls, she
      put in a nasty mixture of wicker chairs with cretonne
      cushions, and leather chairs that weren't rockers, all of
      them in different groups, so that there was no geometrical
      arrangement to the room. She reduced the lordly desk to a
      mere nook in a corner, and hid the key-rack. And in the
      bedrooms she installed still other despicable wicker
      chairs, and painted pine bedsteads without one ornamental
      iron curleycue. But it was the dining-room that she most
      disfigured. She got rid of the long, solid, satisfactory
      tables and put in small separate tables with red tops on
      which, she directed, not luxurious thick cotton
      table-cloths but dinky little d'oyleys were to be used; and
      the wall she painted a shrieking canary yellow!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ora ran up to Black Thread, as the work was being
      finished, he groaned, 'Well, Myron, you've certainly
      brought some elegant urban improvements to our hick town!
      The hotel used to be just an honest country inn, that
      didn't pretend to be anything else, and now you've made it
      into a very handsome fourth-rate imitation of a city
      tea-room, as kept by our best cultured spinsters! If there
      are any J. Hector Warlocks left, they'll be just tickled
      pink to sit in a painted wicker chair and satisfy their
      appetites with a cream cheese and jelly sandwich!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's what motorists like. And it's comfortable and
      cheerful. It doesn't look like the inside of a rubber boot,
      now!' snapped Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so vexed that this time he would lend Ora only fifty
      dollars. For days--well, for hours--he wondered if his new
      delight really was pretentious and bogus. Well, damn it, if
      the place didn't suit such original intellects as Ora, they
      needn't look at it!
    </p>
    <p>
      And J. Hector Warlock? Where was he? A grand old boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had seen J. Hector for years. Jock McCreedy had
      vaguely heard that he had gone West and made money in
      mining.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder,' Myron thought uncomfortably, 'if J. Hector
      <i>would</i> like stripping for poker and sitting in one of
      Miss Bombazine's chairs? Well, anyway, Mrs. J. Hector would
      like 'em, and it's the Mrs. J. Hectors who are going to be
      considered in planning the automobile trip and the
      stopping-places and everything else, in the motor age, and
      . . . Oh, damn Ora and his damn superiority! I've got to
      hand it to his ability. He's managed to take all the fun
      out of my doing this!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The remodelling of the hotel was finished and it was rented
      (though not for a couple of months after Myron had finished
      his vacation) for a sum sufficient to pay taxes, interest,
      and depreciation, and still give Myron's father and mother
      thirteen hundred dollars a year on which to lead a life of
      cultured leisure. Mrs. Weagle read clear through a book by
      E. P. Roe!
    </p>
    <p>
      And for all his hotel-building, Myron was devoting himself
      to the task of being lazy.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He saw coming toward him, on his second afternoon in Black
      Thread, when he was wandering through the village and being
      edified by the information, 'Well, you been away quite a
      while', a tall man who looked as though he were vigorously
      going somewhere but was not quite sure where it was; a tall
      man with a high forehead, thin hair, large spectacles, and
      high black shoes. The man looked rather like Herbert
      Lambkin, but surely could not be, for Herbert was not older
      now than thirty-two or -three, and the man approaching
      looked forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Herbert Lambkin, right enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      He manhandled Myron in greeting, and spouted, 'It certainly
      is fine to see you in the old town, Myron! I hear
      everything's gone fine with you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, so so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Staying a while?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, a few weeks, I guess.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, we must see a lot of each other. There's nothing
      sadder in life than the way old friends of boyhood,
      comrades at arms, you might say, permit the currents of
      life to part them. We must have some good walks and talks,
      and try to break bread together.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yuh--yuh, sure!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sorry, Myron, we didn't see more of each other in New
      Haven, but of course we were both so busy trying our
      fledgling wings and . . . I presume you are staying with
      your father and mother?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A splendid couple! Such sterling characters!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what are you doing here in town, Bert? Aren't you
      teaching in some university? Commencement time already?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, not exactly, though I'm seriously considering one or
      two very flattering offers. But after I took my M.A. at
      Yale University, in English Literature, you know, I had an
      irreconcilable feeling that one ought, you might say, to
      enter education through the foundation, if you don't mind
      the metaphor, instead of just flitting in through the attic
      window--in other words, a really well-rounded educator
      ought first to familiarize himself thoroughly with the
      instruction of the child-mind, so for some years now I have
      been superintendent of schools here--a position, I trust,
      not without some credit and responsibility, and . . . We
      were pretty wild lads in college days, eh? beer and who
      knows what, but now I'm afraid my salad days are over, and
      I'm settled down, with a wife and a couple of bonny
      children! We're planning to build an up-to-date bungalow,
      but just for the present, my little family and I are
      staying with my father--that big, roomy house, and father
      so pitifully lonely since the death of my mother, and you
      must certainly come and break bread with us there, Myron,
      and very soon, and I'm sure Julia will be particularly glad
      to see you. I seem to remember that you were a bit sweet on
      her, as a young lad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Julia. That's right. Your sister. Yes--yes, sure--I
      was quite in love with her. Ha, ha, ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha, ha, ha!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite struck on her! Ha, ha, ha! Well, I've got to be . .
      .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ha, ha, ha! That's so. Well . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's become of Julia? She still in town?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, uh, just, uh, temporarily. She married a fine fellow
      from Sharon, Willis Wood, the electrician. He isn't exactly
      a college man, but even so, he's got one of the finest
      minds you ever encountered. He can make the mysteries of
      electricity so plain that anybody who runs may read; he
      even makes them clear to me, though, to tell the truth, and
      this despite the fact that it is one of my less amusing
      tasks, among many others, to teach physics in high school,
      but what I mean to say is, I never did have a natural
      talent for the sciences--my natural bent is more artistic
      and literary and perhaps psychological, but Willis has a
      natural insight into electricity that's simply
      astonishing--just like the grasp of commercial problems
      that I'm sure you must have, old man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see. Well, I've got to be hiking on. See you later. I
      suppose Julia lives in Sharon, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, not just at the moment. The electrical profession
      has been a little overdone lately, and Willis is waiting
      for a new opening, and meantime he's here in Black Thread,
      helping father in the store, and he and Julia are also
      living with me and father at the old home, and she has two
      lovely children, too--just lovely! So you must come and
      dine with us all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, be glad to. Well, I've got to be skipping along. Fine
      to seen you. See you soon!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was too relieved at escaping from Herbert to get any
      particular joy out of seeing the humility of the retired
      Brahmin who had once considered him an Untouchable. After
      Herbert, it was sheer ecstasy to sit on the stone bridge
      and just gently, lyrically, spit in the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, while he was defenceless in the American
      House lobby, Herbert descended upon him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, sir, it's mighty nice to see your face around the
      old town again, Myron! We certainly have missed you. This
      town needs enterprising men like you. Why, do you know, I
      haven't been able to get the business men of this town
      interested in either the Boy Scout movement or Rotarianism,
      although I have ventured to give them my opinion as an
      educator, as a University man and a Master of Arts, that
      there are no movements that tend more to develop
      patriotism, good citizenship, and the social point of view
      than these; so much so that it might be novel but quite
      sound to say that, despite the different origins of these
      two great spiritual awakenings, a Boy Scout is a young
      Rotarian, and every Rotarian is a Boy Scout in long
      trousers! I've thought of presenting this, perhaps,
      somewhat original point of view in a piece for the
      <i>Educational Review,</i> but I have been so engrossed in
      the cares of the poor driven educator that I have not had
      the time to . . . But that's not really what I dropped in
      to see you about. When I told the family of my good fortune
      in encountering you on our village street this afternoon,
      they all hailed my suggestion that you must somehow be
      coerced into coming and breaking bread with us and how
      about Friday evening, have you a date?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well . . . no . . . I . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then we won't take "no" for an answer! Friday evening
      then, six-thirty. You must pardon us if we merely have our
      customary village supper instead of the evening dinner to
      which I suppose you are accustomed in the great
      caravanserais of the Metropolis, and of course, you need
      not dress--we practically never do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's good. I didn't bring any dinner clothes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No need of them here at all, my dear fellow; no need at
      all. There are only one or two residences in the vicinity
      at which it is at all customary for the household to dress,
      except on the most formal occasions.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ('My God! Bert should tell me about Black Thread Centre!')
    </p>
    <p>
      'So, then, we'll expect you at six-thirty on Friday, and I
      need not assure you that it will be a most grateful
      re-union and commemoration of our happy childhood. Now
      there is one other thing. Uh--say, Myron . . . The fact is:
      though I prize greatly the civic opportunities that lie
      open to the village educator, touching the minds of the
      Little Ones, who will later be our stalwart citizens and
      the pillars of the Republic, when they are still dewy and
      fresh, yet this great <i>métier</i> is not what you might
      call really well paid. Just between us, and I don't want
      you to tell this to any of our good old friends as you
      encounter them in New York, but my stipend for all the toil
      and responsibility which I must shoulder is only sixteen
      hundred dollars a year! And I must begin to consider my
      wife and the little ones and . . . Now you have a great and
      influential position in the hotel-world. . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not! I hope I may have, some day, in eight or ten
      years, but I've merely made a good beginning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense, nonsense, my dear fellow. I know you better than
      you do yourself! I can see, just talking to you, Myron,
      that you have great capacity and influence, if you care to
      use it. I could discern that way back when we were boys.
      Whatever else I may know, I have a curious natural gift for
      being able to judge people's characters on sight. I suppose
      that's the key to what humble success I may have had as an
      educator. But what I mean to say is . . . Now with all your
      influence in the hotel-world, I wonder if you couldn't put
      me on to a good opening where I could make better, or
      certainly much better-paid, use of my capabilities.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why . . . well . . . uh . . . Just what training have
      you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear fellow, a man who has cared for every detail of
      the lives of hundreds of children . . . Think of what I do
      here, daily, entirely aside from teaching and formulating
      curricula. I have to choose teachers. I have to be able to
      tell instantly whether some poor grubby little urchin is
      lying to me. I have to be a really skilled technician--you
      know the natural bent I have always had for architecture,
      and possibly it was a mistake not to have followed that up,
      but I mean: I have to be no mean expert on such sordid
      details as heating, lighting, ventilation, an adequate
      supply of clean, pure drinking-water and, uh, if you will
      pardon my being so realistic, the arrangement and conduct
      of toilets. And there is perhaps a yet more important
      factor. As I understand it, the making of entertaining yet
      informative after-dinner addresses is no mean part of the
      modern Boniface's equipment and if I may say so without
      boasting, it just happens, through no virtue of my own,
      that I seem to have the gift of oratory and, I am told, of
      rather witty eloquence . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron did not get rid of him till after eleven, and he was
      not at all sure that he had made it clear he was not going
      to find Herbert a job at the Westward. Jock McCreedy, who
      had twice come in from the bar to try to rescue him, was
      very comforting. 'You've been sitting under Prof. Lambkin
      for two hours, kid. What I prescribe is a whisky sling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Jock, did you know I'm an Eminent Boniface?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, if you are, they're certainly making the Bonifaces a
      lot skinnier than when I was a young fellow. Here's how!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Like the streets of Black Thread Centre, the Trumbull
      Lambkin mansion had for Myron, at first, most of its
      ancient awe. The side porch no longer seemed unique, but
      the heavy cherrywood stairs from the hall, the heavy black
      walnut chairs and marble fireplace and glassed-in bookcases
      in the parlour still spelled for him unassailable
      respectability.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Lambkins themselves, in the mere flesh, had no
      particular sanctity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had returned to Black Thread, he had absolutely
      forgotten Julia, the queen of Gibson Girls. In the two days
      before the party supper, he had managed to work up
      considerable sentimental excitement about her, but it
      dropped dead the second he stumbled up to her in the
      parlour, breathed 'Julia!' and looked at her. She was a
      rather tall, long-faced woman, with sunken cheeks and
      wrinkles of anger about her eyes, and she seemed a
      generation older than himself. He was made nervous by the
      overpowering cordiality with which she shrieked, 'So you
      thought you were going to give your old friends the go-by
      and not come see us, now you're such a great success and
      all! I've certainly got a bone to pick with you for that!
      'Well, Myron, it's grand to see you--it certainly is just
      dandy! I want you to meet my husband, and see my kiddies .
      . . . They were bound and determined they'd stay up to see
      their Uncle Myron!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she stood, a thin woman worn with housework,
      surrounded by her jewels: Mr. Willis Wood, a youngish male
      with eyeglasses and hair parted in the middle, and two
      small children who looked extraordinarily like all other
      children; and she beamed, and Myron wiggled his face with
      grimaces and felt melancholy and a little embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had so often seen this same family group, with no magic
      for him, not even the elegance of Gibson-girlism, creeping
      awkwardly toward a hotel desk, wondering how much a double
      room would cost, and whether they could get the whole
      family into one room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was painfully cordial to Willis Wood, and bubbled,
      'Well, I certainly congratulate you, Mr. Wood, getting this
      lovely bride.' ('Grrrr! The way she used to high-hat me,
      damn her!') 'If you'll keep it to yourself, I'll admit I
      fell pretty average hard for her as a youngster, Mr. Wood!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Call me Willis,' croaked Willis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his brightest remark all evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor had the lordly Mr. Trumbull Lambkin preserved any
      grandeur. He had lost the selectness of grey side-whiskers;
      he was simply a meagre, stooped old man who mumbled that in
      his opinion, hotel-rooms in New York cost a lot of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert's wife was a plump little woman, a nice little
      woman, a cheery little woman--in fact she was a Black
      Thread Centre little woman. It seemed that her two sprigs
      also invariably called the guest 'Uncle Myron', but they
      had not learned that they did so well as had Julia's
      kitty-witties--on sight of their Uncle Myron they merely
      giggled and fled, for which he liked them better than
      anyone in the room, till Effie May came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came from the kitchen, Effie May, Julia's younger
      sister, dimpling, laughing, her softly fuzzy cheeks a
      little damp from cooking, and she was a Scandinavian
      goddess, all gold and blue and ivory, plump but
      light-footed, looking on Myron as ever so good a joke,
      looking on all life as a joke and an adventure--young
      Freya, with skin like a silver birch.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I guess you don't remember me,' she giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, it's . . . it's . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Effie May. Isn't it just the <i>silliest</i> name!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, now, Effie May, it was your grandmother's,' began
      Mr. Lambkin, clearing his throat as one who would a tale
      unfold, but he never unfolded it, for, to Myron's entire
      approbation, Effie May cut him short with, 'I guess I was
      just a brat when you first went away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You still are!' snarled Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How long you been gone, Mr. Weagle?' said Effie May.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thirteen years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, then I was only seven when you left. Was I pretty
      terrible?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, no, I wouldn't say that, but I remember your putting
      flour paste in my hat one time when I was courting Julia.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Were you courting me?' Julia was very coy about it. 'I
      declare, I wish you'd let me know. I'd of waited for you,
      instead of marrying a sawed-off trouble-shooter like
      Willis!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, is that so!' said Willis.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think we can all sit down to supper now,' said Effie
      May.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact she was not only the comeliest but the most
      sensible of the Lambkins, to Myron's way of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Between them, Julia and Effie May had produced all the
      features with which their mother, in her lifetime, had
      adorned company suppers, and of which Myron had, as a boy,
      enviously heard from outside. There were not only the
      traditional Lambkin fried chicken, corn fritters,
      crab-apple jelly, and ice-cream, but the candied
      orange-peel and brandied peaches, the last a favourite
      viand among teetotallers in Black Thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they had not arranged for much conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lambkin chewed and gulped, and grumbled that the
      chicken was tough and that it must be pretty fine for Myron
      to get back home after living 'round in strange hotels.
      Herbert champed and belched and talked without stopping,
      but as no one particularly noticed what he was talking
      about, that could not be called conversation either. The
      four children, who were supposed to be fashionably tucked
      away up-stairs, out of hearing, hung about the landing on
      the stairs and yapped, 'Maaaa-ma!' And all the rest of the
      company, including Myron, chewed and said nothing
      profounder than 'May trouble you pass salt?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Myron and Effie May were talking incessantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Herbert slammed the table to emphasize a point--it was
      to the effect that education for children was, or possibly
      was not, a good idea--Effie winked at Myron. When Mr.
      Lambkin muttered to Julia something ending '. . . where did
      you <i>put</i> the toothpicks, then?' Effie giggled softly,
      and her glance and Myron's crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had to go down to school-board meeting for half an
      hour after supper, Julia had a chance then, and Myron
      understood why he had been invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed, according to Julia, that Herbert had a muted
      affection for Myron; that he regarded him as the best
      innkeeper since Noah; that the brightest moment in his life
      was Myron's return to Black Thread; that he had always
      longed to be a hotel-keeper; and that Myron would do a
      favour not only to Herbert, to herself, and the entire
      village and township of Black Thread, but to the travelling
      public, if he found Herbert a tidy little job in
      hotel-keeping at three or four thousand a year--for a
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sure any hotel-owner would be awfully glad to get a
      man like him, with his fine education and social position
      and all his training in caring for children. They must have
      a terrible time, having to depend on ex-waiters and like
      that,' gurgled Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron took to himself a good deal of credit for not saying
      'I am an ex-waiter'. He felt helpless. But as his eye roved
      desperately round the parlour with its forbidding
      wall-paper of dark red, it rested on Effie, and she dimpled
      sympathetically at him, and gave him strength to say
      brazenly, 'I'll certainly look into opportunities for him
      the minute I get back to New York, though the business is
      dreadfully crowded just this <i>minute.</i> If I were he, I
      wouldn't give up my teaching job for a few months yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May giggled faintly. Julia looked at her savagely,
      and began to talk about 'our old gang'. They were, it
      seemed, severally and collectively, a 'bunch of cabbage
      heads'. This was married to a cat, this other was a cat
      herself, and the third was a vile housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the persons of whom Julia thus disposed were precisely
      the lords and ladies of Black Thread who as princelings had
      most clung about her on the archducal side porch, and whose
      grandeur Myron had most envied. Yet he could get no
      satisfaction out of hearing their former sovereign offering
      them up to him as sacrifices. He would not have liked it,
      but he would have felt that life was more integral and
      logical if she had snapped, 'I love all my old friends
      implicitly, and you, you pot-walloper, you may have more
      money than we now, but we consider you as fortunate even to
      be allowed to sit there in mother's old chair'. He listened
      miserably, and wanted to smoke--apparently, even at this
      apex of modernity, 1911, one still did not smoke in a
      Lambkin parlour--and he escaped before the return of
      Herbert, although it appeared that Herbert would be
      agonized at missing his old chum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May walked to the gate with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm glad you haven't turned out a crab, like ole Julia and
      Bert,' said Effie May. 'Don't they love to knock!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You think I'm not so bad?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You--I think you're just won'erful!' giggled Effie May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Won'erful, he was to learn, was her favourite word.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was delighted to find one person in Black Thread who
      considered life won'erful.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look!' he said urgently. 'I'll be just loafing around, for
      a few weeks. Can't you and I--we're the young, unmarried
      generation, apparently--can't we get off into the country?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think that would be won'erful. Some of us kids are going
      to have a picnic on Lake Nekobee, next Sunday afternoon.
      Could you come along?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd love to,' said Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he again walked from the Lambkin mansion to the
      American House, falling into love with a Lambkin daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's twenty. Of course I'm pretty mature. Still, at that,
      I'm only eleven years older. Just right. Trained
      housekeeper. She certainly would be useful in checking up
      the housekeeping department in . . . No! I won't have
      <i>my</i> wife working!' reflected that mature New Yorker,
      Mr. Myron Weagle.

      There was peace and healing in the hillside meadow, but no
      languor, so brisk were the small breezes; and the late
      spring flowers among stately grasses were bits of scattered
      enamel--white and purple daisies, buttercups, red clover,
      and the Pompeian red of devil's paint brush. Myron
      contentedly brushed the side of his hand against the
      tickling grasses, as he lay on his back, more relaxed than
      for years, then clasped the hand of Effie May, sitting up
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was good, to have a companion in the adventure of
      leisure. Her presence completed him. He had, in offices, in
      long talks with Alec Monlux and Mark Elphinstone and
      Luciano Mora, been so incomplete, the male without the
      female. And what freshness and goodness there was in the
      hand of this untainted girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, he meditated, been reasonably free of viciousness,
      and most of the guests had been good and decent, yet there
      had inevitably been so many others--the little hotel
      thieves, their very pettiness making it the nastier to have
      to deal with them, the 'skippers' and passers of 'rubber
      cheques', irritating in their angry roars of innocence, the
      suicides who so very bloodily brought shame to hotel-rooms,
      the sneaking immoralists, and the equally unpleasant prudes
      who objected, publicly, to other people's private
      immoralities. After the incessant tedium of bickering with
      such pests, Effie May's gaiety was the water of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be fun, Myron exulted, to see new great things
      with an unjaded girl like this--cities and tall towers and
      mountains. Not much fun to have these by himself, to be
      unable to share them. Of course her family <i>was</i> a
      good deal of a pain in the neck, but . . . All the more
      reason for saving her from them! . . . If he did get an
      hotel job for Herby, little Herby, the bounding Bert, it
      would be off in Alaska, with no return ticket! . . . Effie
      May, the poor kid! To do things for her, to show her the
      world--yes, and to have her show it to him, with her
      fresher and less weary eyes, that would give some purpose
      to life!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you ever want to travel, Effie?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I'd just love to. It would be won'erful!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How much have you travelled?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, not hardly at all. I drove with Julia and Willis up to
      Lake Bomoseen. That was before they had to sell the car.
      And Papa took me to New York once for two days, he had to
      go on business, my! I wish we'd known where you were, then,
      that was two years ago, we'd of gone and called on you,
      would you have been glad to see us?'
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'Would</i> I! You bet I would! I'd of shown you the
      whole shop, and given you a good bottle of wine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She giggled. 'That would be won'erful. But I guess wine
      would of been too strong for my poor little head. I never
      did taste it--except maybe some elderberry wine and
      dandelion wine and so on, and I just <i>hate</i> beer, it's
      so bitter. But oh, I would of loved to of seen a really big
      hotel; we stayed at a horrid pokey little place, hardly any
      bigger than that American House . . . Oh! How dreadful of
      me! I forgot the American House was . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I agree with you. The American House is a fierce
      little dump. But you just wait till I finish remodelling
      it! It won't be any Inside Inn for size, but it will be as
      comfy and cheerful as any city hotel. But how would you
      like to travel way beyond that?--say to Europe, and see
      cathedrals and castles and a lot of art galleries and so
      on?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I'd love it! It would be just won'erful! I'm just as
      ignorant as a rabbit, Myron. I don't know a blessed thing
      about art or music or any of those things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well if you want to know, kid, neither do I! I certainly
      have picked up a fine junk-heap of information about
      electric dish-washers and combustion recorders and steel
      furniture, but the penalty I've paid is that I don't know
      much else. And God how I want to! I want to <i>know!</i>
      Everything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I bet you do, Myron. My! I always feel you know so
      much . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't. I'm an illiterate hash-hustler. And I like to
      learn. I wish I knew all about painting. I wish I could
      spiel French and German and Italian like Luciano Mora--he's
      a fellow at the Westward; you'll meet him some day and fall
      so hard for him I'll be jealous! And I wish I'd read all
      the poets, as Ora has.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'll bet he hasn't--of course I've only seen a
      little of Ora since I was a kid, but I'll bet he's a
      fourflusher, like my own darling brother . . . Gee, Bert
      never stops talking!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now you look here, Effie May, that's the first time I ever
      knew you to be dumb. Ora is a very intellectual fellow,
      with the most extraordinary imagination and originality and
      insight into character and so on and so forth, and he's
      certainly read all the poets and authors--you can tell from
      the way he keeps referring to them. Of course to an old
      stick-in-the-mud like me, sometimes he seems pretty
      impractical and careless about financial details--I guess
      he'll always be hard-up and need a little help--but you
      can't expect a sensitive, sympathetic mind like his to
      stand the grind the way a hard-boiled old drudge like me
      does.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't have you calling yourself names! You aren't a
      stick-in-the-mud! You get ever so much fun out of trying
      new stunts--like putting that lovely new cretonne in the
      American House office. I won't have you calling yourself
      names! And let me catch Ora or Bert or anybody else doing
      it, and I'll scratch their eyes out!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her, her golden hair of a Norse goddess
      glistening as she bent a little over him. 'Would you,
      honestly?' he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She whispered back, 'I certainly would!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her down to him. So soft! She stooped, kissed his
      cheek with reckless heartiness, and sprang up, crying,
      'Come on, silly! We'd better keep walking!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They tramped over the hilltop, through the scarlet patches
      of devil's paint brush, their clasped hands swinging as
      though they were sixteen. In her free hand Effie May
      carried her old-fashioned flowery sunbonnet. Her sister
      Julia laughed at her for affecting anything so out of date
      and rustic, and Herbert scolded that if she was willing to
      disgrace <i>herself</i> socially by such
      <i>childishness,</i> at <i>least,</i> she might <i>try</i>
      to think a <i>little</i> of <i>his</i> official position,
      but she persisted in it, every summer--her only marked
      rebellion against the security of Black Thread Presbyterian
      circles. Now, when she appealed to that urban social
      arbiter, Myron Weagle, he assured her that there was
      nothing smarter than sunbonnets, as regularly worn by Van
      Rensselaers at Newport, and she panted with gratitude--and
      the unaccustomed walking--as they swung down the hillside
      to the Black Thread highway.

    </p>
    <p>
      He admitted that he was probably sentimental in seeking, on
      this tramp by himself, the spot where he had stretched out
      beside Effie May, but it had a gay sanctity for him, and
      there he squatted, hands about knees, brooding while he
      looked unseeing across the valley of pastures, elm groves,
      and quiet old yellow houses with red barns.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's young yet. She doesn't know much. But how she will
      expand to the world outside! And me, what am I going to do?
      In ten or twelve years, I may be Mark's successor, if
      Carlos Jaynes doesn't cut my throat and convince the Old
      Man I'm a small-town book-keeper. But even that . . . It
      would be just a routine job. Old Mark created the chain,
      and his successor would just carry it on. I'd like to do
      something entirely new.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And that hour he began--with notes on the backs of visiting
      cards, transferred later to a handsome pocket vademecum
      with seal binding and gilt edges, labelled, 'Hotel Project
      Notes'--what must, in exactness, be called 'The Note-Book
      of a Poet': the thoughts, story-plots, visions,
      observations, aspirations which he longed some day to
      write, only not in words but in steel and brick and
      composition flooring and best-quality bed-linen.

      Myron's note-book was a quarter filled before he had
      thrashed through the problem of what he really wanted to
      do--aside from immediately marrying Effie May Lambkin. In a
      sacred excitement he came full upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an hotel-man, a professional innkeeper. Good. Well
      then, he wanted to build, to own, and without interference
      to conduct, the one Perfect Inn!
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to create it as Ora (he supposed) wanted to
      create the Perfect Poem. And since in cities the modern
      hotel must be a combination of inn, restaurants, whole
      alleys of shops, rooms that were not so much bedchambers as
      offices for out-of-town business men, and gathering-place
      for conventions and public dinners and weddings, therefore
      he wanted his Perfect Inn to be in the country, by itself,
      altogether devoted to those blessings which no electricity
      or gasoline motor had made antiquated--perfect food and
      perfect wine and perfect bedrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assemble the best notions of all the best innkeepers,
      American or European. Conceive it not as a quick and
      certain way of making money, nor as a happy-go-lucky
      fulfilment of somebody's notion that 'I guess we need
      another hotel around here', but as a planned, perceived,
      exuberantly rich yet severely chastened idea, noble as an
      epic and lively as a swimming-race.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll do it!' Myron vowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in his rickety room at the American House till dawn,
      and by dawn he had filled eight pages of his handsome new
      Poet's Note-Book (only it never occurred to Myron himself
      to call it that) with plans for the Perfect Inn (and he
      never called his vision that, either, but only 'The best
      resort hotel that can be built'). From his experience, his
      reading, his talk, he put down all the things to be
      avoided, such as the equal horrors of indolent 'service'
      and of service that was presumptuously chummy; and all the
      things to be desired, such as, since Luciano Mora was
      always scolding that American inns do not use the good
      out-of-doors, a tea and luncheon terrace, vine-sheltered
      and looking on sea or lake or mountain-valley.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Being a trained cuisinier, Myron was struck by the
      excellence and originality of the picnic lunch provided by
      Effie May. It consisted of ham and cheese sandwiches,
      hard-boiled eggs wrapped in waxed paper, coco-nut
      layer-cake, rather squashed, and coffee in a thermos
      bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had tramped three miles out of town, to Elm Hill, on
      the shore of Lake Nekobee. The hillside was thick with
      spruce and birch groves and a few elms, broken by pasture
      and meadow, and the lake, some two miles wide, was very
      clear, with sandy bottom, no marshy shores, and wooded
      hills or rolling farms all round it. There were a few
      flimsy summer cottages at one end, near the hamlet of East
      Black Rock, with its general store and two churches, but
      for the most part Lake Nekobee had not, in this day before
      the flood of motor cars, been popularly discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say, this is <i>it!</i>' Myron cried suddenly when, full
      of hard-boiled egg and contentment, they lolled on a hot
      boulder above the lake, and Effie May smoked a cigarette
      with (it was A.D. 1911) extensive coughing and a gleeful
      feeling of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is what?' demanded Effie May.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is just the place for my resort hotel. Nice hills,
      lovely clean lake, quiet, only three miles from the depot
      in town, and a hundred and twenty from New York.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you thinking about a resort hotel?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, sort of.' Humbly Myron spoke of his epic. 'Some day
      I'd like to build the best country inn in America--real
      out-door place, kind of simple, and yet as good grub and
      service and beds as the Plaza. You see--oh, really take
      some pains, put some thought into it, profit by all the
      other fellows' mistakes, and make it a corker. Do you think
      that would be fun?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, I think it would be lots of fun. That would be--it
      would be won'erful!' said Effie May.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, the lady having approved his armour, his lance, and
      the general sensibleness of the whole expedition, the
      knight was ready to ride out with no more misgivings about
      his ability to bring back the Holy Grail.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The building of even a few shore cottages along Lake
      Nekobee had raised land-prices and when, six months later,
      after thinking it all over a few hundred times, Myron
      bought the Elm Hill property bordering on the lake, it cost
      him ten thousand dollars for one hundred acres--two
      thousand down, and two thousand a year. Before he had
      finished paying for it the land was worth two hundred an
      acre.

    <p>
      T. J. Dingle was in his early thirties, but he was the
      president of the Black Thread National Bank. His
      grandfather, a farmer, a tobacco-grower from the
      Connecticut Valley, had started the first large dairy near
      Black Thread, and been founder of the public library. His
      father, also president of the First National but dead now a
      year, had been an upstanding, grey-moustached old
      gentleman, and he had been the first man whom Myron had
      ever seen riding a horse just for pleasure--the picture of
      a general on his tall bay. No Dingle in known history had
      worn a chin whisker or an icy eye, or foreclosed a mortgage
      if he could help it, or been suspected of exceeding the
      legal rate of interest by tacking on 'inspection fees', or
      shown any of the other interesting traits common to country
      bankers in fiction, and sometimes in real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      T. J. Dingle himself was slim, eager but restrained, with a
      face out of which all the slackness and fat had been
      carved. He was the squire of Black Thread, and Myron
      remembered that the young Julia had been flattered when Ted
      Dingle had occasionally joined her side-porch court.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if the Lambkins (aside from Effie May) had been
      inclined to believe Myron's assertion that he was only a
      small valve in the Elphinstone engine--as doubtless they
      would have, as soon as they got used to the sight of
      him--they would have been kept respectful by viewing the
      new friendship of Myron and T. J. Dingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Myron went into the bank to cash a cheque, the third
      day of his visit, Dingle insisted on his coming into the
      private office, struggled a little with remarks about the
      weather, and abruptly invited him to dinner--his the only
      house in Black Thread that had the affectation of evening
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron found that the dolorous old green and brown Dingle
      Mansion, with its high cupola, had been made almost
      tolerable with white paint and the removal of the
      scrollwork above the porch; the gloomy rooms had been
      brightened, and filled with books and flowers. Dingle's
      young wife, from New Haven, was given to gay sprigged
      house-dresses, playing the piano, and making Lobster
      Newburgh, all excellent habits. Sitting with them, in the
      first easy household he had found in Black Thread, Myron
      realized that T. J. Dingle was at once shrewder and more
      cultivated than anyone he had met since he had left
      home--except perhaps the supercilious Carlos Jaynes of the
      Elphinstone organization, who managed to combine Pan Dandy
      Lunch Rooms and dislike of Myron with devotion to Brahms
      and El Greco.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Myron a little strange that his two intimates
      in his boyhood town should not have been his own family,
      nor Herbert Lambkin, nor any of the lively ruffians with
      whom he had once loafed at the livery-stable, but two
      familiar strangers whom, as the baby Effie May and the
      aloof Ted Dingle, he had seen without knowing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it came to pass that at least one evening a week, while
      the Maison Lambkin fluttered more and more unctuously,
      Myron and Effie May spent with the Dingles, and had thus a
      social recognition and fixation without which their shy
      affection might not have crystallized into marriage.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He never did propose. It is, indeed, doubtful whether
      anybody in history, outside of novels, ever has really
      'proposed'. They simply came to know that they liked each
      other and excited each other, and that, presumably, they
      were going to be married.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were walking by the river in that last light of an
      early summer afternoon when the trees stand up like
      pyramids of green light and the world is content to
      slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her hand to his breast, stroking it, and trembled,
      'I guess--it kind of looks--it looks as if we'd be married.
      Let's be married in a fortnight, and run off to Canada or
      Maine or some place, before I have to get back to work. . .
      . We'll have a lovely suite in the Westward, and I'll make
      Mark redecorate the bathroom with marble floor and coloured
      tiles and a shower, besides the tub.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A suite? That would be awfully exciting. It would be--oh,
      in a big New York hotel like that--it would be perfectly
      won'erful!' said Effie May.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      And so Myron did have to send hastily to New York for his
      morning coat and striped trousers and four-in-hand and have
      Luciano Mora take a chance on getting him a silk hat of the
      right size--his first silk hat, and he wore it to theatres
      four times the first year, twice the second year, never at
      all afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were married at the Presbyterian Church with (to
      Myron's mild astonishment) bridesmaids, flower-girls, Ora
      as best man, and T. J. Dingle, Luciano Mora, and Herbert
      Lambkin as ushers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia had a perfectly won'erful time weeping, and informing
      the world that she had to be mother to 'poor little
      Effens', and Myron had never so loved Effie as when he
      overheard her snarling to Julia, 'Oh, for God's sake cut
      out the mothering and find my darn garters!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And Myron had a perfectly horrible time. He ardently hated
      everyone at the wedding except Effie May, his mother,
      Luciano, Dingle, and Ora. He had started in hating Ora,
      also, for it was just the day after Ora had informed him
      that his remodelling of the American House had turned it
      from an honest inn into a gifte-shoppe. But this morning,
      at the church, when he was riding hard on Myron in the
      parlours till the bride should have come up the aisle, Ora
      re-established himself by producing a pint of rye, ordering
      Myron to have a sip, and grunting, 'Well, I never thought
      any Lambkin would ever crawl out from under the rocks--God,
      that Herby is a stiff!--but your Effie May is a peach;
      pretty as Lillian Russell, and a jolly kid.
      Congratulations. And I <i>have</i> got the damn ring all
      safe, right here! There they come! Hey, hey! Keep your
      nerve! One more quick swig!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron thought that the parson, as Effie May and he stood
      before him, sniffed rather hoitily, but he lived through
      it, and ceased to be a young bachelor. He began, now, the
      second half of his life, as he squeezed her hand and
      muttered 'My wife!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ouch!' she said, and giggled, and he glowed like a cat on
      the hearth.

      BONIFACE A BENEDICT
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Greeter Myron S. Weagle, long one of the right-hand men of
      Mine Host Mark Elphinstone of the Westward Ho, in the Big
      Town, and formerly Boniface of the Tippecanoe Lodge, Fla.,
      than whom none among the younger hoteliers is better known
      for dispensing lavish hospitality and for postprandial
      eloquence, has let himself in for the chime of merry
      wedding-bells, the fortunate lady being Miss E. Laski of
      Thread Mill Centre, Massachusetts, and the lucky couple are
      now spending their honeymoon in the golden isle of Bermuda.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Blazing white reefs, white-edged breakers, deep waters that
      shaded from stainless green into pure blue, plaster houses
      white and pink and yellow among dark cedars, gardens of
      palm and banana, the creak of an old barouche with a darky
      driver proceeding with no haste, since it made no
      difference where they were going nor whether they ever went
      there--late-summer Bermuda, and Myron and Effie May
      honeymooning, and discovering, both of them, their first
      foreign land.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the shops should sell coral and mother-of-pearl, and
      herring-bone heather just come from London; that the
      policemen should have an English accent and the postmen
      wear funny hats; that they should dine in a garden of
      oleanders and roses; it was all a fairy tale that made up
      for the tragic honeymoon discoveries that she was likely to
      giggle at his enthusiasms over non-dripping hotel teapots
      and folding baggage-stands, that she liked to eat
      chocolates in bed, with the results that she made nasty
      brown daubs on the pillows and afterward had the most
      indelicate fits of indigestion; that he made horrid noises
      in the bathroom and wore long thin cotton and wool
      underwear instead of this jaunty new 'athletic' sort, and
      that neither of them had had enough experience of
      love-making to do it gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did warm his heart by regarding him as an authority
      on everything in general. Since he had been in Florida and
      Missouri, she happily assumed that he knew everything about
      reefs, tides, deep-sea fishing, wistaria, planter's punch,
      the intimate biology of the coral anthozoa, the varieties
      of palms, the constitutions of the several British
      colonies, the social life of the Governor of Bermuda, and
      the productivity of banana plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he told her everything, to their mutual satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few of the great hotels which were later to make Bermuda,
      next to Paris, the most agreeable suburb of New York had
      yet been erected, but they stayed at a shiny pink and blue
      inn between Harrington Sound and the open ocean, and so
      agreeable was it to sit out under the coconut palms after
      dinner, or at tea-time, with hot buttered English scones
      and marmalade in stone jars, that Myron's concept of the
      Perfect Inn grew and kicked and crowed--doubtless the more
      so because he had never dared expose it to the snicker of
      Ora.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would take years for him to accumulate the necessary
      money and, plainly, to know enough, but he would create
      this right and beautiful thing and it would be his excuse
      for having lived. So they came back to New York and to
      work, looking a little regretfully from the boat deck of
      the steamer along the nickled wake to the bright reefs of
      Bermuda.

    <p>
      From 1911 to 1926, from his thirty-first year to his
      forty-sixth, Myron was busy about this hotel and that in
      New York City and Philadelphia and Long Island and
      Wilmington, except for eight months in 1917 and 1918, when
      he was a captain in the Quartermaster's Department, saving
      the world by sitting in a warehouse in New York and buying
      blankets and bacon and beans. He never lost his fantastic
      notion of the Perfect Inn, but each year he felt that he
      was not yet ready, and he had to content himself with
      filling new volumes of his little books of 'Hotel Project
      Notes'.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>What is an art, what is a profession, what is a
      business, what is a job? Is a man who runs a great grocery
      store like Park &amp; Tilford, Acker, Charles, or the gr
      dept of Macy's just a business man, while anybody who makes
      smart pictures of girls is artist, and doc or lawyer who
      thinks about nothing but making money a professional and
      cranky old prof who goes on handing out same lectures yr
      after yr a scholar and not just on a white collar job?</i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron did institute new methods as purchasing-agent for the
      whole Elphinstone chain. Till now, the stewards and other
      buyers even for great hotels had not been so very different
      from Tom Weagle, whose system of purchasing for the
      American House had been to stamp into the local butcher
      shop and drone, 'Whacha got to-day? That legga lamb any
      good?' But Myron and other pests of his kind made the whole
      process as delicate and complicated as determining the
      weight of Saturn.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three and a half years he was made chief assistant to
      Mark Elphinstone, to help direct all the hotels and
      restaurants, with the title of third vice-president of the
      company. Mark himself never told him, but Myron knew that
      there had been a battle before he got the position, which
      was really that of heir-apparent to the throne of the
      little Napoleon. Carlos Jaynes, now resident manager of the
      Westward, had fought sharply for it. Though Elphinstone
      owned more than half the stock of the company, the
      millionaire brother-in-law of Jaynes and his friends
      controlled over forty per cent, and they had supported
      Jaynes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had won, though Mark's latest secretary, a young
      Y.M.C.A. man named Clark Cleaver, told him that the Old Man
      had been gambling on the market, and might have to sell
      some of his stock in the company. But Myron forgot his
      precariousness in working out life with Effie May, in
      accumulating plans for the Perfect Inn, and, after the
      comparative simplicity of being purchasing-agent only, in
      the whirlwind of dealing with every sort of detail of every
      sort of hotel and restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Every detail of hotel-keeping--and J. Hector Warlock had
      been right, years ago, when he had instructed the young
      Myron that an hotel-keeper had to be a combination of
      nursery-governess, financier, steam-fitter, detective,
      upholsterer, architect, dietitian, garbage-handler,
      ventilation-engineer, lawyer, orchestra-director,
      psychiatrist, florist, guide to the city, state, nation,
      and all hotels in Switzerland, the Argentine, and South
      Africa, garage-manager, after-dinner speaker, and supreme
      expert on insurance, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Insol prob of hotel-man matter of 'morals'. To what
      extent should he let all guests do exactly what they like
      so long as pay bills, not disturb other guests, &amp; not
      get hotel bad reputation--couples probably unmarried,
      strange gents possibly fugitives from justice, even
      degenerates. Luciano Mora insists hotel-man no more right
      censor than physician refuse treat immoral or criminal
      patients; he says would you excuse Methodist hotel-man if
      refused take in Jewish, Catholic, Buddhist, or atheist
      guests. Alec says, yes, but immoral guests, so-called,
      sooner or later get joint bad name gradually even if at 1st
      no one kick. I don't know. Guess will be slack enough to do
      like Elphinstone and most canny mgrs.--not notice anything
      'immoral' unless made to by kicks.</i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Every sort of detail of every sort of hotel--the details
      that the guest, interested only in his soft bed and his
      dinner, never knows.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Carlos Jaynes suggested that, though for their Buffalo,
      Worcester, Akron, Hartford and Scranton houses, English
      menus were all right, it would give what he called 'cachet'
      to the Westward to have the menus, at least in the Georgian
      Dining Room, in French. On the sample which Jaynes
      submitted, Myron found the item, 'Le ham and eggs'. Now
      that was perfectly sound, for had Jaynes not taken it from
      the menu of the Savoy Grill, in London?
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron sent Jaynes's memorandum up to Mark Elphinstone, with
      one of his own: 'This seems an elegant idea, only I think
      the item I have checked should be in more idiomatic French
      and read "Le ham et eggs". It certainly would make a
      regular guest out of any Kansas buyer to know that he could
      get le oatmeal, gli scrambled eggs, y los wheat cakes avec
      der maplesirop instead of just plain grub in our shop.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That was enough.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron's chief crusade, as Elphinstone's shadow and later as
      a manager on his own, made him unpopular among his
      successful colleagues, for it was against undue reverence
      for publicity and for what was called 'service'. He had a
      theory that however much the lonely guest, unused to
      hotels, delighted in being pumphandled by clerks and
      assistant manager, called by name by the doorman, and
      entertained by the meteorological discussions of the
      bell-boys and elevator-runners, there were just as many
      guests, veterans of travel and of hotel-living, who wanted
      to be let alone; who, safely away from the excessive
      attention and domestic discussion of Home, enjoyed being
      invisible. And such guests, he believed, resented such bids
      for publicity as the flourish with which a celebrated
      <i>maître d'hôtel,</i> boomed as 'official taster', tasted
      every dish to be served at a large banquet, though he might
      be so full of highballs that he could not tell well-done
      terrapin from over-roasted canvas back; and such guests
      were irritated by a wild hurrah about having the more
      expensive suites accurately decked out with 'period
      furniture'.
    </p>
    <p>
      ('Just the same, Ora was wrong about my putting too much
      tea-room agony into the American House when I remodelled
      it. Well, maybe he wasn't quite as wrong as I thought then,
      four years ago!')
    </p>
    <p>
      Invariable courtesy, swift fulfilling of orders, honest
      conferences of department-heads as to what guests really
      wanted--Myron did not see why these obvious necessities of
      hotel-keeping should be trumpeted forth as extraordinary,
      nor why a tired and dusty guest, already jumpy over being
      made conspicuous by the room-clerk's caroling 'Boy! Take
      Mr. Jones up to 755', should be forced to admire placards
      reading approximately: 'Look at how tenderly we care for
      you, and notice us, please notice us, and don't forget that
      whether you use talcum powder or not, there is a nice free
      can of it in your bathroom'.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not see why a guest who had made a large night of
      it, and was doubtful whether he would last till breakfast,
      should be compelled to listen on the telephone to a birdie
      chirp of 'Good morning, this is roo-oom service, I shall be
      pleased to take your order' before he could snarl his
      needs. He did not see why a guest who had been perfectly
      contented with his room and breakfast should be compelled
      to think up a polite answer to repeated and patently
      mechanical inquiries as to whether everything was all
      right. If everything weren't all right, Myron suspected,
      the guest would let the management know! He wanted good
      food, a comfortable bed, a comfortable chair with a good
      light for reading, quick service on laundry and
      clothes-pressing and mail, accurate answers to his
      questions as to how to get about the city, but--or so Myron
      insisted to his colleagues--he rarely wanted to be mothered
      or brothered or wet-nursed, nor did he yearn to give
      information about the health of his Little Ones either to
      strange insurance-agents or to cooing hotel-clerks.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The old-fashioned tavern-keeper, before 1860, used to
      enjoy being boss under his own roof, and bawling out
      anybody who didn't take a shine to dirty beds and greasy
      food. The new-fashioned one enjoys feeling what a gent he
      is, to be so kind to strangers for whom he obviously
      doesn't personally care a hang. Both are bad, and neither
      has anything to do with providing good beds and grub at a
      fair price', said Myron in a speech at a convention of the
      Hotel Greeters, and for such heresy, such red revolution,
      he was penalized all his life. . . . As well inform a
      convention of city specialists owning $3600 motor cars that
      they are not necessarily more clever than the country
      doctor in a second-hand flivver!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so much a crank as not to be much edified by such
      texts in elevators as 'Daily Message to Guests and Staff:
      If you have friends in every place, in every place you will
      find charm,' or 'To employees: Remember it is your duty to
      make every guest feel at home.' This, in a fifteen-hundred
      room hotel where nobody save a centipede could feel at
      home! And it occurred to Myron that a fair number of guests
      might be so earnestly sick of wives, yelping children,
      solicitous mothers-in-law, balky furnaces, household bills,
      trouble with cooks, and getting the lawn mowed that the one
      reason why they came to hotels at all was to get away from
      feeling at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over this greeting-card philosophy Myron had his chief
      differences with Mark Elphinstone. He admired the Old Man,
      loved him like a son, but Elphinstone would scribble and
      gloat on and have printed a torrent of profound aphorisms
      that didn't mean anything. Among his deeper and more moving
      revelations were:
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart of an hotel is its kitchen; the Front Office its
      nervous system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotel success is a mathematical formula: co-operation plus
      pep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't be stingy with towels. For every guest that asks for
      one more there is another that requires one less.
    </p>
    <p>
      A modern hotel is like an automobile. It is made up of
      thousands of parts and not one can be neglected. If the boy
      in the washroom isn't on the job, the chief clerk in the
      come-to-Jesus collar can't function.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hotel is the weary traveller's temporary home and his
      room is his castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the fourth or fifth largest industry in the United
      States, hotels proudly take their rightful place in the
      nation's economic solidarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile of welcome from behind the desk is like a beacon to
      a mariner at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam was the first hotel-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, and what of it?' snapped Myron, as the messages
      fluttered on his desk, on forms with 'Elphinstone Service
      Snappers' printed in red at the top. Well, Elphinstone was
      otherwise an excellent boss. There were hotel proprietors
      who used morphine or read paragraphs from Elbert Hubbard
      aloud or wanted their pictures in the papers or expected
      you to make engagements for them with pretty women guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And maybe I'm all wrong, anyway. Maybe I'm too much
      opposed to hand-shaking and mottoes as a way of holding
      business. Probably my worst fault as an innkeeper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wrong. His worst fault as an innkeeper was his
      inability to be more than commonly civil and attentive,
      ever to be an unctuous foot-kisser, to overdemanding
      guests, even when they were Celebrities.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the dramas of his trade was the reception of
      Celebrities--senators, generals, circumnavigatory aviators,
      prize fighters, diplomats, explorers, foreign lecturers.
      Some of them did not consider their visitations so great a
      favour that they expected to have accommodations free, and
      there were even rare souls who did not want publicity and
      did not expect the hotel press-agent to let the newspapers
      in on the secret of their presence. But there were others
      who expected not only Carlos Jaynes and Myron to be
      awaiting them in the lobby, with an entourage of clerks,
      porters, bell-boys, the press-agent, and a corps of
      reporters and photographers, but that Mark Elphinstone
      himself (they always had a card to him) should devote a day
      to the pleasure of giving them, free, the best suite in the
      hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      How warmly they strode from the taxi into the hotel! How
      surprised they were to be interviewed! How modestly they
      explained they knew nothing about politics--and then proved
      it! How reluctantly they sipped of what they believed to be
      Mark's private stock of Bourbon--it was a private stock,
      right enough, but not the sort he drank. How buoyantly they
      said, of a private suite priced at thirty dollars a day
      which they were getting for ten, 'Oh, this is quite all
      right. It will do very nicely--very nicely! The price is a
      little steep, but I am sure I shall be very comfortable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And you had to send them flowers, and a bushel of fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, you could sometimes get these from the
      leftovers of last night's banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just as hard to swallow as the Celebrities who expected
      you to telephone about them to city editors--who would
      growl, 'Who the hell is he? What's he got to say? My supply
      of dumb sob-squad reporters is pretty well exhausted
      to-day'--were the other, usually more authentic Celebs who
      really wanted to be let alone. When they crossed the
      Atlantic, they kept their names off the passenger-list, in
      the touching belief that no one would know they were
      coming, though the London or Paris correspondents had
      cabled of their coming before they sailed. Down on these
      unfortunates, the reporters came via the transom, the
      keyhole, the fire escape, the fireplace, or just generally
      through the air, and the Celebs blamed the hotel
      management; they always said, 'I did think that You People
      might be trusted to make at least some <i>slight</i> effort
      to respect my wish for privacy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      After a Celebrity, Myron appreciated a sound and seasoned
      travelling-man.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Conventions--oh God, conventions!
    </p>
    <p>
      As restaurant and banquet manager, Myron had had to make
      love to lodge secretaries and committee chairmen to
      persuade them to hold their dinners at the Westward. Now,
      as assistant to the president, he had to back up the
      several resident managers of the hotels in securing
      conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      To an hotel-man, a convention is a nightmare of being for
      ever caught in a subway rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an Elphinstone hotel, let us say, in the city of
      Golden Glow, which is distinguished for being the dirtiest
      and noisiest industrial huddle in the state of Winnemac.
      Now the state organization of shoe-dealers, autograph
      collectors, petunia-growers, Schnauzer-fanciers, pacifists,
      big navyists, wholesale and retail tripe-dressers, or
      alumni of Pettifoot Military and Agricultural Institute are
      going to hold a convention. The Golden Glow Chamber of
      Commerce, together with the hotel-keepers, theatre-owners,
      taxi-cab-owners and the like of the city, send letters,
      telegrams, and emissaries to the committee to proclaim the
      beauties of Golden Glow--the park system, the almost
      radioactive drinking-water, the extraordinary situation
      whereby Golden Glow can with equal ease be reached from Key
      West, Medicine Hat, or Constantinople, the number and
      vehement luxury and unparalleled cheapness of the hotels,
      the rural grandeur that the Golden River will have as soon
      as a couple of hundred factories and the stockyards are
      removed from its banks, the grim splendour of Mount Glow,
      which is only fourteen thousand feet lower than Mount
      Whitney, and the acoustics of Memorial Hall, in which
      twenty thousand people can hear the lowest whisper,
      provided listening to low whispers is their notion of fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convention once secured, the hitherto chummy
      hotel-keepers separate and begin trying to get reservations
      away from one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the convention. The arrival of kings, field-marshals,
      and archbishops, each expecting suitable reverence: the
      president of the state organization, the secretary, the
      chairman of the committee on meetings, the chairman of the
      accommodations committee, the chairman of the banquet
      committee. Delegates flooding in, demanding the rooms they
      have forgotten to reserve. Lobbies jammed with men slowly
      circling and exchanging remarks, flasks, and chewing gum,
      and agreeing that a three-hundred-room hotel which cannot
      take care of two hundred extra guests at the last moment is
      not enterprising, and they certainly will never come
      <i>here</i> again! Secretaries of committees, sitting at
      small desks in large rooms off the lobby, with so many
      delegates surging about them that they become deaf and
      blind, and are sometimes found weeks afterward, hiding
      under the pile of unanswered messages.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      And his incessant problem of employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had been an underling himself; he had vowed then that
      if he ever became an executive, he would never be
      irritated, that he would tenderly instruct all the
      employees, and be delighted to advance money to them in the
      middle of the week. He still felt that he ought to feel so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still had an uneasy sense, probably derived from Ora,
      that he ought to be a socialist, a comrade to all the
      workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been so many instances when the 'help' had failed
      him: the cook who showed up drunk for the preparation of
      Thanksgiving dinner; the bell-boy, supposed to be hustling
      an urgent message up to a guest, who was found smoking a
      cigarette and playing craps in the linen-room; the steward
      who was taking a percentage from the provision merchants;
      the clerk who gave his friend an eight-dollar room for
      four; the chambermaid who, ordered to wash the fly-specks
      from one electric globe did not wash the other dirty globes
      in the room; the elevator-runner who sneered at funny old
      women with purple hats . . . A hundred of them, daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Myron was a reasonably just and kindly man, and he
      fretted over his workers. He had no pleasure in kicking out
      even the surliest of them. If day on day they worried lest
      they lose their jobs, so day on day he worried, 'Oh Lord,
      have I got to fire him?' as he watched a man growing slack,
      doing less work, and no employee had more sternly to nerve
      himself, to still his quaking stomach, before edging into
      the Boss's office to ask for a rise, than did Myron before
      sending for an employee to scold him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard on an employee, he admitted, to be dependent
      for the job that meant life for himself and his family upon
      the whims of a boss who could discharge him because he did
      not like the colour of his hair; to give all his laborious
      days for the profit of some absentee owner whom he had
      never even seen. 'Just the same, as long as it's my job to
      control them, I'm going to drive 'em as hard as--as hard as
      I've always driven myself,' he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Bolshevik Socialist revolution, and the
      installation of the Fascists in Italy, he was interested to
      learn that under these new systems, slackers and dullards
      and falsifiers of reports were worse driven--even to prison
      or the rebuke of an automatic--than under the Capitalistic
      Democracy which, with no particular will or thought in the
      matter, he himself represented.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The coming of Prohibition, which was annoying to most
      citizens, was a catastrophe to the hotels. They had
      depended upon the bar to pay, at least, rent and taxes, and
      it had enabled them to lose on the dining-room, to lavish
      game, terrapin, caviare on the guests and positively urge
      them to take from the heaped dish left on the table more
      butter than they needed, and if the meals brought a
      deficit, what of it? It was good advertising. With
      Prohibition, they were compelled to turn niggardly or close
      their doors in bankruptcy. Myron had for a while to return
      to his food-cost-finding and determine exactly what
      proportion of an ounce of butter could be given to each
      guest without loss; just how much, to the tenth fraction of
      a cent, they could spend on an egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with the loss from Prohibition, taxes went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotels and theatres are always excellent institutions to
      tax, when in doubt. Rural legislators live decently at
      home, or in boarding-houses at the capital; they go neither
      to hotels nor to theatres and see no reason why other
      people should; and in framing taxation bills always agree
      that these lairs of luxury will stand another raid. Income
      taxes have always been an especial delirium to hotels. A
      factory can strike a reasonable average for depreciation of
      machines and plant; but so varied is the custom of a hotel
      that a minor prophet is required to estimate the annual
      damage. Such an agreeable fad as stealing souvenir spoons,
      springing up mysteriously and ragingly, will suddenly cost
      an hotel thousands a year, to be more or less allowed for
      on the income tax, provided the inspectors of tax-reports
      condescend to permit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was particularly pleasant for hotels to pay extra taxes
      to support extra prohibition agents for the purpose of
      keeping them from earning the extra taxes, and just as
      pleasant to realize that, privately, the guests were
      drinking as much as ever, with the difference that the
      hotels received none of the profit, while the merry men,
      communally guzzling in their bedrooms instead of the bar,
      were ruining varnished tables and bureaus with spilled
      alcohol and cigarettes left burning, were setting beds and
      chairs and curtains afire, were throwing empty bottles out
      of windows upon the heads of litigious passers-by, were
      keeping other guests awake, for which only the hotel was
      blamed . . . It scarcely seemed worth while to pay much
      extra income tax to get these results.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      If the details of conventions or taxation seem to have
      nothing to do with the soul of Myron Weagle, poet, then is
      the seeming wrong, for it was with such details that he had
      to harass himself, it was for them that he had to give up
      leisure and love and play, all the years after 1917.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora, engaged in ghosting the memoirs of a charming lady
      blackmailer who had driven half a dozen men to suicide,
      complained that for all of marriage and Bermuda, Myron was
      less adventurous and picturesque than ever, unfit for the
      reverence of a novelist like himself, who would have liked
      an explorer or a soldier for brother. Effie May, left alone
      for a good part of the time, and now less entertained by
      the luxury of hotel suites, complained that Myron was
      neglecting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlos Jaynes complained that the crank Myron, with his
      dirty little insistences on economy, kept him from making
      the public rooms of the Westward as smart as those of the
      Ritz or Plaza or St. Regis. Even Mark Elphinstone
      complained that Myron criticized his ideas for new
      restaurants.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while they complained of his coldness to Romance, Myron
      warmed in his heart the desire to create the Perfect Inn.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He was the inventor, or one of the inventors, of the
      'emergency overnight kit' for people held too late at the
      office to get back to the suburbs. It contained cotton
      pyjamas, cheap comb and tooth-brush, a small tube of
      tooth-paste; it was given free to sober-looking guests who
      were benighted, and led several hundred business-men to
      making a habit of staying at the Westward. Also, as they
      were supposed to leave the pyjamas behind, to be laundered
      and used over again, it did not cost so much as it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora laughed enormously when he heard of Myron's invention.
      It was, he pointed out, a perfect example of what a modern
      American business-man considered an advance in
      civilization, and he had the funniest suggestions (Effie
      May giggled at them) for other items to be included in the
      kit: a paper-bound copy of the Gospel According to St.
      John, a celluloid sardine sandwich which could be used over
      and over again, a collection of the poems of Edgar Guest,
      pink wool bed-socks, and an eighteen-foot telescope so that
      the guest could study astronomy from the lofty altitudes of
      the Westward.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron argued with Carlos Jaynes and the other resident
      managers about extra attention to travelling-men and
      sample-rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaynes had figures--like all statistics very impressive but
      rather vague as to origin--to prove that in 1922 there
      were, thanks to catalogues and larger wholesalers, only
      fifty per cent as many drummers on the road as in 1902, and
      he hinted that Myron could not get away from the psychology
      of Black Thread Centre of 1895.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps that was all true, said Myron, but travelling-men
      were the most important of all critics of hotels. It was
      they who remarked, in the smoking compartments of trains,
      'Going to Golden Glow for the first time? Try the Smith
      Hotel. They treat you right. All new mattresses, and the
      clerks make sure you get your mail, and the coffee--ummmm!'
      Or: 'Don't let anybody tell you the Grand Hotel Royal
      Magnificent is any good. You take my tip and give it a
      miss. They got enough gilt in the lobby to sink a ship, but
      if you take a room for anything under six bucks a day, they
      treat you like a poor relation, and they stick you fifty
      cents for orange juice. Out!'
    </p>
    <p>
      So Myron outraged Carlos Jaynes, bewildered Effie May, and
      shocked Ora by insisting that every employee give more
      attention to the veteran travelling-men than to Neapolitan
      dukes who came in brushing off reporters, and in particular
      he did so after a day in 1923--though then he was no longer
      at the Westward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was behind the desk, checking over the credit-card rack,
      the telautographs, the transfer-racks, the mail-stamping
      machine, the three fire-alarm systems, the time-clock, and
      the other complicated contrivances of that nerve-centre of
      the hotel. Up to the desk to register came a man foggily
      familiar to Myron; a tall, stooped man, neat of linen but
      with a suit at once flashy and badly worn, his grey hair
      bushy at the edge of his cocky grey hat. He was, Myron
      guessed, a Failure, but a Failure who would never give up
      his flamboyant hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of sixty or sixty-two?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now who the devil was he? Myron seemed to associate
      agreeable, even exciting memories with him. Elbowing the
      room-clerk aside, he read the signature upside down. That
      signature was 'J. Hector Warlock, Chi. Benjamin Belt
      Buckles the Best'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was within an inch of saying 'Number Four, as usual,
      Mr. Warlock? Mr. Dummy Dumbolton is in the house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dummy Dumbolton, meek and bewildered and admiring to
      the end, was dead now. And the J. Hector Warlock who, at
      thirty-four, could stay up all night drinking and gambling,
      and still laugh in the morning, was just as dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. Hector looked straight at him, unrecognizing, his kind
      eyes a little bleary. He was rumbling, and his rotund voice
      had not shrivelled with the rest of him, 'Brother, do you
      happen to have a nice room for about three-fifty?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We certainly have, Mr. Uh . . .' Myron pretended to look
      at the registry card. J. Hector's script was as bold as
      ever, but shaky on the down strokes. '. . . Mr. Warlock.
      Three-fifty exactly, and I think you'll like it.
      Uh--Benjamin Belt Buckles, eh? How are they going?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, pretty good'. Then J. Hector laughed, threw back his
      head with his old gesture of a matinée idol. 'That means
      pretty damn bad!' He looked away from Myron, awaiting a
      bell-boy, and Myron could not think of another question. He
      longed to bring back 1895, and credulity, and delight at
      the strangeness and variousness of life, and the round
      cheeks and mighty laugh and black locks of J. Hector. He
      nodded to the boy. 'Take Mr. Warlock up to 539.' He watched
      J. Hector bob wearily across to the elevator, his shoulders
      sinking as soon as he believed that he was no longer under
      observation. He vanished behind the elevator grill, bearing
      with him Myron's youthful certainty that somewhere in the
      beautiful world was to be found a blessed state called
      'success'.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the room-clerk Myron murmured, 'Just charge Mr. Warlock
      three-fifty for 539, and put the rest on my bill, and make
      a memo of this: Whenever he comes, he's to have any six- or
      seven-dollar room, the best that's vacant, for three-fifty.
      Charge the excess to me, and don't let him know,
      <i>understand?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He was called to the telephone at once with, 'The gentleman
      in 539 wants to speak to you, Chief.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is this the clerk that assigned me to 539?' J. Hector's
      voice was quavering, a little frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, look, old man, sorry to bother you, but are you sure
      this is a three-fifty room?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, absolutely; that's right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's such a swell room I was afraid . . . Hate to be a
      tight-wad, but you know how it is; firm won't just stand
      for more than that on the expense account.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure, I know how it is, Mr. Warlock. We like to cater to
      travelling-men here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'm glad to hear that. I've been a drummer for
      more'n forty years and nowadays, it seems like most of
      these young glad-handers would rather have a bootlegger or
      a beautiful young movie actor guy than to have an old-time
      salesman that has to watch the nickels. Used to be a time I
      could blow myself to a six-dollar room, but somehow,
      nowadays. . . . Oh, excuse me; you don't want to hear my
      troubles! Much obliged, Cap'n; sorry to bothered you; sure
      am much obliged.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron felt old, that night, and Effie May, prattling about
      the play to which they were going, seemed embarrassingly
      young. He wanted to get hold of J. Hector for a poker game.
      But--oh, Effie May would be so disappointed at missing the
      theatre, after being alone all day.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He liked novelties in food well enough, but when the
      manager of the Westward lunch-room innocently proposed a
      sandwich made of pineapple between halves of a doughnut, he
      forbade the crime without right of appeal. . . . And the
      question of the commercial value of a free basket of fruit
      in bedrooms; or could they sell such baskets, for fifty
      cents; or was the whole thing just an unprofitable extra
      bother? . . . And the comedy of the expansive gentleman
      who, after having a suite and vast meals for a week, so
      that the cash-drawer rattled with anticipation, paid for it
      with due-bills given for advertising. . . . And the growing
      importance of cafeterias and coffee-shops, as against the
      fact that the hasty gobbling of fodder in such places
      killed the tradition of leisurely dining. . . . And the
      question of how to provide amusement for lonely guests in
      the evening; how many liked a gramophone--later, a radio. .
      . . Lobby-sitters--well-dressed outsiders who all day long
      occupied chairs needed for guests. . . . The press-agent of
      the Westward, who pestered the officers by turning the
      whole hotel over to wedding-parties, so that Myron, however
      much that sentimentalist loved young love, was sick of
      dying flowers, dribbling champagne glasses, and weeping
      relations, who savagely stopped weeping when they had to
      pay the bills. . . . The newspapermen who blamed a
      thousand-room hotel because it served more stereotyped food
      and had more standardized bedroom-furnishings and less
      quaint, jolly, rubicund, Dickens-cum-Chesterton
      'characters' than an 'old-world' inn of fifteen rooms and
      twenty seatings at table, as conducted by a famous retired
      chef who managed every detail. . . . The unhappy fact that,
      devoted to efficiency just as an impersonal ideal, Myron
      was as irritated by sloppiness and ignorance in rival
      hotels as in his own. To see on a table an ash-tray filled
      with cigarette-butts, unnoticed by the waiter, was to him
      what it was to a Black Thread deacon to catch the preacher
      kissing a choir-singer. There was no blacker shame--except,
      perhaps, a guest's marking on a linen tablecloth with a
      pencil. If he had no formal religion, nor gave any
      particular thought to his chances of Heaven, he did believe
      in Hell almost literally when he saw such a guest; and an
      otherwise perfect journey could, for a quarter hour, be
      ruined by a crooked tablecloth. He could see more things
      wrong with an apparently well-conducted restaurant in two
      minutes than the crankiest guest in as many hours.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He did not approve of himself for being so irritated by
      incompetence that it clouded the glory of life. He knew
      that he was 'fussy'.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could scarcely avoid knowing it, with Ora and Effie May
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these details were so unimportant, they told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet to Effie May the health of her brother and sister and
      father, an extraordinarily indifferent matter to the world
      at large, appeared to be important, and equally so, the
      scent of her perfume, a pebble in her dancing-slipper, or
      runs in her stockings. And to Ora the horror of using the
      word 'delectable', the good harsh sound of words like
      'grackle' and 'grunt' and 'starve', the crime of depending
      in stories upon roses, sunsets, and mother-love, and the
      not uninteresting question as to which magazines paid
      better, seemed weighty matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sappy little truisms on red and green placards--the demands
      of Celebrities--emergency overnight kits--doughnut and
      pineapple sandwiches--unemptied ash-trays--Myron admitted
      that none of these atrocities singly much affected history,
      yet all together, he still insisted, they made the
      difference between doing his job excellently and doing it
      badly, and that to him was urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate thing is that though men have general
      resemblances in love, hunger, patriotism, and noses, they
      differ utterly in the technicalities of their work, and
      each grieves that all the others are idiots not to
      understand his particular language. Hotel-man or sculptor
      or sailor or manufacturer of tacks, each has a separate and
      self-conscious world, with a certainty of its significance
      to the universe, of the towering dignity of its every
      detail, and of the fascinating differences between
      colleagues who, to outsiders, seem indistinguishable
      'types'.
    </p>
    <p>
      To most guests at the Westward, every waiter looked like
      every other waiter, and a bell-boy was merely a bell-boy,
      but to one another, and to Myron Weagle, they were as
      different as Albert Einstein and John L. Sullivan, and all
      of them more reasonable and comprehensible than either Mr.
      Einstein or Mr. Sullivan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each world has not only its technicalities but its own
      heroes. To Myron, real history had nothing to do with
      Charlemagne, Moses, Garibaldi, Goethe, Thomas Edison, or
      Abraham Lincoln--except as Edison invented the lights that
      were so useful to hotels, and Lincoln took out an
      innkeeper's licence in Sangamon County in 1833. For him,
      the rulers of history were the greater American
      hotel-keepers: David Reynolds, the Boydens, Barnum (not P.
      T., but David, of the Indian Queen Tavern in Baltimore),
      Nathaniel Rogers, Cornelius Vanderbilt--until he gave up
      conducting the Bellona Hotel in New Brunswick for the
      outlandish occupation of captaining a steamship--Daniel
      Drew, who also abandoned innkeeping at the Bull's Head
      Tavern, on the Boston Post Road, for the vanities of
      railroad-financing, Rathbun, the Leylands, Paran Stevens,
      Potter Palmer, Oscar, Boldt, the two generations of Drakes,
      Statler, Muschenheim, Fred Harvey, Bowman, Boomer, Simeon
      Ford, Ralph Hitz, Willard, Flagler, Eppley, Ernie Byfield.
      To him, these names were as familiar and significant as the
      names of Dickens and Walter Scott to Ora. And to none of
      these masters, insisted Myron, when he defended himself
      against the scoffing of Ora or the incomprehension of Effie
      May, would an unemptied ash-tray be unimportant!
    </p>
    <p>
      There had appeared in the <i>New York Messenger</i> and
      been copied all through the country a bit of free-verse
      doggerel in which, to Myron's fury, a wandering motorist
      made complaint against the hotel world:

      Bell-boys!<br>
      They whistle as they carry your bag and look at how shabby
      it is and snicker and point it out to their fellow imps<br>
      AND<br>
      Hit your shins with it in the elevator<br>
      AND<br>
      When they have opened your window, on winter days, and
      slammed it shut in August, and put their dirty paws on your
      towels, they just stand there and<br>
      IF<br>
      You give them less than a quarter they sniff and bang the
      door.<br>
      <br>
      Waiters<br>
      They either give you warm drinking-water or a CHUNK<br>
      Of ice so big in the glass your lips can never,<br>
      Can never, never, never get around it.<br>
      They bring you also warm butter BUT<br>
      You can count on them for cold coffee.<br>
      If they bring you eggs they forget the salt,<br>
      If they bring you flapjacks they forget the syrup,<br>
      If they bring you ginger-ale they forget to open it,<br>
      If they bring you meat they forget the knife<br>
           And the fork<br>
                And the gravy<br>
                     And the salt<br>
                          And the pepper<br>
                               And sometimes the meat!<br>
      <br>
      Hotel beds!<br>
      They either slope down to the sides,<br>
      So that you roll out all night long,<br>
      Or down to the middle so that all night,<br>
      You dream<br>
      You are an ant,<br>
      A little ant,<br>
      An unhappy little, little whimpering ant,<br>
      Who's trying,<br>
      All night long, to climb<br>
      Out of a pit of sand, and<br>
      The mattresses are stuffed with bricks,<br>
      Cement,<br>
      Old iron,<br>
      And rocks,<br>
      And smell, they smell of rags, old ancient rags<br>
      Lying a long time in a dark, damp place.<br>
      <br>
      And all the hotel chow tastes all alike,<br>
      Clam chowder tastes like beef, and beef like pie,<br>
      The while the pie tastes--if you will excuse--<br>
      It tastes--it tastes like H-E-Double L.<br>
      <br>
      And then next morning:<br>
      The elevator-runner says, 'I hope<br>
      You slept well,' and the bell-boys, with their hands<br>
      Outstretched in loving greeting, say, 'We hope,<br>
      Each miserable urchin of us hopes,<br>
      You slept like billy-oh.'<br>
      <br>
      The beaming clerk he hopes you slept; he hopes,<br>
      'You have enjoyed your stay with us, old top,'<br>
      The while he murders slumber with the bill,<br>
      The monstrous inconceivably big bill.<br>
      <br>
      Hotels!<br>
      Henceforward I shall sleep in ditches soft,<br>
      In barns, in owl-nests, or in piggies' pens,<br>
      Dine on the dew and sup the evening star,<br>
      Anything to avoid these blank hotels!

      When he had recovered from what he conceived to be
      justified fury, Myron composed his first and last poem. He
      sent it to the <i>Hotel Era,</i> and during the next five
      years it was reprinted in seventeen hotel journals from New
      York to Cape Town:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Guests!<br>
      As an hotel-keeper I like guests pretty well--<br>
      I've got to.<br>
      I like them the way a prize-fighter likes getting socked in
      the jaw--<br>
      He gets paid for it.<br>
      <br>
      Guests!<br>
      They steal the towels, the ash-trays, the blankets, the
      electric light bulbs, the small rugs, the stationery, the
      pens, the pin-cushions, the table-ware, the Hotel Red
      Book.<br>
      They never leave their keys, and rarely send them back.<br>
      They tell the hotel dick the girl is their cousin.<br>
      They want you to cash big cheques without
      identification,<br>
      AND<br>
      They say they'll never come back if you don't.<br>
      Thank the Lord for that, anyway!<br>
      <br>
      Guests!<br>
      They burn cigarette holes in the bedspread, the carpets,
      the chair-arms.<br>
      They leave the water, the costly hot water, running in the
      bowl<br>
      For hours.<br>
      They sit on edges of beds and ruin the mattresses.<br>
      They cut the towels with safety-razor blades.<br>
      They use the towels to clean mud off their shoes.<br>
      They use same to wipe off mascaro when they are females of
      the species.<br>
      <br>
      Guests!<br>
      The timid ones are scared of fire, burglars,
      earthquakes.<br>
      The gally ones try to borrow the manager's Tuxedo for
      banquets.<br>
      All of them complain that the clerks, the bell-hops, the
      porters, the chambermaids, the telephone-girls, and
      practically everybody except the Governor of the State,<br>
      Was rude.<br>
      Maybe so.<br>
      And maybe the guest was rude first.<br>
      <br>
      Guests!<br>
      They want strawberries out of season<br>
      (And free, on the club breakfast) but<br>
      They sniff at strawberries in season,<br>
      Great, big, beautiful strawberries in season, and then<br>
      They want,<br>
      They whine that they 'just can't understand why they can't
      get',<br>
      Imported Norwegian herrings<br>
      And Mount Hybla honey<br>
      And plovers' eggs<br>
      And squab on toast<br>
      And all<br>
      On the eighty-cent club breakfast.<br>
      They want a special steak broiled in five minutes.<br>
      And then they kick<br>
      Because the steak is rare.<br>
      And then they kick<br>
      Because the coffee they left standing there<br>
      Ten minutes has got cold.<br>
      <br>
      Guests!<br>
      The guest is always right.<br>
      I like guests.<br>
      <i>I've got to.</i><br>
      I'm going on liking them until<br>
      That lovely day when I quit and take a claim<br>
      In North Saskatchewan, six hundred miles<br>
      From stations, taxis, telephones and GUESTS.

      'Well, maybe some of the lines aren't quite smooth. My
      first poem. Maybe Ora wouldn't think it was equal to
      Longfellow or Ezra Pound or any of those old, classic
      bards. But the ideas are perfectly fine,' said Myron.

      To Effie May, after a life of dusting and bed-making, with
      sodas at the drug-store and dances at Fireman's Wigwam as
      her maddest dissipations, their suite at the Westward was
      Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      For himself Myron would have preferred to keep his suite as
      it was, with grey walls, few pictures, sparse furniture of
      waxed oak, and plenty of space; but he knew that Effie was
      all for brightness, and from Bermuda he had written to
      Luciano Mora asking him to have the suite properly
      littered. Effie May, when she first saw it, after blushing
      prettily at the manly greetings of Elphinstone, Mora, and
      Carlos Jaynes, down in the lobby, squealed, 'Oh, it's just
      too simply adorably ducky!' Myron beamed--and groaned.
      Luciano had jammed into bedroom and sitting-room, each
      twenty by twenty, nearly all the unnecessary furnishings
      they could hold. There were small applewood tables, large
      mahogany tables, and nests of Chinese Chippendale tables.
      There were side-lights in imitation of candles, and floor
      lamps of writhing gilded iron. There were a couch, and a
      chaise-longue piled with saffron cushions of leather, pink
      and gold cushions of satin, tan cushions of broadcloth
      embroidered with emerald blossoms, and a long, skinny,
      floppy, milk-faced, degenerate Columbine doll, which Effie
      May picked up with a scream of delight, and which Myron
      hated on sight. There were grey and blue lithographs of
      Paris, chromos of cats that were up to no good, and very
      funny and rather dirty French caricatures of
      <i>cocottes</i> and <i>chalets de necéssité,</i> over which
      Effie blushed again. There was a small piano, which she
      touched affectionately, proving that music was not one of
      her sounder accomplishments, and there were even
      books--Myron's books, consisting of a set of Dickens, two
      novels by Rex Beach and one by Conan Doyle, and sixty-seven
      volumes dealing with hotel-keeping and accounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the bath-room was in glossy black tiles, with lavender
      tub and bowl, and two dozen assorted towels.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My, they must expect us to get dirty!' giggled Effie May.
      'But, oh, Myron, it's all just too won'erful for words!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      After rising at seven, in Black Thread, and preparing
      breakfast before she could sit down to it, in a room that
      still reeked of last night's creamed chipped beef, Effie
      May stretched her paws like an Angora at being able to have
      breakfast brought to her bedroom--and such a variety: a
      choice of three kinds of melons and thirteen kinds of
      cereal and four kinds of fish (fish for breakfast!) and
      French toast with honey or syrup, and English strawberry
      jam in 'ducky' little pots, and shirred eggs with little
      sausages, and kidneys with mushrooms! 'I'm so excited
      Myron, but I'm such a pig! I want to order everything! I'll
      get fat as butter! You better watch me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will, old lady! Trust me! Watching is my speciality.
      Kiss me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved the importance of having the floor-waiter--not a
      hired girl but a real man waiter, and in a dress suit at
      nine-thirty in the morning!--bring in a table all for
      herself, and humbly murmur, 'Madame is served'. She loved
      the silver, the amethyst-coloured water-glass, the coffee
      in a thermos jug, the English muffins tucked under a clean
      napkin, and the single rose in a slim vase. She loved
      loafing for an hour and nibbling and gravely daubing
      herself with jam like a baby while Myron was already
      downstairs at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could have a hair-wash, a wave, a manicure, or massage,
      at any time Her Ladyship chose, in her room or down in the
      'beautician's', and the attendants were delighted to
      chatter about hotel feuds and scandal with the wife of the
      probable future president of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May was indeed an Angora; she loved strong, soft
      fingers at the roots of her electric hair, upon her flushed
      cheeks, across the nerves of her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chambermaids were equally obsequious. They crooned,
      'Oh, no, ma'am, no hurry at <i>all!'</i> when she had kept
      them out of the suite till eleven. She was delighted with
      the luxury of fresh bed-linen daily, and she suspected now
      that, though the Lambkin household had regarded itself as
      Puritanically neat, she had never learned anything about
      dusting and sweeping. . . . To have them brush beneath the
      bed and the couch, and every day--that, she bubbled to
      herself, was 'class'. And the whole housekeeping department
      was complaisant about carrying out her notions of further
      decorating. In the sour and faded rooms of the Lambkin
      house she had longed for broad ribbons and laces and
      velvet. She rejoiced in having as much of them now as she
      wanted. To the welter on the chaise-longue she added fluffy
      sofa-pillows of apricot silk trimmed with lace; she put
      flounces on the apparently unflounceable maple twin beds;
      and the telephone in each of the rooms she hid under a doll
      with wide skirts of gold lace and tiny glass jewels, which
      caused Myron to curse wildly, though secretly, every time
      he had to telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung photographs, of her father quail-hunting, of Julia
      in tulle, of Herbert undergoing the mystic process of being
      turned from flesh into a Master of Arts, and of the whole
      family on the ancestral lawn in 1902, a brown and faded
      print with Effie May herself a chunk of a child in a short,
      hiked-up skirt, a sailor hat, and a simper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron never complained about her bills. She believed him to
      be a rich man and wondered--though she was good-natured
      enough not to nag him--why, with all his wealth, he went on
      working so anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was so excitingly much to do, at first; rituals of
      the toilet, new to her who, for all the stuffy dignity of
      the Lambkin residence and the stores of cosmetics in her
      father's handsome establishment, had known nothing beyond a
      quick bath in a tin-lined tub, and hasty rubbing with a
      skinny towel. Now she revelled in a long, languid soaking
      in warm water scented each day with a new kind of bath
      salts, in fringed towels vast as a sheet, in eau-de-Cologne
      and powder and lip-stick, in nail-cream and orange-stick,
      and the gentle hands of a maid to do her hair--she who all
      her life had done it herself, or been subjected to the
      jerky impatience of Julia's harsh fingers. She bought
      'lotions' with French names, and was surprised to discover
      from a saleswoman, after she had been using them as toilet
      waters, that they were intended for the hair. She initiated
      herself into the mysteries of creams which were to rub on
      and rub off, and creams which were to be rubbed in and to
      stay in. She even tried having purple and green eyelids,
      but at this Myron protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much to do! After toilet and breakfast, and rearranging
      the flowers and cushions, and deciding whether the
      sandalwood cigarette box or the Chinese enamel box would
      look better on the teakwood stool, there was always
      window-shopping, with surprises unheard of in Black Thread:
      English shooting-sticks which turned into one-legged
      stools, aquamarine necklaces, Parisian hats, cut-glass
      dishes for hors d'&oelig;uvres, onyx-topped evening sticks,
      Benedictine in unnatural-looking squat bottles, silver
      evening-slippers. She had engagements at the dressmaker's,
      at the shoemaker's, and in between there were always these
      won'erful motion pictures, which had not yet reached Black
      Thread. When she saw 'Queen Elizabeth', with Sarah
      Bernhardt, and Zukor's imperial settings, Effie May gasped
      with ecstasy over her brilliant new life.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was nothing else, she could always stretch herself
      on the chaise-longue, looking down at her new slippers and
      silk stockings while she curled her toes and waved her
      small feet, rejoicing at being secure from Julia's demands
      from the kitchen, and slowly, luxuriously gulping down
      candy--real dollar-a-pound store-candy! Back home, they had
      had home-made fudge, or thirty-cent candy from the
      drug-store, the best their father sold. Dollar-a-pound
      candy, in gold and scarlet boxes with silver ribbons, was
      something a beau brought you in awe from Bridgeport, once
      in a year. Here, in the Westward, she could have all she
      wanted, and she wanted a good deal, so that she began to
      worry about becoming too plump, as she nibbled sweets,
      cakes, fruit preserved in syrup, all afternoon long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was always attentive--at first. However busy, he
      telephoned up to her every hour; he sent flowers daily; he
      took her to lunch and dinner either in the brocade-panelled
      Georgian Room of the Westward, or in outside restaurants,
      where she was gratified to have head waiters bow and croak,
      'Good <i>evening,</i> Mr. Weagle--good evening,
      <i>ma'am,'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      They went often to the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We've got to see a lot of shows. We both of us need to
      broaden our minds, and lead a more you-might-say social
      life,' said Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The social life consisted largely of Luciano Mora, Alec
      Monlux, and Ora; and to Effie May that seemed a very fine
      social life indeed, after the Lambkin parlour and Herbert
      whining about the school-board and Julia quarrelling with
      Willis. It was both mind-broadening and lovely fun to
      listen to Myron and Alec and Luciano discussing Colonial
      Reproductions and the presidential chances of Governor
      Woodrow Wilson and the objections to the gear-drive in
      mechanical potato-peelers, while beautifully they drank
      whisky not straight but with soda-water out of little
      bottles! Then Luciano returned to Naples, to manage one of
      his father's smaller hotels, and Myron and Effie missed
      him, daily. Without his laughter, their cocktail-hours
      seemed a little dull. Myron was ever busier and, however
      fond when he did telephone, less likely to telephone at
      all. Suddenly, when neither Genuine Lotus Bath Salts from
      an Old Eyptian Recipe, nor looking at tortoise-shell
      mirrors in shop windows, nor rustling through the box for
      chocolates with nigger-toe centres, was so novel, Effie May
      discovered that she had nothing to do, and that she was
      bored.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It had never occurred to Myron or to Effie that in an hotel
      suite, without even dish-wiping or feeding the chickens,
      and with no particular longing to study Imagism or
      Assyriology or the History of Endocrinology, she would not
      have enough to do. Being bored, she began to feel
      neglected--as she probably was, though the driven Myron
      could not think what to do about it. She felt the more
      neglected when Ora helpfully told her that she was. She
      took up French classes, dancing classes, daily exercise at
      a gymnasium where ex-pugilists anxiously tempered the
      labour to the fat lambs, and she had dress-fittings till
      Myron did begin to be alarmed about the bills. But she
      discovered in herself no talent for any of these arts save
      dressing. The jolly Effie May of Black Thread, with her
      three good frocks made by the village seamstress, became
      smart now, in tweed suits and Paris models, and just when
      she was falling into real discontent and whimpering at
      Myron that she could not endure the emptiness of her days,
      she met Mrs. Bertha Spinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Spinney had red hair and alimony; she devoted half her
      life to preserving these treasures, and the rest to elderly
      young bachelors with exploratory fingers and imported
      Chartreuse. She was forty-five in the afternoon sunlight,
      twenty-five in the dark, her cheeks were powdered as with
      cake-flour, she laughed frequently, she told very good
      stories, and she clanked with heavy oxidized silver chains.
      Her suite was just down the hall from the Weagles' and
      Effie May had met her often in the elevator. She apparently
      knew all about Effie, and one day introduced herself and
      invited Effie in for a cocktail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately they were chums.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron did not like Bertha Spinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blind, doting, efficient kindly Myron had never
      considered that in all of New York Effie had no woman
      friend, and indeed no friend of any kind save himself and
      Alec and perhaps Ora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May was happily occupied now. With Bertha Spinney she
      went window-shopping, and it was far more interesting, with
      Bertha to explain about diamonds that were blue and
      sapphires that were white, and how 'Couronne d'Amour'
      perfume, in a small black bottle shaped like a fig, cost
      ten dollars because it was so enticing that men were
      maddened by it. Effie secretly longed for a bottle, and
      saved up the ten dollars for it, but whenever she went back
      to the shop and looked into the window, she shamefacedly
      did not quite dare to go in and ask for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Bertha she went to lunch, went to matinées, drove in
      the Park, ferreted out 'little dressmakers who make you
      real Paris models for just <i>nothing,</i> my dear!' and,
      at last, went to cocktail parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The era of penthouses and multiple cocktails and public
      kissing and universally saying 'Hello, darling', of gigolos
      posing as bond-salesmen and bond-salesmen posing as
      gigolos, and the other happy concomitants of Prohibition
      and the Great Peace had not yet come, but the Men About
      Town in 1911 did not do so badly on single cocktails. If
      they did not call the girls by their first names or
      manhandle them quite so quickly, when they got to it they
      meant it, and Effie May found herself the habituée of
      masculine flats that were floors of large old houses near
      Washington Square or Gramercy Park; found
      herself--giggling--the adored friend, suddenly, of a dozen
      Wall-Street men, or at least a-block-from-Wall-Street men,
      and occasionally even of genuine imported noblemen who,
      after five o'clock, when they had removed their alpaca
      office-coats, became great gentlemen, yet so simple of
      heart that they were willing to go to tea with any lovely
      Norse Goddess, provided she paid the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May discovered that she was charged and tingling with
      sex. She trembled, and felt as though fireworks had gone
      off inside her, when one of those public conveniences, the
      bachelors about town, stropped her damp arm or drew
      lingering finger-tips beneath her chin. She did respect
      Myron enough to remain what is technically known as a 'good
      woman', but she scampered back to him with such panting
      desire that he was overwhelmed with her ardour, her hot
      hands, her uncreased ivory skin, and while he seemed most
      strait-jacketed with filing-cards and kitchen-reports, he
      was most longing for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably he was too rigid of spirit ever to have aroused
      her vastly by himself; probably he owed a good deal to
      Bertha Spinney and the electrifying minor nobilities, but
      he never appreciated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie met a whole society of detached women dwelling in
      hotels, idle women, mostly living on alimony and displaying
      energy only when they dragged their former husbands into
      court. Many of them talked incessantly about their devoted
      care to their children, whom they got rid of by sending
      them away to school in winter and to camps in summer. Many
      of them were handsome, many of them were supporting lovers
      on the alimony from their curiously unwilling ex-husbands,
      and most of them were devoted to cocktails. In the Westward
      and other hotels within a dozen blocks, there were hundreds
      of these leeches, and Effie May was inducted into their
      splendidly blood-gorged society by Bertha Spinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Mrs. Koreball, officially known as No. 772, The
      Westward, gave a 'party' for Effie May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May found it charming.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Koreball, Effie perceived, was so sweet! Such a
      <i>little</i> lady, with black hair so sleek and shiny,
      exactly parted in the middle, and with demure lips and the
      small chin of a child, but such gay and knowing eyes! Her
      suite was ever so much bigger than Effie's, and had the
      most won'erful real genuine Spanish antiques: a great, big,
      thick oak table--a refectory table, it was called--with the
      <i>oldest</i> wooden chairs, hundreds of years old, from a
      Spanish monastery! And on the walls Mrs. Koreball didn't
      have ordinary pictures, but so different--images of the
      saints, very antique, and what she said were copes, all
      deep red with gold borders, hung right on the wall. And
      there was a candlestick of gilded oak with a candle four
      feet tall!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Koreball did not serve cocktails, but a simply
      won'erful punch made, she said, of champagne and brandy and
      Mosel (that was a German wine) and vodka (that was a kind
      of Russian white-mule) and a lot of other things, but all
      with fruit juice, so it didn't seem strong, but Mrs.
      Koreball warned her--she must be careful, Mrs. Koreball
      told her, not to drink too much, because it was
      <i>awfully</i> strong and she couldn't have her new friend
      Effie get cockeyed at this first party, she said, and she
      laughed like anything, and kissed Effie, and her eyes were
      naughty but so nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you think I had the nerve to do, Mrs. Weagle? I
      called up your handsome husband, and he says maybe he'll
      drop in, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I hope he does!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You still like him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I think he's marvellous--so strong and you can depend
      on him and everything. But it is so hard to get him to go
      to a party before seven. They keep him so busy in the Front
      Office.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's the handsomest thing!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, do you <i>think</i> so, Mrs. Koreball? I suppose he
      is, but what I always think of first is how he's so strong,
      and so sort of dependable. Of course he does look kind of
      clean and all, like he did wash behind the ears, but
      handsome . . . now a <i>handsome</i> man is like that Duke
      of Essex or Earl of something or whatever he was in "Queen
      Elizabeth". That was a picture that . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I know. I saw it.' Mrs. Koreball seemed a little
      abrupt. 'Well, come, you must meet the Bunch.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Round the punch-bowl was simply the nicest group of people
      Effie May had ever met--oh, of course, except Myron and
      Luciano and Alec. The men has such lovely diagonally barred
      ties, and two of them wore spats, though quite a few of
      them, unfortunately, were bald. The funniest one was a
      short little man with a red face that he screwed up like a
      monkey, but you just had to like him, he was so funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My Lord, it's Helen of Troy herself!' he screamed, when
      Effie was introduced, and everybody laughed, so pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately Effie knew that Helen of Tory was a very
      beautiful woman, who was named Helen and who lived in Troy,
      which was in ancient Greece, so she did not feel
      embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come on, Helen, time for another glass,' said the
      monkey-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I've just had one, and I'm afraid it's <i>awfully</i>
      strong--I wouldn't want to get cockeyed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense! It's just orange juice with just a wee, tiny
      touch of dynamite and maybe a trace of carbolic acid! Come
      hither, lovely one, and let us converse!' He took her arm,
      guided her to a couch covered with purple brocade, and
      chattered, 'My name is Harry Burphy, and what, my rose of
      Sharon, is your monicker? I didn't catch it when our fair
      hostess threw you to us lions.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My name is Effie May Weagle. Isn't it just the
      <i>silliest</i> name!' She giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Effie May, when are you going to have lunch with me?
      I've got the slickest imported Italian auto in town and
      even if it is winter now, I think it would be fun to run up
      the Hudson to Ye Bunche of Grapes some noon. What say? Good
      Lord, what lovely fingers you have! Why, I've never seen
      such lovely fingers as you have!' He seized them; he
      recited, with ample illustration, 'This little pig went to
      market'.
    </p>
    <p>
      It certainly was not Black Thread, but Effice May liked it,
      while assuring herself that she didn't. His wiry little
      hands were strong, and he knew how to do such unusual and
      interesting things with fingers. She meant to refuse his
      luncheon invitation, but he hadn't yet given her a chance,
      and just when she was thinking out a good formula for it,
      he leaped up, dashed at the punch-bowl, and brought back an
      enormous glass--her third. She sipped it slowly,
      determining with each sip to stop sipping, and she felt odd
      and very happy, and presently she seemed to be arguing
      about going to Ye Bunche of Grapes, but a little uncertain
      as to just which side of the argument she was taking. And
      then, curiously, Myron was standing by the couch, looking
      down at them, enormously tall and, while his lips smiled,
      terrifyingly stern about the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had never been in Mrs. Koreball's apartment, but he
      knew the lady and disliked her with simple fervour. She was
      a neat little trick, with baby lips and chin, and with the
      more decorative hotel clerks, she was plush-genteel and
      syrup-sweet. But she was always sending chambermaids out
      weeping, and bell-boys out cursing. Every month she made
      the deuce of a row with the cashier about her bill; she
      always insisted that the waiters were thieves and that she
      simply <i>couldn't</i> have had that much mineral water.
      When they begged her to add up her own initialed cheques,
      she said they were insulting, and stamped her dainty little
      foot, and her girlish eyes showed an active desire to boil
      the cashier in oil. She was one of the few guests who had
      furnished their own suites, and over that, too, there had
      been a gorgeous row. She had, Myron recalled, tried to jew
      them down to half the rent, though it meant only that they
      would have to store the furniture already installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He devoutly did not wish to attend the punch-bowl party,
      but when she insisted that it was in Effie May's honour, he
      had to go--merely cynically wondering in how many other
      people's 'honour' it might be also.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came in, he looked sharply at the gang: just the sort
      of well-pressed, well-spoken bill-dodgers who were an
      hotel's worst pest. The room-decorations, he saw, were
      atrocious: a big slab of a table, dining-chairs with backs
      that were too-straight and provided with knobs for the
      gouging of your shoulder blades, and priestly vestments
      desecrated by being hung as wall ornaments. Spanish, eh?
      Antique, eh? Oh yes? Well, he knew the venerable Iberian
      Händler from whom they came--none other than Señor Don
      Milton Pincus of the Bronx.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Koreball was buzzing, 'So sweet of you to come, Mr.
      Weagle--though I almost feel like calling you "Myron", like
      your girl friend! She's the loveliest thing I ever saw! Now
      you two have found your way, you must drop in for a drink
      often--the latch-string is always out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ('Gawd, it's certainly fine for Effie to get away from
      Black Thread hicks like Mrs. Ted Dingle, and meet
      cultivated women of the world like this female!')
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it always seems so hard to get hold of busy executives
      like you, Myron, and I suppose you handsome men are just
      chased to death by silly women like me! Well, of course,
      ever since my Ex put me in my place and let me see what a
      mean, difficult wench I am, I've learned to sit and fold my
      hands and just wait to be noticed. Now you come and have
      some punch. It's quite good, even if I did make it--it's
      nice orange juice, with maybe a tiny touch of dynamite and
      just a trace of carbolic acid. Oh! Before I forget! I know
      it's shocking to talk business in society, but you're
      <i>so</i> hard to get hold of, and <i>do</i> you suppose
      you could persuade that dumb beast of a housekeeper to give
      me just <i>a few</i> towels, now and then? Won't you speak
      to her? But now come and have a nice glass of punch.'
    </p>
    <p>
      (He did speak to the housekeeper, to have the pleasure of
      justified wrath, and he discovered, as he had guessed, that
      Mrs. Koreball never used the biggest hand towel more than
      once, and that she was, on her best days, able to get
      through sixteen of them.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before he had noticed the Bronx-Spanish furniture, he
      had spied and waved to Effie May, sitting over on a couch
      with a fellow named Harry Burphy, whom Myron knew as a
      clever, competent, sometimes amusing importer, whose only
      fault was over-conscientiousness: he would never be content
      until he had seduced all the wives of all his friends. He
      watched them while he drank half a glass of punch. He was
      disturbed. Effie May was giggling helplessly, as though she
      were a little tipsy, and letting Burphy rub her hand
      against his lips . . . Myron had never thought so much of
      the New York husbands who made the glad cause of Freedom
      synonymous with Gin, and who let their wives crawl around
      the laps of other men. He stalked over, only the more
      annoyed at the innocent-eyed haste with which Burphy
      dropped her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hello, Burphy. Effie! I'm afraid it's about time we were
      beating it. You know we're going out to dinner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh . . . ur . . . we?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They weren't.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      She was certainly not drunk, but she was voluble almost to
      hysteria. When they were back in their own suite, he coaxed
      her to lie down for a nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I couldn't sleep! I feel like going somewhere and
      dancing! Oh, I feel won'erful!' she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she passed out as soon as she touched the pillow, and
      she slept heavily, hour on hour, moaning a little. He sat
      rigid in a straight chair by her bed, staring at her
      miserably. She was so desirable and young! It was vileness
      for her to be touched by slimy people like Burphy and the
      Koreball, and, he decided, it was his fault, not hers. What
      could she know of hotel life and hotel loafers? And he had
      planned nothing for her, he snarled at himself, except the
      beatitude of being with him when he had the time! He longed
      to touch her cheek with a cautious finger; there would be
      delight in just that frail contact. No, she must sleep. And
      afterwards there would be no more Burphys!
    </p>
    <p>
      So he very sensibly went in and shaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she awoke, toward eleven, he had hot coffee and cold
      clam juice waiting for her, and he droned, quite placidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Effie, I've just been thinking that . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, did I get cockeyed at Mrs. Koreball's party?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no, of course not, though I guess that punch had more
      kick than I realized.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's a great sweetie, isn't she--so pretty and such fun!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, a fine woman. Look, Effie, I was just thinking:
      I guess you've enjoyed living in an hotel--I certainly hope
      so, anyway. But I wonder if there's quite enough for you to
      do, to keep you busy. How would it be if we took a flat, or
      maybe a house in the suburbs?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course we'd have a first-rate maid to do all the dirty
      work, but still, what with ordering and maybe making up our
      room and visiting with the neighbours and so on, you'd have
      something to keep you busy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, but I've had so much of housework, all my life! Even
      times when dad could afford a hired girl, I had to help
      with the dishes and so on and so forth, and oh, Myron, you
      aren't going to send poor lil Effums back to the kitchen
      are you? She just loves to go to theatres and dances and
      restaurants and parties and all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no, no, certainly not! Go to 'em just as
      much--evenings, the second I can get away from my office.
      But I mean . . . Daytimes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I know, but let's wait a while yet. It's sort of fun
      here. But listen, honest, I didn't fall for that lil
      chimpanzee--Murphy or Burphy or Brophy or whatever his name
      was--Mrs. Koreball called him Harry--but I <i>mean:</i> I
      thought he was just <i>silly!'</i>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke at dawn, thinking coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. She's good and honest and kind. She has a real happy
      nature. But she has nothing in herself, in her mind, to
      keep her occupied. And she could never, possibly, hold down
      a job, the way Miss Absolom and the Wild Widow and Tansy
      Quill could . . . That's darn curious, that the three women
      that have impressed me should have been a Jewish
      school-teacher, prob'ly from one of these international
      Jewish families that are interested in music and painting
      the way I am in stew-pans, and a grocery-demonstrator old
      enough to be my aunt, and a quadroon chambermaid! Oh, and
      then Effie for the fourth--four in all, of course, not
      three.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And it was my fault. Effie never for a second pretended to
      be anything she wasn't. And I am crazy about her!
      Apparently just wanting to kiss a woman is a bigger bond in
      marriage than brains or virtue or beauty or any other darn
      thing! And she is so kind and good. I've got to coax her
      into a real home, away from these alimony-leeches. I wonder
      if it will keep me from making my resort inn? Well, if it
      does. . . .'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The candy and cakes and fruit in syrup, the chocolate with
      whipped cream and coffee with four lumps of sugar, the hot
      rolls and fat mutton chops and heaps of hashed brown
      potatoes, which the healthy Black Thread appetite of Effie
      relished and for which idleness gave her time, were all in
      competition with massage, with massage a bad second. Daily
      Effie May weighed herself in the bathroom and wailed, 'Oh,
      I'm getting terribly plump! I <i>must</i> diet!' And
      didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      She still saw enough of Bertha Spinney and of Mrs.
      Koreball, though she was less naive and more suspicious
      about the innumerable Harry Burphys. And if she was still
      bored, now and then, she was rewarded for having to be that
      popular martyr of the era, a Bird in a Gilded Cage, by the
      admiration of her family when they descended from Black
      Thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia, with Willis and young, came, not very much invited,
      to spend a fortnight with her before Christmas, and Julia,
      an authority, said that the Weagle suite was 'simply
      elegant--so much taste'. She treated Effie May almost with
      respect. Herbert, with wife and young, offered themselves
      as guests for the following Easter vacation. Herbert
      insisted that Myron stop shilly-shallying now, and produce
      that large and well-paid hotel job right away, as he had
      promised. (Myron did not remember promising it.) He let it
      be known that he had been ever so generous; he had given
      Myron his own sister, he had forgiven Myron for not being a
      Yale Man, and he had made a point of cutting out every
      reference to hotel affairs in the newspapers and mailing
      them to Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron reflected that there are so many people in the world
      who are eager to do for you things that you do not wish
      done, provided only that you will do for them things you
      don't wish to do. He made a plot, with the
      not-too-unwilling Alec Monlux, now manager of a large
      residential hotel in Yonkers. Alec came calling, affected
      to be awed by Herbert's training and vocabulary, and
      offered him the position of assistant manager of the hotel.
      It was, he said unenthusiastically, a hard job. The last
      three occupants had died of overwork or had committed
      suicide, and for that reason they needed a man with
      Herbert's powers of philosophy. Herbert looked anxious but
      flattered until, after several acts of comedy, Alec led up
      to the climax, which was that Herbert's salary would be
      thirty dollars a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did not come to New York again for a year, and when
      Effie 'ran up' to Black Thread next summer, Myron went with
      her for only forty-eight hours, of which he spent
      thirty-two with his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of that summer, a year after their marriage, Effie May
      loafed through at Frigate Haven Manor, a vast wooden pile
      of an hotel on the South Shore of Long Island. Myron came
      out only for week-ends, but Bertha Spinney had joined her,
      and all summer they munched candy, napped on the beach,
      yawned on the porch, giggled at flattery, and read novels
      about sheikhs and civil engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through one week, a man of whom she later remembered
      only that his white flannels were beautiful made whispered
      love to Effie May by moonlight. She did go to sleep on his
      shoulder one evening, but after that she was snappish. But
      when Myron came out on Saturday, she was waiting for him so
      impatiently that he was gratified and rather bewildered;
      she was at the station when he came in, and when he
      chuckled, 'What do you say to a little tennis before
      dinner?' she panted, 'Oh, no, I want to kiss you, first!'
      and, her hand in his, she dragged him to their room and
      seized him with so desperate a clutch that his whole being
      rose to delight in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had intended to spend most of that week-end in making
      plans for interesting Mark Elphinstone in the Perfect Inn.
      But he swam with her, he loafed close beside her in hot
      little pine woods, and about building the Inn he never
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Eyeing the men who were moved by Effie May's pink and gold
      and by her ardent dancing, and who said that she was not
      one of your doggone, modern, intellectual women that
      bothered you with deep questions, Bertha Spinney had hopes
      for Effie's social career. As they rocked together on the
      Frigate Haven Manor terrace, knitting bright scarfs which
      no one would ever wear, Bertha hinted, 'If you ever got
      divorced from Myron, how much alimony do you think you
      could get?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Get divorced? Get divorced from Myron? Why! I'd never
      dream of such a thing! I love him like anything! Ummmm! I
      could just hug him to death!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, of course, my dear! I didn't mean . . . Don't be
      silly! I just meant, I was thinking about alimony in
      general. Women have to stand together. I never went out for
      the vote and women's rights and all that silly rot, but I
      do remember--I was so interested, I heard Dr. Malvina
      Wormser, this lady doctor, lecturing, and it's just as she
      said, women must stick together and not let these men try
      to put it over on them, and what I meant was . . . of
      course Myron and you will get away with it, but I do think
      every lady ought to know about these things, so that--so
      she can advise others! Just like a lady friend of mine that
      was the first to put me wise that you always got to keep
      men waiting and guessing, or else they'll take advantage of
      you. And what I was thinking of: if you ever have a friend
      that's going to get divorced, you just keep right after
      her, and what is most important, make sure she doesn't sign
      any contract so her alimony ceases if she gets remarried.
      That's where these dirty dogs of Ex's get you! You have to
      watch 'em like a hawk! Of course the second or third time
      you might marry somebody that's richer than the first one
      was, but on the other hand, you might want to marry some
      nice boy that wasn't just mean and penny-pinching and
      commercial like the Old Man was, and that couldn't hardly
      support himself, let alone you, but was so kind and loving
      you didn't mind, and <i>then,</i> of course, you'd want to
      go on getting your income and not give your Ex a chance to
      cut it off, the dirty hog! And serve him right, too! I tell
      you, a girl that's been married to a man, any man, and
      given herself to him, and stood for his nasty tempers and
      his disgusting habits and his behaving the way he does, so
      he prevents you from going on and taking your rightful
      place in social circles, I tell you you've <i>earned</i>
      your share of his cash, and it's your right and <i>duty</i>
      to go on <i>compelling</i> him to give you your just
      rights, and if he's been fool enough to go and make new
      marital arrangements in the meantime, why, that's just
      <i>his</i> hard luck--he certainly never consulted
      <i>you</i> about it! So that's how I mean. If anything
      <i>should</i> ever happen between Myron and you . . . But
      nothing ever will, of course, or I'll be the most surprised
      girl that ever lived!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no-o! I hope and pray that Myron and I will always
      stick to each other!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not like Bertha Spinney, just then. She was
      inexplicably afraid. She wished that Myron were there, to
      protect her, to explain away the hints of danger she felt
      in the Spinney's toothily smiling confidences. She had a
      won'erful idea! She would run into New York to-morrow, to
      surprise him, and stay with him till the next Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the day after was so hot, and Bertha had planned a
      swimming party.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When she returned to the Westward, in the fall, Myron had
      worked out a plan of saving her from sloth. ('Another of my
      darn plans! Oh, Lord, I do hope this one is intelligent!')
    </p>
    <p>
      Many wives of hotel-men took part in running the shop, and
      seemed to enjoy it. Myron had had an uncomfortable feeling
      that he must save Effie from such toil, but pondering
      through lonely evenings all this summer--sitting on hot
      nights in a large chair by a window that looked up hectic
      Broadway, stripped to his undershirt, a cold drink in his
      tired hand--he had convinced himself that this was a
      prejudice springing from the memory of his overworked
      mother in an hotel kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May might become a great executive of the Back of the
      House, and have activity, triumphs, an income of her own.
      Wasn't she a trained cook, housekeeper, buyer--for you
      couldn't tell <i>him</i> that it had been the horse-faced
      Julia, and not his shining Effie May, who had controlled
      the Lambkin mansion!
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May was scarcely back from Frigate Haven when Myron
      cried that he had an Idea!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was nice, said Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why didn't she look over the Westward kitchens and see if
      she could think of any useful changes? Here was her
      commission to do so, signed by Elphinstone and Carlos
      Jaynes, and they had promised that if she had any valuable
      notions, they would pay her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was delighted, and next morning, early--for her--she
      was exploring the kitchen, alone. Myron would not go with
      her. No, he would only be in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had had a tour of them a year ago, but she had noticed
      little beyond the obsequiousness (or so she had considered
      it) of everyone to her big, handsome, clever Myron. Now
      venturing through a swinging door into the vast main
      kitchen, she was bewildered and intimidated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second cook waddled up with, 'Good morning, Mrs.
      Weagle. Anything I can do for you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No--no--I just thought I'd like to look around.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She dared not flourish her pretentious 'commission'.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bravely poked ahead, and at every step was more
      confused by the complex of coal ranges, charcoal broilers,
      steam tables, steam bake-ovens, soup-boilers large as three
      wash-tubs, electric ice-cream freezers, electric
      egg-boilers, machines for grinding bread crumbs and peeling
      vegetables and polishing silver, the butcher-shop,
      refrigerator-rooms with various temperatures for fish,
      game, joints, and milk, storerooms like whole groceries,
      and skilfully operating all these mysteries, a hundred
      brisk men and girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their uniforms were so neat, their hands moved so surely.
      They looked at her as an outsider.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Myron came up to the suite for lunch, expectant, Effie
      May howled. 'I went down and looked at the kitchen, and I
      was absolutely scared! I got all confused! I don't know a
      thing! I just know about frying chicken and scrambling eggs
      and like that, and sitting down and peeling potatoes with a
      little knife and not with a great, big, huge machine! Oh,
      dear!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you could learn . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no, no, no! I'm too stupid! And the noise scared
      me--it was so noisy, and the cooks--oh, they were nice as
      pie, but they were all laughing up their sleeve at me, they
      were, and I was scared!'
    </p>
    <p>
      To comfort her, he took her shopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had always worried because he had never felt able to buy
      jewellery for her. He had heard that pretty women have a
      strange liking for jewellery. That was not very
      comprehensible to him. He had always disliked diamond
      cuff-links and pearl stick-pins on desk clerks. Why didn't
      they buy New York Central stock, or real estate equity, or
      something solid, whose value couldn't ever decrease? But
      still, authorities like Luciano Mora, who understood women,
      assured him that they really did care for these shiny
      stones, and he bravely led Effie May to one of the gaudiest
      shops on Fifth Avenue. There, he was appalled to find that
      what he believed to be such a pretty amethyst, for which he
      would be willing to pay three or four hundred dollars, was
      an alexandrite priced at five thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad to be allowed to sneak off with a
      hundred-dollar opal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May said she liked opals better than anything; there
      was so much fire in them. Just like they were alive!
    </p>
    <p>
      True, Mrs. Koreball convinced her, next day, that opals
      were unlucky, so she never wore the ring again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day Myron wished that they had a baby. They both
      asserted that they wanted one, Effie May most fervently,
      but the gods in charge of that department, so gratifyingly
      prompt with couples who did not want more children and
      could not afford them, had not seen fit to be generous to
      the Weagles. And, he fretted, a baby would save Effie May
      from slipping down into fat uselessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three years of marriage, and four, and five, Effie
      May accepted him as a necessary part of her good-natured,
      candy-nibbling existence, except that now and then she
      tried to be witty about his laboriousness and his
      preference for sleep after midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suspected that she had caught this from the witty, the
      never-sleeping Ora.

    <p>
      Now and then, in café confidences, Myron and Ora Weagle had
      given to their friends curiously similar opinions about the
      effect of childhood environment upon their characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My father,' said Ora, 'was a sloppy, lazy, booze-hoisting
      old bum, and my mother didn't know much besides cooking,
      and she was too busy to give me much attention, and the
      kids I knew were a bunch of foul-mouthed loafers that used
      to hang around the hoboes up near the water-tank, and I
      never had a chance to get any formal schooling, and I got
      thrown on my own as just a brat. So naturally I've become a
      sort of vagabond that can't be bored by thinking about his
      "debts" to a lot of little shop-keeping lice, and I suppose
      I'm inclined to be lazy, and not too scrupulous about the
      dames and the liquor. But my early rearing did have one
      swell result. Brought up so unconventionally, I'll always
      be an Anti-Puritan. I'll never deny the joys of the flesh
      and the sanctity of Beauty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And, 'My father,' said Myron, 'was pretty easy-going and
      always did like drinking and swopping stories with the
      boys, and my mother was hard-driven taking care of us, and
      I heard a lot of filth from the hoboes up near the
      water-tank. Maybe just sort of as a reaction I've become
      almost too much of a crank about paying debts, and fussing
      over my work, and being scared of liquor and women. But my
      rearing did have one swell result. Just by way of contrast,
      it made me a good, sound, old-fashioned New England
      Puritan.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In 1920, when Myron was forty, and Ora thirty-eight, they
      had almost exchanged appearances, except that Myron was
      five inches the taller. He, who had been round-faced and
      slow, was fine-drawn now, and nervously quick, and his
      stiffly rearing flaxen hair, as it grew thinner, had become
      more brown, and lain humbly down under decades of severe
      brushing. The slim, Shelleyan Ora had grown fat. His face
      was an orb of complacency, about the dapper moustache of an
      English police sergeant, and sulky, thickening lips. He
      was, as ever, darker of tint than Myron, but not in every
      light evidently so, for after dinner his cheeks were likely
      to shine greasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron often looked at you but did not seem to see you. Ora
      usually saw you but did not seem to look at you.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was incorrigibly and perpetually bewildered by Ora's
      zig-zag of fortune, and occasionally, for a year at a time,
      he could not make out at all what Ora was doing and why he
      should not be even more bankrupt than he was. After
      <i>Black Slumber;</i> between 1905 and 1920 Ora had five
      other books published: three novels, one very daring,
      dealing with a prostitute who was a good girl, one still
      more daring, dealing with a prostitute who actually was a
      bad girl, and one comic, with involuntary assistance from
      Mr. Dooley, Irvin Cobb, George Ade, and P. G. Wodehouse.
      Then there was his guide to Canada--favourably reviewed by
      all newspapers not published in Canada--and 'The Scientific
      Meaning of Dreams: A Handbook that Shows You to Yourself',
      in which Dr. Freud had been an unconscious collaborator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was proud at the appearance of each of these, and he
      earnestly tried to find out what the book-reviews meant. He
      was excited when he found a publishers' publicity note to
      the effect that Ora Weagle ('Marcel Lenoir'), author of
      <i>Slippers, Be Still,</i> reported as one of the
      twenty-seven best sellers in Augusta, Tallahassee, San
      José, and Mankato, this past month, was planning a trip
      around the world on a whaling-vessel. Or had taken a
      cottage in sight of Bailey's Beach for the summer. Or was
      learning to fly. He never ceased feeling a little puzzled
      and unhappy when he learned from Ora that he had no plans
      whatever for whaling, flying, or viewing Newport.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Ora did between novels, Myron could not comprehend,
      and though he admitted that he was not one who could ever
      understand the ardours and stress of creation, he did
      timidly wonder if five books in fifteen years was so very
      much. And the guide-book and dream-book such little thin
      books, just trickles of mint-flavoured text around large
      raw hunks of illustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authors generally were inexplicable, felt Myron. He knew
      that there were differences between individual
      hotel-keepers, travelling-men, and pot-washers, but it did
      not occur to him that authors were ever anything save
      authors. All his life he was to picture Bernard Shaw as Ora
      Weagle with a beard, and Thoreau as an Ora who drank his
      whisky and sang 'Frankie and Johnny' in a log cabin instead
      of in a Fiftieth Street speakeasy.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or no his ponderous and hypocritical brother
      understood him, Ora was always busy. A fellow had to be, to
      make a living in a world that rewarded such mutton-heads as
      hotel-keepers and stockbrokers, but too much feared the mad
      power of beauty to give decent support to its creative
      artists. It wouldn't even provide a tiny pension, so that
      he might be secure, with bare provision for his modest
      wants--a cot-bed, a chair or two, a little porridge and
      lobster salad, a quite infrequent jaunt to Europe or China,
      a few cigarettes and bottles of whisky and champagne, some
      girls, a refreshing summer in the mountains, a humble
      little motor car for the gathering of material, just enough
      of a wardrobe so that the Maestro would not be shamed in
      the presence of supercilious millionaires, a cocktail now
      and then, a flat no larger than might be necessary for the
      entertainment of the combined editors of America, a couple
      of Monets for inspiration, just a shelf or so of
      hand-tooled books, with a mere emergency-stock of liqueur
      brandy, absinthe, Swedish punch, arrack, Burgundy, Chateau
      Yquem, and perhaps rum--and he was even willing to give up
      the rum. Yet no one, even among those who pretended to be
      patrons of genius, was willing to give him such an
      insignificant pension. And Ora knew. He knew! For he had
      made it his business to approach every foundation for the
      cultivation of the arts, every committee in charge of
      awarding prizes or fellowships, and every publisher
      rumoured to have gone insane and to have given advances on
      unwritten books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron did not merely bore him but furiously irritated him
      by incessant, clumsy, pawing hints about leading what he
      comically called a 'more regular life'. Yet he had to see
      Myron often. He had to live! And he really liked Myron's
      new wife--a kid from their own home town, Effie May
      Lambkin. She was good fun, for she thought Ora was the
      wittiest man she had known, and worshipped him instead of
      trying to get cute, like so many of these women. She was
      always glad to order up a late supper for him or, when
      Myron got stuffy, to lend him enough to get through till
      Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora was proud of the fact that, though Effie May was a
      beauty, in a coarse, hoydenish sort of way, he was so loyal
      to the family that he had made practically no effort to
      seduce her. And then Myron thought he was a rounder!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, he was busier than his brother could possibly know,
      and he had to do everything by himself, without any help
      from a crew of clerks and stenographers such as Myron had,
      so that Myron could sit on his bottom and never do any real
      work at all. Say what they liked, Ora knew that he was
      systematic. He had compiled a list of fifty fellow American
      authors who were sufficiently well rewarded, i.e.,
      commercial, so that they were worth soliciting, and he
      spent days in composing a letter confiding to these
      colleagues his difficulties, which were, it appeared, as
      follows: he was engaged in the last fatiguing months of
      finishing a long novel, his wife was ill, his two children
      were hungry and without enough clothing to go to school,
      his rent was unpaid, and unless the benefactor could send
      him three hundred dollars at once, the whole bunch of them
      would have to commit suicide. This form letter he changed
      only in the first paragraph, in which he mentioned several
      books by the author--which was easy, because they were all
      listed in <i>Who's Who--</i>and the last, where in the
      simple, grave-eyed manner of a genius willing to face
      starvation and bend his pride to begging, he explained that
      though they had not met him personally, through the
      master's books (give titles) he knew his kindness, justice,
      and astounding knowledge of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first letter, from fifty prospects he had sixteen
      answers, with seven refusals, and nine cheques ranging from
      ten dollars to one hundred and fifty, in total, six hundred
      and five dollars. None of them sent the full three hundred,
      but they crawled with apology for not doing so, which was
      precisely his reason for having put it so high.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a second letter to the thirty-four hounds who had not
      answered, he collected eleven more replies, with another
      hundred and thirty dollars, netting seven hundred and
      thirty-five dollars for six days' work--two days composing
      the form and four in typing the letters, and if the
      swell-head Myron could ever do as well as that, Ora would
      just like to know! Beaming upon his honestly and arduously
      earned pile, Ora went on a splendid drunk with Colonel
      Falkenstein, Wilson Ketch and, from time to time, various
      girls, most of whom he did not remember having met before.
      They did, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sober again, and very sick, with only sixteen dollars left
      of the seven hundred and thirty-five, and three months'
      rent due for his attic, Ora devoted himself to the
      twenty-three megalomaniacs who even yet had not been
      courteous enough to answer. Regarding these snobs, he had
      an airy wine-born plan. He wrote them a third time, not
      tenderly but insultingly. They were, he eloquently put it,
      boors, ingrates, cowards, and reactionaries. While they
      were making fools of themselves by trying to ape the rich
      with their Palm Beach villas, Vermont stock farms, and
      royal suites on liners, he was forced to support himself by
      stoking furnaces twelve hours a night, that he might devote
      himself to creating a Real American Art.
    </p>
    <p>
      This drew, from the twenty-three, twelve more blanks, three
      cheques, and eight letters of furious reply. It was for the
      last that he had really been hoping. Here he had eight
      original and unpublished manuscripts, three of them
      holograph, in which eight of the most competent writers in
      America ungrudgingly devoted themselves and their noblest
      blasphemy to making it clear that they regarded him as a
      liar, a crook, and a damned nuisance. He read them with
      shouts of happiness, and bustled out to sell them to an
      autograph dealer, at from three to sixty dollars apiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made second and third and fourth lists of fifty
      philanthropists each, extending his sales-appeal from the
      innocent composers of books to newspaper editorial writers,
      colyumists, cartoonists, playwrights, and rich women
      reported as having attended public poetry-readings, and he
      widened his selling area to take in Canada, Great Britain,
      Ireland, France, and Germany. Each three months he made a
      spirited campaign of high-pressure-salesmanship, and
      cannily did not return to any list oftener than once a
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      So on the whole, the Ora who with shy boyishness, with
      wistfully quivering thick lips, showed to Myron and Effie
      May the gin-scented attic in which he had to live, had a
      slightly larger income than Myron's, which thought made him
      laugh secretly but very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he gallantly continued with his books and infrequent
      magazine fiction, and though his four lists demanded so
      much painful typing, Ora was most occupied by ghosting--the
      writing of books to be signed by other and more famous
      persons. He came to have rather a sound reputation for the
      work, and various publishers sent for him, though they
      disgusted him by sourly refusing to pay one penny till the
      work was done--the dirty money-grubbers! Thus, at various
      times, Ora was an ex-senator who had destroyed the Wall
      Street millionaires, another ex-senator who had wiped out
      the Reds, a Russo-Polish-Spanish-Iowa actress who had three
      kings as lovers, a forger who had done twenty years in the
      pen, a chess champion, and a Hollywood dog.

      Ghosting paid better than the composition of begging
      letters, but he never gave them up, for no sacrifice was
      too great for his art. And it was as an artist, as a seer,
      that he was able, he crowed, to put it all over Myron.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Ora had been thinking about a new realistic novel in which
      he would crucify a horrible parent named Tim Wiggins, who
      kept a foul restaurant and was beastly to his sensitive
      son, and possibly in connection with this enterprise he had
      run up to Black Thread Centre for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returned, he charged in on Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, the great innkeeper and psychologist, that can tell
      a crook before he's signed the register, has certainly
      pulled one swell boner!' said Ora, winking at Myron's
      pretty typist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron hastily sent her out, and stormed, 'What the devil do
      you mean now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've been up to the Centre, and I saw Dad and Mom, and
      since you were so kind as to rescue them from working and
      give them a nice easy old age, in their lovely little
      bungalow among the roses--well, they're simply going nuts
      with nothing to do, that's all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron went to Black Thread next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother was sitting in a filthy kitchen, before a sink
      of dirty dishes, crying. She had, she sobbed, so got out of
      the habit of activity that now she could not stir at all,
      and old Tom, no longer needing to make an appearance as
      host, was drinking worse than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've tried reading, and I've tried church-work and I've
      tried knitting and talking to the neighbours, but I guess
      folks like us, that have worked real hard all our lives,
      just don't know how to loaf,' she said. 'I'm kind of
      scared, dear. I've been noticing how many business folks
      seem to suddenly pop off and die, when they retire and say
      they're so glad they're out of the harness and now they're
      going to have a good time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was bewildered. He assured himself that he really had
      meant well. He told himself that he would not afford to buy
      off the present lessee of the American House, and that if
      he did, his parents would let it go dirty and slack. He
      thought about a farm for them--he tried to consult them,
      but his mother only wept and looked forlorn. He might have
      rented a farm, except that at the Lambkins', when he hinted
      of his problem, Herbert blatted, 'Now you're married into
      Our Family, you can't go on being selfish and just thinking
      of yourself, the way you always have! . . . That fellow
      Monlux, offering a man with my degrees fifteen hundred a
      year, and you never even called him down! . . . And I want
      to tell you that I'm not going to have <i>my sister's</i>
      father-in-law running a miserable little tavern right here
      in our own town! Why don't you put 'em on a farm?'
    </p>
    <p>
      That did it. Myron gave his father and mother a wild week
      in New York--Tom said that the Westward wasted a lot of
      good coin, dressing up the bell-hops in fool monkey
      jackets, and as a seasoned executive he disapproved of such
      incompetence--and he settled them again at the American
      House, where Edna Weagle, as she toiled twelve hours a day,
      began again to whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ora commented on it all, 'Just as I've always told you,
      Myron, you lack the artist's sense of people. You're
      probably more generous than I am, in some ways, but I see
      inside people and let 'em alone.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman whom Ora brought up to the suite to meet
      Effie May and Myron, late in the evening, was a very
      friendly young woman. Within ten minutes she was calling
      them 'Teeny the Swede' and 'Snookums', and she was
      demanding, 'Well, where's the hooch? What's the idea of
      holding out on the girl friend like this?' And after the
      whisky, a good deal of it, she offered to take off her
      clothes and do imitations of Isadora Duncan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron saw that the perplexed Effie May was wondering
      whether she ought to take her brother-in-law's lady-friend
      as a model. He lured Ora to the bedroom, and remarked,
      'Take that girl away. Chase her out of here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What the devil do you mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't like her, though probably she's merely silly.
      Out!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I'll go, too! And I'll stay away!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right. Sorry not to see you again, but this is my
      house. . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh no, it isn't, darling! It's anybody's house that's got
      the money, no matter what a stinker he may be, and you're
      just a hired man in it--you and your hick wife!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron raised his fist, dropped it to his side, and
      muttered, 'Get out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not see Ora for a year after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt guilty and considerably relieved. He pictured his
      poor little brother in that poor little attic of his, and
      doubtless he would have suffered if it had not been for the
      fact that, as Ora was unanimously agreed, he lacked
      imagination.

    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the early autumn of 1916, when they had been
      married for five years, that Myron became prouder than ever
      he had been in his life, prouder and taller and more
      excited. Effie May announced that she was going to have a
      baby!
    </p>
    <p>
      Healthy wench as she was, though too well fed, she had no
      unusual trial, and in the spring in 1917, they had an
      eight-pound son, very fine and exceptionally
      handsome--which meant that even in the first month he was
      recognizably human. Now, along with every thought about his
      Perfect Inn, Myron gave another thought to the future when
      he would go hunting and fishing and travelling with His
      Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was named Luke, more or less after Luciano Mora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the baby's birth, Myron did what he called 'putting
      his foot down', and insisted that they must have more of a
      home than an hotel suite . . . How he reconciled it with
      his advertisements that 'A Suite at the Luxurious Westward
      Ho! Will Solve All Your Housekeeping Problems--We're Glad
      to do Your Hiring and Firing!' he never explained to
      himself nor ever tried to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May said that she 'wasn't--quite--sure--it's kind of
      convenient living in the city'. Myron was sure for her.
      'I'm certainly not going to have our baby grow up one of
      these horrible, ringleted hotel-children, yelling in the
      corridors and bossing the servants and showing off to
      strangers,' he said, and was beautifully unconscious of any
      heresy to his faith as a sealed hotel-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found and rented a seven-room house with a small
      garden in Mount Vernon, not too far from the station. Once
      it was veritably his, his own house, at least for a year,
      Myron found it magic with privacy. Its white wooden pillars
      and roofing of green imitation slates, its short sidewalk
      of parti-coloured slabs of stone, its yellow brick
      fireplace, its piano and glassed-in unit-bookcases and
      ash-tray stands were different, obviously, from those of
      any other house in Westchester County, and possibly in
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doubtful Effie, as the neighbours came in to see
      whether she was correct in the matters of piety and bridge,
      found the place at least won'erful. 'Why, now we got all
      the nice things in both New York and Black Thread!' she
      would explain, with awe. 'I can go in for the theatre or to
      see Bertha, and still have a garden and quiet for Junior,
      and such dandy neighbours to run in on--high-class--lots of
      them have tea almost every afternoon, and they play real
      bridge, for money!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron loved the peace of it--what time he had it. Often he
      could not get home till midnight; often he had to be away
      by seven in the morning. But he rejoiced in seeing Effie
      May and Luke in the diminutive garden. He was only a little
      angry, so used was he to this attitude, when certain of his
      neighbours hinted that as an hotel-man, he would be able to
      direct them to gay but economical ladies and to powerful
      but inexpensive booze.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the solitude of the many, on trains, he had the leisure
      now to make plans in his latest note-book for the Perfect
      Inn. During the war, when he served in the Quartermaster's
      Corps, he enjoyed that dangerous position, because he could
      be home every evening and all day Sunday. When the conflict
      was over, at least theoretically, he went back to his
      regular work as Mark Elphinstone's first assistant and to
      his irregular hours at home with Effie and the miraculous
      Luke, who was no dullard as he himself had been but, at
      eighteen months, could say 'Da!' He was saving money
      constantly, investing it, after a good deal of inquiry,
      mostly in hotel shares. Its accumulation was in his mind
      related with Effie, Luke, and the Perfect Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never missed a train into the city, but he was never
      seen to hurry . . . A tall man, inexpressive of face, a
      typical dull captain of business, making little business
      notes in a little pocket-book, in the smug smokiness of a
      commuters' train that clattered through dun fog streaked
      with factory fumes, while in his attic Ora still lay
      dreaming of damsels in Poictesme.

    </p>
    <p>
      Through all of 1918, Mark Elphinstone was weakened by
      attacks of angina pectoris, and the instant he was out of
      the army, Myron became unofficial president of the
      Elphinstone chain. Now he first really knew Mark as a human
      being.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years Mark had lived in a large and very pseudo
      baronial apartment on the top floor of the Westward, with
      imitation beams, a heraldic fireplace, and a mute
      musicians'-gallery in the salon. Myron had rarely been in
      it, but now Mark lay abed and Myron went daily to see him.
      He was present through two of Mark's dreadful attacks,
      brought on by anger, or by an effort to get up and dress.
      Then, in an agony that lasted a minute and seemed to last
      an hour, Mark felt as though he were dying, as though a
      great hand were squeezing his heart, while the pain cut a
      gash up to his neck and down his left arm. He panted, his
      eyes bulging with terror. Myron and the nurse stood by the
      bed, in the embarrassment of futility. The horror gone, he
      would try to laugh, and mutter, 'Tell Carlos Jaynes to stop
      grabbing my heart--tell him to stop it--want it stopped
      right away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked now, wanderingly, of his private life. He was a
      widower; his one child, a daughter, was married to a lawyer
      of elegance, living in Brookline. Myron guessed, when he
      saw her, that she was gallantly trying to forgive her
      father for still living. She wore satin with chastely
      dangling chains, and was very crisp and literate, and her
      father was humble and conciliatory in her presence. For
      hours, when she had gone, Mark boasted to Myron about his
      daughter's music, her Italian, her friendship with bishops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor warned Mark that he must 'avoid all muscular
      excess and all emotion', and Mark's latest secretary, the
      clean, swift, amiable, rather dull young Mr. Clark Cleaver
      (he was rumoured to be a wizard at the parallel bars and
      flying rings in the Y.M.C.A. gymnasium) kept stirring Mark
      into furious emotion by coaxing him to avoid all emotion.
      Myron had sense enough to let him rave and get it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Carlos Jaynes faction who brought on the
      catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaynes' brother-in-law, large stockholder in the
      Elphinstone Company, called on Mark. Myron was not present,
      but he learned from Clark Cleaver that the brother-in-law
      pussy-catted about, patted Mark's hand, assured him that he
      would instantly be out and playing eighteen holes of golf,
      and then, with just the playful tactfulness which the bluff
      brigand most detested, hinted that Mark ought to resign and
      make Jaynes his successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brother-in-law gone, Myron was sent for, and arrived by
      Mark's bed along with the hotel doctor. Mark was raving,
      'That damned Jaynes and his damned relatives! I'll fire
      him! He's fired right now! Cleaver, you get on the 'phone
      and tell Jaynes he's fired, right now.' Cleaver dared not
      move. 'Get him, I tell you, get him, get him, get him on
      the 'phone, I tell you! They think they've got me down!
      They think they can jam Jaynes down my throat! I'll show
      'em! I'm not afraid of any man living. I'm not afraid of
      anything!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He choked. He clenched his fists in agony. His face was
      grey as March snow, and was greased over with cold sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I am afraid of death!' he whimpered.
    </p>
    <p>
      His old kneaded face fell into the blankness of childhood;
      defiance and courage dropped from it, and he muttered,
      'Afraid of death! Myron! Cleaver! Stick by me! Stay there.
      Don't go away. I feel lonely. I'm afraid!' Veteran wisdom
      and courage came back into it, as the spasm lifted, and he
      snarled, 'I won't let 'em make me afraid, with their damn
      sympathy! Eighteen holes of golf! There's no man living can
      make me play golf! My game is Men, and they can't beat me!
      I've licked 'em!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And he gasped and died.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The directors of the Elphinstone Company met two hours
      after the funeral, and learned that Mark Elphinstone's
      daughter, his sole heir, had contracted to sell all her
      holdings in the company to Carlos Jaynes and his
      brother-in-law. They elected Jaynes president of the
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after that, Jaynes sent for Myron and merrily
      offered to him the assistant managership of the Elphinstone
      Akron hotel.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Carlos Jaynes was not vastly popular with his fellow
      hotel-men throughout the country. It did not at all hurt
      the reputation of Myron to have been kicked out. After a
      week--though that week, with its agonizing enforced
      idleness, was long enough--he was offered the managership
      of an hotel in Wilmington, and took it, leaving Effie May
      and Luke in Mount Vernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left Wilmington for the not-too-important but
      instructive job of chief assistant manager at the Hotel
      Crillon of New York, which had only five hundred rooms but
      was the newest and smartest hotel in the country, with a
      clientele altogether different from the run of amiable and
      prosperous social nobodies at the old Westward. The Crillon
      was patronized by ambassadors, princes, international
      crooks, and Americans so wealthy that they could afford to
      live on Long Island and again be farmers like their
      grandparents. He learned not to blink at
      hundred-dollar-a-day suites and small sleek dinners in
      private dining-room at fifty dollars a plate; he learned
      that one-half, at least, of the excessively rich are as
      annoyed as one-half, at least, of the excessively poor when
      they are insulted by receiving bills; and learned an Alice
      in Wonderland arithmetic whereof the chief problem was:
      'Which pays better, ten dollars a day that you get or a
      hundred dollars a day that you don't get?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not vastly care for the Crillon, its deftly
      obsequious staff, or its deftly supercilious guests. Not
      even yet was he fond of foot-kissing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one summer he was manager of the Frigate Haven, with
      Effie and Luke near him in an hotel cottage; for nearly a
      year and a half he was managing director of a large hotel
      in Philadelphia; and by then, in 1922, when he was
      forty-two years old, he had enough reputation and enough
      advantage from the hotel-world's continued enmity to Carlos
      Jaynes, to be able to stop roving, and settle down in a
      position that was by far the most important and best paid
      he had yet held: general director of all the Pye-Charian
      Hotels of New York, and managing director of their largest
      house, the Victor Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Pye-Charian Company consisted of four men: Richard
      Montgomery Pye, the president; Adolph Charian, a fat,
      thoroughly vulgar, and thoroughly shrewd contractor;
      Colonel Ormond L. Westwind, the celebrated criminal lawyer,
      after-dinner speaker, and vestryman of St. Thomas's, and
      Nick Schirovsky, who called himself a manufacturer of
      mineral waters and whom Myron more than suspected of being
      a wholesale bootlegger. Myron himself and 'Jimmy' Shanks,
      manager of one of the Pye hotels, also had each a few
      shares in the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The holdings consisted of the Victor Hugo, a new
      eleven-hundred-bedroom, each-with-bath, transient hotel in
      upper Broadway, and six residential hotels on the West Side
      of New York between Seventieth and
      One-Hundred-and-Twenty-Fifth Streets. The largest of the
      residential hotels was The Dickens, on Riverside Drive,
      managed by Shanks. Jimmy was big and jovial and grinning
      and practical-joking, with his crisp rolls of the blackest
      hair; a shrewder and modernized version of J. Hector
      Warlock. He had played football for two years at the
      University of Kentucky, and been expelled for inattention
      to his books and general hell-raising.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old friend of Myron, Clark Cleaver, Elphinstone's last
      secretary, was also with Pye-Charian, as chief clerk of the
      Walter Scott Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all these men, it was Richard Montgomery Pye whom Myron
      saw most often. His job, as president, was to control the
      somewhat mysterious finances of the chain, and to demand
      improvements which Myron had to carry out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Pye was slender and suave as a greyhound on a silver
      chain. He was chief among the new sort of hotel-men,
      detested by Mark Elphinstone, who were as likely to arrange
      their affairs on the golf links, in country-club bars, or
      in fast motor cars as in offices or the kitchen. He was a
      smiling man, not very tall and not over forty; he was
      apparently accepted as one of their own by the most
      pretentious country-club-and-estate circles on Long Island,
      and he played polo with the second team of the Old Chapel
      Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pye's origin was in dispute. One faction asserted that he
      was the son of a doubtful minor Tammany official and had
      begun his career by selling newspapers and continued it as
      bell-boy in a scabby hotel in the old Tenderloin, but his
      friends contended that he came from what is known as a
      'fine old family'. Virginians said he came from a fine old
      family in Massachusetts, and Massachusettsans said he came
      from a fine old family in Virginia. Harvard men said he was
      a graduate of Yale, Yale men said he was a graduate of
      Princeton, and Princeton men were divided between Harvard,
      Yale, the University of Oklahoma, and Maine Agricultural
      College. And Dick Pye smiled and never explained and played
      polo and arranged for mortgages and persuaded smart but
      liquorous young men to take costly suites at the Victor
      Hugo or The Dickens for the whole winter season, and seemed
      to know what Myron and Jimmy Shanks and Clark Cleaver were
      doing, every moment, and what unknown clerks, in some
      second-rate houses a thousand miles away, could be trained
      to take their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      All very old and very rich women said that 'Dicky' was the
      sweetest boy they had ever seen, and all professional
      gamblers said that his poker was worthy of the most eminent
      practitioners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron liked Dick Pye and the Victor Hugo enormously, for a
      few months, then dreaded them as poisonous, after the
      honest piracy of Mark Elphinstone.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      His job was to control every department of the Victor Hugo,
      as resident manager, and to glance over the conduct of the
      six residential hotels. To these he was to give not so much
      time as experience and dependability. He looked into their
      kitchens or linen-rooms or garbage-trucks or the pile of
      chambermaids' O.K.'s on made-up rooms, and sometimes there
      was fatherly advice to department-heads and sometimes there
      was quick guillotining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of his hours were devoted to the Victor Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The changes in hotels, in New York, and in all America,
      between 1905, when Myron had gone from Tippecanoe Lodge to
      the Westward, and the 1920's, were illustrated by the
      differences between the Westward and the Victor Hugo. The
      Hugo was intended to appeal to the same sort of solid,
      upper-middle-class, prosperous patrons, and it was on the
      same Broadway, though twenty blocks farther north. But it
      was nearly twice as large, eleven hundred rooms against six
      hundred and fifty, and it had none of the spurious grandeur
      which had gladdened the guests of the Westward in 1905;
      none of the velvet or tortured ironwork or carved teak or
      copper minarets or bread-pudding marble. It had, indeed,
      the 'good taste', or what to the 1920's and 1930's, seemed
      the good taste, of massive simplicity. The main entrance
      was a severe doorway of Indiana limestone, with no awning
      of glass and gilded iron; the lobby, lined with uncarved
      cedar panels, was half the size of the Westward's, and
      considerably less inviting to lobby-loungers; the elevators
      bore no sunbursts of brass, but they were thrice as swift
      and silent, and the elevator-runners discoursed on the
      current weather only with clients who desired it. The
      Victor Hugo bedrooms were free of imitation-brocade and
      lace table-covers, armchairs with frayed fringes, and
      ornamental brass beds which, even after many renovations,
      were still to be found in the Westward. There was less of
      tax-breeding space and fewer dust-collecting ornaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanization had increased hugely, with air-conditioning,
      radios in all rooms, central vacuum-cleaning plant,
      electric refrigeration, stainless metal alloys instead of
      damp and seamy surfaces throughout the kitchens. There was
      a 'coffee-shop', approximately as large as the Grand
      Central and as busy. There were graduates of the Cornell
      and other hotel-schools in every corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the Victor Hugo was more expeditious and
      sophisticated and in better taste than the Westward, the
      trim bedrooms were far smaller, with less room for nervous
      patrons to poke about; if the washed and filtered air was
      purer, there seemed to be less of it for placid breathing;
      if the restaurants were better lighted, they were less
      leisurely; if there were more tropical fruits, there was
      less generous cooking; if the whole thing had become a
      better machine, it had become a less comfortable home.
    </p>
    <p>
      America and the hotel of 1905 were not far from the America
      and the inn of Martin Chuzzlewit; America of the late
      1920's had lost for all time that large, loquacious,
      gallant, often comic, rusticity. It had driven from
      Saratoga Springs to Nice, in a sixteen-cylinder car. It had
      gone from cotton stockings to silk; from the small beer of
      Weber and Fields to the champagne in 'Of Thee I Sing'; and
      sometimes Myron was bewildered and a little uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests of the Victor Hugo had familiar faces--more
      regularly shaved than at the Westward--yet their hearts
      seemed to Myron different, and he did not altogether like
      the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still had the old dependables: the up-state banker and
      his family who came to New York for a month, for shopping
      and the opera, the Detroit purchasing agent and the Phoenix
      department-store buyer and the branch-manager from Spokane,
      all of them trained travellers who appreciated service. But
      among them, as was natural to an hotel which had Nick
      Schirovsky as one of its owners, had crept a new race of
      mild and solid-looking and well-behaved men, quietly
      dressed and most generous with tips, whom he guessed to be
      gamblers, racketeers, sellers of dubious stock and real
      estate. They did nothing of which you could complain;
      indeed they were ever so much quieter about sending for
      mineral water to accompany illicit whisky than were the
      innocent buyers, and they were less likely to sing 'Mandy,
      Mandy, Sweet as the Sugar Cane' after it. Yet Myron hated
      them, and felt insecure when he observed their intimacy
      with the aristocratic Mr. Richard Montgomery Pye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that the bell-boys were procuring liquor for the
      guests, from the lofty superintendent of service, but he
      could do nothing about it. They were under licence of Dick
      Pye, and they shared the profit with Pye, Charian,
      Schirovsky, and the pious Colonel Westwind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they shared, neither profits nor confidences with
      Myron. That was the one detail of the hotel-management that
      he neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had some comfort out of investing in Frigate Haven
      Manor, and a larger, more ambitious summer resort, Laurel
      Farms, and in improving his investments by giving advice as
      an expert.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after three and a quarter years as general director of
      the Pye-Charian Hotels, he felt that he was in a blind
      alley. He might be a good innkeeper. He believed that he
      was. But just as he had never been particularly obsequious
      to the German barons and French vicomtes and Long Island
      squires at the Hotel Crillon, so he could make no especial
      effort to impress the slick friends of Nick Schirovsky as
      their natural provider and protector.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said so to Gritzmeier the chef, and was shocked into
      doing something about it, instead of merely sitting around
      and enjoying his noble discontent.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Otto Gritzmeier was managing chef of the Hotel Victor Hugo,
      and for him Myron had more respect and liking than for any
      other officer in the Pye-Charian chain. He was a Swiss,
      trained in Lausanne, Biarritz, Hamburg, Milan, and
      Bournemouth. At fifty he had come to America as chef of the
      distinguished Restaurant Sylvère, but that shrine of
      gourmets had closed with Prohibition, and Gritzmeier had
      reluctantly turned from Homard Sauté à la Dumas to the
      Standard Cost per Ounce of Hamburg Steak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was merely supposed to confer with him several times
      a week, in the director's office, about menus and special
      dinners and the equipment and personnel of the kitchen, but
      almost every day found Myron sitting at Gritzmeier's desk,
      in his tiny glass-walled office in the good reek of the
      enormous kitchen, happily recovering from Schirovskism.
      Just Gritzmeier's appearance, the floury yet healthy
      cheeks, the grey huzzar moustache and imperial, the tall
      cap and apron and overalls (for Gritzmeier was one of the
      few managing chefs who refused to dress in a lounge suit)
      was refreshing after the pink-cheeked, ebon-haired,
      glossily brown-suited guests in the more expensive suites
      of the Victor Hugo. He became almost as intimate with
      Gritzmeier as he once had been with Luciano Mora--the
      cautious ultra-Yankee released by his admiration for an
      ultra-Continental.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day in September, 1925, he growled to Gritzmeier,
      'We've got to get together next week and plan the
      supper-dance menus for the season for the Laurentian Grill.
      Damn the grill! I hate planning anything for a bunch of
      drugstore cowboys with pocket flasks--trying to compete
      with the speakeasies! I've always wanted to have a really
      good country inn--good as any resort hotel in Europe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then vy don't you, Chief?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it's difficult getting started . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'T'ree years you've been talking about your fine inn.
      Talking! Vy don't you <i>do</i> it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You got some money saved, aind't you? You can get the
      rest, cand't you? Vy don't you do something? You aind't
      going to get a whole lot younger, Chief!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're right. I'm forty-five and . . . I'll do it! I
      <i>guess</i> I will!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And, rather scared, he knew he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easier to undertake the labour of financing and
      building his Perfect Inn than it was to loiter and face the
      cynical old eyes of Otto Gritzmeier.

      'I just don't know where all my time goes to,' was Effie
      May's favourite observation. She said it oftener, these
      days, than 'won'erful'.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a larger house in Mount Vernon now, but in the
      same neighbourhood. Playing after school-hours with Luke, a
      tall boy of eight, finding out what orders the maid had
      decided to receive and then giving them, playing Russian
      Bank with Myron on evenings when he did not feel like
      reading, discussing garden seeds and the wearing-quality of
      boys' trouserings with the neighbours, trimming the church
      with flowers and rather irregularly going to a women's
      musical and literary club, she lived the same busy and
      unplanned life that she would have lived in Black Thread,
      save that once a fortnight she went into the city for the
      theatre or a placid, domestic afternoon in a speakeasy with
      Bertha Spinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was well content, and gnawed candy as delicately and as
      much as ever. She was extremely fat, and at thirty-four
      looked a cheerful forty, and now that she rarely heard
      Ora's sneers, she regarded Myron as a sage, and knew that
      he depended on her as on cool water.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had telephoned that he would be home at seven, and
      Luke had been permitted to sit up for him. Luke was riding
      his tricycle back and forth on the cement walk from street
      to house, occasionally falling off it into the bug-eaten
      rose-bushes. The tall, nervous shape of his father swung
      around the street corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hello, daddy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hello!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hel-LO!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hello, son.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whaja bring me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a thing!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not <i>any</i>thing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not one darn thing!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not anything at <i>all?'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir! Expect me to bring you a present every night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure-pop!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who ever taught you to say that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In school and then, of course, you always say it to ma.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I do, eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Uh-huh, sure, every day!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, then, I guess I'll have to see if anybody's stuck
      any chocolate in my pocket. Though, mind you, Luke, I
      disapprove of bribery as a means of enforcing discipline in
      large, efficient, modern institutions like this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Uh-huh. Oh, that's swell--peanut brittle!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Luke! How would you like to live right out in the country,
      but near a lovely inn with grand food--fishing and swimming
      and meadows and hiking and squirrels and--oh, and
      flowers--you know, everything! Real country! How'd you like
      that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Punk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, really! Wouldn't you love the country?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Naw. I like it here. It's all hicks in the country--like
      at Uncle Herbert's. Let's stay here. Or maybe move into New
      York. That would be dandy! Then I could go to the movies
      twice a day!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron meditated, 'That helps! I can see that everybody is
      going to approve enthusiastically of my going off to run a
      country inn. Splendid! Oh hell. . . . But Luke will like
      it! I'll make the kind of place he'll like!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      'I've told you lots of times about building a really
      first-class inn,' said Myron. 'You know--my farm near the
      Centre. Lake Nekobee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sure, ten thousand times,' said Effie. She yawned,
      then smiled in apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, at last, after chewing the rag about it so many
      years and being scared of undertaking it all the time, I'm
      really going to do it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Honestly?' She was affectionate, and entirely unimpressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. I mean it. Now I want you to pay some attention,
      Effie. If I put this through, or rather, when I do, it will
      affect you. We'll have to live there--I aim to have a place
      I can keep open all the year round--winter sports, too--and
      we'll have to live there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, but darling!' She squeaked like a cornered mouse. 'I
      can't leave the nice neighbours here, and Junior used to
      the school and all, and the Centre--oh, of course, it would
      be lovely to be near the Family, I suppose, but to not ever
      be able to get to New York and see some shows. . . . Oh, I
      don't think that would be any fun at all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We'll try to get down to New York for a month every
      winter, or say late fall, between seasons, and not do a
      blessed thing then but raise Cain and enjoy ourselves, and
      that's something we've never had time to do, never.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked about her well-loved sitting-room, the huge
      cabinet gramophone, the automatic heat-regulator, the
      silver cocktail shaker that would be taboo within reach of
      Brother Herbert. He knew that she was trying to nerve
      herself, and for her confused gallantry he loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, if you think it's best, Myron.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look! I'll build us a grand cottage near the Inn--lots
      more room for Luke to play than here, and I don't know that
      the school in the Centre will be so much worse for him.
      These kids around New York are so frightfully fresh and
      knowing and impertinent. "Sure-pop"!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I guess there'd be some nice folks at the Inn, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that she felt insecure. Oughtn't he to give up this
      unnecessary plan and go on with Pye-Charian? No! Be valet
      to Nick Schirovsky and his friends or, at best, give his
      life to wholesale cafeteria-keeping? There was peace and
      quiet skill in the tradition of every ancient Cat and
      Fiddle, or White Hart, or Old Bell, in which immemorially
      tired and drenched and hungry men had taken their ease. And
      he would make a greater masterpiece than any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I wish Effie could see it like that,' he pondered.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He talked frankly about it to Ora, for Ora, he told
      himself, was the one person who would understand his doing
      something a little unconventional.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year after he had kicked Ora and his girl out of the
      Westward--almost ten years ago, now--they had run into each
      other on the street, sheepishly shaken hands, and gone to
      lunch. He had seen Ora occasionally ever since. Hugely
      approving, he discovered that Ora had an almost regular job
      writing two-reelers for the movies, and articles for the
      new magazines devoted to the movie world, and he said
      profoundly, 'If he does get drunk pretty often, still
      there's quite a few fellows with good minds that have that
      unfortunate habit!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He outlined the Perfect Inn and his determination to leave
      Pye-Charian. He waited for the first approval since Otto
      Gritzmeier's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Huh!' said Ora. 'I think you're a damn fool. Here you've
      got a good chance to go ahead with these high-class
      bootleggers and be a member of the firm some day, and then
      you can transfer to some other big outfit that isn't
      crooked, or only just average crooked. And you want to
      chase off and start another fancy arty tea-room, the kind
      you made out of the American House! My dear Myron, a man
      who doesn't have originality for his long suit oughtn't to
      strut around trying to show off his originality!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll do it, just the same!' growled Myron, and talked of
      baseball.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Montgomery Pye, giving audience in his office,
      which resembled a Louis XVI boudoir reproduced by a
      steel-manufacturer, remarked formally, 'I won't say that
      the firm, or at least Adolph Charian and I, might not come
      in on financing your inn. But I think the project is pretty
      small for a man of your executive ability. At best, it
      would only pay a fair profit on a few hundred thousand. You
      see, I'm laying my cards on the table, Weagle. We're more
      than satisfied with you. I think sometimes you're too
      cautious, and worry too much about penny-pinching, but
      then, we're all four too much inclined to gamble, and you
      check us, and you have the patience to fuss with which firm
      will sell crackers at a sixteenth of a cent less a pound,
      and you don't customarily steal the handles off the office
      safe. Why don't you stick with us, and get in on the big
      money? We might take you in as a partner in a few years,
      and make it easy for you to acquire a share, and I can see
      us swinging an hotel twice as big as this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And twice as noisy!' Myron thought silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So give up this idea of yours for a year or so, anyway,
      and stick around.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I'm sorry, Pye, but I'm all set on it. Will you talk
      to Charian, or shall I? Or shall I arrange for the
      financing outside? I figure I'll need about two hundred
      thousand over and above what I have. Shall I see Charian?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I will. I'll let you know. But I hope you'll change
      your mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Within two days, Dick Pye informed him that Charian and he
      would come in, but would leave their other partners,
      Westwind and Schirovsky, out of it, since their fine
      talents were better suited to criminal law--to the breaking
      and the avoidance of the same--than to country inn-keeping
      and the exploitation of daisies. Pye and Charian had a
      hundred and fifty thousand or so in hand; the other fifty
      thousand could be provided on mortgage.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But we still think you're foolish to start anything so
      half-faced as a little resort hotel like that, and we're
      willing to invest in it only because we believe you're
      competent and dependable. We still want you to think this
      whole business over again,' said Pye, unapprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      And almost as unapproving was Alec Monlux, who quivered,
      'If it should flop, you'd be right out of things here;
      hotel game moves so fast it changes overnight. And I'd of
      thought you'd had enough of associating with the golden rod
      and gophers. I certainly did, in Iowa. I agree with what
      Effie May was arguing: New York is the only place where you
      can rub up against all the big, rich, important guys, and
      keep polished.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, no one approved, beside Gritzmeier and,
      unexpectedly, Jimmy Shanks, the beefily affable manager of
      that Pye-Charian house, The Dickens.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure, it's a swell idea, Myron, and don't let these
      crêpe-hangers tell you anything different,' crowed Jimmy.
      'You'll put it over, and then you'll go on and build
      others, till you have a whole Lake Placid of your own--that
      is, if you want to take the trouble, and I'll bet you
      won't. You'll have too much fun just running a good small
      place with a high-grade clientele and swell grub, and be
      able to call your soul your own and get out and breathe a
      little fresh air and catchum a fish whenever you feel like
      it. Swell idea! Like to do it myself, by golly, instead of
      holding the fevered hands of four hundred stock-brokers
      twenty-four hours a day!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not occur to Myron that Jimmy Shank's enthusiasm
      might be connected with a certain willingness to inherit
      Myron' position, when he should be gone.

    <p>
      He would call it the 'Black Thread Inn'.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would be so wise as not to expect any gratitude from
      Black Thread Centre for bringing them this new industry
      which might employ some scores of natives. He was even
      willing, or so he told himself, to have his old
      schoolmates, who now remembered him so well and whom he had
      so blankly forgotten, scold at him as one who was trying to
      'high-hat' them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just the same, it would be doing something for his boyhood
      home to create there this mould of fashion and glass of
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would be careful not to take any credit, or to
      become boastful if he should succeed in making a
      Grand-Trianon. He'd be the same blunt, unassuming business
      man he'd always been, with no nonsense about trying to be
      imaginative, idealistic, original.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Frigate Haven Manor had, in cottages and main building,
      three hundred and ten bedrooms. That was too large. He
      planned for the Black Thread Inn a hundred and twenty
      bedrooms, and a cottage for himself, at first, with
      situations plotted for a future annex and cottages to
      provide a hundred bedrooms more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastened up to Black Thread to look over his site. It
      was better than he thought. He talked it over with T. J.
      Dingle, the youngish banker of the Centre, who willingly
      said that he would invest $10,000, and with Mrs. Dingle,
      who more than willingly said that when the inn was built,
      Myron could count on Ted and her coming for supper every
      Sunday, 'Get some decent food in this wilderness at last!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tut!' said Dingle. 'It's notorious that New England home
      food is the best in the world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know, my darling. Notorious is right. It's so good that
      they hide it away from you,' said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      All winter, while he was conferring with the architects
      about plans for the Inn, Myron was trying to give Pye and
      Charian a notion of what he was up to, a task rather
      complicated by the fact that he did not entirely know. They
      could not in the least comprehend the idea of a Rose and
      Crown adapted to America of the late 1920's; they pictured
      a bawdy road-house which would be in the country only to be
      safely away from prying federal officers and
      divorce-seeking wives, and possibly for the sake of a
      little golf and swimming to whet the appetite between
      drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, 'Oh, I can handle 'em. They'll get the idea when they
      see the place all furnished. And, of course, I do want it
      to be cheery--only, not dissipated,' insisted Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked out the details of financing the Inn. Pye and
      Charian were generous enough in this gamble, as they would
      have been generous in sending flowers to a bootlegger's
      funeral. They did not object to accepting Myron's Lake
      Nekobee property as the desired site for the Inn, at a
      valuation of $25,000, though it had cost him only $10,000
      when lake sites were cheaper, to granting him 400 extra
      shares in the company for his services in building the Inn
      and assembling the staff, a salary of $12,000 a year and
      living-quarters in an hotel cottage when the Inn should be
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cautiously sold his securities and his small interests
      in the Pye-Charian Company, Frigate Haven Manor, and Laurel
      Farms for slightly over $65,000 which, with the Lake
      Nekobee inn-site appraised at $25,000, gave him $90,000 to
      invest in the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new company was capitalized at $300,000, with 3000
      one-hundred-dollar shares, of which Myron had 1,300, Pye
      and Charian each 800, and T. J. Dingle 100. . . . It was
      true, admitted Myron, that with their 1600 shares together,
      Pye and Charian could outvote Dingle and himself, but what
      did that matter? They'd be so delighted with the way he'd
      build and run the place that they would never interfere,
      and in five or six years, he'd buy them out, and if they
      made a nice piece of change in profit, why, he'd be tickled
      to death--they'd deserve it for being so generous at the
      beginning. Everything rosy!
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual assets, then, were $250,000 of the $300,000, and
      if the stock could be called 'watered' at all, since they
      were allowing for the experience and influence of Myron
      alone, it was only to the extent of $50,000. Myron
      calculated that it would cost $220,000 to build a
      hundred-and-twenty room hotel and lay out the grounds and
      lake shore, and $80,000 for furnishing and equipment and
      losses until they should begin to make a profit. It was
      agreed that they would obtain a $50,000 mortgage, but not
      until the building should be finished. Myron was against
      shoestring methods, and Dick Pye more or less agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Actually, of course, the building, furnishings and reserve
      against loss took $40,000 more than had been expected, and
      the mortgage had to be increased, but their friend and
      adviser, Colonel Ormond L. Westwind, took care of all
      that.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had to train as his successor in the management of
      the Pye-Charian Hotels a newcomer from Chicago. Jimmy
      Shanks, who had hoped for the place and who suspected that
      Myron had advised against him--'which I did, but the damn
      fool has no right to go around <i>saying</i> I did!' Myron
      confided to Alex--was not pleased. But Jimmy was no
      cultured and childish Carlos Jaynes. He was friendlier and
      jollier and more uproarious with Myron than ever, and much
      more dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He had to see the European inns and restaurants before he
      approved the architects' plans or let them build one
      cement-form for the Inn. He had to. He was going to combine
      with American tradition everything in European
      hotel-practice that could be acclimated here. Pye and
      Charian agreed to his taking three months in Europe, in the
      spring of 1926, but at his own expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Europe!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going to Europe! Going to see all its renowned
      historical sights and beauties, such as the Savoy, the
      Embassy Club, the Smithson &amp; Batty Hotel Furnishings
      Co., the Café Royal, Simpson's, the Cheshire Cheese,
      Foyot's, Voisin's, the Paris Ritz and Crillon and Meurice,
      a bottle of Vouvray, Ciro's, the International Wall
      Tapestry Cie., the Chambertin vineyard, the Tour d'Argent,
      the Adlon, the Stephanie, the Frankfort-a-M., Wurst
      Gesellschaft, the Beau Rivage of Lausanne, the Villa
      D'Este, the Albergo Russia of Rome, the Royal Augustan
      Antipasto Exportation Company, the Grand of
      Stockholm--everything in Europe that mattered. He might
      even have time for Westminster Abbey, Napoleon's Tomb,
      Pompeii, and an art gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passionate pilgrimage!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He had his plans quite ready before he told Effie May, on a
      February evening at home in Mt. Vernon. He was jubilant
      about it, and he wound up, 'We'll simply have one whale of
      a good time, to say nothing of learning a whole lot, and if
      you don't want to chase around to all the hotels and so on
      that I'll have to see, you can stay in Paris and Rome.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But she looked doubtful. She did not say 'Won'erful.' She
      hesitated, 'Could we take Luke?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not awfully well, and I don't think he'd enjoy it, moving
      so fast--get pretty tired, a kid of nine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I couldn't leave him for three whole months--more than
      three, with the steamer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'll try to work it out so we can take him, if you
      feel we ought to. He could stay in Paris with you, I guess.
      There's a lot of things he'd enjoy seeing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you want to go, pie?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I guess I do. Europe! But . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw, beyond escape, that she was agitated by the fear of
      losing her familiar security, the fear of the unknown and
      probably hostile. He was wretched. He did not want to draw
      away from her; he had no liking whatever for the
      matrimonial experiments of the day. Experimentation in
      business was enough for him, in which he was not notably
      inferior to the biologists or explorers who flirted with
      every new concept in biology or jungle-piercing but were
      conservative as boiled codfish in religion and politics and
      love. He wanted Europe less for himself than for the
      egotistic utter unselfishness of seizing it in his two
      hands and showing it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you had a great time out of going to Bermuda!' he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I know. But I was young then. And I didn't have any
      responsibilities--a house and a child and all. And . . .
      Oh, probably I'd have a fine time, once I got there and got
      used to it. But your planning to go in just three
      weeks--three weeks--oh, I couldn't possibly get ready as
      quick as that--a trunk and dresses and underclothes and
      reading it up and all--I couldn't do it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, honey, they still sell dresses in the Old Country!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no, no, no! I couldn't do it!' He saw that she was
      becoming actively terrified. 'You run over by yourself, and
      Luke and I will go with you some time when you can make a
      longer stay, and when he's older.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure, sure, lamb, whatever you'd like! Play game of
      pinochle to-night?'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He wouldn't go at all then. Rats! He could get all he
      needed out of books and magazine articles. Just for once,
      he scolded himself, why not do something for Effie--the
      poor kid, buried here with nothing to amuse her!
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not listen to himself. He had to go. He could do no
      other.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He was on the promenade deck of the S.S. <i>Duilio,</i> to
      sail for Naples.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a cry of 'All ashore that's going ashore!' he said
      tremulously to Effie May and Alec Monlux, 'I guess you'll
      have to be getting off. I wish you were going. It won't be
      any fun without you two to cuss and discuss with. Be good,
      you two, and don't take any wooden money. Oh, Lord, I do
      wish you were going! Why don't you just get carried off
      accidentally on purpose? Well, guess you better start!' He
      kissed Effie, not as a husband, as he had done of late
      years, but with a real kiss, overwhelmingly conscious of
      her lips, and fretfully he led her toward the gang-plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered afterward if he hadn't hurried her a bit.
      Still, it was just as well; it was only another half-hour
      before the gang-plank slid across to the pier, cutting off
      America for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great steamer incredibly began to move--only it seemed
      on that steel immensity, that it was the pier that was
      moving. He waved tirelessly to Effie and Alec, standing out
      in the crowd as though they were each of them twice as big
      as the others. He loved them! Who had so understanding a
      wife, so loyal a friend? And it pleased him that good old
      Jimmy Shanks, though he could not stay, had dashed down to
      say good-bye and bring a box of cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the end of the pier was moving backward from the
      steamer. He could not make out Effie and Alec. He was
      suddenly desolated with loneliness, with a fear that he
      would never see them again, with a speculation as to
      whether he was not a fool to leave his familiar work and to
      go thus pretentiously spying into foreign ways that he
      would never understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so lonely that he went to bed early--and slept
      beautifully, for nine hours; his longest sleep, he
      remembered, for he did accurately remember such things,
      since he had been down with the 'flu, before his marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he sent his business card to the chief
      steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the rest of the crossing, he was viewing
      refrigerator-rooms, electric grills, the decoration of the
      suites, the preparation of menus by the chef and chief
      steward, the stewards' quarters, the choice and making of
      the sandwiches for the ten-o'clock evening trays, the
      storage of linen. He was busy and happy, and only
      occasionally did he remind himself that he must be lonely.
      He took time to look at Gibraltar, but he really did not
      have time to look, as he had planned, at the bridge, the
      captain, or the Atlantic Ocean.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He had written to Luciano Mora with a good deal of reserve.
      After all, Luciano wasn't just a Westward room-clerk any
      more, but manager of the lordly Hotel Pastorale in Naples,
      and probably he was nibbled to death by guests whom he had
      known in New York, just as Myron had been pestered by
      clients who, because they had once seen him at Connecticut
      Inn or Tippecanoe Lodge, expected to get a couple of floors
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pleased when Luciano radioed, on the last day out:
      'Keys of Napoli yours shall be at pier.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Passionate Pilgrim entered one of the most beautiful
      harbours of the world and, gaping at the revelation of
      Vesuvius and the amphitheatre of Naples, he meditated,
      'Golly, I knew Europe would be quaint and old and all that,
      but I didn't expect such grand scenery, except maybe in the
      Alps. I wonder if those big white blobs are hotels? Dandy
      situation!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Luciano Mora was not on the pier--he was suddenly and
      mysteriously on the ship, while they were docking, and
      yelping as youthfully as when he had been a baggage-porter
      at the Westward, 'Myron, this is splen-did! I present to
      you Italy! How are Effie and the boy and Alec? It was so
      too bad about old Mark! . . . Luigi! Mr. Weagle's luggage!
      . . . He will see it through the customs and take it to
      your rooms. Come!'
    </p>
    <p>
      (Luciano was the only person in Italy who could master
      Myron Weagle's amusing foreign name. To every one else it
      was 'Mee-ron Vee-ag-ley'.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had expected quantities of quaintness, good food and
      complete inefficiency in the Pastorale. He was a little
      astonished by the English and by the swiftness of the
      porter, who had the baggage in Myron's suite fifteen
      minutes after his arrival; he was astonished by the
      magnificence of Luciano's Isotta-Fraschini car and its
      uniformed chauffeur, by their speed through the streets,
      and later, by their exceeding great speed when Luciano took
      him down to Amalfi and Sorrento. He had always understood
      that only the free and dashing Americanos drove fast; he
      was to learn that any crippled centenarian in Italy, Paris,
      or Germany would feel disgraced if he drove a car at an
      average of less than a hundred kilometres an hour or if he
      regarded a skid as worth noticing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the lobby of the Pastorale too small and, with its
      chairs of yellow satin, too like a drawing-room; he found
      the elevators creaky and much too small. But he was again
      astonished, even a little embarrassed, as though he had
      been caught lying, by the leather-and-marble splendour of
      his suite, the flowers on the occasional tables, and a
      bath-room with a mosaic of nymphs in blue and green and
      pink on a golden ground, and conveniences new even to a
      plumbing-expert like himself. He was astonished at the
      speed with which a floor-waiter appeared when Luciano rang
      for him, astonished at his bowing and murmuring, 'Si,
      Commendatore.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided that Commendatore must be some kind of a title.
      Luciano with a title! Was he a Sir? And do you suppose he
      had the title all the while he was in America, and him so
      chummy and all? And here he was, the director of an hotel
      in which the smallest bedroom was the size of a Waldorf
      ballroom. Pretty nearly. Seemed so, anyway. And yet
      Luciano--'Commendatore'!--he was chattering just like in
      the old days! 'Myron, did you remember the time we sent
      Carlos Jaynes a loffly bottle of Scotch that was filled
      with ginger ale?'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There were vain interludes during which Myron felt that he
      was not learning much, though he shamefully admitted that
      he did enjoy them. Luciano took him to Capri, but they
      spent only a couple of hours on the kitchens and offices of
      the Hotel Quisisana, for Luciano insisted on talking about
      views and on dragging Myron out for a monstrous two-hour
      walk, all up and down hill, to the entirely disorderly and
      useless ruins of a villa or castle or something that had
      belonged to a Roman emperor whom Luciano called 'Timberio'.
      It was kind of interesting to see a floor of tiles which,
      Luciano claimed, was almost two thousand years old, and yet
      scarcely worn. But still! Myron had only three months in
      Europe. And no matter what Luciano said, he didn't remember
      learning in school about an emperor named Timberio. There
      had been Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar and Mark Antony
      and Marcus, or something like that, Aurelius. And Nero, of
      course, who had fiddled while Rome was burning. But no
      Timberio, never. But then, probably it was just a Wop
      translation of some regular name.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the longest walk that Myron took in Europe--or in
      America either, all that decade--unless you counted ten
      miles or so a day through hotel corridors and kitchens.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Luciano gave for him a dinner to all the hotel dignitaries
      in Naples and the neighbourhood--managers and owners and
      chief clerks from the Grand, the Excelsior, Bertolini's,
      the Bristol, Parker's, the Britannique, the Eden, the
      Victoria, the Santa Lucia, the Quisisana. Half of them
      seemed, to Myron's romantic delight, to be Commendatores or
      Cavilieres, and he wondered if a Garden Party at Buckingham
      Palace wouldn't be very much like this--only not so many
      black beards and rotund white waistcoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, sitting between Commendatore Luciano Mora and the owner
      of a pension (which meant a high-class boarding-house) who
      was apparently a Conte (which seemed to be an even higher
      title than Commendatore, though it didn't sound half as
      swell), Myron actually tasted the Animelle di Vitello alla
      Minuta con Tartuffi of which he had read when he was
      meat-cook of the Eagle Hotel, Torrington, Connecticut. The
      gilded plaster cupid on the ceiling of the private
      dining-room quivered to the vehemence with which the mayor,
      no less, shouted that the whole city was humbly honoured to
      greet Meeron Veeagley, who was not only the lifelong friend
      of Commendatore Mora, but the noblest example this season
      of American efficiency and hospitality, and a witness of
      the historic friendship between America and the entirely
      new and improved Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven of them saw him off at the station, and Myron was
      sorry to leave Luciano, and impressed with the porters'
      linguistic skill as he handled the luggage. He spoke
      Italian so rapidly!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He saw, in Italy, Switzerland, France, and England,
      everything that he had longed for as being cultured and of
      good repute. And he saw distinguished small-city
      restaurants--invariably, it seemed, personally conducted by
      that ubiquitous superman, the former chef of the Kaiser--of
      which he had never heard. Having been reliably informed
      that Europe was very small, he was perplexed to find it so
      very large that, with only three months for travel, he was
      able to have only a week in Germany and Austria, and unable
      to see Scotland, Ireland, Scandinavia, Holland, Belgium,
      Spain, Hungary, Poland, or the Balkans at all, though with
      the accurate planning for which he was known in the
      hotel-world, he had designed to do them thoroughly, with
      three full days devoted to Spain alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whew!' he said, as his steamer left Southampton, 'I've got
      enough ideas to last a lifetime! But I won't be sorry to
      get back. I do believe I'm a little tired! . . . Funny how
      many top-notch European hotels have toothpicks right on the
      table!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He spent hours in his cabin, filling up two new volumes of
      'Hotel Project Notes'.
    </p>
    <p>
      He concluded that the European system was better in
      room-service, in the guest's pressing a button instead of
      telephoning, and in having one garçon, who came to know his
      ways, instead of a horde of unfamiliar waiters and
      bellboys. He concluded that the food was as much better as
      had been fabled, because of more time taken in preparation,
      more patience with the processes of even a simple consommé,
      training of a lifetime among cooks and, as to the guests
      themselves, more knowing palates and freedom from the
      superstition that the world will fail if the office is not
      reopened promptly at 2.01 p.m.--though what anybody could
      do about it, in a large American city dining-room, where
      the guests expected to have lunch and dash away in
      twenty-five minutes, he did not see. He liked the
      Continental habit of eating outdoors, in an arbour or on
      the side-walk, whenever it was possible, and this custom he
      would have at the Black Thread Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he vehemently did not, like the professional
      expatriates, believe the worst European inn was better than
      the best American hotel. He had found plenty of bad hotels.
      He had known supercilious porters, managers who never left
      their stinking little offices but hid there always with
      their beards brushing the ledgers, waiters who believed
      that all Americans loved being chummily informed about the
      weather, cashiers who refused to charge a fifty-franc
      telegram on the bill, and bills on which the taxes were
      invariably overcharged, restaurants which had never heard
      of veal, and restaurants in other lands which had never
      heard of anything except veal, bar-keeps who believed that
      ice in a whisky-soda was against all the principles of the
      English Constitution--and also, that the only purpose of
      American visitors was to conform to the principles of the
      English Constitution, English reception-clerks who could
      scarcely endure speaking to a strange guest without an
      introduction by the vicar's aunt and who had to be wooed
      before they would admit that, in a completely untenanted
      inn, there were rooms for rent. French cashiers who went
      hysterical over ten centimes but remained admirably calm
      about a few millions of war-debt and, in no case, even when
      he was a guest, thought much of a son of Uncle Shylock,
      Italian stewards who could not respect anyone who did not
      care to fill up like a balloon on ravioli before beginning
      the real dinner, Swiss clerks who understood that all
      Americans understood that, after the outrageous charges in
      their own country, they were lucky to be able to get a room
      for twelve dollars a day, German and Austrian clerks who
      chuckled, 'In Dollars ist es nur ein Bagatelle',
      caravanserais with original Holbeins and no hot water
      except on Saturdays from 5.30 to 6.17 p.m., hotels with
      marble floors and total absence of heating--generously
      provided as ways of counteracting the tropical temperature
      of 38° Fahrenheit on a March morning, damp napkins,
      Italians who believed that cuttlefish are edible, Germans
      who regarded pig's knuckle as a vegetarian health-food, and
      Englishmen who had the same high opinions of wilted
      lettuce, tripe, and gooseberry tart drowned in custard,
      German guests who despised the French, French guests who
      despised the Italians, Italian guests who despised the
      English, English guests who despised everybody, and
      American guests who despised only all the other Americans,
      but so wholeheartedly as to make up for their narrowness.
      He had quaked in dancing elevators, and been smothered in
      the dust that lay like a model of the Sahara on brocade
      chairs, and been racked on beds stuffed with damp sea-weed.
      And once, though once only, he had found a French hotel
      with a filthy tablecloth, paper napkins, and chicken which
      could have been used for chips to kindle a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it had been the passionate pilgrimage he had prayed
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not forget hotel terraces looking on the Alps and
      the Bay of Naples, nor the salmon at Macon, nor the boiled
      beef with Schnittlauch sauce at Madame Sacher's. But he
      privately jigged as he steamed toward his own native
      varieties of poetry--toward American elevators and
      circulating ice water and telephones that worked, all night
      service, and corn pudding, and adjustable heating and free
      daily papers that <i>were</i> newspapers, and Alpine views
      from thirtieth-story windows, the American belief that
      quick laundry-service did not require special permits from
      the police, and the even more surprising belief that coffee
      should be served hot and should, preferably, be made from
      coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only on the last day of the return crossing was he
      melancholy, as he groaned, 'Good Lord, I knew I forgot
      something! I forgot to see an art gallery!'

    <p>
      Excavations for the Black Thread Inn and its outbuildings
      were begun late in June, 1926. Myron's cottage was ready in
      May, and the Inn formally opened on June 10, 1927. Myron
      gave half his time, during this year, to the Pye-Charian
      Hotel in New York; the other half he divided between
      nagging the builders, and selecting and training his staff,
      which seemed to him rather more important than the
      building.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Pye-Charian organization he took only two
      officers: Clark Cleaver, chief clerk of the Walter Scott,
      for assistant manager and chief clerk of the Inn, and Otto
      Gritzmeier as chef. In so small a place, Otto was an
      extravagance, even though he was willing to come for three
      hundred a year less than he had in the steamy bedlam of the
      Victor Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was happily able to hire his brother, Ora, to write
      publicity during most of the building. He had always felt
      guilty at doing so little for Ora, who just now happened to
      be rather hard up, having lost his job as editor and
      advertising manager of the Hidden Sex Truths Book
      Publishing Company for having offered to teach hidden sex
      truths to the stenographers. Before the Inn opened, Ora
      sold a series of very interesting 'Confessions of a
      Press-Agent' to a muckraking magazine, and was able to take
      a richly deserved rest and trip to Europe, to the
      satisfaction of Myron, who had always regretted that while
      a mere business man like himself had had that opportunity,
      it had hitherto been denied to Ora, with his splendid
      knowledge of history and literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      As permanent press-agent and 'host' of the Inn, Myron hired
      Benny Rumble, hotel-news correspondent of <i>Smart
      Mart.</i> He did not like Benny, a dapper little young man
      with a smirk and clothes too well-fitted around the hips,
      given to dancing, bridge, poetic quotations, and
      rose-tipped cigarettes, but Dick Pye insisted that Benny
      would be just the lad to entertain the old ladies at the
      Inn, and absolutely safe with the young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head waiter was to be Frank Rabatel of the Restaurant
      Cocarde, Philadelphia; the hotel detective--always known as
      'hotel dick'--was Dutch Linderbeck from the Fishkill House
      of Albany, who was said to know more politicians more
      gloomily than even the Capitol janitor. For a
      hundred-and-twenty-room hotel, a detective was not
      necessary, but Myron wanted to protect the wealthy guests
      he was presumably going to have against every manner of
      confidence-man and fake Russian prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      A yet greater extravagance was the veteran floor-waiters.
      His whole scheme of superior service would fail if guests,
      when they rang the bell, were answered by the amiable but
      untrained college students on vacation who were the
      bellboys and waiters in most summer hotels. The experienced
      guest wanted the bell answered by an initiate, to whom the
      procuring of coffee, stamps, aspirin or wrapping paper and
      cord, was a passionate duty.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For a month before the opening, Myron and his lieutenants
      drilled the kitchen staff, the waiters and bus-boys, the
      desk-clerks and bell-boys and telephone-girls and porters,
      and even the cigar-and-candy-stand girl, and when the last
      was offended at the suggestion that there was anything she
      could learn, Myron was pleased at having it happen so
      early, and hired another young lady. The chambermaids had
      blue-prints of what ought to be done in every room every
      day; precisely what must daily be swept, dusted. They were
      dragooned as thoroughly as chorus-girls--though they were
      expected to be more charming than chorus-girls during
      working-hours and considerably less so after hours. The
      whole Inn would open as smoothly as though it had been
      running for five years. Myron did not remember it, but he
      was carrying out vows he had made amid the deliriums of
      Tippacanoe Lodge, twenty years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      His chief trouble in organizing the staff was in refusing
      the offers of Black Threaders whom he had known as boys. He
      would have hated himself had he been supercilious to men
      with whom he had once smoked cornsilk cigarettes in the
      livery stable; he was uncomfortably and almost too noisily
      cordial when they came poking about the rising walls of the
      Inn; but he tried to persuade them that their training in
      the railroad section gang or the clothes-pin factory or the
      shoe store hadn't really qualified them as to clerk in an
      expensive hotel, an occupation which they pictured as doing
      nothing all day long but wearing lovely new tail-coats and
      shaking hands and swapping dirty stories with fashionable
      guests. Myron heard, seven times a day, 'Sure, I know:
      you've gotten too good for your old friends. Your hat has
      got too small for you, since you went off to the City.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He explained to himself, 'Anybody with the intelligence of
      a rabbit would have known that I was a fool to start this
      thing too near the old home town. You aren't very bright,
      Myron. You work hard, but you haven't got much intuition or
      inspiration. That's what Ora's told me, all along. Oh, damn
      Ora! Now, the old bunch here in the Centre will want me to
      fail. Oh well, damn them, too! Nobody can stop me, nothing
      can stop me, from making this the greatest success in the
      world! I'll have Vanderbilts begging for a reservation a
      year ahead!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in such a mood of boastful depression that he
      determined to get even with the Fates by raising the
      minimum rate-per-day, room and meals, from twelve to
      fifteen dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      His old acquaintances, who remembered him so much more
      lovingly than seemed probable after twenty-eight years,
      continued to come around and, when he was most trying to be
      affectionate and very jokey, they drawled, 'Now don't try
      to pull any high-hat stuff on <i>me!</i> I knew you when
      you was emptying slops at the American House!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had some thirty local workmen employed in building, and
      when the Inn opened, he would use as many people from Black
      Thread as showed themselves willing to keep their shoes
      blacked and endure strict training. But he saw that to one
      faction he must forever continue to be an ingrate who
      'pulled high-hat stuff'.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cheer up', said T. J. Dingle; 'consider what they think of
      <i>me,</i> the blood-sucking banker!'
    </p>
    <p>
      His father was a trial. He was a case of hives. Not that
      old Tom ever bothered him by presenting his qualifications
      for working at the Inn. Tom was entirely satisfied with his
      present two hours a day of supervising the American House
      clerk. But he did come over to Lake Nekobee to tell the
      workers that he was Myron's dad and had taught Myron all he
      knew, and to direct them in their building. All that, Myron
      could settle easily enough. He set his mother on Tom and
      thereafter his father stayed home, grumbling to all guests
      whom he could persuade to listen that a serpent's tooth is
      nothing at all compared with a thankless child, and that
      throughout Myron's youth, half a century or so, he had
      risen at five daily to instruct his ungrateful son in every
      art of inn-keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Myron's mother was beatific. Now, as the Black Thread
      Inn advanced, she knew absolutely, where formerly she had
      only suspected, that her son was the greatest hotel-man the
      world had ever known, and late afternoons, guiltily leaving
      the supervision of supper at the American House to the
      second cook, she walked arm in arm with Myron about the
      scaffolding-covered walls, while he triumphantly showed the
      future terrace, sun-porch, cabañas, squash court.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, Professor Herbert Lambkin, B.A., M.A., was the
      worst pest of all. The moment Myron began to build, Herbert
      charged in with suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron must come stay with them at the Old Home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks no. Myron was perfectly comfortable at the American
      House. Besides. He had to be in New York so much--only
      spent a few nights at the Centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, look here, then. Did Myron remember that conceited
      fool, Monlux, who had offered Herbert a miserable thirty a
      week in New York? Herbert had always been pretty sore about
      that, and he didn't entirely absolve Myron from blame, and
      now was Myron's chance to make up for the insult. He,
      Herbert, as superintendent of schools, was free in the
      summer time, just when Myron would most need him in the
      Inn, and he would be willing to sink his social prestige
      and serve as assistant manager for seventy-five or eighty a
      week, and then he thought he might bring himself to forgive
      Monlux, Myron, Effie, and Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      No . . . Myron was so sorry . . . But he had already chosen
      his whole staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was only the beginning of happy talks between the
      brothers-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron reported it to Effie May, in Mt. Vernon, but for once
      she did not back him. 'Why, I think that's real mean of
      you! It would mean so much to Berty to have the job; it
      would please him like anything, and I think it's horrid
      giving all these dandy jobs to complete strangers when our
      own family need them!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He isn't trained--he hasn't the temperament--he'd make
      lots of trouble', Myron said feebly. But he was
      considerably less feeble when he returned to Black Thread
      and Herbert again pounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Herbert granted that if Myron would build a summer
      cottage for him and let him have it for the cost of
      electricity and telephone only, he would forgive Myron to a
      considerable extent and try to forget his origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in Mt. Vernon again, Myron suffered with a pity for
      her that was purest love when Effie May cried, 'Listen,
      duckie! If you'll give Herbert the job, like he wants, I'll
      turn in and help you, with ideas! I've been thinking them
      up all this week you've been gone. Listen! This would be
      just won'erful! Why not have a great big picnic ground,
      with big rustic tables, and get all the Sunday Schools for
      miles around to have their basket picnics there every
      summer! Of course you couldn't charge them, but it would
      make the Inn grounds so lively, and advertise the place
      like anything!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And the question of liquor, that to any hotel project in
      1926 was a sick headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron had planned space for a bar in the basement
      billiard-room of the Inn, and he intended, if Prohibition
      should be repealed, to have the best cellar in the State.
      He did not expect to interfere with guests who brought
      their own flasks, and were not too noisy. But on the other
      hand he would not sell any illicit liquor, nor permit any
      employee to sell it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Everett Beasy came to him, and Mr. Everett Beasy
      was the sheriff of the county. He did not resemble the
      sheriffs of fiction; he had neither chin-whiskers combined
      with shrewdness in finding which tramp had fired the barn,
      nor a leather vest and a notched six-gun. He had been a
      respectable grocer, and he still looked like a respectable
      grocer: a small man in a well-pressed pepper-and-salt suit
      and a new derby.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Weagle, fine thing for the whole country round here,
      your putting up this big hotel. Give work to lots of needy
      folks, and set an example of nice living for all our young
      people.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Glad you like it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You bet we like it. You're a real public benefactor. And
      now listen. I know how it is. You're going to have a lot of
      city folks that will want a little drink. Mostly, of
      course, that's against the law, but we don't feel disposed
      to be too hard on folks that will bring good money here, as
      long as they behave themselves and don't kick up any rows.
      If they mind their business, we'll mind ours. But of course
      you want to be able to give 'em first-class stuff that you
      can guarantee. Now myself, I'm against booze, and I never
      touch a drop, hardly, you might say, but I know a fellow
      that's a really honest bootlegger . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shan't need one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look here. I don't know as we can allow anybody supplying
      you that we can't depend on. We officers of the law have
      got a responsibility to the public, let me tell you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I shan't sell any liquor at all. Really. I mean it.
      Not a drop'.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, you will! You don't think you will, but you will!
      And if you deal with the right people, it'll save you a lot
      of trouble in taxes and building-inspection and any fights
      that drunk guests might get into and traffic charges and
      all sorts of things. I just want to help you out. Think it
      over, and when you get ready, I'll have this fellow I know
      come see you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It took Myron a time to believe that Sheriff Beasy's honest
      friend was also Sheriff Beasy, and that a country political
      gang could be as intimidating as any city gang in
      compelling him to handle illicit booze whether he wanted to
      or not. He thought of Beasy's hard little eyes. He thought
      of the Inn being raided on a gay and prosperous evening. He
      shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      By contrast he almost had relief in the details of
      insurance. He had, it appeared, to insure against injury to
      employees, injury to the public, fire, lightning, burglary,
      floods, earthquakes, cyclones, termites, elephantiasis,
      insurrection, and the Acts of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      In seeking the righteousness of creation he had not, he
      saw, altogether freed himself from the body of sin and
      doubt. Yet irritated or apprehensive or dreary with
      details, he was, all this tiring and glorious time,
      uplifted by the sight of the rising Inn, the actual coming
      into existence of his masterpiece.

      To make an inn that should be not merely good but near
      perfection, Myron asserted, he had to be fussy as an
      old-time housewife at spring-cleaning. He had to make
      himself an expert equally on the plan of the building in
      regard to convenience, quiet, light, and view, on the
      furnishing of bedrooms and public rooms, on food, linen,
      silver, china, glass, on amusements outdoors and inside. In
      any one of these departments, the Black Thread Inn might be
      surpassed; it was his job, as creative builder, to make
      sure that no other inn should surpass his in the
      combination of all the details.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day, when he was not at Black Thread, he was consulting
      interior decorators, salesmen for hotel china and glass,
      books on furniture and, always, the realistic and
      experienced Mr. Otto Gritzmeier.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to decoration, he was for awhile tempted by the heathen
      ritual of Modernism, particularly after he had lunched at
      the Tall Town Club, the best speakeasy in New York, which
      had been bedizened by Josef Lazaraki with a circular bar of
      black glass edged with a silver band, bright aluminium bar-
      stools with red leather seats, pictures made with outlines
      of silver wire against a powdery blue background, walls
      splashed with sunbursts and torch-flames of aluminium, and
      sunflowers whose petals were mirrors, Myron was impressed.
      Prohibition, he realized, had been an excellent thing for
      America: it had not only taught the traditionally
      unalcoholic American woman to drink and smoke with her men,
      but had, in its freedom from old standards, encouraged the
      arousing orgies of modernistic decoration, and all
      citizens, especially the surprised and delighted women,
      ought to be grateful to the Methodist and Baptist shepherds
      who had brought on Prohibition. But for his inn among New
      England hills, this jazz splendour would be false, and
      Myron was equally uninterested in the other extreme: an
      Olde Inne that should be a Colonial museum, with huge and
      dirty brick fireplaces bristling with sooty cranes,
      straight-backed oak chairs, and walls so prickly with
      warming-pans, candle-moulds, revolutionary muskets,
      grandfather clocks, wedgwood platters, grimy iron pots, and
      Currier &amp; Ives prints that any honest guest would dash
      out shrieking. He decided on a key-note of Duncan Phyfe
      mahogany in accurate reproductions, graceful for summer,
      warm-hued for winter fire-light, and he was able to have
      all of it made together by one manufacturer, at a
      comfortingly reasonable price. He was able to get standard
      yet not too familiar patterns of glassware, china, and
      silver which harmonized with the mahogany. They were all
      marked with the BTI embroidered on the linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even the lounge, centre of the Inn, was planned so
      carefully as the kitchens, and these were planned to the
      last centimeter, as though he were devising a new motor
      engine. In everlasting headachy conferences with
      Gritzmeier, after reading everything he could find in the
      hotel magazines, he arranged exactly what and how long
      should be the path from refrigerator to work-table to
      condiment cupboard to stove to serving-bar to dining-room;
      what materials were best for sinks, for table-tops, floors
      and the weary swollen feet of cooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Food he studied as Duke Godfrey studied the imaginative
      maps to the Holy Land. Gritzmeier was one of the
      not-too-many Continental chefs who had added a study of
      native American foods to his knowledge of French and German
      and British cookery. As piously as Myron he revered the
      American dishes which would be the staples of this good
      provincial inn: clam chowder, planked shad with roe,
      crab-flakes, canvas-back with wild rice and black currant
      jelly, raisin pie, corn pones, pepper pot, and the
      breakfast doughnuts and waffles and buckwheat cakes which
      can be so delicate or so leaden, in accordance as the cook
      is a worthy man or a scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      To 'amusements' he gave scientific research. He had noticed
      that the chief horror of summer hotels in the evening, when
      it is too dark for golf and swimming, is that there is
      nothing to do. He would have either dancing or a movie, or
      both, every evening, along with radio, backgammon, dice
      racing, masquerades, a larger library, moonlight
      picnic-suppers, billiards, and a chief job of Benny Rumble
      would be to introduce poker-players and bridge-maniacs to
      one another.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The first building to be finished, in May, was Myron's
      cottage, which was to be the start of a whole crescent of
      hotel cottages on the hillside above the Inn. He had
      planned it himself, more precisely than any known
      housewife, with everything built in that could be built in,
      with composition floors that could be cleaned with a look,
      and enough sleeping-porch space for his family and for a
      guest . . . only he hoped that the guest would not too
      constantly be Professor Herbert Lambkin, M.A.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was May 27th, 1927, just two weeks before the day set
      for the opening, and the Black Thread Inn was finished--at
      least as nearly finished as it would be, this season--and
      Myron could look upon his Works, bound in grey shingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inn fitted into the hillside. It was rather long and
      low, with wide dormers in the third story. The sides were
      finished in fire-proofed shingles, stained the soft grey of
      the sunless lake, with the shingled roof a little darker,
      and under the eaves was one violent band of scarlet. A
      terrace of red tiles was cut in under the building, on the
      ground floor, and extended outside along the whole length
      of the front, with French windows opening on it, with white
      wicker chairs and white-painted steel tables. Here lunch
      and tea were to be served on bright days. At one end was an
      untouched grove of elms and maples; at the other end was
      planted a garden of roses, peonies, and autumnal lilies,
      where tea would also be served when the garden should have
      grown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tennis-courts, the squash-courts, the stables of
      riding-horses, the garage, with titanic buses to meet the
      trains, were tucked among the woods behind the Inn, and
      here, next winter, would be a ski-slide and possibly a
      toboggan course. Golf was available at the Olde Mill
      Country Club, four miles away, and at three other clubs
      within eight miles. Some day, the Inn would have a
      nine-hole course of its own. Myron had insisted on laying
      out, on one of the lawns, croquet-grounds, though every one
      in the world, practically, rushed up to assure him that
      croquet was dead. There was to be a swimming-pool, warmed,
      for early spring and late autumn, when the lake would be
      too cold, but as yet there was only the excavation for the
      pool. It would be finished in the fall. The sandy lake
      shore was kaleidoscopic as the Riviera, with a huge
      T-shaped dock, four diving-boards, yellow and crimson
      canoes, row-boats with blue and crimson awnings, and
      cabañas with awnings grey and crimson. Only the beach was
      garish, however; the Inn itself was tranquil.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' grumbled Tom Weagle, 'it's all right, but strikes
      me it's a pretty simple shack to be making such a fuss
      over! Why didn't you make one of these French chateaux, or
      a Japanese garden, or something with class?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I planned it to be simple. I want it to fit in between the
      lake and the hill as if it had grown here, and still have
      as much luxury as the Ritz,' protested Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's simple, all right! It just growed, all right! It
      certainly don't look like any good 220,000 bucks to me.
      What I could have done with that money, with <i>my</i>
      experience! Built you an hotel that'd bat you in the eye
      ten miles off. Just growed here on the hill is right! Like
      a doggone ole grey stump! After all the pains I've spent on
      you, I've never been able to learn you it pays to
      advertise!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      June tenth, then, and the publication of the Perfect Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was opening with every bedroom full save one, and that
      empty only because it was held for Adolph Charian, Pye's
      partner, who might or might not be able to come from New
      York for the ceremonies. Dick Pye would be there all week.
      Myron had had to reject more than sixty applications for
      rooms. He had captured for the first five days of the
      opening the convention of that extremely wealthy
      organization, the New England Brass Industries Institute.
      Benny Rumble, the natty press-agent, had lavishly invited
      the press to the opening of what he asserted to be the
      finest inn on the Atlantic Coast, and fifteen rooms were
      reserved for reporters from New York, Philadelphia, Boston,
      New Haven, Hartford, Bridgeport, and Greenwich, who did not
      mind submitting a few sticks to the society editors so long
      as the food and Benny's private stock were good. The other
      rooms were taken by a miscellany of regular guests, who
      drove up in expensive cars, well stocked with gin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening evening!
    </p>
    <p>
      The lobby and corridors at last whooped with voices besides
      those of the workmen and hotel staff, and Myron beamed
      owlishly as he heard, 'It's a charming place.' Everything
      began joyfully, with two big dinners--that of the Brass
      Institute, served in the Ballroom and entertained by the
      Jolly Rovers Jazz Orchestra, and the dinner for the press,
      in one end of the dining-room, which could be completely
      shut off by an electrically controlled screen of steel and
      rubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Myron took three cocktails, that evening: one in his
      cottage, with Effie May and Ora, who was their guest for
      the week; one with Benny Rumble and the press; one in the
      suite of the secretary of the Brass Institute. He was
      slightly hysterical with the success of his masterpiece.
      The Institute insisted on his joining them for a toast, and
      when its president stated (but not so briefly) that Mr.
      Weagle was another of those enterprising Yankees who was
      restoring New England to her former supremacy in industry
      and the resort business, and to hell with California, Myron
      bowed and flushed and felt very happy--and was suddenly a
      little homesick for a hotel in Naples and a black-bearded
      man toasting Signor Veeagley, while Luciano clapped his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He himself dined, when he was not darting away to do most
      energetically nothing in particular, with a group composed
      of the press, the county and town dignitaries, his father
      and mother, Effie and Ora, the Dingles, and the entire
      Lambkin clan. It was a lovely dinner, with Moselle, bombe
      surprise, and brook-trout. It was addressed. It was a good
      deal addressed, though the press seemed not to mind, since
      1909 brandy was served during the addressing. Myron told
      them, in a speech lasting exactly seventy seconds, that he
      was glad to see them. Dick Pye told them that Myron was a
      second George Boldt. T. J. Dingle told them that Black
      Thread had quantities of history and fishing. The mayor of
      Black Thread made a comic speech, Sheriff Everett Beasy
      made a witty speech, and then the real work was turned over
      to Pye's partner, Colonel Ormond L. Westwood, who was
      historic, comic, witty, impressively reverent regarding the
      church, the state, the press, and hotel-keeping, and wound
      up with one of his celebrated after-dinner stories which
      managed to be so delicate that it did not shock the ladies
      and yet so smutty that even the reporters laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not break up till midnight, when the guests swayed
      up to their rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, the opening evening was as nearly perfect as
      the Inn itself.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He was too happily excited to go back to his cottage and
      sleep. At half-past one he made the round of the Inn, just
      for the pleasure of seeing it. He looked upon his work and
      saw that it was good . . . The passionate pilgrim come to
      his shrine. The poet reading the first typescript of his
      epic, astonished by his own eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one about save a watchman somewhere in the
      building, and the night-clerk in the office, working on
      accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      These glories he noted again:
    </p>
    <p>
      The office, near the main door, though it was complete in
      every trick of telautograph and pneumatic chute, was not
      large, and it did not intrude on the lounges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main lounge was furnished in old maple, with a moulded
      plaster fireplace, and pine panelling and authentic old
      pine, for which Myron had sent a man searching Connecticut,
      studiously examining old barns, even fence-rails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever any guest might think of the excellence of Myron's
      Inn, he would have to admit that the main lounge did not
      have a single rustic rocker of unpeeled boughs, or a single
      cart-wheel candelabrum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second room was the radio lounge, sound-proofed, so
      that radio-fans might have as loud a speaker as they
      wanted, yet no one outside the room need listen. The third
      was the writing-room and library, with all known varieties
      of magazines, and three thousand books, chosen by a
      librarian and not by Ora, since Myron suspected that
      nothing would so much please Ora as to include every bawdy
      novel calculated to shock respectable guests. The
      dining-room was in moulded plaster, slightly tinted, with
      heavy mulberry-coloured curtains. The ballroom, on one side
      of the hotel, became by day a huge sun-room. In the
      basement was a clubroom for billiards, pool, cards, with
      another and more feminine card-room on the second floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, if there's any prettier public rooms anywhere, in
      America <i>or</i> Europe, than those seven, I'd just like
      to know!' said Myron now, content.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Charian had not been able to come, there was one bedroom
      which he could inspect, and he entered it, snapped on the
      light, happily. As pleasant to him as the Sheraton
      furniture were the candlewick spread on the four-poster,
      and the thick, faintly peach-coloured Bridgewater blankets.
      To him, a fine wool blanket had always been lovely as a
      sunset. The fireplace was of mahogany, painted white, with
      a deep chair before it. The curtains were cretonne, and the
      two, only two, pictures were German colour-prints. The
      whole room was gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why should it be supposed in a country inn that there will
      never be any wet, gloomy days when the guests will keep to
      their rooms, and so any old dark furniture and brindle
      walls will do?' inquired Myron, not without self-approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bathroom was in white tiles with canary-yellow floor
      and ceiling border. It was bright yet not too orchidaceous,
      though it had been decorated at a period when America had
      been roused to a mania for wildly coloured bathrooms,
      stoves, stew-pans, typewriters, even toilet paper. They had
      all to be in pink or lavender, and a citizen who had to
      endure any article in white or brown was ashamed, and
      staggered away from the scorn of friends, a broken man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though at hotel-association meetings Myron had attacked a
      superfluity of accessories in rooms, and in particular the
      profusion of little cards advertising the meals, the
      courtesy, and other desirabilities of the hotel, in this
      bedroom there were many dodges--conceivably too many:
      bedside lights, of course, a box opening into both the room
      and the corridor, so that shoes and suits might be taken
      off for cleaning without disturbing the guest, extra
      folding chairs and baggage-stands ready in the closet,
      stacks of towels and washrags, shoe-cloths and cloths for
      wiping razor blades, a full-length mirror, an electric
      light in the closet, a desk that was not a rickety table
      but a real and solid desk, with ample stationery and a
      supply of free picture post-cards, which would presumably
      advertise the inn. The chambermaids were ordered to make
      sure that there was a low table beside each easy chair, and
      in each room, always, at least three ash-trays--and more if
      it proved that the guest was a conscientious smoker.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were other gadgets less common: A scale with the
      dial flush with the bathroom floor, for guests anxious
      about daily increase of weight. An electric door-bolt,
      controlled by tiny levers beside the bed. A package of
      cigarettes free in the morning, and fruit brought in every
      evening when the bed was turned down. A device which Myron
      had discovered in Switzerland and in which he poetically
      rejoiced: an automatic electrical arm-clock for morning
      calls. When he went to bed, the guest plugged in at the
      desired rising hour, and in the morning the alarm rang
      until he turned it off. There was thus no argument with the
      desk as to the time at which the guest had asked to be
      called, nor did the telephone girls go mad from trying to
      call forty rooms simultaneously at seven-thirty and eight
      and eight-thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      And by each bed were three buttons, for chambermaid,
      bell-boy, and room-waiter--though if the guest considered
      it a patriotic principle to telephone to room-service, he
      could do so. There was a breakfast kitchen on each floor,
      and no charge for meals in rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have been glad, had he thought about it, that Ora
      was not with him on his tour. Ora would have remarked that
      the colours of blankets and of bathroom tiles, the number
      of ash-trays in a bedroom, and the convenience of Swiss
      automatic clocks were, judiciously considered, perhaps the
      most ludicrously unimportant details in the world, at least
      to one who gave earnest attention to such really important
      matters as whether, in a Western, it is sweeter to begin
      with a murder, a rodeo, or the arrival of the grouchy old
      ranchman's niece at Helenhighwater Forks.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There were yet other rare delights for Myron to gloat upon,
      and in particular the kitchen, with its stainless steel and
      surfaces of copper and nickel alloy, its cork floor, its
      charcoal and electric grills. He was, to his wonder,
      hungry, and realized that he had been too excited at
      dinner-time to eat even fresh brook trout. With a visage of
      solemn beatitude, a look of happy childishness uncommon in
      so plodding an adult, he sat at the end of a work table,
      admiring a steam cooker and sucking up soda crackers and
      milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended by the back stairs to the basement, stopping
      to admire the particularly large and numerous
      fire-extinguishers which he had planted all over the Inn.
      Huh! How many ghastly times it had happened that hotels had
      burned down on the very night of their opening! Nothing
      could happen to <i>his</i> inn! For he had taken pains--he
      had trained the staff before opening, he had provided all
      these fire extinguishers, he had proven that, by
      thoughtfulness and care, a man could make his handiwork
      perfect!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the basement he gazed reverently on the oil furnaces,
      the laundry machinery, the store-rooms, the tile-and-marble
      barber-shop, the club room with its billiard tables, and
      then slowly, wearily, most triumphantly happy, he clumped
      up the front stairs from the basement to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard a clamour. He hastened his step and in the
      entrance-hall he found the night-clerk, and Dutch
      Linderbeck, the hotel detective, listening to the night
      watchman, who was shouting, waving his arms. Alarmed guests
      were coming down the stairs, led by the president of the
      Brass Institute, in dressing-gown, and a sharp young
      Bridgeport reporter in top-coat over his pyjamas.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it? What is it?' raged Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They're not married!' said Linderbeck. 'They're not Mr.
      and Mrs. Wood of Springfield, as they registered. The
      fellow is the son of U.S. Senator Colquhoun, and apparently
      she's Mardie Paxton, that professional alimony hound.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But my God, what of it? Why all this damn fool row?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because they're dead! Looks like he shot her, and then
      killed himself. Anyway, they're dead as Moses. Shall I
      'phone the sheriff, Boss, or will you? My managers have
      always said I did a good job on 'phoning the cops when a
      couple mess up an hotel room with blood.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c29" id="c29">29</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron fled up the stairs to Room 97, followed by Dutch
      Linderbeck, a growing push of frightened guests--and
      fifteen newspaper reporters, charmed that they had been
      invited to stay the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mardie Paxton, a celebrated habituée of roadhouses, lay on
      the bed in 97, blood on the breast of her scant silk
      nightgown. The son of Senator Colquhoun was lurched down in
      a flowery new armchair by the clean, white, new fireplace,
      and his right temple was torn away, and blood had slavered
      on chair and hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What proof you got they're who you say?' the oldest New
      York reporter demanded of Dutch Linderbeck.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here's letters to both of 'em, from their baggage, and the
      young fellow's address-book. Look here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'God, it's a lulu of a story! Senator Colquhoun is the old
      gink that was always protecting the domestic hearth against
      naughty films and books!' exulted the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Myron, impersonally, not very loud, 'Yes, it's a good
      story for the reporters. A front-page story. And it's the
      end of my Inn! On the opening night!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say, Weagle, can I use that statement?' shrieked the
      youngest of the reporters, who a fortnight ago had been
      covering nothing more journalistic than piles of gents'
      suitings at closing-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh <i>God!'</i> said the other reporters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron ordered, 'Will all of you except the staff and the
      newspaper-men kindly return to your rooms? There is nothing
      you can do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The blanket-shawled guests glared at him, but he pushed
      them back, closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You stand here at the door and keep everybody out,' he
      ordered Dutch Linderbeck.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, but . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes but <i>hell!</i> Do what I tell you! I always did hate
      yes-butters!' stormed Myron. 'Everybody out of this
      corridor, right now! And you reporters, I'll have the two
      'phone girls out of bed immediately, and you can all put in
      your calls to your papers from your own rooms.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want to see the letters these two bozos had in their
      stuff,' said the oldest reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When the sheriff gets here, he'll decide whether you can
      or not. I certainly won't let you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You look here, Weagle! If you want us to give you a break
      . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The only break you boys could give me would be to revoke
      this Act of God, and I don't believe even the press could
      do that! Beat it, everybody! Out of this hall! Beat it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the end of the corridor, looking toward the
      stairs down to the office. He ought, he felt, to be doing
      something. All his life, whenever he had been in distress,
      he had been able to bounce to his stove or silver-closet or
      desk and importantly do things. And now he could see
      nothing to do, save look from the stairs to Dutch
      Linderbeck, on guard, and back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Pye was marching up stairs, leisurely, completely
      dressed--except that he had forgotten his trousers. He
      yawned, 'Well, Weagle, I hear we've had bad luck. Glad you
      were around, to stop any panic.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know. I don't think I was so good!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What the devil! Don't sound so guilty! You didn't kill
      'em--or did you?--not that I care much!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, but I wish I had, before they got here and registered.
      Why is it that almost every swine who wants to commit
      suicide gets so much pleasure out of ruining the business
      of some innocent hotel-man? Swine!' Then Myron laughed. 'I
      thought I'd open this place right. I'm a good deal of a
      fool, Pye. Ever notice it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes. I notice it about most people. That's an
      hotel-man's first job. I think the Lord God must in His
      omnipotent way be a little like the head of a big
      hotel-chain. Well, if our guests are good and safely dead,
      I think I'll go back to sleep. Good night, son--you're all
      right--don't worry one second--you've got Dolph Charian and
      me behind you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes? And doing what?' muttered Myron, as Pye swaggered
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes Sheriff Everett Beasy was running upstairs,
      followed by a deputy, in private life a garageman, and by a
      Black Thread doctor. Myron turned them over to Dutch
      Linderbeck and staggered down to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gritzmeier, the chef, stopped him there. 'Heard about it,
      Chief. Doesn't matter. Everybody'll forget it in two weeks.
      Look. I knew you'd be worried, and I've made you a cup of
      coffee, myself. Come out to the kitchen and drink it. Do
      you good.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thanks. Terribly good of you, but I couldn't touch a
      thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, you can, Chief!' Gritzmeier chuckled. 'Here!' From
      under the shelter of the office desk he whisked a highball.
      Myron drained it and, 'Yes! That does feel better. Good
      night, and thanks!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He wavered, in a trance, across the gardens to his own
      cottage. He could do no more. Suddenly all strength and
      patience and desire had gone clean out of him, and he was
      more dead than that smashed boy sunk in the armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a quarter of three, but there were lights in his
      cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Effie, poor kid! I wonder what blazing fool woke her up to
      tell her? She'll be all busted up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard music. When he swayed into the cottage
      living-room, Effie May was at the mechanical player-piano,
      producing the popular ballad, 'Don't you worry, little pet.
      Hey you kid, I'll get you yet. Life is all a bed of roses,
      when wise guys like us rub noses.' Leaning against the
      player-piano, waving a gin fizz, was Ora, grinning laxly
      while he sang the pretty thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'For God's sake stop that abomination!' snapped Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora protested, 'What the hell's the matter with you? Have
      you always got to be glum, even on the opening night of
      your ole Inn?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Opening--and closing. Son of a U.S. Senator killed himself
      and his mistress.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shot himself?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good Lord! Good <i>Lord!</i> Why didn't you send over and
      let me know? Oh, I could murder you for being so
      thoughtless! Why didn't you let me know, early? I've never
      seen a man that's just been killed. I could've made a swell
      short story out of it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Effie May who was turning on Ora: 'Shut up, will
      you! Oh, Myron, my poor lamb, with the Inn that you loved
      so!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She held him, and his head rested on her bosom. He felt
      safe again. But in his daze he did not know that it was on
      Effie May's breast that he had found refuge. He thought
      that it was the breast of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He was just nerving himself to go up to bed when a ring
      sent him weaving to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benny Rumble, the little press-agent, was on the step,
      panting, 'They just told me about the tragedy! It's awful!
      Why, it'll just ruin my reputation to be mixed up with a
      place where things like that happen! Couldn't you tell
      everybody that I quit yesterday, before it happened? Oh!
      What Mrs. Van Gittels will say I can't conceive!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Myron slept till ten in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was late enough for him to learn, when he went across
      to the Inn, that the Brass Institute had already voted to
      cut its convention short, that the president of the
      Institute had fled, and that most of the other guests were
      going that afternoon.

    </p>
    <p>
      'Boniface Myron Weagle strode the floor of the Royal Suite,
      whisky &amp; soda in hand. "Let's drink a toast to my new
      hotel, the Black Thread (Conn.) Inn, the best lil ole inn
      in the world," he indicated. Tycoon B. F. Vince, president
      &amp; founder of the Brass Institute, price-fixing and
      high-talk-slinging organization of Yankee
      pot-manufacturers, answered, "Brother, I'm with you". The
      six magnates present, and Mine Host Weagle, drank jovially.
      It was four o'clock on the morning of June 11th, after a
      successful opening of the Inn. As they swung into "For He's
      a Jolly Good Fellow," they heard a pistol shot &amp;
      another. They stopped, aghast. It was merely an incident of
      conducting a successful roadhouse, however. Nothing had
      happened save that the motor-boat-racing only son of Former
      United States Senator Burnside Farragut Colquhoun (pron.
      Cahoon), celebrated advocate of the Christian virtues, had
      murdered self &amp; lady, Cinemactress Paxton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Denizens of Black Thread Centre, small agricultural centre
      on the Housatonic River, do not know the name of their own
      town. They assume that its present designation refers to
      some imaginary textile mill once producing black mourning
      stuffs for unfortunate widows of Mexican &amp; Civil Wars.
      The name should be Black Threat. It was historically a
      black threat to early Connecticut settlers, when it was an
      Indian encampment, and apparently it is now a more serious
      black threat to young motor-racers seeking a refuge for
      self &amp; lady.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The tabloid newspapers had little text but many pictures,
      showing the actual site of the tragedy, with the
      corpses--as obligingly posed by a male and a female cinema
      extra, in a room at the Gaiety Hotel on Broadway. They also
      were able, through the process of combining two pictures,
      to show the terrace of the Black Thread Inn crowded with
      chorus-girls in negligible bathing-suits; and they had
      dozens of views of Myron, Effie May, and Luke together. For
      days Myron was driving photographers out of the shrubs
      about his cottage. And it was one of the tabloid papers
      which gave to the Inn the name of 'Murder Tavern'.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      On the noon after the murder, when the bodies had been
      taken away and Myron had already sent scrubwomen and
      painters to redecorate Number 97, Sheriff Beasy amiably
      called upon Myron in his office, and brought Dutch
      Linderbeck in with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, my boy, this whole affair has certainly been tough!
      Little did we think, when we were having a good lively time
      with the newspaper boys just last evening, that anything
      like this would happen! I tell you, my boy, it certainly is
      a lesson about how little we know what Fate has in store
      for us! Yessir, it certainly makes a fellow stop and think!
      But don't you worry one bit, my boy. I'm going to do
      everything I possibly can, with the reporters and at the
      inquest and everything, to cover you up, and keep folks
      from thinking this is a tough joint. Now I never was one to
      say "I told you so", but don't it beat the dickens how just
      the other day I was telling you how necessary it is for you
      to stand in with the authorities? Now this bootlegger I was
      telling you about, Purvis, his name is, he's a fellow . .
      .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I get your idea, Sheriff! I don't worry about breaking the
      law in selling booze. It's just that bathtub gin and fine
      food and good service don't mix.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, do murder and suicide mix any better?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'None of that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I didn't mean to be fresh. But you'll see reason--just
      <i>can't</i> run a backwoods joint like this without
      sufficient likker on hand, convenient. I've talked this all
      over with your hotel dick here, and he agreed with me. How
      about it, Dutch?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure. You bet your life. Fellow's got to be
      <i>reasonable,</i> see how I mean, Chief?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron murmured, 'It would give me the greatest pleasure if
      both you gentlemen went straight to hell. Good-day!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Three deputies--though not, of course, led by the friendly
      Mr. Everett Beasy--raided the Inn a week later, and found a
      pint of whisky behind the bar. They were just arresting
      Clark Cleaver, chief clerk (an assonance which Ora found
      very funny indeed) when Myron telephoned to T. J. Dingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      That ended the process of law and justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks later, when Myron was driving back from the
      Centre by moonlight, some one shot at him from the bushes.
      The shot bored his windshield. In his office at the Inn, he
      immediately telephoned to Beasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hello. The sheriff? Good evening. This is Myron Weagle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well, I was terribly sorry to hear about that
      outrage!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What outrage?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Uh, uh--I mean the murder and suicide.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The murder two weeks ago, Sheriff?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sure. What the hell did you think I meant?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Better than that, Beasy. I know what you meant! Listen.
      You remember the older New York reporter that was here at
      the opening? Denmack? The tall thin fellow, a little bald?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I guess so. What about him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Didn't he strike you as a pretty competent man--rather too
      good to just do an hotel opening--probably got the
      assignment just to give him a little vacation?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What of it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Didn't Denmack strike you as a fellow that would be very
      enterprising, and yet very judicious and accurate, and not
      easily scared?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know as he struck me at all! I didn't pay any
      attention to him in any way, shape, or manner! Darned
      fresh, that's how he struck me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Exactly! Well, you'll be interested to know that I'm
      typing out a complete account of everything I know about
      the officers of the peace around here; names and
      everything, from the time of your first call on me, through
      the phony raid here, to this evening--original and two
      carbons. I'll finish it before I get to bed to-night, and
      to-morrow one copy will be in T. J. Dingle's hands, and
      another in Denmack's, but sealed, with instructions that he
      is to open it only in case anything happens to me. It might
      make a nice piece for the household page of his newspaper.
      So if I were you, I'd tell your man to stop shooting so
      recklessly--or else shoot to kill, next time!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Weagle, I do believe you've gone plumb crazy! I just
      haven't got the slightest idea what you're talking about!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'm glad to hear that, old man. Certainly glad. And
      look now, as an expert, do you feel that Dutch Linderbeck,
      my dick here, is a competent loyal fellow?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He certainly is, Weagle. I don't understand one bit what
      you were kidding me about before, but when it comes to
      Dutch, he's O.K., a swell reliable guard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thanks a lot! I'll fire him first thing in the morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Myron that he had invited Beasy to shoot him
      that night, and the window-door of his office, opening into
      a grove, was perfect for convenient assassination. Yet he
      could not face being so melodramatic as to set out a guard
      or to borrow a revolver--provided, indeed, there was any
      revolver at the Inn, outside of Dutch Linderbeck's
      hip-pocket. He pulled down the curtain. His shadow fell on
      it, and he was uncomfortable as he sat typing not only his
      own experiences with the good Sheriff Beasy, but T. J.
      Dingle's information about Beasy's relationship to the
      Pinetop Dancing Pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, paralyzed. There was a distinct sound on the
      brick walk outside his window. He could not endure the
      inaction. He flung the window open, his back cold and
      shivering. He found the origin of the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a porcupine, waddling away, terrified, looking back
      at him with the bleary, timid little eyes of a bear-cub,
      and skidding on the smooth brick as it tried to hurry.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In mid-August, two months after the opening, a time which
      should have been the best season, the Black Thread Inn was
      half empty. There had been other hotels aplenty in which
      there had been suicides, but the chance of one occurring on
      the opening night had tickled the imagination of that
      considerable part of the public which leads cautious lives
      and takes it out in gloating over the delights of suicides,
      torch-murders, sash-weight-murders, hangings, poison, and
      warfare. Myron knew that Sheriff Beasy and his intimates
      were scuttling about saying, 'I'd see my son or daughter
      dead before I'd let 'em so much as step foot in that den of
      iniquity!' And the tabloid newspaper had done much for
      Myron by its headline about 'Murder Tavern', run between an
      editorial on the necessity of church-going and a special
      article on Honour as one of the best-thought-of virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brisk scattering of sensation-lickers motoring
      for lunch, sometimes staying overnight. They vastly
      furthered the Inn's reputation as a sanctuary for illicit
      lovers. Some of them got more noisily drunk and burned more
      cigarette holes in the carpet than even a veteran hotel-man
      expects, and all of them hinted that they would just love
      to have a glimpse of the Murder Chamber. Occasionally the
      clerks satisfied them, by showing them any convenient room
      which happened to be empty; sometimes Myron indulged
      himself in the pleasure--his only one, just now--of
      refusing to do so, and thus losing for life their scabrous
      patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the respectable couples who were neither rude nor greasy
      nor drunk, there was a proportion that had as much virtuous
      and smirking curiosity in peeping at the Inn as a haunt of
      vice as do respectable couples who go to slimy cafés in
      Paris or Berlin and are irritably disappointed when they
      see no degenerates to disgust them, but only other
      rabbit-nosed tourists like themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Myron was patient as he had never been in his zealous
      life. Daily he told himself to be patient--Effie May told
      him to be patient--Gritzmeier told him to be patient--Clark
      Cleaver begged him to be patient--Tom Weagle whined at him
      to be patient--and despite all this, he actually was
      patient. But he hated the loose-jawed gapers who believed
      that his clean place was a den of rottenness, and whose
      shambling curiosity polluted the Inn more than any swift
      and honest murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This too would pass away. People would forget. It was
      impossible that they should go on thinking of his Inn as
      merely a cheap bawdy house and not see the kindly rooms,
      the gay beach, the beautiful food that every day was
      lovingly prepared and at night had to be thrown away,
      untasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And people did forget. Other events claimed them. Labour
      Day, and the beginning of a new year in the office. The
      World's Series. New feature films. It was the year of
      Lindbergh and Clarence Chamberlin, and of Byrd and
      Maitland, and after their ocean flights, they were never
      out of the papers. Princess Lowenstein-Wertheim, Philip
      Payne, Mrs. Frances Grayson and half a dozen others winged
      out to sea and were never heard from again. Young Mr.
      Hickman, a prominent Sunday School scholar, kidnapped and
      murdered a child named Marion Parker, which entertained
      up-to-the-minute readers even more than an hotel-suicide.
      The Case of the Murder Tavern began to slide back into the
      indifference with which any democracy views any incident,
      noble or vile, that is more than four months old; and by
      October 1927, it was only history, as inconceivably ancient
      as the events of a whole year before--the positively
      medieval happenings of 1926, such as the coming over of
      Queen Marie and Ivar Kreuger to bear messages of Europe's
      love and its desire to do America good, or the re-opening
      of the Hall-Mills case, with its altogether elegant murder
      of a rector and his choir-singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only son of Senator Colquhoun was one now with Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in September, when the oaks and maples hung out the
      banners of a gallant and dying host, guests who did not
      snoop and giggle began to appear at the Inn, from nowhere
      in particular, and a few of them stayed a week, riding,
      tramping, playing golf, and shyly informing Myron that they
      had never known such food or such beds. For the first time,
      there was honest young laughter from the cabañas and
      diving-boards, and youth discovered as dizzily modern the
      croquet of its grandmothers. There were reservations
      scattered through October.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, Myron complimented himself, if the Inn wasn't
      really perfect, at least he had chosen the site
      prophetically. There was no rival within fifty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, four miles away, the luxurious Olde Mill Country Club
      had financial trouble, and bid for transient strangers. On
      all the roads about Black Thread were placards reading:
      'Hotel Prices but Club Exclusiveness--Rooms &amp;
      Restaurant Open to Transients--Live <i><font color=
      "#FF0000">At</font></i> the Golf Course Not <i><font color=
      "#FF0000">Near</font></i> it.' The lettering was in black,
      except that the 'at' and 'near' were tastefully done in
      red.
    </p>
    <p>
      The club had had no murder scandal. Customers who would
      have gone to the Black Thread Inn went there, and were
      delighted at being able to step from the golf course
      directly into the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Myron was apprehensive again, after a week of
      autumn-coloured tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Pondering it all, he began to see vaguely now, in 1927,
      what he would see sharply in the early 1930's: that the
      entire 'resort-hotel business' was changing, and much of it
      would be lost; that with all love and devotion he had built
      his 'perfect inn', at exactly the worst possible time, as
      if one should triumphantly set up shop as epic poet just
      when the prose novel was ousting the hexameter, perhaps for
      ever.

      The former summer resort, frequently centred about just one
      hotel, had been self-contained, with a social life that was
      exciting, however naive it might be, in the manner of
      William Dean Howells and the Golden Nineties. The chief
      travelling of the families who so joyously came for a
      fortnight or a month to Bar Harbour, Saratoga Springs,
      Bretton Woods, was the long, dusty, creaking journey by
      train that ended so gloriously in the sight of grey
      breakers or glistening hills, and the familiar, funny
      little station which signified that they were here again
      for a glorious recreation, and then the sad return home to
      New York or Boston. In between, the only locomotion was
      joyous sails and picnic-rides in haywagons or parades in
      smart red-wheeled buggies. Travel was the least of their
      vacationing. They needed no delicate coaxing by
      hotel-keepers to amuse themselves; no talkies nor
      golf-courses nor $20,000 a year leaders of jazz-bands to
      tickle jaded spirits. So long as they had a croquet ground,
      a big room and a piano for dancing, plenty of boats, and
      the hills and sea which, in those careless and uncharted
      days were provided by the Lord God and not by a
      hotel-keeper, they were content . . . as nearly content as
      any group of people ever are anywhere. Even among the Idle
      Rich, the elegants of the '90's who had actually been in
      Europe and married off a sister to the cousin of a baron,
      there were summer dramatic societies, yachting parties, men
      who needed no snarl of an outboard-motor to stomach them
      for fishing--who, indeed, for fishing chiefly demanded
      fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they stayed put. Even the transients who remained but
      two weeks (which would correspond to-day to the lunchers
      who stay for but thirty minutes) were as eager as the
      passengers on a slow steamer to establish a social life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motor car changed the whole affair, as it changed the
      whole plan of cities and suburbs. It is not determined, but
      one may guess, that Benz, Haines, and Henry Ford have
      altered the world as much as Napoleon, Alexander, and
      Caesar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new motor tourists spent most of their time in travel,
      for its own sake, and hotels became to them not centres of
      amusement, to which they were eager to contribute their own
      efforts at conviviality, but merely stations for food and
      beds and gasoline.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an increase, also, in the number of families who
      had once been content to stay at hotels, but built now
      their own cottages, near their own friends, with a social
      life from which the strangers of the hotels were excluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The golfing mania finally finished the concentration of
      resort life. Swimmers and tennis-players and those content
      with the tepid thrills of croquet had been well-enough
      satisfied to go on swimming and playing tennis and clicking
      croquet balls on the same grounds. But the golfers were for
      ever leaping into automobiles and going on to new, distant
      hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the motor brought more people out of the cities, the
      hotels did not profit. The motorists were neither willing
      to pay for nor so much interested in the excellences of
      hotel food and service which had once been the chief zest
      of citizens gossiping and rocking all day long on hotel
      porches. And many who were sufficiently prosperous to stay
      in decent hotels stopped at the farmhouses all over the
      land which began to hang out the sign 'Tourists
      Accommodated'. The food there was good enough, they said,
      and the bedchambers, and it was more convenient to make an
      Early Getaway from a farmhouse than from an elaborate
      hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later to come--unknown as yet in the east, just
      beginning in the west, but by the early 1930's to be the
      final menace to resort hotels--were the professional
      Tourist Camps which grew out of the farmhouses: overnight
      cottages with restaurants and supply shops which were
      frankly and entirely devoted to the flying motorist and,
      with no corps of professional attendants, no effort to
      provide great lounging-rooms and varied meals and parking
      grounds, could so lower prices that the resort hotel, and
      the small-city hotel on main routes, were both to be
      bankrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, Myron saw, worrying, it was just at the beginning of
      this period of prose that he had brought forth his epic.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He tried every device of growing desperation. He cut the
      minimum rate, 'American plan', from fifteen dollars a day
      to ten. He gushed selling-letters like a fountain. To save
      money, he did not complete the swimming-pool, in the
      autumn. He pleaded with Dingle, who wanted to sell out his
      share for what he could get. He spent hours with Gritzmeier
      devising ways of saving money on food without lessening
      quality. After working all day, he swayed home to dress,
      and brought Effie May to dance all evening. He tried to act
      as 'social host', vice the departed Benny Rumble, to unite
      the suspicious guests in some sort of authentic gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May liked dancing with him, but she was a bit shy of
      what seemed to her the grander guests and she, once so avid
      of crystal-lighted evenings, murmured to him, 'You seem so
      tired. Hadn't we better go home?' If ever he had fancied
      her provincial and inelastic and a little stupid, he forgot
      it all in clinging to her kindness . . . He had sometimes
      thought that he would, before it was too late, have an
      'affair' with some woman brilliant and imaginative. He
      reflected now that this was one of the luxuries he would
      have to give up to reserve enough strength to make the
      Perfect Inn which, he now perceived, was not finished at
      all, but simply begun.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      While he dealt with major misfortunes, he had the
      annoyances that he would have had in any resort hotel,
      however well established and patronized. The staff, being
      in the country yet barred from most country rollicking,
      were bored. They hadn't much fun in off hours in swimming
      under the eyes of those nobles, the
      aristocracy-by-grace-of-fifteen-dollars-a-day. They quit,
      just to have something amusing to do, and there were no
      hotel employment agencies round the corner. There was
      always a waiter or two on his way to New York, and a
      substitute supposedly, but not certainly, on his way to the
      Inn. And they took it out in feuds. Colleagues whom in June
      they had regarded as playmates they discovered in August to
      be anarchists who were plotting to give them poison in
      their coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clark Cleaver, the spotless chief clerk, came in to wail to
      Myron that another clerk was 'shystering on the job', and
      very perky about it, and that 'one or the other of us will
      have to leave'. The once benign Myron glared, and astounded
      his disciple by shouting, 'Then I've got a damn good mind
      to fire both of you! I'm not an ambulance surgeon! Go back
      and take care of your own troubles!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, Mr. Weagle!' trembled the faithful Cleaver.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the pretty young chambermaids would always be out in
      the woods by moonlight with the pretty young waiters, and
      the old and less pretty chambermaids would find this rural
      bliss very low and nasty, and <i>they</i> would threaten to
      quit, and Myron would try to keep from thinking of his
      clean sweep once at Tippecanoe Lodge, and how nice it would
      be to discharge every one of his trained staff, chase out
      every guest with a shot-gun, and sit happily alone amid the
      ruins.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      As in every summer hotel, the hardest guests to manage were
      not the crooks, the blackmailers who pretended to have lost
      a case of jewels, and threatened to sue, nor the noisy
      boozers, but the respectables who were just plain
      nuisances: the run-of-the-mill pests, the bores, the
      imaginative old gentlemen who wanted the moon, and wanted
      it fried, and wanted it quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolute young lady who played the piano all afternoon
      in the ballroom-sunroom, and played it badly, so that her
      fellow customers went pale and thought about moving away.
      The resolute old lady who, happily spying, saw evil where
      none existed and--what made a great deal more
      trouble--where it did exist. The other old ladies who just
      rocked and watched and rocked and watched until less
      locomotive people went crazy. The man who wanted the desk
      to get impossible long-distance telephone-calls for him,
      and wanted his mail before it had ever reached Black
      Thread; and his cousin the man who was extremely important
      in Bellows Falls or Augusta or Tacoma, and who expected to
      be known here and treated with reverence--and flattering
      room-rates. The middle-aged ladies who all day long, with
      firm, quiet, steady, never-ceasing voices, told agonized
      strangers about their relatives--in particular about what
      Professor Pibkik--of course you know his name and what an
      <i>authority</i> he is, and he told me himself, he said,
      Mrs. Snodbody, in <i>my</i> opinion, after my thirty years
      of teaching, your son has one of the most remarkable
      intellects I have ever encountered, and I predict for him
      an extraordinary . . . Firm, quiet, steady, relentless
      voice, and Myron, hearing it through his open office
      window, longed for a decent drunken quartet singing 'Down
      Mobile Bay'.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these were just the normal pleasures of his business.
      With them, he was beginning to have distresses out of the
      ordinary.

      For weeks they had been holding acrimonious conferences,
      but it was in December, 1927, some six months after the
      opening of the Inn, that Pye and Charian told their
      partners, Myron and T. J. Dingle, what changes they were
      going to make in the management, to 'save' the place . . .
      and they had an excess of stock, to give them control. It
      was so peaceful-sounding a conference: the four men sitting
      in tilted chairs about Myron's desk, Pye's voice light and
      cheerful, Dingle polite and wary, Myron and Charian
      speaking slowly, as though nothing in particular was
      afoot--as, indeed, there was nothing, save perhaps as
      regarded Myron, and for him only the ruin of everything he
      had planned in his forty-seven years of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would, announced Dick Pye, lower rates to six-to-eight
      dollars a day. To make it possible, they would consciously
      cheapen food and service; discharging Gritzmeier, with
      Clark Cleaver, and a certain number of chambermaids,
      waiters, bell-boys. The skilled floor-waiters would be
      replaced by ordinary tray-toters. The number of rooms
      served by each chambermaid would be increased from ten to
      fourteen, with a proportionate lessening in the dusting,
      sweeping, check of furnishings.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they would sell liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, they wouldn't exactly <i>sell</i> it, Pye
      explained. That would be illegal, and might subject the
      hotel to being closed. But they would make peace with
      Sheriff Beasy--and what could be more legal than that?--and
      the staff would be permitted to oblige guests with the name
      of the sheriff's friend, the bootlegger, and it was none of
      the hotel's business if the bootlegger sold his wares here;
      the hotel would have nothing to do with it, except taking a
      percentage from him. And if he used a loft of the stable to
      store his wares, and the hotel didn't know it, how was that
      their fault?
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron, trying to sound no more serious than the chatty Dick
      Pye, fought him point to point, particularly in regard to
      discharging Gritzmeier and selling liquor, and was beaten
      point by point, and at the last Pye prattled, 'Now one
      final suggestion. At first you won't care for the idea,
      Weagle, but when you think it over you'll see that it will
      make things easier for you. Charian and I appreciate the
      way you've tried to make this the highest-class joint
      possible, and we understand thoroughly that it isn't your
      fault that things haven't broken right. We're sure they
      will later, and then you can go back to all your original
      arrangements, and nobody'll be gladder about it than we.
      We've decided that since a lot of the changes will be
      distasteful to you, we'll bring Jimmy Shanks out here from
      the Dickens to take charge. No! Wait! We'll promote you to
      the title of General Director--though at the same salary,
      I'm afraid--and you can devote yourself to direct-mail
      advertising, and to getting acquainted with the guests. Or,
      if you would rather try something else, we'll try to buy
      out your interests at a fair price--perhaps Mr. Dingle,
      here, can help us in arbitrating . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In other words, Pye, since I have a contract with you, you
      can't fire me, so you're going to run me out on it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Pye looked seraphic as he warbled, 'Oh, I wouldn't say
      that! Come now! Title of "General Director"? Think how much
      better that sounds than just "Manager"!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The system technically called 'running a man out on his
      contract' is one of the most admirable devices known to the
      modern business-world of doing illegal things legally. It
      exterminates any executive, any employee important enough
      to have a contract whereby he cannot be discharged except
      for proven fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, he is humiliated. His private office and secretary
      are taken from him. He is treated with mocking courtesy,
      while he is being crucified, but he is stationed at a
      contemptible little desk, in the main office among his
      former subordinates. Then, if he is lazy, if he would
      merely read newspapers all day if he were given nothing
      more important to do, he is set at such petty tasks that
      every one begins to laugh at him. On the other hand, if he
      is industrious and ambitious, he is left idle and ignored
      day after day after day, till his pride explodes, and he
      quits. In neither case is he likely to endure it, for the
      term of his contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Myron was industrious and ambitious, Pye and Charian
      through Jimmy Shanks, used the second method. He was
      relieved from all duties save sitting in his office,
      frenzied with the first enforced idleness since he had lain
      abed with that less tormenting illness, the 'flu--nothing
      at all to do, except watch Jimmy Shanks, the new manager,
      briskly and amiably defiling the shrine.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Gritzmeier and Clark Cleaver were discharged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new chef was a fancy fellow from New York, with
      experience in night clubs, large cheap hotels, chain
      cafeterias, and the summer roof-garden of an hotel. He
      could prepare splendid desserts for special dinners, with
      glistening ropes of spun sugar, but he cared not at all for
      the patient processes of making bouillon with a real taste,
      nor for the freshness of vegetables. Jimmy Shanks and the
      new chef between them did a great deal of what was known as
      'effecting economies.' They mixed evaporated milk with the
      cream. They made butterless and eggless cakes. They
      introduced at the Inn all the women's-club and women's-page
      desserts that Myron hated: horrible drug-store things with
      raspberry syrup and nuts and slices of pineapple and
      marshmallows and canned cherries. They advertised and were
      successful with the 'Old-time New England Dinner, every
      Friday evening'--with clam-chowder, beans, corned beef and
      cabbage, and pumpkin pie made with cornstarch instead of
      eggs--and made every motoring New Yorker, exclaim over its
      delicious quaintness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if Shanks provided less edible food, he put more items
      on the menu, and printed it on cardboard edged with gold,
      and most customers liked the change, and the chagrined
      Myron wondered whether he knew anything about
      hotel-keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if Shanks changed the excellent orchestra for a cheaper
      one, the new players were much noisier, and he introduced
      in this ballroom just the changing coloured lights and
      confetti and paper-hats and streamers beloved in the worst
      night clubs, and again every one was happy, and Myron
      thought about going back to sweeping floors till he learned
      his profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrangements with Beasy's bootlegger ran quietly and
      well; the guests were not much more noisily drunken than
      when they had brought their own liquor, and the hotel had
      profit on it. The new chief clerk was much less inquisitive
      about the relationships of ladies and gentlemen than Clark
      Cleaver had been. And for all the lower rates, the general
      profits of the Inn increased. That winter of 1927-8, there
      was a fairly large crowd for the Winter Sports, and if most
      of them found dancing and drinking more reasonable than
      going out into the cold for skiing and luging and skating
      why, that merely lessened all worry as to whether there was
      enough snow. Under Shanks, the Inn was settling into a
      sensible, realistic position as one of the most comfortable
      houses of assignation and refuges for prosperous drunks
      within an afternoon motor-run of New York, and every one
      was happy, except Myron Weagle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose they really are what is called "sensible". They
      accept sporting gentlemen for just what they are, and give
      them just what they want. Only I can't be satisfied with
      anything except what I think is a fine hotel,' thought the
      fanatic.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He sought to make clear to his few confidants, to Effie
      May, Ora, Alec Monlux, and perhaps to himself, just what he
      had been trying to do. 'I would have made a solid success
      here, that would have gone on for fifty years, if they had
      given me time,' he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alec, for all his affection, was not much interested. He
      was no creator of hotels nor of anything else; he was a man
      on a job, who did as well as he could just what he was told
      to do. Ora scoffed. Even Effie May could not see anything
      to grieve about, if Myron would just get rid of Shanks.
      'What's the difference between your letting your guests
      bring their own hootch, and selling it to them, except that
      this way the hotel gets some of the profit?' she demanded,
      and Myron was foundered; he had no logical answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave up trying to explain--except to himself, and
      himself he found no very good audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt lonely and shamed as he watched Shanks ruin the
      Inn. He tried often enough to seize control again, but Pye
      and Charian could have forced him out by court action. He
      wanted to run away from the spectacle of sacrilege, but
      perhaps if he stayed, he could get back into power. He was
      always making suggestions to Shanks, who agreed with him
      heartily, and never took them. For the rest, Myron sat in
      his office, idle, for as many minutes at a time as he could
      endure it. He was certainly not going to invite his private
      list of faithful guests to the sort of place this had
      become!
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not sleep well. He got into a wretched habit of
      awakening at five, with nothing to do till seven. He would
      lie still, not to disturb Effie May, in the bed by his,
      till his muscles were racked with staying in one position,
      and he crept out into the cold, shawled himself in a
      grotesque costume of overcoat over dressing-gown over
      pyjamas, and padded down to sit by the cold fire-place and
      smoke cigarettes and, with scarlet aching eyes, try to read
      magazines. On the first mornings of this insomnia, he made
      coffee for himself, but it became too much trouble, and he
      just sat, trembling with sleepiness--till he lay down, when
      the enemy leaped on him again. All the while, he was coldly
      hungry, yet when the waiter came from the inn with
      breakfast, at eight, he could only sip coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May hardly suspected this tortured prowling. She was
      a healthy young sleeper, that one!
    </p>
    <p>
      In all his life, Myron had never thought much about
      himself, as an individual, detached from his work. He had
      been old-fashioned in having, even now, after the war, no
      fascinating Troubles, Complexities, Maladjustments or what
      not. He became aware of himself as Myron, a person naked,
      no longer sheltered by the walls of work, and he got very
      tired of that ever-present person. Once he awoke to see the
      familiar hand of Myron Weagle lying on the counterpane,
      visible in moonlight through the window and in the divided
      personality that sometimes persists for seconds after
      awakening, he quaked, 'That's that man, still here! Oh my
      God! How he bores me! Have I got to be with him all day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He brooded, as he had not before, on every one who had
      ill-used him--on Pye, Ora, Herbert and Julia Lambkin,
      Carlos Jaynes, Sheriff Beasy, his father. Hitherto he had
      had his quarrel and done something about it and forgotten
      it; now, a sick man, he sat in the empty hours of early
      morning going over and over his grievances.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to rouse himself to healing activity, but the
      habit of sloth was breaking him, and when he decided to
      find a new job, he could not get down to writing letters,
      could not even plan what to do, whom to see. In such hours
      he longed to get wholesomely and thoroughly drunk, but he
      was afraid of that anodyne; he had seen its too successful
      drugging, not only in a thousand unhappy guests, hiding out
      in hotels, but in his own father and brother.
      Afraid--definitely he was afraid; and never before had he
      been afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May was sleepily sympathetic, but she did not know.
      It was to his mother, still in the kitchen at the American
      House--though a chef emeritus now--that he fled. And to her
      who would have understood fast enough, he could not
      confess, for what sustained her life was the belief that
      her son was a conqueror. With her he actually boasted a
      little of how completely he was controlling Pye and Shanks,
      while his father fussed about them and waggled his little
      beard and piped, 'You want to stand in with those
      fellows--you want to stand in with those fellows--they're
      on to this high-class city trade and after all, you're just
      a small-town boy! What you need is to come ask my advice
      oftener!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ora was helpful. Ora stayed away! He came once, saw the
      lay of the land, tried to become chummy with Jimmy Shanks,
      was snubbed, and did not come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through it all, Myron's one consolation, and surprise, was
      that he became acquainted with his own son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after years of seeing hotel children snatch things
      from waiters, Myron liked to picture the little things as
      all clinging sweetness, like warm cotton. But when he faced
      it, he admitted that, at ten and a half, Luke was as hard
      and sharp as a steel blade. He was independent, demanding,
      logical, secret. He was less blundering than either of his
      parents, and if he was less softly playful than either of
      them, and seemingly less sympathetic, he was more resolute.
      He knew what he wanted--apparently, for just what it was,
      Myron could never quite find out. Luke felt himself a
      representative of the great and dazzling city of Mount
      Vernon and, condescending to Black Thread Centre, amused
      himself by leading the sixth grade in the Centre public
      school. He was as civil as he was secret; only two things
      made him scowl--Effie May's fussing about such private
      matters as his nails, and the habit, seemingly inborn in
      all hotel-guests, of trying to be showily friendly, and
      screaming, 'Well, old man, I suppose you think you'll run a
      hotel too, when you grow up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He just did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, then, was a new thing for Myron to be afraid of, just
      as parents in general had been afraid of their children's
      hidden opinions, ever since the war. He cultivated Luke as
      he had never cultivated Mark Elphinstone or any gilded
      guest of the Hotel Crillon. Almost timidly he invited Luke
      to go tramping up the snowy hill above the lake. He panted
      beside him, longing for some magic by which he could enter
      the mind of this citizen of a new world that was more
      distant from his America of the 1890's than was Italy or
      Tibet. He guessed that the only passport to his son's
      heart, territory, uncontrollable by any Versailles Treaty
      of domesticity, was silence. He had noted how irritated
      Luke was by his mother's questions, that is (for he was
      just, as children often are) when they were foolish: 'Did
      you eat the sandwiches that mother gave you for lunch all
      up?' and 'Why don't you get better marks in Reading when
      you do so good in Arithmetic?'
    </p>
    <p>
      So, mostly, Myron said nothing, except when he inquired
      about the names of shrubs and winterbound birds, which Luke
      knew better than he did, and if he had any talent at all
      for fatherhood, he showed it in not resenting Luke's
      quicker knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in February he was rewarded. They were squatting on
      a rock at the top of Elm Hill, looking down on the snowy
      roofs of the hotel and its outbuildings, and the glare of
      the lake where, on cleared ice, guests in red and yellow
      mackinaws were skating. Myron was smoking a pipe, which he
      had taken up as a sound, outdoor equipment, and which he
      disliked extremely. Luke was jabbing imaginary whales with
      a stick. He spoke suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dad, I guess I'll be a sailor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Um-huh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We been reading about whaling. I guess that would be
      pretty exciting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I imagine it would.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or in the army, and get sent to Alaska and China and
      places!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd like that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But still . . . Maybe I'd like to keep a hotel, like
      granddad and you. Because I guess I could do that better 'n
      anybody! Because you can do it better 'n anybody! Gee, I
      think Mr. Shanks is a lousy hotel keeper! Why don't you
      fire him? He's--he pats me on the head! I hate him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      That moment broke the patience with which Myron had waited
      for the Lord to cause something to happen.

    </p>
    <p>
      Four days later, Richard Pye and Nick Schirovsky decided
      that their labours in distributing booze to the solidest
      citizens of New York, the worthies who kept every law
      except inconvenient ones, merited a vacation. There were
      few guests at the Inn, and all of them of a reasonable,
      dripping sort, so Pye and Schirovsky took it over for a
      week-end, with a company of a dozen sympathetic ladies and
      gentlemen not of Pye's polo set. They had a splendid time.
      Everyone was drunk daily by noon, and slept it off, and was
      drunk before evening again, and danced till dawn. There was
      a pyjama parade, and much laughter about gentlemen who were
      found in wrong rooms at breakfast time, and the time when
      Nick Schirovsky, wearing only his drawers, went out and
      rolled in the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was on hand nineteen hours a day, protecting the
      decorations of the Inn so far as he could, for Jimmy
      Shanks, normally no fool, had gone native and become one of
      the most lush of the gay Bacchantes. Several times, not
      without roughness, Myron put to bed guests who wanted to
      play billiards with bottles for balls, or to toy with the
      firehose, and Dick Pye became irritated. After three days,
      he began gently, then much less gently, to tease Myron
      about his undignified exile-at-home. Whenever Myron made
      suggestions--such as that one of the joyous party really
      ought to stop setting his bed afire--Pye said mockingly,
      'Anything you say goes with me, Boss, I'll certainly attend
      to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Late one night, he swaggered and staggered into Myron's
      office, much drunker than Myron had ever seen him, and
      crowed, 'Everybody's insisting you come on join us. We're
      going to have an impromptu masquerade ball, right now! And
      chase your wife over here, too. Need more gals.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing doing! And you better go to bed. You've got no
      right to raise such Cain. There are a few guests besides
      your party, Pye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, damn the guests! There wouldn't be even a few, if I
      hadn't taken hold! You always did want to run this place
      like a Methodist prayer-meeting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We won't go into that now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The hell we won't! You think you're a partner, but you're
      just a plain clerk, and you come when I ring the bell for
      you! You're a plain pen-pusher!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron found himself in front of the desk, shaking Mr.
      Richard Pye like a school-boy. He shook him with all the
      fury of six months of brooding. Pye tried to hit back, but
      Myron rocked him till he was dizzy. He slapped Pye, then,
      and was frightened by discovering how homicidally he wanted
      to give him one sweet, ringing, murderous clip on the jaw
      and, lest he do it, he shoved Pye into the closet in his
      office, locked it, put the key with absurdly sober-looking
      methodicalness into the top drawer of his desk, and went
      quietly crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that he had begun, he burned to go on and wipe out
      Schirovsky, Shanks, all their guests, and anybody else who
      came handy. He fled down into the quiet basement, to get
      hold of himself. He found himself in the furnace-room,
      staring at a heap of wrapping paper, excelsior, fragments
      of boxes. What suddenly made him really insane was this
      litter. When he had been in charge, the basement had been
      tidy as a parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would make a lovely fire! By God, he would burn up the
      whole place! With fire and fury he would destroy the
      abomination! He was a pen-pusher again, was he? He had to
      answer the bell to Dick Pye's fancy, did he?--yes, and to
      the whim of that murdering bootlegger, Schirovsky! He'd
      destroy them, along with their stinking den! He touched a
      match to the excelsior, and a flame ran up the wall, tasted
      a dry beam.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gaped, surprised. Then he leaped. For forty years he had
      been trained to be ready for hotel-fires. Not thinking, not
      having to think, he snatched a fire-extinguisher from its
      bracket and, quite coolly, directed the chemical stream at
      the base of the writhing flare of paper and kindling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a good fire-extinguisher, for it had been chosen,
      long before this building had been finished, by none other
      than Manager Weagle. If it had not been so good, so chosen,
      the Black Thread Inn, with Mr. Richard Pye locked in a
      closet, would have burned complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron stood trembling. He was too shocked to tamper with
      blaming himself. So quivery and weak of knee that he could
      scarcely walk, he got himself up the stairs, into his
      office, and unlocked the closet door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Pye was placidly asleep, and from the ballroom came
      the cheerfullest sound of jazz as the masquerade ball
      began. Then Myron laughed, gently shook Pye awake, and
      still more gently crooned, 'Sorry to disturb you, Dick, but
      I thought you ought to know that I have resigned, and my
      lawyer will be glad to arrange with you about the sale of
      my stock in this place--what's it called?--Black Thread
      Inn? Any time it's convenient. Good night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And walked across to his cottage, feeling exalted, while
      Dick Pye sat up stupidly, among brooms, dust-cloths, and
      letter-files, clumsily brushing a cob-web out of his hair.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Like Deacon Wheelwright of the Connecticut Inn, Mr. Henry
      Fiesel was a vestigial remnant of the rustic tradition in
      hotel-keeping. He was as crafty and secretive as
      Wheelwright, but more boldly speculative, and considerably
      meaner. For years he had kept hotel in New York, but he
      remained a suspicious, penny-pinching, country innkeeper.
      He still wore rubbers and long woollen underwear. Though he
      was actually smooth-shaven, you remembered him as wearing
      sandy side-whiskers. Spiritually, he did wear sandy
      side-whiskers. They had merely grown inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had risen from working in a lodging-house in New York to
      the sole proprietorship, now that he was sixty-eight, of
      the nine-hundred-and-fifty-room Fiesel Hotel, a
      respectable, cheap, yet lavishly gilded pile which made
      much of its income from the cut-rate drug store and the
      'beauty-shop' off its large lobby, and from its bustling
      Gothic Coffee Shop, where business men saved time (it was
      never explained for what they saved it) by lunching on
      stuffed eggs, toast Melba, and coffee, and their
      stenographers in a more leisurely and elegant way trifled
      with a bacon-and-tomato sandwich and an ice cream soda.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fiesel Hotel was a railway station minus anything so
      romantic as trains destined for Key West or Seattle. And of
      this camp under a roof, Myron was made manager-in-chief in
      the autumn of 1928, eight months after quitting the Black
      Thread Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, for his share in the Black Thread Inn,
      theoretically worth $130,000, been able to get only
      $60,000, and he had been glad enough to have that. He had
      diligently lost $15,000 in his only stock-market gamble
      and, back at real work, awakened from nightmare, he was
      relieved to have so much as $45,000 left, invested in
      bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eight months, a little sick of a career of
      hotel-keeping that could wind up in Dick Pye's drunken
      party at the Inn, he had wandered, he had peeped into other
      dodges, such as starting a chain of garages and, not
      altogether content yet no longer feeling futile and
      ridiculous, no longer awakening at five to crouch and
      brood, he had gone back to his last, at the Fiesel Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Old Fiesel was snuffling and sniffling about his need of a
      vacation after years of unrelenting work, and a month after
      Myron took charge, he went off with his wife to Los Angeles
      and rented a bungalow for the winter. He had stayed in New
      York just long enough to give Myron an appreciation of his
      quality, which was that of decaying ragweed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron's systems of food-cost-finding were as naught beside
      Fiesel's natural genius for getting raw materials at a
      seventh of a cent per ounce cheaper. He loved to save
      pennies even if it cost him pounds. When canned vegetables
      were cheaper than fresh, Fiesel convinced himself that he
      preferred the taste of the canned ones. He had the lights
      cut off in the servants' rooms at ten-thirty. He never
      permitted a new carpet to be purchased so long as the old
      one could be painfully stitched together. He spent hours of
      joyful energy in working out codes of fining dish-washers
      for broken dishes, chambermaids for missing towels, no
      matter whether they were stolen by guests or otherwise
      lost, cashiers for shortage of petty cash, bell-boys for
      being one minute late in the morning or for smoking
      cigarettes in corridors.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an enthusiast about 'the value of fraternal
      organizations,' which value, to him, was providing banquets
      and conventions for his beloved fraternity brothers. He was
      astounded to find that Myron was such a novice at
      inn-keeping as to belong only to the Masons and Elks, and
      pointed out that the manager of the rival Hotel Bonnie
      Claire (also a large and gilded stable for human cattle)
      was no less than Monarch of Ramadan Grotto, Occult and
      Brotherly Order of the Winged Warriors of the Cretan
      Caravan. He insisted that Myron become a Monarch, or a
      Perpetual Potentate, or at the very least a Princely
      Prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron said he'd look into it right away and, for once,
      didn't. He grumbled to himself that he was an innkeeper,
      not a pedlar, and he was altogether unimpressed by Fiesel's
      long-winded tale about Myron's predecessor who, as Past
      Worshipful Master of Israel Putnam Lodge, 'had captured a
      lodge banquet for twelve hundred at seven dollars a plate,
      though a rival hotel had quoted $6.90 and had included
      squabs, whereas the Hotel Fiesel had given them only Long
      Island duckling, at a time when duckling was going begging
      at twelve and fourteen cents a pound'.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Old Fiesel had gone off to California, nervously
      leaving Myron in charge, he wrote to Myron every day the
      treasures of his travel observation--which had nothing to
      do with mountains and sea. ('And serve me damn well right,'
      admitted Myron. 'Didn't I go to Europe, and see nothing but
      hotels, all for the purpose of making a private joint for
      Dick Pye? Next time I go, I'll look at nothing but art
      galleries and the damn scenery, I will!') Fiesel wrote to
      Myron, on a faded picture postcard, that hot tamales ought
      to be featured on the menu, because they cost approximately
      nothing to make, and could be played up as a Mexican
      Delicacy. Again he wrote that the east had not begun to
      appreciate the cafeteria. And Myron hated his busy
      meannesses more than he had the jolly scoundreldom of Jimmy
      Shanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was confused, still, and he told himself, not quite
      accurately, that he was coming to dislike everything
      connected with hotel-keeping. Unreasonable and complaining
      guests. Dishonest and thievish guests. Oily guests who
      wanted favours. The incessant headachy effort to save
      tenth-pennies on food. The clever Jewish girl public
      stenographer with her desk on the mezzanine balcony, who
      asserted, 'I'm some little kidder--I certainly know how to
      handle the fresh guys,' and who, when she said 'Good
      <i>morning,</i> Mr. Weagle,' sang it, crooned it, coyly
      narrowing her eyes at him in invitation. He did not the
      more like her because he knew that she was the owner's
      private spy, and was reporting to Fiesel about him and the
      rest of the staff daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He particularly, now, disliked the whole
      cosmetic-beautyparlour-manicure-hairdressing-perfumestinking-powdersmeared
      business that was increasingly important in urban
      hotel-keeping. He was glad that Effie May was out of
      it--back in Mount Vernon, while Luke impressed his Mount
      Vernon schoolmates by possibly fanciful tales of hunting
      bear, wolves, and moose in the shrieking wilds of
      Connecticut. He detested the new fashion whereby women had
      their nails stained so scarlet that they looked like the
      harem. 'That's what hotels are getting to be--harems!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he was guiltily dreaming again of the Perfect Inn. . .
      .
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He saw it now as a small and simple place, for small and
      simple people, but with pleasant rooms, and food that
      should be an event--the real descendant of such inns as the
      Cat and Fiddle, with no bastard union with the Riviera. He
      began to wonder if the Black Thread Inn had not been too
      ornate, and, still more, too dependent on the fickleness of
      that brazen-hearted tribe, the Rich--began to wonder if, in
      his first epic, there had not been too many Purple
      Passages.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in particular he wanted an inn that he should really
      own by himself, and manage by himself, so that if it should
      fail, he would be honestly responsible, and not the victim
      of collaborators with too lush a style.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      His life, in 1929, was complicated by Ora's falling into an
      immense success--call it success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working night and day for six days, with a well-known
      Hollywood actor, clever but now out of favour, Ora had
      written a play, the play of the hour, with all the right
      condiments of the moment: a dash of racketeers and murder,
      a spoonful of sarcasm about Washington politicians, a
      delicate suggestion of Lesbianism, but under it all a
      sturdy romance and a lovely ending which combined a
      passionate kiss with a funny slap at all passionate
      kissing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was accepted immediately. It was rewritten in
      collaboration with a standard playwright. It was tried out
      in a summer theatre, brought into New York in September,
      became the sensation of the autumn, and was sold to the
      movies for eighty thousand dollars. It is true that Ora had
      to drop both his collaborators because, as he explained to
      Myron, they were crooked and did not keep their promises,
      but he found a new one and, late in the autumn, was writing
      another play, with a two-thousand dollar advance. Ora's
      picture was in every paper, with accounts of his lonely
      boyhood, struggles in earning his way through Yale, his
      three years hidden away in a Florida swamp while he wrote
      and tore up sixteen plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of these accounts mentioned the manager of the Fiesel
      Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora had a suite at the Victor Hugo, where he often
      entertained his friend Dick Pye, he had a Lincoln car, an
      autographed set of the works of S. S. Van Dine, and sixteen
      suits of clothes. He took a good deal of light exercise in
      the way of walking from the Victor Hugo to the Fiesel, to
      tell Myron why he had failed at the Black Thread Inn. He
      explained that Myron was right enough in his way, but he
      ought not to try to associate with the smart friends of
      Dick Pye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He even paid back all he had ever borrowed from Myron, with
      interest at five per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that his figures did not agree with those kept
      through the years by Myron. Always, Myron had been willing
      to let 'the kid' have money when in need, but he had never
      been able to keep himself from setting down the exact sums
      in his private account book--along with every five cents he
      had ever spent for an apple. But Ora did not know this, and
      Myron did not tell him, even when Ora chuckled (in the
      presence of Myron's secretary), 'The joke of it is that
      you've always thought I was too much of a wild, dreamy poet
      to be accurate, and you've always hammered me for it,
      whereas, you can see, the fact is that I'm much more
      considerate and exact than you are.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, as he said, Ora <i>was</i> considerate. For he
      waited till the secretary was gone before he added, 'You're
      an interesting case, Myron. Take this matter of your going
      haywire at the Inn, and getting sore at <i>others</i>
      because <i>you</i> failed! You spent half your life doing
      things for people out of weak good-nature, and now,
      apparently, you're going to spend the next half, out of
      weak resentment, kicking about their doing you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron did not answer. He did not, though he longed to,
      shake Ora as he had shaken Dick Pye. He was tired of
      quarrelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Am I losing all my grip?' he whispered to himself. 'I'm
      cranky to guests. I can't get myself to care when some fool
      woman complains her chambermaid has been rude. I'm
      suspicious of Fiesel, who's a decent enough old codger,
      after all. I'm getting lazy, I guess.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was kept from too much fretting by his routine
      duties--and actually, he rarely was 'cranky to guests'. The
      routine duties were about all he could find, so frozen was
      the Fiesel Hotel in Fiesel's cold breath. The principal
      changes he could make were to add his old sergeants,
      Gritzmeier and Clark Cleaver, to the staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in these days of 1929, the height of prosperity (yet
      obviously only the beginning of a new and unexampled
      prosperity, now that America had secured the financial
      leadership of the world) Gritzmeier and Cleaver were going
      badly, and were glad to come to the Fiesel for no great
      salaries. They were of doubtful repute, for Mr. Richard Pye
      had let it be known that they had 'let him down' at the
      Black Thread Inn. Myron felt responsible for them and, in
      interminable nagging correspondence, made Fiesel pay them
      quite a percentage of what they were worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Myron went on, day after day, with the details of
      middle-class hotel-keeping which he had thought to give up
      forever. Yet if by some miracle Fiesel should decide to
      stay in California permanently, he could make something a
      little different and interesting of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was just beginning a day's work with plans for a
      children's playroom, to tempt parents who come to New York
      for shopping, when he was conscious of someone standing by
      his desk, waiting, and looked up to see the goat-like smile
      of Henry Fiesel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, I thought you were . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron got no farther. Fiesel tittered, 'Yeh, I been here
      since six this morning. I came in by the delivery entrance.
      They bought some new ash-cans when they could of repaired
      the old ones. I caught a chambermaid eating candy in a
      linen-room. That new clerk, Cleaver, was two minutes late.
      I checked up on some of the stock in the storeroom. They
      was two boxes of corn flakes shorter than their figures.
      There's too many floor-brushes in the broom-closet on the
      twelfth floor. There's six guests that--I know their
      financial standing--they're paying four dollars for rooms
      that you could get five dollars from 'em, and what I always
      say is, hotel-keeping ain't a charity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He giggled, laid his umbrella on Myron's desk, sat down,
      carefully pulling up his faded old blue serge trousers,
      fondly stroked a small wart on his chin, and rattled on:
      'This high-toned new Dutch chef of yours, Gritzmeier, ain't
      so good. He's only had hash on the breakfast bill of fare
      twice in ten days, and what I always tell my boys is, Hash
      is what pays the taxes. You been advertising too much in
      charity programs. The hotel detective smokes Havana
      cigars--where'd he get the money, that's what I want to
      know. There's a busted soap-dish in the bathroom in 676.
      There's a cobweb in elevator seven. That Dutch chef of
      yours uses too many mushrooms in a mushroom omelet. The Do
      Not Disturb card in 892 has fly specks on it. Your tie
      ain't quite straight. Way I figger it, it's details that
      make good hotel-keeping. Probably you up-and-coming young
      swells never think of it that way, but it's attention to
      details that does it, and that means <i>work</i> and
      <i>hours</i> and not going out dancing or looking at
      theatre shows every night. Good morning. I'll be seeing
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gone, and Myron's chief concern was that he had not
      shown resentment of this snooping driveller, as he would
      have done in days when he was more sure of himself.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Never, from that morning, did he quite feel himself manager
      of the Fiesel. The old man--he lived now in an apartment in
      Jackson Heights--came in anywhere from once a week to
      thrice a day, any time from four in the morning to one in
      the morning, and he never failed to find flaws, no
      difficult feat of scholarship in a hotel of nine hundred
      and fifty rooms which he deliberately kept a little
      understaffed. He used his criticisms as a water-dripping
      torture to keep Myron nervous and busy--only he, who always
      and most tediously boasted of possessing a 'kind of gift
      for seeing right through folks' did not see that this was
      not the best method of getting the most labour out of the
      particular sort of wage-slave that Myron was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron did not want to resign again, not so soon. But he
      thought about it enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesel dashed into Myron's office, shrieking, 'You hired
      this Gritzmeier!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes! <i>Why!</i> That's what I want to know--<i>why!</i>
      Max Sussman, of Sussman Brothers, the wholesale butchers,
      has been to see me. God! I've known Max for years. He's an
      honest man. If he gives a commission to a steward or a
      chef, it's only what's customary. And your Gritzmeier has
      been trying to hold him up for five per cent over the right
      amount of graft! I heard it this morning, and I've been
      looking around. Gritzmeier and your other man, Cleaver,
      have been stealing from me by juggling their food accounts.
      Cleaver worked the cheque in the front office. And them two
      have padded the kitchen pay-roll and drew down money for
      help that don't exist! Well, Mr. Smarty Manager, you and
      your pets, what do you propose to do about it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron knew that Fiesel was not the kind of fool to have his
      accusation wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do their stealings come to?' he said heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I figure about thirty-seven hundred dollars, so far.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll fire them, of course. And I'll see the money is paid
      back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, ain't that sweet of you! But that ain't enough, Mr.
      Manager! I'll not rest till I see those two dirty crooks
      behind the bars! Stealing from <i>me!'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you'll never get the money back. I didn't know they
      were stealing. I don't know what they've done with the
      swag. But I do know they're both clean broke. It isn't
      worth all that money to you to see them in jail.
      Three--thousand--seven--hundred--dollars!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, yes, mebbe something to what you say. But no man
      ever put nothing over on Henry Fiesel! No, sir, I . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I understand just how you feel, sir, but three thousand,
      seven hundred dollars!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well. All right. I'll be merciful. I'll be merciful if you
      guarantee the return of the money, personal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right. Have 'em in, and I'll give 'em such a talking
      to . . .' Fiesel rubbed his dry hands together so that they
      rasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I've got to see them alone. Otherwise I can't be
      responsible. Who's got the exact dope, if I need it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The hotel dick and that public stenographer on the
      mezzanine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right. Let me talk to them.' For the first time his
      tone said distinctly to Fiesel, 'Now get out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron sighed, as he waited for the traitors. He thought
      nothing. There was nothing to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otto Gritzmeier shambled in trying to look jolly. It was a
      ghastly look of jolliness--like the face of a Santa Claus
      coated with thick flour. Clark Cleaver was trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron sat still, waving them to chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what about it?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gritzmeier's great red hands fluttered about his chin. 'Vat
      about vat?' he demanded belligerently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron merely looked unhappy. 'I thought you two were loyal!
      You alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Gritzmeier's eyes were damp, with the rheumy, undignified
      grief of old age. He sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What happened?' Myron said more sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      With endless winding excuses, his accent almost
      unintelligible in his emotion, Gritzmeier told the story.
      Out of work after he had been discharged from the Black
      Thread Inn, his widowed daughter-in-law and three beloved
      grandchildren on his hands, he had got into debt before
      Myron had taken him on at the Fiesel. Then his grandson had
      infantile paralysis. He had spent thousands on the boy--and
      he did not have the thousands. He hated Fiesel, hated the
      sneakiness and the smirk of the old devil. 'He iss chust
      like a stale doughnut in a lunch-room, dat fellow!' wailed
      Gritzmeier. It angered him to think of working to make
      money for that human tin bank; angered him the more that
      Fiesel wanted none of his fine cooking, but only glorified
      hash. And the 'leetle boy' was so broken. He had felt that
      he was taking it out of Fiesel. He had never thought of
      injuring Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not work out his happy plans of stealing without
      someone in the Front Office to falsify the accounts, and
      that one he found in his colleague at the Inn, Clark
      Cleaver.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. I understand, more or less,' Myron interrupted, not
      ungently. On Cleaver he turned with a terrible blazing:
      'But you, you sanctified young pup! You turner on parallel
      bars! What the hell excuse had <i>you</i>?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I just--I figured I could double it on the market
      and put it back. And Otto persuaded me . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All you characters in the Bible are alike! "Somebody
      tempted me and I did eat"! You make me sick, both of you.
      Either of you got any money left?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No-uh,' groaned Gritzmeier.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I'll pay it, God damn you--I'll take it from my
      family for your damned families. What makes me sickest
      isn't you two, with your dirty little small-boy
      stealing--it's the fact that I'm supposed to be an
      executive, and I let this obvious stealing go on--that
      apparently you two didn't respect me enough to be loyal!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no, Chief, we . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Chief! Chief! Get out of my sight! I don't blame you. I
      that let you be weak. Only I'm not a superman. I simply
      can't stand the sight of you, or of myself. Get out!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And he watched some large part of his honesty as a
      craftsman melt away, and he sat there in his prim,
      efficient office lonelier than he had been in all his life.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He paid to Fiesel the amount of the defalcation--slightly
      over thirty-five hundred dollars it came to, when the books
      had been checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that Fiesel suspected him of having been guilty
      along with Gritzmeier and Cleaver. Why else, reasoned the
      good weasel, would a man willingly pay out money? Fiesel
      had never liked him, anyway; he felt, with justice, that
      Myron was a flippant fellow who had none of his own
      reverence for pennies. From now on, he bedeviled Myron in
      every little way. Fiesel's genius for observation would
      have made him a great journalist. For every torn towel or
      loose stair-rod that he had found before, he found a dozen,
      now, and he chattered to Myron about all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this time, Myron had no contract! He had at the
      beginning agreed to wait for a contract till they should
      'see how they got along together'. Yet now he was not
      restrained and unresentful. The loss of Gritzmeier and
      Cleaver had shaken him into recklessness. He would growl at
      Fiesel, 'Kindly take that up with the housekeeper. I'm
      busy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered slightly at the old man's simper. He knew that
      it meant something nasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late summer, he rejoiced in being able to slip away
      for a three-weeks motor trip with Effie May and Luke. He
      avoided equally the Lambkins and all hotels. They stayed at
      farmhouses, and for ten days camped out in a lakeside
      cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back feeling calmer, surprised that he had ever let
      Fiesel make him jumpy. He'd just have it out with the old
      devil; really talk frankly. After all, Fiesel was a good
      hotel-keeper, at least in ingenuity about details. Yes.
      They'd have it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Myron's first morning back in his office, Henry Fiesel
      came squeaking in, accompanied by a square-faced, youngish
      man with grave eye-glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Weagle,' peeped the old man, 'I want you to meet Mr. John
      Eggthorne, formerly of the Blakeslee Hotel Chain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm pleased to . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, you'll be interested in him, Weagle. Because he's
      your successor! As of this morning, Weagle!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Eggthorne smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiesel was watching Myron with all the affection of a
      copperhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as when he had seen Dick Pye among the cobwebs in a
      closet, Myron laughed. His worried face cleared. 'Welcome,
      Brother Eggthorne! I'll have my personal stuff out of this
      desk in fifteen minutes. Be sure and inspect Room 504.
      There's a blown-out bulb there. Good morning!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c34" id="c34">34</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The years of the Great Depression were not at all lean for
      the well-known author, Mr. Ora Weagle. In 1930, '31, and
      '32, he had two plays on Broadway, and half a dozen
      scenarios in Hollywood, to which he generously lent half
      his time now. He made twenty-five thousand a year, and as
      he did not spend more than twenty-seven, he was financially
      comfortable. Early in 1932, he happened on a device which
      made him more famous than all his plays. He created the
      character of Old Aunty Depression for the radio, and in a
      voice sometimes facetiously feminine, sometimes splendidly
      virile, he gave to several million fond listeners the
      message that no Depression could defeat the America which
      had endured grasshoppers, William Jennings Bryan,
      earthquakes, the Civil War, hurricanes, and Henry Ward
      Beecher.
    </p>
    <p>
      He received a thousand fawning letters a day, and ten
      stenographers (paid by the studio) were kept busy
      answering. Sometimes Mr. Weagle drifted in and laughingly
      glanced at a letter and at the charming response he was
      sending, but he grew tired of it, and at parties he often
      complained whimsically of his wearing duty to his radio
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother, Myron, a hotel clerk, had been fired from the
      Fiesel Hotel in New York, and Ora had lost track of him. He
      heard of him, now and then, without much interest--he had
      always tried to be friendly with Myron, but the fellow was,
      and he hated to say this of his own brother, but he had to
      admit that Myron was a suspicious crank. He was told, he
      did not know how accurately, that Myron had also been
      discharged from a hotel in Milwaukee for rudeness to
      guests, and that he had drifted still farther west, with
      his sappy wife and fresh kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would--he was almost sure--have written to Myron if he
      had known his address.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered sometimes if he had been just to Myron. The
      fellow had his merits. He was industrious and even
      generous. But--hell! Curious! He, Ora, the delicate poet,
      was a realist, while his brother, the drudge, the steel and
      rubber robot, was essentially a sentimentalist. Ora saw
      that life was a battle. It was, he admitted, just too bad
      that people were killed in battle, but strangely enough,
      they were! It was too bad that an essential rustic like
      Myron offended well-bred people, but strangely enough, he
      did! And Ora could not change it. He sighed a little, and
      had another drink, and planned to do a novel about the
      tragedy of a clodhopper like his brother who, because he
      was for a while and by chance able to buy decent city
      clothes, thought he was civilized, and then was hurled back
      into his manure heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of 1933 Ora was to spend in Hollywood, continuing his
      radio labours with a new character wittily christened
      Prosper E. Tee, while he prepared scenarios based on his
      own experiences as an aviator on the Roumanian, Russian,
      and Italian fronts in the Great War. He was pretty tired.
      He had slaved all winter on a magnificent book, 'Christ,
      the First Playwright', which his publishers (a new firm,
      for Ora had had to reject his former publishers, as crooks
      who did not keep their promises) ardently expected to equal
      the sales of 'The Man Nobody Knows' or even of Culbertson's
      manual of bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a sound notion to drive out to California, in
      May, with his newest girl, that altogether spiritual and
      entertaining young actress, Miss Dimity Dove, in his newest
      car, a Twelve. (But next year he would have a Sixteen). And
      Dimity, the darling, certainly had earned a rest, with her
      agonized labours of singing in 'Buckety-Buckety-Buck' for
      seven minutes daily and fourteen minutes on Wednesdays and
      Saturdays. What a journey! What a forth-faring into the
      magic of May! New book, new publishers, new
      talkie-contract, new girl, new car, new scented airs of
      spring!
    </p>
    <p>
      'I certainly am a lucky guy! Though I have worked for it!'
      he confided to Dimity Dove. 'Nobody ever knows how an
      author toils! Fifteen hours a day, every day, and all the
      damn publishers and managers trying to do him all the
      time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet with all this promised vernal splendour, the journey
      was not completely successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Dimity Dove was not what he had thought! Fooled again!
      Poor, soft, fluttering tender heart, was it always to be
      the victim of the steely selfishness of women?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dimity said that he was a rotten driver. Dimity said that
      he made her sick by singing 'Wee Rose o' the Rockies.'
      Dimity said that when by ill chance they came on a country
      hotel, he hogged the whole bed--she actually said the
      coarse word, 'hogged', she of the lissom little body and
      grey eyes, so truly, if illegally, named Dove!
    </p>
    <p>
      She made him so furious that he could never think of any
      retort more brilliant than 'Oh, go to hell!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad now that he had planned, before starting, to
      chuck Dimity and take up again with Gloria Gurss, when he
      got to Hollywood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had intended to be very historic and romantic, for
      Dimity's benefit, about the trail of Daniel Boone that he
      knew so poignantly. But Dimity's most appreciative remark
      was 'Say, where do you think we are? Back in the Eighth
      Grade? Going historical--on <i>me!'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a hundred miles, save for the moment when
      he answered 'Oh shut <i>up!'</i> to Dimity's protest of
      'For the love o' God, were you trying to <i>hit</i> that
      guy? Cancha drive on the righthan side?' All that hundred
      miles, a curiously smaller Ora Weagle, nervous behind the
      wheel, inwardly whimpered, 'A mess of pottage--a mess of
      pottage'.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In a moonless and unbroken darkness, Ora was blazing across
      the plains of Kansas. Through the smells of gasoline and of
      Dimity's powder and of candy and of new dogskin gloves, he
      caught the smell of corn bursting the dark earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      His great headlights devoured and spewed out a village that
      was only a general store, a section house, a garage, and
      four cottages rimmed with cottonwoods. Ora was dreaming. He
      was homesick for a home he had never before seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd like to be one of the fellows here. Sit and chin. Talk
      about corn.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And, 'I don't think so much of being a smart literary guy
      in speakeasies,' he grieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sorry, that second, that he had in all his life
      nothing as strong and enduring as this Kansas night, that
      Dimity was nothing but a convenient companion whom he would
      abandon in Los Angeles. Myron wouldn't do that and--oh,
      curse Myron, that hypocritical old Puritan! He'd ruined
      Ora's entire life by his smug correctness!
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was a shame about Dimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his right hand from the wheel for a second to
      stroke her knee, consolingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say, for the love o' Christ, will you keep your hands on
      the wheel, and quit pinching my knee?' said Miss Dimity
      Dove.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was after nine, and Dodge City, with the first possible
      hotel, was two hours ahead of them when Ora shot,
      horn-shrieking, into the prairie town of Lemuel, Kansas.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say, we might be able to find a taverno where we can stay
      here,' said Ora. 'Think you could stand another hick hotel,
      Dim?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hell with you!' snarled Miss Dove.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, hell with you, too! But I'm sick of driving. Ay-up!
      Let's have a look,' he pleaded, as he saw the electric sign
      'Commercial Hotel' hung out across the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came up all standing, and stiffly crawled out, on the
      cement sidewalk. He was so tired! If he could just have
      fried steak and a bed that wasn't too buggy, it would be
      all right. Somehow, he couldn't go on, challenging that
      darkness of cornfield and derisive prairie road and the
      sullen scent of land.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swayed from the pavement up on the wooden porch of the
      hotel, and looked through the plate glass window into the
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Um. It wasn't so bad. Leather rocking-chairs in two long
      lines, with brass cuspidors between, and the pine desk and
      register that revolved on a brass standard at the end. Not
      so unlike the American House of his boyhood, except that it
      was cleaner. Yes, try it. The fellow grim-faced behind the
      desk, the night clerk, looked quite decent. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Ora clenched his hands, bit his doubled knuckles choked
      down a shriek. The grim-faced fellow behind the desk, in
      the Commercial Hotel, Lemuel, Kansas, was his brother
      Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fled back to the car. He was starting it before he had
      settled on the seat. He babbled, 'No, no, no, no!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter with you now?' snapped Miss Dimity Dove.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke. He drove more steadily than he had all these past
      eighty miles. He droned, 'Looks kind of sloppy. Guess we
      better stick on till Dodge City. We'll make it in a couple
      hours, and maybe we'll pick up a hot dog on the way . . .
      Oh, my darling!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now don't get sentimental,' said Miss Dimity Dove, with
      virtuous smugness.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Ora felt old and tired. The one thing in the world he
      wanted to do was to hasten to Los Angeles, that he might
      get rid of Dimity. He was old and tired. He was fifty-one,
      he realized. But on the way to Dodge City he found some
      admirable beet-sugar whisky at a garage, and next morning,
      free of the accusing darkness of the cornfields, he
      nervously assured himself, 'Well, that's <i>his</i> fault!
      Certainly can't blame me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      After a week he had ceased babbling to himself, 'Myron,
      General Director of the whole Pye-Charian chain, a
      night-clerk in a lodging-house in Lemuel, Kansas! Well, it
      certainly isn't my look-out!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He never saw Myron again.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      During his two years as manager of the Alfred Hotel,
      Milwaukee, Myron was not discontented. The Alfred, with its
      four hundred and fifty rooms, had been built in 1900. It
      was astoundingly ugly: a vast cracker box, broken only by
      lines of bow-windows from second floor to top. The dull
      lobby was on the second floor; the ground floor was taken
      up by shops--a cut-rate tailor shop, a 'book store' which
      sold Easter cards and Christmas cards and newspapers and
      magazines of Western stories and almost everything except
      books; a jewellery shop with a gilded clock that was a
      veritable antique for a sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hotel lobby smelled, ineradicably, of soap.
    </p>
    <p>
      No Milwaukee fashionable ever entered the Alfred, except on
      the unfortunate occasion of a country relative's coming to
      town. The guests were travelling-men, merchants from small
      towns in Wisconsin and Southern Minnesota, dolorous widows
      come to help bury cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an American House magnified ten times--and Myron was
      happier there than he had been since his first days with
      the Pye-Charian Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Alfred was genuine. It was exactly what it
      purported to be: a city inn for ordinary people. It had no
      gilt, and the honest menu did not do agonizing things with
      pineapple. The old German brewing family who owned it did
      not expect extravagant profits; they trusted Myron utterly,
      and had him and Effie May and Luke in for enormous dinners
      with Rhine wine. Myron ran the place as efficiently and as
      simply as a veteran engineer runs a locomotive, and his
      self-respect came flooding back like a spring freshet. 'I
      <i>am</i> an hotel-man, after all, by God!' he crowed, sure
      that he knew the whole craft, from carpet tacks to
      <i>truite sauce bleu.</i> And in their pleasant midwestern
      flat, with its sun-porch where she could sit and embroider
      and listen to the radio from the living-room, Effie May
      felt only a little bewildered and lost, and the tall young
      Luke played basket-ball in school, and told his respectful
      new friends about the glories of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the while Myron had a feeling like the strained
      waiting before a thunder-shower, and he knew that he was
      again going to do something exciting, and he began, for the
      first time since the Black Thread Inn had opened, to put
      down plots in his little note-books.

      He was certain that he wanted to do something a little
      different, but what it was, he did not know. It came to him
      quite simply, on an evening at home when the radio was
      playing the lush sentimentality of the 'Tales of Hoffman'.
      He would buy, own altogether by himself, and build up a
      small hotel in a country town . . . without any 'beauty
      shop' by thunder! Then, if he was successful, he might go
      on, might some day own a whole Elphinstone chain of hotels
      urban and rural. But that wouldn't matter if he could, for
      once, make a Perfect Inn!
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant the Barcarole was finished, he strode across,
      turned off the radio, and cried to Effie May and to
      Luke--doing his 'home work' at the centre table, as once a
      small Myron had done it at a dining-room table in a rustic
      hotel--'Listen, you two! How'd you like to go out to some
      town farther west, and own our own hotel, and run it to
      suit ourselves?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Grand!' exulted Luke. 'Then I'd ride a horse!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May looked frightened. She clutched her chair-arms,
      as if to save herself from being dragged away. 'Oh! To move
      again! And to have to make new friends!' she whimpered. But
      she folded her hands in her lap and thrust her head back
      and whispered, 'All right, of course, dear.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He had no particular, fanatic, escapist desire to tuck
      himself away in a country town just for its own sake. He
      did not believe that all the denizens of small towns were
      necessarily friendlier and nobler than city people. As an
      hotel-keeper, he had found all people everywhere much
      alike. It was simply that, with the reduction in the value
      of securities during the present depression, his holdings
      now were not worth much over twenty-five thousand. If he
      had had ten millions, he would have taken a large city
      hotel. He hadn't. And if he was ever to have a place of his
      own, he could not wait much longer, for he was fifty-two
      now, in 1932.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Among the places advertised for sale in the <i>Hotel
      Era,</i> he was most tempted by the very banal notice of
      the Commercial Hotel in Lemuel, Kansas. Though he had so
      firmly stated to himself that he was not, like a movie
      fanatic, tempted by the alleged romance of the west--he
      was! He had never forgotten the exhilaration of going from
      Connecticut to St. Louis, as a youngster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commercial Hotel had exactly the same number of rooms
      and baths as the American House in Black Thread Centre
      before Myron had enlarged it.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      'But will you be satisfied in a little place like that?
      After New York and Philadelphia and Long Island? Will you
      be satisfied?' begged Effie May.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course I will! I like small towns. Why, certainly, I .
      . . Hell, no, of course I won't be satisfied! I guess I
      never will be, you poor kid!' said Myron.

      They drove out to Lemuel in the summer. Effie May lost her
      fear of new environment as she saw the enormous sky benign
      above the living corn. (It was just as well, for her, that
      she did not see a cyclone or a dust-storm.) 'The folks at
      hotels and garages', she admitted, 'are awful friendly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll be the most popular girl in Lemuel', said Myron,
      and not till he had driven for miles did his Rotarian
      enthusiasm strike him as a little comic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke was bouncing with love of it. As his father once had
      done, he saw himself a real Cowpuncher on a Pinto (he
      wasn't quite sure whether a pinto was a hoss or an herb,
      but it certainly sounded swell) and when they got back to
      Mount Vernon (as of course they would, when his dad got
      over his funny ideas about going west) what stories he
      would have! . . . Catamounts. Yosemites. Rattlesnakes.
      Deppities. Gentlemen nicknamed 'Two Gun'. Oh, won'er-ful!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel, Kansas, when wearily and dustily they came into it
      toward evening, after driving four hundred and fifty miles
      since five that morning, was no great city. It looked
      exactly like a hundred other towns through which they had
      driven: the same Main Street, the same two-story, wooden,
      transitory-looking stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It seems--kind of--kind of small!' squeaked Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no, ma, it's dandy country to ride in!' bubbled Luke.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We-ull,' said Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commercial Hotel had been solidly built, by leisurely
      country carpenters: a white wooden cube, with a long porch
      giving on the cement sidewalk. The giddiest thing about it
      was the pot of geraniums on the sill of the large office
      window. The hotel was badly kept. The porch was dusty, with
      loose boards. The office, as they reluctantly trailed into
      it, was dirty; the inevitable brass spittoons were smeared;
      the inevitable leather upholstery of the row of rocking
      chairs was scarred and torn; the proprietor, behind the
      pine desk, was in his shirt-sleeves, and that shirt had not
      had attention from a laundress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron was in a panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of telegraphing to Carlos Jaynes about a job in
      New York. Surely he could always get one, now that he could
      again endure it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His name was not known to the proprietor, because he had
      dealt only with an hotel-broker's office, bidding them keep
      his interest secret. When he registered, the gentleman in
      shirt-sleeves yawned 'Kind of hot for driving to-day', with
      that listlessness that only a country hotel-keeper can
      show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their two bedrooms were fairly dreadful. The beds squeaked.
      The lights were unshaded globes in the centre of the
      ceiling. The pine bureaus were tilted. The rooms smelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I can't <i>do</i> it!' wailed Effie May.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know. Pretty lousy. But think of the fun of making a
      first-class place out of this!' said Myron. 'Look. Take
      this room. Put on a sort of old-fashioned wall-paper with
      little springs of flowers. Paint all the furniture a glossy
      white, and use a screw-driver and a little elbow-grease on
      that bed to keep it from squeaking. Put in a floor-plug,
      and have a bedside lamp, on a bedside table, with
      side-lights by the bureau. Chintz curtains. One easy
      chair--it could be just cane, with a bright cushion. Chuck
      out that filthy cotton comforter on the bed and put on a
      decent silk one. Whole thing wouldn't cost much over
      twenty-five dollars a room--and some intelligence and
      industry, which are obviously what this fellow here lacks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ye-es. And throw out those long tables in the
      dining-room--did you look in there from the office?--and
      put in small ones, and make that waitress I saw in there
      wash her hair,' considered Effie May.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had, for the first time, become an hotel-man's wife.

    <p>
      In redecorating the Commercial Hotel, when he had bought
      it, Myron deliberately kept it as heavily simple as it had
      been. 'I guess probably the greatest lesson I ever got in
      hotel-keeping was when Ora razzed me for making the
      American House into a tea room,' he meditated. The bedrooms
      he changed as he had planned. It was surprising what a coat
      of white paint and ten minutes tightening up joints and a
      new mattress and eiderdown did to a greasy pine bed. He
      added six bathrooms. The office he kept much as it
      was--except that he had the chairs re-upholstered and the
      floor and walls actually washed. It was in the matter of
      food that he went revolutionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had always believed, the more so after peering at
      Europe, that American country food could be at least as
      good as French country food, provided that the proud ladies
      who earned their living by it took the trouble to learn to
      cook. No country in the world had better raw meats and
      fruits and vegetables than America. And a good many years
      ago he had learned the apparently occult fact that there
      are guides called 'cook books'.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not afford a Gritzmeier. (He would have forgiven
      old Otto completely, and have given him a partnership, if
      the red-faced scoundrel had suddenly appeared!) He would
      have to depend on the local talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked out for cook not the most experienced lady in
      Lemuel who offered herself, but the one who seemed least
      resentful at being told that there were things she could
      learn. She was the skinny widow of a farmer West of Town;
      she did sing hymns, but she took chervil seriously, once
      she had heard of it. While he was redecorating the hotel,
      Myron closed it for four weeks, and during that time, he
      stood beside his cook, evening after evening, showing her
      precisely what to do . . . She even got over the notions
      that it was very comic indeed for men-folks to think they
      could cook and that cook-books were all written by crazy
      Easterners.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had bullied her into shape, the Commercial Hotel
      began to serve steaks, chops, roast beef, roast pork,
      soups, coffee, pies, fresh-water fish that would have
      enchanted Brillat-Savarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myron's chief woe had been in persuading the local butcher
      shop that he really wanted the cuts he wanted. He solved
      that. He bought the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      His one complete innovation was to persuade the
      considerable number of old Lemuel couples who were tired of
      housekeeping to board at the hotel, in a special private
      dining-room made out of the frowsy billiard-room, and to
      persuade the few comparatively rich people in town to give
      their parties at the hotel, with special supper-menus
      prepared by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For motorists he had daily new information about every road
      out of town. When he could not get it from the drivers
      themselves, he or his clerk or Luke--suddenly a man, and
      not discontented that if he had not become a glamorous
      cowboy, he was known as the 'best doggone automobile driver
      for a kid of his age in town'--drove out to inspect
      road-repairing and detours for a hundred miles around.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He had the greatest praise that any country hotel-keeper
      could have: The travelling-men told him that his was he
      best hotel in their territory, and they planned their
      routes so that they could spend Sunday there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie May was elected president of the Ladies' Aid of the
      Lemuel Presbyterian Church, and a committee of citizens
      waited upon Myron to ask him whether he would care to run
      for Alderman of the First Ward this year, and for Mayor in
      another couple of years. He overheard a heavy chair-sitter
      outside the office say, 'Best thing ever happened to this
      burg was when Weagle came here and put a lil pep into it.
      Say, in less 'n a year, that fellow has become the most
      prom'nen' citizen in town!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, by chance, on this same evening that his brother
      Ora saw him and wept over him as night-clerk of a country
      hotel.

      Young Luke Weagle, sixteen years old in 1933, had never, in

      the swooping straight section-line roads of Kansas, he
      became a demon driver, and he viewed thereon the Tourist
      Camps.

      'Aw, <i>this!</i> Aw, thunder! You got this licked! It's
      going like a prairie fire! You're making money on it,
      aren't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well then, I guess you won't be interested in it much
      more, and you'll want to start something new!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Maybe that's so, Luke, but what about my going back east
      and being manager of a big hotel in New York again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, them Easterners . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'Those</i> Easterners!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Those Easterners, they like everything so fancy! Gee, dad,
      I'd hate to think of going back to those swell-heads in
      Westchester County! I like it here, where you got room to
      move around! Look, dad, would you come out with me and look
      at Kit Carson Park? That's a tourist camp only a hundred
      miles west. Gee, it's a swell place!'
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'Only</i> a hundred miles? You must remember I'm an
      old-fashioned Easterner. Will you drive?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure, you bet!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed Kit Carson Park, to which that intrepid Wild
      Westerner driver Luke Weagle, took them in three hours, was
      to a professional hotel-man a study of the newest thing in
      the world. It was honestly and completely devoted to the
      needs of the million tourists, from unemployed workmen in
      third-hand Fords with the bird-cage and the radio hung
      outside the body, to Santa Barbara villa-owners in
      Cadillacs, who had as a matter of course given up railroad
      travel and who motored, three hundred, four hundred, six
      hundred miles a day, from Minnesota and Illinois and Ohio
      and Pennsylvania to California or Oregon. Kit Carson Park
      had eighty cottages, each with shower-bath and roofed
      shelter for a car, a community store for groceries and
      automobile accessories, a community restaurant and
      dance-hall. The cottages were clean, the grass between them
      was crisp, and the paths were outlined with white-washed
      stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what d' you think of it?' demanded Luke, as they
      drove homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know,' grumbled Myron . . . Fathers have to
      grumble every so often, for otherwise they would have no
      chance at all in the clear-eyed world of children.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, but <i>honestly,</i> dad, what do you think?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'll tell you. It's pretty well done. But it's too
      hard. Those white-washed stones. Too prim. It certainly
      does provide a fine night's lodging for motor
      tourists--probably better than I do at the Commercial. But
      it's forbidding. Not only would no tourist who was tired
      out want to stay on there for a day or two, but the whole
      place positively forbids him to stay. I know. It's the new
      thing. Fine. The auto tourist can start out at five a.m.,
      and no twisty city streets to bother him. Yes. All right.
      But I'd like to have a place as efficient as that, for the
      fast driver--like you!--but that would also have a view or
      scenery or whatever you want to call it, and where a
      certain percentage of the tourists would like to stay for a
      couple days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice grew strong and confident. Luciano Mora was lost,
      and Alec, and Mark Elphinstone, but he had a loyal friend
      now, who took him seriously--his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't see, Boy, why we couldn't have everything that Kit
      Carson Park has: Low prices. Neat, clean cabins. No damn
      beauty-parlours! Ease in parking late at night, when you're
      tired out, and ease in getting away next morning. But
      different: Much better food--not just Hamburger sandwiches
      and apple pie. Daily specialities in food. Something to do
      for folks you could persuade to stay over a couple days:
      tennis courts, a library, a big terrace with wicker chairs
      where they'd like to loaf, and some sort of view besides
      the level prairie. Well, I'll think about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten miles from Lemuel, Myron cried, 'Hey! Whoa-up! I want
      to go up this next side-road to the left.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure, you bet, dad. Where's it go?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hundred feet along the side-road, they climbed in
      sunset over the rolling billows of the prairie to an upland
      which, though it was only eighty feet above the general
      level of the plain, looked across twenty miles, with a
      creek bordered with cottonwood and willows just below them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Kind of a pretty place, don't you think?' said Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gee, it certainly is, dad!' said Luke.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Swimming pool down there. Golf course there to the right.
      Central building, stores and dancing and everything, with
      rooms for lone drivers that don't want cottages, right
      here. And the best mince pie in the State of Kansas. I can
      beat Kit Carson Park as a tourist camp--you and I can, if
      we work together.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I bet we can, dad! Why don't you buy the land?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did. Yesterday,' said Myron.
    </p>
    <p>
