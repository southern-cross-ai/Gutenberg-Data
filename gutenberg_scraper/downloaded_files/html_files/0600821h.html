<h2><a id="citadel1" name="citadel1">CHAPTER 1</a>
</h2>

<p class="verse" style="margin-left:25%">They trapped the Lion on
Shamu's plain;<br>
They weighted his limbs with an iron chain;<br>
They cried aloud in the trumpet-blast,<br>
They cried, 'The Lion is caged at last.'<br>
Woe to the cities of river and plain<br>
If ever the Lion stalks again!<br>
&mdash;Old Ballad</p>
<br>

<p class="first">THE roar of battle had died away; the shout of
victory mingled with the cries of the dying. Like gay-hued leaves
after an autumn storm, the fallen littered the plain; the sinking
sun shimmered on burnished helmets, gilt-worked mail, silver
breastplates, broken swords and the heavy regal folds of silken
standards, overthrown in pools of curdling crimson. In silent heaps
lay war- horses and their steel-clad riders, flowing manes and
blowing plumes stained alike in the red tide. About them and among
them, like the drift of a storm, were strewn slashed and trampled
bodies in steel caps and leather jerkins&mdash;archers and
pikemen.</p>

<p>The oliphants sounded a fanfare of triumph all over the plain,
and the hoofs of the victors crunched in the breasts of the
vanquished as all the straggling, shining lines converged inward
like the spokes of a glittering wheel, to the spot where the last
survivor still waged unequal strife.</p>

<p>That day Conan, king of Aquilonia, had seen the pick of his
chivalry cut to pieces, smashed and hammered to bits, and swept
into eternity. With five thousand knights he had crossed the
south-eastern border of Aquilonia and ridden into the grassy
meadowlands of Ophir, to find his former ally, King Amalrus of
Ophir, drawn up against him with the hosts of Strabonus, king of
Koth. Too late he had seen the trap. All that a man might do he had
done with his five thousand cavalrymen against the thirty thousand
knights, archers and spearmen of the conspirators.</p>

<p>Without bowmen or infantry, he had hurled his armored horsemen
against the oncoming host, had seen the knights of his foes in
their shining mail go down before his lances, had torn the opposing
center to bits, driving the riven ranks headlong before him, only
to find himself caught in a vise as the untouched wings closed in.
Strabonus' Shemitish bowmen had wrought havoc among his knights,
feathering them with shafts that found every crevice in their
armor, shooting down the horses, the Kothian pikemen rushing in to
spear the fallen riders. The mailed lancers of the routed center
had re-formed, reinforced by the riders from the wings, and had
charged again and again, sweeping the field by sheer weight of
numbers.</p>

<p>The Aquilonians had not fled; they had died on the field, and of
the five thousand knights who had followed Conan southward, not one
left the field alive. And now the king himself stood at bay among
the slashed bodies of his house-troops, his back against a heap of
dead horses and men. Ophirean knights in gilded mail leaped their
horses over mounds of corpses to slash at the solitary figure;
squat Shemites with blue-black beards, and dark- faced Kothian
knights ringed him on foot. The clangor of steel rose deafeningly;
the black-mailed figure of the western king loomed among his
swarming foes, dealing blows like a butcher wielding a great
cleaver. Riderless horses raced down the field; about his iron-clad
feet grew a ring of mangled corpses. His attackers drew back from
his desperate savagery, panting and livid.</p>

<p>Now through the yelling, cursing lines rode the lords of the
conquerors&mdash;Strabonus, with his broad dark face and crafty
eyes; Amalrus, slender, fastidious, treacherous, dangerous as a
cobra; and the lean vulture Tsotha-lanti, clad only in silken
robes, his great black eyes glittering from a face that was like
that of a bird of prey. Of this Kothian wizard dark tales were
told; tousle-headed women in northern and western villages
frightened children with his name, and rebellious slaves were
brought to abased submission quicker than by the lash, with threat
of being sold to him. Men said that he had a whole library of dark
works bound in skin flayed from living human victims, and that in
nameless pits below the hill whereon his palace sat, he trafficked
with the powers of darkness, trading screaming girl slaves for
unholy secrets. He was the real ruler of Koth.</p>

<p>Now he grinned bleakly as the kings reined back a safe distance
from the grim iron-clad figure looming among the dead. Before the
savage blue eyes blazing murderously from beneath the crested,
dented helmet, the boldest shrank. Conan's dark scarred face was
darker yet with passion; his black armor was hacked to tatters and
splashed with blood; his great sword red to the cross- piece. In
this stress all the veneer of civilization had faded; it was a
barbarian who faced his conquerors. Conan was a Cimmerian by birth,
one of those fierce moody hillmen who dwelt in their gloomy, cloudy
land in the north. His saga, which had led him to the throne of
Aquilonia, was the basis of a whole cycle of hero-tales.</p>

<p>So now the kings kept their distance, and Strabonus called on
his Shemitish archers to loose their arrows at his foe from a
distance; his captains had fallen like ripe grain before the
Cimmerian's broadsword, and Strabonus, penurious of his knights as
of his coins, was frothing with fury. But Tsotha shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Take him alive."</p>

<p>"Easy to say!" snarled Strabonus, uneasy lest in some way the
black- mailed giant might hew a path to them through the spears.
"Who can take a man- eating tiger alive? By Ishtar, his heel is on
the necks of my finest swordsmen! It took seven years and stacks of
gold to train each, and there they lie, so much kite's meat.
Arrows, I say!"</p>

<p>"Again, nay!" snapped Tsotha, swinging down from his horse. He
laughed coldly. "Have you not learned by this time that my brain is
mightier than any sword?"</p>

<p>He passed through the lines of the pikemen, and the giants in
their steel caps and mail brigandines shrank back fearfully, lest
they so much as touch the skirts of his robe. Nor were the plumed
knights slower in making room for him. He stepped over the corpses
and came face to face with the grim king. The hosts watched in
tense silence, holding their breath. The black-armored figure
loomed in terrible menace over the lean, silk-robed shape, the
notched, dripping sword hovering on high.</p>

<p>"I offer you life, Conan," said Tsotha, a cruel mirth bubbling
at the back of his voice.</p>

<p>"I give you death, wizard," snarled the king, and backed by iron
muscles and ferocious hate the great sword swung in a stroke meant
to shear Tsotha's lean torso in half. But even as the hosts cried
out, the wizard stepped in, too quick for the eye to follow, and
apparently merely laid an open hand on Conan's left forearm, from
the ridged muscles of which the mail had been hacked away. The
whistling blade veered from its arc and the mailed giant crashed
heavily to earth, to lie motionless. Tsotha laughed silently.</p>

<p>"Take him up and fear not; the lion's fangs are drawn."</p>

<p>The kings reined in and gazed in awe at the fallen lion. Conan
lay stiffly, like a dead man, but his eyes glared up at them, wide
open, and blazing with helpless fury. "What have you done to him?"
asked Amalrus uneasily.</p>

<p>Tsotha displayed a broad ring of curious design on his finger.
He pressed his fingers together and on the inner side of the ring a
tiny steel fang darted out like a snake's tongue.</p>

<p>"It is steeped in the juice of the purple lotus which grows in
the ghost- haunted swamps of southern Stygia," said the magician.
"Its touch produces temporary paralysis. Put him in chains and lay
him in a chariot. The sun sets and it is time we were on the road
for Khorshemish."</p>

<p>Strabonus turned to his general Arbanus.</p>

<p>"We return to Khorshemish with the wounded. Only a troop of the
royal cavalry will accompany us. Your orders are to march at dawn
to the Aquilonian border, and invest the city of Shamar. The
Ophireans will supply you with food along the march. We will rejoin
you as soon as possible, with reinforcements."</p>

<p>So the host, with its steel-sheathed knights, its pikemen and
archers and camp-servants, went into camp in the meadowlands near
the battlefield. And through the starry night the two kings and the
sorcerer who was greater than any king rode to the capital of
Strabonus, in the midst of the glittering palace troop, and
accompanied by a long line of chariots, loaded with the wounded. In
one of these chariots lay Conan, king of Aquilonia, weighted with
chains, the tang of defeat in his mouth, the blind fury of a
trapped tiger in his soul.</p>

<p>The poison which had frozen his mighty limbs to helplessness had
not paralyzed his brain. As the chariot in which he lay rumbled
over the meadowlands, his mind revolved maddeningly about his
defeat. Amalrus had sent an emissary imploring aid against
Strabonus, who, he said, was ravaging his western domain, which lay
like a tapering wedge between the border of Aquilonia and the vast
southern kingdom of Koth. He asked only a thousand horsemen and the
presence of Conan, to hearten his demoralized subjects. Conan now
mentally blasphemed. In his generosity he had come with five times
the number the treacherous monarch had asked. In good faith he had
ridden into Ophir, and had been confronted by the supposed rivals
allied against him. It spoke significantly of his prowess that they
had brought up a whole host to trap him and his five thousand.</p>

<p>A red cloud veiled his vision; his veins swelled with fury and
in his temples a pulse throbbed maddeningly. In all his life he had
never known greater and more helpless wrath. In swift-moving scenes
the pageant of his life passed fleetingly before his mental
eye&mdash;a panorama wherein moved shadowy figures which were
himself, in many guises and conditions&mdash;a skin-clad barbarian;
a mercenary swordsman in horned helmet and scale-mail corselet; a
corsair in a dragon-prowed galley that trailed a crimson wake of
blood and pillage along southern coasts; a captain of hosts in
burnished steel, on a rearing black charger; a king on a golden
throne with the lion banner flowing above, and throngs of gay-hued
courtiers and ladies on their knees. But always the jouncing and
rumbling of the chariot brought his thoughts back to revolve with
maddening monotony about the treachery of Amalrus and the sorcery
of Tsotha. The veins nearly burst in his temples and cries of the
wounded in the chariots filled him with ferocious satisfaction.</p>

<p>Before midnight they crossed the Ophirean border and at dawn the
spires of Khorshemish stood up gleaming and rose-tinted on the
south-eastern horizon, the slim towers overawed by the grim scarlet
citadel that at a distance was like a splash of bright blood in the
sky. That was the castle of Tsotha. Only one narrow street, paved
with marble and guarded by heavy iron gates, led up to it, where it
crowned the hill dominating the city. The sides of that hill were
too sheer to be climbed elsewhere. From the walls of the citadel
one could look down on the broad white streets of the city, on
minaretted mosques, shops, temples, mansions, and markets. One
could look down, too, on the palaces of the king, set in broad
gardens, high-walled, luxurious riots of fruit trees and blossoms,
through which artificial streams murmured, and silvery fountains
rippled incessantly. Over all brooded the citadel, like a condor
stooping above its prey, intent on its own dark meditations.</p>

<p>The mighty gates between the huge towers of the outer wall
clanged open, and the king rode into his capital between lines of
glittering spearmen, while fifty trumpets pealed salute. But no
throngs swarmed the white-paved streets to fling roses before the
conqueror's hoofs. Strabonus had raced ahead of news of the battle,
and the people, just rousing to the occupations of the day, gaped
to see their king returning with a small retinue, and were in doubt
as to whether it portended victory or defeat.</p>

<p>Conan, life sluggishly moving in his veins again, craned his
neck from the chariot floor to view the wonders of this city which
men called the Queen of the South. He had thought to ride some day
through these golden-chased gates at the head of his steel-clad
squadrons, with the great lion banner flowing over his helmeted
head. Instead he entered in chains, stripped of his armor, and
thrown like a captive slave on the bronze floor of his conqueror's
chariot. A wayward devilish mirth of mockery rose above his fury,
but to the nervous soldiers who drove the chariot his laughter
sounded like the muttering of a rousing lion.</p>

<h2><a id="citadel2" name="citadel2">CHAPTER 2</a>
</h2>

<p class="verse">Gleaming shell of an outworn lie; fable of Right
divine&mdash;<br>
You gained your crowns by heritage, but Blood was the price of
mine.<br>
The throne that I won by blood and sweat, by Crom, I will not
sell<br>
For promise of valleys filled with gold, or threat of the Halls of
Hell!<br>
&mdash;The Road Of Kings</p>
<br>

<p class="first">IN THE CITADEL, in a chamber with a domed ceiling
of carven jet, and the fretted arches of doorways glimmering with
strange dark jewels, a strange conclave came to pass. Conan of
Aquilonia, blood from unbandaged wounds caking his huge limbs,
faced his captors. On either side of him stood a dozen black
giants, grasping their long-shafted axes. In front of him stood
Tsotha, and on divans lounged Strabonus and Amalrus in their silks
and gold, gleaming with jewels, naked slave-boys beside them
pouring wine into cups carved of a single sapphire. In strong
contrast stood Conan, grim, blood-stained, naked but for a
loin-cloth, shackles on his mighty limbs, his blue eyes blazing
beneath the tangled black mane which fell over his low broad
forehead. He dominated the scene, turning to tinsel the pomp of the
conquerors by the sheer vitality of his elemental personality, and
the kings in their pride and splendor were aware of it each in his
secret heart, and were not at ease. Only Tsotha was not
disturbed.</p>

<p>"Our desires are quickly spoken, king of Aquilonia," said
Tsotha. "It is our wish to extend our empire."</p>

<p>"And so you want to swine my kingdom," rasped Conan.</p>

<p>"What are you but an adventurer, seizing a crown to which you
had no more claim than any other wandering barbarian?" parried
Amalrus. "We are prepared to offer you suitable
compensation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Compensation!" It was a gust of deep laughter from Conan's
mighty chest. "The price of infamy and treachery! I am a barbarian,
so I shall sell my kingdom and its people for life and your filthy
gold? Ha! How did you come to your crown, you and that black-faced
pig beside you? Your fathers did the fighting and the suffering,
and handed their crowns to you on golden platters. What you
inherited without lifting a finger&mdash;except to poison a few
brothers&mdash;I fought for.</p>

<p>"You sit on satin and guzzle wine the people sweat for, and talk
of divine rights of sovereignty&mdash;bah! I climbed out of the
abyss of naked barbarism to the throne and in that climb I spilt my
blood as freely as I spilt that of others. If either of us has the
right to rule men, by Crom, it is I! How have you proved yourselves
my superiors?</p>

<p>"I found Aquilonia in the grip of a pig like you&mdash;one who
traced his genealogy for a thousand years. The land was torn with
the wars of the barons, and the people cried out under oppression
and taxation. Today no Aquilonian noble dares maltreat the humblest
of my subjects, and the taxes of the people are lighter than
anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>"What of you? Your brother, Amalrus, holds the eastern half of
your kingdom, and defies you. And you, Strabonus, your soldiers are
even now besieging castles of a dozen or more rebellious barons.
The people of both your kingdoms are crushed into the earth by
tyrannous taxes and levies. And you would loot mine&mdash;ha! Free
my hands and I'll varnish this floor with your brains!"</p>

<p>Tsotha grinned bleakly to see the rage of his kingly
companions.</p>

<p>"All this, truthful though it be, is beside the point. Our plans
are no concern of yours. Your responsibility is at an end when you
sign this parchment, which is an abdication in favor of Prince
Arpello of Pellia. We will give you arms and horse, and five
thousand golden lunas, and escort you to the eastern frontier."</p>

<p>"Setting me adrift where I was when I rode into Aquilonia to
take service in her armies, except with the added burden of a
traitor's name!" Conan's laugh was like the deep short bark of a
timber wolf. "Arpello, eh? I've had suspicions of that butcher of
Pellia. Can you not even steal and pillage frankly and honestly,
but you must have an excuse, however thin? Arpello claims a trace
of royal blood; so you use him as an excuse for theft, and a satrap
to rule through. I'll see you in hell first."</p>

<p>"You're a fool!" exclaimed Amalrus. "You are in our hands, and
we can take both crown and life at our pleasure!"</p>

<p>Conan's answer was neither kingly nor dignified, but
characteristically instinctive in the man, whose barbaric nature
had never been submerged in his adopted culture. He spat full in
Amalrus' eyes. The king of Ophir leaped up with a scream of
outraged fury, groping for his slender sword. Drawing it, he rushed
at the Cimmerian, but Tsotha intervened.</p>

<p>"Wait, your majesty; this man is my prisoner."</p>

<p>"Aside, wizard!" shrieked Amalrus, maddened by the glare in the
Cimmerian's blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Back, I say!" roared Tsotha, roused to awesome wrath. His lean
hand came from his wide sleeve and cast a shower of dust into the
Ophirean's contorted face. Amalrus cried out and staggered back,
clutching at his eyes, the sword falling from his hand. He dropped
limply on the divan, while the Kothian guards looked on stolidly
and King Strabonus hurriedly gulped another goblet of wine, holding
it with hands that trembled. Amalrus lowered his hands and shook
his head violently, intelligence slowly sifting back into his grey
eyes.</p>

<p>"I went blind," he growled. "What did you do to me, wizard?"</p>

<p>"Merely a gesture to convince you who was the real master,"
snapped Tsotha, the mask of his formal pretense dropped, revealing
the naked evil personality of the man. "Strabonus has learned his
lesson&mdash;let you learn yours. It was but a dust I found in a
Stygian tomb which I flung into your eyes&mdash;if I brush out
their sight again, I will leave you to grope in darkness for the
rest of your life."</p>

<p>Amalrus shrugged his shoulders, smiled whimsically and reached
for a goblet, dissembling his fear and fury. A polished diplomat,
he was quick to regain his poise. Tsotha turned to Conan, who had
stood imperturbably during the episode. At the wizard's gesture,
the blacks laid hold of their prisoner and marched him behind
Tsotha, who led the way out of the chamber through an arched
doorway into a winding corridor, whose floor was of many-hued
mosaics, whose walls were inlaid with gold tissue and silver
chasing, and from whose fretted arched ceiling swung golden
censers, filling the corridor with dreamy perfumed clouds. They
turned down a smaller corridor, done in jet and black jade, gloomy
and awful, which ended at a brass door, over whose arch a human
skull grinned horrifically. At this door stood a fat repellent
figure, dangling a bunch of keys&mdash;Tsotha's chief eunuch,
Shukeli, of whom grisly tales were whispered&mdash;a man with whom
a bestial lust for torture took the place of normal human
passions.</p>

<p>The brass door let onto a narrow stair that seemed to wind down
into the very bowels of the hill on which the citadel stood. Down
these stairs went the band, to halt at last at an iron door, the
strength of which seemed unnecessary. Evidently it did not open on
outer air, yet it was built as if to withstand the battering of
mangonels and rams. Shukeli opened it, and as he swung back the
ponderous portal, Conan noted the evident uneasiness among the
black giants who guarded him; nor did Shukeli seem altogether
devoid of nervousness as he peered into the darkness beyond. Inside
the great door there was a second barrier, composed of heavy steel
bars. It was fastened by an ingenious bolt which had no lock and
could be worked only from the outside; this bolt shot back, the
grille slid into the wall. They passed through, into a broad
corridor, the floor, walls and arched ceiling of which seemed to be
cut out of solid stone. Conan knew he was far underground, even
below the hill itself. The darkness pressed in on the guardsmen's
torches like a sentient, animate thing.</p>

<p>They made the king fast to a ring in the stone wall. Above his
head in a niche in the wall they placed a torch, so that he stood
in a dim semicircle of light. The blacks were anxious to be gone;
they muttered among themselves, and cast fearful glances at the
darkness. Tsotha motioned them out, and they filed through the door
in stumbling haste, as if fearing that the darkness might take
tangible form and spring upon their backs. Tsotha turned toward
Conan, and the king noticed uneasily that the wizard's eyes shone
in the semi-darkness, and that his teeth much resembled the fangs
of a wolf, gleaming whitely in the shadows.</p>

<p>"And so, farewell, barbarian," mocked the sorcerer. "I must ride
to Shamar, and the siege. In ten days I will be in your palace in
Tamar, with my warriors. What word from you shall I say to your
women, before I flay their dainty skins for scrolls whereon to
chronicle the triumphs of Tsotha-lanti?"</p>

<p>Conan answered with a searing Cimmerian curse that would have
burst the eardrums of an ordinary man, and Tsotha laughed thinly
and withdrew. Conan had a glimpse of his vulture-like figure
through the thick-set bars, as he slid home the grate; then the
heavy outer door clanged, and silence fell like a pall.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="citadel3" name="citadel3">CHAPTER 3</a>
</h2>

<p class="verse">The Lion strode through the halls of Hell;<br>
Across his path grim shadows fell<br>
Of many a moving, nameless shape&mdash;<br>
Monsters with dripping jaws agape.<br>
The darkness shuddered with scream and yell<br>
When the Lion stalked through the halls of Hell.<br>
&mdash; Old Ballad</p>
<br>

<p class="first">KING CONAN tested the ring in the wall and the
chain that bound him. His limbs were free, but he knew that his
shackles were beyond even his iron strength. The links of the chain
were as thick as his thumb and were fastened to a band of steel
about his waist, a band broad as his hand and half an inch thick.
The sheer weight of his shackles would have slain a lesser man with
exhaustion. The locks that held band and chain were massive affairs
that a sledge-hammer could hardly have dinted. As for the ring,
evidently it went clear through the wall and was clinched on the
other side.</p>

<p>Conan cursed and panic surged through him as he glared into the
darkness that pressed against the half-circle of light. All the
superstitious dread of the barbarian slept in his soul, untouched
by civilized logic. His primitive imagination peopled the
subterranean darkness with grisly shapes. Besides, his reason told
him that he had not been placed there merely for confinement. His
captors had no reason to spare him. He had been placed in these
pits for a definite doom. He cursed himself for his refusal of
their offer, even while his stubborn manhood revolted at the
thought, and he knew that were he taken forth and given another
chance, his reply would be the same. He would not sell his subjects
to the butcher. And yet it had been with no thought of anyone's
gain but his own that he had seized the kingdom originally. Thus
subtly does the instinct of sovereign responsibility enter even a
red-handed plunderer sometimes.</p>

<p>Conan thought of Tsotha's last abominable threat, and groaned in
sick fury, knowing it was no idle boast. Men and women were to the
wizard no more than the writhing insect is to the scientist. Soft
white hands that had caressed him, red lips that had been pressed
to his, dainty white bosoms that had quivered to his hot fierce
kisses, to be stripped of their delicate skin, white as ivory and
pink as young petals&mdash;from Conan's lips burst a yell so
frightful and inhuman in its mad fury that a listener would have
stared in horror to know that it came from a human throat.</p>

<p>The shuddering echoes made him start and brought back his own
situation vividly to the king. He glared fearsomely at the outer
gloom, and thought of the grisly tales he had heard of Tsotha's
necromantic cruelty, and it was with an icy sensation down his
spine that he realized that these must be the very Halls of Horror
named in shuddering legendry, the tunnels and dungeons wherein
Tsotha performed horrible experiments with beings human, bestial,
and, it was whispered, demoniac, tampering blasphemously with the
naked basic elements of life itself. Rumor said that the mad poet
Rinaldo had visited these pits, and been shown horrors by the
wizard, and that the nameless monstrosities of which he hinted in
his awful poem, <i>The Song of the Pit</i>, were no mere fantasies
of a disordered brain. That brain had crashed to dust beneath
Conan's battle- axe on the night the king had fought for his life
with the assassins the mad rhymer had led into the betrayed palace,
but the shuddersome words of that grisly song still rang in the
king's ears as he stood there in his chains.</p>

<p>Even with the thought the Cimmerian was frozen by a soft
rustling sound, blood-freezing in its implication. He tensed in an
attitude of listening, painful in its intensity. An icy hand
stroked his spine. It was the unmistakable sound of pliant scales
slithering softly over stone. Cold sweat beaded his skin, as beyond
the ring of dim light he saw a vague and colossal form, awful even
in its indistinctness. It reared upright, swaying slightly, and
yellow eyes burned icily on him from the shadows. Slowly a huge,
hideous, wedge-shaped head took form before his dilated eyes, and
from the darkness oozed, in flowing scaly coils, the ultimate
horror of reptilian development.</p>

<p>It was a snake that dwarfed all Conan's previous ideas of
snakes. Eighty feet it stretched from its pointed tail to its
triangular head, which was bigger than that of a horse. In the dim
light its scales glistened coldly, white as hoar-frost. Surely this
reptile was one born and grown in darkness, yet its eyes were full
of evil and sure sight. It looped its titan coils in front of the
captive, and the great head on the arching neck swayed a matter of
inches from his face. Its forked tongue almost brushed his lips as
it darted in and out, and its fetid odor made his senses reel with
nausea. The great yellow eyes burned into his, and Conan gave back
the glare of a trapped wolf. He fought against the mad impulse to
grasp the great arching neck in his tearing hands. Strong beyond
the comprehension of civilized man, he had broken the neck of a
python in a fiendish battle on the Stygian coast, in his corsair
days. But this reptile was venomous; he saw the great fangs, a foot
long, curved like scimitars. From them dripped a colorless liquid
that he instinctively knew was death. He might conceivably crush
that wedge-shaped skull with a desperate clenched fist, but he knew
that at his first hint of movement, the monster would strike like
lightning.</p>

<p>It was not because of any logical reasoning process that Conan
remained motionless, since reason might have told him&mdash;since
he was doomed anyway&mdash;to goad the snake into striking and get
it over with; it was the blind black instinct of self-preservation
that held him rigid as a statue blasted out of iron. Now the great
barrel reared up and the head was poised high above his own, as the
monster investigated the torch. A drop of venom fell on his naked
thigh, and the feel of it was like a white-hot dagger driven into
his flesh. Red jets of agony shot through Conan's brain, yet he
held himself immovable; not by the twitching of a muscle or the
flicker of an eyelash did he betray the pain of the hurt that left
a scar he bore to the day of his death.</p>

<p>The serpent swayed above him, as if seeking to ascertain whether
there were in truth life in this figure which stood so death-like
still. Then suddenly, unexpectedly, the outer door, all but
invisible in the shadows, clanged stridently. The serpent,
suspicious as all its kind, whipped about with a quickness
incredible for its bulk, and vanished with a long-drawn slithering
down the corridor. The door swung open and remained open. The
grille was withdrawn and a huge dark figure was framed in the glow
of torches outside. The figure glided in, pulling the grille partly
to behind it, leaving the bolt poised. As it moved into the light
of the torch over Conan's head, the king saw that it was a gigantic
black man, stark naked, bearing in one hand a huge sword and in the
other a bunch of keys. The black spoke in a sea-coast dialect, and
Conan replied; he had learned the jargon while a corsair on the
coasts of Kush.</p>

<p>"Long have I wished to meet you, Amra," the black gave Conan the
name&mdash;Amra, the Lion&mdash;by which the Cimmerian had been
known to the Kushites in his piratical days. The slave's woolly
skull split in an animal- like grin, showing white tusks, but his
eyes glinted redly in the torchlight. "I have dared much for this
meeting! Look! The keys to your chains! I stole them from Shukeli.
What will you give me for them?"</p>

<p>He dangled the keys in front of Conan's eyes.</p>

<p>"Ten thousand golden lunas," answered the king quickly, new hope
surging fiercely in his breast.</p>

<p>"Not enough!" cried the black, a ferocious exultation shining on
his ebon countenance. "Not enough for the risks I take. Tsotha's
pets might come out of the dark and eat me, and if Shukeli finds
out I stole his keys, he'll hang me up by my&mdash;well, what will
you give me?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen thousand lunas and a palace in Poitain," offered the
king.</p>

<p>The black yelled and stamped in a frenzy of barbaric
gratification. "More!" he cried. "Offer me more! What will you give
me?"</p>

<p>"You black dog!" A red mist of fury swept across Conan's eyes.
"Were I free I'd give you a broken back! Did Shukeli send you here
to mock me?"</p>

<p>"Shukeli knows nothing of my coming, white man," answered the
black, craning his thick neck to peer into Conan's savage eyes. "I
know you from of old, since the days when I was a chief among a
free people, before the Stygians took me and sold me into the
north. Do you not remember the sack of Abombi, when your sea-wolves
swarmed in? Before the palace of King Ajaga you slew a chief and a
chief fled from you. It was my brother who died; it was I who fled.
I demand of you a blood-price, Amra!"</p>

<p>"Free me and I'll pay you your weight in gold pieces," growled
Conan.</p>

<p>The red eyes glittered, the white teeth flashed wolfishly in the
torchlight. "Aye, you white dog, you are like all your race; but to
a black man gold can never pay for blood. The price I ask
is&mdash;your head!"</p>

<p>The last word was a maniacal shriek that sent the echoes
shivering. Conan tensed, unconsciously straining against his
shackles in his abhorrence of dying like a sheep; then he was
frozen by a greater horror. Over the black's shoulder he saw a
vague horrific form swaying in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Tsotha will never know!" laughed the black fiendishly, too
engrossed in his gloating triumph to take heed of anything else,
too drunk with hate to know that Death swayed behind his shoulder.
"He will not come into the vaults until the demons have torn your
bones from their chains. I will have your head, Amra!"</p>

<p>He braced his knotted legs like ebon columns and swung up the
massive sword in both hands, his great black muscles rolling and
cracking in the torchlight. And at that instant the titanic shadow
behind him darted down and out, and the wedge-shaped head smote
with an impact that re-echoed down the tunnels. Not a sound came
from the thick blubbery lips that flew wide in fleeting agony. With
the thud of the stroke, Conan saw the life go out of the wide black
eyes with the suddenness of a candle blown out. The blow knocked
the great black body clear across the corridor and horribly the
gigantic sinuous shape whipped around it in glistening coils that
hid it from view, and the snap and splintering of bones came
plainly to Conan's ears. Then something made his heart leap madly.
The sword and the keys had flown from the black's hands to crash
and jangle on the stone&mdash;and the keys lay almost at the king's
feet.</p>

<p>He tried to bend to them, but the chain was too short; almost
suffocated by the mad pounding of his heart, he slipped one foot
from its sandal, and gripped them with his toes; drawing his foot
up, he grasped them fiercely, barely stifling the yell of ferocious
exultation that rose instinctively to his lips.</p>

<p>An instant's fumbling with the huge locks and he was free. He
caught up the fallen sword and glared about. Only empty darkness
met his eyes, into which the serpent had dragged a mangled,
tattered object that only faintly resembled a human body. Conan
turned to the open door. A few quick strides brought him to the
threshold&mdash;a squeal of high-pitched laughter shrilled through
the vaults, and the grille shot home under his very fingers, the
bolt crashed down. Through the bars peered a face like a fiendishly
mocking carven gargoyle&mdash;Shukeli the eunuch, who had followed
his stolen keys. Surely he did not, in his gloating, see the sword
in the prisoner's hand. With a terrible curse Conan struck as a
cobra strikes; the great blade hissed between the bars and
Shukeli's laughter broke in a death-scream. The fat eunuch bent at
the middle, as if bowing to his killer, and crumpled like tallow,
his pudgy hands clutching vainly at his spilling entrails.</p>

<p>Conan snarled in savage satisfaction; but he was still a
prisoner. His keys were futile against the bolt which could be
worked only from the outside. His experienced touch told him the
bars were hard as the sword; an attempt to hew his way to freedom
would only splinter his one weapon. Yet he found dents on those
adamantine bars, like the marks of incredible fangs, and wondered
with an involuntary shudder what nameless monsters had so terribly
assailed the barriers. Regardless, there was but one thing for him
to do, and that was to seek some other outlet. Taking the torch
from the niche, he set off down the corridor, sword in hand. He saw
no sign of the serpent or its victim, only a great smear of blood
on the stone floor.</p>

<p>Darkness stalked on noiseless feet about him, scarcely driven
back by his flickering torch. On either hand he saw dark openings,
but he kept to the main corridor, watching the floor ahead of him
carefully, lest he fall into some pit. And suddenly he heard the
sound of a woman, weeping piteously. Another of Tsotha's victims,
he thought, cursing the wizard anew, and turning aside, followed
the sound down a smaller tunnel, dank and damp.</p>

<p>The weeping grew nearer as he advanced, and lifting his torch he
made out a vague shape in the shadows. Stepping closer, he halted
in sudden horror at the amorphic bulk which sprawled before him.
Its unstable outlines somewhat suggested an octopus, but its
malformed tentacles were too short for its size, and its substance
was a quaking, jelly-like stuff which made him physically sick to
look at. From among this loathsome gelid mass reared up a frog-like
head, and he was frozen with nauseated horror to realize that the
sound of weeping was coming from those obscene blubbery lips. The
noise changed to an abominable high-pitched tittering as the great
unstable eyes of the monstrosity rested on him, and it hitched its
quaking bulk toward him. He backed away and fled up the tunnel, not
trusting his sword. The creature might be composed of terrestrial
matter, but it shook his very soul to look upon it, and he doubted
the power of man-made weapons to harm it. For a short distance he
heard it flopping and floundering after him, screaming with
horrible laughter. The unmistakably human note in its mirth almost
staggered his reason. It was exactly such laughter as he had heard
bubble obscenely from the fat lips of the salacious women of
Shadizar, City of Wickedness, when captive girls were stripped
naked on the public auction block. By what hellish arts had Tsotha
brought this unnatural being into life? Conan felt vaguely that he
had looked on blasphemy against the eternal laws of nature.</p>

<p>He ran toward the main corridor, but before he reached it he
crossed a sort of small square chamber, where two tunnels crossed.
As he reached this chamber, he was flashingly aware of some small
squat bulk on the floor ahead of him; then before he could check
his flight or swerve aside, his foot struck something yielding that
squalled shrilly, and he was precipitated headlong, the torch
flying from his hand and being extinguished as it struck the stone
floor. Half stunned by his fall, Conan rose and groped in the
darkness. His sense of direction was confused, and he was unable to
decide in which direction lay the main corridor. He did not look
for the torch, as he had no means of rekindling it. His groping
hands found the openings of the tunnels, and he chose one at
random. How long he traversed it in utter darkness, he never knew,
but suddenly his barbarian's instinct of near peril halted him
short.</p>

<p>He had the same feeling he had had when standing on the brink of
great precipices in the darkness. Dropping to all fours, he edged
forward, and presently his outflung hand encountered the edge of a
well, into which the tunnel floor dropped abruptly. As far down as
he could reach the sides fell away sheerly, dank and slimy to his
touch. He stretched out an arm in the darkness and could barely
touch the opposite edge with the point of his sword. He could leap
across it, then, but there was no point in that. He had taken the
wrong tunnel and the main corridor lay somewhere behind him.</p>

<p>Even as he thought this, he felt a faint movement of air; a
shadowy wind, rising from the well, stirred his black mane. Conan's
skin crawled. He tried to tell himself that this well connected
somehow with the outer world, but his instincts told him it was a
thing unnatural. He was not merely inside the hill; he was below
it, far below the level of the city streets. How then could an
outer wind find its way into the pits and blow up from below? A
faint throbbing pulsed on that ghostly wind, like drums beating,
far, far below. A strong shudder shook the king of Aquilonia.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and backed away, and as he did something
floated up out of the well. What it was, Conan did not know. He
could see nothing in the darkness, but he distinctly felt a
presence&mdash;an invisible, intangible intelligence which hovered
malignly near him. Turning, he fled the way he had come. Far ahead
he saw a tiny red spark. He headed for it, and long before he
thought to have reached it, he caromed headlong into a solid wall,
and saw the spark at his feet. It was his torch, the flame
extinguished, but the end a glowing coal. Carefully he took it up
and blew upon it, fanning it into flame again. He gave a sigh as
the tiny blaze leaped up. He was back in the chamber where the
tunnels crossed, and his sense of direction came back.</p>

<p>He located the tunnel by which he had left the main corridor,
and even as he started toward it, his torch flame flickered wildly
as if blown upon by unseen lips. Again he felt a presence, and he
lifted his torch, glaring about.</p>

<p>He saw nothing; yet he sensed, somehow, an invisible, bodiless
thing that hovered in the air, dripping slimily and mouthing
obscenities that he could not hear but was in some instinctive way
aware of. He swung viciously with his sword and it felt as if he
were cleaving cobwebs. A cold horror shook him then, and he fled
down the tunnel, feeling a foul burning breath on his naked back as
he ran.</p>

<p>But when he came out into the broad corridor, he was no longer
aware of any presence, visible or invisible. Down it he went,
momentarily expecting fanged and taloned fiends to leap at him from
the darkness. The tunnels were not silent. From the bowels of the
earth in all directions came sounds that did not belong in a sane
world. There were titterings, squeals of demoniac mirth, long
shuddering howls, and once the unmistakable squalling laughter of a
hyena ended awfully in human words of shrieking blasphemy. He heard
the pad of stealthy feet, and in the mouths of the tunnels caught
glimpses of shadowy forms, monstrous and abnormal in outline.</p>

<p>It was as if he had wandered into hell&mdash;a hell of
Tsotha-lanti's making. But the shadowy things did not come into the
great corridor, though he distinctly heard the greedy sucking-in of
slavering lips, and felt the burning glare of hungry eyes. And
presently he knew why. A slithering sound behind him electrified
him, and he leaped to the darkness of a near-by tunnel, shaking out
his torch. Down the corridor he heard the great serpent crawling,
sluggish from its recent grisly meal. From his very side something
whimpered in fear and slunk away in the darkness. Evidently the
main corridor was the great snake's hunting-ground and the other
monsters gave it room.</p>

<p>To Conan the serpent was the least horror of them; he almost
felt a kinship with it when he remembered the weeping, tittering
obscenity, and the dripping, mouthing thing that came out of the
well. At least it was of earthly matter; it was a crawling death,
but it threatened only physical extinction, whereas these other
horrors menaced mind and soul as well.</p>

<p>After it had passed on down the corridor he followed, at what he
hoped was a safe distance, blowing his torch into flame again. He
had not gone far when he heard a low moan that seemed to emanate
from the black entrance of a tunnel near by. Caution warned him on,
but curiosity drove him to the tunnel, holding high the torch that
was now little more than a stump. He was braced for the sight of
anything, yet what he saw was what he had least expected. He was
looking into a broad cell, and a space of this was caged off with
closely set bars extending from floor to ceiling, set firmly in the
stone. Within these bars lay a figure, which, as he approached, he
saw was either a man, or the exact likeness of a man, twined and
bound about with the tendrils of a thick vine which seemed to grow
through the solid stone of the floor. It was covered with strangely
pointed leaves and crimson blossoms&mdash;not the satiny red of
natural petals, but a livid, unnatural crimson, like a perversity
of flower- life. Its clinging, pliant branches wound about the
man's naked body and limbs, seeming to caress his shrinking flesh
with lustful avid kisses. One great blossom hovered exactly over
his mouth. A low bestial moaning drooled from the loose lips; the
head rolled as if in unbearable agony, and the eyes looked full at
Conan. But there was no light of intelligence in them; they were
blank, glassy, the eyes of an idiot.</p>

<p>Now the great crimson blossom dipped and pressed its petals over
the writhing lips. The limbs of the wretch twisted in anguish; the
tendrils of the plant quivered as if in ecstasy, vibrating their
full snaky lengths. Waves of changing hues surged over them; their
color grew deeper, more venomous.</p>

<p>Conan did not understand what he saw, but he knew that he looked
on Horror of some kind. Man or demon, the suffering of the captive
touched Conan's wayward and impulsive heart. He sought for entrance
and found a grille-like door in the bars, fastened with a heavy
lock, for which he found a key among the keys he carried, and
entered. Instantly the petals of the livid blossoms spread like the
hood of a cobra, the tendrils reared menacingly and the whole plant
shook and swayed toward him. Here was no blind growth of natural
vegetation. Conan sensed a malignant intelligence; the plant could
see him, and he felt its hate emanate from it in almost tangible
waves. Stepping warily nearer, he marked the root-stem, a
repulsively supple stalk thicker than his thigh, and even as the
long tendrils arched toward him with a rattle of leaves and hiss,
he swung his sword and cut through the stem with a single
stroke.</p>

<p>Instantly the wretch in its clutches was thrown violently aside
as the great vine lashed and knotted like a beheaded serpent,
rolling into a huge irregular ball. The tendrils thrashed and
writhed, the leaves shook and rattled like castanets, and the
petals opened and closed convulsively; then the whole length
straightened out limply, the vivid colors paled and dimmed, a
reeking white liquid oozed from the severed stump.</p>

<p>Conan stared, spellbound; then a sound brought him round, sword
lifted. The freed man was on his feet, surveying him. Conan gaped
in wonder. No longer were the eyes in the worn face expressionless.
Dark and meditative, they were alive with intelligence, and the
expression of imbecility had dropped from the face like a mask. The
head was narrow and well-formed, with a high splendid forehead. The
whole build of the man was aristocratic, evident no less in his
tall slender frame than in his small trim feet and hands. His first
words were strange and startling.</p>

<p>"What year is this?" he asked, speaking Kothic.</p>

<p>"Today is the tenth day of the month Yuluk, of the year of the
Gazelle," answered Conan.</p>

<p>"Yagkoolan Ishtar!" murmured the stranger. "Ten years!" He drew
a hand across his brow, shaking his head as if to clear his brain
of cobwebs. "All is dim yet. After a ten-year emptiness, the mind
can not be expected to begin functioning clearly at once. Who are
you?"</p>

<p>"Conan, once of Cimmeria. Now king of Aquilonia."</p>

<p>The other's eyes showed surprize.</p>

<p>"Indeed? And Namedides?"</p>

<p>"I strangled him on his throne the night I took the royal city,"
answered Conan.</p>

<p>A certain naivete in the king's reply twitched the stranger's
lips.</p>

<p>"Pardon, your majesty. I should have thanked you for the service
you have done me. I am like a man woken suddenly from sleep deeper
than death and shot with nightmares of agony more fierce than hell,
but I understand that you delivered me. Tell me&mdash;why did you
cut the stem of the plant Yothga instead of tearing it up by the
roots?"</p>

<p>"Because I learned long ago to avoid touching with my flesh that
which I do not understand," answered the Cimmerian.</p>

<p>"Well for you," said the stranger. "Had you been able to tear it
up, you might have found things clinging to the roots against which
not even your sword would prevail. Yothga's roots are set in
hell."</p>

<p>"But who are you?" demanded Conan.</p>

<p>"Men called me Pelias."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the king. "Pelias the sorcerer, Tsotha-lanti's
rival, who vanished from the earth ten years ago?"</p>

<p>"Not entirely from the earth," answered Pelias with a wry smile.
"Tsotha preferred to keep me alive, in shackles more grim than
rusted iron. He pent me in here with this devil-flower whose seeds
drifted down through the black cosmos from Yag the Accursed, and
found fertile field only in the maggot- writhing corruption that
seethes on the floors of hell.</p>

<p>"I could not remember my sorcery and the words and symbols of my
power, with that cursed thing gripping me and drinking my soul with
its loathsome caresses. It sucked the contents of my mind day and
night, leaving my brain as empty as a broken wine-jug. Ten years!
Ishtar preserve us!"</p>

<p>Conan found no reply, but stood holding the stump of the torch,
and trailing his great sword. Surely the man was mad&mdash;yet
there was no madness in the dark eyes that rested so calmly on
him.</p>

<p>"Tell me, is the black wizard in Khorshemish? But no&mdash;you
need not reply. My powers begin to wake, and I sense in your mind a
great battle and a king trapped by treachery. And I see
Tsotha-lanti riding hard for the Tybor with Strabonus and the king
of Ophir. So much the better. My art is too frail from the long
slumber to face Tsotha yet. I need time to recruit my strength, to
assemble my powers. Let us go forth from these pits."</p>

<p>Conan jangled his keys discouragedly.</p>

<p>"The grille to the outer door is made fast by a bolt which can
be worked only from the outside. Is there no other exit from these
tunnels?"</p>

<p>"Only one, which neither of us would care to use, seeing that it
goes down and not up," laughed Pelias. "But no matter. Let us see
to the grille."</p>

<p>He moved toward the corridor with uncertain steps, as of
long-unused limbs, which gradually became more sure. As he followed
Conan remarked uneasily, "There is a cursed big snake creeping
about this tunnel. Let us be wary lest we step into his mouth."</p>

<p>"I remember him of old," answered Pelias grimly, "the more as I
was forced to watch while ten of my acolytes were fed to him. He is
Satha, the Old One, chiefest of Tsotha's pets."</p>

<p>"Did Tsotha dig these pits for no other reason than to house his
cursed monstrosities?" asked Conan.</p>

<p>"He did not dig them. When the city was founded three thousand
years ago there were ruins of an earlier city on and about this
hill. King Khossus V, the founder, built his palace on the hill,
and digging cellars beneath it, came upon a walled-up doorway,
which he broke into and discovered the pits, which were about as we
see them now. But his grand vizier came to such a grisly end in
them that Khossus in a fright walled up the entrance again. He said
the vizier fell into a well&mdash;but he had the cellars filled in,
and later abandoned the palace itself, and built himself another in
the suburbs, from which he fled in a panic on discovering some
black mold scattered on the marble floor of his palace one
morning.</p>

<p>"He then departed with his whole court to the eastern corner of
the kingdom and built a new city. The palace on the hill was not
used and fell into ruins. When Akkutho I revived the lost glories
of Khorshemish, he built a fortress there. It remained for
Tsotha-lanti to rear the scarlet citadel and open the way to the
pits again. Whatever fate overtook the grand vizier of Khossus,
Tsotha avoided it. He fell into no well, though he did descend into
a well he found, and came out with a strange expression which has
not since left his eyes.</p>

<p>"I have seen that well, but I do not care to seek in it for
wisdom. I am a sorcerer, and older than men reckon, but I am human.
As for Tsotha&mdash;men say that a dancing-girl of Shadizar slept
too near the pre-human ruins on Dagoth Hill and woke in the grip of
a black demon; from that unholy union was spawned an accursed
hybrid men call Tsotha-lanti&mdash;"</p>

<p>Conan cried out sharply and recoiled, thrusting his companion
back. Before them rose the great shimmering white form of Satha, an
ageless hate in its eyes. Conan tensed himself for one mad
berserker onslaught&mdash;to thrust the glowing fagot into that
fiendish countenance and throw his life into the ripping
sword-stroke. But the snake was not looking at him. It was glaring
over his shoulder at the man called Pelias, who stood with his arms
folded, smiling. And in the great cold yellow eyes slowly the hate
died out in a glitter of pure fear&mdash;the only time Conan ever
saw such an expression in a reptile's eyes. With a swirling rush
like the sweep of a strong wind, the great snake was gone.</p>

<p>"What did he see to frighten him?" asked Conan, eyeing his
companion uneasily.</p>

<p>"The scaled people see what escapes the mortal eye," answered
Pelias, cryptically. "You see my fleshly guise; he saw my naked
soul."</p>

<p>An icy trickle disturbed Conan's spine, and he wondered if,
after all, Pelias were a man, or merely another demon of the pits
in a mask of humanity. He contemplated the advisability of driving
his sword through his companion's back without further hesitation.
But while he pondered, they came to the steel grille, etched
blackly in the torches beyond, and the body of Shukeli, still
slumped against the bars in a curdled welter of crimson.</p>

<p>Pelias laughed, and his laugh was not pleasant to hear.</p>

<p>"By the ivory hips of Ishtar, who is our doorman? Lo, it is no
less than the noble Shukeli, who hanged my young men by their feet
and skinned them with squeals of laughter! Do you sleep, Shukeli?
Why do you lie so stiffly, with your fat belly sunk in like a
dressed pig's?"</p>

<p>"He is dead," muttered Conan, ill at ease to hear these wild
words.</p>

<p>"Dead or alive," laughed Pelias, "he shall open the door for
us."</p>

<p>He clapped his hands sharply and cried, "Rise, Shukeli! Rise
from hell and rise from the bloody floor and open the door for your
masters! Rise, I say!"</p>

<p>An awful groan reverberated through the vaults. Conan's hair
stood on end and he felt clammy sweat bead his hide. For the body
of Shukeli stirred and moved, with infantile gropings of the fat
hands. The laughter of Pelias was merciless as a flint hatchet, as
the form of the eunuch reeled upright, clutching at the bars of the
grille. Conan, glaring at him, felt his blood turn to ice, and the
marrow of his bones to water; for Shukeli's wide-open eyes were
glassy and empty, and from the great gash in his belly his entrails
hung limply to the floor. The eunuch's feet stumbled among his
entrails as he worked the bolt, moving like a brainless automaton.
When he had first stirred, Conan had thought that by some
incredible chance the eunuch was alive; but the man was
dead&mdash;had been dead for hours.</p>

<p>Pelias sauntered through the opened grille, and Conan crowded
through behind him, sweat pouring from his body, shrinking away
from the awful shape that slumped on sagging legs against the grate
it held open. Pelias passed on without a backward glance, and Conan
followed him, in the grip of nightmare and nausea. He had not taken
half a dozen strides when a sodden thud brought him round.
Shukeli's corpse lay limply at the foot of the grille.</p>

<p>"His task is done, and hell gapes for him again," remarked
Pelias pleasantly; politely affecting not to notice the strong
shudder which shook Conan's mighty frame.</p>

<p>He led the way up the long stairs, and through the brass
skull-crowned door at the top. Conan gripped his sword, expecting a
rush of slaves, but silence gripped the citadel. They passed
through the black corridor and came into that in which the censers
swung, billowing forth their everlasting incense. Still they saw no
one.</p>

<p>"The slaves and soldiers are quartered in another part of the
citadel," remarked Pelias. "Tonight, their master being away, they
doubtless lie drunk on wine or lotus-juice."</p>

<p>Conan glanced through an arched, golden-silled window that let
out upon a broad balcony, and swore in surprize to see the
dark-blue star-flecked sky. It had been shortly after sunrise when
he was thrown into the pits. Now it was past midnight. He could
scarcely realize he had been so long underground. He was suddenly
aware of thirst and a ravenous appetite. Pelias led the way into a
gold-domed chamber, floored with silver, its lapis-lazuli walls
pierced by the fretted arches of many doors.</p>

<p>With a sigh Pelias sank onto a silken divan.</p>

<p>"Gold and silks again," he sighed. "Tsotha affects to be above
the pleasures of the flesh, but he is half devil. I am human,
despite my black arts. I love ease and good cheer&mdash;that's how
Tsotha trapped me. He caught me helpless with drink. Wine is a
curse&mdash;by the ivory bosom of Ishtar, even as I speak of it,
the traitor is here! Friend, please pour me a goblet&mdash;hold! I
forgot that you are a king. I will pour."</p>

<p>"The devil with that," growled Conan, filling a crystal goblet
and proffering it to Pelias. Then, lifting the jug, he drank deeply
from the mouth, echoing Pelias' sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"The dog knows good wine," said Conan, wiping his mouth with the
back of his hand. "But by Crom, Pelias, are we to sit here until
his soldiers awake and cut our throats?"</p>

<p>"No fear," answered Pelias. "Would you like to see how fortune
holds with Strabonus?"</p>

<p>Blue fire burned in Conan's eyes, and he gripped his sword until
his knuckles showed blue. "Oh, to be at sword-points with him!" he
rumbled.</p>

<p>Pelias lifted a great shimmering globe from an ebony table.</p>

<p>"Tsotha's crystal. A childish toy, but useful when there is lack
of time for higher science. Look in, your majesty."</p>

<p>He laid it on the table before Conan's eyes. The king looked
into cloudy depths which deepened and expanded. Slowly images
crystallized out of mist and shadows. He was looking on a familiar
landscape. Broad plains ran to a wide winding river, beyond which
the level lands ran up quickly into a maze of low hills. On the
northern bank of the river stood a walled town, guarded by a moat
connected at each end with the river.</p>

<p>"By Crom!" ejaculated Conan. "It's Shamar! The dogs besiege
it!"</p>

<p>The invaders had crossed the river; their pavilions stood in the
narrow plain between the city and the hills. Their warriors swarmed
about the walls, their mail gleaming palely under the moon. Arrows
and stones rained on them from the towers and they staggered back,
but came on again.</p>

<p>Even as Conan cursed, the scene changed. Tall spires and
gleaming domes stood up in the mist, and he looked on his own
capital of Tamar, where all was confusion. He saw the steel-clad
knights of Poitain, his staunchest supporters, riding out of the
gate, hooted and hissed by the multitude which swarmed the streets.
He saw looting and rioting, and men-at-arms whose shields bore the
insignia of Pellia, manning the towers and swaggering through the
markets. Over all, like a fantasmal mirage, he saw the dark,
triumphant face of Prince Arpello of Pellia. The images faded.</p>

<p>"So!" raved Conan. "My people turn on me the moment my back is
turned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not entirely," broke in Pelias. "They have heard that you are
dead. There is no one to protect them from outer enemies and civil
war, they think. Naturally, they turn to the strongest noble, to
avoid the horrors of anarchy. They do not trust the Poitanians,
remembering former wars. But Arpello is on hand, and the strongest
prince of the central provinces."</p>

<p>"When I come to Aquilonia again he will be but a headless corpse
rotting on Traitor's Common," Conan ground his teeth.</p>

<p>"Yet before you can reach your capital," reminded Pelias,
"Strabonus may be before you. At least his riders will be ravaging
your kingdom."</p>

<p>"True!" Conan paced the chamber like a caged lion. "With the
fastest horse I could not reach Shamar before midday. Even there I
could do no good except to die with the people, when the town
falls&mdash;as fall it will in a few days at most. From Shamar to
Tamar is five days' ride, even if you kill your horses on the road.
Before I could reach my capital and raise an army, Strabonus would
be hammering at the gates; because raising an army is going to be
hell&mdash;all my damnable nobles will have scattered to their own
cursed fiefs at the word of my death. And since the people have
driven out Trocero of Poitain, there's none to keep Arpello's
greedy hands off the crown&mdash;and the crown-treasure. He'll hand
the country over to Strabonus, in return for a
mock-throne&mdash;and as soon as Strabonus' back is turned, he'll
stir up revolt. But the nobles won't support him, and it will only
give Strabonus excuse for annexing the kingdom openly. Oh Crom,
Ymir, and Set! If I but had wings to fly like lightning to
Tamar!"</p>

<p>Pelias, who sat tapping the jade table-top with his
finger-nails, halted suddenly, and rose as with a definite purpose,
beckoning Conan to follow. The king complied, sunk in moody
thoughts, and Pelias led the way out of the chamber and up a flight
of marble, gold-worked stairs that let out on the pinnacle of the
citadel, the roof of the tallest tower. It was night, and a strong
wind was blowing through the star-filled skies, stirring Conan's
black mane. Far below them twinkled the lights of Khorshemish,
seemingly farther away than the stars above them. Pelias seemed
withdrawn and aloof here, one in cold unhuman greatness with the
company of the stars.</p>

<p>"There are creatures," said Pelias, "not alone of earth and sea,
but of air and the far reaches of the skies as well, dwelling
apart, unguessed of men. Yet to him who holds the Master-words and
Signs and the Knowledge underlying all, they are not malignant nor
inaccessible. Watch, and fear not."</p>

<p>He lifted his hands to the skies and sounded a long weird call
that seemed to shudder endlessly out into space, dwindling and
fading, yet never dying out, only receding farther and farther into
some unreckoned cosmos. In the silence that followed, Conan heard a
sudden beat of wings in the stars, and recoiled as a huge bat-like
creature alighted beside him. He saw its great calm eyes regarding
him in the starlight; he saw the forty-foot spread of its giant
wings. And he saw it was neither bat nor bird.</p>

<p>"Mount and ride," said Pelias. "By dawn it will bring you to
Tamar."</p>

<p>"By Crom!" muttered Conan. "Is this all a nightmare from which I
shall presently awaken in my palace at Tamar? What of you? I would
not leave you alone among your enemies."</p>

<p>"Be at ease regarding me," answered Pelias. "At dawn the people
of Khorshemish will know they have a new master. Doubt not what the
gods have sent you. I will meet you in the plain by Shamar."</p>

<p>Doubtfully Conan clambered upon the ridged back, gripping the
arched neck, still convinced that he was in the grasp of a
fantastic nightmare. With a great rush and thunder of titan wings,
the creature took the air, and the king grew dizzy as he saw the
lights of the city dwindle far below him.</p>

<h2><a id="citadel4" name="citadel4">CHAPTER 4</a>
</h2>

<p class="quote"><i>"The sword that slays the king cuts the cords
of the empire."</i><br>
&mdash;Aquilonian Proverb</p>

<p class="first">THE STREETS OF TAMAR swarmed with howling mobs,
shaking fists and rusty pikes. It was the hour before dawn of the
second day after the battle of Shamu, and events had occurred so
swiftly as to daze the mind. By means known only to Tsotha-lanti,
word had reached Tamar of the king's death, within half a dozen
hours after the battle. Chaos had resulted. The barons had deserted
the royal capital, galloping away to secure their castles against
marauding neighbors. The well-knit kingdom Conan had built up
seemed tottering on the edge of dissolution, and commoners and
merchants trembled at the imminence of a return of the feudalistic
regime. The people howled for a king to protect them against their
own aristocracy no less than foreign foes. Count Trocero, left by
Conan in charge of the city, tried to reassure them, but in their
unreasoning terror they remembered old civil wars, and how this
same count had besieged Tamar fifteen years before. It was shouted
in the streets that Trocero had betrayed the king; that he planned
to plunder the city. The mercenaries began looting the quarters,
dragging forth screaming merchants and terrified women.</p>

<p>Trocero swept down on the looters, littered the streets with
their corpses, drove them back into their quarter in confusion, and
arrested their leaders. Still the people rushed wildly about, with
brainless squawks, screaming that the count had incited the riot
for his own purposes.</p>

<p>Prince Arpello came before the distracted council and announced
himself ready to take over the government of the city until a new
king could be decided upon, Conan having no son. While they
debated, his agents stole subtly among the people, who snatched at
a shred of royalty. The council heard the storm outside the palace
windows, where the multitude roared for Arpello the Rescuer. The
council surrendered.</p>

<p>Trocero at first refused the order to give up his baton of
authority, but the people swarmed about him, hissing and howling,
hurling stones and offal at his knights. Seeing the futility of a
pitched battle in the streets with Arpello's retainers, under such
conditions, Trocero hurled the baton in his rival's face, hanged
the leaders of the mercenaries in the market-square as his last
official act, and rode out of the southern gate at the head of his
fifteen hundred steel-clad knights. The gates slammed behind him
and Arpello's suave mask fell away to reveal the grim visage of the
hungry wolf.</p>

<p>With the mercenaries cut to pieces or hiding in their barracks,
his were the only soldiers in Tamar. Sitting his war-horse in the
great square, Arpello proclaimed himself king of Aquilonia, amid
the clamor of the deluded multitude.</p>

<p>Publius the Chancellor, who opposed this move, was thrown into
prison. The merchants, who had greeted the proclamation of a king
with relief, now found with consternation that the new monarch's
first act was to levy a staggering tax on them. Six rich merchants,
sent as a delegation of protest, were seized and their heads
slashed off without ceremony. A shocked and stunned silence
followed this execution. The merchants, confronted by a power they
could not control with money, fell on their fat bellies and licked
their oppressor's boots.</p>

<p>The common people were not perturbed at the fate of the
merchants, but they began to murmur when they found that the
swaggering Pellian soldiery, pretending to maintain order, were as
bad as Turanian bandits. Complaints of extortion, murder and rape
poured in to Arpello, who had taken up his quarters in Publius'
palace, because the desperate councillors, doomed by his order,
were holding the royal palace against his soldiers. He had taken
possession of the pleasure-palace, however, and Conan's girls were
dragged to his quarters. The people muttered at the sight of the
royal beauties writhing in the brutal hands of the iron-clad
retainers&mdash;dark-eyed damsels of Poitain, slim black-haired
wenches from Zamora, Zingara and Hyrkania, Brythunian girls with
tousled yellow heads, all weeping with fright and shame, unused to
brutality.</p>

<p>Night fell on a city of bewilderment and turmoil, and before
midnight word spread mysteriously in the street that the Kothians
had followed up their victory and were hammering at the walls of
Shamar. Somebody in Tsotha's mysterious secret-service had babbled.
Fear shook the people like an earthquake, and they did not even
pause to wonder at the witchcraft by which the news had been so
swiftly transmitted. They stormed at Arpello's doors, demanding
that he march southward and drive the enemy back over the Tybor. He
might have subtly pointed out that his force was not sufficient,
and that he could not raise an army until the barons recognized his
claim to the crown. But he was drunk with power, and laughed in
their faces.</p>

<p>A young student, Athemides, mounted a column in the market, and
with burning words accused Arpello of being a cats-paw for
Strabonus, painting a vivid picture of existence under Kothian
rule, with Arpello as satrap. Before he finished, the multitude was
screaming with fear and howling with rage. Arpello sent his
soldiers to arrest the youth, but the people caught him up and fled
with him, deluging the pursuing retainers with stones and dead
cats. A volley of crossbow quarrels routed the mob, and a charge of
horsemen littered the market with bodies, but Athemides was
smuggled out of the city to plead with Trocero to retake Tamar, and
march to aid Shamar.</p>

<p>Athemides found Trocero breaking his camp outside the walls,
ready to march to Poitain, in the far southwestern corner of the
kingdom. To the youth's urgent pleas he answered that he had
neither the force necessary to storm Tamar, even with the aid of
the mob inside, nor to face Strabonus. Besides, avaricious nobles
would plunder Poitain behind his back, while he was fighting the
Kothians. With the king dead, each man must protect his own. He was
riding to Poitain, there to defend it as best he might against
Arpello and his foreign allies.</p>

<p>While Athemides pleaded with Trocero, the mob still raved in the
city with helpless fury. Under the great tower beside the royal
palace the people swirled and milled, screaming their hate at
Arpello, who stood on the turrets and laughed down at them while
his archers ranged the parapets, bolts drawn and fingers on the
triggers of their arbalests.</p>

<p>The prince of Pellia was a broad-built man of medium height,
with a dark stern face. He was an intriguer, but he was also a
fighter. Under his silken jupon with its gilt-braided skirts and
jagged sleeves, glimmered burnished steel. His long black hair was
curled and scented, and bound back with a cloth- of-silver band,
but at his hip hung a broadsword the jeweled hilt of which was worn
with battles and campaigns.</p>

<p>"Fools! Howl as you will! Conan is dead and Arpello is
king!"</p>

<p>What if all Aquilonia were leagued against him? He had men
enough to hold the mighty walls until Strabonus came up. But
Aquilonia was divided against itself. Already the barons were
girding themselves each to seize his neighbor's treasure. Arpello
had only the helpless mob to deal with. Strabonus would carve
through the loose lines of the warring barons as a galley-ram
through foam, and until his coming, Arpello had only to hold the
royal capital.</p>

<p>"Fools! Arpello is king!"</p>

<p>The sun was rising over the eastern towers. Out of the crimson
dawn came a flying speck that grew to a bat, then to an eagle. Then
all who saw screamed in amazement, for over the walls of Tamar
swooped a shape such as men knew only in half-forgotten legends,
and from between its titan-wings sprang a human form as it roared
over the great tower. Then with a deafening thunder of wings it was
gone, and the folk blinked, wondering if they dreamed. But on the
turret stood a wild barbaric figure, half naked, blood-stained,
brandishing a great sword. And from the multitude rose a roar that
rocked the towers, "The king! It is the king!"</p>

<p>Arpello stood transfixed; then with a cry he drew and leaped at
Conan. With a lion-like roar the Cimmerian parried the whistling
blade, then dropping his own sword, gripped the prince and heaved
him high above his head by crotch and neck.</p>

<p>"Take your plots to hell with you!" he roared, and like a sack
of salt, he hurled the prince of Pellia far out, to fall through
empty space for a hundred and fifty feet. The people gave back as
the body came hurtling down, to smash on the marble pave,
spattering blood and brains, and lie crushed in its splintered
armor, like a mangled beetle.</p>

<p>The archers on the tower shrank back, their nerve broken. They
fled, and the beleaguered councilmen sallied from the palace and
hewed into them with joyous abandon. Pellian knights and
men-at-arms sought safety in the streets, and the crowd tore them
to pieces. In the streets the fighting milled and eddied, plumed
helmets and steel caps tossed among the tousled heads and then
vanished; swords hacked madly in a heaving forest of pikes, and
over all rose the roar of the mob, shouts of acclaim mingling with
screams of blood-lust and howls of agony. And high above all, the
naked figure of the king rocked and swayed on the dizzy
battlements, mighty arms brandished, roaring with gargantuan
laughter that mocked all mobs and princes, even himself.</p>

<h2><a id="citadel5" name="citadel5">CHAPTER 5</a>
</h2>

<p class="verse">A long bow and a strong bow, and let the sky grow
dark!<br>
The cord to the nock, shaft to the ear, the king of Koth for a
mark!<br>
&mdash;Song of the Bossonian Archers</p>
<br>

<p class="first">THE MIDAFTERNOON SUN glinted on the placid waters
of the Tybor, washing the southern bastions of Shamar. The haggard
defenders knew that few of them would see that sun rise again. The
pavilions of the besiegers dotted the plain. The people of Shamar
had not been able successfully to dispute the crossing of the
river, outnumbered as they were. Barges, chained together, made a
bridge over which the invader poured his hordes. Strabonus had not
dared march on into Aquilonia with Shamar, unsubdued, at his back.
He had sent his light riders, his spahis, inland to ravage the
country, and had reared up his siege engines in the plain. He had
anchored a flotilla of boats, furnished him by Amalrus, in the
middle of the stream, over against the river-wall. Some of these
boats had been sunk by stones from the city's ballistas, which
crashed through their decks and ripped out their planking, but the
rest held their places and from their bows and mast-heads,
protected by mandets, archers raked the riverward turrets. These
were Shemites, born with bows in their hands, not to be matched by
Aquilonian archers.</p>

<p>On the landward side mangonels rained boulders and tree-trunks
among the defenders, shattering through roofs and crushing humans
like beetles; rams pounded incessantly at the stones; sappers
burrowed like moles in the earth, sinking their mines beneath the
towers. The moat had been dammed at the upper end, and emptied of
its water, had been filled up with boulders, earth and dead horses
and men. Under the walls the mailed figures swarmed, battering at
the gates, rearing up scaling-ladders, pushing storming-towers,
thronged with spearmen, against the turrets.</p>

<p>Hope had been abandoned in the city, where a bare fifteen
hundred men resisted forty thousand warriors. No word had come from
the kingdom whose outpost the city was. Conan was dead, so the
invaders shouted exultantly. Only the strong walls and the
desperate courage of the defenders had kept them so long at bay,
and that could not suffice for ever. The western wall was a mass of
rubbish on which the defenders stumbled in hand-to-hand conflict
with the invaders. The other walls were buckling from the mines
beneath them, the towers leaning drunkenly.</p>

<p>Now the attackers were massing for a storm. The oliphants
sounded, the steel-clad ranks drew up on the plain. The
storming-towers, covered with raw bull-hides, rumbled forward. The
people of Shamar saw the banners of Koth and Ophir, flying side by
side, in the center, and made out, among their gleaming knights,
the slim lethal figure of the golden-mailed Amalrus, and the squat
black-armored form of Strabonus. And between them was a shape that
made the bravest blench with horror&mdash;a lean vulture figure in
a filmy robe. The pikemen moved forward, flowing over the ground
like the glinting waves of a river of molten steel; the knights
cantered forward, lances lifted, guidons streaming. The warriors on
the walls drew a long breath, consigned their souls to Mitra, and
gripped their notched and red-stained weapons.</p>

<p>Then without warning, a bugle-call cut the din. A drum of hoofs
rose above the rumble of the approaching host. North of the plain
across which the army moved, rose ranges of low hills, mounting
northward and westward like giant stair-steps. Now down out of
these hills, like spume blown before a storm, shot the spahis who
had been laying waste the countryside, riding low and spurring
hard, and behind them sun shimmered on moving ranks of steel. They
moved into full view, out of the defiles&mdash;mailed horsemen, the
great lion banner of Aquilonia floating over them.</p>

<p>From the electrified watchers on the towers a great shout rent
the skies. In ecstasy warriors clashed their notched swords on
their riven shields, and the people of the town, ragged beggars and
rich merchants, harlots in red kirtles and dames in silks and
satins, fell to their knees and cried out for joy to Mitra, tears
of gratitude streaming down their faces.</p>

<p>Strabonus, frantically shouting orders, with Arbanus, that would
wheel around the ponderous lines to meet this unexpected menace,
grunted, "We still outnumber them, unless they have reserves hidden
in the hills. The men on the battle-towers can mask any sorties
from the city. These are Poitanians&mdash;we might have guessed
Trocero would try some such mad gallantry."</p>

<p>Amalrus cried out in unbelief.</p>

<p>"I see Trocero and his captain Prospero&mdash;<i>but who rides
between them?</i>"</p>

<p>"Ishtar preserve us!" shrieked Strabonus, paling. "It is King
Conan!"</p>

<p>"You are mad!" squalled Tsotha, starting convulsively. "Conan
has been in Satha's belly for days!" He stopped short, glaring
wildly at the host which was dropping down, file by file, into the
plain. He could not mistake the giant figure in black, gilt-worked
armor on the great black stallion, riding beneath the billowing
silken folds of the great banner. A scream of feline fury burst
from Tsotha's lips, flecking his beard with foam. For the first
time in his life, Strabonus saw the wizard completely upset, and
shrank from the sight.</p>

<p>"Here is sorcery!" screamed Tsotha, clawing madly at his beard.
"How could he have escaped and reached his kingdom in time to
return with an army so quickly? This is the work of Pelias, curse
him! I feel his hand in this! May I be cursed for not killing him
when I had the power!"</p>

<p>The kings gaped at the mention of a man they believed ten years
dead, and panic, emanating from the leaders, shook the host. All
recognized the rider on the black stallion. Tsotha felt the
superstitious dread of his men, and fury made a hellish mask of his
face.</p>

<p>"Strike home!" he screamed, brandishing his lean arms madly. "We
are still the stronger! Charge and crush these dogs! We shall yet
feast in the ruins of Shamar tonight! Oh, Set!" he lifted his hands
and invoked the serpent- god to even Strabonus' horror, "grant us
victory and I swear I will offer up to thee five hundred virgins of
Shamar, writhing in their blood!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the opposing host had debouched onto the plain. With
the knights came what seemed a second, irregular army on tough
swift ponies. These dismounted and formed their ranks on
foot&mdash;stolid Bossonian archers, and keen pikemen from
Gunderland, their tawny locks blowing from under their steel
caps.</p>

<p>It was a motley army Conan had assembled, in the wild hours
following his return to his capital. He had beaten the frothing mob
away from the Pellian soldiers who held the outer walls of Tamar,
and impressed them into his service. He had sent a swift rider
after Trocero to bring him back. With these as a nucleus of an army
he had raced southward, sweeping the countryside for recruits and
for mounts. Nobles of Tamar and the surrounding countryside had
augmented his forces, and he had levied recruits from every village
and castle along his road. Yet it was but a paltry force he had
gathered to dash against the invading hosts, though of the quality
of tempered steel.</p>

<p>Nineteen hundred armored horsemen followed him, the main bulk of
which consisted of the Poitanian knights. The remnants of the
mercenaries and professional soldiers in the trains of loyal
noblemen made up his infantry&mdash;five thousand archers and four
thousand pikemen. This host now came on in good order&mdash;first
the archers, then the pikemen, behind them the knights, moving at a
walk.</p>

<p>Over against them Arbanus ordered his lines, and the allied army
moved forward like a shimmering ocean of steel. The watchers on the
city walls shook to see that vast host, which overshadowed the
powers of the rescuers. First marched the Shemitish archers, then
the Kothian spearmen, then the mailed knights of Strabonus and
Amalrus. Arbanus' intent was obvious&mdash;to employ his footmen to
sweep away the infantry of Conan, and open the way for an
overpowering charge of his heavy cavalry.</p>

<p>The Shemites opened fire at five hundred yards, and arrows flew
like hail between the hosts, darkening the sun. The western
archers, trained by a thousand years of merciless warfare with the
Pictish savages, came stolidly on, closing their ranks as their
comrades fell. They were far outnumbered, and the Shemitish bow had
the longer range, but in accuracy the Bossonians were equal to
their foes, and they balanced sheer skill in archery by superiority
in morale, and in excellency of armor. Within good range they
loosed, and the Shemites went down by whole ranks. The blue-bearded
warriors in their light mail shirts could not endure punishment as
could the heavier-armored Bossonians. They broke, throwing away
their bows, and their flight disordered the ranks of the Kothian
spearmen behind them.</p>

<p>Without the support of the archers, these men-at-arms fell by
the hundreds before the shafts of the Bossonians, and charging
madly in to close quarters, they were met by the spears of the
pikemen. No infantry was a match for the wild Gundermen, whose
homeland, the northern-most province of Aquilonia, was but a day's
ride across the Bossonian marches from the borders of Cimmeria, and
who, born and bred to battle, were the purest blood of all the
Hyborian peoples. The Kothian spearmen, dazed by their losses from
arrows, were cut to pieces and fell back in disorder.</p>

<p>Strabonus roared in fury as he saw his infantry repulsed, and
shouted for a general charge. Arbanus demurred, pointing out the
Bossonians re-forming in good order before the Aquilonian knights,
who had sat their steeds motionless during the melee. The general
advised a temporary retirement, to draw the western knights out of
the cover of the bows, but Strabonus was mad with rage. He looked
at the long shimmering ranks of his knights, he glared at the
handful of mailed figures over against him, and he commanded
Arbanus to give the order to charge.</p>

<p>The general commended his soul to Ishtar and sounded the golden
oliphant. With a thunderous roar the forest of lances dipped, and
the great host rolled across the plain, gaining momentum as it
came. The whole plain shook to the rumbling avalanche of hoofs, and
the shimmer of gold and steel dazzled the watchers on the towers of
Shamar.</p>

<p>The squadrons clave the loose ranks of the spearmen, riding down
friend and foe alike, and rushed into the teeth of a blast of
arrows from the Bossonians. Across the plain they thundered, grimly
riding the storm that scattered their way with gleaming knights
like autumn leaves. Another hundred paces and they would ride among
the Bossonians and cut them down like corn; but flesh and blood
could not endure the rain of death that now ripped and howled among
them. Shoulder to shoulder, feet braced wide, stood the archers,
drawing shaft to ear and loosing as one man, with deep, short
shouts.</p>

<p>The whole front rank of the knights melted away, and over the
pin- cushioned corpses of horses and riders, their comrades
stumbled and fell headlong. Arbanus was down, an arrow through his
throat, his skull smashed by the hoofs of his dying war-horse, and
confusion ran through the disordered host. Strabonus was screaming
an order, Amalrus another, and through all ran the superstitious
dread the sight of Conan had awakened.</p>

<p>And while the gleaming ranks milled in confusion, the trumpets
of Conan sounded, and through the opening ranks of the archers
crashed the terrible charge of the Aquilonian knights.</p>

<p>The hosts met with a shock like that of an earthquake, that
shook the tottering towers of Shamar. The disorganized squadrons of
the invaders could not withstand the solid steel wedge, bristling
with spears, that rushed like a thunderbolt against them. The long
lances of the attackers ripped their ranks to pieces, and into the
heart of their host rode the knights of Poitain, swinging their
terrible two-handed swords.</p>

<p>The clash and clangor of steel was as that of a million sledges
on as many anvils. The watchers on the walls were stunned and
deafened by the thunder as they gripped the battlements and watched
the steel maelstrom swirl and eddy, where plumes tossed high among
the flashing swords, and standards dipped and reeled.</p>

<p>Amalrus went down, dying beneath the trampling hoofs, his
shoulder-bone hewn in twain by Prospero's two-handed sword. The
invaders' numbers had engulfed the nineteen hundred knights of
Conan, but about this compact wedge, which hewed deeper and deeper
into the looser formation of their foes, the knights of Koth and
Ophir swirled and smote in vain. They could not break the
wedge.</p>

<p>Archers and pikemen, having disposed of the Kothian infantry
which was strewn in flight across the plain, came to the edges of
the fight, loosing their arrows point-blank, running in to slash at
girths and horses' bellies with their knives, thrusting upward to
spit the riders on their long pikes.</p>

<p>At the tip of the steel wedge Conan roared his heathen
battle-cry and swung his great sword in glittering arcs that made
naught of steel burgonet or mail habergeon. Straight through a
thundering waste of foes he rode, and the knights of Koth closed in
behind him, cutting him off from his warriors. As a thunderbolt
strikes, Conan struck, hurtling through the ranks by sheer power
and velocity, until he came to Strabonus, livid among his palace
troops. Now here the battle hung in balance, for with his superior
numbers, Strabonus still had opportunity to pluck victory from the
knees of the gods.</p>

<p>But he screamed when he saw his arch-foe within arm's length at
last, and lashed out wildly with his axe. It clanged on Conan's
helmet, striking fire, and the Cimmerian reeled and struck back.
The five-foot blade crushed Strabonus' casque and skull, and the
king's charger reared screaming, hurling a limp and sprawling
corpse from the saddle. A great cry went up from the host, which
faltered and gave back. Trocero and his house troops, hewing
desperately, cut their way to Conan's side, and the great banner of
Koth went down. Then behind the dazed and stricken invaders went up
a mighty clamor and the blaze of a huge conflagration. The
defenders of Shamar had made a desperate sortie, cut down the men
masking the gates, and were raging among the tents of the
besiegers, cutting down the camp followers, burning the pavilions,
and destroying the siege engines. It was the last straw. The
gleaming army melted away in flight, and the furious conquerors cut
them down as they ran.</p>

<p>The fugitives raced for the river, but the men on the flotilla,
harried sorely by the stones and shafts of the revived citizens,
cast loose and pulled for the southern shore, leaving their
comrades to their fate. Of these many gained the shore, racing
across the barges that served as a bridge, until the men of Shamar
cut these adrift and severed them from the shore. Then the fight
became a slaughter. Driven into the river to drown in their armor,
or hacked down along the bank, the invaders perished by the
thousands. No quarter they had promised; no quarter they got.</p>

<p>From the foot of the low hills to the shores of the Tybor, the
plain was littered with corpses, and the river whose tide ran red,
floated thick with the dead. Of the nineteen hundred knights who
had ridden south with Conan, scarcely five hundred lived to boast
of their scars, and the slaughter among the archers and pikemen was
ghastly. But the great and shining host of Strabonus and Amalrus
was hacked out of existence, and those that fled were less than
those that died.</p>

<p>While the slaughter yet went on along the river, the final act
of a grim drama was being played out in the meadowland beyond.
Among those who had crossed the barge-bridge before it was
destroyed was Tsotha, riding like the wind on a gaunt weird-looking
steed whose stride no natural horse could match. Ruthlessly riding
down friend and foe, he gained the southern bank, and then a glance
backward showed him a grim figure on a great black stallion in
pursuit. The lashings had already been cut, and the barges were
drifting apart, but Conan came recklessly on, leaping his steed
from boat to boat as a man might leap from one cake of floating ice
to another. Tsotha screamed a curse, but the great stallion took
the last leap with a straining groan, and gained the southern bank.
Then the wizard fled away into the empty meadowland, and on his
trail came the king, riding hard, swinging the great sword that
spattered his trail with crimson drops.</p>

<p>On they fled, the hunted and the hunter, and not a foot could
the black stallion gain, though he strained each nerve and thew.
Through a sunset land of dim and illusive shadows they fled, till
sight and sound of the slaughter died out behind them. Then in the
sky appeared a dot, that grew into a huge eagle as it approached.
Swooping down from the sky, it drove at the head of Tsotha's steed,
which screamed and reared, throwing its rider.</p>

<p>Old Tsotha rose and faced his pursuer, his eyes those of a
maddened serpent, his face an inhuman mask. In each hand he held
something that shimmered, and Conan knew he held death there.</p>

<p>The king dismounted and strode toward his foe, his armor
clanking, his great sword gripped high.</p>

<p>"Again we meet, wizard!" he grinned savagely.</p>

<p>"Keep off!" screamed Tsotha like a blood-mad jackal. "I'll blast
the flesh from your bones! You can not conquer me&mdash;if you hack
me in pieces, the bits of flesh and bone will reunite and haunt you
to your doom! I see the hand of Pelias in this, but I defy ye both!
I am Tsotha, son of&mdash;"</p>

<p>Conan rushed, sword gleaming, eyes slits of wariness. Tsotha's
right hand came back and forward, and the king ducked quickly.
Something passed by his helmeted head and exploded behind him,
searing the very sands with a flash of hellish fire. Before Tsotha
could toss the globe in his left hand, Conan's sword sheared
through his lean neck. The wizard's head shot from his shoulders on
an arching fount of blood, and the robed figure staggered and
crumpled drunkenly. Yet the mad black eyes glared up at Conan with
no dimming of their feral light, the lips writhed awfully, and the
hands groped, as if searching for the severed head. Then with a
swift rush of wings, something swooped from the sky&mdash;the eagle
which had attacked Tsotha's horse. In its mighty talons it snatched
up the dripping head and soared skyward, and Conan stood struck
dumb, for from the eagle's throat boomed human laughter, in the
voice of Pelias the sorcerer.</p>

<p>Then a hideous thing came to pass, for the headless body reared
up from the sand, and staggered away in awful flight on stiffening
legs, hands blindly outstretched toward the dot speeding and
dwindling in the dusky sky. Conan stood like one turned to stone,
watching until the swift reeling figure faded in the dusk that
purpled the meadows.</p>

<p>"Crom!" his mighty shoulders twitched. "A murrain on these
wizardly feuds! Pelias has dealt well with me, but I care not if I
see him no more. Give me a clean sword and a clean foe to flesh it
in. Damnation! What would I not give for a flagon of wine!"</p>
