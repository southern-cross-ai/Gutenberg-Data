  <br>
  SHOWS MRS. THESIGER IN HER HOME</h2>

  <p class="first">The Geneva express jerked itself out of the Gare de Lyons.
  For a few minutes the lights of outer Paris twinkled past its windows and
  then with a spring it reached the open night. The jolts and lurches merged
  into one regular purposeful throb, the shrieks of the wheels, the clatter of
  the coaches, into one continuous hum. And already in the upper berth of her
  compartment Mrs. Thesiger was asleep. The noise of a train had no unrest for
  her. Indeed, a sleeping compartment in a Continental express was the most
  permanent home which Mrs. Thesiger had possessed for a good many more years
  than she would have cared to acknowledge. She spent her life in hotels with
  her daughter for an unconsidered companion. From a winter in Vienna or in
  Rome she passed to a spring at Venice or at Constantinople, thence to a June
  in Paris, a July and August at the bathing places, a September at Aix, an
  autumn in Paris again. But always she came back to the sleeping-car. It was
  the one familiar room which was always ready for her; and though the prospect
  from its windows changed, it was the one room she knew which had always the
  same look, the same cramped space, the same furniture &mdash; the one room
  where, the moment she stepped into it, she was at home.</p>

  <p>Yet on this particular journey she woke while it was yet dark. A noise
  slight in comparison to the clatter of the train, but distinct in character
  and quite near, told her at once what had disturbed her. Some one was moving
  stealthily in the compartment &mdash; her daughter. That was all. But Mrs.
  Thesiger lay quite still, and, as would happen to her at times, a sudden
  terror gripped her by the heart. She heard the girl beneath her, dressing
  very quietly, subduing the rustle of her garments, even the sound of her
  breathing.</p>

  <p>"How much does she know?" Mrs. Thesiger asked of herself; and her heart
  sank and she dared not answer.</p>

  <p>The rustling ceased. A sharp click was heard, and the next moment through
  a broad pane of glass a faint twilight crept into the carriage. The blind had
  been raised from one of the windows. It was two o'clock on a morning of July
  and the dawn was breaking. Very swiftly the daylight broadened, and against
  the window there came into view the profile of a girl's head and face. Seen
  as Mrs. Thesiger saw it, with the light still dim behind it, it was black
  like an ancient daguerreotype. It was also as motionless and as grave.</p>

  <p>"How much does she know?"</p>

  <p>The question would thrust itself into the mother's thoughts. She watched
  her daughter intently from the dark corner where her head lay, thinking that
  with the broadening of the day she might read the answer in that still face.
  But she read nothing even when every feature was revealed in the clear dead
  light, for the face which she saw was the face of one who lived much apart
  within itself, building amongst her own dreams as a child builds upon the
  sand and pays no heed to those who pass. And to none of her dreams had Mrs.
  Thesiger the key. Deliberately her daughter had withdrawn herself amongst
  them, and they had given her this return for her company. They had kept her
  fresh and gentle in a circle where freshness was soon lost and gentleness put
  aside.</p>

  <p>Sylvia Thesiger was at this time seventeen, although her mother dressed
  her to look younger, and even then overdressed her like a toy. It was of a
  piece with the nature of the girl that, in this matter as in the rest, she
  made no protest. She foresaw the scene, the useless scene, which would follow
  upon her protest, exclamations against her ingratitude, abuse for her
  impertinence, and very likely a facile shower of tears at the end; and her
  dignity forbade her to enter upon it. She just let her mother dress her as
  she chose, and she withdrew just a little more into the secret chamber of her
  dreams. She sat now looking steadily out of the window, with her eyes
  uplifted and aloof, in a fashion which had become natural to her, and her
  mother was seized with a pang of envy at the girl's beauty. For beauty Sylvia
  Thesiger had, uncommon in its quality rather than in its degree. From the
  temples to the round point of her chin the contour of her face described a
  perfect oval. Her forehead was broad and low and her hair, which in color was
  a dark chestnut, parted in the middle, whence it rippled in two thick daring
  waves to the ears, a fashion which noticeably became her, and it was gathered
  behind into a plait which lay rather low upon the nape of her neck. Her eyes
  were big, of a dark gray hue and very quiet in their scrutiny; her mouth,
  small and provoking. It provoked, when still, with the promise of a very
  winning smile, and the smile itself was not so frequent but that it provoked
  a desire to summon it to her lips again. It had a way of hesitating, as
  though Sylvia were not sure whether she would smile or not; and when she had
  made up her mind, it dimpled her cheeks and transfigured her whole face, and
  revealed in her tenderness and a sense of humor. Her complexion was pale, but
  clear, her figure was slender and active, but without angularities, and she
  was of the middle height. Yet the quality which the eye first remarked in her
  was not so much her beauty, as a certain purity, a look almost of the
  Madonna, a certainty, one might say, that even in the circle in which she
  moved, she had kept herself unspotted from the world.</p>

  <p>Thus she looked as she sat by the carriage window. But as the train drew
  near to Ambérieu, the air brightened and the sunlight ministered to her
  beauty like a careful handmaid, touching her pale cheeks to a rosy warmth,
  giving a luster to her hair, and humaning her to a smile. Sylvia sat forward
  a little, as though to meet the sunlight, then she turned toward the carriage
  and saw her mother's eyes intently watching her.</p>

  <p>"You are awake?" she said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes, child. You woke me."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry. I was as quiet as I could be. I could not sleep."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Mrs. Thesiger repeated the question with insistence. "Why couldn't
  you sleep?"</p>

  <p>"We are traveling to Chamonix," replied Sylvia. "I have been thinking of
  it all night," and though she smiled in all sincerity, Mrs. Thesiger doubted.
  She lay silent for a little while. Then she said, with a detachment perhaps
  slightly too marked:</p>

  <p>"We left Trouville in a hurry yesterday, didn't we?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Sylvia, "I suppose we did," and she spoke as though this
  was the first time that she had given the matter a thought.</p>

  <p>"Trouville was altogether too hot," said Mrs. Thesiger; and again silence
  followed. But Mrs. Thesiger was not content. "How much does she know?" she
  speculated again, and was driven on to find an answer. She raised herself
  upon her elbow, and while rearranging her pillow said carelessly:</p>

  <p>"Sylvia, our last morning at Trouville you were reading a book which
  seemed to interest you very much."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Sylvia volunteered no information about that book.</p>

  <p>"You brought it down to the sands. So I suppose you never noticed a
  strange-looking couple who passed along the deal boards just in front of us."
  Mrs. Thesiger laughed and her head fell back upon her pillow. But during that
  movement her eyes had never left her daughter's face. "A middle-aged man with
  stiff gray hair, a stiff, prim face, and a figure like a ramrod. Oh, there
  never was anything so stiff." A noticeable bitterness began to sound in her
  voice and increased as she went on. "There was an old woman with him as
  precise and old-fashioned as himself. But you didn't see them? I never saw
  anything so ludicrous as that couple, austere and provincial as their
  clothes, walking along the deal boards between the rows of smart people."
  Mrs. Thesiger laughed as she recalled the picture. "They must have come from
  the Provinces. I could imagine them living in a chateau on a hill overlooking
  some tiny village in &mdash; where shall we say?" She hesitated for a moment,
  and then with an air of audacity she shot the word from her lips &mdash; "in
  Provence."</p>

  <p>The name, however, had evidently no significance for Sylvia, and Mrs.
  Thesiger was relieved of her fears.</p>

  <p>"But you didn't see them," she repeated, with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did," said Sylvia, and brought her mother up on her elbow again.
  "It struck me that the old lady must be some great lady of a past day. The
  man bowed to you and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped abruptly, but her mother completed the sentence with a
  vindictiveness she made little effort to conceal.</p>

  <p>"And the great lady did not, but stared in the way great ladies have. Yes,
  I had met the man &mdash; once &mdash; in Paris," and she lay back again upon
  her pillow, watching her daughter. But Sylvia showed no curiosity and no
  pain. It was not the first time when people passed her mother that she had
  seen the man bow and the woman ignore. Rather she had come to expect it. She
  took her book from her berth and opened it.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thesiger was satisfied. Sylvia clearly did not suspect that it was
  just the appearance of that stiff, old-fashioned couple which had driven her
  out of Trouville a good month before her time &mdash; her, Mrs. Thesiger of
  the many friends. She fell to wondering what in the world had brought M. de
  Camours and his mother to that watering place amongst the brilliant and the
  painted women. She laughed again at the odd picture they had made, and her
  thoughts went back over twenty years to the time when she had been the wife
  of M. de Camours in the château overlooking the village in Provence, and M.
  de Camours' mother had watched her with an unceasing jealousy. Much had
  happened since those days. Madame de Camours' watchings had not been in vain,
  a decree had been obtained from the Pope annulling the marriage. Much had
  happened. But even after twenty years the memory of that formal life in the
  Provencal château was vivid enough; and Mrs. Thesiger yawned. Then she
  laughed. Monsieur de Camours and his mother had always been able to make
  people yawn.</p>

  <p>"So you are glad that we are going to Chamonix, Sylvia &mdash; so glad
  that you couldn't sleep?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>It sounded rather unaccountable to Mrs. Thesiger, but then Sylvia was to
  her a rather unaccountable child. She turned her face to the wall and fell
  asleep.</p>

  <p>Sylvia's explanation, however, happened to be true. Chamonix meant the
  great range of Mont Blanc, and Sylvia Thesiger had the passion for mountains
  in her blood. The first appearance of their distant snows stirred her as no
  emotion ever had, so that she came to date her life by these appearances
  rather than by the calendar of months and days. The morning when from the
  hotel windows at Glion she had first seen the twin peaks of the Dent du Midi
  towering in silver high above a blue corner of the Lake of Geneva, formed one
  memorable date. Once, too, in the winter-time, as the Rome express stopped at
  three o'clock in the morning at the frontier on the Italian side of the Mont
  Cenis tunnel, she had carefully lifted the blind on the right-hand side of
  the sleeping compartment and had seen a great wall of mountains tower up in a
  clear frosty moonlight from great buttresses of black rock to delicate
  pinnacles of ice soaring infinite miles away into a cloudless sky of blue.
  She had come near to tears that night as she looked from the window; such a
  tumult of vague longings rushed suddenly in upon her and uplifted her. She
  was made aware of dim uncomprehended thoughts stirring in the depths of her
  being, and her soul was drawn upward to those glittering spires, as to
  enchanted magnets. Ever afterward Sylvia looked forward, through weeks, to
  those few moments in her mother's annual itinerary, and prayed with all her
  heart that the night might be clear of mist and rain.</p>

  <p>She sat now at the window with no thought of Trouville or their hurried
  flight. With each throb of the carriage-wheels the train flashed nearer to
  Chamonix. She opened the book which lay upon her lap &mdash; the book in
  which she had been so interested when Monsieur de Camours and his mother
  passed her by. It was a volume of the "Alpine Journal," more than twenty
  years old, and she could not open it but some exploit of the pioneers took
  her eyes, some history of a first ascent of an unclimbed peak. Such a history
  she read now. She was engrossed in it, and yet at times a little frown of
  annoyance wrinkled her forehead. She gave an explanation of her annoyance;
  for once she exclaimed half aloud, "Oh, if only he wouldn't be so
  <i>funny</i>!" The author was indeed being very funny, and to her thinking
  never so funny as when the narrative should have been most engrossing. She
  was reading the account of the first ascent of an aiguille in the Chamonix
  district, held by guides to be impossible and conquered at last by a party of
  amateurs. In spite of its humor Sylvia Thesiger was thrilled by it. She
  envied the three men who had taken part in that ascent, envied them their
  courage, their comradeship, their bivouacs in the open air beside glowing
  fires, on some high shelf of rock above the snows. But most of all her
  imagination was touched by the leader of that expedition, the man who
  sometimes alone, sometimes in company, had made sixteen separate attacks upon
  that peak. He stared from the pages of the volume &mdash; Gabriel Strood.
  Something of his great reach of limb, of his activity, of his endurance, she
  was able to realize. Moreover he had a particular blemish which gave to him a
  particular interest in her eyes, for it would have deterred most men
  altogether from his pursuit and it greatly hampered him. And yet in spite of
  it, he had apparently for some seasons stood prominent in the Alpine
  fraternity. Gabriel Strood was afflicted with a weakness in the muscles of
  one thigh. Sylvia, according to her custom, began to picture him, began to
  talk with him.</p>

  <p>She wondered whether he was glad to have reached that summit, or whether
  he was not on the whole rather sorry &mdash; sorry for having lost out of his
  life a great and never-flagging interest. She looked through the subsequent
  papers in the volume, but could find no further mention of his name. She
  perplexed her fancies that morning. She speculated whether having made this
  climb he had stopped and climbed no more; or whether he might not get out of
  this very train on to the platform at Chamonix. But as the train slowed down
  near to Annemasse, she remembered that the exploit of which she had read had
  taken place more than twenty years ago.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2"
     id="chap2"><small>CHAPTER 2</small></a><br>
  <br>
  INTRODUCES ONE OF STROOD'S SUCCESSORS</h2>

  <p class="first">But though Gabriel Strood occupied no seat in that train,
  one of his successors was traveling by it to Chamonix after an absence of
  four years. Of those four years Captain Chayne had passed the last two among
  the coal-stacks of Aden, with the yellow land of Arabia at his back, longing
  each day for this particular morning, and keeping his body lithe and strong
  against its coming. He left the train at Annemasse, and crossing the rails to
  the buffet, sat down at the table next to that which Mrs. Thesiger and her
  daughter already occupied.</p>

  <p>He glanced at them, placed them in their category, and looked away,
  utterly uninterested. They belonged to the great class of the continental
  wanderers, people of whom little is known and everything suspected &mdash;
  people with no kinsfolk, who flit from hotel to hotel and gather about them
  for a season the knowing middle-aged men and the ignorant young ones, and
  perhaps here and there an unwary woman deceived by the more than fashionable
  cut of their clothes. The mother he put down as nearer forty than thirty, and
  engaged in a struggle against odds to look nearer twenty than thirty. The
  daughter's face Chayne could not see, for it was bent persistently over a
  book. But he thought of a big doll in a Christmas toy-shop. From her delicate
  bronze shoes to her large hat of mauve tulle everything that she wore was
  unsuitable. The frock with its elaborations of lace and ribbons might have
  passed on the deal boards of Trouville. Here at Annemasse her superfineness
  condemned her.</p>

  <p>Chayne would have thought no more of her, but as he passed her table on
  his way out of the buffet his eyes happened to fall on the book which so
  engrossed her. There was a diagram upon the page with which he was familiar.
  She was reading an old volume of the "Alpine Journal." Chayne was puzzled
  &mdash; there was so marked a contradiction between her outward appearance
  and her intense absorption in such a subject as Alpine adventure. He turned
  at the door and looked back. Sylvia Thesiger had raised her head and was
  looking straight at him. Thus their eyes met, and did more than meet.</p>

  <p>Chayne, surprised as he had been by the book which she was reading, was
  almost startled by the gentle and rather wistful beauty of the face which she
  now showed to him. He had been prepared at the best for a fresh edition of
  the mother's worn and feverish prettiness. What he saw was distinct in
  quality. It seemed to him that an actual sympathy and friendliness looked out
  from her dark and quiet eyes, as though by instinct she understood with what
  an eager exultation he set out upon his holiday. Sylvia, indeed, living as
  she did within herself, was inclined to hero-worship naturally; and Chayne
  was of the type to which, to some extent through contrast with the run of her
  acquaintance, she gave a high place in her thoughts. A spare, tall man,
  clear- eyed and clean of feature, with a sufficient depth of shoulder and
  wonderfully light of foot, he had claimed her eyes the moment that he entered
  the buffet. Covertly she had watched him, and covertly she had sympathized
  with the keen enjoyment which his brown face betrayed. She had no doubts in
  her mind as to the intention of his holiday; and as their eyes met now
  involuntarily, a smile began to hesitate upon her lips. Then she became aware
  of the buffet, and her ignorance of the man at whom she looked, and, with a
  sudden mortification, of her own over-elaborate appearance. Her face flushed,
  and she lowered it again somewhat quickly to the pages of her book. But it
  was as though for a second they had spoken.</p>

  <p>Chayne, however, forgot Sylvia Thesiger. As the train moved on to Le Fayet
  he was thinking only of the plans which he had made, of the new expeditions
  which were to be undertaken, of his friend John Lattery and his guide Michel
  Revailloud who would be waiting for him upon the platform of Chamonix. He had
  seen neither of them for four years. The electric train carried the travelers
  up from Le Fayet. The snow-ridges and peaks came into view; the dirt-strewn
  Glacier des Bossons shot out a tongue of blue ice almost to the edge of the
  railway track, and a few minutes afterward the train stopped at the platform
  of Chamonix.</p>

  <p>Chayne jumped down from his carriage and at once suffered the first of his
  disappointments. Michel Revailloud was on the platform to meet him, but it
  was a Michel Revailloud whom he hardly knew, a Michel Revailloud grown very
  old. Revailloud was only fifty-two years of age, but during Chayne's absence
  the hardships of his life had taken their toll of his vigor remorselessly.
  Instead of the upright, active figure which Chayne so well remembered, he saw
  in front of him a little man with bowed shoulders, red-rimmed eyes, and a
  withered face seamed with tiny wrinkles.</p>

  <p>At this moment, however, Michel's pleasure at once more seeing his old
  patron gave to him at all events some look of his former alertness, and as
  the two men shook hands he cried:</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, but I am glad to see you! You have been too long away from
  Chamonix. But you have not changed. No, you have not changed."</p>

  <p>In his voice there was without doubt a note of wistfulness. "I would I
  could say as much for myself." That regret was as audible to Chayne as though
  it had been uttered. But he closed his ears to it. He began to talk eagerly
  of his plans. There were familiar peaks to be climbed again and some new
  expeditions to be attempted.</p>

  <p>"I thought we might try a new route up the Aiguille sans Nom," he
  suggested, and Michel assented but slowly, without the old heartiness and
  without that light in his face which the suggestion of something new used
  always to kindle. But again Chayne shut his ears.</p>

  <p>"I was very lucky to find you here," he went on cheerily. "I wrote so late
  that I hardly hoped for it."</p>

  <p>Michel replied with some embarrassment:</p>

  <p>"I do not climb with every one, monsieur. I hoped perhaps that one of my
  old patrons would want me. So I waited."</p>

  <p>Chayne looked round the platform for his friend.</p>

  <p>"And Monsieur Lattery?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The guide's face lit up.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Lattery? Is he coming too? It will be the old days once
  more."</p>

  <p>"Coming? He is here now. He wrote to me from Zermatt that he would be
  here."</p>

  <p>Revailloud shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He is not in Chamonix, monsieur."</p>

  <p>Chayne experienced his second disappointment that morning, and it quite
  chilled him. He had come prepared to walk the heights like a god in the
  perfection of enjoyment for just six weeks. And here was his guide grown old;
  and his friend, the comrade of so many climbs, so many bivouacs above the
  snow- line, had failed to keep his tryst.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps there will be a letter from him at Couttet's," said Chayne, and
  the two men walked through the streets to the hotel. There was no letter, but
  on the other hand there was a telegram. Chayne tore it open.</p>

  <p>"Yes it's from Lattery," he said, as he glanced first at the signature.
  Then he read the telegram and his face grew very grave. Lattery telegraphed
  from Courmayeur, the Italian village just across the chain of Mont Blanc:</p>

  <p>"Starting now by Col du Géant and Col des Nantillons."</p>

  <p>The Col du Géant is the most frequented pass across the chain, and no
  doubt the easiest. Once past its great ice-fall, the glacier leads without
  difficulty to the Montanvert hotel and Chamonix. But the Col des Nantillons
  is another affair. Having passed the ice-fall, and when within two hours of
  the Montanvert, Lattery had turned to the left and had made for the great
  wall of precipitous rock which forms the western side of the valley through
  which the Glacier du Géant flows down, the wall from which spring the peaks
  of the Dent du Requin, the Aiguille du Plan, the Aiguille de Blaitière, the
  Grépon and the Charmoz. Here and there the ridge sinks between the peaks, and
  one such depression between the Aiguille de Blaitière and the Aiguille du
  Grépon is called the Col des Nantillons. To cross that pass, to descend on
  the other side of the great rock-wall into that bay of ice facing Chamonix,
  which is the Glacier des Nantillons, had been Lattery's idea.</p>

  <p>Chayne turned to the porter.</p>

  <p>"When did this come?"</p>

  <p>"Three days ago."</p>

  <p>The gravity on Chayne's face changed into a deep distress. Lattery's party
  would have slept out one night certainly. They would have made a long march
  from Courmayeur and camped on the rocks at the foot of the pass. It was
  likely enough that they should have been caught upon that rock-wall by night
  upon the second day. The rock-wall had never been ascended, and the few who
  had descended it bore ample testimony to its difficulties. But a third night,
  no! Lattery should have been in Chamonix yesterday, without a doubt. He would
  not indeed have food for three nights and days.</p>

  <p>Chayne translated the telegram into French and read it out to Michel
  Revailloud.</p>

  <p>"The Col des Nantillons," said Michel, with a shake of the head, and
  Chayne saw the fear which he felt himself looking out from his guide's
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is possible," said Michel, "that Monsieur Lattery did not start after
  all."</p>

  <p>"He would have telegraphed again."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Michel agreed. "The weather has been fine too. There have been no
  fogs. Monsieur Lattery could not have lost his way."</p>

  <p>"Hardly in a fog on the Glacier du Géant," replied Chayne.</p>

  <p>Michel Revailloud caught at some other possibility.</p>

  <p>"Of course, some small accident &mdash; a sprained ankle &mdash; may have
  detained him at the hut on the Col du Géant. Such things have happened. It
  will be as well to telegraph to Courmayeur."</p>

  <p>"Why, that's true," said Chayne, and as they walked to the post-office he
  argued more to convince himself than Michel Revailloud. "It's very likely
  &mdash; some quite small accident &mdash; a sprained ankle." But the moment
  after he had sent the telegram, and when he and Michel stood again outside
  the post- office, the fear which was in him claimed utterance.</p>

  <p>"The Col des Nantillons is a bad place, Michel, that's the truth. Had
  Lattery been detained in the hut he would have found means to send us word.
  In weather like this, that hut would be crowded every night; every day there
  would be some one coming from Courmayeur to Chamonix. No! I am afraid of the
  steep slabs of that rock-wall."</p>

  <p>And Michael Revailloud said slowly:</p>

  <p>"I, too, monsieur. It is a bad place, the Col des Nantillons; it is not a
  quick way or a good way to anywhere, and it is very dangerous. And yet I am
  not sure. Monsieur Lattery was very safe on rocks. Ice, that is another
  thing. But he would be on rock."</p>

  <p>It was evident that Michel was in doubt, but it seemed that Chayne could
  not force himself to share it.</p>

  <p>"You had better get quietly together what guides you can, Michel," he
  said. "By the time a rescue party is made up the answer will have come from
  Courmayeur."</p>

  <p>Chayne walked slowly back to the hotel. All those eager anticipations
  which had so shortened his journey this morning, which during the last two
  years had so often raised before his eyes through the shimmering heat of the
  Red Sea cool visions of ice-peaks and sharp spires of rock, had crumbled and
  left him desolate. Anticipations of disaster had taken their place. He waited
  in the garden of the hotel at a spot whence he could command the door and the
  little street leading down to it. But for an hour no messenger came from the
  post-office. Then, remembering that a long sad work might be before him, he
  went into the hotel and breakfasted. It was twelve o'clock and the room was
  full. He was shown a place amongst the other newcomers at one of the long
  tables, and he did not notice that Sylvia Thesiger sat beside him. He heard
  her timid request for the salt, and passed it to her; but he did not speak,
  he did not turn; and when he pushed back his chair and left the room, he had
  no idea who had sat beside him, nor did he see the shadow of disappointment
  on her face. It was not until later in the afternoon when at last the blue
  envelope was brought to him. He tore it open and read the answer of the hotel
  proprietor at Courmayeur:</p>

  <p>"Lattery left four days ago with one guide for Col du Géant."</p>

  <p>He was standing by the door of the hotel, and looking up he saw Michel
  Revailloud and a small band of guides, all of whom carried ice-axes and some
  <i>Rücksacks</i> on their backs, and ropes, come tramping down the street
  toward him.</p>

  <p>Michel Revailloud came close to his side and spoke with excitement.</p>

  <p>"He has been seen, monsieur. It must have been Monsieur Lattery with his
  one guide. There were two of them," and Chayne interrupted him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there were two," he said, glancing at his telegram. "Where were they
  seen?"</p>

  <p>"High up, monsieur, on the rocks of the Blaitiere. Here, Jules"; and in
  obedience to Michel's summons, a young brown-bearded guide stepped out from
  the rest. He lifted his hat and told his story:</p>

  <p>"It was on the Mer de Glace, monsieur, the day before yesterday. I was
  bringing a party back from the Jardin, and just by the Moulin I saw two men
  very high up on the cliffs of the Blaitiere. I was astonished, for I had
  never seen any one upon those cliffs before. But I was quite sure. None of my
  party could see them, it is true, but I saw them clearly. They were perhaps
  two hundred feet below the ridge between the Blaitiere and the Grépon and to
  the left of the Col."</p>

  <p>"What time was this?"</p>

  <p>"Four o'clock in the afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Chayne. The story was borne out by the telegram. Leaving
  Courmayeur early, Lattery and his guide would have slept the night on the
  rocks at the foot of the Blaitiere, they would have climbed all the next day
  and at four o'clock had reached within two hundred feet of the ridge, within
  two hundred feet of safety. Somewhere within those last two hundred feet the
  fatal slip had been made; or perhaps a stone had fallen.</p>

  <p>"For how long did you watch them?" asked Chayne.</p>

  <p>"For a few minutes only. My party was anxious to get back to Chamonix. But
  they seemed in no difficulty, monsieur. They were going well."</p>

  <p>Chayne shook his head at the hopeful words and handed his telegram to
  Michel Revailloud.</p>

  <p>"The day before yesterday they were on the rocks of the Blaitière," he
  said. "I think we had better go up to the Mer de Glace and look for them at
  the foot of the cliffs."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, I have eight guides here and two will follow in the evening
  when they come home. We will send three of them, as a precaution, up the Mer
  de Glace. But I do not think they will find Monsieur Lattery there."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that I believe Monsieur Lattery has made the first passage of the
  Col des Nantillons from the east," he said, with a peculiar solemnity. "I
  think we must look for them on the western side of the pass, in the crevasses
  of the Glacier des Nantillons."</p>

  <p>"Surely not," cried Chayne. True, the Glacier des Nantillons in places was
  steep. True, there were the séracs &mdash; those great slabs and pinnacles of
  ice set up on end and tottering, high above, where the glacier curved over a
  brow of rock and broke &mdash; one of them might have fallen. But Lattery and
  he had so often ascended and descended that glacier on the way to the Charmoz
  and the Grépon and the Plan. He could not believe his friend had come to harm
  that way.</p>

  <p>Michel, however, clung to his opinion.</p>

  <p>"The worst part of the climb was over," he argued. "The very worst pitch,
  monsieur, is at the very beginning when you leave the glacier, and then it is
  very bad again half way up when you descend into a gully; but Monsieur
  Lattery was very safe on rock, and having got so high, I think he would have
  climbed the last rocks with his guide."</p>

  <p>Michel spoke with so much certainty that even in the face of his telegram,
  in the face of the story which Jules had told, hope sprang up within Chayne's
  heart.</p>

  <p>"Then he may be still up there on some ledge. He would surely not have
  slipped on the Glacier des Nantillons."</p>

  <p>That hope, however, was not shared by Michel Revailloud.</p>

  <p>"There is very little snow this year," he said. "The glaciers are
  uncovered as I have never seen them in all my life. Everywhere it is ice,
  ice, ice. Monsieur Lattery had only one guide with him and he was not so sure
  on ice. I am afraid, monsieur, that he slipped out of his steps on the
  Glacier des Nantillons."</p>

  <p>"And dragged his guide with him?" exclaimed Chayne. His heart rather than
  his judgment protested against the argument. It seemed to him disloyal to
  believe it. A man should not slip from his steps on the Glacier des
  Nantillons. He turned toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "Send three guides up the Mer de Glace. We will go
  up to the Glacier des Nantillons."</p>

  <p>He went up to his room, fetched his ice-ax and a new club-rope with the
  twist of red in its strands, and came down again. The rumor of an accident
  had spread. A throng of tourists stood about the door and surrounded the
  group of guides, plying them with questions. One or two asked Chayne as he
  came out on what peak the accident had happened. He did not reply. He turned
  to Michel Revailloud and forgetful for the moment that he was in Chamonix, he
  uttered the word so familiar in the High Alps, so welcome in its sound.</p>

  <p>"<i>Vorwärts</i>, Michel," he said, and the word was the Open Sesame to a
  chamber which he would gladly have kept locked. There was work to do now;
  there would be time afterward to remember &mdash; too long a time. But in
  spite of himself his recollections rushed tumultuously upon him. Up to these
  last four years, on some day in each July his friend and he had been wont to
  foregather at some village in the Alps, Lattery coming from a Government
  Office in Whitehall, Chayne now from some garrison town in England, now from
  Malta or from Alexandria, and sometimes from a still farther dependency.
  Usually they had climbed together for six weeks, although there were
  red-letter years when the six weeks were extended to eight, six weeks during
  which they lived for the most part on the high level of the glaciers,
  sleeping in huts, or mountain inns, or beneath the stars, and coming down
  only for a few hours now and then into the valley towns. <i>Vorwärts</i>! The
  months of their comradeship seemed to him epitomized in the word. The joy and
  inspiration of many a hard climb came back, made bitter with regret for
  things very pleasant and now done with forever. Nights on some high ledge,
  sheltered with rocks and set in the pale glimmer of snow-fields, with a fire
  of brushwood lighting up the faces of well-loved comrades; half hours passed
  in rock chimneys wedged overhead by a boulder, or in snow-gullies beneath a
  bulge of ice, when one man struggled above, out of sight, and the rest of the
  party crouched below with what security it might waiting for the cheery cry,
  "<i>Es geht. Vorwärts</i>!"; the last scramble to the summit of a virgin
  peak; the swift glissade down the final snow-slopes in the dusk of the
  evening with the lights of the village twinkling below; his memories tramped
  by him fast and always in the heart of them his friend's face shone before
  his eyes. Chayne stood for a moment dazed and bewildered. There rose up in
  his mind that first helpless question of distress, "Why?" and while he stood,
  his face puzzled and greatly troubled, there fell upon his ears from close at
  hand a simple message of sympathy uttered in a whisper gentle but
  distinct:</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry."</p>

  <p>Chayne looked up. It was the overdressed girl of the Annemasse buffet, the
  girl who had seemed to understand then, who seemed to understand now. He
  raised his hat to her with a sense of gratitude. Then he followed the guides
  and went up among the trees toward the Glacier des Nantillons.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap3"
     id="chap3"><small>CHAPTER 3</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE FINDING OF JOHN LATTERY</h2>

  <p class="first">The rescue party marched upward between the trees with the
  measured pace of experience. Strength which would be needed above the
  snow-line was not to be wasted on the lower slopes. But on the other hand no
  halts were made; steadily the file of men turned to the right and to the left
  and the zigzags of the forest path multiplied behind them. The zigzags
  increased in length, the trees became sparse; the rescue party came out upon
  the great plateau at the foot of the peaks called the Plan des Aiguilles, and
  stopped at the mountain inn built upon its brow, just over Chamonix. The
  evening had come, below them the mists were creeping along the hillsides and
  blotting the valley out.</p>

  <p>"We will stop here," said Michel Revailloud, as he stepped on to the
  little platform of earth in front of the door. "If we start again at
  midnight, we shall be on the glacier at daybreak. We cannot search the
  Glacier des Nantillons in the dark."</p>

  <p>Chayne agreed reluctantly. He would have liked to push on if only to lull
  thought by the monotony of their march. Moreover during these last two hours,
  some faint rushlight of hope had been kindled in his mind which made all
  delay irksome. He himself would not believe that his friend John Lattery,
  with all his skill, his experience, had slipped from his ice-steps like any
  tyro; Michel, on the other hand, would not believe that he had fallen from
  the upper rocks of the Blaitière on the far side of the Col. From these two
  disbeliefs his hope had sprung. It was possible that either Lattery or his
  guide lay disabled, but alive and tended, as well as might be, by his
  companion on some insecure ledge of that rock-cliff. A falling stone, a slip
  checked by the rope might have left either hurt but still living. It was true
  that for two nights and a day the two men must have already hung upon their
  ledge, that a third night was to follow. Still such endurance had been known
  in the annals of the Alps, and Lattery was a hard strong man.</p>

  <p>A girl came from the chalet and told him that his dinner was ready. Chayne
  forced himself to eat and stepped out again on to the platform. A door opened
  and closed behind him. Michel Revailloud came from the guides' quarters at
  the end of the chalet and stood beside him in the darkness, saying nothing
  since sympathy taught him to be silent, and when he moved moving with great
  gentleness.</p>

  <p>"I am glad, Michel, that we waited here since we had to wait," said
  Chayne.</p>

  <p>"This chalet is new to you, monsieur. It has been built while you were
  away."</p>

  <p>"Yes. And therefore it has no associations, and no memories. Its bare
  whitewashed walls have no stories to tell me of cheery nights on the eve of a
  new climb when he and I sat together for a while and talked eagerly of the
  prospects of to-morrow."</p>

  <p>The words ceased. Chayne leaned his elbows on the wooden rail. The mists
  in the valley below had been swept away; overhead the stars shone out of an
  ebony sky very bright as on some clear winter night of frost, and of all that
  gigantic amphitheater of mountains which circled behind them from right to
  left there was hardly a hint. Perhaps here some extra cube of darkness showed
  where a pinnacle soared, or there a vague whiteness glimmered where a high
  glacier hung against the cliff, but for the rest the darkness hid the
  mountains. A cold wind blew out of the East and Chayne shivered.</p>

  <p>"You are cold, monsieur?" said Michel. "It is your first night."</p>

  <p>"No, I am not cold," Chayne replied, in a low and quiet voice. "But I am
  thinking it will be deadly cold up there in the darkness on the rocks of the
  Blaitiere."</p>

  <p>Michel answered him in the same quiet voice. On that broad open plateau
  both men spoke indeed as though they were in a sick chamber.</p>

  <p>"While you were away, monsieur, three men without food sat through a night
  on a steep ice-sheltered ice-slope behind us, high up on the Aiguille du
  Plan, as high up as the rocks of the Blaitiere. And not one of them came to
  any harm."</p>

  <p>"I know. I read of it," said Chayne, but he gathered little comfort from
  the argument.</p>

  <p>Michel fumbled in his pocket and drew out a pipe. "You do not smoke any
  more?" he asked. "It is a good thing to smoke."</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten," said Chayne.</p>

  <p>He filled his pipe and then took a fuse from his match-box.</p>

  <p>"No, don't waste it," cried Michel quickly before he could strike it. "I
  remember your fuses, monsieur."</p>

  <p>Michel struck a sulphur match and held it as it spluttered, and frizzled,
  in the hollow of his great hands. The flame burnt up. He held it first to
  Chayne's pipe-bowl and then to his own; and for a moment his face was lit
  with the red glow. Its age thus revealed, and framed in the darkness, shocked
  Chayne, even at this moment, more than it had done on the platform at
  Chamonix. Not merely were its deep lines shown up, but all the old humor and
  alertness had gone. The face had grown mask-like and spiritless. Then the
  match went out.</p>

  <p>Chayne leaned upon the rail and looked downward. A long way below him, in
  the clear darkness of the valley the lights of Chamonix shone bright and very
  small. Chayne had never seen them before so straight beneath him. As he
  looked he began to notice them; as he noticed them, more and more they took a
  definite shape. He rose upright, and pointing downward with one hand he said
  in a whisper, a whisper of awe &mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do you see, Michel? Do you see?"</p>

  <p>The great main thoroughfare ran in a straight line eastward through the
  town, and, across it, intersecting it at the little square where the guides
  gather of an evening, lay the other broad straight road from the church
  across the river. Along those two roads the lights burned most brightly, and
  thus there had emerged before Chayne's eyes a great golden cross. It grew
  clearer and clearer as he looked; he looked away and then back again, and now
  it leapt to view, he could not hide it from his sight, a great cross of light
  lying upon the dark bosom of the valley.</p>

  <p>"Do you see, Michel?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." The answer came back very steadily. "But so it was last night and
  last year. Those three men on the Plan had it before their eyes all night. It
  is no sign of disaster." For a moment he was silent, and then he added
  timidly: "If you look for a sign, monsieur, there is a better one."</p>

  <p>Chayne turned toward Michel in the darkness rather quickly.</p>

  <p>"As we set out from the hotel," Michel continued, "there was a young girl
  upon the steps with a very sweet and gentle face. She spoke to you, monsieur.
  No doubt she told you that her prayers would be with you to-night."</p>

  <p>"No, Michel," Chayne replied, and though the darkness hid his face, Michel
  knew that he smiled. "She did not promise me her prayers. She simply said: 'I
  am sorry.'"</p>

  <p>Michel Revailloud was silent for a little while, and when he spoke again,
  he spoke very wistfully. One might almost have said that there was a note of
  envy in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, that is still something, monsieur. You are very lonely to-night, is
  it not so? You came back here after many years, eager with hopes and plans
  and not thinking at all of disappointments. And the disappointments have
  come, and the hopes are all fallen. Is not that so, too? Well, it is
  something, monsieur &mdash; I, who am lonely too, and an old man besides, so
  that I cannot mend my loneliness, I tell you &mdash; it is something that
  there is a young girl down there with a sweet and gentle face who is sorry
  for you, who perhaps is looking up from among those lights to where we stand
  in the darkness at this moment."</p>

  <p>But it seemed that Chayne did not hear, or, if he heard, that he paid no
  heed. And Michel, knocking the tobacco from his pipe, said:</p>

  <p>"You will do well to sleep. We may have a long day before us"; and he
  walked away to the guides' quarters.</p>

  <p>But Chayne could not sleep; hope and doubt fought too strongly within him,
  wrestling for the life of his friend. At twelve o'clock Michel knocked upon
  his door. Chayne got up from his bed at once, drew on his boots, and
  breakfasted. At half past the rescue party set out, following a rough path
  through a wilderness of boulders by the light of a lantern. It was still dark
  when they came to the edge of the glacier, and they sat down and waited. In a
  little while the sky broke in the East, a twilight dimly revealed the hills,
  Michel blew out the lantern, the blurred figures of the guides took shape and
  outline, and silently the morning dawned upon the world.</p>

  <p>The guides moved on to the glacier and spread over it, ascending as they
  searched.</p>

  <p>"You see, monsieur, there is very little snow this year," said Michel,
  chipping steps so that he and Chayne might round the corner of a wide
  crevasse.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it does not follow that he slipped," said Chayne, hotly, for he
  was beginning to resent that explanation as an imputation against his
  friend.</p>

  <p>Slowly the party moved upward over the great slope of ice into the recess,
  looking for steps abruptly ending above a crevasse or for signs of an
  avalanche. They came level with the lower end of a long rib of rock which
  crops out from the ice and lengthwise bisects the glacier. Here the search
  ended for a while. The rib of rocks is the natural path, and the guides
  climbed it quickly. They came to the upper glacier and spread out once more,
  roped in couples. They were now well within the great amphitheater. On their
  left the cliffs of the Charmoz overlapped them, on the right the rocks of the
  Blaitière. For an hour they advanced, cutting steps since the glacier was
  steep, and then from the center of the glacier a cry rang out. Chayne at the
  end of the line upon the right looked across. A little way in front of the
  two men who had shouted something dark lay upon the ice. Chayne, who was with
  Michel Revailloud, called to him and began hurriedly to scratch steps
  diagonally toward the object.</p>

  <p>"Take care, monsieur," cried Michel.</p>

  <p>Chayne paid no heed. Coming up from behind on the left-hand side, he
  passed his guide and took the lead. He could tell now what the dark object
  was, for every now and then a breath of wind caught it and whirled it about
  the ice. It was a hat. He raised his ax to slice a step and a gust of wind,
  stronger than the others, lifted the hat, sent it rolling and skipping down
  the glacier, lifted it again and gently dropped it at his feet. He stooped
  down and picked it up. It was a soft broad-brimmed hat of dark gray felt. In
  the crown there was the name of an English maker. There was something more
  too. There were two initials &mdash; J.L.</p>

  <p>Chayne turned to Michel Revailloud.</p>

  <p>"You were right, Michel," he said, solemnly. "My friend has made the first
  passage of the Col des Nantillons from the East."</p>

  <p>The party moved forward again, watching with redoubled vigilance for some
  spot in the glacier, some spot above a crevasse, to which ice-steps descended
  and from which they did not lead down. And three hundred yards beyond a
  second cry rang out. A guide was standing on the lower edge of a great
  crevasse with a hand upheld above his head. The searchers converged quickly
  upon him. Chayne hurried forward, plying the pick of his ax as never in his
  life had he plied it. Had the guide come upon the actual place where the
  accident took place, he asked himself? But before he reached the spot, his
  pace slackened, and he stood still. He had no longer any doubt. His friend
  and his friend's guide were not lying upon any ledge of the rocks of the
  Aiguille de Blaitière; they were not waiting for any succor.</p>

  <p>On the glacier, a broad track, littered with blocks of ice, stretched
  upward in a straight line from the upper lip of the crevasse to the great
  ice- fall on the sky-line where the huge slabs and pinnacles of ice, twisted
  into monstrous shapes, like a sea suddenly frozen when a tempest was at its
  height, stood marshaled in serried rows. They stood waiting upon the sun. One
  of them, melted at the base, had crashed down the slope, bursting into huge
  fragments as it fell, and cleaving a groove even in that hard glacier.</p>

  <p>Chayne went forward and stopped at the guide's side on the lower edge of
  the crevasse. Beyond the chasm the ice rose in a blue straight wall for some
  three feet, and the upper edge was all crushed and battered; and then the
  track of the falling sérac ended. It had poured into the crevasse.</p>

  <p>The guide pointed to the left of the track.</p>

  <p>"Do you see, monsieur? Those steps which come downward across the glacier
  and stop exactly where the track meets them? They do not go on, on the other
  side of the track, monsieur."</p>

  <p>Chayne saw clearly enough. The two men had been descending the glacier in
  the afternoon, the avalanche had fallen and swept them down. He dropped upon
  his knees and peered into the crevasse. The walls of the chasm descended
  smooth and precipitous, changing in gradual shades and color from pale
  transparent green to the darkest blue, until all color was lost in darkness.
  He bent his head and shouted into the depths:</p>

  <p>"Lattery! Lattery!"</p>

  <p>And only his voice came back to him, cavernous and hollow. He shouted
  again, and then he heard Michel Revailloud saying solemnly behind him:</p>

  <p>"Yes, they are here."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Chayne turned round, moved by a fierce throb of anger.</p>

  <p>"It's not true, you see," he cried. "He didn't slip out of his steps and
  drag his guide down with him. You were wrong, Michel."</p>

  <p>Michel was standing with his hat in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur, I was quite wrong," he said, gently. He turned to a big
  and strong man:</p>

  <p>"François, will you put on the rope and go down?"</p>

  <p>They knotted the rope securely about François' waist and he took his
  ice-ax in his hand, sat down on the edge of the crevasse with his legs
  dangling, turned over upon his face and said:</p>

  <p>"When I pull the rope, haul in gently."</p>

  <p>They lowered him carefully down for sixty feet, and at that depth the rope
  slackened. François had reached the bottom of the crevasse. For a few moments
  they watched the rope move this way and that, and then there came a definite
  pull.</p>

  <p>"He has found them," said Michel.</p>

  <p>Some of the guides lined out with the rope in their hands. Chayne took his
  position in the front, at the head of the line and nearest to the crevasse.
  The pull upon the rope was repeated, and slowly the men began to haul it in.
  It did not occur to Chayne that the weight upon the rope was heavy. One
  question filled his mind, to the exclusion of all else. Had François found
  his friend? What news would he bring of them when he came again up to the
  light? François' voice was heard now, faintly, calling from the depths. But
  what he said could not be heard. The line of men hauled in the rope more and
  more quickly and then suddenly stopped and drew it in very gently. For they
  could now hear what François said. It was but one word, persistently
  repeated:</p>

  <p>"Gently! Gently!"</p>

  <p>And so gently they drew him up toward the mouth of the crevasse. Chayne
  was standing too far back to see down beyond the edge, but he could hear
  François' ax clattering against the ice-walls, and the grating of his boots.
  Michel, who was kneeling at the edge of the chasm, held up his hand, and the
  men upon the rope ceased to haul. In a minute or two he lowered it.</p>

  <p>"Gently," he said, "gently," gazing downward with a queer absorption.
  Chayne began to hear François' labored breathing and then suddenly at the
  edge of the crevasse he saw appear the hair of a man's head.</p>

  <p>"Up with him," cried a guide; there was a quick strong pull upon the rope
  and out of the chasm, above the white level of the glacier, there appeared a
  face &mdash; not François' face &mdash; but the face of a dead man. Suddenly
  it rose into the colorless light, pallid and wax-like, with open, sightless
  eyes and a dropped jaw, and one horrid splash of color on the left forehead,
  where blood had frozen. It was the face of Chayne's friend, John Lattery; and
  in a way most grotesque and horrible it bobbed and nodded at him, as though
  the neck was broken and the man yet lived. When François just below cried,
  "Gently! Gently," it seemed that the dead man's mouth was speaking.</p>

  <p>Chayne uttered a cry; then a deathly sickness overcame him. He dropped the
  rope, staggered a little way off like a drunken man and sat down upon the ice
  with his head between his hands.</p>

  <p>Some while later a man came to him and said:</p>

  <p>"We are ready, monsieur."</p>

  <p>Chayne returned to the crevasse. Lattery's guide had been raised from the
  crevasse. Both bodies had been wrapped in sacks and cords had been fixed
  about their legs. The rescue party dragged the bodies down the glacier to the
  path, and placing them upon doors taken from a chalet, carried them down to
  Chamonix. On the way down François talked for a while to Michel Revailloud,
  who in his turn fell back to where at the end of the procession Chayne walked
  alone.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," he said, and Chayne looked at him with dull eyes like a man
  dazed.</p>

  <p>"There is something which François noticed, which he wished me to tell
  you. François is a good lad. He wishes you to know that your friend died at
  once &mdash; there was no sign of a movement. He lay in the bottom of the
  crevasse in some snow which was quite smooth. The guide &mdash; he had kicked
  a little with his feet in the snow &mdash; but your friend had died at
  once."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Chayne, without the least emotion in his voice. But he
  walked with uneven steps. At times he staggered like one overdone and very
  tired. But once or twice he said, as though he were dimly aware that he had
  his friend's reputation to defend:</p>

  <p>"You see he didn't slip on the ice, Michel. You were quite wrong. It was
  the avalanche. It was no fault of his."</p>

  <p>"I was wrong," said Michel, and he took Chayne by the arm lest he should
  fall; and these two men came long after the others into Chamonix.</p>

     id="chap4"><small>CHAPTER 4</small></a><br>
  <br>
  MR. JARVICE</h2>

  <p class="first">The news of Lattery's death was telegraphed to England on
  the same evening. It appeared the next morning under a conspicuous head-line
  in the daily newspapers, and Mr. Sidney Jarvice read the item in the Pullman
  car as he traveled from Brighton to his office in London. He removed his big
  cigar from his fat red lips, and became absorbed in thought. The train rushed
  past Hassocks and Three Bridges and East Croydon. Mr. Jarvice never once
  looked at his newspaper again. The big cigar of which the costliness was
  proclaimed by the gold band about its middle had long since gone out, and for
  him the train came quite unexpectedly to a stop at the ticket platform on
  Battersea Bridge.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvice was a florid person in his looks and in his dress. It was in
  accordance with his floridness that he always retained the gold band about
  his cigar while he smoked it. He was a man of middle age, with thick, black
  hair, a red, broad face, little bright, black eyes, a black mustache and
  rather prominent teeth. He was short and stout, and drew attention to his
  figure by wearing light-colored trousers adorned with a striking check. From
  Victoria Station he drove at once to his office in Jermyn Street. A young and
  wizened- looking clerk was already at work in the outer room.</p>

  <p>"I will see no one this morning, Maunders," said Mr. Jarvice as he pressed
  through.</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir. There are a good number of letters," replied the
  clerk.</p>

  <p>"They must wait," said Mr. Jarvice, and entering his private room he shut
  the door. He did not touch the letters upon his table, but he went straight
  to his bureau, and unlocking a drawer, took from it a copy of the Code
  Napoleon. He studied the document carefully, locked it up again and looked at
  his watch. It was getting on toward one o'clock. He rang the bell for his
  clerk.</p>

  <p>"Maunders," he said, "I once asked you to make some inquiries about a
  young man called Walter Hine."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember what his habits were? Where he lunched, for
  instance?"</p>

  <p>Maunders reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"It's a little while ago, sir, since I made the inquiries. As far as I
  remember, he did not lunch regularly anywhere. But he went to the American
  Bar of the Criterion restaurant most days for a morning drink about one."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he did? You made his acquaintance, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, you might find him this morning, give him some lunch, and bring him
  round to see me at three. See that he is sober."</p>

  <p>At three o'clock accordingly Mr. Walter Hine was shown into the inner room
  of Mr. Jarvice. Jarvice bent his bright eyes upon his visitor. He saw a young
  man with very fair hair, a narrow forehead, watery blue eyes and a weak,
  dissipated face. Walter Hine was dressed in a cheap suit of tweed much the
  worse for wear, and he entered the room with the sullen timidity of the very
  shy. Moreover, he was a little unsteady as he walked, as though he had not
  yet recovered from last night's intoxication.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvice noted these points with his quick glance, but whether they
  pleased him or not there was no hint upon his face.</p>

  <p>"Will you sit down?" he said, suavely, pointing to a chair. "Maunders, you
  can go."</p>

  <p>Walter Hine turned quickly, as though he would have preferred Maunders to
  stay, but he let him go. Mr. Jarvice shut the door carefully, and, walking
  across the room, stood over his visitor with his hands in his pockets, and
  renewed his scrutiny. Walter Hine grew uncomfortable, and blurted out with a
  cockney twang &mdash;</p>

  <p>"Maunders told me that if I came to see you it might be to my
  advantage."</p>

  <p>"I think it will," replied Mr. Jarvice. "Have you seen this morning's
  paper?"</p>

  <p>"On'y the 'Sportsman'."</p>

  <p>"Then you have probably not noticed that your cousin, John Lattery, has
  been killed in the Alps." He handed his newspaper to Hine, who glanced at it
  indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Well, how does that affect me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It leaves you the only heir to your uncle, Mr. Joseph Hine, wine-grower
  at Maçon, who, I believe, is a millionaire. Joseph Hine is domiciled in
  France, and must by French law leave a certain portion of his property to his
  relations, in other words, to you. I have taken some trouble to go into the
  matter, Mr. Hine, and I find that your share must at the very least amount to
  two hundred thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"I know all about that," Hine interrupted. "But as the old brute won't
  acknowledge me and may live another twenty years, it's not much use to me
  now."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Jarvice, smiling suavely, "my young friend, that is where
  I come in."</p>

  <p>Walter Hine looked up in surprise. Suspicion followed quickly upon the
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Oh, on purely business terms, of course," said Jarvice. He took a seat
  and resumed gaily. "Now I am by profession &mdash; what would you guess? I am
  a money-lender. Luckily for many people I have money, and I lend it &mdash; I
  lend it upon very easy terms. I make no secret of my calling, Mr. Hine. On
  the contrary, I glory in it. It gives me an opportunity of doing a great deal
  of good in a quiet way. If I were to show you my books you would realize that
  many famous estates are only kept going through my assistance; and thus many
  a farm laborer owes his daily bread to me and never knows his debt. Why
  should I conceal it?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvice turned toward his visitor with his hands outspread. Then his
  voice dropped.</p>

  <p>"There is only one thing I hide, and that, Mr. Hine, is the easiness of
  the terms on which I advance my loans. I must hide that. I should have all my
  profession against me were it known. But you shall know it, Mr. Hine." He
  leaned forward and patted his young friend upon the knee with an air of great
  benevolence. "Come, to business! Your circumstances are not, I think, in a
  very flourishing condition."</p>

  <p>"I should think not," said Walter Hine, sullenly. "I have a hundred and
  fifty a year, paid weekly. Three quid a week don't give a fellow much chance
  of a flutter."</p>

  <p>"Three pounds a week. Ridiculous!" cried Mr. Jarvice, lifting up his
  hands. "I am shocked, really shocked. But we will alter all that. Oh yes, we
  will soon alter that."</p>

  <p>He sprang up briskly, and unlocking once more the drawer in which he kept
  his copy of the Code Napoleon, he took out this time a slip of paper. He
  seated himself again, drawing up his chair to the table.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me, Mr. Hine, whether these particulars are correct? We
  must be business-like, you know. Oh yes," he said, gaily wagging his head and
  cocking his bright little eyes at his visitor. And he began to read aloud, or
  rather paraphrase, the paper which he held:</p>

  <p>"Your father inherited the same fortune as your uncle, Joseph Hine, but
  lost almost the entire amount in speculation. In middle life he married your
  mother, who was &mdash; forgive me if I wound the delicacy of your feelings,
  Mr. Hine &mdash; not quite his equal in social position. The happy couple
  then took up their residence in Arcade Street, Croydon, where you were born
  on March 6, twenty-three years ago."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Walter Hine.</p>

  <p>"In Croydon you passed your boyhood. You were sent to the public school
  there. But the rigorous discipline of school life did not suit your
  independent character." Thus did Mr. Jarvice gracefully paraphrase the single
  word "expelled" which was written on his slip of paper. "Ah, Mr. Hine," he
  cried, smiling indulgently at the sullen, bemused weakling who sat before
  him, stale with his last night's drink. "You and Shelley! Rebels, sir, rebels
  both! Well, well! After you left school, at the age of sixteen, you pursued
  your studies in a desultory fashion at home. Your father died the following
  year. Your mother two years later. You have since lived in Russell Street,
  Bloomsbury, on the income which remained from your father's patrimony. Three
  pounds a week &mdash; to be sure, here it is &mdash; paid weekly by trustees
  appointed by your mother. And you have adopted none of the liberal
  professions. There we have it, I think."</p>

  <p>"You seem to have taken a lot of trouble to find out my history," said
  Walter Hine, suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Business, sir, business," said Mr. Jarvice. It was on the tip of his
  tongue to add, "The early bird, you know," but he was discreet enough to hold
  the words back. "Now let me look to the future, which opens out in a brighter
  prospect. It is altogether absurd, Mr. Hine, that a young gentleman who will
  eventually inherit a quarter of a million should have to scrape through
  meanwhile on three pounds a week. I put it on a higher ground. It is bad for
  the State, Mr. Hine, and you and I, like good citizens of this great empire,
  must consider the State. When this great fortune comes into your hands you
  should already have learned how to dispose of it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I could dispose of it all right," interrupted Mr. Hine with a
  chuckle. "Don't you worry your head about that."</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvice laughed heartily at the joke. Walter Hine could not but think
  that he had made a very witty remark. He began to thaw into something like
  confidence. He sat more easily on his chair.</p>

  <p>"You will have your little joke, Mr. Hine. You could dispose of it! Very
  good indeed! I must really tell that to my dear wife. But business,
  business!" He checked his laughter with a determined effort, and lowered his
  voice to a confidential pitch. "I propose to allow you two thousand pounds a
  year, paid quarterly in advance. Five hundred pounds each quarter. Forty
  pounds a week, Mr. Hine, which with your three will make a nice comfortable
  living wage! Ha! Ha!"</p>

  <p>"Two thousand a year!" gasped Mr. Hine, leaning back in his chair. "It
  ain't possible. Two thou &mdash; here, what am I to do for it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except to spend it like a gentleman," said Mr. Jarvice, beaming
  upon his visitor. It did not seem to occur to either man that Mr. Jarvice had
  set to his loan the one condition which Mr. Walter Hine never could fulfil.
  Walter Hine was troubled with doubts of quite another kind.</p>

  <p>"But you come in somewhere," he said, bluntly. "On'y I'm hanged if I see
  where."</p>

  <p>"Of course I come in, my young friend," replied Jarvice, frankly. "I or my
  executors. For we may have to wait a long time. I propose that you execute in
  my favor a post-obit on your uncle's life, giving me &mdash; well, we may
  have to wait a long time. Twenty years you suggested. Your uncle is seventy-
  three, but a hale man, living in a healthy climate. We will say four thousand
  pounds for every two thousand which I lend you. Those are easy terms, Mr.
  Hine. I don't make you take cigars and sherry! No! I think such practices
  almost reflect discredit on my calling. Two thousand a year! Five hundred a
  quarter! Forty pounds a week! Forty-three with your little income! Well, what
  do you say?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hine sat dazzled with the prospect of wealth, immediate wealth,
  actually within his reach now. But he had lived amongst people who never did
  anything for nothing, who spoke only a friendship when they proposed to
  borrow money, and at the back of his mind suspicion and incredulity were
  still at work. Somehow Jarvice would be getting the better of him. In his
  dull way he began to reason matters out.</p>

  <p>"But suppose I died before my uncle, then you would get nothing," he
  objected.</p>

  <p>"Ah, to be sure! I had not forgotten that point," said Mr. Jarvice. "It is
  a contingency, of course, not very probable, but still we do right to
  consider it." He leaned back in his chair, and once again he fixed his eyes
  upon his visitor in a long and silent scrutiny. When he spoke again, it was
  in a quieter voice than he had used. One might almost have said that the real
  business of the interview was only just beginning.</p>

  <p>"There is a way which will save me from loss. You can insure your life as
  against your uncle's, for a round sum &mdash; say for a hundred thousand
  pounds. You will make over the policy to me. I shall pay the premiums, and so
  if anything were to happen to you I should be recouped."</p>

  <p>He never once removed his eyes from Hine's face. He sat with his elbows on
  the arms of his chair and his hands folded beneath his chin, quite still, but
  with a queer look of alertness upon his whole person.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see," said Mr. Hine, as he turned the proposal over in his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Do you agree?" asked Jarvice.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Walter Hine.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Jarvice, all his old briskness returning. "The sooner
  the arrangement is pushed through, the better for you, eh? You will begin to
  touch the dibs." He laughed and Walter Hine chuckled. "As to the insurance,
  you will have to get the company's doctor's certificate, and I should think
  it would be wise to go steady for a day or two, what? You have been going the
  pace a bit, haven't you? You had better see your solicitor to-day. As soon as
  the post-obit and the insurance policy are in this office, Mr. Hine, your
  first quarter's income is paid into your bank. I will have an agreement
  drawn, binding me on my side to pay you two thousand a year until your
  uncle's death."</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvice rose as if the interview was ended. He moved some papers on
  his table, and added carelessly &mdash; "You have a good solicitor, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't a solicitor at all," said Walter Hine, as he, too, rose.</p>

  <p>"Oh, haven't you?" said Mr. Jarvice, with all the appearance of surprise.
  "Well, shall I give you an introduction to one?" He sat down, wrote a note,
  placed it in an envelope, which he left unfastened, and addressed it. Then he
  handed the envelope to his client.</p>

  <p>"Messrs. Jones and Stiles, Lincoln's Inn Fields," he said. "But ask for
  Mr. Driver. Tell him the whole proposal frankly, and ask his advice."</p>

  <p>"Driver?" said Hine, fingering the envelope. "Hadn't I ought to see one of
  the partners?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvice smiled.</p>

  <p>"You have a business head, Mr. Hine, that's very clear. I'll let you into
  a secret. Mr. Driver is rather like yourself &mdash; something of a rebel,
  Mr. Hine. He came into disagreement with that very arbitrary body the
  Incorporated Law Society, so, &mdash; well his name does not figure in the
  firm. But he <i>is</i> Jones and Stiles. Tell him everything! If he advises
  you against my proposal, I shall even say take his advice. Good-morning." Mr.
  Jarvice went to the door and opened it.</p>

  <p>"Well, this is the spider's web, you know," he said, with the good-
  humored laugh of one who could afford to despise the slanders of the ill-
  affected. "Not such a very uncomfortable place, eh?" and he bowed Mr. Fly out
  of his office.</p>

  <p>He stood at the door and waited until the outer office closed. Then he
  went to his telephone and rang up a particular number.</p>

  <p>"Are you Jones and Stiles?" he asked. "Thank you! Will you ask Mr. Driver
  to come to the telephone"; and with Mr. Driver he talked genially for the
  space of five minutes.</p>

  <p>Then, and not till then, with a smile of satisfaction, Mr. Jarvice turned
  to the unopened letters which had come to him by the morning post.</p>

  <br>
  MICHEL REVAILLOUD EXPOUNDS HIS PHILOSOPHY</h2>

  <p class="first">That summer was long remembered in Chamonix. July passed
  with a procession of cloudless days; valley and peak basked in sunlight.
  August came, and on a hot starlit night in the first week of that month
  Chayne sat opposite to Michel Revailloud in the balcony of a café which
  overhangs the Arve. Below him the river tumbling swiftly amidst the boulders
  flashed in the darkness like white fire. He sat facing the street. Chamonix
  was crowded and gay with lights. In the little square just out of sight upon
  the right, some traveling musicians were singing, and up and down the street
  the visitors thronged noisily. Women in light-colored evening frocks, with
  lace shawls thrown about their shoulders and their hair; men in attendance
  upon them, clerks from Paris and Geneva upon their holidays; and every now
  and then a climber with his guide, come late from the mountains, would cross
  the bridge quickly and stride toward his hotel. Chayne watched the procession
  in silence quite aloof from its light-heartedness and gaiety. Michel
  Revailloud drained his glass of beer, and, as he replaced it on the table,
  said wistfully:</p>

  <p>"So this is the last night, monsieur. It is always sad, the last
  night."</p>

  <p>"It is not exactly as we planned it," replied Chayne, and his eyes moved
  from the throng before him in the direction of the churchyard, where a few
  days before his friend had been laid amongst the other Englishmen who had
  fallen in the Alps. "I do not think that I shall ever come back to Chamonix,"
  he said, in a quiet and heart-broken voice.</p>

  <p>Michel gravely nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"There are no friendships," said he, "like those made amongst the snows.
  But this, monsieur, I say: Your friend is not greatly to be pitied. He was
  young, had known no suffering, no ill-health, and he died at once. He did not
  even kick the snow for a little while."</p>

  <p>"No doubt that's true," said Chayne, submitting to the commonplace, rather
  than drawing from it any comfort. He called to the waiter. "Since it is the
  last night, Michel," he said, with a smile, "we will drink another bottle of
  beer."</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair and once more grew silent, watching the
  thronged street and the twinkling lights. In the little square one of the
  musicians with a very clear sweet voice was singing a plaintive song, and
  above the hum of the crowd, the melody, haunting in its wistfulness, floated
  to Chayne's ears, and troubled him with many memories.</p>

  <p>Michel leaned forward upon the table and answered not merely with sympathy
  but with the air of one speaking out of full knowledge, and speaking moreover
  in a voice of warning.</p>

  <p>"True, monsieur. The happiest memories can be very bitter &mdash; if one
  has no one to share them. All is in that, monsieur. If," and he repeated his
  phrase &mdash; "If one has no one to share them." Then the technical side of
  Chayne's proposal took hold of him.</p>

  <p>"The Col Dolent? You will have to start early from the Chalet de Lognan,
  monsieur. You will sleep there, of course, to-morrow. You will have to start
  at midnight &mdash; perhaps even before. There is very little snow this year.
  The great bergschrund will be very difficult. In any season it is always
  difficult to cross that bergschrund on to the steep ice-slope beyond. It is
  so badly bridged with snow. This season it will be as bad as can be. The
  ice-slope up to the Col will also take a long time. So start very early."</p>

  <p>As Michel spoke, as he anticipated the difficulties and set his thoughts
  to overcome them, his eyes lit up, his whole face grew younger.</p>

  <p>Chayne smiled.</p>

  <p>"I wish you were coming with me Michel," he said, and at once the
  animation died out of Michel's face. He became once more a sad, dispirited
  man.</p>

  <p>"Alas, monsieur," he said, "I have crossed my last Col. I have ascended my
  last mountain."</p>

  <p>"You, Michel?" cried Chayne.</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur, I," replied Michel, quietly. "I have grown old. My eyes
  hurt me on the mountains, and my feet burn. I am no longer fit for anything
  except to lead mules up to the Montanvert and conduct parties on the Mer de
  Glace."</p>

  <p>Chayne stared at Michel Revailloud. He thought of what the guide's life
  had been, of its interest, its energy, its achievement. More than one of
  those aiguilles towering upon his left hand, into the sky, had been first
  conquered by Michel Revailloud. And how he had enjoyed it all! What resource
  he had shown, what cheerfulness. Remorse gradually seized upon Chayne as he
  looked across the little iron table at his guide.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is a little sad," continued Revailloud. "But I think that toward
  the end, life is always a little sad, if" &mdash; and the note of warning
  once more was audible &mdash; "if one has no well-loved companion to share
  one's memories."</p>

  <p>The very resignation of Michel's voice brought Chayne to a yet deeper
  compunction. The wistful melody still throbbed high and sank, and soared
  again above the murmurs of the passers-by and floated away upon the clear hot
  starlit night. Chayne wondered with what words it spoke to his old guide. He
  looked at the tired sad face on which a smile of friendliness now played, and
  his heart ached. He felt some shame that his own troubles had so engrossed
  him. After all, Lattery was not greatly to be pitied. That was true. He
  himself too was young. There would come other summers, other friends. The
  real irreparable trouble sat there before him on the other side of the iron
  table, the trouble of an old age to be lived out in loneliness.</p>

  <p>"You never married, Michel?" he said.</p>

  <p>"No. There was a time, long ago, when I would have liked to," the guide
  answered, simply. "But I think now it was as well that I did not get my way.
  She was very extravagant. She would have needed much money, and guides are
  poor people, monsieur &mdash; not like your professional cricketers," he
  said, with a laugh. And then he turned toward the massive wall of mountains.
  Here and there a slim rock spire, the Dru or the Charmoz, pointed a finger to
  the stars, here and there an ice-field glimmered like a white mist held in a
  fold of the hills. But to Michel Revailloud, the whole vast range was spread
  out as on a raised map, buttress and peak, and dome of snow from the Aiguille
  d'Argentière in the east to the summit of Mont Blanc in the west. In his
  thoughts he turned from mountain to mountain and found each one, majestic and
  beautiful, dear as a living friend, and hallowed with recollections. He
  remembered days when they had called, and not in vain, for courage and
  endurance, days of blinding snow-storms and bitter winds which had caught him
  half-way up some ice-glazed precipice of rock or on some long steep ice-slope
  crusted dangerously with thin snow into which the ax must cut deep hour after
  hour, however frozen the fingers, or tired the limbs. He recalled the thrill
  of joy with which, after many vain attempts, he, the first of men, had
  stepped on to the small topmost pinnacle of this or that new peak. He
  recalled the days of travel, the long glacier walks on the high level from
  Chamonix to Zermatt, and from Zermatt again to the Oberland; the still clear
  mornings and the pink flush upon some high white cone which told that
  somewhere the sun had risen; and the unknown ridges where expected
  difficulties suddenly vanished at the climber's approach, and others where an
  easy scramble suddenly turned into the most difficult of climbs. Michel
  raised his glass in the air. "Here is good-by to you &mdash; the long
  good-by," he said, and his voice broke. And abruptly he turned to Chayne with
  his eyes full of tears and began to speak in a quick passionate whisper,
  while the veins stood out upon his forehead and his face quivered.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, I told you your friend was not greatly to be pitied. I tell you
  now something more. The guide we brought down with him from the Glacier des
  Nantillons a fortnight back &mdash; all this fortnight I have been envying
  him &mdash; yes, yes, even though he kicked the snow with his feet for a
  little before he died. It is better to do so than to lead mules up to the
  Montanvert."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," said Chayne.</p>

  <p>The words sounded, as he spoke them, lame enough and trivial in the face
  of Michel's passionate lament. But they had an astonishing effect upon the
  guide. The flow of words stopped at once, he looked at his young patron
  almost whimsically and a little smile played about his mouth.</p>

  <p>"'I am sorry,'" he repeated. "Those were the words the young lady spoke to
  you on the steps of the hotel. You have spoken with her, monsieur, and
  thanked her for them?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Chayne, and there was much indifference in his voice.</p>

  <p>Women had, as yet, not played a great part in Chayne's life. Easy to
  please, but difficult to stir, he had in the main just talked with them by
  the way and gone on forgetfully: and when any one had turned and walked a
  little of his road beside him, she had brought to him no thought that here
  might be a companion for all the way. His indifference roused Michel to
  repeat, and this time unmistakably, the warning he had twice uttered.</p>

  <p>He leaned across the table, fixing his eyes very earnestly on his patron's
  face. "Take care, monsieur," he said. "You are lonely to-night &mdash; very
  lonely. Then take good care that your old age is not one lonely night like
  this repeated and repeated through many years! Take good care that when you
  in your turn come to the end, and say good-by too" &mdash; he waved his hand
  toward the mountains &mdash; "you have some one to share your memories. See,
  monsieur!" and very wistfully he began to plead, "I go home to-night, I go
  out of Chamonix, I cross a field or two, I come to Les Praz-Conduits and my
  cottage. I push open the door. It is all dark within. I light my own lamp and
  I sit there a little by myself. Take an old man's wisdom, monsieur! When it
  is all over and you go home, take care that there is a lighted lamp in the
  room and the room not empty. Have some one to share your memories when life
  is nothing but memories." He rose as he ended, and held out his hand. As
  Chayne took it, the guide spoke again, and his voice shook:</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, you have been a good patron to me," he said, with a quiet and
  most dignified simplicity, "and I make you what return I can. I have spoken
  to you out of my heart, for you will not return to Chamonix and after
  to-night we shall not meet again."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Chayne, and he added: "We have had many good days
  together, Michel."</p>

  <p>"We have, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"I climbed my first mountain with you."</p>

  <p>"The Aiguille du Midi. I remember it well."</p>

  <p>Both were silent after that, and for the same reason. Neither could trust
  his voice. Michel Revailloud picked up his hat, turned abruptly away and
  walked out of the café into the throng of people. Chayne resumed his seat and
  sat there, silent and thoughtful, until the street began to empty and the
  musicians in the square ceased from their songs.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Michel Revailloud walked slowly down the street, stopping to
  speak with any one he knew however slightly, that he might defer his entrance
  into the dark and empty cottage at Les Praz-Conduits. He drew near to the
  hotel where Chayne was staying and saw under the lamp above the door a guide
  whom he knew talking with a young girl. The young girl raised her head. It
  was she who had said, "I am sorry." As Michel came within the circle of light
  she recognized him. She spoke quickly to the guide and he turned at once and
  called "Michel," and when Revailloud approached, he presented him to Sylvia
  Thesiger. "He has made many first ascents in the range of Mont Blanc,
  mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>Sylvia held out her hand with a smile of admiration.</p>

  <p>"I know," she said. "I have read of them."</p>

  <p>"Really?" cried Michel. "You have read of them &mdash; you,
  mademoiselle?"</p>

  <p>There was as much pleasure as wonder in his tone. After all, flattery from
  the lips of a woman young and beautiful was not to be despised, he thought,
  the more especially when the flattery was so very well deserved. Life had
  perhaps one or two compensations to offer him in his old age.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed. I am very glad to meet you, Michel. I have known your name a
  long while and envied you for living in the days when these mountains were
  unknown."</p>

  <p>Revailloud forgot the mules to the Montanvert and the tourists on the Mer
  de Glace. He warmed into cheerfulness. This young girl looked at him with so
  frank an envy.</p>

  <p>"Yes, those were great days, mademoiselle," he said, with a thrill of
  pride in his voice. "But if we love the mountains, the first ascent or the
  hundredth &mdash; there is just the same joy when you feel the rough rock
  beneath your fingers or the snow crisp under your feet. Perhaps mademoiselle
  herself will some time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At once Sylvia interrupted him with an eager happiness &mdash;</p>

  <p>"Yes, to-morrow," she said.</p>

  <p>"Oho! It is your first mountain, mademoiselle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And Jean here is your guide. Jean and his brother, I suppose?" Michel
  laid his hand affectionately on the guide's shoulder. "You could not do
  better, mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>He looked at her thoughtfully for a little while. She was fresh &mdash;
  fresh as the smell of the earth in spring after a fall of rain. Her eyes, the
  alertness of her face, the eager tones of her voice, were irresistible to
  him, an old tired man. How much more irresistible then to a younger man. Her
  buoyancy would lift such an one clear above his melancholy, though it were
  deep as the sea. He himself, Michel Revailloud, felt twice the fellow he had
  been when he sat in the balcony above the Arve.</p>

  <p>"And what mountain is it to be, mademoiselle?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The girl took a step from the door of the hotel and looked upward. To the
  south, but quite close, the long thin ridge of the Aiguille des Charmoz
  towered jagged and black against the starlit sky. On one pinnacle of that
  ridge a slab of stone was poised like the top of a round table on the slant.
  It was at that particular pinnacle that Sylvia looked.</p>

  <p>"L'Aiguille des Charmoz," said Michel, doubtfully, and Sylvia swung round
  to him and argued against his doubt.</p>

  <p>"But I have trained myself," she said. "I have been up the Brévent and
  Flégère. I am strong, stronger than I look."</p>

  <p>Michel Revailloud smiled.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, I do not doubt you. A young lady who has enthusiasm is very
  hard to tire. It is not because of the difficulty of that rock-climb that I
  thought to suggest &mdash; the Aiguille d'Argentière."</p>

  <p>Sylvia turned with some hesitation to the younger guide.</p>

  <p>"You too spoke of that mountain," she said.</p>

  <p>Michel pressed his advantage.</p>

  <p>"And wisely, mademoiselle. If you will let me advise you, you will sleep
  to-morrow night at the Pavillon de Lognan and the next day climb the Aiguille
  d'Argentière."</p>

  <p>Sylvia looked regretfully up to the ridge of the Charmoz which during this
  last fortnight had greatly attracted her. She turned her eyes from the
  mountain to Revailloud and let them rest quietly upon his face.</p>

  <p>"And why do you advise the Aiguille d'Argentière?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Michel saw her eyes softly shining upon him in the darkness, and all the
  more persisted. Was not his dear patron who must needs be helped to open his
  eyes, since he would not open them himself, going to sleep to-morrow in the
  Pavillon de Lognan? The roads to the Col Dolent and the Aiguille d'Argentière
  both start from that small mountain inn. But this was hardly the reason which
  Michel could give to the young girl who questioned him. He bethought him of
  another argument, a subtle one which he fancied would strongly appeal to her.
  Moreover, there was truth in it.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you why, mademoiselle. It is to be your first mountain. It
  will be a day in your life which you will never forget. Therefore you want it
  to be as complete as possible &mdash; is it not so? It is a good rock-climb,
  the Aiguille des Charmoz &mdash; yes. But the Argentière is more complete.
  There is a glacier, a rock traverse, a couloir up a rock-cliff, and at the
  top of that a steep ice-slope. And that is not all. You want your last step
  on to the summit to reveal a new world to you. On the Charmoz, it is true,
  there is a cleft at the very top up which you scramble between two straight
  walls and you pop your head out above the mountain. Yes, but you see little
  that is new; for before you enter the cleft you see both sides of the
  mountain. With the Argentière it is different. You mount at the last, for
  quite a time behind the mountain with your face to the ice-slope; and then
  suddenly you step out upon the top and the chain of Mont Blanc will strike
  suddenly upon your eyes and heart. See, mademoiselle, I love these mountains
  with a very great pride and I would dearly like you to have that wonderful
  white revelation of a new strange world upon your first ascent."</p>

  <p>Before he had ended, he knew that he had won. He heard the girl draw
  sharply in her breath. She was making for herself a picture of the last step
  from the ice-slope to summit ridge.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said. "It shall be the Aiguille d'Argentière."</p>

  <p>Michel went upon his way out of Chamonix and across the fields. They would
  be sure to speak, those two, to-morrow at the Pavillon de Lognan. If only
  there were no other party there in that small inn! Michel's hopes took a leap
  and reached beyond the Pavillon de Lognan. To ascend one's first mountain
  &mdash; yes, that was enviable and good. But one should have a companion with
  whom one can live over again the raptures of that day, in the after time.
  Well &mdash; perhaps &mdash; perhaps!</p>

  <p>Michel pushed open the door of his cottage, and lit his lamp, without
  after all bethinking him that the room was dark and empty. His ice-axes stood
  in a corner, the polished steel of their adz-heads gleaming in the light; his
  <i>Rücksack</i> and some coils of rope hung upon pegs; his book with the
  signatures and the comments of his patrons lay at his elbow on the table, a
  complete record of his life. But he was not thinking that they had served him
  for the last time. He sat down in his chair and so remained for a little
  while. But a smile was upon his face, and once or twice he chuckled aloud as
  he thought of his high diplomacy. He did not remember at all that to-morrow
  he would lead mules up to the Montanvert and conduct parties on the Mer de
  Glace.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap6"
     id="chap6"><small>CHAPTER 6</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE PAVILLON DE LOGNAN</h2>

  <p class="first">The Pavillon de Lognan is built high upon the southern slope
  of the valley of Chamonix, under the great buttresses of the Aiguille Verte.
  It faces the north and from the railed parapet before its door the path winds
  down through pastures bright with Alpine flowers to the pine woods, and the
  village of Les Tines in the bed of the valley. But at its eastern end a
  precipice drops to the great ice-fall of the Glacier d'Argentière, and night
  and day from far below the roar of the glacier streams enters in at the
  windows and fills the rooms with the music of a river in spate.</p>

  <p>At five o'clock on the next afternoon, Chayne was leaning upon the rail
  looking straight down to the ice-fall. The din of the torrent was in his
  ears, and it was not until a foot sounded lightly close behind him that he
  knew he was no longer alone. He turned round and saw to his surprise the
  over-dainty doll of the Annemasse buffet, the child of the casinos and the
  bathing beaches, Sylvia Thesiger. His surprise was very noticeable and
  Sylvia's face flushed. She made him a little bow and went into the
  chalet.</p>

  <p>Chayne noticed a couple of fresh guides by the door of the guides'
  quarters. He remembered the book which he had seen her reading with so deep
  an interest in the buffet. And in a minute or two she came out again on to
  the earth platform and he saw that she was not overdressed to-day. She was
  simply and warmly dressed in a way which suggested business. On the other
  hand she had not made herself ungainly. He guessed her mountain and named it
  to her.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied. "Please say that it will be fine to-morrow!"</p>

  <p>"I have never seen an evening of better promise," returned Chayne, with a
  smile at her eagerness. The brown cliffs of the Aiguille du Chardonnet just
  across the glacier glowed red in the sunlight; and only a wisp of white cloud
  trailed like a lady's scarf here and there in the blue of the sky. The woman
  of the chalet came out and spoke to him.</p>

  <p>"She wants to know when we will dine," he explained to Sylvia. "There are
  only you and I. We should dine early, for you will have to start early"; and
  he repeated the invariable cry of that year: "There is so very little snow.
  It may take you some time to get off the glacier on to your mountain. There
  is always a crevasse to cross."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Sylvia, with a smile. "The bergschrund."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said Chayne, and in his turn he smiled too. "Of
  course you know these terms. I saw you reading a copy of the 'Alpine
  Journal.'"</p>

  <p>They dined together an hour later with the light of the sunset reddening
  the whitewashed walls of the little simple room and bathing in glory the
  hills without. Sylvia Thesiger could hardly eat for wonder. Her face was
  always to the window, her lips were always parted in a smile, her gray eyes
  bright with happiness.</p>

  <p>"I have never known anything like this," she said. "It is all so strange,
  so very beautiful."</p>

  <p>Her freshness and simplicity laid their charm on him, even as they had
  done on Michel Revailloud the night before. She was as eager as a child to
  get the meal done with and to go out again into the open air, before the
  after-glow had faded from the peaks. There was something almost pathetic in
  her desire to make the very most of such rare moments. Her eagerness so
  clearly told him that such holidays came but seldom in her life. He urged
  her, however, to eat, and when she had done they went out together and sat
  upon the bench, watching in silence the light upon the peaks change from
  purple to rose, the rocks grow cold, and the blue of the sky deepen as the
  night came.</p>

  <p>"You too are making an ascent?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "I am crossing a pass into Italy. I am going away from
  Chamonix altogether."</p>

  <p>Sylvia turned to him; her eyes were gentle with sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I understand that," she said. "I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"You said that once before to me, on the steps of the hotel," said Chayne.
  "It was kind of you. Though I said nothing, I was grateful"; and he was moved
  to open his heart to her, and to speak of his dead friend. The darkness
  gathered about them; he spoke in the curt sentences which men use who shrink
  from any emotional display; he interrupted himself to light his pipe. But
  none the less she understood the reality of his distress. He told her with a
  freedom of which he was not himself at the moment quite aware, of a clean,
  strong friendship which owed nothing to sentiment, which was never fed by
  protestations, which endured through long intervals, and was established by
  the memory of great dangers cheerily encountered and overcome. It had begun
  amongst the mountains, and surely, she thought, it had retained to the end
  something of their inspiration.</p>

  <p>"We first met in the Tyrol, eight years ago. I had crossed a mountain with
  a guide &mdash; the Glockturm &mdash; and came down in the evening to the
  Radurschal Thal where I had heard there was an inn. The evening had turned to
  rain; but from a shoulder of the mountain I had been able to look right down
  the valley and had seen one long low building about four miles from the foot
  of the glacier. I walked through the pastures toward it, and found sitting
  outside the door in the rain the man who was to be my friend. The door was
  locked, and there was no one about the house, nor was there any other house
  within miles. My guide, however, went on. Lattery and I sat out there in the
  rain for a couple of hours, and then an old woman with a big umbrella held
  above her head came down from the upper pastures, driving some cows in front
  of her. She told us that no one had stayed at her inn for fourteen years. But
  she opened her door, lit us a great fire, and cooked us eggs and made us
  coffee. I remember that night as clearly as if it were yesterday. We sat in
  front of the fire with the bedding and the mattresses airing behind us until
  late into the night. The rain got worse too. There was a hole in the thatch
  overhead, and through it I saw the lightning slash the sky, as I lay in bed.
  Very few people ever came up or down that valley; and the next morning, after
  the storm, the chamois were close about the inn, on the grass. We went on
  together. That was the beginning."</p>

  <p>He spoke simply, with a deep quietude of voice. The tobacco glowed and
  grew dull in the bowl of his pipe regularly; the darkness hid his face. But
  the tenderness, almost the amusement with which he dwelt on the little
  insignificant details of that first meeting showed her how very near to him
  it was at this moment.</p>

  <p>"We went from the Tyrol down to Verona and baked ourselves in the sun
  there for a day, under the colonnades, and then came back through the St.
  Gotthard to Göschenen. Do you know the Göschenen Thal? There is a semicircle
  of mountains, the Winterbergen, which closes it in at the head. We climbed
  there together for a week, just he and I and no guides. I remember a
  rock-ridge there. It was barred by a pinnacle which stood up from it &mdash;
  'a gendarme,' as they call it. We had to leave the arête and work out along
  the face of the pinnacle at right angles to the mountain. There was a little
  ledge. You could look down between your feet quite straight to the glacier,
  two thousand feet below. We came to a place where the wall of the pinnacle
  seemed possible. Almost ten feet above us, there was a flaw in the rock which
  elsewhere was quite perpendicular. I was the lightest. So my friend planted
  himself as firmly as he could on the ledge with his hands flat against the
  rock face. There wasn't any handhold, you see, and I climbed out on to his
  back and stood upon his shoulders. I saw that the rock sloped back from the
  flaw or cleft in quite a practicable way. Only there was a big boulder
  resting on the slope within reach, and which we could hardly avoid touching.
  It did not look very secure. So I put out my hand and just touched it &mdash;
  quite, quite gently. But it was so exactly balanced that the least little
  vibration overset it, and I saw it begin to move, very slowly, as if it meant
  no harm whatever. But it was moving, nevertheless, toward me. My chest was on
  a level with the top of the cleft, so that I had a good view of the boulder.
  I couldn't do anything at all. It was much too heavy and big for my arms to
  stop and I couldn't move, of course, since I was standing on Jack Lattery's
  shoulders. There did not seem very much chance, with nothing below us except
  two thousand feet of vacancy. But there was just at my side a little bit of a
  crack in the edge of the cleft, and there was just a chance that the rock
  might shoot out down that cleft past me. I remember standing and watching the
  thing sliding down, not in a rush at all, but very smoothly, almost in a
  friendly sort of way, and I wondered how long it would be before it reached
  me. Luckily some irregularity in the slope of rock just twisted it into the
  crack, and it suddenly shot out into the air at my side with a whizz. It was
  so close to me that it cut the cloth of my sleeve. I had been so fascinated
  by the gentle movement of the boulder that I had forgotten altogether to tell
  Lattery what was happening; and when it whizzed out over his head, he was so
  startled that he nearly lost his balance on the little shelf and we were
  within an ace of following our rock down to the glacier. Those were our early
  days." And he laughed with a low deep ring of amusement in his voice.</p>

  <p>"We were late that day on the mountain," he resumed, "and it was dark when
  we got down to a long snow-slope at its foot. It was new ground to us. We
  were very tired. We saw it glimmering away below us. It might end in a
  crevasse and a glacier for all we knew, and we debated whether we should be
  prudent or chance it. We chanced the crevasse. We sat down and glissaded in
  the dark with only the vaguest idea where we should end. Altogether we had
  very good times, he and I. Well, they have come to an end on the Glacier des
  Nantillons."</p>

  <p>Chayne became silent; Sylvia Thesiger sat at his side and did not
  interrupt. In front of them the pastures slid away into darkness. Only a few
  small clear lights shining in the chalets told them there were other people
  awake in the world. Except for the reverberation of the torrent deep in the
  gorge at their right, no sound at all broke the deep silence. Chayne knocked
  the ashes from his pipe.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "I have been talking to you about one whom
  you never knew. You were so quiet that I seemed to be merely remembering to
  myself."</p>

  <p>"I was so quiet," Sylvia explained, "because I wished you to go on. I was
  very glad to hear you. It was all new and strange and very pleasant to me
  &mdash; this story of your friendship. As strange and pleasant as this cool,
  quiet night here, a long way from the hotels and the noise, on the edge of
  the snow. For I have heard little of such friendships and I have seen still
  less."</p>

  <p>Chayne's thoughts were suddenly turned from his dead friend to this, the
  living companion at his side. There was something rather sad and pitiful in
  the tone of her voice, no less than in the words she used. She spoke with so
  much humility. He was aware with a kind of shock, that here was a woman, not
  a child. He turned his eyes to her, as he had turned his thoughts. He could
  see dimly the profile of her face. It was still as the night itself. She was
  looking straight in front of her into the darkness. He pondered upon her life
  and how she bore with it, and how she had kept herself unspoiled by its
  associations. Of the saving grace of her dreams he knew nothing. But the
  picture of her mother was vivid to his eyes, the outlawed mother, shunned
  instinctively by the women, noisy and shrill, and making her companions of
  the would-be fashionable loiterers and the half-pay officers run to seed.
  That she bore it ill her last words had shown him. They had thrown a stray
  ray of light upon a dark place which seemed a place of not much
  happiness.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad that you are here to-night," he said. "It has been kind of
  you to listen. I rather dreaded this evening."</p>

  <p>Though what he said was true, it was half from pity that he said it. He
  wished her to feel her value. And in reply she gave him yet another glimpse
  into the dark place.</p>

  <p>"Your friend," she said, "must have been much loved in Chamonix."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"So many guides came of their own accord to search for him."</p>

  <p>Again Chayne's face was turned quickly toward her. Here indeed was a sign
  of the people amongst whom she lived, and of their unillumined thoughts.
  There must be the personal reason always, the personal reason or money.
  Outside of these, there were no motives. He answered her gently:</p>

  <p>"No; I think that was not the reason. How shall I put it to you?" He
  leaned forward with his elbows upon his knees, and spoke slowly, choosing his
  words. "I think these guides obeyed a law, a law not of any man's making, and
  the one law last broken &mdash; the law that what you know, that you must do,
  if by doing it you can save a life. I should think nine medals out of ten
  given by the Humane Society are given because of the compulsion of that law.
  If you can swim, sail a boat, or climb a mountain, and the moment comes when
  a life can only be saved if you use your knowledge &mdash; well, you have got
  to use it. That's the law. Very often, I have no doubt, it's quite
  reluctantly obeyed, in most cases I think it's obeyed by instinct, without
  consideration of the consequences. But it <i>is</i> obeyed, and the guides
  obeyed it when so many of them came with me on to the Glacier des
  Nantillons."</p>

  <p>He heard the girl at his side draw in a sharp breath. She shivered.</p>

  <p>"You are cold?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered. "But that, too, is all strange to me. I should have
  known of that law without the need to be told of it. But I shall not forget
  it."</p>

  <p>Again humility was very audible in the quiet tone of her voice. She
  understood that she had been instructed. She felt she should not have needed
  it. She faced her ignorance frankly.</p>

  <p>"What one knows, that one must do," she repeated, fixing the words in her
  mind, "if by doing it one can save a life. No, I shall not forget that."</p>

  <p>She rose from the seat.</p>

  <p>"I must go in."</p>

  <p>"Yes," cried Chayne, starting up. "You have stayed up too long as it is.
  You will be tired to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Not till to-morrow evening," she said, with a laugh. She looked upward to
  the starlit sky. "It will be fine, I hope. Oh, it <i>must</i> be fine. To-
  morrow is my one day. I do so want it to be perfect," she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you need fear."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand to him.</p>

  <p>"This is good-by, I suppose," she said, and she did not hide the regret
  the words brought to her.</p>

  <p>Chayne took her hand and kept it for a second or two. He ought to start an
  hour and a half before her. That he knew very well. But he answered:</p>

  <p>"No. We go the same road for a little while. When do you start?"</p>

  <p>"At half past one."</p>

  <p>"I too. It will be daybreak before we say good-by. I wonder whether you
  will sleep at all to-night. I never do the first night."</p>

  <p>He spoke lightly, and she answered him in the same key.</p>

  <p>"I shall hardly know whether I sleep or wake, with the noise of that
  stream rising through my window. For so far back as I can remember I always
  dream of running water."</p>

  <p>The words laid hold upon Chayne's imagination and fixed her in his
  memories. He knew nothing of her really, except just this one curious fact.
  She dreamed of running water. Somehow it was fitting that she should. There
  was a kind of resemblance; running water was, in a way, an image of her. She
  seemed in her nature to be as clear and fresh; yet she was as elusive; and
  when she laughed, her laugh had a music as light and free.</p>

  <p>She went into the chalet. Through the window Chayne saw her strike a match
  and hold it to the candle. She stood for a moment looking out at him gravely,
  with the light shining upward upon her young face. Then a smile hesitated
  upon her lips and slowly took possession of her cheeks and eyes. She turned
  and went into her room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap7"
     id="chap7"><small>CHAPTER 7</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE AIGUILLE D'ARGENTIÈRE</h2>

  <p class="first">Chayne smoked another pipe alone and then walking to the end
  of the little terrace looked down on to the glistening field of ice below.
  Along that side of the chalet no light was burning. Was she listening? Was
  she asleep? The pity which had been kindled within him grew as he thought
  upon her. To-morrow she would be going back to a life she clearly hated. On
  the whole he came to the conclusion that the world might have been better
  organized. He lit his candle and went to bed, and it seemed that not five
  minutes had passed before one of his guides knocked upon his door. When he
  came into the living-room Sylvia Thesiger was already breakfasting.</p>

  <p>"Did you sleep?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I was too excited," she answered. "But I am not tired"; and certainly
  there was no trace of fatigue in her appearance.</p>

  <p>They started at half past one and went up behind the hut.</p>

  <p>The stars shimmered overhead in a dark and cloudless sky. The night was
  still; as yet there was no sign of dawn. The great rock cliffs of the
  Chardonnet across the glacier and the towering ice-slopes of the Aiguille
  Verte beneath which they passed were all hidden in darkness. They might have
  been walking on some desolate plain of stones flat from horizon to horizon.
  They walked in single file, Jean leading with a lighted lantern in his hand,
  so that Sylvia, who followed next, might pick her way amongst the boulders.
  Thus they marched for two hours along the left bank of the glacier and then
  descended on to ice. They went forward partly on moraine, partly on ice at
  the foot of the crags of the Aiguille Verte. And gradually the darkness
  thinned. Dim masses of black rock began to loom high overhead, and to all
  seeming very far away. The sky paled, the dim masses of rock drew near about
  the climbers, and over the steep walls, the light flowed into the white basin
  of the glacier as though from every quarter of the sky.</p>

  <p>Sylvia stopped and Chayne came up with her.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked; and as he saw her face his thoughts were suddenly swept
  back to the morning when the beauty of the ice-world was for the first time
  vouchsafed to him. He seemed to recapture the fine emotion of that
  moment.</p>

  <p>Sylvia stood gazing with parted lips up that wide and level glacier to its
  rock-embattled head. The majestic silence of the place astounded her. There
  was no whisper of wind, no rustling of trees, no sound of any bird. As yet
  too there was no crack of ice, no roar of falling stones. And as the silence
  surprised her ears, so the simplicity of color smote upon her eyes. There
  were no gradations. White ice filled the basin and reached high into the
  recesses of the mountains, hanging in rugged glaciers upon their flanks, and
  streaking the gullies with smooth narrow ribands. And about the ice, and
  above it, circling it in, black walls of rock towered high, astonishingly
  steep and broken at the top into pinnacles of an exquisite beauty.</p>

  <p>"I shall be very glad to have seen this," said Sylvia, as she stored the
  picture in her mind, "more glad than I am even now. It will be a good memory
  to fall back upon when things are troublesome."</p>

  <p>"Must things be troublesome?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't let me spoil my one day," she said, with a smile.</p>

  <p>She moved on, and Chayne, falling back, spoke for a little with his
  guides. A little further on Jean stopped.</p>

  <p>"That is our mountain, mademoiselle," he said, pointing eastward across
  the glacier.</p>

  <p>Sylvia turned in that direction.</p>

  <p>Straight in front of her a bay of ice ran back, sloping ever upward, and
  around the bay there rose a steep wall of cliffs which in the center
  sharpened precipitously to an apex. The apex was not a point but a rounded
  level ridge of snow which curved over on the top of the cliffs like a billow
  of foam. A tiny black tower of rock stood alone on the northern end of the
  snow-ridge.</p>

  <p>"That, mademoiselle, is the Aiguille d'Argentière. We cross the glacier
  here."</p>

  <p>Jean put the rope about her waist, fixing it with the fisherman's bend,
  and tied one end about his own, using the overhand knot, while his brother
  tied on behind. They then turned at right angles to their former march and
  crossed the glacier, keeping the twenty feet of rope which separated each
  person extended. Once Jean looked back and uttered an exclamation of
  surprise. For he saw Chayne and his guides following across the glacier
  behind, and Chayne's road to the Col Dolent at the head of the glacier lay
  straight ahead upon their former line of advance. However he said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>They crossed the bergschrund with less difficulty than they had
  anticipated, and ascending a ridge of debris, by the side of the lateral
  glacier which descended from the cliffs of the Aiguille d'Argentière, they
  advanced into the bay under the southern wall of the Aiguille du Chardonnet.
  On the top of this moraine Jean halted, and the party breakfasted, and while
  they breakfasted Chayne told Sylvia something of that mountain's history. "It
  is not the most difficult of peaks," said he, "but it has associations, which
  some of the new rock-climbs have not. The pioneers came here." Right behind
  them there was a gap, the pass between their mountain and the Aiguille du
  Chardonnet. "From that pass Moore and Whymper first tried to reach the top by
  following the crest of the cliffs, but they found it impracticable. Whymper
  tried again, but this time up the face of the cliffs further on to the south
  and just to the left of the summit. He failed, came back again and conquered.
  We follow his road."</p>

  <p>And while they looked up the dead white of that rounded summit ridge
  changed to a warm rosy color and all about that basin the topmost peaks took
  fire.</p>

  <p>"It is the sun," said he.</p>

  <p>Sylvia looked across the valley. The great ice-triangle of the Aiguille
  Verte flashed and sparkled. The slopes of the Les Droites and Mont Dolent
  were hung with jewels; even the black precipices of the Tour Noir grew warm
  and friendly. But at the head of the glacier a sheer unbroken wall of rock
  swept round in the segment of a circle, and this remained still dead black
  and the glacier at its foot dead white. At one point in the knife-like edge
  of this wall there was a depression, and from the depression a riband of ice
  ran, as it seemed from where they sat, perpendicularly down to the Glacier
  d'Argentière.</p>

  <p>"That is the Col Dolent," said Chayne. "Very little sunlight ever creeps
  down there."</p>

  <p>Sylvia shivered as she looked. She had never seen anything so somber, so
  sinister, as that precipitous curtain of rock and its riband of ice. It
  looked like a white band painted on a black wall.</p>

  <p>"It looks very dangerous," she said, slowly.</p>

  <p>"It needs care," said Chayne.</p>

  <p>"Especially this year when there is so little snow," added Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Twelve hundred feet of ice at an angle of fifty degrees."</p>

  <p>"And the bergschrund's just beneath."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you must not slip on the Col Dolent," said he, quietly.</p>

  <p>Sylvia was silent a little while. Then she said with a slight
  hesitation:</p>

  <p>"And you cross that pass to-day?"</p>

  <p>There was still more hesitation in Chayne's voice as he answered:</p>

  <p>"Well, no! You see, this is your first mountain. And you have only two
  guides."</p>

  <p>Sylvia looked at him seriously.</p>

  <p>"How many should I have taken for the Aiguille d'Argentière? Twelve?"</p>

  <p>Chayne smiled feebly.</p>

  <p>"Well, no," and his confusion increased. "Two, as a rule, are enough
  &mdash; unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unless the amateur is very clumsy," she added. "Thank you, Captain
  Chayne."</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean that," he cried. He had no idea whether she was angry or
  not. She was just looking quietly and steadily into his face and waiting for
  his explanation.</p>

  <p>"Well, the truth is," he blurted out, "I wanted to go up the Aiguille
  d'Argentière with you," and he saw a smile dimple her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I am honored," she said, and the tone of her voice showed besides that
  she was very glad.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but it wasn't only for the sake of your company," he said, and
  stopped. "I don't seem to be very polite, do I?" he said, lamentably.</p>

  <p>"Not very," she replied.</p>

  <p>"What I mean is this," he explained. "Ever since we started this morning,
  I have been recapturing my own sensations on my first ascent. Watching you,
  your enjoyment, your eagerness to live fully every moment of this day, I
  almost feel as if I too had come fresh to the mountains, as if the Argentière
  were my first peak."</p>

  <p>He saw the blood mount into her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Was that the reason why you questioned me as to what I thought and felt?"
  she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were testing me," she said, slowly. "I thought you were
  trying whether I was &mdash; worthy"; and once again humility had framed her
  words and modulated their utterance. She recognized without rancor, but in
  distress, that people had the right to look on her as without the pale.</p>

  <p>The guides packed up the <i>Rücksacks</i>, and they started once more up
  the moraine. In a little while they descended on to the lateral glacier which
  descending from the recesses of the Aiguille d'Argentière in front of them
  flowed into the great basin behind. They roped together now in one party and
  ascended the glacier diagonally, rounding a great buttress which descends
  from the rock ledge and bisects the ice, and drawing close to the steep
  cliffs. In a little while they crossed the bergschrund from the glacier on to
  the wall of mountain, and traversing by easy rocks at the foot of the cliffs
  came at last to a big steep gully filled with hard ice which led up to the
  ridge just below the final peak.</p>

  <p>"This is our way" said Jean. "We ascend by the rocks at the side."</p>

  <p>They breakfasted again and began to ascend the rocks to the left of the
  great gully, Sylvia following second behind her leading guide. The rocks were
  not difficult, but they were very steep and at times loose. Moreover, Jean
  climbed fast and Sylvia had much ado to keep pace with him. But she would not
  call on him to slacken his pace, and she was most anxious not to come up on
  the rope but to climb with her own hands and feet. This they ascended for the
  better part of an hour and Jean halted on a convenient ledge. Sylvia had time
  to look down. She had climbed with her face to the wall of rock, her eyes
  searching quickly for her holds, fixing her feet securely, gripping firmly
  with her hands, avoiding the loose boulders. Moreover, the rope had worried
  her. When she had left it at its length between herself and the guide in
  front of her, it would hang about her feet, threatening to trip her, or catch
  as though in active malice in any crack which happened to be handy. If she
  shortened it and held it in her hands, there would come a sudden tug from
  above as the leader raised himself from one ledge to another which almost
  overset her.</p>

  <p>Now, however, flushed with her exertion and glad to draw her breath at her
  ease, she looked down and was astonished. So far below her already seemed the
  glacier she had left, so steep the rocks up which she had climbed.</p>

  <p>"You are not tired?" said Chayne.</p>

  <p>Sylvia laughed. Tired, when a dream was growing real, when she was
  actually on the mountain face! She turned her face again to the rock-wall and
  in a little more than an hour after leaving the foot of the gully she stepped
  out on to a patch of snow on the shoulder of the mountain. She stood in
  sunlight, and all the country to the east was suddenly unrolled before her
  eyes. A moment before and her face was to the rock, now at her feet the steep
  snow-slopes dropped to the Glacier of Saleinaz. The crags of the Aiguille
  Dorées, and some green uplands gave color to the glittering world of ice, and
  far away towered the white peaks of the Grand Combin and the Weisshorn in a
  blue cloudless sky, and to the left over the summit of the Grande Fourche she
  saw the huge embattlements of the Oberland. She stood absorbed while the rest
  of the party ascended to her side. She hardly knew indeed that they were
  there until Chayne standing by her asked:</p>

  <p>"You are not disappointed?"</p>

  <p>She made no reply. She had no words wherewith to express the emotion which
  troubled her to the depths.</p>

  <p>They rested for a while on this level patch of snow. To their right the
  ridge ran sharply up to the summit. But not by that ridge was the summit to
  be reached. They turned over on to the eastern face of the mountain and
  traversed in a straight line across the great snow-slope which sweeps down in
  one white unbroken curtain toward the Glacier of Saleinaz. Their order had
  been changed. First Jean advanced. Chayne followed and after him came
  Sylvia.</p>

  <p>The leading guide kicked a step or two in the snow. Then he used the adz
  of his ax. A few steps still, and he halted.</p>

  <p>"Ice," he said, and from that spot to the mountain top he used the
  pick.</p>

  <p>The slope was at a steep angle, the ice very hard, and each step had to be
  cut with care, especially on the traverse where the whole party moved across
  the mountain upon the same level, and there was no friendly hand above to
  give a pull upon the rope. The slope ran steeply down beneath them, then
  curved over a brow and steepened yet more.</p>

  <p>"Are the steps near enough together?" Chayne asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, though she had to stretch in her stride.</p>

  <p>And upon that Jean dug his pick in the slope at his side and turned
  round.</p>

  <p>"Lean well way from the slope, mademoiselle, not toward it. There is less
  chance then of slipping from the steps," he said anxiously, and there came a
  look of surprise upon his face. For he saw that already of her own thought
  she was standing straight in her steps, thrusting herself out from the slope
  by pressing the pick of her ax against it at the level of her waist. And more
  than once thereafter Jean turned about and watched her with a growing
  perplexity. Chayne looked to see whether her face showed any sign of fear. On
  the contrary she was looking down that great sweep of ice with an actual
  exultation. And it was not ignorance which allowed her to exult. The evident
  anxiety of Chayne's words, and the silence which since had fallen upon one
  and all were alone enough to assure her that here was serious work. But she
  had been reading deeply of the Alps, and in all the histories of mountain
  exploits which she had read, of climbs up vertical cracks in sheer walls of
  rocks, balancings upon ridges sharp as a knife edge, crawlings over smooth
  slabs with nowhere to rest the feet or hands, it was the ice-slope which had
  most kindled her imagination. The steep, smooth, long ice-slope, white upon
  the surface, grayish-green or even black where the ax had cut the step, the
  place where no slip must be made. She had lain awake at nights listening to
  the roar of the streets beneath her window and picturing it, now sleeping in
  the sunlight, now enwreathed in mists which opened and showed still higher
  heights and still lower depths, now whipped angrily with winds which tore off
  the surface icicles and snow, and sent them swirling like smoke about the
  shoulders of the peak. She had dreamed herself on to it, half shrinking, half
  eager, and now she was actually upon one and she felt no fear. She could not
  but exult.</p>

  <p>The sunlight was hot upon this face of the mountain; yet her feet grew
  cold, as she stood patiently in her steps, advancing slowly as the man before
  her moved. Once as she stood, she moved her foot and scratched the sole of
  her boot on the ice to level a roughness in the step, and at once she saw
  Chayne and the guide in front drive the picks of their axes hard into the
  slope at their side and stand tense as if expecting a jerk upon the rope.
  Afterward they both looked round at her, and seeing she was safe turned back
  again to their work, the guide cutting the steps, Chayne polishing them
  behind him.</p>

  <p>In a little while the guide turned his face to the slope and cut upward
  instead of across. The slope was so steep that instead of cutting zigzags
  across its face, he chopped pigeon holes straight up. They moved from one to
  the other as on a ladder, and their knees touched the ice as they stood
  upright in the steps. For a couple of hours the axes never ceased, and then
  the leader made two or three extra steps at the side of the staircase. On to
  one of them he moved out, Chayne went up and joined him.</p>

  <p>"Come, mademoiselle," he said, and he drew in the rope as Sylvia advanced.
  She climbed up level with them on the ladder and waited, not knowing why they
  stood aside.</p>

  <p>"Go on, mademoiselle," said the guide. She took another step or two upon
  snow and uttered a cry. She had looked suddenly over the top of the mountain
  on to the Aiguille Verte and the great pile of Mont Blanc, even as Revailloud
  had told her that she would. The guide had stood aside that she might be the
  first to step out upon the summit of the mountain. She stood upon the narrow
  ridge of snow, at her feet the rock-cliffs plastered with bulging masses of
  ice fell sheer to the glacier.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Her first glance was downward to the Col Dolent. Even at this hour when
  the basin of the valley was filled with sunshine that one corner at the head
  of the Glacier d'Argentière was still dead white, dead black. She shivered
  once more as she looked at it &mdash; so grim and so menacing the rock-wall
  seemed, so hard and steep the riband of ice. Then Chayne joined her on the
  ridge. They sat down and ate their meal and lay for an hour sunning
  themselves in the clear air.</p>

  <p>"You could have had no better day," said Chayne.</p>

  <p>Only a few white scarfs of cloud flitted here and there across the sky and
  their shadows chased each other across the glittering slopes of ice and snow.
  The triangle of the Aiguille Verte was over against her, the beautiful ridges
  of Les Courtes and Les Droites to her right and beyond them the massive domes
  and buttresses of the great white mountain. Sylvia lay upon the eastern slope
  of the Argentière looking over the brow, not wanting to speak, and certainly
  not listening to any word that was uttered. Her soul was at peace. The
  long-continued tension of mind and muscle, the excitement of that last ice-
  slope, both were over and had brought their reward. She looked out upon a
  still and peaceful world, wonderfully bright, wonderfully beautiful, and
  wonderfully colored. Here a spire would pierce the sunlight with slabs of red
  rock interspersed amongst its gray; there ice-cliffs sparkled as though
  strewn with jewels, bulged out in great green knobs, showed now a grim gray,
  now a transparent blue. At times a distant rumble like thunder far away told
  that the ice-fields were hurling their avalanches down. Once or twice she
  heard a great roar near at hand, and Chayne pointing across the valleys would
  show her what seemed to be a handful of small stones whizzing down the rocks
  and ice-gullies of the Aiguille Verte. But on the whole this new world was
  silent, communing with the heavens. She was in the hushed company of the
  mountains. Days there would be when these sunlit ridges would be mere blurs
  of driving storm, when the wind would shriek about the gullies, and dark
  mists swirl around the peaks. But on this morning there was no anger on the
  heights.</p>

  <p>"Yes &mdash; you could have had no better day for your first mountain,
  mademoiselle," said Jean, as he stood beside her. "But this is not your first
  mountain."</p>

  <p>She turned to him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is."</p>

  <p>Her guide bowed to her.</p>

  <p>"Then, mademoiselle, you have great gifts. For you stood upon that ice-
  slope and moved along and up it, as only people of experience stand and move.
  I noticed you. On the rocks, too, you had the instinct for the hand-grip and
  the foothold and with which foot to take the step. And that instinct,
  mademoiselle, comes as a rule only with practice." He paused and looked at
  her perplexity.</p>

  <p>"Moreover, mademoiselle, you remind me of some one," he added. "I cannot
  remember who it is, or why you remind me of him. But you remind me of some
  one very much." He picked up the <i>Rücksack</i> which he had taken from his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>It was half past eleven. Sylvia took a last look over the wide prospect of
  jagged ridge, ice pinnacles and rock spires. She looked down once more upon
  the slim snow peak of Mont Dolent and the grim wall of rocks at the Col.</p>

  <p>"I shall never forget this," she said, with shining eyes. "Never."</p>

  <p>The fascination of the mountains was upon her. Something new had come into
  her life that morning which would never fail her to the very end, which would
  color all her days, however dull, which would give her memories in which to
  find solace, longings wherewith to plan the future. This she felt and some of
  this her friend understood.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "You understand the difference it makes to one's whole
  life. Each year passes so quickly looking back and looking forward."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I understand," she said.</p>

  <p>"You will come back?"</p>

  <p>But this time she did not answer at once. She stood looking thoughtfully
  out over the bridge of the Argentière. It seemed to Chayne that she was
  coming slowly to some great decision which would somehow affect all her life.
  Then she said &mdash; and it seemed to him that she had made her
  decision:</p>

  <p>"I do not know. Perhaps I never shall come back."</p>

  <p>They turned away and went carefully down the slope. Again her leading
  guide, who on the return journey went last, was perplexed by that instinct
  for the mountain side which had surprised him. The technique came to her so
  naturally. She turned her back to the slope, and thus descended, she knew
  just the right level at which to drive in the pick of her ax that she might
  lower herself to the next hole in their ice-ladder. Finally as they came down
  the rocks by the great couloir to the glacier, he cried out:</p>

  <p>"Ah! Now, mademoiselle, I know who it is you remind me of. I have been
  watching you. I know now."</p>

  <p>She looked up.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"An English gentleman I once climbed with for a whole season many years
  ago. A great climber, mademoiselle! Captain Chayne will know his name.
  Gabriel Strood."</p>

  <p>"Gabriel Strood!" she cried, and then she laughed. "I too know his name.
  You are flattering me, Jean."</p>

  <p>But Jean would not admit it.</p>

  <p>"I am not, mademoiselle," he insisted. "I do not say you have his skill
  &mdash; how should you? But there are certain movements, certain neat ways of
  putting the hands and feet. Yes, mademoiselle, you remind me of him."</p>

  <p>Sylvia thought no more of his words at the moment. They reached the
  lateral glacier, descended it and crossed the Glacier d'Argentière. They
  found their stone-encumbered pathway of the morning and at three o'clock
  stood once more upon the platform in front of the Pavillon de Lognan. Then
  she rested for a while, saying very little.</p>

  <p>"You are tired?" he said.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied. "But this day has made a great difference to me."</p>

  <p>Her guides approached her and she said no more upon the point. But Chayne
  had no doubt that she was referring to that decision which she had taken on
  the summit of the peak. She stood up to go.</p>

  <p>"You stay here to-night?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You cross the Col Dolent to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>She looked at him quickly and then away.</p>

  <p>"You will be careful? In the shadow there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment or two, looking up the glacier toward the
  Aiguille d'Argentière.</p>

  <p>"I thank you very much for coming with me," and again the humility in her
  voice, as of one outside the door, touched and hurt him. "I am very
  grateful," and here a smile lightened her grave face, "and I am rather
  proud!"</p>

  <p>"You came up to Lognan at a good time for me," he answered, as they shook
  hands. "I shall cross the Col Dolent with a better heart to-morrow."</p>

  <p>They shook hands, and he asked:</p>

  <p>"Shall I see no more of you?"</p>

  <p>"That is as you will," she replied, simply.</p>

  <p>"I should like to. In Paris, perhaps, or wherever you are likely to be. I
  am on leave now for some months."</p>

  <p>She thought for a second or two. Then she said:</p>

  <p>"If you will give me your address, I will write to you. I think I shall be
  in England."</p>

  <p>"I live in Sussex, on the South Downs."</p>

  <p>She took his card, and as she turned away she pointed to the Aiguille
  d'Argentière.</p>

  <p>"I shall dream of that to-night."</p>

  <p>"Surely not," he replied, laughing down to her over the wooden balustrade.
  "You will dream of running water."</p>

  <p>She glanced up at him in surprise that he should have remembered this
  strange quality of hers. Then she turned away and went down to the pine woods
  and the village of Les Tines.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap8"

  <br>
  SYLVIA PARTS FROM HER MOTHER</h2>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile Mrs. Thesiger laughed her shrill laugh and chatted
  noisily in the garden of the hotel. She picnicked on the day of Sylvia's
  ascent amongst the sham ruins on the road to Sallanches with a few detached
  idlers of various nationalities.</p>

  <p>"Quite, quite charming," she cried, and she rippled with enthusiasm over
  the artificial lake and the artificial rocks amongst which she seemed so
  appropriate a figure; and she shrugged her pretty shoulders over the
  eccentricities of her daughter, who was undoubtedly burning her complexion to
  the color of brick-dust among those stupid mountains. She came back a trifle
  flushed in the cool of the afternoon, and in the evening slipped discreetly
  into the little Cercle at the back of the Casino, where she played baccarat
  in a company which flattery could hardly have termed doubtful. She was indeed
  not displeased to be rid of her unsatisfactory daughter for a night and a
  couple of days.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia won't fit in."</p>

  <p>Thus for a long time she had been accustomed piteously to complain; and
  with ever more reason. Less and less did Sylvia fit in with Mrs. Thesiger's
  scheme of life. It was not that the girl resisted or complained. Mrs.
  Thesiger would have understood objections and complaints. She would not have
  minded them; she could have coped with them. There would have been little
  scenes, with accusations of ingratitude, of undutifulness, and Mrs. Thesiger
  was not averse to the excitement of little scenes. But Sylvia never
  complained; she maintained a reserve, a mystery which her mother found very
  uncomfortable. "She has no sympathy," said Mrs. Thesiger. Moreover, she would
  grow up, and she would grow up in beauty and in freshness. Mrs. Thesiger did
  her best. She kept her dressed in a style which suited a younger girl, or
  rather, which would have suited a younger girl had it been less decorative
  and extreme. Again Sylvia did not complain. She followed her usual practice
  and shut her mind to the things which displeased her so completely, that they
  ceased to trouble her. But Mrs. Thesiger never knew that secret; and often,
  when in the midst of her chatter she threw a glance at the elaborate figure
  of her daughter, sitting apart with her lace skirts too short, her heels too
  high, her hat too big and too fancifully trimmed, she would see her
  madonna-like face turned toward her, and her dark eyes thoughtfully dwelling
  upon her. At such times there would come an uncomfortable sensation that she
  was being weighed and found wanting; or a question would leap in her mind and
  bring with it fear, and the same question which she had asked herself in the
  train on the way to Chamonix.</p>

  <p>"You ask me about my daughter?" she once exclaimed pettishly to Monsieur
  Pettigrat. "Upon my word, I really know nothing of her except one ridiculous
  thing. She always dreams of running water. Now, I ask you, what can you do
  with a daughter so absurd that she dreams of running water?"</p>

  <p>Monsieur Pettigrat was a big, broad, uncommon man; he knew that he was
  uncommon, and dressed accordingly in a cloak and a brigand's hat; he saw what
  others did not, and spoke in a manner suitably impressive.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you, madame, about your daughter," he said somberly. "To me
  she has a fated look."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thesiger was a little consoled to think that she had a daughter with
  a fated look.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if others have noticed it," she said, cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Monsieur Pettigrat. "No others. Only I."</p>

  <p>"There! That's just like Sylvia," cried Mrs. Thesiger, in exasperation.
  "She has a fated look and makes nothing of it."</p>

  <p>But the secret of her discontent was just a woman's jealousy of a younger
  rival. Men were beginning to turn from her toward her daughter. That Sylvia
  never competed only made the sting the sharper. The grave face with its
  perfect oval, which smiled so rarely, but in so winning a way, its delicate
  color, its freshness, were points which she could not forgive her daughter.
  She felt faded and yellow beside her, she rouged more heavily on account of
  her, she looked with more apprehension at the crow's-feet which were
  beginning to show about the corners of her eyes, and the lines which were
  beginning to run from the nostrils to the corners of her mouth.</p>

  <p>Sylvia reached the hotel in time for dinner, and as she sat with her
  mother, drinking her coffee in the garden afterward, Monsieur Pettigrat
  planted himself before the little iron table.</p>

  <p>He shook his head, which was what his friends called "leonine."</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," he said, in his most impressive voice, "I envy you."</p>

  <p>Sylvia looked up at him with a little smile of mischief upon her lips.</p>

  <p>"And why, monsieur?"</p>

  <p>He waved his arm magnificently.</p>

  <p>"I watched you at dinner. You are of the elect, mademoiselle, for whom the
  snow peaks have a message."</p>

  <p>Sylvia's smile faded from her face.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so, monsieur," she said, gravely, and her mother interposed
  testily:</p>

  <p>"A message! Ridiculous! There are only two words in the message, my dear.
  Cold-cream! and be sure you put it on your face before you go to bed."</p>

  <p>Sylvia apparently did not hear her mother's comment. At all events she
  disregarded it, and Monsieur Pettigrat once again shook his head at Sylvia
  with a kindly magnificence.</p>

  <p>"They have no message for me, mademoiselle," he said, with a sigh, as
  though he for once regretted that he was so uncommon. "I once went up there
  to see." He waved his hand generally to the chain of Mont Blanc and drifted
  largely away.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thesiger, however, was to hear more definitely of that message two
  days later. It was after dinner. She was sitting in the garden with her
  daughter on a night of moonlight; behind them rose the wall of mountains,
  silent and shadowed, in front were the lights of the little town, and the
  clatter of its crowded streets. Between the town and the mountains, at the
  side of the hotel this garden lay, a garden of grass and trees, where the
  moonlight slept in white brilliant pools of light, or dripped between the
  leaves of the branches. It partook alike of the silence of the hills and the
  noise of the town, for a murmur of voices was audible from this and that
  point, and under the shadows of the trees could be seen the glimmer of
  light-colored frocks and the glow of cigars waxing and waning. A waiter came
  across the garden with some letters for Mrs. Thesiger. There were none for
  Sylvia and she was used to none, for she had no girl friends, and though at
  times men wrote her letters she did not answer them.</p>

  <p>A lamp burned near at hand. Mrs. Thesiger opened her letters and read
  them. She threw them on to the table when she had read them through. But
  there was one which angered her, and replacing it in its envelope, she tossed
  it so petulantly aside that it slid off the iron table and fell at Sylvia's
  feet. Sylvia stooped and picked it up. It had fallen face upward.</p>

  <p>"This is from my father."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thesiger looked up startled. It was the first time that Sylvia had
  ever spoken of him to her. A wariness come into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I want to go to him."</p>

  <p>Sylvia spoke very simply and gently, looking straight into her mother's
  face with that perplexing steadiness of gaze which told so very little of
  what thoughts were busy behind it. Her mother turned her face aside. She was
  rather frightened. For a while she made no reply at all, but her face beneath
  its paint looked haggard and old in the white light, and she raised her hand
  to her heart. When she did speak, her voice shook.</p>

  <p>"You have never seen your father. He has never seen you. He and I parted
  before you were born."</p>

  <p>"But he writes to you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he writes to me," and for all that she tried, she could not
  altogether keep a tone of contempt out of her voice. She added with some
  cruelty: "But he never mentions you. He has never once inquired after you,
  never once."</p>

  <p>Sylvia looked very wistfully at the letter, but her purpose was not
  shaken.</p>

  <p>"Mother, I want to go to him," she persisted. Her lips trembled a little,
  and with a choke of the voice, a sob half caught back, she added: "I am most
  unhappy here."</p>

  <p>The rarity of a complaint from Sylvia moved her mother strangely. There
  was a forlornness, moreover, in her appealing attitude. Just for a moment
  Mrs. Thesiger began to think of early days of which the memory was at once a
  pain and a reproach. A certain little village underneath the great White
  Horse on the Dorsetshire Downs rose with a disturbing vividness before her
  eyes. She almost heard the mill stream babble by. In that village of Sutton
  Poyntz she had herself been born, and to it she had returned, caught back
  again for a little while by her own country and her youth, that Sylvia might
  be born there too. These months had made a kind of green oasis in her life.
  She had rested there in a farm-house, after a time of much turbulence, with
  the music of running water night and day in her ears, a high-walled garden of
  flowers and grass about her, and the downs with the shadow-filled hollows,
  and brown treeless slopes rising up from her very feet. She could not but
  think of that short time of peace, and her voice softened as she answered her
  daughter.</p>

  <p>"We don't keep step, Sylvia," she said, with an uneasy laugh. "I know
  that. But, after all, would you be happier with your father, even if he wants
  to keep you! You have all you want here &mdash; frocks, amusement,
  companions. Try to be more friendly with people."</p>

  <p>But Sylvia merely shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I can't go on any longer like this," she said, slowly. "I can't, mother.
  If my father won't have me, I must see what I can do. Of course, I can't do
  much. I don't know anything. But I am too unhappy here. I cannot endure the
  life we are living without a home or &mdash; respect,&mdash;" Sylvia had not
  meant to use that word. But it had slipped out before she was aware. She
  broke off and turned her eyes again to her mother. They were very bright, for
  the moonlight glistened upon tears. But the softness had gone from her
  mother's face. She had grown in a moment hard, and her voice rang hard as she
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Why do you think that your father and I parted? Come, let me hear!"</p>

  <p>Sylvia turned her head away.</p>

  <p>"I don't think about it," she said, gently. "I don't want to think about
  it. I just think that he left you, because you did not keep step either."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he left me? Not I him? Then why does he write to me?"</p>

  <p>The voice was growing harder with every word.</p>

  <p>"I suppose because he is kind"; and at that simple explanation Sylvia's
  mother laughed with a bitter amusement. Sylvia sat scraping the gravel with
  her slipper.</p>

  <p>"Don't do that!" cried her mother, irritably. Then she asked suddenly a
  question which startled her daughter.</p>

  <p>"Did you meet any one last night on the mountain, at the inn?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia's face colored, but the moonlight hid the change.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said.</p>

  <p>"A man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Who was it?"</p>

  <p>"A Captain Chayne. He was at the hotel all last week. It was his friend
  who was killed on the Glacier des Nantillons."</p>

  <p>"Were you alone at the inn, you and he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did he know your father?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia stared at her mother.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I suppose not. How should he?"</p>

  <p>"It's not impossible," replied Mrs. Thesiger. Then she leaned on the
  table. "It was he who put these ideas into your head about going away, about
  leaving me." She made an accusation rather than put a question, and made it
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"No, mother," Sylvia replied. "He never spoke of you. The ideas have been
  growing in my mind for a long time, and to-day&mdash;" She raised her head,
  and turning slightly, looked up to where just behind her the ice-peaks of the
  Aiguilles du Midi and de Blaitière soared into the moonlit sky. "To-day the
  end came. I became certain that I must go away. I am very sorry, mother."</p>

  <p>"The message of the mountains!" said her mother with a sneer, and Sylvia
  answered quietly:</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Mrs. Thesiger. She had been deeply stung by her
  daughter's words, by her wish to go, and if she delayed her consent, it was
  chiefly through a hankering to punish Sylvia. But the thought came to her
  that she would punish Sylvia more completely if she let her go. She smiled
  cruelly as she looked at the girl's pure and gentle face. And, after all, she
  herself would be free &mdash; free from Sylvia's unconscious rivalry, free
  from the competition of her freshness and her youth, free from the grave
  criticism of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Very well, you shall go to your father. But remember! You have made your
  choice. You mustn't come whining back to me, because I won't have you," she
  said, brutally. "You shall go to-morrow."</p>

  <p>She took the letter from its envelope but she did not show it to her
  daughter.</p>

  <p>"I don't use your father's name," she said. "I have not used it since"
  &mdash; and again the cruel smile appeared upon her lips &mdash; "since he
  left me, as you say. He is called Garratt Skinner, and he lives in a little
  house in Hobart Place. Yes, you shall start for your home to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Sylvia stood up.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said. She looked wistfully at her mother, asking her
  pardon with the look. But she did not approach her. She stood sadly in front
  of her. Mrs. Thesiger made no advance.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked, in her hard, cold voice.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, mother," Sylvia repeated, and she walked slowly to the door of
  the hotel. She looked up to the mountains. Needle spires of rock, glistening
  pinnacles of ice, they stood dreaming to the moonlight and the stars. The
  great step had been taken. She prayed for something of their calm, something
  of their proud indifference to storm and sunshine, solitude and company. She
  went up to her room and began to pack her trunks. And as she packed, the
  tears gathered in her eyes and fell.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, her mother sat in the garden. So Sylvia wanted a home; she
  could not endure the life she lived with her mother. Afar off a band played;
  the streets beyond were noisy as a river; beneath the trees of the garden
  here people talked quietly. Mrs. Thesiger sat with a little vindictive smile
  upon her face. Her rival was going to be punished. Mrs. Thesiger had left her
  husband, not he her. She read through the letter which she had received from
  him this evening. It was a pressing request for money. She was not going to
  send him money. She wondered how he would appreciate the present of a
  daughter instead.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap9"
     id="chap9"><small>CHAPTER 9</small></a><br>
  <br>
  SYLVIA MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF HER FATHER</h2>

  <p class="first">Sylvia left Chamonix the next afternoon. It was a Saturday,
  and she stepped out of her railway-carriage on to the platform of Victoria
  Station at seven o'clock on the Sunday evening. She was tired by her long
  journey, and she felt rather lonely as she waited for her trunks to be passed
  by the officers of the custom-house. It was her very first visit to London,
  and there was not one person to meet her. Other travelers were being welcomed
  on all sides by their friends. No one in all London expected her. She doubted
  if she had one single acquaintance in the whole town. Her mother, foreseeing
  this very moment, had with a subtlety of malice refrained from so much as
  sending a telegram to the girl's father; and Sylvia herself, not knowing him,
  had kept silence too. Since he did not expect her, she thought her better
  plan was to see him, or rather, since her thoughts were frank, to let him see
  her. Her mirror had assured her that her looks would be a better introduction
  than a telegram.</p>

  <p>She had her boxes placed upon a cab and drove off to Hobart Place. The
  sense of loneliness soon left her. She was buoyed up by excitement. The
  novelty of the streets amused her. Moreover, she had invented her father,
  clothed him with many qualities as with shining raiment, and set him high
  among the persons of her dreams. Would he be satisfied with his daughter?
  That was her fear, and with the help of the looking-glass at the side of her
  hansom, she tried to remove the traces of travel from her young face.</p>

  <p>The cab stopped at a door in a narrow wall between two houses, and she got
  out. Over the wall she saw the green leaves and branches of a few lime trees
  which rose from a little garden, and at the end of the garden, in the far
  recess between the two side walls, the upper windows of a little neat white
  house. Sylvia was charmed with it. She rang the bell, and a servant came to
  the door.</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Skinner in?" asked Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, doubtfully, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sylvia, however, had made her plans.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said. She made a sign to the cabman, and walked on
  through the doorway into a little garden of grass with a few flowers on each
  side against the walls. A tiled path led through the middle of the grass to
  the glass door of the house. Sylvia walked straight down, followed by the
  cabman who brought her boxes in one after the other. The servant, giving way
  before the composure of this strange young visitor, opened the door of a
  sitting-room upon the left hand, and Sylvia, followed by her trunks, entered
  and took possession.</p>

  <p>"What name shall I say?" asked the servant in perplexity. She had had no
  orders to expect a visitor. Sylvia paid the cabman and waited until she heard
  the garden door close and the jingle of the cab as it was driven away. Then,
  and not till then, she answered the question.</p>

  <p>"No name. Just please tell Mr. Skinner that some one would like to see
  him."</p>

  <p>The servant stared, but went slowly away. Sylvia seated herself firmly
  upon one of the boxes. In spite of her composed manner, her heart was beating
  wildly. She heard a door open and the firm tread of a man along the passage.
  Sylvia clung to her box. After all she was in the house, she and her baggage.
  The door opened and a tall broad-shouldered man, who seemed to fill the whole
  tiny room, came in and stared at her. Then he saw her boxes, and he frowned
  in perplexity. As he appeared to Sylvia, he was a man of about forty-five,
  with a handsome, deeply-lined aquiline face. He had thick, dark brown hair, a
  mustache of a lighter brown and eyes of the color of hers &mdash; a man
  rather lean but of an athletic build. Sylvia watched him intently, but the
  only look upon his face was one of absolute astonishment. He saw a young
  lady, quite unknown to him, perched upon her luggage in a sitting-room of his
  house.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to see me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, getting on to her feet. She looked at him gravely. "I
  am Sylvia," she said.</p>

  <p>A smile, rather like her own smile, hesitated about his mouth.</p>

  <p>"And &mdash;</p>

  <p>"Who is Sylvia? What is she? Her trunks do not proclaim her!"</p>

  <p>he said. "Beyond that Sylvia has apparently come to stay, I am rather in
  the dark."</p>

  <p>"You are Mr. Garratt Skinner?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I am your daughter Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"My daughter Sylvia!" he exclaimed in a daze. Then he sat down and held
  his head between his hands.</p>

  <p>"Yes, by George. I <i>have</i> got a daughter Sylvia," he said, obviously
  recollecting the fact with surprise. "But you are at Chamonix."</p>

  <p>"I was at Chamonix yesterday."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner looked sharply at Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Did your mother send you to me?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered. "But she let me go. I came of my own accord. A letter
  came from you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you see it?" interrupted her father. "Did she show it you?"</p>

  <p>"No, but she gave me your address when I told her that I must come
  away."</p>

  <p>"Did she? I think I recognize my wife in that kindly act," he said, with a
  sudden bitterness. Then he looked curiously at his daughter.</p>

  <p>"Why did you want to come away?"</p>

  <p>"I was unhappy. For a long time I had been thinking over this. I hated it
  all &mdash; the people we met, the hotels we stayed at, the life altogether.
  Then at Chamonix I went up a mountain."</p>

  <p>"Oho," said her father, sitting up alertly. "So you went up a mountain?
  Which one?"</p>

  <p>"The Aiguille d'Argentière. Do you know it, father?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard of it," said Garratt Skinner.</p>

  <p>"Well, somehow that made a difference. It is difficult to explain. But I
  felt the difference. I felt something had happened to me which I had to
  recognize &mdash; a new thing. Climbing that mountain, staying for an hour
  upon its summit in the sunlight with all those great still pinnacles and
  ice-slopes about me &mdash; it was just like hearing very beautiful music."
  She was sitting now leaning forward with her hands clasped in front of her
  and speaking with great earnestness. "All the vague longings which had ever
  stirred within me, longings for something beyond, and beyond, came back upon
  me in a tumult. There was a place in shadow at my feet far below, the only
  place in shadow, a wall of black rock called the Col Dolent. It seemed to me
  that I was living in that cold shadow. I wanted to get up on the ridge, with
  the sunlight. So I came to you."</p>

  <p>It seemed to Sylvia, that intently as she spoke, her words were and must
  be elusive to another, unless that other had felt what she felt or were moved
  by sympathy to feel it. Her father listened without ridicule, without a
  smile. Indeed, once or twice he nodded his head to her words. Was it
  comprehension, she wondered, or was it only patience?</p>

  <p>"When I came down from that summit, I felt that what I had hated before
  was no longer endurable at all. So I came to you."</p>

  <p>Her father got up from his chair and stood for a little while looking out
  of the window. He was clearly troubled by her words. He turned away with a
  shrug of his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"But &mdash; but &mdash; what can I do for you here?" he cried. "Sylvia, I
  am a very poor man. Your mother, on the other hand, has some money."</p>

  <p>"Oh, father, I shan't cost you much," she replied, eagerly. "I might
  perhaps by looking after things save you money. I won't cost you much."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner looked at her with a rueful smile.</p>

  <p>"You look to me rather an expensive person to keep up," he said.</p>

  <p>"Mother dressed me like this. It's not my choice," she said. "I let her do
  as she wished. It did not seem to matter much. Really, if you will let me
  stay, you will find me useful," she said, in a pathetic appeal.</p>

  <p>"Useful?" said Garratt Skinner, suddenly. He again took stock of her, but
  now with a scrutiny which caused her a vague discomfort. He seemed to be
  appraising her from the color of her hair and eyes to the prettiness of her
  feet, almost as though she was for sale, and he a doubtful purchaser. She
  looked down on the carpet and slowly her blood colored her neck and rose into
  her face. "Useful," he said, slowly. "Perhaps so, yes, perhaps so." And upon
  that he changed his tone. "We will see, Sylvia. You must stay here for the
  present, at all events. Luckily, there is a spare room. I have some friends
  here staying to supper &mdash; just a bachelor's friends, you know, taking
  pot- luck without any ceremony, very good fellows, not polished, perhaps, but
  sound of heart, Sylvia my girl, sound of heart." All his perplexity had
  vanished; he had taken his part; and he rattled along with a friendly
  liveliness which cleared the shadows from Sylvia's thoughts and provoked upon
  her face her rare and winning smile. He rang the bell for the housemaid.</p>

  <p>"My daughter will stay here," he said, to the servant's astonishment. "Get
  the spare room ready at once. You will be hostess to-night, Sylvia, and sit
  at the head of the table. I become a family man. Well, well!"</p>

  <p>He took Sylvia up-stairs and showed her a little bright room with a big
  window which looked out across the garden. He carried her boxes up himself.
  "We don't run to a butler," he said. "Got everything you want? Ring if you
  haven't. We have supper at eight and we shan't dress. Only &mdash; well, you
  couldn't look dowdy if you tried."</p>

  <p>Sylvia had not the slightest intention to try. She put on a little frock
  of white lace, high at the throat, dressed her hair, and then having a little
  time to spare she hurriedly wrote a letter. This letter she gave to the
  servant and she ran down-stairs.</p>

  <p>"You will be careful to have it posted, please!" she said, and at that
  moment her father came out into the passage, so quickly that he might have
  been listening for her approach.</p>

  <p>She stopped upon the staircase, a few steps above him. The evening was
  still bright, and the daylight fell upon her from a window above the hall
  door.</p>

  <p>"Shall I do?" she asked, with a smile.</p>

  <p>The staircase was paneled with a dark polished wood, and she stood out
  from that somber background, a white figure, delicate and dainty and
  wholesome, from the silver buckle on her satin slipper to the white flower
  she had placed in her hair. Her face, with its remarkable gentleness, its
  suggestion of purity as of one unspotted by the world, was turned to him with
  a confident appeal. Her clear gray eyes rested quietly on his. Yet she saw
  his face change. It seemed that a spasm of pain or revolt shook him. Upon her
  face there came a blank look. Why was he displeased? But the spasm passed. He
  shrugged his shoulders and threw off his doubt.</p>

  <p>"You are very pretty," he said.</p>

  <p>Sylvia's smile just showed about the corners of her lips and her face
  cleared.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner laughed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you know that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, nodding her head at him.</p>

  <p>He led the way down the passage toward the back of the house, and throwing
  open a door introduced her to his friends.</p>

  <p>"Captain Barstow," he said, and Sylvia found herself shaking hands with a
  little middle-aged man with a shiny bald head and a black square beard. He
  had an eye-glass screwed into his right eye, and that whole side of his face
  was distorted by the contraction of the muscles and drawn upward toward the
  eye. He did not look at her directly, but with an oblique and furtive glance
  he expressed his sense of the honor which the introduction conferred on him.
  However, Sylvia was determined not to be disappointed. She turned to the next
  of her father's guests.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Archie Parminter."</p>

  <p>He at all events looked her straight in the face. He was a man of moderate
  height, youthful in build, but old of face, upon which there sat always a
  smirk of satisfaction. He was of those whom no beauty in others, no grace, no
  sweetness, could greatly impress, so filled was he with self- complacency. He
  had no time to admire, since always he felt that he was being admired, and to
  adjust his pose, and to speak so that his words, carried to the right
  distance, occupied too much of his attention. He seldom spoke to the person
  he talked with but generally to some other, a woman for choice, whom he
  believed to be listening to the important sentences he uttered. For the rest,
  he had grown heavy in jaw and his face (a rather flat face in which were set
  a pair of sharp dark eyes) narrowed in toward the top of his head like a
  pear.</p>

  <p>He bowed suavely to Sylvia, with the air of one showing to the room how a
  gentleman performed that ceremony, but took little note of her.</p>

  <p>But Sylvia was determined not to be disappointed.</p>

  <p>Her father took her by the elbow and turned her about.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hine."</p>

  <p>Sylvia was confronted with a youth who reddened under her greeting and
  awkwardly held out a damp coarse hand, a poor creature with an insipid face,
  coarse hair, and manner of great discomfort. He was as tall as Parminter, but
  wore his good clothes with Sunday air, and having been introduced to Sylvia
  could find no word to say to her.</p>

  <p>"Well, let us go in to supper," said her father, and he held open the door
  for her to pass.</p>

  <p>Sylvia went into the dining-room across the narrow hall, where a cold
  supper was laid upon a round table. In spite of her resolve to see all things
  in a rosy light, she grew conscious, in spite of herself, that she was
  disappointed in her father's friends. She was perplexed, too. He was so
  clearly head and shoulders above his associates, that she wondered at their
  presence in his house. Yet he seemed quite content, and in a most genial
  mood.</p>

  <p>"You sit here, Sylvia, my dear," he said, pointing to a chair. "Wallie"
  &mdash; this to the youth Hine &mdash; "sit beside my daughter and keep her
  amused. Barstow, you on the other side; Parminter next to me."</p>

  <p>He sat opposite Sylvia and the rest took their places, Hine sidling
  timidly into his chair and tortured by the thought that he had to amuse this
  delicate being at his side.</p>

  <p>"The supper is on the table," said Garratt Skinner. "Parminter, will you
  cut up this duck? Hine, what have you got in front of you? Really, this is so
  exceptional an occasion that I think&mdash;" he started up suddenly, as a man
  will with a new and happy idea &mdash; "I certainly think that for once in a
  way we might open a bottle of champagne."</p>

  <p>Surprise and applause greeted this brilliant idea, and Hine cried out:</p>

  <p>"I think champagne fine, don't you, Miss Skinner?"</p>

  <p>He collapsed at his own boldness. Parminter shrugged his shoulders to show
  that champagne was an every-day affair with him.</p>

  <p>"It's drunk a good deal at the clubs nowadays," he said.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Garratt Skinner had not moved. He stood looking across the table
  to his daughter.</p>

  <p>"What do you say, Sylvia? It's an extravagance. But I don't have such luck
  every day. It's in your honor. Shall we? Yes, then!"</p>

  <p>He did not wait for an answer, but opened the door of a cupboard in the
  sideboard, and there, quite ready, stood half a dozen bottles of champagne. A
  doubt flashed into Sylvia's mind &mdash; a doubt whether her father's
  brilliant idea was really the inspiration which his manner had suggested.
  Those bottles looked so obviously got in for the occasion. But Garratt
  Skinner turned to her apologetically, as though he divined her thought.</p>

  <p>"We don't run to a wine cellar, Sylvia. We have to keep what little stock
  we can afford in here."</p>

  <p>Her doubt vanished, but in an instant it returned again, for as her father
  came round the table with the bottle in his hand, she noticed that shallow
  champagne glasses were ready laid at every place. Garratt Skinner filled the
  glasses and returned to his place.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia," he said, and, smiling, he drank to her. He turned to his
  companions. "Congratulate me!" Then he sat down.</p>

  <p>The champagne thawed the tongues of the company, and as they spoke
  Sylvia's heart sank more and more. For in word and thought and manner her
  father's guests were familiar to her. She refused to acknowledge it, but the
  knowledge was forced upon her. She had thought to step out of a world which
  she hated, against which her delicacy and her purity revolted, and lo! she
  had stepped out merely to take a stride and step down into it again at
  another place.</p>

  <p>The obsequious attentiveness of Captain Barstow, the vanity of Mr.
  Parminter and his affected voice, suggesting that he came out of the great
  world to this little supper party, really without any sense of condescension
  at all, and the behavior of Walter Hine, who, to give himself courage, gulped
  down his champagne &mdash; it was all horribly familiar. Her one consolation
  was her father. He sat opposite to her, his strong aquiline face a fine
  contrast to the faces of the others; he had an ease of manner which they did
  not possess; he talked with a quietude of his own, and he had a watchful eye
  and a ready smile for his daughter. Indeed, it seemed that what she felt his
  guests felt too. For they spoke to him with a certain deference, almost as if
  they spoke to their master. He alone apparently noticed no unsuitability in
  his guests. He sat at his ease, their bosom friend.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, plied with champagne by Archie Parminter, who sat upon the
  other side of him, "Wallie" Hine began to boast. Sylvia tried to check him,
  but he was not now to be stopped. His very timidity pricked him on to
  extravagance, and his boasting was that worst form of boasting &mdash; the
  vaunt of the innocent weakling anxious to figure as a conqueror of women.
  With a flushed face he dropped his foolish hints of Mrs. This and Lady That,
  with an eye upon Sylvia to watch the impression which he made, and a wise air
  which said "If only I were to tell you all."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner opened a fresh bottle of champagne &mdash; the supply by
  now was getting low &mdash; and came round the table with it. As he held the
  neck of the bottle to the brim of Hine's glass he caught an appealing look
  from his daughter. At once he lifted the bottle and left the glass unfilled.
  As he passed Sylvia, she said in a low voice:</p>

  <p>"Thank you," and he whispered back:</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, my dear. Interest him so that he doesn't notice that
  I have left his glass empty."</p>

  <p>Sylvia set herself then to talk to Wallie Hine. But he was intent on
  making her understand what great successes had been his. He <i>would</i>
  talk, and it troubled her that all listened, and listened with an air of
  admiration. Even her father from his side of the table smiled indulgently.
  Yet the stories, or rather the hints of stories, were certainly untrue. For
  this her wanderings had taught her &mdash; the man of many successes never
  talks. It seemed that there was a conspiracy to flatter the wretched
  youth.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. You have been a devil of a fellow among the women, Wallie,"
  said Captain Barstow. But at once Garratt Skinner interfered and sharply:</p>

  <p>"Come, come, Barstow! That's no language to use before my daughter."</p>

  <p>Captain Barstow presented at the moment a remarkable gradation of color.
  On the top was the bald head, very shiny and white, below that a face now
  everywhere a deep red except where the swollen veins stood out upon the
  surface of his cheeks, and those were purple, and this in its turn was
  enclosed by the black square beard. He bowed at once to Garratt Skinner's
  rebuke.</p>

  <p>"I apologize. I do indeed, Miss Sylvia! But when I was in the service we
  still clung to the traditions of Wellington by &mdash; by George. And it's
  hard to break oneself of the habit. 'Red-hot,'" he said, with a chuckle.
  "That's what they called me in the regiment. Red-hot Barstow. I'll bet that
  Red-hot Barstow is still pretty well remembered among the boys at
  Cheltenham."</p>

  <p>"Swearing's bad form nowadays," said Archie Parminter, superciliously.
  "They have given it up at the clubs."</p>

  <p>Sylvia seized the moment and rose from the table. Her father sprang
  forward and opened the door.</p>

  <p>"We will join you in a few minutes," he said.</p>

  <p>Sylvia went down the passage to the room at the back of the house in which
  she had been presented by her father to his friends. She rang the bell at
  once and when the servant came she said:</p>

  <p>"I gave you a letter to post this evening. I should like to have it
  back."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, miss, but it's posted."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, too," said Sylvia, quietly.</p>

  <p>The letter had been written to Chayne, and gave him the address of this
  house as the place where he might find her if he called. She had no thought
  of going away. She had made her choice for good or ill and must abide by it.
  That she knew. But she was no longer sure that she wished Captain Chayne to
  come and find her there.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10"><small>CHAPTER 10</small></a><br>
  <br>
  A LITTLE ROUND GAME OF CARDS</h2>

  <p class="first">Sylvia sat down in a chair and waited. She waited
  impatiently, for she knew that she had almost reached the limits of her
  self-command, and needed the presence of others to keep her from breaking
  down. But her native courage came to her aid, and in half an hour she heard
  the steps of her father and his guests in the passage. She noticed that her
  father looked anxiously toward her as he came in.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if we bring in our cigars?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said she; and he came in, carrying in his hand a box of
  cigars, which he placed in the middle of the table. Wallie Hine at once
  stumbled across the room to Sylvia; he walked unsteadily, his features were
  more flushed than before. She shrank a little from him. But he had not the
  time to sit down beside her, for Captain Barstow exclaimed jovially:</p>

  <p>"I say, Garratt, I have an idea. There are five of us here. Let us have a
  little round game of cards."</p>

  <p>Sylvia started. In her heart she knew that just some such proposal as this
  she had been dreading all the evening. Her sinking hopes died away
  altogether.</p>

  <p>This poor witless youth, plied with champagne; the older men who flattered
  him with lies; the suggestion of champagne made as though it were a sudden
  inspiration, and the six bottles standing ready in the cupboard; and now the
  suggestion of a little round game of cards made in just the same tone! Sylvia
  had a feeling of horror. She had kept herself unspotted from her world, but
  not through ignorance. She knew it. She knew those little round games of
  cards and what came of them, sometimes merely misery and ruin, sometimes a
  pistol shot in the early morning. She turned very pale, but she managed to
  say:</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I don't play cards."</p>

  <p>And then she heard a sudden movement by her father, who at the moment when
  Barstow spoke had been lighting a fresh cigar. She looked up. Garratt Skinner
  was staring in astonishment at Captain Barstow.</p>

  <p>"Cards!" he cried. "In my house? On a Sunday evening?"</p>

  <p>With each question his amazement grew, and he ended in a tone of
  remonstrance.</p>

  <p>"Come, Barstow, you know me too well to propose that. I am rather hurt. A
  friendly talk, and a smoke, yes. Perhaps a small whisky and soda. I don't say
  no. But cards on a Sunday evening! No indeed."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I say, Skinner," objected Wallie Hine. "There's no harm in a little
  game."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner shook his head at Hine in a grave friendly way.</p>

  <p>"Better leave cards alone, Wallie, always. You are young, you know."</p>

  <p>Hine flushed.</p>

  <p>"I am old enough to hold my own against any man," he cried, hotly. He felt
  that Garratt Skinner had humiliated him, and before this wonderful daughter
  of his in whose good favors Mr. Hine had been making such inroads during
  supper. Barstow apologized for his suggestion at once, but Hine was now quite
  unwilling that he should withdraw it.</p>

  <p>"There's no harm in it," he cried. "I really think you are too
  Puritanical, isn't he, Miss &mdash; Miss Sylvia?"</p>

  <p>Hine had been endeavoring to pluck up courage to use her Christian name
  all the evening. His pride that he had actually spoken it was so great that
  he did not remark at all her little movement of disgust.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner seemed to weaken in his resolution.</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, Wallie," he said, "I want you to enjoy yourselves. And
  if you especially want it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Did he notice that Sylvia closed her eyes and really shivered? She could
  not tell. But he suddenly spoke in a tone of revolt:</p>

  <p>"But card-playing on Sunday. Really no!"</p>

  <p>"It's done nowadays at the West-End Clubs," said Archie Parminter.</p>

  <p>"Oh, is it?" said Garratt Skinner, again grown doubtful. "Is it, indeed?
  Well, if they do it in the Clubs&mdash;" And then with an exclamation of
  relief &mdash; "I haven't got a pack of cards in the house. That settles the
  point."</p>

  <p>"There's a public house almost next door," replied Barstow. "If you send
  out your servant, I am sure she could borrow one."</p>

  <p>"No," said Garratt Skinner, indignantly. "Really, Barstow, your bachelor
  habits have had a bad effect on you. I would not think of sending a girl out
  to a public house on any consideration. It might be the very first step
  downhill for her, and I should be responsible."</p>

  <p>"Oh well, if you are so particular, I'll go myself," cried Barstow,
  petulantly. He got up and walked to the door.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind so much if you go yourself. Only please don't say you come
  from this house," said Garratt Skinner, and Barstow went out from the room.
  He came back in a very short time, and Sylvia noticed at once that he held
  two quite new and unopened packs of cards in his hand.</p>

  <p>"A stroke of luck," he cried. "The landlord had a couple of new packs, for
  he was expecting to give a little party to-night. But a relation of his wife
  died rather suddenly yesterday, and he put his guests off. A decent-minded
  fellow, I think. What?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It's not every one who would have shown so much good feeling," said
  Garratt Skinner, seriously. "One likes to know that there are men about like
  that. One feels kindlier to the whole world"; and he drew up his chair to the
  table.</p>

  <p>Sylvia was puzzled. Was this story of the landlord a glib lie of Captain
  Barstow's to account, with a detail which should carry conviction, for the
  suspiciously new pack of cards? And if so, did her father believe in its
  truth? Had the packs been waiting in Captain Barstow's coat pocket in the
  hall until the fitting moment for their appearance? If so, did her father
  play a part in the conspiracy? His face gave no sign. She was terribly
  troubled.</p>

  <p>"Penny points," said Garratt Skinner. "Nothing more."</p>

  <p>"Oh come, I say," cried Hine, as he pulled out a handful of
  sovereigns.</p>

  <p>"Nothing more than penny points in my house. Put that money away, Wallie.
  We will use counters."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner had a box of counters if he had no pack of cards.</p>

  <p>"Penny points, a sixpenny ante and a shilling limit," he said. "Then no
  harm will be done to any one. The black counters a shilling, the red
  sixpence, and the white ones a penny. You have each a pound's worth," he said
  as he dealt them out.</p>

  <p>Sylvia rose from her chair.</p>

  <p>"I think I will go to bed."</p>

  <p>Wallie Hine turned round in his chair, holding his counters in his hand.
  "Oh, don't do that, Miss Sylvia. Sit beside me, please, and bring me
  luck."</p>

  <p>"You forget, Wallie, that my daughter has just come from a long journey.
  No doubt she is tired," said Garratt Skinner, with a friendly reproach in his
  voice. He got up and opened the door for his daughter. After she had passed
  out he followed her.</p>

  <p>"I shall take a hand for a little while, Sylvia, to see that they keep to
  the stakes. I think young Hine wants looking after, don't you? He doesn't
  know any geography. Good-night, my dear. Sleep well!"</p>

  <p>He took her by the elbow and drew her toward him. He stooped to her,
  meaning to kiss her. Sylvia did not resist, but she drooped her head so that
  her forehead, not her lips, was presented to his embrace. And the kiss was
  never given. She remained standing, her face lowered from his, her attitude
  one of resignation and despondency. She felt her father's hand shake upon her
  arm, and looking up saw his eyes fixed upon her in pity. He dropped her arm
  quickly, and said in a sharp voice:</p>

  <p>"There! Go to bed, child!"</p>

  <p>He watched her as she went up the stairs. She went up slowly and without
  turning round, and she walked like one utterly tired out. Garratt Skinner
  waited until he heard her door close. "She should never have come," he said.
  "She should never have come." Then he went slowly back to his friends.</p>

  <p>Sylvia went to bed, but she did not sleep. The excitement which had buoyed
  her up had passed; and her hopes had passed with it. She recalled the high
  anticipations with which she had set out from Chamonix only yesterday &mdash;
  yes, only yesterday. And against them in a vivid contrast she set the actual
  reality, the supper party, Red-hot Barstow, Archie Parminter, and the poor
  witless Wallie Hine, with his twang and his silly boasts. She began to wonder
  whether there was any other world than that which she knew, any other people
  than those with whom she had lived. Her father was different &mdash; yes, but
  &mdash; but &mdash; Her father was too perplexing a problem to her at this
  moment. Why had he so clearly pitied her just now in the passage? Why had he
  checked himself from the kiss? She was too tired to reason it out. She was
  conscious that she was very wretched, and the tears gathered in her eyes; and
  in the darkness of her room she cried silently, pressing the sheet to her
  lips lest a sob should be heard. Were all her dreams mere empty imaginings?
  she asked. If so, why should they ever have come to her? she inquired
  piteously; why should she have found solace in them &mdash; why should they
  have become her real life? Did no one walk the earth of all that company
  which went with her in her fancies?</p>

  <p>Upon that her thoughts flew to the Alps, to the evening in the Pavillon de
  Lognan, the climb upon the rocks and the glittering ice-slope, the perfect
  hour upon the sunlit top of the Aiguille d'Argentière. The memory of the
  mountains brought her consolation in her bad hour, as her friend had
  prophesied it would. Her tears ceased to flow, she lived that day &mdash; her
  one day &mdash; over again, jealous of every minute. After all that had been
  real, and more perfect than any dream. Moreover, there had been with her
  through the day a man honest and loyal as any of her imagined company. She
  began to take heart a little; she thought of the Col Dolent with its broad
  ribbon of ice set in the sheer black rocks, and always in shadow. She thought
  of herself as going up some such hard, cold road in the shadow, and
  remembered that on the top of the Col one came out into sunlight and looked
  southward into Italy. So comforted a little, she fell asleep.</p>

  <p>It was some hours before she woke. It was already day, and since she had
  raised her blinds before she had got into bed, the light streamed into the
  room. She thought for a moment that it was the light which had waked her. But
  as she lay she heard a murmur of voices, very low, and a sound of people
  moving stealthily. She looked out of the window. The streets were quite empty
  and silent. In the houses on the opposite side the blinds were drawn; a gray
  clear light was spread over the town; the sun had not yet risen. She looked
  at her watch. It was five o'clock. She listened again, gently opening her
  door for an inch or so. She heard the low voices more clearly now. Those who
  spoke were speaking almost in whispers. She thought that thieves had broken
  in. She hurried on a few clothes, cautiously opened her door wider, slipped
  through, and crept with a beating heart down the stairs.</p>

    <img src="1300121h-images/RunningWater3.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Half way down the stairs she looked over the rail of the banister, turning
  her head toward the back part of the house whence the murmurs came. At the
  end of the passage was the little room in which the round game of cards was
  played the night before. The door stood open now, and she looked right into
  the room.</p>

  <p>And this is what she saw:</p>

  <p>Wallie Hine was sitting at the table. About him the carpet was strewn with
  crumpled pieces of paper. There was quite a number of them littered around
  his chair. He was writing, or rather, trying to write. For Archie Parminter
  leaning over the back of the chair held his hand and guided it. Captain
  Barstow stood looking intently on, but of her father there was no sign. She
  could not see the whole room, however. A good section of it was concealed
  from her. Wallie Hine was leaning forward on the table, with his head so low
  and his arms so spread that she could not see in what book he was writing.
  But apparently he did not write to the satisfaction of his companions. In
  spite of Parminter's care his pen spluttered. Sylvia saw Archie look at
  Barstow, and she heard Barstow answer "No, that won't do." Archie Parminter
  dropped Hine's hand, tore a slip of paper out of the book, crumpled it, and
  threw it down with a gesture of anger on to the carpet.</p>

  <p>"Try again, old fellow," said Barstow, eagerly, bending down toward Hine
  with a horrid smile upon his face, a smile which tried to conceal an intense
  exasperation, an intense desire to strike. Again Parminter leaned over the
  chair, again he took Wallie Hine's hand and guided the pen, very carefully
  lifting it from the paper at the end of an initial or a word, and spacing the
  letters. This time he seemed content.</p>

  <p>"That will do, I think," he said, in a whisper.</p>

  <p>Captain Barstow bent down and examined the writing carefully with his
  short-sighted eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's all right."</p>

  <p>Parminter tore the leaf out, but this time he did not crumple it. He
  blotted it carefully, folded it, and laid it on the mantle-shelf.</p>

  <p>"Let us get him up," he said, and with Barstow's help they lifted Hine out
  of his chair. Sylvia caught a glimpse of his face. His mouth was loose, his
  eyes half shut, and the lids red; he seemed to be in a stupor. His head
  rolled upon his shoulders. He swayed as his companions held him up; his knees
  gave under him. He began incoherently to talk.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Parminter. "You'll wake the house. You don't want that pretty
  girl to see you in this state, do you, Wallie? After the impression you made
  on her, too! Get his hat and coat out of the passage, Barstow."</p>

  <p>He propped Hine against the table, and holding him upright turned to the
  door. He saw "the pretty girl" leaning over the banister and gazing with
  horror- stricken eyes into the room. Sylvia drew back on the instant. With a
  gesture of his hand, Archie Parminter stopped Barstow on his way to the
  door.</p>

  <p>Sylvia leaned back against the wall of the staircase, holding her breath,
  and tightly pressing a hand upon her heart. Had they seen her? Would they
  come out into the passage? What would happen? Would they kill her? The
  questions raced through her mind. She could not have moved, she thought, had
  Death stood over her. But nothing happened. She could not now see into the
  room, and she heard no whisper, no footsteps creeping stealthily along the
  passage toward her, no sound at all. Presently she recovered her breath, and
  crept up-stairs. Once in her room, with great care she locked the door, and
  sank upon her bed, shaking and trembling. There she lay until the noise of
  the hall door closing very gently roused her. She crept along the wall till
  she was by the side of the window. Then she raised herself against the wall
  and peered out. She saw Barstow and Parminter supporting Hine along the
  street, each with an arm through his. A hansom-cab drove up, they lifted Hine
  into it, got in themselves, and drove off. As the cab turned, Archie
  Parminter glanced up to the windows of the house. But Sylvia was behind the
  curtains at the side. He could not have seen her. Sylvia leaned her head
  against the panels of the door and concentrated all her powers so that not a
  movement in the house might escape her ears. She listened for the sound of
  some one else moving in the room below, some one who had been left behind.
  She listened for a creak of the stairs, the brushing of a coat against the
  stair rail, the sound of some one going stealthily to his room. She stood at
  the door, with her face strangely set for a long while. Her mind was quite
  made up. If she heard her father moving from that room, she would just wait
  until he was asleep, and then she would go &mdash; anywhere. She could not go
  back to her mother, that she knew. She had no one to go to; nevertheless, she
  would go.</p>

  <p>But no sound reached her. Her father was not in the room below. He must
  have gone to bed and left the others to themselves. The pigeon had been
  plucked that night, not a doubt of it, but her father had had no hand in the
  plucking. She laid herself down upon her bed, exhausted, and again sleep came
  to her. And in a moment the sound of running water was in her ears.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11"><small>CHAPTER 11</small></a><br>
  <br>
  SYLVIA'S FATHER MAKES A MISTAKE</h2>

  <p class="first">Sylvia did not wake again until the maid brought in her tea
  and told her that it was eight o'clock. When she went down-stairs, her father
  was already in the dining-room. She scanned him closely, but his face bore no
  sign whatever of a late and tempestuous night; and a great relief enheartened
  her. He met her with an open smile.</p>

  <p>"Did you sleep well, Sylvia?"</p>

  <p>"Not very well, father," she answered, as she watched his face. "I woke up
  in the early morning."</p>

  <p>But nothing could have been more easy or natural than his comment on her
  words.</p>

  <p>"Yet you look like a good sleeper. A strange house, I suppose,
  Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"Voices in the strange house," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Voices?"</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"Did those fellows stay so late?" he asked with annoyance. "What time was
  it when they woke you up, Sylvia?"</p>

  <p>"A little before five."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner's annoyance increased.</p>

  <p>"That's too bad," he cried. "I left them and went to bed. But they
  promised me faithfully only to stay another half-hour. I am very sorry,
  Sylvia." And as she poured out the tea, he continued: "I will speak pretty
  sharply to Barstow. It's altogether too bad."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner breakfasted with an eye on the clock, and as soon as the
  hands pointed to five minutes to nine, he rose from the table.</p>

  <p>"I must be off &mdash; business, my dear." He came round the table to her
  and gently laid a hand upon her shoulder. "It makes a great difference,
  Sylvia, to have a daughter, fresh and young and pretty, sitting opposite to
  me at the breakfast table &mdash; a very great difference. I shall cut work
  early to-day on account of it; I'll come home and fetch you, and we'll go out
  and lunch somewhere together."</p>

  <p>He spoke with every sign of genuine feeling; and Sylvia, looking up into
  his face, was moved by what he said. He smiled down at her, with her own
  winning smile; he looked her in the face with her own frankness, her own good
  humor.</p>

  <p>"I have been a lonely man for a good many years, Sylvia," he said, "too
  lonely. I am glad the years have come to an end"; and this time he did what
  yesterday night he had checked himself from doing. He stooped down and kissed
  her on the forehead. Then he went from the room, took his hat, and letting
  himself out of the house closed the door behind him. He called a passing cab,
  and, as he entered it, he said to the driver:</p>

  <p>"Go to the London and County Bank in Victoria Street," and gaily waving
  his hand to his daughter, who stood behind the window, he drove off.</p>

  <p>At one o'clock he returned in the same high spirits. Sylvia had spent the
  morning in removing the superfluous cherries and roses from her best hat and
  making her frock at once more simple and more suitable to her years. Garratt
  Skinner surveyed her with pride.</p>

  <p>"Come on," he said. "I have kept the cab waiting."</p>

  <p>For a poor man he seemed to Sylvia rather reckless. They drove to the
  Savoy Hotel and lunched together in the open air underneath the glass roof,
  with a bank of flowers upon one side of them and the windows of the
  grill-room on the other. The day was very hot, the streets baked in an arid
  glare of sunlight; a dry dust from the wood pavement powdered those who
  passed by in the Strand. Here, however, in this cool and shaded place the
  pair lunched happily together. Garratt Skinner had the tact not to ask any
  questions of his daughter about her mother, or how they had fared together.
  He talked easily of unimportant things, and pointed out from time to time
  some person of note or some fashionable actress who happened to pass in or
  out of the hotel. He could be good company when he chose, and he chose on
  this morning. It was not until coffee was set before them, and he had lighted
  a cigar, that he touched upon themselves, and then not with any paternal
  tone, but rather as one comrade conferring with another. There, indeed, was
  his great advantage with Sylvia. Her mother had either disregarded her or
  treated her as a child. She could not but be won by a father who laid bare
  his plans to her and asked for her criticism as well as her assent. Her
  suspicions of yesterday died away, or, at all events, slept so soundly that
  they could not have troubled her less had they been dead.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia," he said, "I think London in August, and in such an August, is
  too hot. I don't want to see you grow pale, and for myself I haven't had a
  holiday for a long time. You see there is not much temptation for a lonely
  man to go away by himself."</p>

  <p>For the second time that day he appealed to her on the ground of his
  loneliness; and not in vain. She began even to feel remorseful that she had
  left him to his loneliness so long. There rose up within her an almost
  maternal feeling of pity for her father. She did not stop to think that he
  had never sent for her; had never indeed shown a particle of interest in her
  until they had met face to face.</p>

  <p>"But since you are here," he continued, "well &mdash; I have been doing
  fairly well in my business lately, and I thought we might take a little
  holiday together, at some quiet village by the sea. You know nothing of
  England. I have been thinking it all out this morning. There is no country
  more beautiful or more typical than Dorsetshire. Besides, you were born
  there. What do you say to three weeks or so in Dorsetshire? We will stay at
  an hotel in Weymouth for a few days and look about for a house."</p>

  <p>"Father!" exclaimed Sylvia, leaning forward with shining eyes. "It will be
  splendid. Just you and I!"</p>

  <p>"Well, not quite," he answered, slowly; and as he saw his daughter sink
  back with a pucker of disappointment on her forehead, he knocked the ash off
  his cigar and in his turn leaned forward over the table.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia, I want to talk to you seriously," he said, and glanced around to
  make sure that no one overheard him. "I should very much like one person to
  come and stay with us."</p>

  <p>Sylvia made no answer. Her face was grave and very still, her eyes dwelt
  quietly upon him and betrayed nothing of what she thought.</p>

  <p>"You have guessed who the one person is?"</p>

  <p>Again Sylvia did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is Wallie Hine," he continued.</p>

  <p>Her suspicions were stirring again from their sleep. She waited in fear
  upon his words. She looked out, through the opening at the mouth of the court
  into the glare of the Strand. The bright prospect which her vivid fancies had
  pictured there a minute since, transforming the dusky street into fields of
  corn and purple heather, the omnibuses into wagons drawn by teams of great
  horses musical with bells, had all grown dark. A real horror was gripping
  her. But she turned her eyes quietly back upon her father's face and
  waited.</p>

  <p>"His presence will spoil our holiday a little," Garratt Skinner continued
  with an easy assurance. "You saw, no doubt, what Wallie Hine is, last night
  &mdash; a weak, foolish youth, barely half-educated, awkward, with graces of
  neither mind nor body, and in the hands of two scoundrels."</p>

  <p>Sylvia started, and she leaned forward with a look of bewilderment plain
  to see in her dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's the truth, Sylvia. He has come into a little money, and he is
  in the hands of two scoundrels who are leading him by the nose. My poor
  girl," he cried, suddenly breaking off, "you must have found yourself in very
  strange and disappointing company last night. I was very sorry for you, and
  sorry for myself, too. All the evening I was saying to myself, 'I wonder what
  my little girl is thinking of me.' But I couldn't help it. I had not the time
  to explain. I had to sit quiet, knowing that you must be unhappy, certain
  that you must be despising me for the company I kept."</p>

  <p>Sylvia blushed guiltily.</p>

  <p>"Despising you? No, father," she said, in a voice of apology. "I saw how
  much above the rest you were."</p>

  <p>"Blaming me, then," interrupted Garratt Skinner, with an easy smile. He
  was not at all offended. "Let us say blaming me. And it was quite natural
  that you should, judging by the surface. And there was nothing but the
  surface for you to judge by."</p>

  <p>While in this way defending Sylvia against her own self-reproach, he only
  succeeded in making her feel still more that she had judged hastily where she
  should have held all judgment in abeyance, that she had lacked faith where by
  right she should have shown most faith. But he wished to spare her from
  confusion.</p>

  <p>"I was so proud of you that I could not but suffer all the more. However,
  don't let us talk of it, my dear"; and waving with a gesture of the hand that
  little misunderstanding away forever, he resumed:</p>

  <p>"Well, I am rather fond of Wallie Hine. I don't know why, perhaps because
  he is so helpless, because he so much stands in need of a steady mentor at
  his elbow. There is, after all, no accounting for one's likings. Logic and
  reason have little to do with them. As a woman you know that. And being
  rather fond of Wallie Hine, I have tried to do my best for him. It would not
  have been of any use to shut my door on Barstow and Archie Parminter. They
  have much too firm a hold on the poor youth. I should have been shutting it
  on Wallie Hine, too. No, the only plan was to welcome them all, to play
  Parminter's game of showing the youth about town, and Barstow's game of crude
  flattery, and gradually, if possible, to dissociate him from his companions,
  before they had fleeced him altogether. So you were let in, my dear, for that
  unfortunate evening. Of course I was quite sure that you would not attribute
  to me designs upon Wallie Hine, otherwise I should have turned them all out
  at once."</p>

  <p>He spoke with a laugh, putting aside, as it were, a quite incredible
  suggestion. But he looked at her sharply as he laughed. Sylvia's face grew
  crimson, her eyes for once wavered from his face, and she lowered her head.
  Garratt Skinner, however, seemed not to notice her confusion.</p>

  <p>"You remember," he continued, "that I tried to stop them playing cards at
  the beginning. I yielded in the end, because it became perfectly clear that
  if I didn't they would go away and play elsewhere, while I at all events
  could keep the points down in my own house. I ought to have stayed up, I
  suppose, until they went away. I blame myself there a little. But I had no
  idea they would stay so late. Are you sure it was their voices you heard and
  not the servants moving?"</p>

  <p>He asked the question almost carelessly, but his eyes rather belied his
  tone, for they watched her intently.</p>

  <p>"Quite sure," she answered.</p>

  <p>"You might have made a mistake."</p>

  <p>"No; for I saw them."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner covered his mouth with his hand. It seemed to Sylvia that
  he smiled. A suspicion flashed across her mind, in spite of herself. Was he
  merely testing her to see whether she would speak the truth or not? Did he
  know that she had come down the stairs in the early morning? She thrust the
  suspicion aside, remembering the self-reproach which suspicion had already
  caused her at this very luncheon table. If it were true that her father knew,
  why then Barstow or Parminter must have told him this very morning. And if he
  had seen either of them this morning, all his talk to her in this cool and
  quiet place was a carefully prepared hypocrisy. No, she would not believe
  that.</p>

  <p>"You saw them?" he exclaimed. "Tell me how."</p>

  <p>She told him the whole story, how she had come down the staircase, what
  she had seen, as she leaned over the balustrade, and how Parminter had
  turned.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he saw you?" asked her father.</p>

  <p>Sylvia looked at him closely. But he seemed really anxious to know.</p>

  <p>"I think he saw something," she answered. "Whether he knew that it was I
  whom he saw, I can't tell."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner sat for a little while smoking his cigar in short, angry
  puffs.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have had that happen for worlds," he said, with a frown. "I
  have no doubt whatever that the slips of paper on which poor Hine was trying
  to write were I.O.U's. Heaven knows what he lost last night."</p>

  <p>"I know," returned Sylvia. "He lost £480 last night."</p>

  <p>"Impossible," cried Garratt Skinner, with so much violence that the people
  lunching at the tables near-by looked up at the couple with surprise. "Oh,
  no! I'll not believe it, Sylvia." And as he lowered his voice, he seemed to
  be making an appeal to her to go back upon her words, so distressed was he at
  the thought that Wallie Hine should be jockeyed out of so much money at his
  house.</p>

  <p>"Four hundred and eighty pounds," Sylvia repeated.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner caught at a comforting thought.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's only in I.O.U's. That's one thing. I can stop the redemption
  of them. You see, he has been robbed &mdash; that's the plain English of it
  &mdash; robbed."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hine was not writing an I.O.U. He was writing a check, and Mr.
  Parminter was guiding his hand as he wrote the signature."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner fell back in his chair. He looked about him with a dazed
  air, as though he expected the world falling to pieces around him.</p>

  <p>"Why, that's next door to forgery!" he whispered, in a voice of horror.
  "Guiding the hand of a man too drunk to write! I knew Archie Parminter was
  pretty bad, but I never thought that he would sink to that. I am not sure
  that he could not be laid by the heels for forgery." And then he recovered a
  little from the shock. "But you can't be sure, Sylvia! This is guesswork of
  yours &mdash; yes, guesswork."</p>

  <p>"It's not," she answered. "I told you that the floor was littered with
  slips of the paper on which Mr. Hine had been trying to write."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>There came an indefinable change in Garratt Skinner's face. He leaned
  forward with his mouth sternly set and his eyes very still. One might almost
  have believed that for the first time during that luncheon he was really
  anxious, really troubled.</p>

  <p>"Well, this morning the carpet had been swept. The litter had gone. But
  just underneath the hearth-rug one of those crumpled slips of paper lay not
  quite hidden. I picked it up. It was a check."</p>

  <p>"Have you got it? Sylvia, have you got it?" and Garratt Skinner's voice in
  steady quietude matched his face.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Sylvia opened the little bag which she carried at her wrist and took out
  the slip of paper. She unfolded it and spread it on the table before her. The
  inside was pink.</p>

  <p>"A check for £480 on the London and County Bank, Victoria Street," she
  said.</p>

  <p>Garrett Skinner looked over the table at the paper. There was Wallie
  Hine's wavering, unfinished signature at the bottom right-hand corner.
  Parminter had guided his hand as far as the end of the Christian name, before
  he tore the check out and threw it away. The amount of the body of the check
  had been filled in in Barstow's hand.</p>

  <p>"You had better give it to me, Sylvia," he said, his fingers moving
  restlessly on the table-cloth. "That check would be a very dangerous thing if
  Parminter ever came to hear of it. Better give it to me."</p>

  <p>He leaned over and took it gently from before her, and put it carefully
  away in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Now, you see, there's more reason ever why we should get Wallie Hine away
  from those two men. He is living a bad life here. Three weeks in the country
  may set his thoughts in a different grove. Will you make this sacrifice,
  Sylvia? Will you let me ask him? It will be a good action. You see he doesn't
  know any geography."</p>

  <p>"Very well; ask him, father."</p>

  <p>Garrett Skinner reached over the table and patted her hand.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, my dear! Then that's settled. I propose that you and I go down
  this afternoon. Can you manage it? We might catch the four o'clock train from
  Waterloo if you go home now, pack up your traps and tell the housemaid to
  pack mine. I will just wind up my business and come home in time to pick you
  and the luggage up."</p>

  <p>He rose from the table, and calling a hansom, put Sylvia into it. He
  watched the cab drive out into the Strand and turn the corner. Then he went
  back to the table and asked for his bill. While he waited for it, he lit a
  match and drawing from his pocket the crumpled check, he set fire to it. He
  held it by the corner until the flame burnt his fingers. Then he dropped it
  in his plate and pounded it into ashes with a fork.</p>

  <p>"That was a bad break," he said to himself. "Left carelessly under the
  edge of the hearth-rug. A very bad break."</p>

  <p>He paid his bill, and taking his hat, sauntered out into the Strand. The
  carelessness which had left the check underneath the hearth-rug was not,
  however, the only bad break made in connection with this affair. At a certain
  moment during luncheon Garratt Skinner had unwisely smiled and had not quite
  concealed the smile with his hand. Against her every wish, that smile forced
  itself upon Sylvia's recollections as she drove home. She tried to interpret
  it in every pleasant sense, but it kept its true character in her thoughts,
  try as she might. It remained vividly a very hateful thing &mdash; the smile
  of the man who had gulled her.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12"><small>CHAPTER 12</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE HOUSE OF THE RUNNING WATER</h2>

  <p class="first">A week later, on a sunlit afternoon, Sylvia and her father
  drove northward out of Weymouth between the marshes and the bay. Sylvia was
  silent and looked about her with expectant eyes.</p>

  <p>"I have been lucky, Sylvia," her father had said to her. "I have secured
  for our summer holiday the very house in which you were born. It cost me some
  trouble, but I was determined to get it if I could, for I had an idea that
  you would be pleased. However, you are not to see it until it is quite
  ready."</p>

  <p>There was a prettiness and a delicacy in this thought which greatly
  appealed to Sylvia. He had spoken it with a smile of tenderness. Affection,
  surely, could alone have prompted it; and she thanked him very gratefully.
  They were now upon their way to take possession. A little white house set
  back under a hill and looking out across the bay from a thick cluster of
  trees caught Sylvia's eye. Was that the house, she wondered? The carriage
  turned inland and passed the white house, and half a mile further on turned
  again eastward along the road to Wareham, following the valley, which runs
  parallel to the sea. They ascended the long steep hill which climbs to
  Osmington, until upon their left hand a narrow road branched off between
  hawthorn hedges to the downs. The road dipped to a little hollow and in the
  hollow a little village nestled. A row of deep-thatched white cottages with
  leaded window-panes opened on to a causeway of stone flags which was bordered
  with purple phlox and raised above the level of the road. Farther on, the
  roof of a mill rose high among trees, and an open space showed to Sylvia the
  black massive wheel against the yellow wall. And then the carriage stopped at
  a house on the left-hand side, and Garratt Skinner got out.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," he said.</p>

  <p>It was a small square house of the Georgian days, built of old brick,
  duskily red. You entered it at the side and the big level windows of the
  living rooms looked out upon a wide and high-walled garden whence a little
  door under a brick archway in the wall gave a second entrance on to the road.
  Into this garden Sylvia wandered. If she had met with but few people who
  matched the delicate company of her dreams, here, at all events, was a
  mansion where that company might have fitly gathered. Great elms and beeches
  bent under their load of leaves to the lawn; about the lawn, flowers made a
  wealth of color, and away to the right of the house twisted stems and
  branches, where the green of the apples was turning to red, stood evenly
  spaced in a great orchard. And the mill stream tunneling under the road and
  the wall ran swiftly between green banks through the garden and the orchard,
  singing as it ran. There lingered, she thought, an ancient grace about this
  old garden, some flavor of forgotten days, as in a room scented with
  potpourri; and she walked the lawn in a great contentment.</p>

  <p>The house within charmed her no less. It was a place of many corners and
  quaint nooks, and of a flooring so unlevel that she could hardly pass from
  one room to another without taking a step up or a step down. Sylvia went
  about the house quietly and with a certain thoughtfulness. Here she had been
  born and a mystery of her life was becoming clear to her. On this summer
  evening the windows were set wide in every room, and thus in every room, as
  she passed up and down, she heard the liquid music of running water, here
  faint, like a whispered melody, there pleasant, like laughter, but nowhere
  very loud, and everywhere quite audible. In one of these rooms she had been
  born. In one of these rooms her mother had slept at nights during the weeks
  before she was born, with that music in her ears at the moment of sleep and
  at the moment of her waking. Sylvia understood now why she had always dreamed
  of running water. She wondered in which room she had been born. She tried to
  remember some corner of the house, some nook in its high-walled garden; and
  that she could not awoke in her a strange and almost eery feeling. She had
  come back to a house in which she had lived, to a scene on which her eyes had
  looked, to sounds which had murmured in her ears, and everything was as
  utterly new to her and unimagined as though now for the first time she had
  crossed the threshold. Yet these very surroundings to which her memory bore
  no testimony had assuredly modified her life, had given to her a particular
  possession, this dream of running water, and had made it a veritable element
  of her nature. She could not but reflect upon this new knowledge, and as she
  walked the garden in the darkness of the evening, she built upon it, as will
  be seen.</p>

  <p>As she stepped back over the threshold into the library where her father
  sat, she saw that he was holding a telegram in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Wallie Hine comes to-morrow, my dear," he said.</p>

  <p>Sylvia looked at her father wistfully.</p>

  <p>"It is a pity," she said, "a great pity. It would have been pleasant if we
  could have been alone."</p>

  <p>The warmth of her gladness had gone from her; she walked once more in
  shadows; there was in her voice a piteous appeal for affection, for love, of
  which she had had too little in her life and for which she greatly craved.
  She stood by the door, her lips trembling and her dark eyes for a wonder
  glistening with tears. She had always, even to those who knew her to be a
  woman, something of the child in her appearance, which made a plea from her
  lips most difficult to refuse. Now she seemed a child on whom the world
  pressed heavily before her time for suffering had come; she had so motherless
  a look. Even Garratt Skinner moved uncomfortably in his chair; even that iron
  man was stirred.</p>

  <p>"I, too, am sorry, Sylvia," he said, gently; "but we will make the best of
  it. Between us" &mdash; and he laughed gaily, setting aside from him his
  momentary compassion &mdash; "we will teach poor Wallie Hine a little
  geography, won't we?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia had no smile ready for a reply. But she bowed her head, and into
  her face and her very attitude there came an expression of patience. She
  turned and opened the door, and as she opened it, and stood with her back
  toward her father, she said in a quiet and clear voice, "Very well," and so
  passed up the stairs to her room.</p>

  <p>It might, after all, merely be kindness in her father which had led him to
  insist on Wallie Hine's visit. So she argued, and the more persistently
  because she felt that the argument was thin. He could be kind. He had been
  thoughtful for her during the past week in the small attentions which appeal
  so much to women. Because he saw that she loved flowers, he had engaged a new
  gardener for their stay; and he had shown, in one particular instance, a
  quite surprising thoughtfulness for a class of unhappy men with whom he could
  have had no concern, the convicts in Portland prison. That instance remained
  for a long time vividly in her mind, and at a later time she spoke of it with
  consequences of a far-reaching kind. She thought then, as she thought now,
  only of the kindness of her father's action, and for the first week of Hine's
  visit that thought remained with her. She was on the alert, but nothing
  occurred to arouse in her a suspicion. There were no cards, little wine was
  drunk, and early hours were kept by the whole household. Indeed, Garratt
  Skinner left entirely to his daughter the task of entertaining his guest; and
  although once he led them both over the great down to Dorchester and back, at
  a pace which tired his companions out, he preferred, for the most part, to
  smoke his pipe in a hammock in the garden with a novel at his side. The
  morning after that one expedition, he limped out into the garden, rubbing the
  muscles of his thigh.</p>

  <p>"You must look after Wallie, my dear," he said. "Age is beginning to find
  me out. And after all, he will learn more of the tact and manners which he
  wants from you than from a rough man like me," and it did not occur to
  Sylvia, who was of a natural modesty of thought, that he had any other
  intention of throwing them thus together than to rid himself of a guest with
  whom he had little in common.</p>

  <p>But a week later she changed her mind. She was driving Walter Hine one
  morning into Weymouth, and as the dog-cart turned into the road beside the
  bay, and she saw suddenly before her the sea sparkling in the sunlight, the
  dark battle-ships at their firing practice, and over against her, through a
  shimmering haze of heat, the crouching mass of Portland, she drew in a breath
  of pleasure. It seemed to her that her companion gave the same sign of
  enjoyment, and she turned to him with some surprise. But Walter Hine was
  looking to the wide beach, so black with holiday makers that it seemed at
  that distance a great and busy ant-heap.</p>

  <p>"That's what I like," he said, with a chuckle of anticipation. "Lot's o'
  people. I've knocked about too long in the thick o' things, you see, Miss
  Sylvia, kept it up &mdash; I have &mdash; seen it right through every night
  till three o'clock in the morning, for months at a time. Oh, that's the real
  thing!" he broke off. "It makes you feel good."</p>

  <p>Sylvia laughed.</p>

  <p>"Then if you dislike the country," she said, and perhaps rather eagerly,
  "why did you come to stay with us at all?"</p>

  <p>And suddenly Hine leered at her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you know!" he said, and almost he nudged her with his elbow. "I
  wouldn't have come, of course, if old Garratt hadn't particularly told me
  that you were agreeable." Sylvia grew hot with shame. She drew away, flicked
  the horse with her whip and drove on. Had she been used, she wondered, to
  lure this poor helpless youth to the sequestered village where they stayed?
  &mdash; and a chill struck through her even on that day of July. The plot had
  been carefully laid if that were so; she was to be hoodwinked no less than
  Wallie Hine. What sinister thing was then intended?</p>

  <p>She tried to shake off the dread which encompassed her, pleading to
  herself that she saw perils in shadows like the merest child. But she had not
  yet shaken it off when Walter Hine cried out excitedly to her to stop.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he said, and he pointed toward an hotel upon the sea-front which
  at that moment they were passing.</p>

  <p>Sylvia looked, and saw obsequiously smirking upon the steps of the hotel,
  with his hat lifted from his shiny head, her old enemy, Captain Barstow.
  Fortunately she had not stopped. She drove quickly on, just acknowledging his
  salute. It needed but this meeting to confirm her fears. It was not
  coincidence which had brought Captain Barstow on their heels to Weymouth. He
  had come with knowledge and a definite purpose.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I say," protested Wallie Hine, "you might have stopped, Miss Sylvia,
  and let me pass the time of day with old Barstow."</p>

  <p>Sylvia stopped the trap at once.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," she said. "You will find your own way home. We lunch at half
  past one."</p>

  <p>Hine looked doubtfully at her and then back toward the hotel.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean that I wanted to leave you, Miss Sylvia," he said. "Not by
  a long chalk."</p>

  <p>"But you must leave me, Mr. Hine," she said, looking at him with serious
  eyes, "if you want to pass the time of day with your 'red-hot' friend."</p>

  <p>There was no hint of a smile about her lips. She waited for his answer. It
  came accompanied with a smile which aimed at gallantry and was merely
  familiar.</p>

  <p>"Of course I stay where I am. What do <i>you</i> think?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia hurried over her shopping and drove homeward. She went at once to
  her father, who lay in the hammock in the shade of the trees, reading a book.
  She came up from behind him across the grass, and he was not aware of her
  approach until she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Father!" she said, and he started up.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sylvia!" he said, and just for a second there was a palpable
  uneasiness in his manner. He had not merely started. He seemed also to her to
  have been startled. But he recovered his composure.</p>

  <p>"You see, my dear, I have been thinking of you," he said, and he pointed
  to a man at work among the flower-beds. "I saw how you loved flowers, how you
  liked to have the rooms bright with them. So I hired a new gardener as a
  help. It is a great extravagance, Sylvia, but you are to blame, not I."</p>

  <p>He smiled, confident of her gratitude, and had it been but yesterday he
  would have had it offered to him in full measure. To-day, however, all her
  thoughts were poisoned by suspicion. She knew it and was distressed. She knew
  how much happiness so simple a forethought would naturally have brought to
  her. She did not indeed suspect any new peril in her father's action. She
  barely looked toward the new gardener, and certainly neglected to note
  whether he worked skilfully or no. But the fears of the morning modified her
  thanks. Moreover the momentary uneasiness of her father had not escaped her
  notice and she was wondering upon its cause.</p>

  <p>"Father," she resumed, "I saw Captain Barstow in Weymouth this
  morning."</p>

  <p>Though her eyes were on his face, and perhaps because her eyes were
  resting there with so quiet a watchfulness, she could detect no self-betrayal
  now. Garratt Skinner stared at her in pure astonishment. Then the
  astonishment gave place to annoyance.</p>

  <p>"Barstow!" he said angrily. He lay back in the hammock, looking up to the
  boughs overhead, his face wrinkled and perplexed. "He has found us out and
  followed us, Sylvia. I would not have had it happen for worlds. Did he see
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And I thought that here, at all events, we were safe from him. I wonder
  how he found us out! Bribed the caretaker in Hobart Place, I suppose."</p>

  <p>Sylvia did not accept this suggestion. She sat down upon a chair in a
  disconcerting silence, and waited. Garratt Skinner crossed his arms behind
  his head and deliberated.</p>

  <p>"Barstow's a deep fellow, Sylvia," he said. "I am afraid of him."</p>

  <p>He was looking up to the boughs overhead, but he suddenly glanced toward
  her and then quietly removed one of his hands and slipped it down to the book
  which was lying on his lap. Sylvia took quiet note of the movement. The book
  had been lying shut upon his lap, with its back toward her. Garratt Skinner
  did not alter its position; but she saw that his hand now hid from her the
  title on the back. It was a big, and had the appearance of an expensive,
  book. She noticed the binding &mdash; green cloth boards and gold lettering
  on the back. She was not familiar with the look of it, and it seemed to her
  that she might as well know &mdash; and as quickly as possible &mdash; what
  the book was and the subject with which it dealt.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Garratt Skinner repeated:</p>

  <p>"A deep fellow &mdash; Captain Barstow," and anxiously Garratt Skinner
  debated how to cope with that deep fellow. He came at last to his
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>"We can't shut our doors to him, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>Even though she had half expected just that answer, Sylvia flinched as she
  heard it uttered.</p>

  <p>"I understand your feelings, my dear," he continued in tones of
  commiseration, "for they are mine. But we must fight the Barstows with the
  Barstows' weapons. It would never do for us to close our doors. He has far
  too tight a hold of Wallie Hine as yet. He has only to drop a hint to Wallie
  that we are trying to separate him from his true friends and keep him to
  ourselves &mdash; and just think, my dear, what a horrible set of motives a
  mean-minded creature like Barstow could impute to us! Let us be candid, you
  and I," cried Garratt Skinner, starting up, as though carried away by candor.
  "Here am I, a poor man &mdash; here are you, my daughter, a girl with the
  charm and the beauty of the spring, and here's Wallie Hine, rich, weak, and
  susceptible. Oh, there's a story for a Barstow to embroider! But, Sylvia, he
  shall not so much as hint at the story. For your sake, my dear, for your
  sake," cried Garratt Skinner, with all the emphasis of a loving father. He
  wiped his forehead with his handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I was carried away by my argument," he went on in a calmer voice. Sylvia
  for her part had not been carried away at all, and no doubt her watchful
  composure helped him to subdue as ineffective the ardor of his tones.
  "Barstow has only to drop this hint to Wallie Hine, and Wallie will be off
  like a rabbit at the sound of a gun. And there's our chance gone of helping
  him to a better life. No, we must welcome Barstow, if he comes here. Yes,
  actually welcome him, however repugnant it may be to our feelings. That's
  what we must do, Sylvia. He must have no suspicion that we are working
  against him. We must lull him to sleep. That is our only way to keep Wallie
  Hine with us. So that, Sylvia, must be our plan of campaign."</p>

  <p>The luncheon bell rang as he ended his oration. He got out of the hammock
  quickly, as if to prevent discussion of his plan; and the book which he was
  carrying caught in the netting of the hammock and fell to the ground. Sylvia
  could read the title now. She did read it, hastily, as Garratt Skinner
  stooped to pick it up. It was entitled "The Alps in 1864."</p>

  <p>She knew the book by repute and was surprised to find it in her father's
  hands. She was surprised still more that he should have been at so much pains
  to conceal the title from her notice. After all, what could it matter? she
  wondered.</p>

  <p>Sylvia lay deep in misery that night. Her father had failed her utterly.
  All the high hopes with which she had set out from Chamonix had fallen, all
  the rare qualities with which her dreams had clothed him as in shining
  raiment must now be stripped from him. She was not deceived. Parminter,
  Barstow, Garratt Skinner &mdash; there was one "deep fellow" in that trio,
  but it was neither Barstow nor Parminter. It was her father. She had but to
  set the three faces side by side in her thoughts, to remember the differences
  of manner, mind and character. Garratt Skinner was the master in the
  conspiracy, the other two his mere servants. It was he who to some dark end
  had brought Barstow down from London. He loomed up in her thoughts as a
  relentless and sinister figure, unswayed by affection, yet with the power to
  counterfeit it, long-sighted for evil, sparing no one &mdash; not even his
  daughter. She recalled their first meeting in the little house in Hobart
  Place, she remembered the thoughtful voice with which, as he had looked her
  over, he had agreed that she might be "useful." She thought of his caresses,
  his smile of affection, his comradeship, and she shuddered. Walter Hine's
  words had informed her to-day to what use her father had designed her. She
  was his decoy.</p>

  <p>She lay upon her bed with her hands clenched, repeating the word in
  horror. His decoy! The moonlight poured through the open window, the music of
  the stream filled the room. She was in the house in which she had been born,
  a place mystically sacred to her thoughts; and she had come to it to learn
  that she was her father's decoy in a vulgar conspiracy to strip a weakling of
  his money. The stream sang beneath her windows, the very stream of which the
  echo had ever been rippling through her dreams. Always she had thought that
  it must have some particular meaning for her which would be revealed in due
  time. She dwelt bitterly upon her folly. There was no meaning in its light
  laughter.</p>

  <p>In a while she was aware of a change. There came a grayness in the room.
  The moonlight had lost its white brilliance, the night was waning. Sylvia
  rose from her bed, and slowly like one very tired she began to gather
  together and pack into a bag such few clothes as she could carry. She had
  made up her mind to go, and to go silently before the house waked. Whither
  she was to go, and what she was to do once she had gone, she could not think.
  She asked herself the questions in vain, feeling very lonely and very
  helpless as she moved softly about the room by the light of her candle. Her
  friend might write to her and she would not receive his letter. Still she
  must go. Once or twice she stopped her work, and crouching down upon the bed
  allowed her tears to have their way. When she had finished her preparations
  she blew out her candle, and leaning upon the sill of the open window, gave
  her face to the cool night air.</p>

  <p>There was a break in the eastern sky; already here and there a blackbird
  sang in the garden boughs, and the freshness, the quietude, swept her
  thoughts back to the Chalet de Lognan. With a great yearning she recalled
  that evening and the story of the great friendship so quietly related to her
  in the darkness, beneath the stars. The world and the people of her dreams
  existed; only there was no door of entrance into that world for her. Below
  her the stream sang, even as the glacier stream had sung, though without its
  deep note of thunder. As she listened to it, certain words spoken upon that
  evening came back to her mind and gradually began to take on a particular
  application.</p>

  <p>"What you know, that you must do, if by doing it you can save a life or
  save a soul."</p>

  <p>That was the law. "If you can save a life or save a soul." And she
  <i>did</i>know. Sylvia raised herself from the window and stood in
  thought.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner had made a great mistake that day. He had been misled by
  the gentleness of her ways, the sweet aspect of her face, and by a look of
  aloofness in her eyes, as though she lived in dreams. He had seen surely that
  she was innocent, and since he believed that knowledge must needs corrupt, he
  thought her ignorant as well. But she was not ignorant. She had detected his
  trickeries. She knew of the conspiracy, she knew of the place she filled in
  it herself; and furthermore she knew that as a decoy she had been doing her
  work. Only yesterday, Walter Hine had been forced to choose between Barstow
  and herself and he had let Barstow go. It was a small matter, no doubt. Still
  there was promise in it. What if she stayed, strengthened her hold on Walter
  Hine and grappled with the three who were ranged against him?</p>

  <p>Walter Hine was, of course, and could be, nothing to her. He was the mere
  puppet, the opportunity of obedience to the law. It was of the law that she
  was thinking &mdash; and of the voice of the man who had uttered it. She knew
  &mdash; by using her knowledge, she could save a soul. She did not think at
  this time that she might be saving a life too.</p>

  <p>Quietly she undressed and slipped into her bed. She was comforted. A smile
  had come upon her lips. She saw the face of her friend in the darkness, very
  near to her. She needed sleep to equip herself for the fight, and while
  thinking so she slept. The moonlight faded altogether, and left the room
  dark. Beneath the window the stream went singing through the lawn. After all,
  its message had been revealed to her in its due season.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13"><small>CHAPTER 13</small></a><br>
  <br>
  CHAYNE RETURNS</h2>

  <p class="first">"Hullo," cried Captain Barstow, as he wandered round the
  library after luncheon. "Here's a scatter-gun."</p>

  <p>He took the gun from a corner where it stood against the wall, opened the
  breech, shut it again, and turning to the open window lifted the stock to his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether I could hit anything nowadays," he said, taking careful
  aim at a tulip in the garden. "Any cartridges, Skinner?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, I am sure," Garratt Skinner replied, testily. The
  newspapers had only this moment been brought into the room, and he did not
  wish to be disturbed. Sylvia had never noticed that double-barreled gun
  before; and she wondered whether it had been brought into the room that
  morning. She watched Captain Barstow bustle into the hall and back again.
  Finally he pounced upon an oblong card-box which lay on the top of a low
  book-case. He removed the lid and pulled out a cartridge.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" said he. "No. 6. The very thing! I am going to take a pot at the
  starlings, Skinner. There are too many of them about for your
  fruit-trees."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Garratt Skinner, lazily lifting his eyes from his
  newspaper and looking out across the lawn. "Only take care you don't wing my
  new gardener."</p>

  <p>"No fear of that," said Barstow, and filling his pockets with cartridges
  he took the gun in his hand and skipped out into the garden. In a moment a
  shot was heard, and Walter Hine rose from his chair and walked to the window.
  A second shot followed.</p>

  <p>"Old Barstow can't shoot for nuts," said Hine, with a chuckle, and in his
  turn he stepped out into the garden. Sylvia made no attempt to hinder him,
  but she took his place at the window ready to intervene. A flight of
  starlings passed straight and swift over Barstow's head. He fired both
  barrels and not one of the birds fell. Hine spoke to him, and the gun at once
  changed hands. At the next flight Hine fired and one of the birds dropped.
  Barstow's voice was raised in jovial applause.</p>

  <p>"That was a good egg, Wallie. A very good egg. Let me try now!" and so
  alternately they shot as the birds darted overhead across the lawn. Sylvia
  waited for the moment when Barstow's aim would suddenly develop a deadly
  precision, but that moment did not come. If there was any betting upon this
  match, Hine would not be the loser. She went quietly back to a writing-desk
  and wrote her letters. She had no wish to rouse in her father's mind a
  suspicion that she had guessed his design and was setting herself to thwart
  it. She must work secretly, more secretly than he did himself. Meanwhile the
  firing continued in the garden; and unobserved by Sylvia, Garratt Skinner
  began to take in it a stealthy interest. His chair was so placed that,
  without stirring, he could look into the garden and at the same time keep an
  eye on Sylvia; if she moved an elbow or raised her head, Garratt Skinner was
  at once reading his paper with every appearance of concentration. On the
  other hand, her back was turned toward him, so that she saw neither his keen
  gaze into the garden nor the good-tempered smile of amusement with which he
  turned his eyes upon his daughter.</p>

  <p>In this way perhaps an hour passed; certainly no more. Sylvia had, in
  fact, almost come to the end of her letters, when Garratt Skinner suddenly
  pushed back his chair and stood up. At the noise, abrupt as a startled cry,
  Sylvia turned swiftly round. She saw that her father was gazing with a look
  of perplexity into the garden, and that for the moment he had forgotten her
  presence. She crossed the room quickly and noiselessly, and standing just
  behind his elbow, saw what he saw. The blood flushed her throat and mounted
  into her cheeks, her eyes softened, and a smile of welcome transfigured her
  grave face. Her friend Hilary Chayne was standing under the archway of the
  garden door. He had closed the door behind him, but he had not moved
  thereafter, and he was not looking toward the house. His attention was
  riveted upon the shooting-match. Sylvia gave no thought to his attitude at
  the moment. He had come &mdash; that was enough. And Garratt Skinner, turning
  about, saw the light in his daughter's face.</p>

  <p>"You know him!" he cried, roughly.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"He has come to see you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You should have told me," said Garratt Skinner, angrily. "I dislike
  secrecies." Sylvia raised her eyes and looked her father steadily in the
  face. But Garratt Skinner was not so easily abashed. He returned her look as
  steadily.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" he continued, in a voice of authority.</p>

  <p>"Captain Hilary Chayne."</p>

  <p>It seemed for a moment that the name was vaguely familiar to Garratt
  Skinner, and Sylvia added:</p>

  <p>"I met him this summer in Switzerland."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," said her father, and he looked with a new interest across the
  garden to the door. "He is a great friend."</p>

  <p>"My only friend," returned Sylvia, softly; and her father stepped forward
  and called aloud, holding up his hand:</p>

  <p>"Barstow! Barstow!"</p>

  <p>Sylvia noticed then, and not till then, that the coming of her friend was
  not the only change which had taken place since she had last looked out upon
  the garden. The new gardener was now shooting alternately with Walter Hine,
  while Captain Barstow, standing a few feet behind them, recorded the hits in
  a little book. He looked up at the sound of Garratt Skinner's voice and
  perceiving Chayne at once put a stop to the match. Garratt Skinner turned
  again to his daughter, and spoke now without any anger at all. There was just
  a hint of reproach in his voice, but as though to lessen the reproof he laid
  his hand affectionately upon her arm.</p>

  <p>"Any friend of yours is welcome, of course, my dear. But you might have
  told me that you expected him. Let us have no secrets from each other in the
  future? Now bring him in, and we will see if we can give him a cup of
  tea."</p>

  <p>He rang the bell. Sylvia did not think it worth while to argue that
  Chayne's coming was a surprise to her as much as to her father. She crossed
  the garden toward her friend. But she walked slowly and still more slowly.
  Her memories had flown back to the evening when they had bidden each other
  good-by on the little platform in front of the Chalet de Lognan. Not in this
  way had she then planned that they should meet again, nor in such company.
  The smile had faded from her lips, the light of gladness had gone from her
  eyes. Barstow and Walter Hine were moving toward the house. It mortified her
  exceedingly that her friend should find her amongst such companions. She
  almost wished that he had not found her out at all. And so she welcomed him
  with a great restraint.</p>

  <p>"It was kind of you to come," she said. "How did you know I was here?"</p>

  <p>"I called at your house in London. The caretaker gave me the address," he
  replied. He took her hand and, holding it, looked with the careful scrutiny
  of a lover into her face.</p>

  <p>"You have needed those memories of your one day to fall back upon," he
  said, regretfully. "Already you have needed them. I am very sorry."</p>

  <p>Sylvia did not deny the implication of the words that "troubles" had come.
  She turned to him, grateful that he should so clearly have remembered what
  she had said upon that day.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she answered, gently. "My father would like to know you. I
  wrote to you that I had come to live with him."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You were surprised?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, quietly. "You came to some important decision on the
  very top of the Aiguille d'Argentière. That I knew at the time, for I watched
  you. When I got your letter, I understood what the decision was."</p>

  <p>To leave Chamonix &mdash; to break completely with her life &mdash; it was
  just to that decision she would naturally have come just on that spot during
  that one sunlit hour. So much his own love of the mountains taught him. But
  Sylvia was surprised at his insight; and what with that and the proof that
  their day together had remained vividly in his thoughts, she caught back
  something of his comradeship. As they crossed the lawn to the house her
  embarrassment diminished. She drew comfort, besides, from the thought that
  whatever her friend might think of Captain Barstow and Walter Hine, her
  father at all events would impress him, even as she had been impressed.
  Chayne would see at once that here was a man head and shoulders above his
  companions, finer in quality, different in speech.</p>

  <p>But that afternoon her humiliation was to be complete. Her father had no
  fancy for the intrusion of Captain Chayne into his quiet and sequestered
  house. The flush of color on his daughter's face, the leap of light into her
  eyes, had warned him. He had no wish to lose his daughter. Chayne, too, might
  be inconveniently watchful. Garratt Skinner desired no spy upon his little
  plans. Consequently he set himself to play the host with an offensive
  geniality which was calculated to disgust a man with any taste for good
  manners. He spoke in a voice which Sylvia did not know, so coarse it was in
  quality, so boisterous and effusive; and he paraded Walter Hine and Captain
  Barstow with the pride of a man exhibiting his dearest friends.</p>

  <p>"You must know 'red-hot' Barstow, Captain Chayne," he cried, slapping the
  little man lustily on the back. "One of the very best. You are both brethren
  of the sword."</p>

  <p>Barstow sniggered obsequiously and screwed his eye-glass into his eye.</p>

  <p>"Delighted, I am sure. But I sheathed the sword some time ago, Captain
  Chayne."</p>

  <p>"And exchanged it for the betting book," Chayne added, quietly.</p>

  <p>Barstow laughed nervously.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you refer to our little match in the garden," he said. "We dragged
  the gardener into it."</p>

  <p>"So I saw," Chayne replied. "The gardener seemed to be a remarkable shot.
  I think he would be a match for more than one professional."</p>

  <p>And turning away he saw Sylvia's eyes fixed upon him, and on her face an
  expression of trouble and dismay so deep that he could have bitten off his
  tongue for speaking. She had been behind him while he had spoken; and though
  he had spoken in a low voice, she had heard every word. She bent her head
  over the tea-table and busied herself with the cups. But her hands shook; her
  face burned, she was tortured with shame. She had set herself to do battle
  with her father, and already in the first skirmish she had been defeated.
  Chayne's indiscreet words had laid bare to her the elaborate conspiracy. The
  new gardener, the gun in the corner, the cartridges which had to be looked
  for, Barstow's want of skill, Hine's superiority which had led Barstow so
  naturally to offer to back the gardener against him &mdash; all was clear to
  her. It was the little round game of cards all over again; and she had not
  possessed the wit to detect the trick! And that was not all. Her friend had
  witnessed it and understood!</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

  </div>

  <p>She heard her father presenting Walter Hine, and with almost intolerable
  pain she realized that had he wished to leave Chayne no single opportunity of
  misapprehension, he would have spoken just these words and no others.</p>

  <p>"Wallie is the grandson &mdash; and indeed the heir &mdash; of old Joseph
  Hine. You know his name, no doubt. Joseph Hine's Château Marlay, what? A warm
  man, Joseph Hine. I don't know a man more rich. Treats his grandson
  handsomely into the bargain, eh, Wallie?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia felt that her heart would break. That Garrett Skinner's admission
  was boldly and cunningly deliberate did not occur to her. She simply
  understood that here was the last necessary piece of evidence given to
  Captain Chayne which would convince him that he had been this afternoon the
  witness of a robbery and swindle.</p>

  <p>She became aware that Chayne was standing beside her. She did not lift her
  face, for she feared that it would betray her. She wished with all her heart
  that he would just replace his cup upon the tray and go away without a word.
  He could not want to stay; he could not want to return. He had no place here.
  If he would go away quietly, without troubling to take leave of her, she
  would be very grateful and do justice to him for his kindness.</p>

  <p>But though he had the mind to go, it was not without a word.</p>

  <p>"I want you to walk with me as far as the door," he said, gently.</p>

  <p>Sylvia rose at once. Since after all there must be words, the sooner they
  were spoken the better. She followed him into the garden, making her little
  prayer that they might be very few, and that he would leave her to fight her
  battle and to hide her shame alone.</p>

  <p>They crossed the lawn without a word. He held open the garden door for her
  and she passed into the lane. He followed and closed the door behind them. In
  the lane a hired landau was waiting. Chayne pointed to it.</p>

  <p>"I want you to come away with me now," he said, and since she looked at
  him with the air of one who does not understand, he explained, standing
  quietly beside her with his eyes upon her face. And though he spoke quietly,
  there was in his eyes a hunger which belied his tones, and though he stood
  quietly, there was a tension in his attitude which betrayed extreme suspense.
  "I want you to come away with me, I want you never to return. I want you to
  marry me."</p>

  <p>The blood rushed into her cheeks and again fled from them, leaving her
  very white. Her face grew mutinous like an angry child's, but her eyes grew
  hard like a resentful woman's.</p>

  <p>"You ask me out of pity," she said, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"That's not true," he cried, and with so earnest a passion that she could
  not but believe him. "Sylvia, I came here meaning to ask you to marry me. I
  ask you something more now, that is all. I ask you to come to me a little
  sooner &mdash; that is all. I want you to come with me now."</p>

  <p>Sylvia leaned against the wall and covered her face with her hands.</p>

  <p>"Please!" he said, making his appeal with a great simplicity. "For I love
  you, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>She gave him no answer. She kept her face still hid, and only her heaving
  breast bore witness to her stress of feeling. Gently he removed her hands,
  and holding them in his, urged his plea.</p>

  <p>"Ever since that day in Switzerland, I have been thinking of you, Sylvia,
  remembering your looks, your smile, and the words you spoke. I crossed the
  Col Dolent the next day, and all the time I felt that there was some great
  thing wanting. I said to myself, 'I miss my friend.' I was wrong, Sylvia. I
  missed you. Something ached in me &mdash; has ached ever since. It was my
  heart! Come with me now!"</p>

  <p>Sylvia had not looked at him, though she made no effort to draw her hands
  away, and still not looking at him, she answered in a whisper:</p>

  <p>"I can't, I can't."</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked, "why? You are not happy here. You are no happier than you
  were at Chamonix. And I would try so very hard to make you happy. I can't
  leave you here &mdash; lonely, for you are lonely. I am lonely too; all the
  more lonely because I carry about with me &mdash; you &mdash; you as you
  stood in the chalet at night looking through the open window, with the
  candle-light striking upward on your face, and with your reluctant smile upon
  your lips &mdash; you as you lay on the top of the Aiguille d'Argentière with
  the wonder of a new world in your eyes &mdash; you as you said good-by in the
  sunset and went down the winding path to the forest. If you only knew,
  Sylvia!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I don't know," she answered, and now she looked at him. "I
  suppose that, if I loved, I should know, I should understand."</p>

  <p>Her hands lay in his, listless and unresponsive to the pressure of his.
  She spoke slowly and thoughtfully, meeting his gaze with troubled eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yet you were glad to see me when I came," he urged.</p>

  <p>"Glad, yes! You are my friend, my one friend. I was very glad. But the
  gladness passed. When you asked me to come with you across the garden, I was
  wanting you to go away."</p>

  <p>The words hurt him. They could not but hurt him. But she was so plainly
  unconscious of offence, she was so plainly trying to straighten out her own
  tangled position, that he could feel no anger.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked; and again she frankly answered him.</p>

  <p>"I was humbled," she replied, "and I have had so much humiliation in my
  life."</p>

  <p>The very quietude of her voice and the wistful look upon the young tired
  face hurt him far more than her words had done.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia," he cried, and he drew her toward him. "Come with me now! My
  dear, there will be an end of all humiliation. We can be married, we can go
  down to my home on the Sussex Downs. That old house needs a mistress, Sylvia.
  It is very lonely." He drew a breath and smiled suddenly. "And I would like
  so much to show you it, to show you all the corners, the bridle-paths across
  the downs, the woods, and the wide view from Arundel to Chichester spires.
  Sylvia, come!"</p>

  <p>Just for a moment it seemed that she leaned toward him. He put his arm
  about her and held her for a moment closer. But her head was lowered, not
  lifted up to his; and then she freed herself gently from his clasp.</p>

  <p>She faced him with a little wrinkle of thought between her brows and spoke
  with an air of wisdom which went very prettily with the childlike beauty of
  her face.</p>

  <p>"You are my friend," she said, "a friend I am very grateful for, but you
  are not more than that to me. I am frank. You see, I am thinking now of
  reasons which would not trouble me if I loved you. Marriage with me would do
  you no good, would hurt you in your career."</p>

  <p>"No," he protested.</p>

  <p>"But I am thinking that it would," she replied, steadily, "and I do not
  believe that I should give much thought to it, if I really loved you. I am
  thinking of something else, too&mdash;" and she spoke more boldly, choosing
  her words with care &mdash; "of a plan which before you came I had formed, of
  a task which before you came I had set myself to do. I am still thinking of
  it, still feeling that I ought to go on with it. I do not think that I should
  feel that if I loved. I think nothing else would count at all except that I
  loved. So you are still my friend, and I cannot go with you."</p>

  <p>Chayne looked at her for a moment sadly, with a mist before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I leave you to much unhappiness," he said, "and I hate the thought of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Not quite so much now as before you came," she answered. "I am proud, you
  know, that you asked me," and putting her troubles aside, she smiled at him
  bravely, as though it was he who needed comforting. "Good-by! Let me hear of
  you through your success."</p>

  <p>So again they said good-by at the time of sunset. Chayne mounted into the
  landau and drove back along the road to Weymouth. "So that's the end," said
  Sylvia. She opened the door and passed again into the garden. Through the
  window of the library she saw her father and Walter Hine, watching, it
  seemed, for her appearance. It was borne in upon her suddenly that she could
  not meet them or speak with them, and she ran very quickly round the house to
  the front door, and escaped unaccosted to her room.</p>

  <p>In the library Hine turned to Garratt Skinner with one of his rare flashes
  of shrewdness.</p>

  <p>"She didn't want to meet us," he said, jealously. "Do you think she cares
  for him?"</p>

  <p>"I think," replied Garratt Skinner with a smile, "that Captain Chayne will
  not trouble us with his company again."</p>

  <br>
  AN OLD PASSION BETRAYS A NEW SECRET</h2>

  <p class="first">Garratt Skinner, however, was wrong. He was not aware of the
  great revolution which had taken place in Chayne; and he misjudged his
  tenacity. Chayne, like many another man, had mapped out his life only to find
  that events would happen in a succession different to that which he had
  ordained. He had arranged to devote his youth and the earlier part of his
  manhood entirely to his career, if the career were not brought to a premature
  end in the Alps. That possibility he had always foreseen. He took his risks
  with full knowledge, setting the gain against them, and counting them worth
  while. If then he lived, he proposed at some indefinite time, in the late
  thirties, to fall in love and marry. He had no parents living; there was the
  empty house upon the Sussex Downs; and the small estate which for generations
  had descended from father to son. Marriage was thus a recognized event. Only
  it was thrust away into an indefinite future. But there had come an evening
  which he had not foreseen, when, sorely grieved by the loss of his great
  friend, he had fallen in with a girl who gave with open hands the sympathy he
  needed, and claimed, by her very reticence and humility, his sympathy in
  return. A day had followed upon that evening; and thenceforth the image of
  Sylvia standing upon the snow-ridge of the Aiguille d'Argentière, with a few
  strips of white cloud sailing in a blue sky overhead, the massive pile of
  Mont Blanc in front, freed to the sunlight which was her due, remained fixed
  and riveted in his thoughts. He began in imagination to refer matters of
  moment to her judgment; he began to save up little events of interest that he
  might remember to tell them to her. He understood that he had a companion,
  even when he was alone, a condition which he had not anticipated even for his
  late thirties. And he came to the conclusion that he had not that complete
  ordering of his life on which he had counted. He was not, however,
  disappointed. He seized upon the good thing which had come to him with a
  great deal of wonder and a very thankful heart; and he was not disposed to
  let it lightly go.</p>

  <p>Thus the vulgarity which Garratt Skinner chose to assume, the unattractive
  figure of "red-hot" Barstow, and the obvious swindle which was being
  perpetrated on Walter Hine, had the opposite effect to that which Skinner
  expected. Chayne, instead of turning his back upon so distasteful a company,
  frequented it in the resolve to take Sylvia out of its grasp. It did not need
  a lover to see that she slept little of nights and passed distressful days.
  She had fled from her mother's friends at Chamonix, only to find herself
  helpless amongst a worse gang in her father's house. Very well. She must be
  released. He had proposed to take her away then and there. She had refused.
  Well, he had been blunt. He would go about the business in the future in a
  more delicate way. And so he came again and again to the little house under
  the hill where the stream babbled through the garden, and every day the
  apples grew redder upon the boughs.</p>

  <p>But it was disheartening work. His position indeed became difficult, and
  it needed all his tenacity to enable him to endure it. The difficulty became
  very evident one afternoon early in August, and the afternoon was, moveover,
  remarkable in that Garratt Skinner was betrayed into a revelation of himself
  which was to bear consequences of gravity in a future which he could not
  foresee. Chayne rode over upon that afternoon, and found Garratt Skinner
  alone and, according to his habit, stretched at full-length in his hammock
  with a cigar between his lips. He received Captain Chayne with the utmost
  geniality. He had long since laid aside his ineffectual vulgarity of
  manner.</p>

  <p>"You must put up with me, Captain Chayne," he said. "My daughter is out.
  However, she &mdash; I ought more properly to say, they &mdash; will be back
  no doubt before long."</p>

  <p>"They being&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sylvia and Walter Hine."</p>

  <p>Chayne nodded his head. He had known very well who "they" must be, but he
  had not been able to refrain from the question. Jealousy had hold of him. He
  knew nothing of Sylvia's determination to acquire a power greater than her
  father's over the vain and defenceless youth. The words with which she had
  hinted her plan to him had been too obscure to convey their meaning. He was
  simply aware that Sylvia more and more avoided him, more and more sought the
  companionship of Walter Hine; and such experience as he had, taught him that
  women were as apt to be blind in their judgment of men as men in their
  estimation of women.</p>

  <p>He sought now to enlist Garratt Skinner on his side, and drawing a chair
  nearer to the hammock he sat down.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Skinner," he said, speaking upon an impulse, "you have no doubt in
  your mind, I suppose, as to why I come here so often."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner smiled.</p>

  <p>"I make a guess, I admit."</p>

  <p>"I should be very glad if your daughter would marry me," Chayne continued,
  "and I want you to give me your help. I am not a poor man, Mr. Skinner, and I
  should certainly be willing to recognize that in taking her away from you I
  laid myself under considerable obligations."</p>

  <p>Chayne spoke with some natural hesitation, but Garratt Skinner was not in
  the least offended.</p>

  <p>"I will not pretend to misunderstand you," he replied. "Indeed, I like
  your frankness. Please take what I say in the same spirit. I cannot give you
  any help, Captain Chayne."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner raised himself upon his elbow, and fixing his eyes upon
  his companion's face, said distinctly and significantly:</p>

  <p>"Because Sylvia has her work to do here."</p>

  <p>Chayne in his turn made no pretence to misunderstand. He was being told
  clearly that Sylvia was in league with her father and Captain Barstow to
  pluck Walter Hine. But he was anxious to discover how far Garratt Skinner's
  cynicism would carry him.</p>

  <p>"Will you define the work?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If you wish it," replied Garratt Skinner, falling back in his hammock. "I
  should have thought it unnecessary myself. The work is the reclaiming of
  Wallie Hine from the very undesirable company in which he has mixed. Do you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Chayne. He understood very well. He had been told first the
  real design &mdash; to pluck Walter Hine &mdash; and then the excuse which
  was to cloak it. He understood, too, the reason why this information had been
  given to him with so cynical a frankness. He, Chayne, was in the way. Declare
  the swindle and persuade him that Sylvia was a party to it &mdash; what more
  likely way could be discovered for getting rid of Captain Chayne? He looked
  at his smiling companion, took note of his strong aquiline face, his clear
  and steady eyes. He recognized a redoubtable antagonist, but he leaned
  forward and said with a quiet emphasis:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Skinner, I have, nevertheless, not lost heart."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner laughed in a friendly way.</p>

  <p>"I suppose not. It is only in the wisdom of middle age that we lose heart.
  In youth we lose our hearts &mdash; a very different thing."</p>

  <p>"I propose still to come to this house."</p>

  <p>"As often as you will, Captain Chayne," said Garratt Skinner, gaily. "My
  doors are always open to you. I am not such a fool as to give you a romantic
  interest by barring you out."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner had another reason for his hospitality which he kept to
  himself. He was inclined to believe that a few more visits from Captain
  Chayne would settle his chances without the necessity of any interference. It
  was Garratt Skinner's business, as that of any other rogue, to play with
  simple artifices upon the faults and vanities of men. He had, therefore,
  cultivated a habit of observation; he had become naturally attentive to
  trifles which others might overlook; and he was aware that he needed to go
  very warily in the delicate business on which he was now engaged. He was
  fighting Sylvia for the possession of Walter Hine &mdash; that he had
  recognized &mdash; and Chayne for the possession of Sylvia. It was a
  three-cornered contest, and he had in consequence kept his eyes alert. He had
  noticed that Chayne was growing importunate, and that his persistence was
  becoming troublesome to Sylvia. She gave him a less warm welcome each time
  that he came to the house. She made plans to prevent herself being left alone
  with him, and if by chance the plans failed she listened rather than talked
  and listened almost with an air of boredom.</p>

  <p>"Come as often as you please!" consequently said Garratt Skinner from his
  hammock. "And now let us talk of something else."</p>

  <p>He talked of nothing for a while. But it was plain that he had a subject
  in his thoughts. For twice he turned to Chayne and was on the point of
  speaking; but each time he thought silence the better part and lay back
  again. Chayne waited and at last the subject was broached, but in a queer,
  hesitating, diffident way, as though Garratt Skinner spoke rather under a
  compulsion of which he disapproved.</p>

  <p>"Tell me!" he said. "I am rather interested. A craze, an infatuation which
  so masters people must be interesting even to the stay-at-homes like myself.
  But I am wrong to call it a craze. From merely reading books I think it a
  passion which is easily intelligible. You are wondering what I am talking
  about. My daughter tells me that you are a famous climber. The Aiguille
  d'Argentière, I suppose, up which you were kind enough to accompany her, is
  not a very difficult mountain."</p>

  <p>"It depends upon the day," said Chayne, "and the state of the snow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is what I have gathered from the books. Every mountain may
  become dangerous."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Each mountain," said Garratt Skinner, thoughtfully, "may reward its
  conquerors with death"; and for a little while he lay looking up to the green
  branches interlaced above his head. "Thus each mountain on the brightest day
  holds in its recesses mystery, and also death."</p>

  <p>There had come a change already in the manner of the two men. They found
  themselves upon neutral ground. Their faces relaxed from wariness; they were
  no longer upon their guard. It seemed that an actual comradeship had sprung
  up between them.</p>

  <p>"There is a mountain called the Grépon," said Skinner. "I have seen
  pictures of it &mdash; a strange and rather attractive pinnacle, with its
  knife-like slabs of rock, set on end one above the other &mdash; black rock
  splashed with red &mdash; and the overhanging boulder on the top. Have you
  climbed it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"There is a crack, I believe &mdash; a good place to get you into
  training."</p>

  <p>Chayne laughed with the enjoyment of a man who recollects a stiff
  difficulty overcome.</p>

  <p>"Yes, to the right of the Col between the Grépon and the Charmoz. There is
  a step half way up &mdash; otherwise there is very little hold and the crack
  is very steep."</p>

  <p>They talked of other peaks, such as the Charmoz, where the first lines of
  ascent had given place to others more recently discovered, of new variations,
  new ascents and pinnacles still unclimbed; and then Garratt Skinner said:</p>

  <p>"I saw that a man actually crossed the Col des Nantillons early this
  summer. It used to be called the Col de Blaitière. He was killed with his
  guide, but after the real dangers were passed. That seems to happen at
  times."</p>

  <p>Chayne looked at Garratt Skinner in surprise.</p>

  <p>"It is strange that you should have mentioned John Lattery's death," he
  said, slowly.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Garratt Skinner, turning quietly toward his companion. "I
  read of it in 'The Times.'"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. No doubt it was described. What I meant was this. John Lattery
  was my great friend, and he was a distant kind of cousin to your friend
  Walter Hine, and indeed co-heir with him to Joseph Hine's great fortune. His
  death, I suppose, has doubled your friend's inheritance."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner raised himself up on his elbow. The announcement was
  really news to him.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" he asked. "It is true, then. The mountains hold death too in
  their recesses &mdash; even on the clearest day &mdash; yes, they hold death
  too!" And letting himself fall gently back upon his cushions, he remained for
  a while with a very thoughtful look upon his face. Twice Chayne spoke to him,
  and twice he did not hear. He lay absorbed. It seemed that a new and
  engrossing idea had taken possession of his mind, and when he turned his eyes
  again to Chayne and spoke, he appeared to be speaking with reference to that
  idea rather than to any remarks of his companion.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever ascend Mont Blanc by the Brenva route?" he asked. "There's a
  thin ridge of ice &mdash; I read an account in Moore's 'Journal' &mdash; you
  have to straddle across the ridge with a leg hanging down either
  precipice."</p>

  <p>Chayne shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Lattery and I meant to try it this summer. The Dent du Requin as
  well."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is one of the modern rock scrambles, isn't it? The last two or
  three hundred feet are the trouble, I believe."</p>

  <p>And so the talk went on and the comradeship grew. But Chayne noticed that
  always Garratt Skinner came back to the great climbs of the earlier
  mountaineers, the Brenva ascent of Mont Blanc, the Col Dolent, the two points
  of the Aiguille du Dru and the Aiguille Verte.</p>

  <p>"But you, too, have climbed," Chayne cried at length.</p>

  <p>"On winter nights by my fireside," replied Garratt Skinner, with a smile.
  "I have a lame leg which would hinder me."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, you left Miss Sylvia and myself behind when you led us over
  the hills to Dorchester."</p>

  <p>It was Walter Hine who interrupted. He had come across the grass from
  behind, and neither of the two men had noticed his approach. But the moment
  when he did interrupt marked a change in their demeanor. The comradeship
  which had so quickly bloomed as quickly faded. It was the flower of an idle
  moment. Antagonism preceded and followed it. Thus, one might imagine, might
  sentries at the outposts of opposing armies pile their arms for half an hour
  and gossip of their homes or their children, or of something dear to both of
  them and separate at the bugle sound. Garratt Skinner swung himself out of
  his hammock.</p>

  <p>"Where's Sylvia, Wallie?"</p>

  <p>"She went up to her room."</p>

  <p>Chayne waited for ten minutes, and for another ten, and still Sylvia did
  not appear. She was avoiding him. She could spend the afternoon with Walter
  Hine, but she must run to her room when he came upon the scene. Jealousy
  flamed up in him. Every now and then a whimsical smile of amusement showed
  upon Garratt Skinner's face and broadened into a grin. Chayne was looking a
  fool, and was quite conscious of it. He rose abruptly from his chair.</p>

  <p>"I must be going," he said, over loudly, and Garratt Skinner smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid she won't hear that," he said softly, measuring with his eyes
  the distance between the group and the house. "But come again, Captain
  Chayne, and sit it out."</p>

  <p>Chayne flushed with anger. He said, "Thank you," and tried to say it
  jauntily and failed. He took his leave and walked across the lawn to the
  garden, trying to assume a carriage of indifference and dignity. But every
  moment he expected to hear the two whom he had left laughing at his
  discomfiture. Neither, however, did laugh. Walter Hine was, indeed,
  indignant.</p>

  <p>"Why did you ask him to come again?" he asked, angrily, as the garden door
  closed upon Chayne.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner laid his hand on Walter Hine's arm.</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry, Wallie," he said, confidentially. "Every time Chayne
  comes here he loses ten marks. Give him rope! He does not, after all, know a
  great deal of geography."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15"><small>CHAPTER 15</small></a><br>
  <br>
  KENYON'S JOHN LATTERY</h2>

  <p class="first">Chayne returned to London on the following day, restless and
  troubled. Jealousy, he knew, was the natural lot of the lover. But that he
  should have to be jealous of a Walter Hine &mdash; there was the sting. He
  asked the old question over and over again, the old futile question which the
  unrewarded suitor puts to himself with amazement and a despair at the
  ridiculous eccentricities of human nature. "What in the world can she see in
  the fellow?" However, he did not lose heart. It was not in his nature to let
  go once he had clearly set his desires upon a particular goal. Sooner or
  later, people and things would adjust themselves to their proper proportions
  in Sylvia's eyes. Meanwhile there was something to be done &mdash; a doubt to
  be set at rest, perhaps a discovery to be made.</p>

  <p>His conversation with Garratt Skinner, the subject which Garratt Skinner
  had chosen, and the knowledge with which he had spoken, had seemed to Chayne
  rather curious. A man might sit by his fireside and follow with interest, nay
  almost with the passion of the mountaineer, the history of Alpine exploration
  and adventure. That had happened before now. And very likely Chayne would
  have troubled himself no more about Garratt Skinner's introduction of the
  theme but for one or two circumstances which the more he reflected upon them
  became the more significant. For instance: Garratt Skinner had spoken and had
  asked questions about the new ascents made, the new passes crossed within the
  last twenty years, just as a man would ask who had obtained his knowledge out
  of books. But of the earlier ascents he had spoken differently, though the
  difference was subtle and hard to define. He seemed to be upon more familiar
  ground. He left in Chayne's mind a definite suspicion that he was speaking no
  longer out of books, but from an intimate personal knowledge, the knowledge
  of actual experience. The suspicion had grown up gradually, but it had
  strengthened almost into a conviction.</p>

  <p>It was to the old climbs that Garratt Skinner's conversation perpetually
  recurred &mdash; the Aiguille Verte, the Grand and the Petit Dru and the
  traverse between them, the Col Dolent, the Grandes Jorasses and the Brenva
  route &mdash; yes, above all, the Brenva route up Mont Blanc. Moreover, how
  in the world should he know that those slabs of black granite on the top of
  the Grépon were veined with red &mdash; splashed with red as he described
  them? Unless he had ascended them, or the Aiguille des Charmoz opposite
  &mdash; how should he know? The philosophy of his guide Michel Revailloud
  flashed across Chayne's mind. "One needs some one with whom to exchange one's
  memories."</p>

  <p>Had Garratt Skinner felt that need and felt it with so much compulsion
  that he must satisfy it in spite of himself? Yet why should he practise
  concealment at all? There certainly had been concealment. Chayne remembered
  how more than once Garratt Skinner had checked himself before at last he had
  yielded. It was in spite of himself that he had spoken. And then suddenly as
  the train drew up at Vauxhall Station for the tickets to be collected, Chayne
  started up in his seat. On the rocks of the Argentière, beside the great
  gully, as they descended to the glacier, Sylvia's guide had spoken words
  which came flying back into Chayne's thoughts. She had climbed that day,
  though it was her first mountain, as if knowledge of the craft had been born
  in her. How to stand upon an ice-slope, how to hold her ax &mdash; she had
  known. On the rocks, too! Which foot to advance, with which hand to grasp the
  hold &mdash; she had known. Suppose that knowledge <i>had</i> been born in
  her! Why, then those words of her guide began to acquire significance. She
  had reminded him of some one &mdash; some one whose name he could not
  remember &mdash; but some one with whom years ago he had climbed. And then
  upon the rocks, some chance movement of Sylvia's, some way in which she moved
  from ledge to ledge, had revealed to him the name &mdash; Gabriel Strood.</p>

  <p>Was it possible, Chayne asked? If so, what dark thing was there in the
  record of Strood's life that he must change his name, disappear from the
  world, and avoid the summer nights, the days of sunshine and storm on the
  high rock- ledges and the ice-slope?</p>

  <p>Chayne was minded to find an answer to that question. Sylvia was in
  trouble; that house under the downs was no place for her. He himself was
  afraid of what was being planned there. It might help him if he knew
  something more of Garratt Skinner than he knew at present. And it seemed to
  him that there was just a chance of acquiring that knowledge.</p>

  <p>He dined at his club, and at ten o'clock walked up St. James' Street. The
  street was empty. It was a hot starlit night of the first week in August, and
  there came upon him a swift homesickness for the world above the snow-line.
  How many of his friends were sleeping that night in mountain huts high up on
  the shoulders of the mountains or in bivouacs open to the stars with a
  rock-cliff at their backs and a fire of pine wood blazing at their feet. Most
  likely amongst those friends was the one he sought to-night.</p>

  <p>"Still there's a chance that I may find him," he pleaded, and crossing
  Piccadilly passed into Dover Street. Half way along the street of milliners,
  he stopped before a house where a famous scholar had his lodging.</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Kenyon in London?" he asked, and the man-servant replied to his
  great relief:</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, but he is not yet at home."</p>

  <p>"I will wait for him," said Chayne.</p>

  <p>He was shown into the study and left there with a lighted lamp. The room
  was lined with books from floor to ceiling. Chayne mounted a ladder and took
  down from a high corner some volumes bound simply in brown cloth. They were
  volumes of the "Alpine Journal." He had chosen those which dated back from
  twenty years to a quarter of a century. He drew a chair up beside the lamp
  and began eagerly to turn over the pages. Often he stopped, for the name of
  which he was in search often leaped to his eyes from the pages. Chayne read
  of the exploits in the Alps of Gabriel Strood. More than one new expedition
  was described, many variations of old ascents, many climbs already familiar.
  It was clear that the man was of the true brotherhood. A new climb was very
  well, but the old were as good to Gabriel Strood, and the climb which he had
  once made he had the longing to repeat with new companions. None of the
  descriptions were written by Strood himself but all by companions whom he had
  led, and most of them bore testimony to an unusual endurance, an unusual
  courage, as though Strood triumphed perpetually over a difficulty which his
  companions did not share and of which only vague hints were given. At last
  Chayne came to that very narrative which Sylvia had been reading on her way
  to Chamonix &mdash; and there the truth was bluntly told for the first
  time.</p>

  <p>Chayne started up in that dim and quiet room, thrilled. He had the proof
  now, under his finger &mdash; the indisputable proof. Gabriel Strood suffered
  from an affection of the muscles in his right thigh, and yet managed to out-
  distance all his rivals. Hine's words drummed in Chayne's ears:</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless he left us all behind."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner: Gabriel Strood. Surely, surely! He replaced the volumes
  and took others down. In the first which he opened &mdash; it was the autumn
  number of nineteen years ago &mdash; there was again mention of the man; and
  the climb described was the ascent of Mont Blanc from the Brenva Glacier.
  Chayne leaned back in his chair fairly startled by this confirmation. It was
  to the Brenva route that Garratt Skinner had continually harked back. The
  Aiguille Verte, the Grandes Jorasses, the Charmoz, the Blaitière &mdash; yes,
  he had talked of them all, but ever he had come back, with an eager voice and
  a fire in his eyes, to the ice-arête of the Brenva route. Chayne searched on
  through the pages. But there was nowhere in any volume on which he laid his
  hands any further record of his exploits. Others who followed in his steps
  mentioned his name, but of the man himself there was no word more. No one had
  climbed with him, no one had caught a glimpse of him above the snow-line. For
  five or six seasons he had flashed through the Alps. Arolla, Zermatt, the
  Montanvert, the Concordia hut &mdash; all had known him for five or six
  seasons, and then just under twenty years ago he had come no more.</p>

  <p>Chayne put back the volumes in their places on the shelf, and sat down
  again in the arm-chair before the empty grate. It was a strange and a
  haunting story which he was gradually piecing together in his thoughts. Men
  like Gabriel Strood <i>always</i> come back to the Alps. They sleep too
  restlessly at nights, they needs must come. And yet this man had stayed away.
  There must have been some great impediment. He fell into another train of
  thought. Sylvia was eighteen, nearly nineteen. Had Gabriel Strood married
  just after that last season when he climbed from the Brenva Glacier to the
  Calotte. The story was still not unraveled, and while he perplexed his
  fancies over the unraveling, the door opened, and a tall, thin man with a
  pointed beard stood upon the threshold. He was a man of fifty years; his
  shoulders were just learning how to stoop; and his face, fine and delicate,
  yet lacking nothing of strength, wore an aspect of melancholy, as though he
  lived much alone &mdash; until he smiled. And in the smile there was much
  companionship and love. He smiled now as he stretched out his long,
  finely-molded hand.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to see you, Chayne," he said, in a voice remarkable for
  its gentleness, "although in another way I am sorry. I am sorry because, of
  course, I know why you are in England and not among the Alps."</p>

  <p>Chayne had risen from his chair, but Kenyon laid a hand upon his shoulder
  and forced him down again with a friendly pressure. "I read of Lattery's
  death. I am grieved about it &mdash; for you as much as for Lattery. I know
  just what that kind of loss means. It means very much," said he, letting his
  deep-set eyes rest with sympathy upon the face of the younger man. Kenyon put
  a whisky and soda by Chayne's elbow, and setting the tobacco jar on a little
  table between them, sat down and lighted his pipe.</p>

  <p>"You came back at once?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I crossed the Col Dolent and went down into Italy," replied Chayne.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said Kenyon, nodding his head. "But you will go back next
  year, or the year after."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Chayne; and for a little while they smoked their pipes in
  silence. Then Chayne came to the object of his visit.</p>

  <p>"Kenyon," he asked, "have you any photographs of the people who went
  climbing twenty to twenty-five years ago? I thought perhaps you might have
  some groups taken in Switzerland in those days. If you have, I should like to
  see them."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I have," said Kenyon. He went to his writing-desk and
  opening a drawer took out a number of photographs. He brought them back, and
  moving the green-shaded lamp so that the light fell clear and strong upon the
  little table, laid them down.</p>

  <p>Chayne bent over them with a beating heart. Was his suspicion to be
  confirmed or disproved?</p>

  <p>One by one he took the photographs, closely examined them, and laid them
  aside while Kenyon stood upright on the other side of the table. He had
  turned over a dozen before he stopped. He held in his hand the picture of a
  Swiss hotel, with an open space before the door. In the open space men were
  gathered. They were talking in groups; some of them leaned upon ice-axes,
  some carried <i>Rücksacks</i> upon their backs, as though upon the point of
  starting for the hills. As he held the photograph a little nearer to the
  lamp, and bent his head a little lower, Kenyon made a slight uneasy movement.
  But Chayne did not notice. He sat very still, with his eyes fixed upon the
  photograph. On the outskirts of the group stood Sylvia's father. Younger,
  slighter of build, with a face unlined and a boyish grace which had long
  since gone &mdash; but undoubtedly Sylvia's father.</p>

  <p>The contours of the mountains told Chayne clearly enough in what valley
  the hotel stood.</p>

  <p>"This is Zermatt," he said, without lifting his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Kenyon, quietly, "a Zermatt you are too young to know," and
  then Chayne's forefinger dropped upon the figure of Sylvia's father.</p>

  <p>"Who is this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Kenyon made no answer.</p>

  <p>"It is Gabriel Strood," Chayne continued.</p>

  <p>There was a pause, and then Kenyon confirmed the guess.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, and some hint of emotion in his voice made Chayne lift his
  eyes. The light striking upward through the green shade gave to Kenyon's face
  an extraordinary pallor. But it seemed to Chayne that not all the pallor was
  due to the lamp.</p>

  <p>"For six seasons," Chayne said, "Gabriel Strood came to the Alps. In his
  first season he made a great name."</p>

  <p>"He was the best climber I have ever seen," replied Kenyon.</p>

  <p>"He had a passion for the mountains. Yet after six years he came back no
  more. He disappeared. Why?"</p>

  <p>Kenyon stood absolutely silent, absolutely still. Perhaps the trouble
  deepened a little on his face; but that was all. Chayne, however, was bent
  upon an answer. For Sylvia's sake alone he must have it, he must know the
  father into whose clutches she had come.</p>

  <p>"You knew Gabriel Strood. Why?"</p>

  <p>Kenyon leaned forward and gently took the photograph out of Chayne's hand.
  He mixed it with the others, not giving to it a single glance himself, and
  then replaced them all in the drawer from which he had taken them. He came
  back to the table and at last answered Chayne:</p>

  <p>"John Lattery was your friend. Some of the best hours of your life were
  passed in his company. You know that now. But you will know it still more
  surely when you come to my age, whatever happiness may come to you between
  now and then. The camp-fire, the rock-slab for your floor and the black night
  about you for walls, the hours of talk, the ridge and the ice-slope, the bad
  times in storm and mist, the good times in the sunshine, the cold nights of
  hunger when you were caught by the darkness, the off-days when you lounged at
  your ease. You won't forget John Lattery."</p>

  <p>Kenyon spoke very quietly but with a conviction, and, indeed, a certain
  solemnity, which impressed his companion.</p>

  <p>"No," said Chayne, gently, "I shall not forget John Lattery." But his
  question was still unanswered, and by nature he was tenacious. His eyes were
  still upon Kenyon's face and he added: "What then?"</p>

  <p>"Only this," said Kenyon. "Gabriel Strood was my John Lattery," and moving
  round the table he dropped his hand upon Chayne's shoulder. "You will ask me
  no more questions," he said, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said Chayne.</p>

  <p>He had his answer. He knew now that there was something to conceal, that
  there was a definite reason why Gabriel Strood disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," he said; and as he left the room he saw Kenyon sink down
  into his arm-chair. There seemed something sad and very lonely in the
  attitude of the older man. Once more Michel Revailloud's warning rose up
  within his mind.</p>

  <p>"When it is all over, and you go home, take care that there is a lighted
  lamp in the room and the room not empty. Have some one to share your memories
  when life is nothing but memories."</p>

  <p>At every turn the simple philosophy of Michel Revailloud seemed to obtain
  an instance and a confirmation. Was that to be his own fate too? Just for a
  moment he was daunted. He closed the door noiselessly, and going down the
  stairs let himself out into the street. The night was clear above his head.
  How was it above the Downs of Dorsetshire, he wondered. He walked along the
  street very slowly. Garratt Skinner was Gabriel Strood. There was clearly a
  dark reason for the metamorphosis. It remained for Chayne to discover that
  reason. But he did not ponder any more upon that problem to-night. He was
  merely thinking as he walked along the street that Michel Revailloud was a
  very wise man.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16"><small>CHAPTER 16</small></a><br>
  <br>
  AS BETWEEN GENTLEMEN</h2>

  <p class="first">"Between gentlemen," said Wallie Hine. "Yes, between
  gentlemen."</p>

  <p>He was quoting from a letter which he held in his hand, as he sat at the
  breakfast table, and, in his agitation, he had quoted aloud. Garratt Skinner
  looked up from his plate and said:</p>

  <p>"Can I help you, Wallie?"</p>

  <p>Hine flushed red and stammered out: "No, thank you. I must run up to town
  this morning &mdash; that's all."</p>

  <p>"Sylvia will drive you into Weymouth in the dog-cart after breakfast,"
  said Garratt Skinner, and he made no further reference to the journey. But he
  glared at the handwriting of the letter, and then with some perplexity at
  Walter Hine. "You will be back this evening, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Rather," said Walter Hine, with a smile across the table at Sylvia; but
  his agitation got the better of his gallantry, and as she drove him into
  Weymouth, he spoke as piteously as a child appealing for protection. "I don't
  want to go one little bit, Miss Sylvia. But between gentlemen. Yes, I mustn't
  forget that. Between gentlemen." He clung to the phrase, finding some comfort
  in its reiteration.</p>

  <p>"You have given me your promise," said Sylvia. "There will be no cards, no
  bets."</p>

  <p>Walter Hine laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I shan't break it. I have had my lesson. By Jove, I have."</p>

  <p>Walter Hine traveled to Waterloo and drove straight to the office of Mr.
  Jarvice.</p>

  <p>"I owe some money," he began, bleating the words out the moment he was
  ushered into the inner office.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvice grinned.</p>

  <p>"This interview is concluded," he said. "There's the door."</p>

  <p>"I owe it to a friend, Captain Barstow," Hine continued, in desperation.
  "A thousand pounds. He has written for it. He says that debts of honor
  between gentlemen&mdash;" But he got no further, for Mr. Jarvice broke in
  upon his faltering explanations with a snarl of contempt.</p>

  <p>"Barstow! You poor little innocent. I have something else to do with my
  money than to pour it into Barstow's pockets. I know the man. Send him to me
  to- morrow, and I'll talk to him &mdash; as between gentlemen."</p>

  <p>Walter Hine flushed. He had grown accustomed to deference and flatteries
  in the household of Garratt Skinner. The unceremonious scorn of Mr. Jarvice
  stung his vanity, and vanity was the one strong element of his character. He
  was in the mind hotly to defend Captain Barstow from Mr. Jarvice's
  insinuations, but he refrained.</p>

  <p>"Then Barstow will know that I draw my allowance from you, and not from my
  grandfather," he stammered. There was the trouble for Walter Hine. If Barstow
  knew, Garratt Skinner would come to know. There would be an end to the
  deference and the flatteries. He would no longer be able to pose as the
  favorite of the great millionaire, Joseph Hine. He would sink in Sylvia's
  eyes. At the cost of any humiliation that downfall must be avoided.</p>

  <p>His words, however, had an immediate effect upon Mr. Jarvice, though for
  quite other reasons.</p>

  <p>"Why, that's true," said Mr. Jarvice, slowly, and in a voice suddenly
  grown smooth. "Yes, yes, we don't want to mix up my name in the affair at
  all. Sit down, Mr. Hine, and take a cigar. The box is at your elbow. Young
  men of spirit must have some extra license allowed to them for the sake of
  the promise of their riper years. I was forgetting that. No, we don't want my
  name to appear at all, do we?"</p>

  <p>Publicity had no charms for Mr. Jarvice. Indeed, on more than one occasion
  he had found it quite a hindrance to the development of his little plans. To
  go his own quiet way, unheralded by the press and unacclaimed of men &mdash;
  that was the modest ambition of Mr. Jarvice.</p>

  <p>"However, I don't look forward to handing over a thousand pounds to
  Captain Barstow," he continued, softly. "No, indeed. Did you lose any of your
  first quarter's allowance to him besides the thousand?"</p>

  <p>Walter Hine lit his cigar and answered reluctantly:</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"All of it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, no, not all of it."</p>

  <p>Jarvice did not press for the exact amount. He walked to the window and
  stood there with his hands in his pockets and his back toward his visitor.
  Walter Hine watched his shoulders in suspense and apprehension. He would have
  been greatly surprised if he could have caught a glimpse at this moment of
  Mr. Jarvice's face. There was no anger, no contempt, expressed in it at all.
  On the contrary, a quiet smile of satisfaction gave to it almost a merry
  look. Mr. Jarvice had certain plans for Walter Hine's future &mdash; so he
  phrased it with a smile for the grim humor of the phrase &mdash; and fate
  seemed to be helping toward their fulfilment.</p>

  <p>"I can get you out of this scrape, no doubt," said Jarvice, turning back
  to his table. "The means I must think over, but I can do it. Only there's a
  condition. You need not be alarmed. A little condition which a loving father
  might impose upon his only son," and Mr. Jarvice beamed paternally as he
  resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"What is the condition?" asked Walter Hine.</p>

  <p>"That you travel for a year, broaden your mind by visiting the great
  countries and capitals of Europe, take a little trip perhaps into the East
  and return a cultured gentleman well equipped to occupy the high position
  which will be yours when your grandfather is in due time translated to a
  better sphere."</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvice leaned back in his chair, and with a confident wave of his
  desk ruler had the air of producing the startling metamorphosis like some
  heavy but benevolent fairy. Walter Hine, however, was not attracted by the
  prospect.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" he began, and at once Mr. Jarvice interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"I anticipate you," he said, with a smile. "Standing at the window there,
  I foresaw your objection. But &mdash; it would be lonely. Quite true. Why
  should you be lonely? And so I am going to lay my hands on some pleasant and
  companionable young fellow who will go with you for his expenses. An Oxford
  man, eh? Fresh from Alma Mater with a taste for pictures and statuettes and
  that sort of thing! Upon my word, I envy you, Mr. Hine. If I were young,
  bless me, if I wouldn't throw my bonnet over the mill, as after a few weeks
  in La Ville Lumière you will be saying, and go with you. You will taste life
  &mdash; yes, life."</p>

  <p>And as he repeated the word, all the jollity died suddenly out of the face
  of Mr. Jarvice. He bent his eyes somberly upon his visitor and a queer
  inscrutable smile played about his lips. But Walter Hine had no eyes for Mr.
  Jarvice. He was nerving himself to refuse the proposal.</p>

  <p>"I can't go," he blurted out, with the ungracious stubbornness of a weak
  mind which fears to be over-persuaded. Afraid lest he should consent, he
  refused aggressively and rudely.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvice repressed an exclamation of anger. "And why?" he asked,
  leaning forward on his elbows and fixing his bright, sharp eyes on Walter
  Hine's face.</p>

  <p>Walter Hine shifted uncomfortably in his chair but did not answer.</p>

  <p>"And why can't you go?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, surely," said Mr. Jarvice, with a scarcely perceptible sneer. "Come
  now! Between gentlemen! Well?"</p>

  <p>Walter Hine yielded to Jarvice's insistence.</p>

  <p>"There's a girl," he said, with a coy and odious smile.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvice beat upon his desk with his fists in a savage anger. His
  carefully calculated plan was to be thwarted by a girl.</p>

  <p>"She's a dear," cried Walter Hine. Having made the admission, he let
  himself go. His vanity pricked him to lyrical flights. "She's a dear, she's a
  sob, she would never let me go, she's my little girl."</p>

  <p>Such was Sylvia's reward for engaging in a struggle which she loathed for
  the salvation of Walter Hine. She was jubilantly claimed by him as his little
  girl in a money-lender's office. Mr. Jarvice swore aloud.</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" he asked, sternly.</p>

  <p>A faint sense of shame came over Walter Hine. He dimly imagined what
  Sylvia would have thought and said, and what contempt her looks would have
  betrayed, had she heard him thus boast of her goodwill.</p>

  <p>"You are asking too much, Mr. Jarvice," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvice waved the objection aside.</p>

  <p>"Of course I ask it as between gentlemen," he said, with an ironical
  politeness.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, as between gentlemen," returned Walter Hine, seriously. "She
  is the daughter of a great friend of mine, Mr. Garratt Skinner. What's the
  matter?" he cried; and there was reason for his cry.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"

  </div>

  <p>It had been an afternoon of surprises for Mr. Jarvice, but this simple
  mention of the name of Garratt Skinner was more than a surprise. Mr. Jarvice
  was positively startled. He leaned back in his chair with his mouth open and
  his eyes staring at Walter Hine. The high color paled in his face and his
  cheeks grew mottled. It seemed that fear as well as surprise came to him in
  the knowledge that Garratt Skinner was a friend of Walter Hine.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" repeated Hine.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing," replied Mr. Jarvice, hastily. "The heat, that is all." He
  crossed the room, and throwing up the window leaned for a few moments upon
  the sill. Yet even when he spoke again, there was still a certain
  unsteadiness in his voice. "How did you come across Mr. Garratt Skinner?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Barstow introduced me. I made Barstow's acquaintance at the Criterion
  Bar, and he took me to Garratt Skinner's house in Hobart Place."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Mr. Jarvice. "It was in Garratt Skinner's house that you
  lost your money, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but he had no hand in it," exclaimed Walter Hine. "He does not know
  how much I lost. He would be angry if he did."</p>

  <p>A faint smile flickered across Jarvice's face.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," he agreed, and under his deft cross-examination the whole
  story was unfolded. The little dinner at which Sylvia made her appearance and
  at which Walter Hine was carefully primed with drink; the little round game
  of cards which Garratt Skinner was so reluctant to allow in his house on a
  Sunday evening, and from which, being an early riser, he retired to bed,
  leaving Hine in the hands of Captain Barstow and Archie Parminter; the quiet
  secluded house in the country; the new gardener who appeared for one day and
  shot with so surprising an accuracy, when Barstow backed him against Walter
  Hine, that Hine lost a thousand pounds; the incidents were related to Mr.
  Jarvice in their proper succession, and he interpreted them by his own
  experience. Captain Barstow, who was always to the fore, counted for nothing
  in the story as Jarvice understood it. He was the mere creature, the servant.
  Garratt Skinner, who was always in the background, prepared the swindle and
  pocketed the profits.</p>

  <p>"You are staying at the quiet house in Dorsetshire now, I suppose. Just
  you and Garratt Skinner and the pretty daughter, with occasional visits from
  Barstow?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Hine. "Garratt Skinner does not care to see much
  company."</p>

  <p>Once more the smile of amusement played upon Mr. Jarvice's face.</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not," he said, quietly. There were certain definite reasons
  of which he was aware, to account for Garratt Skinner's reluctance to appear
  in a general company. He turned back from the window and returned to his
  table. He had taken his part. There was no longer either unsteadiness or
  anger in his voice.</p>

  <p>"I quite understand your reluctance to leave your new friends," he said,
  with the utmost friendliness. "I recognize that the tour abroad on which I
  had rather set my heart must be abandoned. But I have no regrets. For I think
  it possible that the very object which I had in mind when proposing that tour
  may be quite as easily effected in the charming country house of Garratt
  Skinner."</p>

  <p>He spoke in a quiet matter-of-fact voice, looking benevolently at his
  visitor. If the words were capable of another and a more sinister meaning
  than they appeared to convey, Walter Hine did not suspect it. He took them in
  their obvious sense.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I shall gain as much culture in Garratt Skinner's house as I should
  by seeing picture-galleries abroad," he said eagerly, and then Mr. Jarvice
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"I think that very likely," he said. "Meanwhile, as to Barstow and his
  thousand pounds. I must think the matter over. Barstow will not press you for
  a day or two. Just leave me your address &mdash; the address in
  Dorsetshire."</p>

  <p>He dipped a pen in the ink and handed it to Hine. Hine took it and drew a
  sheet of paper toward him. But he did not set the pen to the paper. He looked
  suddenly up at Jarvice, who stood over against him at the other side of the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Garratt Skinner's address?" he said, with one of his flashes of
  cunning.</p>

  <p>"Yes, since you are staying there. I shall want to write to you."</p>

  <p>Walter Hine still hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You won't peach to Garratt Skinner about the allowance, eh?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow!" said Mr. Jarvice. He was more hurt than offended. "To
  put it on the lowest ground, what could I gain?"</p>

  <p>Walter Hine wrote down the address, and at once the clerk appeared at the
  door and handed Jarvice a card.</p>

  <p>"I will see him," said Jarvice, and turning to Hine: "Our business is
  over, I think."</p>

  <p>Jarvice opened a second door which led from the inner office straight down
  a little staircase into the street. "Good-by. You shall hear from me," he
  said, and Walter Hine went out.</p>

  <p>Jarvice closed the door and turned back to his clerk.</p>

  <p>"That will do," he said.</p>

  <p>There was no client waiting at all. Mr. Jarvice had an ingenious
  contrivance for getting rid of his clients at the critical moment after they
  had come to a decision and before they had time to change their minds. By
  pressing a particular button in the leather covering of the right arm of his
  chair, he moved an indicator above the desk of his clerk in the outer office.
  The clerk thereupon announced a visitor, and the one in occupation was bowed
  out by the private staircase. By this method Walter Hine had been
  dismissed.</p>

  <p>Jarvice had the address of Garratt Skinner. But he sat with it in front of
  him upon his desk for a long time before he could bring himself to use it.
  All the amiability had gone from his expression now that he was alone. He was
  in a savage mood, and every now and then a violent gesture betrayed it. But
  it was with himself that he was angry. He had been a fool not to keep a
  closer watch on Walter Hine.</p>

  <p>"I might have foreseen," he cried in his exasperation. "Garratt Skinner!
  If I had not been an ass, I <i>should</i> have foreseen."</p>

  <p>For Mr. Jarvice was no stranger to Walter Hine's new friend. More than one
  young buck fresh from the provinces, heir to the great factory or the great
  estate, had been steered into this inner office by the careful pilotage of
  Garratt Skinner. In all the army of the men who live by their wits, there was
  not one to Jarvice's knowledge who was so alert as Garratt Skinner to lay
  hands upon the new victim or so successful in lulling his suspicions. He
  might have foreseen that Garratt Skinner would throw his net over Walter
  Hine. But he had not, and the harm was done.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvice took the insurance policy from his safe and shook his head
  over it sadly. He had seen his way to making in his quiet fashion, and at
  comparatively little cost, a tidy little sum of one hundred thousand pounds.
  Now he must take a partner, so that he might not have an enemy. Garratt
  Skinner with Barstow for his jackal and the pretty daughter for his decoy was
  too powerful a factor to be lightly regarded. Jarvice must share with Garratt
  Skinner &mdash; unless he preferred to abandon his scheme altogether; and
  that Mr. Jarvice would not do.</p>

  <p>There was no other way. Jarvice knew well that he could weaken Garratt
  Skinner's influence over Walter Hine by revealing to the youth certain
  episodes in the new friend's life. He might even break the acquaintanceship
  altogether. But Garratt Skinner would surely discover who had been at work.
  And then? Why, then, Mr. Jarvice would have upon his heels a shrewd and
  watchful enemy; and in this particular business, such an enemy Mr. Jarvice
  could not afford to have. Jarvice was not an impressionable man, but his
  hands grew cold while he imagined Garratt Skinner watching the development of
  his little scheme &mdash; the tour abroad with the pleasant companion, the
  things which were to happen on the tour &mdash; watching and waiting until
  the fitting moment had come, when all was over, for him to step in and demand
  the price of his silence and hold Mr. Jarvice in the hollow of his hand for
  all his life. No, that would never do. Garratt Skinner must be a partner so
  that also he might be an accessory.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, Jarvice wrote his letter to Garratt Skinner, a few lines
  urging him to come to London on most important business. Never was there a
  letter more innocent in its appearance than that which Jarvice wrote in his
  inner office on that summer afternoon. Yet even at the last he hesitated
  whether he should seal it up or no. The sun went down, shadows touched with
  long cool fingers the burning streets; shadows entered into that little inner
  office of Mr. Jarvice. But still he sat undecided at his desk.</p>

  <p>The tour upon the Continent must be abandoned, and with it the journey
  under canvas to the near East &mdash; a scheme so simple, so sure, so safe.
  Still Garratt Skinner might confidently be left to devise another. And he had
  always kept faith. To that comforting thought Mr. Jarvice clung. He sealed up
  his letter in the end, and stood for a moment or two with the darkness
  deepening about him. Then he rang for his clerk and bade him post it, but the
  voice he used was one which the clerk did not know, so that he pushed his
  head forward and peered through the shadows to make sure that it was his
  master who spoke.</p>

  <p>Two days afterward Garratt Skinner paid a long visit to Mr. Jarvice, and
  that some agreement was reached between the two men shortly became evident.
  For Walter Hine received a letter from Captain Barstow which greatly relieved
  him.</p>

  <p>"Garratt Skinner has written to me," wrote the 'red-hot' Captain, "that he
  has discovered that the gardener, whom he engaged for a particular job, is
  notorious as a poacher and a first-class shot. Under these circumstances, my
  dear old fellow, the red-hot one cannot pouch your pennies. As between
  gentlemen, the bet must be considered o-p-h."</p>

  <br>
  SYLVIA TELLS MORE THAN SHE KNOWS</h2>

  <p class="first">Hilary Chayne stayed away from Dorsetshire for ten complete
  days; and though the hours crept by, dilatory as idlers at a street corner,
  he obtained some poor compensation by reflecting upon his fine diplomacy. In
  less than a week he would surely be missed; by the time that ten days had
  passed the sensation might have become simply poignant. So for ten days he
  wandered about the Downs of Sussex with an aching heart, saying the while,
  "It serves her right." On the morning of the eleventh he received a letter
  from the War Office, bidding him call on the following afternoon.</p>

  <p>"That will just do," he said. "I will go down to Weymouth to-day, and I
  will return to London to-morrow." And with an unusual lightness of spirit,
  which he ascribed purely to his satisfaction that he need punish Sylvia no
  longer, he started off upon his long journey. He reached the house of the
  Running Water by six o'clock in the evening; and at the outset it seemed that
  his diplomacy had been sagacious.</p>

  <p>He was shown into the library, and opposite to him by the window Sylvia
  stood alone. She turned to him a white terror-haunted face, gazed at him for
  a second like one dazed, and then with a low cry of welcome came quickly
  toward him. Chayne caught her outstretched hands and all his joy at her
  welcome lay dead at the sight of her distress. "Sylvia!" he exclaimed in
  distress. He was hurt by it as he had never thought to be hurt.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid!" she said, in a trembling whisper. He drew her toward him
  and she yielded. She stood close to him and very still, touching him, leaning
  to him like a frightened child. "Oh, I am afraid," she repeated; and her
  voice appealed piteously for sympathy and a little kindness.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"
     name="pic6"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300121h-images/RunningWater6.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>In Chayne's mind there was suddenly painted a picture of the ice-slope on
  the Aiguille d'Argentière. A girl had moved from step to step, across that
  slope, looking down its steep glittering incline without a tremor. It was the
  same girl who now leaned to him and with shaking lips and eyes tortured with
  fear cried, "I am afraid." By his recollection of that day upon the heights
  Chayne measured the greatness of her present trouble.</p>

  <p>"Why, Sylvia? Why are you afraid?"</p>

  <p>For answer she looked toward the open window. Chayne followed her glance
  and this was what he saw: The level stretch of emerald lawn, the stream
  running through it and catching in its brown water the red light of the
  evening sun, the great beech trees casting their broad shadows, the high
  garden walls with the dusky red of their bricks glowing amongst fruit trees,
  and within that enclosure pacing up and down, in and out among the shadows of
  the trees, Garratt Skinner and Walter Hine. Yet that sight she must needs
  have seen before. Why should it terrify her beyond reason now?</p>

  <p>"Do you see?" Sylvia said in a low troubled voice. For once distress had
  mastered her and she spoke without her usual reticence. "There can be no
  friendship between those two. No real friendship! You have but to see them
  side by side to be sure of it. It is pretence."</p>

  <p>Yet that too she must have known before. Why then should the pretence now
  so greatly trouble her? Chayne watched the two men pacing in the garden.
  Certainly he had never seen them in so intimate a comradeship. Garratt
  Skinner had passed his arm through Walter Hine's and held him so, plying him
  with stories, bending down his keen furrowed aquiline face toward him as
  though he had no thought in the world but to make him his friend and bind him
  with affection; and Walter Hine looked up and listened and laughed, a vain,
  weak wisp of a creature, flattered to the skies and defenceless as a
  rabbit.</p>

  <p>"Why the pretence?" said Sylvia. "Why the linked arms? The pretence has
  grown during these last days. What new thing is intended?" Her eyes were on
  the garden, and as she looked it seemed that her terror grew. "My father went
  away a week ago. Since he has returned the pretence has increased. I am
  afraid! I am afraid!"</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner turned in his walk and led Walter Hine back toward the
  house. Sylvia shrank from his approach as from something devilish. When he
  turned again, she drew her breath like one escaped from sudden peril.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia! Of what are you afraid?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know!" she cried. "That's just the trouble. I don't know!" She
  clenched her hands together at her breast. Chayne caught them in his and was
  aware that in one shut palm she held something which she concealed. Her clasp
  tightened upon it as his hands touched hers. Sylvia had more reason for her
  fears than she had disclosed. Barstow came no more. There were no more cards,
  no more bets; and this change taken together with Garratt Skinner's increased
  friendship added to her apprehensions. She dreaded some new plot more
  sinister, more terrible than that one of which she was aware.</p>

  <p>"If only I knew," she cried. "Oh, if only I knew!"</p>

  <p>Archie Parminter had paid one visit to the house, had stayed for one
  night; and he and Garratt Skinner and Walter Hine had sat up till morning,
  talking together in the library. Sylvia waking up from a fitful sleep, had
  heard their voices again and again through the dark hours; and when the dawn
  was gray, she had heard them coming up to bed as on the first night of her
  return; and as on that night there was one who stumbled heavily. It was since
  that night that terror had distracted her.</p>

  <p>"I have no longer any power," she said. "Something has happened to destroy
  my power. I have no longer any influence. Something was done upon that
  night," and she shivered as though she guessed; and she looked at her
  clenched hand as though the clue lay hidden in its palm. There lay her great
  trouble. She had lost her influence over Walter Hine. She had knowledge of
  the under side of life &mdash; yes, but her father had a greater knowledge
  still. He had used his greater knowledge. Craftily and with a most ingenious
  subtlety he had destroyed her power, he had blunted her weapons. Hine was
  attracted by Sylvia, fascinated by her charm, her looks, and the gentle
  simplicity of her manner. Very well. On the other side Garratt Skinner had
  held out a lure of greater attractions, greater fascination; and Sylvia was
  powerless.</p>

  <p>"He has changed," Sylvia went on, with her eyes fixed on Walter Hine. "Oh,
  not merely toward me. He has changed physically. Can you understand? He has
  grown nervous, restless, excitable, a thing of twitching limbs. Oh, and
  that's not all. I will tell you. This morning it seemed to me that the color
  of his eyes had changed."</p>

  <p>Chayne stared at her. "Sylvia!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I have not lost my senses," she answered, and she resumed: "I only
  noticed that there was an alteration at first. I did not see in what the
  alteration lay. Then I saw. His eyes used to be light in color. This morning
  they were dark. I looked carefully to make sure, and so I understood. The
  pupils of his eyes were so dilated that they covered the whole eyeball. Can
  you think why?" and even as she asked, she looked at that clenched hand of
  hers as though the answer to that question as well lay hidden there. "I am
  afraid," she said once more; and upon that Chayne committed the worst of the
  many indiscretions which had signalized his courtship.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid? Sylvia! Then let me take you away!"</p>

  <p>At once Sylvia drew back. Had Chayne not spoken, she would have told him
  all that there was to tell. She was in the mood at this unguarded moment. She
  would have told him that during these last days Walter Hine had taken to
  drink once more. She would have opened that clenched fist and showed the
  thing it hid, even though the thing condemned her father beyond all hope of
  exculpation. But Chayne had checked her as surely as though he had laid the
  palm of his hand upon her lips. He would talk of love and flight, and of
  neither had she any wish to hear. She craved with a great yearning for
  sympathy and a little kindness. But Chayne was not content to offer what she
  needed. He would add more, and what he added marred the whole gift for
  Sylvia. She shook her head, and looking at him with a sad and gentle smile,
  said:</p>

  <p>"Love is for the happy people."</p>

  <p>"That is a hard saying, Sylvia," Chayne returned, "and not a true
  one."</p>

  <p>"True to me," said Sylvia, with a deep conviction, and as he advanced to
  her she raised her hand to keep him off. "No, no," she cried, and had he
  listened, he might have heard a hint of exasperation in her voice. But he
  would not be warned.</p>

  <p>"You can't go on, living here, without sympathy, without love, without
  even kindness. Already it is evident. You are ill, and tired. And you think
  to go on all your life or all your father's life. Sylvia, let me take you
  away!"</p>

  <p>And each unwise word set him further and further from his aim. It seemed
  to her that there was no help anywhere. Chayne in front of her seemed to her
  almost as much her enemy as her father, who paced the lawn behind her arm in
  arm with Walter Hine. She clasped her hands together with a quick sharp
  movement.</p>

  <p>"I will not let you take me away," she cried. "For I do not love you"; and
  her voice had lost its gentleness and grown cold and hard. Chayne began
  again, but whether it was with a renewal of his plea, she did not hear. For
  she broke in upon him quickly:</p>

  <p>"Please, let me finish. I am, as you said, a little over-wrought! Just
  hear me out and leave me to bear my troubles by myself. You will make it
  easier for me"; she saw that the words hurt her lover. But she did not modify
  them. She was in the mood to hurt. She had been betrayed by her need of
  sympathy into speaking words which she would gladly have recalled; she had
  been caught off her guard and almost unawares; and she resented it. Chayne
  had told her that she looked ill and tired; and she resented that too. No
  wonder she looked tired when she had her father with his secret treacheries
  on one side and an importunate lover upon the other! She thought for a moment
  or two how best to put what she had still to stay:</p>

  <p>"I have probably said to you," she resumed, "more than was right or fair
  &mdash; I mean fair to my father. I have no doubt exaggerated things. I want
  you to forget what I have said. For it led you into a mistake."</p>

  <p>Chayne looked at her in perplexity.</p>

  <p>"A mistake?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. She was standing in front of him with her forehead
  wrinkled and a somber, angry look in her eyes. "A mistake which I must
  correct. You said that I was living here without kindness. It is not true. My
  father is kind!" And as Chayne raised his eyes in a mute protest, she
  insisted on the word. "Yes, kind and thoughtful &mdash; thoughtful for others
  besides myself." A kind of obstinacy forced her on to enlarge upon the topic.
  "I can give you an instance which will surprise you."</p>

  <p>"There is no need," Chayne said, gently, but Sylvia was implacable.</p>

  <p>"But there is need," she returned. "I beg you to hear me. When my father
  and I were at Weymouth we drove one afternoon across the neck of the Chesil
  beach to Portland."</p>

  <p>Chayne looked at Sylvia quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he said, and there was an indefinable change in his voice. He had
  consented to listen, because she wished it. Now he listened with a keen
  attention. For a strange thought had crept into his mind.</p>

  <p>"We drove up the hill toward the plateau at the top of the island, but as
  we passed through the village &mdash; Fortune's Well I think they call it
  &mdash; my father stopped the carriage at a tobacconist's, and went into the
  shop. He came out again with some plugs of tobacco &mdash; a good many
  &mdash; and got into the carriage. You won't guess why he bought them. I
  didn't."</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Chayne, and now he spoke with suspense. Suspense, too, was
  visible in his quiet attitude. There was a mystery which for Sylvia's sake he
  wished to unravel. Why did Gabriel Strood now call himself Garratt Skinner?
  That was the mystery. But he must unravel it without doing any hurt to
  Sylvia. He could not go too warily &mdash; of that he had been sure, ever
  since Kenyon had refused to speak of it. There might be some hidden thing
  which for Sylvia's sake must not be brought to light. Therefore he must find
  out the truth without help from any one. He wondered whether unconsciously
  Sylvia herself was going to give him the clue. Was she to tell him what she
  did not know herself &mdash; why Gabriel Strood was now Garratt Skinner?
  "Well?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"As we continued up the hill," she resumed, "my father cut up the tobacco
  into small pieces with his pocket knife. 'Why are you doing that?' I asked,
  and he laughed and said, 'Wait, you will see.' At the top of the hill we got
  out of the carriage and walked across the open plateau. In front of us,
  rising high above a little village, stood out a hideous white building. My
  father asked if I knew what it was. I said I guessed."</p>

  <p>"It was the prison," Chayne interrupted, quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You went to it?"</p>

  <p>Upon the answer to the question depended whether or no Chayne was to
  unravel his mystery, to-day.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Sylvia, and Chayne drew a breath. Had she answered "Yes,"
  the suspicion which had formed within his mind must needs be set aside, as
  clearly and finally disproved. Since she answered "No," the suspicion
  gathered strength. "We went, however, near to it. We went as close to it as
  the quarries. It was five o'clock in the afternoon, and as we came to the
  corner of the wall which surrounds the quarries, my father said, 'They have
  stopped work now.'"</p>

  <p>"He knew that?" asked Chayne.</p>

  <p>"Yes. We turned into a street which runs down toward the prison. On one
  side are small houses, on the other the long wall of the Government quarries.
  The street was empty; only now and then &mdash; very seldom &mdash; some one
  passed along it. On the top of the wall, there were sentry-boxes built at
  intervals, for the warders to overlook the convicts. But these were empty
  too. The wall is not high; I suppose &mdash; in fact my father said &mdash;
  the quarry was deep on the other side."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Chayne, quietly. "And then?"</p>

  <p>"Then we walked slowly along the street, and whenever there was no one
  near, my father threw some tobacco over the wall. 'I don't suppose they have
  a very enjoyable time,' he said. 'They will be glad to find the tobacco there
  to- morrow.' We walked up the street and turned and came back, and when we
  reached the corner he said with a laugh, 'That's all, Sylvia. My pockets are
  empty.' We walked back to the carriage and drove home again to Weymouth."</p>

  <p>Sylvia had finished her story, and the mystery was clear to Chayne. She
  had told him the secret which she did not know herself. He was sure now why
  Gabriel Strood had changed his name; he knew now why Gabriel Strood no longer
  climbed the Alps; and why Kenyon would answer no question as to the
  disappearance of his friend.</p>

  <p>"I have told you this," said Sylvia, "because you accused my father of
  unkindness and want of thought. Would you have thought of those poor
  prisoners over there in the quarries? If you had, would you have taken so
  much trouble just to give them a small luxury? I think they must have blessed
  the unknown man who thought for them and showed them what so many want
  &mdash; a little sympathy and a little kindness."</p>

  <p>Chayne bowed his head.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, gently. "I was unjust."</p>

  <p>Indeed even to himself he acknowledged that Garratt Skinner had shown an
  unexpected kindness, although he was sure of the reason for the act. He had
  no doubt that Garratt Skinner had labored in those quarries himself, and
  perhaps had himself picked up in bygone days, as he stooped over his work,
  tobacco thrown over the walls by some more fortunate man.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you acknowledge that," said Sylvia, but her voice did not
  relent from its hostility. She stood without further word, expecting him to
  take his leave. Chayne recollected with how hopeful a spirit he had traveled
  down from London. His fine diplomacy had after all availed him little. He had
  gained certainly some unexpected knowledge which convinced him still more
  thoroughly that the sooner he took Sylvia away from her father and his
  friends the better it would be. But he was no nearer to his desire. It might
  be that he was further off than ever.</p>

  <p>"You are returning to London?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have to call at the War Office to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Sylvia had no curiosity as to that visit. She took no interest in it
  whatever, he noticed with a pang.</p>

  <p>"And then?" she asked slowly, as she crossed the hall with him to the
  door. "You will go home?"</p>

  <p>Chayne smiled rather bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose so."</p>

  <p>"Into Sussex?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>She opened the door, and as he came out on to the steps she looked at him
  with a thoughtful scrutiny for a few moments. But whether her thoughts
  portended good or ill for him, he could not tell.</p>

  <p>"When I was a boy," he said abruptly, "I used to see from the garden of my
  house, far away in a dip of the downs, a dark high wall standing up against
  the sky. I never troubled myself as to how it came to have been built there.
  But I used to wonder, being a boy, whether it could be scaled or no. One
  afternoon I rode my pony over to find out, and I discovered &mdash; What do
  you think? &mdash; that my wall was a mere hedge just three feet high, no
  more."</p>

  <p>"Well!" said Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have not forgotten &mdash; that's all," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Good-by," she said, and he learned no more from her voice than he had
  done from her looks. He walked away down the lane, and having gone a few
  yards he looked back. Sylvia was still standing in the doorway, watching him
  with grave and thoughtful eyes. But there was no invitation to him to return,
  and turning away again he walked on.</p>

  <p>Sylvia went up-stairs to her room. She unclenched her hand at last. In its
  palm there lay a little phial containing a colorless solution. But there was
  a label upon the phial, and on the label was written "cocaine." It was that
  which had struck at her influence over Walter Hine. It was to introduce this
  drug that Archie Parminter had been brought down from London and the West End
  clubs.</p>

  <p>"It's drunk a good deal in a quiet way," Archie had said, as he made a
  pretence himself to drink it.</p>

  <p>"You leave such drugs to the aristocracy, Walter," Garratt Skinner had
  chimed in. "Just a taste if you like. But go gently."</p>

  <p>Sylvia had not been present. But she conjectured the scene, and her
  conjecture was not far from the truth. But why? she asked, and again fear
  took hold of her. "What was to be gained?" There were limits to Sylvia's
  knowledge of the under side of life. She did not guess.</p>

  <p>She turned to her mirror and looked at herself. Yes, she looked tired, she
  looked ill. But she was not grateful for having the fact pointed out to her.
  And while she still looked, she heard her father's voice calling her. She
  shivered, as though her fear once more laid hold on her. Then she locked the
  bottle of cocaine away in a drawer and ran lightly down the stairs.</p>

     id="chap18"><small>CHAPTER 18</small></a><br>
  <br>
  BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION</h2>

  <p class="first">Chayne's house stood high upon a slope of the Sussex Downs.
  Built of stone two centuries ago, it seemed gradually to have taken on the
  brown color of the hill behind it, subduing itself to the general scheme,
  even as birds and animals will do; so that strangers who searched for it in
  the valley discovered it by the upward swirl of smoke from its wide chimneys.
  On its western side and just beneath the house, there was a cleft in the
  downs through which the high road ran and in the cleft the houses of a tiny
  village clustered even as at the foot of some old castle in Picardy. On the
  east the great ridge with its shadow- holding hollows, its rounded
  gorse-strewn slopes of grass, rolled away for ten miles and then dipped
  suddenly to the banks of the River Arun. The house faced the south, and from
  its high-terraced garden, a great stretch of park and forest land was
  visible, where amidst the green and russet of elm and beach, a cluster of
  yews set here and there gave the illusion of a black and empty space. Beyond
  the forest land a lower ridge of hills rose up, and over that ridge one saw
  the spires of Chichester and the level flats of Selsea reaching to the
  sea.</p>

  <p>Into this garden Chayne came on the next afternoon, and as he walked along
  its paths alone he could almost fancy that his dead father paced with the
  help of his stick at his side, talking, as had been his wont, of this or that
  improvement needed by the farms, pointing out to him a meadow in the hollow
  beneath which might soon be coming into the market, and always ending up with
  the same plea.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it time, Hilary, that you married and came home to look after it
  all yourself?"</p>

  <p>Chayne had turned a deaf ear to that plea, but it made its appeal to him
  to-night. Wherever his eyes rested, he recaptured something of his boyhood;
  the country-side was alive with memories. He looked south, and remembered how
  the perished cities of history had acquired reality for him by taking on the
  aspect of Chichester lying low there on the flats; and how the spires of the
  fabled towns of his storybooks had caught the light of the setting sun, just
  as did now the towers of the cathedral. Eastward, in the dip between the
  shoulder of the downs, and the trees of Arundel Park, a long black hedge
  stood out with a remarkable definition against the sky &mdash; the hedge of
  which he had spoken to Sylvia &mdash; the great dark wall of brambles
  guarding the precincts of the Sleeping Beauty. He recalled the adventurous
  day when he had first ridden alone upon his pony along the great back of the
  downs and had come down to it through a sylvan country of silence and ferns
  and open spaces; and had discovered it to be no more than a hedge waist-high.
  The dusk came upon him as he loitered in that solitary garden; the lights
  shone out in cottage and farm-house; and more closely still his memories
  crowded about him weaving spells. Some one to share them with! Chayne had no
  need to wait for old age before he learnt the wisdom of Michel Revailloud.
  For his heart leaped now, as he dreamed of exploring once more with Sylvia at
  his side the enchanted country of his boyhood; gallops in the quiet summer
  mornings along that still visible track across the downs, by which the Roman
  legions had marched in the old days from London straight as a die to
  Chichester; winter days with the hounds; a rush on windy afternoons in a
  sloop-rigged boat down the Arun to Littlehampton. Chayne's heart leaped with
  a passionate longing as he dreamed, and sank as he turned again to the blank
  windows of the empty house.</p>

  <p>He dined alone, and while he dined evoked Sylvia's presence at the table,
  setting her, not at the far end, but at the side and close, so that a hand
  might now and then touch hers; calling up into her face her slow hesitating
  smile; seeing her still gray eyes grow tender; in a word watching the Madonna
  change into the woman. He went into the library where, since the night had
  grown chilly, a fire was lit. It was a place of comfort, with high
  bookshelves, deep-cushioned chairs, and dark curtains. But, no less than the
  dining-room it needed another presence, and lacking that lacked everything.
  It needed the girl with the tired and terror-haunted face. Here, surely the
  fear would die out of her soul, the eyes would lose their shadows, the feet
  regain the lightness of their step.</p>

  <p>Chayne took down his favorite books, but they failed him. Between the
  pages and his eyes one face would shape itself. He looked into the fire and
  sought as of old to picture in the flames some mountain on which his hopes
  were set and to discover the right line for its ascent. But even that pastime
  brought no solace for his discontent. The house oppressed him. It was empty,
  it was silent. He drew aside the curtains and looking down into the valley
  through the clear night air watched the lights in cottage and farm with the
  envy born of his loneliness.</p>

  <p>In spite of the brave words he had used, he wondered to-night whether the
  three-foot hedge was not after all to prove the unassailable wall. And it was
  important that he should know. For if it were so, why then he had not called
  at the War Office in vain. A proposal had been made to him &mdash; that he
  should join a commission for the delimitation of a distant frontier. A year's
  work and an immediate departure &mdash; those were the conditions. Within two
  days he must make up his mind &mdash; within ten days he must leave
  England.</p>

  <p>Chayne pondered over the decision which he must make. If he had lost
  Sylvia, here was the mission to accept. For it meant complete severance, a
  separation not to be measured by miles alone, but by the nature of the work,
  and the comrades, and even the character of the vegetation. He went to bed in
  doubt, thinking that the morning might bring him counsel. It brought him a
  letter from Sylvia instead.</p>

  <p>The letter was long; it was written in haste, it was written in great
  distress, so that words which were rather unkind were written down. But the
  message of the letter was clear. Chayne was not to come again to the House of
  the Running Water; nor to the little house in London when she returned to it.
  They were not to meet again. She did not wish for it.</p>

  <p>Chayne burnt the letter as soon as he had read it, taking no offence at
  the hasty words. "I seem to have worried her more than I thought," he said to
  himself with a wistful smile. "I am sorry," and again as the sparks died out
  from the black ashes of the letter he repeated: "Poor little girl. I am very
  sorry."</p>

  <p>So the house would always be silent and empty.</p>

  <p>Sylvia had written the letter in haste on the very evening of Chayne's
  visit, and had hurried out to post it in fear lest she might change her mind
  in the morning. But in the morning she was only aware of a great lightness of
  spirit. She could now devote herself to the work of her life; and for two
  long tiring days she kept Walter Hine at her side. But now he sought to avoid
  her. The little energy he had ever had was gone, he alternated between
  exhilaration and depression; he preferred, it seemed, to be alone. For two
  days, however, Sylvia persevered, and on the third her lightness of spirit
  unaccountably deserted her.</p>

  <p>She drove with Walter Hine that morning, and something of his own
  irritability seemed to have passed into her; so that he turned to her and
  asked:</p>

  <p>"What have I done? Aren't you pleased with me? Why are you angry?"</p>

  <p>"I am not angry," she replied, turning her great gray eyes upon him. "But
  if you wish to know, I miss something."</p>

  <p>So much she owned. She missed something, and she knew very well what it
  was that she missed. Even as Chayne in his Sussex home had ached to know that
  the house lacked a particular presence, so it began to be with Sylvia in
  Dorsetshire.</p>

  <p>"Yet he has been absent for a longer time," she argued with herself, "and
  I have not missed him. Indeed, I have been glad of his absence." And the
  answer came quickly from her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"At any time you could have called him to your side, and you knew it. Now
  you have sent him away for always."</p>

  <p>During the week the sense of loss, the feeling that everything was
  unbearably incomplete, grew stronger and stronger within her. She had no
  heart for the losing battle in which she was engaged. A dangerous question
  began to force itself forward in her mind whenever her eyes rested upon
  Walter Hine. "Was he worth while?" she asked herself: though as yet she did
  not define all that the "while" connoted. The question was most prominent in
  her mind on the seventh day after the letter had been sent. She had persuaded
  Walter Hine to mount with her on to the down behind the house; they came to
  the great White Horse, and Hine, pleading fatigue, a plea which during these
  last days had been ever on his lips, flung himself down upon the grass. For a
  little time Sylvia sat idly watching the great battle ships at
  firing-practice in the Bay. It was an afternoon of August; a light haze hung
  in the still air softening the distant promontories; and on the waveless
  sparkling sea the great ships, coal- black to the eye, circled about the
  targets, with now and then a roar of thunder and a puff of smoke, like some
  monstrous engines of heat &mdash; heat stifling and oppressive. By sheer
  contrast, Sylvia began to dream of the cool glaciers; and the Chalet de
  Lognan suddenly stood visible before her eyes. She watched the sunlight die
  off the red rocks of the Chardonnet, the evening come with silent feet across
  the snow, and the starlit night follow close upon its heels; night fled as
  she dreamed. She saw the ice-slope on the Aiguille d'Argentière, she could
  almost hear the chip-chip of the axes as the steps were cut and the perpetual
  hiss as the ice-fragments streamed down the slope. Then she looked toward
  Walter Hine with the speculative inquiry which had come so often into her
  eyes of late. And as she looked, she saw him furtively take from a pocket a
  tabloid or capsule and slip it secretly into his mouth.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been taking cocaine?" she asked, suddenly.</p>

  <p>Walter Hine flushed scarlet and turned to her with a shrinking look.</p>

  <p>"I don't," he stammered.</p>

  <p>"Yet you left a bottle of the drug where I found it."</p>

  <p>"That was not mine," said he, still more confused. "That was Archie
  Parminter's. He left it behind."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Sylvia, finding here a suspicion confirmed. "But he left it
  for you?"</p>

  <p>"And if I did take it," said Hine, turning irritably to her, "what can it
  matter to you? I believe that what your father says is true."</p>

  <p>"What does he say?"</p>

  <p>"That you care for Captain Chayne, and that it's no use for any one else
  to think of you."</p>

  <p>Sylvia started.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he says that!"</p>

  <p>She understood now one of the methods of the new intrigue. Sylvia was in
  love with Chayne; therefore Walter Hine may console himself with cocaine. It
  was not Garratt Skinner who suggested it. Oh, no! But Archie Parminter is
  invited for the night, takes the drug himself, or pretends to take it,
  praises it, describes how the use of it has grown in the West End and amongst
  the clubs, and then conveniently leaves the drug behind, and no doubt
  supplies it as it is required.</p>

  <p>Sylvia began to dilate upon its ill-effects, and suddenly broke off. A
  great disgust was within her and stopped her speech. She got to her feet.
  "Let us go home," she said, and she went very quickly down the hill. When she
  came to the house she ran up-stairs to her room, locked the door and flung
  herself upon her bed. Walter Hine, her father, their plots and intrigues,
  were swept clean from her mind as of no account. Her struggle for the mastery
  became unimportant in her thoughts &mdash; a folly, a waste. For what her
  father had said was true; she cared for Chayne. And what she herself had said
  to Chayne when first he came to the House of the Running Water was no less
  true. "If I loved, I think nothing else would count at all except that I
  loved."</p>

  <p>She had judged herself aright. She knew that, as she lay prone upon her
  bed, plunged in misery, while the birds called upon the boughs in the garden
  and the mill stream filled the room with its leaping music. In a few minutes
  a servant knocked upon the door and told her that tea was ready in the
  library; but she returned no answer. And in a few minutes more &mdash; or so
  it seemed, but meanwhile the dusk had come &mdash; there came another knock
  and she was told that dinner had been served. But to that message again she
  returned no answer. The noises of the busy day ceased in the fields, the
  birds were hushed upon the branches, quiet and darkness took and refreshed
  the world. Only the throbbing music of the stream beat upon the ears, and
  beat with a louder significance, since all else was still. Sylvia lay staring
  wide-eyed into the darkness. To the murmur of this music, in perhaps this
  very room, she had been born. "Why," she asked piteously, "why?" Of what use
  was it that she must suffer?</p>

  <p>Of all the bad hours of her life, these were the worst. For the yearning
  for happiness and love throbbed and cried at her heart, louder and louder,
  just as the music of the stream swelled to importance with the coming of the
  night. And she learned that she had had both love and happiness within her
  grasp and that she had thrown them away for a shadow. She thought of the
  letter which she had written, recalling its phrases with a sinking heart.</p>

  <p>"No man could forgive them. I must have been mad," she said, and she
  huddled herself upon her bed and wept aloud.</p>

  <p>She ran over in her mind the conversations which she and Hilary Chayne had
  exchanged, and each recollection accused her of impatience and paid a tribute
  to his gentleness. On the very first day he had asked her to go with him and
  her heart cried out now:</p>

  <p>"Why didn't I go?"</p>

  <p>He had been faithful and loyal ever since, and she had called his
  faithfulness importunity and his loyalty a humiliation. She struck a match
  and looked at her watch and by habit wound it up. And she drearily wondered
  on how many, many nights she would have to wind it up and speculate in
  ignorance what he, her lover, was doing and in what corner of the world,
  before the end of her days was reached. What would become of her? she asked.
  And she raised the corner of a curtain and glanced at the bright picture of
  what might have been. And glancing at it, the demand for happiness raised her
  in revolt.</p>

  <p>She lit her candle and wrote another letter, of the shortest. It contained
  but these few words:</p>

  <p>"Oh, please forgive me! Come back and forgive. Oh, you must! &mdash;
  SYLVIA."</p>

  <p>And having written them, Sylvia stole quietly down-stairs, let herself out
  at the door and posted them.</p>

  <p>Two nights afterward she leaned out of her window at midnight, wondering
  whether by the morrow's post she would receive an answer to her message. And
  while she wondered she understood that the answer would not come that way.
  For suddenly in the moonlit road beneath her, she saw standing the one who
  was to send it. Chayne had brought his answer himself. For a moment she
  distrusted her own eyes, believing that her thoughts had raised this phantom
  to delude her. But the figure in the road moved beneath her window and she
  heard his voice call to her:</p>

  <p>"Sylvia! Sylvia!"</p>

  THE SHADOW IN THE ROOM</h2>

  <p class="first">Sylvia raised her hand suddenly, enjoining silence, and
  turned back into the room. She had heard a door slam violently within the
  house; and now from the hall voices rose. Her father and Walter Hine were
  coming up early to-night from the library, and it seemed in anger. At all
  events Walter Hine was angry. His voice rang up the stairway shrill and
  violent.</p>

  <p>"Why do you keep it from me? I will have it, I tell you. I am not a
  child," and an oath or two garnished the sentences.</p>

  <p>Sylvia heard her father reply with the patronage which never failed to
  sting the vanity of his companion, which was the surest means to provoke a
  quarrel, if a quarrel he desired.</p>

  <p>"Go to bed, Wallie! Leave such things to Archie Parminter! You are too
  young."</p>

  <p>His voice was friendly, but a little louder than he generally used, so
  that Sylvia clearly distinguished every word; so clearly indeed, that had he
  wished her to hear, thus he would have spoken. She heard the two men mount
  the stairs, Hine still protesting with the violence which had grown on him of
  late; Garratt Skinner seeking apparently to calm him, and apparently
  oblivious that every word he spoke inflamed Walter Hine the more. She had a
  fear there would be blows &mdash; blows struck, of course, by Hine. She knew
  the reason of the quarrel. Her father was depriving Hine of his drug. They
  passed up-stairs, however, and on the landing above she heard their doors
  close. Then coming back to the window she made a sign to Chayne, slipped a
  cloak about her shoulders and stole quietly down the dark stairs to the door.
  She unlocked the door gently and went out to her lover. Upon the threshold
  she hesitated, chilled by a fear as to how he would greet her. But he turned
  to her and in the moonlight she saw his face and read it. There was no anger
  there. She ran toward him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear," she cried, in a low, trembling voice, and his arms enclosed
  her. As she felt them hold her to him, and knew indeed that it was he, her
  lover, whose lips bent down to hers, there broke from her a long sigh of such
  relief and such great uplifting happiness as comes but seldom, perhaps no
  more than once, in the life of any man or woman. Her voice sank to a whisper,
  and yet was very clear and, to the man who heard it, sweet as never music
  was.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear, my dear! You have come then?" and she stroked his face, and
  her hands clung about his neck to make very sure.</p>

  <p>"Were you afraid that I wouldn't come, Sylvia?" he asked, with a low,
  quiet laugh.</p>

  <p>She lifted her face into the moonlight, so that he saw at once the tears
  bright in her eyes and the smile trembling upon her lips.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "I rather thought that you would come," and she laughed as
  she spoke. Or did she sob? He could hardly tell, so near she was to both.
  "Oh, but I could not be sure! I wrote with so much unkindness," and her eyes
  dropped from his in shame.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" he said, and he held her close.</p>

  <p>"Have you forgiven me? Oh, please forgive me!"</p>

  <p>"Long since," said he.</p>

  <p>But Sylvia was not reassured.</p>

  <p>"Ah, but you won't forget," she said, ruefully. "One can forgive, but one
  can't forget what one forgives," and then since, even in her remorse, hope
  was uppermost with her that night, she cried, "Oh, Hilary, do you think you
  ever will forget what I wrote to you?"</p>

  <p>And again Chayne laughed quietly at her fears.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter what you wrote a week ago, since to-night we are
  here, you and I &mdash; together, in the moonlight, for all the world to see
  that we are lovers."</p>

  <p>She drew him quickly aside into the shadow of the wall.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid we should be seen?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, but afraid we may be interrupted," she replied, with a clear trill of
  laughter which showed to her lover that her fears had passed.</p>

  <p>"The whole village is asleep, Sylvia," he said in a whisper; and as he
  spoke a blind was lifted in an upper story of the house, a window was flung
  wide, and the light streamed out from it into the moonlit air and spread over
  their heads like a great, yellow fan. Walter Hine leaned his elbows on the
  sill and looked out.</p>

  <p>Sylvia moved deeper into the shadow.</p>

  <p>"He cannot see us," said Chayne, with a smile, and he set his arm about
  her waist; and so they stood very quietly.</p>

  <p>The house was built a few yards back from the road, and on each side of it
  the high wall of the garden curved in toward it, making thus an open graveled
  space in front of its windows. Sylvia and her lover stood at one of the
  corners where the wall curved in; the shadow reached out beyond their feet
  and lay upon the white road in a black triangle; they could hardly be seen
  from any window of the house, and certainly they could not be recognized. But
  on the other hand they could see. From behind Walter Hine the light streamed
  out clear. The ceiling of the room was visible and the shadow of the lamp
  upon it, and even the top part of the door in the far corner.</p>

  <p>"We will wait until he turns back into the room," Sylvia whispered; and
  for a little while they stood and watched. Then she felt Chayne's arm tighten
  about her and hold her still.</p>

  <p>"Do you see?" he cried, in a low, quick voice. "Sylvia, do you see?"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"The door. Look! Behind him! The door!" And Sylvia, looking as he bade
  her, started, and barely stifled the cry which rose to her lips. For behind
  Walter Hine, the door in the far corner of the room was opening &mdash; very
  slowly, very stealthily, as though the hand which opened it feared to be
  detected. So noiselessly had the latch been loosed that Walter Hine did not
  so much as turn his head. Nor did he turn it now. He heard nothing. He leaned
  from the window with his elbows on the sill, and behind him the gap between
  the door and the wall grew wider and wider. The door opened into the room and
  toward the window, so that the two people in the shadow below could see
  nothing of the intruder. But the secrecy of his coming had something sinister
  and most alarming. Sylvia joined her hands above her lover's arm, holding her
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Shout to him!" she whispered. "Cry out that there's danger."</p>

  <p>"Not yet!" said Chayne, with his eyes fixed upon the lighted room; and
  then, in spite of herself, a low and startled cry broke from Sylvia's lips. A
  great shadow had been suddenly flung upon the ceiling of the room, the shadow
  of a man, bloated and made monstrous by the light. The intruder had entered
  the room; and with so much stealth that his presence was only noticed by the
  two who watched in the road below. But even they could not see who the
  intruder was, they only saw the shadow on the ceiling.</p>

  <p>Walter Hine, however, heard Sylvia's cry, faint though it was. He leaned
  forward from the window and peered down.</p>

  <p>"Now!" said Sylvia. "Now!"</p>

  <p>But Chayne did not answer. He was watching with an extraordinary suspense.
  He seemed not to hear. And on the ceiling the shadow moved, and changed its
  shape, now dwindling, now growing larger again, now disappearing altogether
  as though the intruder stooped below the level of the lamp; and once there
  was flung on the white plaster the huge image of an arm which had something
  in its hand. Was the arm poised above the lamp, on the point of smashing it
  with the thing it held? Chayne waited, with a cry upon his lips, expecting
  each moment that the room would be plunged in darkness. But the cry was not
  uttered, the arm was withdrawn. It had not been raised to smash the lamp, the
  thing which the hand held was for some other purpose. And once more the
  shadow appeared moving and changing as the intruder crept nearer to the
  window. Sylvia stood motionless. She had thought to cry out, now she was
  fascinated. A spell of terror constrained her to silence. And then, suddenly,
  behind Walter Hine there stood out clearly in the light the head and
  shoulders of Garratt Skinner.</p>

  <p>"My father," said Sylvia, in relief. Her clasp upon Chayne's arm relaxed;
  her terror passed from her. In the revulsion of her feelings she laughed
  quietly at her past fear. Chayne looked quickly and curiously at her. Then as
  quickly he looked again to the window. Both men in the room were now lit up
  by the yellow light; their attitudes, their figures were very clear but
  small, like marionettes upon the stage of some tiny theater. Chayne watched
  them with no less suspense now that he knew who the intruder was. Unlike
  Sylvia he had betrayed no surprise when he had seen Garratt Skinner's head
  and shoulders rise into view behind Walter Hine; and unlike Sylvia, he did
  not relax his vigilance. Suddenly Garratt Skinner stepped forward, very
  quickly, very silently. With one step he was close behind his friend; and
  then just as he was about to move again &mdash; it seemed to Sylvia that he
  was raising his arm, perhaps to touch his friend upon the shoulder &mdash;
  Chayne whistled &mdash; whistled sharply, shrilly and with a kind of urgency
  which Sylvia did not understand.</p>

  <p>Walter Hine leaned forward out of the window. That was quite natural. But
  on the other hand Garratt Skinner did nothing of the kind. To Sylvia's
  surprise he stepped back, and almost out of sight. Very likely he thought
  that he was out of sight. But to the watchers in the road his head was just
  visible. He was peering over Walter Hine's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Again Chayne whistled and, not content with whistling, he cried out in a
  feigned bucolic accent:</p>

  <p>"I see you."</p>

  <p>At once Garratt Skinner's head disappeared altogether.</p>

  <p>Walter Hine peered down into the darkness whence the whistle came, curving
  his hands above his forehead to shut out the light behind him; and behind him
  once more the shadow appeared upon the ceiling and the wall. A third time
  Chayne whistled; and Walter Hine cried out:</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>And behind him the shadow vanished from the ceiling and the door began to
  close, softly and stealthily, just as softly and stealthily as it had been
  opened.</p>

  <p>Again, Hine cried out:</p>

  <p>"Who's there? What is it?"</p>

  <p>And Chayne laughed aloud derisively, as though he were some yokel
  practising a joke. Hine turned back into the room. The room was empty, but
  the door was unlatched. He disappeared from the window, and the watchers
  below saw the door slammed to, heard the sound of the slamming and then
  another sound, the sound of a key turning in the lock.</p>

  <p>It seemed almost that Chayne had been listening for that sound. For he
  turned at once to Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"We puzzled them fairly, didn't we?" he said, with a smile. But the smile
  somehow seemed hardly real, and his face was very white.</p>

  <p>"It's the moonlight," he explained. "Come!"</p>

  <p>They walked quietly through the silent village where the thick eaves of
  the cottages threw their black shadows on the white moonlit road, past the
  mill and the running water, to a gate which opened on the down. They
  unlatched the gate noiselessly and climbed the bare slope of grass. Half way
  up Chayne turned and looked down upon the house. There was no longer any
  light in any window. He turned to Sylvia and slipped his arm through
  hers.</p>

  <p>"Come close," said he, and now there was no doubt the smile was real.
  "Shall we keep step, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"If we go always like this, we might," said Sylvia, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"At times there will be a step to be cut, no doubt," said he.</p>

  <p>"You once said that I could stand firm while the step was being cut," she
  answered. Always at the back of both their minds, evident from time to time
  in some such phrase as this, was the thought of the mountain upon which their
  friendship had been sealed. Friendship had become love here in the quiet
  Dorsetshire village, but in both their thoughts it had another background
  &mdash; ice-slope and rock-spire and the bright sun over all.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap20"
     id="chap20"><small>CHAPTER 20</small></a><br>
  <br>
  ON THE DOWN</h2>

  <p class="first">Sylvia led the way to a little hollow just beneath the ridge
  of the downs, a sheltered spot open to the sea. On the three other sides
  bushes grew about it and dry branches and leaves deeply carpeted the floor.
  Here they rested and were silent. Upon Sylvia's troubled heart there had
  fallen a mantle of deep peace. The strife, the fears, the torturing questions
  had become dim like the small griefs of childhood. Even the incident of the
  lighted window vexed her not at all.</p>

  <p>"Hilary," she said softly, lingering on the name, since to frame it and
  utter it and hear her lips speaking it greatly pleased her, "Hilary," and her
  hand sought his, and finding it she was content.</p>

  <p>It was a warm night of August. Overhead the moon sailed in a cloudless
  summer sky, drowning the stars. To the right, far below, the lamps of
  Weymouth curved about the shore; and in front the great bay shimmered like a
  jewel. Seven miles across it the massive bluff of Portland pushed into the
  sea; and even those rugged cliffs were subdued to the beauty of the night.
  Beneath them the riding-lights shone steady upon the masts of the battle
  ships. Sylvia looked out upon the scene with an overflowing heart. Often she
  had gazed on it before, and she marveled now how quickly she had turned
  aside. Her eyes were now susceptible to beauty as they had never been. There
  was a glory upon land and sea, a throbbing tenderness in the warm air of
  which she had not known till now. It seemed to her that she had lived until
  this night in a prison. Once the doors had been set ajar for a little while
  &mdash; just for a night and a day in the quiet of the High Alps. But only
  now had they been opened wide. Only to- night had she passed through and
  looked forth with an unhindered vision upon the world; and she discovered it
  to be a place of wonders and sweet magic.</p>

  <p>"They were true, then," she said, with a smile on her lips.</p>

  <p>"Of what do you speak?" asked Chayne.</p>

  <p>"My dreams," Sylvia answered, knowing that she was justified of them. "For
  I have come awake into the land of my dreams, and I know it at last to be a
  real land, even to the sound of running water."</p>

  <p>For from the hollow at her feet the music of the mill stream rose to her
  ears through the still night, very clear and with a murmur of laughter.
  Sylvia looked down toward it. She saw it flashing like a riband of silver in
  the garden of the dark quiet house. There was no breath of wind in that
  garden, and all the great trees were still. She saw the intricate pattern of
  their boughs traced upon the lawn in black and silver.</p>

  <p>"In that house I was born," she said softly, "to the noise of that stream.
  I am very glad to know that in that house, too, my great happiness has come
  to me."</p>

  <p>Chayne leaned forward, and sitting side by side with Sylvia, gazed down
  upon it with rapture. Oh, wonderful house where Sylvia was born! How much the
  world owed to it!</p>

  <p>"It was there!" he said with awe.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Sylvia. She was not without a proper opinion of herself,
  and it seemed rather a wonderful house to her, too.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps on some such night as this," he said, and at once took the words
  back. "No! You were born on a sunny morning of July and the blackbirds on the
  branches told the good news to the blackbirds on the lawn, and the stream
  took up the message and rippled it out to the ships upon the sea. There were
  no wrecks that day."</p>

  <p>Sylvia turned to him, her face made tender by a smile, her dark eyes kind
  and bright.</p>

  <p>"Hilary!" she whispered. "Oh, Hilary!"</p>

  <p>"Sylvia!" he replied, mimicking her tone. And Sylvia laughed with the
  clear melodious note of happiness. All her old life was whirled away upon
  those notes of laughter. She leaned to her lover with a sigh of contentment,
  her hair softly touching his cheek; her eyes once more dropped to the still
  garden and the dark square house at the down's foot.</p>

  <p>"There you asked me to marry you, to go away with you," she said, and she
  caught his hand and held it close against her breast.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there I first asked you," he said, and some distress, forgotten in
  these first perfect moments, suddenly found voice. "Sylvia, why didn't you
  come with me then? Oh, my dear, if you only had!"</p>

  <p>But Sylvia's happiness was as yet too fresh, too loud at her throbbing
  heart for her to mark the jarring note.</p>

  <p>"I did not want to then," she replied lightly, and then tightening her
  clasp upon his hand. "But now I do. Oh, Hilary, I do!"</p>

  <p>"If only you had wanted then!"</p>

  <p>Though he spoke low, the anguish of his voice was past mistaking. Sylvia
  looked at him quickly and most anxiously; and as quickly she looked away.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she whispered hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Her happiness could not be so short-lived a thing. Her heart stood still
  at the thought. It could not be that she had set foot actually within the
  dreamland, to be forthwith cast out again. She thought of the last week, its
  aching lonely hours. She needed her lover at her side, longed for him with a
  great yearning, and would not let him go.</p>

  <p>"I'll not listen, Hilary," she said stubbornly. "I will not hear! No"; and
  Chayne drew her close to his side.</p>

  <p>"There is bad news, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>The outcry died away upon her lips. The words crushed the rebellion in her
  heart, they were so familiar. It seemed to her that all her life bad news had
  been brought to her by every messenger. She shivered and was silent, looking
  straight out across the moonlit sea. Then in a small trembling voice, like a
  child's, she pleaded, still holding her face averted:</p>

  <p>"Don't go away from me, Hilary! Oh, please! Don't go away from me
  now!"</p>

  <p>Her voice, her words, went to Chayne's heart. He knew that pride and a
  certain reticence were her natural qualities. That she should throw aside the
  one, break through the other, proved to him indeed how very much she cared,
  how very much she needed him.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia," he cried, "it will only be for a little while"; and again
  silence followed upon his words.</p>

  <p>Since bad news was to be imparted, strength was needed to bear it; and
  habit had long since taught Sylvia that silence was the best nurse of
  strength. She did not turn her face toward her lover; but she drooped her
  head and clenched her hands tightly together upon her knees, nerving herself
  for the blow. The movement, slight though it was, stirred Chayne to pity and
  hurt him with an intolerable pain. It betrayed so unmistakably the long habit
  of suffering. She sat silent, motionless, with the dumb patience of a wounded
  animal.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sylvia, why did you not come with me on that first day?" he
  cried.</p>

  <p>"Tell me your bad news, dear," she replied, gently.</p>

  <p>"I cannot help it," he began in broken tones. "Sylvia, you will see that
  there is no escape, that I must go. An appointment was offered to me &mdash;
  by the War Office. It was offered to me, pressed on me, the day after I last
  came here, the day after we were together in the library. I did not know what
  to do. I did not accept it. But it seemed to me that each time I came to see
  you we became more and more estranged. I was given two days to make up my
  mind, and within the two days, my dear, your letter came, telling me you did
  not wish to see me any more."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hilary!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I accepted the appointment at once. There were reasons why I welcomed it.
  It would take me abroad!"</p>

  <p>"Abroad!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I welcomed that. To be near you and not to see you &mdash; to be
  near you and know that others were talking with you, any one, every one
  except me &mdash; to be near you and know that you were unhappy and in
  trouble, and that I could not even tell you how deeply I was sorry &mdash; I
  dreaded that, Sylvia. And yet I dreaded one thing more. Here, in England, at
  each turn of the street, I should think to come upon you suddenly. To pass
  you as a stranger, or almost as a stranger. No! I could not do it!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hilary!" she whispered, and lifting his hand she laid it against her
  cheek.</p>

  <p>"So for a week I was glad. But this morning I received your second letter,
  Sylvia. It came too late, my dear. There was no time to obtain a
  substitute."</p>

  <p>Sylvia turned to him with a startled face.</p>

  <p>"When do you go?"</p>

  <p>"Very soon."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>The words had to be spoken.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning. I catch the first train from Weymouth to Southampton.
  We sail from Southampton at noon."</p>

  <p>Habit came again to her assistance. She turned away from him so that he
  might not see her face, and he went on:</p>

  <p>"Had there been more time, I could have made arrangements. Some one else
  could have gone. As it is&mdash;" He broke off suddenly, and bending toward
  her cried: "Sylvia, say that I must go."</p>

  <p>But she could not bring herself to that. She was minded to hold with both
  hands the good thing which had come to her this night. She shook her head. He
  sought to turn her face to his, but she looked stubbornly away.</p>

  <p>"And when will you return?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"In a few months, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"In June." And she counted off the months upon her fingers.</p>

  <p>"So after to-night," she said, in a low voice, "I shall not see you any
  more for all these months. The winter must pass, and the spring, too. Oh,
  Hilary!" and she turned to him with a quivering face and whispered piteously:
  "Don't go, my dear. Don't go!"</p>

  <p>"Say that I must go!" he insisted, and she laughed with scorn. Then the
  laughter ceased and she said:</p>

  <p>"There will be danger?"</p>

  <p>"None," he cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes &mdash; from sickness, and&mdash;" her voice broke in a sob &mdash;
  "I shall not be near."</p>

  <p>"I will take great care, Sylvia. Be sure of that," he answered. "Now that
  I have you, I will take great care," and leaning toward her, as she sat with
  her hands clasped upon her knees, he touched her hair with his lips very
  tenderly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hilary, what will I do? Till you come back to me! What will I
  do?"</p>

  <p>"I have thought of it, Sylvia. I thought this. It might be better if, for
  these months &mdash; they will not pass quickly, my dear, either for you or
  me. They will be long slow months for both of us. That's the truth, my dear.
  But since they must be got through, I thought it might be better if you went
  back to your mother."</p>

  <p>Sylvia shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It would be better," he urged, with a look toward the house.</p>

  <p>"I can't do that. Afterward, in a year's time &mdash; when we are
  together, I should like very much for us both to go to her. But my mother
  forbade it when I went away from Chamonix. I was not to come whining back to
  her, those were her words. We parted altogether that night."</p>

  <p>She spoke with an extreme simplicity. There was neither an appeal for pity
  nor a hint of any bitterness in her voice. But the words moved Chayne all the
  more on that account. He would be leaving a very lonely, friendless girl to
  battle through the months of his absence by herself; and to battle with what?
  He was not sure. But he had not taken so lightly the shadow on the ceiling
  and the opening door.</p>

  <p>"If only you had come with me on that first day," he cried.</p>

  <p>"I will have to-night to look back upon, my dear," she said. "That will be
  something. Oh, if I had not asked you to come back! If you had gone away and
  said nothing! What would I have done then? As it is, I will know that you are
  thinking of me &mdash; " and suddenly she turned to him, and held him away
  from her in a spasm of fear while her eyes searched his face. But in a moment
  they melted and a smile made her lips beautiful. "Oh, yes, I can trust you,"
  she said, and she nestled against him contentedly like a child.</p>

  <p>For a little while they sat thus, and then her eyes sought the garden and
  the house at her feet. It seemed that the sinister plot was not, after all,
  to develop in that place of quiet and old peace without her for its witness.
  It seemed that she was to be kept by some fatality close-fettered to the
  task, the hopeless task, which she would now gladly have foregone. And she
  wondered whether, after all, she was in some way meant to watch the plot,
  perhaps, after all, to hinder it.</p>

  <p>"Hilary," she said, "you remember that evening at the Chalet de
  Lognan?"</p>

  <p>"Do I remember it?"</p>

  <p>"You explained to me a law &mdash; that those who know must use their
  knowledge, if by using it they can save a soul, or save a life."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, vaguely remembering that he had spoken in this strain.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have been trying to obey that law. Do you understand? I want you
  to understand. For when I have been unkind, as I have been many times, it
  was, I think, because I was not obeying it with very much success. And I
  should like you to believe and know that. For when you are away, you will
  remember, in spite of yourself, the times when I was bitter."</p>

  <p>Her words made clear to him many things which had perplexed him during
  these last weeks. Her friendship for Walter Hine became intelligible, and as
  though to leave him no shadow of doubt, she went on.</p>

  <p>"You see, I knew the under side of things, and I seemed to see the
  opportunity to use the knowledge. So I tried to save"; and whether it was
  life or soul, or both, she did not say. She did not add that so far she had
  tried in vain; she did not mention the bottle of cocaine, or the dread which
  of late had so oppressed her. She was careful of her lover. Since he had to
  go, since he needs must be absent, she would spare him anxieties and dark
  thoughts which he could do nothing to dispel. But even so, he obtained a
  clearer insight into the distress which she had suffered in that house, and
  the bravery with which she had borne it.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia," he said, "I had no thought, no wish, that what I said should
  stay with you."</p>

  <p>"Yet it did," she answered, "and I was thankful. I am thankful even now.
  For though I would gladly give up all the struggle now, if I had you instead;
  since I have not you, I am thankful for the law. It was your voice which
  spoke it, it came from you. It will keep you near to me all through the black
  months until you come back. Oh, Hilary!" and the brave argument spoken to
  enhearten herself and him ended suddenly in a most wistful cry. Chayne caught
  her to him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sylvia!" and he added: "The life is not yet saved!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am given to the summer," she answered, and then, with a
  whimsical change of humor, she laughed tenderly. "Oh, but I wish I wasn't.
  You will write? Letters will come from you."</p>

  <p>"As often as possible, my dear. But they won't come often."</p>

  <p>"Let them be long, then," she whispered, "very long," and she leaned her
  head against his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Lie close, my dear," said he. "Lie close!"</p>

  <p>For a while longer they talked in low voices to one another, the words
  which lovers know and keep fragrant in their memories. The night, warm and
  clear, drew on toward morning, and the passage of the hours was unremarked.
  For both of them there was a glory upon the moonlit land and sea which made
  of it a new world. And into this new world both walked for the first time
  &mdash; walked in their youth and hand in hand. Each for the first time knew
  the double pride of loving and being loved. In spite of their troubles they
  were not to be pitied, and they knew it. The gray morning light flooded the
  sky and turned the moon into a pale white disk.</p>

  <p>"Lie close, my dear," said he. "It is not time."</p>

  <p>In the trees in the garden below the blackbirds began to bustle amongst
  the leaves, and all at once their clear, sweet music thrilled upward to the
  lovers in the hollow of the down.</p>

  <p>"Lie close, my dear," he repeated.</p>

  <p>They watched the sun leap into the heavens and flash down the Channel in
  golden light.</p>

  <p>"The night has gone," said Chayne.</p>

  <p>"Nothing can take it from us while we live," answered Sylvia, very softly.
  She raised herself from her couch of leaves.</p>

  <p>Then from one of the cottages in the tiny village a blue coil of smoke
  rose into the air.</p>

  <p>"It is time," said Chayne, and they rose and hand in hand walked down the
  slope of the hill to the house. Sylvia unlatched the door noiselessly and
  went in. Chayne stepped in after her; and in the silent hall they took
  farewell of one another.</p>

  <p>"Good-by, my dear," she whispered, with the tears in her eyes and in her
  voice, and she clung to him a little and so let him go. She held the door
  ajar until the sound of his footsteps had died away &mdash; and after that.
  For she fancied that she heard them still, since, she so deeply wished to
  hear them. Then with a breaking heart she went up the stairs to her room.</p>

  <br>
  CHAYNE COMES TO CONCLUSIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">"Six weeks ago I said good-by to the French Commission on
  the borders of a great lake in Africa. A month ago I was still walking to the
  rail head through the tangle of a forest's undergrowth," said Chayne, and he
  looked about the little restaurant in King Street, St. James', as though to
  make sure that the words he spoke were true. The bright lights, the red
  benches against the walls, the women in their delicate gowns of lace, and the
  jingle of harness in the streets without, made their appeal to one who for
  the best part of a year had lived within the dark walls of a forest. June had
  come round again, and Sylvia sat at his side.</p>

  <p>"You shall tell me how these months have gone with you while we dine,"
  said he. "Your letters told me nothing of your troubles."</p>

  <p>"I did not mean them to," replied Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"I guessed that, my dear. It was like you. Yet I would rather have
  known."</p>

  <p>Only a few hours before he had stood upon the deck of the Channel packet
  and had seen the bows swing westward of Dover Castle and head toward the
  pier. Would Sylvia be there, he had wondered, as he watched the cluster of
  atoms on the quay, and in a little while he had seen her, standing quite
  alone, at the very end of the breakwater that she might catch the first
  glimpse of her lover. Others had traveled with them in the carriage to London
  and there had been no opportunity of speech. All that he knew was that she
  had been alone now for some weeks in the little house in Hobart Place.</p>

  <p>"One thing I see," he said. "You are not as troubled as you were. The look
  of fear &mdash; that has gone from your eyes. Sylvia, I am glad!"</p>

  <p>"There, were times," she answered &mdash; and as she thought upon them,
  terror once more leapt into her face &mdash; "times when I feared more than
  ever, when I needed you very much. But they are past now, Hilary," and her
  hand dropped for a moment upon his, and her eyes brightened with a smile. As
  they dined she told the story of those months.</p>

  <p>"We returned to London very suddenly after you had gone away," she began.
  "We were to have stayed through September. But my father said that business
  called him back, and I noticed that he was deeply troubled."</p>

  <p>"When did you notice that?" asked Chayne, quickly. "When did you first
  notice it?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"The day after you had gone."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" asked Chayne, with a certain intensity.</p>

  <p>"Quite."</p>

  <p>Chayne nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"I did not understand the reason of the hurry. And I was perplexed &mdash;
  and also a little alarmed. Everything which I did not understand frightened
  me in those days." She spoke as if "those days" and all their dark events
  belonged to some dim period of which no consequence could reach her now. "Our
  departure had almost the look of a flight."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Chayne. For his part he was not surprised at their flight. He
  had passed more than one wakeful night during the last few months arguing and
  arguing again whether or no he should have disclosed to Sylvia the meaning of
  that softly opening door and the shadow on the ceiling as he read it. He
  might have been wrong; if so, he would have added to Sylvia's burden of
  troubles yet another, and one more terrible than all the rest. He might have
  been right; and if so, he might have enabled Sylvia to avert a tragedy. Thus
  the argument had revolved in a circle and left him always in the same doubt.
  Now he understood that his explanation of the incident had been confirmed.
  The loud whistle from the darkness of the road, the yokel's cry, which had
  driven Garratt Skinner from the room, as noiselessly as he had entered it,
  had done more than that &mdash; they had driven him from the neighborhood
  altogether. Some one had seen him &mdash; had seen him standing just behind
  Walter Hine in the lighted room &mdash; and on the next day he had fled!</p>

  <p>"I was right," he said, absently, "right to keep silent." For here was
  Sylvia at his side and the dreaded peril unfulfilled. "Well, you returned to
  London?" he added, hastily.</p>

  <p>"Yes. There is something of which I did not tell you, that night when we
  were together on the downs. Walter Hine had begun to take cocaine."</p>

  <p>Chayne started.</p>

  <p>"Cocaine!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes. My father taught him to take it."</p>

  <p>"Your father," said Chayne, slowly, trying to fit this new and astounding
  fact in with the rest. "But why?"</p>

  <p>"I think I can tell you," said Sylvia. "My father knew quite well that he
  had me working against him, trying to rescue Walter Hine out of his hands.
  And I was beginning to get some power. He understood that, and destroyed it.
  I was no match for him. I thought that I knew something of the under side of
  life. But he knew more, ever so much more, and my knowledge was of no avail.
  He taught Walter Hine the craving for cocaine, and he satisfied the craving
  &mdash; there was his power. He provided the drug. I do not know &mdash; I
  might perhaps have fought against my father and won. But against my father
  and a drug I was helpless. My father obtained it in sufficient quantity,
  withheld it at times, gave it at other times, played with him, tantalized
  him, gratified him. You can understand there was only one possible result.
  Walter Hine became my father's slave, his dog. I no longer counted in his
  thoughts at all. I was nothing."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Chayne.</p>

  <p>The device was subtle, diabolically subtle. But he wondered whether it was
  only to counterbalance and destroy Sylvia's influence that Garratt Skinner
  had introduced cocaine to Hine's notice; whether he had not had in view some
  other end, even still more sinister.</p>

  <p>"I saw very little of Mr. Hine after our return to London," she continued.
  "He did not come often to the house, but when he did come, each time I saw
  that he had changed. He had grown nervous and violent of temper. Even before
  we left Dorsetshire the violence had become noticeable."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Chayne, looking quickly at Sylvia. "Before you left
  Dorsetshire?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; and my father seemed to me to provoke it, though I could not guess
  why. For instance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?" said Chayne. "Tell me!"</p>

  <p>He spoke quietly enough, but once again there was audible a certain
  intensity in his voice. There had been an occasion when Sylvia had given to
  him more news of Garratt Skinner than she had herself. Was she to do so once
  more? He leaned forward with his eyes on hers.</p>

  <p>"The night when you came back to me. Do you remember, Hilary?" and a smile
  lightened his face.</p>

  <p>"I shall forget no moment of that night, sweetheart, while I live," he
  whispered; and blushes swept prettily over her face, and in a sweet confusion
  she smiled back at him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hilary!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sylvia!" he mimicked; and as they laughed together, it seemed there
  was a danger that the story of the months of separation would never be
  completed. But Chayne brought her back to it.</p>

  <p>"Well? On that night when I came back?"</p>

  <p>"I saw you in the road from my window, and then motioning you to be
  silent, I disappeared from the window."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember," said Chayne, eagerly. He began to think that the
  cocaine was after all going to fit in with the incidents of that night.</p>

  <p>"Walter Hine and my father were going up to bed. I heard them on the
  stairs. They were going earlier than usual."</p>

  <p>"You are sure?" interrupted Chayne. "Think well!"</p>

  <p>"Much earlier than usual, and they were quarreling. At least, Walter Hine
  was quarreling; and my father was speaking to him as if he were a child. That
  hurt his vanity and made him worse."</p>

  <p>"Your father was provoking him?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia's forehead puckered.</p>

  <p>"I could not say that, and be sure of it. But I can say this. If my father
  had wished to provoke him to a greater anger, it's in that way that he would
  have done it."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I see."</p>

  <p>"They were speaking loudly &mdash; even my father was &mdash; more loudly
  than usual &mdash; especially at that time. For when they went up-stairs,
  they usually went very quietly"; and again Chayne interrupted her.</p>

  <p>"Your father might have wanted you to hear the quarrel?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>Sylvia turned to him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Why should he wish that?" she asked, and considered the point. "He might
  have. Only, on the other hand, they were earlier than usual. They would not
  be so careful to go quietly; I was likely to be still awake."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Chayne.</p>

  <p>For in the probability that Sylvia would be still awake, would hear the
  violent words of Hine, and would therefore be an available witness afterward,
  Chayne found the reason both of the loudness of Garratt Skinner's tones and
  his early retirement for the night.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear what was said? Can you repeat the words?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. My father was keeping something from Mr. Hine which he wanted. I
  have no doubt it was the cocaine," and she repeated the words.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Chayne. "Yes," in the tone of one who is satisfied. The
  incident of the lighted room and the shadow on the ceiling were clear to him
  now. A quarrel of which there was a witness, a quarrel all to the credit of
  Garratt Skinner since it arose from his determination to hinder Walter Hine
  from poisoning himself with drugs &mdash; at least, that is how the evidence
  would work out; the quarrel continued in Walter Hine's bedroom, whither
  Garratt Skinner had accompanied his visitor, a struggle begun for the
  possession of the drug, begun by a man half crazy for want of it, a blow in
  self-defence delivered by Garratt Skinner, perhaps a fall from the window
  &mdash; that is how Chayne read the story of that night, as fashioned by the
  ingenuity of Garratt Skinner.</p>

  <p>But on one point he was still perplexed. The story had not been told out
  to its end that night: there had come an unexpected shout, which had
  interrupted it, and indeed forever had prevented its completion on that spot.
  But why had it not been completed afterward, during the next few months,
  somewhere else? It had not been completed. For here was Sylvia with all her
  fears allayed, continuing the story of those months.</p>

  <p>"But violence was not the only change in Walter Hine. There were some
  physical alterations which frightened me. Mr. Hine, as I say, came very
  seldom to our house, though my father saw a great deal of him. Otherwise I
  should have noticed them before. But early this year he came and &mdash; you
  remember he was fair &mdash; well, his skin had grown dark, quite dark, his
  complexion had changed altogether. And there was something else which shocked
  me. His tongue was black, really black. I asked him what was the matter? He
  grew restless and angry and lied to me, and then he broke down and told me he
  could not sleep. He slept for a few minutes only at a time. He really was ill
  &mdash; very ill."</p>

  <p>Was this the explanation, Chayne asked himself? Having failed at the quick
  process, the process of the lighted room and the open window, had Garratt
  Skinner left the drug to do its work slowly and surely?</p>

  <p>"He was so weak, so broken in appearance, that I was alarmed. My father
  was not in the house. I sent for a cab and I took Mr. Hine myself to a
  doctor. The doctor knew at once what was amiss. For a time Mr. Hine said
  'No,' but he gave in at the last. He was in the habit of taking thirty grains
  of cocaine a day."</p>

  <p>"Thirty grains!" exclaimed Chayne.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Of course it could not go on. Death or insanity would surely follow.
  He was warned of it, and for a while he went into a home. Then he got better,
  and he determined to go abroad and travel."</p>

  <p>"Who suggested that?" asked Chayne.</p>

  <p>"I do not know. I know only that he refused to go without my father, and
  that my father consented to accompany him."</p>

  <p>Chayne was startled.</p>

  <p>"They are away together now?" he cried. A look of horror in his eyes
  betrayed his fear. He stared at Sylvia. Had she no suspicion &mdash; she who
  knew something of the under side of life? But she quietly returned his
  look.</p>

  <p>"I took precautions. I told my father what I knew &mdash; not merely that
  Mr. Hine had acquired the habit of taking cocaine, but who had taught him the
  habit. Yes, I did that," she said simply, answering his look of astonishment.
  "It was difficult, my dear, and I would very much have liked to have had you
  there to help me through with it. But since you were not there, since I was
  alone, I did it alone. I thought of you, Hilary, while I was saying what I
  had to say. I tried to hear your voice speaking again outside the Chalet de
  Lognan. 'What you know, that you must do.' I warned my father that if any
  harm came to Walter Hine from taking the drug again, any harm at all which I
  traced to my father, I would not keep silent."</p>

  <p>Chayne leaned back in his seat.</p>

  <p>"You said that &mdash; to Garratt Skinner, Sylvia!" and the warmth of
  pride and admiration in his voice brought the color to her cheeks and
  compensated her for that bad hour. "You stood up alone and braved him out! My
  dear, if I had only been there! And you never wrote to me a word of it!"</p>

  <p>"It would only have troubled you," she answered. "It would not have helped
  me to know that you were troubled!"</p>

  <p>"And he &mdash; your father?" he asked. "How did he receive it?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia's face grew pale, and she stared at the table-cloth as though she
  could not for the moment trust her voice. Then she shuddered and said in a
  low and shaking voice &mdash; so vivid was still the memory of that hour:</p>

  <p>"I thought that I should never see you again."</p>

  <p>She said no more. From those few words, and from the manner in which she
  uttered them, Chayne had to build up the terrible scene which had taken place
  between Sylvia and her father in the little back room of the house in Hobart
  Place. He looked round the lighted room, listened to the ripple of light
  voices, and watched the play of lively faces and bright eyes. There was an
  incongruity between these surroundings and the words which he had heard which
  shocked him.</p>

  <p>"My dear, I'll make it up to you," he said. "Trust me, I will! There shall
  be good hours, now. I'll watch you, till I know surely without a word from
  you what you are thinking and feeling and wanting. Trust me, dearest!"</p>

  <p>"With all my heart and the rest of my life," she answered, a smile
  responding to his words, and she resumed her story:</p>

  <p>"I extracted from my father a promise that every week he should write to
  me and tell me how Mr. Hine was and where they both were. And to that &mdash;
  at last &mdash; he consented. They have been away together for two months,
  and every week I have heard. So I think there is no danger."</p>

  <p>Chayne did not disagree. But, on the other hand, he did not assent.</p>

  <p>"I suppose Mr. Hine is very rich?" he said, doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Sylvia. "That's another reason why &mdash; I am not afraid."
  She chose the words rather carefully, unwilling to express a deliberate
  charge against her father. "I used to think that he was &mdash; in the
  beginning when Captain Barstow won so much from him. But when the bets ceased
  and no more cards were played &mdash; I used to puzzle over why they ceased
  last year. But I think I have hit upon the explanation. My father discovered
  then what I only found out a few weeks ago. I wrote to Mr. Hine's
  grandfather, telling him that his grandson was ill, and asking him whether he
  would not send for him. I thought that would be the best plan."</p>

  <p>"Yes, well?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the grandfather answered me very shortly that he did not know his
  grandson, that he did not wish to know him, and that they had nothing to do
  with one another in any way. It was a churlish letter. He seemed to think
  that I wanted to marry Mr. Hine," and she laughed as she spoke, "and that I
  was trying to find out what we should have to live upon. I suppose that it
  was natural he should think so. And I am so glad that I wrote. For he told me
  that although Mr. Hine must eventually have a fortune, it would not be until
  he himself died and that he was a very healthy man. So you see, there could
  be no advantage to any one&mdash;" and she did not finish the sentence.</p>

  <p>But Chayne could finish it for himself. There could be no advantage to any
  one if Walter Hine died. But then why the cocaine? Why the incident of the
  lighted window?</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, in perplexity, "I can corroborate that. It happened that
  my friend John Lattery, who was killed in Switzerland, was also connected
  with Joseph Hine. He also would have inherited; and I knew from him that the
  old man did not recognize his heirs. But &mdash; but Walter Hine had money
  &mdash; some money, at all events. And he earned none. From whom did he get
  it?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I do not know."</p>

  <p>"Had he no other relations, no friends?"</p>

  <p>"None who would have made him an allowance."</p>

  <p>Chayne pondered over that question. For in the answer to it he was
  convinced he would find the explanation of the mystery. If money was given to
  Walter Hine, who had apparently no rich relations but his grandfather, and
  certainly no rich friends, it would have been given with some object. To
  discover the giver and his object &mdash; that was the problem.</p>

  <p>"Think! Did he never speak of any one?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia searched her memories.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "He never spoke of his private affairs. He always led us
  to understand that he drew an allowance from his grandfather."</p>

  <p>"But your father found that that was untrue when you were in Dorsetshire,
  ten months ago. For the card-playing and the bets ceased."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Sylvia agreed thoughtfully. Then her face brightened. "I remember a
  morning when Mr. Hine was in trouble. Wait a moment! He had a letter. We were
  at breakfast and the letter came from Captain Barstow. There was some phrase
  in the letter which Mr. Hine repeated. 'As between gentlemen' &mdash; that
  was it! I remember thinking at the time what in the world Captain Barstow
  could know about gentlemen; and wondering why the phrase should trouble Mr.
  Hine. And that morning Mr. Hine went to London."</p>

  <p>"Oh, did he?" cried Chayne. "'As between gentlemen.' Had Hine been losing
  money lately to Captain Barstow?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, on the day when you first came."</p>

  <p>"The starlings," exclaimed Chayne in some excitement. "That's it &mdash;
  Walter Hine owes money to Captain Barstow which he can't pay. Barstow writes
  for it &mdash; a debt of honor between gentlemen &mdash; one can imagine the
  letter. Hine goes up to London. Well, what then?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia started.</p>

  <p>"My father went to London two days afterward."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>It seemed to Chayne that they were getting hot in their search.</p>

  <p>"Quite sure. For I remember that after his return his manner changed. What
  I thought to be the new plot was begun. The cards disappeared, the bets
  ceased, Mr. Parminter was brought down with the cocaine. I remember it all
  clearly. For I always associated the change with my father's journey to
  London. You came one evening &mdash; do you remember? You found me alone and
  afraid. My father and Walter Hine were walking arm-in-arm in the garden. That
  was afterward."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you were afraid because there was no sincerity in that friendship.
  Now let me get this right!"</p>

  <p>He remained silent for a little while, placing the events in their due
  order and interpreting them, one by the other.</p>

  <p>"This is what I make of it," he said at length. "The man in London who
  supplies Walter Hine with money finds that Walter Hine is spending too much.
  He therefore puts himself into communication with Garratt Skinner, of whom he
  has doubtless heard from Walter Hine. Garratt Skinner travels to London, has
  an interview, and a concerted plan of action is agreed upon, which Garratt
  Skinner proceeds to put in action."</p>

  <p>He spoke so gravely that Sylvia turned anxiously toward him.</p>

  <p>"What do you infer, then?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"That we are in very deep and troubled waters, my dear," he replied, but
  he would not be more explicit. He had no doubt in his mind that the murder of
  Walter Hine had been deliberately agreed upon by Garratt Skinner and the
  unknown man in London. But just as Sylvia had spared him during his months of
  absence, so now he was minded to spare Sylvia. Only, in order that he might
  spare her, in order that he might prevent shame and distress greater than she
  had known, he must needs go on with his questioning. He must discover, if by
  any means he could, the identity of the unknown man who was so concerned in
  the destiny of Walter Hine.</p>

  <p>"Of your father's friends, was there one who was rich? Who came to the
  house? Who were his companions?"</p>

  <p>"Very few people came to the house. There was no one amongst them who fits
  in"; and upon that she started. "I wonder&mdash;" she said, thoughtfully, and
  she turned to her lover. "After my father had gone away, I found a telegram
  in a drawer in one of the rooms. There was no envelope, there was just the
  telegram. So I opened it. It was addressed to my father. I remember the
  words, for I did not know whether there was not something which needed
  attention. It ran like this: 'What are you waiting for? Hurry up.'"</p>

  <p>"Was it signed?" asked Chayne.</p>

  <p>"Yes. 'Jarvice,'" replied Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Jarvice," Chayne repeated; and he spoke it yet again, as though in some
  vague way it was familiar to him. "What was the date of the telegram?"</p>

  <p>"It had been sent a month before I found it. So I put it back into the
  drawer."</p>

  <p>"'What are you waiting for? Hurry up. Jarvice,'" said Chayne, slowly, and
  then he remembered how and when he had come across the name of Jarvice
  before. His face grew very grave.</p>

  <p>"We are in deep waters, my dear," he said.</p>

  <p>There had been trouble in his regiment, some years before, in which the
  chief figures had been a subaltern and a money-lender. Jarvice was the name
  of the money-lender &mdash; an unusual name. Just such a man would be likely
  to be Garratt Skinner's confederate and backer. Chayne ran over the story in
  his mind again, by this new light. It certainly strengthened the argument
  that the Mr. Jarvice who sent the telegram was Mr. Jarvice, the money-lender.
  Thus did Chayne work it out in his thoughts:</p>

  <p>"Jarvice, for some reason unknown, pays Walter Hine an allowance. Walter
  Hine gives it out that he receives it from his grandfather, whose heir he
  undoubtedly is, and being a vain person much exaggerates the amount. He falls
  into Garratt Skinner's hands, who, with the help of Barstow and others,
  proceeds to pluck him. Walter Hine loses more than he has and applies to
  Jarvice for more. Jarvice elicits the facts, and instead of disclosing who
  Garratt Skinner is, and the obvious swindle of which Hine is the victim,
  takes Garratt Skinner into his confidence. What happened at the interview
  between Mr. Jarvice and Garratt Skinner in London the subsequent facts make
  plain. At Jarvice's instigation the plot to swindle Walter Hine becomes a
  cold-blooded plan to murder him. That plan has been twice frustrated, once by
  me in Dorsetshire, and a second time by Sylvia."</p>

  <p>So far the story worked out naturally, logically. But there remained two
  questions. For what reason did Mr. Jarvice make Walter Hine an allowance? And
  how would Walter Hine's death profit him? Chayne pondered over those two
  questions and then the truth flashed upon him. He remembered how the
  subaltern had been extracted from his difficulties. Money had been raised by
  a life insurance. Again Chayne ranged his facts in order.</p>

  <p>"Walter Hine is the heir to great wealth. But he has no money now. Mr.
  Jarvice makes him an allowance, the money to be repaid with a handsome
  interest on the grandfather's death. But in order to insure Jarvice from
  loss, if Walter Hine should die first, Walter Hine's life is insured for a
  large sum. Thus Mr. Jarvice makes his position tenable should his conduct be
  called in question. Having insured Walter Hine's life, he arranges with
  Garratt Skinner to murder him. The attempt failed the first time, the slower
  method is then adopted by Garratt Skinner, and as a result comes the
  impatient telegram: 'What are you waiting for? Hurry up!'"</p>

  <p>The case was thus so far clear. But anxiety remained. Was the plan
  abandoned altogether, now that Sylvia had stood bravely up and warned her
  father that she would not keep silent? So certainly Sylvia thought. But then
  she did not know all that Chayne knew. It seemed that she had not understood
  the incident of the lighted window. Nor was Chayne surprised. For she was
  unaware of what was in Chayne's eyes the keystone of the whole argument. She
  did not know that her father had worked as a convict in the Portland
  quarries.</p>

  <p>"So they are abroad together, your father and Walter Hine," said Chayne,
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" replied Sylvia, with a smile. "Guess where they are now!" and she
  turned to him with a tender look upon her face which he did not
  understand.</p>

  <p>"I can't guess."</p>

  <p>"At Chamonix!"</p>

  <p>She saw her lover flinch, his face grow white, his eyes stare in horror.
  And she wondered. For her the little town, overtopped by its tumbled
  glittering fields of snow and tall rock spires was a place apart. She
  cherished it in her memories, keeping clear and distinct the windings of its
  streets, where they narrowed, where they broadened into open spaces; yet all
  the while her thoughts transformed it, and made of its mere stones and bricks
  a tiny city magical with light and grace. For while she stayed in it her
  happiness had dawned and she saw it always roseate with that dawn. It seemed
  to her that plots and thoughts of harm could there hardly outlive one starlit
  night, one sunlit day. Had she mapped out her father's itinerary, thither and
  nowhere else would she have sent him.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid?" she asked. "Hilary, why?"</p>

  <p>Chayne did not answer her question. He was minded to spare her, even as
  she had spared him. He talked of other things until the restaurant grew empty
  and the waiters began to turn out the lights as a hint to these two
  determined loiterers. Then in the darkness, for now there was but one light
  left, and that at a little distance from their table, Chayne leaned forward
  and turning to Sylvia, as they sat side by side:</p>

  <p>"You have been happy to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Very," she answered, and there was a thrill of joyousness in her clear,
  low voice, as though her heart sang within her. Her eyes rested on his with
  pride. "No man could quite understand," she said.</p>

  <p>"Well then, why should we wait longer, Sylvia?" he said. "We have waited
  long enough, my dear. We have after all no one but ourselves to please. I
  should like our marriage to take place as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>Sylvia answered him without affectation.</p>

  <p>"I, too," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow then! I'll get a special license to-morrow morning, and make
  the arrangements. We can go away together at once."</p>

  <p>Sylvia smiled, and the smile deepened into a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Where shall we go, Hilary?" she cried. "To some perfect place."</p>

  <p>"To Chamonix," he answered. "That was where we first met. There could be
  no better place. We can just go and tell your father what we have done and
  then go up into the hills."</p>

  <p>It was well done. He spoke without wakening Sylvia's suspicions. She had
  never understood the episode of the lighted window; she did not know that her
  father was Gabriel Strood, of whose exploits in the Alps she had read; she
  believed that all danger to Walter Hine was past. Chayne on the other hand
  knew that hardly at any time could Hine have stood in greater peril. To
  Chamonix he must go; and to Chamonix he must take Sylvia too. For by the time
  when he could reach Chamonix, he might already be too late. There might be
  publicity, inquiries, and for Garratt Skinner ruin, and worse than ruin.
  Would Sylvia let her lover share the dishonor of her name? He knew very
  surely she would not. Therefore he would have the marriage.</p>

  <p>"By the way," he said, as he draped her cloak about her shoulders. "You
  have that telegram from Jarvice?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That's good," he said. "It might be useful."</p>

  <br>
  REVAILLOUD REVISITED</h2>

  <p class="first">Never that familiar journey across France seemed to Chayne
  so slow. Would he be in time? Would he arrive too late? The throb of the
  wheels beat out the questions in a perpetual rhythm and gave him no answer.
  The words of Jarvice's telegram were ever present in his mind, and grew more
  sinister, the more he thought upon them. "What are you waiting for? Hurry
  up!" Once, when the train stopped over long as it seemed to him he muttered
  the words aloud and then glanced in alarm at his wife, lest perchance she had
  overheard them. But she had not. She was remembering her former journey along
  this very road. Then it had been night; now it was day. Then she had been
  used to seek respite from her life in the shelter of her dreams. Now the
  dreams were of no use, since what was real made them by comparison so pale
  and thin. The blood ran strong and joyous in her veins to-day; and looking at
  her, Chayne sent up his prayers that they might not arrive in Chamonix too
  late. To him as to her Walter Hine was a mere puppet, a thing without
  importance &mdash; so long as he lived. But he must live. Dead, he threatened
  ruin and dishonor, and since from the beginning Sylvia and he had shared
  &mdash; for so she would have it &mdash; had shared in the effort to save
  this life, it would be well for them, he thought that they should not
  fail.</p>

  <p>The long hot day drew to an end, and at last from the platform at the end
  of the electric train they saw the snow-fields lift toward the soaring peaks,
  and the peaks purple with the after glow stand solitary and beautiful against
  the evening sky.</p>

  <p>"At last!" said Sylvia, with a catch in her breath, and the clasp of her
  hand tightened upon her husband's arm. But Chayne was remembering certain
  words once spoken to him in a garden of Dorsetshire, by a man who lay idly in
  a hammock and stared up between the leaves. "On the most sunny day, the
  mountains hold in their recesses mystery and death."</p>

  <p>"You know where your father is staying?" Chayne asked.</p>

  <p>"He wrote from the Hôtel de l'Arve," Sylvia replied.</p>

  <p>"We will stay at Couttet's and walk over to see him this evening," said
  Chayne, and after dinner they strolled across the little town. But at the
  Hôtel de l'Arve they found neither Garratt Skinner nor his friend, Walter
  Hine.</p>

  <p>"Only the day before yesterday," said the proprietor, "they started for
  the mountains. Always they make expeditions."</p>

  <p>Chayne drew no satisfaction from that statement. Garratt Skinner and his
  friend would make many expeditions from which both men would return in
  safety. Garratt Skinner was no blunderer. And when at the last he returned
  alone with some flawless story of an accident in which his friend had lost
  his life, no one would believe but that here was another mishap, and another
  name to be added to the Alpine death-roll.</p>

  <p>"To what mountain have they gone?" Chayne asked.</p>

  <p>"To no mountain to-day. They cross the Col du Géant, monsieur, to
  Courmayeur. But after that I do not know."</p>

  <p>"Oh, into Italy," said Chayne, in relief. So far there was no danger. The
  Col du Géant, that great pass between France and Italy across the range of
  Mont Blanc, was almost a highway. There would be too many parties abroad
  amongst its ice séracs on these days of summer for any deed which needed
  solitude and secrecy.</p>

  <p>"When do you expect them back?"</p>

  <p>"In five days, monsieur; not before." And at this reply Chayne's fears
  were all renewed. For clearly the expedition was not to end with the passage
  of the Col du Géant. There was to be a sequel, perhaps some hazardous ascent,
  some expedition at all events which Garratt Skinner had not thought fit to
  name.</p>

  <p>"They took guides, I suppose," he said.</p>

  <p>"One guide, monsieur, and a porter. Monsieur need not fear. For Monsieur
  Skinner is of an excellence prodigious."</p>

  <p>"My father!" exclaimed Sylvia, in surprise. "I never knew."</p>

  <p>"What guide?" asked Chayne.</p>

  <p>"Pierre Delouvain"; and so once again Chayne's fears were allayed. He
  turned to Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"A good name, sweetheart. I never climbed with him, but I know him by
  report. A prudent man, as prudent as he is skilful. He would run no
  risks."</p>

  <p>The name gave him indeed greater comfort than even his words expressed.
  Delouvain's mere presence would prevent the commission of any crime. His
  great strength would not be needed to hinder it. For he would be there, to
  bear witness afterward. Chayne was freed from the dread which during the last
  two days had oppressed him. Perhaps after all Sylvia was right and the plot
  was definitely abandoned. Chayne knew very well that Garratt Skinner's
  passion for the Alps was a deep and real one. Perhaps it was that alone which
  had brought him back to Chamonix. Perhaps one day in the train, traveling
  northward from Italy, he had looked from the window and seen the slopes of
  Monte Rosa white in the sun &mdash; white with the look of white velvet
  &mdash; and all the last twenty years had fallen from him like a cloak, and
  he had been drawn back as with chains to the high playground of his youth.
  Chayne could very well understand that possibility, and eased of his fears he
  walked away with Sylvia back to the open square in the middle of the town.
  Darkness had come, and both stopped with one accord and looked upward to the
  massive barrier of hills. The rock peaks stood sharply up against the clear,
  dark sky, the snow-slopes glimmered faintly like a pale mist, and incredibly
  far, incredibly high, underneath a bright and dancing star, shone a dim and
  rounded whiteness, the snow-cap of Mont Blanc.</p>

  <p>"A year ago," said Sylvia, drawing a breath and bethinking her of the
  black shadows which during those twelve months had lain across her path.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a year ago we were here," said Chayne. The little square was
  thronged, the hotels and houses were bright with lights, and from here and
  from there music floated out upon the air, the light and lilting melodies of
  the day. "Sylvia, you see the café down the street there by the bridge?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"A year ago, on just such a night as this, I sat with my guide, Michel
  Revailloud. I was going to cross the Col Dolent on the morrow. He had made
  his last ascent. We were not very cheerful. And he gave me as a parting
  present the one scrap of philosophy his life had taught him. He said: 'Take
  care that when the time comes for you to get old that you have some one to
  share your memories. Take care that when you go home in the end, there shall
  be some one waiting in the room and the lamp lit against your coming.'"</p>

  <p>Sylvia pressed against her side the hand which he had slipped through her
  arm.</p>

  <p>"But he did more than give advice," Chayne continued, "for as he went away
  to his home in the little village of Les Praz-Conduits, just across the
  fields, he passed Couttet's Hotel and saw you under the lamp talking to a
  guide he knew. You were making your arrangements to ascend the Charmoz. But
  he dissuaded you."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"He convinced you that your first mountain should be the Aiguille
  d'Argentière. He gave you no doubt many reasons, but not the real one which
  he had in his thoughts."</p>

  <p>Sylvia looked at Chayne in surprise.</p>

  <p>"He sent you to the Aiguille d'Argentière, because he knew that so you and
  I would meet at the Pavilion de Lognan."</p>

  <p>"But he had never spoken to me until that night," exclaimed Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Yet he had noticed you. When I went up to fetch down my friend Lattery,
  you were standing on the hotel step. You said to me, 'I am sorry.' Michel
  heard you speak, and that evening talked of you. He had the thought that you
  and I were matched."</p>

  <p>Sylvia looked back to the night before her first ascent. She pictured to
  herself the old guide coming down the narrow street and out of the darkness
  into the light of the lamp above the doorway. She recalled how he had stopped
  at the sight of her, how cunningly he had spoken. He had desired that her
  last step on to her first summit should bring to her eyes and soul a
  revelation which no length of after years could dim. That was the argument,
  and it was just the argument which would prevail with her.</p>

  <p>"So it was his doing," she cried, with a laugh, and at once grew serious,
  dwelling, as lovers will, upon the small accident which had brought them
  together, and might so easily never have occurred. An unknown guide speaks to
  her in a doorway, and lo! for her the world is changed, dark years come to an
  end, the pathway broadens to a road; she walks not alone. Whatever the future
  may hold &mdash; she walks not alone. Suppose there had been no lamp above
  the doorway! Suppose there had been a lamp and she not there! Suppose the
  guide had passed five minutes sooner or five minutes later!</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hilary!" she cried, and put the thought from her.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking," he said, "that if you were not tired we might walk
  across the fields to Michel's house. He would, I think, be very happy if we
  did."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later they knocked upon Michel's door. Michel Revailloud
  opened it himself and stood for a moment peering at the dim figures in the
  darkness of the road.</p>

  <p>"It is I, Michel," said Chayne, and at the sound of his voice Michel
  Revailloud drew him with a cry of welcome into the house.</p>

  <p>"So you have come back to Chamonix, monsieur! That is good"; and he looked
  his "monsieur" over from head to foot and shook him warmly by the hand. "Ah,
  you have come back!"</p>

  <p>"And not alone, Michel," said Chayne.</p>

  <p>Revailloud turned to the door and saw Sylvia standing there. She was on
  the threshold and the light reached to her. Sylvia moved into the low-roofed
  room. It was a big, long room, bare, and with a raftered ceiling, and since
  one oil lamp lighted it, it was full of shadows. To Chayne it had a lonely
  and a dreary look. He thought of his own house in Sussex and of the evening
  he had passed there, thinking it just as lonely. He felt perhaps at this
  moment, more than at any, the value of the great prize which he had won. He
  took her hand in his, and, turning to Michel, said simply:</p>

  <p>"We are married, Michel. We reached Chamonix only this evening. You are
  the first of our friends to know of our marriage."</p>

  <p>Michel's face lighted up. He looked from one to the other of his visitors
  and nodded his head once or twice. Then he blew his nose vigorously. "But I
  let you stand!" he cried, in a voice that shook a little, and he bustled
  about pushing chairs forward, and of a sudden stopped. He came forward to
  Sylvia very gravely and held out his hand. She put her hand into his great
  palm.</p>

  <p>"Madame, I will not pretend to you that I am not greatly moved. This is a
  great happiness to me," he said with simplicity. He made no effort to hide
  either the tears which filled his eyes or the unsteadiness of his voice. "I
  am very glad for the sake of Monsieur Chayne. But I know him well. We have
  been good friends for many a year, madame."</p>

  <p>"I know, Michel," she said.</p>

  <p>"And I can say therefore with confidence I am very glad for your sake too.
  I am also very glad for mine. A minute ago I was sitting here alone &mdash;
  now you are both here and together. Madame, it was a kind thought which
  brought you both here to me at once."</p>

  <p>"To whom else should we come?" said Sylvia with a smile, "since it was
  you, Michel, who would not let me ascend the Aiguille des Charmoz when I
  wanted to."</p>

  <p>Michel was taken aback for a moment; then his wrinkled and weatherbeaten
  face grew yet more wrinkled and he broke into a low and very pleasant
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"Since my diplomacy has been so successful, madame, I will not deny it.
  From the first moment when I heard you with your small and pretty voice say
  on the steps of the hotel 'I am sorry' to my patron in his great distress,
  and when I saw your face, too thoughtful for one so young, I thought it would
  be a fine thing if you and he could come together. In youth to be lonely
  &mdash; what is it? You slip on your hat and your cloak and you go out. But
  when you are old, and your habits are settled, and you do not want to go out
  at nights to search for company, then it is as well to have a companion. And
  it is well to choose your companion in your youth, madame, so that you may
  have many recollections to talk over together when the good of life is
  chiefly recollection."</p>

  <p>He made his visitors sit down, fetched out a bottle of wine and offered
  them the hospitalities of his house, easily and naturally, like the true
  gentleman he was. It seemed to Chayne that he looked a little older, that he
  was a little more heavy in his gait, a little more troubled with his eyes
  than he had been last year. But at all events to-night he had the spirit, the
  good- humor of his youth. He talked of old exploits upon peaks then
  unclimbed, he brought out his guide's book, in which his messieurs had
  written down their names and the dates of the climbs, and the photographs
  which they had sent to him.</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"

    <img src="1300121h-images/RunningWater7.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"There are many photographs of men grown famous, madame," he said,
  proudly, "with whom I had the good fortune to climb when they and I and the
  Alps were all young together. But it is not only the famous who are
  interesting. Look, madame! Here is your husband's friend, Monsieur Lattery
  &mdash; a good climber but not always very sure on ice."</p>

  <p>"You always will say that, Michel," protested Chayne. "I never knew a man
  so obstinate."</p>

  <p>Michel Revailloud smiled and said to Sylvia:</p>

  <p>"I knew he would spring out on me. Never say a word against Monsieur
  Lattery if you would keep friends with Monsieur Chayne. See, I give you good
  advice in return for your kindness in visiting an old man. Nevertheless," and
  he dropped his voice in a pretence of secrecy and nodded emphatically: "It is
  true. Monsieur Lattery was not always sure on ice. And here, madame, is the
  portrait of one whose name is no doubt known to you in London &mdash;
  Professor Kenyon."</p>

  <p>Sylvia, who was turning over the leaves of the guide's little book, looked
  up at the photograph.</p>

  <p>"It was taken many years ago," she said.</p>

  <p>"Twenty or twenty-five years ago," said Michel, with a shrug of the
  shoulders, "when he and I and the Alps were young."</p>

  <p>Chayne began quickly to look through the photographs outspread upon the
  table. If Kenyon's portrait was amongst Revailloud's small treasures, there
  might be another which he had no wish for his wife to see, the portrait of
  the man who climbed with Kenyon, who was Kenyon's "John Lattery." There might
  well be the group before the Monte Rosa Hotel in Zermatt which he himself had
  seen in Kenyon's rooms. Fortunately however, or so it seemed to him, Sylvia
  was engrossed in Michel's little book.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap23"
     id="chap23"><small>CHAPTER 23</small></a><br>
  <br>
  MICHEL REVAILLOUD'S FÜHRBUCH</h2>

  <p class="first">The book indeed was of far more interest to her than the
  portrait of any mountaineer. It had a romance, a glamour of its own. It was
  just a little note- book with blue-lined pages and an old dark-red soiled
  leather cover which could fit into the breast pocket and never be noticed
  there. But it went back to the early days of mountaineering when even the
  passes were not all discovered and many of them were still uncrossed, when
  mythical peaks were still gravely allotted their positions and approximate
  heights in the maps; and when the easy expedition of the young lady of to-day
  was the difficult achievement of the explorer. It was to the early part of
  the book to which she turned. Here she found first ascents of which she had
  read with her heart in her mouth, ascents since made famous, simply recorded
  in the handwriting of the men who had accomplished them &mdash; the dates,
  the hours of starting and returning, a word or two perhaps about the
  condition of the snow, a warm tribute to Michel Revailloud and the
  signatures. The same names recurred year after year, and often the same hand
  recorded year after year attempts on one particular pinnacle, until at the
  last, perhaps after fifteen or sixteen failures, weather and snow and the
  determination of the climbers conspired together, and the top was
  reached.</p>

  <p>"Those were the grand days," cried Sylvia. "Michel, you must be proud of
  this book."</p>

  <p>"I value it very much, madame," he said, smiling at her enthusiasm. Michel
  was a human person; and to have a young girl with a lovely face looking at
  him out of her great eyes in admiration, and speaking almost in a voice of
  awe, was flattery of a soothing kind. "Yes, many have offered to buy it from
  me at a great price &mdash; Americans and others. But I would not part with
  it. It is me. And when I am inclined to grumble, as old people will, and to
  complain that my bones ache too sorely, I have only to turn over the pages of
  that book to understand that I have no excuse to grumble. For I have the
  proof there that my life has been very good to live. No, I would not part
  with that little book."</p>

  <p>Sylvia turned over the pages slowly, naming now this mountain, now that,
  and putting a question from time to time as to some point in a climb which
  she remembered to have read and concerning which the narrative had not been
  clear. And then a cry of surprise burst from her lips.</p>

  <p>Chayne had just assured himself that there was no portrait of Gabriel
  Strood amongst those spread out upon the table.</p>

  <p>"What is it, madame?" asked Michel.</p>

  <p>Sylvia did not answer, but stared in bewilderment at the open page. Chayne
  saw the book which she was reading and knew that his care lest she should
  come across her father's portrait was of no avail. He crossed round behind
  her chair and looked over her shoulder. There on the page in her father's
  handwriting was the signature: "Gabriel Strood."</p>

  <p>Sylvia raised her face to Hilary's, and before she could put her question
  he answered it quietly with a nod of the head.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is so," he said.</p>

  <p>"You knew?"</p>

  <p>"I have known for a long time," he replied.</p>

  <p>Sylvia was lost in wonder. Yet there was no doubt in her mind. Gabriel
  Strood, of whom she had made a hero, whose exploits she knew almost by heart,
  had suffered from a physical disability which might well have kept the most
  eager mountaineer to the level. It was because of his mastery over his
  disability that she had set him so high in her esteem. Well, there had been a
  day when her father had tramped across the downs to Dorchester and had come
  back lame and in spite of his lameness had left his companions behind. Other
  trifles recurred to her memory. She had found him reading "The Alps in 1864,"
  and yes &mdash; he had tried to hide from her the title of the book. On their
  first meeting he had understood at once when she had spoken to him of the
  emotion which her first mountain peak had waked in her. And before that
  &mdash; yes, her guide had cried aloud to her, "You remind me of Gabriel
  Strood." She owed it to him that she had turned to the Alps as to her
  heritage, and that she had brought to them an instinctive knowledge. Her
  first feeling was one of sheer pride in her father. Then the doubts began to
  thicken. He called himself Garratt Skinner.</p>

  <p>"Why? But why?" she cried, impulsively, and Chayne, still leaning on her
  chair, pressed her arm with his hand and warned her to be silent.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you afterward," he said, quietly, and then he suddenly drew
  himself upright. The movement was abrupt like the movement of a man
  thoroughly startled &mdash; more startled even than she had been by the
  unexpected sight of her father's handwriting. She looked up into his face. He
  was staring at the open page of Michel's book. She turned back to it herself
  and saw nothing which should so trouble him. Over Gabriel Strood's signature
  there were just these words written in his hand and nothing more:</p>

  <p>"Mont Blanc by the Brenva route. July, 1868."</p>

  <p>Yet it was just that sentence which had so startled Hilary. Gabriel Strood
  <i>had</i> then climbed Mont Blanc from the Italian side &mdash; up from the
  glacier to the top of the great rock-buttress, then along the world-famous
  ice-arête, thin as a knife edge, and to right and left precipitous as a wall,
  and on the far side above the ice-ridge up the hanging glaciers and the
  ice-cliffs to the summit of the Corridor. From the Italian side of the range
  of Mont Blanc! And the day before yesterday Gabriel Strood had crossed with
  Walter Hine to Italy, bound upon some expedition which would take five days,
  five days at the least.</p>

  <p>It was to the Brenva ascent of Mont Blanc that Garratt Skinner was leading
  Walter Hine! The thought flashed upon Chayne swift as an inspiration and as
  convincing. Chayne was sure. The Brenva route! It was to this climb Garratt
  Skinner's thoughts had perpetually recurred during that one summer afternoon
  in the garden in Dorsetshire, when he had forgotten his secrecy and spoken
  even with his enemy of the one passion they had in common. Chayne worked out
  the dates and they fitted in with his belief. Two days ago Garratt Skinner
  started to cross the Col du Géant. He would sleep very likely in the hut on
  the Col, and go down the next morning to Courmayeur and make his arrangements
  for the Brenva climb. On the third day, to-day, he would set out with Walter
  Hine and sleep at the gîte on the rocks in the bay to the right of the great
  ice-fall of the Brenva glacier. To-morrow he would ascend the buttress,
  traverse the ice-ridge with Walter Hine &mdash; perhaps &mdash; yes, only
  perhaps &mdash; and at that thought Chayne's heart stood still. And even if
  he did, there were the hanging ice-cliffs above, and yet another day would
  pass before any alarm at his absence would be felt. Surely, it would be the
  Brenva route!</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner himself would run great risk upon this hazardous
  expedition &mdash; that was true. But Chayne knew enough of the man to be
  assured that he would not hesitate on that account. The very audacity of the
  exploit marked it out as Gabriel Strood's. Moreover, there would be no other
  party on the Brenva ridge to spy upon his actions. There was just one fact so
  far as Chayne could judge to discredit his inspiration &mdash; the
  inconvenient presence of a guide.</p>

  <p>"Do you know a guide Delouvain, Michel?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, yes! A good name, monsieur, and borne by a man worthy of it."</p>

  <p>"So I thought," said Chayne. "Pierre Delouvain," and Michel laughed
  scornfully and waved the name away.</p>

  <p>"Pierre! No, indeed!" he cried. "Monsieur, never engage Pierre Delouvain
  for your guide. I speak solemnly. Joseph &mdash; yes, and whenever you can
  secure him. I thought you spoke of him. But Pierre, he is a cousin who lives
  upon Joseph's name, a worthless fellow, a drunkard. Monsieur, never trust
  yourself or any one whom you hold dear with Pierre Delouvain!"</p>

  <p>Chayne's last doubt was dispelled. Garratt Skinner had laid his plans for
  the Brenva route. Somewhere on that long and difficult climb the accident was
  to take place. The very choice of a guide was in itself a confirmation of
  Chayne's fears. It was a piece of subtlety altogether in keeping with Garratt
  Skinner. He had taken a bad and untrustworthy guide on one of the most
  difficult expeditions in the range of Mont Blanc. Why, he would be asked? And
  the answer was ready. He had confused Pierre Delouvain with Joseph, his
  cousin, as no doubt many another man had done before. Did not Pierre live on
  that very confusion? The answer was not capable of refutation.</p>

  <p>Chayne was in despair. Garratt Skinner had started two days before from
  Chamonix, was already, now, at this moment, asleep, with his unconscious
  victim at his side, high up on the rocks of the upper Brenva glacier. There
  was no way to hinder him &mdash; no way unless God helped. He asked abruptly
  of Michel:</p>

  <p>"Have you climbed this season, Michel?"</p>

  <p>Michel laughed grimly.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, yes, to the Montanvert, monsieur. And beyond &mdash; yes, beyond,
  to the Jardin."</p>

  <p>Chayne broke in upon his bitter humor.</p>

  <p>"I want the best guide in Chamonix. I want him at once. I must start by
  daylight."</p>

  <p>Michel glanced up in surprise. But what he saw in Chayne's face stopped
  all remonstrance.</p>

  <p>"For what ascent, monsieur?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The Brenva route."</p>

  <p>"Madame will not go!"</p>

  <p>"No, I go alone. I must go quickly. There is very much at stake. I beg you
  to help me."</p>

  <p>In answer Michel took his hat down from a peg, and while he did so Chayne
  turned quickly to his wife. She had risen from her chair, but she had not
  interrupted him, she had asked no questions, she had uttered no prayer. She
  stood now, waiting upon him with a quiet and beautiful confidence which
  deeply stirred his heart.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sweetheart!" he said, quietly. "You can trust. I thank you,"
  and he added, gravely: "Whatever happens &mdash; you and I &mdash; there is
  no altering that."</p>

  <p>Michel opened the door.</p>

  <p>"I will walk with you into Chamonix, and I will bring the best guides I
  can find to your hotel."</p>

  <p>They passed out, and crossed the fields quickly to Chamonix.</p>

  <p>"Do you go to your hotel, monsieur," said Revailloud, "and leave the
  choice to me. I must go about it quietly. If you were to come with me, we
  should have to choose the first two guides upon the rota and that would not
  do for the Brenva climb."</p>

  <p>He left them at the door of the hotel and went off upon his errand. Sylvia
  turned at once to Hilary; her face was very pale, her voice shook.</p>

  <p>"You will tell me everything now. Something terrible has happened. No
  doubt you feared it. You came to Chamonix because you feared it, and now you
  know that it has happened."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Chayne. "I hid it from you even as you spared me your bad news
  all this last year."</p>

  <p>"Tell me now, please. If it is to be 'you and I,' as you said just now,
  you will tell me."</p>

  <p>Chayne led the way into the garden, and drawing a couple of chairs apart
  from the other visitors told her all that he knew and she did not. He
  explained the episode of the lighted window, solved for her the riddle of her
  father's friendship for Walter Hine, and showed her the reason for this
  expedition to the summit of Mont Blanc.</p>

  <p>She uttered one low cry of horror. "Murder!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"To think that we are two days behind, that even now they are sleeping on
  the rocks, <i>he</i> and Walter Hine, sleeping quite peacefully and quietly.
  Oh, it's horrible!" he cried, beating his hands upon his forehead in despair,
  and then he broke off. He saw that Sylvia was sitting with her hands covering
  her face, while every now and then a shudder shook her and set her
  trembling.</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry, Sylvia," he cried. "Oh, my dear, I had so hoped we should
  be in time. I would have spared you this knowledge if I could. Who knows? We
  may be still in time," and as he spoke Michel entered the garden with one
  other man and came toward him.</p>

  <p>"Henri Simond!" said Michel, presenting his companion. "You will know that
  name. Simond has just come down from the Grépon, monsieur. He will start with
  you at daylight."</p>

  <p>Chayne looked at Simond. He was of no more than the middle height, but
  broad of shoulder, deep of chest, and long of arm. His strength was well
  known in Chamonix &mdash; as well known as his audacity.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad that you can come, Simond," said Chayne. "You are the very
  man;" and then he turned to Michel. "But we should have another guide. I need
  two men."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Michel. "Three men are needed for that climb," and Chayne left
  him to believe that it was merely for the climb that he needed another guide.
  "But there is André Droz already at Courmayeur," he continued. "His patron
  was to leave him there to-day. A telegram can be sent to him to- morrow
  bidding him wait. If he has started, we shall meet him to-morrow on the Col
  du Géant. And Droz, monsieur, is the man for you. He is quick, as quick as
  you and Simond. The three of you together will go well. As for to- morrow,
  you will need no one else. But if you do, monsieur, I will go with you."</p>

  <p>"There is no need, Michel," replied Chayne, gratefully, and thereupon
  Sylvia plucked him by the sleeve.</p>

  <p>"I must go with you to-morrow, Hilary," she pleaded, wistfully. "Oh, you
  won't leave me here. Let me come with you as far as possible. Let me cross to
  Italy. I will go quick. If I get tired, you shall not know."</p>

  <p>"It will be a long day, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"It cannot be so long as the day I should pass waiting here."</p>

  <p>She wrung her hands as she spoke. The light from a lamp fixed in the hotel
  wall fell upon her upturned face. It was white, her lips trembled, and in her
  eyes Chayne saw again the look of terror which he had hoped was gone forever.
  "Oh, please," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, and he turned again to Simond. "At two o'clock then. My
  wife will go, so bring a mule. We can leave it at the Montanvert."</p>

  <p>The guides tramped from the garden. Chayne led his wife toward the hotel,
  slipping his arm through hers.</p>

  <p>"You must get some sleep, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hilary," she cried. "I shall bring shame on you. We should never have
  married," and her voice broke in a sob.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" he replied. "Never say that, my dear, never think it! Sleep! You
  will want your strength to-morrow."</p>

  <p>But Sylvia slept little, and before the time she was ready with her ice-
  ax in her hand. At two o'clock they came out from the hotel in the twilight
  of the morning. There were two men there.</p>

  <p>"Ah! you have come to see us off, Michel," said Chayne.</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur, I bring my mule," said Revailloud, with a smile, and he
  helped Sylvia to mount it. "To lead mules to the Montanvert &mdash; is not
  that my business? Simond has a rope," he added, as he saw Chayne sling a coil
  across his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"We may need an extra one," said Chayne, and the party moved off upon its
  long march. At the Montanvert hotel, on the edge of the Mer de Glace, Sylvia
  descended from her mule, and at once the party went down on to the ice.</p>

  <p>"Au revoir!" shouted Michel from above, and he stood and watched them,
  until they passed out of his sight. Sylvia turned and waved her hand to him.
  But he made no answering sign. For his eyes were no longer good.</p>

  <p>"He is very kind," said Sylvia. "He understood that there was some
  trouble, and while he led the mule he sought to comfort me," and then between
  a laugh and a sob she added: "You will never guess how. He offered to give me
  his little book with all the signatures &mdash; the little book which means
  so much to him."</p>

  <p>It was the one thing which he had to offer her, as Sylvia understood, and
  always thereafter she remembered him with a particular tenderness. He had
  been a good friend to her, asking nothing and giving what he had. She saw him
  often in the times which were to come, but when she thought of him, she
  pictured him as on that early morning standing on the bluff of cliff by the
  Montanvert with the reins of his mule thrown across his arm, and straining
  his old eyes to hold his friends in view.</p>

  <p>Later during that day amongst the séracs of the Col du Géant, Simond
  uttered a shout, and a party of guides returning to Chamonix changed their
  course toward him. Droz was amongst the number, and consenting at once to the
  expedition which was proposed to him, he tied himself on to the rope.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the Brenva ascent?" Chayne asked of him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur. I have crossed Mont Blanc once that way. I shall be very
  glad to go again. We shall be the first to cross for two years. If only the
  weather holds."</p>

  <p>"Do you doubt that?" asked Chayne, anxiously. The morning had broken
  clear, the day was sunny and cloudless.</p>

  <p>"I think there may be wind to-morrow," he replied, raising his face and
  judging by signs unappreciable to other than the trained eyes of a guide.
  "But we will try, eh, monsieur?" he cried, recovering his spirits. "We will
  try. We will be the first on the Brenva ridge for two years."</p>

  <p>But there Chayne knew him to be wrong. There was another party somewhere
  on the great ridge at this moment. "Had <i>it</i> happened?" he asked
  himself. "How was it to happen?" What kind of an accident was it to be which
  could take place with a guide however worthless, and which would leave no
  suspicion resting on Garratt Skinner? There would be no cutting of the rope.
  Of that he felt sure. That method might do very well for a melodrama, but
  actually &mdash; no! Garratt Skinner would have a better plan than that. And
  indeed he had, a better plan and a simpler one, a plan which not merely would
  give to any uttered suspicion the complexion of malignancy, but must even
  bring Mr. Garratt Skinner honor and great praise. But no idea of the plan
  occurred either to Sylvia or to Chayne as all through that long hot day they
  toiled up the ice- fall of the Col du Géant and over the passes. It was
  evening before they came to the pastures, night before they reached
  Courmayeur.</p>

  <p>There Chayne found full confirmation of his fears. In spite of effort to
  dissuade them, Garratt Skinner, Walter Hine and Pierre Delouvain had started
  yesterday for the Brenva climb. They had taken porters with them as far as
  the sleeping-place upon the glacier rocks. The porters had returned. Chayne
  sent for them.</p>

  <p>"Yes," they said. "At half past two this morning, the climbing party
  descended from the rocks on to the ice-fall of the glacier. They should be at
  the hut at the Grands Mulets now, on the other side of the mountain, if not
  already in Chamonix. Perhaps monsieur would wish for porters to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"No," said Chayne. "We mean to try the passage in one day"; and he turned
  to his guides. "I wish to start at midnight. It is important. We shall reach
  the glacier by five. Will you be ready?"</p>

  <p>And at midnight accordingly he set out by the light of a lantern. Sylvia
  stood outside the hotel and watched the flame diminish to a star, dance for a
  little while, and then go out. For her, as for all women, the bad hour had
  struck when there was nothing to do but to sit and watch and wait. Perhaps
  her husband, after all, was wrong, she said to herself, and repeated the
  phrase, hoping that repetition would carry conviction to her heart.</p>

  <p>But early on that morning Chayne had sure evidence that he was right. For
  as he, Simond and André Droz were marching in single file through the thin
  forest behind the chalets of La Brenva, a shepherd lad came running down
  toward them. He was so excited that he could hardly tell the story with which
  he was hurrying to Courmayeur. Only an hour before he had seen, high up on
  the Brenva ridge, a man waving a signal of distress. Both Simond and Droz
  discredited the story. The distance was too great; the sharpest eyes could
  not have seen so far. But Chayne believed, and his heart sank within him. The
  puppet and Garratt Skinner &mdash; what did they matter? But he turned his
  eyes down toward Courmayeur. It was Sylvia upon whom the blow would fall.</p>

  <p>"The story cannot be true," cried Simond.</p>

  <p>But Chayne bethought him of another day long ago, when a lad had burst
  into the hotel at Zermatt and told with no more acceptance for his story of
  an avalanche which he had seen fall from the very summit of the Matterhorn.
  Chayne looked at his watch. It was just four o'clock.</p>

  <p>"There has been an accident," he said. "We must hurry."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap24"
     id="chap24"><small>CHAPTER 24</small></a><br>
  <br>
  THE BRENVA RIDGE</h2>

  <p class="first">The peasant was right. He <i>had</i> seen a man waving a
  signal of distress on the slopes of Mont Blanc above the great buttress. And
  this is how the signal came to be waved.</p>

  <p>An hour before Chayne and Sylvia set out from Chamonix to cross the Col du
  Géant, and while it was yet quite dark, a spark glowed suddenly on an island
  of rocks set in the great white waste of the Brenva glacier. The spark was a
  fire lit by Pierre Delouvain. For Garratt Skinner's party had camped upon
  those rocks. The morning was cold, and one by one the porters, Garratt
  Skinner, and Walter Hine, gathered about the blaze. Overhead the stars
  glittered in a clear, dark sky. It was very still; no sound was heard at all
  but the movement in the camp; even on the glacier a thousand feet below,
  where all night long the avalanches had thundered, in the frost of the early
  morning there was silence.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner looked upward.</p>

  <p>"We shall have a good day," he said; and then he looked quickly toward
  Walter Hine. "How did you sleep, Wallie?"</p>

  <p>"Very little. The avalanches kept me awake. Besides, I slipped and fell a
  hundred times at the corner of the path," he said, with a shiver. "A hundred
  times I felt emptiness beneath my feet."</p>

  <p>He referred to a mishap of the day before. On the way to the gîte after
  the chalets and the wood are left behind, a little path leads along the rocks
  of the Mont de la Brenva high above the glacier. There are one or two awkward
  corners to pass where rough footsteps have been hewn in the rock. At one of
  these corners Walter Hine had slipped. His side struck the step; he would
  have dropped to the glacier, but Garratt Skinner had suddenly reached out a
  hand and saved him.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner's face changed.</p>

  <p>"You are not afraid," he said.</p>

  <p>"You think we can do it?" asked Hine, nervously, and Garratt Skinner
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"Ask Pierre Delouvain!" he said, and himself put the question. Pierre
  laughed in his turn.</p>

  <p>"Bah! I snap my fingers at the Brenva climb," said he. "We shall be in
  Chamonix to-night"; and Garratt Skinner translated the words to Walter
  Hine.</p>

  <p>Breakfast was prepared and eaten. Walter Hine was silent through the meal.
  He had not the courage to say that he was afraid; and Garratt Skinner played
  upon his vanity.</p>

  <p>"We shall be in Chamonix to-night. It will be a fine feather in your cap,
  Wallie. One of the historic climbs!"</p>

  <p>Walter Hine drew a deep breath. If only the day were over, and the party
  safe on the rough path through the woods on the other side of the mountain!
  But he held his tongue. Moreover, he had great faith in his idol and master,
  Garratt Skinner.</p>

  <p>"You saved my life yesterday," he said; and upon Garratt Skinner's face
  there came a curious smile. He looked steadily into the blaze of the fire and
  spoke almost as though he made an apology to himself.</p>

  <p>"I saw a man falling. I saw that I could save him. I did not think. My
  hand had already caught him."</p>

  <p>He looked up with a start. In the east the day was breaking, pale and
  desolate; the lower glacier glimmered into view beneath them; the gigantic
  amphitheater of hills which girt them in on three sides loomed out of the
  mists from aerial heights and took solidity and shape, westward the black and
  rugged Peuteret ridge, eastward the cliffs of Mont Maudit, and northward
  sweeping around the head of the glacier, the great ice-wall of Mont Blanc
  with its ruined terraces and inaccessible cliffs.</p>

  <p>"Time, Wallie," said Garratt Skinner, and he rose to his feet and called
  to Pierre Delouvain. "There are only three of us. We shall have to go
  quickly. We do not want to carry more food than we shall need. The rest we
  can send back with our blankets by the porters."</p>

  <p>Pierre Delouvain justified at once the ill words which had been spoken of
  him by Michel Revailloud. He thought only of the burden which through this
  long day he would have to carry on his back.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is right," he said. "We will take what we need for the day. To-
  night we shall be in Chamonix."</p>

  <p>And thus the party set off with no provision against that most probable of
  all mishaps &mdash; the chance that sunset might find them still upon the
  mountain side. Pierre Delouvain, being lazy and a worthless fellow, as
  Revailloud had said, agreed. But the suggestion had been made by Garratt
  Skinner. And Garratt Skinner was Gabriel Strood, who knew &mdash; none better
  &mdash; the folly of such light traveling.</p>

  <p>The rope was put on; Pierre Delouvain led the way, Walter Hine as the
  weakest of the party was placed in the middle, Garratt Skinner came last; the
  three men mounted by a snow-slope and a gully to the top of the rocks which
  supported the upper Brenva glacier.</p>

  <p>"That's our road, Wallie," said Garratt Skinner. He pointed to a great
  buttress of rock overlain here and there with fields of snow, which jutted
  out from the ice-wall of the mountain, descended steeply, bent to the west in
  a curve, and then pushed far out into the glacier as some great promontory
  pushes out into the sea. "Do you see a hump above the buttress, on the crest
  of the ridge and a little to the right? And to the right of the hump, a
  depression in the ridge? That's what they call the Corridor. Once we are
  there our troubles are over."</p>

  <p>But between the party and the buttress stretched the great ice-fall of the
  upper Brenva glacier. Crevassed, broken, a wilderness of towering séracs, it
  had the look of a sea in a gale whose breakers had been frozen in the very
  act of over toppling.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Pierre.</p>

  <p>"Keep the rope stretched tight, Wallie," said Garratt Skinner; and they
  descended into the furrows of that wild and frozen sea. The day's work had
  begun in earnest; and almost at once they began to lose time.</p>

  <p>Now it was a perilous strip of ice between unfathomable blue depths along
  which they must pass, as bridge-builders along their girders, yet without the
  bridge-builders' knowledge that at the end of the passage there was a further
  way. Now it was some crevasse into which they must descend, cutting their
  steps down a steep rib of ice; now it was a wall up which the leader must be
  hoisted on the shoulders of his companions, and even so as likely as not, his
  fingers could not reach the top, but hand holds and foot holds must be hewn
  with the ax till a ladder was formed. Now it was some crevasse gaping across
  their path; they must search this way and that for a firm snow-bridge by
  which to overpass it. It was difficult, as Pierre Delouvain discovered, to
  find a path through that tangled labyrinth without some knowledge of the
  glacier. For, only at rare times, when he stood high on a sérac, could he see
  his way for more than a few yards ahead. Pierre aimed straight for the foot
  of the buttress, working thus due north. And he was wrong. Garratt Skinner
  knew it, but said not a word. He stood upon insecure ledges and supported
  Delouvain upon his shoulders, and pushed him up with his ice-ax into
  positions which only involved the party in further difficulties. He took his
  life in his hands and risked it, knowing the better way. Yet all the while
  the light broadened, the great violet shadows crept down the slopes and
  huddled at the bases of the peaks. Then the peaks took fire, and suddenly
  along the dull white slopes of ice in front of them the fingers of the
  morning flashed in gold. Over the eastern rocks the sun had leaped into the
  sky. For a little while longer they advanced deeper into the entanglement,
  and when they were about half way across they came to a stop. They were on a
  tongue of ice which narrowed to a point; the point abutted against a
  perpendicular ice-wall thirty feet high. Nowhere was there any break in that
  wall, and at each side of the tongue the ice gaped in chasms.</p>

  <p>"We must go back," said Pierre. "I have forgotten the way."</p>

  <p>He had never known it. Seduced by a treble fee, he had assumed an
  experience which he did not possess. Garratt Skinner looked at his watch, and
  turning about led the party back for a little while. Then he turned to his
  right and said:</p>

  <p>"I think it might go in this direction," and lo! making steadily across
  some difficult ground, no longer in a straight line northward to Mont Blanc,
  but westward toward the cliffs of the Peuteret ridge under Garratt Skinner's
  lead, they saw a broad causeway of ice open before them. The causeway led
  them to steep slopes of snow, up which it was just possible to kick steps,
  and then working back again to the east they reached the foot of the great
  buttress on its western side just where it forms a right angle with the face
  of the mountain. Garratt Skinner once more looked at his watch. It had been
  half-past two when they had put on the rope, it was now close upon half-past
  six. They had taken four hours to traverse the ice-fall, and they should have
  taken only two and a half. Garratt Skinner, however, expressed no anxiety. On
  the contrary, one might have thought that he wished to lose time.</p>

  <p>"There's one of the difficulties disposed of," he said, cheerily. "You did
  very well, Wallie &mdash; very well. It was not altogether nice, was it? But
  you won't have to go back."</p>

  <p>Walter Hine had indeed crossed the glacier without complaint. There had
  been times when he had shivered, times when his heart within him had swelled
  with a longing to cry out, "Let us go back!" But he had not dared. He had
  been steadied across the narrow bridge with the rope, hauled up the ice-walls
  and let down again on the other side. But he had come through. He took some
  pride in the exploit as he gazed back from the top of the snow-slope across
  the tumult of ice to the rocks on which he had slipped. He had come through
  safely, and he was encouraged to go on.</p>

  <p>"We won't stop here, I think," said Garratt Skinner. They had already
  halted upon the glacier for a second breakfast. The sun was getting hot upon
  the slopes above, and small showers of snow and crusts of ice were beginning
  to shoot down the gullies of the buttress at the base of which they stood.
  "We will have a third breakfast when we are out of range." He called to
  Delouvain who was examining the face of the rock-buttress up which they must
  ascend to its crest and said: "It looks as if we should do well to work out
  to the right I think."</p>

  <p>The rocks were difficult, but their difficulty was not fully appreciated
  by Walter Hine. Nor did he understand the danger. There were gullies in which
  new snow lay in a thin crust over hard ice. He noticed that in those gullies
  the steps were cut deep into the ice below, that Garratt Skinner bade him not
  loiter, and that Pierre Delouvain in front made himself fast and drew in the
  rope with a particular care when it came to his turn to move. But he did not
  know that all that surface snow might peel off in a moment, and swish down
  the cliffs, sweeping the party from their feet. There were rounded rocks and
  slabs with no hold for hand or foot but roughness, roughness in the surface,
  and here and there a wrinkle. But the guide went first, as often as not
  pushed up by Garratt Skinner, and Walter Hine, like many another inefficient
  man before him, came up, like a bundle, on the rope afterward. Thus they
  climbed for three hours more. Walter Hine, nursed by gradually lengthening
  expeditions, was not as yet tired. Moreover the exhilaration of the air, and
  excitement, helped to keep fatigue aloof. They rested just below the crest of
  the ridge and took another meal.</p>

  <p>"Eat often and little. That's the golden rule," said Garratt Skinner. "No
  brandy, Wallie. Keep that in your flask!"</p>

  <p>Pierre Delouvain, however, followed a practice not unknown amongst
  Chamonix guides.</p>

  <p>"Absinthe is good on the mountains," said he.</p>

  <p>When they rose, the order of going was changed. Pierre Delouvain, who had
  led all the morning, now went last, and Garratt Skinner led. He led quickly
  and with great judgment or knowledge &mdash; Pierre Delouvain at the end of
  the rope wondered whether it was judgment or knowledge &mdash; and suddenly
  Walter Hine found himself standing on the crest with Garratt Skinner, and
  looking down the other side upon a glacier far below, which flows from the
  Mur de la Côte on the summit ridge of Mont Blanc into the Brenva glacier.</p>

  <p>"That's famous," cried Garratt Skinner, looking once more at his watch. He
  did not say that they had lost yet another hour upon the face of the
  buttress. It was now half past nine in the morning. "We are twelve thousand
  feet up, Wallie," and he swung to his left, and led the party up the ridge of
  the buttress.</p>

  <p>As they went along this ridge, Wallie Hine's courage rose. It was narrow
  but not steep, nor was it ice. It was either rock or snow in which steps
  could be kicked. He stepped out with a greater confidence. If this were all,
  the Brenva climb was a fraud, he exclaimed to himself in the vanity of his
  heart. Ahead of them a tall black tower stood up, hiding what lay beyond, and
  up toward this tower Garratt Skinner led quickly. He no longer spoke to his
  companions, he went forward, assured and inspiring assurance; he reached the
  tower, passed it and began to cut steps. His ax rang as it fell. It was ice
  into which he was cutting.</p>

  <p>This was the first warning which Walter Hine received. But he paid no heed
  to it. He was intent upon setting his feet in the steps; he found the rope
  awkward to handle and keep tight, his attention was absorbed in observing his
  proper distance. Moreover, in front of him the stalwart figure of Garratt
  Skinner blocked his vision. He went forward. The snow on which he walked
  became hard ice, and instead of sloping upward ran ahead almost in a
  horizontal line. Suddenly, however, it narrowed; Hine became conscious of
  appalling depths on either side of him; it narrowed with extraordinary
  rapidity; half a dozen paces behind him he had been walking on a broad smooth
  path; now he walked on the width of the top of a garden wall. His knees began
  to shake; he halted; he reached out vainly into emptiness for some support on
  which his shaking hands might clutch. And then in front of him he saw Garratt
  Skinner sit down and bestride the wall. Over Garratt Skinner's head, he now
  saw the path by which he needs must go. He was on the famous ice-ridge; and
  nothing so formidable, so terrifying, had even entered into his dreams during
  his sleep upon the rocks where he had bivouacked. It thinned to a mere sharp
  edge, a line without breadth of cold blue ice, and it stretched away through
  the air for a great distance until it melted suddenly into the face of the
  mountain. On the left hand an almost vertical slope of ice dropped to depths
  which Hine did not dare to fathom with his eyes; on the right there was no
  slope at all; a wall of crumbling snow descended from the edge straight as a
  weighted line. On neither side could the point of the ax be driven in to
  preserve the balance. Walter Hine uttered a whimpering cry:</p>

  <p>"I shall fall! I shall fall!"</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner, astride of the ridge, looked over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he cried, sharply. But Walter Hine dared not. He stood, all
  his courage gone, tottering on the narrow top of the wall, afraid to stoop,
  lest his knees should fail him altogether and his feet slip from beneath him.
  To bend down until his hands could rest upon the ice, and meanwhile to keep
  his feet &mdash; no, he could not do it. He stood trembling, his face
  distorted with fear, and his body swaying a little from side to side. Garratt
  Skinner called sharply to Pierre Delouvain.</p>

  <p>"Quick, Pierre."</p>

  <p>There was no time for Garratt Skinner to return; but he gathered himself
  together on the ridge, ready for a spring. Had Walter Hine toppled over, and
  swung down the length of the rope, as at any moment he might have done,
  Garratt Skinner was prepared. He would have jumped down the opposite side of
  the ice- arête, though how either he or Walter Hine could have regained the
  ridge he could not tell. Would any one of the party live to return to
  Courmayeur and tell the tale? But Garratt Skinner knew the risk he took, had
  counted it up long before ever he brought Walter Hine to Chamonix, and
  thought it worth while. He did not falter now. All through the morning,
  indeed, he had been taking risks, risks of which Walter Hine did not dream;
  with so firm and yet so delicate a step he had moved from crack to crack,
  from ice-step up to ice-step; with so obedient a response of his muscles, he
  had drawn himself up over the rounded rocks from ledge to ledge. He shouted
  again to Pierre Delouvain, and at the same moment began carefully to work
  backward along the ice-arête. Pierre, however, hurried; Walter Hine heard the
  guide's voice behind him, felt himself steadied by his hands. He stooped
  slowly down, knelt upon the wall, then bestrode it.</p>

  <p>"Now, forward," cried Skinner, and he pulled in the rope. "Forward. We
  cannot go back!"</p>

  <p>Hine clung to the ridge; behind him Pierre Delouvain sat down and held him
  about the waist. Slowly they worked themselves forward, while Garratt Skinner
  gathered in the rope in front. The wall narrowed as they advanced, became the
  merest edge which cut their hands as they clasped it. Hine closed his eyes,
  his head whirled, he was giddy, he felt sick. He stopped gripping the slope
  on both sides with his knees, clutching the sharp edge with the palms of his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"I can't go on! I can't," he cried, and he reeled like a novice on the
  back of a horse.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner worked back to him.</p>

  <p>"Put your arms about my waist, Wallie! Keep your eyes shut! You shan't
  fall."</p>

  <p>Walter Hine clung to him convulsively, Pierre Delouvain steadied Hine from
  behind, and thus they went slowly forward for a long while. Garratt Skinner
  gripped the edge with the palms of his hands &mdash; so narrow was the ridge
  &mdash; the fingers of one hand pointed down one slope, the fingers of the
  other down the opposite wall. Their legs dangled.</p>

  <p>At last Walter Hine felt Garratt Skinner loosening his clasped fingers
  from about his waist. Garratt Skinner stood up, uncoiled the rope, chipped a
  step or two in the ice and went boldly forward. For a yard or two further
  Walter Hine straddled on, and then Garratt Skinner cried to him:</p>

  <p>"Look up, Wallie. It's all over."</p>

  <p>Hine looked and saw Garratt Skinner standing upon a level space of snow in
  the side of the mountain. A moment later he himself was lying in the sun upon
  the level space. The famous ice-arête was behind them. Walter Hine looked
  back along it and shuddered. The thin edge of ice curving slightly downward,
  stretched away to the black rock-tower, in the bright sunlight a thing most
  beautiful, but most menacing and terrible. He seemed cut off by it from the
  world. They had a meal upon that level space, and while Hine rested, Pierre
  Delouvain cast off the rope and went ahead. He came back in a little while
  with a serious face.</p>

  <p>"Will it go?" asked Garratt Skinner.</p>

  <p>"It must," said Delouvain. "For we can never go back"; and suddenly
  alarmed lest the way should be barred in front as well as behind, Walter Hine
  turned and looked above him. His nerves were already shaken; at the sight of
  what lay ahead of him, he uttered a cry of despair.</p>

  <p>"It's no use," he cried. "We can never get up," and he flung himself upon
  the snow and buried his face in his arms. Garratt Skinner stood over him.</p>

  <p>"We must," he said. "Come! Look!"</p>

  <p>Walter Hine looked up and saw his companion dangling the face of his watch
  before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"We are late. It is now twelve o'clock. We should have left this spot two
  hours ago and more," he said, very gravely; and Pierre Delouvain exclaimed
  excitedly:</p>

  <p>"Certainly, monsieur, we must go on. It will not do to loiter now," and
  stooping down, he dragged rather than helped Walter Hine to his feet. The
  quiet gravity of Garratt Skinner and the excitement of Delouvain frightened
  Walter Hine equally. Some sense of his own insufficiency broke in at last
  upon him. His vanity peeled off from him, just at the moment when it would
  most have been of use. He had a glimpse of what he was &mdash; a poor, weak,
  inefficient thing.</p>

  <p>Above them the slopes stretched upward to a great line of towering ice-
  cliffs. Through and up those ice-cliffs a way had to be found. And at any
  moment, loosened by the sun, huge blocks and pinnacles might break from them
  and come thundering down. As it was, upon their right hand where the snow-
  fields fell steeply in a huge ice gully, between a line of rocks and the
  cliffs of Mont Maudit, the avalanches plunged and reverberated down to the
  Brenva glacier. Pierre Delouvain took the lead again, and keeping by the line
  of rocks the party ascended the steep snow-slopes straight toward the wall of
  cliffs. But in a while the snow thinned, and the ax was brought into play
  again. Through the thin crust of snow, steps had to be cut into the ice
  beneath, and since there were still many hundreds of feet to be ascended, the
  steps were cut wide apart. With the sun burning upon his face, and his feet
  freezing in the ice-steps, Walter Hine stood and moved, and stood again all
  through that afternoon. Fatigue gained upon him, and fear did not let him go.
  "If only I get off this mountain," he said to himself with heartfelt longing,
  "never again!" When near to the cliffs Pierre Delouvain stopped. In front of
  him the wall was plainly inaccessible. Far away to the left there was a
  depression up which possibly a way might be forced.</p>

  <p>"I think, monsieur, that must be the way," said Pierre.</p>

  <p>"But you should <i>know</i>" said Garratt Skinner.</p>

  <p>"It is some time since I was here. I have forgotten;" and Pierre began to
  traverse the ice-slope to the left. Garratt Skinner followed without a word.
  But he knew that when he had ascended Mont Blanc by the Brenva route twenty-
  three years before, he had kept to the right along the rocks to a point where
  that ice-wall was crevassed, and through that crevasse had found his path.
  They passed quickly beneath an overhanging rib of ice which jutted out from
  the wall, and reached the angle then formed at four o'clock in the
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Our last difficulty, Wallie," said Garratt Skinner, as he cut a large
  step in which Hine might stand. "Once up that wall, our troubles are
  over."</p>

  <p>Walter Hine looked at the wall. It was not smooth ice, it was true; blocks
  had broken loose from it, and had left it bulging out here, there, and in
  places fissured. But it stood at an angle of 65 degrees. It seemed impossible
  that any one should ascend it. He looked down the slope up which they had
  climbed &mdash; it seemed equally impossible that any one should return.
  Moreover, the sun was already in the West, and the ice promontory under which
  they stood shut its warmth from them. Walter Hine was in the shadow, and he
  shivered with cold as much as with fear. For half an hour Pierre Delouvain
  tried desperately to work his way up that ice wall, and failed.</p>

  <p>"It is too late," he said. "We shall not get up to-night."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"No, nor get down," he added, gravely. "I am sorry, Wallie. We must go
  back and find a place where we can pass the night."</p>

  <p>Walter Hine was in despair. He was tired, he was desperately cold, his
  gloves were frozen, his fingers and his feet benumbed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, let's stop here!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"We can't," said Garratt Skinner, and he turned as he spoke and led the
  way down quickly. There was need for hurry. Every now and then he stopped to
  cut an intervening step, where those already cut were too far apart, and at
  times to give Hine a hand while Delouvain let him down with the help of the
  rope from behind.</p>

  <p>Slowly they descended, and while they descended the sun disappeared, the
  mists gathered about the precipices below, the thunder of the avalanches was
  heard at rare intervals, the ice-cliffs above them glimmered faintly and
  still more faintly. The dusk came. They descended in a ghostly twilight. At
  times the mists would part, and below them infinite miles away they saw the
  ice-fields of the Brenva glacier. The light was failing altogether when
  Garratt Skinner turned to his left and began to traverse the slopes to a
  small patch of rocks.</p>

  <p>"Here!" he said, as he reached them. "We must sit here until the morning
  comes."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap25"
     id="chap25"><small>CHAPTER 25</small></a><br>
  <br>
  A NIGHT ON AN ICE-SLOPE</h2>

  <p class="first">At the base of the rocks there was a narrow ledge on which,
  huddled together, the three men could sit side by side. Garratt Skinner began
  to clear the snow from the ledge with his ice-ax; but Walter Hine sank down
  at once and Pierre Delouvain, who might have shown a better spirit, promptly
  followed his example.</p>

  <p>"What is the use?" he whispered. "We shall all die to-night... I have a
  wife and family... Let us eat what there is to eat and then die," and
  drowsily repeating his words, he fell asleep. Garratt Skinner, however,
  roused him, and drowsily he helped to clear the ledge. Then Walter Hine was
  placed in the middle that he might get what warmth and shelter was to be had,
  the rope was hitched over a spike of rock behind, so that if any one fell
  asleep he might not fall off, and Delouvain and Skinner took their places. By
  this time darkness had come. They sat upon the narrow ledge with their backs
  to the rock and the steep snow-slopes falling away at their feet. Far down a
  light or two glimmered in the chalets of La Brenva.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner emptied the <i>Rücksack</i> on his knees.</p>

  <p>"Let us see what food we have," he said. "We made a mistake in not
  bringing more. But Pierre was so certain that we should reach Chamonix to-
  night."</p>

  <p>"We shall die to-night," said Pierre.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," said Garratt Skinner. "We are not the first party which has
  been caught by the night."</p>

  <p>Their stock of food was certainly low. It consisted of a little bread, a
  tin of sardines, a small pot of jam, some cold bacon, a bag of acid-drops, a
  couple of cakes of chocolate, and a few biscuits.</p>

  <p>"We must keep some for the morning," he said. "Don't fall asleep, Wallie!
  You had better take off your boots and muffle your feet in the
  <i>Rücksack</i>. It will keep them warmer and save you from frost-bite. You
  might as well squeeze the water out of your stockings too."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner waked Hine from his drowsiness and insisted that his
  advice should be followed. It would be advisable that it should be known
  afterward in Courmayeur that he had taken every precaution to preserve his
  companion's life. He took off his own stockings and squeezed the water out,
  replaced them, and laced on his boots. For to him, too, the night would bring
  some risk. Then the three men ate their supper. A very little wine was left
  in the gourd which Garratt Skinner had carried on his back, and he filled it
  up with snow and thrust it inside his shirt that it might melt the
  sooner.</p>

  <p>"You have your brandy flask, Wallie, but be sparing of it. Brandy will
  warm you for the moment, but it leaves you more sensitive to the cold than
  you were before. That's a known fact. And don't drink too much of this
  snow-water. It may make you burn inside. At least so I have been told," he
  added.</p>

  <p>Hine drank and passed the bottle to Pierre, who took it with his
  reiterated moan: "What's the use? We shall all die to-night. Why should a
  poor guide with a wife and family be tempted to ascend mountains. I will tell
  you something, monsieur," he cried suddenly across Walter Hine. "I am not
  fond of the mountains. No, I am not fond of them!" and he leaned back and
  fell asleep.</p>

  <p>"Better not follow his example, Wallie. Keep awake! Slap your limbs!"</p>

  <p>Above the three men the stars came out very clear and bright; the tiny
  lights in the chalets far below disappeared one by one; the cold became
  intense. At times Garratt Skinner roused his companions, and holding each
  other by the arm, they rose simultaneously to their feet and stamped upon the
  ledge. But every movement hurt them, and after a while Walter Hine would
  not.</p>

  <p>"Leave me alone," he said. "To move tortures me!"</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner had his pipe and some tobacco. He lit, shading the match
  with his coat; and then he looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"What time is it? Is it near morning?" asked Hine, in a voice which was
  very feeble.</p>

  <p>"A little longer to wait," said Garratt Skinner, cheerfully.</p>

  <p>The hands marked a quarter to ten.</p>

  <p>And afterward they grew very silent, except for the noise which they made
  in shivering. Their teeth chattered with the chill, they shook in fits which
  lasted for minutes, Walter Hine moaned feebly. All about them the world was
  bound in frost; the cold stars glittered overhead; the mountains took their
  toll of pain that night. Yet there was one among those three perched high on
  a narrow ledge of rock amongst the desolate heights, who did not regret. Just
  for a night like this Garratt Skinner had hoped. Walter Hine, weak of frame
  and with little stamina, was exposed to the rigors of a long Alpine night,
  thirteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, with hardly any food, and
  no hope of rescue for yet another day and yet another night. There could be
  but one end to it. Not until to-morrow would any alarm at their disappearance
  be awakened either at Chamonix or at Courmayeur. It would need a second night
  before help reached them &mdash; so Garratt Skinner had planned it out. There
  could be but one end to it. Walter Hine would die. There was a risk that he
  himself might suffer the same fate &mdash; he was not blind to it. He had
  taken the risk knowingly, and with a certain indifference. It was the best
  plan, since, if he escaped alive, suspicion could not fall on him. Thus he
  argued, as he smoked his pipe with his back to the rock and waited for the
  morning.</p>

  <p>At one o'clock Walter Hine began to ramble. He took Garratt Skinner and
  Pierre Delouvain for Captain Barstow and Archie Parminter, and complained
  that it was ridiculous to sit up playing poker on so cold a night; and while
  in his delirium he rambled and moaned, the morning began to break. But with
  the morning came a wind from the north, whirling the snow like smoke about
  the mountain-tops, and bitingly cold. Garratt Skinner with great difficulty
  stood up, slowly and with pain stretched himself to his full height, slapped
  his thighs, stamped with his feet, and then looked for a long while at his
  victim, without remorse, and without satisfaction. He stooped and sought to
  lift him. But Hine was too stiff and numbed with the cold to be able to move.
  In a little while Pierre Delouvain, who had fallen asleep, woke up. The day
  was upon them now, cold and lowering.</p>

  <p>"We must wait for the sun," said Garratt Skinner. "Until that has risen
  and thawed us it will not be safe to move."</p>

  <p>Pierre Delouvain looked about him, worked the stiffened muscles of his
  limbs and groaned.</p>

  <p>"There will be little sun to-day," he said. "We shall all die here."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner sat down again and waited. The sun rose over the rocks of
  Mont Maudit, but weak, and yellow as a guinea. Garratt Skinner then tied his
  coat to his ice-ax, and standing out upon a rock waved it this way and
  that.</p>

  <p>"No one will see it," whimpered Pierre; and indeed Garratt Skinner would
  never have waved that signal had he not thought the same.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps &mdash; one never knows," he said. "We must take all precautions,
  for the day looks bad."</p>

  <p>The sunlight, indeed, only stayed upon the mountain-side long enough to
  tantalize them with vain hopes of warmth. Gray clouds swept up low over the
  crest of Mont Blanc and blotted it out. The wind moaned wildly along the
  slopes. The day frowned upon them sullen and cold with a sky full of
  snow.</p>

  <p>"We will wait a little longer," said Garratt Skinner, "then we must
  move."</p>

  <p>He looked at the sky. It seemed to him now very probable that he would
  lose the desperate game which he had been playing. He had staked his life
  upon it. Let the snow come and the mists, he would surely lose his stake.
  Nevertheless he set himself to the task of rousing Walter Hine.</p>

  <p>"Leave me alone," moaned Walter Hine, and he struck feebly at his
  companions as they lifted him on to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Stamp your feet, Wallie," said Garratt Skinner. "You will feel better in
  a few moments."</p>

  <p>They held him up, but he repeated his cry. "Leave me alone!" and the
  moment they let him go he sank down again upon the ledge. He was overcome
  with drowsiness, the slightest movement tortured him.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner looked up at the leaden sky.</p>

  <p>"We must wait till help comes," he said,</p>

  <p>Delouvain shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It will not come to-day. We shall all die here. It was wrong, monsieur,
  to try the Brenva ridge. Yes, we shall die here"; and he fell to blubbering
  like a child.</p>

  <p>"Could you go down alone?" Garratt Skinner asked.</p>

  <p>"There is the glacier to cross, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"I know. That is the risk. But it is cold and there is no sun. The snow-
  bridges may hold."</p>

  <p>Pierre Delouvain hesitated. Here it seemed to him was certain death. But
  if he climbed down the ice-arête, the snow-slopes, and the rocks below, if
  the snow-bridges held upon the glacier, there would be life for one of the
  three. Pierre Delouvain had little in common with that loyal race of Alpine
  guides who hold it as their most sacred tradition not to return home without
  their patrons.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is our one hope," he said; and untying himself with awkward
  fumbling fingers from the kinked rope, and coiling the spare rope about his
  shoulders, he went down the slope. During the night the steps had frozen and
  in many places it was necessary to recut them. He too was stiff with the long
  vigil. He moved slowly, with numbed and frozen limbs. But as his ax rose and
  fell, the blood began to burn in the tips of his fingers, to flow within his
  veins; he went more and more firmly. For a long way Garratt Skinner held him
  in sight. Then he turned back to Walter Hine upon the ledge, and sat beside
  him. Garratt Skinner's strength had stood him in good stead. He filled his
  pipe and lit it, and watched beside his victim. The day wore on slowly. At
  times Garratt Skinner rubbed Hine's limbs and stamped about the ledge to keep
  some warmth within himself. Walter Hine grew weaker and weaker. At times he
  was delirious; at times he came to his senses.</p>

  <p>"You leave me," he whispered once. "You have been a good friend to me. You
  can do no more. Just leave me here, and save yourself."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner made no answer. He just looked at Hine curiously &mdash;
  that was all. That was all. It was a curious thing to him that Hine should
  display an unexpected manliness &mdash; almost a heroism. It could not be
  pleasant even to contemplate being left alone upon these windy and sunless
  heights to die. But actually to wish it!</p>

  <p>"How did you come by so much fortitude?" he asked; and to his
  astonishment, Walter Hine replied:</p>

  <p>"I learnt it from you, old man."</p>

  <p>"From me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner gave him some of the brandy and listened to a portrait of
  himself, described in broken words, which he was at some pains to recognize.
  Walter Hine had been seeking to model himself upon an imaginary Garratt
  Skinner, and thus, strangely enough, had arrived at an actual heroism. Thus
  would Garratt Skinner have bidden his friends leave him, only in tones less
  tremulous, and very likely with a laugh, turning back, as it were, to snap
  his fingers as he stepped out of the world. Thus, therefore, Walter Hine
  sought to bear himself.</p>

  <p>"Curious," said Garratt Skinner with interest, but with no stronger
  feeling at all. "Are you in pain, Wallie?"</p>

  <p>"Dreadful pain."</p>

  <p>"We must wait. Perhaps help will come!"</p>

  <p>The day wore on, but what the time was Garratt Skinner could not tell. His
  watch and Hine's had both stopped with the cold, and the dull, clouded sky
  gave him no clue. The last of the food was eaten, the last drop of the brandy
  drunk. It was bitterly cold. If only the snow would hold off till morning!
  Garratt Skinner had only to wait. The night would come and during the night
  Walter Hine would die. And even while the thought was in his mind, he heard
  voices. To his amazement, to his alarm, he heard voices! Then he laughed. He
  was growing light-headed. Exhaustion, cold and hunger were telling their tale
  upon him. He was not so young as he had been twenty years before. But to make
  sure he rose to his knees and peered down the slope. He had been mistaken.
  The steep snow-slopes stretched downward, wild and empty. Here and there
  black rocks jutted from them; a long way down four black stones were spaced;
  there was no living thing in that solitude. He sank back relieved. No living
  thing except himself, and perhaps his companion. He looked at Hine closely,
  shook him, and Hine groaned. Yes, he still lived &mdash; for a little time he
  still would live. Garratt Skinner gathered in his numbed palm the last
  pipeful of tobacco in his pouch and, spilling the half of it &mdash; his
  hands so shook with cold, his fingers were so clumsy &mdash; he pressed it
  into his pipe and lit it. Perhaps before it was all smoked out &mdash; he
  thought. And then his hallucination returned to him. Again he heard voices,
  very faint, and distant, in a lull of the wind.</p>

  <p>It was weakness, of course, but he started up again, this time to his
  feet, and as he stood up his head and shoulders showed clear against the
  white snow behind him. He heard a shout &mdash; yes, an undoubted shout. He
  stared down the slope and then he saw. The four black stones had moved, were
  nearer to him &mdash; they were four men ascending. Garratt Skinner turned
  swiftly toward Walter Hine, reached for his ice-ax, grasped it and raised it,
  Walter Hine looked at him with staring, stupid eyes, but raised no hand, made
  no movement. He, too, was conscious of an hallucination. It seemed to him
  that his friend stood over him with a convulsed and murderous face, in which
  rage strove with bitter disappointment, but that he held his ax by the end
  with the adz-head swung back above his head to give greater force to the
  blow, and that while he poised it there came a cry from the confines of the
  world, and that upon that cry his friend dropped the ax, and stooping down to
  him murmured: "There's help quite close, Wallie!"</p>

  <p>Certainly those words were spoken &mdash; that at all events was no
  hallucination. Walter Hine understood it clearly. For Garratt Skinner
  suddenly stripped off his coat, passed it round Hine's shoulders and then,
  baring his own breast, clasped Hine to it that he might impart to him some
  warmth from his own body.</p>

  <p>Thus they were found by the rescue party; and the story of Garratt
  Skinner's great self-sacrifice was long remembered in Courmayeur.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner watched the men mounting and wondered who they were. He
  recognized his own guide, Pierre Delouvain, but who were the others, how did
  they come there on a morning so forbidding? Who was the tall man who walked
  last but one? And as the party drew nearer, he saw and understood. But he did
  not change from his attitude. He waited until they were close. Then he and
  Hilary Chayne exchanged a look.</p>

  <p>"You?" said Garratt Skinner.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;" Chayne paused. "Yes, Mr. Strood," he said.</p>

  <p>And in those words all was said. Garratt Skinner knew that his plan was
  not merely foiled, but also understood. He stood up and looked about him, and
  even to Chayne's eyes there was a dignity in his quiet manner, his patience
  under defeat. For Garratt Skinner, rogue though he was, the mountains had
  their message. All through that long night, while he sat by the side of his
  victim, they had been whispering it. Whether bound in frost beneath the
  stars, or sparkling to the sun, or gray under a sky of clouds, or buried deep
  in flakes of whirling snow, they spoke to him always of the grandeur of their
  indifference. They might be traversed and scaled, but they were unconquered
  always because they were indifferent. The climber might lie in wait through
  the bad weather at the base of the peak, seize upon his chance and stand upon
  the summit with a cry of triumph and derision. The mountains were
  indifferent. As they endured success, so they inflicted defeat &mdash; with a
  sublime indifference, lifting their foreheads to the stars as though wrapt in
  some high communion. Something of their patience had entered into Garratt
  Skinner. He did not deny his name, he asked no question, he accepted failure
  and he looked anxiously to the sky.</p>

  <p>"It will snow, I think."</p>

  <p>They made some tea, mixed it with wine and gave it first of all to Walter
  Hine. Then they all breakfasted, and set off on their homeward journey,
  letting Hine down with the rope from step to step.</p>

  <p>Gradually Hine regained a little strength. His numbed limbs began to come
  painfully to life. He began to move slowly of his own accord, supported by
  his rescuers. They reached the ice-ridge. It had no terrors now for Walter
  Hine.</p>

  <p>"He had better be tied close between Pierre and myself," said Garratt
  Skinner. "We came up that way."</p>

  <p>"Between Simond and Droz," said Chayne, quietly.</p>

  <p>"As you will," said Garratt Skinner with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

  <p>Along the ice-ridge the party moved slowly and safely, carrying Hine
  between them. As they passed behind the great rock tower at the lower end,
  the threatened snow began to fall in light flakes.</p>

  <p>"Quickly," said Chayne. "We must reach the chalets to-night."</p>

  <p>They raced along the snow-slopes on the crest of the buttress and turned
  to the right down the gullies and the ledges on the face of the rock. In
  desperate haste they descended lowering Walter Hine from man to man, they
  crawled down the slabs, dropped from shelf to shelf, wound themselves down
  the gullies of ice. Somehow without injury the snow-slopes at the foot of the
  rocks were reached. The snow still held off; only now and then a few flakes
  fell. But over the mountain the wind was rising, it swept down in fierce
  swift eddies, and drew back with a roar like the sea upon shingle.</p>

  <p>"We must get off the glacier before night comes," cried Chayne, and led by
  Simond the rescue party went down into the ice-fall. They stopped at the
  first glacier pool and made Hine wash his hands and feet in the water, to
  save himself from frost-bite; and thereafter for a little time they rested.
  They went on again, but they were tired men, and before the rocks were
  reached upon which two nights before Garratt Skinner had bivouacked, darkness
  had come. Then Simond justified the praise of Michel Revailloud. With the
  help of a folding lantern which Chayne had carried in his pocket, he led the
  way through that bewildering labyrinth with unerring judgment. Great séracs
  loomed up through the darkness, magnified in size and distorted in shape.
  Simond went over and round them and under them, steadily, and the rescue
  party followed. Now he disappeared over the edge of a cliff into space, and
  in a few seconds his voice rang upward cheerily.</p>

  <p>"Follow! It is safe."</p>

  <p>And his ice-ax rang with no less cheeriness. He led them boldly to the
  brink of abysses which were merely channels in the ice, and amid towering
  pinnacles which seen, close at hand, were mere blocks shoulder high. And at
  last the guide at the tail of the rope heard from far away ahead Simond's
  voice raised in a triumphant shout.</p>

  <p>"The rocks! The rocks!"</p>

  <p>With one accord they flung themselves, tired and panting, on the sheltered
  level of the bivouac. Some sticks were found, a fire was lighted, tea was
  once more made. Walter Hine began to take heart; and as the flames blazed up,
  the six men gathered about it, crouching, kneeling, sitting, and the rocks
  resounded with their laughter.</p>

  <p>"Only a little further, Wallie!" said Garratt Skinner, still true to his
  part.</p>

  <p>They descended from the rocks, crossed a level field of ice and struck the
  rock path along the slope of the Mont de la Brenva.</p>

  <p>"Keep on the rope," said Garratt Skinner. "Hine slipped at a corner as we
  came up"; and Chayne glanced quickly at him. There were one or two awkward
  corners above the lower glacier where rough footsteps had been hewn. On one
  of these Walter Hine had slipped, and Garratt Skinner had saved him &mdash;
  had undoubtedly saved him. At the very beginning of the climb, the object for
  which it was undertaken was almost fulfilled, and would have been fulfilled
  but that instinct overpowered Garratt Skinner, and since the accident was
  unexpected, before he had had time to think he had reached out his hand and
  saved the life which he intended to destroy.</p>

  <p>Along that path Hine was carefully brought to the chalets of La Brenva.
  The peasants made him as comfortable as they could.</p>

  <p>"He will recover," said Simond. "Oh yes, he will recover. Two of us will
  stay with him."</p>

  <p>"No need for that," replied Garratt Skinner. "Thank you very much, but
  that is my duty since Hine is my friend."</p>

  <p>"I think not," said Chayne, standing quietly in front of Garratt Skinner.
  "Walter Hine will be safe enough in Simond's hands. I want you to return with
  me to Courmayeur. My wife is there and anxious."</p>

  <p>"Your wife?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said, slowly. "Yes."</p>

  <p>He looked round the hut. Simond was going to watch by Hine's side. He was
  defeated utterly, and recognized it. Then he looked at Chayne, and smiled
  grimly.</p>

  <p>"On the whole, I am not sorry that you have married my daughter," he said.
  "I will come down to Courmayeur. It will be pleasant to sleep in a bed."</p>

  <p>And together they walked down to Courmayeur, which they reached soon after
  midnight.</p>

  <br>
  RUNNING WATER</h2>

  <p class="first">In two days' time Walter Hine was sufficiently recovered to
  be carried down to Courmayeur. He had been very near to death upon the Brenva
  ridge, certainly the second night upon which Garratt Skinner had counted
  would have ended his life; he was frostbitten; and for a long while the shock
  and the exposure left him weak. But he gained strength with each day, and
  Chayne had opportunities to admire the audacity and the subtle skill with
  which Garratt Skinner had sought his end. For Walter Hine was loud in his
  praises of his friend's self-sacrifice. Skinner had denied himself his own
  share of food, had bared his breast to the wind that he might give the warmth
  of his own body to keep his friend alive &mdash; these instances lost nothing
  in the telling. And they were true! Chayne could not deny to Garratt Skinner
  a certain criminal grandeur. He had placed Hine in no peril which he had not
  shared himself; he had taken him, a man fitted in neither experience nor
  health, on an expedition where inexperience or weakness on the part of one
  was likely to prove fatal to all. There was, moreover, one incident, not
  contemplated by Garratt Skinner in his plan, which made his position
  absolutely secure. He had actually saved Walter Hine's life on the rocky path
  of the Mont de la Brenva. There was no doubt of it. He had reached out his
  hand and saved him. Chayne made much of this incident to his wife.</p>

  <p>"I was wrong you see, Sylvia," he argued. "For your father could have let
  him fall, and did not. I have been unjust to him, and to you, for you have
  been troubled."</p>

  <p>But Sylvia shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You were not wrong," she answered. "It is only because you are very kind
  that you want me to believe it. But I see the truth quite clearly"; and she
  smiled at him. "If you wanted me to believe, you should never have told me of
  the law, a year ago in the Chalet de Lognan. My father obeyed the law &mdash;
  that was all. You know it as well as I. He had no time to think; he acted
  upon the instinct of the moment; he could not do otherwise. Had there been
  time to think, would he have reached out his hand? We both know that he would
  not. But he obeyed the law. What he knew, that he did, obeying the law upon
  the moment. He could save, and knowing it he <i>did</i>save, even against his
  will."</p>

  <p>Chayne did not argue the point. Sylvia saw the truth too clearly.</p>

  <p>"Walter Hine is getting well," he said. "Your father is still at another
  hotel in Courmayeur. There's the future to be considered."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, and she waited.</p>

  <p>"I have asked your father to come over to-night after dinner," said
  Chayne.</p>

  <p>And into their private sitting-room Garratt Skinner entered at eight
  o'clock that evening. It was the first time that Sylvia had seen him since
  she had learned the whole truth, and she found the occasion one of trial. But
  Garratt Skinner carried it off.</p>

  <p>There was nothing of the penitent in his manner, but on the other hand he
  no longer affected the manner of a pained and loving parent. He greeted her
  from the door, and congratulated her quietly and simply upon her marriage.
  Then he turned to Chayne.</p>

  <p>"You wished to speak to me? I am at your service."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Chayne. "We &mdash; and I speak for Sylvia &mdash; we wish
  to suggest to you that your acquaintanceship with Walter Hine should end
  altogether &mdash; that it should already have ended."</p>

  <p>"Really!" said Garratt Skinner, with an air of surprise. "Captain Chayne,
  the laws of England, revolutionary as they have no doubt become to old-
  fashioned people like myself, have not yet placed fathers under the
  guardianship of their sons-in-law. I cannot accept your suggestion."</p>

  <p>"We insist upon its acceptance," said Chayne, quietly.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner smiled.</p>

  <p>"Insist perhaps! But how enforce it, my friend? That's another
  matter."</p>

  <p>"I think we have the means to do that," said Chayne. "We can point out to
  Walter Hine, for instance, that your ascent from the Brenva Glacier was an
  attempt to murder him."</p>

  <p>"An ugly word, Captain Chayne. You would find it difficult of proof."</p>

  <p>"The story is fairly complete," returned Chayne. "There is first of all a
  telegram from Mr. Jarvice couched in curious language."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner's face lost its smile of amusement.</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" he said. He was plainly disconcerted.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Chayne produced the telegram from his letter case, read it aloud
  with his eyes upon Garratt Skinner, and replaced it. "'What are you waiting
  for? Hurry up! Jarvice.' There is no need at all events to ask Mr. Jarvice
  what he was waiting for, is there? He wanted to lay his hands upon the money
  for which Hine's life was insured."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner leaned back in his chair. His eyes never left Chayne's
  face, his face grew set and stern. He had a dangerous look, the look of a
  desperate man at bay.</p>

  <p>"Then there is a certain incident to be considered which took place in the
  house near Weymouth. You must at times have been puzzled by it &mdash;
  perhaps a little alarmed too. Do you remember one evening when a whistle from
  the shadows on the road and a yokel's shout drove you out of Walter Hine's
  room, sent you creeping out of it as stealthily as you entered &mdash; nay,
  did more than that, for that whistle and that shout drove you out of
  Dorsetshire. Ah! I see you remember."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner indeed had often enough been troubled by the recollection
  of that night. The shout, the whistle ringing out so suddenly and abruptly
  from the darkness and the silence had struck upon his imagination and alarmed
  him by their mystery. Who was the man who had seen? And what had he seen?
  Garratt Skinner had never felt quite safe since that evening. There was some
  one, a stranger, going about the world with the key to his secret, even if he
  had not guessed the secret.</p>

  <p>"It was I who whistled. I who shouted."</p>

  <p>"You!" cried Garratt Skinner. "You!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Sylvia was with me. You thought to do that night what you thought to
  do a few days ago above the Brenva ridge. Both times together we were able to
  hinder you. But once Sylvia hindered you alone. There is the affair of the
  cocaine."</p>

  <p>Chayne looked toward his wife with a look of great pride for the bravery
  which she had shown. She was sitting aloof in the embrasure of the window
  with her face averted and a hand pressed over her eyes and forehead. Chayne
  looked back to Garratt Skinner, and there was more anger in his face than he
  had ever shown.</p>

  <p>"I will never forgive you the distress you have caused to Sylvia," he
  said.</p>

  <p>But Garratt Skinner's eyes were upon Sylvia, and in his face, too, there
  was a humorous look of pride. She had courage. He remembered how she had
  confronted him when Walter Hine lay sick. He said no word to her, however,
  and again he turned to Chayne, who went on:</p>

  <p>"There is also your past career to add weight to the argument, Mr. &mdash;
  Strood."</p>

  <p>Point by point Chayne set out in detail the case for the prosecution.
  Garratt Skinner listened without interruption, but he knew that he was
  beaten. The evidence against him was too strong. It might not be enough
  legally to secure his conviction at a public trial &mdash; though even upon
  that question there would be the gravest doubt &mdash; but it would be enough
  to carry certitude to every ear which listened and to every eye which
  read.</p>

  <p>"The game is played out," Chayne continued. "We have Walter Hine, and we
  shall not let him slip back into your hands. How much of the story we shall
  tell him we are not yet sure &mdash; but all if it be necessary. And, if it
  be necessary, to others beside."</p>

  <p>There was a definite threat in the last words. But Garratt Skinner had
  already made up his mind. Since the game was played out, since defeat had
  come, he took it without anger or excuse.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "Peace in the family circle is after all very
  desirable &mdash; eh, Sylvia? I agree with the deepest regret to part from my
  young friend, Walter Hine. I leave him in your hands." He was speaking with a
  humorous magnanimity. But his eyes wandered back to Sylvia, who sat some
  distance away in the embrasure of the window, with her face in her hands; and
  his voice changed.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia," he said, gently, "come here."</p>

  <p>Sylvia rose and walked over to the table.</p>

  <p>The waiting, the knowledge which had come to her during the last few days,
  had told their tale. She had the look which Chayne too well remembered, the
  dark shadows beneath her eyes, the languor in her walk, the pallor in her
  cheeks, the distress and shame in her expression.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he said; and she obeyed him reluctantly, seating herself over
  against him. She gazed at the table-cloth with that mutinous look upon her
  face which took away from her her womanhood and gave to her the aspect of a
  pretty but resentful child. Garratt Skinner for the life of him could not but
  smile at her.</p>

  <p>"Well, Sylvia, you have beaten me. You fought your fight well, and I bear
  you no malice," he said, lightly. "But," and his voice became serious again,
  "you sit in judgment on me."</p>

  <p>Sylvia raised her eyes quickly.</p>

  <p>"No!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"I think so," he persisted. "I don't blame you. Only I should like you to
  bear this in mind; that you have in your own life a reason to go gently in
  your judgments of other people."</p>

  <p>Chayne stepped forward, as though he would interfere, but Sylvia laid her
  hand upon his arm and checked him.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you understand, Hilary," she said, quickly. She turned to
  her father and looked straight at him with an eager interest.</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether we are both thinking of the same thing," she said,
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," replied her father. "All your life you have dreamed of running
  water."</p>

  <p>And Sylvia nodded her head.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," she said, with a peculiar intentness.</p>

  <p>"The dream is part of you, part of your life. For all you know, it may
  have modified your character."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"It is a part of you of which you could not rid yourself if you tried.
  When you are asleep, this dream comes to you. It is as much a part of you as
  a limb."</p>

  <p>And again Sylvia answered: "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, you are not responsible for it," and Sylvia leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she said. She had been wondering whether it was to this point that
  he was coming.</p>

  <p>"You know now why you hear it, why it's part of you. You were born to the
  sound of running water in that old house in Dorsetshire. Before you were
  born, in the daytime and in the stillness of the night your mother heard it
  week after week. Perhaps even when she was asleep the sound rippled through
  her dreams. Thus you came by it. It was born in you."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered, following his argument step by step very carefully,
  but without a sign of the perplexity which was evident in Hilary Chayne.
  Chayne stood a little aloof, looking from Sylvia's face to the face of her
  father, in doubt whither the talk was leading. Sylvia, on the other hand,
  recognized each sentence which her father spoke as the embodiment of a
  thought with which she was herself familiar.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, here's a definite thing, an influence most likely, a
  characteristic most certainly, and not of your making! One out of how many
  influences, characteristics which are part of you but not of your making! But
  we can lay our finger on it. Well, it is a pleasant and a pretty quality
  &mdash; this dream of yours, Sylvia &mdash; yes, a very pleasant one to be
  born with. But suppose that instead of that dream you had been born with a
  vice, an instinct of crime, of sin, would you have been any the more
  responsible for it? If you are not responsible for the good thing, are you
  responsible for the bad? An awkward question, Sylvia &mdash; awkward enough
  to teach you to go warily in your judgments."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Sylvia. "I was amongst the fortunate. I don't deny it."</p>

  <p>"But that's not all," and as Chayne moved restively, Garratt Skinner waved
  an indulgent hand.</p>

  <p>"I don't expect you, Captain Chayne, to take an interest in these
  problems. For a military man, discipline and the penal code are the obvious
  unalterable solutions. But it is possible that I may never see my daughter
  again and &mdash; I am speaking to her"; and he went back to the old vexed
  question.</p>

  <p>"It's not only that you are born with qualities, definite characteristics,
  definite cravings, for which you are no more responsible than the man in the
  moon, and which are part of you. But there's something else. How much of your
  character, how much of all your life to come is decided for you during the
  first ten or fifteen years of your life &mdash; decided for you, mind, not by
  you? Upon my soul, I think the whole of it. You don't agree? Well, it's an
  open question. I believe that at the age of fifteen the lines along which you
  will move are already drawn, your character formed, your conduct for the
  future a settled thing."</p>

  <p>To that Sylvia gave no assent. But she did not disagree. She only looked
  at her father with a questioning and a troubled face. If it were so, she
  asked, why had she hated from the first the circle in which her mother and
  herself had moved. And the answer &mdash; or at all events <i>an</i> answer
  &mdash; came as she put the question to herself. She had lived amongst her
  dreams. She was in doubt.</p>

  <p>"Well, hear something of my boyhood, Sylvia!" cried her father, and for
  the first time his voice became embittered. "I was brought up by a
  respectable father. Yes, respectable," he said, with a sneer. "Everything
  about us was respectable. We lived in a respectable house in a respectable
  neighborhood, and twice every Sunday we went to church and listened to a
  respectable clergyman. But! &mdash; Well, here's a chapter out of the inside.
  I would go to bed and read in bed by a candle. Not a very heinous offence,
  but contrary to the rule of the house. Sooner or later I would hear a faint
  scuffling sound in the passage. That was my father stealing secretly along to
  listen at my door and see what I was doing. I covered the light of the candle
  with my hand, or perhaps blew it out &mdash; but not so quickly but that he
  would see the streak of light beneath the door. Then the play would begin.
  'You are not reading in bed, are you?' he would say. 'Certainly not,' I would
  reply. 'You are sure?' he would insist. 'Of course, father,' I would answer.
  Then back he would go, but only for a little way, and I would hear him come
  stealthily scuffling back again. Perhaps the candle would be lit again
  already, or at all events uncovered. Would he say anything? Oh, no! He had
  found out I was lying. He felt that he had scored a point, and he would save
  it up. So we would meet the next morning at breakfast, he knowing that I was
  a liar, I knowing that he knew that I was a liar, and both pretending that we
  were all in all to each other. A small thing, Sylvia. But crowd your life
  with such small things? Spying and deceit and a game of catch-as-catch-can
  played by the father and son! My letters were read &mdash; I used to know,
  for roundabout questions would be put leading up to the elucidation of a
  sentence which to any one but myself would be obscure! Do you think any child
  could grow up straight, if his boyhood passed in that atmosphere of trickery?
  I don't know. Only I think that before I was fifteen my way of life was a
  sure and settled thing. It was certain that I should develop upon the lines
  on which I was trained."</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner rose from his seat.</p>

  <p>"There, I have done," he said. He looked at his daughter for a little
  while, his eyes dwelling upon her beauty with a certain pleasure, and even a
  certain wistfulness; he looked at her now much as she had been wont to look
  at him in the early days of the house in Dorsetshire. It was very plain that
  they were father and daughter.</p>

  <p>"You are too good for your military man, my dear," he said, with a smile.
  "Too pretty and too good. Don't you let him forget it!" And suddenly he cried
  out with a burst of passion. "I wish to God you had never come near me!" And
  Sylvia, hearing the cry, remembered that on the Sunday evening when she had
  first come to the house in Hobart Place, her father had shown a particular
  hesitation, had felt some of that remorse of which she heard the full
  expression now, in welcoming her to his house and adapting her to his ends.
  She raised her downcast eyes and with outstretched hands took a step
  forward.</p>

  <p>"Father!" she said. But her father was already gone. She heard his step
  upon the stairs.</p>

  <p>Chayne, however, followed her father from the room and caught him up as he
  was leaving the hotel.</p>

  <p>"I want to say," he began with some difficulty, "that, if you are pressed
  at all for money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner stopped him. He pulled some sovereigns out of one pocket
  and some banknotes out of another.</p>

  <p>"You see, I have enough to go on with. In fact&mdash;" and he looked
  northward toward the mountains. Dimly they could be seen under the sickle of
  a new moon. "In fact, I propose to-morrow to take your friend Simond and
  cross on the high- level to Zermatt."</p>

  <p>"But afterward?" asked Chayne.</p>

  <p>Garratt Skinner laughed and laughed like a boy. There was a rich
  anticipation of enjoyment in the sound.</p>

  <p>"Afterward? I shall have a great time. I shall squeeze Mr. Jarvice. It's
  what they call in America a cinch."</p>

  <p>And with a cheery good-night Garratt Skinner betook himself down the
  road.</p>
