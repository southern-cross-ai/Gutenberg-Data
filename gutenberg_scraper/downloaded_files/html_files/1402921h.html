  <h2><a name="c1"
     id="c1"></a>I. &mdash; THE CASE OF THE WHITE FOOTPRINTS</h2>

  <p>"Well," said my friend Foxton, pursuing a familiar and apparently
  inexhaustible topic, "I'd sooner have your job than my own."</p>

  <p>"I've no doubt you would," was my unsympathetic reply. "I never met a man
  who wouldn't. We all tend to consider other men's jobs in terms of their
  advantages and our own in terms of their drawbacks. It is human nature."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's all very well for you to be so beastly philosophical," retorted
  Foxton. "You wouldn't be if you were in my place. Here, in Margate, it's
  measles, chicken-pox and scarlatina all the summer, and bronchitis, colds and
  rheumatism an the winter. A deadly monotony. Whereas you and Thorndyke sit
  there in your chambers and let your clients feed you up with the raw material
  of romance. Why, your life is a sort of everlasting Adelphi drama."</p>

  <p>"You exaggerate, Foxton," said I. "We, like you, have our routine work,
  only it is never heard of outside the Law Courts; and you, like every other
  doctor, must run up against mystery and romance from time to time."</p>

  <p>Foxton shook his head as he held out his hand for my cup. "I don't," said
  be. "My practice yields nothing but an endless round of dull routine."</p>

  <p>And then, as if in commentary on this last statement, the housemaid burst
  into the room and, with hardly dissembled agitation, exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"If you please, sir, the page from Beddingfield's Boarding-house says that
  a lady has been found dead in her bed and would you go round there
  immediately."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Jane," said Foxton, and as the maid retired, he deliberately
  helped himself to another fried egg and, looking across the table at me,
  exclaimed: "Isn't that always the way? Come immediately&mdash;now&mdash;this
  very instant, although the patient may have been considering for a day or two
  whether he'll send for you or not. But directly he decides you must spring
  out of bed, or jump up from your breakfast, and run."</p>

  <p>"That's quite true," I agreed; "but this really does seem to be an urgent
  case."</p>

  <p>"What's the urgency?" demanded Foxton. "The woman is already dead. Anyone
  would think she was in imminent danger of coming to life again and that my
  instant arrival the only thing that could prevent such a catastrophe."</p>

  <p>"You've only a third-hand statement that she is dead," said I. "It is just
  possible that she isn't; and even if she is, as you will have to give
  evidence at the inquest, you do not want the police to get there first and
  turn out the room before you've made your inspection."</p>

  <p>"Gad!" exclaimed Foxton. "I hadn't thought of that. Yes. You're right.
  I'll hop round at once."</p>

  <p>He swallowed the remainder of the egg at a single gulp rose from the
  table. Then he paused and stood for a few moments looking down at me
  irresolutely.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, Jervis," he said, "if you would mind coming round with me. You
  know all the medico-legal ropes, and I don't. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>I agreed instantly, having, in fact, been restrained only by delicacy from
  making the suggestion myself; and when I had fetched from my room my pocket
  camera and telescopic tripod, we set forth together without further
  delay.</p>

  <p>Beddingfield's Boarding-house was but a few minutes walk from Foxton's
  residence being situated near the middle of Ethelred Road, Cliftonville, a
  quiet, suburban street which abounded in similar establishments, many of
  which, I noticed, were undergoing a spring-cleaning and renovation to prepare
  them for the approaching season.</p>

  <p>"That's the house," said Foxton, "where that woman is standing at the
  front door. Look at the boarders, collected at the dining-room window.
  There's a rare commotion in that house, I'll warrant."</p>

  <p>Here, arriving at the house, he ran up the steps and accosted in
  sympathetic tones the elderly woman who stood by the open street door.</p>

  <p>"What a dreadful thing this is, Mrs. Beddingfield! Terrible! Most
  distressing for you!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, you're right, Dr. Foxton," she replied. "It's an awful affair.
  Shocking. So bad for business, too. I do hope, and trust there won't be any
  scandal."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I hope not," said Foxton. "There shan't be if I can help it. And
  as my friend Dr. Jervis, who is staying with me for a few days, is a lawyer
  as well as a doctor, we shall have the best advice. When was the affair
  discovered?"</p>

  <p>"Just before I sent for you, Dr. Foxton. The maid, noticed that Mrs.
  Toussaint&mdash;that is the poor creature's name&mdash;had not taken in her
  hot water, so she knocked at the door. As she couldn't get any answer, she
  tried the door and found it bolted on the inside, and then she came and told
  me. I went up and knocked loudly, and then, as I couldn't get any reply, I
  told our boy, James, to force the door open with a case-opener, which he did
  quite easily as the bolt was only a small one. Then I went in, all of a
  tremble, for I had a presentiment that there was something wrong; and there
  she was lying stone dead, with a most 'orrible stare on her face and an empty
  bottle in her hand."</p>

  <p>"A bottle, eh!" said Foxton.</p>

  <p>"Yes. She'd made away with herself, poor thing; and all on account of some
  silly love affair&mdash;and it was hardly even that."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Foxton. "The usual thing. You must tell us about that later.
  Now we'd better go up and see the patient&mdash;at least
  the&mdash;er&mdash;perhaps you'll show us the room, Mrs. Beddingfield."</p>

  <p>The landlady turned and preceded us up the stairs to the first-floor back,
  where she paused, and softly opening a door, peered nervously into the room.
  As we stepped past her and entered, she seemed inclined to follow, but, at a
  significant glance from me, Foxton persuasively ejected her and closed the
  door. Then we stood silent for a while and looked about us.</p>

  <p>In the aspect of the room there was something strangely incongruous with
  the tragedy that had been enacted within its walls; a mingling of the
  commonplace and the terrible that almost amounted to anticlimax. Through the
  wide-open window the bright spring sunshine streamed in on the garish
  wallpaper and cheap furniture; from the street below, the periodic shouts of
  a man selling "sole and mack-ro!" broke into the brisk staccato of a
  barrel-organ and both sounds mingled with a raucous voice close at hand,
  cheerfully trolling a popular song, and accounted for by a linen-clad elbow
  that bobbed in front of the window and evidently appertained to a
  house-painter on an adjacent ladder.</p>

  <p>It was all very commonplace and familiar and discordantly out of character
  with the stark figure that lay on the bed like a waxen effigy symbolic of
  tragedy. Here was none of that gracious somnolence in which death often
  presents itself with a suggestion of eternal repose. This woman was dead;
  horribly, aggressively dead. The thin, sallow face was rigid as stone, the
  dark eyes stared into infinite space with a horrid fixity that was quite
  disturbing to look on. And yet the posture of the corpse was not uneasy,
  being, in fact, rather curiously symmetrical, with both arms outside the
  bedclothes and both hands closed, the right grasping, as Mrs. Beddingfield
  had said, an empty bottle.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Foxton, as he stood looking down on the dead woman, "it seems
  a pretty clear case. She appears to have laid herself out and kept hold of
  the bottle so that there should be no mistake. How long do you suppose this
  woman has been dead, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>I felt the rigid limbs and tested the temperature of the body surface.</p>

  <p>"Not less than six hours," I replied. "Probably more. I should say that
  she died about two o'clock this morning."</p>

  <p>"And that is about all we can say," said Foxton, "until the post-mortem
  has been made. Everything looks quite straightforward. No signs of a struggle
  or marks of violence. That blood on the mouth is probably due to her biting
  her lip when she drank from the bottle. Yes; here's a little cut on the
  inside of the lip, corresponding to the upper incisors. By the way, I wonder
  if there is anything left in the bottle."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he drew the small, unlabelled, green glass phial from the
  closed hand&mdash;out of which it slipped quite easily&mdash;and held it up
  to the light.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he exclaimed, "there's more than a drachm left; quite enough for an
  analysis. But I don't recognize the smell. Do you?"</p>

  <p>I sniffed at the bottle and was aware of a faint unfamiliar vegetable
  odour.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "It appears to be a watery solution of some kind, but I
  can't give it a name. Where is the cork?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen it," he replied. "Probably it is on the floor
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>We both stooped to look for the missing cork and presently found it in the
  shadow, under the little bedside table. But, in the course of that brief
  search, I found something else, which had indeed been lying in full view all
  the time&mdash;a wax match. Now a wax match is a perfectly innocent and very
  commonplace object, but yet the presence of this one gave me pause. In the
  first place, women do not, as a rule, use wax matches, though there was not
  much in that. What was more to the point was that the candlestick by the
  bedside contained a box of safety matches, and that, as the burnt remains of
  one lay in the tray, it appeared to have been used to light the candle. Then
  why the wax match?</p>

  <p>While I was turning over this problem Foxton had corked the bottle,
  wrapped it carefully in a piece of paper which he took from the
  dressing-table and bestowed it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jervis," said he, "I think we've seen everything. The analysis and
  the post-mortem will complete the case. Shall we go down and hear what Mrs.
  Beddingfield has to say?"</p>

  <p>But that wax match, slight as was its significance, taken alone, had
  presented itself to me as the last of a succession of phenomena each of which
  was susceptible of a sinister interpretation; and the cumulative effect of
  these slight suggestions began to impress me somewhat strongly.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Foxton," said I. "Don't let us take anything for granted. We
  are here to collect evidence, and we must go warily. There is such a thing as
  homicidal poisoning, you know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course," he replied, "but there is nothing to suggest it in this
  case; at least, I see nothing. Do you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing very positive," said I; "but there are some facts that seem to
  call for consideration. Let us go over what we have seen. In the first place,
  there is a distinct discrepancy in the appearance of the body. The general
  easy, symmetrical posture, like that of a figure on a tomb, suggests the
  effect of a slow, painless poison. But look at the face. There is nothing
  reposeful about that. It is very strongly suggestive of pain or terror or
  both."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Foxton, "that is so. But you can't draw any satisfactory
  conclusions from the facial expression of dead bodies. Why, men who have been
  hanged, or even, stabbed, often look as peaceful as babes."</p>

  <p>"Still," I urged, "it is a fact to be noted. Then there is that cut on the
  lip. It may have been produced in the way you suggest; but it may equally
  well be the result of pressure on the mouth."</p>

  <p>Foxton made no comment on this beyond a slight shrug of the shoulders, and
  I continued: "Then there is the state of the hand. It was closed, but, it did
  not really grasp the object it contained. You drew the bottle out without any
  resistance. It simply lay in the closed hand. But that is not a normal state
  of affairs. As you know, when a person dies grasping any object, either the
  hand relaxes and lets it drop, or the muscular action passes into cadaveric
  spasm and grasps the object firmly. And lastly, there is this wax match.
  Where did it come from? The dead woman apparently lit her candle with a
  safety match from the box. It is a small matter, but it wants
  explaining."</p>

  <p>Foxton raised his eyebrows protestingly. "You're like all specialists,
  Jervis," said he. "You see your speciality in everything. And while you are
  straining these flimsy suggestions to turn a simple suicide into murder, you
  ignore the really conclusive fact that the door was bolted and had to be
  broken open before anyone could get in."</p>

  <p>"You are not forgetting, I suppose," said I, "that the window was wide
  open and that there were house-painters about and possibly a ladder left
  standing against the house."</p>

  <p>"As to the ladder," said Foxton, "that is a pure assumption; but we can
  easily settle the question by asking that fellow out there if it was or was
  not left standing last night."</p>

  <p>Simultaneously we moved towards the window; but halfway we both stopped
  short. For the question of the ladder had in a moment became negligible.
  Staring up at us from the dull red linoleum which covered the floor were the
  impressions of a pair of bare feet, imprinted in white paint with the
  distinctness of a woodcut. There was no need to ask if they had been made by
  the dead woman: they were unmistakably the feet of a man, and large feet at
  that. Nor could there be any doubt as to whence those feet had come.
  Beginning with startling distinctness under the window, the tracks shed
  rapidly in intensity until they reached the carpeted portion of the room,
  where they vanished abruptly; and only by the closest scrutiny was it
  possible to detect the faint traces of the retiring tracks.</p>

  <p>Foxton and I stood for some moments gazing in, silence at the sinister
  white shapes; then we looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"You've saved me from a most horrible blunder, Jervis," said Foxton.
  "Ladder or no ladder, that fellow came in at the window; and he came in last
  night, for I saw them painting these window-sills yesterday afternoon. Which
  side did he come from, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>We moved to the window and looked out on the sill. A set of distinct,
  though smeared impressions on the new paint gave unneeded confirmation and
  showed that the intruder had approached from the left side, close to which
  was a cast-iron stack-pipe, now covered with fresh green paint.</p>

  <p>"So," said Foxton, "the presence or absence of the ladder is of no
  significance. The man got into the window somehow, and that's all that
  matters."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," said I, "the point may be of considerable importance in
  identification. It isn't everyone who could climb up a stack-pipe, whereas
  most people could make shift to climb a ladder, even if it were guarded by a
  plank. But the fact that the man took off his boots and socks suggests that
  he came up by the pipe. If he had merely aimed at silencing his footfalls, he
  would probably have removed his boots only."</p>

  <p>From the window we turned to examine more closely the footprints on the
  floor, and while I took a series of measurements with my spring tape Foxton
  entered them in my notebook.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it strike you as rather odd, Jervis," said he, "that neither of
  the little toes has made any mark?"</p>

  <p>"It does indeed," I replied. "The appearances suggest that the little toes
  were absent, but I have never met with such a condition. Have you?"</p>

  <p>"Never. Of course one is acquainted with the supernumerary toe deformity,
  but I have never heard of congenitally deficient little toes."</p>

  <p>Once more we scrutinized the footprints, and even examined those on the
  window-sill, obscurely marked on the fresh paint; but, exquisitely distinct
  as were those on the linoleum, showing every wrinkle and minute skin-marking,
  not the faintest hint of a little toe was to be seen on either foot.</p>

  <p>"It's very extraordinary," said Foxton. "He has certainly lost his little
  toes, if he ever had any. They couldn't have failed to make some mark. But
  it's a queer affair. Quite a windfall for the police, by the way; I mean for
  purposes of identification."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "and having regard to the importance of the footprints, I
  think it would be wise to get a photograph of them."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the police will see to that," said Foxton. "Besides, we haven't got a
  camera, unless you thought of using that little toy snapshotter of
  yours."</p>

  <p>As Foxton was no photographer I did not trouble to explain that my camera,
  though small, had been specially made for scientific purposes.</p>

  <p>"Any photograph is better than none," I said, and with this I opened the
  tripod and set it over one of the most distinct of the footprints, screwed
  the camera to the goose-neck, carefully framed the footprint in the finder
  and adjusted the focus, finally making the exposure by means of an Antinous
  release. This process I repeated four times, twice on a right footprint and
  twice on a left.</p>

  <p>"Well," Foxton remarked, "with all those photographs the police ought to
  be able to pick up the scent."</p>

  <p>"Yes, they've got something to go on; but they'll have to catch their hare
  before they can cook him. He won't be walking about barefooted, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"No. It's a poor clue in that respect. And now we may as well be off as
  we've seen all there is to see. I think we won't have much to say to Mrs.
  Beddingfield. This is a police case, and the less I'm mixed up in it the
  better it will be for my practice."</p>

  <p>I was faintly amused at Foxton's caution when considered by the light of
  his utterances at the breakfast-table. Apparently his appetite for mystery
  and romance was easily satisfied. But that was no affair of mine. I waited on
  the doorstep while he said a few&mdash;probably evasive&mdash;words to the
  landlady and then, as we started off together in the direction of the police
  station, I began to turn over in my mind the salient features of the case.
  For some time we walked on in silence, and must have been pursuing a parallel
  train of thought for, when he at length spoke, he almost put my reflections
  into words.</p>

  <p>"You know, Jervis," said he, "there ought to be a clue in those
  footprints. I realize that you can't tell how many toes a man has by looking
  at his booted feet. But those unusual footprints ought to give an expert a
  hint as to what sort of man to look for. Don't they convey any hint to
  you?"</p>

  <p>I felt that Foxton was right; that if my brilliant colleague, Thorndyke,
  had been in my place he would have extracted from those footprints some
  leading fact that would have given the police a start along some definite
  line of inquiry; and that belief, coupled with Foxton's challenge, put me on
  my mettle.</p>

  <p>"They offer no particular suggestions to me at this moment," said I, "but
  I think that, if we consider them systematically, we may be able to draw some
  useful deductions."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Foxton, "then let us consider them systematically. Fire
  away. I should like to hear how you work these things out."</p>

  <p>Foxton's frankly spectatorial attitude was a little disconcerting,
  especially as it seemed to commit me to a result that I was by no means
  confident of attaining. I therefore began a little diffidently.</p>

  <p>"We are assuming that both the feet that made those prints were from some
  cause devoid of little toes. That assumption&mdash;which is almost certainly
  correct&mdash;we treat as a fact, and, taking it as our starting point, the
  first step in the inquiry is to find some explanation of it. Now there are
  three possibilities, and only three: deformity, injury, and disease. The toes
  may have been absent from birth, they may have been lost as a result of
  mechanical injury, or they may have been lost by disease. Let us take those
  possibilities in order.</p>

  <p>"Deformity we exclude since such a malformation is unknown to us.</p>

  <p>"Mechanical injury seems to be excluded by the fact that the two little
  toes are on opposite sides of the body and could not conceivably be affected
  by any violence which left the intervening feet uninjured. This seems to
  narrow the possibilities down to disease; and the question that arises is,
  What diseases are there which might result in the loss of both little
  toes?"</p>

  <p>I looked inquiringly at Foxton, but he merely nodded encouragingly. His
  rôle was that of listener.</p>

  <p>"Well," I pursued, "the loss of both toes seems to exclude local disease,
  just as it excluded local injury; and as to general diseases, I can think
  only of three which might produce this condition&mdash;Raynaud's disease,
  ergotism, and frost-bite."</p>

  <p>"You don't call frost-bite a general disease, do you?" objected
  Foxton.</p>

  <p>"For our present purpose, I do. The effects are local, but the
  cause&mdash;low external temperature&mdash;affects the whole body and is a
  general cause. Well, now, taking the diseases in order. I think we can
  exclude Raynaud's disease. It does, it is true, occasionally cause the
  fingers or toes to die and drop off, and the little toes would be especially
  liable to be affected as being most remote from the heart. But in such a
  severe case the other toes would be affected. They would be shrivelled and
  tapered, whereas, if you remember, the toes of these feet were quite plump
  and full, to judge by the large impressions they made. So I think we may
  safely reject Raynaud's disease. There remain ergotism and frost-bite; and
  the choice between them is just a question of relative frequency. Frost-bite
  is more common; therefore frost-bite is more probable."</p>

  <p>"Do they tend equally to affect the little toes?" asked Foxton.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of probability, yes. The poison of ergot acting from within,
  and intense cold acting from without, contract the small blood-vessels and
  arrest, the circulation. The feet, being the most distant parts of the body
  from the heart, are the first to feel the effects; and the little toes, which
  are the most distant parts of the feet, are the most susceptible of all."</p>

  <p>Foxton reflected awhile, and then remarked:</p>

  <p>"This is all very well, Jervis, but I don't see that you are much
  forrarder. This man has lost both his little toes and on your showing, the
  probabilities are that the loss was due either to chronic ergot poisoning or
  to frost-bite, with a balance of probability in favour of frost-bite. That's
  all. No proof, no verification, just the law of probability applied to a
  particular case, which is always unsatisfactory. He may have lost his toes in
  some totally different way. But even if the probabilities work out correctly,
  I don't see what use your conclusions would be to the police. They wouldn't
  tell them what sort of man to look for."</p>

  <p>There was a good deal of truth in Foxton's objection. A man who has
  suffered from ergotism or frost-bite is not externally different from any
  other man. Still, we had not exhausted the case, as I ventured to point
  out.</p>

  <p>"Don't be premature, Foxton," said I. "Let us pursue our argument a little
  farther. We have established a probability that this unknown man has suffered
  either from ergotism or frost-bite. That, as you say, is of no use by itself;
  but supposing we can show that these conditions tend to affect a particular
  class of persons, we shall have established a fact that will indicate a line
  of investigation. And I think we can. Let us take the case of ergotism
  first.</p>

  <p>"Now how is chronic ergot poisoning caused? Not by the medicinal use of
  the drug, but, by the consumption of the diseased rye in which ergot occurs.
  It is therefore peculiar to countries in which rye is used extensively as
  food. Those countries, broadly speaking, are the countries of North-Eastern
  Europe, and especially Russia and Poland.</p>

  <p>"Then take the case of frost-bite. Obviously, the most likely person to
  get frost-bitten is the inhabitant of a country with a cold climate. The most
  rigorous climates inhabited by white people are North America and
  North-Eastern Europe, especially Russia and Poland. So you see, the areas
  associated with ergotism and frost-bite overlap to some extent. In fact they
  do more than overlap; for a person even slightly affected by ergot would be
  specially liable to frost-bite, owing to the impaired circulation. The
  conclusion is that, racially, in both ergotism and frost-bite, the balance of
  probability is in favour of a Russian, a Pole, or a Scandinavian.</p>

  <p>"Then in the case of frost-bite there is the occupation factor. What class
  of men tend most to become frost-bitten? Well, beyond all doubt, the greatest
  sufferers from frost-bite are sailors, especially those on sailing ships,
  and, naturally, on ships trading to Arctic and sub-Arctic countries. But the
  bulk of such sailing ships are those engaged in the Baltic and Archangel
  trade; and the crews of those ships are almost exclusively Scandinavians,
  Finns, Russians and Poles. So that, again, the probabilities point to a
  native of North-Eastern Europe, and, taken as a whole, by the over-lapping of
  factors, to a Russian, a Pole, or a Scandinavian."</p>

  <p>Foxton smiled sardonically. "Very ingenious, Jervis," said he. "Most
  ingenious. As an academic statement of probabilities, quite excellent. But
  for practical purposes absolutely useless. However, here we are at the
  police-station. I'll just run in and give them the facts and then go on to
  the coroner's office."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I'd better not come in with you?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Well, no," he replied. "You see, you have no official connection with the
  case, and they mightn't like it. You'd better go and amuse yourself while I
  get the morning's visits done. We can talk things over at lunch."</p>

  <p>With this he disappeared into the police-station, and I turned away with a
  smile of grim amusement. Experience is apt to make us a trifle uncharitable,
  and experience had taught me that those who are the most scornful of academic
  reasoning are often not above retailing it with some reticence as to its
  original authorship. I had a shrewd suspicion that Foxton was at this very
  moment disgorging my despised "academic statement of probabilities" to an
  admiring police-inspector.</p>

  <p>My way towards the sea lay through Ethelred Road, and I had traversed
  about half its length and was approaching the house of the tragedy when I
  observed Mrs. Beddingfield at the bay window. Evidently she recognized me,
  for a few moments later she appeared in outdoor clothes on the doorstep and
  advanced to meet me.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen the police?" she asked, as we met.</p>

  <p>I replied that Dr. Foxton was even now at the police-station.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she said, "it's a dreadful affair; most unfortunate, too, just at
  the beginning of the season. A scandal is absolute ruin to a boarding-house.
  What do you think of the case? Will it be possible to hush it up? Dr. Foxton
  said you were a lawyer, I think, Dr. Jervis?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am a lawyer, but really I know nothing of the circumstances of
  this case. Did I understand that there had been something in the nature of a
  love affair?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;at least&mdash;well, perhaps I oughtn't to have said that. But
  hadn't I better tell you the whole story?&mdash;that is, if I am not taking
  up too much of your time."</p>

  <p>"I should be interested to hear what led to the disaster," said I.</p>

  <p>"Then," she said, "I will tell you all about it. Will you come indoors, or
  shall I walk a little way with you?"</p>

  <p>As I suspected that the police were at that moment on their way to the
  house, I chose the latter alternative and led her away seawards at a pretty
  brisk pace.</p>

  <p>"Was this poor lady a widow?" I asked, as we started up the street.</p>

  <p>"No, she wasn't," replied Mrs. Beddingfield, "and that was the trouble.
  Her husband was abroad&mdash;at least, he had been, and he was just coming
  home. A pretty home-coming it will be for him, poor man. He is an officer in
  the Civil Police at Sierra Leone, but he hasn't been there long. He went
  there for his health."</p>

  <p>"What! To Sierra Leone!" I exclaimed, for the "White Man's Grave" seemed a
  queer health resort.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You see, Mr. Toussaint is a French Canadian, and it seems that he
  has always been somewhat of a rolling stone. For some time he was in the
  Klondyke, but he suffered so much from the cold that he had to come away. It
  injured his health very severely; I don't quite know in what way, but I do
  know that he was quite a cripple for a time. When he got better he looked out
  for a post in a warm climate and eventually obtained the appointment of
  Inspector of Civil Police at Sierra Leone. That was about ten months ago, and
  when he sailed for Africa his wife came to stay with me, and has been here
  ever since."</p>

  <p>"And this love affair that you spoke of?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I oughtn't to have called it that. Let me explain what happened.
  About three months ago a Swedish gentleman&mdash;a Mr. Bergson&mdash;came to
  stay here, and he seemed to be very much smitten with Mrs. Toussaint."</p>

  <p>"And she?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, she liked him well enough. He is a tall, good-looking
  man&mdash;though for that matter he is no taller than her husband, nor any
  better-looking. Both men are over six feet. But there was no harm so far as
  she was concerned, excepting that she didn't see the position quite soon
  enough. She wasn't very discreet, in fact I thought it necessary to give her
  a little advice. However, Mr. Bergson left here and went to live at Ramsgate
  to superintend the unloading of the iceships (he came from Sweden in one),
  and I thought the trouble was at an end. But it wasn't, for he took to coming
  over to see Mrs. Toussaint, and of course I couldn't have that. So at last I
  had to tell him that he mustn't come to the house again. It was very
  unfortunate, for on that occasion I think he had been "tasting", as they say
  in Scotland. He wasn't drunk, but he was excitable and noisy, and when I told
  him he mustn't come again he made such a disturbance that two of the
  gentlemen boarders&mdash;Mr. Wardale and Mr. Macauley&mdash;had to interfere.
  And then he was most insulting to them, especially to Mr. Macauley, who is a
  coloured gentleman; called him a "buck nigger" and all sorts of offensive
  names."</p>

  <p>"And how did the coloured gentleman take it?"</p>

  <p>"Not very well, I am sorry to say, considering that he is a
  gentleman&mdash;a law student with chambers in the Temple. In fact, his
  language was so objectionable that Mr. Wardale insisted on my giving him
  notice on the spot. But I managed to get him taken in next door but one; you
  see, Mr. Wardale had been a Commissioner at, Sierra Leone&mdash;it was
  through him that Mr. Toussaint got his appointment&mdash;so I suppose he was
  rather on his dignity with coloured people."</p>

  <p>"And was that the last you heard of Mr. Bergson?"</p>

  <p>"He never came here again, but he wrote several times to Mrs. Toussaint,
  asking her to meet him. At last, only a few days ago, she wrote to him and
  told him that the acquaintance must cease."</p>

  <p>"And has it ceased?"</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, it has."</p>

  <p>"Then, Mrs. Beddingfield," said I, "what makes you connect the affair
  with&mdash;with what has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see," she explained, "there is the husband. He was coming home,
  and is probably in England already."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said I.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she continued. "He went up into the bush to arrest some natives
  belonging to one of these gangs of murderers&mdash;Leopard Societies, I think
  they are called&mdash;and he got seriously wounded. He wrote to his wife from
  hospital saying that he would be sent home as soon as he was fit to travel,
  and about ten days ago she got a letter from him saying that he was coming by
  the next ship.</p>

  <p>"I noticed that she seemed very nervous and upset when she got the letters
  from hospital, and still more so when the last letter came. Of course, I
  don't know what he said to her in those letters. It may be that he had heard
  something about Mr. Bergson, and threatened to take some action. Of course, I
  can't say. I only know that she was very nervous and restless, and when we
  saw in the paper four days ago that the ship he would be coming by had
  arrived in Liverpool she seemed dreadfully upset. And she got worse and worse
  until&mdash;well, until last night."</p>

  <p>"Has anything been heard of the husband since the ship arrived?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," replied Mrs. Beddingfield, with a meaning look at me
  which I had no difficulty in interpreting. "No letter, no telegram, not a
  word. And you see, if he hadn't come by that ship he would almost certainly
  have sent a letter to her. He must have arrived in England, but why hasn't he
  turned up, or at least sent a wire? What is he doing? Why is he staying away?
  Can he have heard something? And what does he mean to do? That's what kept
  the poor thing on wires, and that, I feel certain, is what drove her to make
  away with herself."</p>

  <p>It was not my business to contest Mrs. Beddingfield's erroneous
  deductions. I was seeking information&mdash;it seemed that I had nearly
  exhausted the present source. But one point required amplifying.</p>

  <p>"To return to Mr. Bergson, Mrs. Beddingfield," said I. "Do I understand
  that he is a seafaring man?"</p>

  <p>"He was," she replied. "At present he is settled at Ramsgate as manager of
  a company in the ice trade, but formerly he was a sailor. I have heard him
  say that he was one of the crew of an exploring ship that went in search of
  the North Pole and that he was locked up in the ice for months and months. I
  should have thought he would have had enough of ice after that."</p>

  <p>With this view I expressed warm agreement, and having now obtained all the
  information that appeared to be available I proceeded to bring the interview
  to an end.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mrs. Beddingfield," I said, "it is a rather mysterious affair.
  Perhaps more light may be thrown on it at the inquest. Meanwhile, I should
  think that it will be wise of you to keep your own counsel as far as
  outsiders are concerned."</p>

  <p>The remainder of the morning I spent pacing the smooth stretch of sand
  that lies to the east of the jetty, and reflecting on the evidence that I had
  acquired in respect of this singular crime. Evidently there was no lack of
  clues in this case. On the contrary, there were two quite obvious lines of
  inquiry, for both the Swede and the missing husband presented the characters
  of the hypothetical murderer. Both had been exposed to the conditions which
  tend to produce frost-bite; one of them had probably been a consumer of rye
  meal, and both might be said to have a motive&mdash;though, to be sure, it
  was a very insufficient one&mdash;for committing the crime. Still in both
  cases the evidence was merely speculative; it suggested a line of
  investigation but it did nothing more.</p>

  <p>When I met Foxton at lunch I was sensible of a curious change in his
  manner. His previous expansiveness had given place to marked reticence and a
  certain official secretiveness.</p>

  <p>"I don't think, you know, Jervis," he said, when I opened the subject,
  "that we had better discuss this affair. You see, I am the principal witness,
  and while the case is sub judice&mdash;well, in fact the police don't want
  the case talked about."</p>

  <p>"But surely I am a witness, too, and an expert witness,
  moreover&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That isn't the view of the police. They look on you as more or less of an
  amateur, and as you have no official connection with the case, I don't think
  they propose to subp&oelig;na you. Superintendent Platt, who is in charge of
  the case, wasn't very pleased at my having taken you to the house. Said it
  was quite irregular. Oh, and by the way, he says you must hand over those
  photographs."</p>

  <p>"But isn't Platt going to have the footprints photographed on his own
  account?" I objected.</p>

  <p>"Of course he is. He is going to have a set of proper photographs taken by
  an expert photographer&mdash;he was mightily amused when he heard about your
  little snapshot affair. Oh, you can trust Platt. He is a great man. He has
  had a course of instruction at the Fingerprint Department in London."</p>

  <p>"I don't see how that is going to help him, as there aren't any
  fingerprints in this case."</p>

  <p>This was a mere fly-cast on my part, but Foxton rose at once at the rather
  clumsy bait.</p>

  <p>"Oh, aren't there?" he exclaimed. "You didn't happen to spot them, but
  they were there. Platt has got the prints of a complete right hand. This is
  in strict confidence, you know," he added, with somewhat belated caution.</p>

  <p>Foxton's sudden reticence restrained me from uttering the obvious comment
  on the superintendent's achievement. I returned to the subject of the
  photographs.</p>

  <p>"Supposing I decline to hand over my film?" said I.</p>

  <p>"But I hope you won't&mdash;and in fact you mustn't. I am officially
  connected with the case, and I've got to live with these people. As the
  police-surgeon, I am responsible for the medical evidence, and Platt expects
  me to get those photographs from you. Obviously you can't keep them. It would
  be most irregular."</p>

  <p>It was useless to argue. Evidently the police did not want me to be
  introduced into the case, and after all the superintendent was within his
  rights, if he chose to regard me, as a private individual and to demand the
  surrender of the film.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless I was loath to give up the photographs, at least until I had
  carefully studied them. The case was within my own speciality of practice,
  and was a strange and interesting one. Moreover, it appeared to be in
  unskilful hands, judging from the fingerprint episode, and then experience
  had taught me to treasure up small scraps of chance evidence, since one never
  knew when one might be drawn into a case in a professional capacity. In
  effect, I decided not to give up the photographs, though that decision
  committed me to a ruse that I was not very willing to adopt. I would rather
  have acted quite straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>"Well if you insist, Foxton," I said, "I will hand over the film or, if
  you like, I will destroy it in your presence."</p>

  <p>"I think Platt would rather have the film uninjured," said Foxton. "Then
  he'll know, you know," he added, with a sly grin.</p>

  <p>In my heart, I thanked Foxton for that grin. It made my own guileful
  proceedings so much easier; for a suspicious man invites you to get the
  better of him if you can.</p>

  <p>After lunch I went up to my room, locked the door and took the little
  camera from my pocket. Having fully wound up the film, I extracted it,
  wrapped it up carefully and bestowed it in my inside breast-pocket. Then I
  inserted a fresh film, and going to the open window, took four successive
  snapshots of the sky. This done, I closed the camera, slipped it into my
  pocket and went downstairs. Foxton was in the hall, brushing his hat, as I
  descended, and at once renewed his demand.</p>

  <p>"About those photographs, Jervis," said he; "I shall be looking in at the
  police-station presently, so if you wouldn't mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To be sure," said I. "I will give you the film now if you like."</p>

  <p>Taking the camera from my pocket, I solemnly wound up the remainder of the
  film, extracted it, stuck down the loose end with ostentatious care, and
  handed it to him.</p>

  <p>"Better not expose it to the light," I said, going the whole hog of
  deception, "or you may fog the exposures."</p>

  <p>Foxton took the spool from me as if it were hot&mdash;he was not a
  photographer&mdash;and thrust it into his handbag. He was still thanking me
  the quite profusely when the front-door bell rang.</p>

  <p>The visitor who stood revealed when Foxton opened the door was a small,
  spare gentleman with a complexion of peculiar brown-papery quality that
  suggests long residence the tropics. He stepped in briskly and introduced
  himself and his business without preamble.</p>

  <p>"My name is Wardale&mdash;boarder at Beddingfield's. I called with
  reference to the tragic event which&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Foxton interposed in his frostiest official tone. "I am afraid, Mr.
  Wardale, I can't give you any information about the case at present."</p>

  <p>"I saw you two gentlemen at the house this morning&mdash;" Mr. Wardale
  continued, but Foxton again cut him short.</p>

  <p>"You did. We were there&mdash;or at least, I was&mdash;as representative
  of the Law, and while the case is sub judice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It isn't yet," interrupted Wardale.</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't enter into any discussion of it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not asking you to," said Wardale a little impatiently. "But I
  understand that one of you is Dr. Jervis."</p>

  <p>"I am," said I.</p>

  <p>"I must really warn you&mdash;" Foxton began again; but Mr. Wardale
  interrupted testily:</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, I am a lawyer and a magistrate and understand perfectly well
  what is and what is not permissible. I have come simply to make a
  professional engagement with Dr. Jervis."</p>

  <p>"In what way can I be of service to you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," said Mr. Wardale. "This poor lady, whose death has
  occurred in so mysterious a manner, was the wife of a man who was, like
  myself a servant of the Government of Sierra Leone. I was the friend of both
  of them, and in the absence of the husband I should like to have the inquiry
  into the circumstances of this lady's death watched by a competent lawyer
  with the necessary special knowledge of medical evidence. Will you or your
  colleague, Dr. Thorndyke, undertake to watch the case for me?"</p>

  <p>Of course I was willing to undertake the case and said so.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Mr. Wardale, "I will instruct my solicitor to write to you
  and formally retain you in the case. Here is my card. You will find my name
  in the Colonial Office List, and you know my address here."</p>

  <p>He handed me his card, wished us both good afternoon, and then, with a
  stiff little bow, turned and took his departure.</p>

  <p>"I think I had better run up to town and confer with Thorndyke," said I.
  "How do the trains run?"</p>

  <p>"There is a good train in about three-quarters of an hour," replied
  Foxton.</p>

  <p>"Then I will go by it, but I shall come down again to-morrow or the next
  day, and probably Thorndyke will come down with me."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Foxton. "Bring him in to lunch or dinner, but I can't
  put him up, I am afraid."</p>

  <p>"It would be better not," said I. "Your friend Platt wouldn't like it. He
  won't want Thorndyke&mdash;or me either for that matter. And what about those
  photographs? Thorndyke will want them, you know."</p>

  <p>"He can't have them," said Foxton doggedly, "unless Platt is willing to
  hand them back; which I don't suppose he will be."</p>

  <p>I had private reasons for thinking otherwise, but I kept them to myself;
  and as Foxton went forth on his afternoon round, I returned upstairs to pack
  my suitcase and write the telegram to Thorndyke informing him of my
  movements.</p>

  <p>It was only a quarter past five when I let myself into our chambers in
  King's Bench Walk. To my relief I found my colleague at home and our
  laboratory assistant, Polton, in the act of laying tea, for two.</p>

  <p>"I gather," said Thorndyke, as we shook hands, "that my learned brother
  brings grist to the mill?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied. "Nominally a watching brief, but I think you will agree
  with me that it is a case for independent investigation."</p>

  <p>"Will there be anything in my line, sir?" inquired Polton, who was always
  agog at the word 'investigation'.</p>

  <p>"There is a film to be developed. Four exposures of white footprints on a
  dark ground."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Polton, "you'll want good strong negatives, and they ought to
  be enlarged if they are, from the little camera. Can you give me the
  dimensions?"</p>

  <p>I wrote out the measurements from my notebook and handed him the paper
  together with the spool of film, with which he retired gleefully to the
  laboratory.</p>

  <p>"And now, Jervis," said Thorndyke, "while Polton is operating on the film
  and we are discussing our tea, let us have a sketch of the case."</p>

  <p>I gave him more than a sketch, for the events were recent and I had
  carefully sorted out the facts during my journey to town, making rough notes,
  which I now consulted. To my rather lengthy recital he listened in his usual
  attentive manner, without any comment, excepting in regard to my
  man&oelig;uvre to retain possession of the exposed film.</p>

  <p>"It's almost a pity you didn't refuse." said he. "They could hardly have
  enforced their demand, and my feeling is that it is more convenient as well
  as more dignified to avoid direct deception unless one is driven to it. But
  perhaps you considered that you were."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact I had at the time, but I had since come to Thorndyke's
  opinion. My little man&oelig;uvre was going to be a source of inconvenience
  presently.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, when I had finished my recital, "I think we may
  take it that the police theory is, in the main, your own theory derived from
  Foxton."</p>

  <p>"I think so, excepting that I learned from Foxton that Superintendent
  Platt has obtained the complete fingerprints of a right hand."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke raised his eyebrows. "Fingerprints!" he exclaimed. "Why, the
  fellow must be a mere simpleton. But there," he added,
  "everybody&mdash;police, lawyers, judges, even Galton himself&mdash;seems to
  lose every vestige of common sense as soon as the subject of fingerprints is
  raised. But it would be interesting to know how he got them and what they are
  like. We must try to find that out. However, to return to your case, since
  your theory and the police theory are probably the same, we may as well
  consider the value of your inferences.</p>

  <p>"At present we are dealing with the case in the abstract. Our data are
  largely assumptions, and our inferences are largely derived from an
  application of the mathematical laws of probability. Thus we assume that a
  murder has been committed, whereas it may turn out to have been suicide. We
  assume the murder to have been committed by the person, who made the
  footprints, and we assume that that person has no little toes, whereas he may
  have retracted little toes which do not touch the ground and so leave no
  impression. Assuming the little toes to be absent, we account for their
  absence by considering known causes in the order of their probability.
  Excluding&mdash;quite properly, I think&mdash;Raynaud's disease, we arrive at
  frost-bite and ergotism.</p>

  <p>"But two persons, both of whom are of a stature corresponding to the size
  of the footprints, may have had a motive&mdash;though a very inadequate
  one&mdash;for committing the crime, and both have been exposed to the
  conditions which tend to produce frost-bite, while one of them has, probably,
  been exposed to the conditions which tend to produce ergotism. The laws of
  probability point to both of these two men; and the chances in favour of the
  Swede being the murderer rather than the Canadian would be represented by the
  common factor&mdash;frost-bite&mdash;multiplied by the additional factor,
  ergotism. But this is purely speculative at present. There is no evidence
  that either man has ever been frost-bitten or has ever eaten spurred rye.
  Nevertheless, it is a perfectly sound method at this stage. It indicates a
  line of investigation. If it should transpire that either man has suffered
  from frost-bite or ergotism, a definite advance would have been made. But
  here is Polton with a couple of finished prints. How on earth did you manage
  it in the time, Polton?"</p>

  <p>"Why, you see, sir, I just dried the film with spirit," replied Polton.
  "It saved a lot of time. I will let you have a pair of enlargements in about
  a quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>Handing us the two wet prints, each stuck on a glass plate, he retired to
  the laboratory, and Thorndyke and I proceeded to scrutinize the photographs
  with the aid of our pocket lenses. The promised enlargements were really
  hardly necessary excepting for the purpose of comparative measurements, for
  the image of the white footprint, fully two inches long, was so
  microscopically sharp that, with the assistance of the lens, the minutest
  detail could be clearly seen.</p>

  <p>"There is certainly not a vestige of little toe," remarked Thorndyke, "and
  the plump appearance of the other toes supports your rejection of Raynaud's
  disease. Does the character of the footprint convey any other suggestion to
  you, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>"It gives me the impression that the man had been accustomed to go
  bare-footed in early life and had only taken to boots comparatively recently.
  The position of the great toe suggests this, and the presence of a number of
  small scars on the toes and ball of the foot seems to confirm it. A person
  walking bare-foot would sustain innumerable small wounds from treading on
  small, sharp objects."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked dissatisfied. "I agree with you," he said, "as to the
  suggestion offered by the undeformed state of the great toes; but those
  little pits do not convey to me the impression of scars produced as you
  suggest. Still, you may be right."</p>

  <p>Here our conversation was interrupted by a knock on the outer oak.
  Thorndyke stepped out through the lobby and I heard him open the door. A
  moment or two later he re-entered, accompanied by a short, brown-faced
  gentleman whom I instantly recognized as Mr. Wardale.</p>

  <p>"I must have come up by the same train as you," he remarked, as we shook
  hands, "and to a certain extent, I suspect, on the same errand. I thought I
  would like to put our arrangement on a business footing, as I am a stranger
  to both of you."</p>

  <p>"What do you want us to do?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I want you to watch the case, and, if necessary, to look into the facts
  independently."</p>

  <p>"Can you give us any information that may help us?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Wardale reflected. "I don't think I can," he said at length. "I have
  no facts that you have not, and any surmises of mine might be misleading. I
  had rather you kept an open mind. But perhaps we might go into the question
  of costs."</p>

  <p>This, of course, was somewhat difficult, but Thorndyke contrived to
  indicate the probable liabilities involved, to Mr. Wardale's
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"There is one other little matter," said Wardale, as he rose to depart. "I
  have got a suitcase here which Mrs. Beddingfield lent me to bring somethings
  up to town. It is one that Mr. Macauley left behind when he went away from
  the boarding-house. Mrs. Beddingfield suggested that I might leave it at his
  chambers when I had finished with it; but I don't know his address, excepting
  that it is somewhere in the Temple, and I don't want to meet the fellow if he
  should happen to have come up to town."</p>

  <p>"Is it empty?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Excepting for a suit of pyjamas and a pair of shocking old slippers." He
  opened the suitcase as he spoke and exhibited its contents with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Characteristic of a negro, isn't it? Pink silk pyjamas and slippers about
  three sizes too small."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke. "I will get my man to find out the address
  and leave it there."</p>

  <p>As Mr. Wardale went out, Polton entered with the enlarged photographs,
  which showed the footprints the natural size. Thorndyke handed them to me,
  and as I sat down to examine them he followed his assistant to the
  laboratory. He returned in a few minutes, and after a brief inspection of the
  photographs, remarked:</p>

  <p>"They show us nothing more than we have seen, though they may be useful
  later. So your stock of facts is all we have to go on at present. Are you
  going home to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I shall go back to Margate to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Then, as I have to call at Scotland Yard, we may as well walk to Charing
  Cross together."</p>

  <p>As we walked down the Strand we gossiped on general topics, but before we
  separated at Charing Cross, Thorndyke reverted to the case.</p>

  <p>"Let me know the date of the inquest," said he, "and try to find out what
  the poison was&mdash;if it was really a poison."</p>

  <p>"The liquid that was left in the bottle seemed to be a watery solution of
  some kind," said I, "as I think I mentioned."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke. "Possibly a watery infusion of strophanthus."</p>

  <p>"Why strophanthus?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" demanded Thorndyke. And with this and an inscrutable smile, he
  turned and walked down Whitehall.</p>

  <p>Three days later I found myself at Margate&mdash;sitting beside Thorndyke
  in a room adjoining the Town Hall, in which the inquest on the death of Mrs.
  Toussaint was to be held. Already the coroner was in his chair, the jury were
  in their seats and the witnesses assembled in a group of chairs apart. These
  included Foxton, a stranger who sat by him&mdash;presumably the other medical
  witness&mdash;Mrs. Beddingfield, Mr. Wardale, the police superintendent and a
  well-dressed coloured man, whom I correctly assumed to be Mr. Macauley.</p>

  <p>As I sat by my rather sphinx-like colleague my mind recurred for the
  hundredth time to his extraordinary powers of mental synthesis. That parting
  remark of his as to the possible nature of the poison had brought home to me
  in a flash the fact that he already had a definite theory of this crime, and
  that his theory was not mine nor that of the police. True, the poison might
  not be strophanthus, after all, but that would not alter the position. He had
  a theory of the crime, but yet he was in possession of no facts excepting
  those with which I had supplied him. Therefore those facts contained the
  material for a theory, whereas I had deduced from them nothing but the bald,
  ambiguous mathematical probabilities.</p>

  <p>The first witness called was naturally Dr. Foxton, who described the
  circumstances already known to me. He further stated that he had been present
  at the autopsy, that he had found on the throat and limbs of the deceased
  bruises that suggested a struggle and violent restraint. The immediate cause
  of death was heart failure, but whether that failure was due to shock,
  terror, or the action of a poison he could not positively say.</p>

  <p>The next witness was a Dr. Prescott, an expert pathologist and
  toxicologist. He had made the autopsy and agreed with Dr. Foxton as to the
  cause of death. He had examined the liquid contained in the bottle taken from
  the hand of the deceased and found it to be a watery infusion or decoction of
  strophanthus seeds. He had analysed the fluid contained in the stomach and
  found it to consist largely of the same infusion.</p>

  <p>"Is infusion of strophanthus seeds used in medicine?" the coroner
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No," was the reply. "The tincture is the form in which strophanthus is
  administered unless it is given in the form of strophanthine."</p>

  <p>"Do you consider that the strophanthus caused or contributed to
  death?"</p>

  <p>"It is difficult to say," replied Dr. Prescott. "Strophanthus is a heart
  poison, and there was a very large poisonous dose. But very little had been
  absorbed, and the appearances were not inconsistent with death from
  shock."</p>

  <p>"Could death have been self-produced by the voluntary taking of the
  poison?" asked the coroner.</p>

  <p>"I should say, decidedly not. Dr. Foxton's evidence shows that the bottle
  was almost certainly placed in the hands of the deceased after death, and
  this is in complete agreement with the enormous dose and small
  absorption."</p>

  <p>"Would you say that appearances point to suicidal or homicidal
  poisoning?"</p>

  <p>"I should say that they point to homicidal poisoning, but that death was
  probably due mainly to shock."</p>

  <p>This concluded the expert's evidence. It was followed by that of Mrs.
  Beddingfield, which brought out nothing new to me but the fact that a trunk
  had been broken open and a small attaché-case belonging to the deceased
  abstracted and taken away.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what the deceased kept in that case?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"I have seen her put her husband's letters into it. She had quite a number
  of them. I don't know what else she kept in it except, of course, her
  cheque-book."</p>

  <p>"Had she any considerable balance at the bank?"</p>

  <p>"I believe she had. Her husband used to send most of his pay home and she
  used to pay it in and leave it with the bank. She might have two or three
  hundred pounds to her credit."</p>

  <p>As Mrs. Beddingfield concluded Mr. Wardale was called, and he was followed
  by Mr. Macauley. The evidence of both was quite brief and concerned entirely
  with the disturbance made by Bergson, whose absence from the court I had
  already noted.</p>

  <p>The last witness was the police superintendent, and he, as I had expected,
  was decidedly reticent. He did refer to the footprints, but, like
  Foxton&mdash;who presumably had his instructions&mdash;he abstained from
  describing their peculiarities. Nor did he say anything about fingerprints.
  As to the identity of the criminal, that had to be further inquired into.
  Suspicion had at first fastened upon Bergson, but it had since transpired
  that the Swede sailed from Ramsgate on an ice-ship two days before the
  occurrence of the tragedy. Then suspicion had pointed to the husband, who was
  known to have landed at Liverpool four days before the death of his wife and
  who had mysteriously disappeared. But he (the superintendent) had only that
  morning received a telegram from the Liverpool police informing him that the
  body of Toussaint had been found floating in the Mersey, and that it bore a
  number of wounds of an apparently homicidal character. Apparently he had been
  murdered and his corpse thrown into the river.</p>

  <p>"This is very terrible," said the coroner. "Does this second murder throw
  any light on the case which we are investigating?"</p>

  <p>"I think it does," replied the officer, without any great conviction,
  however; "but it is not advisable to go into details."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," agreed the coroner. "Most inexpedient. But are we to
  understand that you have a clue to the perpetrator of this
  crime&mdash;assuming a crime to have been committed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Platt. "We have several important clues."</p>

  <p>"And do they point to any particular individual?"</p>

  <p>The superintendent hesitated. "Well..." he began with some embarrassment,
  but the coroner interrupted him:</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the question is indiscreet. We mustn't hamper the police,
  gentlemen, and the point is not really material to our inquiry. You would
  rather we waived that question, Superintendent?"</p>

  <p>"If you please, sir," was the emphatic reply.</p>

  <p>"Have any cheques from the deceased woman's cheque book been presented at
  the bank?"</p>

  <p>"Not since her death. I inquired at the bank only this morning."</p>

  <p>This concluded the evidence, and after a brief but capable summing-up by
  the coroner, the jury returned a verdict of "Wilful murder against some
  person unknown".</p>

  <p>As the proceedings terminated, Thorndyke rose and turned round, and then
  to my surprise I perceived Superintendent Miller, of the Criminal
  Investigation Department, who had come in unperceived by me and was sitting
  immediately behind us.</p>

  <p>"I have followed your instructions, sir," said he, addressing Thorndyke,
  "but before we take any definite action I should like to have a few words
  with you."</p>

  <p>He led the way to an adjoining room and, as we entered we were followed by
  Superintendent Platt and Dr. Foxton.</p>

  <p>"Now, Doctor," said Miller, carefully closing the door, "I have carried
  out your suggestions. Mr. Macauley is being detained, but before we commit
  ourselves to an arrest we must have something to go upon. I shall want you to
  make out a prima facie case."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke, laying upon the table the small green
  suitcase that was his almost invariable companion.</p>

  <p>"I've seen that prima facie case before," Miller remarked with a grin, as
  Thorndyke unlocked it and drew out a large envelope. "Now, what have you got
  there?"</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke extracted from the envelope Polton's enlargements of my small
  photographs, Platt's eyes appeared to bulge, while Foxton gave me a quick
  glance of reproach.</p>

  <p>"These," said Thorndyke "are the full-sized photographs of the footprints
  of the suspected murderer. Superintendent Platt can probably verify
  them."</p>

  <p>Rather reluctantly Platt produced from his pocket a pair of whole-plate
  photographs, which he laid beside the enlargements.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miller, after comparing them, "they are the same footprints.
  But you say, Doctor, that they are Macauley's footprints. Now, what evidence
  have you?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke again had recourse to the green case, from which he produced two
  copper plates mounted on wood and coated with printing ink.</p>

  <p>"I propose," said he, lifting the plates out of their protecting frame,
  "that we take prints of Macauley's feet and compare them with the
  photographs."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Platt. "And then there are the fingerprints that we've got. We
  can test those, too."</p>

  <p>"You don't want fingerprints if you've got a set of toeprints," objected
  Miller.</p>

  <p>"With regard to those fingerprints," said Thorndyke. "May I ask if they
  were obtained from the bottle?"</p>

  <p>"They were," Platt admitted.</p>

  <p>"And were there any other fingerprints?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Platt. "These were the only ones."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he laid on the table a photograph showing the prints of the
  thumb and fingers of a right hand.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke glanced at the photograph and, turning to Miller, said:</p>

  <p>"I suggest that those are Dr. Foxton's fingerprints."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Platt, and then suddenly fell silent.</p>

  <p>"We can soon see," said Thorndyke, producing from the case a pad of white
  paper. "If Dr. Foxton will lay the finger-tips of his right hand first on
  this inked plate and then on the paper, we can compare the prints with the
  photograph."</p>

  <p>Foxton placed his fingers on the blackened plate and then pressed them on
  the paper pad, leaving on the latter four beautifully clear, black
  fingerprints. These Superintendent Platt scrutinized eagerly, and as his
  glance travelled from the prints to the photographs he broke into a sheepish
  grin.</p>

  <p>"Sold again!" he muttered. "They are the same prints."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, in a tone of disgust, "you must have been a mug not
  to have thought of that when you knew that Dr. Foxton had handled the
  bottle."</p>

  <p>"The fact, however, is important," said Thorndyke. "The absence of any
  fingerprints but Dr. Foxton's not only suggests that the murderer took the
  precaution to wear gloves, but especially it proves that the bottle was not
  handled by the deceased during life. A suicide's hands will usually be pretty
  moist and would leave conspicuous, if not very clear, impressions."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Miller, "that is quite true. But with regard to these
  footprints. We can't compel this man to let us examine his feet without
  arresting him. Don't think, Dr. Thorndyke, that I suspect you of guessing.
  I've known you too long for that. You've got your facts all right, I don't
  doubt, but you must let us have enough to justify our arrest."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's answer was to plunge once more into the inexhaustible green
  case, from which he now produced two objects wrapped in tissue-paper. The
  paper being removed, there was revealed what looked like a model of an
  excessively shabby pair of brown shoes.</p>

  <p>"These," said Thorndyke, exhibiting the "models" to Superintendent
  Miller&mdash;who viewed them with an undisguised grin&mdash;"are plaster
  casts of the interiors of a pair of slippers&mdash;very old and much too
  tight&mdash;belonging to Mr. Macauley. His name was written inside them. The
  casts have been waxed and painted with raw umber, which has been lightly
  rubbed off, thus accentuating the prominences and depressions. You will
  notice that the impressions of the toes on the soles and of the "knuckles" on
  the uppers appear as prominences; in fact we have in these casts a sketchy
  reproduction of the actual feet.</p>

  <p>"Now, first as to dimensions. Dr. Jervis's measurements of the footprints
  give us ten inches and three-quarters as, the extreme length and four inches
  and five-eighths as the extreme width at the heads of the metatarsus. On
  these casts, as you see, the extreme length is ten inches and
  five-eighths&mdash;the loss of one-eighth being accounted for by the curve of
  the sole&mdash;and the extreme width is four inches and a
  quarter&mdash;three-eighths being accounted for by the lateral compression of
  a tight slipper. The agreement of the dimensions is remarkable, considering
  the unusual size. And now as to the peculiarities of the feet.</p>

  <p>"You notice that each toe has made a perfectly distinct impression on the
  sole, excepting the little toe; of which there is no trace in either cast.
  And, turning to the uppers, you notice that the knuckles of the toes appear
  quite distinct and prominent&mdash;again excepting the little toes, which
  have made no impression at all. Thus it is not a case of retracted little
  toes, for they would appear as an extra prominence. Then, looking at the feet
  as a whole, it is evident that the little toes are absent; there is a
  distinct hollow, where there should be a prominence."</p>

  <p>"M'yes," said Miller dubiously, "it's all very neat. But isn't it just a
  bit speculative?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, come, Miller," protested Thorndyke; "just consider the facts. Here is
  a suspected murderer known to have feet of an unusual size and presenting a
  very rare deformity; and they are the feet of a man who had actually lived in
  the same house as the murdered woman and who, at the date of the crime, was
  living only two doors away. What more would you have?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there is the question of motive," objected Miller.</p>

  <p>"That hardly belongs to a prima facie case," said Thorndyke. "But even if
  it did, is there not ample matter for suspicion? Remember who the murdered
  woman was, what her husband was, and who this Sierra Leone gentleman is."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes; that's true," said Miller somewhat hastily, either perceiving
  the drift of Thorndyke's argument (which I did not), or being unwilling to
  admit that he was still in the dark. "Yes, we'll have the fellow in and get
  his actual footprints."</p>

  <p>He went to the door and, putting his head out, made some sign, which was
  almost immediately followed by a trampling of feet, and Macauley entered the
  room, followed by two large plain-clothes policemen. The negro was evidently
  alarmed, for he looked about him with the wild expression of a hunted animal.
  But his manner was aggressive and truculent.</p>

  <p>"Why am I being interfered with in this impertinent manner?" he demanded
  in the deep buzzing voice characteristic of the male negro.</p>

  <p>"We want to have a look at your feet, Mr. Macauley," said Miller. "Will
  you kindly take off your shoes and socks?"</p>

  <p>"No," roared Macauley. "I'll see you damned first!"</p>

  <p>"Then," said Miller, "I arrest you on a charge of having
  murdered&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The rest of the sentence was drowned in a sudden uproar. The tall,
  powerful negro, bellowing like an angry bull, had whipped out a large,
  strangely-shaped knife and charged furiously at the Superintendent. But the
  two plain-clothes men had been watching him from behind and now sprang upon
  him, each seizing an arm. Two sharp, metallic clicks in quick succession, a
  thunderous crash and an ear-splitting yell, and the formidable barbarian lay
  prostrate on the floor with one massive constable sitting astride his chest
  and the other seated on his knees.</p>

  <p>"Now's your chance, Doctor," said Miller. "I'll get his shoes and socks
  off."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke re-inked his plates, Miller and the local superintendent
  expertly removed the smart patent shoes and the green silk socks from the
  feet of the writhing, bellowing negro. Then Thorndyke rapidly and skilfully
  applied the inked plates to the soles of the feet&mdash;which I steadied for
  the purpose&mdash;and followed up with a dexterous pressure of the paper pad,
  first to one foot and then&mdash;having torn off the printed sheet&mdash;to
  the other. In spite of the difficulties occasioned by Macauley's struggles,
  each sheet presented a perfectly clear and sharp print of the sole of the
  foot, even the ridge-patterns of the toes and ball of the foot being quite
  distinct. Thorndyke laid each of the new prints on the table beside the
  corresponding large photograph, and invited the two superintendents to
  compare them.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miller&mdash;and Superintendent Platt nodded his
  acquiescence&mdash;"there can't be a shadow of a doubt. The ink-prints and
  the photographs are identical, to every line and skin-marking. You've made
  out your case, Doctor, as you always do."</p>

  <p>"So you see," said Thorndyke, as we smoked our evening pipes on the old
  stone pier, "your method was a perfectly sound one, only you didn't apply it
  properly. Like too many mathematicians, you started on your calculations
  before you had secured your data. If you had applied the simple laws of
  probability to the real data, they would have pointed straight to
  Macauley."</p>

  <p>"How do you suppose he lost his little toes?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose at all. Obviously it was a clear case of double
  ainhum."</p>

  <p>"Ainhum!" I exclaimed with a sudden flash of recollection.</p>

  <p>"Yes; that was what you overlooked, you compared the probabilities of
  three diseases either of which only very rarely causes the loss of even one
  little toe and infinitely rarely causes the loss of both, and none of which
  conditions is confined to any definite class of persons; and you ignored
  ainhum, a disease which attacks almost exclusively the little toe, causing it
  to drop off, and quite commonly destroys both little toes&mdash;a disease,
  moreover, which is confined to the black-skinned races. In European practice
  ainhum is unknown, but in Africa, and to a less extent in India, it is quite
  common.</p>

  <p>"If you were to assemble all the men in the world who have lost both
  little toes more than nine-tenths of them would be suffering from ainhum; so
  that, by the laws of probability, your footprints were, by nine chances to
  one, those of a man who had suffered from ainhum, and therefore a
  black-skinned man. But as soon as you had established a black man as the
  probable criminal, you opened up a new field of corroborative evidence. There
  was a black man on the spot. That man was a native of Sierra Leone and almost
  certainly a man of importance there. But the victim's husband had deadly
  enemies in the native secret societies of Sierra Leone. The letters of the
  husband to the wife probably contained matter incriminating certain natives
  of Sierra Leone. The evidence became cumulative, you see. Taken as a whole,
  it pointed plainly to Macauley, apart from the new fact of the murder of
  Toussaint in Liverpool, a city with a considerable floating population of
  West Africans."</p>

  <p>"And I gather from your reference to the African poison, strophanthus,
  that you fixed on Macauley at once when I gave you my sketch of the
  case?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; especially when I saw your photographs of the footprints with the
  absent little toes and those characteristic chigger-scars on the toes that
  remained. But it was sheer luck that enabled me to fit the keystone into its
  place and turn mere probability into virtual certainty. I could have embraced
  the magician Wardale when he brought us the magic slippers. Still, it isn't
  an absolute certainty, even now, though I expect it will be by
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>And Thorndyke was right. That very evening the police entered Macauley's
  chambers in Tanfield Court, where they discovered the dead woman's
  attaché-case. It still contained Toussaint's letters to his wife, and one of
  those letters mentioned by name, as members of a dangerous secret society,
  several prominent Sierra Leone men, including the accused, David
  Macauley.</p>

  <h2><a name="c2"
     id="c2"></a>II. &mdash; THE BLUE SCARAB</h2>

  <p>Medico-legal practice is largely concerned with crimes against the person,
  the details of which are often sordid, gruesome and unpleasant. Hence the
  curious and romantic case of the Blue Scarab (though really outside our
  speciality) came as somewhat of a relief. But to me it is of interest
  principally as illustrating two of the remarkable gifts which made my friend,
  Thorndyke, unique as an investigator: his uncanny power of picking out the
  one essential fact at a glance, and his capacity to produce, when required,
  inexhaustible stores of unexpected knowledge of the most out-of-the-way
  subjects.</p>

  <p>It was late in the afternoon when Mr. James Blowgrave arrived, by
  appointment, at our chambers, accompanied by his daughter, a rather
  strikingly pretty girl of about twenty-two; and when we had mutually
  introduced ourselves, the consultation began without preamble.</p>

  <p>"I didn't give any details in my letter to you," said Mr. Blowgrave. "I
  thought it better not to, for fear you might decline the case. It is really a
  matter of a robbery, but not quite an ordinary robbery. There are some
  unusual and rather mysterious features in the case. And as the police hold
  out very little hope, I have come to ask if you will give me your opinion on
  the case and perhaps look into it for me. But first I had better tell you how
  the affair happened.</p>

  <p>"The robbery occurred just a fortnight ago, about half-past nine o'clock
  in the evening. I was sitting in my study with my daughter, looking over some
  things that I had taken from a small deed-box, when a servant rushed in to
  tell us that one of the outbuildings was on fire. Now, my study opens by a
  French window on the garden at the back, and, as the outbuilding was in a
  meadow at the side of the garden, I went out that way, leaving the French
  window open; but before going I hastily put the things back in the deed-box
  and locked it.</p>

  <p>"The building&mdash;which I used partly as a lumber store and partly as a
  workshop&mdash;was well alight and the whole household was already on the
  spot, the boy working the pump and the two maids carrying the buckets and
  throwing water on the fire. My daughter and I joined the party and helped to
  carry the buckets and take out what goods we could reach from the burning
  building. But it was nearly half an hour before we got the fire completely
  extinguished, and then my daughter and I went to our rooms to wash and tidy
  ourselves up. We returned to the study together, and when I had shut the
  French window my daughter proposed that we should resume our interrupted
  occupation. Thereupon I took out of my pocket the key of the deed-box and
  turned to the cabinet on which the box always stood.</p>

  <p>"But there was no deed-box there.</p>

  <p>"For a moment I thought I must have moved it, and cast my eyes round the
  room in search of it. But it was nowhere to be seen, and a moment's
  reflection reminded me that I had left it in its usual place. The only
  possible conclusion was that during our absence at the fire, somebody must
  have come in by the window and taken it. And it looked as if that somebody
  had deliberately set fire to the outbuilding for the express purpose of
  luring us all out of the house."</p>

  <p>"That is what the appearances suggest," Thorndyke agreed. "Is the study
  window furnished with a blind, or curtains?"</p>

  <p>"Curtains," replied Mr. Blowgrave. "But they were not drawn. Anyone in the
  garden could have seen into the room; and the garden is easily accessible to
  an active person who could climb over a low wall."</p>

  <p>"So far, then," said Thorndyke, "the robbery might be the work of a casual
  prowler who had got into the garden and watched you through the window, and
  assuming that the things you had taken from the box were of value, seized an
  easy opportunity to make off with them. Were the things of any considerable
  value?"</p>

  <p>"To a thief they were of no value at all. There were a number of share
  certificates, a lease, one or two agreements, some family photographs and a
  small box containing an old letter and a scarab. Nothing worth stealing, you
  see, for the certificates were made out in my name and were therefore
  unnegotiable."</p>

  <p>"And the scarab?"</p>

  <p>"That may have been lapis lazuli, but more probably it was a blue glass
  imitation. In any case it was of no considerable value. It was about an inch
  and a half long. But before you come to any conclusion, I had better finish
  the story. The robbery was on Tuesday, the 7th of June. I gave information to
  the police, with a description of the missing property, but nothing happened
  until Wednesday, the 15th, when I received a registered parcel bearing the
  Southampton postmark. On opening it I found, to my astonishment, the entire
  contents of the deed-box, with the exception of the scarab, and this rather
  mysterious communication."</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket and handed to Thorndyke an ordinary envelope
  addressed in typewritten characters, and sealed with a large, elliptical
  seal, the face of which was covered with minute hieroglyphics.</p>

  <p>"This," said Thorndyke, "I take to be an impression of the scarab; and an
  excellent impression it is."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Mr. Blowgrave, "I have no doubt that it is the scarab. It
  is about the same size."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked quickly at our client with an expression of surprise.
  "But," he asked, "don't you recognise the hieroglyphics on it?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Blowgrave smiled deprecatingly. "The fact is," said he, "I don't know
  anything about hieroglyphics, but I should say, as far as I can judge, these
  look the same. What do you think, Nellie?"</p>

  <p>Miss Blowgrave looked at the seal vaguely and replied, "I am in the same
  position. Hieroglyphics are to me just funny things that don't mean anything.
  But these look the same to me as those on our scarab, though I expect any
  other hieroglyphics would, for that matter."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke made no comment on this statement, but examined the seal
  attentively through his lens. Then he drew out the contents of the envelope,
  consisting of two letters, one typewritten and the other in a faded brown
  handwriting. The former he read through and then inspected the paper closely,
  holding it up to the light to observe the watermark.</p>

  <p>"The paper appears to be of Belgian manufacture," he remarked, passing it
  to me. I confirmed this observation and then read the letter, which was
  headed "Southampton" and ran thus:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">DEAR OLD PAL,</p>

  <p class="typewriter">I am sending you back some trifles removed in error.
  The ancient document is enclosed with this, but the curio is at present in
  the custody of my respected uncle. Hope its temporary loss will not
  inconvenience you, and that I may be able to return it to you later.
  Meanwhile, believe me,</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Your ever affectionate,</p>

  <p class="typewriter">RUDOLPHO.</p><br>

  <p>"Who is Rudolpho?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The Lord knows," replied Mr. Blowgrave. "A pseudonym of our absent
  friend, I presume. He seems to be a facetious sort of person."</p>

  <p>"He does," agreed Thorndyke. "This letter and the seal appear to be what
  the schoolboys would call a leg-pull. But still, this is all quite normal. He
  has returned you the worthless things and has kept the one thing that has any
  sort of negotiable value. Are you quite clear that the scarab is not more
  valuable than you have assumed?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Blowgrave, "I have had an expert's opinion on it. I
  showed it to M. Fouquet, the Egyptologist, when he was over here from
  Brussels a few months ago, and his opinion was that it was a worthless
  imitation. Not only was it not a genuine scarab, but the inscription was a
  sham, too; just a collection of hieroglyphic characters jumbled together
  without sense or meaning."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, taking another look at the seal through his lens,
  "it would seem that Rudolpho, or Rudolpho's uncle, has got a bad bargain.
  Which doesn't throw much light on the affair."</p>

  <p>At this point Miss Blowgrave intervened. "I think, father," said she, "you
  have not given Dr. Thorndyke quite all the facts about the scarab. He ought
  to be told about its connection with Uncle Reuben."</p>

  <p>As the girl spoke Thorndyke looked at her with curious expression of
  suddenly awakened interest. Later I understood the meaning of that look, but
  at the time there seemed to me nothing particularly arresting in her
  words.</p>

  <p>"It is just a family tradition," Mr. Blowgrave said deprecatingly.
  "probably it is all nonsense."</p>

  <p>"Well, let us have it, at any rate," said Thorndyke. "We may get some
  light from it."</p>

  <p>Thus urged, Mr. Blowgrave hemmed a little shyly and began:</p>

  <p>"The story concerns my great-grandfather Silas Blowgrave, and his doings
  during the war with France. It seems that he commanded a privateer of which
  he and his brother Reuben were the joint owners, and that in the course of
  their last cruise they acquired a very remarkable and valuable collection of
  jewels. Goodness knows how they got them; not very honestly, I suspect, for
  they appear to have been a pair of precious rascals. Something has been said
  about the loot from a South American church or cathedral, but there is really
  nothing known about the affair. There are no documents. It is mere oral
  tradition and very vague and sketchy. The story goes that when they had sold
  off the ship, they came down to live at Shawstead in Hertfordshire, Silas
  occupying the manor house&mdash;in which I live at present&mdash;and Reuben a
  farm adjoining. The bulk of the loot they shared out at the end of the
  cruise, but the jewels were kept apart to be dealt with later&mdash;perhaps
  when the circumstances under which they had been acquired had been forgotten.
  However, both men were inveterate gamblers and it seems&mdash;according to
  the testimony of a servant of Reuben's who overheard them&mdash;that on a
  certain night when they had been playing heavily, they decided to finish up
  by playing for the whole collection of jewels as a single stake. Silas, who
  had the jewels in his custody, was seen to go to the manor house and return
  to Reuben's house carrying a small, iron chest.</p>

  <p>"Apparently they played late into the night, after everyone else but the
  servant had gone to bed, and the luck was with Reuben, though it seems
  probable that he gave luck some assistance. At any rate, when the play was
  finished and the chest handed over, Silas roundly accused him of cheating,
  and we may assume that a pretty serious quarrel took place. Exactly what
  happened is not clear, for when the quarrel began Reuben dismissed the
  servant, who retired to her bedroom in a distant part of the house. But in
  the morning it was discovered that Reuben and the chest of jewels had both
  disappeared, and there were distinct traces of blood in the room in which the
  two men had been playing. Silas professed to know nothing about the
  disappearance; but a strong&mdash;and probably just&mdash;suspicion arose
  that he had murdered his brother and made away with the jewels. The result
  was that Silas also disappeared, and for a long time his whereabouts was not
  known even by his wife.</p>

  <p>"Later it transpired that he had taken up his abode under an assumed name,
  in Egypt, and that he had developed an enthusiastic interest in the then new
  science of Egyptology&mdash;the Rosetta Stone had been deciphered only a few
  years previously. After a time he resumed communication with his wife, but
  never made any statement as to the mystery of his brother's disappearance. A
  few months before his death he visited his home in disguise and he then
  handed to his wife a little sealed packet which was to be delivered to his
  only son, William, on his attaining the age of twenty-one. That packet
  contained the scarab and the letter which you have taken from the
  envelope."</p>

  <p>"Am I to read it?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if you think it worth while," was the reply. Thorndyke opened
  the yellow sheet of paper and, glancing through the brown and faded writing,
  read aloud:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Cairo, 4 March, 1833.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Dear Son</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter">I am sending you, as my last gift, a valuable scarab and a
  few words of counsel on which I would bid you meditate. Believe me, there is
  much wisdom in the lore of Old Egypt. Make it your own. Treasure the scarab
  as a precious inheritance. Handle it often but show it to none. Give your
  Uncle Reuben Christian burial. It is your duty, and you will have your
  reward. He robbed your father, but he shall make restitution.</p>

  <p class="letter">Farewell!</p>

  <p class="letter">Your affectionate father,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Silas Blowgrave</span>.</p><br>

  <p>As Thorndyke laid down the letter he looked inquiringly at our client.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "here are some plain instructions. How have they been
  carried out?</p>

  <p>"They haven't been carried out at all," replied Mr. Blowgrave. "As to his
  son William, my grandfather, he was not disposed to meddle in the matter.
  This seemed to be a frank admission that Silas killed his brother and
  concealed the body, and William didn't choose to reopen the scandal. Besides,
  the instructions are not so very plain. It is all very well to say, 'Give
  your Uncle Reuben Christian burial,' but where the deuce is Uncle
  Reuben?"</p>

  <p>"It is plainly hinted," said Thorndyke, "that whoever gives the body
  Christian burial will stand to benefit, and the word 'restitution' seems to
  suggest a clue to the whereabouts of the jewels. Has no one thought it worth
  while to find out where the body is deposited?"</p>

  <p>"But how could they?" demanded Blowgrave. "He doesn't give the faintest
  clue. He talks as if his son knew where the body was. And then, you know,
  even supposing Silas did not take the jewels with him, there was the
  question, whose property were they? To begin with, they were pretty certainly
  stolen property, though no one knows where they came from. Then Reuben
  apparently got them from Silas by fraud, and Silas got them back by robbery
  and murder. If William had discovered them he would have had to give them up
  to Reuben's sons, and yet they weren't strictly Reuben's property. No one had
  an undeniable claim to them, even if they could have found them."</p>

  <p>"But that is not the case now," said Miss Blowgrave.</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Blowgrave, in answer to Thorndyke's look of inquiry. "The
  position is quite clear now. Reuben's grandson, my cousin Arthur, has died
  recently, and as he had no children, he has dispersed his property. The old
  farm-house and the bulk of his estate he has left to a nephew, but he made a
  small bequest to my daughter and named her as the residuary legatee. So that
  what ever rights Reuben had to the jewels are now vested in her, and on my
  death she will be Silas's heir, too. As a matter of fact," Mr. Blowgrave
  continued, "we were discussing this very question on the night of the
  robbery. I may as well tell you that my girl will be left pretty poorly off
  when I go, for there is a heavy mortgage on our property and mighty little
  capital. Uncle Reuben's jewels would have made the old home secure for her if
  we could have laid our hands on them. However, I mustn't take up your time
  with our domestic affairs."</p>

  <p>"Your domestic affairs are not entirely irrelevant," said Thorndyke. "But
  what is it that you want me to do in the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Blowgrave, "my house has been robbed and my premises set fire
  to. The police can apparently do nothing. They say there is no clue at all
  unless the robbery was committed by somebody in the house, which is absurd,
  seeing that the servants were all engaged in putting out the fire. But I want
  the robber traced punished, and I want to get the scarab back. It may be
  intrinsically valueless, as M. Fouquet said, but Silas's testamentary letter
  seems to indicate that it had some value. At any rate, it is an heirloom, and
  I am loath to lose it. It seems a presumptuous thing to ask you to
  investigate a trumpery robbery, but I should take it as a great kindness if
  you would look into the matter."</p>

  <p>"Cases of robbery pure and simple," replied Thorndyke, "are rather alien
  to my ordinary practice, but in this one there are certain curious features
  that seem to make an investigation worth while. Yes, Mr. Blowgrave, I will
  look into the case, and I have some hope that we may be able to lay our hands
  on the robber, in spite of the apparent absence of clues. I will ask you to
  leave both these letters for me to examine more minutely, and I shall
  probably want to make an inspection of the premises&mdash;perhaps
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Whenever you like," said Blowgrave. "I am delighted that you are willing
  to undertake the inquiry. I have heard so much about you from my friend
  Stalker, of the Griffin Life Assurance Company, for whom you have acted on
  several occasions."</p>

  <p>"Before you go," said Thorndyke, "there is one point that we must clear
  up. Who is there besides yourselves that knows of the existence of the scarab
  and this letter and the history attaching to them?"</p>

  <p>"I really can't say," replied Blowgrave. "No one has seen them but my
  cousin Arthur. I once showed them to him, and he may have talked about them
  in the family. I didn't treat the matter as a secret."</p>

  <p>When our visitors had gone we discussed the bearings of the case.</p>

  <p>"It is quite a romantic story," said I, "and the robbery has its points of
  interest, but I am rather inclined to agree with the police&mdash;there is
  mighty little to go on."</p>

  <p>"There would have been less," said Thorndyke, "if our sporting friend
  hadn't been so pleased with himself. That typewritten letter was a piece of
  gratuitous impudence. Our gentleman overrated his security and crowed too
  loud."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that there is much to be gleaned from the letter, all the
  same," said I.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear you say that, Jervis," he exclaimed, "because I was
  proposing to hand the letter over to you to examine and report on."</p>

  <p>"I was only referring to the superficial appearances," I said hastily. "No
  doubt a detailed examination will bring something more distinctive into
  view."</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt it will," he said, "and as there are reasons for pushing
  on the investigation as quickly as possible, I suggest that you get to work
  at once. I will occupy myself with the old letter and the envelope."</p>

  <p>On this I began my examination without delay, and as a preliminary I
  proceeded to take a facsimile photograph of the letter by putting it in a
  large printing frame with a sensitive plate and a plate of clear glass. The
  resulting negative showed not only the typewritten lettering, but also the
  watermark and wire lines of the paper, and a faint grease spot. Next I turned
  my attention to the lettering itself, and here I soon began to accumulate
  quite a number of identifiable peculiarities. The machine was apparently a
  Corona, fitted with the small "Elite" type, and the alignment was markedly
  defective. The "lower case"&mdash;or small&mdash;"a" was well below the line,
  although the capital "A" appeared to be correctly placed; the "u" was
  slightly above the line, and the small "m" was partly clogged with dirt.</p>

  <p>Up to this point I had been careful to manipulate the letter with forceps
  (although it had been handled by at least three persons, to my knowledge),
  and I now proceeded to examine it for finger-prints. As I could detect none
  by mere inspection, I dusted the back of the paper with finely powdered
  fuchsin, and distributed the powder by tapping the paper lightly. This
  brought into view quite a number of finger-prints, especially round the edges
  of the letter, and though most of them were very faint and shadowy, it was
  possible to make out the ridge pattern well enough for our purpose. Having
  blown off the excess of powder, I took the letter to the room where the large
  copying camera was set up, to photograph it before developing the
  finger-prints on the front. But here I found our laboratory assistant,
  Polton, in possession, with the sealed envelope fixed to the copying easel.
  "I shan't be a minute, sir," said he. "The doctor wants an enlarged
  photograph of this seal. I've got the plate in."</p>

  <p>I waited while he made his exposure and then proceeded to take the
  photograph of the letter, or rather of the finger-prints on the back of it.
  When I had developed the negative I powdered the front of the letter and
  brought out several more finger-prints&mdash;thumbs this time. They were a
  little difficult to see where they were imposed on the lettering, but, as the
  latter was bright blue and the fuchsin powder was red, this confusion
  disappeared in the photograph, in which the lettering was almost invisible
  while the finger-prints were more distinct than they had appeared to the eye.
  This completed my examination, and when I had verified the make of typewriter
  by reference to our album of specimens of typewriting, I left the negatives
  for Polton to dry and print and went down to the sitting-room to draw up my
  little report. I had just finished this and was speculating on what had
  become of Thorndyke, when I heard his quick step on the stair and a few
  moments later he entered with a roll of paper in his hand. This he unrolled
  on the table, fixing it open with one or two lead paper-weights, and I came
  round to inspect it, when I found it to be a sheet of the Ordnance map on the
  scale of twenty-five inches to the mile.</p>

  <p>"Here is the Blowgraves' place," said Thorndyke, "nearly in the middle of
  the sheet. This is his house&mdash;Shawstead Manor&mdash;and that will
  probably be the out-building that was on fire. I take it that the house
  marked Dingle Farm is the one that Uncle Reuben occupied."</p>

  <p>"Probably," I agreed. "But I don't see why you wanted this map if you are
  going down to the place itself to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"The advantage of a map," said Thorndyke, "is that you can see all over it
  at once and get the lie of the land well into your mind; and you can measure
  all distances accurately and quickly with a scale and a pair of dividers.
  When we go down to-morrow, we shall know our way about as well as Blowgrave
  himself."</p>

  <p>"And what use will that be?" I asked. "Where does the topography come into
  the case?</p>

  <p>"Well, Jervis," he replied, "there is the robber, for instance; he came
  from somewhere and he went somewhere. A study of the map may give us a hint
  as to his movements. But here comes Polton 'with the documents,' as poor Miss
  Flite would say. What have you got for us, Polton?"</p>

  <p>"They aren't quite dry, sir," said Polton, laying four large bromide
  prints on the table. "There's the enlargement of the seal&mdash;ten by eight,
  mounted&mdash;and three unmounted prints of Dr. Jervis's."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at my photographs critically. "They're excellent,
  Jervis," said he. "The finger prints are perfectly legible, though faint. I
  only hope some of them are the right ones. That is my left thumb. I don't see
  yours. The small one is presumably Miss Blowgrave's. We must take her
  finger-prints to-morrow, and her father's, too. Then we shall know if we have
  got any of the robber's." He ran his eye over my report and nodded
  approvingly. "There is plenty there to enable us to identify the typewriter
  if we can get hold of it, and the paper is very distinctive. What do you
  think of the seal?" he added, laying the enlarged photograph before me.</p>

  <p>"It is magnificent," I replied, with a grin. "Perfectly monumental."</p>

  <p>"What are you grinning at?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking that you seem to be counting your chickens in pretty good
  time," said I. "You are making elaborate preparations to identify the scarab,
  but you are rather disregarding the classical advice of the prudent Mrs.
  Glasse."</p>

  <p>"I have a presentiment that we shall get that scarab," said he. "At any
  rate we ought to be in a position to identify it instantly and certainly if
  we are able to get a sight of it."</p>

  <p>"We are not likely to," said I. "Still, there is no harm in providing for
  the improbable."</p>

  <p>This was evidently Thorndyke's view, and he certainly made ample provision
  for this most improbable contingency; for, having furnished himself with a
  drawing-board and a sheet of tracing-paper, he pinned the latter over the
  photograph on the board and proceeded, with a fine pen and hectograph ink, to
  make a careful and minute tracing of the intricate and bewildering
  hieroglyphic inscription on the seal. When he had finished it he transferred
  it to a clay duplicator and took off half-a-dozen copies, one of which he
  handed to me. I looked at it dubiously and remarked: "You have said that the
  medical jurist must make all knowledge his province. Has he got to be an
  Egyptologist, too?"</p>

  <p>"He will be the better medical jurist if he is," was the reply, of which I
  made a mental note for my future guidance. But meanwhile Thorndyke's
  proceedings were, to me, perfectly incomprehensible. What was his object in
  making this minute tracing? The seal itself was sufficient for
  identification. I lingered, awhile hoping that some fresh development might
  throw a light on the mystery. But his next proceeding was like to have
  reduced me to stupefaction. I saw him go to the book-shelves and take down a
  book. As he laid it on the table I glanced at the title, and when I saw that
  it was Raper's Navigation Tables I stole softly out into the lobby, put on my
  hat and went for a walk.</p>

  <p>When I returned the investigation was apparently concluded, for Thorndyke
  was seated in his easy chair, placidly reading The Compleat Angler. On the
  table lay a large circular protractor, a straight-edge, an architect's scale
  and a sheet of tracing-paper on which was a tracing in hectograph ink of
  Shawstead Manor.</p>

  <p>"Why did you make this tracing?" I asked. "Why not take the map
  itself?"</p>

  <p>"We don't want the whole of it," he replied, "and I dislike cutting up
  maps."</p>

  <p>By taking an informal lunch in the train, we arrived at Shawstead Manor by
  half-past two. Our approach up the drive had evidently been observed, for
  Blowgrave and his daughter were waiting at the porch to receive us. The
  former came forward with outstretched hand, but a distinctly woebegone
  expression, and exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"It is most kind of you to come down; but alas! you are too late."</p>

  <p>"Too late for what?" demanded Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I will show you," replied Blowgrave, and seizing my colleague by the arm,
  he strode off excitedly to a little wicket at the side of the house, and,
  passing through it, hurried along a narrow alley that skirted the garden wall
  and ended in a large meadow, at one end of which stood a dilapidated
  windmill. Across this meadow he bustled, dragging my colleague with him,
  until he reached a heap of freshly-turned earth, where he halted and pointed
  tragically to a spot where the turf had evidently been raised and untidily
  replaced.</p>

  <p>"There!" he exclaimed, stooping to pull up the loose turfs and thereby
  exposing what was evidently a large hole, recently and hastily filled in.
  "That was done last night or early this morning, for I walked over this
  meadow only yesterday evening and there was no sign of disturbed ground
  then."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke stood looking down at the hole with a faint smile. "And what do
  you infer from that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Infer!" shrieked Blowgrave. "Why, I infer that whoever dug this hole was
  searching for Uncle Reuben and the lost jewels!"</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to agree with you," Thorndyke said calmly. "He happened to
  search in the wrong place, but that is his affair."</p>

  <p>"The wrong place!" Blowgrave and his daughter exclaimed in unison. "How do
  you know it is the wrong place?"</p>

  <p>"Because," replied Thorndyke, "I believe I know the right place, and this
  is not it. But we can put the matter to the test, and we had better do so.
  Can you get a couple of men with picks and shovels? Or shall we handle the
  tools ourselves?"</p>

  <p>"I think that would be better," said Blowgrave, who was quivering with
  excitement. "We don't want to take anyone into our confidence if we can help
  it."</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke agreed. "Then I suggest that you fetch the tools while I
  locate the spot."</p>

  <p>Blowgrave assented eagerly and went off at a brisk trot, while the young
  lady remained with us and watched Thorndyke with intense curiosity.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't interrupt you with questions," said she "but I can't imagine
  how you found out where Uncle Reuben was buried."</p>

  <p>"We will go into that later," he replied; "but first we have got to find
  Uncle Reuben." He laid his research case down on the ground, and opening it,
  took out three sheets of paper, each bearing a duplicate of his tracing of
  the map; and on each was marked a spot on this meadow from which a number of
  lines radiated like the spokes of a wheel.</p>

  <p>"You see, Jervis," he said, exhibiting them to me, "the advantage of a
  map. I have been able to rule off these sets of bearings regardless of
  obstructions, such as those young trees, which have arisen since Silas's day,
  and mark the spot in its correct place. If the recent obstructions prevent us
  from taking the bearings, we can still find the spot by measurements with the
  land-chain or tape."</p>

  <p>"Why have you got three plans?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Because there are three imaginable places. No. 1 is the most likely; No.
  2 less likely, but possible; No. 3 is impossible. That is the one that our
  friend tried last night. No. 1 is among those young trees, and we will now
  see if we can pick up the bearings in spite of them."</p>

  <p>We moved on to the clump of young trees, where Thorndyke took from the
  research-case a tall, folding camera-tripod and a large prismatic compass
  with an aluminium dial. With the latter he one or two trial bearings and
  then, setting up the tripod, fixed the compass on it. For some minutes Miss
  Blowgrave and I watched him as he shifted the tripod from spot to spot,
  peering through the sight-vane of the compass and glancing occasionally at
  the map. At length he turned to us and said: "We are in luck. None of these
  trees interferes with our bearings." He took from the research-case a
  surveyor's arrow, and sticking it in the ground under the tripod, added:
  "That is the spot. But we may have to dig a good way round it, for a compass
  is only a rough instrument."</p>

  <p>At this moment Mr. Blowgrave staggered up, breathing hard, and flung down
  on the ground three picks, two shovels and a spade. "I won't hinder you,
  doctor, by asking for explanations," said he, "but I am utterly mystified.
  You must tell us what it all means when we have finished our work."</p>

  <p>This Thorndyke promised to do, but meanwhile he took off his coat, and
  rolling up his shirt sleeves, seized the spade and began cutting out a large
  square of turf. As the soil was uncovered, Blowgrave and I attacked it with
  picks and Miss Blowgrave shovelled away the loose earth.</p>

  <p>"Do you know how far down we have to go?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The body lies six feet below the surface," Thorndyke replied; and as he
  spoke he laid down his spade, and taking a telescope from the research-case,
  swept it round the margin of the meadow and finally pointed it at a farm
  house some six hundred yards distant, of which he made a somewhat prolonged
  inspection, after which he took the remaining pick and fell to work on the
  opposite corner of the exposed square of earth.</p>

  <p>For nearly half-an-hour we worked on steadily, gradually eating our way
  downwards, plying pick and shovel alternately, while Miss Blowgrave cleared
  the loose earth away from the edges of the deepening pit. Then a halt was
  called and we came to the surface, wiping our faces.</p>

  <p>"I think, Nellie," said Blowgrave, divesting himself of his waistcoat, "a
  jug of lemonade and four tumblers would be useful, unless our visitors would
  prefer beer."</p>

  <p>We both gave our votes for lemonade, and Miss Nellie tripped away towards
  the house, while Thorndyke, taking up his telescope, once more inspected the
  farm house.</p>

  <p>"You seem greatly interested in that house," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"I am," he replied, handing me the telescope. "Just take a look at the
  window in the right-hand gable, but keep under the tree."</p>

  <p>I pointed the telescope at the gable and there observed an open window at
  which a man was seated. He held a binocular glass to his eyes and the
  instrument appeared to be directed at us.</p>

  <p>"We are being spied on, I fancy," said I, passing the telescope to
  Blowgrave, "but I suppose it doesn't matter. This is your land, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Blowgrave, "but still, we didn't want any spectators. That
  is Harold Bowker," he added steadying the telescope against a tree, "my
  cousin Arthur's nephew, whom I told you about as having inherited the
  farm-house. He seems mighty interested in us; but small things interest one
  in the country."</p>

  <p>Here the appearance of Miss Nellie, advancing across the meadow with an
  inviting-looking basket, diverted our attention from our inquisitive watcher.
  Six thirsty eyes were riveted on that basket until it drew near and presently
  disgorged a great glass jug and four tumblers, when we each took off a long
  and delicious draught and then jumped down into the pit to resume our
  labours.</p>

  <p>Another half-hour passed. We had excavated in some places to nearly the
  full depth and were just discussing the advisability of another short rest
  when Blowgrave, who was working in one corner, uttered a loud cry and stood
  up suddenly, holding something in his fingers. A glance at the object showed
  it to be a bone, brown and earth-stained, but evidently a bone. Evidently,
  too, a human bone, as Thorndyke decided when Blowgrave handed it to him
  triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"We have been very fortunate," said he, "to get so near at the first
  trial. This is from the right great toe, so we may assume that the skeleton
  lies just outside this pit, but we had better excavate carefully in your
  corner and see exactly how the bones lie." This he proceeded to do himself,
  probing cautiously with the spade and clearing the earth away from the
  corner. Very soon the remaining bones of the right foot came into view and
  then the ends of the two leg-bones and a portion of the left foot.</p>

  <p>"We can see now," said he, "how the skeleton lies, and all we have to do
  is to extend the excavation in that direction. But there is only room for one
  to work down here. I think you and Mr. Blowgrave had better dig down from the
  surface."</p>

  <p>On this, I climbed out of the pit, followed reluctantly by Blowgrave, who
  still held the little brown bone in his hand and was in a state of wild
  excitement and exultation that somewhat scandalised his daughter.</p>

  <p>"It seems rather ghoulish," she remarked, "to be gloating over poor Uncle
  Reuben's body in this way."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Blowgrave, "it isn't reverent. But I didn't kill Uncle
  Reuben, you know, whereas&mdash;well it was a long time ago." With this
  rather inconsequent conclusion he took a draught of lemonade, seized his pick
  and fell to work with a will. I, too, indulged in a draught and passed a full
  tumbler down to Thorndyke. But before resuming my labours I picked up the
  telescope and once more inspected the farm-house. The window was still open,
  but the watcher had apparently become bored with the not very thrilling
  spectacle. At any rate he had disappeared.</p>

  <p>From this time onward every few minutes brought some discovery. First, a
  pair of deeply rusted steel shoe buckles; then one or two buttons, and
  presently a fine gold watch with a fob-chain and a bunch of seals, looking
  uncannily new and fresh and seeming more fraught with tragedy than even the
  bones themselves. In his cautious digging, Thorndyke was careful not to
  disturb the skeleton; and looking down into the narrow trench that was
  growing from the corner of the pit, I could see both legs, with only the
  right foot missing, projecting from the miniature cliff. Meanwhile our of the
  trench was deepening rapidly, so that Thorndyke presently warned us to stop
  digging and bade us come down and shovel away the earth as he disengaged
  it.</p>

  <p>At length the whole skeleton, excepting the head, was uncovered, though it
  lay undisturbed as it might have lain in its coffin. And now, as Thorndyke
  picked away the earth around the head, we could see that the skull was
  propped forward as if it rested on a high pillow. A little more careful
  probing with the pick-point served to explain this appearance. For as the
  earth fell away and disclosed the grinning skull, there came into view the
  edge and ironbound corners of a small chest.</p>

  <p>It was an impressive spectacle; weird, solemn and rather dreadful. There
  for over a century the ill-fated gambler had lain, his mouldering head
  pillowed on the booty of unrecorded villainy, booty that had been won by
  fraud, retrieved by violence, and hidden at last by the final winner with the
  witness of his crime.</p>

  <p>"Here is a fine text for a moralist who would preach on the vanity of
  riches," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>We all stood silent for a while, gazing, not without awe, at the stark
  figure that lay guarding the ill-gotten treasure. Miss Blowgrave&mdash;who
  had been helped down when we descended&mdash;crept closer to her father and
  murmured that it was "rather awful;" while Blowgrave himself displayed a
  queer mixture of exultation and shuddering distaste.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the silence was broken by a voice from above, and we all looked
  up with a start. A youngish man was standing on the brink of the pit, looking
  down on us with very evident disapproval.</p>

  <p>"It seems that I have come just in the nick of time," observed the
  new-comer. "I shall have to take possession of that chest, you know, and of
  the remains, too, I suppose. That is my ancestor, Reuben Blowgrave."</p>

  <p>"Well, Harold," said Blowgrave, "you can have Uncle Reuben if you want
  him. But the chest belongs to Nellie."</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Harold Bowker&mdash;I recognised him now as the watcher from the
  window&mdash;dropped down into the pit and advanced with something of a
  swagger.</p>

  <p>"I am Reuben's heir," said he, "through my Uncle Arthur, and I take
  possession of this property and the remains."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, Harold," said Blowgrave, "but Nellie is Arthur's residuary
  legatee, and this is the residue of the estate."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" exclaimed Bowker. "By the way, how did you find out where he
  was buried?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that was quite simple," replied Thorndyke with unexpected geniality.
  "I'll show you the plan." He climbed up to the surface and returned in a few
  moments with the three tracings and his letter-case. "This is how we located
  the spot." He handed the plan numbered 3 to Bowker, who took it from him and
  stood looking at it with a puzzled frown.</p>

  <p>"But this isn't the place," he said at length.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it?" queried Thorndyke. "No, of course; I've given you the wrong
  one. This is the plan." He handed Bowker the plan marked No. 1, and took the
  other from him, laying it down on a heap of earth. Then, as Bowker pored
  gloomily over No. 1, he took a knife and a pencil from his pocket, and with
  his back to our visitor; scraped the lead of the pencil, letting the black
  powder fall on the plan that he had just laid down. I watched him with some
  curiosity; and when I observed that the black scrapings fell on two spots
  near the edges of the paper, a sudden suspicion flashed into my mind, which
  was confirmed when I saw him tap the paper lightly with his pencil, gently
  blow away the powder, and quickly producing my photograph of the typewritten
  letter from his case, hold it for a moment beside the plan.</p>

  <p>"This is all very well," said Bowker, looking up from the plan, "but how
  did you find out about these bearings?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke swiftly replaced the letter in his case, and turning round,
  replied, "I am afraid I can't give you any further information."</p>

  <p>"Can't you, indeed!" Bowker exclaimed insolently. "Perhaps I shall compel
  you to. But, at any rate, I forbid any of you to lay hands on my
  property."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at him steadily and said in an ominously quiet tone:
  "Now, listen to me, Mr. Bowker. Let us have an end of this nonsense. You have
  played a risky game and you have lost. How much you have lost I can't say
  until I know whether Mr. Blowgrave intends to prosecute."</p>

  <p>"To prosecute!" shouted Bowker. "What the deuce do you mean by
  prosecute?"</p>

  <p>"I mean," said Thorndyke, "that on the 7th of June, after nine o'clock at
  night, you entered the dwelling-house of Mr. Blowgrave and stole and carried
  away certain of his goods and chattels. A part of them you have restored, but
  you are still in possession of some of the stolen property, to wit, a scarab
  and a deed-box."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke made this statement in his calm, level tones, Bowker's face
  blanched to a tallowy white, and he stood staring at my colleague, the very
  picture of astonishment and dismay. But he fired a last shot.</p>

  <p>"This is sheer midsummer madness," he exclaimed huskily; "and you know
  it."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke turned to our host. "It is for you to settle, Mr. Blowgrave,"
  said he. "I hold conclusive evidence that Mr. Bowker stole your deed-box. If
  you decide to prosecute I shall produce that evidence in court and he will
  certainly be convicted."</p>

  <p>Blowgrave and his daughter looked at the accused man with an embarrassment
  almost equal to his own.</p>

  <p>"I am astounded," the former said at length; "but I don't want to be
  vindictive. Look here, Harold, hand over the scarab and we'll say no more
  about it."</p>

  <p>"You can't do that," said Thorndyke. "The law doesn't allow you to
  compound a robbery. He can return the property if he pleases and you can do
  as you think best about prosecuting. But you can't make conditions."</p>

  <p>There was silence for some seconds; then, without another word, the
  crestfallen adventurer turned, and scrambling up out of the pit, took a hasty
  departure.</p>

  <p>It was nearly a couple of hours later that, after a leisurely wash and a
  hasty, nondescript meal, we carried the little chest from the dining-room to
  the study. Here, when he had closed the French window and drawn the curtains,
  Mr. Blowgrave produced a set of tools and we fell to work on the iron
  fastenings of the chest. It was no light task, though a century's rust had
  thinned the stout bands, but at length the lid yielded to the thrust of a
  long case-opener and rose with a protesting creak. The chest was lined with a
  double thickness of canvas, apparently part of a sail, and contained a number
  of small leathern bags, which, as we lifted them out, one by one, felt as if
  they were filled with pebbles. But when we untied the thongs of one and
  emptied its contents into a wooden bowl, Blowgrave heaved a sigh of ecstasy
  and Miss Nellie uttered a little scream of delight. They were all cut stones,
  and most of them of exceptional size; rubies, emeralds, sapphires and a few
  diamonds. As to their value, we could forn but the vaguest guess; but
  Thorndyke, who was a fair judge of gem-stones, gave it as his opinion that
  they were fine specimens of their kind, though roughly cut, and that they had
  probably formed the enrichment of some shrine.</p>

  <p>"The question is," said Blowgrave, gazing gloatingly on the bowl of
  sparkling gems, "what are we to do with them?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest," said Thorndyke, "that Dr. Jervis stay here to-night to help
  you to guard them and that in the morning you take them up to London and
  deposit them, at your bank."</p>

  <p>Blowgrave fell in eagerly with this suggestion, which I seconded. "But,"
  said he, "that chest is a queer-looking package to be carrying abroad. Now,
  if we only had that confounded deed-box&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's a deed-box on the cabinet behind you," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>Blowgrave turned round sharply. "God bless us!" he exclaimed. "It has come
  back the way it went. Harold must have slipped in at the window while we were
  at tea. Well, I'm glad he has made restitution. When I look at that bowl and
  think what he must have narrowly missed, I don't feel inclined to be hard on
  him. I suppose the scarab is inside&mdash;not that it matters much now."</p>

  <p>The scarab was inside in an envelope; and as Thorndyke turned it over in
  his hand and examined the hieroglyphics on it through his lens, Miss
  Blowgrave asked: "Is it of any value, Dr. Thorndyke? It can't have any
  connection with the secret of the hiding-place, because you found the jewels
  without it."</p>

  <p>"By the way, doctor, I don't know whether it is permissible for me to ask,
  but how on earth did you find out where the jewels were hidden? To me it
  looks like black magic."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed in a quiet, inward fashion. "There is nothing magical
  about it," said he. "It was a perfectly simple, straightforward problem. But
  Miss Nellie is wrong. We had the scarab; that is to say we had the wax
  impression of it, which is the same thing. And the scarab was the key to the
  riddle. You see," he continued, "Silas's letter and the scarab formed
  together a sort of intelligence test."</p>

  <p>"Did they?" said Blowgrave. "Then he drew a blank every time."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled. "His descendants were certainly a little lacking in
  enterprise," he admitted. "Silas's instructions were perfectly plain and
  explicit. Whoever would find the treasure must first acquire some knowledge
  of Egyptian lore and must study the scarab attentively. It was the broadest
  of hints, but no one&mdash;excepting Harold Bowker, who must have heard about
  the scarab from his Uncle Arthur&mdash;seems to have paid any attention to
  it.</p>

  <p>"Now it happens that I have just enough elementary knowledge of the
  hieroglyphic characters to enable me to spell them out when they are used
  alphabetically; and as soon as I saw the seal, I could see that these
  hieroglyphics formed English words. My attention was first attracted by the
  second group of signs, which spelled the word 'Reuben,' and then I saw that
  the first group spelled 'Uncle.' Of course, the instant I heard Miss Nellie
  speak of the connection between the scarab and Uncle Reuben, the murder was
  out. I saw at a glance that the scarab contained all the required
  information. Last night I made a careful tracing of the hieroglyphics and
  then rendered them into our own alphabet. This is the result."</p><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>He took from his letter-case and spread out on the table a duplicate of
  the tracing which I had seen him make, and of which he had given me a copy.
  But since I had last seen it, it had received an addition; under each group
  of signs the equivalents in modern Roman lettering had been written, and
  these made the following words:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"><span class="smcap">"unkl rubn is in th mill field sks ft
  down church spir north ten thirty east dingl south gabl north aty forty fif
  west god saf king jorj."</span></p><br>

  <p>Our two friends gazed at Thorndyke's transliteration in blank
  astonishment. At length Blowgrave remarked: "But this translation must have
  demanded a very profound knowledge of the Egyptian writing."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied Thorndyke. "Any intelligent person could master the
  Egyptian alphabet in an hour. The language, of course, is quite another
  matter. The spelling of this is a little crude, but it is quite intelligible
  and does Silas great credit, considering how little was known in his
  time."</p>

  <p>"How do you suppose M. Fouquet came to overlook this?" Blowgrave
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Naturally enough," was the reply. "He was looking for an Egyptian
  inscription. But this is not an Egyptian inscription. Does he speak
  English?"</p>

  <p>"Very little. Practically not at all."</p>

  <p>"Then, as the words are English words and imperfectly spelt, the
  hieroglyphics must have appeared to him mere nonsense. And he was right as to
  the scarab being an imitation."</p>

  <p>"There is another point," said Blowgrave. "How was it that Harold made
  that extraordinary mistake about the place? The directions are clear enough.
  All you had to do was to go out there with a compass and take the bearings
  just as they were given."</p>

  <p>"But," said Thorndyke, "that is exactly what he did, and hence the
  mistake. He was apparently unaware of the phenomenon known as the Secular
  Variation of the Compass. As you know, the compass does
  not&mdash;usually&mdash;point to true north, but to the Magnetic North; and
  the Magnetic North is continually changing its position. When Reuben was
  buried&mdash;-about 1810&mdash;it was twenty-four degrees, twenty-six minutes
  west of true north; at the present time it is fourteen degrees, forty-eight
  minutes west of true north. So Harold's bearings would be no less than ten
  degrees out, which of course, gave him a totally wrong position. But Silas
  was a ship-master, a navigator, and of course knew all about the vagaries of
  the compass; and, as his directions were intended for use at some date
  unknown to him, I assumed that the bearings that he gave were true
  bearings&mdash;that when he said 'north' he meant true north, which is always
  the same; and this turned out to be the case. But I also prepared a plan with
  magnetic bearings corrected up to date. Here are the three plans: No.
  1&mdash;the one we used&mdash;showing true bearings; No. 2, showing corrected
  magnetic bearings which might have given us the correct spot; and No. 3, with
  uncorrected magnetic bearings, giving us the spot where Harold dug, and which
  could not possibly have been the right spot."</p>

  <p>On the following morning I escorted the deed-box, filled with the booty
  and tied up and sealed with the scarab, to Mr. Blowgrave's bank. And that
  ended our connection with the case; excepting that, a month or two later, we
  attended by request the unveiling in Shawstead churchyard of a fine monument
  to Reuben Blowgrave. This took the slightly inappropriate form of an obelisk,
  on which were cut the name and approximate dates, with the added inscription:
  "Cast thy bread upon the waters and it shall return after many days;"
  concerning which Thorndyke remarked dryly that he supposed the exhortation
  applied equally even if the bread happened to belong to someone else.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="c3"
     id="c3"></a>III. &mdash; THE NEW JERSEY SPHINX</h2>

  <p>"A rather curious neighbourhood this, Jervis," my friend Thorndyke
  remarked as we turned into Upper Bedford Place; "a sort of aviary for
  cosmopolitan birds of passage, especially those of the Oriental variety. The
  Asiatic and African faces that one sees at the windows of these Bloomsbury
  boarding houses almost suggest an overflow from the ethnographical galleries
  of the adjacent British Museum."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "there must be quite a considerable population of
  Africans, Japanese and Hindus in Bloomsbury; particularly Hindus."</p>

  <p>As I spoke, and as if in illustration of my statement, a dark-skinned man
  rushed out of one of the houses farther down the street and began to advance
  towards us in a rapid, bewildered fashion, stopping to look at each street
  door as he came to it. His hatless condition&mdash;though he was exceedingly
  well dressed&mdash;and his agitated manner immediately attracted my
  attention, and Thorndyke's too, for the latter remarked, "Our friend seems to
  be in trouble. An accident, perhaps, or a case of sudden illness."</p>

  <p>Here the stranger, observing our approach, ran forward to meet us and
  asked in an agitated tone, "Can you tell me, please, where I can find a
  doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I am a medical man," replied Thorndyke, "and so is my friend."</p>

  <p>Our acquaintance grasped Thorndyke's sleeve and exclaimed eagerly, "Come
  with me, then, quickly, if you please. A most dreadful thing has
  happened."</p>

  <p>He hurried us along at something between a trot and a quick walk, and as
  we proceeded he continued excitedly, "I am quite confused and terrified; it
  is all so strange and sudden and terrible."</p>

  <p>"Try," said Thorndyke, "to calm yourself a little and tell us what has
  happened."</p>

  <p>"I will," was the agitated reply. "It is my cousin, Dinanath
  Byramji&mdash;his surname is the same as mine. Just now I went to his room
  and was horrified to find him lying on the floor, staring at the ceiling and
  blowing&mdash;like this," and he puffed out his cheeks with a soft blowing
  noise. "I spoke to him and shook his hand, but he was like a dead man. This
  is the house."</p>

  <p>He darted up the steps to an open door at which a rather scared page-boy
  was on guard, and running along the hall, rapidly ascended the stairs.
  Following him closely, we reached a rather dark first-floor landing where, at
  a half-open door, a servant-maid stood listening with an expression of awe to
  a rhythmical snoring sound that issued from the room.</p>

  <p>The unconscious man lay as Mr. Byramji had said staring fixedly at the
  ceiling with wide-open, glazy eyes, puffing out his cheeks slightly at each
  breath. But the breathing was shallow and slow, and it grew perceptibly
  slower, with lengthening pauses. And even as I was timing it with my watch
  while Thorndyke examined the pupils with the aid of a wax match, it stopped.
  I laid my finger on the wrist and caught one or two slow, flickering beats.
  Then the pulse stopped too.</p>

  <p>"He is gone," said I. "He must have burst one of the large arteries."</p>

  <p>"Apparently," said Thorndyke, "though one would not have expected it at
  his age. But wait! What is this?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to the right ear, in the hollow of which a few drops of blood
  had collected, and as he spoke he drew his hand gently over the dead man's
  head and moved it slightly from side to side.</p>

  <p>"There is a fracture of the base of the skull," said he, "and quite
  distinct signs of contusion of the scalp." He turned to Mr. Byramji, who
  stood wringing his hand and gazing incredulously at the dead man, and asked:
  "Can you throw any light on this?"</p>

  <p>The Indian looked at him vacantly. The sudden tragedy seemed to have
  paralysed his brain. "I don't understand," said he. "What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means," replied Thorndyke, "that he has received a heavy blow on the
  head."</p>

  <p>For a few moments Mr. Byramji continued to stare vacantly at my colleague.
  Then he seemed suddenly to realise the import of Thorndyke's remark, for he
  started up excitedly and turned to the door, outside which the two servants
  were hovering.</p>

  <p>"Where is the person gone who came in with my cousin?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"You saw him go out, Albert," said the maid. "Tell Mr. Byramji where he
  went to."</p>

  <p>The page tiptoed into the room with a fearful eye fixed on the corpse, and
  replied falteringly, "I only see the back of him as he went out, and all I
  know is that he turned to the left. P'raps he's gone for a doctor."</p>

  <p>"Can you give us any description of him?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I only see the back of him," repeated the page. "He was a shortish
  gentleman and he had on a dark suit of clothes and a hard felt hat. That's
  all I know."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Thorndyke. "We may want to ask you some more questions
  presently," and having conducted the page to the door, he shut it and turned
  to Mr. Byramji.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea who it was that was with your cousin?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"None at all," was the reply. "I was sitting in my room opposite, writing,
  when I heard my cousin come up the stairs with another person, to whom he was
  talking. I could not hear what he was saying. They went into his
  room&mdash;this room&mdash;and I could occasionally catch the sound of their
  voices. In about a quarter of an hour I heard the door open and shut, and
  then someone went downstairs, softly and rather quickly. I finished the
  letter that I was writing, and when I had addressed it I came in here to ask
  my cousin who the visitor was. I thought it might be someone who had come to
  negotiate for the ruby."</p>

  <p>"The ruby!" exclaimed Thorndyke. "What ruby do you refer to?"</p>

  <p>"The great ruby," replied Byramji. "But of course you have not&mdash;" He
  broke off suddenly and stood for a few moments staring at Thorndyke with
  parted lips and wide-open eyes; then abruptly he turned, and kneeling beside
  the dead man he began, in a curious, caressing, half-apologetic manner, first
  to pass his hands gently over the body at the waist and then to unfasten the
  clothes. This brought into view a handsome, soft leather belt, evidently of
  native workmanship, worn next to the skin and furnished with three pockets.
  Mr. Byramji unbuttoned and explored them in quick succession, and it was
  evident that they were all empty.</p>

  <p>"It is gone!" he exclaimed in low, intense tones, "Gone! Ah! But how
  little would it signify! But thou, dear Dinanath, my brother, my friend, thou
  art gone, too!"</p>

  <p>He lifted the dead man's hand and pressed it to his cheek, murmuring
  endearments in his own tongue. Presently he laid it down reverently, and
  sprang up, and I was startled at the change in his aspect. The delicate,
  gentle, refined face had suddenly become the face of a Fury&mdash;fierce,
  sinister, vindictive.</p>

  <p>"This wretch must die!" he exclaimed huskily. "This sordid brute who,
  without compunction, has crushed out a precious life as one would carelessly
  crush a fly, for the sake of a paltry crystal&mdash;he must die, if I have to
  follow him and strangle him with my own hands!"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laid his hand on Byramji's shoulder. "I sympathise with you most
  cordially," said he. "If it is as you think, and appearances suggest, that
  your cousin has been murdered as a mere incident of robbery, the murderer's
  life is forfeit, and Justice cries aloud for retribution. The fact of murder
  will be determined, for or against, by a proper inquiry. Meanwhile we have to
  ascertain who this unknown man is and what happened while he was with your
  cousin."</p>

  <p>Byramji made a gesture of despair. "But the man has disappeared, and
  nobody has seen him! What can we do?"</p>

  <p>"Let us look around us," plied Thorndyke, "and see if we can judge what
  has happened in this room. What, for instance, is this?"</p>

  <p>He picked up from a corner near the door a small leather object, which he
  handed to Mr. Byramji. The Indian seized it eagerly, exclaiming: "Ah! It is
  the little bag in which my cousin used to carry the ruby. So he had taken it
  from his belt."</p>

  <p>"It hasn't been dropped, by any chance?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>In an instant Mr. Byramji was down on his knees, peering and groping about
  the floor, and Thorndyke and I joined in the search. But, as might have been
  expected there was no sign of the ruby, nor, indeed, of anything else,
  excepting a hat which I picked up from under the table.</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Byramji, rising with a dejected air. "It is gone&mdash;of
  course it is gone, and the murderous villain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here his glance fell on the hat, which I had laid on the table, and he
  bent forward to look at it.</p>

  <p>"Whose hat is this?" he demanded, glancing at the chair on which
  Thorndyke's hat and mine had been placed.</p>

  <p>"Is it not your cousin's?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No, certainly not. His hat was like mine&mdash;we bought them both
  together. It had a white silk lining with his initials, D. B., in gold. This
  has no lining and is a much older hat. It must be the murderer's hat."</p>

  <p>"If it is," said Thorndyke, "that is a most important fact&mdash;important
  in two respects. Could you let us see your hat?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied Byramji, walking quickly, but with a soft tread, to
  the door. As he went out, shutting the door silently behind him, Thorndyke
  picked up the derelict hat and swiftly tried it on the head of the dead man.
  As far as I could judge, it appeared to fit, and this Thorndyke confirmed as
  he replaced it on the table.</p>

  <p>"As you see," said he, "it is at least a practical fit, which is a fact of
  some significance."</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Byramji returned with his own hat, which he placed on the table
  by the side of the other, and thus placed, crown uppermost, the two hats were
  closely similar. Both were black, hard felts of the prevalent "bowler" shape,
  and of good quality, and the difference in their age and state of
  preservation was not striking; but when Byramji turned them over and
  exhibited their interiors it was seen that whereas the strange hat was
  unlined save for the leather head-band, Byramji's had a white silk lining and
  bore the owner's initials in embossed gilt letters.</p>

  <p>"What happened," said Thorndyke, when he had carefully compared the two
  hats, "seems fairly obvious. The two men, on entering, placed their hats
  crown upwards on the table. In some way&mdash;perhaps during a
  struggle&mdash;the visitor's hat was knocked down and rolled under the table.
  Then the stranger, on leaving, picked up the only visible hat&mdash;almost
  identically similar to his own&mdash;and put it on."</p>

  <p>"Is it not rather singular," I asked, "that he should not have noticed the
  different feel of a strange hat?"</p>

  <p>"I think not," Thorndyke replied. "If he noticed anything unusual he would
  probably assume that he had put it on the wrong way round. Remember that he
  would be extremely hurried and agitated. And when once he had left the house
  he would not dare to take the risk of returning, though he would doubtless
  realise the gravity of the mistake. And now," he continued, "would you mind
  giving us a few particulars? You have spoken of a great ruby, which your
  cousin had, and which seems to be missing."</p>

  <p>"Yes. You shall come to my room and I will tell you about it; but first
  let us lay my poor cousin decently on his bed."</p>

  <p>"I think," said Thorndyke, "the body ought not to be moved until the
  police have seen it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right," Byramji agreed reluctantly, "though it seems
  callous to leave him lying there." With a sigh he turned to the door, and
  Thorndyke followed, carrying the two hats.</p>

  <p>"My cousin and I," said our host, when we were seated in his own large
  bed-sitting-room, "were both interested in gem-stones. I deal in all kinds of
  stones that are found in the East, but Dinanath dealt almost exclusively in
  rubies. He was a very fine judge of those beautiful gems, and he used to make
  periodical tours in Burma in search of uncut rubies of unusual size or
  quality. About four months ago he acquired at Mogok, in Upper Burma, a
  magnificent specimen over twenty-eight carats in weight, perfectly flawless
  and of the most gorgeous colour. It had been roughly cut, but my cousin was
  intending to have it recut unless he should receive an advantageous offer for
  it in the meantime."</p>

  <p>"What would be the value of such a stone?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to say. A really fine large ruby of perfect colour is
  far, far more valuable than the finest diamond of the same size. It is the
  most precious of all gems, with the possible exception of the emerald. A fine
  ruby of five carats is worth about three thousand pounds, but of course, the
  value rises out of all proportion with increasing size. Fifty thousand pounds
  would be a moderate price for Dinanath's ruby."</p>

  <p>During this recital I noticed that Thorndyke, while listening attentively,
  was turning the stranger's hat over in his hands, narrowly scrutinising it
  both inside and outside. As Byramji concluded, he remarked:</p>

  <p>"We shall have to let the police know what has happened, but, as my friend
  and I will be called as witnesses, I should like to examine this hat a little
  more closely before you hand it over to them. Could you let me have a small,
  hard brush? A dry nail-brush would do." Our host complied readily&mdash;in
  fact eagerly. Thorndyke's authoritative, purposeful manner had clearly
  impressed him, for he said as he handed my colleague a new nail-brush: "I
  thank you for your help and value it. We must not depend on the police
  only."</p>

  <p>Accustomed as I was to Thorndyke's methods, his procedure was not
  unexpected, but Mr. Byramji watched him with breathless interest and no
  little surprise as, laying a sheet of notepaper on the table, he brought the
  hat close to it and brushed firmly but slowly, so that the dust dislodged
  should fall on it. As it was not a very well-kept hat, the yield was
  considerable, especially when the brush was drawn under the curl of the brim,
  and very soon the paper held quite a little heap. Then Thorndyke folded the
  paper into a small packet and having written "outside" on it, put it in his
  pocketbook.</p>

  <p>"Why do you do that?" Mr. Byramji asked. "What will the dust tell
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Probably nothing," Thorndyke replied. "But this hat is our only direct
  clue to the identity of the man who was with your cousin, and we must make
  the most of it. Dust, you know, is only a mass of fragments detached from
  surrounding objects. If the objects are unusual the dust may be quite
  distinctive. You could easily identify the hat of a miller or a cement
  worker." As he was speaking he reversed the hat and turned down the leather
  head-lining, whereupon a number of strips of folded paper fell down into the
  crown.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Byramji, "perhaps we shall learn something now."</p>

  <p>He picked out the folded slips and began eagerly to open them out, and we
  examined them systematically&mdash;one by one. But they were singularly
  disappointing and uninforming. Mostly they consisted of strips of newspaper,
  with one or two circulars, a leaf from a price list of gas stoves, a portion
  of a large envelope on which were the remains of an address which read
  "&mdash;n&mdash;don, W.C.," and a piece of paper evidently cut down
  vertically and bearing the right-hand half of some kind of list. This
  read:</p>

  <p>"&mdash;el 3 oz. 5 dwts.<br>
  &mdash;eep 9½ oz."</p>

  <p>"Can you make anything of this?" I asked, handing the paper to
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>He looked at it reflectively, and answered, as he copied it into his
  notebook: "It has, at least, some character. If we consider it with the other
  data we should get some sort of hint from it. But these scraps of paper don't
  tell us much. Perhaps their most suggestive feature is their quantity and the
  way in which, as you have no doubt noticed, they were arranged at the sides
  of the hat. We had better replace them as we found them for the benefit of
  the police."</p>

  <p>The nature of the suggestion to which he referred was not very obvious to
  me, but the presence of Mr. Byramji rendered discussion inadvisable; nor was
  there any opportunity, for we had hardly reconstituted the hat when we became
  aware of a number of persons ascending the stairs, and then we heard the
  sound of rather peremptory rapping at the door of the dead man's room.</p>

  <p>Mr. Byramji opened the door and went out on to the landing, where several
  persons had collected, including the two servants and a constable.</p>

  <p>"I understand," said the policeman, "that there is something wrong here.
  Is that so?"</p>

  <p>"A very terrible thing has happened," replied Byramji. "But the doctors
  can tell you better than I can." Here he looked appealingly at Thorndyke, and
  we both went out and joined him.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman&mdash;Mr. Dinanath Byramji&mdash;has met with his death under
  somewhat suspicious circumstances," said Thorndyke, and, glancing at the knot
  of naturally curious persons on the landing, he continued: "If you will come
  into the room where the death occurred, I will give you the facts so far as
  they are known to us."</p>

  <p>With this he opened the door and entered the room with Mr. Byramji, the
  constable, and me. As the door opened, the bystanders craned forward and a
  middle-aged woman uttered a cry of horror and followed us into the room.</p>

  <p>"This is dreadful!" she exclaimed, with a shuddering glance at the corpse.
  "The servants told me about it when I came in just now and I sent Albert for
  the police at once. But what does it mean? You don't think poor Mr. Dinanath
  has been murdered?"</p>

  <p>"We had better get the facts, ma'am," said the constable, drawing out a
  large black notebook and laying his helmet on the table. He turned to Mr.
  Byramji, who had sunk into a chair and sat, the picture of grief, gazing at
  his dead cousin. "Would you kindly tell me what you know about how it
  happened?"</p>

  <p>Byramji repeated the substance of what he had told us, and when the
  constable had taken down his statement, Thorndyke and I gave the few medical
  particulars that we could furnish and handed the constable our cards. Then,
  having helped to lay the corpse on the bed and cover it with a sheet, we
  turned to take our leave.</p>

  <p>"You have been very kind," Mr. Byramji said as he shook our hands warmly.
  "I am more than grateful. Perhaps I may be permitted to call on you and hear
  if&mdash;if you have learned anything fresh," he concluded discreetly.</p>

  <p>"We shall be pleased to see you," Thorndyke replied, "and to give you any
  help that we can;" and with this we took our departure, watched inquisitively
  down the stairs by the boarders and the servants who still lurked in the
  vicinity of the chamber of death.</p>

  <p>"If the police have no more information than we have," I remarked as we
  walked homeward, "they won't have much to go on."</p>

  <p>"No," said Thorndyke. "But you must remember that this crime&mdash;as we
  are justified in assuming it to be&mdash;is not an isolated one. It is the
  fourth of practically the same kind within the last six months. I understand
  that the police have some kind of information respecting the presumed
  criminal, though it can't be worth much, seeing that no arrest has been made.
  But there is some new evidence this time. The exchange of hats may help the
  police considerably."</p>

  <p>"In what way? What evidence does it furnish?"</p>

  <p>"In the first place it suggests a hurried departure, which seems to
  connect the missing man with the crime. Then, he is wearing the dead man's
  hat, and though he is not likely to continue wearing it, it may be seen and
  furnish a clue. We know that that hat fits him fairly well and we know its
  size, so that we know the size of his head. Finally, we have the man's own
  hat."</p>

  <p>"I don't fancy the police will get much information from that," said
  I.</p>

  <p>"Probably not," he agreed. "Yet it offered one or two interesting
  suggestions, as you probably observed."</p>

  <p>"It made no suggestions whatever to me," said I.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "I can only recommend you to recall our simple
  inspection and consider the significance of what we found."</p>

  <p>This I had to accept as closing the discussion for the time being, and as
  I had to make a call at my bookseller's concerning some reports that I had
  left to be bound, I parted from Thorndyke at the corner of Chichester Rents
  and left him to pursue his way alone. My business with the bookseller took me
  longer than I had expected, for I had to wait while the lettering on the
  backs was completed, and when I arrived at our chambers in King's Bench Walk,
  I found Thorndyke apparently at the final stage of some experiment evidently
  connected with our late adventure. The microscope stood on the table with one
  slide on the stage and a second one beside it; but Thorndyke had apparently
  finished his microscopical researches, for as I entered he held in his hand a
  test-tube filled with a smoky-coloured fluid.</p>

  <p>"I see that you have been examining the dust from the hat," said I. "Does
  it throw any fresh light on the case?"</p>

  <p>"Very little," he replied. "It is just common dust&mdash;assorted fibres
  and miscellaneous organic and mineral particles. But there are a couple of
  hairs from the inside of the hat&mdash;both lightish brown, and one of the
  atrophic, note-of-exclamation type that one finds at the margin of bald
  patches; and the outside dust shows minute traces of lead, apparently in the
  form of oxide. What do you make of that?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the man is a plumber or a painter," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Either is possible and worth considering," he replied; but his tone made
  clear to me that this was not his own inference; and a row of five
  consecutive Post Office Directories, which I had already noticed ranged along
  the end of the table, told me that he had not only formed a hypothesis on the
  subject, but had probably either confirmed or disproved it. For the Post
  Office Directory was one of Thorndyke's favourite books of reference; and the
  amount of curious and recondite information that he succeeded in extracting
  from its matter-of-fact pages would have surprised no one more than it would
  the compilers of the work.</p>

  <p>At this moment the sound of footsteps ascending our stairs became audible.
  It was late for business callers, but we were not unaccustomed to late
  visitors; and a familiar rat-tat of our little brass knocker seemed to
  explain the untimely visit.</p>

  <p>"That sounds like Superintendent Miller's knock," said Thorndyke, as he
  strode across the room to open the door. And the superintendent it turned out
  to be. But not alone.</p>

  <p>As the door opened the officer entered with two gentlemen, both natives of
  India, and one of whom was our friend Mr. Byramji.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Miller, "I had better look in a little later."</p>

  <p>"Not on my account," said Byramji. "I have only a few words to say and
  there is nothing secret about my business. May I introduce my kinsman, Mr.
  Khambata, a student of the Inner Temple?"</p>

  <p>Byramji's companion bowed ceremoniously. "Byramji came to my chambers just
  now," he explained, "to consult me about this dreadful affair, and he chanced
  to show me your card. He had not heard of you, but supposed you to be an
  ordinary medical practitioner. He did not realise that he had entertained an
  angel unawares. But I, who knew of your great reputation, advised him to put
  his affairs in your hands&mdash;without prejudice to the official
  investigations," Mr. Khambata added hastily, bowing to the
  superintendent.</p>

  <p>"And I," said Mr. Byramji, "instantly decided to act on my kinsman's
  advice. I have come to beg you to leave no stone unturned to secure the
  punishment of my cousin's murderer. Spare no expense. I am a rich man and my
  poor cousin's property will come to me. As to the ruby, recover it if you
  can, but it is of no consequence. Vengeance&mdash;justice is what I seek.
  Deliver the wretch into my hands, or into the hands of justice, and I give
  you the ruby or its value, freely&mdash;gladly."</p>

  <p>"There is no need," said Thorndyke, "of such extraordinary inducement. If
  you wish me to investigate this case, I will do so and will use every means
  at my disposal, without prejudice, as your friend says, to the proper claims
  of the officers of the law. But you understand that I can make no promises. I
  cannot guarantee success."</p>

  <p>"We understand that," said Mr. Khambata. "But we know that if you
  undertake the case, everything that is possible will be done. And now we must
  leave you to your consultation."</p>

  <p>As soon as our clients had gone, Miller rose from his chair with his hand
  in his breast pocket. "I dare say, doctor," said he, "you can guess what I
  have come about. I was sent for to look into this Byramji case and I heard
  from Mr. Byramji that you had been there and that you had made a minute
  examination of the missing man's hat. So have I; and I don't mind telling you
  that I could learn nothing from it."</p>

  <p>"I haven't learnt much myself," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"But you've picked up something," urged Miller, "if it is only a hint; and
  we have just a little clue. There is very small doubt that this is the same
  man&mdash;'The New Jersey Sphinx,' as the papers call him&mdash;that
  committed those other robberies; and a very difficult type of criminal he is
  to get hold of. He is bold, he is wary, he plays a lone hand, and he sticks
  at nothing. He has no confederates, and he kills every time. The American
  police never got near him but once; and that once gives us the only clues we
  have."</p>

  <p>"Finger-prints?" inquired Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and very poor ones, too. So rough that you can hardly make out the
  pattern. And even those are not absolutely guaranteed to be his; but in any
  case, finger-prints are not much use until you've got the man. And there is a
  photograph of the fellow himself, But it is only a snapshot, and a poor one
  at that. All it shows is that he has a mop of hair and a pointed
  beard&mdash;or at least he had when the photograph was taken. But for
  identification purposes it is practically worthless. Still, there it is; and
  what I propose is this: we want this man and so do you; we've worked together
  before and can trust one another. I am going to lay my cards on the table and
  ask you to do the same."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Miller," said Thorndyke, "I haven't any cards. I haven't a
  single solid fact."</p>

  <p>The detective was visibly disappointed. Nevertheless, he laid two
  photographs on the table and pushed them towards Thorndyke, who inspected
  them through his lens and passed them to me.</p>

  <p>"The pattern is very indistinct and broken up," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miller; "the prints must have been made on a very rough
  surface, though you get prints something like those from fitters or other men
  who use files and handle rough metal. And now, doctor, can't you give us a
  lead of any kind?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected a few moments. "I really have not a single real fact,"
  said he, "and I am unwilling to make merely speculative suggestions."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Miller replied cheerfully. "Give us a start. I
  shan't complain if it comes to nothing."</p>

  <p>"Well," Thorndyke said reluctantly, "I was thinking of getting a few
  particulars as to the various tenants of No. 51 Clifford's Inn. Perhaps you
  could do it more easily and it might be worth your while."</p>

  <p>"Good!" Miller exclaimed gleefully. "He 'gives to airy nothing a local
  habitation and a name.'"</p>

  <p>"It is probably the wrong name," Thorndyke reminded him.</p>

  <p>"I don't care," said Miller. "But why shouldn't we go together? It's too
  late to-night, and I can't manage to-morrow morning. But say to-morrow
  afternoon. Two heads are better than one, you know, especially when the
  second one is yours. Or perhaps," he added, with a glance at me, "three would
  be better still."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke considered for a moment or two and then looked at me.</p>

  <p>"What do you say, Jervis?" he asked.</p>

  <p>As my afternoon was unoccupied, I agreed with enthusiasm, being as curious
  as the superintendent to know how Thorndyke had connected this particular
  locality with the vanished criminal, and Miller departed in high spirits with
  an appointment for the morrow three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>For some time after the superintendent's depart I sat wrapped in profound
  meditation. In some mysterious way the address, 51 Clifford's Inn, had
  emerged from the formless data yielded by the derelict hat. But what had been
  the connection? Apparently the fragment of the addressed envelope had
  furnished the clue. But how had Thorndyke extended "&mdash;n" into "51,
  Clifford's Inn"? It was to me a complete mystery.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Thorndyke had seated himself at writing-table, and I noticed
  that of the two letters which he wrote, one was written on our headed paper
  and other on ordinary plain notepaper. I was speculating on the reason for
  this when he rose, and as he stuck on the stamps, said to me, "I am just
  going out to post these two letters. Do you care for a short stroll through
  the leafy shades of Fleet Street? The evening is still young."</p>

  <p>"The rural solitudes of Fleet Street attract me at all hours," I replied,
  fetching my hat from the adjoining office, and we accordingly sallied forth
  together, strolling up King's Bench Walk and emerging into Fleet Street by
  way of Mitre Court. When Thorndyke had dropped his letters into the post
  office box he stood awhile gazing up at the tower of St. Dunstan's
  Church.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been in Clifford's Inn, Jervis?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Never," I replied (we passed through it together on an average a dozen
  times a week), "but it is not too late for an exploratory visit."</p>

  <p>We crossed the road, and entering Clifford's Inn Passage, passed through
  the still half-open gate, crossed the outer court and threaded the
  tunnel-like entry by the hall to the inner court, in the middle of which
  Thorndyke halted, and looked up at one of the ancient houses, remarked, "No.
  51."</p>

  <p>"So that is where our friend hangs out his flag," said I.</p>

  <p>"Oh come, Jervis," he protested, "I am surprised at you; you are as bad as
  Miller. I have merely suggested a possible connection between these premises
  and the hat that was left at Bedford Place. As to the nature of that
  connection I have no idea, and there may be no connection at all. I assure
  you, Jervis, that I am on the thinnest possible ice. I am working on a
  hypothesis which is in the highest degree speculative, and I should not have
  given Miller a hint but that he was so eager and so willing to help&mdash;and
  also that I wanted his finger-prints. But we are really only at the
  beginning, and may never get any farther."</p>

  <p>I looked up at the old house. It was all in darkness excepting the top
  floor, where a couple of lighted windows showed the shadow of a man moving
  rapidly about the room. We crossed to the entry and inspected the names
  painted on the door-posts. The ground floor was occupied by a firm of
  photo-engravers, the first floor by a Mr. Carrington, whose name stood out
  conspicuously on its oblong of comparatively fresh white paint, while the
  tenants of the second floor&mdash;old residents, to judge by the faded and
  discoloured paint in which their names were announced&mdash;were Messrs. Burt
  &amp; Highley, metallurgists.</p>

  <p>"Burt has departed," said Thorndyke, as I read out the names; and he
  pointed to two red lines of erasure which I had not noticed in the dim light,
  "so the active gentleman above is presumably Mr. Highley, and we may take it
  that he has residential as well as business premises. I wonder who and what
  Mr. Carrington is&mdash;but I dare say we shall find out to-morrow."</p>

  <p>With this he dismissed the professional aspects of Clifford's Inn, and,
  changing the subject to its history and associations, chatted in his
  inimitable, picturesque manner until our leisurely perambulations brought us
  at length to the Inner Temple Gate.</p>

  <p>On the following morning we bustled through our work in order to leave the
  afternoon free, making several joint visits to solicitors from whom we were
  taking instructions. Returning from the last of these&mdash;a City
  lawyer&mdash;Thorndyke turned into St. Helen's Place and halted at a doorway
  bearing the brass plate of a firm of assayists and refiners. I followed him
  into the outer office, where, on his mentioning his name, an elderly man came
  to the counter.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Grayson has put out some specimens for you, sir," said he. "They are
  about thirty grains to the ton&mdash;you said that the content was of no
  importance&mdash;I am to tell you that you need not return them. They are not
  worth treating." He went to a large safe from which he took a canvas bag, and
  returning to the counter, turned out on it the contents of the bag,
  consisting of about a dozen good-sized lumps of quartz and a glittering
  yellow fragment, which Thorndyke picked out and dropped in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Will that collection do?" our friend inquired.</p>

  <p>"It will answer my purpose perfectly," Thorndyke replied, and when the
  specimens had been replaced the bag, and the latter deposited in Thorndyke's
  hand-bag, my colleague thanked the assistant and we went on our way.</p>

  <p>"We extend our activities into the domain of mineralogy," I remarked.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled an inscrutable smile. "We also employ the suction pump as
  an instrument of research," he observed. "However, the strategic uses of
  chunks of quartz&mdash;otherwise than as missiles&mdash;will develop
  themselves in due course, and the interval may be used for reflection."</p>

  <p>It was. But my reflection brought no solution. I noticed, however, that
  when at three o'clock we set forth in company with the superintendent, the
  bag went with us; and having offered to carry it and having had my offer
  accepted with a sly twinkle, its weight assured me that the quartz was still
  inside.</p>

  <p>"Chambers and Offices to let," Thorndyke read aloud as we approached the
  porter's lodge. "That lets us in, I think. And the porter knows Dr. Jervis
  and me by sight, so he will talk more freely."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't know me," said the superintendent, "but I'll keep in the
  background, all the same."</p>

  <p>A pull at the bell brought out a clerical-looking man in a tall hat and a
  frock coat, who regarded Thorndyke and me through his spectacles with an
  amiable air of recognition.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Larkin," said Thorndyke. "I am asked to get
  particulars of vacant chambers. What have you got to let?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Larkin reflected. "Let me see. There's a ground floor at No.
  5&mdash;rather dark&mdash;and a small second-pair set at No. 12. And then
  there is&mdash;oh, yes, there is a good first-floor set at No. 51. They
  wouldn't have been vacant until Michaelmas, but Mr. Carrington, the tenant,
  has had to go abroad suddenly. I had a letter from him this morning,
  enclosing the key. Funny letter, too." He dived into his pocket, and hauling
  out a bundle of letters, selected one and handed it to Thorndyke with a broad
  smile.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke glanced at the postmark ("London, E."), and having taken out the
  key, extracted the letter, which he opened and held so that Miller and I
  could see it. The paper bore the printed heading, "Baltic Shipping Company,
  Wapping," and the further written heading, "S.S. Gothenburg," and the letter
  was brief and to the point:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter">I am giving up my chambers at No. 51, as I have been
  suddenly called abroad. I enclose the key, but am not troubling you with the
  rent. The sale of my costly furniture will more than cover it, and the
  surplus can be expended on painting the garden railings,</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">A. Carrington</span>.</p><br>

  <p>Thorndyke smilingly replaced the letter and the key in the envelope and
  asked: "What is the furniture like?"</p>

  <p>"You'll see," chuckled the porter, "if you care to look at the rooms. And
  I think they might suit, They're a good set."</p>

  <p>"Quiet?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, pretty quiet. There's a metallurgist
  overhead&mdash;Highley&mdash;used to be Burt &amp; Highley, but Burt has gone
  to the City, and I don't think Highley does much business now."</p>

  <p>"Let me see," said Thorndyke, "I think I used to meet Highley
  sometimes&mdash;a tall, dark man, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"No, that would be Burt. Highley is a little, fairish man, rather bald,
  with a pretty rich complexion"&mdash;here Mr. Larkin tapped his nose
  knowingly and raised his little finger&mdash;"which may account for the
  falling off of business."</p>

  <p>"Hadn't we better have a look at the rooms?" Miller interrupted a little
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Can we see them, Mr. Larkin?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," was the reply. "You've got the key. Let me have it when
  you've seen the rooms; and whatever ever you do," he added with a broad grin,
  "be careful of the furniture."</p>

  <p>"It looks," the superintendent remarked as we crossed the inner court, "as
  if Mr. Carrington had done a mizzle. That's hopeful. And I see," he
  continued, glancing at the fresh paint on the door-post as we passed through
  the entry, "that he hasn't been here long. That's hopeful, too."</p>

  <p>We ascended to the first floor, and as Thorndyke unlocked and threw open
  the door, Miller laughed aloud. The "costly furniture" consisted of a small
  kitchen table, a Windsor chair and a dilapidated deck-chair. The kitchen
  contained a gas ring, a small saucepan and a frying-pan, and the bedroom was
  furnished with a camp-bed devoid of bed-clothes, a wash-hand basin on a
  packing-case, and a water can.</p>

  <p>"Hallo!" exclaimed the superintendent. "He's left a hat behind. Quite a
  good hat, too." He took it down from the peg, glanced at its exterior and
  then, turning it over, looked inside. And then his mouth opened with a
  jerk.</p>

  <p>"Great Solomon Eagle!" he gasped. "Do you see, doctor? It's THE hat."</p>

  <p>He held it out to us, and sure enough on the white silk lining of the
  crown were the embossed, gilt letters, D.B., just as Mr. Byramji had
  described them.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, as the superintendent snatched up a greengrocer's
  paper bag from the kitchen floor and persuaded the hat into it, "it is
  undoubtedly the missing link. But what are you going to do now?"</p>

  <p>"Do!" exclaimed Miller. "Why, I am going to collar the man. These Baltic
  boats put in at Hull and Newcastle&mdash;perhaps he didn't know
  that&mdash;and they are pretty slow boats, too. I shall wire to Newcastle to
  have the ship detained and take Inspector Badger down to make the arrest.
  I'll leave you to explain to the porter, and I owe you a thousand thanks for
  your valuable tip."</p>

  <p>With this he bustled away, clasping the precious hat and from the window
  we saw him hurry across the court and dart out through the postern into
  Fetter Lane.</p>

  <p>"I think Miller was rather precipitate," said Thorndyke. "He should have
  got a description of the man and some further particulars."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I. "Miller had much better have waited until you had finished
  with Mr. Larkin. But you can get some more particulars when we take back the
  key."</p>

  <p>"We shall get more information from the gentleman who lives on the floor
  above, and I think we will go up and interview him now. I wrote to him last
  night and made a metallurgical appointment, signing myself W. Polton. Your
  name, if he should ask, is Stevenson."</p>

  <p>As we ascended the stairs to the next floor, I meditated on the rather
  tortuous proceedings of my usually straightforward colleague. The use of the
  lumps of quartz was now obvious; but why these mysterious tactics? And why,
  before knocking at the door, did Thorndyke carefully take the reading of the
  gas meter on the landing?</p>

  <p>The door was opened in response to our knock&mdash;a shortish,
  alert-looking, clean-shaved man in a white overall, who looked at us keenly
  and rather forbiddingly. But Thorndyke was geniality personified.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mr. Highley?" said he, holding out his hand, which the
  metallurgist shook coolly. "You got my letter, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I am not Mr. Highley. He's away and I am carrying on. I think of
  taking over his business if there is any to take over. My name is Sherwood.
  Have you got the samples?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke produced the canvas bag, which Mr. Sherwood took from him and
  emptied out on a bench, picking up the lumps of quartz one by one and
  examining them closely. Meanwhile Thorndyke took a rapid survey of the
  premises. Against the wall were two cupel furnaces and a third larger furnace
  like a small pottery kiln. On a set of narrow shelves were several rows of
  bone-ash cupels, looking like little white flower-pots, and near them was the
  cupel-press&mdash;an appliance into which powdered bone-ash was fed and
  compressed by a plunger to form the cupels&mdash;while by the side of the
  press was a tub of bone-ash&mdash;a good deal coarser, I noticed, than the
  usual fine powder. This coarseness was also observed by Thorndyke, who edged
  up to the tub and dipped his hand into the ash and then wiped his fingers on
  his handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"This stuff doesn't seem to contain much gold," said Mr. Sherwood. "But we
  shall see when we make the assay."</p>

  <p>"What do you think of this?" asked Thorndyke, taking from his pocket the
  small lump of glittering, golden-looking mineral that he had picked out at
  the assayist's. Mr. Sherwood took it from him and examined it closely. "This
  looks more hopeful," said he; "rather rich, in fact."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke received this statement with an unmoved countenance; but as for
  me, I stared at Mr. Sherwood in amazement. For this lump of glittering
  mineral was simply a fragment of common iron pyrites! It would not have
  deceived a schoolboy, much less a metallurgist.</p>

  <p>Still holding the specimen, and taking a watchmaker's lens from a shelf,
  Mr. Sherwood moved over to the window. Simultaneously, Thorndyke stepped
  softly to the cupel shelves and quickly ran his eye along the rows of cupels.
  Presently he paused at one, examined it more closely, and then, taking it
  from the shelf, began to pick at it with his finger-nail.</p>

  <p>At this moment Mr. Sherwood turned and observed him; and instantly there
  flashed into the metallurgist's face an expression of mingled anger and
  alarm.</p>

  <p>"Put that down!" he commanded peremptorily, and then, as Thorndyke
  continued to scrape with his finger nail, he shouted furiously, "Do you hear?
  Drop it!"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke took him literally at his word and let the cupel fall on the
  floor, when it shattered into innumerable fragments, of which one of the
  largest separated itself from the rest. Thorndyke pounced upon it, and in an
  instantaneous glance, as he picked it up, I recognised it as a calcined
  tooth.</p>

  <p>Then followed a few moments of weird, dramatic silence. Thorndyke, holding
  the tooth between his finger and thumb, looked steadily into the eyes of the
  metallurgist; and the latter, pallid as a corpse, glared at Thorndyke and
  furtively unbuttoned his overall.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the silence broke into a tumult as bewildering as the crash of a
  railway collision. Sherwood's right hand darted under his overall. Instantly,
  Thorndyke snatched up another cupel and hurled it with such truth of aim that
  it shattered on the metallurgist's forehead. And as he flung the missile, he
  sprang forward, and delivered a swift upper-cut. There was a thunderous
  crash, a cloud of white dust, and an automatic pistol clattered along the
  floor.</p>

  <p>I snatched up the pistol and rushed to my friend's assistance. But there
  was no need. With his great strength and his uncanny skill&mdash;to say
  nothing of the effects of the knock-out blow&mdash;Thorndyke had the man
  pinned down immovably.</p>

  <p>"See if you can find some cord, Jervis," he said in a calm, quiet tone
  that seemed almost ridiculously out of character with the circumstances.</p>

  <p>There was no difficulty about this, for several corded boxes stood in a
  corner of the laboratory. I cut off two lengths, with one of which I secured
  the prostrate man's arms, and with the other fastened his knees and
  ankles.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Thorndyke, "if you will take charge of his hands, we will make
  a preliminary inspection. Let us first see if he wears a belt."</p>

  <p>Unbuttoning the man's waistcoat, he drew up the shirt, disclosing a broad,
  webbing belt furnished with several leather pockets, the buttoned flaps of
  which he felt carefully, regardless of the stream of threats and imprecations
  that poured from our victim's swollen lips. From the front pockets he
  proceeded to the back, passing an exploratory hand under the writhing
  body.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed suddenly, "just turn him over, and look out for his
  heels."</p>

  <p>We rolled our captive over, and as Thorndyke "skinned the rabbit," a
  central pocket came into view, into which, when he had unbuttoned it, he
  inserted his fingers. "Yes," he continued, "I think this is what we are
  looking for." He withdrew his fingers, between which he held a small packet
  of Japanese paper, and with feverish excitement I watched him open out layer
  after layer of the soft wrapping. As he turned back the last fold a wonderful
  crimson sparkle told me that the "great ruby" was found.</p>

  <p>"There, Jervis," said Thorndyke, holding the magnificent gem towards me in
  the palm of his hand, "look on this beautiful, sinister thing, charged with
  untold potentialities of evil&mdash;and thank the gods that it is not
  yours."</p>

  <p>He wrapped it up again carefully and, having bestowed it in an inner
  pocket, said, "And now give me the pistol and run down to the telegraph
  office and see if you can stop Miller. I should like him to have the credit
  for this."</p>

  <p>I handed him the pistol and made my way out into Fetter Lane and so down
  to Fleet Street, where at the post office my urgent message was sent off to
  Scotland Yard immediately. In a few minutes the reply came that
  Superintendent Miller had not yet left and that he was starting immediately
  for Clifford's Inn. A quarter of an hour later he drove up in a hansom to the
  Fetters Lane gate and I conducted him up to the second floor, where Thorndyke
  introduced him to his prisoner and witnessed the official arrest.</p>

  <p>"You don't see how I arrived at it," said Thorndyke as we walked homeward
  after returning the key. "Well, I am not surprised. The initial evidence was
  of the weakest; it acquired significance only by cumulative effect. Let us
  reconstruct it as it developed.</p>

  <p>"The derelict hat was, of course, the starting-point. Now, the first thing
  one noticed was that it appeared to have had more than one owner. No man
  would buy a new hat that fitted so badly as to need all that packing; and the
  arrangement of the packing suggested a long-headed man wearing a hat that had
  belonged to a man with a short head. Then there were the suggestions offered
  by the slips of paper. The fragmentary address referred to a place the name
  of which ended in 'n' and the remainder was evidently 'London, W.C.' Now what
  West Central place names end in 'n'? It was not a street, a square or a
  court, and Barbican is not in the W.C. district. It was almost certainly one
  of the half-dozen surviving Inns of Court or Chancery. But, of course, it was
  not necessarily the address of the owner of the hat.</p>

  <p>"The other slip of paper bore the end of a word ending in 'el,' and
  another word ending in 'eep,' and connected with these were quantities stated
  in ounces and pennyweights troy weight. But the only persons who use troy
  weight are those who deal in precious metals. I inferred therefore that the
  'el' was part of 'lemel,' and that the 'eep' was part of 'floor-sweep,' an
  inference that was supported by the respective quantities, three ounces five
  pennyweights of lemel and nine and a half ounces of floor-sweep."</p>

  <p>"What is lemel?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is the trade name for the gold or silver filings that collect in the
  'skin' of a jeweller's bench. Floor-sweep is, of course, the dust swept up on
  the floor of a jeweller's or goldsmith's workshop. The lemel is actual metal,
  though not of uniform fineness, but the sweep is a mixture of dirt and metal.
  Both are saved and sent to the refiners to have the gold and silver
  extracted.</p>

  <p>"This paper, then, was connected either with a gold smith or a gold
  refiner&mdash;who might call himself an assayist or a metallurgist. The
  connection was supported by the leaf of a price list of gas stoves. A
  metallurgist would be kept well supplied with lists of gas stoves and
  furnaces. The traces of lead in the dust from the hat gave us another straw
  blowing the same direction, for gold assayed by the dry process is fused in
  the cupel furnace with lead; and as the lead oxidises and the oxide is
  volatile, traces of lead would tend to appear in the dust deposited in the
  laboratory.</p>

  <p>"The next thing to do was to consult the directory; and when I did so, I
  found that there were no goldsmiths in any of the Inns and only one
  assayist&mdash;Mr. Highley, of Clifford's Inn. The probabilities therefore,
  slender as they were, pointed to some connection between this stray hat and
  Mr. Highley. And this was positively all the information that we had when we
  came out this afternoon.</p>

  <p>"As soon as we got to Clifford's Inn, however, the evidence began to grow
  like a rolling snowball. First there was Larkin's contribution; and then
  there was the discovery of the missing hat. Now, as soon as I saw that hat my
  suspicions fell upon the man upstairs. I felt a conviction that the hat had
  been left there purposely and that the letter to Larkin was just a red
  herring to create a false trail. Nevertheless, the presence of that hat
  completely confirmed the other evidence. It showed that the apparent
  connection was a real connection."</p>

  <p>"But," I asked, "what made you suspect the man upstairs?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Jervis!" he exclaimed, "consider the facts. That hat was enough
  to hang the man who left it there. Can you imagine this astute, wary villain
  making such an idiot's mistake&mdash;going away and leaving the means of his
  conviction for anyone to find? But you are forgetting that whereas the
  missing hat was found on the first floor, the murderer's hat was connected
  with the second floor. The evidence suggested that it was Highley's hat. And
  now, before we go on to the next stage, let me remind you of those
  finger-prints. Miller thought that their rough appearance was due to the
  surface on which they had been made, But it was not. They were the prints of
  a person who was suffering from ichthyosis, palmar psoriasis or sonic dry
  dermatitis.</p>

  <p>"There is one other point. The man we were looking for was a murderer. His
  life was already forfeit. To such a man another murder more or less is of no
  consequence. If this man, having laid the false trail, had determined to take
  sanctuary in Highley's rooms, it was probable that he had already got rid of
  Highley. And remember that a metallurgist has unrivalled means disposing of a
  body; for not only is each of his muffle furnaces a miniature crematorium,
  but the very residue of a cremated body&mdash;bone-ash&mdash;is one of the
  materials of his trade.</p>

  <p>"When we went upstairs, I first took the reading of the gas meter and
  ascertained that a large amount of gas had been used recently. Then, when we
  entered I took the opportunity to shake hands with Mr. Sherwood, and
  immediately I became aware that he suffered from a rather extreme form of
  ichthyosis. That was the first point of verification. Then we discovered that
  he actually could not distinguish between iron pyrites and auriferous quartz.
  He was not a metallurgist at all. He was a masquerader. Then the bone-ash in
  the tub was mixed with fragments of calcined bone, and the cupels all showed
  similar fragments. In one of them I could see part of the crown of a tooth.
  That was pure luck. But observe that by that time I had enough evidence to
  justify an arrest. The tooth served only to bring the affair to a crisis; and
  his response to my unspoken accusation saved us the trouble of further search
  for confirmatory evidence."</p>

  <p>"What is not quite clear to me," said I, "is when and why he made away
  with Highley. As the body has been completely reduced to bone-ash, Highley
  must have been dead at least some days."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," Thorndyke agreed. "I take it that the course of events was
  like this: The police have been searching eagerly for this man, and every new
  crime must have made his position more unsafe&mdash;for a criminal can never
  be sure that he has not dropped some clue. It began to be necessary for him
  to make some arrangements for leaving the country and meanwhile to have a
  retreat in case his whereabouts should chance to be discovered. Highley's
  chambers were admirable for both purposes. Here was a solitary man who seldom
  had a visitor, and who would probably not be missed for some considerable
  time; and in those chambers were the means of rapidly and completely
  disposing of the body. The mere murder would be a negligible detail to this
  ruffian.</p>

  <p>"I imagine that Highley was done to death at least a week ago, and that
  the murderer did not take up his new tenancy until the body was reduced to
  ash. With that large furnace in addition to the small ones, this would not
  take long. When the new premises were ready, he could make a sham
  disappearance to cover his actual flight later; and you must see how
  perfectly misleading that sham disappearance was. If the police had
  discovered that hat in the empty room only a week later, they would have been
  certain that he had escaped to one of the Baltic ports; and while they were
  following his supposed tracks, he could have gone off comfortably via
  Folkestone or Southampton."</p>

  <p>"Then you think he had only just moved into Highley's rooms?"</p>

  <p>"I should say he moved in last night. The murder of Byramji was probably
  planned on some information that the murderer had picked up, and as soon as
  it was accomplished he began forthwith to lay down the false tracks. When he
  reached his rooms yesterday afternoon, he must have written the letter to
  Larkin and gone off at once to the East End to post it. Then he probably had
  his bushy hair cut short and shaved off his beard and moustache&mdash;which
  would render him quite unrecognisable by Larkin&mdash;and moved into
  Highley's chambers, from which he would have quietly sallied forth in a few
  days' time to take his passage to the Continent. It was quite a good plan,
  and but for the accident of taking the wrong hat, would almost certainly have
  succeeded."</p>

  <p>Once every year, on the second of August, there is delivered with
  unfailing regularity at No. 5A King's Bench Walk a large box of carved
  sandal-wood filled with the choicest Trichinopoly cheroots and accompanied by
  an affectionate letter from our late client, Mr. Byramji. For the second of
  August is the anniversary of the death (in the execution shed at Newgate) of
  Cornelius Barnett, otherwise known as the "New Jersey Sphinx."</p>

  <h2><a name="c4"
     id="c4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE TOUCHSTONE</h2>

  <p>It happened not uncommonly that the exigencies of practice committed my
  friend Thorndyke to investigations that lay more properly within the province
  of the police. For problems that had arisen as secondary consequences of a
  criminal act could usually not be solved until the circumstances of that act
  were fully elucidated and, incidentally, the identity of the actor
  established. Such a problem was that of the disappearance of James Harewood's
  will, a problem that was propounded to us by our old friend, Mr. Marchmont,
  when he called on us, by appointment, with the client of whom he had spoken
  in his note.</p>

  <p>It was just four o'clock when the solicitor arrived at our chambers, and
  as I admitted him he ushered in a gentlemanly-looking man of about
  thirty-five, whom he introduced as Mr. William Crowhurst.</p>

  <p>"I will just stay," said he with an approving glance at the tea-service on
  the table, "and have a cup of tea with you, and give you an outline of the
  case. Then I must run away and leave Mr. Crowhurst to fill in the
  details."</p>

  <p>He seated himself in an easy chair within comfortable reach of the table,
  and as Thorndyke poured out the tea, he glanced over a few notes scribbled on
  a sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>"I may say," he began, stirring his tea thoughtfully, "that this is a
  forlorn hope. I have brought the case to you, but I have not the slightest
  expectation that you will be able to help us."</p>

  <p>"A very wholesome frame of mind," Thorndyke commented with a smile. "I
  hope it is that of your client also."</p>

  <p>"It is indeed," said Mr. Crowhurst; "in fact, it seems to me a waste of
  your time to go into the matter. Probably you will think so too, when you
  have heard the particulars."</p>

  <p>"Well, let us hear the particulars," said Thorndyke. "A forlorn hope has,
  at least, the stimulating quality of difficulty. Let us have your outline
  sketch, Marchmont."</p>

  <p>The solicitor, having emptied his cup and pushed it towards the tray for
  replenishment, glanced at his notes and began: "The simplest way in which to
  present the problem is to give a brief recital of the events that have given
  rise to it, which are these: The day before yesterday&mdash;that is last
  Monday&mdash;at a quarter to two in the afternoon, Mr. James Harewood
  executed a will at his house at Merbridge, which is about two miles from
  Welsbury. There were present four persons: two of his servants, who signed as
  witnesses, and the two principal beneficiaries&mdash;Mr. Arthur Baxfield, a
  nephew of the testator, and our friend here, Mr. William Crowhurst. The will
  was a holograph written on the two pages of a sheet of letter-paper. When the
  witnesses signed, the will was covered by another sheet of paper so that only
  the space for the signatures was exposed. Neither of the witnesses read the
  will, nor did either of the beneficiaries; and so far as I am aware, no one
  but the testator knew what were its actual provisions, though, after the
  servants had left the room, Mr. Harewood explained its general purport to the
  beneficiaries."</p>

  <p>"And what was its general purport?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Broadly speaking," replied Marchmont, "it divided the estate in two very
  unequal portions between Mr. Baxfield and Mr. Crowhurst. There were certain
  small legacies of which neither the amounts nor the names of the legatees are
  known. Then, to Baxfield was given a thousand pounds to enable him either to
  buy a partnership or to start a small factory&mdash;he is a felt hat
  manufacturer by trade&mdash;and the remainder to Crowhurst, who was made
  executor and residuary legatee. But, of course, the residue of the estate is
  an unknown quantity, since we don't know either the number or the amounts of
  the legacies.</p>

  <p>"Shortly after the signing of the will, the parties separated. Mr.
  Harewood folded up the will and put it in a leather wallet which he slipped
  into his pocket, stating his intention of taking the will forthwith to
  deposit with his lawyer at Welsbury. A few minutes after his guests had
  departed, he was seen by one of the servants to leave the house, and
  afterwards was seen by a neighbour walking along a footpath which, after
  passing through a small wood, joins the main road about a mile and a quarter
  from Welsbury. From that time, he was never again seen alive. He never
  visited the lawyer, nor did anyone see him at or near Welsbury or elsewhere
  else.</p>

  <p>"As he did not return home that night, his housekeeper (he was a widower
  and childless) became extremely alarmed, and in the morning she communicated
  with the police. A search-party was organised, and, following the path on
  which he was last seen, explored the wood&mdash;which is known as Gilbert's
  Copse&mdash;and here, at the bottom of an old chalk-pit, they found him lying
  dead with a fractured skull and a dislocated neck. How he came by these
  injuries is not at present known; but as the body had been robbed of all
  valuables, including his watch, purse, diamond ring and the wallet containing
  the will, there is naturally a strong suspicion that he has been murdered.
  That, however, is not our immediate concern&mdash;at least not mine. I am
  concerned with the will, which, as you see, has disappeared, and as it has
  presumably been carried away by a thief who is under suspicion of murder, it
  is not likely to be returned."</p>

  <p>"It is almost certainly destroyed by this time," said Mr. Crowhurst.</p>

  <p>"That certainly seems probable," Thorndyke agreed. "But what do you want
  me to do? You haven't come for counsel's opinion?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Marchmont. "I am pretty clear about the legal position. I
  shall claim, as the will has presumably been destroyed, to have the
  testator's wishes carried out in so far as they are known. But I am doubtful
  as to the view the court may take. It may decide that the testator's wishes
  are not known, that the provisions of the will are too uncertain to admit of
  administration."</p>

  <p>"And what would be the effect of that decision?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Marchmont, "the entire estate would go to Baxfield,
  as he is the next of kin and there was no previous will."</p>

  <p>"And what is it that you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>Marchmont chuckled deprecatingly. "You have to pay the penalty of being a
  prodigy, Thorndyke. We are asking you to do an impossibility&mdash;but we
  don't really expect you to bring it off. We ask you to help us to recover the
  will."</p>

  <p>"If the will has been completely destroyed, it can't be recovered," said
  Thorndyke. "But we don't know that it has been destroyed. The matter is, at
  least, worth investigating; and if you wish me to look into it, I will."</p>

  <p>The solicitor rose with an air of evident relief.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Thorndyke," said he. "I expect nothing&mdash;at least, I tell
  myself that I do&mdash;but I can now feel that everything that is possible
  will be done. And now I must be off. Crowhurst can give you any details that
  you want."</p>

  <p>When Marchmont had gone, Thorndyke turned to our client and asked, "What
  do you suppose Baxfield will do, if the will is irretrievably lost? Will he
  press his claim as next of kin?"</p>

  <p>"I should say yes," replied Crowhurst. "He is a businessman and his
  natural claims are greater than mine. He is not likely to refuse what the law
  assigns to him as his right. As a matter of fact, I think he felt that his
  uncle had treated him unfairly in alienating the property."</p>

  <p>"Was there any reason for this diversion of the estate?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Crowhurst, "Harewood and I have been very good friends and
  he was under some obligations to me; and then Baxfield had not made himself
  very acceptable to his uncle. But the principal factor, I think, was a strong
  tendency of Baxfield's to gamble. He had lost quite a lot of money by backing
  horses, and a careful, thrifty man like James Harewood doesn't care to leave
  his savings to a gambler. The thousand pounds that he did leave to Baxfield
  was expressly for the purpose of investment in a business."</p>

  <p>"Is Baxfield in business now?"</p>

  <p>"Not on his own account. He is a sort of foreman or shop-manager in a
  factory just outside Welsbury, and I believe he is a good worker and knows
  his trade thoroughly."</p>

  <p>"And now," said Thorndyke, "with regard to Mr Harewood's death. The
  injuries might, apparently, have been either accidental or homicidal. What
  are the probabilities of accident&mdash;disregarding the robbery?"</p>

  <p>"Very considerable, I should say. It is a most dangerous place. The
  footpath runs close beside the edge of a disused chalk-pit with perpendicular
  or over hanging sides, and the edge is masked by bushes and brambles. A
  careless walker might easily fall over&mdash;or be pushed over, for that
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Do you know when the inquest is to take place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The day after to-morrow. I had the subpoena this morning for Friday
  afternoon at 2.30, at the Welsbury Town Hall."</p>

  <p>At this moment footsteps were heard hurriedly ascending the stairs and
  then came a loud and peremptory rat-tat at our door. I sprang across to see
  who our visitor was, and as I flung open the door, Mr. Marchmont rushed in,
  breathing heavily and flourishing a newspaper.</p>

  <p>"Here is a new development," he exclaimed. "It doesn't seem to help us
  much, but I thought you had better know about it at once." He sat down, and
  putting on his spectacles, read aloud as follows: "A new and curious light
  has been thrown on the mystery of the death of Mr. James Harewood, whose body
  was found yesterday in a disused chalk-pit near Merbridge. It appears that on
  Monday&mdash;the day on which Mr. Harewood almost certainly was
  killed&mdash;a passenger alighting from a train at Barwood Junction before it
  had stopped, slipped and fell between the train and the platform. He was
  quickly extricated, and as he had evidently sustained internal injuries, he
  was taken to the local hospital, where he was found to be suffering from a
  fractured pelvis. He gave his name as Thomas Fletcher, but refused to give
  any address, saying that he had no relatives. This morning he died, and on
  his clothes being searched for an address, a parcel, formed of two
  handkerchiefs tied up with string, was found in his pocket. When it was
  opened it was found to contain five watches, three watch-chains, a tie-pin
  and a number of bank-notes. Other pockets contained a quantity of loose
  money&mdash;gold and silver mixed&mdash;and a card of the Welsbury Races,
  which were held on Monday. Of the five watches, one has been identified as
  the one taken from Mr. Harewood; and the bank-notes have been identified as a
  batch handed to him by the cashier, of his bank at Welsbury last Thursday and
  presumably carried in the leather wallet which was stolen from his pocket.
  This wallet, by the way, has also been found. It was picked
  up&mdash;empty&mdash;last night on the railway embankment just outside
  Welsbury Station. Appearances thus suggest that the man, Fletcher, when on
  his way to the races, encountered Mr. Harewood in the lonely copse, and
  murdered and robbed him; or perhaps found him dead in the chalk-pit and
  robbed the body&mdash;a question that is now never likely to be solved."</p>

  <p>As Marchmont finished reading, he looked up at Thorndyke. "It doesn't help
  us much, does it?" said he. "As the wallet was found empty, it is pretty
  certain that the will has been destroyed."</p>

  <p>"Or perhaps merely thrown away," said Thorndyke. "In which case an
  advertisement offering a substantial reward may bring it to light."</p>

  <p>The solicitor shrugged his shoulders sceptically, but agreed to publish
  the advertisement. Then, once more he turned to go; and as Mr. Crowhurst had
  no further information to give, he departed with his lawyer.</p>

  <p>For some time after they had gone, Thorndyke sat with his brief notes
  before him, silent and deeply reflective. I, too, maintained a discreet
  silence, for I knew from long experience that the motionless pose and quiet,
  impassive face were the outward signs of a mind in swift and strenuous
  action. Instinctively, I gathered that this apparently chaotic case was being
  quietly sorted out and arranged in a logical order; that Thorndyke, like a
  skilful chess-player, was "trying over the moves" before he should lay his
  hand upon the pieces.</p>

  <p>Presently he looked up. "Well?" he asked. "What do you think, Jervis? Is
  it worth while?"</p>

  <p>"That," I replied, "depends on whether the will is or is not in existence.
  If it has been destroyed, an investigation would be a waste of our time and
  our client's money."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed. "But there is quite a good chance that it has not been
  destroyed. It was probably dropped loose into the wallet, and then might have
  been picked out and thrown away before the wallet was examined. But we
  mustn't concentrate too much on the will. If we take up the case&mdash;which
  I am inclined to do&mdash;we must ascertain the actual sequence of events. We
  have one clear day before the inquest. If we run down to Merbridge to-morrow
  and go thoroughly over the ground, and then go on to Barwood and find out all
  we can about the man Fletcher, we may get some new light from the evidence at
  the inquest."</p>

  <p>I agreed readily to Thorndyke's proposal, not that I could see any way
  into the case, but I felt a conviction that my colleague had isolated some
  leading fact and had a definite line of research in his mind. And this
  conviction deepened when, later in the evening, he laid his research-case on
  the table, and rearranged its contents with evident purpose. I watched
  curiously the apparatus that he was packing in it and tried&mdash;not very
  successfully&mdash;to infer the nature of the proposed investigation. The box
  of powdered paraffin wax and the spirit blowpipe were obvious enough; but the
  "dust-aspirator"&mdash;a sort of miniature vacuum cleaner&mdash;the portable
  microscope, the coil of Manila line, with an eye spliced into one end, and
  especially the abundance of blank-labelled microscope slides, all of which I
  saw him pack in the case with deliberate care, defeated me utterly.</p>

  <p>About ten o'clock on the following morning we stepped from the train in
  Welsbury Station, and having recovered our bicycles from the luggage van,
  wheeled them through the barrier and mounted. During the train journey we had
  both studied the one-inch Ordnance map to such purpose that we were virtually
  in familiar surroundings and immune from the necessity of seeking directions
  from the natives. As we cleared the town we glanced up the broad by-road to
  the left which led to the race-course; then we rode on briskly for a mile,
  which brought us to the spot where the footpath to Merbridge joined the road.
  Here we dismounted and, lifting our bicycles over the stile, followed the
  path towards a small wood which we could see ahead, crowning a low hill.</p>

  <p>"For such a good path," Thorndyke remarked as we approached the wood, "it
  is singularly unfrequented. I haven't seen a soul since we left the road." He
  glanced at the map as the path entered the wood, and when we had walked on a
  couple of hundred yards, he halted and stood his bicycle against a tree. "The
  chalk-pit should be about here," said he, "though it is impossible to see. He
  grasped a stem of one of the small bushes that crowded on to the path and
  pulled it aside. Then he uttered an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Just look at that, Jervis. It is a positive scandal that a public path
  should be left in this condition."</p>

  <p>Certainly Mr. Crowhurst had not exaggerated. It was a most dangerous
  place. The parted branches revealed a chasm some thirty feet deep, the brink
  of which, masked by the bushes, was but a matter of inches from the edge of
  the path.</p>

  <p>"We had better go back," said Thorndyke, "and find the entrance to the
  pit, which seems to be to the right. The first thing is to ascertain exactly
  where Harewood fell. Then we can come back and examine the place from
  above."</p>

  <p>We turned back, and presently found a faint track which we followed until,
  descending steeply, it brought us out into the middle of the pit. It was
  evidently an ancient pit, for the sides were blackened by age, and the floor
  was occupied by a trees of some of considerable size. Against one of these we
  leaned our bicycles and then walked slowly round at the foot of the frowning
  cliff.</p>

  <p>"This seems to be below the path," said Thorndyke, glancing up at the grey
  wall which jutted out above in stages like an inverted flight of steps.
  "Somewhere hereabouts we should find some traces of the tragedy."</p>

  <p>Even as he spoke my eye caught a spot of white on a block of chalk, and on
  the freshly fractured surface a significant brownish-red stain. The block lay
  opposite the mouth of an artificial cave&mdash;an old wagon-shelter but now
  empty and immediately under a markedly overhanging part of the cliff.</p>

  <p>"This is undoubtedly the place where he fell," said Thorndyke. "You can
  see where the stretcher was placed&mdash;an old-pattern stretcher with
  wheel-runners&mdash;and there is a little spot of broken soil at the top
  where he came over. Well, apart from the robbery, a clear fall of over thirty
  feet is enough to account for a fractured skull. Will you stay here, Jervis,
  while I run up and look at the path?"</p>

  <p>He went off towards the entrance, and presently I heard him above, pulling
  aside the bushes, and after one or two trials, he appeared directly
  overhead.</p>

  <p>"There are plenty of footprints on the path," said he, "but nothing
  abnormal. No trampling or signs of a struggle. I am going on a little
  farther."</p>

  <p>He withdrew behind the bushes, and I proceeded to inspect the interior of
  the cave, noting the smoke-blackened roof and the remains of a recent fire,
  which, with a number of rabbit bones and a discarded tea-boiler of the kind
  used by the professional tramp, seemed not without a possible bearing on our
  investigation. I was thus engaged when I heard Thorndyke hail me from above
  and coming out of the cave, I saw his head thrust between the branches. He
  seemed to be lying down, for his face was nearly on a level with the top of
  the cliff.</p>

  <p>"I want to take an impression," he called out. "Will you bring up the
  paraffin and the blower? And you might bring the coil of line, too."</p>

  <p>I hurried away to the place where our bicycles were standing, and opening
  the research-case, took out the coil of line, the tin of paraffin wax and the
  spirit blowpipe, and having ascertained that the container of the latter was
  full, I ran up the incline and made my way along the path. Some distance
  along, I found my colleague nearly hidden in the bushes, lying prone, with
  his head over the edge of the cliff.</p>

  <p>"You see, Jervis," he said, as I crawled alongside and looked over, "this
  is a possible way down, and someone has used it quite recently. He climbed
  down with his face to the cliff&mdash;you can see the clear impression of the
  toe of a boot in the loam of that projection, and you can even make out the
  shape of an iron toe-tip. Now the problem is how to get down to take the
  impression without, dislodging the earth above it. I think I will secure
  myself with the line."</p>

  <p>"It is hardly worth the risk of a broken neck," said I. "Probably the
  print is that of some schoolboy."</p>

  <p>"It is a man's foot," he replied. "Most likely it has no connection with
  our case. But it may have, and as a shower of rain would obliterate it we
  ought to secure it." As he spoke, he passed the end of the cord through eye
  and slipped the loop over his shoulders, drawing tight under his arms. Then,
  having made the line fast to the butt of a small tree, he cautiously lowered
  himself over the edge and climbed down to the projection. A soon as he had a
  secure footing, I passed the spare cord through the ring on the lid of the
  wax tin and lowered it to him, and when he had unfastened it, I drew up the
  cord and in the same way let down the blowpipe. Then I watched his neat,
  methodical procedure. First he took out a spoonful of the powdered, or
  grated, wax and very delicately sprinkled it on the toe-print until the
  latter was evenly but very thinly covered. Next he lit the blowlamp, and as
  soon as the blue flame began to roar from the pipe, he directed it on to the
  toe-print. Almost instantly the powder melted, glazing the impression like a
  coat of varnish. The flame was removed and the film of wax at once solidified
  and became dull and opaque. A second, heavier, sprinkling with the powder,
  followed by another application of the flame, thickened the film of wax, and
  this process, repeated four or five times, eventually produced a solid cake.
  Then Thorndyke extinguished the blowlamp, and securing it and the tin to the
  cord, directed me to pull them up. "And you might send me down the
  field-glasses," he added. "There is something farther down that I can't quite
  make out."</p>

  <p>I slipped the glasses from my shoulder, and opening the case, tied the
  cord to the leather sling and lowered it down the cliff; and then I watched
  with some curiosity as Thorndyke stood on his insecure perch steadily gazing
  through the glasses (they were Zeiss 8-prismatics) at a clump of wallflowers
  that grew from a boss of chalk about half-way down. Presently he lowered the
  glasses and, slinging them round his neck by their lanyard, turned his
  attention to the cake of wax. It was by this time quite solid, and when he
  had tested it, he lifted it carefully, and placed it in the empty binocular
  case, when I drew it up.</p>

  <p>"I want you, Jervis," Thorndyke called up, "to steady the line. I am going
  down to that wallflower clump."</p>

  <p>It looked extremely unsafe, but I knew it was useless to protest, so I
  hitched the line around a massive stump and took a firm grip of the
  "fall."</p>

  <p>"Ready," I sang out; and forthwith Thorndyke began to creep across the
  face of the cliff with feet and hands clinging to almost invisible
  projections. Fortunately, there was at this part no overhang, and though my
  heart was in my mouth as I watched, I saw him cross the perilous space in
  safety. Arrived at the clump, he drew an envelope from his pocket, stooped
  and picked up some small object, which he placed in the envelope, returning
  the latter to his pocket. Then he gave me another bad five minutes while he
  recrossed the nearly vertical surface to his starting-point; but at length
  this, too, was safely accomplished, and when he finally climbed up over the
  edge and stood beside me on solid earth, I drew a deep breath and turned to
  revile him.</p>

  <p>"Well?" I demanded sarcastically, "what have you gathered at the risk of
  your neck? Is it samphire or edelweiss?"</p>

  <p>He drew the envelope from his pocket, and dipping into it, produced a
  cigarette-holder&mdash;a cheap bone affair, black and clammy with long
  service and still holding the butt of a hand-made cigarette&mdash;and handed
  it to me. I turned it over, smelled it and hastily handed it back. "For my
  part," said I, "I wouldn't have risked the cervical vertebra of a yellow cat
  for it. What do you expect to learn from it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, I expect nothing. We are just collecting facts on the chance
  that they may turn out to be relevant. Here, for instance, we find that a man
  has descended, within a few yards of where Harewood fell, by this very
  inconvenient route, instead of going round to the entrance to the pit. He
  must have had some reason for adopting this undesirable mode of descent.
  Possibly he was in a hurry, and probably he belonged to the district, since a
  stranger would not know of the existence of this short cut. Then it seems
  likely that this was his cigarette tube. If you look over, you will see by
  those vertical scrapes on the chalk that he slipped and must have nearly
  fallen. At that moment he probably dropped the tube, for you notice that the
  wallflower clump is directly under the marks of his toes."</p>

  <p>"Why do you suppose he did not recover the tube?"</p>

  <p>"Because the descent slopes away from the position of the clump, and he
  had no trusty Jervis with a stout cord to help him to cross the space. And if
  he went down this way because he was hurried, he would not have time to
  search for the tube. But if the tube was not his, still it belonged to
  somebody who has been here recently."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything that leads you to connect this man with the crime?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing but time and place," he replied. "The man has been down into the
  pit close to where Harewood was robbed and possibly murdered, and as the
  traces are quite recent, he must have been there near about the time of the
  robbery. That is all. I am considering the traces of this man in particular
  because there are no traces of any other. But we may as well have a look at
  the path, which, as you see, yields good impressions."</p>

  <p>We walked slowly along the path towards Merbridge, keeping at the edges
  and scrutinising the surface closely. In the shady hollows, the soft loam
  bore prints of many feet, and among them we could distinguish one with an
  iron toe-tip, but it was nearly obliterated by another studded with
  hob-nails.</p>

  <p>"We shan't get much information here," said Thorndyke as he turned about.
  "The search-party have trodden out the important prints. Let us see if we can
  find out where the man with the toe-tips went to."</p>

  <p>We searched the path on the Welsbury side of the chalk-pit, but found no
  trace of him. Then we went into the pit, and having located the place where
  he descended, sought for some other exit than the track leading to the path.
  Presently, half-way up the slope, we found a second track, bearing away in
  the direction of Merbridge. Following this for some distance, we came to a
  small hollow at the bottom of which was a muddy space. And here we both
  halted abruptly, for in the damp ground were the clear imprints of a pair of
  boots which we could see had, in addition to the toe-tips, half-tips to the
  heels.</p>

  <p>"We had better have wax casts of these," said Thorndyke, "to compare with
  the boots of the man Fletcher. I will do them while you go back for the
  bicycles."</p>

  <p>By the time that I returned with the machines two of the footprints were
  covered with a cake each of wax, and Thorndyke had left the track, and was
  peering among the bushes. I inquired what he was looking for.</p>

  <p>"It is a forlorn hope, as Marchmont would say," he replied, "but I am
  looking to see if the will has been thrown away here. It was quite probably
  jettisoned at once, and this is the most probable route for the robber to
  have taken, if he knew of it. You see by the map that it must lead nearly
  directly to the race-course, and it avoids both the path and the main road.
  While the wax is setting we might as well look round."</p>

  <p>It seemed a hopeless enough proceeding and I agreed to it without
  enthusiasm. Leaving the track on the opposite side to that which Thorndyke
  was searching, I wandered among the bushes and the little open spaces,
  peering about me and reminding myself of that "aged, aged man" who</p>

  <p>"Sometimes searched the grassy knolls,<br></p>

  <p>For wheels of hansom cabs."</p>

  <p>I had worked my way nearly back to where I could see Thorndyke, also
  returning, when my glance fell on a small, brown object caught among the
  branches of a bush. It was a man's pigskin purse; and as I picked it out of
  the bush I saw that it was open and empty.</p>

  <p>With my prize in my hand, I hastened to the spot where Thorndyke was
  lifting the wax casts. He looked up and asked, "No luck, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>I held out the purse, on which he pounced eagerly. "But this is most
  important, Jervis," he exclaimed. "It is almost certainly Harewood's purse.
  You see the initials, 'J. H.,' stamped on the flap. Then we were right as to
  the direction that the robber took. And it would pay to search this place
  exhaustively for the will, though we can't do that now, as we have to go to
  Barwood, I wrote to say we were coming. We had better get back to the path
  now and make for the road. Barwood is only half-an-hour's run."</p>

  <p>We packed the casts in the research-case (which was strapped to
  Thorndyke's bicycle), and turning back, made our way to the path. As it was
  still deserted, we ventured to mount, and soon reached the road, along which
  we started at a good pace toward Barwood.</p>

  <p>Half-an-hour's ride brought us into the main Street of the little town,
  and when we dismounted at the police station we found the Chief Constable
  himself waiting to receive us, courteously eager to assist us, but possessed
  by a devouring curiosity which was somewhat inconvenient.</p>

  <p>"I have done as you asked me in your letter, sir," he said. "Fletcher's
  body is, of course, in the mortuary, but I have had all his clothes and
  effects brought here; and I have had them put in my private office, so that
  you can look them over in comfort."</p>

  <p>"It is exceedingly good of you," said Thorndyke, "and most helpful." He
  unstrapped the research-case, and following the officer into his sanctum,
  looked round with deep approval. A large table had been cleared for the
  examination, and the dead pickpocket's clothes and effects neatly arranged at
  one end.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's first proceeding was to pick up the dead man's boots&mdash;a
  smart but flimsy pair of light brown leather, rather down at heel and in need
  of re-soling. Neither toes nor heels bore any tips or even nails excepting
  the small fastening brads. Having exhibited them to me without remark,
  Thorndyke placed them on a sheet of white paper and made a careful tracing of
  the soles, a proceeding that seemed to surprise the Chief Constable, for he
  remarked, "I should hardly have thought that the question of footprints would
  arise in this case. You can't charge a dead man."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke agreed that this seemed to be true; and then he proceeded to an
  operation that fairly made the officer's eyes bulge. Opening the
  research-case&mdash;into which the officer cast an inquisitive
  glance&mdash;he took out the dust-aspirator, the nozzle of which he inserted
  into one after another of the dead thief's pockets while I worked the pump.
  When he had gone through them all, he opened the receiver and extracted quite
  a considerable ball of dusty fluff. Placing this on a glass slide, he tore it
  in halves with a pair of mounted needles and passing one half to me, when we
  both fell to work "teasing", it out into an open mesh, portions of which we
  separated and laid&mdash;each in a tiny pool of glycerine&mdash;on blank
  labelled glass slides, applying to each slide its cover-glass and writing on
  the label, "Dust from Fletcher's pockets."</p>

  <p>When the series was complete, Thorndyke brought out the microscope, and
  fitting on a one-inch objective, quickly examined the slides, one after
  another, and then pushed the microscope to me. So far as I could see, the
  dust was just ordinary dust&mdash;principally made up of broken cotton fibres
  with a few fibres of wool, linen, wood, jute, and others that I could not
  name and some undistinguishable mineral particles. But I made no comment, and
  resigning the microscope to the Chief Constable&mdash;who glared through it,
  breathing hard, and remarked that the dust was "rummy-looking
  stuff"&mdash;watched Thorndyke's further proceedings. And very odd
  proceedings they were.</p>

  <p>First he laid the five stolen watches in a row, and with a Coddington lens
  minutely examined the dial of each, Then he opened the back of each in turn
  and copied into his notebook the watch-repairers' scratched inscriptions.
  Next he produced from the case a number of little vulcanite rods, and laying
  out five labelled slides, dropped a tiny drop of glycerine on each, covering
  it at once with a watch-glass to protect it from falling dust. Then he stuck
  a little label on each watch, wrote a number on it and similarly numbered the
  five slides. His next proceeding was to take out the glass of watch No. 1 and
  pick up one of the vulcanite rods, which he rubbed briskly on a silk
  handkerchief and passed across and around the dial of the watch, after which
  he held the rod close to the glycerine on slide No. 1 and tapped it sharply
  with the blade of his pocket-knife. Then he dropped a cover-glass on to the
  glycerine and made a rapid inspection of the specimen through the
  microscope.</p>

  <p>This operation he repeated on the other four watches, using a fresh rod
  for each, and when he had finished he turned to the open-mouthed officer. "I
  take it," said he, "that the watch which has the chain attached to it is Mr.
  Harewood's watch?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. That helped us to identify it." Thorndyke looked at the watch
  reflectively. Attached to the bow by a short length of green tape was a
  small, rather elaborate key. This my friend picked up, and taking a fresh
  mounted needle, inserted it into the barrel of the key, from which he then
  withdrew it with a tiny ball of fluff on its point. I hastily prepared a
  slide and handed it to him, when, with a pair of dissecting scissors, he cut
  off a piece of the fluff and let it fall into the glycerine. He repeated this
  manoeuvre with two more slides and then labelled the three "Key, outside,"
  "middle" and "inside," and in that order examined them under the
  microscope.</p>

  <p>My own examination of the specimens yielded very little. They all seemed
  to be common dust, though that from the face of watch No. 3 contained a few
  broken fragments of what looked like animal hairs&mdash;possibly
  cat's&mdash;as also did the key-fluff marked "outside." But if this had any
  significance, I could not guess what it was. As to the Chief Constable, he
  clearly looked on the whole proceeding as a sort of legerdemain with no
  obvious purpose, for he remarked, as we were packing up to go, "I am glad
  I've seen how you do it, sir. But all the same, I think you are flogging a
  dead horse. We know who committed the crime and we know he's beyond the reach
  of the law."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, "one must earn one's fee, you know. I shall put
  Fletcher's boots and the five watches in evidence at the inquest to-morrow,
  and I will ask you to leave the labels on the watches." With renewed thanks
  and a hearty handshake he bade the courteous officer adieu, and we rode off
  to catch the train to London.</p>

  <p>That evening, after dinner, we brought out the specimens and went over
  them at our leisure; and Thorndyke added a further specimen by drawing a
  knotted piece of twine through the cigarette-holder that he had salved from
  the chalk-pit, and teasing out the unsavoury, black substance that came out
  on the string in glycerine on a slide. When he had examined it, he passed it
  to me, The dark, tarry liquid somewhat obscured the detail, but I could make
  out fragments of the same animal hairs that I had noted in the other
  specimens, only here they were much more numerous. I mentioned my observation
  to Thorndyke. "They are certainly parts of mammalian hairs," I said, "and
  they look like the hairs of a cat. Are they from a cat?"</p>

  <p>"Rabbit," Thorndyke replied curtly; and even then, I am ashamed to admit,
  I did not perceive the drift of the investigation.</p>

  <p>The room in the Welsbury Town Hall had filled up some minutes before the
  time fixed for the opening of the inquest, and in the interval, when the jury
  had retired to view the body in the adjacent mortuary, I looked round the
  assembly. Mr. Marchmont and Mr. Crowhurst were present, and a youngish,
  horsey-looking man in cord breeches and leggings, whom I correctly guessed to
  be Arthur Baxfield. Our friend the Chief Constable of Barwood was also there,
  and with him Thorndyke exchanged a few words in a retired corner. The rest of
  the company were strangers.</p>

  <p>As soon as the coroner and the jury had taken their places the medical
  witness was called. The cause of death, he stated, was dislocation of the
  neck, accompanied by a depressed fracture of the skull. The fracture have
  been produced by a blow with a heavy weapon, or by the deceased falling on
  his head. The witness adopted the latter view, as the dislocation showed that
  deceased had fallen in that manner.</p>

  <p>The next witness was Mr. Crowhurst, who repeated to the court what he had
  told us, and further stated that on leaving deceased's house he went straight
  home, as he had an appointment with a friend. He was followed by Baxfield,
  who gave evidence to the same effect, and stated that on leaving the house of
  the deceased he went to his place of business at Welsbury. He was about to
  retire when Thorndyke rose to cross-examine.</p>

  <p>"At what time did you reach your place of business?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The witness hesitated for a few moments and then replied, "Half-past
  four."</p>

  <p>"And what time did you leave deceased's house?"</p>

  <p>"Two o'clock," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"What is the distance?"</p>

  <p>"In a direct line, about two miles. But I didn't go direct. I took a round
  in the country by Lenfield."</p>

  <p>"That would take you near the race-course on the way back. Did you go to
  the races?</p>

  <p>"No. The races were just over when I returned."</p>

  <p>There was a slight pause and then Thorndyke asked, "Do you smoke much, Mr.
  Baxfield?"</p>

  <p>The witness looked surprised, and so did the jury, but the former replied,
  "A fair amount. About fifteen cigarettes a day."</p>

  <p>"What brand of cigarettes do you smoke, and what kind of tobacco is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I make my own cigarettes. I make them of shag."</p>

  <p>Here protesting murmurs arose from the jury, and the coroner remarked
  stiffly, "These questions do not appear to have much connection with the
  subject of this inquiry."</p>

  <p>"You may take it, sir," replied Thorndyke, "that they have a very direct
  bearing on it." Then, turning to the witness he asked, "Do you use a
  cigarette-tube?</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I do," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Have you lost a cigarette-tube lately?"</p>

  <p>The witness directed a startled glance at Thorndyke and replied after some
  hesitation, "I believe I mislaid one a little time ago."</p>

  <p>"When and where did you lose that tube?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I really couldn't say," replied Baxfield, turning perceptibly
  pale.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke opened his dispatch-box, and taking out the tube that he had
  salved at so much risk, handed it to the witness. "Is that the tube that you
  lost?" he asked.</p>

  <p>At this question Baxfield turned pale as death, and the hand in which he
  received the tube shook as if with a palsy. "It may be," he faltered. "I
  wouldn't swear to it. It is like the one I lost."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke took it from him and passed it to the coroner. "I am putting
  this tube in evidence, sir," said he. Then addressing the witness, he said,
  "You stated that you did not go to the races. Did you go on the course or
  inside the grounds at all?"</p>

  <p>Baxfield moistened his lips and replied, "I just went in for a minute or
  two, but I didn't stay. The races were over, and there was a very rough
  crowd."</p>

  <p>"While you were in that crowd, Mr Baxfield, did you have your pocket
  picked?"</p>

  <p>There was an expectant silence in the court as Baxfield replied in a low
  voice: "Yes. I lost my watch."</p>

  <p>Again Thorndyke opened the dispatch-box, and taking out a watch (it was
  the one that had been labelled 3), handed it to the witness. "Is that the
  watch that you lost?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Baxfield held the watch in his trembling hand and replied hesitatingly, "I
  believe it is, but I won't swear to it."</p>

  <p>There was a pause. Then, in grave, impressive tones, Thorndyke said, "Now,
  Mr. Baxfield, I am going to ask you a question which you need not answer if
  you consider that by doing so you would prejudice your position in any way.
  That question is, When your pocket was picked, were any articles besides this
  watch taken from your person? Don't hurry. Consider your answer
  carefully."</p>

  <p>For some moments Baxfield remained silent, regarding Thorndyke with a
  wild, affrighted stare. At length he began falteringly, "I don't remember
  missing any thing&mdash;" and then stopped.</p>

  <p>"Could the witness be allowed to sit down, sir?" Thorndyke asked. And when
  the permission had been given and a chair placed, Baxfield sat down heavily
  and cast a bewildered glance round the court. "I think," he said, addressing
  Thorndyke, "I had better tell you exactly what happened and take my chance of
  the consequences. When I left my uncle's house on Monday, I took a circuit
  through the fields and then entered Gilbert's Copse to wait for my uncle and
  tell him what I thought of his conduct in leaving the bulk of his property to
  a stranger. I struck the path that I knew my uncle would take and walked
  along it slowly to meet him. I did meet him&mdash;on the path, just above
  where he was found&mdash;and I began to say what was in my mind. But he
  wouldn't listen. He flew into a rage, and as I was standing in the middle of
  the path, he tried to push past me. In doing so he caught his foot in a
  bramble and staggered back, then he disappeared through the bushes and a few
  seconds after I heard a thud down below. I pulled the bushes aside and looked
  down into the chalk-pit, and there I saw him lying with his head all on one
  side. Now, I happened to know of a short cut down into the pit. It was rather
  a dangerous climb, but I took it to get down as quickly as possible. It was
  there that I dropped the cigarette-tube. When I got to my uncle I could see
  that he was dead. His skull was battered and his neck was broken. Then the
  devil put into my head the idea of making away with the will. But I knew that
  if I took the will only, suspicion would fall on me. So I took most of his
  valuables&mdash;the wallet, his watch and chain, his purse and his ring. The
  purse I emptied and threw away, and flung the ring after it. I took the will
  out of the wallet&mdash;it had just been dropped in loose&mdash;and put it in
  an inner pocket. Then I dropped the wallet and the watch and chain into my
  outside coat pocket.</p>

  <p>"I struck across country, intending to make for the race-course and drop
  the things among the crowd, so that they might be picked up and safely
  carried away. But when I got there a gang of pickpockets saved me the
  trouble; they mobbed and hustled me and cleared my pockets of everything but
  my keys and the will."</p>

  <p>"And what has become of the will?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I have it here." He dipped into his breast pocket and produced a folded
  paper, which he handed to Thorndyke, who opened it, and having glanced at it,
  passed it to the coroner.</p>

  <p>That was practically the end of the inquest. The jury decided to accept
  Baxfield's statement and recorded a verdict of "Death by Misadventure,"
  leaving Baxfield to be dealt with by the proper authorities.</p>

  <p>"An interesting and eminently satisfactory case," remarked Thorndyke, as
  we sat over a rather late dinner. "Essentially simple, too. The elucidation
  turned, as you probably noticed, on a single illuminating fact."</p>

  <p>"I judged that it was so," said I, "though the illumination of that fact
  has not yet reached me."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, "let us first take the general aspect of the case
  as it was presented by Marchmont. The first thing, of course, that struck one
  was that the loss of the will might easily have converted Baxfield from a
  minor beneficiary to the sole heir. But even if the court agreed to recognise
  the will, it would have to be guided by the statements of the only two men to
  whom its provisions were even approximately known, and Baxfield could have
  made any statement he pleased. It was impossible to ignore the fact that the
  loss of the will was very greatly to Baxfield's advantage.</p>

  <p>"When the stolen property was discovered in Fletcher's possession it
  looked, at the first glance, as if the mystery of the crime were solved. But
  there were several serious inconsistencies. First, how came Fletcher to be in
  this solitary wood, remote from any railway or even road? He appeared to be a
  London pickpocket. When he was killed he was travelling to London by train.
  It seemed probable that he had come from London by train to ply his trade at
  the races. Then, as you know, criminological experience shows that the
  habitual criminal is a rigid specialist. The burglar, the coiner, the
  pickpocket, each keeps strictly to his own special line Now, Fletcher was a
  pickpocket, and had evidently been picking pockets on the race-course. The
  probabilities were against his being the original robber and in favour of his
  having picked the pocket of the person who robbed Harewood. But if this were
  so, who was that person? Once more the probabilities suggested Baxfield.
  There was the motive, as I have said, and further, the pocket-picking had
  apparently taken place on the race-course, and Baxfield was known to be a
  frequenter of race-courses. But again, if Baxfield were the person robbed by
  Fletcher, then one of the five watches was probably Baxfield's watch. Whether
  it was so or not might have been very difficult to prove, but here came in
  the single illuminating fact that I have spoken of.</p>

  <p>"You remember that when Marchmont opened the case he mentioned that
  Baxfield was a manufacturer of felt hats, and Crowhurst told us that he was a
  sort of foreman or manager of the factory."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember, now you speak of it. But what is the bearing of the
  fact?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Jervis!" exclaimed Thorndyke. "Don't you see that it gave us a
  touchstone? Consider, now. What is a felt hat? It is just a mass of
  agglutinated rabbits' hair. The process of manufacture consists in blowing a
  jet of the more or less disintegrated hair on to a revolving steel cone which
  is moistened by a spray of an alcoholic solution of shellac. But, of course,
  a quantity of the finer and more minute particles of the broken hairs miss
  the cone and float about in the air. The air of the factory is thus charged
  with the dust of broken rabbit hairs; and this dust settles on and penetrates
  the clothing of the workers. But when clothing becomes charged with dust,
  that dust tends to accumulate in the pockets and find its way into the
  hollows and interstices of any object carried in those pockets. Thus, if one
  of the five watches was Baxfield's it would almost certainly show traces
  where this characteristic dust had crept under the bezel and settled on the
  dial. And so it turned out to be. When I inspected those five watches through
  the Coddington lens, on the dial of No. 3 I saw a quantity of dust of this
  character. The electrified vulcanite rod picked it all up neatly and
  transferred it to the slide, and under the microscope its nature was obvious.
  The owner of this watch was therefore, almost certainly, employed in a felt
  hat factory. But, of course, it was necessary to show not only the presence
  of rabbit hair in this watch but its absence in the others and in Fletcher's
  pockets; which I did.</p>

  <p>"Then with regard to Harewood's watch. There was no rabbit hair on the
  dial, but there was a small quantity on the fluff from the key barrel. Now,
  if that rabbit hair had come from Harewood's pocket it would have been
  uniformly distributed through the fluff. But it was not. It was confined
  exclusively to the part of the fluff that was exposed. Thus it had come from
  some pocket other than Harewood's and the owner of that pocket was almost
  certainly employed in a felt hat factory, and was most probably the owner of
  watch No. 3. Then there was the cigarette-tube. Its bore was loaded with
  rabbit hair. But its owner had unquestionably been at the scene of the crime.
  There was a clear suggestion that his was the pocket in which the stolen
  watch had been carried and that he was the owner of watch No. 3. The problem
  was to piece this evidence together and prove definitely who this person was.
  And that I was able to do by means of a fresh item of evidence, which I
  acquired when I saw Baxfield at the inquest. I suppose you noticed his
  boots?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I didn't," I had to admit.</p>

  <p>"Well, I did. I watched his feet constantly, and when he crossed his legs
  I could see that he had iron toe-tips on his boots. That was what gave me
  confidence to push the cross-examination."</p>

  <p>"It was certainly a rather daring cross-examination and rather irregular,
  too," said I.</p>

  <p>"It was extremely irregular," Thorndyke agreed. "The coroner ought not to
  have permitted it. But it was all for the best. If the coroner had disallowed
  my questions we should have had to take criminal proceedings against
  Baxfield, whereas now that we have recovered the will, it is possible that no
  one will trouble to prosecute him."</p>

  <p>Which, I subsequently ascertained, is what actually happened.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="c5"
     id="c5"></a>V. &mdash; A FISHER OF MEN</h2>

  <p>"The man," observed Thorndyke, "who would successfully practise the
  scientific detection of crime must take all knowledge for his province. There
  is no single fact which may not, in particular circumstances, acquire a high
  degree of evidential value; and in such circumstances success or failure is
  determined by the possession or non-possession of the knowledge wherewith to
  interpret the significance of that fact."</p>

  <p>This obiter dictum was thrown off apropos of our investigation of the case
  rather magniloquently referred to in the press as "The Blue Diamond Mystery;"
  and more particularly of an incident which occurred in the office of our old
  friend, Superintendent Miller, at Scotland Yard. Thorndyke had called to
  verify the few facts which had been communicated to him, and having put away
  his notebook and picked up his green canvas-covered research-case, had risen
  to take his leave, when his glance fell on a couple of objects on a
  side-table&mdash;a leather handbag and a walking-stick, lashed together with
  string, to which was attached a descriptive label.</p>

  <p>He regarded them for a few moments reflectively and then glanced at the
  superintendent.</p>

  <p>"Derelicts?" he inquired, "or jetsam?"</p>

  <p>"Jetsam," the superintendent replied, "literally jetsam&mdash;thrown
  overboard to lighten the ship."</p>

  <p>Here Inspector Badger, who had been a party to the conference, looked up
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he broke in. "Perhaps the doctor wouldn't mind having a look at
  them. It's quite a nice little problem, doctor, and entirely in your
  line."</p>

  <p>"What is the problem?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"It's just this," said Badger. "Here is a bag. Now the question is, whose
  bag is it? What sort of person is the owner? Where did he come from and where
  has he gone to?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled. "That seems quite simple," said he. "A cursory
  inspection ought to dispose of trivial details like those. But how did you
  come by the bag?"</p>

  <p>"The history of the derelicts," said Miller, "is this: About four o'clock
  this morning, a constable on duty in King's Road, Chelsea, saw a man walking
  on the opposite side of the road, carrying a handbag. There was nothing
  particularly suspicious in this, but still the constable thought he would
  cross and have a closer look at him. As he did so the man quickened his pace
  and, of course, the constable quickened his. Then the man broke into a run,
  and so did the constable, and a fine, stern chase started. Suddenly the man
  shot down a by-street, and as the constable turned the corner he saw his
  quarry turn into a sort of alley. Following him into this, and gaining on him
  perceptibly, he saw that the alley ended in a rather high wall. When the
  fugitive reached the wall he dropped his bag and stick and went over like a
  harlequin. The constable went over after him, but not like a
  harlequin&mdash;he wasn't dressed for the part. By the time he got over, into
  a large garden with a lot of fruit trees in it, my nabs had disappeared. He
  traced him by his footprints across the garden to another wall, and when he
  climbed over that he found himself in by-street. But there was no sign of our
  agile friend. The constable ran up and down the street to the next crossings,
  blowing his whistle, but of course it was no go. So he went back across the
  garden and secured the bag and stick, which were at once sent here for
  examination."</p>

  <p>"And no arrest has been made?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Miller with a faint grin, "a constable in Oakley Street
  who had heard the whistle arrested a man who was carrying a
  suspicious-looking object. But he turned out to be a cornet player coming
  home from the theatre."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Thorndyke. "And now let us have a look at the bag, which I
  take it has already been examined?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we've been through it," replied Miller, "but everything has been put
  back as we found it."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke picked up the bag and proceeded to make a systematic inspection
  of its exterior.</p>

  <p>"A good bag," he commented; "quite an expensive one originally, though it
  has seen a good deal of service. You noticed the muddy marks on the
  bottom?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miller. "Those were probably made when he dropped the bag to
  jump over the wall."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," said Thorndyke, "though they don't look like street mud. But
  we shall probably get more information from the contents." He opened the bag,
  and after a glance at its interior, spread out on the table a couple of
  sheets of foolscap from the stationery rack, on which he began methodically
  to deposit the contents of the bag, accompanying the process with a sort of
  running commentary on their obvious characteristics.</p>

  <p>"Item one: a small leather dressing-wallet. Rather shabby, but originally
  of excellent quality. It contains two Swedish razors, a little Washita hone,
  a diminutive strop, a folding shaving-brush, which is slightly damp to the
  fingers and has a scent similar to that of the stick of shaving soap. You
  notice that the hone is distinctly concave in the middle and that the
  inscription on the razors, 'Arensburg, Eskilstuna, Sweden,' is partly ground
  away. Then there is a box containing a very dry cake of soap, a little
  manicure set, a well-worn toothbrush, a nailbrush, dental-brush, button-hook,
  corn-razor, a small clothesbrush and a pair of small hairbrushes. It seems to
  me, Badger, that this wallet suggests&mdash;mind, I only say
  'suggests'&mdash;a pretty complete answer to one of your questions."</p>

  <p>"I don't see how," said the inspector. "Tell me what it suggests to
  you."</p>

  <p>"It suggests to me," replied Thorndyke, laying down the lens through which
  he had been inspecting the hair-brushes, "a middle-aged or elderly man with a
  shaven upper lip and a beard; a well-preserved, healthy man, neat, orderly,
  provident and careful as to his appearance; a man long habituated to
  travelling, and&mdash;though I don't insist on this, but the appearances
  suggest that he had been living for some time in a particular households and
  that at the time when he lost the bag, he was changing his residence."</p>

  <p>"He was that," cackled the inspector, "if the constable's account of the
  way he went over that wall is to be trusted. But still, I don't see how you
  have arrived at all those facts."</p>

  <p>"Not facts, Badger," Thorndyke corrected. "I said suggestions. And those
  suggestions may be quite misleading. There may be some factor, such as change
  of ownership of the wallet, which we have not allowed for. But, taking the
  appearances at their face value, that is what they suggest. There is the
  wallet itself, for instance&mdash;strong, durable, but shabby with years of
  wear. And observe that it is a travelling-wallet and would be subjected to
  wear only during travel. Then further, as to the time factor, there are the
  hone and the razors. It takes a good many years to wear a Washita hone hollow
  or to wear away the blade of a Swedish razor until the maker's mark is
  encroached on. The state of health, and to some extent the age, are suggested
  by the tooth brush and the dental-brush. He has lost some teeth, since he
  wears a plate, but not many; and he is free from pyorrhoea and alveolar
  absorption. You don't wear a toothbrush down like this on half a dozen
  rickety survivors. But a man whose teeth will bear hard brushing is probably
  well-preserved and healthy."</p>

  <p>"You say that he shaves his upper lip but wears a beard," said the
  inspector. "How do you arrive at that?"</p>

  <p>"It is fairly obvious," replied Thorndyke. "We see that he has razors and
  uses them, and we also see that he has a beard."</p>

  <p>"Do we?" exclaimed Badger. "How do we?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke delicately picked a hair from one of the hairbrushes and held it
  up. "That is not a scalp hair," said he. "I should say that it came from the
  side of the chin."</p>

  <p>Badger regarded the hair with evident disfavour. "Looks to me," he
  remarked, "as if a small tooth-comb might have been useful."</p>

  <p>"It does," Thorndyke agreed, "but the appearance is deceptive. This is
  what is called a moniliform hair&mdash;like a string of beads. But the
  bead-like swellings are really parts of the hair. It is a diseased, or
  perhaps we should say an abnormal, condition." He handed me the hair together
  with his lens, through which I examined it and easily recognised the
  characteristic swellings.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I, "it is an early case of tricliorrexis nodosa."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" murmured the inspector. "Sounds like a Russian nobleman. Is
  it a common complaint?</p>

  <p>"It is not a rare disease&mdash;if you can call it a disease," I replied,
  "but it is a rare condition, taking the population as a whole."</p>

  <p>"It is rather a remarkable coincidence that it should happen to occur in
  this particular case," the superintendent observed.</p>

  <p>"My dear Miller," exclaimed Thorndyke, "surely your experience must have
  impressed on you the astonishing frequency of the unusual and the utter
  failure of the mathematical laws of probability in practice. Believe me,
  Miller, the bread-and-butterfly was right. It is the exceptional that always
  happens."</p>

  <p>Having discharged this paradox, he once more dived into the bag, and this
  time handed out a singular and rather unsavoury-looking parcel, the outer
  investment of which was formed by what looked like an excessively dirty
  towel, but which, as Thorndyke delicately unrolled it, was seen to be only
  half a towel which was supplemented by a still dirtier and excessively ragged
  coloured handkerchief. This, too, being opened out, disclosed an extremely
  soiled and rather frayed collar (which, like the other articles, bore no name
  or mark), and a mass of grass, evidently used as packing material.</p>

  <p>The inspector picked up the collar and quoted reflectively, "He is a man,
  neat, orderly and careful as to his appearance," after which he dropped the
  collar and ostentatiously wiped his fingers.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled grimly but refrained from repartee as he carefully
  separated the grass from the contained objects, which turned out to be a
  small telescopic jemmy, a jointed auger, a screwdriver and a bunch of
  skeleton keys.</p>

  <p>"One understands his unwillingness to encounter the constable with these
  rather significant objects in his possession," Thorndyke remarked. "They
  would have been difficult to explain away." He took up the heap of grass
  between his hands and gently compressed it to test its freshness. As he did
  so a tiny, cigar-shaped object dropped on the paper.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" asked the superintendent. "It looks like a chrysalis."</p>

  <p>"It isn't," said Thorndyke. "It is a shell, a species of Clausilia, I
  think." He picked up the little shell and closely examined its mouth through
  his lens. "Yes," he continued, "it is a Clausilia. Do you study our British
  mollusca, Badger?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," the inspector replied with emphasis.</p>

  <p>"Pity," murmured Thorndyke. "If you did, you would be interested to learn
  that the name of this little shell is Clausilia biplicata."</p>

  <p>"I don't care what its beastly name is," said Badger. "I want to know
  whose bag this is; what the owner is like; and where he came from and where
  he has gone to. Can you tell us that?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke regarded the inspector with wooden gravity. "It is all very
  obvious," said he, "very obvious. But still, I think I should like to fill in
  a few details before making a definite statement. Yes, I think I will reserve
  my judgment until I have considered the matter a little further."</p>

  <p>The inspector received this statement with a dubious grin. He was in
  somewhat of a dilemma. My colleague was addicted to a certain dry
  facetiousness, and was probably pulling the inspector's leg. But, on the
  other hand, I knew, and so did both the detectives, that it was perfectly
  conceivable that he had actually solved Badger's problem, impossible as it
  seemed, and was holding back his knowledge until he had seen whither it
  led.</p>

  <p>"Shall we take a glance at the stick?" said he, picking it up as he spoke
  and running his eye over its not very distinctive features. It was a common
  ash stick, with a crooked handle polished and darkened by prolonged contact
  with an apparently ungloved hand, and it was smeared for about three inches
  from the tip with a yellowish mud. The iron shoe of the ferrule was
  completely worn away and the deficiency had been made good by driving a steel
  boot-stud into the exposed end.</p>

  <p>"A thrifty gentleman, this," Thorndyke remarked, pointing to the stud as
  he measured the diameter of the ferrule with his pocket calliper-gauge.
  "Twenty-three thirty-seconds is the diameter," he added, looking gravely at
  the inspector. "You had better make a note of that, Badger."</p>

  <p>The inspector smiled sourly as Thorndyke laid down the stick, and once
  more picking up the little green canvas case that contained his research
  outfit, prepared to depart.</p>

  <p>"You will hear from us, Miller," he said, "if we pick up anything that
  will be useful to you. And now, Jervis, we must really take ourselves
  off."</p>

  <p>As the tinkling hansom bore us down Whitehall towards Waterloo, I
  remarked, "Badger half suspects you of having withheld from him some valuable
  information in respect of that bag."</p>

  <p>"He does," Thorndyke agreed with a mischievous smile; "and he doesn't in
  the least suspect me of having given him a most illuminating hint."</p>

  <p>"But did you?" I asked, rapidly reviewing the conversation and deciding
  that the facts elicited from the dressing-wallet could hardly be described as
  hints.</p>

  <p>"My learned friend," he replied, "is pleased to counterfeit obtuseness. It
  won't do, Jervis. I've known you too long."</p>

  <p>I grinned with vexation. Evidently I had missed the point of a subtle
  demonstration, and I knew that it was useless to ask further questions; and
  for the remainder of our journey, in the cab I struggled vainly to recover
  the "illuminating hint" that the detectives&mdash;and I&mdash;had failed to
  note. Indeed, so preoccupied was I with this problem that I rather overlooked
  the fact that the jettisoned bag was really no concern of ours, and that we
  were actually engaged in the investigation of a crime of which, at present, I
  knew practically nothing. It was not until we had secured an empty
  compartment and the train had begun to move that this suddenly dawned on me;
  whereupon I dismissed the bag problem and applied to Thorndyke for details of
  the "Brentford Train Mystery."</p>

  <p>"To call it a mystery," said he, "is a misuse of words. It appears to be a
  simple train robbery. The identity of the robber is unknown, but there is
  nothing very mysterious in that; and the crime otherwise is quite
  commonplace. The circumstances are these:</p>

  <p>"Some time ago, Mr. Lionel Montague, of the firm, Lyons, Montague &amp;
  Salaman, art dealers, bought from a Russian nobleman a very valuable diamond
  necklace and pendant. The peculiarity of this necklace was that the stones
  were all of a pale blue colour and pretty accurately matched, so that in
  addition to the aggregate value of the stones&mdash;which were all of large
  size and some very large&mdash;was the value of the piece as a whole due to
  this uniformity of colour. Mr. Montague gave £70,000 for it, and considered
  that he had made an excellent bargain. I should mention that Montague was the
  chief buyer for the firm, and that he spent most of his time travelling about
  the Continent in search of works of art and other objects suitable for the
  purposes of his firm, and that, naturally, he was an excellent judge of such
  things. Now, it seems that he was not satisfied with the settings of this
  necklace, and as soon as he had purchased it he handed it over to Messrs.
  Binks, of Old Bond Street, to have the settings replaced by others of better
  design. Yesterday morning he was notified by Binks that the resetting was
  completed, and in the afternoon he called to inspect the work and take the
  necklace away if it was satisfactory. The interview between Binks and
  Montague took place in a room behind the shop, but it appears that Montague
  came out into the shop to get a better light for his inspection and Mr. Binks
  states that as his customer stood facing the door, examining the new
  settings, he, Binks, noticed a man standing by the doorway furtively watching
  Mr. Montague."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing very remarkable in that," said I. "If a man stands at a
  shop door with a necklace of blue diamonds in his hand, he is rather likely
  to attract attention."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed. "But the significance of an antecedent is apt to
  be more appreciated after the consequences have developed. Binks is now very
  emphatic about the furtive watcher. However, to continue: Mr. Montague, being
  satisfied with the new settings, replaced the necklace in its case, put the
  latter into his bag&mdash;which he had brought with him from the inner
  room&mdash;and a minute or so later left the shop. That was about 5 p.m.; and
  he seems to have gone direct to the flat of his partner, Mr. Salaman, with
  whom he had been staying for a fortnight, at Queen's Gate. There he remained
  until about half-past eight, when he came out accompanied by Mr. Salaman. The
  latter carried a small suit-case, while Montague carried a handbag in which
  was the necklace. It is not known whether it contained anything else.</p>

  <p>"From Queen's Gate the two men proceeded to Waterloo, walking part of the
  way and covering the remainder by omnibus."</p>

  <p>"By omnibus!" I exclaimed, "with seventy thousand pounds of diamonds about
  them!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it sounds odd. But people who habitually handle portable property of
  great value seem to resemble those who habitually handle explosives. They
  gradually become unconscious of the risks. At any rate, that is how they
  went, and they arrived safely at Waterloo in time to catch the 9.15 train for
  Isleworth. Mr. Salaman saw his partner established in an empty first-class
  compartment and stayed with him, chatting, until the train started.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Montague's destination was Isleworth, in which rather unlikely
  neighbourhood Mr. Jacob Lowenstein, late of Chicago, and now of Berkeley
  Square, has a sort of river-side villa with a motor boat-house attached.
  Lowenstein had secured the option of purchasing the blue diamond necklace,
  and Montague was taking it down to exhibit it and carry out the deal. He was
  proposing to stay a few days with Lowenstein, and then he was proceeding to
  Brussels on one of his periodic tours. But he never reached Isleworth. When
  the train stopped at Brentford, a porter noticed a suit-case on the
  luggage-rack of an apparently empty first-class compartment. He immediately
  entered to take possession of it, and was in the act of reaching up to the
  rack when his foot came in contact with something soft under the seat.
  Considerably startled, he stooped and peered under, when, to his horror, he
  perceived the body of a man, quite motionless and apparently dead. Instantly
  he darted out and rushed up the platform in a state of wild panic until he,
  fortunately, ran against the station master, with whom and another porter he
  returned to the compartment. When they drew the body out from under the seat
  it was found to be still breathing, and they proceeded at once to apply such
  restoratives as cold water and fresh air, pending the arrival of the police
  and the doctor, who had been sent for.</p>

  <p>"In a few minutes the police arrived accompanied by the police surgeon,
  and the latter, after a brief examination, decided that the unconscious man
  was suffering from the effects of a large dose of chloroform, violently and
  unskilfully administered, and ordered him to be carefully removed to a local
  nursing home. Meanwhile, the police had been able, by inspecting the contents
  of his pockets, to identify him as Mr. Lionel Montague."</p>

  <p>"The diamonds had vanished, of course?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The handbag was not in the compartment, and later an empty handbag
  was picked up on the permanent way between Barnes and Chiswick, which seems
  to indicate the locality where the robbery took place."</p>

  <p>"And what is our present objective?"</p>

  <p>"We are going, on instructions from Mr. Salaman, to the nursing home to
  see what information we can pick up. If Montague has recovered sufficiently
  to give an account of the robbery, the police will have a description of the
  robber, and there may not be much for us to do. But you will have noticed
  that they do not seem to have any information at Scotland Yard at present,
  beyond what I have given you. So there is a chance yet that we may earn our
  fees."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's narrative of this somewhat commonplace crime, with the
  discussion which followed it, occupied us until the train stopped at
  Brentford Station. A few minutes later we halted in one of the quiet
  by-streets of this old-world town, at a soberly painted door on which was a
  brass plate inscribed "St. Agnes Nursing Home." Our arrival had apparently
  been observed, for the door was opened by a middle-aged lady in a nurse's
  uniform.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Thorndyke?" she inquired; and as my colleague bowed assent she
  continued: "Mr. Salaman told me you would probably call. I am afraid I
  haven't very good news for you. The patient is still quite unconscious."</p>

  <p>"That is rather remarkable," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"It is. Dr. Kingston, who is in charge of the case, is somewhat puzzled by
  this prolonged stupor. He is inclined to suspect a narcotic&mdash;possibly a
  large dose of morphine&mdash;in addition to the effects of the chloroform and
  the shock."</p>

  <p>"He is probably right," said I; "and the marvel is that the man is alive
  at all after such outrageous treatment."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed. "He must be pretty tough. Shall we be able to see
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," the matron replied. "I am instructed to give you every
  assistance. Dr. Kingston would like to have your opinion on the case."</p>

  <p>With this she conducted us to a pleasant room on the first floor, where,
  in a bed placed opposite a large window&mdash;left uncurtained&mdash;with the
  strong light falling full on his face, a man lay with closed eyes, breathing
  quietly and showing no sign of consciousness when we somewhat noisily entered
  the room. For some time Thorndyke stood by the bedside, looking down at the
  unconscious man, listening to the breathing and noting its frequency by his
  watch. Then he felt the pulse, and raising both eyelids, compared the two
  pupils.</p>

  <p>"His condition doesn't appear alarming," was his conclusion. "The
  breathing is rather shallow, but it is quite regular, and the pulse is not
  bad though slow. The contracted pupils strongly suggest opium, or more
  probably morphine. But that could easily be settled by a chemical test. Do
  you notice the state of the face, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>"You mean the chloroform burns? Yes, the handkerchief or pad must have
  been saturated. But I was also noticing that he corresponds quite remarkably
  with the description you were giving Badger of the owner of the
  dressing-wallet. He is about the age you mentioned&mdash;roughly about
  fifty&mdash;and he has the same old- fashioned treatment of the beard, the
  shaven upper lip and the monkey-fringe under the chin. It is rather an odd
  coincidence."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at me keenly. "The coincidence is closer than that,
  Jervis. Look at the beard itself."</p>

  <p>He handed me his lens, and, stooping down, I brought it to bear on the
  patient's beard. And then I started back in astonishment; for by the bright
  light I could see plainly that a considerable proportion of the hairs were
  distinctly moniliform. This man's beard, too, was affected by an early stage
  of trichorrexis nodosa!</p>

  <p>"Well!" I exclaimed, "this is really an amazing coincidence. I wonder if
  it is anything more."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Thorndyke. "Are those Mr. Montague's things, Matron?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, turning to the side table on which the patient's
  effects were neatly arranged. "Those are his clothes and the things which
  were taken from his pockets, and that is his bag. It was found on the line
  and sent on here a couple of hours ago. There is nothing in it."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked over the various objects&mdash;keys, card-case,
  pocket-book, etc.&mdash;that had been turned out of the patient's pockets,
  and then picked up the bag, which he turned over curiously and then opened to
  inspect the interior. There was nothing distinctive about it. It was just a
  plain, imitation leather bag, fairly new, though rather the worse for its
  late vicissitudes, lined with coarse linen to which two large, wash-leather
  pockets had been roughly stitched. As he laid the bag down and picked up his
  own canvas case, he asked: "What time did Mr. Salaman come to see the
  patient?"</p>

  <p>"He came here about ten o'clock this morning, and he was not able to stay
  more than half an hour as he had an appointment. But he said he would look in
  again this evening. You can't stay to see him, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not," Thorndyke replied; "in fact we must be off now, for both
  Dr. Jervis and I have some other matters to attend to."</p>

  <p>"Are you going straight back to the chambers, Jervis?" Thorndyke asked, as
  we walked down the main street towards the station.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied in some surprise. "Aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"No. I have a little expedition in view."</p>

  <p>"Oh, have you?" I exclaimed, and as I spoke it began to dawn on me that I
  had overestimated the importance of my other business.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke "the fact is that&mdash;ha! excuse me one moment,
  Jervis." He had halted abruptly outside a fishing-tackle shop and now, after
  a brief glance in through the window, entered with an air of business. I
  immediately bolted in after him, and was just in time to hear him demand a
  fishing-rod of a light and inexpensive character. When this had been supplied
  he asked for a line and one or two hooks; and I was a little
  surprised&mdash;and the vendor was positively scandalised&mdash;at his
  indifference to the quality or character of these appliances. I believe he
  would have accepted cod-line and a shark-hook if they had been offered.</p>

  <p>"And now I want a float," said he.</p>

  <p>The shopkeeper produced a tray containing a varied assortment of floats
  over which Thorndyke ran a critical eye, and finally reduced the shopman to
  stupefaction by selecting a gigantic, pot-bellied scarlet-and-green atrocity
  that looked like a juvenile telegraph buoy.</p>

  <p>I could not let this outrage pass without comment. "You must excuse me,
  Thorndyke," I said, "if I venture to point out that the Greenland whale no
  longer frequents the upper reaches of the Thames."</p>

  <p>"You mind your own business," he retorted, stolidly pocketing the
  telegraph buoy when he had paid for his purchases. "I like a float that you
  can see."</p>

  <p>Here the shopman, recovering somewhat from the shock of surprise, remarked
  deferentially that it was a long time since a really large pike had been
  caught in the neighbourhood; whereupon Thorndyke finished him off by
  replying: "Yes, I've no doubt. They don't use the right sort of floats, you
  know. Now, when the pike see my float, they will just come tumbling over one
  another to get on the hook." With this he tucked the rod under his arm and
  strolled out, leaving the shopman breathing hard and staring harder.</p>

  <p>"But what on earth," I asked, as we walked down the street (watched by the
  shopman who had come out on the pavement to see the last of us), "do you want
  with such an enormous float? Why, it will be visible a quarter of a mile
  away."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Thorndyke. "And what more could a fisher of men
  require?"</p>

  <p>This rejoinder gave me pause. Evidently Thorndyke had something in hand of
  more than common interest; and again it occurred to me that my own business
  engagements were of no special urgency. I was about to mention this fact when
  Thorndyke again halted&mdash;at an oilshop this time.</p>

  <p>"I think I will step in here and get a little burnt umber," said he.</p>

  <p>I followed him into the shop, and while the powder-colour was being
  weighed and made up into a little packet I reflected profoundly.
  Fishing-tackle and burnt umber had no obvious associations. I began to be
  mystified and correspondingly inquisitive.</p>

  <p>"What do you want the burnt umber for?" I asked as soon as we were
  outside.</p>

  <p>"To mix with plaster," he replied readily.</p>

  <p>"But why do you want to colour the plaster? And what are you going to do
  with it?"</p>

  <p>"Now, Jervis," he admonished with mock severity, "you are not doing
  yourself justice. An investigator of your experience shouldn't ask for
  explanations of the obvious."</p>

  <p>"And why," I continued, "did you want to know if I was going straight back
  to the chambers?</p>

  <p>"Because I may want some assistance later. Probably Polton will be able to
  do all that I want, but I wished to know that you would both be within reach
  of a telegram."</p>

  <p>"But," I exclaimed, "what nonsense it is to talk of sending a telegram to
  me when I'm here!"</p>

  <p>"But I may not want any assistance, after all."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said doggedly, "you are going to have it whether you want it or
  not. You've got something on and I'm going to be in it."</p>

  <p>"I like your enthusiasm, Jervis," he chuckled; "but it is quite possible
  that I shall merely find a mare's nest."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said I. "Then I'll help you to find it. I've had plenty of
  experience in that line, to say nothing of my natural gifts. So lead on."</p>

  <p>He led on, with a resigned smile, to the station, where we were fortunate
  enough to find a train just ready to start. But our journey was not a long
  one, for at Chiswick Thorndyke got out of the train, and on leaving the
  station struck out eastward with a very evident air of business. As we
  entered the outskirts of Hammersmith he turned into a by-street which
  presently brought us out into Bridge Road. Here he turned sharply to the
  right and, at the same brisk pace, crossed Hammersmith Bridge and made his
  way to the towing path. As he now slowed down perceptibly, I ventured to
  inquire whether this was the spot on which he proposed to exhibit his
  super-float.</p>

  <p>"This, I think, will be our fishing-ground," he replied; "but we will look
  over it carefully and select a suitable pitch."</p>

  <p>He continued to advance at an easy pace, and I noticed that, according to
  his constant habit, he was studying the peculiarities of the various feet
  that had trodden the path within the last day or two, keeping, for this
  purpose on the right-hand side, where the shade of a few pollard willows
  overhanging an indistinct dry ditch had kept the ground soft. We had walked
  on for nearly half a mile when he halted and looked round.</p>

  <p>"I think we had better turn back a little way," said he. "We seem to have
  overshot our mark."</p>

  <p>I made no comment on this rather mysterious observation, and we retraced
  our steps for a couple of hundred yards, Thorndyke still walking on the side
  farthest from the river and still keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.
  Presently he again halted, and looking up and down the path, of which we were
  at the moment the only occupants, placed the canvas case on the ground and
  unfastened its clasps.</p>

  <p>"This, I think, will be our pitch," said he.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I am going to make one or two casts. And meanwhile you had better get the
  fishing-rod fixed together so as to divert the attention of any
  passers-by."</p>

  <p>I proceeded to make ready the fishing-tackle, but at the same time kept a
  close watch on my colleague's proceedings. And very curious proceedings they
  were. First he dipped up a little water from the river in the rubber mixing
  bowl with which he mixed a bowlful of plaster, and into this he stirred a few
  pinches of burnt umber, whereby its dazzling white was changed to a muddy
  buff. Then, having looked up and down the path, he stooped and carefully
  poured the plaster into a couple of impressions of a walking-stick that were
  visible at the edge of the path and finished up by filling a deep impression
  of the same stick, at the margin of the ditch, where it had apparently been
  stuck in the soft, clayey ground.</p>

  <p>As I watched this operation, a sudden suspicion flashed into my mind.
  Dropping the fishing-rod, I walked quickly along the path until I was able to
  pick up another impression of the stick. A very brief examination of it
  confirmed my suspicion. At the centre of the little shallow pit was a
  semicircular impression&mdash;clearly that of a half-worn boot-stud.</p>

  <p>"Why!" I exclaimed, "this is the stick that we saw at Scotland Yard!"</p>

  <p>"I should expect it to be and I believe it is," said Thorndyke. "But we
  shall be better able to judge from the casts. Pick up your rod. There are two
  men coming down the path."</p>

  <p>He closed his "research-case" and drawing the fishing-line from his
  pocket, began meditatively to unwind it.</p>

  <p>"I could wish," said I, "that our appearance was more in character with
  the part of the rustic angler; and for the Lord's sake keep the float out of
  sight, or we shall collect a crowd."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed softly. "The float," said he, "was intended for Polton.
  He would have loved it. And the crowd would have been rather an
  advantage&mdash;as you will appreciate when you come to use it."</p>

  <p>The two men&mdash;builder's labourers, apparently&mdash;now passed us with
  a glance of faint interest at the fishing-tackle; and as they strolled by I
  appreciated the value of the burnt umber. If the casts bad been made of the
  snow-white plaster they would have stared conspicuously from the ground and
  these men would almost certainly have stopped to examine them and see what we
  were doing. But the tinted plaster was practically invisible.</p>

  <p>"You are a wonderful man, Thorndyke," I said, as I announced my discovery.
  "You foresee everything."</p>

  <p>He bowed his acknowledgments, and having tenderly felt one of the casts
  and ascertained that the plaster had set hard, he lifted it with infinite
  care, exhibiting a perfect facsimile of the end of the stick, on which the
  worn boot-stud was plainly visible, even to the remains of the pattern. Any
  doubt that might have remained as to the identity of the stick was removed
  when Thorndyke produced his calliper-gauge.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-three thirty-seconds was the diameter, I think," said he as he
  opened the jaws of the gauge and consulted his notes. He placed the cast
  between the jaws, and as they were gently slid into contact, the index marked
  twenty-three thirty-seconds.</p>

  <p>"Good," said Thorndyke, picking up the other two casts and establishing
  their identity with the one which we had examined. "This completes the first
  act." Dropping one cast into his case and throwing the other two into the
  river, he continued: "Now we proceed to the next and hope for a like success.
  You notice that he stuck his stick into the ground. Why do you suppose he did
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Presumably to leave his hands free."</p>

  <p>"Yes. And now let us sit down here and consider why he wanted his hands
  free. Just look around and tell me what you see."</p>

  <p>I gazed rather hopelessly at the very indistinctive surroundings and began
  a bald catalogue. "I see a shabby-looking pollard willow, an assortment of
  suburban vegetation, an obsolete tin saucepan&mdash;unserviceable&mdash;and a
  bald spot where somebody seems to have pulled up a small patch of turf."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke. "You will also notice a certain amount of dry,
  powdered earth distributed rather evenly over the bottom of the ditch. And
  your patch of turf was cut round with a large knife before it was pulled up.
  Why do you suppose it was pulled up?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "It's of no use making mere guesses."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," said he, "though the suggestion is fairly obvious when
  considered with the other appearances. Between the roots of the willow you
  notice a patch of grass that looks denser than one would expect from its
  position. I wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he reached forward with his stick and prised vigorously at
  the edge of the patch, with the result that the clump of grass lifted bodily;
  and when I picked it up and tried it on the bald spot, the nicety with which
  it fitted left no doubt as to its origin.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" I exclaimed, looking at the obviously disturbed earth between the
  roots of the willow, which the little patch of turf had covered; "the plot
  thickens. Something seems to have been either buried or dug up there; more
  probably buried."</p>

  <p>"I hope and believe that my learned friend is correct," said Thorndyke,
  opening his case to abstract a large, powerful spatula.</p>

  <p>"What do you expect to find there?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I have a faint hope of finding something wrapped in the half of a very
  dirty towel," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Then you had better find it quickly," said I, "for there is a man coming
  along the path from the Putney direction."</p>

  <p>He looked round at the distant figure, and driving the spatula into the
  loose earth stirred it up vigorously.</p>

  <p>"I can feel something," he said, digging away with powerful thrusts and
  scooping the earth out with his hands. Once more he looked round at the
  approaching stranger&mdash;who seemed now to have quickened his pace but was
  still four or five hundred yards distant. Then, thrusting his hands into the
  hole, he gave a smart pull. Slowly there came forth a package, about ten
  inches by six, enveloped in a portion of a peculiarly filthy towel and
  loosely secured with string. Thorndyke rapidly cast off the string and opened
  out the towel, disclosing a handsome morocco case with an engraved gold
  plate.</p>

  <p>I pounced on the case and, pressing the catch, raised the lid; and though
  I had expected no less, it was with something like a shock of surprise that I
  looked on the glittering row and the dazzling cluster of steely-blue
  diamonds.</p>

  <p>As I closed the casket and deposited it in the green canvas case,
  Thorndyke, after a single glance at the treasure and another along the path,
  crammed the towel into the hole and began to sweep the loose earth in on top
  of it. The approaching stranger was for the moment hidden from us by a bend
  of the path and a near clump of bushes, and Thorndyke was evidently working
  to hide all traces before he should appear. Having filled the hole, he
  carefully replaced the sod of turf and then, moving over to the little bare
  patch from whence the turf had been removed, he began swiftly to dig it
  up.</p>

  <p>"There," said he, flinging on the path a worm which he had just
  disinterred, "that will explain our activities. You had better continue the
  excavation with your pocket knife, and then proceed to the capture of the
  leviathans. I must run up to the police station and you must keep possession
  of this pitch. Don't move away from here on any account until I come back or
  send somebody to relieve you. I will hand you over the float; you'll want
  that." With a malicious smile he dropped the gaudy monstrosity on the path,
  and having wiped the spatula and replaced it in the case, picked up the
  latter and moved away towards Putney.</p>

  <p>At this moment the stranger reappeared, walking as if for a wager, and I
  began to peck up the earth with my pocket-knife.</p>

  <p>As the man approached he slowed down by degrees until he came up at
  something like a saunter. He was followed at a little distance by Thorndyke,
  who had turned as if he had changed his mind, and now passed me with the
  remark that "Perhaps Hammersmith would be better." The stranger cast a
  suspicious glance at him and then turned his attention to me.</p>

  <p>"Lookin' for worms?" he inquired, halting and surveying me
  inquisitively.</p>

  <p>I replied by picking one up (with secret distaste) and holding it aloft,
  and he continued, looking wistfully at Thorndyke's retreating figure: "Your
  pal seems to have had enough."</p>

  <p>"He hadn't got a rod," said I; "but he'll be back presently."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said he, looking steadily over my shoulder in the direction of the
  willow. "Well, you won't do any good here. The place where they rises is a
  quarter of a mile farther down&mdash;just round the bend there. That's a
  prime pitch. You just come along with me and I'll show you."</p>

  <p>"I must stay here until my friend comes back," said I. "But I'll tell him
  what you say."</p>

  <p>With this I seated myself stolidly on the bank and, having flung the
  baited hook into the stream, sat and glared fixedly at the preposterous
  float. My acquaintance fidgeted about me uneasily, endeavouring from time to
  time to lure me away to the "prime pitch" round the bend. And so the time
  dragged on until three-quarters of an hour had passed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly I observed two taxicabs crossing the bridge, followed by three
  cyclists. A minute or two later Thorndyke reappeared, accompanied by two
  other men, and then the cyclists came into view, approaching at a rapid
  pace.</p>

  <p>"Seems to be a regular procession," my friend remarked, viewing the new
  arrivals with evident uneasiness. As he spoke, one of the cyclists halted and
  dismounted to examine his tyre, while the other two approached and shot past
  us. Then they, too, halted and dismounted, and having deposited their
  machines in the ditch, they came back towards us. By this time I was
  able&mdash;with a good deal of surprise&mdash;to identify Thorndyke's two
  companions as Inspector Badger and Superintendent Miller. Perhaps my
  acquaintance also recognised them, or possibly the proceedings of the third
  cyclist&mdash;who had also laid down his machine and was approaching on
  foot&mdash;disturbed him. At any rate he glanced quickly from the one group
  to the other and, selecting the smaller one, sprang suddenly between the two
  cyclists and sped away along the path like a hare.</p>

  <p>In a moment there was a wild stampede. The three cyclists, remounting
  their machines, pedalled furiously after the fugitive, followed by Badger and
  Miller on foot. Then the fugitive, the cyclists, and finally the two officers
  disappeared round the bend of the path.</p>

  <p>"How did you know that he was the man?" I asked, when my colleague and I
  were left alone.</p>

  <p>"I didn't, though I had pretty strong grounds for suspicion. But I merely
  brought the police to set a watch on the place and arrange an ambush. Their
  encircling movement was just an experimental bluff; they might have been
  chary of arresting the fellow if he hadn't taken fright and bolted. We have
  been fortunate all round, for, by a lucky chance, Badger and Miller were at
  Chiswick making inquiries and I was able to telephone to them to meet me at
  the bridge."</p>

  <p>At this moment the procession reappeared, advancing briskly; and my late
  adviser marched at the centre securely handcuffed. As he was conducted past
  me he glared savagely and made some impolite references to a "blooming
  nark."</p>

  <p>"You can take him in one of the taxis," said Miller, "and put your
  bicycles on top." Then, as the procession moved on towards the bridge he
  turned to Thorndyke. "I suppose he's the right man, doctor, but he hasn't got
  any of the stuff on him."</p>

  <p>"Of course he hasn't," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Well, do you know where it is?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke opened his case and taking out the casket, handed it to the
  superintendent. "I shall want a receipt for it," said he.</p>

  <p>Miller opened the casket, and at the sight of the glittering jewels both
  the detectives uttered an exclamation of amazement, and the superintendent
  demanded: "Where did you get this, sir?</p>

  <p>"I dug it up at the foot of that willow."</p>

  <p>"But how did you know it was there?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't," replied Thorndyke; "but I thought I might as well look, you
  know," and he bestowed a smile of exasperating blandness on the astonished
  officer.</p>

  <p>The two detectives gazed at Thorndyke, then they looked at one another and
  then they looked at me; and Badger observed, with profound conviction, that
  it was a 'knock-out.'</p>

  <p>"I believe the doctor keeps a tame clairvoyant," he added.</p>

  <p>"And may I take it, sir," said Miller, "that you can establish a prima
  facie case against this man, so that we can get a remand until Mr. Montague
  is well enough to identify him?"</p>

  <p>"You may," Thorndyke replied. "Let me know when and where he is to be
  charged and I will attend and give evidence."</p>

  <p>On this Miller wrote out a receipt for the jewels and the two officers
  hurried off to their taxicab, leaving us, as Badger put it, "to our
  fishing."</p>

  <p>As soon as they were out of sight, Thorndyke opened his case and mixed
  another bowlful of plaster. "We want two more casts," said he; "one of the
  right foot of the man who buried the jewels and one of the right foot of the
  prisoner. They are obviously identical, as you can see by the arrangement of
  the nails and the shape of the new patch on the sole. I shall put the casts
  in evidence and compare them with the prisoner's right boot."</p>

  <p>I understood now why Thorndyke had walked away towards Putney and then
  returned in rear of the stranger. He had suspected the man and had wanted to
  get a look at his footprints. But there was a good deal in this case that I
  did not understand at all.</p>
  <hr align="center"
      width="25%">

  <p>"There," said Thorndyke, as he deposited the casts, each with its
  pencilled identification, in his canvas case, "that is the end of the Blue
  Diamond Mystery."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said I, "but it isn't. I want a full explanation. It
  is evident that from the house at Brentford you made a bee line to that
  willow. You knew then pretty exactly where the necklace was hidden. For all I
  know, you may have had that knowledge when we left Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I had," he replied. "I went to Brentford principally
  to verify the ownership of the wallet and the bag."</p>

  <p>"But what was it that directed you with such certainty to the Hammersmith
  towing-path?"</p>

  <p>It was then that he made the observation that I have quoted at the
  beginning of this narrative.</p>

  <p>"In this case," he continued, "a curious fact, well known to naturalists,
  acquired vital evidential importance. It associated a bag, found in one
  locality, with another apparently unrelated locality. It was the link that
  joined up the two ends of a broken chain. I offered that fact to Inspector
  Badger, who, lacking the knowledge wherewith to interpret it, rejected it
  with scorn."</p>

  <p>"I remember that you gave him the name of that little shell that dropped
  out of the handful of grass."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Thorndyke. "That was the crucial fact. It told us where
  the handful of grass had been gathered."</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine how," said I. "Surely you find shells all over the
  country?"</p>

  <p>"That is, in general, quite true," he replied, "but Clausilia biplicata is
  one of the rare exceptions. There are four British species of these queer
  little univalves (which are so named from the little spring door with which
  the entrance of the shell is furnished): Clausilia laminata, rolphii, rugosa
  and biplicata. The first three species have what we may call a normal
  distribution, whereas the distribution of biplicata is abnormal. This seems
  to be a dying species. It is in process of becoming extinct in this island.
  But when a species of animal or plant becomes extinct, it does not fade away
  evenly over the whole of its habitat, but it disappears in patches, which
  gradually extend, leaving, as it were, islands of survival. This is what has
  happened to Clausilia biplicata. It has disappeared from this country with
  the exception of two localities; one of these is in Wiltshire, and the other
  is the right bank of the Thames at Hammersmith. And this latter locality is
  extraordinarily restricted. Walk down a few hundred yards towards Putney, and
  you have walked out of its domain; walk up a few hundred yards towards the
  bridge, and again you have walked out of its territory. Yet within that
  little area it is fairly plentiful. If you know where to look&mdash;it lives
  on the bark or at the roots of willow trees&mdash;you can usually find one or
  two specimens. Thus, you see, the presence of that shell associated the
  handful of grass with a certain willow tree, and that willow was either in
  Wiltshire or by the Hammersmith towing-path. But there was nothing otherwise
  to connect it with Wiltshire, whereas there was something to connect it with
  Hammersmith. Let us for a moment dismiss the shell and consider the other
  suggestions offered by the bag and stick.</p>

  <p>"The bag, as you saw, contained traces of two very different persons. One
  was a middle-class man, probably middle-aged or elderly, cleanly, careful as
  to his appearance and of orderly habits; the other, uncleanly, slovenly and
  apparently a professional criminal. The bag itself seemed to appertain to the
  former person. It was an expensive bag and showed signs of years of careful
  use. This, and the circumstances in which it was found, led us to suspect
  that it was a stolen bag. Now, we knew that the contents of a bag had been
  stolen. We knew that an empty bag had been picked up on the line between
  Barnes and Chiswick, and it was probable that the thief had left the train at
  the latter station. The empty bag had been assumed to be Mr. Montague's,
  whereas the probabilities&mdash;as for instance, the fact of its having been
  thrown out on the line&mdash;suggested that it was the thief's bag, and that
  Mr. Montague's had been taken away with its contents.</p>

  <p>"The point, then, that we had to settle when we left Scotland Yard was
  whether this apparently stolen bag had any connection with the train robbery.
  But as soon as we saw Mr. Montague it was evident that he corresponded
  exactly with the owner of the dressing-wallet; and when we saw the bag that
  had been found on the line&mdash;a shoddy, imitation leather bag&mdash;it was
  practically certain that it was not his, while the roughly-stitched leather
  pockets, exactly suited to the dimensions of house-breaking tools, strongly
  suggested that it was a burglar's bag. But if this were so, then Mr.
  Montague's bag had been stolen, and the robber's effects stuffed into it.</p>

  <p>"With this working hypothesis we were now able to take up the case from
  the other end. The Scotland Yard bag was Montague's bag. It had been taken
  from Chiswick to the Hammersmith towpath, where&mdash;judging from the clay
  smears on the bottom&mdash;it had been laid on the ground, presumably close
  to a willow tree. The use of the grass as packing suggested that something
  had been removed from the bag at this place&mdash;something that had wedged
  the tools together and prevented them from rattling; and there appeared to be
  half a towel missing. Clearly, the towpath was our next field of
  exploration.</p>

  <p>"But, small as this area was geographically, it would have taken a long
  time to examine in detail. Here, however, the stick gave us invaluable aid.
  It had a perfectly distinctive tip, and it showed traces of having been stuck
  about three inches into earth similar to that on the bag. What we had thus to
  look for was a hole in the ground about three inches deep, and having at the
  bottom the impression of a half-worn boot-stud. This hole would probably be
  close to a willow.</p>

  <p>"The search turned out even easier than I had hoped. Directly we reached
  the towpath I picked up the track of the stick, and not one track only, but a
  double track, showing that our friend had returned to the bridge. All that
  remained was to follow the track until it came to an end and there we were
  pretty certain to find the hole in the ground, as, in fact, we did."</p>

  <p>"And why," I asked, "do you suppose he buried the stuff?"</p>

  <p>"Probably as a precaution, in case he had been seen and described. This
  morning's papers will have told him that he had not been. Probably, also, he
  wanted to make arrangements with a fence and didn't want to have the booty
  about him."</p>

  <p>There is little more to tell. When the case was heard on the following
  morning, Thorndyke's uncannily precise and detailed description of the course
  of events, coupled with the production of the stolen property, so unnerved
  the prisoner that he pleaded guilty forthwith.</p>

  <p>As to Mr. Montague, he recovered completely in a few days, and a handsome
  pair of Georgian silver candlesticks may even to this day be seen on our
  mantelpiece testifying to his gratitude and appreciation of Thorndyke's
  brilliant conduct of the case.</p>

  <h2><a name="c6"
     id="c6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE STOLEN INGOTS</h2>

  <p>"In medico-legal practice," Thorndyke remarked, "one must be constantly on
  one's guard against the effects of suggestion, whether intentional or
  unconscious. When the facts of a case are set forth by an informant, they are
  nearly always presented, consciously or unconsciously, in terms of inference.
  Certain facts, which appear to the narrator to be the leading facts, are
  given with emphasis and in detail, while other facts, which appear to be
  subordinate or trivial, are partially suppressed. But this assessment of
  evidential value must never be accepted. The whole case must be considered
  and each fact weighed separately, and then it will commonly happen that the
  leading fact turns out to be the one that had been passed over as
  negligible."</p>

  <p>The remark was made apropos of a case, the facts of which had just been
  stated to us by Mr. Halethorpe, of the Sphinx Assurance Company. I did not
  quite perceive its bearing at the time, but looking back when the case was
  concluded, I realised that I had fallen into the very error against which
  Thorndyke's warning should have guarded me.</p>

  <p>"I trust," said Mr. Halethorpe, "that I have not come at an inconvenient
  time. You are so tolerant of unusual hours&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My practice," interrupted Thorndyke, "is my recreation, and I welcome you
  as one who comes to furnish entertainment. Draw your chair up to the fire,
  light a cigar and tell us your story."</p>

  <p>Mr. Halethorpe laughed, but adopted the procedure suggested, and having
  settled his toes upon the kerb and selected a cigar from the box, he opened
  the subject of his call.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know what you can do for us," he began, "as it is hardly
  your business to trace lost property, but I thought I would come and let you
  know about our difficulty. The fact is that our company looks like dropping
  some four thousand pounds, which the directors won't like. What has happened
  is this:</p>

  <p>"About two months ago the London House of the Akropong Gold Fields Company
  applied to us to insure a parcel of gold bars that were to be consigned to
  Minton and Borwell, the big manufacturing jewellers. The bars were to be
  shipped at Accra and landed at Bellhaven, which is the nearest port to Minton
  and Borwell's works. Well, we agreed to underwrite the risk&mdash;we have
  done business with the Akropong people before&mdash;and the matter was
  settled. The bars were put on board the Labadi at Accra, and in due course
  were landed at Belhaven, where they were delivered to Minton's agents. So
  far, so good. Then came the catastrophe. The case of bars was put on the
  train at Belhaven, consigned to Anchester, where Minton's have their factory.
  But the line doesn't go to Anchester direct. The junction is at Garbridge, a
  small country station close to the river Crouch, and here the case was put
  out and locked up in the station-master's office to wait for the Anchester
  train. It seems that the station-master was called away and detained longer
  than he had expected, and when the train was signalled he hurried back in a
  mighty twitter. However, the case was there all right, and he personally
  superintended its removal to the guard's van and put it in the guard's
  charge. All went well for the rest of the journey. A member of the firm was
  waiting at Anchester station with a closed van. The case was put into it and
  taken direct to the factory, where it was opened in the private
  office&mdash;and found to be full of lead pipe."</p>

  <p>"I presume," said Thorndyke, "that it was not the original case."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Halethorpe, "but it was a very fair imitation. The label and
  the marks were correct, but the seals were just plain wax. Evidently the
  exchange had been made in the station office, and it transpires that although
  the door was securely locked there was an unfastened window which opened on
  to the garden, and there were plain marks of feet on the flower-bed
  outside."</p>

  <p>"What time did this happen?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"The Anchester train came in at a quarter past seven, by which time, of
  course, it was quite dark."</p>

  <p>"And when did it happen?"</p>

  <p>"The day before yesterday. We heard of it yesterday morning."</p>

  <p>"Are you contesting the claim?"</p>

  <p>"We don't want to. Of course, we could plead negligence, but in that case
  I think we should make a claim on the railway company. But, naturally, we
  should much rather recover the property. After all, it can't be so very far
  away."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that," said Thorndyke. "This was no impromptu theft. The
  dummy case was prepared in advance, and evidently by somebody who knew what
  the real case was like, and how and when it was to be despatched from
  Belhaven. We must assume that the disposal of the stolen case has been
  provided for with similar completeness. How far is Garbridge from the
  river?"</p>

  <p>"Less than half a mile across the marshes. The
  detective-inspector&mdash;Badger, I think you know him&mdash;asked the same
  question."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Thorndyke. "A heavy object like this case is much more
  easily and inconspicuously conveyed by water than on land. And then, see what
  facilities for concealment a navigable river offers. The case could be easily
  stowed away on a small craft, or even in a boat; or the bars could be taken
  out and stowed amongst the ballast, or even, at a pinch, dropped over board
  at a marked spot and left until the hue and cry was over."</p>

  <p>"You are not very encouraging," Halethorpe remarked gloomily. "I take it
  that you don't much expect that we shall recover those bars."</p>

  <p>"We needn't despair," was the reply, "but I want you to understand the
  difficulties. The thieves have got away with the booty, and that booty is an
  imperishable material which retains its value even if broken up into
  unrecognisable fragments. Melted down into small ingots, it would be
  impossible to identify."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Halethorpe, "the police have the matter in
  hand&mdash;Inspector Badger, of the C.I.D., is in charge of the
  case&mdash;but our directors would be more satisfied if you would look into
  it. Of course we would give you any help we could. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"I am willing to look into the case," said Thorndyke, "though I don't hold
  out much hope. Could you give me a note to the shipping company and another
  to the consignees, Minton and Borwell?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I will. I'll write them now. I have some of our stationery in
  my attaché case. But, if you will pardon my saying so, you seem to be
  starting your inquiry just where there is nothing to be learned. The case was
  stolen after it left the ship and before it reached the
  consignees&mdash;although their agent had received it from the ship."</p>

  <p>"The point is," said Thorndyke, "that this was a preconcerted robbery, and
  that the thieves possessed special information. That information must have
  come either from the ship or from the factory. So, while we must try to pick
  up the track of the case itself, we must seek the beginning of the clue at
  the two ends&mdash;the ship and the factory one of which it must have
  started."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's true," said Halethorpe. "Well, I'll write those two notes and
  then I must run away; and we'll hope for the best."</p>

  <p>He wrote the two letters asking for facilities from the respective
  parties, and then took his departure in a somewhat chastened frame of
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Quite an interesting little problem," Thorndyke remarked, as Halethorpe
  footsteps died away on the stairs, "but not much in our line. It is really a
  police case&mdash;a case for patient and intelligent inquiry. And that is
  what we shall have to do&mdash;make some careful inquiries on the spot."</p>

  <p>"Where do you propose to begin?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"At the beginning," he replied. "Belhaven. I propose that we go down there
  to-morrow morning and pick up the thread at that end."</p>

  <p>"What thread?" I demanded. "We know that the package started from there.
  What else do you expect to learn?"</p>

  <p>"There are several curious possibilities in this case, as you must have
  noticed," he replied "The question is, whether any of them are probabilities.
  That is what I want to settle before we begin a detailed investigation."</p>

  <p>"For my part," said I, "I should have supposed that the investigation
  would start from the scene of the robbery. But I presume that you have seen
  some possibilities that I have overlooked."</p>

  <p>Which eventually turned out to be the case.</p>

  <p><br>
  "I think," said Thorndyke as we alighted at Belhaven on the following
  morning, "we had better go first to the Customs and make quite certain, if we
  can, that the bars were really in the case when it was delivered to the
  consignees' agents. It won't do to take it for granted that the substitution
  took place at Garbridge, although that is by far the most probable theory."
  Accordingly we made our way to the harbour, where an obliging mariner
  directed us to our destination.</p>

  <p>At the Custom House we were received by a genial officer, who, when
  Thorndyke had explained his connection with the robbery, entered into the
  matter with complete sympathy and a quick grasp of the situation.</p>

  <p>"I see," said he. "You want clear evidence that the bars were in the case
  when it left here. Well, I think we can satisfy you on that point. Bullion is
  not a customable commodity, but it has to be examined and reported. If it is
  consigned to the Bank of England or the Mint, the case is passed through with
  the seals unbroken, but as this was a private consignment, the seals will
  have been broken and the contents of the case examined. Jeffson, show these
  gentlemen the report on the case of gold bars from the Labadi."</p>

  <p>"Would it be possible," Thorndyke asked, "for us to have a few words with
  the officer who opened the case? You know the legal partiality for personal
  testimony."</p>

  <p>"Of course it would. Jeffson, when these gentlemen have seen the report,
  find the officer who signed it and let them have a talk with him."</p>

  <p>We followed Mr. Jeffson into an adjoining office, where he produced the
  report and handed it to Thorndyke. The particulars that it gave were in
  effect those that would be furnished by the ship's manifest and the bill of
  lading. The case was thirteen inches long by twelve wide and nine inches
  deep, outside measurement; and its gross weight was one hundred and seventeen
  pounds three ounces, and it contained four bars of the aggregate weight of
  one hundred and thirteen pounds two ounces.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Thorndyke, handing back the report. "And now can we see
  the officer&mdash;Mr. Byrne, I think&mdash;just to fill in the details?"</p>

  <p>"If you will come with me," replied Mr. Jeffson, "I'll find him for you. I
  expect he is on the wharf."</p>

  <p>We followed our conductor out on to the quay among a litter of cases,
  crates and barrels, and eventually, amidst a battalion of Madeira wine casks,
  found the officer deep in problems of "content and ullage," and other customs
  mysteries. As Jeffson introduced us, and then discreetly retired, Mr. Byrne
  confronted us, with a mahogany face and truculent blue eye.</p>

  <p>"With reference to this bullion," said Thorndyke, "I understand that you
  weighed the bars separately from the case?"</p>

  <p>"Oi did," replied Mr. Byrne.</p>

  <p>"Did you weigh each bar separately?"</p>

  <p>"Oi did not," was the concise reply.</p>

  <p>"What was the appearance of the bars&mdash;I mean as to shape and size?
  Were they of the usual type?</p>

  <p>"Oi've not had a great deal to do with bullion," said Mr. Byrne, "but Oi
  should say that they were just ordinary gold bars, about nine inches long by
  four wide and about two inches deep."</p>

  <p>"Was there much packing material in the case?"</p>

  <p>"Very little. The bars were wrapped in thick canvas and jammed into the
  case. There wouldn't be more than about half an inch clearance all round to
  allow for the canvas. The case was inch and half stuff strengthened with iron
  bands."</p>

  <p>"Did you seal the case after you had closed it up?"</p>

  <p>"Oi did. 'Twas all shipshape when it was passed back to the mate. And Oi
  saw him hand it over to the consignees' agent; so 'twas all in order when it
  left the wharf."</p>

  <p>"That was what I wanted to make sure of," said Thorndyke; and, having
  pocketed his notebook and thanked the officer, he turned away among the
  wilderness of merchandise.</p>

  <p>"So much for the Customs," said he. "I am glad we went there first. As you
  have no doubt observed, we have picked up some useful information."</p>

  <p>"We have ascertained," I replied, "that the case was intact when it was
  handed over to the consignees' agents, so that our investigations at
  Garbridge will start from a solid basis. And that, I take it, is all you
  wanted to know."</p>

  <p>"Not quite all," he rejoined. "There are one or two little details that I
  should like to fill in. I think we will look in on the shipping agents and
  present Halethorpe's note. We may as well learn all we can before we make our
  start from the scene of the robbery."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "I don't see what more there is to learn here. But
  apparently you do. That seems to be the office, past those sheds."</p>

  <p>The manager of the shipping agent's office looked us up and down as he sat
  at his littered desk with Halethorpe's letter in his hand.</p>

  <p>"You've come about that bullion that was stolen," he said brusquely.
  "Well, it wasn't stolen here. Hadn't you better inquire at Garbridge, where
  it was?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," replied Thorndyke. "But I am making certain preliminary
  inquiries. Now, first, as to the bill of lading, who has that&mdash;the
  original, I mean?</p>

  <p>"The captain has it at present, but I have a copy."</p>

  <p>"Could I see it?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>The manager raised his eyebrows protestingly, but produced the document
  from a file and handed it to Thorndyke, watching him inquisitively as he
  copied the particulars of the package into his notebook.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Thorndyke as he returned the document, "you have a copy
  of the ship's manifest?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the manager, "but the entry in the manifest is merely a
  copy of the particulars given in the bill of lading."</p>

  <p>"I should like to see the manifest, if it is not troubling you too
  much."</p>

  <p>"But," the other protested impatiently, "the manifest contains no
  information respecting this parcel of bullion excepting the one entry, which,
  as I have told you, has been copied from the bill of lading."</p>

  <p>"I realise that," said Thorndyke; "but I should like to look over it, all
  the same."</p>

  <p>Our friend bounced into an inner office and presently returned with a
  voluminous document, which he slapped down on a side-table.</p>

  <p>"There, sir," he said. "That is the manifest. This is the entry relating
  to the bullion that you are inquiring about. The rest of the document is
  concerned with the cargo, in which I presume you are not interested."</p>

  <p>In this, however, he was mistaken; for Thorndyke, having verified the
  bullion entry, turned the leaves over and began systematically, though
  rapidly, to run his eye over the long list from the beginning, a proceeding
  that the manager viewed with frenzied impatience.</p>

  <p>"If you are going to read it right through, sir," the latter observed, "I
  shall ask you to excuse me. Art is long but life is short," he added with a
  sour smile.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless he hovered about uneasily, and when Thorndyke proceeded to
  copy some of the entries into his notebook, he craned over and read them
  without the least disguise, though not without comment.</p>

  <p>"Good God, sir!" he exclaimed. "What possible bearing on this robbery can
  that parcel of scrivelloes have? And do you realise that they are still in
  the ship's hold?"</p>

  <p>"I inferred that they were, as they are consigned to London," Thorndyke
  replied, drawing his finger down the "description" column and rapidly
  scanning the entries in it. The manager watched that finger, and as it
  stopped successively at a bag of gum copal, a case of quartz specimens, a
  case of six-inch brass screw-bolts, a bag of beni-seed and a package of kola
  nuts, he breathed hard and muttered like an angry parrot. But Thorndyke was
  quite unmoved. With calm deliberation he copied out each entry,
  conscientiously noting the marks, descriptions of packages and contents,
  gross and net weights, dimensions, names of consignors and consignees, ports
  of shipment and discharge, and, in fact, the entire particulars. It was
  certainly an amazing proceeding, and I could make no more of it than could
  our impatient friend.</p>

  <p>At last Thorndyke closed and pocketed his notebook, and the manager heaved
  a slightly obtrusive sigh. "Is there nothing more, sir?" he asked. "You don't
  want to examine the ship, for instance?"</p>

  <p>The next moment, I think, he regretted his sarcasm, for Thorndyke
  inquired, with evident interest: "Is the ship still here?</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the unwilling admission. "She finishes unloading here at midday
  to-day and will probably haul into the London Docks to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I need go on board," said Thorndyke, "but you might give me
  a card in case I find that I want to."</p>

  <p>The card was somewhat grudgingly produced, and when Thorndyke had thanked
  our entertainer for his help, we took our leave and made our way towards the
  station.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "you have collected a vast amount of curious information,
  but I am hanged if I can see that any of it has the slightest bearing on our
  inquiry."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke cast on me a look of deep reproach. "Jervis!" he exclaimed, "you
  astonish me; you do, indeed. Why, my dear fellow, it stares you in the
  face!"</p>

  <p>"When you say 'it,'" I said a little irritably, "you mean&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I mean the leading fact from which we may deduce the modus operandi of
  this robbery. You shall look over my notes in the train and sort out the data
  that we have collected. I think you will find them extremely
  illuminating."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," said I. "But, meanwhile, aren't we wasting a good deal of
  time? Halethorpe wants to get the gold back; he doesn't want to know how the
  thieves contrived to steal it."</p>

  <p>"That is a very just remark," answered Thorndyke. "My learned friend
  displays his customary robust common sense. Nevertheless, I think that a
  clear understanding of the mechanism of this robbery will prove very helpful
  to us, though I agree with you that we have spent enough time on securing our
  preliminary data. The important thing now is to pick up a trail from
  Garbridge. But I see our train is signalled. We had better hurry."</p>

  <p>As the train rumbled into station, we looked out for an empty smoking
  compartment, and having been fortunate enough to secure one, we settled
  ourselves in opposite corners and lighted our pipes. Then Thorndyke handed me
  his notebook and as I studied, with wrinkled brows, the apparently
  disconnected entries, he sat and observed me thoughtfully and with the
  faintest suspicion of a smile. Again and again I read through those notes
  with ever-dwindling hopes of extracting the meaning that "stared me in the
  face." Vainly did I endeavour to connect gum copal, scrivelloes or beni-seed
  with the methods of the unknown robbers. The entries in the notebook
  persisted obstinately in remaining totally disconnected and hopelessly
  irrelevant. At last I shut the book with a savage snap and handed it back to
  its owner.</p>

  <p>"It's no use, Thorndyke," I said. "I can't see the faintest glimmer of
  light."</p>

  <p>"Well," said he, "it isn't of much consequence. The practical part of our
  task is before us, and it may turn out a pretty difficult part. But we have
  got to recover those bars if it is humanly possible. And here we are at our
  jumping-off place. This is Garbridge Station&mdash;and I see an old
  acquaintance of ours on the platform."</p>

  <p>I looked out, as the train slowed down, and there, sure enough, was no
  less a person than Inspector Badger of the Criminal Investigation
  Department.</p>

  <p>"We could have done very well without Badger," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, "but we shall have to take him into partnership,
  I expect. After all, we are on his territory and on the same errand. How do
  you do, inspector?" he continued, as the officer, having observed our descent
  from the carriage, hurried forward with unwonted cordiality.</p>

  <p>"I rather expected to see you here, sir," said he. "We heard that Mr.
  Halethorpe had consulted you. But this isn't the London train."</p>

  <p>"No," said Thorndyke. "We've been to Belhaven, just to make sure that the
  bullion was in the case when it started."</p>

  <p>"I could have told you that two days ago," said Badger. "We got on to the
  Customs people at once. That was all plain sailing; but the rest of it
  isn't."</p>

  <p>"No clue as to how the case was taken away?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes; that is pretty clear. It was hoisted out, and the dummy hoisted
  in, through the window of the Station-master's office. And the same night,
  two men were seen carrying a heavy package, about the size of the
  bullion-case, towards the marshes. But there the clue ends. The stuff seems
  to have vanished into thin air. Of course our people are on the look-out for
  it in various likely directions, but I am staying here with a couple of
  plain-clothes men. I've a conviction that it is still somewhere in this
  neighbourhood, and I mean to stick here in the hope that I may spot somebody
  trying to move it."</p>

  <p>As the inspector was speaking we had been walking slowly from the station
  towards the village, which was on the opposite side of the river. On the
  bridge Thorndyke halted and looked down the river and over the wide expanse
  of marshy country.</p>

  <p>"This is an ideal place for a bullion robbery," he remarked. "A tidal
  river near to the sea and a network of creeks, in any one of which one could
  hide a boat or sink the booty below tide-marks. Have you heard of any strange
  craft having put in here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. There's a little ramshackle bawley from Leigh&mdash;but her crew of
  two ragamuffins are not Leigh men. And they've made a mess of their
  visit&mdash;got their craft on the mud on the top of the spring tide. There
  here she'll be till next spring tide. But I've been over her carefully and
  I'll swear the stuff isn't aboard her. I had all the ballast out and emptied
  the lazarette and the chain locker."</p>

  <p>"And what about the barge?"</p>

  <p>"She's a regular trader here. Her crew&mdash;the skipper and his
  son&mdash;are quite respectable men and they belong here. There they go in
  that boat; I expect they are off on this tide. But they seem to be making for
  the bawley."</p>

  <p>As he spoke the inspector produced a pair of glasses, through which he
  watched the movement of the barge's jolly, and a couple of elderly fishermen,
  who were crossing the bridge, halted to look on. The barge's boat ran
  alongside the stranded bawley, and one of the rowers hailed; whereupon two
  men tumbled up from the cabin and dropped into the boat, which immediately
  pushed off and headed for the barge.</p>

  <p>"Them bawley blokes seems to be taking a passage along of old Bill
  Somers," one of the fishermen remarked, levelling a small telescope at the
  barge as the boat drew alongside and the four men climbed on board. "Going to
  work their passage, too," he added as the two passengers proceeded
  immediately to man the windlass while the crew let go the brails and hooked
  the main block to the traveller.</p>

  <p>"Rum go," commented Badger, glaring at the barge through his glasses; "but
  they haven't taken anything aboard with them. I could see that."</p>

  <p>"You have overhauled the barge, I suppose?" said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Went right through her. Nothing there. She's light. There was no
  place aboard her where you could hide a split-pea."</p>

  <p>"Did you get her anchor up?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Badger. "I didn't. I suppose I ought to have done so.
  However, they're getting it up themselves now." As he spoke, the rapid clink
  of a windlass-pawl was borne across the water, and through my prismatic
  glasses I could see the two passengers working for all they were worth at the
  cranks. Presently the clink of the pawl began to slow down somewhat and the
  two bargemen, having got the sails set, joined the toilers at the windlass,
  but even then there was no great increase of speed.</p>

  <p>"Anchor seems to come up uncommon heavy," one of the fishermen
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Aye," the other agreed. "Got foul of an old mooring, maybe."</p>

  <p>"Look out for the anchor, Badger," Thorndyke said in a low voice, gazing
  steadily through his binocular. "It is out of the ground. The cable is up and
  down and the barge is drifting off on the tide."</p>

  <p>Even as he spoke the ring and stock of the anchor rose slowly out of the
  water, and now I could see that a second chain was shackled loosely to the
  cable, down which it had slid until it was stopped by the ring of the anchor.
  Badger had evidently seen it too, for he ejaculated, "Hallo!" and added a few
  verbal flourishes which I need not repeat. A few more turns of the windlass
  brought the flukes of the anchor clear of the water, and dangling against
  them was an undeniable wooden case, securely slung with lashings of stout
  chain. Badger cursed volubly, and, turning to the fishermen, exclaimed in a
  rather offensively peremptory tone:</p>

  <p>"I want a boat. Now. This instant."</p>

  <p>The elder piscator regarded him doggedly and replied. "All right. I ain't
  got no objection."</p>

  <p>"Where can I get a boat?" the inspector demanded, nearly purple with
  excitement and anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Where do you think?" the mariner responded, evidently nettled by the
  inspector's masterful tone. "Pastrycook's? Or livery stables?"</p>

  <p>"Look here," said Badger. "I'm a police officer and I want to board that
  barge, and I am prepared to pay handsomely. Now where can I get a boat?"</p>

  <p>"We'll put you aboard of her," replied the fisherman, "that is, if we can
  catch her. But I doubt it. She's off, that's what she is. And there's
  something queer a-going on aboard of her," he added in a somewhat different
  tone.</p>

  <p>There was. I had been observing it. The case had been, with some
  difficulty, hoisted on board, and then suddenly there had broken out an
  altercation between the two bargees and their passengers, and this had now
  developed into what look like a free fight. It was difficult to see exactly
  what was happening, for the barge was drifting rapidly down the river, and
  her sails, blowing out first on one side and then on the other, rather
  obscured the view. Presently, however, the sails filled and a man appeared at
  the wheel; then the barge jibed round, and with a strong ebb tide and a fresh
  breeze, very soon began to grow small in the distance.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the fishermen had bustled off in search of a boat, and the
  inspector had raced to the bridge-head, where he stood gesticulating
  frantically and blowing his whistle, while Thorndyke continued placidly to
  watch the receding barge through his binocular.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do?" I asked, a little sur prised at my colleague's
  inaction.</p>

  <p>"What can we do?" he asked in reply. "Badger will follow the barge. He
  probably won't overtake her, but he will prevent her from making a landing
  until they get out into the estuary, and then he may possibly get assistance.
  The chase is in his hands."</p>

  <p>"Are we going with him?"</p>

  <p>"I am not. This looks like being an all-night expedition, and I must be at
  our chambers to-morrow morning. Besides, the chase is not our affair. But if
  you would like to join Badger there is no reason why you shouldn't. I can
  look after the practice."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "I think I should rather like to be in at the death, if it
  won't inconvenience you. But it is possible that they may get away with the
  booty."</p>

  <p>"Quite," he agreed; "and then it would be useful to know exactly how and
  where it disappears. Yes, go with them, by all means, and keep a sharp
  look-out."</p>

  <p>At this moment Badger returned with the two plain clothes men whom his
  whistle had called from their posts, and simultaneously a boat was seen
  approaching the steps by the bridge, rowed by the two fishermen. The
  inspector looked at us inquiringly. "Are you coming to see the sport?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Doctor Jervis would like to come with you," Thorndyke replied. "I have to
  get back to London. But you will be a fair boat-load without me."</p>

  <p>This appeared to be also the view of the two fishermen, as they brought up
  at the steps and observed the four passengers; but they made no demur beyond
  inquiring if there were not any more; and when we had taken our places in the
  stern sheets, they pushed off and pulled through the bridge and away down
  stream. Gradually, the village receded and the houses and the bridge grew
  small and more distant, though they remained visible for a long time over the
  marshy levels; and still, as I looked back through my glasses, I could see
  Thorndyke on the bridge, watching the pursuit with his binocular to his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the fugitive barge, having got some two miles start, seemed to
  be drawing ahead. But it was only at intervals that we could see her, for the
  tide was falling fast and we were mostly hemmed in by the high, muddy banks.
  Only when we entered a straight reach of the river could we see her sails
  over the land; and every time that she came into view, she appeared
  perceptibly smaller.</p>

  <p>When the river grew wider, the mast was stepped and a good-sized lug-sail
  hoisted, though one of the fishermen continued to ply his oar on the weather
  side, while the other took the tiller. This improved our pace appreciably;
  but still, whenever we caught a glimpse of the barge, it was evident that she
  was still gaining.</p>

  <p>On one of these occasions the man at the tiller, standing up to get a
  better view, surveyed our quarry intently for nearly a minute and then
  addressed the inspector.</p>

  <p>"She's a-going to give us the go-by, mister," he observed with
  conviction.</p>

  <p>"Still gaining?" asked Badger.</p>

  <p>"Aye. She's a-going to slip across the tail of Foulness Sand into the deep
  channel. And that's the last we shall see of her."</p>

  <p>"But can't we get into the channel the same way?" demanded Badger.</p>

  <p>"Well, d'ye see," replied the fisherman, "'tis like this. Tide's a-running
  out, but there'll be enough for her. It'll just carry her out through the
  Whitaker Channel and across the spit. Then it'll turn, and up she'll go,
  London way, on the flood. But we shall catch the flood-tide in the Whitaker
  Channel, and a rare old job we'll have to get out; and when we do get out,
  that barge'll be miles away."</p>

  <p>The inspector swore long and earnestly. He even alluded to himself as a
  "blithering idiot." But that helped matters not at all. The fisherman's
  dismal prophecy was fulfilled in every horrid detail. When we were
  approaching the Whitaker Channel the barge was just crossing the spit, and
  the last of the ebb-tide was trickling out. By the time we were fairly in the
  Channel the tide had turned and was already flowing in with a speed that
  increased every minute; while over the sand we could see the barge, already
  out in the open estuary, heading to the west on the flood-tide at a good six
  knots.</p>

  <p>Poor Badger was frantic. With yearning eyes fixed on the dwindling barge,
  he cursed, entreated, encouraged and made extravagant offers. He even took an
  oar and pulled with such desperate energy that he caught a crab and turned a
  neat back somersault into the fisherman's lap. The two mariners pulled until
  their oars bent like canes; but still the sandy banks crept by, inch by inch,
  and ever the turbid water seemed to pour up the channel more and yet more
  swiftly. It was a fearful struggle and seemed to last for hours; and when, at
  last, the boat crawled out across the spit and the exhausted rowers rested on
  their oars, the sun was just setting and the barge had disappeared into the
  west.</p>

  <p>I was really sorry for Badger. His oversight in respect of the anchor was
  a very natural one or a landsman, and he had evidently taken infinite pains
  over the case and shown excellent judgment in keeping a close watch on the
  neighbourhood of Garbridge; and now, after all his care, it looked as if both
  the robbers and their booty had slipped through his fingers. It was
  desperately bad luck.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the elder fisherman, "they've give us a run for our money;
  but they've got clear away. What's to be done now, mister?"</p>

  <p>Badger had nothing to suggest excepting that we should pull or sail up the
  river in the hope of getting some assistance on the way. He was in the lowest
  depths of despair and dejection. But now, when Fortune seemed to have
  deserted us utterly, and failure appeared to be an accomplished fact,
  Providence intervened.</p>

  <p>A small steam vessel that had been approaching from the direction of the
  East Swin suddenly altered her course and bore down as if to speak us. The
  fisherman who had last spoken looked at her attentively for a few moments and
  then slapped his thigh. "Saved by gum!" he exclaimed. "This'll do your trick,
  mister. Here comes a Customs cruiser."</p>

  <p>Instantly the two fishermen bent to their oars to meet the oncoming craft,
  and in a few minutes we were alongside, Badger hailing like a bull of Bashan.
  A brief explanation to the officer in charge secured a highly sympathetic
  promise of help. We all scrambled up on deck; the boat was dropped astern at
  the scope of her painter; the engine-room bell jangled merrily, and the
  smart, yacht-like vessel began to forge ahead.</p>

  <p>"Now then," said the officer, as his craft gathered way, "give us a
  description of this barge. What is she like?</p>

  <p>"She's a small stumpy," the senior fisherman explained, "flying light;
  wants paint badly; steers with a wheel; green transom with Bluebell, Maldon,
  cut in and gilded. Seemed to be keeping along the north shore."</p>

  <p>With these particulars in his mind, the officer explored the western
  horizon with a pair of night-glasses, although it was still broad daylight.
  Presently he reported: "There's a stumpy in a line with the Blacktail Spit
  buoy. Just take a look at her." He handed his glasses to the fisherman, who,
  after a careful inspection of the stranger, gave it as his opinion that she
  was our quarry. "Probably makin' for Southend or Leigh," said he, and added:
  "I'll bet she's bound for Benfleet Creek. Nice quiet place, that, to land the
  stuff."</p>

  <p>Our recent painful experience was now reversed, for as our swift little
  vessel devoured the miles of water, the barge, which we were all watching
  eagerly, loomed up larger every minute. By the time we were abreast of the
  Mouse Lightship, she was but a few hundred yards ahead, and even through my
  glasses, the name Bluebell was clearly legible. Badger nearly wept with
  delight; the officer in charge smiled an anticipatory smile; the deck-hands
  girded up their loins for the coming capture and the plain-clothes men each
  furtively polished a pair of handcuffs.</p>

  <p>At length the little cruiser came fairly abreast of the barge&mdash;not
  unobserved by the two men on her deck. Then she sheered in suddenly and swept
  alongside. One hand neatly hooked a shroud with a grappling iron and made
  fast while a couple of preventive officers, the plain men and the inspector
  jumped down simultaneously on to the barge's deck. For a moment, the two
  bawley men were inclined to show fight; but the odds were too great. After a
  perfunctory scuffle they both submitted to be handcuffed and were at once
  hauled up on board the cruiser and lodged in the fore-peak under guard. Then
  the chief officer, the two fishermen and I jumped on board the barge and
  followed Badger down the companion hatch to the cabin.</p>

  <p>It was a curious scene that was revealed in that little cupboard-like
  apartment by the light of Badger's electric torch. On each of the two lockers
  was stretched a man, securely lashed with lead-line and having drawn over his
  face a knitted stocking cap, while on the little triangular fixed table
  rested an iron-bound box which I instantly identified by my recollection of
  the description of the bullion-case in the ship's manifest. It was but the
  work of a minute to liberate the skipper and his son and send them up,
  wrathful but substantially uninjured, to refresh on the cruiser; and then the
  ponderous treasure-chest was borne in triumph by two muscular deck-hands, up
  the narrow steps, to be hoisted to the Government vessel.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," said the inspector, mopping his face with his handkerchief,
  "all's well that ends well, but I thought I had lost the men and the stuff
  that time. What are you going to do? I shall stay on board as this boat is
  going right up to the Custom House in London; but if you want to get home
  sooner, I dare say the chief officer will put you ashore at Southend."</p>

  <p>I decided to adopt this course, and I was accordingly landed at Southend
  Pier with a telegram from Badger to his head-quarters; and at Southend I was
  fortunate enough to catch an express train which brought me to Fenchurch
  Street while the night was still young.</p>

  <p>When I reached our chambers, I found Thorndyke seated by the fire,
  serenely studying a brief. He stood up as I entered and, laying aside the
  brief, remarked: "You are back sooner than I expected. How sped the chase?
  Did you catch the barge?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. We've got the men and we've got the bullion. But we very nearly lost
  both;" and here I gave him an account of the pursuit and the capture, to
  which he listened with the liveliest interest. "That Customs cruiser was a
  piece of sheer luck," said he, when I had concluded. "I am delighted. This
  capture simplifies the case for us enormously."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me to dispose of the case altogether," said I. "The property
  is recovered and the thieves are in custody. But I think most of the credit
  belongs to Badger."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled enigmatically. "I should let him have it all, Jervis," he
  said; and then, after a reflective pause, he continued: "We will go round to
  Scotland Yard in the morning to verify the capture. If the package agrees
  with the description in the bill of lading, the case, as you say, is disposed
  of."</p>

  <p>"It is hardly necessary," said I. "The marks were all correct and the
  Customs seals were unbroken&mdash;but still, I know you won't be satisfied
  until you have verified everything for yourself. And I suppose you are
  right."</p>

  <p>It was past eleven in the following forenoon when we invaded
  Superintendent Miller's office at Scotland Yard. That genial officer looked
  up from his desk as we entered and laughed joyously. "I told you so, Badger,"
  he chuckled, turning to the inspector, who had also looked up and was
  regarding us with a foxy smile. "I knew the doctor wouldn't be satisfied
  until he had seen it with his own eyes. I suppose that is what you have come
  for, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply. "It is a mere formality, of course, but, if you
  don't mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," replied Miller. "Come along, Badger, and show the
  doctor your prize."</p>

  <p>The two officers conducted us to a room, which the superintendent
  unlocked, and which contained a small table, a measuring standard, a weighing
  machine, a set of Snellen's test-types, and the now historic case of bullion.
  The latter Thorndyke inspected closely, checking the marks and dimensions by
  his notes.</p>

  <p>"I see you haven't opened it," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Miller. "Why should we? The Customs seals are intact."</p>

  <p>"I thought you might like to know what was inside," Thorndyke
  explained.</p>

  <p>The two officers looked at him quickly and the inspector exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"But we do know. It was opened and checked at the Customs."</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose is inside?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose," Badger replied testily. "I know. There are four bars of
  gold inside."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, "as the representative of the Insurance Company, I
  should like to see the contents of that case."</p>

  <p>The two officers stared at him in amazement, as also, I must admit, did I.
  The implied doubt seemed utterly contrary to reason.</p>

  <p>"This is scepticism with a vengeance!" said Miller. "How on earth is it
  possible&mdash;but there, I suppose if you are not satisfied, we should be
  justified&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He glanced at his subordinate, who snorted impatiently: "Oh, open it and
  let him see the bars. And then, I suppose, he will want us to make an assay
  of the metal."</p>

  <p>The superintendent retired with wrinkled brows and presently returned with
  a screwdriver, a hammer and a case-opener. Very deftly he broke the seals,
  extracted the screws and prised up the lid of the case, inside which were one
  or two folds of thick canvas. Lifting these with something of a flourish, he
  displayed the upper pair of dull, yellow bars.</p>

  <p>"Are you satisfied now, sir?" demanded Badger. "Or do you want to see the
  other two?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked reflectively at the two bars, and the two officers looked
  inquiringly at him (but one might as profitably have watched the expression
  on the face of a ship's figure). Then he took from his pocket a folding
  foot-rule and quickly measured the three dimensions of one of the bars.</p>

  <p>"Is that weighing machine reliable?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is correct to an ounce," the superintendent replied, gazing at my
  colleague with a slightly uneasy expression. "Why?"</p>

  <p>By way of reply Thorndyke lifted out the bar that he had measured and
  carrying it across to the machine, laid it on the platform and carefully
  adjusted the weights.</p>

  <p>"Well?" the superintendent queried anxiously, as Thorndyke took the
  reading from the scale.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-nine pounds, three ounces," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Well?" repeated the superintendent. "What about it?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at him impassively for a moment, and then, in the same
  quiet tone, answered: "Lead."</p>

  <p>"What!" the two officers shrieked in unison, darting across to the scale
  and glaring at the bar of metal. Then Badger recovered himself and
  expostulated, not without temper, "Nonsense, sir. Look at it. Can't you see
  that it is gold?"</p>

  <p>"I can see that it is gilded," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"But," protested Miller, "the thing is impossible! What makes you think it
  is lead?"</p>

  <p>"It is just a question of specific gravity," was the reply. "This bar
  contains seventy-two cubic inches of metal and it weighs twenty pounds, three
  ounces. Therefore it is a bar of lead. But if you are still doubtful, it is
  quite easy to settle the matter. May I cut a small piece off the bar?"</p>

  <p>The superintendent gasped and looked at his subordinate. "I suppose," said
  he, "under the circumstances, eh, Badger? Yes. Very well, doctor."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke produced a strong pocket-knife and, having lifted the bar to the
  table, applied the knife to one corner and tapped it smartly with the hammer.
  The blade passed easily through the soft metal, and as the detached piece
  fell to the floor, the two officers and I craned forward eagerly. And then
  all possible doubts were set at rest. There was no mistaking the white,
  silvery lustre of the freshly-cut surface.</p>

  <p>"Snakes!" exclaimed the superintendent. "This is a fair knock-out! Why,
  the blighters have got away with the stuff, after all! Unless," he added,
  with a quizzical look at Thorndyke, "you know where it is, doctor. I expect
  you do."</p>

  <p>"I believe I do," said Thorndyke, "and if you care to come down with me to
  the London Docks, I think I can hand it over to you."</p>

  <p>The superintendent's face brightened appreciably. Not so Badger's. That
  afflicted officer flung down the chip of metal that he had been examining,
  and turning to Thorndyke, demanded sourly: "Why didn't you tell us this
  before, sir? You let me go off chivvying that damn barge, and you knew all
  the time that the stuff wasn't on board."</p>

  <p>"My dear Badger," Thorndyke expostulated, "don't you see that these lead
  bars are essential to our case? They prove that the gold bars were never
  landed and that they are consequently still on the ship. Which empowers us to
  detain any gold that we may find on her."</p>

  <p>"There, now, Badger," said the superintendent, "it's no use for you to
  argue with the doctor. He's like a giraffe. He can see all round him at once.
  Let us get on to the Docks."</p>

  <p>Having locked the room, we all sallied forth, and, taking a train at
  Charing Cross Station, made our way by Mark Lane and Fenchurch Street to
  Wapping, where, following Thorndyke, we entered the Docks and proceeded
  straight to a wharf near the Wapping entrance. Here Thorndyke exchanged a few
  words with a Customs official, who hurried away and presently returned,
  accompanied by an officer of higher rank. The latter, having saluted
  Thorndyke and cast a slightly amused glance at our little party, said:
  "They've landed that package that you spoke about. I've had it put in my
  office for the present. Will you come and have a look at it?"</p>

  <p>We followed him to his office behind a long row of sheds, where, on a
  table, was a strong wooden case, somewhat larger than the "bullion"-case,
  while on the desk a large, many-leaved document lay open.</p>

  <p>"This is your case, I think," said the official; "but you had better check
  it by the manifest. Here is the entry: 'One case containing seventeen and
  three-quarter dozen brass six-inch by three-eighths screw-bolts with nuts.
  Dimensions, sixteen inches by thirteen by nine. Gross weight a hundred and
  nineteen pounds; net weight a hundred and thirteen pounds.' Consigned to
  'Jackson and Walker, 593 Great Alie Street, London, E.' Is that the one?"</p>

  <p>"That is the one," Thorndyke replied.</p>

  <p>"Then," said our friend, "we'll get it open and have a look at those brass
  screw-bolts."</p>

  <p>With a dexterity surprising in an official of such high degree, he had the
  screws out in a twinkling, and prising up the lid, displayed a fold of coarse
  canvas. As he lifted this the two police officers peered eagerly into the
  case; and suddenly the eager expression on Badger's face changed to one of
  bitter disappointment.</p>

  <p>"You've missed fire this time, sir," he snapped. "This is just a case of
  brass bolts."</p>

  <p>"Gold bolts, inspector," Thorndyke corrected, placidly. He picked out one
  and handed it to the astonished detective. "Did you ever feel a brass bolt of
  that weight?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, it certainly is devilish heavy," the inspector admitted, weighing
  it in his hand and passing it on to Miller.</p>

  <p>"Its weight, as stated on the manifest," said Thorndyke, "works out at
  well over eight and a half ounces, but we may as well check it." He produced
  from his pocket a little spring balance, to which he slung the bolt. "You
  see," he said, "it weighs eight ounces and two-thirds. But a brass bolt of
  the same size would weigh only three ounces and four-fifths. There is not the
  least doubt that these bolts are gold; and as you see that their aggregate
  weight is a hundred and thirteen while the weight of the four missing bars is
  a hundred and thirteen pounds, two ounces, it is a reasonable inference that
  these bolts represent those bars; and an uncommonly good job they made of the
  melting to lose only two ounces. Has the consignee's agent turned up
  yet?"</p>

  <p>"He is waiting outside," replied the officer, with a pleased smile,
  "hopping about like a pea in a frying-pan. I'll call him in."</p>

  <p>He did so, and a small, seedy man of strongly Semitic aspect approached
  the door with nervous caution and a rather pale face. But when his beady eye
  fell on the open case and the portentous assembly in the office, he turned
  about and fled along the wharf as if the hosts of the Philistines were at his
  heels.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is all perfectly simple, as you say," I replied to Thorndyke
  as we strolled back up Nightingale Lane, "but I don't see where you got your
  start. What made you think that the stolen case was a dummy?"</p>

  <p>"At first," Thorndyke replied, "it was just a matter of alternative
  hypotheses. It was purely speculative. The robbery described by Halethorpe
  was a very crude affair. It was planned in quite the wrong way. Noting this,
  I naturally asked myself: What is the right way to steal a case of gold
  ingots? Now, the outstanding difficulty in such a robbery arises from the
  ponderous nature of the thing stolen, and the way to overcome that difficulty
  is to get away with the booty at leisure before the robbery is
  discovered&mdash;the longer the better. It is also obvious that if you can
  delude someone into stealing your dummy you will have covered up your tracks
  most completely; for if that someone is caught, the issues are extremely
  confused, and if he is not caught, all the tracks lead away from you. Of
  course, he will discover the fraud when he tries to dispose of the swag, but
  his lips are sealed by the fact that he has, himself, committed a felony. So
  that is the proper strategical plan and, though it was wildly improbable, and
  there was nothing whatever to suggest it, still, the possibility that this
  crude robbery might cover a more subtle one had to be borne in mind. It was
  necessary to make absolutely certain that the gold bars were really in the
  case when it left Belhaven. I had practically no doubt that they were. Our
  visit to the Custom House was little more than a formality, just to give us
  an undeniable datum from which to make our start. We had to find somebody who
  had actually seen the case open and verified the contents, and when we found
  that man&mdash;Mr. Byrne&mdash;it instantly became obvious that the wildly
  improbable thing had really happened. The gold bars had already disappeared.
  I had calculated the approximate size of the real bars. They would contain
  forty-two cubic inches, and would be about seven inches by three by two. The
  dimensions given by Byrne&mdash;evidently correct, as shown by those of the
  case, which the bars fitted pretty closely&mdash;were impossible. If those
  bars had been gold, they would have weighed two hundred pounds, instead of
  the hundred and thirteen pounds shown on his report. The astonishing thing is
  that Byrne did not observe the discrepancy. There are not many Customs
  officers who would have let it pass."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it rather odd," I asked, "that the thieves should have gambled on
  such a remote chance?"</p>

  <p>"It is pretty certain," he replied, "that they were unaware of the risk
  they were taking. Probably they assumed&mdash;as most persons would have
  done&mdash;that a case of bullion would be merely inspected and passed. Few
  persons realise the rigorous methods of the Customs officers. But to resume:
  It was obvious that the 'gold' bars that Byrne had examined were dummies. The
  next question was, where were the real bars? Had they been made away with, or
  were they still on the ship? To settle this question I decided to go through
  the manifest and especially through the column of net weights. And there,
  presently, I came upon a package the net weight of which was within two
  ounces of the weight of stolen bars. And that package was a parcel of brass
  screw-bolts&mdash;on a homeward-bound ship! But who on earth sends brass
  bolts from Africa to London? The anomaly was so striking that I examined the
  entry more closely, and then I found&mdash;by dividing the net weight by the
  number of bolts&mdash;that each of these little bolts weighed over half a
  pound. But, if this were so, those bolts could be of no other metal than gold
  or platinum, and were almost certainly gold. Also, their aggregate weight was
  exactly that of the stolen bars, less two ounces, which probably represented
  loss in melting."</p>

  <p>"And the scrivelloes," said I, "and the gum copal and the kola nuts; what
  was their bearing on the inquiry? I can't, even now, trace any
  connection."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke cast an astonished glance at me, and then replied with a quiet
  chuckle: "There wasn't any. Those notes were for the benefit of the shipping
  gentleman. As he would look over my shoulder, I had to give him something to
  read and think about. If I had noted only the brass bolts, I should have
  virtually informed him of the nature of my suspicions."</p>

  <p>"Then, really, you had the case complete when we left Belhaven?"</p>

  <p>"Theoretically, yes. But we had to recover the stolen case, for without
  those lead ingots we could not prove that the gold bolts were stolen
  property, any more than one could prove a murder without evidence of the
  death of the victim."</p>

  <p>"And how do you suppose the robbery was carried out? How was the gold got
  out of the ship's strong-room?"</p>

  <p>"I should say it was never there. The robbers, I suspect, are the ship's
  mate, the chief engineer and possibly the purser. The mate controls the
  stowage of cargo, and the chief engineer controls the repair shop and has the
  necessary skill and knowledge to deal with the metal. On receiving the advice
  of the bullion consignment, I imagine they prepared the dummy case in
  agreement with the description. When the bullion arrived, the dummy case
  would be concealed on deck and the exchange made as soon as the bullion was
  put on board. The dummy would be sent to the strong-room and the real case
  carried to a prepared hiding place. Then the engineer would cut up the bars,
  melt them piecemeal and cast them into bolts in an ordinary casting flask,
  using an iron bolt as a model, and touching up the screw-threads with a die.
  The mate could enter the case on the manifest when he pleased, and send the
  bill of lading by post to the nominal consignee. That is what I imagine to
  have been the procedure."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's solution turned out to be literally correct. The consignee,
  pursued by Inspector Badger along the quay, was arrested at the dock gates
  and immediately volunteered King's evidence. Thereupon the mate, the chief
  engineer and the purser of the steamship Labadi were arrested and brought to
  trial; when they severally entered a plea of guilty and described the method
  of the robbery almost in Thorndyke's words.</p>

  <h2><a name="c7"
     id="c7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE FUNERAL PYRE</h2>

  <p>Thorndyke did not often indulge in an evening paper, and was even disposed
  to view that modern institution with some disfavour; whence it happened that
  when I entered our chambers shortly before dinner time with a copy of the
  Evening Gazette in my hand, he fixed upon the folded news-sheet an inquiring
  and slightly disapproving eye.</p>

  <p>"'Orrible discovery near Dartford," I announced, quoting the juvenile
  vendor.</p>

  <p>The disapproval faded from his face, but the inquiring expression
  remained.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I replied; "but it seems t be something in our line."</p>

  <p>"My learned friend does us an injustice," he rejoined, with his eye
  riveted on the paper. "Still, if you are going to make my flesh creep, I will
  try to endure it."</p>

  <p>Thus invited, I opened the paper and read out as follows:</p>

  <p>"A shocking tragedy has come to light in a meadow about a mile from
  Dartford. About two o'clock this morning, a rural constable observed a rick
  on fire out on the marshes near the creek. By the time he reached it the
  upper half of the rick was burning fiercely in the strong wind, and as he
  could do nothing alone, he went to the adjacent farm-house and gave the
  alarm. The farmer and two of his sons accompanied the constable to the scene
  of the conflagration, but the rick was now a blazing mass, roaring in the
  wind and giving out an intense heat. As it was obviously impossible to save
  any part of it, and as there were no other ricks near, the farmer decided to
  abandon it to its fate and went home.</p>

  <p>"At eight o'clock he returned to the spot and found the rick still
  burning, though reduced to a heap of glowing cinders and ashes, and
  approaching it, he was horrified to perceive a human skull grinning out from
  the cindery mass. Closer examination showed other bones&mdash;all calcined
  white and chalky&mdash;and close to the skull a stumpy clay pipe. The
  explanation of this dreadful occurrence seems quite simple. The rick was not
  quite finished, and when the farm hands knocked off work they left the ladder
  in position. It is assumed that some tramp, in search of a night's lodging,
  observed the ladder, and climbing up it, made himself comfortable in the
  loose hay at the top of the rick, where he fell asleep with his lighted pipe
  in his mouth. This ignited the hay and the man must have been suffocated by
  the fumes without awakening from his sleep."</p>

  <p>"A reasonable explanation," was Thorndyke's comment, "and quite probable;
  but of course it is pure hypothesis. As a matter of fact, any one of the
  three conceivable causes of violent death is possible in this
  case&mdash;accident, suicide or homicide."</p>

  <p>"I should have supposed," said I, "that we could almost exclude suicide.
  It is difficult to imagine a man electing to roast himself to death."</p>

  <p>"I cannot agree with my learned friend," Thorndyke rejoined. "I can
  imagine a case&mdash;and one of great medico-legal interest&mdash;that would
  exactly fit the present circumstances. Let us suppose a man, hopelessly
  insolvent, desperate and disgusted with life, who decides to provide for his
  family by investing the few pounds that he has left in insuring his life
  heavily and then making away with himself. How would he proceed? If he should
  commit suicide by any of the orthodox methods he would simply invalidate his
  policy. But now, suppose he knows of a likely rick; that he provides himself
  with some rapidly-acting poison, such as potassium cyanide&mdash;he could
  even use prussic acid if he carried it in a rubber or celluloid bottle, which
  would be consumed in the fire; that he climbs on to the rick; sets fire to
  it, and as soon as it is fairly alight, takes his dose of poison and falls
  back dead among the hay. Who is to contest his family's claim? The fire will
  have destroyed all traces of the poison, even if they should be sought for.
  But it is practically certain that the question would never be raised. The
  claim would be paid without demur."</p>

  <p>I could not help smiling at this calm exposition of a practicable crime.
  "It is a mercy, Thorndyke," I remarked, "that you are an honest man. If you
  were not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think," he retorted, "that I should find some better means of
  livelihood than suicide. But with regard to this case: it will be worth
  watching. The tramp hypothesis is certainly the most probable; but its very
  probability makes an alternative hypothesis at least possible. No one is
  likely to suspect fraudulent suicide; but that immunity from suspicion is a
  factor that increases the probability of fraudulent suicide. And so, to a
  less extent, with homicide. We must watch the case and see if there are any
  further developments."</p>

  <p>Further developments were not very long in appearing. The report in the
  morning paper disposed effectually of the tramp theory without offering any
  other.</p>

  <p>"The tragedy of the burning rick," it said, "is taking a some what
  mysterious turn. It is now clear that the unknown man, who was assumed to
  have been a tramp, must have been a person of some social position, for
  careful examination of the ashes by the police have brought to light various
  articles which would have been carried only by a man of fair means. The clay
  pipe was evidently one of a pair&mdash;of which the second one has been
  recovered&mdash;probably silver-mounted and carried in a case, the steel
  frame of which has been found. Both pipes are of the 'Burns Cutty' pattern
  and have neatly scratched on the bowls the initials 'R. R.' The following
  articles have also been found:&mdash; "Remains of a watch, probably gold, and
  a rather singular watch-chain, having alternate links of platinum and gold.
  The gold links have partly disappeared, but numerous beads of gold have been
  found, derived apparently from the watch and chain. The platinum links are
  intact and are fashioned of twisted square wire. A bunch of keys, partly
  fused; a rock crystal seal, apparently from a ring; a little porcelain mascot
  figure, with a hole for suspension&mdash;possibly from the
  watch-chain&mdash;and a number of artificial teeth. In connection with the
  latter, a puzzling and slightly sinister aspect has been given to the case by
  the finding of an upper dental plate by a ditch some two hundred yards from
  the rick. The plate has two gaps and, on comparison with the skull of the
  unknown man, these have been found by the police surgeon to correspond with
  two groups of remaining teeth. Moreover, the artificial teeth found in the
  ashes all seem to belong to a lower plate. The presence of this plate, so far
  from the scene of the man's death, is extremely difficult to account
  for."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke finished reading the extract he looked at me as if inviting
  some comment.</p>

  <p>"It is a most remarkable and mysterious affair," said I, "and naturally
  recalls to my mind the hypothetical case that you suggested yesterday. If
  that case was possible then, it is actually probable now. It fits these new
  facts perfectly not only in respect of the abundant means of identification
  but even to this dental plate&mdash;if we assume that he took the poison as
  he was approaching the rick, and that the poison was of an acrid or
  irritating character which caused him to cough or retch. And I can think of
  no other plausible explanation."</p>

  <p>"There are other possibilities," said Thorndyke, "but fraudulent suicide
  is certainly the most probable theory on the known facts. But we shall see.
  As you say, the body can hardly fail to be identified at a pretty early
  date."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact it was identified in the course of that same day. Both
  Thorndyke and I were busily engaged until evening in the courts and elsewhere
  and had not had time to give this curious case any consideration. But as we
  walked home together, we encountered Mr. Stalker of the Griffin Life
  Assurance Company pacing up and down King's Bench Walk near the entry of our
  chambers.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, striding forward to meet us near the Mitre Court
  gateway, "you are just the very men I wanted to see. There is a little matter
  that I want to consult you about. I shan't detain you long."</p>

  <p>"It won't matter much if you do," said Thorndyke. "We have finished our
  routine work for the day and our time is now our own." He led the way up to
  our chambers, where, having given the fire a stir, he drew up three
  arm-chairs.</p>

  <p>"Now, Stalker," said he. "Warm your toes and tell us your troubles."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stalker spread out his hands to the blaze began reflectively:</p>

  <p>"It will be enough, I think, if I give you the facts&mdash;and most of
  them you probably know already. You have heard about this man whose remains
  were found in the ashes of a burnt rick? Well, it turns out that he was a
  certain Mr. Reginald Reed, an outside broker, as I understand; but what is of
  more interest to us is that he was a client of ours. We have issued a policy
  on his life for three thousand pounds. I thought I remembered the name when I
  saw it in the paper this afternoon, so I looked up our files and there it
  was, sure enough."</p>

  <p>"When was the policy issued?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Stalker. "That's the exasperating feature of the case. The
  policy was issued less than a year ago. He has only paid a single premium. So
  we stand to drop practically the whole three thousand. Of course, we have to
  take the fat with the lean, but we don't like to take it in such precious
  large lumps."</p>

  <p>"Of course you don't," agreed Thorndyke. "But now you have come to consult
  me&mdash;about what?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Stalker, "I put it to you: isn't there something obviously
  fishy about the case? Are the circumstances normal? For instance, how the
  devil came a respectable city gentleman to be smoking his pipe in a haystack
  out in a lonely meadow at two o'clock in the morning, or thereabouts?"</p>

  <p>"I agree," said Thorndyke, "that the circumstances are highly abnormal.
  But there is no doubt that the man is dead. Extremely dead, if I may use the
  expression. What is the point that you wish to raise?"</p>

  <p>"I am not raising any point," replied Stalker. "We should like you to
  attend the inquest and watch the case for us. Of course, in our policies, as
  you know, suicide is expressly ruled out; and if this should turn out to have
  been a case of suicide&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is there to suggest that it was?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"What is there to suggest that it wasn't?" retorted Stalker.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," rejoined Thorndyke. "But a negative plea is of no use to you.
  You will have to furnish positive proof of suicide, or else pay the
  claim."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I realise that," said Stalker, "and I am not suggesting&mdash;But
  there, it is of no use discussing the matter while we know so little. I leave
  the case in your hands. Can you attend the inquest?"</p>

  <p>"I shall make it my business to do so," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Stalker, rising and putting on his gloves, "then we will
  leave it at that; and we couldn't leave it in better case."</p>

  <p>When our visitor had gone I remarked to Thorndyke: "Stalker seems to have
  conceived the same idea as my learned senior&mdash;fraudulent suicide."</p>

  <p>"It is not surprising," he replied. "Stalker is a shrewd man and he
  perceives that when an abnormal thing has happened we may look for an
  abnormal explanation. Fraudulent suicide was a speculative possibility
  yesterday: to-day, in the light of these new facts, it is the most probable
  theory. But mere probabilities won't help Stalker. If there is no direct
  evidence of suicide&mdash;and there is not likely to be any&mdash;the verdict
  will be Death by Misadventure, and the Griffin Company will have to pay."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you won't do anything until you have heard what transpires at
  the inquest?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "I think we should do well to go down and just go over
  the ground. At present we have the facts at third hand, and we don't know
  what may have been overlooked. As to-morrow is fairly free I propose that we
  make an early start and see the place ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Is there any particular point that you want to clear up?"</p>

  <p>"No; I have nothing definite in view. The circumstances are compatible
  with either accident, suicide or homicide, with an undoubted leaning towards
  suicide. But, at present, I have a completely open mind. I am, in fact, going
  down to Dartford in the hope of getting a lead in some definite
  direction."</p>

  <p>When we alighted at Dartford Station on the following morning, Thorndyke
  looked inquiringly up and down the platform until he espied an inspector,
  when he approached the official and asked for a direction to the site of the
  burnt rick.</p>

  <p>The official glanced at Thorndyke's canvas-covrered research-case and at
  my binocular and camera as he replied with a smile: "You are not the first,
  by a long way, that has asked that question. There has been a regular
  procession of Press gentlemen that way this morning. The place is about a
  mile from here. You take the foot-path to Joyce Green and turn off towards
  the creek opposite Temple Farm. This is about where the rick stood," he
  added, as Thorndyke produced his one-inch Ordnance map and a pencil, "a few
  yards from that dyke."</p>

  <p>With this direction and the open map we set forth from the station, and
  taking our way along the unfrequented path soon left the town behind. As we
  crossed the second stile, where the path rejoined the road, Thorndyke paused
  to survey the prospect.</p>

  <p>"Stalker's question," he remarked, "was not unreasonable. This road leads
  nowhere but to the river, and one does rather wonder what a city man can have
  been doing out on these marshes in the small hours of the morning. I think
  that will be our objective, where you see those men at work by the shepherd's
  hut, or whatever it is."</p>

  <p>We struck off across the level meadows, out of which arose the red sails
  of a couple of barges, creeping down the invisible creek; and as we
  approached our objective the shepherd's hut resolved itself into a
  contractor's office van, and the men were seen to be working with shovels and
  sieves on the ashes of the rick. A police inspector was superintending the
  operations, and when we drew near he accosted us with a civil inquiry as to
  our business.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke presented his card and explained that he was watching the case
  in the interests of the Griffin Insurance Company. "I suppose," he added, "I
  shall be given the necessary facilities?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied the officer, glancing at my colleague with an odd
  mixture of respect and suspicion, "and if you can spot anything that we've
  overlooked, you are very welcome. It's all for the public good. Is there
  anything in particular that you want to see?"</p>

  <p>"I should like to see everything that has been recovered so far. The
  remains of the body have been removed, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. To the mortuary. But I have got all the effects here."</p>

  <p>He led the way to the office&mdash;a wooden hut on low wheels&mdash;and
  unlocking the door, invited us to enter. "Here are the things that we have
  salved," he said, indicating a table covered with white paper on which the
  various articles were neatly set out, "and I think it's about the lot. We
  haven't come on anything fresh for the last hour or so."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked over the collection thoughtfully; picked up and examined
  successively the two clay pipes&mdash;each with the initials "R. R." neatly
  incised on the bowl&mdash;the absurd little mascot figure, so incongruous
  with its grim surroundings and the tragic circumstances, the distorted keys,
  the platinum chain-links to several of which shapeless blobs of gold adhered,
  and the crystal seal; and then, collecting the artificial teeth, arranged
  them in what appeared to be their correct order and compared them with the
  dental plate.</p>

  <p>"I think," said he, holding the latter in his fingers, "that as the body
  is not here, I should like to secure the means of comparison of these teeth
  with the skull. There will be no objection to that, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"What did you wish to do?" the inspector asked.</p>

  <p>"I should like to take a cast of the plate and a wax impression of the
  loose teeth. No damage will be done to the originals, of course."</p>

  <p>The inspector hesitated, his natural, official tendency to refuse
  permission apparently contending with a desire to see with his own eyes how
  the famous expert carried out his mysterious methods of research. In the end
  the latter prevailed and the official sanction was given, subject to a
  proviso. "You won't mind my looking on while you do it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," replied Thorndyke. "Why should I?"</p>

  <p>"I thought that perhaps your methods were a sort of trade secret."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed softly as he opened the research case. "My dear
  inspector," said he, "the people who have trade secrets are those who make a
  profound mystery of simple processes that any schoolboy could carry out with
  once showing. That is the necessity for the secrecy."</p>

  <p>As he was speaking he half-filled a tiny aluminium saucepan with water,
  and having dropped into it a couple of cakes of dentist's moulding
  composition, put it to heat over a spirit-lamp. While it was heating he
  greased the dental plate and the loose teeth, and prepared the little rubber
  basin and the other appliances for mixing the plaster.</p>

  <p>The inspector was deeply interested. With almost ravenous attention he
  followed these proceedings, and eagerly watched Thorndyke roll the softened
  composition into the semblance of a small sausage and press it firmly on the
  teeth of the plate; peered into the plaster tin, and when the liquid plaster
  was mixed and applied, first to the top and then to the lower surface of the
  plate, not only observed the process closely but put a number of very
  pertinent questions.</p>

  <p>While the plaster and composition were setting Thorndyke renewed his
  inspection of the salvage from the rick, picking out a number of iron boot
  protectors which he placed apart in a little heap.</p>

  <p>Then he proceeded to roll out two flat strips of softened composition,
  into one of which he pressed the loose teeth in what appeared to be their
  proper order, and into the other the boot protectors&mdash;eight in
  number&mdash;after first dusting the surface with powdered French chalk. By
  this time the plaster had set hard enough to allow of the mould being opened
  and the dental plate taken out. Then Thorndyke, having painted the surfaces
  of the plaster pieces with knotting, put the mould together again and tied it
  firmly with string, mixed a fresh bowl of plaster and poured it into the
  mould.</p>

  <p>While this was setting Thorndyke made a careful inventory, with my
  assistance, of the articles found in the ashes and put a few discreet
  questions to the inspector. But the latter knew very little about the case.
  His duty was merely to examine and report on the rick for the information of
  the coroner. The investigation of the case was evidently being conducted from
  headquarters. There being no information to be gleaned from the officer, we
  went out and inspected the site of the rick. But here, also, there was
  nothing to be learned; the surface of the ground was now laid bare and the
  men who were working with the sieves reported no further discoveries. We
  accordingly returned to the hut, and as the plaster had now set hard
  Thorndyke proceeded with infinite care to open the mould. The operation was a
  complete success, and as my colleague extracted the cast&mdash;a perfect
  replica, in plaster, of the dental plate&mdash;the inspector's admiration was
  unbounded. "Why," he exclaimed, "excepting for the colour you couldn't tell
  one from the other; but all the same, I don't quite see what you want it
  for."</p>

  <p>"I want it to compare with the skull," replied Thorndyke, "if I have time
  to call at the mortuary. As I can't take the original plate with me, I shall
  need this copy to make the comparison. Obviously, it is important to make
  sure that this is Reed's plate and not that of some other person. By the way,
  can you show us the spot where the plate was picked up?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the inspector. "You can see the place from here. It was
  just by that gate at the crossing of the ditch."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, inspector," said Thorndyke. "I think we will walk down and
  have a look at the place." He wrapped the new cast in a soft cloth, and
  having repacked his research&mdash;case, shook hands with the officer and
  prepared to depart.</p>

  <p>"You will notice, Jervis," he remarked as we walked towards the gate,
  "that this denture was picked up at a spot beyond the rick&mdash;farther from
  the town, I mean. Consequently, if the plate is Reed's, he must have dropped
  it while he was approaching the rick from the direction of the river. It will
  be worthwhile to see if we can find out whence he came."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed. "But the dropping of the plate is a rather mysterious
  affair. It must have happened when he took the poison&mdash;assuming that he
  really did poison himself; but one would have expected that he would wait
  until he got to the rick to take his dose."</p>

  <p>"We had better not make too many assumptions while we have so few facts,"
  said Thorndyke. He put down his case beside the gate, which guarded a bridge
  across a broad ditch, or drainage dyke, and opened his map.</p>

  <p>"The question is," said he, "did he come through this gate or was he only
  passing it? This dyke, you see, opens into the creek about three-quarters of
  a mile farther down. The probability is, therefore, that if he came up from
  the river across the marshes he would be on this side of the ditch and would
  pass the gate. But we had better try both sides. Let us leave our things by
  the gate and explore the ground for a few hundred yards, one on either side
  of the ditch. Which side will you take?"</p>

  <p>I elected to take the side nearer the creek, and, having put my camera
  down by the research-case, climbed over the padlocked gate and began to walk
  slowly along by the side of the ditch, scanning the ground for footprints
  showing the impression of boot-protectors. At first the surface was far from
  favourable for imprints of any kind, being, like that immediately around the
  gate, covered with thick turf. About a hundred and fifty yards down, however,
  I came upon a heap of worm-casts on which was plainly visible the print of a
  heel with a clear impression of a kidney-shaped protector such as I had seen
  in the hut. Thereupon I hailed Thorndyke and, having stuck my stick in the
  ground beside the heel-print, went back to meet him at the gate.</p>

  <p>"This is rather interesting, Jervis," he remarked, when I had described my
  find. "The inference seems to be that he came from the creek&mdash;unless
  there is another gate farther down. We had better have our compo impressions
  handy for comparison." He opened his case and taking from it the strip of
  composition&mdash;now as hard as bone&mdash;on which were the impressions of
  the boot-protectors, slipped it into his outer pocket. We then took up the
  case and the camera and proceeded to the spot marked by my stick.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, "it is not very conclusive, seeing that so many
  people use boot-protectors, but it is probably Reed's foot-print. Let us hope
  that we shall find something more distinctive farther on."</p>

  <p>We resumed our march, keeping a few yards apart and examining the ground
  closely as we went. For a full quarter of a mile we went on without detecting
  any trace of a foot-print on the thick turf. Suddenly we perceived ahead of
  us a stretch of yellow mud occupying a slight hollow, across which the creek
  had apparently overflowed at the last spring tide. When we reached it we
  found that the mud was nearly dry, but still soft enough to take an
  impression; and the surface was covered with a maze of foot-prints.</p>

  <p>We halted at the edge of the patch and surveyed the complicated pattern;
  and then it became evident that the whole group of prints had been produced
  by two pairs of feet, with the addition of a row of sheep-tracks.</p>

  <p>"This seems to raise an entirely new issue," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"It does," Thorndyke agreed. "I think we now begin to see a definite light
  on the case. But we must go cautiously. Here are two sets of foot-prints of
  which one is apparently Reed's&mdash;to judge by the
  boot-protectors&mdash;while the other prints have been made by a man, whom we
  will call X, who wore boots or shoes with rubber soles and heels. We had
  better begin by verifying Reed's." He produced the composition strip from his
  pocket, and, stooping over one pair of footprints, continued: "I think we may
  assume that these are Reed's feet. We have on the compo strip impressions of
  eight protectors from the rick, and on each foot-print there are four
  protectors. Moreover, the individual protectors are the same on the compo and
  on the foot-prints. Thus the compo shows two pairs of half-protectors, two
  single edge-pieces, and two kidney-shaped protectors; while each foot-print
  shows a pair of half-protectors on the outside of the sole, a single one on
  the inside and a kidney-shaped piece on the heel. Furthermore, in both cases
  the protectors are nearly new and show no appreciable signs of wear. The
  agreement is complete."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think," said I, "that we ought to take plaster records of
  them?"</p>

  <p>"I do," he replied, "seeing that a heavy shower or a high tide would
  obliterate them. If you will make the casts I will, meanwhile, make a careful
  drawing of the whole group to show the order of imposition."</p>

  <p>We fell to work forthwith upon our respective tasks, and by the time I had
  filled four of the clearest of the foot-prints with plaster, Thorndyke had
  completed his drawing with the aid of a set of coloured pencils from the
  research-case. While the plaster was setting he exhibited and explained the
  drawing.</p>

  <p>"You see, Jervis, that there are four lines of prints and a set of
  sheep-tracks. The first in order of time are these prints of X, drawn in
  blue. Then come the sheep, which trod on X's foot-prints. Next comes Reed,
  alone and after some interval, for he has trodden both on the sheep-tracks
  and on the tracks of X. Both men were going towards the river. Then we have
  the tracks of the two men coming back. This time they were together, for
  their tracks are parallel and neither treads into the prints of the other.
  Both tracks are rather sinuous as if the men were walking unsteadily, and
  both have trodden on the sheep-tracks and on the preceding tracks. Next, we
  have the tracks of X going alone towards the river and treading on all the
  others excepting number four, which is the tracks of X coming from the river
  and turning off towards that gate, which opens on to the road. The sequence
  of events is therefore pretty clear.</p>

  <p>"First, X came along here alone to some destination which we have yet to
  discover. Later&mdash;how much later we cannot judge&mdash;came Reed, alone.
  The two men seem to have met, and later returned together, apparently the
  worse for drink. That is the last we see of Reed. Next comes X, walking
  back&mdash;quite steadily, you notice&mdash;towards the river. Later, he
  returns; but this time, for some reason&mdash;perhaps to avoid the
  neighbourhood of the rick&mdash;he crosses the ditch at that gate, apparently
  to get on the road, though you see by the map that the road is much the
  longer route to the town. And now we had better get on and see if we can
  discover the rendezvous to and from which these two men went and came."</p>

  <p>As the plaster had now set quite hard I picked up the casts, and when I
  had carefully packed them in the case we resumed our progress riverwards. I
  had already noticed, some distance ahead, the mast of what looked like a
  small cutter yacht standing up above the marshes, and I now drew Thorndyke's
  attention to it. But he had already observed it and, like me, had marked it
  as the probable rendezvous of the two men. In a few minutes the probability
  became a certainty, for a bend in the creek showed us the little
  vessel&mdash;with the name Moonbeam newly painted on the bow&mdash;made fast
  alongside a small wooden staging; and when we reached this the bare earth
  opposite the gangway was seen to be covered with the foot-prints of both
  men.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said I, "which of them was the owner of the yacht."</p>

  <p>"It is pretty obvious, I think," said Thorndyke, "that X was the owner if
  either of them was. He came to the yacht alone, and he wore rubber-soled
  shoes such as yachtsmen favour; whereas Reed came when the other man was
  there, and he wore iron boot-protectors, which no yacht owner would do if he
  had any respect for his deck-planks. But they may have had a joint interest;
  appearances suggest that they were painting the woodwork when they were here
  together, as some of the paint is fresh and some of it old and shabby." He
  gazed at the yacht reflectively for some time and then remarked: "It would be
  interesting&mdash;and perhaps instructive&mdash;to have a look at the
  inside."</p>

  <p>"It would be a flagrant trespass, to put it mildly," said I.</p>

  <p>"It would be more than trespass if that padlock is locked," he replied.
  "But we need not take a pedantic view of the legal position. My learned
  friend has a serviceable pair of glasses and commands an unobstructed view of
  a mile or so; and if he maintains an observant attitude while I make an
  inspection of the premises any trifling irregularity will be of no
  consequence." As he spoke he felt in his pocket and produced the instrument
  which our laboratory assistant, Polton, had made from a few pieces of stiff
  steel wire, and which was euphemistically known as a smoker's companion. With
  this appliance in his hand he dropped down on to the yacht's deck, and after
  a quick look round, tried the padlock. Finding it locked he proceeded to
  operate on it with the smoker's companion, and in a few moments it fell open,
  when he pushed back the sliding hatch and stepped down into the little
  cabin.</p>

  <p>His exploration did not take long. In a few minutes he reappeared and
  climbed the short ladder to the staging. "There isn't much to see," he
  reported, "but what there is is highly suggestive. If you slip down and have
  a look round, I think you will have no difficulty in forming a plausible
  reconstruction of the recent events. You had better take the camera. There is
  light enough for a time exposure."</p>

  <p>I handed him the glasses, and dropping on to the deck, stepped down
  through the open hatch into the cabin. It was an absurd little cave, barely
  four feet high from the floor to the coach-roof, open to the fore-peak and
  lighted by a little skylight and two portholes. Of the two sleeping berths,
  one had evidently been used as a seat, while the other appeared to have been
  slept in, to judge by the indented pillow and the tumbled blankets, left just
  as the occupant had crawled out of them. But the whole interior was in a
  stale of squalid disorder. Paint-pots and unwashed brushes lay about the
  floor, in company with a couple of whisky-bottles&mdash;one empty and one
  half-full&mdash;two tumblers, a pair of empty siphons and a litter of playing
  cards scattered broadcast and evidently derived from two packs. It was, as
  Thorndyke had said, easy to reconstruct the scene of sordid debauchery that
  the light of the two candles&mdash;each in its congealed pool of
  grease&mdash;must have displayed on that night of horror whose dreadful
  secret had been disclosed by the ashes of the rick. But I could see nothing
  that would enable me to give a name to the dead man's mysterious
  companion.</p>

  <p>When I had completed my inspection and taken a photograph of the interior,
  I rejoined Thorndyke, who then descended and replaced the padlock on the
  closed hatch, relocking it with the invaluable smoker's companion.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jervis," said he, as we turned our faces towards the town, "it
  seems as if we had accomplished our task, so far as Stalker is concerned. It
  is still possible that this was a case of suicide, but it is no longer
  probable. All the appearances point to homicide. I think my learned friend
  will agree with me in that."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," I replied. "And to me there is a strong suggestion of
  premeditation. I take it that X, the owner of the yacht, enticed Reed out
  here, possibly to prepare for a cruise; that the two men worked at the
  repainting while the daylight lasted and then spent the evening drinking and
  gambling. The fact that they used several packs of cards suggests that they
  played for pretty heavy stakes. Then, I think, Reed became drunk and X
  offered to see him safely off the marshes. It is evident that X was not
  drunk, because, although both tracks appear unsteady when the men were
  walking together, the tracks of X returning to the yacht are quite steady and
  straight. I should say that the actual murder took place just after they had
  got over the gate; that Reed's false teeth fell out while his body was being
  dragged to the rick, and that this was unnoticed by X owing to the darkness.
  Then X dragged the body up the ladder and laid it in the middle of the rick
  at the top, set fire to the rick&mdash;probably on the lee side-and at once
  made off back to the yacht. There he passed the night, and in the morning he
  returned to the town along the road, giving the neighbourhood of the rick a
  wide berth. That is my reading of the evidence."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "that seems to be the interpretation of the facts.
  And now all that remains is to give a name to the mysterious X, and I should
  think that will present no difficulties."</p>

  <p>"Are you proposing to inspect the remains at the mortuary?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "It would be interesting, but it is not necessary. We
  have all the available data for identification, and our concern is now not
  with Reed but with X. We had better get back to London."</p>

  <p>On our arrival at the station, we found the bookstall keeper in the act of
  sticking up a placard of the evening paper on which was the legend: "Rick
  tragedy; Sensational development."</p>

  <p>We immediately provided ourselves each with a copy of the paper, and
  sitting down on a seat, proceeded to read the heavily-leaded report.</p>

  <p>"A new and startling aspect has been given to the rick tragedy by some
  further inquiries that the police have made. It seems that the dead man,
  Reed, was a member of the firm of Reed and Jarman, outside brokers, and it
  now transpires that his partner, Walter Jarman, is also missing. There has
  been no one at the office this week, but the caretaker states that on Monday
  evening at about eight o'clock, he saw Mr. Jarman let himself into the office
  with his key (the rick was first seen to be on fire at two o'clock on Monday
  morning). It appears that three cheques, payable to the firm and endorsed by
  Jarman, were paid into the bank&mdash;Patmore's&mdash;by the first post on
  Tuesday morning, and that, also on Tuesday morning, Jarman purchased a parcel
  of diamonds of just over a thousand pounds in value from a diamond merchant
  in Hatton Garden, who accepted a cheque in payment after telephoning to the
  bank. It further appears that on the previous Saturday morning, Reed and
  Jarman visited the bank together and drew out in cash practically their whole
  balance, leaving only thirty-two pounds. The diamond merchant's cheque was
  met by the cheques that had just been paid in. It is premature to make any
  comments, but we may expect some strange disclosures at the inquest, which
  will be held at Dartford the day after to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I assume," said I, "that the identity of X is no longer a mystery. It
  looks as if these two men had agreed to realise their assets and abscond, and
  had then spent the night gambling for the swag, and, oddly enough, Reed
  appears to have been the winner, for otherwise there would have been no need
  to murder him."</p>

  <p>"That is so," Thorndyke agreed, "assuming that X is Jarman, which is
  probable, though not certain. But we mustn't go beyond our facts, and we
  mustn't construct theories from newspaper reports. I think we had better call
  at Scotland Yard on our way home and verify those particulars."</p>

  <p>The report and our own observations occupied us during the journey to
  London, though our discussion produced no further conclusions. As soon as we
  arrived at Charing Cross, Thorndyke sprang out of the train, and emerging
  from the station, walked swiftly towards Whitehall.</p>

  <p>Our visit was fortunately timed, for as we approached the entrance to the
  head-quarters, our old friend, Superintendent Miller, came out. He smiled as
  he saw us and halted to utter the laconic query:</p>

  <p>"Rick Case?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "We have come to verify the particulars given in
  the evening paper. Have you seen the report?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; and you may take it as correct. Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"I should have liked to look over a series of the cheques drawn by the
  firm. The last two, I suppose, are inaccessible?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. They will be at the bank, and we couldn't inspect them without an
  order of the court. But, as to the others, if they are at the office, I think
  you could see them. I'll come along with you now if you like, and have a look
  round myself. Our people are in possession."</p>

  <p>We at once closed with the superintendent's offer and proceeded with him
  by the Underground Railway to the Mansion House, from whence we made our way
  to Queen Victoria Street, where Reed and Jarman had their offices. A sergeant
  was in charge at the moment, and to him the superintendent addressed
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Have you found any returned cheques?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied the sergeant; "lots of 'em. We've been through them
  all."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he produced several bundles of cheques and laid them on a
  desk, the drawers of which all stood open.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, "there they are, doctor. I don't know what you want
  to find out, but I expect you do." He placed a chair by the desk, and as
  Thorndyke sat down and proceeded to turn the cheques over, he watched him
  with politely-suppressed curiosity.</p>

  <p>"It appears," said Thorndyke, "as if these two men had mixed up their
  private affairs with the business account. Here, for instance, is a cheque
  drawn by Reed for the Picardy Wine Company. But that company could hardly
  have been a client. And this one of Jarman's for the Secretary of the St.
  John's Nursing Home must be a private cheque, and so I should say are these
  two for F. Waller, Esq., F.R.C.S., and for Andrew Darton, Esq., L.D.S. They
  are drawn for professional men and both are&mdash;like the Nursing Home
  cheque&mdash;stated in even amounts of guineas, whereas the business cheques
  are in uneven amounts of pounds, shillings and pence."</p>

  <p>"I think you are right, sir," said Miller. "The business seems to have
  been conducted in a very casual manner. And just look at those signatures!
  Never twice alike. The banks hate that sort of thing, naturally. When a
  customer signs in the signature book he has given a specimen for reference
  and he ought to keep to it strictly. A man who varies his signature is asking
  for trouble."</p>

  <p>"He is," Thorndyke agreed, as he rapidly entered a few particulars of the
  cheques in his notebook; "particularly in the case of a firm with a staff of
  clerks."</p>

  <p>He stood up, and having pocketed his notebook, held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged to you, superintendent," he said.</p>

  <p>"Seen all that you wanted to see?" Miller asked.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, yes," Thorndyke replied.</p>

  <p>"I should very much like to know what you have seen," Miller rejoined; to
  which my colleague replied by waving his hand towards the cheques, as he
  turned to go.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see the bearing of those cheques on our inquiry," I said,
  as we took our way homeward along Cheapside.</p>

  <p>"It is not very direct," Thorndyke replied, "but the cheques help us to
  understand the characters of these two men and their relations with one
  another; which may be very necessary when we come to the inquest."</p>

  <p>During the following day I saw very little of Thorndyke, for our excursion
  to Dartford had put our work somewhat in arrear and we had to secure a free
  day for the inquest on the morrow. We met at dinner after the day's work,
  but, beyond settling the programme for the next day nothing of importance
  passed with reference to the "Rick Case."</p>

  <p>The opening phases of the inquest, though of thrilling interest to the
  numerous spectators and Press men, did not particularly concern us. The
  evidence of the rural constable, the farmer and the police
  inspector&mdash;with whom Thorndyke had a little confidential talk and
  apparently surprised the officer considerably&mdash;merely amplified what we
  knew already. Of more interest was that of a local dentist who testified to
  having examined the dental plate and to having compared it with the skull of
  the dead man. "The plate and the jaw of deceased," he said, "agree
  completely. The jaw contains five natural teeth in two groups, and the plate
  has two spaces which exactly correspond to those two groups of teeth. I have
  tried the plate on the jaw and have no doubt whatever that it belonged to
  deceased."</p>

  <p>"That is a very important fact," Thorndyke remarked to me as the witness
  retired. "It is the indispensable link in the chain."</p>

  <p>"But surely it was obvious?" said I.</p>

  <p>"No doubt," he replied. "But now it is proved and in evidence."</p>

  <p>I was somewhat puzzled by Thorndyke's remark, but the appearance of a new
  witness forbade discussion. Mr. Arthur Gerrard was an alert-looking, rather
  tall man, with bushy, Mephistophelian eyebrows and a small, dark moustache,
  who wore a pair of large bifocal spectacles, and to whom a small mole at the
  corner of the mouth imparted the effect of a permanent one-sided smile.</p>

  <p>"It was on your information," said the coroner, "that the identity of the
  deceased was established."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the witness, who spoke with a slight, but perceptible,
  Irish accent. "I saw the description in the papers of the things that had
  been found in the rick and at once recognised them as Reed's. I knew deceased
  intimately and had often noticed his peculiar watch-chain and the little
  china mascot and seen him smoking the clay pipe with his initials scratched
  on it; and I knew that he wore false teeth."</p>

  <p>"Did you meet him frequently?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. For more than a year he was my partner in business, and we
  remained friends after I had dissolved the partnership."</p>

  <p>"Why did you dissolve the partnership?"</p>

  <p>"I had to. Reed was impossible in a business sense. He gambled incessantly
  in stocks and I had to pay his losses. I lent him, for this purpose, at one
  time and another, over two thousand pounds. He gave me bills for the loans,
  but he was never able to meet them, and in the end, when we dissolved, I got
  him to insure his life for three thousand pounds and to draw up a document
  making his debt to me the first charge on his estate in the event of his
  death."</p>

  <p>"Had you ever any reason to suppose that he contemplated suicide?</p>

  <p>"None whatever. After he left me, he entered into partnership with a Mr.
  Walter Jarman, and whenever I met him, he seemed to be quite happy and
  contented, though I gathered that he was still gambling a good deal. I saw
  him a week ago to-day and he then told me that he proposed to take a short
  yachting holiday with his partner, who owned a small cutter. That was the
  last time that I saw him alive."</p>

  <p>As the witness was about to retire, Thorndyke rose, and having obtained
  the coroner's permission to cross-examine, asked: "You have spoken of a
  yacht. Do you know what her name is and where she has been kept lately?"</p>

  <p>"Her name is the Moonbeam, and I believe Jarman kept her somewhere in the
  Thames, but I don't know where."</p>

  <p>"And as to Jarman himself: what do you know about him, as to his
  character, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"I knew him very slightly. He appeared to be rather a dissipated man.
  Drank a good deal, I should say, and I think he was a bit of a gambler."</p>

  <p>"Do you know if he was a heavy smoker?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't smoke at all, but he was an inveterate snuff-taker."</p>

  <p>At this point the foreman of the jury interposed with the audible remark
  that "he didn't see what this had to do with the inquiry," and the coroner
  looked dubiously at Thorndyke; but as my colleague sat down, the objection
  was not pursued.</p>

  <p>The next witness was the caretaker of the building in which Reed and
  Jarman's office was situated. His evidence was to the effect that on the
  previous Monday evening at about eight o'clock, he saw Mr. Jarman let himself
  into the office with his key. "I don't know how long he stayed there," he
  continued, in reply to the coroner's question. "I had finished my work and
  was going up to my rooms at the top of the building. I didn't see him
  again."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice anything unusual in his appearance?" asked Thorndyke,
  rising to cross-examine. "Was his face at all flushed, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't say. I was going up the stairs and I just looked back over my
  shoulder when I heard him. His face was turned away from me."</p>

  <p>"But you had no difficult in recognising him?"</p>

  <p>"No: I should have known him a mile off. He had his overcoat on, and it is
  a very peculiar overcoat&mdash;light brown with a sort of greenish check. You
  couldn't possibly mistake it."</p>

  <p>"What should you say was Mr. Jarman's height?"</p>

  <p>"About five feet nine or ten, I should say."</p>

  <p>Here the foreman of the jury again interposed. "Aren't we wasting time,
  sir?" he inquired impatiently. "These details about Jarman may be very
  important to the police, but they don't concern us. We are inquiring into the
  death of Mr. Reginald Reed."</p>

  <p>The coroner looked deprecatingly at Thorndyke and remarked, "There is some
  truth in what the foreman says."</p>

  <p>"I submit, sir," replied Thorndyke, "that there is no truth in it at all.
  We are not inquiring into the death of Reginald Reed, but into that of a man
  whose remains were found in a burned rick."</p>

  <p>"But the body has been identified as that of Reginald Reed."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "I submit that it has been wrongly identified. I
  suggest that the body is that of Walter Jarman and I am prepared to produce
  witnesses who will prove that it is."</p>

  <p>"But," exclaimed the coroner, "we have just heard the evidence of a
  witness who states that he saw Jarman alive eighteen hours after the rick was
  fired."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," said Thorndyke. "We have heard the witness say
  that he saw Jarman's overcoat. He expressly stated that he did not see the
  man's face."</p>

  <p>The coroner hastily conferred with the jury&mdash;who openly scoffed at
  Thorndyke's suggestion&mdash;and then said: "I find what you say perfectly
  incredible and so do the jury. It is utterly irreconcilable with the facts.
  You had better call your witnesses and let us dispose of this extraordinary
  suggestion."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke bowed to the coroner and called Mr. Andrew Darton; whereupon a
  middle-aged man of markedly professional aspect came forward and, having been
  sworn, gave evidence as follows: "I am a dental surgeon. A little over two
  years ago, Mr. Walter Jarman was under my care. I extracted some loose teeth
  from both jaws and made him two plates&mdash;an upper and a lower."</p>

  <p>"Could you identify those plates?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have with me the plaster model on which those plates were made."
  He opened a bag and produced a plaster cast of a pair of jaws fitted with a
  brass hinge so that the jaws could be opened and shut. On the upper jaw were
  two groups of teeth separated by a space of bare gums, while the lower jaw
  bore a single group of four front teeth.</p>

  <p>"This model," the witness explained, "is an exact replica of the patient's
  jaws, and the two plates were actually moulded on it." He picked up the
  dental plate from the table and, amidst a hush of breathless expectancy,
  opened the mouth of the model and applied the plate to the upper jaw. At a
  glance, it was obvious that it fitted perfectly. The two groups of the
  plaster teeth slipped exactly into the spaces on the plate, making a complete
  row of teeth. Then the witness covered the lower gums with strips of plastic
  wax, and taking the loose teeth from the table, attached them to the wax; and
  again the correspondence was evident. The teeth thus applied exactly filled
  the vacant spaces.</p>

  <p>"Can you now identify that plate?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply. "I am quite certain that this is the plate I made
  for Mr. Jarman and that those loose teeth are from his lower plate."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at the coroner, who nodded emphatically. "This evidence
  seems perfectly conclusive," he admitted. "What do you say, gentlemen?" he
  added, turning to the jury.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt as to their sentiments. With one voice they declared
  their complete conviction. Had they not seen the demonstration with their own
  eyes?</p>

  <p>"And now, sir," said the coroner, "as you appear to know more than anyone
  else about this case, and as it is perfectly incomprehensible to me, and
  probably also to the jury, I suggest that you give us an explanation. And you
  had better make it a sworn statement, so that it can go into the
  depositions."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, "especially as I have some evidence to give." He
  was accordingly sworn and then proceeded to make the following statement:</p>

  <p>"The first thing that struck me on reading the report of this case was the
  very remarkable character of the objects found in the ashes of the rick. They
  included objects composed of platinum, of pipe-clay, of iron and of
  porcelain&mdash;all substances practically indestructible by fire. And these
  imperishable objects were all highly distinctive and easily identifiable, and
  two of them actually bore the initials of their owner. There was almost a
  suggestion of the body having been prepared for identification after burning.
  This mere suggestion, however, gave place to definite suspicion when I saw
  the dental plate. That plate presented a most striking discrepancy. Here it
  is, sir, and you see that it is a clean polished plate of red vulcanite, with
  not a trace of stain or discoloration. But associated with that plate were
  two clay pipes. Now, the man who smokes a clay pipe is not only&mdash;as a
  rule&mdash;a heavy smoker, but he smokes strong and dark-coloured tobacco.
  And if he wears a dental plate, that plate becomes encrusted with a black
  deposit which is very difficult to remove. There is, as you see, no trace of
  any such deposit, or of any tobacco stain in the interstices of the teeth. It
  appeared to be almost certainly the plate of a non-smoker. But if that were
  so, it could not be Reed's. But it had been ascertained by the police surgeon
  that it fitted the jaw of the skull and undoubtedly belonged to the burned
  body. Consequently if the plate was not Reed's plate, the skull was not
  Reed's skull, and the body was not Reed's body. But the watch-chain was
  Reed's, the pipes were his and the mascot was his. That is to say that the
  very identifiable and fire-proof property of Reed was associated with the
  burned body of some other person; that, in other words, the body of some
  unknown person had been deliberately prepared to counterfeit the body of
  Reed. This offered a further suggestion and raised a question. The suggestion
  was that the unknown person had been murdered&mdash;presumably somewhere near
  the spot where the dental plate was found. The question was&mdash;What was
  the object of causing the body to counterfeit that of Reed?</p>

  <p>"Now, I knew, from the insurance company, that Reed had insured his life
  for three thousand pounds. Therefore, somebody stood to gain three thousand
  pounds by his death. The question was&mdash;Who was that somebody? I
  proceeded to make certain investigations on the spot;"&mdash;and here
  Thorndyke gave a summary of our discoveries on the marsh and on the yacht.
  "It thus appeared," he continued, "that there were two men on the marshes
  that night, going towards the rick. One of them was the person whose body was
  found in the ashes; the other, who went back alone to the yacht, was
  presumably the person who stood to gain three thousand pounds by Reed's
  death."</p>

  <p>"Have you formed any opinion as to who that person was?" the coroner
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "I have very little doubt that he was Reginald
  Reed."</p>

  <p>"But," exclaimed the coroner, "we have heard in evidence that it was Mr.
  Arthur Gerrard who stood to gain the three thousand pounds!"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Thorndyke; and for a while he and the coroner looked at
  one another without speaking.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the latter cast a searching look around the court. "Where is Mr.
  Gerrard?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"He left the court about ten minutes ago," said Thorndyke; "and a police
  inspector left immediately afterwards. I had advised him not to lose sight of
  Mr. Gerrard."</p>

  <p>"Then I take it that you suspect Gerrard of being in collusion with
  Reed?"</p>

  <p>"I suspect that Arthur Gerrard and Reginald Reed are one and the same
  person."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke made this statement, a murmur of astonishment arose from the
  jurymen and the spectators. The coroner, after a few moments' puzzled
  reflection, remarked: "You are not forgetting that Reed's caretaker was
  present while Gerrard was giving his evidence?" Then, turning to the
  caretaker, he asked: "What do you say? Was that Mr. Reed who gave evidence
  under the name of Gerrard?"</p>

  <p>The caretaker, who had evidently been thinking furiously, was by no means
  confident. "I should say not," he replied, "unless he was made up a good
  deal. He was certainly about the same height and build and colour; but he had
  a moustache, whereas Mr. Reed was clean-shaved; he had a mole on his face,
  which Mr. Reed hadn't; he had bushy eyebrows, whereas Mr. Reed had hardly any
  eyebrows to speak of; and he wore spectacles, which Mr. Reed didn't, and he
  spoke like an Irishman, whereas Mr. Reed was English. Still it is
  possible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Before he could finish, the door rattled to a heavy concussion. Then it
  flew open, and Mr. Gerrard staggered into the room, thrust forward by the
  police inspector. His appearance was marvellously changed, for he had lost
  his spectacles, and one of his eyebrows had disappeared, as had also the mole
  and a portion of the built-up moustache. The caretaker started up with an
  exclamation, but at this moment Gerrard, with a violent effort, wrenched
  himself free. The inspector sprang forward to recapture him. But he was too
  late. The prisoner's hand flew upwards; there was a ringing report; and
  Arthur Gerrard&mdash;or Reginald Reed&mdash;fell back across a bench with a
  trickle of blood on his temple and a pistol still clutched in his hand.</p>

  <p>"And so," said Stalker, when he called on us the next day for details, "it
  was a suicide after all. Very lucky, too, seeing that there was no provision
  in the policy for death by judicial hanging."</p>
