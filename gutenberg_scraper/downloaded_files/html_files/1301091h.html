  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">APART from numerous novels, most of which are accessible
  on-line at Project Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library, Fred M.
  White published some 300 short stories. Many of these were written in the
  form of series about the same character or group of characters. PGA/RGL has
  already published e-book editions of those series currently available in
  digital form.</p>

  <p>The present 17-volume edition of e-books is the first attempt to offer the
  reader a more-or-less comprehensive collection of Fred M. White's other short
  stories. These were harvested from a wide range of Internet resources and
  have already been published individually at Project Gutenberg Australia, in
  many cases with digitally-enhanced illustrations from the original medium of
  publication.</p>

  <p>From the bibliographic information preceding each story, the reader will
  notice that many of them were extracted from newspapers published in
  Australia and New Zealand. Credit for preparing e-texts of these and numerous
  other stories included in this collection goes to Lyn and Maurie Mulcahy, who
  contributed them to PGA in the course of a long and on-going
  collaboration.</p>

  <p>The stories included in the present collection are presented
  chronologically according to the publication date of the medium from which
  they were extracted. Since the stories from Australia and New Zealand
  presumably made their first appearance in British or American periodicals,
  the order in which they are given here does not correspond to the actual
  order of first publication.</p>

  <p>This collection contains some 170 stories, but a lot more of Fred M.
  White's short fiction was still unobtainable at the time of compilation
  (March 2013). Information about the "missing stories" is given in a
  bibliographic note at the end of this volume. Perhaps they can be included in
  supplemental volumes at a later date.</p>

  <p>Good reading!</p>

  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1">1.&mdash;THE MAN WHO GOT THROUGH</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY FRANK GILLETT</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. LXI, Feb 1925, pp
  297-303</h3><br>

  <p class="first">WHAT his real name was, it doesn't matter. There were one or
  two cynical inhabitants of Nagaska who averred that he did not know himself;
  but that was a libel, though uttered in no carping or ungenerous spirit, for
  the man who was known as Jim Baxter was a long way the most popular person in
  that little community on the fringe of the North-West Frontier, where they
  farmed in a casual sort of way in accordance with the almanack, and a few of
  the more adventurous spirits did a little mild silver mining.</p>

  <p>It was a sort of Sleepy Hollow, that little neck of valley between two
  ranges of mountains, and there life moved slowly, for they were a contented
  race, earning just what they wanted and no more, content to let the world go
  by as long as the snows were not too severe and a plentiful supply of
  firewood was to be had for the asking. Papers came to the little settlement
  occasionally, but if they failed to materialise from the station eight miles
  away, nobody troubled and nobody cared. Now and again they heard stories of
  crime and outrage, and on one occasion a notorious malefactor had invaded the
  settlement in search of food, and with the North-West Police hot upon his
  track. He had not looked in the least like the popular villain depicted by a
  highly-coloured press&mdash;in fact, he was insignificantly small, very
  ragged and dirty, and he had made no effort to hold up a peaceful community
  at the business end of a revolver. On the contrary, he had crawled almost on
  his hands and knees, and had begged for food like some harmless tramp, so
  that even the children had gathered round him quite fearlessly and without a
  shadow of hesitation. Still, he was a desperado, as his record showed, and,
  when the time came, put up an exceedingly pretty fight, during which two of
  the North-West Police had been severely wounded. But in the eyes of the
  people of Nagaska he had appeared more like a cat driven to bay by half a
  dozen dogs. And that, so far as the oldest inhabitant could remember, was the
  only bit of excitement Sleepy Hollow had ever seen.</p>

  <p>But all this, of course, has nothing to do with Jim Baxter. He had drifted
  there eight or nine years ago, a tall, powerful man dressed in grey tweeds of
  a pattern unknown to Nagaska, though when Phillips, local superintendent of
  the North-West Police, first set eyes on him, he muttered something to
  himself that sounded like "Bond Street." For Phillips was an Englishman of
  family and a man of some means, and he belonged to the North-West Force only
  out of sheer love of the hardy life and an unholy thirst for adventure. He
  tried, in his genial, courteous way, to find out something about Jim Baxter,
  but that individual was not to be drawn. He admitted freely enough that he
  was an Englishman, and that there were powerful family reasons why it had
  become necessary for him to turn his back abruptly upon the land of his
  birth, to all of which Phillips listened sympathetically enough, though when
  he asked Jim whether he had ever worn His Majesty's uniform, the latter
  coloured up and reminded Phillips quite politely that there were limits to
  ordinary curiosity.</p>

  <p>"All right, my friend," Phillips had said. "I don't want to barge in. But,
  you see, I am responsible for law and order in this part of the world, and I
  like to know as much as possible about newcomers."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Jim had replied. "I'm not a criminal and I'm not
  exactly a pauper&mdash;that is, I have enough to keep myself in clothes and
  food and an occasional glass of whisky."</p>

  <p>With that the conversation came to an end, and Phillips went his way, with
  the intention of keeping his eye upon the stranger. But there was really no
  occasion, for the months went by and the years rolled on without any outbreak
  on the part of Jim Baxter, who settled down in the little community as if he
  would like to stay there all the days of his life. He did nothing except lend
  a hand occasionally up there in one of the small silver mines, but this was
  more to kill time than anything else.</p>

  <p>He built himself a shack, where he spent most of his day
  reading&mdash;indeed, Jim's big box of books had given him quite the
  reputation of a scholar in those parts. But they were novels, for the most
  part, English classics ranging from Richardson down to Kipling, with a
  sprinkling of French literature. And with these for his sole companions Jim
  Baxter lived quite contentedly for upwards of nine years.</p>

  <p>Not that he was, even in the slightest sense, a recluse. To begin with, he
  was exceedingly popular with the small handful of children there, who ran in
  and out of his shack at all times of the day without the slightest fear or
  hesitation. They would drop in to dinner or tea or supper, when Jim would
  tell them stories and see them safely home afterwards.</p>

  <p>He was a familiar figure in the saloon, where it was said that he could
  hold more Canadian whisky than any two men in the settlement, which was no
  libel, though no man in that congenial company had ever seen Jim the worse
  for liquor during the nine years he had been there. He was a past master in
  the art of chaff and repartee, a big, easy-going, genial giant of a man who
  spent his money freely and apparently had no enemy in the world.</p>

  <p>Whence he derived his means, no one knew, and no one particularly cared.
  Once a month he repaired regularly to Fort Falcon, the trading station some
  six miles away, where the police had their headquarters, and whence came
  supplies of all sorts upon which Nagaska depended. There he would transact
  certain business at the bank, and come back with his pockets full of dollar
  notes, which apparently lasted him for a month to the very hour. If there was
  anything of the man of action about him, he disguised it carefully, for
  apparently a more indolent man never breathed. And so things had drifted on
  for the best part of a decade, and it looked as if Jim had settled down to
  live and die there, when the thing happened that stirred Nagaska to its
  depths and brought it face to face with a peril which nobody had ever
  anticipated, but which was dire enough in all conscience. It was one of those
  bolts from the blue that swooped down out of a clear sky in the twinkling of
  an eye.</p>

  <p>It was rather late autumn, a red and flaming autumn touched with gold,
  with just a touch of frost in the air to warn the people in the settlement of
  what was coming, so that outdoor workers pushed on in the usual leisurely
  way, the wood for the winter was gathered in, and the few odd animals
  belonging to the inhabitants had come back to the stables. A little later on
  the snows would come down in earnest, and for the next few months the little
  community of Nagaska would be cut off from the rest of the world, to sleep
  and hibernate, and eat and drink like so many squirrels till the spring thaw
  came and they could get into touch with civilisation once more. But this was
  entirely in accordance with the ordinary course of things, and so long as the
  little garrison was provisioned for the winter, nothing mattered.</p>

  <p>There would be plenty doing in the course of a week or two, when every
  man, woman and child would be pressed into the service of the State, and
  every horse and vehicle busy on the road between Nagaska and the Fort. It was
  characteristic of the inhabitants that this was always left to the last
  moment, which mattered very little, because they knew almost to a day when
  the first fall of snow would take place. At least, that was the easy
  philosophy of the place, and they all acted up to it religiously. It never
  seemed to occur to anybody that one of these years Our Lady of the Snows
  might take it into her head to come down in her white and shining beauty a
  week or two before the annual advent of her court, in which case it might go
  mighty hard with Nagaska. It never had occurred to anybody, and by the same
  process of reasoning it never would, which is a form of philosophy not
  entirely confined to rude communities.</p>

  <p>And, curiously enough, it was Jim, of all men, who raised the very point
  one evening soon after the frost came, as he lounged on an empty apple barrel
  in the saloon, with a glass of whisky in his hand, What would happen, he
  wanted to know, if the big snow came down suddenly?</p>

  <p>"It never has," the oldest inhabitant said, "and, consequently, never
  will."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but suppose it does?" Jim persisted. "It isn't impossible,
  Methuselah."</p>

  <p>"Nothing's impossible in this world," the old man said solemnly, "but
  that's very near it."</p>

  <p>"Very likely," Jim agreed. "But it might come&mdash;the big snow, I mean,
  when you couldn't get to the Fort perhaps for a fortnight."</p>

  <p>"There's enough here to go on with," another optimist said, "enough for a
  fortnight."</p>

  <p>"And after that you'd starve," Jim went on.</p>

  <p>"Guess we should," another philosopher put in.</p>

  <p>"But suppose there was nothing here," Jim returned to the point. "It's
  only a wooden shack, after all, and there are at least fifty barrels of
  petroleum out there. Supposing the saloon caught fire? It wouldn't last a
  quarter of an hour. And what should we all do then?"</p>

  <p>The conversation was growing uncomfortable; it was felt by the slow-witted
  opportunists about the stove that Jim was trespassing on the debatable lands
  of good taste. So they bade him fill his glass again and talk about something
  else, which, in his amiable, obliging manner, he did. Then they went their
  way presently, each to his shack to sleep and dream and give no heed to the
  morrow. A big wind had got up during the evening, a raging gale from the
  north-east, with the smell of the snow in it, so that they were all eager
  enough to get under cover and feel the warmth in their bones again.</p>

  <p>But not for long. For presently out there in the clearing appeared a spark
  or two of light, then a tongue of flame and a quick roar of a conflagration.
  Presently there was a report that shook the whole settlement, so that the men
  came hurrying out, hastily wrapping themselves in their skins, to see what
  convulsion of Nature had taken place.</p>

  <p>And there was the saloon one blaze of fire. The flames ate up the dry wood
  greedily, they raced from beam to beam and room to room until presently they
  reached the barrels of petroleum in the sheds behind. Then followed a great
  sheet of dazzling fire, the roar of an explosion, and the place where the
  store had stood was just no more than a big handful of glowing ashes. The
  whole thing was over in a few minutes. Fortunately no lives had been lost,
  but beyond the small amount of food in every shack, not another mouthful
  remained in the settlement. Men talked over the calamity in low voices as
  they stood there, with heads down in the piercing gale, and muttered of what
  they would have to do on the morrow to make this thing good. It would be a
  case of all hands to the pump, so to speak, with every man and every animal
  on their way to the Fort in search of food. And with this decision uppermost,
  and with the houseless saloon keeper and his wife accommodated for the night,
  one and all turned their backs on the soul-searching gale and burrowed into
  their shacks like so many rabbits.</p>

  <p>It was bitterly, bitterly cold, far colder than it ought to have been at
  that time of the year, and the voice of the snow was singing in the air.
  There would undoubtedly be a fall before morning, not heavy, perhaps, but it
  was coming, and Jim Baxter, as he turned into his buffalo skins, asked
  himself an uneasy question or two. It seemed strange that this calamity
  should befall within an hour or so of the discussion in the saloon. And if it
  did come in real earnest, then assuredly the little community at Nagaska was
  face to face with starvation. Then Jim put the matter out of his mind and
  went to sleep.</p>

  <p>He woke up the following morning to the realisation of a white world. For
  a time, at least, it seemed to him, in a dim, uncomprehending sort of way,
  that the dawn was long in coming, before the real truth came home to him.
  Then he saw that the windows were piled high with snow, he could hear the
  hiss against them, and when finally he dragged himself out of his skins, he
  saw stark tragedy lying there before him.</p>

  <p>For it was no herald of the coming winter that had come down on the gale
  in the still watches of the night, but the real thing itself&mdash;several
  feet of snow, with every sign of more to follow, and the north-west wind
  tearing round the house like a pack of angry wolves in search of their prey.
  It was intensely, bitterly cold, too&mdash;a freezing, biting cold that sent
  Jim headlong to the stove, where he piled up the logs and set about getting
  his breakfast.</p>

  <p>This he did in his usual calm, methodical way, eating his bacon slowly and
  deliberately, filling his pipe afterwards. He knew perfectly well what
  Nagaska was face to face with, and not for a moment did he try to belittle
  the danger. He knew that the lapse of a day or two would see the end of the
  last ounce of food in Nagaska. He knew that the people over there at the Fort
  would not trouble anything about the settlement, for had not the authorities
  there every reason to believe that the big store in the village was amply
  supplied for all immediate needs, at any rate? And for the moment Fort Falcon
  would be busy looking after itself.</p>

  <p>It was only a matter of six miles, but six miles of desolation and
  possible death for anyone who had the temerity to face the danger.</p>

  <p>All this Jim knew perfectly well, and he knew perfectly well what he was
  going to do. The thought did not trouble him in the least as he sat there
  before the stove, smoking his pipe until at length it was finished, after
  which, with considerable difficulty, he made his way down to the little
  building which was parish room or school house&mdash;in fact, anything
  according to the point of view of the inhabitants. And there, as he expected,
  he found a little handful of men gathered round the stove, discussing the
  situation deliberately, with reminiscences of similar happenings.</p>

  <p>There was no hurry, of course&mdash;nobody ever hurried in Nagaska. They
  would probably sit and talk and talk for hours. Jim stood there in the
  doorway, contemplating the ancient fathers with a humorous gleam in those
  sleepy eyes of his.</p>

  <p>"Pretty bad, isn't it?" he asked.</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"
     name="pic1"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1301091h-images/TheManWhoGotThrough1.jpg"
         title="'Pretty bad, isn't it?' he asked.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Well, I guess it is," the old man known as Methuselah drawled. "I've been
  here, man and boy, for nearly eighty years, and I disremember the big fall
  ever coming as early as this. And it is the big fall all right."</p>

  <p>"So it seems," Jim said drily. "But say, boys, did you ever have the big
  fall before you got the winter provisions in before,?"</p>

  <p>Old man Methuselah shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Never," he went on. "We always goes by the almanack, and it's never
  throwed us down before."</p>

  <p>"And you have never had a fire here before?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's an act of Providence," the old man said solemnly. "That's
  what it is &mdash;Providence."</p>

  <p>"Very likely," Jim agreed. "But I've always been told that Providence
  helps those who help themselves. Now, look here, boys, it's up to us to do
  something. They won't worry about us over at the Fort, because they'll
  conclude that we have got enough to go on with for a week or two. Of course
  they don't know the store is burnt down, else they'd make an effort to get
  through to us with a few loads of provisions. Seems to me we've got to get to
  them."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but how?" the old man asked. "It can't be done, Jim. There's no
  livin' man could face it. And, mind you, there's more to come, lots
  more."</p>

  <p>"And meanwhile?" Jim Baxter asked.</p>

  <p>The little group round the stove shifted uneasily. It was felt in a vague
  sort; of way that Jim was hustling, and anything of that sort was quite
  foreign to the ways and customs of the settlers in Nagaska, And yet there was
  not a single man there who did not realise the danger.</p>

  <p>"How long can you last out?" Jim went on.</p>

  <p>There were various opinions, more or less deliberately enunciated, but,
  generally speaking, it came out reluctantly enough that two days would see
  Nagaska on the verge of starvation. Jim beamed genially on the crowd.</p>

  <p>"That's just what I want to get at," he said. "Now, we ain't going to
  starve&mdash;at least, the women and the kids ain't, if I've got anything to
  do with it. Somebody's got to go; the question is, who?"</p>

  <p>They looked at one another apprehensively, for there was not a man there
  who did not thoroughly understand the lurking perils that lay in every yard
  of that six miles of snow. They began to discuss it with one another in
  whispers; they told tales of lonely settlers cut off in snows less deep than
  this, who had lain down and died within rifle-shot of their own shacks. And
  then someone a little more enterprising than the rest suggested that they
  should draw lots for it.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's right," Methuselah said. "And you can put my name in the hat,
  too."</p>

  <p>"There's a fine old sportsman for you," Jim cried. "But there are not
  going to be any lots, not if I know myself. Listen to me, boys. Somebody's
  got to go, and there isn't one of you who is not married. You haven't all got
  children, but you've got wives. Now, I haven't either, not even relations in
  the proper sense of the word, and if anything happens to me I shan't be
  missed, except perhaps by the kiddies here. I'm a pretty useless sort of
  individual, but none of you have ever told me that. That's why I am going.
  And, what's more, I am going now. If I don't get there, you'll be no worse
  off, and if I do get there &mdash;well, I shall be no end bucked. So I'm
  going, whether you want me to or not."</p>

  <p>They tried to dissuade him, they protested that every man should take his
  chance alike, but in his genial way Jim talked the others down; and so
  presently, with all the village to see him off, he set out on his errand
  across that white world, with the powder stinging in his face, and the wind
  smiting in mighty blows as he turned his eyes, in the direction of the
  distant pine ridge beyond which Fort Falcon nestled like some hawk on its
  eyrie. The pine ridge was guide enough, so that for the next three hours he
  fought unsteadily through the snow, that here and there was waist-deep, until
  the shades of night began to fall, and he had made four miles of his journey.
  By this time he was amongst the pines, that tossed and moaned overhead like
  things in pain. He had been most of the day coming so far, and now that
  splendid animal strength of his was beginning to fail. He was realising that
  he was not quite the man he had taken himself for, and he somewhat
  whimsically wished that his reputation as a champion whisky drinker had been
  a little the less merited. By this time his lungs were roaring like a pair of
  bellows, his eyes were nearly blinded by the white glare, and he was going
  over at the knees.</p>

  <p>But still he struggled grimly and doggedly on, until at length he came, in
  the pitch darkness, to the crest of the ridge and between the flurries of
  snow looked down at the valley on the other side, where he could see the
  lights of Fort Falcon shining through the gloom. All this was encouraging
  enough, but, on the other hand, there were another two miles to go, and once
  Jim had put the shelter of the ridge behind him he encountered the full force
  of the gale.</p>

  <p>It turned him round more than once as if he had been no more than a piece
  of paper. The piercing cold stabbed him to the bone. More than once he
  dropped to his knees, absolutely exhausted and worn out; then he struggled to
  his feet again, clenching his teeth and fairly sobbing with rage and
  disappointment to find himself thus baulked and broken with the haven
  absolutely in sight.</p>

  <p>It was pitch dark by this time, so dark that he could only feel his way.
  He stumbled on mechanically down the slope until he was within half a mile of
  the Fort, where he collapsed altogether. He dragged himself slowly and
  painfully to the lee side of a hummock, where he was fain to lie down and
  rest. When he opened his eyes again, the sun was shining overhead, and the
  fury of the gale had abated. His hair and moustache were frozen to his face,
  and he had a curious sort of feeling that his ears were gone. He knew now
  that everything depended upon the final effort; he knew that he might win
  through, and he knew, too, that the end was near at hand as far as he was
  concerned. So on his hands and knees he crawled painfully along, until he
  fell in a huddled heap in front of the police station of the Fort. There he
  was picked up presently and carried into a room, where they laid him before
  the stove and tended him as carefully as if he had been a little child. They
  fed him and poured brandy down his throat, so that presently he came back to
  his senses again, and smiled to find that his efforts had not been in vain.
  Phillips was bending over him to catch the first words that came from his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Don't hurry," he said. "Take your time. Now, in the name of fortune,
  what's this madness, Jim?"</p>

  <p>Slowly and painfully Jim explained. When he had finished, the troop looked
  from one to another in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have believed it possible," Phillips said. "I don't think
  there is another man on the American Continent who could have done it."</p>

  <p>"That's good hearing," Jim panted. "At last I begin to realise what I was
  born for. Now, look here, Phillips, I'm done for. No, you needn't shake your
  head. I can see it in your face, and even if I couldn't I should know. You'll
  see to those people, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I will," Phillips said. "We'll get all the teams out and rush
  supplies over to Nagaska within an hour. If the snow holds off, there's
  nothing to be afraid of. The doctor will be here presently."</p>

  <p>Jim smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"Let him come if he likes," he said, "but I'm past all surgery. What's the
  good of pretending? You know it as well as I do."</p>

  <p>"Well, you're pretty bad," Phillips admitted.</p>

  <p>"I guess I am. I can hardly see you now."</p>

  <p>"Poor old chap!" Phillips said. "Is there anything I can do for you? Any
  message? Anybody I can write to? You know what I mean."</p>

  <p>Jim shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "There's nobody wants to hear from me; just say nothing and
  do nothing. Take my pocket-book, when I am dead, and destroy it, and that's
  about all."</p>

  <p>It was, for those were the last words Jim Baxter ever spoke. And there was
  nothing in the pocket-book of any account, or so Phillips said. And there the
  record ends, except in the hearts of Nagaska, whence it will never
  fade.</p><br>

     name="story2">2.&mdash;A BOOTLESS ERRAND</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in the <i>Western Mail</i>, Perth, Australia, 19 Mar
  1925</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE LONG, flower-decked balcony of Lady Barchester's house
  in Chesterton Place was the most intimate spot in London&mdash;a sort of
  tropical paradise snatched from the warm Southern Seas. In the purple,
  velvety darkness late on that perfect June night, two people were seated
  there.</p>

  <p>"This," Augustus Openshaw sighed, "is great."</p>

  <p>"But dangerous, darling," Angela Gilliland whispered. "If any of those
  dancers wandered in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Gus Openshaw smiled. "I got Betty Barchester to
  fasten the window behind us, so that there would he no chance of
  interruption."</p>

  <p>Angela Gilliland snuggled a little closer to the young man with the
  orange-hued hair and the golden freckles lavishly bestowed on that blunt,
  good-natured face of his. She was exceedingly fond of Gus, and none the less
  because she ought not to have been there at all. When a young man has to eke
  out a miserable existence on about a thousand a year, he has no right to
  entangle the affections of a beauty like Angela Gilliland, who in her own
  right was mistress of twenty times that sum. Not that it was anybody's affair
  but theirs and Mr. Benjamin Openshaw's, and thereby hangs a tale.</p>

  <p>Now, Mr. Benjamin Openshaw was not only Gus's uncle, but guardian to the
  fascinating young woman who at that moment was perched ecstatically on the
  fortunate young man's knee. They sat there talking over their troubles, and
  trying to find some scheme by which to avert the threatening danger, and put
  a spoke in the wheel of Mr. Openshaw's programme at the same time. And as Gus
  said, it took a bit of doing.</p>

  <p>"Now, look here, darling," he observed. "We can't go fooling on like this.
  Your father was a dear old chap, but he made a bit of a bloomer when he
  shoved all those dollars of his&mdash;I mean yours&mdash;into the hands of
  Uncle Ben. I ain't quarrelling with the idea of your money being tied up till
  you are twenty-five. Of course, we can wait for the next four years."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose we can, Gus," Angela sighed.</p>

  <p>Gus clicked his strong even teeth together as he thought of that fat,
  pompous old uncle of his, that elderly politician who still lived in hope
  that he might some day find himself endowed with Cabinet Rank. He was a heavy
  bore of the largest calibre, and he was the proud possessor of a son, another
  Gus, who was perhaps even a shade more serious and ponderous than his sire.
  And, quite within the bounds of honour, of course. Openshaw pere was
  exceedingly anxious to see the hope of his house allied to the dazzling
  beauty, and equally dazzling fortune of Miss Angela Gilliland.</p>

  <p>"Is there no one who can manage it, Gus, dear?" Angela asked almost
  tearfully. "If you could only make him ridiculous. If you could only wound
  his family pride. If you could hit him through that Hamlet-like offspring of
  his!"</p>

  <p>"That's a dashed good idea," Gus said. "Something in the public line, I
  mean, that gets in the newspapers. A stunt to make people laugh at him.
  Practical&mdash;or&mdash;got it!"</p>

  <p>"Got what?" Angela asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, the notion, the big idea. You know Jack Adair?"</p>

  <p>Of course, Angela knew Jack Adair, the popular clerk in the Foreign
  Office, who led all the theatricals and generally presided as a sort of
  master of ceremonies over the gaieties of their particular set, and who eked
  out a rather slender income as one of the staff of a popular daily paper.</p>

  <p>"Well, there you are then," Gus went on a little vaguely. "But Jack will
  do it, and he will see that it gets all the publicity it needs through the
  'Morning Herald.' But mind you, it's going to take a bit of time. Let me see,
  isn't my distinguished cousin at present quartered in Rome?"</p>

  <p>"British Embassy," Angela murmured. "In training for the Diplomatic
  Service, and all that."</p>

  <p>"Good," Gus cried. "The great work begins to-night. Now, don't ask a lot
  of questions. And trust me implicitly. I am going out like another Sir
  Galahad, O.B.E., to take the road for the sake of my lady's bright eyes."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later, Gus was closeted eagerly with that brilliant young man,
  Jack Adair, in a quiet comer of the inner drawing-room. Then they left the
  house together and parted with much laughter at the comer of the street.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, the young man with the saffron-coloured hair and gold
  freckles stood by the side of the Serpentine looking down into the placid
  water. He was beautifully turned out with a shining topper covering his
  flaming locks, and with a light overcoat unbuttoned that showed the gleaming
  expanse of his shirt and waistcoat. And then he did a strange thing. He
  stooped down deliberately, removed his glistening pumps, and proceeded to
  divest himself of a pair of lavender socks shot with gold. This done, he
  rolled these articles up into a tight ball, and threw them into the water. A
  minute or two later, he was strolling towards his quarters with an air of
  absolute unconcern, until at length he found himself in Piccadilly. There he
  came face to face with a stalwart policeman who eyed him with
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What's the gime?" the officer asked. "What are you playin' at? An' where
  are you goin'?"</p>

  <p>"John o' Groats," Gus said. "Do I turn to the right or left, or do I keep
  straight on?"</p>

  <p>"But what's the gime?" the man in blue repeated almost imploringly. "Look
  'ere, you'd better come along o' me and see the sergeant."</p>

  <p>"I decline," Gus said with dignity, "to see any sergeant. I am not
  interested in sergeants&mdash;they are the sort of people I have been in the
  habit of mixing with. My name is Openshaw, Augustus Openshaw. And if you
  don't happen to know it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Apparently the officer did, for his manner became a little more
  respectful.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," he went on. "It's no business of mine, of course, but I don't
  think, as Mr. Benjamin Openshaw will very much like it. And if you take my
  advice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At that moment another man in evening dress appeared upon the scene. With
  a twinkle in his eye, Gus recognised his inconsequent friend, Jack Adair. The
  latter stopped and regarded his confederate with a fine air of intense
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What, do you mean to say you are actually going on with it?" he cried.
  "Look here, come along with me."</p>

  <p>"I decline to come along with you," Gus said with dignity. "I have made a
  wager and I am going to carry it out. I am on my way to walk to Scotland, and
  if you will kindly tell me whether I turn to left or to right when I come to
  the end of the road, I shall be greatly obliged."</p>

  <p>Without a word, Adair put his hand through his friend's arm and led him
  away with the air of one who is humouring a fractious child. He winked at the
  policeman over his shoulder and significantly touched his forehead.</p>

  <p>"It works, old man, it works," Gus said. "I will tell you where to find me
  from time to time, but I don't think that I am going to walk quite all the
  way, and anyhow, I can manage to keep from permanent lameness if I carry a
  pair of running shoes in my tail coat pocket. Now, come inside and have a
  drink, and I will tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not on your life," Adair said. "It will take me all my time to reach the
  office of my rag if I am going to have that paragraph in all the editions
  tomorrow."</p>

  <p>The countless readers of the 'Morning Herald' saw that striking paragraph
  as they sat at breakfast in their luxurious suburban homes:</p>

  <p class="headline">AMAZING WAGER.<br>
  DRAMATIC SCENES IN PICCADILLY.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Early this morning a young man of distinguished
  appearance was discovered strolling down Piccadilly wearing immaculate
  evening dress, and in every way resplendent, save for the fact that he was
  entirely divested of footgear and socks. He explained to a bewildered
  policeman that he was engaged in a wager for an enormous sum to walk, just as
  he was, from Piccadilly Circus to the North of Scotland. We gather from our
  representative, who happened to be on the spot, that one of the conditions of
  the bet was that the journey should be accomplished in bare feet, and that
  the protagonist in question should wear nothing but evening kit, and that he
  should, thus apparelled, walk through every town that happened to be en
  route. This, our representative had first hand and, moreover, he elicited
  from the chief actor himself the fact that his name is Augustus Openshaw. We
  understand, therefore, that he is the only son of Mr. Benjamin Openshaw, the
  Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs who, we believe, is certain of Cabinet
  rank at an early date. Further particulars of this eccentric feat will appear
  in our later edition."</p>

  <p>For the moment, the political world was standing still, there were no
  complications on land and sea, no lurid, salacious divorce case penciling, so
  that the 'Morning Herald' made a feature of the ridiculous stunt which they
  regarded as all their own. And, other papers kindly copied. The enterprising
  Openshaw was located here and there, he was seen in this town and that,
  sturdily plodding his way north, and occasionally encountered on country
  roads, where he prudently removed his unspiked running shoes at the slightest
  sign of life coming in his direction. Also, strange to say, no word of
  indignant expostulation came from the head of the family. And Gus found
  himself troubled and worrying.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">The Right Honourable Benjamin, Openshaw had been absent for
  some time on the affairs of his country in Brussels. So, because he had not
  seen the English papers for so long, this terrible scandal had not approached
  his august presence. And then, when his work was finished, and he found
  himself with a little leisure, he turned eagerly to the British papers and
  read the whole horrible catastrophe in a state bordering on collapse.</p>

  <p>So the Right Honourable gentleman packed his traps and fled precipitously
  homewards, bent upon righting this terrible wrong and perhaps hushing up a
  scandal which threatened to ruin his political career. And the first person
  he met as he crossed his threshold was his erring son, in propria persona,
  looking mildly through his spectacles, and bleating in his accustomed
  manner.</p>

  <p>"This is a nice business!" Openshaw bellowed. "What do you mean by it,
  sir? What do you mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear father," the other Gus said mildly. "I am as much in the darkness
  as you are. I got an English paper in Rome some days ago, and directly I read
  the paragraph there, I hurried home as soon as possible. I can't understand
  it."</p>

  <p>A sudden, light illuminated the great statesman.</p>

  <p>"It's that rascally cousin of yours!" he breathed heavily. "One of those
  disgraceful practical jokes of his. A wager, perhaps. He would not give a
  thought to any position, or the due he owes to the family. I suppose
  Sommerson is here. Get him to telephone to your cousin and say he must come
  round here at once."</p>

  <p>Sommerson, deeply concerned, and anxious for his chief's political
  welfare, managed to find Gus at his club and returned a moment later with the
  information that the delinquent would be on view within the next half-hour.
  He came cheerfully enough, smilingly hailing the aged butler and apparently
  oblivious of the fact that Benjamin's late wife's sister and ruler of the
  household had deliberately turned her back upon him. He knew that Angela was
  in the house somewhere, but deemed it policy not to ask after her&mdash;at
  any rate for the moment. He strode across the hall into the sacred domain
  where Benjamin Openshaw composed those majestic speeches of his, and stood in
  the Presence entirely unabashed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know why I sent for you," Openshaw asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord&mdash;yes," Gus said cheerfully. "About that little stunt of
  mine. Upon my word, I am sorry. But, after all do you think that it really
  matters?"</p>

  <p>Openshaw fairly gasped.</p>

  <p>"Matters!" he echoed. "Do you know sir, that my whole political career is
  at stake&mdash;to say nothing of that of your unfortunate cousin? I have been
  made a laughing stock of, sir! And as the head of the family I have been held
  up to ridicule. Do you know that 'Punch' has had something to say about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"By Jove!&mdash;that is something like fame!" the recalcitrant Gus said
  cheerfully. "But why blame me?"</p>

  <p>"Why blame you? Why blame you? You did it on purpose,
  sir&mdash;deliberately to injure your cousin."</p>

  <p>"Here, steady on!" Gus said. "I didn't put that paragraph in the 'Morning.
  Herald.' I had to tell the police who I was, and they naturally jumped to the
  conclusion that I was your son. Of course, I know you don't care for these
  jokes, and in any case&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Joke, sir! Do you call it a joke? Some idiotic wager, I presume. The sort
  of amazing folly that you inconsequent idiots are always indulging in. It may
  be too late to save the family name, but at any rate, I can only try. You,
  sir, will have to make an abject apology. I order you immediately to write to
  that confounded paper, whose politics, by the way, are diametrically opposite
  to mine, and eat dust, sir!&mdash;eat dirt!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I think that is only fair," Gus said coolly. "I'll make as abject
  an apology, as you like. Fact is, I came prepared to do so. So if you will
  sling me over a pen and some paper&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Openshaw placed the desired material in front of his sinful relative, and
  Gus proceeded to write. If Mr. Openshaw had been less concerned with his own
  dignity and had been a little more observant than he was, he would have seen
  that Gus, who couldn't write three consecutive lines of prose to save his
  life, was getting on with amazing rapidity. He paused once in the flow of his
  splendid composition as if carefully polishing a period. As a matter of fact,
  Gus was what he would have called bunkered over his orthography, having been
  badly tripped by the word 'apology.' He finally decided to spell it with an
  'o,' and proceeded cheerfully on his florid way. Then, with a certain air of
  triumph, he tossed the sheet across the table.</p>

  <p>"There, what price that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>It was a humble enough apologia, as even the outraged statesman was fain
  to admit. It was quite sufficient that it would restore him in the eyes of
  his fellow-men, and place the other Gus back upon his pedestal of stolid
  British respectability.</p>

  <p>"Um!&mdash;very good!" the other man said. "Now, if you will sign that, I
  will see that it is duly posted. But I am not appeased yet, sir, I am not
  appeased yet. You will be good enough to abstain from coming here in future,
  and you and Miss Gilliland&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gus looked up suddenly with a fighting light in his eyes. He might have
  been confronted with a long putt on the last green for the match and the
  championship. His Irish hair gleamed in the sunshine filtering through the
  window, and his mouth grey hard.</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," he said. "I see what you are driving at. But, look here,
  there are conditions. If I like to make a wager to walk to Land's End on my
  hands, it is nothing to do with you. And if newspapers like to make mistakes
  in people's identity, then it is no concern of mine. Now listen, uncle, I
  have known Angela all my life, and I have been dead keen on her ever since
  she was a kid with pigtails. And I am going to marry her. I am going to marry
  her with your consent or not. I know you can hold her money over for the next
  four years, but we can manage on my thousand quid per annum. Take a cottage
  near some decent golf links, and do with one servant. We have talked it
  over."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have, have you? And perhaps you have considered the
  consequences."</p>

  <p>"Consequences. What consequences?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;let us say offspring," Openshaw suggested.</p>

  <p>"Topping," Gus said delightedly. "By Gad, I never thought of that. A
  couple of natting youngsters would suit me down to the ground. I shouldn't
  mind a bit; bathing and feeding the little beggars. Awfully fond of kiddies,
  always was. And Angela, why, she'd be fairly potty about them. Now then."</p>

  <p>"You mean to threaten me, sir," Openshaw demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well, not quite that. But dash it, it's a poor rule that doesn't work
  both ways. You have got my apology there, and I am quite prepared to sign it
  and send it on to the editor of the 'Morning Herald.' There. Stick a stamp on
  it and get one of your servants to post it at once."</p>

  <p>Openshaw looked a little less majestic.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to see, sir," he said, "that you have some respect for the
  honour of the house. Why you came near, very near indeed, perhaps to
  depriving a country of a future Premier, at any rate, a Cabinet Minister.
  Still," he went on loftily, "I accept your apology in the spirit in which it
  has been offered, and I trust that time will heal the wound. I have nothing
  more to say, nothing. You can go, Augustus, you can go."</p>

  <p>The fighting light crept back into Gus's eyes. Sooth to say, he had come
  there a bit ashamed of himself with the consciousness that he had not been
  quite playing the game. The whole thing had been a piece of inconsequent
  folly, and he was feeling rather ashamed of it. But, dash it all, if the head
  of the family was going to ride off like that, he would have something to
  say.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he expostulated. "Why should I take all the blame? It isn't
  my fault that there are two Gus Openshaws, and it isn't my fault because my
  cousin is such a mutt. And now perhaps we can exchange documents. Here is a
  bit of paper in my pocket which I think you might sign."</p>

  <p>He handed it over, and the potential future Premier began to read. His
  cheeks swelled up like those of an angry turkey cock.</p>

  <p>"Colossal impudence," he cried. "You are actually asking me in writing to
  give my consent to an alliance with my ward! Because that is what this means.
  Miserable boy."</p>

  <p>"Not at all, sir, not at all," Gus said. "It is only a little interchange
  of compliments. However, being a sportsman, I waive it. The apology can go,
  and you can tear up the paper which you have in your hand. I heard you say
  once, years ago, that in your early day you had some ambition of being a
  sportsman yourself. I begin to see now where you have been a failure."</p>

  <p>The great man stood there with the sheet of notepaper in his hand. He
  looked into that pleasant, rugged, attractive face of his nephew's with a
  vague regret that his own son was not a little more like this young man who
  stood before him. He was bound to admit that Gus was behaving rather
  handsomely. He was actually abasing himself for the good of the family, and
  if he had refused to put his name to that apology, then Mr. Benjamin Openshaw
  would have been an everlasting object of ridicule, and the great man knew
  only too well what that meant in the world of politics. But there was his
  brother's son actually throwing away his sword and depriving himself of what
  might have been a deadly weapon.</p>

  <p>And a sort of sudden liking for Gus seemed to spring spontaneously in that
  ponderous bosom of his. Something inside him was heaving like the ice on a
  river before the west wind. He was conscious that the crust of years was
  cracking, and here and there were dim memories of the time when he was a boy
  himself. He had also been at the best public school in England. He was
  recollecting now how he had dreamt of the day when he, too, might have been
  amongst the Bloods&mdash;a member of the Olympian band that constituted the
  first cricket XI, and perhaps the proud wearer of a footer cap. He had dreams
  of the day when he would do the hundred yards in even time... then he woke
  up.</p>

  <p>He looked across the table with the nearest thing to a smile on his face
  that man had ever seen.</p>

  <p>"My dear boy," he said, with a ponderous clearing of his throat. "You are
  behaving very well, indeed. An honourable course I should have expected from
  my brother's son. And&mdash;er&mdash;yes&mdash;um&mdash;I think, perhaps, on
  the whole, it would be better for me not to stand in your way, and
  I&mdash;er&mdash;rather think that you will find Angela alone in the
  drawing-room."</p>

  <p>Gus took the stairs three at a time.</p><br>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Townsville Daily Bulletin</i>, Australia, 8 Sep
  1926</h3><br>

  <p class="first">MRS. SHAN VANDERDKLE passed out of the palatial
  establishment of Macon. Freres in the Rue Rovill with some half-million
  dollars worth of pearls in her pocket. Nothing romantically historic, but
  really fine graded stuff which had taken years to collect. Nor was she
  particularly intrigued as to the settings. She 'guessed' that Tiffanys could
  see to it when she landed in New York. In the meantime, she was going to
  London for a spell.</p>

  <p>It was Monsieur Jules Blinn, chief assistant, who saw her into the
  limousine waiting at the kerb. Then, without waiting to don his glossy hat,
  he walked down the street to the nearest telephone call box and asked for a
  certain number. Then&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Is that you, M'sieur X?" he asked. "Z speaking, but yes. Ze madame she
  make ze purchase. Tres magnifique. Ze whole suite, yes. She take them wiz her
  to her pension unset. It is enough!"</p>

  <p>The voice at the other end or the wire replied that it was. Whereupon, the
  immaculate Jules smiled and returned to his lawful vocations. With any
  average luck he was going to put something like six thousand pounds in his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>Just how this was to be achieved calls for something in the way of
  explanation. Had they chosen, the Customs House authorities in New York could
  have given it. They could have told you, for instance, that the great game of
  jewel smuggling across the Atlantic was never more popular than at the
  present moment. Also, that great ladies with fathomless purses did not
  disdain to take a hand at the sport.</p>

  <p>Now, some little time ago, the New York Customs awoke to the fact that in
  one way and another the State was being defrauded of something like ten
  million dollars a year by these gilt-edged smugglers. It was a pastime that
  hardly came within the criminal code, but none the less annoying for that. So
  it came about that wealthy ladies buying jewels in Paris and London were
  carefully shadowed, and it became discreetly known that shop assistants might
  add to their incomes without hindrance to present employment by reporting
  quietly in certain quarters as to big deals in gems on the part of America's
  fair citizens. And when it became known behind select counters that one
  fortunate assistant had netted over five thousand pounds as his share of a
  raid on a society lady smuggler in the New York Customs, being twenty-five
  per cent. of the spoil, other bright spirits began to sit up and take
  notice.</p>

  <p>It was a ridiculously easy way of making money. Merely to report to a
  sheltered address on the purchases of certain ladies who were in Europe
  buying gems of price, and then, if a smuggling stunt was attempted, draw the
  the alluring percentage without coming out into the open to give evidence. It
  was a neat little scheme and New York Customs were reaping the benefit of
  it.</p>

  <p>And this was why Monsieur Jules Blinn had spent a few moments in calling
  up a certain modestly anonymous individual at an address that New York had
  thoughtfully provided for such occasions.</p>

  <p>Now, it is only fair to Mrs. Shan Vanderdkle to say that when that spoilt
  child of fortune came to Europe in search of some fine gems she had not the
  slightest intention of defrauding the revenue of her native land, or anybody
  else. She, of course, knew all about the heavy duty on precious stones, and
  wistfully recognised the necessity. Not that she wanted to pay it in the
  least. Neither did Mr. James Starlinger, for the matter of that.</p>

  <p>Starlinger and his wife were two polished, travelled Americans staying at
  the Ritzor, and the lady of the pearls found them there when she returned
  from Paris. It took very little time for something like a friendship to
  spring up, which was only natural, considering that the Starlingers had taken
  up their abode at the Ritzor with the sole intention of establishing friendly
  relations with Mrs. Shan Vanderdkle. They knew precisely what she was doing
  in Europe and still more precisely, what had been her business in Paris.</p>

  <p>To put it candidly, Starlinger and his wife were professional smugglers of
  jewels. It was a regular profession they had followed for years, and the
  Customs House authorities of New York were perfectly aware of the fact. But,
  up to the present moment, the authorities had had the worst of the game.</p>

  <p>"So now you understand all about it," Starlinger said to the pearl lady,
  as they sat over an intimate luncheon in the grill room at the Ritzor. "You
  see, I have been perfectly frank with you, because I want, if possible, to
  save you paying something life a hundred thousand dollars when you get to New
  York. That is, of course, for duty. And, even after paying my fee, you would
  be more that half that sum in pocket."</p>

  <p>"You mean. I should have to hand the stones to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's the idea. And, when we reach New York, I hand them back
  again. You give me a cheque and there is an end of the business. Oh, you need
  not be afraid&mdash;we shall all travel on the same boat, quite openly,
  though, mind you, I shall be watched by one of the Customs House
  experts."</p>

  <p>It sounded very thrilling to the lady of the pearls, all so open and above
  board that, after a little hesitation, she agreed to fall in with the
  suggestion. There was a certain amount of risk, of course, but this made the
  adventure all the more alluring.</p>

  <p>"But aren't you afraid of being caught?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have never been within miles of it yet," Starlinger smiled. "Now, at
  the present moment there is a man in this room who is watching us under the
  impression that I am trying to persuade you to be a party to this little
  scheme. He knows all about me, which may seem something of a drawback, but,
  as I know all about him and he flatters himself that I have not the least
  idea that he is connected with the Customs, that is where I have the
  advantage. He is a new man, engaged solely to track me across the Atlantic
  when I sail in a few days on the Auricula. That is the boat we are all going
  by. Just cast your eye upon the man in the blue serge suit over there, under
  the palm. His name is Hank Crowl, though he has not the least idea that I am
  aware of the fact. He thinks he is going to land me presently with Mrs.
  Vanderdkle's pearls in my possession, but he never made a greater mistake in
  his life. I have got the sweetest, prettiest little stunt you ever heard of.
  I am not going to tell it to you because it would make you nervous. Leave it
  entirely to me, and you will have no cause to be dissatisfied."</p>

  <p>The man called Hank Crowl, especially appointed by the New York
  authorities to keep his eye on Starlinger, was perfectly satisfied with the
  way in which matters were progressing. He had a free hand, practically
  unlimited expenses, and, knowing that Starlinger was not leaving England for
  a few days, decided to slacken the bow, and enjoy himself. He was rather keen
  on seeing the night-side of London, and all he was seeking was a companion to
  help him with his laudable pursuit. And in the fine sportsman who called
  himself Gayford he seemed to have discovered his ideal.</p>

  <p>He had found him at a loose end in the lounge of the hotel. From what he
  could gather the young man was in London on business in connexion with his
  own firm in Colombo. It was rather a slow, dragging business, entailing a
  long stay in London, so that Gayford more than once had expressed a
  half-desire to run over to the States to see if he could pick up a few
  dollars there. And it was some evenings later, after the conversation
  previously recorded, that Crowl walked into the lounge of the Ritzor to find
  Gayford there, seated over a cigar.</p>

  <p>"Say," Crowl asked. "Got anything on to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Rather expecting to meet a man here," Gayford explained. "If he turns up
  I'm fixed. It he doesn't then&mdash;but what do you want to do? Anything
  fresh to see?"</p>

  <p>Crowl replied to the effect that he thought of putting in an hour or two
  at Maxton's one of the most rapid and yet sinister night clubs in the West
  End.</p>

  <p>"Well, why not go on there," Gayford suggested. "I can come on about
  twelve or a bit after."</p>

  <p>With that Crowl went on his way, and, shortly after twelve, Gayford put in
  an appearance at Maxton's. He discovered his new-found friend seated alone in
  a corner of the big dancing saloon with his head buried on his breast and
  apparently steeped in a profound melancholy. In other words, the American was
  monumentally drunk. Gayford exchanged a rapid glance with a waiter close by,
  and demanded a taxi. He managed to convey his burden to the lounge at the
  Ritzor, which was now deserted, and intimated to the night-porter that he was
  going to see his friend up to bed.</p>

  <p>"Seems to want a bit of attention, sir," the night-porter said critically.
  "I have never seen a gentleman much worse."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is why I am going to see him to his room," Gayford said. "I
  will just remove his coat and shoes and collar, and leave him to himself.
  Perhaps you will have a look into his room later on. I don't want to be
  dragged into an unpleasant business. Looks to me as if he was drugged."</p>

  <p>With that, Gayford shoved a pound note into the porter's eager palm, and,
  between them, they got the somnolent Crowl safely to his bedroom. It was
  considerably more than an hour later when Gayford finally left the room and
  sought the seclusion of his own apartment.</p>

  <p>"I think he will be all right now," he told the night-porter. "I have made
  him as easy as possible. But one never knows. If there is anything wrong,
  call me, will you?"</p>

  <p>But apparently nothing out of the common happened, and it was a
  surprisingly fresh-looking Crowl that came down to breakfast the following
  morning. He crossed cheerfully over to the table where Gayford was
  seated.</p>

  <p>"Oh, here you are!" he said. "What the dickens happened to me last night?
  I was in Maxton's with a bunch of girls, and we sure did sling the bubbly
  round. And then, all of a sudden like, my memory seemed to go. When I woke up
  this morning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I brought you home. Found you sitting in the comer of the dance-room like
  patience on a monument. If you get hitting it up like this I shall have to
  take you in hand altogether. I shouldn't mind a run across the water for a
  week or two. My business is a bit hung up, and I can spare the time."</p>

  <p>"Then why not come along?" Crowl said. "You come along with me, and I will
  show you a bit of comedy later on that will be something to talk about when
  you get home again. I can't go into details now, but it will be worth your
  while."</p>

  <p>"Dashed if I haven't a great mind to come," Gayford said. "If you are
  going to start in the course of a day or two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Going to start from Liverpool on Saturday night," Crowl interrupted.
  "Sail on the Auricula. If you like to go down to the office and book a cabin.
  I will come with you."</p>

  <p>Gayford being quite agreeable, the two set out on their errand. They
  passed the table in the dining room where the two Starlingers were
  breakfasting and Crowl smiled to himself as he pictured the discomfiture of
  that distinguished-looking individual when he came to confront him in the
  Customs House at New York. But there would be plenty of time for that. Then,
  on the Saturday morning, Crowl and his companion took train from Euston and,
  just before dark, found themselves comfortably on board the Auricula. It was
  a quick and pleasant voyage without any particular incident, so that Crowl
  had nothing to do but sit down and keep a close eye on Starlinger and his
  wife. And in this he was backed up by more than one authority on board. There
  were at least a dozen subordinates moving about the ship, more or less under
  Crowl's direction, though, as far as anybody could judge, no word had ever
  passed between them. All the same, the Auricula had been thoroughly searched,
  and if Starlinger had only known it, so was his baggage, and even the
  suit-case of himself and his wife in their cabin. Perhaps he did not know
  this, but if so, he gave no sign.</p>

  <p>Crowl made no sign either. He knew, as well as he knew that there was a
  sky above him, that somewhere on board the Auricula those precious pearls
  were concealed, and that Starlinger would make every effort to get through
  the Customs with them. But this time, for once, he was going to be
  disappointed. He was going to have the surprise of his life. He would not be
  lost sight of during the whole of the voyage, and when he presented himself
  at the Customs, he and his wife would be shepherded carefully on one side and
  searched with a thoroughness that would prevent so much as a pin getting past
  the eagle eye of authority.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">It was still daylight when the ship at length came to anchor
  and the placid calm on deck had given place to bustle and confusion. Down
  below in his cabin, Crowl waited. He was just a little eager and anxious,
  because this was his first big case of the sort, and he was more than anxious
  to make good. All his preparations were completed, he merely had to step out
  of the cabin with that neat expanding suit-case in his hand and stand by the
  long counter where the passengers' intimate baggage was examined, and wait
  until Starlinger and his wife appeared on the scene. Then, just as he was
  about to climb on deck, Gayford came through the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Well, old man," he said breezily, "are you ready? No use hanging about
  here any longer, what? Where are we going to stay? What's your usual
  pub?"</p>

  <p>Crowl responded to the effect that he usually put up at the Bilter
  Mansions when he was in New York. He expected to be there for a day or two on
  business, after which he was going on to his home in New Jersey. But he made
  no effort to move, despite all Gayford's signs of impatience.</p>

  <p>"Oh, come on," the latter exclaimed. "No sense in hanging about here like
  this. I am dying to have a look at little old New York. Here, get a move
  on."</p>

  <p>With that, Gayford grabbed his companion's suit case and started for the
  companionway, carrying a case in either hand.</p>

  <p>"I'll carry it, you needn't bother," he said. "What the dickens are you
  waiting for? Get a move on."</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, I have a little business to do first," Crowl said rather
  hesitatingly. He was beginning to find this breezy companion of his a little
  bit of an encumbrance. "Matter of fact. I am waiting to see a man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, in that case I'll push on," Gayford cried. "Look here, suppose I pass
  these two bags through the Customs and then take a taxi as far as Bilter
  Mansions and book a couple of rooms?"</p>

  <p>"Oh all right," Crowl said a little briefly.</p>

  <p>At that moment, an official put his head inside the cabin door and nodded
  curtly in Crowl's direction. Without a reply, Crowl bustled out of the cabin,
  followed by Gayford, and then proceeded down the gangway and thence into the
  covered Customs House. A long line of impatient passengers stood there
  waiting to have their baggage examined, and at the end of the queue, were
  Starlinger and his wife, bearing their intimate possessions.</p>

  <p>"This is going to take a bit of time," Gayford said. "Something special is
  it? Here, let me get a move on."</p>

  <p>He elbowed his way through the crowd and slapped his suit case on the
  counter in front of one of the officials there. He unlocked the case and
  flung it wide open, as if defying the enemy on the other side of the mahogany
  to do his worst. It was a long examination too, though there was nothing in
  the suitcase except personal belongings. But the official examiner was taking
  no risks. He probed the suitcase with needles, he measured the thickness of
  the bottom with a little ivory rule, so that it was a good quarter of an hour
  before the case was locked again and the official permit stamped on it. Then
  Gayford returned to his companion, who was standing at the end of the counter
  with a fine assumption of indifference.</p>

  <p>"Evidently took me for one of those smuggling thieves," Gayford exclaimed
  indignantly. "By James, at this rate, some of those people will be here all
  night. But say, Crowl, what about your suitcase. How am I going to get that
  through?"</p>

  <p>Crowl smothered an impatient exclamation and flung his suitcase on the
  counter. At a sign from him, one of the disengaged officials came forward and
  proceeded to affix the seal on the case without the formality of opening
  it.</p>

  <p>"There, don't stop to talk," Crowl said, as he saw the gaping astonishment
  on his companion's face. "I will explain it all when we are having dinner
  to-night. Off you go."</p>

  <p>Without another word, Gayford vanished past the barriers and flung the two
  suit-cases into a waiting taxi. Directly he had vanished, Crowl approached
  Starlinger and his wife and curtly motioned them to follow. A bunch of
  officials had gathered round, apparently out of nowhere, and Starlinger
  smiled as he saw them.</p>

  <p>"Why this special attention?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"None of that," Crowl snapped. "You just come with me. We want those
  pearls, my lad. I am not mentioning any names, but you know what I mean. The
  pearls from Paris."</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," Starlinger said with a shrug of his shoulders. "Come
  along Naomi, we had better get it over. At any rate, we shall get through a
  great deal quicker than I expected."</p>

  <p>For the best part of two hours, with the aid of male and female searches,
  Starlinger and his wife were examined to the bone. Their personal belongings
  were subjected to a scrutiny that was absolutely microscopic. And then, very
  reluctantly, the eagles relinquished their prey. Without the slightest sign
  of triumph, Starlinger and his wife passed the barrier and, hailing a taxi
  waiting there, drove off having given the driver directions to take them to
  the Armadale Hotel. But strange to say, they never reached that fashionable
  caravanserai. Without a word said on either side, the taximan piloted down
  town until they came to a modest apartment house in Lexton Avenue. And here,
  for the moment they vanished from the ken of the authorities.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">It was just one hour later, under cover of the darkness that
  a manly figure, bearing a suitcase in his hand, let himself into the
  apartment house and proceeded to the sitting-room upstairs where Starlinger
  and his wife were seated over a cosy meal. They rose smilingly to greet the
  newcomer.</p>

  <p>"Well, Danster, old man," Starlinger cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Danster, alias Gayford," the newcomer laughed. "I dare say you
  wondered where I had got to, but I had to cover up my tracks. And how did you
  enjoy the third degree?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it wasn't a very pleasant experience," Starlinger confessed. "Still,
  they weren't quite as bad as they might have been. And they didn't find
  anything, of course."</p>

  <p>"No, of course they didn't," Jackie Danster grinned. "Because there was
  nothing to find. Now, if they had kept their eye on me and not been so
  infernally anxious to lay James Starlinger by the heels, they would have done
  a great deal better, because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As he paused, he laid the suit case on a side table and proceeded to open
  it. Then the contents were thrown out, leaving nothing but the empty
  receptacle with its leather lining. Then Starlinger took a knife from his
  pocket, and, cutting some of the stitches in the soft leather, drew from
  underneath a length of hollow cane, which was plugged at either end with
  cotton wool. This he removed and shook out the contents.</p>

  <p>And there lay Mrs. Vanderdkle's pearls!</p>

  <p>For a few minutes the trio stood by the table, more or less lost in
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"It was a great stunt wasn't it?" Starlinger chuckled.</p>

  <p>"About the neatest you ever pulled off," Danster agreed. "A real priceless
  stunt getting Crowl to bring that stuff all across the Atlantic in his own
  suit case. But you couldn't have done without me, old man. I had to play up
  to Crowl, and I had to see that he got properly soused that night at
  Maxton's. And I had to shove the pearls in his own suit case when he was
  lying insensible in bed, and made a really good job of it."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards?" Naomi Starlinger asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, afterwards was easy. It wanted a bit of bluff to get away with that
  suit-case but I managed it, and I managed it all the easier because Crowl was
  in such a breakneck hurry to keep an eye upon you and be in at the death when
  you came to be searched. He let me walk off with that suit-case with the idea
  of taking rooms at the Bilter Mansions for both of us, and he never dreamt
  what was in the case, when he got that Customs House johnny to O.K. it. And I
  flatter myself that my expressions of astonishment when he did so was a fine
  piece of acting. Lord, if they had only known! The thing right under their
  nose, and&mdash;oh, well what's the good of making a song an dance about it.
  Anyway, you get your money and I get mine, and all I've got to say is I would
  like to have a job like this every week of my life. Open that bottle of fizz,
  old man, and let's drink to Mrs. Vanderdkle and her pearls. Here's luck to
  both of you. And here's luck to old Crowl, waiting for me so patiently at
  Bilter Mansions."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story4"
     name="story4">4.&mdash;PROOF POSITIVE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Western Mail</i>, Perth, Australia, 4 Aug
  1927</h3><br>

  <p class="first">ONE thing old William Lane could never forget and that was
  the fact that Connie Danvers was Miss Danvers of Holsworthy Manor. She might
  be to-day the mere housekeeper of a tenant farmer in the shape of her brother
  Walter, and that the old place was let on a long lease to those odious
  Samley-Gedge people, but the basic fact remained. Lane might be a rich man
  now, as he undoubtedly was, but he had been born under the shadow of the
  Manor and moreover he was the foster brother of the last but one of the
  prosperous and mighty Danvers in those days nearly seventy years ago, when
  things were very different. And because of that and because he had neither
  kith nor kin he was intensely proud of the fact that Connie and her brother
  treated him as an equal.</p>

  <p>Over half a century ago he had emigrated to Australia with his father, and
  had been left as a mere lad entirely without education to face the world
  alone. He had done well in one way and another being naturally shrewd, and in
  the course of time had made a fortune of no small dimensions, after which he
  had come home to settle down in the village of his birth, with his
  confidential secretary, Godfrey Curtis, whom he had originally found in some
  Australian bank and brought with him to England to look after his monetary
  affairs. The coterie was made up by one Sam Crichton, an old schoolfellow of
  Walter Danvers, who had joined him in the more or less vain hope of making a
  competence out of the one farm Danvers had retained when he let the old place
  on a long lease in the hope of clearing off the mortgages in time. It was a
  very fine let to those odious and vulgar Samley-Gedge, husband and wife, who
  had come into that part of the country more or less, so Gedge said, because
  he had known Lane out in Australia and had, indeed, once been a sort of
  partner of his. The Gedges seemed to be very wealthy and hospitable in their
  vulgar way, and made much of Lane who, however, was not too responsive as
  Connie Danvers did not fail to notice. Anyway, their coming was more or less
  due to William Lane and Connie was not ungrateful.</p>

  <p>But dear old William Lane was a different proposition altogether. He was
  one of nature's gentlemen, and did more good in the neighbourhood in a month
  than the Danvers had done in generations. So that he was a welcome guest at
  the farm where he bought Connie's butter and eggs and poultry with a
  lavishness which made her blush to take his money. It was some consolation to
  know that most of her produce went in charity.</p>

  <p>Both she and her brother were very fond of old William Lane. So was Sam
  Crichton, Walter Danvers' partner. But it never once crossed the mind of
  either of them that some of these early days they might benefit through this
  one-time employee on the family estates. His money, of course, would go to
  Godfrey Curtis, who was to all practical purposes the old man's adopted son.
  When Lane died Curtis would return to Australia and settle down there with
  his own relatives. And that would be that. They all liked Curtis, who was a
  fine chap, and persona grata at the farm. Honest Sam Crichton was a little
  jealous of him, though he would not have had Connie guess it for the world.
  But then Connie was something more than a lovely and well-born maid, and
  women have a natural instinct for that sort of thing. That fine individual
  Sam Crichton would have been amazed and dismayed had he realised that Con had
  discovered his secret long ago, though never by word or look had he betrayed
  his feelings. Dear old Sam! And when a girl begins to think of a man she
  respects and admires as 'dear old Sam' or anything else&mdash;. Moreover
  Godfrey Curtis was at present in Australia on business connected with his
  employer and would not be back for many months to come. And there was a girl
  on the other side. Which secret he had confided to Connie.</p>

  <p>But it was weary uphill work at the farm. The fact was more or less forced
  from Walter Danvers one night shortly after Curtis's departure for Australia
  as he smoked his pipe in the dining-room.</p>

  <p>"I feel like chucking it sometimes," he sighed. "The rent we are getting
  from those Gedge people pays the interest on the mortgages and small
  reductions of same, but it is a devil of a pull. Why don't you chuck it,
  Sammy, and leave me to carry on?"</p>

  <p>Sam Crichton shook his honest, handsome head, and flushed. He was watching
  the lovely figure in the big armchair with a pile of darning on her knee.
  What would Connie be like in twenty years' time, he asked himself. All that
  work and drudgery.... He managed to voice his thoughts in a few discreet
  words.</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry about me," Connie laughed. "According to all the
  precedents dear old Lane must leave me everything when he dies. Especially if
  Godfrey Curtis fails to come back. Don't frown, Walter, I am only
  jesting."</p>

  <p>"Much more likely to leave it to that Samley-Gedge lot," Walter growled.
  "They are all over him these days."</p>

  <p>With which Walter rose and drifted moodily out.</p>

  <p>"It is a bit hard," Connie sighed.</p>

  <p>"On you," Sam said. "If I wasn't here perhaps things would be easier. I
  haven't said a word&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, you are always quite the <i>grande seigneur</i>, Sam," Connie said,
  demurely. "You are too proud, Sam. There is a certain pride that spells
  conceit. That's yours, Sam. Placing yourself on a pedestal and admiring the
  statue from a distance. So poor that you could never ask a girl to marry you.
  That would not be playing the game from the statue point of view. But if the
  girl cared for you, isn't there something to be said from her point of view?
  Do you realise, Sam, that you have been making love to me for the last two
  years and more?"</p>

  <p>Sam reddened through his tan like a schoolboy.</p>

  <p>"Me!" he cried. "M-m-making love to you! I wouldn't dare. I swear I have
  never said a single word&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not one, Sam," Connie said, demurely. "But, then, you see, love
  recognises no language limits. In the Victorian novels the hero always spoke
  of a lifetime's devotion. But what was the use of that so long as it led to
  nothing. A girl might have all that and die an old maid all the same. And no
  true girl ever hankers after that. Oh, I know that you study me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who wouldn't?" Sam said, sotto voce.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Sam. That was very pretty and sincere. There is nothing that
  you will not do for me. You are always on the look-out to save me trouble.
  You have rather nice eyes, Sam, and they talk, if you don't. They were quite
  eloquent just now when I was gabbling all that nonsense about Mr. Lane's
  money. Sam, are you not ashamed to sit there as if I was not worth
  answering?"</p>

  <p>Sam's honest soul was bathed in illuminating light.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't ask you to marry me," he said, firmly.</p>

  <p>"Purely as a matter of argument, why not?" Connie asked. "We are both poor
  and, I hope, very honourable. This, of course, is a great drawback in life's
  progress, but I think that it makes for happiness in the end. And if I am
  going to be a dairymaid all my life, why shouldn't I have somebody to look
  after me and, equally, why not somebody to look after you. Eh, Sam?"</p>

  <p>Sam seemed to hear the words from a long way off. The afterglow of a
  gorgeous sunset filled the room and framed Connie like a picture. Then from
  the outer world the sound of hurried steps and Walter burst into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Lane," he cried, "poor old Lane. Dining at the Manor with the Gedge
  family. In the library afterwards transacting some business with his host. I
  met Harrison, the butler, running for a doctor. A most ghastly thing."</p>

  <p>With a little cry Connie sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say?" she gasped, "that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dead," Walter whispered. "He just fell back and died."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">It was something more than a nine days' wonder in the
  village. The poor old gentleman was dead and gone and scores of local poor
  would miss him terribly. Gossips standing at cottage doors asked one another
  what would become of his money. He hadn't a single relative in the world,
  for, had such been the case, he would have looked such relations up and they
  would have benefited. What was to become of the Hospice and all the wonders
  it contained?</p>

  <p>Then, as is inevitable in country places, rumour began to get busy.
  Everything had gone to that there Samley-Gedge! They had been partners in
  business years ago in Australey. A crying shame, it was, and him making such
  a fuss of the poor young squire and his sister. 'Sides, them Gedges had money
  enough already. And not one penny for the poor of the parish as promised.</p>

  <p>Not that Walter Danvers or Connie had expected anything. Such a thought
  had never occurred to either of them. Still the late William Lane had hinted
  at such great things that Walter took the first opportunity of speaking to
  his burly tenant on the subject. The big man with the heavy red face and
  small gimlet eyes smiled.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful how these things get out in these villages," he said casually.
  "I have not mentioned the matter to a soul and I am sure my wife hasn't
  either. Still, the will has to be proved and it will be public property then
  so you might as well know now. You see, years ago Lane and myself did a lot
  of speculating together. We were both poor struggling men and for a time
  things were all against us. And when the luck turned and we both stood on
  firm ground we had a bit of a quarrel. I might have been wrong, but Lane was
  sailing a bit too near the wind for me. However, he is dead and gone now,
  poor chap, and I'll say no more. The very night he died, he came up to the
  Manor and showed me his will in which he left everything to me. He was going
  to alter it and make all sorts of provision for the poor here and so on when
  he just laid back and died as you heard at the inquest. All he intended to do
  but didn't put down in writing shall be done, Danvers, you can bet on that. I
  told my solicitors as much when I wrote to them enclosing the original will.
  I regard poor Lane's wishes as a sacred duty. I shall see that nobody
  suffers."</p>

  <p>Danvers made no comment though he went his way by no means easy in his
  mind. Intimate as he had been with the late William Lane, the latter had
  never said much about his past in the way of business details. But more than
  once he had alluded to Gedge in a way that was not exactly extravagant in the
  way of appreciation. They exchanged visits and dined with one another,
  but&mdash;. And now apparently Lane had left his quondam partner everything.
  Well, the world would know all about that in good time. And, in any case it
  was no business of his, Walter decided.</p>

  <p>Yet the proving of the will in the Probate Court dragged on in the inert,
  languid manner peculiar to legal processes and at the end of a year the
  estate was still in the hands of the Court. Some difficulty in getting in
  contact with the witnesses to the document, Walter understood. The will had
  been made years before in the back of the Australian beyond and these
  witnesses had more or less vanished into darkness. Nor had the will been made
  by a lawyer but was on a single sheet of foolscap paper in the handwriting of
  the testator himself. Still, Walter understood from Gedge that as the
  signature and handwriting was not in dispute it was only a question of time
  before the Court would presume the genuineness of the testament and pass it
  for probate.</p>

  <p>There was only one man who could throw any light on this very dubious
  darkness and he was far enough away. Not one word had reached the home from
  from Godfrey Curtis since his departure over a year ago, and probably now he
  would never visit England again. He had not even left his address behind him,
  so that chapter was closed and the romance of William Lane ended.</p>

  <p>And then, one fine morning in October following the old man's
  death&mdash;that is, October in the following year&mdash;Curtis walked into
  the home farm dining-room as if he had never left. They were just sitting
  down to luncheon, and welcomed him with open arms.</p>

  <p>"Give an account of yourself," Walter cried.</p>

  <p>"The short and simple annals of the poor," Curtis quoted. "Fifteen months
  hard work&mdash;no more. Then, when my mother came back completely restored
  to health after a long illness, I deemed it time to run over here, if only to
  visit the grave of that dear old man."</p>

  <p>"Then you knew all about it?" Connie asked.</p>

  <p>"'Why, of course. From the local paper which I had sent out to me
  regularly. Of course, I ought to have written to some of you, but you know
  how one forgets such things. And you hadn't my address, either. And so Gedge
  comes into all that money! Over Six Hundred Thousand Pounds! Rather rough on
  some of us, eh? But Gedge hasn't got it yet."</p>

  <p>"No, but he will in a month or so," Walter pointed out grimly. "Did you
  happen to know anything about this will?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word," Curtis confessed. "Though I can throw a lot of light on it
  if I am asked to. However&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With which Curtis changed the conversation as if so far as he was
  concerned, the subject was finished. He was uncertain as to how long he would
  stay in England, but, as to that, he could be more definite the following
  night after he had seen a firm of solicitors in London on the morrow.</p>

  <p>It was just after noon next morning as he entered the offices of Steel,
  Brights, and Steel, and asked to see one of the partners. It was a Bright he
  saw, and what he had to say deeply interested that gentleman. He was still
  more interested in a memorandum which Curtis placed on the table before
  him.</p>

  <p>"Now, this is in my writing. Mr. Bright," he said. "It was taken down from
  dictation, and the date is 23rd July last year, as you can see. The signature
  at the foot is that of my late employer, Mr. William Lane, of The Hospice,
  Caveaham. It was dictated the morning following a heart attack. My employer
  suffered that way. Your legal experience will tell you that the memorandum
  was intended as the basis of a will the old gentleman intended to make. Sort
  of instructions to counsel. It was intended that I was to come up to town and
  see your firm with those instructions, but I didn't come, because I was
  suddenly called away to Australia. I was to come to you because of the high
  reputation of your firm, and the fact that you are solicitors to the Danvers
  estate. In ordinary circumstances that memorandum might be accepted by the
  Court as a real will. I seem to have read of such cases."</p>

  <p>"Quite," the lawyer agreed. "But not in case of a properly signed and
  witnessed will which provides for a contingency the very opposite to the
  instructions in your memorandum."</p>

  <p>"But the memorandum is witnessed by my late employer's butler and
  housekeeper," Curtis pointed out. "Highly respectable people, whereas no
  witnesses to what we may call the genuine will are to be found at all."</p>

  <p>"Precisely. But considering that the will that Mr. Samley-Gedge seeks to
  prove is actually in the testator's own handwriting&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Even that mountain might be got over," Curtis interrupted, with a smile.
  "Listen to my prologue, or, rather, my epilogue."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bright listened politely until at a pregnant sentence from Curtis he
  jumped from his seat and appeared to go in off the deep end with a vehemence
  the like of which that decorous office had never seen before.</p>

  <p>"Does anybody else know this?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Not a soul," Curtis replied.</p>

  <p>"Then we must get to work at once. I'll lock that memorandum up in the
  office safe if you don't mind. Thank you. Now put on your hat, and come with
  me as far as Somerset House. I want to have a good look at that will of Mr.
  Lane's."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">Nobody seemed to know anything definite, but it was common
  talk that there was something wrong in connection with the testimonial
  intentions of the late William Lane. Somebody had entered a
  caveat&mdash;whatever that might mean&mdash;against the will, and the case
  was coming on for hearing before Christmas. And if this meant that Gedge was
  going to lose all that money, then a hundred per cent. of his neighbours
  would be pleased.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Samley-Gedge wasn't going to lose. Nor did he make any secret of
  the fact. Nor were the poor in the district going to suffer. Their care would
  be a sacred duty. The Hospice where Lane had lived would be turned into a
  cottage hospital properly endowed, as Mr. Lane had always promised, though
  the scheme was not mentioned in his will, which, however, had been made
  twenty years ago in Australia at a time when he and Gedge were more or less
  partners. He was not going to say much, but the neighbourhood would know all
  about it within a very short time now.</p>

  <p>It was 'The Southern Daily Messenger' that afforded those interested in
  the progress of the case all the information they required. Through that
  paper they learnt for the first time of the memorandum that formed the base
  of the action which Godfrey Curtis and others were taking to annul the will.
  In brief, the memorandum, duly signed and witnessed in July the previous
  year, provided that the estate should be equally divided between Walter
  Danvers, his sister, Samuel Crichton, and Godfrey Curtis, in equal shares,
  subject to certain charities and that the estate should be administered by
  the public trustee.</p>

  <p>This was exciting enough, but there was more to follow when, on the second
  day of the proceedings, Godfrey Curtis went into the witness box to give his
  evidence. 'The Southern Daily Messenger' gave the following almost verbatim
  account of the proceedings:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Mr. Godfrey Curtis, an Australian, and late secretary to the testator,
  then entered the witness box and, under examination by Mr. Walbrook, K.C.
  (for the plaintiffs) testified that for some years he had acted as
  confidential adviser to Mr. Lane. He had resigned his post as cashier in the
  bank where Mr. Lane kept his account to take up the post. Mr. Lane was an
  entirely self-made man, with little education, and therefore, needed
  assistance as his wealth grew. Acting under witness's advice, the testator
  realised most of his assets, and on coming to England, invested practically
  all of his money in War Bonds. The dividends were collected through the dead
  man's bankers, so that he was saved the trouble and worry as to his
  investments. Witness had never heard of the will propounded by the defendant
  Gedge until he read about it in a paper which reached him in Australia,
  though he knew that many years ago the testator and Gedge were in some sort
  of speculative business together. The memorandum in which the action was
  founded was dictated to him (witness)a few days before he was suddenly called
  home to Australia in consequence of illness in the family, and was more or
  less inspired by a heart attack which the testator had had, and witness had
  ventured to expostulate with him on the fact that he has never made his will.
  On the strength of that the memorandum was dictated to witness by the dead
  man, and, as a precaution, signed and witnessed by Lane's butler and
  housekeeper, who, however, were not informed as to its contents.</p>

  <p>A COURT DRAMA.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Sir Charles Morley, K.C.: Kindly look at this document.
  You see what it is?</p>

  <p>Witness: Yes; the original of the contested will.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles: So you say. You are familiar with Mr. Lane's signature. Do
  you dispute the one to the will?</p>

  <p>Witness: Had I seen it anywhere else I should have said without hesitation
  that it was my late employer's signature.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles: I am greatly obliged to you, sir. Will you be so good as to
  examine the body of the document. Have you any doubt that it is in the
  handwriting of the late William Lane?</p>

  <p>Witness: Every doubt. In fact, I know it is not.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles: And why, pray?</p>

  <p>Witness: For a very good and sufficient reason. An illiterate man can
  easily learn to scribble some sort of signature, but it does not follow that
  he can write.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles: Do you mean to suggest&mdash;</p>

  <p>Witness: I am not suggesting anything. The calligraphy in the body of this
  document is not Mr. Lane's, for the simple reason that he could neither read
  nor write.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">The poor old man's secret had been well kept. The one thing
  in life of which he was ashamed. Not even Gedge had guessed it. But the
  evidence, taken on commission from certain bank officials in Australia, had
  been sufficient to establish the forgery, and the case collapsed as Curtis
  left the witness box. And when the nine-days wonder was over and Gedge in
  custody and his shaky financial position disclosed, Walter Danvers and Connie
  went back to the Manor, though the latter is not likely to remain there
  long.</p><br>

  <p class="first">HARTLEY DRUMMOND, standing in the shadow of the plantation,
  watched intently the beautiful, lithe, sinuous animal holding the dead rabbit
  in her hand. The fact that it was his rabbit and had been poached in the
  spinney did not prejudice Sir Hartley against the huntress. Rather was he
  filled with a certain admiration for the tall girl in the vivid scarlet
  blouse. From the far side of the hedge came a drift of wood smoke, and the
  crackle of burning sticks. A man's voice was muttering something, and a woman
  was answering him shrilly. Here were three gaudily painted caravans, and as
  many dingy tents, for a horde of travelling gipsies had stopped here, and
  Drummond's keepers were much annoyed about it.</p>

  <p>The girl strode almost noiselessly across the bracken; her bare feet
  gleamed like ivory against the vivid green. Came to her a moment later a man
  in a cloth cap and a muffler about his throat. She tossed the rabbit to him
  with a contemptuous gesture, and made as if to turn away when he caught her
  by the shoulder. It was something in the way of a caress, a touch of
  affection which might mean love in the wild, but it seemed to act upon the
  girl as if someone had put a match to the dark masses of her hair. As the
  man's hand tightened upon her shoulder she turned her head and hit the brown
  fingers savagely.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch me again," she panted. "I have told you about it before. Why
  can't you leave me alone? Why can't you all leave me alone, for the matter of
  that? Keep your kisses for Meg Stanley: she'll welcome them fast enough."</p>

  <p>THE young man laughed inwardly. He was not in the least angered or moved
  by this spurt of flaming passion. He might have been no more than a dog on
  which another one had turned in scorn and contempt of amatory advances.
  Without another word he picked up the rabbit and disappeared in the direction
  of the camp. The girl sat down on a fallen tree and took a slim volume from
  her pocket. A cracked voice calling for one Miriam brought a snarl to her
  lips as she threw the book down and darted towards the spot where the tents
  were pitched. Drummond was conscious of an intense curiosity to see what
  manner of literature this beautiful vixen of the woods affected. He could
  hear Miriam being shrewdly scolded for some dereliction of duly; someone was
  scoffing at the girl and demanding to know whether she meant to pass the
  whole day poring over 'that muck.' Obviously the speaker was alluding to the
  book which lay face downwards on the fallen tree. Drummond took it up in his
  hand and glanced at the cover.</p>

  <p>"Swinburne," he muttered. "Now what on earth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl was coming back again. He dropped the volume and discreetly
  vanished. Here was a problem startling as it was unexpected. Drummond was a
  sportsman and a country gentleman, but he was a wide reader and a philosopher
  as well.</p>

  <p>And he knew the wild, and the strange creatures that dwelt therein in many
  parts of the world. He knew that some of the inhabitants of the jungle were
  gregarious, like the rabbits and the rats and coyotes and wild dogs of the
  Western prairies. He knew that they snarled and fought and made war on one
  another much the same as men do, and this strange instinct fascinated
  him.</p>

  <p>But there were other creatures in the wild not gregarious. There were the
  hawks and the vultures, the leopards and the panthers, playing their lone
  hand or travelling in small parties much as the gipsies in yonder camp were
  doing. There were town rats and country rats, and to this latter clan the
  gipsies belonged. They could hibernate with the rest in the holes and burrows
  of the town till the spring came a-calling and the smell of the rising sap
  sent them aflame for the clear sky and the open road. They were a fairly
  wild, untamed lot, as Drummond knew, for he had had a fancy once out in
  Hungary to go camping with them. These people here spoke a different language
  but they were the same race, with the same swarthy, clear-cut features and
  dark hair and eyes. In the ordinary course Drummond would have given the girl
  Miriam no further thought, but a wandering Romany who makes clothes pegs and
  vicariously poaches rabbits in the intervals of reading Swinburne was a human
  document not to be lightly put aside.</p>

  <p>The problem was still with Drummond as he sat in his library smoking his
  final cigar before turning in. He would like to have seen more of this girl;
  he would like to have questioned her as to where she had learned to read, and
  who had inspired her with the neurotic beauties of the poet. He would have
  been surprised to know that the girl was standing in the darkness not five
  yards away, looking through the window into the library with shining,
  covetous eyes. She was still there when Drummond pulled the window to and
  switched off the light.</p>

  <p>It was some half an hour later when he came down again with an uneasy
  feeling that he had not properly fastened the window. He was thinking of the
  gipsies, probably. He made no noise in his slippered feet as he put his hand
  round the door and flicked on the light. And there, curled up in a big arm
  chair with a dark lantern in her hand, was the gipsy girl. She had a costly
  edition of Shelley in her hand. Her scarlet blouse made a vivid spot against
  the brown leather of the bookcases, her bare legs were still glistening with
  the dew, her little pink toes wriggled uneasily. She looked up from the
  tangle of her hair.</p>

  <p>"It's a fair cop, mister," she said half defiantly. "But I'm doin' no
  'arm; God's truth, I ain't."</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not," Drummond said. "But you'll admit that I have the
  right to ask you a few questions. I take it that this is not your first visit
  here."</p>

  <p>He half expected her to lie, but those bold clear eyes had in them no
  sinister light of prevarication.</p>

  <p>"Every night for the last week," she said. "I see you here one evening as
  I came around by the house. Been borrowing a few cabbages from the garden, I
  'ad. Your blind was up, and I looked in. And when I see all them beautiful
  books&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So you are a book lover like myself, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Love 'em," the girl said. Her eyes were sparkling now. "Anything in print
  almost. I dare say you wonder where I learnt it all. When I was 12 I had
  something the matter with my spine. For two years I was in one of them 'omes.
  And they learned me to read and write, and they give me pretty well every
  book I wanted. I've got scores of books in the caravan. When ever I'm near a
  town, and I've got a few coppers to spend I find a second-'and
  bookstall&mdash;but look 'ere, you ain't going to charge me, are you?"</p>

  <p>"You wound my sense of hospitality," Drummond smiled. "My dear child, you
  are perfectly safe here. Do you know, your case is very interesting? Your
  present mode of life must be horrible to a clever girl with an artistic
  temperament. Now I have friends and influence; there are schools and
  institutions&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't do it," the girl cried, "indeed, I couldn't do it, mister.
  It's in the blood. I didn't know what that meant till I began to read; didn't
  know why I felt so restless and miserable in that hospital. And they were
  very good to me, ay, as good as gold. Might have been a princess. And all the
  time my 'eart was out 'ere in the sunshine. And when they brought me flowers
  I seemed to see the daffodils and blue-bells in the woods&mdash;oh, don't
  send me to school. A month in the stir I could stand all right. Only if
  you've got any pity, don't send me to school."</p>

  <p>She spoke in a voice vibrant with passionate entreaty. She seemed to be
  regarding Drummond as the avenging instrument of the law devising some
  terrible punishment for venial sin. But he understood her&mdash;understood a
  great deal more dearly than she knew. For the wild was to him an open book,
  and he had heard its call many a time before to-night. There was a kindly
  feeling in his heart for the beautiful half-shy, half-savage girl in the red
  blouse.</p>

  <p>"You can make your mind quite easy," he said. "You are not going to be
  punished. This little adventure shall be a secret between us, and if, during
  the rest of your stay here, you should happen to wander this way at night,
  and the window's not securely fastened&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl smiled, showing two rows of teeth white as the kernel of a
  filbert. Then her face overcast like an April sky.</p>

  <p>"It's too late," she sighed. "Must think myself lucky to have been here so
  many times already. We are moving along Ashdown way to-morrow. Always moving,
  we are."</p>

  <p>Drummond was frankly sorry to hear it. There was something about this
  child-woman that fascinated him. It seemed a thousand pities that with her
  dark beauty and fine intelligence, to say nothing of her artistic dreams, she
  should be condemned to the inevitable end that awaits the female creatures in
  the wild. She would meet her mate some day and they would get up the smoke
  tents of Ishmael for themselves and wander and wander till the end came. He
  could see her beauty lined and scarred with the stress of the storm and the
  fret of existence. He could see her and the male wolf scouring the wild for
  the daily meal, see her bent under the weight of the child slung across her
  breast in the inevitable parti-coloured shawl. Her hair would be grey some
  time, she would grow foxy and cunning, sly and glib of tongue, a haunter of
  back doors and a preyer upon silly moon-faced domestics dreaming dreams
  founded on fiction as expounded by the "Housemaid's Companion."</p>

  <p>"It seems a thousand pities," Drummond said. "I am not quite sure that my
  weak good nature is not depriving the world of a genius. You are very young
  yet, Miriam. Two or three years at school and you may be writing the poetry
  that you so passionately admire. You might become a novelist, another Borrow.
  Oh, with a mind like yours you might be anything."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know," the girl said simply. "I have lain awake and thought of it
  scores of times. I can sleep in the darkest wood, and, yet the town frightens
  me. All these stone walls and brick 'ouses give me the 'orrors. Seems to me
  sometimes that I'm not one girl, but two. I want to read and I want to write,
  but I want the open road most of all. No, it would never do, mister."</p>

  <p>And Drummond could see that, too. He knew the utter folly of any attempt
  to cage this wild bird. It was as if one chained an eagle in an aviary and
  tried to tame him with bird-seed. The simile struck Drummond as humorous, and
  he smiled a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"I am quite with you," he said. "If you ever do change your mind, be sure
  you write and let me know."</p>

  <p>The girl rose to her feet and frankly accepted Drummond's outstretched
  hand.</p>

  <p>"I must be going now," she said. "You have been so very good to me,
  mister, and I am very grateful. Maybe we shall meet again some day. I dare
  say we shall work this pitch again in a year or two. I should like to see all
  these books again before I die."</p>

  <p>She looked round the well-filled shelves yearningly, with just a
  suggestion of mistiness in her eyes, much as if she were parting with some
  well-beloved friends.</p>

  <p>"You are sure you won't change your mind?" Drummond asked. "You would
  prefer to go back to your relatives?"</p>

  <p>"They are no relatives of mine," the girl said. "My own people are
  somewhere up in Scotland. When I came out of hospital I found these Stanleys,
  and I have been with them ever since. It's all the same, you know; it's all
  one clan."</p>

  <p>"It seems a very great pity," Drummond murmured.</p>

  <p>She turned to him with a certain fierce sorrow.</p>

  <p>"It isn't because I will," she said, "but because I must. Ever read
  anything of Thomas Hardy? You have? Remember the first chapter of 'The
  Woodlanders'? Well, you've got it all there. And you know why I've got to go
  wandering and wandering, and&mdash;oh, I can't explain it. Mister Hardy would
  understand."</p>

  <p>She turned away without another word and vanished into the night. In some
  vague way she seemed to leave a void behind her.</p>

  <p>"Very strange," Drummond murmured as he went thoughtfully to bed. "I
  should like to follow that child's career, but, of course, we shall never
  meet again."</p>

  <p>And that was where Drummond was wrong.</p>

  <p>The hour was late and Drummond was lingering over a volume of Maeterlinck
  philosophy, but it seemed to him that he could hear a faint cry somewhere
  outside under the cover of the darkness. There was a suggestion as if steel
  had come in contact with steel, then that cry again, followed by a moan of
  despair. Drummond dropped his book and sat up rigidly. If might be possibly
  the poachers at work and that one of them had met with some accident. He
  pulled up the blind and opened the window, so that the electrics cut a broad
  swathe of light into the heart of the purple darkness. At the end of the
  blinding lane, as something lay huddled on the grass, Drummond could make out
  the glint of steel, the dull polish of lacquer work, and then it was borne in
  upon him that someone had been riding across the grass and had come utterly
  to grief with a bicycle. The rider had evidently come headlong over, down a
  flight of steps leading to the stone terrace. Drummond hurried forward and
  raised the prostrate figure in his arms. He saw a white face in a tangle of
  black hair, he saw the slim figure of the girl in her scarlet blouse. He
  lifted her in his arms and carried her into the house. With some trouble he
  coaxed a few drops of brandy down the girl's throat, then she shuddered
  violently and opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>"It was my own fault," she whispered. "I came here without a lamp. I
  couldn't find a lamp anywhere, and if I had I daren't have used it, so I had
  to take my chance. If those two had found out what I was doing they would
  have murdered me."</p>

  <p>"But what is all the trouble?" Drummond asked.</p>

  <p>"You are," the girl gasped. "It is Red Stanley; he hadn't long come out of
  jail. He was tramping to find us, and spotted this place on the way. And he
  persuaded his brother George as it was all right, and they're coming here
  to-night to burgle the place. I only knew this about two hours ago. You see,
  we are on the other side of Ashdown Forest camping near a village, and in the
  shed of the vicarage Red Stanley found some of the young gentlemen's
  bicycles. Do you see the game now, mister?"</p>

  <p>"It begins to dawn upon me," Drummond smiled.</p>

  <p>"That's it. Borrow the bicycles and ride over here without lamps. Probably
  not meet a soul the whole way. Then take all they can lay their hands on and
  get back again. On a dry night like this it wouldn't take half an hour to
  clean those machines, and nobody would ever know as they'd been taken out of
  the shed. And that's what brings me here. And I've broke my collarbone."</p>

  <p>Miriam's face was white and set with pain, but her dark eyes were keen and
  alert; she was quivering with expectation.</p>

  <p>"They're coming," she whispered. "You can't hear them, but I can. I knew
  they wouldn't be far behind. Ring the bell, rouse all the servants in the
  house. They're coming."</p>

  <p>But Drummond had no intention of meeting this trouble except single
  handed. He picked up the girl again carefully and tenderly and carried her
  into a small room on the other side of the hall.</p>

  <p>"Now you lie here and don't worry," he commanded. "I am quite capable of
  dealing with these friends of yours. I suppose the gentleman called Red
  Stanley made the same discovery that you did&mdash;in other words, that I am
  somewhat careless in fastening the library window. I'll put the light out and
  wait for them. Meanwhile you will be perfectly safe here. You are a brave
  girl, Miriam."</p>

  <p>He walked back to the library leisurely enough and turned off the lights.
  Then he sat down patiently to await the coming of the foe. Half an hour
  passed, then the catch of the window clicked, and there was a smell of strong
  humanity in the room. Drummond could hear a hoarse whisper or two, caught a
  tiny pin-point of flame flashed from a torch upon his cabinet of coins. He
  reached out his hand for the switch, and the room was flooded with light.
  Before the astonished burglars could recover from their surprise he had
  locked the library door and dropped the key in his pocket. Then he strode
  across and stood with his back to the open window. He held something in his
  hand, but the discomfited intruders had not noticed it as yet. From their
  point of view he was simply an unarmed man, and consequently an easy prey for
  these wolves from the wild. Drummond recognised Red Stanley at a
  glance&mdash;Miriam's description seemed to fit him like a glove. The ruddy
  hackles on his crest seemed to rise; he extended a hairy hand in Drummond's
  direction. Then, without a word, he charged.</p>

  <p>It was all strangely familiar. Drummond had slain many animals of this
  type, but they had usually been quadrupeds of equal intelligence and cleaner
  and sweeter in every way than this red ruffian who Drummond would have shot
  down without hesitation or a grain of pity in his heart. But then the wild is
  limited so far as civilisation is concerned, and the law of the town is
  prejudiced, so that the shot that Drummond fired slipped through the right
  wrist of the sanguine Stanley, and he bent double, moaning with the pain of
  it. There was to be no more fight, the beast was cowed, and so was the other
  animal crouching against the wall and snarling strange oaths in the Romany
  vernacular.</p>

  <p>"Sit dawn," Drummond said crisply. "There is nothing much the matter with
  you, Mr. Stanley. A cold water bandage and a week's rest will put that wrist
  right again. You see, I know all about it. You had better take those bicycles
  back to the place where you found them and fade out of the county of Sussex
  without delay. I have my own particular reasons why I don't want to ring up
  the police and give you in custody. Now be off, both of you. I don't think
  you will want to come here again."</p>

  <p>He threw open the window and the two marauders slunk out into the
  congenial darkness. The whole episode had not occupied more than five
  minutes. With a grim smile Drummond closed the window and drew the blinds. He
  did not go immediately back to the room where Miriam was lying; on the
  contrary, he walked up the stairs and along a corridor till he came to a door
  on which he tapped gently. It was opened presently by a handsome, motherly
  looking woman, who even in her dressing gown looked the typical housekeeper
  to the life.</p>

  <p>"And what mischief have you been up to now, Sir Hartley?" she asked. "I
  heard a noise just now, and was coming down&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear soul, do," Drummond said. "I have just captured one of the most
  beautiful specimens of natural fauna you ever saw. In other words, it's a
  girl&mdash;a dear little gipsy girl with a broken wing&mdash;I mean, a
  collarbone. I want you to make her comfortable whilst I telephone for the
  doctor. I'll tell you the story to-morrow. I think it will astonish even
  you."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Deane frankly doubted it. She was too accustomed to her beloved
  master's eccentricities to be astonished at anything. The story left her
  absolutely unmoved. But one thing the motherly, kind-hearted soul was certain
  of. Miriam could not go back to the clan again, and it was Sir Hartley's
  obvious duty to make himself responsible for her future and see that she went
  to school.</p>

  <p>To all this Miriam listened with revolt in her eyes and the red flag of
  rebellion flying in her cheeks. She could see the logic of the situation
  clearly enough. She could not go back to the clan; she would not be safe from
  their teeth and claws if they got on the trail of the truth. She wanted to go
  to school, and yet she dreaded the bare idea of it. She was like the
  dipsomaniac who shudders and sickens in the presence of the brandy bottle,
  knowing full well that he is too weak to resist. She could see down the long
  avenues of knowledge and power and the grip on the heart of hidden things,
  and she could see, on the other hand, that discipline and the prim
  restrictions which would be as prison bars. And with it all she was
  passionately, almost unreasonably, grateful to Drummond for what he had done.
  She fought it out in a conflict which would have staggered Drummond had he
  been able fully to grasp it. She came to him when in a dim, nebulous way she
  was conscious that mind had conquered body.</p>

  <p>"I'll do it, mister," she said. For some strange reason she could not or
  would not call Drummond Sir Hartley. "I want to go, and yet I don't want to
  go. 'Tisn't that you are not right, because you are. And I'll go&mdash;for
  three years&mdash;in a town."</p>

  <p>Drummond ought to have been satisfied, but he was by no means easy in his
  mind. He could not shake off the impression of coming disaster even when
  encouraging reports of his protege's progress came to hand. She was a little
  wild, of course, and restive under the iron hand of discipline, but nothing
  worse than this. So that gradually Drummond's uneasy suspicions were lulled
  to sleep, and he allowed himself to join a hunting party on a six months trip
  in the African continent. It was many months before letters reached him, and
  out of his first mass of mail he picked out an envelope addressed to him in
  Miriam's bold handwriting.</p>

  <p>It was no frank communication from a child, though it sounded spontaneous
  enough. The words came red hot from the heart of a woman. And before Drummond
  had turned the last page he knew that his experiment had failed.</p>

  <p>Miriam had left the school. She had gone away out into the world dressed
  in the tattered skirt and red blouse, gone with bare feet no longer hardened
  as of yore. She had gone to join the tribe in the restless wanderings.</p>

  <p>"I've tried and tried," she wrote, "and I want you to believe this if you
  believe nothing else. Because I'm no longer a girl, mister. I don't believe I
  ever was one, judging from the standard of your class. They knew so much more
  than me, and yet they knew so little. They could play hockey and tennis and
  golf, and yet they were frightened to go to bed in the dark. Silly, quivering
  little cowards every one of them. And from the very first I always felt like
  a hawk in a cage of canaries.</p>

  <p>"If it hadn't been for the books and the learning I should have left long,
  long ago. And now I'll tell you a secret. When they were all asleep I would
  let myself out of my bedroom window by a rope and wander out into the woods.
  On summer nights it was good to swim in the river and lay snares for the
  rabbits. And nobody found it out, no one suspected.</p>

  <p>"In winter it was not so bad. There was the rain and the snow, and the
  knowledge that the Lees and the Stanleys and the Smiths were all herding in
  some slum waiting for the spring and the call of the woods. But when the
  almonds were in bloom and the wind came up from the south, it seemed to tear
  me as if something had wounded me, and I was slowly, slowly bleeding to death
  inside. And now it is April weather, and down in the spinneys where I used to
  poach your rabbits the daffodils are blooming. I can see them nodding to me
  as I sit here in this stuffy little bedroom, and they are weaving a chain
  round me and dragging me with them into the heart of the country.</p>

  <p>"And I am going, mister, as sure as the sun will rise on the morrow.
  Whether all your kindness to me will make me a happier woman in the future,
  whether I shall repent of what I'm doing, I cannot say. But the wild is
  calling me, and I suppose my mate is waiting somewhere out in the woods for
  Miriam. And I am perhaps the most ungrateful woman who ever returned a
  kindness so ill. So pity and forgive me, and I will say no more."</p>

  <p>It was some two and a half years later that Drummond, skirting along the
  woods in the early evening, paused for a moment by the spot where he had
  first encountered the gipsy girl who was still to him a warm and vivid
  memory. Nothing appeared to be changed; the fallen tree on which he
  discovered the volume of Swinburne still lay there. He could see her now in
  the scarlet blouse and the rabbit in her hand as she moved towards the
  encampment. And as he stood there she came again as she had done before, the
  same Miriam and yet strangely changed. She was older and more mature, a
  little slower of step, and yet with the free stride of the woods, and round
  her neck was slung a shawl, and within it a burden that moved and breathed,
  and then Drummond knew that Miriam had been right and that the thing that she
  had seen with dim, prophetic eyes had come to pass.</p>

  <p>She saw him almost as soon as he had seen her; she came forward half shyly
  and half defiantly. As he held out his hand she bent over it, and Drummond
  could see that tears were in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, mister," she said, yet half defiantly.</p>

  <p>"There was nothing to forgive," Drummond answered. "The fault was entirely
  mine. It is always the same when puny man attempts to interfere with the laws
  of nature. So you found him after all?"</p>

  <p>Miriam's cheeks flamed. She bent with a certain arrogant pride over the
  palpitating bundle in her arms.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I found him," she said. "I always knew I should. He's over there on
  the other side of the hedge making baskets. We've been together now for
  eighteen months. He's my husband, and I'm proud of him."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see him," Drummond said.</p>

  <p>"No, no," Miriam protested. "At least, not in that way. Michael knows
  nothing of my story&mdash;he would not understand it if he did. I am just to
  him the mate he needed, and I knew it the first time we met away up there in
  Sherwood Forest. He just put his arm round me and kissed me, and we went away
  to a good parson up there who knows something of our ways, and we were
  married. And I don't regret it, mister. I can't!"</p>

  <p>"And all the literary yearnings?" Drummond asked. "What about them? You no
  longer hanker to be a female Borrow, eh?"</p>

  <p>Miriam smiled. Once more she glanced down at the bundle in her arms. She
  smiled again and touched it very tenderly.</p>

  <p>"All the poetry and all the romance lies here," she said. "And no words
  can express it. Now as long as I have this I am no longer restless and
  dissatisfied. But you are a man, and that is the thing that no man can
  understand."</p>

  <p>A voice in the darkness called out the name of Miriam and a few words in a
  liquid tongue that Drummond could not follow. He could guess, though, who the
  speaker was.</p>

  <p>"That is your husband calling you," he said. "On the whole, perhaps I had
  better not see you again."</p>

  <p>"I think it would be just as well," said Miriam.</p>

  <p>She turned away and walked towards the camp with the rabbit still swinging
  in her hand.</p><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">BIG BILL KOGGS had sent off a day-message, prepaid, rush, to
  J. Claudius Bruno, at the Grand Central Hotel, Butte, Montana. The news thus
  communicated was as follows:</p>

  <p style="font-size:1.1em; margin-left:15%; text-indent:0"><tt>WHAT THE HELL,
  JAKE? THE HOT SPRINGS HAS GONE COLD.<br>
  W. KOGGS.</tt></p>

  <p>In due course there came a reply&mdash;day-message,
  collect&mdash;addressed to</p>

  <p>"William Koggs, Hot Springs Hotel, Oluk Lake, Montana," and reading
  thus:</p>

  <p style="font-size:1.1em; margin-left:15%; text-indent:0"><tt>YOU MUST HAVE
  LET THE FIRE GO OUT UNDER THE BOILER.<br>
  BRUNO.</tt></p>

  <p>Big Bill crumpled the yellow sheet into a crinkly wad and hurled it into
  the dark fire box.</p>

  <p>"So that," he observed, "is what&rsquo;s haywire with this layout! Damned
  if I hadn&rsquo;t ought to 'a' stayed in the garage business. Yessir, I ought
  to 'a' knowed any hotel that open cutout Jake Bruno sold me'd have a cracked
  cylinder an' a flat tire !"</p>

  <p>"Tire flat?" asked a deep voice at his elbow.</p>

  <p>"No, but I am," snapped Bill. "Here, you big Indian cheese, what you know
  about this ?"</p>

  <p>"All 'bout it," said the one addressed. "Me build um."</p>

  <p>"Whassat?"</p>

  <p>"I said I'm thoroughly familiar with the hot springs, because I
  constructed them."</p>

  <p>Even in his dirty shirt and torn overalls, which somehow suggested horses,
  the Indian retained his dignity. In his humbler moments he might have posed
  for a statue of Powhatan telling the early Virginians where to get off his
  hunting grounds.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be scrapped for a mess o' junk!" breathed the former
  garageman. "So you can talk United States when you want to, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! Me go Carlisle."</p>

  <p>"Whassat?"</p>

  <p>"I said I'm a Carlisle graduate. You may have heard of me. The late Walter
  Camp once did me the honor of selecting me for all-American end."</p>

  <p>"And you knowed all the time them hot springs had to be heated! Why the
  hell didn't you say sumpin'?"</p>

  <p>"You no ask um."</p>

  <p>"Whassat?"</p>

  <p>"I said you didn't inquire of me. If you had, I should have informed
  you."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you're workin' here, get busy and help steam up this percolator
  instead of talkin' so much, or our guests 'll all run out on us&mdash;yessir,
  all three of 'em!" </p>

  <p>With the telegram from the recent owner as a nucleus, a fire was soon
  glowing in the grate, and the hiss of escaping steam announced that another
  wonder of nature had been saved for summer boarders. Mopping his brow, Bill
  Koggs studied the sputtering array of pipes and the dejected-looking pile of
  coal with a professional eye.</p>

  <p>"So that's where the profits in the hotel business goes!" he remarked to
  himself. "This here boiler'll eat up forty dollars' worth o' coal per week
  keepin' the hot springs hot. No wonder Jake Bruno was willin' to sell the
  joint cheap; and she looked like such a bargain!" He turned to the Indian,
  who leaned gracefully against the door jamb. "So you rigged up this here
  steam kettle, eh, chief?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"Your own idea?"</p>

  <p>"Nope."</p>

  <p>"Whose, then?"</p>

  <p>"Bruno say what do. Me fixum."</p>

  <p>"Whassat?"</p>

  <p>"I said Bruno conceived the plan of heating the springs. I merely
  installed the boiler under his directions."</p>

  <p>"Well, as a mechanic, you're a fine car washer. That's a bum rig! We're
  losin' too much heat. I'll fix it better when I get time. You go with this
  place, do yuh?" .</p>

  <p>"Sure," said the Indian.</p>

  <p>Briefly he explained how, in the mornings, he consented to perform certain
  menial tasks in the saddle-horses-for-hire department of the hotel, in
  exchange for his room and board. This left him free to spend his afternoons
  parading before the admiring ladies in his more or less tribal finery, the
  while he disposed, at handsome profit, of genuine Indian bead-work which he
  obtained, postage prepaid, from a well-known mail order house in Chicago. He
  intimated his willingness to continue this arrangement under the new
  management.</p>

  <p>Bill consented, tentatively. The hotel business was all new to him. He had
  much to learn, but with the aptitude of a good mechanic he was learning
  rapidly.</p>

  <p>It had all sounded so inviting as the suave Bruno had presented it, while
  Big Bill deftly adjusted a carburetor and changed the oil, back there in
  Butte. No more struggling with faltering flivvers and misused motors, no more
  nicked knuckles and oily overalls, but fine clothes to be worn in the
  sunshine of a mountain resort as lord of the place! Bruno had mentioned the
  profits, too, and his own prosperous person was eloquent proof of the wealth
  to be obtained in the hotel business.</p>

  <p>At the very first Mr. Koggs had been interested. Then, as the acquaintance
  between the two men ripened into the "Bill" and "Jake" stage, he had become
  convinced. At the last Bruno had tucked his friend's soiled check into the
  pocket of his faultlessly tailored suit, clapped his expensive fedora
  jauntily on his bullet-shaped head, and made for the bank.</p>

  <p>"So this is what I bought!" Bill now reflected, as he stood on the wide
  porch of his hotel and looked off across the lake. "It ain't the first
  cost&mdash;it's the upkeep. For fuel consumption this baby beats any 1910
  model on the lot. If I don't do sumpin' about it quick, she's goin' to ride
  me right into the poorhouse!"</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">THE season was still early, and Mr. Koggs took comfort in
  the thought that business might pick up as the weather grew warmer. As a
  matter of fact it did, but not enough to offset the cost of maintaining the
  big hotel and keeping the hot springs hot. Then the State of Montana kindly
  dumped a quantity of newly crushed rock on the highway from which a byroad
  led to Oluk Lake, and Mr. Koggs perforce became a garageman again. Hardly an
  automobile arrived at the Hot Springs Hotel but exhibited at least one
  lacerated tire and blown-out tube; so Big Bill donned his overalls once more
  and went to work, while dollars tinkled in the cash register, and the pile of
  discarded tires mounted in the garage.</p>

  <p>The anxious pucker vanished from the hotel owner's besmudged brow as the
  ledger at last showed the venture breaking even&mdash;almost. An accountant
  would have mentioned such items as depreciation and interest, but Big Bill's
  bookkeeping was of the direct sort, free of encumbering technicalities.</p>

  <p>As the summer days wore on, the stalwart Indian's attachment, at first
  tentative, became permanent. Tricked out in a Sioux war bonnet and Apache
  leggings, he made up as a scenic attraction for whatever shortcomings he
  might have as a stableman. Bill had more than once heard a sojourning dowager
  from east of the Mississippi remark, on beholding the statuesque figure:</p>

  <p>"Ah, at last this is the real West!"</p>

  <p>One drowsy afternoon, as Bill, having stoked the ever-hungry maw of the
  hot springs boiler, passed by the broad veranda on his way to replace two
  balloon tires on a newly arrived limousine, he was arrested by a sirupy
  contralto voice imploring:</p>

  <p>"Chief, can you tell me what is the meaning of the name 'Oluk Lake'?"</p>

  <p>The Indian stretched a dramatic arm toward the water.</p>

  <p>"Oluk," he intoned, "in language of my people, mean 'serpent.'"</p>

  <p>"Oh, how thrilling!" gasped the contralto. "Can you tell me why it is
  called Serpent Lake?"</p>

  <p>The Indian glanced about the veranda, assured himself that his audience
  was attentive, and proceeded:</p>

  <p>"Many summers ago wigwam of mighty chief Soaring Eagle stand by lake here.
  Long, long ago, so say story of my people, Soaring Eagle go away to war. He
  leave beautiful young squaw at home. Young chief Running Fox of 'nother tribe
  come along while braves all gone. Young chief Running Fox see beautiful young
  squaw. Young squaw listen to love talk of Running Fox. Many times young squaw
  go on lake in young chief's canoe.</p>

  <p>"Bimeby Soaring Eagle come home. Him see um young squaw on lake in 'nother
  man's canoe. Soaring Eagle call in loud voice to spirits of water to punish
  young squaw. Out of deep come great serpent monster. Gulp! He swallow up
  young chief Running Fox. Gulp! He swallow up young squaw. Gulp, gulp! He
  swallow up canoe, and down go serpent monster to deep again. Pretty young
  squaw like you go on lake, you be plenty sure go with right man. Mebbe so
  bimeby serpent monster come back again. You like buy Indian beadwork?"</p>

  <p>Big Bill chuckled and passed on to the garage. Presently the Indian joined
  him there.</p>

  <p>"Some fish story," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" said the Indian. "Story sell um beads."</p>

  <p>"Whassat?"</p>

  <p>"I said that that is one of my very best stories. It seldom fails to
  procluce a sale."</p>

  <p>Big Bill flexed an inner tube absenly, his brow corrugated in thought.</p>

  <p>"Think they's anything to it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Ugh! No can tell."</p>

  <p>"Whassat?"</p>

  <p>"I said it's impossible to judge at this late date. Like most legends, it
  probably has some slight basis in fact."</p>

  <p>Bill set his vulcanizer going and watched abstractedly as it sealed a neat
  patch over a ragged tear in the rubber.</p>

  <p>"Oh, boy!" he murmured. "Wouldn't that oil the bearings?" He fixed the
  Indian with a rapt expression and exclaimed again: "Oh, boy!"</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">THE world rolled on for a week, during which William Koggs
  was little seen and the lordly Indian reaped a meager harvest of dimes and
  quarters from bored customers. Then, about the middle of July, the event
  occurred that put Oluk Lake on the map and the Hot Springs Hotel on the front
  pages of a nation's newspapers.</p>

  <p>A party of sleepy-eyed fishermen, shoving off hopefully from the hotel
  landing at the first faint crack of dawn, came tearing back with a speed that
  stove in the starboard gunwale and roused the slumbering guests. A window was
  raised and an indignant voice shouted:</p>

  <p>"Stop that racket!"</p>

  <p>"It was thirty feet long!" replied the first fisherman.</p>

  <p>"It had jaws like a shark!" cried the second.</p>

  <p>"Flippers like a seal!" yelled the third.</p>

  <p>"It was a sea serpent!" added the first.</p>

  <p>"With red eyes!" bellowed the second.</p>

  <p>"And a long tail!" roared the third.</p>

  <p>Sounds of slamming doors and hurrying footsteps filled the hotel. A group
  began togather on the porch. Big Bill Koggs appeared, rubbing his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What seems to be the trouble?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"It's thirty feet long!" replied the first fisherman.</p>

  <p>"It has jaws like a shark!" cried the second.</p>

  <p>"Flippers like a seal!" yelled the third.</p>

  <p>"It's a sea serpent!" added the first.</p>

  <p>"With red eyes!" bellowed the second.</p>

  <p>"And a long tail!" added the third.</p>

  <p>"It came up right beside our boat!" they concluded in chorus.</p>

  <p>The story spread like measles. At the Hot Springs Hotel nothing else was
  discussed, and at each repetition the monster gained new anatomical details.
  By the time the breakfast dishes had been cleared away, there was no one at
  Oluk Lake who did not know that the creature, appearing first as a huge gray
  dorsal fin, had slithered up through the lapping waves in its entire
  enormity, lingered a few minutes on the surface, its sides pulsating as with
  deep respirations, and then sunk slowly from sight.</p>

  <p>News of the phenomenon trickled out to the incredulous world, and nearby
  newspapers published the story with a wealth of amazing details. More
  cautious press associations sent it out, much condensed and qualified by "it
  was said" and "it was reported by alleged observers," to the great journals
  of the country. Learned scientists replied in the academic equivalent of
  "there ain't no such animal," and the debate attracted nation-wide
  interest.</p>

  <p>Big Bill Koggs preserved an attitude of neutral skepticism.</p>

  <p>"I ain't heard," he stated, "of no new sport model fish being put out this
  year. I'll have to see the thing first."</p>

  <p>Just one week after the first appearance of the monster&mdash;on the
  following Friday, to be precise&mdash;the thing happened again. This time
  there was no room for doubt. Now that its rooms were all full and reserved in
  advance, the Hot Springs Hotel was renting tents to the overflow crowd. It
  may have been partly because of the uncomfortable sleeping equipment provided
  with this emergency housing that there was a crowd of early risers on the
  hotel porch and about the lake when, in the first light of a new day, the
  mysterious beast raised its awful gray bulk through the dark water, heaved
  its ponderous sides in rhythmic pulsations and then submerged.</p>

  <p>This time the newspapers treated the affair more respectfully, and
  congestion at the hotel became acute. Among the early arrivals was Professor
  Ignatius Harvale, than whom no living authority could boast a closer intimacy
  with the extinct monsters of past ages.</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it," the professor commanded each and every individual
  to whom the unknown creature had revealed itself. "Your information may be
  the means of bridging the gap between the Jurassic and the Cretaceous
  dinosaurs. Think of it!"</p>

  <p>Then he translated into perfectly unintelligible notes the eager accounts
  of the favored spectators.</p>

  <p>"It is truly marvelous," declared the professor to Big Bill Koggs, as the
  proprietor vainly sought to escape to the boiler room. "I am convinced that
  this creature is a survivor from remote ages&mdash;nothing less than an
  icthyosaurus!"</p>

  <p>"Icky what?" gasped Bill.</p>

  <p>"Icthyosaurus, the dominant marine reptile of the mesozoic age, millions
  of years ago. Its fossil remains abound in certain European and South
  American strata."</p>

  <p>"Gosh!" said Bill. "Millions of years old and still in runnin'
  order&mdash; that's some durability, ain't it, perfessor?"</p>

  <p>Three representatives of rival feature syndicates pressed about them.</p>

  <p>"What is it, professor?" they demanded as one.</p>

  <p>The professor drew into his shell and closed the shell in the conventional
  pose of a fossilized oyster.</p>

  <p>"I have been misquoted in the press so often," he stated, "that I dislike
  to make any direct comment. My published monograph on this phenomenon will
  appear at the proper time."</p>

  <p>The reporters drew Bill Koggs aside.</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" they insisted.</p>

  <p>Big Bill was desperate. These men must be disposed of before the springs
  went cold again.</p>

  <p>"He said," replied Bill, "that the critter's first name is Icky. I forget
  its last name, but it's millions of years old."</p>

  <p>"Wow!" said a reporter, slapping his deadly rival on the back. "Icky! Oh,
  that's great! Won't that give the headline boys something to work on! Come
  on, gang, 1et's get together on this and cook up a good one!"</p>

  <p>The result was all that P.T. Barnum could have desired, and more. Bill
  Koggs was obliged to telegraph a rush order for more tents&mdash;auto tents,
  pup tents, anything to house the frenzied crowd that surged around the Hot
  Springs Hotel and ate in relays in its spacious dining room. Mr. Koggs had no
  time even to compute his profits.</p>

  <p>Friday at dawn being now established as Icky's regular breathing time, the
  next Thursday brought an influx that made the Hot Springs Hotel look like an
  overgrown gold camp. One of the fresh arrivals was conspicuous, even in this
  hectic throng, for the natty splendor of his attire. Finding Bill Koggs in
  earnest conversation with his Indian aid, the dressy guest approached with a
  let's-be-friends-again smile.</p>

  <p>"Jake Bruno!" exclaimed Bill. "I didn't think you'd have the nerve to come
  here, after the dirty deal you give me!"</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" said Mr. Bruno. "That was a bit raw, wasn't it, Bill? Well, I've
  felt pretty bad about it, and I've come to take the place off your hands.
  I'll give you back just what you paid for it, Bill. How's that for a fair
  offer?"</p>

  <p>"It's all wet," said Bill. "I'm makin' money on this here layout now, and
  I'm goin' to keep right on. You couldn't buy me out if you was as rich as you
  look, and you ain't."</p>

  <p>With which remark Bill turned his back on J. Claudius Bruno and strode to
  the hotel garage, where his two assistants were busy changing tires.</p>

  <p>Bruno's face reddened until it matched his tie.</p>

  <p>"Damme!" the Indian heard him mutter. "Imagine that guy getting high hat
  with me! Well, he'll sell to me, or he'll wish he had, if I have to sink his
  pet sea serpent. No greasy garage mechanic can make a fool out of Claudius
  Bruno!"</p>

  <p class="first">FRIDAY dawned, as Fridays did at Oluk Lake. There was a
  streak of light above the eastern tree&mdash;tops, a ripple on the water, and
  a gray bulk emerging from the depths, blending with the dark water, but dimly
  visible to the eager crowd on shore.</p>

  <p>From a hilltop beside the hotel a rifle cracked, and a bullet struck the
  water a few feet away from the behemoth of the deep. A second shot seemed to
  find its mark, for lcky shuddered horribly, listed to port, and vanished.</p>

  <p>A cry of protest welled from the crowd, but the deed was done.</p>

  <p>Big Bill Koggs, pushing his way to the front rank of spectators, ran head
  on into Professor Ignatius Harvale, who was frantic with indignation.</p>

  <p>"To think," stormed the antiquarian, "that any one in this enlightened age
  would be so basely, so abysmally ignorant as to shoot the only living
  icthyosaurus! Think of the opportunity lost to science! Why, we have
  thousands of dead icthyosauri, but this was the only one alive&mdash;think of
  it!"</p>

  <p>Grappling for the carcass was dis- cussed, but the lake near shore was
  deep and the proper equipment was lacking. It was suggested that the body
  might rise to the surface after a while. No one seemed eager to engage hand
  to mouth, so to speak, with a wounded and possibly angry icthyosaurus, so the
  crowd settled down to await developments.</p>

  <p>The next morning an insomniac tent dweller reported that in the dead of
  night he had seen two large men, one looking like a bronze statue in the
  moonlight and the other dressed in a mechanic's overalls, meet before the
  hotel, go together to the garage, and presently emerge thence and push out on
  the lake in a boat. There had been a short glow of light over the water, as
  if some one in the boat had struck a match, and then the tent dweller had
  gone back and tried again to sleep.</p>

  <p>The dawn of another Friday found the Oluk Lake population in breathless
  suspense. As the stars faded in the east, every vantage point on the lake
  shore and the hotel porch was occu- pied. Was Icky dead, or would he come up
  for his weekly breath of air?</p>

  <p>A ruddy streak appeared over the tree&mdash;tops, and still the surface of
  the water was as a mirror. Then two men were seen getting into a boat and
  shoving off from the landing. They were Professor Harvale and J. Claudius
  Bruno.</p>

  <p>"I want to see this thing close up," said Bruno.</p>

  <p>"Your interest," stated the professor, "is no less keen than mine."</p>

  <p>A tense silence gripped the crowd as the boat moved slowly over the glassy
  water. Day was dawning. Small objects were becoming visible. The monster was
  overdue.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a shrill cry from the boat. The bow of the little craft
  tilted upward, and Bruno and the professor, clinging desperately together,
  splashed noisily into the water. Then the watchers on shore saw, beside the
  overturned boat, the ponderous mass of the monster from the deep. Paying no
  heed to the two wild-eyed creatures who stared at him over the bottom of
  their boat, Icky lingered on the surface, worked his great sides in
  undulating rhythm, and slowly sank from sight.</p>

  <p>Bruno and the professor were dragged shivering into another boat, and a
  dense circle of humanity pressed around them on the landing.</p>

  <p>"Marvelous!" said the professor. "It is truly an icthyosaurus. There's
  nothing else it could be. Most remarkable of all, I actually saw the place
  where the bullet pierced its hide. The wound is now marked by a red
  spot&mdash;think of it!"</p>

  <p>Big Bill Koggs elbowed his way nonchalantly through the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Did Icky show?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Did he?" echoed a bystander. "He attacked two men in a boat and dumped
  'em in the water!"</p>

  <p>"So it's you again," said Bill, gazing on the haggard features of Bruno.
  "What you tryin' to do to my Icky?"</p>

  <p>"I w-w-wanted," chattered Bruno, "to s-see if it was real. Gosh, it is!
  Bill, I'll double my offer for this hotel!"</p>

  <p>"Not enough," replied Bill. "Three times!" said Bruno. "You paid me ten
  thousand. I'll give you thirty."</p>

  <p>"Sold!" said Bill.</p>

  <p>The rest of the story may be told in three telegrams. The first, dated
  August 27, and addressed to "William Koggs, Acme Garage, Butte, Montana," was
  a day-message, prepaid, rush:</p>

  <p style="font-size:1.1em; margin-left:15%; text-indent:0"><tt>MONSTER HAS
  NOT SHOWED FOR THREE WEEKS. GUESTS LEAVING. HOW ABOUT IT?<br>
  BRUNO.</tt></p>

  <p>Big Bill's reply&mdash;a day-message, collect, addressed to "J. Claudius
  Bruno, Hot Springs Hotel, Oluk Lake, Montana "&mdash;was prompt and
  instructive:</p>

  <p style="font-size:1.1em; margin-left:15%; text-indent:0"><tt>PERHAPS YOU
  FORGOT TO BLOW ICKY UP.<br>
  FIND AIR PUMP AND RELEASE VALVE IN BOILER ROOM.<br>
  W. KOGGS.</tt></p>

  <p>A week later Big Bill had another message&mdash;a night-message,
  collect&mdash;to send his friend at Oluk Lake:</p>

  <p style="font-size:1.1em; margin-left:15%; text-indent:0"><tt>SORRY TO LEARN
  OF YOUR GREAT LOSS. ICKY WAS MADE OF OLD INNER TUBES.<br>
  YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE GAVE HIM MORE THAN TWELVE POUNDS PRESSURE.<br>

  <h3> I</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE is still a mild feeling of surprise amongst certain
  circles of society at what is held to be the inexplicable conduct of Charles
  Montagu Stuart. So far as people can see, there is not the slightest reason
  why he should have given up his friends and his career and his beautiful
  estate in Devonshire to go and live on a more or less remote island a
  thousand miles or so from the Californian coast. There, is, of course, no
  scandal, because whatever Stuart's other failings may be, he is essentially a
  clean-living man, with a fine athletic record, and his property is absolutely
  unencumbered. It is usual in such cases to quote the old time-honoured
  phrase, 'cherchez la femme,' and in this respect it seems to the wiseacres
  that they have got to the bottom of the business. For, beyond all question,
  Mr. Charles Montagu Stuart is a married man, and not even his most intimate
  friend has ever had the privilege of seeing his wife.</p>

  <p>Of course, all sorts of things are said about Mrs. Stuart. There are
  people who look solemn, and hint that they might say a good deal if they
  liked, but that it is best to be charitable. There are others who declare
  that Stuart has fallen a victim to an adventuress who possesses a great
  fascination for him. But this theory is slightly weakened by the fact that
  the Stuarts never come to England, where an assured position would be opened
  to the mysterious lady. As a matter of fact, nobody knows anything, and if
  society were really aware of the personality of Mrs. Charles Montagu there
  would be something like a sensation in Belgravia and Mayfair. For Charles
  Montagu Stuart can trace his descent without a shadow of a doubt back to the
  'Merrie Monarch,' and, as far as blood is concerned, he is the equal of any
  prince whose name figures in the Almanach de Gotha.</p>

  <p>It is now four years since people were beginning to ask themselves how
  much longer the state of things in the kingdom of Asturia was going to last.
  In these democratic times the world has little use for a scoundrel, even
  though he happens to be the occupant of a throne, and King Paul of Asturia
  was, perhaps, the choicest specimen of a finished blackguard that Europe
  possessed. Everybody knows how he came to the throne, and the act of
  bloodthirsty treachery that placed him there. In his day, King Paul must have
  been both clever and fascinating, or he would never have succeeded in
  persuading Princess Marie of Rheinbad to share his heart and throne. In the
  eyes of most people, the Grand Duke of Rheinbad is a philanthropist and a man
  of marked piety. There are others who regard him as a puritanical scoundrel,
  and one of the most successful humbugs who ever lived. At any rate, though
  the Grand Duke is a model of piety and the second son of a great reigning
  sovereign, he appeared to be quite willing, not to say eager, to see his
  daughter seated on the throne of Asturia. There were those who cried shame
  upon a match like this, but diplomatic reason prevailed, and Europe for the
  most part looked on complacently. Sentimentalists shuddered at the idea of a
  match between this drunken roue and a girl as bright and fascinating as the
  Princess Marie. But there it was, and there was an end of it. The Press no
  longer contained accounts of the princess's brilliant escapades. She was
  supposed to have settled down under the weight of her responsibilities and
  become a model queen. As a matter of fact, no slave in the Roman market, no
  poor Circassian girl sold into the terrors of the harem had a more cruel
  existence than Queen Marie. For three years this dreadful life continued, and
  then there was something like hope at last.</p>

  <p>The people of Asturia had quite enough of it. They were getting tired of
  the king they seldom saw; they were groaning under oppression and tyranny
  which it was almost impossible to bear. Yet nobody who had a casual
  acquaintance of the city of Parva would have guessed the seething discontent
  which was festering beneath the surface. At any rate, Charles Montagu Stuart
  was not troubling himself much about that. For Parva just now was the gayest
  of the gay. There was one continual round of festivities. The cafes were
  thronged with a brilliant assemblage of visitors. There was little sign of
  poverty or distress here. Night after night Stuart was out somewhere or
  another. In his opinion there were no festivities elsewhere in Europe to
  compare with the public dances which were such a feature in the social life
  of Parva. And there was another reason, too. On one or two occasions lately
  Stuart had met a fascinating personality at these dances, and the flirtation
  had gone very far indeed. He had not the remotest notion who the girl
  was&mdash;but, then, in the brilliant Bohemian circle in which he mixed, a
  trifle like this mattered nothing. For the most part, these dances took the
  form of the bal masque, a favourite form of amusement to the Parvians, and
  thus the affair had the fascination which otherwise it might not have
  possessed. All that Stuart knew or cared was the fact that his lady friend
  was young and fascinating and beautiful, and he was not the less impressed
  because she had refused to give him her name, and had intimated that any
  excess of curiosity on his part would put an abrupt end to their
  acquaintance.</p>

  <p>The last big dance which Stuart attended took place in the town hall at
  Parva on the night of November 14, 1903. Observing people noticed a very
  great lack of men, and that the military were more or less conspicuous by
  their absence. There had been strange hints and insinuations of late, and one
  or two diplomatists were having an anxious time of it. But this was not
  worrying Charles Stuart much, except that the anxiety was reflected to a
  certain extent in the beautiful eyes of his companion, who was obviously
  quite unhappy.</p>

  <p>She had taken off her mask for a moment or two in the interval of a dance.
  She leant her golden head wearily against a bank of flowers. Evidently she
  was not herself tonight. Stuart was tender and sympathetic. He was wearing
  his very best manner, but could not win a smile from his companion.</p>

  <p>"What is troubling you to-night, cherie?" he asked. "Why are you so sad?
  Is there nothing that I can do for you?"</p>

  <p>The girl looked up, her eyes filled with tears. She replaced her mask
  hastily as a young officer in uniform bustled up and slipped a note into her
  hand. He was so young that even Stuart's feeling of jealously was disarmed.
  He saw the note opened, and after a hasty glance torn in to a thousand
  fragments. The mysterious woman's manner changed now; she became alert and
  vigorous.</p>

  <p>"I must go," she whispered. "I cannot stay another moment. There is
  danger, and I must be at my post."</p>

  <p>"And where may that be?" Stuart asked.</p>

  <p>"At the castle," the fair stranger replied. "You did not know, perhaps,
  that I am connected with the Court. You may possibly have guessed it. But
  there is trouble on foot to-night&mdash;trouble so serious that all Asturia
  may be in a blaze to-morrow. And there is only one man to blame for it."</p>

  <p>"You are speaking of the King," Stuart murmured.</p>

  <p>The sensitive lips below the black velvet mask hardened.</p>

  <p>"Who else?" she asked bitterly "Not that it matters in the least; there
  will soon be an end of all that. It only wants one brave man to put the match
  to the powder, and Asturia will be free. Hark! Did you hear that? What is
  it?"</p>

  <p>Stuart strained his ears to listen.</p>

  <p>"I am not quite sure," he said slowly. "It sounded to me very much like
  the sound of a rifle shot."</p>

  <h3> II</h3>

  <p class="first">THEY were hurrying along now through the strangely silent
  deserted streets in the direction of the castle&mdash;that grim fortress that
  frowns down upon Parva, the stronghold from which many a tyrant ruler of
  Asturia has cowed his subjects by a display of armed force. There was a
  feeling of tragedy in the air, there was something ominous in the very
  silence of the roads and boulevards, which as a rule at that time of night
  teemed with life and gaiety. The glamour of adventure was upon Stuart now;
  his spirits rose as he strode along by the side of his companion.</p>

  <p>They stood at length under the shadow of the castle walls. The woman
  stretched out her hand and knocked twice upon a small oak doorway. A man in
  uniform threw back the gate and started as he saw who his summoner was. He
  drew himself smartly up to attention and saluted gravely. Nevertheless, his
  aspect was suspicious and he hesitated just a moment as Stuart followed.</p>

  <p>"Stay here," the woman whispered. "I many want you; on the contrary, I may
  not. It is good to know that I have at least one honest gentleman upon whom I
  can depend, and if anything happens to you to-night, your blood will be upon
  my unhappy head."</p>

  <p>"I am prepared to risk that," Stuart said passionately.</p>

  <p>The woman held out her hand, and Stuart caught it to his lips. A moment
  later and he was alone. The fraction of a second saw the place plunged in the
  deepest gloom. Stuart was standing there vague and mystified, in a darkness
  which could be felt. It was no pleasant position, but he was not going to
  draw back now. That great events were being born he did not doubt for a
  moment. It was just possible that not far off a handful of oppressed and
  impatient Asturians were making history with rapid and complete success. As
  he stood there, his ears strained, there suddenly uprose a tremendous
  cry&mdash;the still air hummed to the sound of rifle shots. Out of the
  darkness somewhere came a body of unseen men, palpitating and growling like
  so many wolves who scent their prey. How he progressed and where he was going
  Stuart had not the least idea. He only knew that he was carried off his feet
  by the rush, that he was borne up a flight of narrow stairs into a long stone
  corridor, at the end of which a solitary light gleamed. The atmosphere was
  heavy and pungent now with the smell of powder; a dropping volley of rifle
  fire was being carried on somewhere; there were yells and shrieks and groans
  and a steady crackling roar as if the place were on fire, and no attempt was
  being made to stifle the conflagration.</p>

  <p>Stuart was past surprise now, therefore it was no astonishment to him to
  note that for the most part the men around him were private citizens in
  evening dress. But apparently they had left the thin veneer of civilisation
  outside; they were like so many ravenous wolves now, and each man grasped a
  magazine rifle in his hand. There were scores more behind, pushing and
  struggling until the narrow passage was choked and gorged with this stream of
  infuriated humanity. Stuart drew a long breath of relief when at length he
  was forced through the passage into a big flagged hall beyond, where a
  handful of soldiers in uniform were firing indiscriminately into the
  advancing mob.</p>

  <p>Stuart could hear the pinging hum of bullets, he could hear the lead
  pattering dully against the stone walls; he saw more than one man throw up
  his hands, he saw more than one of those blazed shirt-fronts trickling red
  and bloody. It was all so swift and fierce, all in so short a span of time,
  that he could not grasp it yet. He saw the floor littered in black and white,
  like some ghastly tesselated pavement; he saw the little group of red
  uniforms wave and bend as the incoming rush poured over them. Then he saw a
  huge apartment, almost barbaric in its splendour, wherein stood a little man
  with red hair and a pimpled, blotched face like that of a ferret. The man was
  in uniform, with an order or two blazing on his breast, and, though Stuart
  was not acquainted with the personality of the King of Asturia, he wanted no
  one to tell that here was the man himself, and that his moments were
  numbered.</p>

  <p>A frenzied roar went up from a hundred throats, but the King did not
  flinch. Whatever his vices were, he was certainly no coward. He stood there
  with his back to the wall, a revolver in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Come here!" they yelled. "Come down and take it like a man. The
  Queen&mdash;where is the Queen? Let us make an end of the whole brood at the
  same time! The Queen!"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" others cried. "She is with us! She is with us! Whatever you do,
  save the Queen."</p>

  <p>These latter cries were drowned by the calls of the majority. There was
  another rush, which seemed to surge right over the man with the red hair.
  Stuart could see a dapper boot and a portion of the red silk sock quivering
  convulsively on the floor; then two heels came together, and the reign of
  King Paul of Asturia was at an end. A silence fell over the rioters now. They
  lifted up their late King and laid his body on the table. Just for an instant
  the storm ceased, but it broke out again presently with renewed vigour. By
  this time the more lawless of the populace had got a grip of what had taken
  place; they came surging in through the great iron gates; they filled the
  place with their hideous clamour. And above all the angry hum of voices there
  was that continuous, incessant roar which proclaimed the fact that the castle
  was on fire. There were thousands of people now yelling for the Queen. The
  lust of blood was upon them; common humanity was swept to the winds.</p>

  <p>Stuart's blood was boiling within him. He sighed for a squad of cavalry
  now to sweep these cowardly wretches away. And what harm had the Queen done
  them? There was no solitary soul there more the instrument of fate or the
  sport of circumstance than was Queen Marie.</p>

  <p>But the horrors were piling up now; the fire was drawing nearer, and the
  heat of the place was intense.</p>

  <p>Stuart turned to fight his way out. It was useless as well as dangerous
  for him to stay any longer. He wondered sadly enough what had become of his
  late companion in this inferno. He was realising now what he had lost. He
  plunged along, distracted and desperate, till he came face to face with a
  wall or flame. There was a corridor dark as the throat of a wolf on his left
  hand, and along this he turned, caring nothing what happened. It seemed to
  him that he could hear the sound of footsteps in front, as if his ear caught
  the sobbing breath of one who was in distress. Surely a woman was here? He
  could catch the subtle fragrance of her hair. She would have darted past him,
  but he stretched out a hand and detained her.</p>

  <p>"You can't go that way," he whispered. "The castle is on fire. Do not be
  afraid. I have not the honour of being an Asturian myself, but perhaps that
  is in my favour, for I am not a murderer."</p>

  <p>A white arm suddenly dropped round Stuart's shoulder. He felt a
  palpitating body quivering against his own. A faint voice called him by name;
  and then Stuart blessed all his gods and his guiding star, for here, surely
  enough, was his lady of the domino!</p>

  <p>"Steady," he whispered. "Hold up. For God's sake, don't give way now! Tell
  me which way to go, for I am going to save you."</p>

  <p>They were outside presently under the cold, cool air of heaven; they were
  struggling through a dense mob of people, the woman clinging to Stuart's arm
  and dragging her faltering legs behind her as if in the very paralysis of
  fear. She had a military cloak around her shoulders, and a helmet on her
  head. The collar of the cloak obscured her features. With all the courage and
  tenacity of despair, Stuart fought his way forward till the fringe of the
  crowd was reached. A small boy raised a shrill shout. He danced along in
  front of Stuart and his companion.</p>

  <p>"The Queen!" he screamed. "Here is the Queen!"</p>

  <p>There was no time for hesitation. Stuart reached out a long, sinewy hand,
  and caught the gamin by the throat. He did not relax his grip till they
  turned at length into a shady by-road with trees on either side. Here they
  walked along side by side till they came at length to where the moon was
  shining on the sea.</p>

  <h3> III</h3>

  <p class="first">FOR three whole days Stuart had seen nothing of his
  companion. She had sent him a message from her cabin from time to time that
  she hoped to be on deck to-morrow, when she would try and thank him for all
  his kindness. There were no European passengers on board that particular
  steamer, and Stuart was proportionately grateful. All be knew was that he had
  promised to accompany his mysterious friend to a certain island off the
  Californian coast, and what was going to happen after that he did not trouble
  to ask himself. In his masterful way he had his own views, but there would be
  plenty of time for expounding them later on. Meanwhile, he had been ashore,
  and had come back armed with a sheaf of papers, most of which were teeming
  with accounts of the recent events in Parva.</p>

  <p>Stuart sat himself down in a shady corner of the deck, with a cigarette,
  to read. There were columns upon columns of it, all containing more or less
  excellent accounts of the death of King Paul of Asturia. A Republic had been
  proclaimed. The Asturians had made up their minds to manage their own affairs
  in the future. If there was any sympathy felt for anybody, it was for the
  Queen. On calmer reflection, people were beginning to find that the trouble
  was nothing of her doing. She had done her best for the people, but, after
  all, she had been powerless to stem the incoming tide; she had been
  deliberately sold by her hypocritical old scoundrel of a father to put money
  in his pocket. Stuart smiled grimly as he thought what the Grand Duke of
  Rheinbad's feeling would be when he came to hear what a free an enlightened
  Press had to say about him.</p>

  <p>There was one deeper and more abiding mystery than all the others put
  together. The Queen had utterly and entirely disappeared; there was no trace
  of her to be found anywhere. Of course, it was more than possible that she
  had perished in the ruins of the castle, of which nothing remained but a few
  charred stones, to speak vengeance for a justly outraged people. The Queen
  had been seen in her private apartments just before the outbreak of
  hostilities, then she seemed to have vanished as completely as if the earth
  had swallowed her up. But still it was known that scores of unfortunate and
  innocent persons connected with the Court had perished in the flames, and
  yet, remarkable to say, no trace of the Queen's jewellery could be found
  either. Most of these jewels were historic, and a full description of them
  was given in the papers.</p>

  <p>It was nearly dinner time when Stuart was finished. There was still more
  to read as he sat on the deck in the moonlight. Presently there came to his
  side a pale, white, beautiful figure, and a hand was placed in his.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to see you again," he murmured. "Sit down here and let us talk,
  but don't let your mind dwell too much upon the past. You are safe enough for
  the future. I have been reading all that terrible business; it is even worse
  than I had expected. I shall dream of it for years to come. But for the
  terrible fate of the Queen, I should, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What of the Queen?" the tall woman asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah, of course, you don't know&mdash;you haven't read. They murdered the
  King, of course. Upon my word, when I come to understand things, I can hardly
  blame them. But the Queen has vanished; she has not left a single trace
  behind. Most people seem to think that she perished in the ruins of the
  castle."</p>

  <p>The woman by Stuart's side looked thoughtfully out to sea.</p>

  <p>"She would be quite content to accept that verdict," she said. "At any
  rate, she is at peace now. But don't let us talk about that now; let me try
  and thank you for all your goodness and kindness to me. You have never made
  the faintest effort to find out who I am, and for that I am grateful. All I
  want to do now is to forget, to go away from the hated past and to live a
  life of peace and seclusion somewhere where I can be my own mistress and
  attend to my own garden. I have no money, but I have many valuable jewels
  which I can dispose of to bring me more than enough for my requirements. If
  you will see me settled, then you will add one more debt, and, above all, I
  ask you to keep my secret. You are a gentleman, and I know I can trust you;
  in fact, I know who you are and all about you. Now, what do you think of
  these? Do you think I could dispose of a few of them at a time without
  attracting suspicion?"</p>

  <p>She drew from her pocket a shabby case or two, and threw back the lids so
  that the jewels sparkled like streams of fire under the soft southern
  moonlight. Stuart started back as if something had stung him. For a moment he
  did not speak; he was silent until he saw that his companion had turned her
  troubled eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>"Presently," he said in a strained voice. "First let me tell you
  something. It is a story of an Englishman of fortune and family who deemed
  himself impervious to woman's beauty and woman's wiles. Of course, he meant
  to marry eventually, for the sake of the name and the race, but that appeared
  to be a remote contingency. Then that Englishman went abroad and met his
  fate. He met her at a masked ball which shall be nameless; he hadn't the
  remotest idea who she was or what was her name. He knew she was a lady, or
  she would not have been connected so intimately with the Court circles. But I
  give you my word of honour that until a moment or two ago that foolish
  Englishman had no idea that he was making love to a real Queen. You believe
  me, don't you?"</p>

  <p>The woman faltered and hesitated. The sad, beautiful face was suffused in
  a crimson blush.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you the truth, Charles?" she whispered. "I did know you were
  in love with me&mdash;I have known it all along; but I know you will forgive
  me. Think that from my childhood till now I never had a single soul who cared
  a scrap for me. When I was old enough to understand, I was deliberately sold
  to a hateful scoundrel to put money in my father's pocket; and when you came
  along, and you did not know me, and you showed me what a good man's love can
  be, why, then the temptation was too great, and for once I allowed myself to
  be human."</p>

  <p>"You cared?" Stuart cried.</p>

  <p>"Well, why not? Do you suppose I am different from other people? Do you
  suppose I would have cared what people said? But then, the hands were too
  strong for me. My father would have hunted me all over the universe. Now,
  like everybody else, he deems me to be dead; he thinks that I went down in
  that awful cataclysm. And now let me make a confession. I was not going to
  tell you anything; I was going to let events take their own way; I was going
  to live like other women do, for love stretched out both hands to me, and
  from the bottom of my heart I was proud and grateful. But I might have known
  that happiness and myself were destined to be strangers. I will not ask you
  to forgive me. I suppose you recognised the description of the jewels, and
  came to the conclusion that I am&mdash;well, that I am what I am."</p>

  <p>"And thank God for that!" Stuart said in a tone that he strove in vain to
  render steady. "Would I have you anything else? It is the woman that I love.
  Our secret is our own, and if we act discreetly no one will be any the wiser.
  Perhaps, later on, when it pleases a benign Providence to remove your father
  from his sorrowing subjects, we may come back to England again. Dearest, is
  there another word to say?"</p>

  <p>She stretched out her hands to his.</p>

  <p>"Not one," she whispered; "no, not one."</p><br>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Townsville Daily Bulletin</i>, Australia, 14 May
  1929</h3><br>

  <p class="first">LEONARD ANTONY FOX sat in his weekend cottage on the edge of
  Swinford Heath golf links nursing a sprained ankle. He was quite alone in his
  luxurious nest, for he had deliberately sent his solitary factotum away for
  an hour or two so that he might have the place to himself when his anonymous
  correspondent of a few days before came to keep a more or less secret
  interview which had been arranged through the medium of the box office of a
  popular London daily paper. The sprained ankle was a bit of a nuisance,
  because the business might be part of a trap, but Fox was not the man to
  flinch whatever happened. He knew that sooner or later the man Swiney would
  seek to get his revenge.</p>

  <p>Swiney was the one to be really feared&mdash;as to the rest of the gang
  Fox could afford to treat them with contempt. But, given the chance and a
  clear opening, Swiney would not hesitate at murder to get those diamonds back
  again.</p>

  <p>Not that they really were his diamonds. Fox told himself, as he sat there
  in his lonely cottage late at night waiting the coming of his anonymous
  correspondent. By every law of right and justice, save the cold legal side of
  the affair, those stones were the property of Leonard Antony Fox. They had
  been found on the claim near Parrsberg, which he had located himself. He had
  been too busy to register his claim, and Swiney and his creatures had jumped
  it and completed the necessary legal forms with the Diamond Fields
  Commissioner.</p>

  <p>It was not till this had happened that Swiney came out in his true
  colours. The diamonds a fortune in themselves, belonged to him and his
  unsavoury satellites. Fox could go to the devil so far as they were
  concerned, but not a cent was he going to get. They jeered at him for a fool
  who did not know how to take care of his own, and bade him begone.</p>

  <p>But they had reckoned without the grit and dogged courage that comes of
  breeding and a public school training. Fox had gone out to South Africa to
  seek his fortune, and since luck had literally made love to him he was not
  going to throw her smiles aside without a struggle. So he held on to Swiney's
  gang, swearing and grumbling and abiding his time, what time the others
  called him a white-livered cur.</p>

  <p>Then the hour came to strike, and Fox struck like a tornado. He fought the
  gang single-handed on the way down to Cape Town, a desperate affray with
  revolvers in it, and when the dust cleared away the stones were in his
  pocket, and Swiney lay by the roadside with a bullet through his lungs.</p>

  <p>So Fox came back to England a rich man, after all. So far he had made no
  effort to get rid of the stones, feeling that he had not yet heard the last
  of Swiney. And, moreover in the eye of the law those diamonds were legally
  the properly of Swiney, who had registered the claim in his own name. Swiney
  was not the man to be shaken off as easily as that. Even the fact that he was
  badly 'wanted' in more than one country would not deter him from what would
  be at the least a nasty scandal. If there was only a way of getting rid of
  the scoundrel so far as England was concerned, Fox would be content.
  Something to drive him out of the country, never daring to return.</p>

  <p>Fox sat there in his sitting-room under the electric light impatiently
  awaiting the advent of his anonymous correspondent. He came presently, humbly
  knocking on the front door and timidly entering at a shout from Fox. A
  little, red-haired man who carried his sly character on his weak yet cunning
  face. Jackal was written all over him. A parasite and hanger on of superior
  animals of prey and as cowardly as his prototype.</p>

  <p>"Sit down!" Fox commanded. "So it's you, is it? Ginger Joe. Swiney's
  little dog. Come from him, eh?"</p>

  <p>"It's not quite like that, sir," Joe cringed. "I'm out with Swiney, curse
  him! That's why I wrote to you. Done all his dirty work for years, and now
  nothing but the dirty kick out. Me as planned the details of that Mere Croft
  robbery."</p>

  <p>Fox nodded&mdash;that famous burglary had been the sensation in the Press
  a fortnight ago.</p>

  <p>"A fine haul that Joe," he said.</p>

  <p>"Ay, I believe you. Not much risk and Swiney waiting round the corner for
  the swag. A fast car what was stolen and the boodle in a shabby suitcase
  smothered with foreign labels. What's that? Where's the stuff now? Ask
  Swiney. Left luggage office in some London terminus if you ask me. But not
  for long. The gang's cutting it thick at the Envoy Hotel. Private suite. Rich
  men from Australia game. By this time the Mere Croft stuff is in Swiney's
  hotel bedroom or I'm the biggest mug out. It was to tell you that and a bit
  more as brought me here tonight. Now next Thursday night about ten
  o'clock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's Peace Night," Fox interpolated.</p>

  <p>"Course it is. That's why the gang chose it. There's going to be a big
  dance that night at the Envoy with about two thousand guests with Swiney and
  the rest of the gang very prominent. In the crush Swiney sneaks off and comes
  down here knowing you are on your back helpless like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh he knows that, does he?" Fox smiled.</p>

  <p>"Sure thing, boss. A fast racer will bring him here and get him back
  within two hours. As you ain't parted with the stones he thinks they are
  hidden here and means to get them. And he means to murder you at the same
  time. After that he can put up an alibi that no lawyer can shake. Seen on and
  off at the dance all the evening by lots of his new hangers on and standing
  fizz galore. And the rest of the gang helping. 'Seen Swiney?' 'I saw him five
  minutes ago in the cocktail bar.' Repeated loud. See the game? Easy as kiss
  your hand."</p>

  <p>"Quite," Fox agreed. "But where do I come in? Why did you make up your
  mind to tell me all this?"</p>

  <p>"Told you already," Joe grunted. "Gang turned me out and left me without a
  bob. On my uppers. Not daring to give them away. So I came here to ask you
  for fifty of the best so that I could sling it to America where I got
  friends. Is it a go?"</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later Joe left the cottage with a roll of notes in his pocket,
  and Fox sat down to think.</p>

  <p>"Less than a week to strike a real blow," he told himself as he sat in his
  chair. "Curse this ankle of mine, I'll get old Chris Cadell to run down and
  talk matters over. Nobody like old Chris in an emergency like this."</p>

  <p>With that Fox turned to his elaborate wireless set, and for the next hour
  forgot his troubles in listening to Madrid.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">Promptly to a telephone call the wily and volatile Cadell
  turned up the following night. A man of leisure now, he had played a fine
  part in the great war as an intelligent officer, and still loved an adventure
  for its own sake. Also he already knew all there was to tell about the
  diamond business.</p>

  <p>"I see your point," he said, when Fox had described the matter of Ginger
  Joe's visit. "The last thing you want is a stink. Drive Swiney out of England
  for good and the incident is closed so far as you are concerned. With the
  facts of the Mere Croft robbery in your possession you can easily give the
  police the office and get him five years. After that when he has nothing
  further to fear he will be at you again."</p>

  <p>"Bang on the bull," Fox agreed. "Just what I fear. Now can you see any way
  of driving Swiney abroad for keeps?"</p>

  <p>A slow smile dawned on Cadell's keen sensitive face.</p>

  <p>"The brain-wave works," he cried. "Came to me almost before you had
  finished your lament, listen to me."</p>

  <p>It was a lot that Cadell had to say and he said it slowly and
  deliberately. When he had finished Fox grinned delightedly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm dashed," he grinned. "Some scheme, old man, that. But where
  precisely do I come in?"</p>

  <p>And Cadell proceeded to tell him. A grateful Leonard Antony Fox held out a
  hand almost reverently.</p>

  <p>"Shake, learned Cadi," he whispered, "shake."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">It wanted but a few minutes to eleven on the night of Peace
  celebrations that the crook known to a select circle as Swiney came slinking
  up to the cottage on the links like the wolf that he was with greed and
  revenge and murder in his heart. It had been no difficult matter to get away
  from the glittering turmoil of the great peace gathering at the Envoy Hotel.
  A big fur coat hidden behind a bank of palms in one of the dancing rooms, a
  deserted car in a aide street, and a convenient service staircase close by
  had enabled him to get away without being seen and thus away on his murderous
  errand. So far, so good.</p>

  <p>He knew his route exactly. In disguise he had been over it more than once
  before. With any luck, the passing of an hour and a half would see him back
  in the hotel again, and in that time his two confederates would see to it
  that he was not missed. It was all a matter of a little careful camouflage.
  And then, when the big job was done, he and his gang would get away from
  England with the proceeds of the Mere Croft burglary plus the fortune in
  diamonds which Swiney was on his way to get now.</p>

  <p>So far everything had moved according to plan. And here he was on the
  threshold of murderous adventure without a single hitch. He had pushed the
  fast racing car into a tangle of heather hard by Fox's cottage, and now stood
  outside it ready and eager to be getting along with his task.</p>

  <p>Twice did he creep round the lonely cottage without hearing a sound from
  within. No doubt Fox had retired long ago, and, with any luck, was probably
  fast asleep. His man must also be in the same state of blissful
  unconsciousness in the cockloft above which served him for a bedroom. Very
  gently Swiney pushed back the catch of the scullery window and as gently
  stepped into the passage. So far the sinister gods of night were with
  him.</p>

  <p>But the quiet was not entirely unbroken. From the sitting-room-hall
  houseplace came the faint strains of music. Dance music beyond the shadow of
  a doubt. Somebody playing there in the darkness. Strange sort of thing to do,
  Swiney thought.</p>

  <p>"The devil," he muttered. "Not gone to bed then. But why should he sit
  there in the dark?"</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it now but to take Fox unawares. Drop in on him and
  flash a light in his face and at the same time confront him at the business
  end of a revolver. Swiney crept on into the grateful warmth of the room,
  gaining courage as he proceeded. Nothing moved. There was no sound of
  breathing, no sound of a body moving in a chair. The sixth sense of the
  trained burglar told Swiney that he was alone. And then he understood.</p>

  <p>A wireless set, of course. Swiney had never seen or heard one before, but
  he had read a lot about them. He could see the faint glow of the valves in
  the black gloom. Careless of Fox, no doubt. Gone to his room doubtless
  without switching off the L. T. and the aerial, and gone to bed in ignorance
  of the fact. So much the better, perhaps, Swiney crept forward.</p>

  <p>Then there was a sharp click and the whole place sprang into a bath of
  dazzling light. In the ingle close to the wireless set Fox was seen seated in
  his armchair with a weapon in his hand and that weapon in a direct line with
  Swiney's head.</p>

  <p>"Stand still," the crisp command came. "An inch and I fire. You are armed,
  Swiney, and as a burglar thus equipped I am justified in shooting to kill.
  Turn your back on me. Thanks. Slip a hand into your hip pocket and drop your
  gun on the floor. Once more thanks. Sit there and listen to me."</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to obey.</p>

  <p>"That's better," Fox smiled. "In a way I have been expecting you. The next
  move is yours. Go on."</p>

  <p>Swiney was beginning to collect his scattered wits. After all, he had a
  few leading cards to play.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," he swaggered. "About those diamonds. I'm not
  unreasonable. Share and share alike and say no more about it. The stones are
  here, of course."</p>

  <p>"Not within miles," Fox said with a sincerity that carried conviction with
  it. "Intelligent anticipation my friend. But that bluff doesn't go. You came
  here for the lot and my life as well. Smart of you to realise so quickly that
  the dice were loaded against you and be ready for a deal, but I risked my
  life for my own and that I propose to retain."</p>

  <p>"And if I go to the Courts about it?' Swiney sneered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see the point," Fox agreed. "But you won't do that for reasons
  which I am going to make obvious. And I'm not going to hand you over to the
  police for another reason. This time I am going to get rid of you for
  ever."</p>

  <p>As Fox spoke he stretched out his hand and slightly twirled a knob on his
  wireless. Instantly the music swelled until it filled the room. Beyond it was
  a din of voices and ripple of applause. From out of it rang a voice loud and
  clear:</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Tony. Can you hear me, Tony?"</p>

  <p>In the ether somewhere a clock was striking twelve.</p>

  <p>"Sounds cheerful, what?" Fox asked. "A reveller calling to his mate. From
  some dance, probably. You recognise the cacophony of a jazz band. Somebody
  there is calling to somebody else who is not present. A sort of mild joke on
  the part of the said Tony's friend. Does it convey anything to you?"</p>

  <p>("Hullo, Tony. Can you hear me, Tony?")</p>

  <p>The constant cry was beginning to get on Swiney's nerves. There was a
  cursed trap behind this somewhere and he could not do more than merely sense
  it. He was feeling as helpless as a child who is being teased.</p>

  <p>"I see you are puzzled," Fox went on. "Let me give you what is called a
  light. That Mere Croft burglary."</p>

  <p>Swiney gasped and swallowed. The trap was in sight now.</p>

  <p>"A fine coup," Fox smiled, "and a perfect getaway. Not a bad idea to hide
  the swag in your bedroom at the Envoy Hotel. There at the present moment,
  isn't it? And the rest of your gang ruffling it with the best of them on the
  dance-floor of the Envoy at the present moment. But not for long,
  Swiney&mdash;not for long. Ah!&mdash;I thought it was coming."</p>

  <p>Again the voice spoke through space but with a difference.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Tony! Our friends in blue have gone up to No. 47 bedroom and
  taken a party with them. I'm off now, Tony."</p>

  <p>The voice faded away and was heard no more. Fox switched off the set.
  Swiney looked up swiftly, a horrible thought stirring him to the depths of
  his black soul.</p>

  <p>"What's the game?" he demanded, hoarsely. "Where did that music come from?
  And who spoke?"</p>

  <p>"Happen to remember my full name?" Fox queried.</p>

  <p>"Course!&mdash;Leonard Antony Fox. Tony! Curse you! Listening to what was
  going on at the Envoy Hotel, were we?"</p>

  <p>"Real clever of you to guess it," Fox purred. "And don't forget that my
  man in the ballroom mentioned a certain bedroom and gave the numbers. Yours,
  I think, Swiney."</p>

  <p>Swiney burst into a torrent of futile oaths.</p>

  <p>"Also my man at the other end spoke of a party in blue. Need I remind the
  wily Swiney that the police are so attired? The game is up, my friend. I laid
  a trap for you, and you have walked into it like an innocent child. I knew
  that you were coming here to-night and made my preparations accordingly. Also
  I knew all about that sensational burglary and where the swag was hidden.
  Even if my little scheme had failed your bedroom would have been raided
  to-night and your confederates arrested. They are under arrest at this very
  moment, and the stuff has been found in your room. And Scotland yard is after
  you."</p>

  <p>"So you say," Swiney mumbled.</p>

  <p>"So I have proved," Fox chortled. "The voice calling to Tony was my
  friend's voice. Direct from the Envoy Hotel. What he said passed in the
  general din, but I heard it. And when my friend gave the number of your room
  and spoke of the party in blue and their escort I knew that all was well with
  me. If you don't believe me, go back to the Envoy and see for yourself."</p>

  <p>Swiney lay back in his chair utterly beaten.</p>

  <p>"You cunning devil!" he breathed. "But you haven't finished yet. Why not
  nobble me with the others? Why this consideration for the man you have most
  cause to fear? Come, your ace!"</p>

  <p>"Wrong!" Fox smiled. "I have no occasion to fear you&mdash;now. But I
  might have had, after you had served your sentence, if I had sent you to
  penal servitude with the others. You can serve it now if you want to and then
  worry me afterwards, but I wanted to give you a choice. That's why the trap
  was laid by means of my wireless. Now, which is it to be&mdash;a long term in
  prison or a sporting chance of getting out of England with no possibility of
  ever returning? It's for you to decide."</p>

  <p>Swiney glared impotently at his tormentor.</p>

  <p>"I'm done!" he confessed miserably. "Well, if the choice has to be made it
  won't be the stone jug. My name's Walker. But if ever I catch you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good night!" Fox smiled. "Not that way, please! Keep clear of your late
  revolver. You might be tempted, you know."</p>

  <p>Without another word Swiney pushed out into the night, and once aboard his
  car turned to the south and held a course that pointed in the direction of
  the nearest port. With luck he had all the world before him and a total of
  much value in notes in his pocket always there for emergencies. And Leonard
  Antony Fox in his cottage slept the sleep of the just.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story10"
     name="story10">10.&mdash;A DOG'S LIFE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Sunday Times</i>, Perth, Australia, 19 Jan
  1930</h3><br>

  <p class="first">TO begin with, Mr. John Maggs, of somewhere in Bethnal
  Green, derived his inspiration from the 'gossip' column of his favorite
  evening paper. More than once he had derived considerable unearned increment
  from the same source. Paragraphs anent the rich and powerful and their
  treasures of gold and silver&mdash;especially gold stored away in remote
  country houses with owners blissfully unaware of the Maggs tribe on the
  lookout for such costly trifles. For that was precisely the sort of man John
  Maggs was. By day a worker in a garage, by night a lover of nocturnal rides
  on a motor bicycle but always with an eye to ultimate income.</p>

  <p>He liked that bit in the evening Press about Sir Walter Rumbelow of
  Brayside, near Margate, and the account of his wonderful collection of gold
  coins. Not as numismatic specimens, but as sterling which he knew how to melt
  down and dispose of at its full market value. Portable, too, Maggs
  reflected.</p>

  <p>So in due course, Maggs took a long week-end holiday together with his
  motor cycle. He located the cliffs of Bray from a guidebook, and found that
  Brayside was a large modern house on high ground overlooking the sea; indeed,
  the front of it was within three hundred yards of the cliff which at that
  point was as many feet above the tideway with two paths running along the
  basaltic bastion on which the house was perched. A score of yards below the
  wall, fencing Brayside from the cliff, was a sort of footpath which was a
  right of way and unfenced, and this path met with Mr. Maggs' decided
  approval. Firstly, because it was public and, in the next place, because a
  climb up the precipitous slope afforded an easy access to the grounds of
  Brayside House.</p>

  <p>Of a second public path down below and not more than a score of feet from
  high water mark, Maggs knew nothing. It was no sort of concern, anyway. Nor
  was he particularly keen on the upper path save for the fact that it was a
  distinct convenience. He was not accustomed to cliffs and that alarming steep
  slope ending three hundred feet below in the sea made him giddy and gave him
  an unpleasant sensation in the pit of his stomach.</p>

  <p>It looked to him that if a bloke happened to slip off the upper path he
  would be certain to drop to the bottom like a stone and dash his brains out
  on the rocks fringing the water. Had he known of the lower path not far above
  high water mark he might have been easier in his mind. Here and there, due to
  the passing of time or erosion, were long slides of slippery shale, and
  Maggs&mdash;not devoid of imagination&mdash;could picture a cove setting that
  grey avalanche in motion and after that&mdash;Blimey!</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact the danger was not as bad as it looked. Maggs might
  have seen that had it not been for a thick fringe of larch trees far down the
  giddy slope. These half hid the sea and by so doing, heightened the
  suggestion of a sheer precipice. The more Maggs studied the situation the
  less he liked it.</p>

  <p>But if he was to enter the grounds of Brayside House and come away again
  in comparative safety, there was no way save by the cliff path. That must
  form his entry and his egress unless he was prepared to take serious risks.
  And he was not prepared to take any risks that could be avoided.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the attack must be made from the upper cliff path and once
  having made up his mind to this, Maggs proceeded to commit to memory the
  exact lie of the land. More than that, he contrived to enter the area of
  operations by the simple process of swarming up the few feet of cliff above
  the public path and climbing into the domain sacred to Sir Walter Rumbelow.
  Lying perdu in a thicket of heather and gorse, for&mdash;save the lawns and
  garden&mdash;the owner had left the terrain in its wild beauty, the marauder
  had a full view of the house. Facing him, and not more than a hundred yards
  away, was the library where he knew those precious coins reposed in their
  locked cases.</p>

  <p>A big room with three long windows. Maggs knew this because he had learnt
  so much from a gossip in the village public house. Moreover, the gossip
  aforesaid was a jobbing carpenter who did work for Sir Walter from time to
  time. An old man, he had in his youth actually seen Brayside House built.
  Maggs regarded this Joe Gittens as a distinct manifestation of providence. He
  was as good as a guide and a plan of the house combined.</p>

  <p>Let it not be assumed that Maggs was taking undue risks in discussing
  Brayside House and its owner with Gittens. When the inevitable
  happened&mdash;and Maggs was sanguine on that head&mdash;it was inevitable
  also that Gittens would open his heart on the subject to the stranger who
  asked so many questions anent the place and was so liberal on the score of
  alcoholic refreshment.</p>

  <p>But that Maggs was prepared for and had fully discounted in advance. In
  reality Gittens had never seen the real Maggs or Watkins, as he preferred to
  call himself. As Watkins he presented a man with a thick thatch of silver
  grey plus Victorian side whiskers and a chin beard, the long upper lip being
  bare. Add a pair of brass-rimmed spectacles and the disguise was
  complete.</p>

  <p>Nor did Magg's precautions end there. If the raid proved a success, it was
  necessary to provide some rapid means of transport to a haven of safety
  before Sir Walter's servants discovered their employer's loss in the morning.
  The motor cycle was ready and snugly hidden not far off, for Maggs had not
  been so unwise as to come into the village riding his trusty steed. A disused
  barn and a bale of rotten hay afforded the necessary cover.</p>

  <p>Add to these strategic advantages the fact that Sir Walter Rumbelow was
  away from home for some days, and it will be seen that Maggs had little or
  nothing to fear&mdash;save one thing.</p>

  <p>There was no moon and the weather for the time of year was mild, but there
  was a little more fog hanging about than the burglar liked. There was fog at
  night and far into the morning, that blanket of fog which is one of the
  characteristics of the south coast in late autumn, especially when there was
  no wind as at the moment. And this fact worried Maggs because he would be
  compelled to follow the cliff path round the headland after securing the swag
  because it was imperative to avoid the village and the motor cycle lay in
  ambush in an opposite direction.</p>

  <p>The thought of that, to him perilous walk in utter darkness oppressed him
  like a nightmare. He knew that he could easily strike the cliff path after
  the raid, but if that cursed fog held, he might take a step too far and
  finish his career at the foot of the cliff and end as 'found drowned.' Still
  an occasional gleam from his flashlight might avert tragedy. But the fog held
  and on the third night, just before closing time, Maggs bade farewell to his
  village gossip.</p>

  <p>"Just time for one more," he said heartily. "Make the most of it for I
  leave to-morrow. Back to work, old sport, more's the pity. Well, so long.
  Take care of yourself."</p>

  <p>So, with every preparation made and his modest baggage on his back, Maggs
  set out on his errand. Up to a certain point the road along the cliff was
  easy&mdash;a wall on one side and a thick hedge on the other. Even in the fog
  no danger was to be feared so far. But, once beyond a wicket gate, the
  trouble began. So many yards would have to be traversed ere it was necessary
  to start climbing upwards at a right angle, until the boundary wall of Sir
  Walter's domain was reached. And these steps with his heart in his mouth
  Maggs counted. Just a hundred and seventeen of these he registered, then
  turned left and began to swarm up the heather clad slope until, with a sigh
  of relief he bumped into the boundary wall. He dropped over on the far side
  on to what seemed like turf under his feet. So far, so good.</p>

  <p>He crept on and on in the dead silence of the place until the house itself
  loomed up before him ghostly in the fog. Maggs was feeling easier now for he
  possessed a fine geographical sense and, moreover, he had visualised the
  landscape inch by inch by daylight. It was as if he had the whole world to
  himself. And, in the midst of it, a haunted house, forsaken and deserted. Not
  a single glimmer of light to be seen anywhere. Probably the whole domestic
  staff had taken French leave and gone off to the weekly dance in the parish
  hall.</p>

  <p>Not that Maggs was banking on this probability. He scouted round to the
  back of the house and thence to the garage, the door of which was open and no
  sign of the chauffeur in the blank window of his quarters overhead. No doubt
  Sir Walter had taken the car with him on his temporary departure from his
  home.</p>

  <p>Then the house was deserted. What blinkin' luck. Given one uninterrupted
  hour, or less, and Maggs would be away round the cliff path in search of the
  hidden motor-cycle awaiting him. And, if his luck held good, he would be home
  and asleep before those servants had discovered the robbery.</p>

  <p>Then back again to the front of the house. He stood on the ledge of the
  centre library window, working back the catch with a thin-bladed knife. It
  was as easy as kiss me 'and. The thick velvet curtains cautiously parted,
  Maggs was inside. There was a warm, comfortable smell of leather and
  underfoot a carpet so thick and soft that it was possible to move without the
  slightest sound. A quick flash round with a pocket lamp and Maggs caught his
  breath.</p>

  <p>Yes, there the boodle was&mdash;glittering and winking in the glow,
  thousands of coins, a large proportion of them gold. It was compact stuff
  that could be easily stowed away in a big inside pocket, and every ounce of
  it saleable at its face value&mdash;at least two thousand pounds as mere
  metal; the find of a lifetime.</p>

  <p>Maggs wasted no further time. Ere long most of those thin scraps of
  precious metal were transferred to his capacious pocket, and no sign of life
  within a hundred miles.</p>

  <p>And then suddenly there came a sort of glow through the thick curtains and
  what sounded like the hum of a car. After that voices in the hall and a flash
  of illumination, as if somebody had switched on the lights outside the
  library.</p>

  <p>"Dashed funny thing, Monty, old chap," one voice said. "But where the
  deuce is everybody? Withers, Withers, WITHERS."</p>

  <p>The cry echoed through the house, but the mysterious Withers had no reply.
  Withers was non est.</p>

  <p>"Nice game," the voice went on. "Dear old Nunky away and the servants off
  on some beano. Dashed if they haven't taken the faithful hound with 'em. You
  hang on here for a sec. Monty, whilst I go and have a look round."</p>

  <p>"Righto, old fruit," the invisible Monty rejoined.</p>

  <p>Maggs felt his way silently in the direction of the window. By sheer good
  luck he found his way there without disturbing any article of furniture en
  route. Who were these intruders, he asked himself, blowing in so
  unexpectedly. Relations of the old bloke, of course. And hadn't one of them
  said something about a dog? Maggs had seen no dog, he didn't want to see a
  dog&mdash;no right-minded burglar ever does. Noisy yapping brutes.</p>

  <p>Maggs was outside the window now, intent on making his way without delay
  to the spot where the motor-cycle awaited him. Once astride of that, he had
  little to fear. There was just a chance that those toffs might enter the
  library and if they did.....</p>

  <p>Maggs didn't want to think of it. All he wanted, like the Arabs in the
  poem, was to fold his tent and silently steal away.</p>

  <p>Outside the fog still dripped and clung. But Maggs knew his way. He had
  only to follow his nose and reach the boundary wall, then drop over into the
  heather, make a bee line for the cliff path, and thence to the cycle and
  safety. He hated the idea of that cliff path in the fog and inky darkness,
  but, once clear, an occasional pinpoint of flame from the pocket torch would
  suffice to guide him to safety and the high road to home, sweet home.</p>

  <p>He pushed on resolutely until the wall was close at hand. And then he was
  conscious of a sort of asthmatic wheezing a few inches behind him and
  something moist and damp and cold pressing against his left leg. Snakes in
  the heather, perhaps; Maggs had heard of such things&mdash;vipers that bit
  and sometimes killed people. It was only by sheer will that Maggs refrained
  from a shout.</p>

  <p>But he must see what the perishin' thing was. Even if he ran a risk, he
  must know. He turned down the nozzle of his torch so that the pencil of light
  showed only on the ground, and then he saw something that brought his heart
  into his mouth.</p>

  <p>There, within two inches of his leg, was an enormous bulldog showing a
  magnificent set of teeth in a ferocious grin.</p>

  <p>"Erump, tump, tump," quoth the bulldog, in the rich, fruity baritone of
  his clan. "Erump, burp, parp."</p>

  <p>With one wild yell Maggs flung himself over the wall and raced down the
  heathery slope in search of safety. All he wanted in that hectic moment was
  to place as much air and space as possible between himself and the animal,
  which he sub-consciously recognised as the 'faithful hound' alluded to in the
  fragmentary conversation he had heard in the library a few minutes ago.</p>

  <p>In his headlong panic he raced across the cliffs without realising that he
  had crossed the path and plugged down the precipitous slope at the foot of
  which lay the sea. And, in so doing, he alighted on a wide bed of loose shale
  such as he had noticed when spying out the lie of the land. His feet slid
  from under him and, sprawling on the flat of his back, he set the shale in
  motion, and down he went as if he were slithering to perdition on the face of
  an avalanche. In vain he turned and twisted and clutched in an endeavor to
  obtain some sort of a grip, but the more he struggled the faster the loose
  erosion rumbled downwards towards the waves breaking on the rocks at the foot
  of the cliff. The crash and grind of the sea sounded in his ears like the
  crack of doom. In vain to cry out, in vain to scream for help with the fog
  blanketing his voice and black darkness before his eyes. A few seconds and
  there was an end of John Maggs!</p>

  <p>Somewhere overhead the bulldog was wailing like a lost soul. But not so
  loudly as Maggs some 200 feet below.</p>

  <p>Those few seconds of long-drawn out agony seemed like years to the unhappy
  marauder. Down, down he went with a crash and rumble of sliding shale until,
  in a state of mental paralysis, he shot clean over square bluff into space
  and, for a few moments, remembered no more. Then the crushing impact.</p>

  <p>But not the crash he dreaded. Some hard substance struck him in the small
  of the back and knocked all the wind out of him. Something that seemed to
  sway and toss and yet hold him in a close grip. Not so far from the water
  either, because Maggs could hear the swish and suck of the tide unpleasantly
  close. Then, as his scattered senses began to reassemble, he recognised dimly
  the thing that had happened.</p>

  <p>His fall had been broken and his body supported by the latteral branch of
  some trees perched on the cliff side. It was a wide, flat branch that smelt
  like fir of some kind. If he could only reach the bottom of it! But at the
  slightest movement the branch swayed ominously and the paralysing fear came
  back again. Another slip and the adventure would be definitely finished.</p>

  <p>It was so dark, too, and the fog as thick as ever. Maggs could hear it
  dripping around him like the flopping of so many frogs. Not a breath of wind
  moving, silence everywhere.</p>

  <p>It was 'ard, crool 'ard, Maggs told himself, with tears of self-pity in
  his eyes; but better, perhaps, than being a mangled corpse on the rocks
  below. All the same, he was just as much a prisoner now as if he had been
  chained by the leg or behind stone walls. Here he was with his pockets
  bulging with gold and that blinkin' motor cycle, and safety, only half a mile
  away.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he might get away with it yet. If only he could see something of
  the lie of the land! But in his headlong flight from that perishin' dog he
  had dropped his torch. There was nothing for it but to wait till daylight and
  then see if it were possible to scramble up the cliff and make a dash for the
  cycle before the world began to wake to another morn. A slim chance, but not
  impossible. And hours of this yet.</p>

  <p>Gradually Maggs dozed off. He had sunk deeper into his cradled bower, and
  no longer feared a fall. The doze faded into a dream and the dream into a
  sound sleep&mdash;</p>

  <p>When Maggs finally awoke it was morning, early morning with a smudge of
  smoky light overhead and a lifting of the atmosphere, but no breath of wind
  yet and no fading of the blanket of fog. So thick was it still that Maggs
  could not see two yards beyond his nose. He could hear the ominous growl of
  the sea below and the cry of the gulls&mdash;beyond that, nothing.</p>

  <p>If only that perishin' fog would lift!</p>

  <p>Came at length sounds of life behind the thick curtain of blinding mist.
  Voices! A faint puff of wind. Another. Overhead a pallid sphere like a new
  cheese. The sun at last! Then the fog rolled back fold upon fold as a moving
  curtain might do and the palpitating Maggs could see at last.</p>

  <p>"Luv a duck," he blubbered, "luv a duck. If I'd only knowed. Crool luck.
  An' me orl the time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was lying on the lateral branch of a weather-scarred and stunted
  cedar-tree barely fifteen feet in height and overhanging the lower path,
  which was not far above high water mark.</p>

  <p>Absolute safety in his grasp. Almost. But not quite.</p>

  <p>For on the path, looking up at him and showing that splendid range of
  teeth, was the cause of all the mischief.</p>

  <p>"Erump, tump, tump," said the bulldog. "Wrupp."</p>

  <p>Along the path came a large man in thigh gaiters and rough shooting
  jacket&mdash;evidently a gamekeeping sort of person. He looked at the dog and
  followed the direction of his upturned, blunt nose. And saw Maggs on his
  perch.</p>

  <p>"Seemin'ly," he said, "Seemin'ly you be the bloke what we 'uns be lookin'
  for. Come down."</p>

  <p>"That's torn it," Maggs almost wept.</p><br>
