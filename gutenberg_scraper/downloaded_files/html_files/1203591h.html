  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Dick Staines left the University of Cambridge, he was
  confronted with several alternatives, all more or less unalluring. On the
  strength of his honours degree in science he might have taken a mastership at
  a preparatory school; alternatively, he could have gone into a great motor
  works for three years at a salary of thirty shillings a week, with no sure
  prospect at the end of his apprenticeship; or he could have been appointed to
  a commission in His Majesty's Army, where he would have received sufficient
  pay and allowances to discharge his monthly mess bill; or he might, had he
  influence, have entered that branch of the Civil Service whence one starts
  forth on a diplomatic career.</p>

  <p>He had no influence, he had no money, except the rags of a thousand pound
  legacy which had taken him through Cambridge.</p>

  <p>He returned one night to the furnished room in Gower Street which he had
  taken on his arrival in London, and set out before him the four definite
  offers he had received. He had discovered that even a mastership at a
  preparatory school was not a post easy to secure. The final offer of a
  motor-car company he tore up and threw into the fire. From his pocket he took
  a printed blank and this he filled up with some care and posted. Three days
  later he was invited to make a call at Scotland Yard, and within six months
  Mr. Richard Staines, Bachelor of Arts (Camb.), was patrolling the Finchley
  Road in the uniform of the Metropolitan Constabulary.</p>

  <p>Many things contributed to his rapid promotion. A bit of luck, as he
  confessed, the left hook to the jaw which sent Peter Lanbradi sprawling to
  the floor just as his finger was pressing the trigger of a pistol malignantly
  directed towards an Under-Secretary of State, his skill as a runner, and,
  last and most important, his command of Continental languages. He spoke four
  perfectly, two well, and three others well enough. Four years after he had
  joined the force, he was a sergeant in the. C.I.D., earmarked for further
  promotion.</p>

  <p>That promotion came. He was Detective-Inspector Staines when he went to
  Brighton with Lord Weald, whom he and most people addressed familiarly as
  'Tommy.' They had been together at Cambridge, were members of the same
  college, had been arrested together in the same rag.</p>

  <p>"It's the queerest thing in the world, old thing," bleated Tommy, as he
  sent his swift Rolls dodging between two farm carts. "Only yesterday it seems
  you and I were being dragged down Petty Cury by a Robert&mdash;and now
  <i>you're</i> a Robert!"</p>

  <p>He chuckled joyously at the thought.</p>

  <p>He was a round-faced man who looked much younger than his years, and
  though he was by no means a pigmy he was half a foot shorter than the
  bareheaded, brown-faced man who sat by his side. Good looks were an asset to
  Dick Staines, though he found no profit in them. He had the build and eager
  face of an athlete; the grey, smiling eyes of one who found life rather
  amusing. Tommy and he had not seen each other for years. Lord Weald had just
  returned from a trip in South Africa, and they had met accidentally in
  town&mdash;somewhat inconveniently for Dick Staines, who was going to
  Scotland for a fortnight's fishing, the guest of a plutocratic Assistant
  Commissioner. Since his finances were by no means assured, he had let his
  pretty little Chelsea flat for a month&mdash;an arrangement which looked like
  being very inconvenient, as he explained to his companion.</p>

  <p>"Why I'm sky-hooting down to Brighton for two days, heaven knows!"</p>

  <p>"You're sky-hooting to Brighton, old boy," said Tommy, "because it would
  have been deuced uncivil if you hadn't accepted an old pal's urgent
  invitation. You told me yourself that your Commissioner, or whatever he calls
  himself, will not be in Scotland till the end of the week. Besides, I've got
  a lot to tell you. I've had tremendous adventures&mdash;lion-chasing,
  everything!"</p>

  <p>"Who did the chasing&mdash;you or the lion?"</p>

  <p>"We took it in turns," said Tommy calmly. "Sometimes I was in front and
  sometimes they were. And besides, Brighton's good for the liver and there's
  somebody in Brighton, the prettiest thing you ever met. Never seen anything
  like her, old boy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A lioness?"</p>

  <p>Lord Weald turned pained eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>"She's a nurse, old boy. I've never had the cheek to find out who she is,
  but you're a detective and all that sort of thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you imagine," said Dick Staines sternly, "that I'm coming to Brighton
  to further your low amours, you've got another guess coming, Tommy."</p>

  <p>By the time Tommy Weald had recovered from his indignation and incoherence
  they had reached the hotel. They were going up the steps of the broad
  entrance, when a man came out&mdash;a man with a large, red face, and a
  short, bristling, black moustache. He stared at 'Tommy, and waved a cheery
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Dashed amusin' feller," said Tommy. "Know him?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Walter Derrick," explained his lordship. "Lives next door to me in
  Lowndes Square. Big house, pots of money, but dashed amusin'. My poor, dear
  old governor used to say that his father was the most dashed unpleasant man
  he'd ever met, but this feller is&mdash;is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dashed amusin'?" suggested Dick.</p>

  <p>Going up in the elevator, Tommy, whose mind could never hold two ideas at
  once, expatiated upon the dashed amusingness of his neighbour. So far as Dick
  Staines could gather, Mr. Derrick's chief claim to the title of good fellow
  was that he laughed at all Tommy's jokes.</p>

  <p>Dick knew the gentleman very well by name; indeed, he had recognised his
  big yellow Rolls standing outside the hotel. The only thing he had heard in
  his disfavour was that on one occasion, when a poor cousin, his sole
  relative, had called at the house to secure his help in a time of domestic
  trouble, Mr. Derrick had sent for the police and had the importunate relative
  removed. Which was curiously unlike the big, genial soul. His father had been
  the most notorious miser in London. He had carried his meanness to such
  lengths that, according to legend, he had quarrelled with Walter Derrick over
  the purchase of a bicycle, and for years the pair had been estranged, Derrick
  working abroad as a common labourer.</p>

  <p>Nothing of those seven or eight years' exile had soured the man. From the
  shy, furtive lad that very few people had seen, and nobody had known
  intimately, he returned a year before the old man died, one who saw all the
  humour there was in life.</p>

  <p>"He's dashed glad to be alive&mdash;he told me so," said Tommy.</p>

  <p>This little extra holiday was a pleasant break to Dick Staines. After
  dinner, the evening being warm and the light still holding, the two men
  strolled along the front, and Tommy, who had hardly stopped speaking since he
  reached England, related with great force and vigour, and with a wealth of
  illustrative gesture, the adventures (tame enough they sounded, even
  embellished as they were) that had come his way.</p>

  <p>They had reached a less populated part of the parade when Dick felt his
  arm clutched.</p>

  <p>"There she is!"</p>

  <p>Dick Staines turned his head. A girl in severe nurse's costume was walking
  slowly towards them. Until they were nearly abreast he could not see her
  face.</p>

  <p>There is a beauty which instantly appeals; more critical examination
  brings disappointment. There is another type which impresses more slowly and
  more lastingly, and a third, and the rarest of all, an instant discovery of
  loveliness which brings with it the illusion of familiarity.</p>

  <p>Seeing her for the first time, Dick Staines was certain that a long
  acquaintance must have built up his knowledge and appreciation of her beauty.
  In less than a second he had seen and she had passed.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think, old boy?" Tommy was anxiously awaiting his
  verdict.</p>

  <p>"She's very pretty," said the cautious Dick Staines, and felt a brute at
  his churlish lack of enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"She's a nurse, old boy," said Tommy unnecessarily. "Pushes a dithering
  old Johnny all over the place in a perambulator&mdash;well, she doesn't
  exactly push him, but she's on the spot. Ain't she a stunner?"</p>

  <p>"She's certainly a stunner," admitted Dick. "What is her name?"</p>

  <p>"Mary Dane. You wouldn't guess that I'd find that out," said Tommy
  triumphantly, "but I have! Mary Dane&mdash;sounds like something off the
  screen, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"How do you know her name is Mary Dane?"</p>

  <p>"Because I asked at the boarding-house," said the shameless Tommy. "That's
  an idea that wouldn't have occurred to you&mdash;some of us fellers have got
  more initiative than Roberts. And I'll tell you something else: the old
  gentleman she pulls about is a man named Cornfort. They dodge up and down the
  coast, looking for the right kind of air. I spoke to her once&mdash;said
  'Good-morning.'"</p>

  <p>"What did she say?" asked Dick, amused at this sudden romance.</p>

  <p>"She said Good-morning,' too," said Tommy. "But she so took me aback
  answering me at all that I couldn't think of anything more to say! She's a
  lady, old boy&mdash;got a voice like custard&mdash;you know, kind of soft and
  creamy ..." He floundered, seeking an illustration.</p>

  <p>They walked back, hoping to see her again, but were disappointed. That
  night, as they sat in the smoke room, discussing a final whisky and soda, Mr.
  Walter Derrick strolled in. He was in evening dress, a fine, happy-looking
  figure of a man. He glanced round the room, and presently his eyes rested on
  Lord Weald, and he walked slowly across to where they were sitting.</p>

  <p>"Hallo, Weald! Siamese twins, you and I, eh? They lived next door in
  London, and in Brighton they were not divided!" He chuckled at this as he sat
  down.</p>

  <p>He smiled at Dick, his eyes gleaming good-humouredly behind his
  horn-rimmed glasses.</p>

  <p>"And what terrible crime brings you to Brighton, Mr. Inspector?" he said,
  to Dick's surprise. "Oh yes, I know you. Saw you giving evidence in
  court&mdash;criminal cases are a hobby of mine. I've got the best library in
  London."</p>

  <p>"Dick's a friend of mine," Tommy hastened to explain his guest's position.
  "We were at 'Varsity together; then he became a Robert, and there you
  are!"</p>

  <p>Evidently Mr. Derrick had no great interest in Dick's social position.</p>

  <p>"It's queer I should have met you. I was only talking with somebody the
  other night and your name cropped up. We were discussing the Slough shooting
  case. You remember, the cashier of some company&mdash;I don't remember what
  it was&mdash;was shot dead and the pay-roll taken. I was in Africa at the
  time, and my impression was that they'd caught the man, but my friend tells
  me that he was never captured. That's probably before you went into the
  Force."</p>

  <p>"On the very day I entered the Force," said Dick quietly. "No, he was
  never captured. We have, of course, a clue&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Derrick nodded.</p>

  <p>"A finger-print found on the barrel of the automatic. Yes, I know that
  part of it. The only thing I didn't know was whether this fellow was ever
  caught. If you're living about a thousand miles from everywhere, and your
  weekly newspapers have a trick of going astray&mdash;I lost six mails
  through flooded rivers&mdash;you miss the end of these stories."</p>

  <p>"The end is not written yet," smiled Dick.</p>

  <p>Mr. Derrick pursed his lips thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Then I've lost," he said. "I could have sworn that the man was arrested
  and tried. I must have confused him with somebody else."</p>

  <p>He was one of the loquacious kind that gives little opportunity for
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"I had a sort of personal interest in the matter&mdash;my father, who had,
  I am sorry to confess, very few endearing qualities, made a collection of
  fingerprints. The poor old chap all his life was very keen on proving that
  everybody else was wrong but he!" He made a little grimace. "I suffered from
  that little hobby, but I'm not complaining. And he was perfectly convinced
  that the police theory that a man's finger-prints have no exact duplicate in
  the world was wrong, and he made an extraordinary collection&mdash;used to
  give prizes, though the Lord knows he hated spending money&mdash;to schools
  and factories for finger-print collections."</p>

  <p>"He must have been disappointed," smiled Dick. The big man shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I'm not so sure that there wasn't something in his theory.
  After all, how many finger-prints have you got at Scotland Yard? Suppose
  you've got a quarter of a million: that represents one-one hundred and
  sixtieth of the population. The only people you examine are members of the
  criminal classes, and it is the same in France and America and wherever the
  finger-print system is in force. It doesn't prove, because there are no two
  criminals alike, that there are no two honest men alike!"</p>

  <p>"Are you continuing the good work?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>Mr. Derrick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Rather not," he said. "The first thing I did after my father's death was
  to go around and, collecting these beastly things, put them in the fire."</p>

  <p>Then abruptly he turned to Tommy, asked him how he had enjoyed his
  shooting trip, whom he had met, where he had been. Evidently part of the
  country that Tommy had crossed was familiar to Mr. Derrick. His exile had
  been spent a few miles south of the southern arm of Tanganyika.</p>

  <p>"Early to bed and early to rise," he yawned as he rose. "That is what
  makes millionaires!" He laughed at the joke, turned to go, and came back
  solemnly to tap Dick's shoulder. "A better way is to have a frugal father who
  makes it for you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Cheerful bird," said Tommy when the jovial man had gone, "and such a
  sense of humour! The other day I told him a yarn about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to bed," said Dick. "If it is the story about what you said to
  the railway guard on the Beira railway, I don't think I could stand it
  again."</p>

  <p>He was up early the next morning, and had a bit of luck. He saw the nurse
  in some difficulties with her bath chair. They were pulling it up a steep
  incline, and Dick brought his weight to the back of the vehicle. This little
  exertion resulted in a loss&mdash;Tommy had given him a gold pencil with a
  large, red-lacquer top. After the bath chair had gone he missed this and went
  down the slope to the beach. But his search was vain. He may have dropped it
  from his waistcoat pocket as he was bending over the chair.</p>

  <p>When he saw the nurse again it was in such dramatic circumstances that he
  forgot to ask.</p>

  <p>It was ten minutes to one; he was sitting on a rail watching the ceaseless
  weaving of cars, when he saw something in the middle of the road that brought
  his heart to his mouth ...</p>

  <p>If Mr. Derrick's big Rolls had collided with the yellow bath chair this
  story would not have been written. He came flying round along the parade at a
  speed beyond legal limits, saw the bath chair, the nurse, and the bowed
  chairman only just in time to apply his brakes, and the car skidded awkwardly
  to the left, until its wheels bumped against the kerb, bounded back again,
  and half turned in its own length.</p>

  <p>In an instant Dick was in the roadway, tugging the chair to safety.</p>

  <p>"My friend," said Dick solemnly, "you have had a very lucky
  escape&mdash;by rights you ought to be in heaven!"</p>

  <p>He addressed the nurse.</p>

  <p>She really was beautiful, and owed nothing to her picturesque
  attire&mdash;if a woman cannot look pretty in a nurse's uniform she is plain
  beyond rescue.</p>

  <p>She looked at him quickly, recognised the man who had earlier in the
  morning helped push the bath chair, and smiled. The grizzled chairman stood
  apathetically by; the invalid dozed in his voluminous wrappings,
  unconcerned.</p>

  <p>"It was funny, wasn't it?" she said.</p>

  <p>She had the voice of a lady, soft, yet distinct; for the moment it was
  rich with the quality of laughter.</p>

  <p>"It didn't amuse me terribly," he said truthfully. "I congratulate you on
  your sense of humour. The only satisfaction you could have got out of the
  tragedy would have been the knowledge that you had been killed&mdash;and of
  course you wouldn't have known that&mdash;by a very rich and jovial man."</p>

  <p>The nurse looked across the road. Mr. Derrick was talking to a policeman.
  The policeman looked rather stern, and had a notebook in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Derrick, isn't it? He is staying at the Metropole&mdash;I've often
  seen his car. He was travelling at an awful rate."</p>

  <p>"And awfully is he being rated by that guardian of the law," said
  Dick.</p>

  <p>She laughed at this.</p>

  <p>The apathetic bath chairman did not move; the invalid still slumbered.</p>

  <p>"You are at the Metropole, too," she nodded. "The merest guest of a
  guest," said Dick. "My purse does not run to Metropoles."</p>

  <p>He felt greatly complimented. This was no fly-by-night young lady to whom
  the formalities of an introduction were unnecessary. She offered as much as
  she demanded. He knew that if he asked her to dine with him that night she
  would be shockingly surprised. She knew (he was aware of this) that he was
  incapable of any such invitation. It was just one of those curious
  understandings which occur between two people who have a similar code of
  behaviour.</p>

  <p>"Then you're seeing life," she smiled, and signalled the chairman.</p>

  <p>Dick watched the little party regretfully as they moved along the
  front.</p>

  <p>She was lovely; those eyes of hers, as clear and grey as a spring sky,
  haunted him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HE carried the memory back that night to London. Tommy was
  going on a tour of the South Coast to visit his innumerable relations. He
  looked forward, he confessed dismally, to a perfectly ghastly three weeks.
  One provision he made for the comfort of his friend.</p>

  <p>"I've arranged for you to stay at Lowndes Square to-night. My man's in
  full possession, and I've phoned him to make you up a bed and call you in
  time for the early morning train. If you want to use one of the cars, old
  boy, regard it as your own."</p>

  <p>Dick would much rather have gone to an hotel, and said so, but Tommy had
  been so pathetically efficient, and had gone to so much trouble (he confessed
  that he loathed the telephone) that he had not the heart to refuse.</p>

  <p>Dick was met at the station by a troubled butler, who had a respectful
  tale of woe. He was the only servant in the house; he had misguidedly sent
  the cook off that morning on her holiday, the housemaids had left a day or
  two earlier, and he himself was in some distress. That afternoon there had
  been an interesting event in his family at a Notting Hill maternity home.
  Dick was mildly interested; he did not know that butlers had children. The
  butler confessed that it was the first time it had occurred, and he was
  naturally agitated. He added, fervently, that it would be the last time. The
  main point was this: would Dick mind sleeping in the house alone that night?
  The butler could come very early, call him, prepare his bath, and get his
  breakfast.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, my dear fellow. I could even do that myself, or I could
  breakfast at the station," said Dick, who wished more than ever that he had
  decided upon the station hotel.</p>

  <p>There was a cold supper waiting for him, and afterwards the butler, not
  without evidence of his impatience to be gone, led him up to the third floor,
  and a beautiful guest room that ran the width of the house. There were three
  French windows leading out to a stone balcony. Two of them were closed with
  iron shutters of a type commonly seen covering the windows of suburban shops.
  They rolled up and they rolled down, explained the butler. He had locked two,
  but the third he had left open in case Mr. Staines needed air; and now he
  wished he had opened one of the others and had closed this particular one,
  because the retaining cord was broken, and the shutter must remain open all
  night. He showed Dick where he had wedged the shutter to keep it from
  falling.</p>

  <p>"It will be all right so long as you don't touch it, sir," were his last
  words before he backed out of the room.</p>

  <p>A pleasant room, with its snug four-poster bed and its old Georgian
  furniture; great armchairs, chintz-covered; a score of rare etchings on the
  beflowered walls; it was old-fashioned and restful&mdash;Dick felt that he
  could spend quite a long time as Tommy's guest if he could have the use of
  this third-floor room.</p>

  <p>On the table the butler had left a tiny key.</p>

  <p>"In case you want to go out for a stroll, sir," he explained.</p>

  <p>Long after he had gone, when Dick had changed into his pyjamas and had put
  on a thin dressing-gown, he slipped the key into his pocket mechanically.</p>

  <p>It was a hot and breathless night. Even his thin pyjamas clung to his
  body; he could have well dispensed with the dressing-gown, and did so later,
  when he strolled on to the balcony and, sitting down in a deep chair, lit a
  cigarette and surveyed the twinkling lights of the square and the long street
  which stretched to infinity. It was breathless and hot and stifling. He had
  serious thoughts of bringing his bed on to the balcony and sleeping there.
  And then, to the south, he saw a jagged ribbon of light run across the sky,
  and there was a reverberating crash of thunder.</p>

  <p>"This is where we go to bed," said Dick; rose and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>He was hardly on his feet when there was a second crash, nearer at hand.
  The lights of the room were suddenly blotted out; the heavy shutters had been
  wedged, but not wedged well enough. Whether it was the reverberation of the
  thunder, or some other natural cause, the little triangle of wood had slipped
  from its place and the shutter had fallen.</p>

  <p>For a moment Dick was startled, and then he laughed. It would be a simple
  matter to lift the shutter high enough to get under it. He stooped, felt
  along the bottom for some staple for his hand to grip. He seemed to remember
  having seen something of the sort on shop shutters, but there was nothing
  here. The lower edge of the rolled shutter fitted flush with the stone sill.
  Using all his strength, he pressed on the ribbed front and tried to pry it
  up, but it was immovable. And then a great spot of rain fell upon him, and
  another. He slipped into his dressing-gown and searched the street. There was
  nobody in sight. A few minutes before pedestrians had been plentiful; he had
  seen a policeman pass; but now nobody was in sight. The saunterers had
  hurried to places of shelter against the coming storm. He saw a big car come
  up to the corner of the block and stop, but it was too far away.</p>

  <p>He tried the shutter again, but with no better success. Adventure was the
  breath of his nostrils, but an adventure which took the shape of an all-night
  vigil on an inaccessible balcony, perched high above a West End street and
  exposed to the full blast of a storm, was not the kind that appealed to
  him.</p>

  <p>And then, a few feet away, he saw the edge of another balcony, and craning
  over espied a French window&mdash;unshuttered. Who lived next door? he
  wondered, and then remembered suddenly. This was Walter Derrick's house, that
  genial man. And it was empty.</p>

  <p>At the moment of the discovery his hand was in his dressing-gown pocket
  and he had touched the key. It would be a simple matter to reach the other
  balcony, make his way into the house&mdash;he might even be compelled to
  break a window, but he could explain, apologise, and pay for the damage. He
  was a police officer and above suspicion.</p>

  <p>He threw one pyjamaed leg over the edge of the balcony and looked down.
  Ordinarily, he was not a nervous man, but beneath the ground seemed miles
  away, and in the flickering blaze of lightning he saw row upon row of cruel,
  upturned spikes, and a very hard-looking area into which he would most
  certainly fall.</p>

  <p>The rain was pelting down now. A high wind howled and shrieked
  demoniacally through the square. He could hear the rustle and creak of the
  trees in the centre gardens, saw their giant branches tossed hither and
  thither by the force of the gale, and found it necessary that he should hold
  tight to the parapet to prevent his being blown to eternity.</p>

  <p>He gripped the stonework with a firm hand, reached out one foot gingerly
  and felt the next balcony. After what seemed hours of testing, he leapt,
  grasped the parapet, and drew himself to safety. There were three windows,
  and none was shuttered. Behind each heavy white shades were drawn. There was
  no time for finesse: even if he had the necessary instruments, he would not
  have stopped to cut his way through the glass. Putting his shoulder to the
  window, he pressed. The glass doors gave creakingly, and then, with a sharp
  snap, opened. He drew aside the blind and, stepping into the room, felt along
  the wall until he found a switch, and turned it on. It was not a bedroom, but
  rather had the appearance of an office.</p>

  <p>There was a little desk, two large bookcases, and a sofa. In the fireplace
  was a cheap-looking electric stove. There were one or two old pictures
  hanging on the walls, and near to the desk a large calendar. The presence of
  a typewriter on the desk suggested to him that this was probably the office
  of Mr. Derrick's secretary.</p>

  <p>He tried the door; it opened readily. Having extinguished the light in the
  room, he stepped out on to a thickly carpeted landing. He could find his way
  with little help, for the lightning was almost incessant; and the pealing of
  thunder so continuous that the house seemed to be shaking from room to
  basement.</p>

  <p>The stairs were very broad. He remembered now that this was a corner
  house, much larger than Tommy's. The butler had pointed it out to him as they
  had drawn up to the door.</p>

  <p>He came to the second landing, and now he could walk with less caution.
  The landing windows were larger; those on the second and first floors were of
  stained glass. He saw the beauty of a design that came to him in a flash of
  lightning, and he saw, too, the pale ghost of a marble statuette gleam
  whitely into view and vanish.</p>

  <p>His plan was a simple one: it was to go out by the front door and into
  Tommy's front door, and put in as much sleep as the storm would allow
  him.</p>

  <p>The hall was in darkness. Only the reflection of the lightning, came here,
  and he had to walk with circumspection. It was a vast hall with a tiled
  floor, and there were big cabinets, he guessed, on either side. Happily,
  there was a fanlight which gave him direction.</p>

  <p>He turned the handle, but the door did not move. He tried again, felt for
  the restraining catch, but unsuccessfully. He grinned in the darkness, and
  wondered what Tommy would say and what the jovial Mr. Derrick would say, and
  what solution Mary Dane, with her glorious eyes and her sane, friendly
  understanding, would offer to his predicament. It was curious he should think
  of Mary at that moment. There was nothing in his surroundings to suggest the
  serenity and fragrance of her. But he realised, with a sense of guilt, that
  her image had occupied his mind ever since he had left Brighton, that when he
  had leaned out of the window of the railway carriage ostensibly to wave
  farewell to Tommy, it was her face he hoped to see. He believed in
  miracles.</p>

  <p>He felt round for the switch control, and, after a great deal of trouble,
  found it. A pale, yellow light shone in an antique lantern suspended from the
  high roof of the hall. He made an examination of the lock, and was quick to
  understand what had baffled him. The door had been double-locked, and without
  a key it was impossible to open it.</p>

  <p>Dick Staines scratched his chin. He was wet through, his dressing-gown was
  a sodden rag that dripped an irregular circle of water about him.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it; he must try the basement kitchen. There would
  certainly be a tradesman's door. Leaving the light burning to facilitate his
  passage, he explored the back part of the house and began slowly to descend a
  narrower flight of stairs. There was a scent of ancient cooking to guide him,
  and, to his surprise, when he reached the foot of the stairs he saw a light
  burning in a wall bracket. It was dim and yellow and dusty, and had the
  appearance of having been forgotten by a careless servant. From the stone
  hall in which he stood two doors opened; that before him, he guessed, was
  most likely to lead to the tradesmen's entrance. He turned the handle and
  stepped in. Two strides he made, and stood stock still.</p>

  <p>A light was burning here, too. It was evidently the kitchen, for the table
  had been pulled aside, and, lying full length on the ground, was a man bound
  hand and foot, his eyes tightly bandaged.</p>

  <p>That alone would have startled him; but, bending over the man and
  searching his pockets with feverish haste, was a girl in a dark blue evening
  dress. On a nearby chair a richly lined cloak had been thrown, and as her
  hands went in and out of the man's pockets he saw the flash and sparkle of
  diamond rings.</p>

  <p>She had not heard him enter. He took a step ... and she looked up.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" gasped Dick Staines.</p>

  <p>For the beautiful woman, whose hand went straight out to the automatic
  pistol that lay by her side, raised a face to his that was a vision of
  loveliness&mdash;and it was the loveliness of Mary Dane!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR a moment their eyes met. In hers was no sign of
  recognition, only a look of horror and fear.</p>

  <p>"You are Mary Dane!"</p>

  <p>Dick's voice was harsh and strained. He hardly recognised it.</p>

  <p>Still she did not move. Her hand was closed about the grip of the
  automatic. He took one step towards her, and at that moment all the lights
  went out; an arm was flung round his neck and he was jerked backwards.
  Somebody had come noiselessly into the kitchen behind him. Taken by surprise,
  he could offer no resistance. He lost his balance, cannoned against the man
  who held him, and fell sprawling outside the door. It closed with a crash; he
  heard a bolt shot, a whisper of voices, and, as he came to his feet and
  hammered on the panel, the thud of another door closing.</p>

  <p>He looked round. Standing a little way along the passage was an old spade.
  With this as a lever, he attacked the door, and eventually forced the shaky
  bolt. As he expected, the room was empty, save for the motionless figure on
  the floor.</p>

  <p>A wild wind filled the kitchen. The outer door, which had been slammed,
  had come open again, and, running out, he peered into a flooded area.</p>

  <p>His first duty was to the bound man. In one of the drawers of the kitchen
  dresser he found an old carving knife, and with this he cut the ropes that
  fastened the prisoner.</p>

  <p>It was some time before the man could give a coherent account of what had
  happened. He was caretaker, and lived in the back basement room. Every night
  he went out for a ten minutes' stroll, keeping within sight of the house. He
  had seen nobody enter, and had returned to have his supper before going to
  bed. The remains of the supper were still on the table: a half-filled glass
  of beer, cold meat and pickles, and a cut loaf of bread. He remembered
  drinking the beer ...</p>

  <p>"Was it poured out before you left?"</p>

  <p>The man thought, his aching head in his hands. He wasn't sure. But he knew
  the bottle was opened. Now he came to gather his scattered wits he recalled
  the fact that he hadn't remembered opening the bottle before he left the
  house.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said Dick quickly; "you've been doped. Have you lost
  anything? They were searching your pockets when I came in."</p>

  <p>The man put his hand into his hip pocket, and took out a flat, leather
  case containing keys.</p>

  <p>"No, they didn't take anything ... It was the man who tied me up."</p>

  <p>"The man? Was there a man?"</p>

  <p>The caretaker distinctly remembered the man. He had come to consciousness
  whilst he was being bound. A thin-faced, wild-looking man, with very short,
  fair hair.</p>

  <p>He became suddenly aware of the déshabille of this providential
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"I came in from next door&mdash;Lord Weald's house," said the detective,
  interpreting the curious glance the other gave him.</p>

  <p>He had a hasty look round the other rooms, and came back to the caretaker,
  who had sufficiently recovered to be searching for the glass of beer.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch that," said Dick sharply. "Just leave it till the police
  arrive. You're connected by telephone&mdash;get on to the nearest police
  station and ask them to send an officer round."</p>

  <p>He walked out into the area; the rain was pelting down, but he was so wet
  that a little added discomfort meant little or nothing. He found the key in
  his pocket, admitted himself to Weald's house, and ten minutes later he was
  in a hot bath. He dressed himself, put on his heaviest boots and a
  mackintosh, and went out again into the street. As he did so he saw a
  motor-cycle and side-car pull up before Derrick's door, and two men,
  obviously divisional detectives, jump out. They had not seen him, and he
  waited till they disappeared into the area.</p>

  <p>He was still a little stunned by his discovery; but his duty was
  obvious&mdash;to place in the hands of the local police all the information
  he possessed. What was that information? That a girl whom he had only seen
  three times, and to whom he had only spoken once, had, with some other
  person, engaged in a burglary, and that girl was Mary Dane. He made a little
  grimace at the thought. It was incredible; but police work was made up of
  incredible happenings. He could stake his life that he was not mistaken ... he
  could make that stake with equal vehemence that this girl with the clear,
  grey eyes was incapable of a criminal act.</p>

  <p>The storm was less violent; with the exception of an occasional crash
  overhead, the rumble of thunder was dying away in the distance, but it still
  rained. He did not remember ever having seen such rain.</p>

  <p>And then, wilfully ignoring the claims of duty, he went inside and closed
  the door. If the police wanted him they would know where to find him, he told
  himself. It was not part of his duty to interfere with local detectives, and
  very likely the divisional inspector would resent his appearance in the
  case.</p>

  <p>All that he could say was that he had seen a girl, handsomely dressed,
  bejewelled, that she was very pretty ... Inevitably the question would be
  asked:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you didn't recognise her, Inspector?" Naturally he was
  acquainted with crooks, male and female. How should he answer?</p>

  <p>He carefully considered this, and decided upon a formula. He would
  say:</p>

  <p>"I did not recognise her as any person known to the police."</p>

  <p>With this crude sophistry he contented himself.</p>

  <p>For some extraordinary reason he was feeling hungry. He made a search for
  the kitchen, opened a door, and went down some stairs and found himself not
  in a kitchen, but a garage. He stood staring at a fast little Italian car
  nearest the garage door. He tapped the tank: it sounded full. He looked at
  the indicator on the dashboard, and saw that the machine was ready for a
  journey. It was, indeed, intended and prepared for a surreptitious run in the
  country by Lord Weald's second chauffeur, but Dick did not know this.</p>

  <p>There was an extraordinary arrangement over the car; a pulley handle,
  rather like one of those contrivances he had seen in American fire engine
  stations. You could sit in the machine, pull the handle, and the garage doors
  would open, he guessed. He got into the driver's seat, reached up, and
  pulled&mdash;the big doors of the garage folded back noiselessly.</p>

  <p>It was raining heavily outside. He put on the headlamps to confirm this
  belief, though there was no need. Anyway, Tommy had said, "Use one of my
  cars," and he did not feel very tired. He stood up, drew the hood over the
  windscreen and fastened it. Very deliberately, he started up the car and
  drove out into the dark mews.</p>

  <p>He felt a heavy iron bar across the mouth of the garage sag under him. He
  was hardly clear before the big doors folded noiselessly back and the garage
  was closed to him. One of Tommy's contrivances: he delighted in effects
  produced by the pressure of buttons or the turn of handles ... Here was the
  fact, staring starkly at Inspector Richard Staines, that he was in a very
  dark mews in a small, but high-powered car, the garage was closed behind him,
  the front door of the house was closed before him, and the only key was in
  his sodden dressing-gown pocket in the bathroom.</p>

  <p>It wasn't exactly the night for a joy ride, but he seized eagerly upon the
  excuse. He must go down and tell Tommy all about this remarkable
  adventure ... He could not deceive himself: he was going down to make sure that
  Mary Dane was at Brighton; he had intended that step from the very first, and
  the only thing he had not considered was the possibility of using one of
  Tommy's cars. Moreover, he was running away from inquiry. By now the
  detectives would be knocking on Tommy Weald's front door and waiting on the
  doorstep to interview him, and all the time they were waiting he was putting
  more and more distance between himself and the scene of the burglary.</p>

  <p>"You're not only a sentimental jackass, but you're a bad police officer,"
  said Dick Staines aloud as the car glided over Vauxhall Bridge.</p>

  <p>"I am doing my duty," said Richard Staines virtuously, "and my duty is to
  confirm or dispel my suspicions,"</p>

  <p>He knew, better than any man, that his suspicions required not so much
  confirmation as expression.</p>

  <p>All of the storm which had not come to London he met outside Dorking. The
  car sped along winding roads between high hills, and the lightning flickered
  and crackled overhead, and the thunder drowned the sound of his engine. With
  his screen-wiper swinging madly, his mackintosh black with driving rain, Dick
  Staines came to Brighton. The hour was 1.15.</p>

  <p>There was a big fancy-dress dance at the Metropole. Long lines of
  motor-cars stood bonnet to tank along the front as far as he could see. A
  porter told him his lordship was in the ballroom, and thither Dick made his
  way, shedding his sodden coat <i>en route</i>. There were cavaliers and the
  inevitable pierrots and pierrettes, marvellous circus ladies, and circus
  ladies who were not so marvellous, sitting out in the lounge. As he came to
  the entrance of the room he saw a girl walking towards him across the floor,
  which at that moment was clear of dancers. She wore a nurse's uniform, and
  her face was masked. But the walk was already familiar to him, and his heart
  thumped painfully. Then, to his astonishment, she lifted her hand in greeting
  and took off the mask in one movement.</p>

  <p>"I've been looking for you everywhere, Mr. Staines. Lord Weald told me
  your name."</p>

  <p>Indubitably it was Mary Dane. He could only stare at her stupidly; then,
  recovering his presence of mind, he stammered:</p>

  <p>"Has&mdash;have you been here all this evening?" Her eyebrows went up.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but you haven't. Why?"</p>

  <p>Dick swallowed something. "Why did you want to see me?" he asked, feeling
  extraordinarily foolish.</p>

  <p>She opened a little bag that hung from her broad, white belt, and took out
  a gold pencil-case. Dick recognised it instantly as his own.</p>

  <p>"Either earlier in the day, or when you dashed madly to my rescue, you
  dropped this&mdash;the chairman found it. I've been trying all the evening to
  find you to restore it. And I'm terribly thirsty, and ... do you think you
  could find me an ice?"</p>

  <p>He went, clumsy-footed, to the buffet, and returned to find her sitting
  under a palm in a deep armchair. She took the plate with a little smile of
  thanks.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think I'm rather too frivolous for a staid nurse? The truth
  is, I came up here to see you after I'd handed over poor Mr. Cornfort to the
  night nurse and then I found the ball was on and somebody lent me a mask.
  What time is it?"</p>

  <p>He told her, and she made a little <i>moue</i>.</p>

  <p>"You saw Tommy, did you?"</p>

  <p>"Who's Tommy?&mdash;oh, Lord Weald! Yes, he was very amusing. He wasn't
  quite sure who I was and wanted me to unmask. I think he's rather a dear.
  He's a great friend of yours, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>And then, looking at his attire and his somewhat bedraggled
  appearance:</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd gone to London?"</p>

  <p>"I did go&mdash;I've come back to-night to see Tommy on rather an urgent
  matter," he said glibly.</p>

  <p>That the matter more closely affected Mr. Walter Derrick had not occurred
  to him until that moment, and he put a question to her. She shook her
  head.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Derrick? He's the man who tried to run over me to-day. No, I haven't
  seen him. He's probably here somewhere, disguised as Juggernaut!"</p>

  <p>They both laughed at this. A little later she handed him the plate and he
  went with her to find her cloak, and very boldly (he felt it was a bold act,
  at any rate) he offered to see her home.</p>

  <p>He was foolishly pleased when she accepted his invitation, and he went in
  search of Tommy's car. When he came back she was waiting for him under the
  portico. She and her charge were living at a small house on the outskirts of
  Hove, she told him. Mr. Cornfort did not like boarding-houses.</p>

  <p>There was a little silence after she had told him this, and then,
  unexpectedly, she said:</p>

  <p>"Why did you ask me whether I'd been at the dance all the night? As a
  matter of fact, I hadn't. I didn't come till nearly eleven o'clock. You
  looked so very severe&mdash;and&mdash;magisterial is the word&mdash;when you
  saw me, I thought you were going to arrest me on the spot&mdash;you are a
  detective. Lord Weald told me all about you. A 'Robert' he calls you."</p>

  <p>Inwardly Dick cursed the loquacious lordling. He was floundering with an
  excuse when she pointed.</p>

  <p>"There's the house, past the lamp-post on the left ... thank you."</p>

  <p>He pulled up before a small, semi-detached villa; a light shone in one of
  the upper rooms: presumably it was the bedroom of the sick Mr. Cornfort.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much." She put her warm hand in his, and was gone.</p>

  <p>He saw her go up the garden path, stop at the door, and evidently she
  rang, for a few moments after the door was opened by the night nurse, and was
  closed upon her. Dick swung round the car and went back to the Metropole to
  find Tommy Weald, and had the satisfaction of killing two birds with one
  stone. For Tommy, in the absurd costume of a bull-fighter, was telling what
  was evidently a very good story to a tall, stout pierrot.</p>

  <p>"Very good, my boy, very good!"</p>

  <p>Dick grinned and wondered how good would sound the story which he had to
  tell to Mr. Derrick.</p>

  <p>Tommy gaped at the unexpected spectacle of his friend.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" he piped. "Aren't you in Scotland?"</p>

  <p>Dick led the two men to a quiet spot and told them everything that had
  happened that night. He did not, for what seemed good and sufficient reason
  to himself, reveal the amazing resemblance of the woman whom he had
  discovered in the basement of Derrick's house to Mary Dane.</p>

  <p>Tommy was all a-twitter with excitement.</p>

  <p>"This is the most stupendous thing that has ever happened, dear old boy,"
  he said. "Never in all my experience have I heard anything like it."</p>

  <p>The big Mr. Derrick received the news and became unusually serious.</p>

  <p>"This is not the first time this has happened. There was an attempt made
  to get into my house three or four months ago," he said. "What they expect to
  find, heaven knows. I keep no valuables, and certainly my silver doesn't seem
  to be worth all the trouble. Was Larkin hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Larkin&mdash;is that the name of your caretaker? No, he wasn't at all
  hurt. I don't know what his head will be like in the morning: they evidently
  gave him a pretty stiff dope."</p>

  <p>"You say you saw the woman?" asked Mr. Derrick. "Would you recognise her
  again."</p>

  <p>"I saw her only for a few seconds, then the light went out. It is very
  difficult to undertake identification, especially of a woman. I'm not even so
  sure I should be able to recognise her dress, which was a pretty expensive
  one."</p>

  <p>"You didn't see a car outside the house?"</p>

  <p>For some extraordinary reason, Dick had forgotten the limousine that drew
  up at the corner of the street when the storm broke.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw a car, but I saw nobody get in or get out. I'm not so sure
  that it was in the street." He tugged at his memory. When he reached the top
  of the steps he had turned to the left towards Weald's house. He had never
  dreamt of seeing any trace of the fugitives, who would have had plenty of
  time to make their escape by the time he got out. It was probable, however,
  that the car was the means of escape.</p>

  <p>"Have you any enemies?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Derrick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"None whatever. If it had been my poor old father, I could well understand
  why quite a number of people would have liked to come after his worldly
  possessions, but I have never had the slightest trouble with the few tenants
  I have, and it's very unlikely ... no." He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"What are you thinking of?" asked Dick quickly.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Walter Derrick did not attempt to explain. However exuberant he
  might have been before Inspector Staines had told him of the adventure, he
  was well sobered now.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to get back to Lowndes Square."</p>

  <p>"I can drive you back to-night," said Tommy eagerly.</p>

  <p>"We'll go in your car," interrupted Dick, "but I shall want a chauffeur to
  do the driving. Somehow I don't think this is my lucky night."</p>

  <p>They routed out Tommy's chauffeur, who, happily for him, had gone to bed
  very early that night, and by half-past two in the morning Lord Weald and his
  neighbour had discarded their fancy costumes, and, in the garments of
  civilisation, taken their places in the car.</p>

  <p>The journey back to Town seemed interminable. Dawn was in the sky when,
  splashed with mud, the big Rolls pulled up before Derrick's house. As Dick
  expected, there was a policeman on duty outside the door. He was a little
  uncommunicative until Inspector Staines made himself known. The case, he
  said, had been taken by a detective-sergeant and a detective, but they had
  long since left the house.</p>

  <p>Derrick let himself in with a key, and the two men followed. They found
  that the caretaker was up and dressed. Though he was not a nervous man, he
  confessed that he had found it impossible to get to sleep that night.</p>

  <p>Together, the three men made a tour of the house. On the way up Dick had
  explained the circumstances which had brought him, a trespasser, into Mr.
  Derrick's household; and apparently the broken French window on the third
  floor had been seized upon by the detectives as proof that an entrance had
  been effected by this means.</p>

  <p>"Which shows that Roberts don't know everything," said Tommy.</p>

  <p>When they came downstairs the caretaker remembered a piece of news which
  he had omitted to give them.</p>

  <p>"The police found a finger-print on the beer-glass. They took the glass
  away to Scotland Yard to have it photographed," he said.</p>

  <p>This was intensely interesting news to at least one of the three.</p>

  <p>It was broad daylight when Lord Weald open the door his house and a weary
  Dick followed him into the hall.</p>

  <p>"You've got time for a nice bath, a bit of breakfast, and you'll be able
  to sleep on the train," said Tommy. "To tell you the truth, old boy, I'm
  rather sorry you're going&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not going," said Dick quietly. "This is a matter which I feel
  requires a little personal attention. I'm reporting to the Yard this morning,
  and if I'm in luck I shall get this case allotted to me."</p>

  <p>He had a leisurely breakfast, and at the earliest convenient hour he
  called upon the Assistant Commissioner, whose guest he was to have been, and
  explained why he would prefer to spend his holiday in London. His host was
  too keen a policeman to object to this change of plans.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock Dick went on to Scotland Yard, interviewed the Chief
  Constable and the Superintendent, and had the case given into his hands.</p>

  <p>"And it's a pretty big case, Staines," said Superintendent Bourke; "bigger
  than you imagine."</p>

  <p>Dick looked at him in surprise. That it was an unusual case he was well
  aware, but its importance was not so obvious.</p>

  <p>"Nine years ago," said Bourke, very slowly, "the cashier of the Textile
  Company was shot down by a motor cyclist, who robbed him of about six hundred
  pounds. Do you remember that?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"I read the case. I'd only just come into the police force."</p>

  <p>"We never caught the man," said Bourke, looking at him thoughtfully. "The
  only clue we got was a very distinct thumb-print on the pistol
  barrel&mdash;remember that?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"I remember it very well: I've seen the thumbprint a score of times: it
  was also used as an illustration in the late Commissioner's memoirs."</p>

  <p>"Late Commissioners shouldn't have memoirs!" growled Bourke. "But get that
  fact into your head, Staines. Ten years ago a man is shot in cold blood,
  robbed of six hundred pounds, and the murderer gets away without a trace,
  leaves only an unknown thumb-print on the barrel of the pistol."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've got that in my mind," said Dick, wondering what was coming
  next.</p>

  <p>Bourke opened a drawer, took out a photograph, and threw it on to the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Take a look at that," he said. "It's interesting&mdash;it's the
  finger-print of the Slough murderer, and it was found on the beer-glass in
  Derrick's house to-night!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DICK looked at the thumb-print, hardly believing the
  evidence of his senses. The Slough murder was one of the classic cases, where
  an unknown man commits a murder in broad daylight, escapes, leaving a
  finger-print, is not arrested, and disappears as though the earth has opened
  for him. How many hundreds, how many thousands of new criminals who had
  fallen into the hands of the police had had their thumb-prints taken and
  compared with the mark on the pistol? He himself had examined the
  impressions, every whorl, every island&mdash;he could have almost drawn it
  from memory.</p>

  <p>"The whole case is rather mysterious, isn't it? Why they should have gone
  into Derrick's house at all? Even the pictures on the walls are hardly worth
  more than their frames. Yet this is the second attempt that has been
  made&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Third," corrected Bourke. "There's one that Derrick doesn't know about.
  Do you know what I think? Sit down!" Superintendent Bourke liked his audience
  to be seated. "Old man Derrick, Walter Derrick's father, had a
  hobby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've heard about it," said Dick. "Curiously enough, his son was telling
  me last night."</p>

  <p>"About the finger-prints?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"He must have collected thousands," said Bourke. "We used to call him 'the
  amateur record officer.' He was out to find two finger-prints exactly alike
  and upset the whole of our organisation. Although he was the most miserly man
  I ever heard about&mdash;they say he ran that big house of his on five pounds
  a week&mdash;he went to any amount of expense to collect the prints. He was
  as fanatical as a stamp fiend. He even paid collectors in big factories to
  send him specimen prints. The only joy he had in life was to sit over them
  night and day, comparing, measuring, and classifying. I must say that he
  knew the subject even better than our men at Scotland Yard&mdash;at any rate,
  as well. If his eyesight hadn't failed he might have made a discovery of some
  sort."</p>

  <p>He looked at Dick long and earnestly, and Inspector Staines knew his chief
  well enough to refrain from stimulating him.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what my theory is," said Bourke at last. "I believe, in the
  course of his collecting, by some accident he got the thumb-print of the
  Slough murderer."</p>

  <p>"But the collection has been destroyed," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"Has it?" Bourke was obviously sceptical. "I know that as soon as Walter
  Derrick got home and got to work he began to clear out the collection. They
  were bound up in books: there was a whole wall full of 'em. As a matter of
  fact, I know, because I saw them. After the old man died Walter sent to the
  Yard and asked if we'd like to accept them, but we've no use for law-abiding
  folk, so we turned the offer down. They were afterwards destroyed&mdash;but
  were they all destroyed? This bird who is in Walter Derrick's house at odd
  moments knows as much about the burning of the collection as anybody else.
  Why, then, does he take the trouble and the risk, and spend the money? He or
  she is looking for a finger-print. Twice they've been after it; once they had
  the house to themselves&mdash;it was when he was in Monte Carlo&mdash;that's
  why he had the caretaker put in&mdash;and not once have they stolen anything
  valuable."</p>

  <p>Bourke threw out his arms with a dramatic gesture.</p>

  <p>"My son, go get this lady and gentleman, and you'll find the man who
  killed the Slough cashier!"</p>

  <p>Dick approached this case as he had approached a dozen others, by
  forgetting all that he knew about it. But some things were very difficult to
  forget. Happily, the grey-eyed nurse was no longer under suspicion. He was
  thinking a lot about the grey-eyed nurse; he said very scornful and derisive
  things about himself, made grimaces of contempt when he was shaving in the
  morning, and in more charitable moments was slightly amused by his own
  stupidity, his childishness.</p>

  <p>Here was something very beautiful that had swum into his ken and had
  vanished again&mdash;a comet figure of loveliness and grace, visible just so
  long as it takes to stir a man's imagination, long enough to throw tiny roots
  in his heart so that the wrenching out was very painful. He would never see
  her again.</p>

  <p>Tommy, it seemed, was more fortunate. He had seen her at Littlehampton,
  reading in one of the shelters on the foreshore, Mr. Cornfort sleeping, the
  shabby and unshaven chairman smoking a surreptitious pipe behind the shelter,
  having propped the wheels of his bath chair with large cobbles. All of this
  Tommy related in a letter:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Naturally, old boy," he wrote, "I hopped off my machine
  and gave her a how-d'you-do. She was most affable, and asked after you. Then
  the old gent woke up and cracked a couple of good gags about the weather that
  I seemed to have heard before (I told <i>her</i> this after he'd gone to
  sleep again, and she was frightfully amused)."</p><br>

  <p>Tommy was going on to Petworth, or somewhere near Petworth, where he had
  most ferociously boring relations, who live in a sort of moated castle.
  Fearfully damp and terribly depressing in wet weather, but dear Aunt Martha
  may pop off any day, and what with these socialists, dear old boy, you can't
  afford to chuck away a chance of beating up an honest penny.</p>

  <p>Dick read the letter at Scotland Yard, and envied this flighty bachelor
  who had such wonderful opportunities of meeting the grey-eyed nurse, even in
  Littlehampton. Why hadn't Tommy stayed in Littlehampton? he thought
  irritably. Dick could have gone down to see him, to consult him&mdash;well,
  he would probably have seen her. He had half a mind to tell her of the
  ludicrous double business, of how at first sight he had confounded her with a
  soulless adventuress. It almost seemed an excuse worthy of the journey to
  tell her that alone. He told himself that he was getting childish, which was
  probably true.</p>

  <p>The finger-print found on the beer-glass of the caretaker was without
  question identical with that found nine years before on the jacket of an
  automatic pistol. From the Scotland Yard records patient men dragged out
  every particular about the Slough murder and began to prepare a dossier. To
  bring that record up to date required no very great ingenuity. When they had
  finished their labours they knew no more about the murder than they had known
  nine years before.</p>

  <p>Dick had an invitation one morning to lunch with Mr. Walter Derrick at his
  club. The postscript ran:</p>

  <p>"By the way, did the finger-print you found on the glass help you?"</p>

  <p>He had no intention of telling Derrick of the momentous discovery. It is
  not the business of the police to arouse unnecessary alarm in the bows of
  innocent citizens. He was by no means sure that Superintendent Bourke's
  theory was right, and his first step, now that he had been given the case,
  was to discover all that was possible about the known actors in this little
  drama. Mr. Derrick's position was very clear: he was a very rich man, and it
  was quite likely that he possessed movable property that would reward a
  burglar. Old Derrick's wealth had been largely in real estate, and Dick
  Staines sought out one of the most important agencies in the City of London,
  and, by great good luck, picked, upon the one firm that could inform him.</p>

  <p>The partner whom he interviewed had a great deal to say about the miserly
  father of Walter, and much of it was uncomplimentary.</p>

  <p>"The shrewdest old devil that ever bought land!" was his verdict. "He had
  an instinct for values. He started life as a working builder, and years ago
  he used to do his own repairs on his properties. He could handle a trowel
  with the best of bricklayers, and my father once told me that he had seen him
  slating the roofs of some small cottage property of his in the South of
  London."</p>

  <p>"He left a lot of property?" asked Dick. The partner shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not he," he said emphatically. "He was too wily a bird; he knew just when
  values were at their highest and sold. About eighteen months before he died
  we sold four properties for him, the gross value of which was eight hundred
  thousand pounds. I remember this distinctly, because there was a wrangle
  about the commission. He sold another block&mdash;two office buildings in the
  City&mdash;through Haytors for a hundred and fifty thousand at the same time.
  He was a queer old devil, and invariably insisted upon being paid in hard
  cash. No cheques for old Joshua! I had the satisfaction of seeing him walk
  down Queen Victoria Street with a valise containing over half a million
  pounds in bank-notes. So far as I know, he never invested a penny."</p>

  <p>"Probably he bought more property?"</p>

  <p>The agent shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, but he was on the point of doing so. The market was rising again just
  before he died, and I had opened personal negotiations with him for the
  purchase of a big City block for four hundred and twelve thousand
  pounds."</p>

  <p>"A man like that must have made enemies?" suggested Dick, but this view
  was contested.</p>

  <p>"All business people make enemies, but I shouldn't think old Joshua
  aroused any very strong animosity. Even the estate agents, with whom he
  bargained to the last penny, did not really dislike him. The only thing he
  would never sell was his house in Lowndes Square, and I happen to know that
  he had some very good offers for it, even during the property
  slump&mdash;offers which I imagined he would jump at. But I suppose he had
  some sentimental interest in the house&mdash;he built it, or rebuilt it,
  himself, and he would never listen to the best of offers."</p>

  <p>Mr. Walter Derrick's club was a large and handsome establishment in Pall
  Mall, devoted to motorists. Dick found him waiting in the busy vestibule, and
  was greeted with that cheerful grin which Mr. Derrick gave to all and sundry,
  for he was a very friendly man.</p>

  <p>"Got on my nerves, that infernal burglary," he said, as he bustled Dick
  into the crowded dining-room. "Couldn't sleep last night. By the way, that
  stupid caretaker of mine is beginning to recover his memory. He says the girl
  was as pretty as paint. That's the worst of being a rich bachelor. They'll
  get you, even if they have to break into the house for you!"</p>

  <p>He gurgled with laughter at this jest, but was more serious when he came
  to speak about the incoveniences to which he had been put.</p>

  <p>He was going to the country that evening, he said, leaving a double guard
  at the town house.</p>

  <p>"I still don't know what these people are after," he said. "Now if it had
  been in the days of my governor, I could have understood. The poor old man
  kept all his money in a steel box under his bed&mdash;he never had dealings
  with a banker if he could possibly help it. We found in there&mdash;or
  rather, the nurse found it&mdash;four hundred and twelve thousand pounds in
  bank-notes."</p>

  <p>Dick looked up sharply.</p>

  <p>"How much?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Derrick repeated the sum.</p>

  <p>"But that wasn't all you inherited?"</p>

  <p>Walter Derrick's eyes twinkled.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me a fairly useful sum," he said. "Yes, as a matter of fact
  that was my inheritance. People think I'm a millionaire&mdash;well, I feel
  like one, and so will you when you have the handling of four hundred thousand
  pounds!"</p>

  <p>A light was beginning to dawn on Dick Staines.</p>

  <p>"But did you make any inquiries as to any other moneys he might have had?"
  he asked. "Didn't his lawyer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The old gentleman never employed a lawyer," said Derrick. And then,
  curiously: "Why are you so excited about it, Mr. Staines? There was a little
  house property, but of no great value. The four hundred and twelve thousand
  pounds was the total I inherited."</p>

  <p>Dick stared at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you or your lawyer made no inquiries of the people with
  whom he had dealings, the estate agents, that you found no receipts or
  memoranda connected with his business?"</p>

  <p>"None," said Walter slowly. "What are you driving at, Staines?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you in a minute," said Dick. "Tell me this: Did your father die
  suddenly, or was he ill for very long?"</p>

  <p>"He died quite suddenly. He took to his bed one day and was dead the next.
  Until then he was in perfectly good health. Now what is the mystery?"</p>

  <p>It was no mystery to Dick Staines now, as he explained.</p>

  <p>"The money you found under his bed was the purchase price of a property
  for which he was negotiating just before he died. I know that from one firm
  alone he received eight hundred thousand pounds, from another a hundred and
  fifty thousand, and probably, if you canvassed the estate agents of London
  you would discover that he sold property to the value of a million within a
  year of his death. Therefore, the money you discovered beneath his bed was
  only a portion of his actual property, and since he seems to have been in the
  habit of keeping his wealth in hard cash, it is pretty clear that the
  remainder is somewhere hidden in your house."</p>

  <p>Walter was staring at him; his face had gone a little pale.</p>

  <p>"You must think I'm a fool not to have made these inquiries," he said;
  "and I probably am. Just tell me, Staines, what you know, and I promise you
  that if you've been instrumental in restoring my property, I shall not forget
  what I owe to you."</p>

  <p>Dick Staines wriggled a little at this. He had never grown hardened to the
  promises of reward which had come his way from time to time.</p>

  <p>"I suggest that you and I go back to your house, and that we make a very
  thorough search. Somewhere in that house is a hiding-place that nobody knew
  but your father. This is all the more likely because, if I understand aright,
  he was the builder, and probably overhauled the plans of the architect."</p>

  <p>Whilst he was talking, he saw Walter Derrick's lips part to ask a
  question. The words were unspoken, but Staines knew just what the words were,
  and was a little startled.</p>

  <p>They finished their lunch quickly, and Derrick drove him back to the house
  in Lowndes Square. Dick had already made a survey of the building in
  daylight. It was bigger than any other house in the square, an ugly edifice,
  and he might well suspect that the elder Derrick had not only assisted and
  amended the work of the architect, but had been responsible in the main for
  its unsightly additions.</p>

  <p>He had remarked before that in appearance it was not unlike a public
  institution, with its façade of white glazed brick.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Derrick opened the door he found the vigilant caretaker in the
  passage.</p>

  <p>"I got your message, sir."</p>

  <p>"My message? What message?"</p>

  <p>"You telephoned saying the gentleman was calling this evening to measure
  the rooms for the new carpets."</p>

  <p>Derrick and Dick Staines looked at one another. "All right," said Derrick
  quietly.</p>

  <p>He beckoned the detective up to the drawing-room on the first floor, and
  closed the door.</p>

  <p>"I sent no such message," he said. "I was leaving this afternoon for my
  place at Godalming, as I told you, and I had no intention of returning to
  Lowndes Square. That's a pretty clumsy trick&mdash;Larkin could easily have
  got on to me by telephone."</p>

  <p>"Too clumsy to be genuine," said Dick. "It&mdash;almost seems as if they
  wanted you to be in the house to-night. I should let them have their wish,
  and I will be here."</p>

  <p>Derrick looked troubled.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it, I can't understand it," he said vehemently. "Why
  the devil are they bothering me? There's something about this business that
  is rattling me. What is there behind it? Why should they&mdash;" He stopped
  suddenly and frowned. "No, I can't think."</p>

  <p>And then, shaking off the gloom which was settling upon him, he became
  suddenly his old chuckling self.</p>

  <p>"Come along and find the treasure house," he said.</p>

  <p>From room to room they went, pulling up carpets, examining and tapping
  walls, prying into cupboards that had not been opened, according to Walter,
  since his father's death. The house had the solidity of a fortress. The walls
  were thick, but Walter Derrick explained that his father had a weakness for
  solidity. As a boy he had lived in an old house that had collapsed in the
  dead of night, and he had narrowly escaped death.</p>

  <p>Most of the rooms were so proportioned as to be positively ugly.
  Everywhere was evidence of the amateur architect's hands: odd little
  staircases that seemed to have been put in as an afterthought; inaccessible
  windows that must have been the despair of a generation of housekeepers. The
  façade was not altogether unsightly. Old Mr. Derrick had conformed roughly to
  the general architecture of the square. There was a stone balcony on each
  floor, which ran continuously along the two fronts of the block.</p>

  <p>For two hours they delved and examined and tapped, but found nothing.
  Eventually they came to the room where Dick had made his entry that stormy
  night, and Derrick unlocked a cupboard.</p>

  <p>"Here's something that will interest you," he said.</p>

  <p>He stooped and took out a dusty iron box. It was very heavy; the key was
  still in the lock.</p>

  <p>"This is the box which contained the money and a few odds and ends of no
  great value."</p>

  <p>It was as much as Dick could do to lift the box and swing it on to a
  table. It was made of solid steel, and was deep and wide. He opened the lid,
  and saw inside a curious brass instrument which had the appearance of a
  syringe. There were two curved grips, and, silver at the end of the piston, a
  grip rather like the butt of a pistol. Attached to the other end was a large
  cup of red rubber.</p>

  <p>"What is this fearsome weapon?" he asked, examining it curiously.</p>

  <p>"I've never been able to find out."</p>

  <p>It was strongly made and heavy; the brass cylinder was seven inches in
  diameter and short. Projecting from the cylinder end on either side were two
  stout brass grips about four inches long. He puzzled over this for a little
  while, and then saw what it was; and, wetting the edges of the rubber cup, he
  pressed the rubber flat upon the polished surface of the steel box and drew
  back the piston end. Presently he heard a click, and the piston moved no
  more. Holding the two grips, he lifted the steel box from the table. As he
  thought, it was a small vacuum machine, and not until he had found the spring
  that released the pistol grip and allowed it to sink back again was he able
  to pry loose the rubber cup from the surface of the box.</p>

  <p>"Where was this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It was inside the chest with the money. I think it was on top."</p>

  <p>Dick put back the 'sucker' in the box and closed the lid.</p>

  <p>Later that afternoon he interviewed a retired builder in the Wandsworth
  Road: an old man whose memory was a little defective, but who could very well
  recall the circumstances of his contract with the elder Derrick. He
  remembered, in the course of the building, a long, shallow safe coming to the
  house, but where it was placed he had no knowledge. Mr. Derrick, as Dick
  suspected, had worked on the building himself, and, to the scandal of the
  neighbourhood, had even spent his Sundays in an old suit, plying a trowel.
  More than this: he had stopped all the work for three months and had brought
  in black workmen. The old builder thought they were Moors, for the only
  holiday Mr. Derrick permitted himself was an occasional month in Tangier, in
  the days when living was cheap, and it was possible to reach the North Coast
  of Africa on a fruit boat for a few pounds.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HIS memory, however, was not entirely reliable in regard to
  essentials. But he remembered one recent trifle, and produced a sensation by
  its recital.</p>

  <p>"It's a funny thing," quavered the old man, as he offered a limp hand at
  parting, "that all sorts of people want to know about that there house. I had
  a young lady here a day or two ago&mdash;pretty as a picture she was, a bit
  of a girl. She said she was writing a book about houses, and wanted to know
  if I had any old plans. And, sure enough, up come the question of this house
  of Mr. Derrick's."</p>

  <p>"What was she like?" asked Dick. "Tall or short, stout ...?"</p>

  <p>The old gentleman considered.</p>

  <p>"Well, now you come to mention it, I don't remember anything about her
  except that she'd got very pretty eyes&mdash;a sort of greyish-blue, just
  like my granddaughter's; sort of long, dark lashes over 'em."</p>

  <p>Dick knew that he was describing the eyes of Mary Dane, or Mary Dane's
  double. He thought it was a moment to make the tactful admission that he was
  a police officer.</p>

  <p>"Detective, are you? Well, I can't tell you anything more than I've told
  you. She wanted to know where she could find the architect, and I gave her
  his address. She wrote it down on this very table." He pointed shakily. "She
  couldn't find a pencil for a bit, and then she took one out of her
  bag&mdash;a gold one with a big red stone at the end of it."</p>

  <p>Dick's jaw dropped: he was describing the pencil he had lost, and which
  Nurse Mary Dane had restored to him.</p>

  <p>It was a sorely puzzled man who left Scotland Yard that evening and walked
  to his lodgings. It was half-past eleven, and once he had left the Strand
  behind him he was in a fairly deserted area till he came to Holborn. This
  passed, he entered the silence and desolation of Bloomsbury, and was feeling
  a twinge of annoyance that he had so precipitately left his flat, when he
  found interest in one of those unpleasant little dramas which are all too
  frequent in a great city.</p>

  <p>A woman was walking ahead of him, so far ahead that he could not be
  certain that it was a woman and not a man. As he swung along he gradually
  overcame her, though he was totally unconscious of the fact. Her assailant
  must have been coming from the opposite direction: Dick did not see him until
  he heard a girl's cry and saw two people struggling. He quickened his pace
  and came up to them as, slipping from the man's grasp, the girl turned to
  fly. She cannoned into the detective and almost knocked him over. In another
  second the man had gripped her arm. He was tremendously tall, overtopping
  Dick Staines; his voice was thick and drunken and very loud.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Come back, you!"</p>

  <p>Inspector Staines caught him with a professional grip and swung him back
  against the railings of the gardens that occupied the centre of the
  square.</p>

  <p>Then he heard a little gasp from the girl, and, turning his head, found
  himself staring stupidly into the face of Mary Dane. She was dressed in a
  dark blue costume, and he might not have recognised her in the closely
  fitting hat if he had not known her.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Mr. Staines, please send that man away!"</p>

  <p>The long fellow was truculent, most anxious to take up the matter of an
  unprovoked appearance.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?" His voice was louder and even more raucous. "Can't I
  talk to a young lady ... old friend of mine from Capetown?"</p>

  <p>He waggled his finger drunkenly in the girl's face.</p>

  <p>"Didn't think I knew yer, did yer? But Lordy's got a memory: he never
  forgets people who done him a bad turn&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The actions of police officers are rather definite. Dick Staines again
  jerked the man against the railings without an effort.</p>

  <p>"Is this fellow annoying you?"</p>

  <p>He saw by the light of a street lamp that her face was very pale.</p>

  <p>"No ... I think he has mistaken me for somebody else."</p>

  <p>"Like hell I have!" said the stranger. "Your name's Mary de Villiers! And
  who are you, I'd like to know?" He turned suddenly on Dick.</p>

  <p>"I am Inspector Staines from Scotland Yard," said Dick, and at the words
  the long figure seemed to wilt. His voice sank to an ingratiating whine.</p>

  <p>"I'm not giving any trouble, Inspector. Perhaps I've made a mistake with
  this young lady. To tell you the truth, I've had a couple of
  drinks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let's have a look at you," said Dick, gripping him by the lapel and
  drawing him to the light.</p>

  <p>The first thing that struck Dick Staines was the man's extraordinarily
  narrow head; a long, brown face, a pendulous nose, small round eyes deeply
  set, and a ragged little moustache were photographed in Dick's memory.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, <i>baas</i>&mdash;Lordy Brown is my name. I landed last
  Saturday from the <i>Glamis Castle</i>. This young lady knows&mdash;well,
  maybe she doesn't know."</p>

  <p>Then, to Dick's surprise, he began talking rapidly in a language which the
  detective did not understand. At first he thought it was German, then he knew
  it to be Dutch, and the <i>taal</i> at that.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about. Do you understand that?" He
  turned to the watchful girl, who had withdrawn a little from the circle.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea he's trying to speak to me," she said.</p>

  <p>"To you, miss?" said Lordy Brown, almost humbly. "Why should I talk to
  you? I've given you enough trouble to-night. I'm a gentleman, and I
  apologise. Only landed from the <i>Glamis</i> on Saturday; I got a good
  friend here, Mr. Inspector. I went round to see him, but he wasn't in. Good
  feller, too ... knew him years ago when he was living in a dirty old tent in
  Tanganyika. He'll see Lordy right. Millionaire, this fellow is. Had a row
  with his old man and ran away to Africa, but a good feller&mdash;old Walter
  Derrick."</p>

  <p>Dick looked at him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Do you know London at all?" he asked. "Do you know&mdash;" He mentioned a
  cafe near Piccadilly Circus which almost every overseas tourist has visited.
  "Meet me there in half an hour. If you aren't there I'll come and find you.
  Where are you staying?"</p>

  <p>The man gave an hotel in a street off the Strand, and gave it so readily
  that Dick knew he was speaking the truth.</p>

  <p>"I'll see you in half an hour. If you're not there I'll come and find
  you," said Dick Staines, and without another word left the man.</p>

  <p>The girl was already walking slowly away. Evidently she expected his
  escort.</p>

  <p>"It was all very terrifying, and I rather lost my head," she said
  ruefully. "I didn't see this man until he came up to me ... I hate drunken
  people."</p>

  <p>"Where are you staying to-night?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She was staying at a private hotel in Gower Street. She had come up for
  the day from Littlehampton to do some shopping, and was going back next day.
  She did not like London particularly, she confided to him.</p>

  <p>"I want to ask you a question," said Dick. "Have you ever heard of
  somebody being so like you that you have been mistaken for one another?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think there's anybody in the world quite like anybody else,"
  she said. "Have I really got a double?"</p>

  <p>"A treble, unless Mr. Lordy Brown was talking in his sleep. He mistook you
  for a Miss Villiers of Capetown. Do you know Capetown?"</p>

  <p>To his surprise she nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was there two years ago," she said.</p>

  <p>"But you couldn't have been a nurse then: you weren't old enough."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly at this.</p>

  <p>"You're in a very complimentary mood to-night, Mr. Staines."</p>

  <p>And then she shivered.</p>

  <p>"I wish I hadn't seen that man; I'm rather worried about him."</p>

  <p>He did not ask her why she should he worried about a man she did not know
  and whom she might not see again.</p>

  <p>"It is queer that he should know Derrick," he said.</p>

  <p>She did not answer, and when he repeated the rather banal statement:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Derrick? He was the gentleman with the yellow motor-car? Is he in
  London?"</p>

  <p>At present, Dick told her, Mr. Walter Derrick was at his country house in
  Surrey.</p>

  <p>"He is very fortunate," she said.</p>

  <p>He asked her why, and she smiled. When he pressed her:</p>

  <p>"How stupid you are! And Lord Weald&mdash;Tommy, don't you call
  him?&mdash;thinks you're so terribly clever! Wouldn't you think it good
  fortune not to have to entertain an old African friend like Mr. Brown? You're
  going to see him, aren't you&mdash;Brown, I mean? Do ask him who Miss de
  Villiers is&mdash;it's rather a common name in Capetown, if I remember
  rightly. Have you lost your pencil again?"</p>

  <p>The question recalled to his mind a matter that troubled him.</p>

  <p>"I almost thought I had," he said. "And this is where the question of your
  double comes in. There's a builder at Wandsworth named Ellington, a very old
  gentleman, who recently had a visitor&mdash;a lady, who, from his
  description, was rather like you&mdash;she called on the day the pencil was
  lost, and on the day ... something else happened that was rather remarkable.
  Ellington said the young lady had asked him for particulars about Mr. Walter
  Derrick's house, and that she had produced a pencil to write down an address
  that was obviously my pencil. Am I being very amusing?" he added, a little
  tartly, for she was laughing.</p>

  <p>"I think you're terribly amusing. Look!"</p>

  <p>She opened her bag and took out a shining gold object and handed it to
  him. He stopped to examine it: it was identical with the pencil he had in his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"I bought it this afternoon in Regent Street," she said solemnly. "I could
  have bought forty or fifty or a hundred! There seems to be a vogue in these
  pencils just now. I saw a man using one in the train. Where did you get
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Tommy gave me mine," he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course Tommy gave you yours!" she scoffed. "There's a shop in Regent
  Street selling nothing else&mdash;a fountain-pen shop. If you take the
  trouble to look, you will see an enormous display of them in the window; and
  if you think they're gold, they're not! I hate exposing your Tommy, but they
  cost seven and sixpence each, and I should think there are nearly fifty
  thousand of them in use. Will you tell me something?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you anything I can," he replied.</p>

  <p>She was silent for a little while, and then asked:</p>

  <p>"What is the great mystery? What do you mean when you say that I am three
  people&mdash;Miss de Villiers and myself and somebody else&mdash;who is the
  somebody else? Have they been committing terrible crimes, and did you really
  come down that night to Brighton to arrest me?"</p>

  <p>"What an absurd idea!" he began.</p>

  <p>"Don't prevaricate! I could see, the moment you came up to me in the
  ballroom, that there was something very, very wrong. I thought you'd come
  especially on my behalf&mdash;to catch me out&mdash;that was the sensation I
  had. And you did, too!"</p>

  <p>"Have you a sister?" he asked, and she nodded.</p>

  <p>"Aged twelve, and not a bit like me. She's rather dark. She's an awfully
  clever child, but not clever enough to impersonate me. Have I a twin? No. The
  truth is, Mr. Staines, I must be a very commonplace type."</p>

  <p>He could protest against this in the tritest possible way, but she changed
  the topic.</p>

  <p>She told him that any letters addressed to the little hotel where she
  stayed would always find her. That she should suggest his writing at all was
  ridiculously pleasing to him; the pleasure was somewhat modified at
  parting:</p>

  <p>"In case you find a fourth person like me, and you would like to know
  where I am," she mocked him.</p>

  <p>Dick went back to the café where he had arranged to meet the man from
  Africa, and found him sitting at a small corner table. Even amongst the
  Bohemian assembly he was an unusual figure, in his grey, soft shirt, open at
  the neck, his battered Stetson hat on the back of his narrow head, and the
  long, brown, lean face.</p>

  <p>There were people in the restaurant who knew Dick Staines and who turned
  their backs on him quickly when he made his appearance, for this was a
  favourite rendezvous of the swell mob, the "kite" men, the confidence
  artists, and that queer little world of fashionably dressed young men who lie
  in wait for gullible strangers.</p>

  <p>"What'll you drink, captain?" asked Lordy Brown, and his fingers snapped
  at a waiter like the crack of a pistol. "Hi, you! Get the captain a
  drink."</p>

  <p>But Dick was not drinking anything stronger than a lemon-squash.</p>

  <p>"I'd have had one myself, but I've lived on it for years&mdash;lime-juice
  and bad water! The sight of a cordial bottle makes me go sick in the stomach!
  Hope you don't think any the worse of me, captain, for that little business
  with the young lady? The truth is, I was a bit tight. Do you know my friend
  Mr. Walter Derrick?"</p>

  <p>He was obviously taken back when Dick replied in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>"A good feller, rather soft, but good. Funny' how I met him. He had a camp
  at a place called Pakasaka, gold prospecting, him and a feller named Creave.
  I come across him in the bush. He was a pretty sick man&mdash;been mauled on
  the leg by a lion&mdash;but I got him back to his camp. I'll bet he remembers
  that, captain! I'll bet he'll say 'Why, Lordy, what can I do for you, you old
  crook!' Full of jokes, was Walter. If ever there was a witty man or
  gentleman, he was that man."</p>

  <p>"Or gentleman," suggested Dick, amused.</p>

  <p>"I was in the camp four days lookin' after his leg&mdash;left calf cut up
  something awful. He went after a mangy old lion&mdash;that sort can be
  dangerous. He said he'd be a limpin' cripple all his life, but I says No. You
  trust me, Walter.' Naturally, with my experience&mdash;I'm better than a
  doctor. Plug in the iodine an' plenty of hot water&mdash;better than a
  doctor. Walter will remember that! He'll say, 'Lordy, I'm glad to see you!
  You saved my life, Lordy, an' now you're down and out I'll save you!'"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," said Dick when the loquacious man paused.</p>

  <p>"Of course he will. Us <i>voorlopers</i> always stand together. We're the
  salt of the earth. We're different from you fellows at home&mdash;we've been
  through it. My brother was one of the original pioneers. I know the country
  from Christmas Pass to the Falls and down again to Buluwayo. I've prospected
  in Barotseland and Bechuanaland; I've lived in the Kalahari."</p>

  <p>He looked at Dick with a speculative eye. Evidently he was debating in his
  mind whether he should give him an item of information which he had almost
  given once or twice in the course of the conversation.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll be finding out who I am, Inspector? Well, I'm not going
  to give you any bother&mdash;I believe in treating the police as gentlemen.
  I've been in trouble, I admit it; I've done two terms in Pretoria Central,
  and there's no sense in denying it&mdash;twelve months and three and a half
  years. But that was in the days when I used to drink, and got led astray by
  people who were worse than me. I'm straight now. The other game doesn't pay.
  You know that better than I do, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"What were your offences?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lordy Brown coughed embarrassedly.</p>

  <p>"Well, they were bad and yet they weren't bad. I wasn't the chief man in
  either job."</p>

  <p>It was the old cant that Dick knew so well. Evidently Mr. Lordy Brown was
  not particularly proud of his crimes, since for a long time he rambled about
  the subject before he made the confession.</p>

  <p>"The first job was just gold robbery from a prospector&mdash;he was tight
  and I was tight, and I don't really know the rights of it even now. But the
  police swore my life away&mdash;they're not so honest as they are in
  England," he added hastily. "I had my first dose in Pretoria Central. The
  second job I was innocent, in a manner of speaking. They told me the
  gentleman was buying diamonds&mdash;you're not allowed to buy diamonds in
  South Africa&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know all about I.D.B.," said Dick. "Well?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said Mr. Lordy Brown slowly, "I went to tip him off and tell
  him the police would be looking for him. I might have asked him for a few
  pounds to get me to Capetown, but nothing worse than that. Well, it appears
  that this gentleman wasn't buying diamonds at all, and I got four years on
  false evidence."</p>

  <p>"For trying to blackmail him, in fact: is that your weakness?"</p>

  <p>Lordy did not attempt to deny the impeachment, but thought it necessary to
  proclaim the purity of his motives with regard to Mr. Walter Derrick.</p>

  <p>"There's a gentleman that is a gentleman. I know nothing against him
  except that he's too generous! That man couldn't do a crooked thing&mdash;and
  such a jocular chap! Full of fun and amusement. Do you know what he used to
  call his leg when I was dressing it&mdash;the lion's share! It takes a man to
  make a joke about his own troubles, don't it?"</p>

  <p>When he said he was broke he was speaking in a figurative sense. He
  confessed to Dick that he had landed with 'a few' pounds, and regretted, in a
  half-hearted way, that he had ever left South Africa. The detective guessed
  that there was a very excellent reason for his leaving.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever get into trouble in Capetown?" asked Dick suddenly.</p>

  <p>By the man's hesitation he gathered that the full record of Lordy Brown's
  crimes had not yet been confessed.</p>

  <p>"There was a bit of a bother," replied Mr. Brown vaguely, "but I always
  say that give a dog a bad name and you might as well string him up! When I
  was there, Capetown was full of crooks, and naturally other people got the
  blame. Crooks! Half the Australian gang were there&mdash;men and women living
  in the best hotels and all on the make-haste."</p>

  <p>He felt the intensity of Dick's inquiring gaze, and became suddenly
  uncommunicative.</p>

  <p>"Who was Miss de Villiers?"</p>

  <p>Lordy Brown looked past him and for an instant was ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"Oh, her? Well, she was a&mdash;she was a lady I knew slightly."</p>

  <p>"Crook?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"I'm not giving any information about ladies," replied Lordy
  virtuously.</p>

  <p>Of one thing Dick was certain as he walked home: it was that this man
  really had been genuinely deceived when he addressed Mary Dane. There was
  nothing amorous, nothing friendly in his tone when he had spoken to her;
  rather was it the gloating satisfaction of an injured man who had met the one
  responsible for his misfortunes.</p>

  <p>He was intrigued, a little bit hurt. He analysed this latter sensation
  quite unnecessarily. He was hurt because he was fond of the girl and because,
  at the back of his mind, there was a suspicion, not entirely a conviction,
  that Mary and her double were one and the same. And yet, both he and Lordy
  Brown might easily have been deceived. They had both 'recognised' the girl in
  the half light: one in the basement of Walter Derrick's house, the other in
  the uncertain light of a street lamp. Why was she an enemy of Walter Derrick?
  What did she hope to gain by these mad adventures? His mind went back to the
  unknown Slough murderer. Was she a sister, a wife ...? He shook his head. In
  romance such things happen; in real life people are content to leave well
  alone.</p>

  <p>Suppose that the Slough murderer was behind these unaccountable outrages,
  he would certainly have known that all the finger-prints in the possession of
  old Derrick had been offered to the police by his son, and had been refused.
  And if they were hidden in some secret hiding place ... No, he rejected the
  finger-print theory. More likely was it that these midnight visitors were
  seeking the balance of old Derrick's money which they knew to be hidden in
  the house.</p>

  <p>So he could lift down Mary Dane and her double from the realm of romance,
  and place the latter where she would belong, if his theory held&mdash;a
  member of a clever gang who were seeking easy money, money which would never
  be missed and, therefore, would arouse no outcry.</p>

  <p>He lay sleepless in his bed for a long time that night, thinking and
  thinking, creating theories only to destroy them. He went to sleep with one
  resolve&mdash;to find the woman who was impersonating Mary Dane, and to lay
  bare a mystery which had begun to get on his nerves.</p>

  <p>Nothing but asinine infatuation (as he told himself) would have taken him
  to the little hotel in Gower Street where Mary had spent the night. As it
  was, he was punished for his act of folly, for Mary had left by an early
  train, although she had hinted to him that she would be in Town all day.</p>

  <p>"Are you Mr. Staines?" asked the maid, as she remembered a commission.
  "Would you mind waiting here, sir? The young lady left a letter for you; she
  said you would call this morning."</p>

  <p>In spite of his annoyance Dick laughed. How very sure this 'young lady'
  was, and how very wise in the ways of men! And his irritation was not easily
  dispersed. Certainly her letter did nothing to soothe him.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Staines</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter">"I am so sorry I have had to go back to Littlehampton. I
  had a telephone message early this morning that Mr. Cornfort was not so well.
  I'm so sorry I cannot lunch with you, but I do hope you will ask me
  again."</p><br>

  <p>The writing was small, rather childish. And now Dick Staines' annoyance
  was more acute, for he had called to ask her to go to lunch, and he was
  perfectly sure that on the night before he had made no mention of such an
  occasion.</p>

  <p>He could almost see her laughing at him, very gently, those grey eyes of
  hers alight with fun.</p>

  <p>"Curse the woman!" said Dick mildly, and went back to his duties.</p>

  <p>His duties that day were rather light, his task the re-reading of the
  Slough dossier. It was remarkable how little was known of the murder. The
  only evidence of the slightest value was given in a statement by a carter
  named, curiously enough, Carter, and a pencil note on the corner of the
  foolscap ran laconically: "This man has since died."</p>

  <p>Carter had seen the motor-cycle and side-car coming slowly from the
  direction of Maidenhead. The driver was dressed in brown and wore goggles.
  His height was difficult to ascertain because he sat astride of the machine.
  The murdered cashier was a man of forty, an amateur boxer, and a great
  pedestrian. It had been his habit to walk from Slough to the works, which
  were just outside the town, and to carry the money in a black bag. The
  managing director had considered this a dangerous proceeding, and had issued
  orders that the cashier was not to collect money unless he had a guard with
  him; but more often than not this rule was ignored. He was alone this morning
  when, in view of three or four people and the driver of a grocer's cart, the
  motor-cycle and side-car came to a halt by the edge of the path and the
  driver alighted.</p>

  <p>He was tinkering with his machine until the cashier came abreast,
  whereupon he turned round, whipped out his pistol and fired. Nobody saw the
  driver get back into his saddle, and before anybody realised what had
  happened he had disappeared. He had passed through Slough town, and,
  curiously enough, obeyed the signal of a traffic policeman who held him up to
  allow the passing of a trolley, and that was the last seen of him.</p>

  <p>The pistol was found in the middle of the road about forty yards from the
  murder, and the theory of the police was that in trying to put it into his
  pocket the murderer had let it slip and it had fallen down between the cycle
  and the side-car. Nothing was seen of the man: even his motor-cycle was never
  traced nor its number taken. Naturally enough, Scotland Yard had pulled in
  every man with a bad record and who had ever committed a hold-up, but they
  got no nearer the solution of the mystery, and the general idea at Scotland
  Yard was that he was an educated man who had escaped to France.</p>

  <p>Now it is a peculiar fact that ordinary criminals do not attempt to leave
  England, and for a very excellent reason. A man without a knowledge of a
  foreign language or of foreign customs is a hopeless creature in a new land.
  He is marked wherever he goes, and since the descriptions of wanted men are
  circulated instantly abroad, it would be generally impossible that they
  should evade capture.</p>

  <p>Scotland Yard can count on the fingers of one hand men who have committed
  crimes and have made for the Continent, and invariably these have been
  international crooks and safe-blowers who are as much at home in Paris and
  Berlin as they are in London.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was the Slough murder in a nutshell&mdash;a
  commonplace, wicked crime, committed by one who was obviously unknown to the
  police, since all the underground channels of information could bring no hint
  or clue as to the perpetrator.</p>

  <p>Dick read and re-read the various statements, as a score of other police
  officers had done, hoping to find the tiniest overlooked detail which would
  lead him to a new conception of the case. He read again the carter's
  statement, and no passage acquired any new significance. Returning the paper
  to its folder he sent the dossier back to the record office, and the
  messenger had hardly gone before his telephone bell rang, and he gathered
  from the delay that he was at the London end of a trunk call.</p>

  <p>"... Is that you, Staines?"</p>

  <p>He recognised the voice at once: it was Walter Derrick's.</p>

  <p>"Is anything wrong?" he asked quickly, and heard Derrick's laugh.</p>

  <p>"I should say not; only it's Saturday to-morrow, and I wondered if you'd
  care to come down and spend a week-end with me at my little place&mdash;or
  doesn't Scotland Yard allow you week-ends? If it's any inducement, Weald is
  coming ... No, it's not a house-party&mdash;just we three. You'll probably be
  bored, but the country is looking at its best."</p>

  <p>Dick had no very pressing engagement in London, and he was rather curious
  to find out Walter Derrick's impression of Mr. Lordy Brown.</p>

  <p>"I met a friend of yours yesterday," he said.</p>

  <p>"Who was that?" asked Derrick quickly.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you all about it when I come down&mdash;a queer bird!"</p>

  <p>"That really does sound like a friend of mine," chuckled Derrick. "Male or
  female&mdash;not my pet burglars?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing so interesting," said Dick.</p>

  <p>Before he left Town he made an inquiry of the Union Castle Line and was
  supplied with a list of homeward-bound passengers on the <i>Glamis
  Castle</i>. Neither in the first, the second, nor the third-class did he
  discover the name of Lordy Brown. In fact, nobody named Brown had travelled
  on that ship. This was not extraordinary: if the Inspector's theory was
  accurate, that Brown left South Africa in a hurry for South Africa's good, he
  would be travelling in an assumed name. There was, of course, the possibility
  that the man had been in England for a long time. Support to this theory was
  found when Dick discovered what was the likely cause of Lordy's flight. There
  had been, six months before, a series of wholesale burglaries in Capetown and
  a number of arrests had been made. Though Lordy Brown was not exactly wanted
  by the police, he was certainly suspected of being a member of the gang. Fear
  of detection might have been one of the reasons for his appearance in
  England.</p>

  <p>The record which came from the High Commissioner's office on the Saturday
  morning revealed how modest had been Lordy's claim. Not twice, but a dozen
  times had he seen the interior of African prisons, and had even served a
  sentence at the hands of the Congo Government in Elizabethville. Apparently,
  the man was a great traveller; he had described himself loosely as a
  prospector, but his basic employment was trader.</p>

  <p>Walter Derrick described his country home as being in Surrey. It was, in
  reality, on the very edge of Sussex, and within a few miles of Singleton. The
  estate was a small one, the house modern and unpretentious.</p>

  <p>Derrick met his guest at the station and drove him to Keyley. At his
  request the detective had called at the house in Lowndes Square and there
  found two men on duty. They had little or nothing to report, and expressed
  the opinion, which Dick endorsed, that no further attempt would be made on
  Derrick's property.</p>

  <p>"It's a wearisome business," he sighed, as his big car went swiftly down
  the long, straight road. "I really can't make head or tail of it. If, as you
  think, they suspect there is money hidden in the house, they must be just as
  hazy about its location as I am! Next week I'm going to get in an architect
  and a couple of builders, and we'll have a real search. Perhaps if I find
  anything these beggars will leave me alone."</p>

  <p>They found Tommy Weald standing outside the house, and he hailed Staines'
  arrival with joy.</p>

  <p>"I've had a perfectly boring week, and I looked like having the most
  ghastly week-end&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Derrick.</p>

  <p>But Tommy was not even apologetic.</p>

  <p>"I can't help it, old boy. My beastly relations have thoroughly depressed
  me. And if I hadn't accepted your invitation, Derrick, I should have been off
  to Bognor, getting acquainted with my little friend. She's adorable, Dick,
  old boy."</p>

  <p>"Who is this?" asked Derrick, amused.</p>

  <p>But Dick Staines was not anxious to discuss Mary Dane.</p>

  <p>It looked like being almost as dismal a week-end as Tommy had predicted.
  Dick had had rather a heavy week and was tired; Derrick was unusually
  taciturn at dinner; and Tommy yawned his way from course to course, being
  absolutely without good manners. If he spoke at all, it was of the 'divine
  nurse,' who had evidently made an impression upon his susceptible heart.</p>

  <p>"I am anxious to see your Miss Dane," said Derrick. "Have you met her?" He
  turned to Dick, who nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said quietly, "and <i>you</i> nearly met her&mdash;with your
  car!"</p>

  <p>Derrick's eyebrows went up.</p>

  <p>"Is she the lady I almost ran down in Brighton? Good Lord!"</p>

  <p>"I should never have forgiven you," yawned Tommy.</p>

  <p>He confessed that he was desperately sleepy, and when Derrick suggested he
  should go to bed, he accepted the suggestion with alacrity.</p>

  <p>Dick and his host walked out into the dusky grounds. It was a warm
  evening, and the air was heavy with the scent of roses. Somewhere in the
  distance Dick could hear the song of a nightingale.</p>

  <p>"Makes you think there isn't such a place as Scotland Yard in the world,
  eh?" bantered Derrick. "No rogues, no thieves, no murderers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick saw a dark, sinuous shape move swiftly across the lawn. Derrick saw
  it too.</p>

  <p>"No murderers ... hum! I've promised myself the pleasure of shooting that
  stoat one of these days. He got amongst my chickens the other night and
  played the devil with them." And then, abruptly: "Who's this friend of mine,
  Staines? You've made me terribly curious."</p>

  <p>"Not as curious as he made me," said Dick, smiling to himself in the
  half-darkness. "Do you know one Lordy Brown?"</p>

  <p>There was a silence.</p>

  <p>"Lordy Brown?" repeated the other slowly. "It sounds rather familiar. What
  is he&mdash;a circus performer?"</p>

  <p>"I should imagine he's been that amongst other things," said Dick. "Do you
  remember, when you were in Africa, being mauled by a lion? By the way, I
  didn't know you were a hunter."</p>

  <p>"I was hunted on that occasion," was his reply. "Was he the fellow who
  found Lordy Brown!" he said thoughtfully, adding: "A thin-faced man who talks
  about himself all the time. I remember, I thought he was dead ... I seem to
  have heard or read that he was drowned somewhere in Tanganyika. How did you
  come to meet him?"</p>

  <p>Here Dick Staines was prepared to lie a little.</p>

  <p>"I met him by accident," he said. "In any circumstances, I should probably
  have made his acquaintance, because my section deals with undesirable people
  from the overseas states. And, according to the High Commissioner's report,
  he is one of the most undesirable gentlemen that ever came from Africa."</p>

  <p>"Did he tell you he was a friend of mine?" asked Derrick with a gurgling
  little laugh as though he remembered something very amusing. "He didn't by
  any chance mention the fact that when he left our camp he took with him about
  twelve ounces of gold that we'd washed out of the river with a great deal of
  labour?"</p>

  <p>Dick could well imagine such an ending to Lordy's acquaintanceship.</p>

  <p>They paced up and down, Derrick with a cigar clenched between his teeth,
  his hands behind his back. Evidently the news of Lordy Brown's arrival had
  started a train of thought which was not particularly pleasant.</p>

  <p>"That fellow's got a nerve!" he said. "A friend of his! Did he tell you
  that he was on the run when he met us and that I sent fifty miles to the
  nearest magistrate to give him away? I should say Lordy Brown was the only
  genuine enemy I've had in my life. He hates me worse than poison! Now if he'd
  been in the country a few months ago, when these crimes were committed, I
  could very well understand them, especially&mdash;" He did not finish his
  sentence.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, you must expect him to call on you when you get back to Town,"
  said Dick. "He's staying at present at the Howfolk Hotel, off the Strand. I
  should imagine that he wants money."</p>

  <p>"I should imagine that he won't get any money from me," said Derrick
  quietly. "I remember him now&mdash;I think he's got a record of blackmail
  against him, but I'm not certain about this. One hears scraps of news, and
  I've probably fastened the crime on to the wrong man. If he comes to my house
  I shall certainly send for the police. He got on very well with my
  partner&mdash;a man named Cleave. I'm not so sure that Cleave hasn't some
  sort of record against him, though he was pretty well educated. Poor old
  Cleave I oughtn't to be talking against him. He went a little off his
  head&mdash;wandered into the bush and was never seen again. Just about then
  game had moved in our direction, and the place was overrun with lions. I shot
  two the day he disappeared."</p>

  <p>He threw away the end of his cigar and lit another.</p>

  <p>"I'm beginning to remember more about Lordy Brown," he said, after a long
  silence. "He blackmailed a man in Capetown, but, unfortunately for him,
  there's a pretty useful detective agency at the Cape, and Lordy was rather
  lucky not to be sent to the Breakwater. Queer&mdash;I'd forgotten all about
  the man," he said with a laugh of vexation, "and here am I giving you his
  biography! I'd like you to be with me when I meet him. He has probably
  written to me in Town, in which case I'll write and make an appointment on
  Thursday."</p>

  <p>He did not speak again that night about the iniquitous Lordy. The next
  afternoon, when he and a bored Tommy were playing clock golf, he made one
  reference to the adventure.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd find out, Staines, whether or not this fellow had a record
  of burglary. It may be as well to be sure it was not he who broke into my
  house."</p>

  <p>Mr. Derrick had the plebeian habit of sleeping on Sunday afternoon, and
  evidently Tommy knew of this, for hardly had their host retired when his
  lordship beckoned Dick into the garden.</p>

  <p>"I've got the car outside," he said. "What about a little run to
  Bognor?"</p>

  <p>Dick looked at him sternly.</p>

  <p>"Have you any relations at Bognor?" he asked, and Tommy giggled.</p>

  <p>"We might see her, old boy, on the front. She's always dodging up and down
  with that old ditherer. I'm sure she'll be awfully glad to see you," he said
  artfully. "She never meets me but she doesn't talk about you&mdash;says what
  an extraordinary fellow you are, and wonders how people like you got into the
  police force."</p>

  <p>Dick required very little persuasion; at the very suggestion his heart had
  leapt. He was, he confessed dismally, rapidly unfitting himself for the
  responsible position he held.</p>

  <p>It looked as though the trip to Bognor was to be in vain. For two hours
  they walked up and down the front, but there was no sign of Mary Dane, and
  they were seriously considering the advisability of returning to Keyley when
  Dick saw a yellow bath chair drawn slowly over the road at the end of the
  common, and a dainty blue and white figure immediately follow. In another
  second he was striding towards her.</p>

  <p>She was not at all surprised to see him, and for a good reason.</p>

  <p>"I've been watching you walking up and down the front for the past
  hour&mdash;our rooms in the hotel command a very good view."</p>

  <p>Tommy gave an incoherent excuse for their presence, but this she ignored.
  Mary's eyes were on Dick.</p>

  <p>"What have I been doing now? And have you found another miscreant with a
  seven-and-sixpenny gold pencil?"</p>

  <p>She looked meaningly at Tommy, who started guiltily.</p>

  <p>"And what happened at your interview with that dreadful man? I don't
  suppose you saw him, though."</p>

  <p>It was not a particularly pleasant afternoon for Tommy. If he came into
  the conversation at all it was by his own heroic efforts. The deaf chairman
  pulled the yellow vehicle ahead of them, and they followed at a distance of a
  few yards.</p>

  <p>"The doctor is sending Mr. Cornfort to the East Coast; we're going to
  Margate first, and then by boat to Clacton."</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with him?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>He had never really interested himself in the invalid, and he was rather
  shocked by his own callousness. She looked at him gravely.</p>

  <p>"That is the one question you must never ask a good nurse," she said, and
  for some reason Dick felt unaccountably foolish.</p>

  <p>It was not Tommy's idea of an afternoon out, and he said as much most of
  the way back to their host. He wished, he added, that he had not suggested
  the joy-ride to Bognor. Dick interrupted him brusquely.</p>

  <p>"When are you returning to Town?"</p>

  <p>"Not for a month," said Tommy. "I've got to go on to this wretched aunt of
  mine. She plays croquet, and loves it, old boy! It's obscene! Why do you want
  to know?"</p>

  <p>"I was wondering," said Dick slowly, "whether you would like me for a
  lodger. I took rather a fancy to that bedroom you put at my disposal, Tommy,
  and I've a mind to spend, say, the next month as your guest&mdash;don't stare
  at me, Tommy&mdash;stare at the road ahead; I notice your speedometer says
  fifty-five, and that's a bad speed to gape on."</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?" asked Tommy. And then, eagerly: "Is it a bit of police
  work? If it is, old boy, I'll give up aunt like a shot and come back with
  you."</p>

  <p>Dick hesitated. He might want help if the theory which was forming in his
  mind was justified; and he was not especially anxious to acquaint Scotland
  Yard with his suspicions. He had it in his mind that within the next few days
  the last, and possibly the most desperate, attempt would be made by the
  unknown to find the hidden treasure in the house in Lowndes Square.</p>

  <p>"Slow down, and I'll talk to you," he said, and when Tommy had dropped the
  speed of his car to a moderate thirty, Dick expressed himself with the
  greatest frankness.</p>

  <p>"You'll probably be amused and certainly be bored, and it's any odds that
  you'd spend a number of dull days without the slightest relief in the world.
  But if you'll put yourself entirely under my orders I'll make a little
  policeman of you. As to your unfortunate aunt, I think she will not be the
  loser by your absence. When can you come up to Town?"</p>

  <p>Tommy thought very quickly.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with Wednesday?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Seems an excellent day," said Dick. "And if you don't mind, I'll go back
  to your house to-night. I want you to write to your man&mdash;who'll hate to
  see me&mdash;giving me the free run of the house until you arrive. By the
  way, do you park any firearms?"</p>

  <p>"Two revolvers, old boy," said Tommy, with great satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Have you a police permit for them?"&mdash;and, when Tommy was silent: "I
  thought not I&mdash;at least I can have the satisfaction of pinching you if
  nothing else turns up. Where are they kept?"</p>

  <p>Lord Weald told him, and was prepared to stop the car and draw a diagram
  showing the exact position they occupied in a small bureau on the left-hand
  side of a door on the fourth floor, but this was unnecessary.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN they returned to Keyley they found Mr. Derrick playing
  bowls with his gardener. He did not seem in any way surprised that they had
  'taken the afternoon off,' as he put it.</p>

  <p>"This is a devil of a dull place without ladies. I nearly asked the nurse
  in to keep me company."</p>

  <p>"Which nurse is that?" asked Dick quickly.</p>

  <p>Derrick laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm blest if I know. I saw a nurse snooping round, admiring the gardens,
  and I hadn't the heart to tell her she was trespassing. Rather a slim little
  thing&mdash;pretty, as far as I could judge&mdash;I don't know whether I'm
  wrong, but it struck me it was the girl I nearly killed at Brighton; but then
  all nurses look alike."</p>

  <p>Dick and Tommy Weald exchanged glances. "If you'll tell me the
  time&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>"About an hour ago," said Derrick.</p>

  <p>"Then I can assure you it was not," said Tommy emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Funny ... I thought it was. As far as I can recollect the girl, she was
  like her. She was with a man; evidently they were very friendly. They
  disappeared for a time, and when I walked over to the end of the rose garden
  I saw them getting in a car&mdash;the nurse was driving. I loathe women
  drivers."</p>

  <p>Dick was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"Did you notice anything else about the nurse?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Derrick considered.</p>

  <p>"She was some distance away from me. The only thing I saw was that she
  wore bright brown gloves. Most nurses wear white."</p>

  <p>Here was another facer for the detective. Mary Dane had worn bright brown
  gloves: he had seen them at a distance, and had wondered why she wore
  something which was out of tone with her general colouring. Who, then, was
  this mysterious double, and why did she pick upon a perfectly inoffensive
  nurse?</p>

  <p>He made his excuses to his host, and Mr. Derrick, so far from being
  distressed by his premature departure, offered to put his car at Dick's
  disposal to take him back to Town, an offer which the detective was glad to
  accept, for the train service on a Sunday was appallingly bad. In the
  meantime, Tommy had got through to his house, and had given instructions for
  the reception and treatment of his guest.</p>

  <p>Dick found that the domestic staff had been augmented by two maidservants,
  and so far from his presence being resented, he was greeted with something
  like enthusiasm. Later in the evening, when his coffee was being served in
  the cheery bed-sitting-room, the butler explained the warmth of the
  welcome.</p>

  <p>"The maids are getting scared about Mr. Derrick's house, sir," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Why scared?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>The man looked a little sheepish.</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, it's silly nonsense, but they say it's haunted. So does
  the caretaker who's in charge. He says he's always hearing noises, and one
  night he saw Mr. Derrick's father, the old miser, going up the stairs ... saw
  him as plainly as I'm seeing you. It was a moonlight night, and he was so
  scared he didn't even dare to go after him."</p>

  <p>This was the first Dick had heard of any ghost in Derrick's house, and he
  was so impressed by the story that he rang through to Keyley.</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" scoffed Walter Derrick. "That's the first I've ever heard of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I interview your timorous caretaker?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit. Ring through to him&mdash;or I will. I don't suppose the house
  will be burgled in his absence. Or would you rather go in and see him?"</p>

  <p>Dick thought the latter plan best. He gave Derrick time to call up the
  caretaker before he himself knocked at the door. It was immediately opened.
  Dick did not fail to see that the custodian of the house carried a revolver,
  which he slipped into his pocket as soon as he had satisfied himself as to
  the identity of his visitor.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I've got the jumps, I don't mind telling you," he said. "I'm no
  believer in ghosts. I am an old soldier, and I've been caretaker in queerer
  places than this, though I never want to have another night like I had on
  Saturday. I saw the old man."</p>

  <p>"Did you know him by sight?" asked Dick, surprised.</p>

  <p>The caretaker nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've seen him lots of times. He used to come to our office&mdash;I was
  porter with the estate agents that he did a lot of business with. They still
  work for Mr. Derrick; that is how I come to get this job."</p>

  <p>"What was he like in appearance?"</p>

  <p>"Rather a thin feller, and small. Little above your shoulder, sir. He
  walks with a limp&mdash;you could tell it was he miles away."</p>

  <p>This was news to Dick. He had heard many stories of the parsimonious man,
  but, curiously enough, nobody had mentioned this physical infirmity of
  his.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me what happened when you saw the ghost."</p>

  <p>The man breathed heavily, as though the memory was something so appalling
  that he needed to brace himself for the effort of recital.</p>

  <p>"I was down in the kitchen having my supper, when I thought I heard a
  noise&mdash;somebody walking in the passage. I got up, took this old pistol
  of mine, and walked up the stairs into the hall. There was nobody I could
  see, so I turned on the lights. The drawing-room and the dining-room were
  both locked, and I said to myself that it must have been my imagination. I
  thought I heard a sound upstairs, and I went up&mdash;not in a great hurry, I
  can tell you. I reached the first landing, saw nobody, and then I looked up.
  He was standing near the landing window, and the moonlight was full on his
  face&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The old man?"</p>

  <p>The caretaker swallowed something and nodded. "What did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I just stood there, and saw him limp out of sight."</p>

  <p>"Was anything touched? Did you afterwards make an inspection upstairs? Not
  immediately&mdash;I don't imagine you did!" said Dick, smiling.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, nothing was touched. I'm not going to tell you a lie, sir,
  though if you tell this to Mr. Derrick I shall lose my job. I bolted
  downstairs as hard as I could pelt, and locked myself in the kitchen."</p>

  <p>Dick roared with laughter.</p>

  <p>"You poor old scare-cat!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said the embarrassed man, "I don't know what <i>you'd</i>
  have done. Of course, it sounds pretty silly, sitting here in a nice lighted
  room with lots of company, but I was alone in the house. And he's been seen
  there before: when my mate was with me, he said he saw him limping up and
  down outside the house. Naturally, my mate didn't know who he was, but when
  he described him to me I knew him at once."</p>

  <p>Dick considered the matter.</p>

  <p>"Suppose," he chaffed, "this wasn't a ghost, but a real flesh-and-blood
  man? Could anybody have got into the house?"</p>

  <p>"Only through the front door, and that was locked."</p>

  <p>"Bolted?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; there was no bolt and no chain on. The fact is, Mr. Staines,
  chains and bolts are pretty good to keep people out, but they also keep
  people in!"</p>

  <p>"In other words, they stop your escape, eh? Now where do you sleep?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sleeping in the kitchen, sir."</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Dick. "Then I'll tell you what I want you to do, and I'll get
  Mr. Derrick's authority for it. I'd like you to move your bed into this next
  room." He pointed to the wall that separated the two houses.</p>

  <p>"The office, sir?" said the man uneasily. "If you ask me anything, that's
  the place this feller's always going to."</p>

  <p>"Let's forget the ghost for a little while and concentrate upon
  safety."</p>

  <p>Dick went out on to the balcony whence he had started his perilous
  adventure. The iron shutters were all up now; that which had locked him out
  had been repaired.</p>

  <p>"If you sleep in that room, and I am sleeping in this, it is going to be a
  pretty easy matter to communicate. If you're down in the basement and you get
  a spook visitor, you haven't got a hundred to one chance of raising a holler!
  All you need do, if you hear anything, is to knock on that wall, either with
  your fist or a hammer or a mallet. I want you to go upstairs to the room at
  once, knock, and I'll discover if I can hear you. Come out on to the balcony
  after."</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't be any good, sir. All these walls are as thick as the
  length of my arm."</p>

  <p>"This may be an exception."</p>

  <p>Larkin, the caretaker, agreed to make the experiment, and Dick waited.
  Eventually he heard only the faintest of sounds, and then went out on to the
  balcony.</p>

  <p>"I hit it with a boot heel; did you hear, Mr. Staines?"</p>

  <p>Dick had to confess that it was not the kind of knock that would have
  wakened him from sleep.</p>

  <p>"Wait here," he said. He rang for the butler. "Have you anything like a
  portable electric bell in the house?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, we have one that his lordship uses to communicate with his
  valet."</p>

  <p>"Bring it along."</p>

  <p>The butler came back with a polished wooden case and a long coil of flex,
  terminating in a bell-push.</p>

  <p>Dick went out on the balcony and gave particulars of his plan.</p>

  <p>"It is warm enough to leave your window open. I'll keep the bell in my
  room; you have the bell-push in yours, and fix it so that you can reach it
  without getting out of bed."</p>

  <p>Larkin apparently was sleeping on a camp bedstead. He had no difficulty in
  moving his lodgings, and he was rather pleased to be near what he called
  'company'; the only fly in the ointment being that he had to go down through
  the dark house every time he wanted refreshment.</p>

  <p>"You needn't use this room till the last thing at night, and when you go
  to bed like a Christian man to sleep. Does your door lock?"</p>

  <p>The caretaker disappeared and returned to the balcony with the assurance
  that it both locked and bolted. The cord was trailed across from balcony to
  balcony and led into the man's new sleeping place. Dick put the business end
  of the apparatus by the side of his bed.</p>

  <p>The night brought no new adventure. He strolled out on the balcony in the
  early hours of the morning, to find Larkin smoking his first pipe of the
  day.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, nothing happened. I've been wondering whether that skylight
  upstairs is quite safe. So far as I can see it isn't fastened, and can't
  be."</p>

  <p>Dick swung himself over to the other balcony and followed the man into the
  room. From the landing led a narrow staircase, which ended in a doorless
  lobby. Looking up, he saw a ladder suspended horizontally and apparently by
  counterweights. It was a very ordinary type of fire-escape. He pulled a
  thick, short rope, and the ladder end came down, and, at the same time, the
  skylight above opened automatically. Climbing up on the roof he closed the
  glass trap. The ladder came up as the frame of the skylight sank into its
  supports. There was no difficulty in opening it from the outside. The roof
  was a flat surface, cut into sections by brick chimney supports. A little way
  along he came to another skylight&mdash;leading down, he supposed, to Weald's
  house. This was similarly equipped, and could be opened from the outside. The
  next house rose a story higher, but there was an iron ladder down which
  fugitives from fire could climb to the flat roof.</p>

  <p>He went back to Larkin with a reassuring report.</p>

  <p>"I don't think our friends will or can enter this way," he said; but he
  was glad that he had made the inspection. Later his reconnaissance was to
  render him good service.</p>

  <p>He half expected that Lordy Brown would be a visitor next door, and he had
  left word with Larkin that if the man came he was to be sent for. Lordy he
  was to meet by accident.</p>

  <p>That afternoon Dick was hurrying along Piccadilly to meet Bourke, with
  whom he had an appointment. He had come by cab as far as Berkeley Street, but
  the traffic block was so thick and immovable that he had decided to pay off
  his taxi and continue the journey on foot.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch; it was five minutes after the appointed time, and
  he stepped into a hosier's store, where he was known, and called up Bourke,
  to learn that he was out and had left a message postponing the appointment. A
  little relieved, Dick came out into Piccadilly and continued his stroll
  towards the Circus at a more leisurely pace.</p>

  <p>He was a Londoner by birth and preference; its noises were the sweetest of
  sounds to his ears, its tarry fragrance more lovely than the scent of
  gardens. Dick Staines was something of a dreamer; he liked to let his
  imagination run out of hand, to picture the life of this and that chance-seen
  man and woman, and speculate upon the interests which sent them hurrying like
  tired ants from one task to another.</p>

  <p>Coming to a halt where Piccadilly joins the busy Circus, he stood on the
  kerb, his hands clasped behind him, surveying the traffic tangle which two
  bored policemen were unravelling.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, Mr. Staines, this is a pleasure, I'm sure!"</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel and had an impression of a long, narrow face, a fair
  of pale blue eyes, and an irregular mouth that was twisted in a smile.
  Otherwise he might not have recognised Lordy Brown in his new grey cashmere
  suit that did not quite fit, and which left an impression, justified as it
  happened, that it had been purchased ready to wear. From his waistcoat
  dangled a thick gold watch-chain; on his finger was a ring with a glittering
  stone&mdash;he was a different man from the rather shabby individual Dick had
  left outside the Piccadilly cafe.</p>

  <p>"Seeing the sights?" Mr. Brown's tone was rather patronising. "This is a
  queer little burg, but you and me are nobody in it! Give me a little place
  where you're a big man. I remember when I was in Geelong&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're dressed to kill, Brown. Have you had a good 'touch'?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Brown gave his sideways grin.</p>

  <p>"Me? No. I've got a little bit of money put by, and I had a letter from
  Africa this morning with some dividends. I've got two or three blocks of
  shares which bring me in a pound or two."</p>

  <p>He took a cigar-case, very new and shining and gold-bound, from his inside
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, I don't smoke," said Dick, rejecting the offer. "Not those
  kinds of cigar, at any rate."</p>

  <p>Lordy Brown bit off the end of a cigar and lit it. "Come and have a
  drink?"</p>

  <p>Dick's first inclination was to refuse, but he was curious to know
  something more of this stranger who had blown into his orbit.</p>

  <p>"I'll have a cup of tea with you."</p>

  <p>"Tea's mine, too," said Lordy. "Liquor at this time of the day is immoral
  and disgusting. At night, yes. A man like myself that can drink any two men
  under the table prefers to have his pleasures when business is done."</p>

  <p>They walked across the road in the direction of a large café in Coventry
  Street, and Brown expounded his philosophy. He believed that to the 'good
  feller' fortune comes as naturally as the rain from heaven. He was a 'good
  feller,' and therefore entitled to all the benefits which the more erratic
  gods disposed so indiscriminately.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Mr. Derrick?" asked Dick, when they were seated in the cafe
  and had given their order.</p>

  <p>"Him?" Lordy Brown smiled contemptuously. "He wouldn't see me. He's not in
  Town, is he? In the country&mdash;Keyley&mdash;that's the name of the
  house."</p>

  <p>"You've been there, have you?" asked Dick, interested.</p>

  <p>"Went yesterday. Matter of fact, I saw you comin' away on the road. I sent
  a message in to him; he told me he was busy and that he'd see me in Town. Is
  that the kind of friendship you'd expect from a man whose life you saved?
  There's no gratitude in this world, Mr. Staines."</p>

  <p>"You didn't see him, then?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him, but he didn't see me," corrected Lordy. "That fellow hasn't
  changed a bit. I can see him laying there in the bush with the lions chawing
  bits out of him as if it was yesterday! But I'm not the sort of man who
  forces myself on anybody. I'm no cadger. You ask anybody who knows Lordy
  Brown, and they'll tell you that he's a good feller who'll take a liberty
  with nobody."</p>

  <p>Dick smiled.</p>

  <p>"And you don't think Mr. Walter Derrick is a good fellow?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, he is," said the other quickly. "I'm broad-minded myself. Ask
  anybody in Africa, and they'll tell you that there ain't a broader-minded man
  on either side of the Tuli River. Mr. Derrick was right&mdash;he's a business
  gentleman and he doesn't want anybody barging in on him when he's got
  company&mdash;a lord, they tell me. My own idea is that they didn't give him
  my name properly. You see, Mr. Staines, I make excuses for people, even when
  they treat me like dirt. He's a very good feller, and I remember him as well
  as if it was yesterday."</p>

  <p>He pulled a gaudy handkerchief out of his trousers pocket, and
  incidentally dropped a bundle of notes on the floor, which he hastily
  retrieved.</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to want his help now. Your dividends seem to have been
  pretty extensive."</p>

  <p>"The dividends are all right, the stock's good&mdash;I've got enough to
  live on. I don't want any man's charity." He was looking steadily at Dick as
  he spoke. "I shouldn't be surprised if he'd offered me a hundred pounds. But
  I wouldn't take it. I'd say 'No, thank you. I never take money for saving a
  man's life.' I'm like that, Mr. Staines."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have thought it," said Dick, and Lordy chuckled.</p>

  <p>He became serious immediately.</p>

  <p>"You remember that de Villiers girl I saw, or thought I saw&mdash;Miss
  What's-her-name? She's at Bognor&mdash;a nurse, looking after an old
  gent."</p>

  <p>"How did you know?" asked Dick in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Because I saw her when I went to Bognor in a charabanc. She's a stunner!"
  He smacked his lips. "She's the dead image of a girl I knew in Africa. You'd
  think they was twins."</p>

  <p>He said he thought of building a house in Bognor. He was buying a little
  car to get about.'</p>

  <p>"What is it&mdash;just plain burglary, or have you 'caught' somebody for a
  lot of money?"</p>

  <p>Lordy Brown turned pained eyes upon the questioner.</p>

  <p>"If there's anything straighter than me in London it must be a foot-rule,"
  he said. "I can afford to be straight."</p>

  <p>"And yet you are hoping that Mr. Derrick will express his gratitude in the
  usual way?"</p>

  <p>Lordy Brown smiled pityingly.</p>

  <p>"Him! I wouldn't get a dog-biscuit! That's the worst of these fellers when
  they get on, they forget their old pals&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How long did you know him?" interrupted Dick.</p>

  <p>"About four days," said the other calmly, "but that's quite long enough
  for me. I'm a quick friend-maker. No," he went on, "all the tropic dreams, as
  the poet says, have gone west. There's no pickings from Derrick. By all
  accounts his father was a miser. It takes a long time to breed out a vice
  from a horse, and men are worse. At the same time "&mdash;he looked past Dick
  stolidly&mdash;"I might make a bit out of him on the side. The world, as W.
  Shakespeare said, is my oyster."</p>

  <p>Dick smiled unpleasantly, called the waiter, and paid for the
  tea&mdash;Mr. Brown protesting. As they walked out of the shop, he turned to
  his disreputable companion:</p>

  <p>"The man who opens oysters in this town is opening the door to Cell 94.
  You might remember that, Brown."</p>

  <p>"I forget nothing," said Lordy Brown, in no wise abashed by the
  threat.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DICK went back to the house soon after this, and interviewed
  Larkin, the caretaker, on Derrick's doorstep.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, nothing to report; nobody's been here."</p>

  <p>"You haven't had a telephone message telling you to go to Timbuctoo?"
  asked Dick.</p>

  <p>The man smiled.</p>

  <p>"That won't happen again, sir. Mr. Derrick has arranged a code word. I
  don't take any orders unless that is used."</p>

  <p>"A most admirable idea," said Dick&mdash;"I suggested it."</p>

  <p>Staines noticed that from time to time the man glanced apprehensively over
  his shoulder into the house.</p>

  <p>"Is the ghost walking?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; I'm a bit nervous, that's all."</p>

  <p>Evidently he was not greatly pleased with the prospect of sleeping there
  another night. Before dinner Dick took out Tommy Weald's little car for a
  drive, and again admired the mechanism which allowed the door to open
  automatically.</p>

  <p>From the outside, even in daylight, Tommy's garage had a churchy
  appearance. Some parts of the little building were very old; there was, for
  example, a Gothic finial above a V-shaped arch that was crumbling with age.
  He was mildly interested, for Tommy was by no means ecclesiastically minded.
  The garage was probably in existence before he had bought the house.</p>

  <p>The car behaved splendidly. He took it as far as Scotland Yard on the
  chance of seeing Bourke, and brought it back by a long detour through South
  London. He was nearing a popular tube station when he saw a girl walking on
  the near sidewalk, and for a moment thought he recognised her. As he passed
  he turned his head. Now he was sure. He put down his brake and brought the
  car to a standstill. When he looked round she had disappeared; the entrance
  of the tube station had apparently swallowed her up, though he could have
  sworn she had passed the station entrance when he saw her.</p>

  <p>Mary Dane, and yet not Mary Dane. She was getting on his mind; had become
  part of an obsession.</p>

  <p>He began to take stock of himself. In what respect did this girl differ
  from a hundred other pretty girls he met or knew? She was no prettier than A,
  no more intelligent than B. He had to come back again and again to an old and
  overworked word which he loathed. She was an affinity; they turned to one
  another, or at least he turned to her. The first time he spoke to her he knew
  her, and there had been an immediate establishment of sympathy. Was that what
  people called falling in love? If it were so, it was likely to prove a fatal
  experience for himself.</p>

  <p>When he got back to the house he had an inspiration. He knew where she was
  staying in Bognor; by good fortune he remembered the name of the landlord.
  The house was connected by telephone: he had seen a line that led to the
  house. He put through a call to the Bognor 'Inquiry,' and, after a very short
  delay, was talking to the supervisor. She told him she would switch him
  through, and in a minute he heard a man's voice at the other end of the wire,
  and guessed it was the landlord of the lodging-house.</p>

  <p>"Can I speak to Nurse Mary Dane?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether she's in," said the voice. "I'll send up and
  inquire."</p>

  <p>Dick waited with nervous anxiety, and then:</p>

  <p>"Yes ...? Do you want to speak to me?"</p>

  <p>"Is that Miss Dane? ... Inspector Staines speaking," he said eagerly.</p>

  <p>The girl at the end of the wire laughed.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Are you sure you want me or your friend? If you want him I can call
  him in. He is sitting outside the house at this moment."</p>

  <p>"Tommy?"</p>

  <p>"Tommy," she repeated. "He is the most persistent Tommy I have ever met.
  Did you want to speak to me?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;yes." Dick hesitated, and floundered a little. "I wanted to ask
  you if&mdash;er&mdash;if you were in Town this morning ... I thought I saw
  you," he said mendaciously.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Staines!" The mock reproach in her voice made him grin. "You're
  always seeing things! What a dull life yours must be!"</p>

  <p>And then she hung up on him, and left him feeling like a spanked child. He
  exchanged a few words with Larkin across the balconies.</p>

  <p>The man was almost cheerful.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I shall be ringing you up to-night, sir," he said. "These
  burglars are not coming back."</p>

  <p>Most fervently Dick hoped not, for he was a tired man for some
  unaccountable reason.</p>

  <p>He undressed, and was in bed by half-past eleven, after again saying
  good-night from the balcony to Mr. Derrick's guardian. It was the butler's
  knock on the door that woke him up. It was broad daylight, and the sun was
  pouring through the windows.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, sir." The man put down his small tea-tray. "I hope you have
  had a good night?"</p>

  <p>Dick yawned.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a very good night," he said.</p>

  <p>"The bell didn't ring?" smiled the butler.</p>

  <p>Dick had told him the night it was fixed not to be alarmed if he heard
  this loud-sounding instrument.</p>

  <p>"No, we had a very good night indeed, the caretaker and I."</p>

  <p>"He's sleeping late. I noticed, when I went to the door to take in the
  letters, his milk bottle was still in the doorway. Usually he's up by
  six."</p>

  <p>Dick Staines was not tremendously interested in the domestic affairs of
  caretakers, and found a very simple explanation.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be surprised if it wasn't the first comfortable night's sleep
  he's had for weeks," he said.</p>

  <p>He slipped into his dressing-gown and stepped out on to the balcony. The
  first thing he saw was the green bell cord&mdash;the wires had been carefully
  separated and neatly cut through.</p>

  <p>He went back to his room, dressed hurriedly, and astonished passers-by in
  the street were thrilled by the spectacle of an athletic man swinging from
  one balcony to another. He stepped into the converted bedroom. The bed was
  there, but it had not been slept in. The door was wide open. On a small,
  nearby table was a large-faced silver watch; evidently the caretaker had put
  it down before retiring. On the floor, near to where the hand of the sleeper
  would be, was the revolver.</p>

  <p>He went to the door and called the man by name. There was no answer, and
  his words came echoing up to him. Dick went down the stairs slowly, stopping
  at each landing to test the doors. They were locked, all except the front
  drawing-room, which was wide open. The blinds were drawn; the room was in
  darkness. Dick drew back the curtains and let the shades run up. He was
  conscious of a peculiar acrid smell which he could not locate. The room he
  had seen before: the furniture had been hidden under linen covers. Now
  somebody had drawn off the sheeting of two chairs, and they faced one another
  as though they had been occupied by two people engaged in a long and intimate
  talk. The dust sheets had been thrown negligently near the fireplace,
  evidently on a rolled-up rug from its shape ... a rolled-up rug? Dick looked at
  it again. He saw the tip of a brown boot ...</p>

  <p>In two strides he was across the room, and had drawn the sheet clear of
  the thing it hid. A man lay there, his thin face set in a grin. He was dead
  and stark. There was blood on his neck and on his waistcoat. The hands folded
  across the breast were clenched.</p>

  <p>"Lordy Brown!" said Dick gently. "How did you get here, you poor
  devil?"</p>

  <p>He drew back the coat, and then he saw something which made him gasp.
  Skilful hands had tried to bandage that wound: a white piece of sheeting had
  been drawn tightly round, a pad had been made from the same material, and it
  had been pinned scientifically; and, in the haste of departure, the little
  surgical pin case had been left behind&mdash;a thin leather folder of
  surgical needles and a tube of iodine, unbroken. He picked it up and examined
  it; there was a tiny pocket, and inside a plain white card, on which was
  scribbled:</p><br>

  <p class="cp">"<i>From R. D. to M. D. (Daddy wishes Mary a Happy Christmas.
  1923)</i>."</p><br>

  <p>"M. D.?" repeated Dick Staines.</p>

  <p>It was a common set of initials ... It might not be Mary Dane after all.</p>

  <p>There was a telephone in the hall. Dick put through a message to Scotland
  Yard and found that Bourke had either arrived or hadn't departed.</p>

  <p>"I'll be along in a few minutes. You'd better search the rest of the
  house."</p>

  <p>Dick went down to the basement. There was no sign of the caretaker. He had
  evidently taken an evening meal before he went up to bed; the remains were
  still on the table. The doors were locked; there was, as he said, neither
  bolt nor chain fastened on the front door.</p>

  <p>By the time he had finished his search, the police car was at the front of
  the house, and Bourke and three assistants came up to the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Was he dead when you found him?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"Who bandaged him?"</p>

  <p>"That is what I'd like to know."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said Bourke, pursing his lips thoughtfully. "It looks as if he
  was shot." He sniffed. "I smelt cordite when I came in&mdash;didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!&mdash;that is what I smelt!" said Dick.</p>

  <p>"Until the doctor arrives we shan't be able to tell exactly how he was
  killed. This is the man Brown, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>He made a superficial search of the body, without moving its position.
  Nothing was revealed, except that Lordy Brown had evidently had several
  addresses since he came to England. There were no documents to indicate a
  reason for his presence; no keys or tools by which he might have gained
  admission.</p>

  <p>After the doctor had gone, and whilst the ambulance was waiting at the
  door, surrounded by curious sightseers, they made a further and a more
  thorough search. In Lordy's right hip pocket was a fully loaded Browning
  automatic. The important discovery was when they searched the right hip
  pocket. Here they found a folded slip of paper on which was scribbled in
  pencil:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Hyde Park&mdash;maggasine&mdash;bridge green
  light&mdash;left&mdash;eleven-thirty&mdash;quarter to twelve&mdash;Mr.
  Pinkey."</p>

  <p>"You're a bit of a mystery merchant, Staines. You ought to read that
  puzzle as though it were in print!"</p>

  <p>Dick read the lines again.</p>

  <p>"I'll make a copy and hand the original to the Yard."</p>

  <p>He put it in his pocket, and helped to place this poor wreck of a man upon
  a stretcher which the ambulance men had brought.</p>

  <p>"Does Mr. Derrick know about this affair?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," said Dick, shaking his head. "I was going to get through to
  him, but I thought I'd better wait until you came."</p>

  <p>"Tell him," said Bourke laconically, and went upstairs to the caretaker's
  temporary bedroom.</p>

  <p>Dick called a number, when he heard Bourke's voice in his ears.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," said the Superintendent. "There's an extension phone in
  the office up here, and I was just trying it out."</p>

  <p>He was still speaking when Derrick's voice was heard.</p>

  <p>"Can you come up? It's rather urgent," said Dick. "Do you remember my
  talking to you about a man called Brown?"</p>

  <p>"Lordy Brown&mdash;yes. He was about here yesterday, somebody told me. He
  sent a message in by one of my servants saying he wanted to see me, and why
  on earth he shouldn't have come to the house I don't know. When I sent out to
  bring him in he was gone. Is he in any kind of trouble? The impression I got
  from my man was that he was tight."</p>

  <p>"He's out of all his trouble," said Dick quietly. "He's dead."</p>

  <p>"Dead?" Derrick's voice was horrified, incredulous. "Has he met with an
  accident&mdash;when did it happen?"</p>

  <p>"Last night ..." A pause. "In your drawing room."</p>

  <p>He heard an exclamation at the other end of the wire.</p>

  <p>"You're not joking&mdash;did he try to break into the house? You remember,
  I had my suspicions?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what he tried to do. He was in the house and he was
  shot."</p>

  <p>Another long silence.</p>

  <p>"What does the caretaker say? Did he do the shooting? He had a
  revolver."</p>

  <p>"Your caretaker has vanished from the face of the earth," Dick said.</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;I'll be up as soon as I possibly can."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where the caretaker is likely to be found?"</p>

  <p>"I don't. I'm too bewildered even to think of his address."</p>

  <p>"Bring Tommy with you," said Dick, but Mr. Derrick had rung off.</p>

  <p>Bourke came downstairs at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Did you find anything at all in your first search of the room?"</p>

  <p>Only for a second did Dick hesitate, and then, putting his hand in his
  waistcoat pocket, took out the little nursing case.</p>

  <p>"Somebody bandaged him up; evidently a trained nurse."</p>

  <p>"I noticed that," said Bourke.</p>

  <p>He opened the case with an interested frown, put his two fingers in the
  pocket, but brought out no card. That was the one piece of evidence that
  Inspector Richard Staines did not pass to his superior. Why he didn't, he
  could not for the life of him understand. Yet nine men out of ten, and ten
  women out of ten, could have explained his dereliction of duty in the
  simplest possible terms.</p>

  <p>Dick went back to Weald's house and had a bath and changed, and ate a
  hasty breakfast. By the time he was presentable, the first clue came in. It
  was from the caterer of a cab shelter who had been on duty in the early night
  and was sitting in the entrance of the shelter talking to a cabman when he
  had seen the caretaker, whom he knew, come hurriedly across the street. The
  driver of the first cab on the rank was having his supper. He took the second
  and drove to King's Cross Station. He said he had to catch a midnight train
  to the north.</p>

  <p>The keeper of the shelter knew him to speak to. Apparently, on some
  nights, Larkin was in the habit of coming over to the shelter for supper and
  a chat. He was sometimes there for as long as two hours, and was always loth
  to return to the deserted house.</p>

  <p>"Which convicts him of perjury," said Bourke. "He told Mr. Derrick that he
  never left the building in any circumstances. Has Derrick arrived?"</p>

  <p>They were talking in the hall of Weald's house.</p>

  <p>"He's just turned up. He's terribly upset&mdash;not exactly upset, but
  he's baffled."</p>

  <p>"The difference between him and us, Richard, is that he shows it and we
  don't."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DICK went into the house, and found Derrick walking up and
  down the shrouded drawing-room where the tragedy had been discovered. He was
  in golfing kit, and apparently when Dick had called him he was on his way to
  the links.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't tell Weald anything, but he's coming up to-day. What is your
  theory, Staines?" Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have three," he said, "all so ludicrously improbable that I can't risk
  my reputation for intelligence by telling you one. Nothing has been touched,
  so far as I can see, but it is evident that more persons than one were in
  this house last night."</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that?" asked Derrick quickly.</p>

  <p>Bourke saved his subordinate the necessity for replying.</p>

  <p>"Obviously," he said, in his gruff way, "the man who shot Lordy Brown was
  not the same man who tried to save his life&mdash;we found him with a big
  bandage round his chest."</p>

  <p>Derrick looked at him, stupefied.</p>

  <p>"Where was he?"</p>

  <p>Bourke pointed to the exact spot.</p>

  <p>"He had a cushion under his head and he was covered with a dust cloth," he
  said. "Staines, when he saw him, thought it was a roll of carpet or something
  of the sort."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" Derrick's face was pale and strained, and in his eyes was a
  great bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it," he said jerkily. "More people than one ... here!
  What were they 'doing ...? It is awful ... I don't know what I'm talking about
  or what I'm doing. I had a feeling something terrible was going to happen.
  I slept badly last night and had dreams. It must have been your talk of
  ghosts. Has the ghost been recognised? Who was it?" he asked, when he saw
  Dick's expression.</p>

  <p>"According to Larkin, it was your father." Derrick's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"My father?" He almost squeaked the words. "It is incredible ... Who said
  this&mdash;Larkin? Larkin's a fool. The man's full of fears and ridiculous
  fancies." He wiped his wet face. "Did he describe
  him&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;ghost, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"Larkin, you mean? Oh yes, he gave a very lucid and faithful description.
  He said that he had seen your father many years before, and recognised him
  instantly&mdash;partly, I think, by his limp."</p>

  <p>"By his limp," repeated Derrick. And then, quickly: "But anybody could
  limp. That would make it easier for some brute to impersonate him. How
  horrible!" And then, in a more angry tone: "Ghost: I'd like to see that
  ghost. There's nothing living or dead that's ever scared me. Why didn't the
  fool tell me? I'd have been up and laid that spook for good."</p>

  <p>He spun round on Bourke.</p>

  <p>"Now what am I to do, Superintendent? How long is this intolerable
  nuisance to continue? I'm a perfectly law-abiding man. So far as I know, I've
  done no person the slightest injury. If there's gold in this house that they
  want to find, by God, I'll give them the run of the house if they'll only
  come forward! Let them find it and have done with it. I'd put an
  advertisement in the newspaper to that effect," he said with a little laugh,
  "only I should have Lowndes Square crowded with all the treasure-seekers in
  the world, and my house torn to ribbons! I don't know what you're going to
  do, Superintendent, but I know what I shall do. I'm going abroad. I'm
  withdrawing my caretaker&mdash;a cursed lot of use he is to me&mdash;and I'm
  giving the ghosts and the gold-chasers a free hand to walk where they
  will."</p>

  <p>"Do you think Lordy Brown came into either category?" asked Bourke.</p>

  <p>The other shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I have a suspicion that he knew something about these
  burglaries. From what I remember of him and his record, burglary was not
  outside his sphere of operations. But I don't know ... I'm too confounded to
  form even a theory. There is the fact: he was found dead in my drawing-room,
  shot, my caretaker has disappeared!"</p>

  <p>The door opened and a detective-sergeant came in quickly.</p>

  <p>"The Yard have just phoned me that Larkin has been found in Liverpool. He
  went there by the midnight train."</p>

  <p>"Has he been arrested?" asked Derrick.</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>The sergeant lowered his voice and said something to Bourke in an
  undertone, and the Superintendent nodded.</p>

  <p>"This officer says that the story Larkin tells is that you called him up
  at half-past eleven and told him to catch the midnight train to Liverpool, go
  to an hotel and wait for you to arrive in the morning. He said you had a code
  word."</p>

  <p>Derrick nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is right&mdash;'Peterborough' was the code word. I used it because
  this sort of telephone trick has been worked before."</p>

  <p>"The code word was used, and Larkin went out of the house
  immediately."</p>

  <p>Derrick bit his lip thoughtfully, and his eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"That's curious. How could they know ?"</p>

  <p>"Who knew the code word besides you?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>Derrick shook his head.</p>

  <p>I don't know ... nobody, unless I've murmured it in my sleep. As I sleep
  alone "&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;" I'm beat!"</p>

  <p>"You did not give these instructions to Larkin?" asked Bourke.</p>

  <p>Derrick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth should I ask this man to go to Liverpool? What business have
  I there? Obviously, somebody wanted him out of the road, and that somebody
  was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He looked at Dick, and an odd expression came to his face. Dick thought it
  went a little paler, a little more haggard.</p>

  <p>"There was somebody else in the house&mdash;you said so. They may have
  been there all the time; they may have been on the 'phone."</p>

  <p>"And," said Bourke slowly, "they could easily have telephoned from the
  ground floor instrument and called up Larkin on the extension. Now, Mr.
  Derrick, I wonder if you'd give me a few seconds with Staines?"</p>

  <p>"Have the whole house, my good fellow," said Derrick, once more his genial
  self.</p>

  <p>There was a little table standing in the middle of the drawing-room. Dick
  seemed to remember that when he first came in it was uncovered; when he
  returned after Bourke's inspection he had found a light cloth laid over it
  and the empty flower vase, which had stood there, removed.</p>

  <p>"Take a look at this." Bourke lifted the cloth gently. "Drop your head
  sideways against the light&mdash;now. Do you see it?"</p>

  <p>Dick saw it very distinctly: a thumb-print&mdash;a thumb-print he knew by
  heart. The print of the Slough murderer!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DICK personally undertook the investigation into Lordy
  Brown's movements. He had been living at an hotel in Norfolk Street,
  occupying one of the cheapest bedrooms at the top of the house. The night
  porter, with whom Brown had worked up some kind of friendship&mdash;he was in
  the habit of sitting on the steps in the early hours of the morning smoking a
  cigar and discussing his adventures&mdash;told the detective very little
  about the man that he did not already know.</p>

  <p>Brown liked to describe his hairbreadth escapes from death, his tremendous
  travels, and the wonderful mines he had discovered and out of which he had
  been cheated.</p>

  <p>"He told you nothing about his friends?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; he told me that he once saved a gentleman who was being eaten by
  lions. He told me that the night before last. He said he was going to be a
  very rich man and he'd take me as his valet&mdash;not that I paid much
  attention because I've heard that sort of thing before. When a gentleman gets
  a little drink in him, the first thing he seems to think about is to give me
  a job as valet and take me round the world. But he was a very pleasant man,
  and some of his adventures were very interesting. He had met a few tough
  cases, too, according to him."</p>

  <p>"What time did he go out last night?"</p>

  <p>"About ten, sir&mdash;maybe a little after. He stopped to speak to me in
  the hall as he went out."</p>

  <p>"Had he a visitor?"</p>

  <p>The porter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir; he had a long telephone talk with somebody about half-past nine.
  It was from a call office&mdash;I happen to know that because I answered the
  'phone."</p>

  <p>"Was it a man or woman who called him up?"</p>

  <p>"A man, sir. He had rather a common voice. He said he wanted to speak to
  Mr. Brown very urgently. It must have been something important, because Mr.
  Brown came out and asked me to lend him a sheet of paper and a pencil. I saw
  him through the glass window of the booth writing something down."</p>

  <p>Dick took from his note-case the paper which had been found in Lordy
  Brown's pocket.</p>

  <p>"Is this it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man examined and felt the texture of the paper.</p>

  <p>"That's it, sir. It's half a sheet of the hotel notepaper. I took it from
  the writing table."</p>

  <p>This document which Lordy had scribbled was obviously written in a hurry,
  and was as obviously a telephone conversation. He read it again.</p>

  <p>"Hyde Park&mdash;maggasine&mdash;bridge green
  light&mdash;left&mdash;eleven-thirty&mdash;quarter to twelve&mdash;Mr.
  Pinkey."</p>

  <p>Brown had to meet the unknown in Hyde Park near to the bridge, probably
  between these two. The writer would come along in a car and would show a
  green light to identify himself between the hours of 11.30 and 11.45. Mr.
  Pinkey? Who was Mr. Pinkey? It might mean anything; it might mean the name by
  which the unknown would reveal himself&mdash;or herself.</p>

  <p>Dick made a very careful search of the bedroom which the dead man had
  occupied. One of the things that had puzzled him was that no money had been
  found in Brown's pocket, except a few shillings and a crumpled ten-shilling
  note. The packet of bank-notes that Dick had seen at the cafe had not been
  found. There was a bare possibility it was in the room, though it seemed very
  unlikely that Brown would leave a large sum of money so insecure. But unless
  he had banked the money, this was the only place, for the cashier who
  received guests' valuables for safe custody had nothing at all in the
  strong-room belonging to Lordy Brown.</p>

  <p>The room was a small one, comfortably furnished. Dick stripped the bed,
  turned over the mattress, and searched first the drawers and then the
  battered Gladstone bag which constituted Lordy's luggage, without finding
  either the notes or any document which would give a clue to its disposal.</p>

  <p>He did discover an old notebook which the man had used for a variety of
  purposes. Here were addresses, mostly in Africa, odd scraps of memoranda that
  one might find in an engagement book, a few notes about particulars of a
  prospector's certificate, and a reference to what seemed to be the contents
  of a shop, possibly the result of a burglary, for at the bottom was
  written:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'Worth £2,800. J. paid 120.' J. was likely enough the
  unknown receiver.</p><br>

  <p>Dick's examination of the book could only be a hurried and casual one. He
  put it in his pocket and continued his search for the money. He found a
  long-barrelled Colt revolver, the lock of which was broken, and a third-class
  return ticket from Capetown to Wynberg, which was rather surprising, for in
  the Cape only the poorest of whites and the native people travel
  third-class.</p>

  <p>There was a cardboard folder at the bottom of the bag, on which was
  printed the name of the Union Castle Company. It was the sort of thing that
  is given to passengers to carry their tickets. Inside he found the tattered
  half of a letter which was written in a woman's illiterate handwriting. It
  was complaining about the difficulty of getting money and the 'disgrace.'
  What the disgrace was the writer did not particularise.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"You always say you don't remember the children's birthday.
  That's like you. You never remember anything except what you want yourself.
  If I'd only kept to my shop work I'd have been better off. Try and not forget
  next time. The children expect to hear from you, and I'm tired of telling
  them that you're up country when you're doing time or God know's what.
  Mabel's birthday is the 14th of April, Jinny's is the 7th of July, and little
  Freddie's is the 13th of December. I hope you won't forget. I meant to tell
  you that that girl de Villiers&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>The letter ended here. Evidently there had been another sheet, which Brown
  had destroyed, retaining this as a memorandum of his children's birthdays.
  "That girl de Villiers ...?"</p>

  <p>The first time they had met, Lordy Brown had mistaken Mary for her.</p>

  <p>He turned the cardboard cover inside out, hoping to find the rest of the
  letter which would tell him just what part that girl de Villiers played in
  his tempestuous life.</p>

  <p>The brief reference alone suggested an antagonism to the mysterious Miss
  de Villiers.</p>

  <p>There was nothing else of any moment. Most of the clothing was new, and
  from the bills he found Lordy Brown must have made extensive purchases on the
  strength of his 'dividends.' The scrap of letter, which he took away with
  him, unfortunately bore no address or date, and only the letters 'C. T.' at
  the start indicated its origin. He did not even know under what pseudonym
  Mrs. Lordy Brown lived. A slender foundation, all this, for further
  inquiries. Here were the facts that he brought to Bourke.</p>

  <p>"Lordy Brown received a telephone message between nine and ten o'clock the
  previous evening from a London call office, and evidently the caller had made
  an appointment. He was to be picked up in Hyde Park." How did he come to be
  in Derrick's house? Was it some mysterious person, some enemy of Derrick's,
  one of the gold-seeking gang, who was using him as a cat's-paw? And was the
  object of the meeting to employ his services?</p>

  <p>Lordy Brown was an expert burglar, amongst other things. He had been
  concerned in a bank robbery in Pretoria, and the answer to an inquiry which
  had been sent to the South African police had stated explicitly 'expert
  safe-breaker.'</p>

  <p>"There is, of course, a possibility, which we can't overlook, that Brown
  accepted the commission either to break into Derrick's house, or, if he
  didn't break in&mdash;and there seems to be no sign that he did&mdash;to open
  this mythical safe of his," said Bourke. And when Dick opened his lips to
  speak: "Don't tell me that they hadn't found the safe, and that they'd hardly
  employ an expert 'buster' to punch holes in a safe they couldn't
  locate&mdash;I know that. The question is, did they expect that night to
  uncover old Derrick's hiding-place? If they did, and if Brown was employed
  for the purpose, you have to remember that he was also a blackmailer. The
  chances are that he used his position to try to make a little more money out
  of them than they had offered him, in which case the shooting may be a
  logical consequence. One thing is certain: there's a way into that house
  which nobody has discovered."</p>

  <p>"I'll try to find it," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"Find the people who are using it," suggested Bourke.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE first time Dick and Lord Weald were alone together was
  that evening. Tommy came up that afternoon without waiting for the breathing
  space he had promised. He travelled up at such a speed that he left behind
  him a trail of police summonses for exceeding the speed limit, but that was a
  normal experience of Tommy's. He was bursting with news.</p>

  <p>"My dear old thing, whom do you think I saw this morning? That dear little
  soul! Dick, she's marvellous! Going by car to London, and the jolly old pram
  strapped on to the top. Perfectly beautiful, old boy!"</p>

  <p>"I gather you're talking about Mary Dane?"</p>

  <p>"And the old codger. I'm afraid he'll soon be popping off, poor old bird!"
  Tommy shook his head with affected melancholy. "Perfectly ghastly for that
  poor little woman looking after a one-footer."</p>

  <p>"A what-er?" said Dick, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"One-footer. You know, old boy&mdash;one in the silent tomb and one on the
  daisies. She stopped the car. You wouldn't think it possible, old boy; she
  was most kind and gracious&mdash;recognised me in an instant. Didn't mention
  you, by the way," he dug Dick in the ribs playfully. "That's got your nanny
  goat! Didn't ask one single demnition question about Richard Staines! She's
  probably forgotten you. Girls do that sort of thing. But she remembered
  <i>me</i> all right, old boy. I had quite a long chat. The old gentleman was
  very talkative, too. I suppose I'm the greatest living authority upon his
  digestion! I'm seeing them all to-night." He avoided the stern gaze which was
  turned upon him.</p>

  <p>"You're never going down there pursuing that unhappy girl with your inane
  attentions? Why, you'll bleat her to death."</p>

  <p>Tommy's smile was very superior.</p>

  <p>"Green-eyed monster, old boy. Besides, I want a change."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were going to stay up here and be a little detective?"</p>

  <p>Tommy was a little uncomfortable at this.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," he said awkwardly. "Of course I did say something of the sort;
  but you can get on without me. Anything happened?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing but a murder, and that wouldn't interest you."</p>

  <p>"A what?" squeaked Tommy, and asked the inevitable question.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who did it, my dear fellow," said Dick wearily. "If I did, I
  should be something more than a mind-reader."</p>

  <p>"But where ... how? In this house, or Derrick's? By Jove! In his
  drawing-room, eh? That'll wipe the smile from his healthy old face! I wish
  I'd come up last night. I've never seen anybody murdered."</p>

  <p>"I'll get you a front seat for the next one," said Dick sourly. And then,
  realising the absurdity of the attitude, he laughed. "Do you know I'm
  frightfully jealous?"</p>

  <p>"I know you are, old boy." Tommy brushed an invisible speck of dust from
  his immaculate coat. "But all's fair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you say 'in love and war' I'll brain you," said Dick.</p>

  <p>Tommy was momentarily embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"Well, to tell you the truth, old boy, I went back to Bognor the night
  after you left&mdash;I dare say you'll think it was taking a low-down
  advantage, but I simply got bored with dear old Derrick&mdash;I hate
  billiards&mdash;and I popped over to get a breath of fresh air, and I had the
  best of luck. There she was sitting at an upstairs window of one of those
  ghastly boarding-houses, sewing ... knew me in a minute, old boy, and waved her
  hand. I'm not so sure she didn't kiss it, but it was a little dark and I
  don't want to flatter myself. Modesty's my long suit. I asked her to come
  down."</p>

  <p>"By semaphore?" demanded Dick.</p>

  <p>"Signs, old boy," said Tommy calmly. "It's very easy if you know the way.
  I just pointed to the bandstand, and beckoned her with my finger&mdash;you
  know what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"And how did the populace of Bognor enjoy this exhibition?" asked Dick
  pityingly.</p>

  <p>Tommy ignored the insult.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, she couldn't come. So I just hung around where she could see me;
  got a chair, sat on the front with my back to the sea&mdash;I sort of felt
  that she was comforted, if you understand, old boy. It's very nice to have a
  man around."</p>

  <p>Dick's heart was beating a little faster.</p>

  <p>"What time did you leave Bognor?" he asked carelessly.</p>

  <p>Tommy looked up at the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"About eleven o'clock. Well, as soon as she pulled the blinds down. I
  didn't exactly leave, I waited for an hour after that. You know, I thought
  she might possibly come out for a breather, old boy. The way they treat these
  nurses is simply abominable. They're slaves simply. When she didn't come
  out&mdash;that was about twelve&mdash;I toddled off, and she saw me. I
  spotted the blind being pulled back and she waved her hand to me. What do you
  think of that?"</p>

  <p>Dick drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that!" he said.</p>

  <p>Tommy seized him by the hand, his face shining with gratitude.</p>

  <p>"You're pleased about it, old boy? No ill feeling? I mean, I'd hate to cut
  you out, but in love, Dicky&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't give me your views on love or I shall be sick. Let us have a
  drink."</p>

  <p>Twelve o'clock ... she could not have reached London before two. The murder
  must have been committed, according to the doctor's view, not much after
  midnight, at the latest one o'clock.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Very few," said Tommy, "not like her, old boy, anyway. Here's luck!"</p>

  <p>At Tommy's request, and to satisfy his morbid curiosity, he took him over
  the Derrick household. Walter had gone back to Keyley before the arrival of
  Tommy Weald, and was unaware that his guest had left him.</p>

  <p>"I expect he will be terribly cut up," said Dick. "I should be. After all,
  you don't get a cheery devil round the house very often."</p>

  <p>Into the drawing-room Tommy could only just peep, for there were men very
  busy inside.</p>

  <p>"What are those photographers doing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Taking photographs," said Dick, and, rather unnecessarily as it happened,
  he pointed out a spot on the landing. "That's where the ghost was," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Tommy jumped.</p>

  <p>"Ghost?" he said uneasily. "I say, old man, not a ghost?"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to be scared about; it's not your ghost and not your
  house," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"It's next door," protested Tommy. "And, my dear old chap, if you have
  ever read anything about ghosts, you know they can walk through a brick wall
  just as easy as a baby can fall out of bed."</p>

  <p>He stared uneasily up the gloomy stairs.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I want to go any farther, old boy. Let's get back into the
  bright light of day." He tugged out his watch.</p>

  <p>"By Jingo! I've got half an hour to catch that train to Clacton."</p>

  <p>"You're never going?" said Dick accusatively.</p>

  <p>"I must, old boy. Stern sense of what-not. I've got an aunt there."</p>

  <p>"You've got no aunt in the Eastern Counties. Only a week ago you were
  thanking God for the fact."</p>

  <p>"She's moved there," said Tommy, rapidly and glibly. "Aunt Arabella.
  Terribly fussy old lady, pots of money, frightfully deaf, and all that sort
  of thing."</p>

  <p>He flew down the stairs, followed at a more leisurely rate by his
  companion. By the time Dick reached the house Tommy was on the point of
  leaving.</p>

  <p>He had, with great thoughtfulness, telephoned to his servant, asking him
  to pack certain linen.</p>

  <p>"But why go by train? You've got a car."</p>

  <p>"I'm having the car sent down. I like a train journey now and again, it
  breaks the monotony. You meet such fearfully interesting people. Besides
  which, it's democratic. If you go barging all over the country in a Rolls you
  never meet the Real People."</p>

  <p>With a limp shake of the hand, he followed his man to the waiting cab and
  was gone. Dick guessed that Miss Mary Dane was also a passenger by the
  two-something from Liverpool Street and that she had confided that fact to
  Tommy.</p>

  <p>Towards evening he had a conversation with Bourke in the latter's office
  at Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"I have marked you for this duty indefinitely, and I think you'd better
  stay on at Lord Weald's place&mdash;if he doesn't object. We're particularly
  interested in that ghost. What time does Larkin get back from Liverpool?"</p>

  <p>"Seven o'clock to-night," said Dick. "I've asked him to report to me.
  After he's through I'll send him on to you."</p>

  <p>"The thing I can't understand," said Bourke, "is why they cut the bell
  wire."</p>

  <p>Dick understood, he thought.</p>

  <p>"They were afraid Larkin might come back to the room and attract my
  attention by ringing the bell. You will probably find, when you ask him, that
  he did try to wake me up to tell me that he was going to Liverpool, but got
  no answer. If he did that! Why, of course! He must have heard the telephone
  bell ring and gone downstairs, not knowing that he could get through from the
  room in which he was sleeping. That was when the wire was cut, or soon
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"In which case," said Bourke, "the fake summons must have come from his
  own room. There's a lot of queer little things about this case that I don't
  understand. How did Lordy Brown get into the house, in the first place? We
  found no tools of any kind, no keys, no doors or windows were forced. If I
  got my ideas of police work out of novels, I should think there was a secret
  passage."</p>

  <p>"And there is," said Dick promptly; and when Bourke stared at him, "I'm
  telling you, Super, that there's a secret passage of some kind in that house!
  Old man Derrick, who rebuilt it, had all sorts of odd workmen, and he himself
  was a builder. The walls are so thick that it is possible. Another point: he
  was scared of fire. That is one of the reasons that the walls are so
  thick."</p>

  <p>"But why?" demanded Bourke. "Derrick was a mean old devil, but so far as
  one knows he kept within the law. He was not a receiver; he was in no fear of
  the police&mdash;why medieval secret passages, I ask you?"</p>

  <p>"He was afraid of fire; he was afraid of burglars; and for the last year
  of his life he was afraid of assassination," said Dick quietly. "That is the
  sort of mania which seizes very rich men who have lived meanly all their
  lives. It is quite possible that he had some way of escape in case he was
  attacked&mdash;though why anybody should attack him heaven only knows!"</p>

  <p>"I can give you one explanation," said Bourke after a moment's thought,
  "and it isn't complimentary to his memory. But I don't want to start you off
  on side trails. If you find a secret passage, then you'll find a reason for
  it. Consult Inspector Endred in your neighbourhood. He knows that house
  backwards."</p>

  <p>Dick Staines arranged to stay at Weald's house for (as Bourke put it) 'an
  indefinite period.' He went to his own flat to collect a few belongings and
  returned to Lowndes Square just before eight o'clock. The butler told him
  that Larkin had been to the house and wanted to see him.</p>

  <p>"Is he next door?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I believe, but I am not sure, that Mr. Derrick has given him the
  sack," said the butler.</p>

  <p>"Rather unfair," said Dick. "Send him up to me when he arrives."</p>

  <p>He had hardly spoken the words when he heard the front door bell ring, and
  a few minutes later the butler ushered in the crestfallen caretaker.</p>

  <p>There was in the butler's attitude a vast and brotherly sympathy. Mr.
  Minns was a well-built man, inclined to be plump. He gave Dick the impression
  that he was very much interested in everybody's affairs except his own.</p>

  <p>"This is very terrible news, sir, that Mr. Bourke tells me," he said. "I
  saw something on the newspaper bills about a man being murdered in the West
  End, but I never dreamt it was in our house."</p>

  <p>Minns, it seems, was wrong when he said that the man had been dismissed.
  He had been told to call at Lord Weald's house for a message, and the
  message, apparently, was more in the nature of a warning than an actual
  dismissal.</p>

  <p>"The only thing I haven't got to do, sir, is to sleep there at nights," he
  said with satisfaction. "I've to stay on duty till six at night. After that I
  lock up and I'm finished. Mr. Derrick is going abroad. You told him about the
  ghost, didn't you, sir?" He shook his head. "I wish you hadn't. I think the
  beer I drunk that night must have made me see wrong."</p>

  <p>Dick had not been idle since he arrived at the house. He had had a
  carpenter who had sawn off two lengths of thick planking and had fitted them
  so that they afforded a bridge between the two balconies. These were securely
  fixed by nightfall, and as he explained to Bourke, who came to dinner with
  him, he was not taking unnecessary risks. He confessed that he had never
  swung from balcony to balcony without feeling a sense of physical nausea.</p>

  <p>"If you live here long enough they'll let you put a gate there," said
  Bourke, and held his glass to the light. "Your lordly friend stocks a good
  port."</p>

  <p>"And the tragic thing is he doesn't know it from gooseberry wine," sighed
  Dick, and the sigh was not so much for Lord Weald's execrable taste in
  alcohol as to his juxtaposition to Nurse Mary Dane at that moment.</p>

  <p>After Bourke had gone he spent some little time adjusting the portable
  bell. The wires had been repaired, and now he stripped the bell-push and
  replaced it with two thin plates of copper shaped like a thin V. He waited
  till it was dark, and then he climbed into the next house and, lifting the
  carpet, placed his improvised detector near the door. There was a slight
  bulge in the carpet, but this would not be noticed in the dark. Satisfied
  with his work, he returned to his room. The night was cold, with occasional
  showers, but he made provision against rain. There was above each window a
  large sunblind, he discovered, and one of these he had lowered as soon as it
  was dark. The edge of it came down within a few inches of the balcony
  parapet, and turning off the lights in his room, he wrapped himself in an
  overcoat and settled down to his vigil.</p>

  <p>It was not a difficult house to watch. Behind was a high-walled courtyard
  containing a garage which had been built by Walter, but between the garage
  and the house there was no communication. From where he sat he commanded,
  too, an uninterrupted view of one side of the square. No car could pull up at
  or near the house without his seeing the passengers alight. By leaning over
  the edge of the balcony he could see Derrick's front door and the deep area
  beyond. The back of the house he left to chance, seeing no advantage in
  posting a man there.</p>

  <p>At half-past ten Minns came tip-toeing into his bedroom with hot coffee
  and sandwiches, and Dick thought he might for a moment forgo his watch. He
  returned to the room and, drawing the curtains, put on the light.</p>

  <p>"You don't know how glad the servants are, sir, that you're here," said
  the butler gratefully. "If this was a basement house you'd never get any of
  the girls to stay."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it a basement house?" said Dick in surprise.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. The ground floor is the bottom floor."</p>

  <p>"Has it no cellars?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Staines; the wine is kept in an outhouse leading off the kitchen.
  I rather wonder old Derrick didn't put a cellar here. It used to be his
  house, you know."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," said Dick, interested.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes; his lordship's father bought it from him. Both these houses were
  under repair together and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The bell at Dick's foot rang shrilly.</p>

  <p>He dropped the cup and saucer on to the table, leapt through the curtain,
  and in two strides was over and into the next house. He pushed open the
  window, and as he did so he saw a shadowy figure confronting him. Before he
  could flash his hand-lamp the door slammed violently, and he heard a key
  turned. He threw his weight against the door, but it was held by the
  jamb.</p>

  <p>Running out on to the balcony again, he flew through his own room down the
  stairs. When he reached the street the door was closed. The man had left Dick
  the key; he thrust it into the keyhole and turned, but the door did not
  budge ...</p>

  <p>Bolted on the inside!</p>

  <p>Larkin could not have done that when he let himself out. Obviously, the
  intruders had taken the precaution.</p>

  <p>He whistled to a policeman whom he saw on the corner, and the man
  sauntered over in his leisurely way: a little ruffled, for policemen resent
  being whistled at.</p>

  <p>"Stand here. If anybody tries to get away, take your stick to 'em."</p>

  <p>The officer recognised him and saluted.</p>

  <p>"Somebody in the house, sir?</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you in a minute."</p>

  <p>He ran down the stairs to the area. That door was closed, too. He tried
  the window, failed to move the sash, and, drawing his rubber truncheon from
  his pocket, he smashed a pane of glass, dropped the sash, and climbed inside
  to a room which was normally used as a servants' hall.</p>

  <p>The door was open, but the light that had burnt in the passage when he was
  there before had been extinguished. He groped along the wall to find the
  switch, felt it at last and turned it down, but no light came. He had again
  recourse to his electric lamp.</p>

  <p>Before going any further, however, he unlocked the kitchen door and called
  down the policeman.</p>

  <p>"Stand inside the doorway and close the door behind you, or they'll see
  you," he whispered.</p>

  <p>"How many are there?" the policeman asked in the same tone.</p>

  <p>"Does it matter?" asked Dick irritably. The policeman admitted that it
  didn't.</p>

  <p>Dick was wearing crêpe-soled shoes; he had worn them that night with a
  purpose, and now, extinguishing his hand-lamp, he crept forward, feeling
  along the wall with his hand. He found the foot of the stairs that led to the
  hall, and crept up stealthily. There was no sound of any kind. He continued
  his way up the dark staircase; the stairs were well made; not so much as a
  creak betrayed his movements.</p>

  <p>The first landing drew blank. Softly he turned the handle of the
  drawing-room and sidled in. There was light enough coming through the windows
  to show him that the room was empty. They must have heard the smashing of the
  glass, whoever they were.</p>

  <p>He crept up the second flight, stopping now and again to listen, and
  reached the landing outside the locked door. He felt for the key; it was not
  there. But somebody was in the room. He heard a sibilant whisper, and struck
  heavily against the panel with his truncheon. At that startling noise he
  heard a quick 'Oh!' and again the fierce whisper.</p>

  <p>A woman was there&mdash;no hardened burglar would say 'Oh!'</p>

  <p>Dick stepped back to the edge of the landing and, taking one jump, hurled
  his shoulder against the door. With a deafening crack it burst open and he
  was in the room ... it was empty!</p>

  <p>He knew the position of the light switch and turned it, but without
  result. And then, for no reason that he could assign, a cold shiver ran down
  his spine and his hair lifted. He had a feeling that he was being watched,
  that mocking eyes were staring at him from some invisible and unknown point
  of observation. So real was the illusion that he turned round, and for the
  first time in many years did that which no English police officer does except
  in moments of extraordinary peril: he took an automatic pistol from his
  pocket and pulled back the jacket.</p>

  <p>He heard a voice downstairs, and jumped. It was the policeman.</p>

  <p>"Do you want any help, sir?"</p>

  <p>Dick hesitated a moment.</p>

  <p>"Come up," he said. "Have your stick ready&mdash;there's somebody in the
  house."</p>

  <p><i>"Somebody in the house!"</i> came the low, mocking echo of his words,
  as though somebody had repeated them in a fit of amusement.</p>

  <p>He spun round; there was no sign of anything human. Nothing moved. The
  sweat was standing on his forehead. And then he began to laugh softly to
  himself, and put back his pistol. He had passed the saturation point of
  terror, and his sense of humour was asserting itself.</p>

  <p>The constable came, lent his broad-beamed light to Dick's, and they
  searched the wall for some secret hiding-place. There was none that could be
  detected. Dick opened the cupboard where he had found the vacuum pump, but
  that was too shallow for a hiding-place, and he pushed the door to shut
  it.</p>

  <p>Something in the slow swing of the door aroused his curiosity. It was very
  heavy. He tapped it with his truncheon and it rang: the cupboard was of
  steel, its edge fitted into the jamb of the cupboard as truly as a safe door
  might. At the back of the cupboard were four wooden pegs screwed into the
  plaster wall; the wall was apparently solid enough.</p>

  <p>"'This beats me,' as Mr. Derrick would say."</p>

  <p>He went to examine his little bell detector. Somebody else had found it:
  it had been kicked out from beneath the carpet; the wire was cut.</p>

  <p>"Do you smell anything, sir?" asked the policeman suddenly.</p>

  <p>Dick sniffed. Not cordite this time, but a subtle fragrance which he had
  probably noticed before but had not registered in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Like ladies' scent, sir," said the policeman. "Do you know what it is,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not very well acquainted with perfumes, constable. It smells like any
  other to me."</p>

  <p>He could not see, but he guessed that the policeman was smiling in the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>"It's what they call 'Sans Atout,'" he said, proud of his knowledge.</p>

  <p>"How the devil did you know that?" asked the staggered Dick.</p>

  <p>The policeman explained. He had a young lady who worked in a perfume
  shop&mdash;a refined and ladylike occupation, and she had once introduced him
  to the misty fragrance of "Sans Atout."</p>

  <p>"According to my young lady it costs four pounds an ounce. You can't
  mistake it, sir&mdash;a sort of mixture of roses and cedar wood."</p>

  <p>"You fascinate me," said the irritated Dick. "Now will you use your nose
  and see if you can smell a cold-blooded murderer?"</p>

  <p>His blood turned to ice. From somewhere in the room came a thin, quiet,
  low gurgle of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Is that you?"</p>

  <p>"Me, sir?" said the constable. "I couldn't laugh like that, not if you
  paid me. I think it was outside on the landing."</p>

  <p>Dick did not share this view, but he went on to the landing. He found
  nothing. When he returned he had the feeling for the first time that he and
  the policeman were the only two in the room. That invisible presence had
  withdrawn.</p>

  <p>"Sounded like a ghost to me," said the police officer.</p>

  <p>Dick turned on him, too full of laughter to snarl. "Have you ever heard a
  ghost laugh, you poor&mdash;fellow?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, but it's the sort of laugh that I should expect a ghost to
  give," said the policeman with dignity.</p>

  <p>"It is surprising," Dick told Bourke later, "how difficult it is to get a
  uniformed policeman rattled. There's something inhuman about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a silence now, which the policeman broke.</p>

  <p>"What would you like me to do, sir? I shall have to report this, of
  course, sir."</p>

  <p>"Certainly report. Say that I called you in, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this moment all the lights in the room came on. Dick had turned the
  switch, hoping to get some sort of illumination, and had forgotten to turn it
  back. In some part of the house the mysterious prowlers had pulled over the
  main switch. There was no light on the landing below, but looking over the
  stairs Dick saw the reflection of the lamp he had turned on the kitchen
  stairway.</p>

  <p>He made another and probably his twentieth survey of the room, opened the
  cupboard again, and again hammered at the wall with his truncheon. It was
  solid plaster and brick. Even when he kicked against it there was not the
  slightest tremor or movement. The floor was not only firm, but had been
  covered with some material like asphalt.</p>

  <p>And now the scent of ...</p>

  <p>"What's the name of that perfume?"</p>

  <p>"Sans Atout, sir," said the constable, with the air of one who was passing
  on a morsel, of education.</p>

  <p>Dick sniffed and sniffed. It was strong in the cupboard ... cedar and roses.
  He closed the door, turned the handle which fastened it, and followed the
  constable down the stairs. As he expected, the front door had been bolted and
  chained. He made a mental note to have these moved on the morrow.</p>

  <p>It was nearly one o'clock before he went to bed, and was well assured that
  he would not be disturbed again&mdash;nor was he.</p>

  <p>He heard the tap on the door panel that announced the coming of his
  morning tea, and bade a drowsy "Come in."</p>

  <p>"Do you want this bottle on your table, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Bottle?" Dick sat up in bed.</p>

  <p>It was a small, beautifully designed little bottle, glass-stoppered and
  be-ribboned. He picked it up and stared at it. Across the grey and green
  label, in quaint silver lettering, were the words "Sans Atout." It was half
  empty.</p>

  <p>"Who put that there?" asked Dick huskily. Minns shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Dick, and, when the man had gone, he got up and walked
  on to the balcony and, craning his head round, stared into the mysterious
  room.</p>

  <p>"You've got a nerve!" he addressed the daring unknown.</p>

  <p>Dick was eating a very thoughtful and solemn breakfast in what he had
  flippantly called the baronial hall, which was Tommy's dining-room, when the
  owner of the house walked in. It was the sort of crazily unexpected
  appearance that Tommy loved to make.</p>

  <p>"For the love of Mike, what's the matter with Clacton?"</p>

  <p>Tommy's face was long and lugubrious.</p>

  <p>"I'm finished, old thing. I've made a most fearful <i>faux
  pas</i>&mdash;committed the most terrible sole&mdash;you know the word, old
  boy; it's highbrow, and means 'blotted my copybook.'"</p>

  <p>"Solecism is the word you want. That is the best news I've heard for a
  long time. Sit down at your own mahogany. Does this mean," he asked in a tone
  of alarm, "that I'm to be inflicted with your presence?"</p>

  <p>"No, it doesn't," snapped Tommy. "It's all off with Mary and me, old boy,
  that's all. It's pretty ghastly."</p>

  <p>"It's pretty ghastly for you, I expect," said Dick cheerfully, "but
  probably a great happiness for her. By Mary, do you mean Miss Mary Dane?"</p>

  <p>Tommy nodded.</p>

  <p>"I had a perfectly lovely evening with her, walking up and down that
  promenade, looking down on the band. Happy as a sandboy, old lad. Poor old
  Cornfort in a state of coma. He went to bed at nine, bless his old heart! She
  said she'd come and stroll along the front, and she did, too, and then, like
  an idiot, when we were sitting down on one of the beastly hard seats, I
  slipped a little present for her into her bag. It was open at the
  time&mdash;the bag I mean. I bought it in London&mdash;cost a fortune, old
  boy. If I hadn't taken the cork out it'd have been all right. I didn't know
  it was going to leak all over her beastly bag, did I, old boy?"</p>

  <p>Dick was on his feet.</p>

  <p>"What was your present?" he asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"A little bottle of scent ... all the go just now&mdash;stuff they call Sans
  Atout. I always thought it was a game of cards, but there you are, you live
  and learn," said Tommy miserably. "She was fearfully peeved&mdash;not at all
  the gentle Mary. She said she hated that kind of stuff, scent and all that
  junk, but I noticed she stuck to it."</p>

  <p>All the colour had left Dick Staines' face. "Feeling ill?" asked Tommy
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No; go on with this&mdash;ridiculous story. I suppose she left you?"</p>

  <p>"No, she didn't," snapped Tommy. "I left her. In fact, old boy, it was a
  lovers' tiff."</p>

  <p>"A what?" asked Dick, his stern eye on his friend.</p>

  <p>"Well, a tiff. She made me fearfully annoyed and I got up and walked away.
  I came back in time to see her going into the house."</p>

  <p>"What time was that?"</p>

  <p>"It must have been ten&mdash;possibly it wasn't ten. Nearer nine, I think.
  I never know what time any time is," said Tommy in the deeps of gloom.</p>

  <p>"You didn't see her again?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I saw her again." Tommy could be very testy. "You don't suppose
  a fellow like me would allow himself to be so ungentlemanly without
  apologising? I called her up from the hotel."</p>

  <p>"That isn't seeing her."</p>

  <p>"It's as good as seeing her, isn't it? I asked her to come out to give me
  a chance of undoing, as it were, the mischief I had done."</p>

  <p>Dick waited. He dared not ask a question.</p>

  <p>"And she did come out! We strolled up and down in front of the house. She
  told me she was a bit worried. She said that there was a girl in England
  exactly like her in appearance. She'd seen her that day in Clacton."</p>

  <p>"You saw her, you swear you saw her?" interrupted Dick eagerly. "It was
  Mary Dane?"</p>

  <p>Tommy looked at him in some concern.</p>

  <p>"Not feeling well, old boy?" he asked solicitously.</p>

  <p>"I'm well enough," said Dick. "I only want to know, are you perfectly sure
  that the girl you were with last night between eleven and what time?"</p>

  <p>"Must have been twelve," said Tommy. "Yes, it was Mary Dane. Who the
  dickens do you think it was?"</p>

  <p>Dick covered his face with his hands and groaned.</p>

  <p>"That girl's given me more heart attacks than any human being I've ever
  known," he said. Then he looked up. "What is the idea of your coming up?"</p>

  <p>"I've come up"&mdash;Tommy was very deliberate and important&mdash;"to get
  you to help about this charming young creature's double. You may not have
  heard of such a thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord!" Dick raised both hands to the ceiling. "Never heard about her
  double!"</p>

  <p>"She told me," Tommy went on, unperturbed, "that all sorts of people,
  including this feller who was killed in old Derrick's house, had mistaken her
  for somebody else, so I thought to myself 'There's only one bird who can
  solve this mystery, and that's the Dicky-bird.' And you're it!"</p>

  <p>Dick looked at him in wonder.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me that you've come all the way from Clacton-on-Sea,
  that bourgeois but pleasant resort, to ask me to take up the case of Mary
  Dane's double, you poor, gibbering fish? I repeat, so that it may sink into
  the shallows of your mind, that Mary Dane's double has given Scotland
  Yard&mdash;which for the nonce is me&mdash;more anxiety
  than&mdash;than&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Anything," suggested Tommy helpfully.</p>

  <p>He left soon after ten, and Dick could not but believe that there was a
  very special reason other than that Tommy had advanced for his sudden return
  to Town. He had a letter from Derrick in the afternoon, asking him to meet
  him the next day at his club. He was going, not to France, as he had
  intended, but to Scotland, or, as he put it himself, he intended taking the
  car and 'drifting north.'</p>

  <p>He wanted to know whether he would be required for the inquest on Lordy
  Brown, but this, Dick had been advised, was unnecessary. Brown's presence in
  the house was unaccountable, but not beyond explanation. He had a conviction
  for burglary, had otherwise a very bad character, and it was quite within the
  bounds of reason that he should choose the house of an old acquaintance, who
  was notoriously rich, for the exercise of his illicit craft. The man had so
  changed since Walter Derrick had seen him last that he wasn't even able to
  identify him.</p>

  <p>Dick could not accept the invitation, and Derrick came to see him.</p>

  <p>"My nerves are going as the result of this infernal business," he said,
  "and I thought I'd just drift about the country and eventually fetch up on
  the north of the Tweed. I may get bored and run back to Town; if I do I will
  let you know."</p>

  <p>In the social columns of the newspaper the following morning Dick read
  that Mr. Walter Derrick had gone north and was making a motor tour through
  Scotland and would be absent for a month. On another page was a reference to
  the Lowndes Square mystery, which, thanks to a more sensational crime
  occupying the attention of the public, had not received the prominence it
  would ordinarily have attracted.</p>

  <p>Dick Staines was on his mettle now. He spent one morning, being of a
  mechanical turn of mind, preparing numerous little gadgets which he hoped
  would limit his search. He procured a surveyor's plan of the immediate
  neighbourhood within a hundred and fifty years. Behind the two houses ran a
  mews. On one side of this narrow thoroughfare were the garages and other
  premises attached to the houses that ran left Lord Weald's. On the opposite
  side of the mews there were only two buildings, one of which was a garage and
  the other a stable. Between these two, which were situated at either end of
  the mews, ran a high wall, punctured at regular intervals with garden gates.
  Beyond this showed the rear part of the houses that faced on Coyling Street,
  which were distinguished in the sense that they each possessed a veritable
  garden path, very narrow and confined between walls, but with sufficient
  space, as Dick discovered, for the inhabitants of the houses to form quite
  pleasant flower-gardens.</p>

  <p>He took a survey of Coyling Street, and found that it consisted of
  well-built Cubitt buildings, all of which were occupied save Number Seven.
  This house had a deserted, neglected appearance. At the windows hung dusty,
  sagging curtains, which seemed to have been there for years; the front
  forecourt looked tidy enough, since it was paved. He made inquiries: the
  house was neither for sale nor offered to rent. It was just a derelict
  property belonging to somebody&mdash;nobody knew whom. He continued his
  investigations, and eventually found that the house was the property of Mr.
  Walter Derrick. Apparently the Borough Engineer had ordered certain
  alterations before the house could be occupied, and Walter, in a fit of
  pique, had entirely disagreed with the surveyor or engineer, and had allowed
  the house to remain empty. He offered the house for sale, but apparently the
  neglect had been so great that the cost of repairing would be so high that he
  jibbed at the expense.</p>

  <p>The last occupant had been a lady, who died there&mdash;a Miss Belfer.
  That was in the lifetime of old Mr. Derrick, and since her death and the
  disposal of her belongings it had stood unoccupied.</p>

  <p>This, then, was one of the undesirable house properties with which, Walter
  had said, his father had saddled him.</p>

  <p>It had a broad front, and he discovered without inquiry that it had once
  been, in the fifties, the home of some esoteric religious Order which had so
  prospered in the early part of the nineteenth century that before the Order
  smashed and dissolved, they owned a very large number of houses in the
  neighbourhood, where their wealthy novitiates were lodged. The property fell
  into the hands of old Derrick&mdash;one of the bargains on which he had
  founded his fortune. Even now the house bore the name 'St. Anna's,' the last
  remnant of its once ecclesiastical dignity. They had had a chapel of their
  own, he learnt, and when they pointed out Tommy Weald's garage he could trace
  through the renovation the old Gothic lines of this edifice.</p>

  <p>He was rather shocked at this. In some respects Dick Staines was
  old-fashioned. His Methodist upbringing still made him feel uncomfortable if
  he touched a playing card on a Sunday, and a chapel or church converted to
  base uses invariably made him squirm.</p>

  <p>It was his third quiet night, and he came back to the house wondering
  whether he would hear from Tommy. He had had no letter since that worthy
  young man had disappeared into the wilds of Clacton. That morning there had
  been an inquest on Lordy Brown, which had been adjourned for a month at the
  request of the police. No further evidence was forthcoming, no new clue had
  been discovered; the theory generally accepted was that Brown and a companion
  had secured an entrance to the house, that the two men had quarrelled, and
  that the unfortunate Lordy had been shot dead by an automatic pistol. It was
  obvious that some sort of silencer must have been used, for no sound had been
  heard either by Dick or any of the servants in the house. A pistol shot would
  have penetrated even the thick party-wall that separated the two
  dwellings.</p>

  <p>It was growing dark when he came up the steps of the house which he was
  almost beginning to regard as his own, and Minns met him at the door.</p>

  <p>"There's a lady to see you, sir. I've put her in the drawing-room."</p>

  <p>"A lady?" His heart leapt. "What&mdash;er&mdash;sort of a lady?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir, but she says you know her. Miss Dane."</p>

  <p>He pushed past the butler and strode into the drawing-room. She was
  sitting in a chair, turning the leaves of a book which she had taken up from
  the table, and greeted him with a smile that made his head reel.</p>

  <p>"Have I really given you all that trouble?" she asked, a quiet smile in
  those grave, beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>"All what trouble?&mdash;Oh, Tommy's been talking!"</p>

  <p>"Tommy has indeed been talking," she agreed solemnly. "But then, Tommy
  never does anything else, if you mean Lord Weald. Can't you bring him to
  London?"</p>

  <p>"Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>"We went to Margate yesterday&mdash;my patient always comes to Margate
  eventually. I'm giving up nursing soon."</p>

  <p>For some indefinable reason he accepted this as good news.</p>

  <p>"I'm jolly glad."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked, open-eyed.</p>

  <p>"Well, it doesn't seem&mdash;I'm not keen on your&mdash;it's a pretty
  heavy job," he finished lamely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but there are heavier. You have a pretty heavy job, too, Mr.
  Staines. I can imagine no work more exacting than yours."</p>

  <p>"I thrive on it," he said. "I'm getting a bad reputation on it, too."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him quickly.</p>

  <p>"About this ?" She nodded towards Derrick's house.</p>

  <p>"Brown, yes. I suppose you read the account?"</p>

  <p>"I read and I heard," she said quietly. "You forget, your Tommy is
  haunting me."</p>

  <p>"I don't know why," he said. It was an inane remark, and she underlined
  its futility.</p>

  <p>"Of course you know why!" she scoffed. "He's terribly in love with me.
  Isn't that a pretty good reason?"</p>

  <p>Dick sniffed.</p>

  <p>"Tommy's the kind of man who's terribly in love with anybody he really
  notices."</p>

  <p>"He's rather a dear, and you're rather rude! I feel an awful pig about
  him."</p>

  <p>Dick laughed. He was singularly light-hearted, could laugh very easily,
  could have made himself a fool with equal facility.</p>

  <p>"Have you been a vampire to him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said surprisingly. "If you mean, have I encouraged him to be
  terribly attentive. It wasn't nice of me&mdash;I hate myself sometimes."</p>

  <p>She said this so vehemently that he was startled, and for a moment his
  heart sank. He had always regarded Tommy's attentions to this girl as
  something rather amusing that meant really nothing&mdash;he could not imagine
  Tommy marrying, for example.</p>

  <p>He was a philandering butterfly that flitted from flower to flower, hurt
  no petal on which he lighted, and carried away no sweet poison from the honey
  he sipped.</p>

  <p>"You sound almost as if you've had a very serious affair with Tommy."</p>

  <p>He thought she was a little angry at this, but she laughed.</p>

  <p>"How absurd!"</p>

  <p>She looked round the pretty drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Are you staying here for long?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>She stared at him.</p>

  <p>"That question is in the best manner of Scotland Yard!"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask?" he persisted gruffly.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why I ask, sergeant, inspector, or
  superintendent&mdash;because I want to know! Does it occur to you that you're
  only staying here while Tommy's out of Town? Which is a polite way of asking
  you how long Tommy will be hanging over our fence&mdash;or our fences: we
  have a new one every day."</p>

  <p>She did not wait for his reply.</p>

  <p>"You're very lonely, too; you've an empty house next door, Tommy says.
  There's another lonely bachelor, poor soul!"</p>

  <p>"You mean Derrick?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I see he has gone to Scotland&mdash;how inhuman! And left you to look
  after his haunted house?"</p>

  <p>"Who told you it was haunted?"</p>

  <p>She raised her solemn eyes to his.</p>

  <p>"It's the scandal of the neighbourhood," she said soberly, and then her
  lips twitched. "You don't know why I've come here; I really don't know
  myself. It was such a wonderful opportunity of playing lady to your
  gentleman, calling on you and asking after your health&mdash;by the way, you
  should have asked me if I would like a cup of tea ... you needn't bother ... you
  can call me a taxi in a few minutes. Mr. Staines, who is the woman who is so
  like me? Do you know her? Or is Tommy exaggerating&mdash;he's a fearful liar
  in a perfectly innocent way. It's part of his vanity complex&mdash;I think
  Tommy's unveracity is his most endearing quality. Now tell me, who is
  she?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'd give a lot of money to know."</p>

  <p>"I have a double, then?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"What is she like?" She was laughing at him; he thought she did not
  believe him.</p>

  <p>"She is rather pretty, with beautiful grey eyes and a mouth&mdash;well,
  just the kind of mouth that magazine artists draw and so few women have."</p>

  <p>For a second she dropped her eyes, but raised them again immediately.</p>

  <p>"She seems to have made an impression on you. And, of course, I ought to
  be very coy and say, 'But surely that's a description of me?' But I won't. I
  think you have been very rude, Mr. Richard Staines; but, of course, I asked
  for it and I really haven't any right to complain. The only point is (I don't
  want her various physical qualities emphasised or described), but she
  <i>is</i> like me?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" That was all she said.</p>

  <p>She looked at him very intently for a time. "I'd like to know your
  mind."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather like to know yours," he countered. "Perhaps I'll tell you one
  day."</p>

  <p>She picked up her bag and her umbrella.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to be a perfect little gentleman and escort me to
  Victoria?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated. At this hour he usually went to his rooms. There had been
  nobody in Derrick's house for three days. After all, he was not supposed to
  be on duty all the time.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll drive you or I'll walk," he said.</p>

  <p>He left word with the butler, and followed her into the street. She was in
  no great hurry apparently, for she walked very slowly.</p>

  <p>"I'm a pig," she said at last. "You will never say anything as offensive
  about me as I shall say about myself."</p>

  <p>"What is the reason for all this self-deprecation?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you. Something that has just occurred to me. Tommy is in it,
  of course&mdash;poor Tommy. At this moment he's sitting on a bench outside my
  Cliftonville house, waiting for me to come out. It's probably raining. It
  must be rather wonderful to be romantic, as Tommy is."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather we didn't talk about Tommy," he said naturally enough.</p>

  <p>"Isn't he a friend of yours?" she asked in feigned surprise.</p>

  <p>"A very dear friend. I'm fond of Tommy. I'm stupidly fond of other people,
  too."</p>

  <p>"But don't carry your stupidity too far," she said quickly. "You haven't
  asked me why I'm leaving the nursing profession and what I'm going to do for
  a living. I wish you'd be as interested in me as you are in my double! Happy
  lady! Do you dream about her?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. Mary, I want to ask you something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He heard her soft laugh.</p>

  <p>"Will you start by asking me how comparative strangers address me? If you
  do, I shall say 'Miss Dane.'"</p>

  <p>"But I'm not a comparative stranger."</p>

  <p>They were walking now through the park, and he took her arm and slipped it
  through his. For a little while she let it rest, and then suddenly jerked it
  away.</p>

  <p>"No, no." He heard the catch of her breath. "Please! I want to retain just
  a little of my self-respect, if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>Her reply piqued and hurt him.</p>

  <p>"Don't be angry with me, please," she challenged him after a few minutes'
  silence. "I really was being rather nice&mdash;as nice as I know how. I
  called Tommy a liar just now&mdash;I've never got it out of my head that I
  once told you the most awful, deliberate lie."</p>

  <p>"What was it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If I told you that, the lie would have been doubly wasted! No, I'll stick
  it out and suffer my martyrdom. But I want you to know and believe that that
  lie has hurt me more than it's hurt you."</p>

  <p>Without warning she quickened her pace.</p>

  <p>"Do you ever get very sick of things&mdash;heart sick, I mean? Don't you
  sometimes loathe all you're doing&mdash;your work, your daily
  routine&mdash;everything? I get that way sometimes. I'm that way to-night, I
  think."</p>

  <p>"You don't like nursing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She did not answer for a second or two, and then in one word,
  emphatically:</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Her train left something after nine. It was a very slow train. She
  confessed that she had had no dinner. He took her into the station
  restaurant, but she was content with the lightest of meals.</p>

  <p>"Do you know why I came to Town to-day? Ask me before my train
  leaves."</p>

  <p>They had ten minutes to wait after they left the restaurant, and as they
  strolled down the platform he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why before the train leaves."</p>

  <p>He found her a ladies' carriage which she had to herself. The guard had
  given the preliminary warning, and the signal light had glowed from red to
  green, when she leaned out of the window.</p>

  <p>"To mortify myself," she said in a low voice; "to walk on hot shares and
  carry a candle barefooted in the snow!"</p>

  <p>He could only look at her in bewilderment. The train began to move and he
  walked alongside.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you the maddest thing you've ever heard." She was speaking with
  extraordinary rapidity, as though she were trying to compress all her
  thoughts into the little time she had. "And I'm trusting you never to remind
  me of this large lunacy."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked, increasing his pace to keep up with the slowly
  moving train.</p>

  <p>She bent down till her lips almost brushed his cheek.</p>

  <p>"I love you very dearly&mdash;I don't know why."</p>

  <p>It was just a whisper, and she was gone. She did not even look back or
  wave her hand in farewell, and Dick Staines stood on the platform, petrified,
  stunned. He was still staring long after the red tail-light of the train had
  vanished round the mysterious corner out of sight.</p>

  <p>He walked back to the house, treading on air. When he came to the house in
  Lowndes Square he found an agitated Minns in the doorway, and, suspecting
  that something was wrong, increased his pace and went up the three steps in a
  stride.</p>

  <p>"I've been looking everywhere for you, sir ... I didn't know whether I ought
  to tell the police."</p>

  <p>The man shut the door; his face was troubled and anxious.</p>

  <p>"That bell's been ringing off and on for half an hour. I haven't dared go
  in ... I thought perhaps you might have come. I didn't know what to do."</p>

  <p>Dick turned on his heel and ran out into the street, pulling out his key
  as he ran. He expected to find the door bolted and chained, for he had not
  yet had time to remove these. The door, however, yielded to the key. When he
  turned the switch the lights came on. There was no sign of an intruder until
  he came to the drawing-room. He stood in the doorway and gasped. The
  furniture had been moved. A secretaire against the wall had been lifted into
  the centre of the room. The wall itself had been wrecked by small electric
  drills&mdash;on the floor was one such that had evidently gone out of order.
  It was attached by a flex to a lamp-holder, and fully eighteen inches of the
  solid wall had been scooped out. The floor was a litter of brickwork, and
  every piece of furniture in the room was covered with dust.</p>

  <p>He picked up the drill and examined it with professional interest. He had
  seen such a tool used before, but never for housebreaking purposes, and
  literally that is what the intruders had been doing. Either they had been
  disturbed in their work or else they had decided that they had picked upon
  the wrong place. It must have been evident to them that there was no
  hiding-place here, but they had not abandoned their search until they had cut
  very deep into and revealed the width and strength of the wall.</p>

  <p>He heard a sound behind him and spun round, dropping his hand to his hip
  pocket. A man was standing in the room, staring with comical amazement at the
  scene of wreckage.</p>

  <p>It was Walter Derrick.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he said, and as he realised he grew redder and redder in
  the face.</p>

  <p>"When was this done?" His voice was sharp, his anger was pardonable. "My
  God! Who did this?"</p>

  <p>He looked from the shattered wall to Dick and repeated his question.</p>

  <p>"I would give a lot to know," said the detective. "Scotland Yard is most
  anxious to meet the man, whoever he is. We have been wanting him for the past
  ten years."</p>

  <p>Derrick looked at him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Do you know who it is?"</p>

  <p>"His identity, no. That remains as much a mystery as it was when he
  committed the murder which brought him to our attention."</p>

  <p>"Murder ... when he committed a murder? What kind of murder?"</p>

  <p>"About ten years ago, Mr. Derrick, the cashier of a factory at Slough was
  shot dead and robbed on the main Bath Road."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" said Derrick. "What has that to do with "&mdash;he waved his hand
  round the room&mdash;"all this, eh? What has that to do with this?" His voice
  was very shrill&mdash;evidently the sight of his ruined drawing-room had
  unnerved him.</p>

  <p>"The murderer left behind him a thumb-print on an automatic pistol. You
  probably know all about that: it is one of the standard cases. The other day,
  I came into your house after it had been burgled and we found that print on a
  drinking glass."</p>

  <p>"You found that print on a drinking glass ... the murderer's print, the man
  who shot the cashier?" Mr. Derrick was horrified.</p>

  <p>"We found it again on the morning we discovered the body of Lordy
  Brown&mdash;it was on this table."</p>

  <p>Mr. Derrick stared at the table, fascinated.</p>

  <p>"A murderer," he said huskily "... his thumbprint on that table! My
  God! ... And on the glass, you say? You photographed it, I suppose? I don't
  know what one does with these things. There is no mistake?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No mistake, only there was a curious circumstance which is puzzling the
  Yard and is puzzling me. Both on the glass and on the table we found only the
  thumb-print&mdash;no finger-print at all. That was amazing, particularly as
  regards the glass. A man cannot pick up a tumbler with his thumb. And he
  would hardly get only his thumb upon the surface of the table. I'm telling
  you a little more than Superintendent Bourke would like me to tell you. I
  have my own theory, but for the moment I should not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was staring at the wall, the smooth, polished wall and just above the
  big hole that had been dug by the ruthless intruders. Slowly he walked across
  and pointed.</p>

  <p>"There's the print again," he said.</p>

  <p>It was unmistakably there, a black smudge of a thing, yet every line
  distinct.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the two men met, and in a flash Dick's theory had become a
  certainty. He knew just why that thumb-print was there, and the manner in
  which it had come.</p>

  <p>A few inches below the impression was a tiny black spot. He touched it
  with the end of his finger. It was still wet.</p>

  <p>Superintendent Bourke was on the point of going to bed when he received
  the summons. He arrived after Mr. Derrick had gone to an hotel. Derrick had
  had to return to London to attend an extraordinary general meeting of some
  company with which he was associated. He explained to Dick without the
  detective being any the wiser, for the ways of finance were holy mysteries to
  him.</p>

  <p>Bourke came bustling into the drawing-room, and took one glance at the
  damaged wall.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear them doing this?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Dick, "I was out."</p>

  <p>He did not think it was necessary to tell the Superintendent what business
  had taken him abroad, and Bourke evinced no curiosity.</p>

  <p>"These people have the nerve of the devil," he said admiringly. "That's
  the thumb-print, eh?"</p>

  <p>He fixed his pince-nez and examined it closely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've got used to that old thumb-print now. I could almost tell it
  bare-eyed. That's the ink, eh?" He touched the little spot, which was now
  nearly dry. "You say it was placed there&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With a rubber stamp," said Dick promptly.</p>

  <p>"So was the print on the glass and the print on the table. They didn't use
  ink; a moist hand was all they wanted for the table and the glass. You see,
  sir, when you come to think of it, it was a very simple matter to have a
  stamp made. The Slough murderer's thumb-print appears in at least three works
  of reference. All they had to do was to re-photograph the place; I could
  undertake to make a stamp like that in two hours."</p>

  <p>"The idea being to blind us? Humph! It's curious, I never suspected that.
  Did you fix up your alarm bells and things? Anyway, they wouldn't be of much
  use if you were out."</p>

  <p>Dick explained that the butler heard the alarm but didn't know what to
  do.</p>

  <p>"He should have sent for the police&mdash;what apes these people are!
  Well, they were lucky to get you out of the way&mdash;I suppose you weren't
  fooled into leaving?"</p>

  <p>Dick did not reply.</p>

  <p>"They are clever people who are working this racket, and naturally they'd
  stop at nothing to get a clear run, and they must have known you were on duty
  in the next house. But you're not the kind of fellow who would fall for a
  pretty face or accept a little invitation to walk around the park and admire
  the moonlight on the lake."</p>

  <p>Bourke was examining the torn brickwork as he spoke, and he did not see
  his subordinate's face. Dick had gone cold as he realised that the
  possibilities which Bourke had examined and rejected were no less or more
  than the truth. He had been lured out of the house ... even the detail about
  the park was exact. And he remembered the things she said&mdash;that she
  hated herself; she had drawn her arm from his with such vehemence that she
  had startled him. He remembered a dozen things that she had said: her
  self-reproach, her last wild words when the train had drawn from the
  station.</p>

  <p>He was overcome with the sickening suspicion that Bourke had implanted.
  His suspicion? It was something more than that.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!"</p>

  <p>Bourke had turned and was staring at him.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen the family ghost? You look as sick as pup!"</p>

  <p>"I feel as sick as three pups," said Dick, steadying his voice with
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bourke fondled his double chin.</p>

  <p>"I think the best thing for you to do is to sleep in this house. I'll give
  you a man to keep you company&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I suggested that to Derrick, but he wouldn't have it. He says he's going
  to shut up the house entirely. He even suggested that it was unnecessary I
  should stay with Tommy any longer."</p>

  <p>"What he does with his own house is his business. I'd like you to stay on
  at Lord Weald's so long as he'll have you," said Bourke. "I'm accepting that
  idea about the rubber stamp, but that thumb-print wasn't chosen at haphazard.
  There's something very definite behind it, and I want to know what it is. I'm
  sure of one thing&mdash;. it isn't entirely intended to put suspicion on the
  Slough murderer, who may or may not be in England. And I'll tell you
  something else; Lordy Brown was killed by the same hand as killed the Slough
  cashier; it was the same low, upward shot, a trick of a certain type of
  gunfighter. We don't get much of that sort of thing here, but I've seen a few
  gruesome photographs and diagrams that have been sent to me from time to time
  from the other side of the Atlantic. Hang on to Weald; maybe he'll be
  hanging on to the biggest case we've had in London since the Chief
  Commissioner put me into blue breeches!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DICK STAINES took a sudden resolve: he would go and see the
  girl, tell her frankly the position, and demand from her some explanation for
  her inexplicable conduct. Never once did he dream that she had been guilty of
  the death of Lordy Brown. If ever he had seen honesty, that quality shone
  from her eyes.</p>

  <p>He thought and he thought, turning over in his mind every possibility, but
  in the end he was as much baffled as he was when he began to reason. Only she
  could throw a light upon the dark places of his mind. Supporting him in his
  resolution was his faith in her last words to him. She meant that, every word
  of it. He thrilled at the memory. Here at least was a solid foundation on
  which faith might be built.</p>

  <p>He slept over his resolution and left for Margate by the first train. He
  had no idea where she was staying, or that she was at Margate at all. Mr.
  Cornfort moved eccentrically. Here also might be a key to the mystery. This
  old man, who slumbered in a chair all the time, what part did he play, or was
  he an innocent blind to cover the operations of the gang whose victim Mary
  Dane was?</p>

  <p>Always he found excuses for her. She was in toils from which she could not
  escape; she was as much of a cat's paw as the invalid old man who served to
  cover up the operations of the gang. Or had she a veritable double? He was
  still convinced that she had; that somewhere in England was a woman so like
  her that they might not be distinguished apart. Poor Lordy Brown had talked
  of a Miss de Villiers; he once had an idea of cabling to Capetown, but at the
  office of the High Commissioner he found a local directory of Capetown and
  three pages of de Villiers! In the circumstances this avenue of investigation
  promised to be a cul-de-sac. He cursed himself that he had not questioned
  Lordy more closely about the girl whom he thought he had seen that night in
  Bloomsbury Square. He had asked him something and had received the vaguest of
  answers, but had he persevered:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Had I done that, had I done this,<br>
  So might I gain, so might I miss.<br>
  Had she loved me, who can tell,<br>
  She might have hated just as well."</p><br>

  <p>Browning's lines came to his mind. They seemed singularly appropriate.</p>

  <p>Dick Staines had many little mannerisms that bordered upon childishness.
  He invariably tested the state of his mind by one simple phenomenon: when he
  was very worried and baffled he always sighed through his nose. He caught
  himself in the act and laughed dismally.</p>

  <p>The journey to Margate seemed interminable. He might meet her on the
  beach; he would certainly learn from Tommy Weald, who had established himself
  at a Cliftonville hotel, just where she was to be found.</p>

  <p>Tommy's infatuation had ceased to be either interesting or amusing. In a
  sense Dick was regarding him with great kindness&mdash;he was such a
  comfortable alibi for this girl. He wondered whether, when she had referred
  to Tommy as a liar, she had these alibis in her mind? Suspicion, doubt, fear,
  and confidence alternated in his mind as the train crawled along that dreary
  foreshore from Whitstable to Westgate, from Westgate in a more lively
  atmosphere to Margate. Here he met a Detective Rees who had travelled down in
  the same train and gave him instructions&mdash;and he hated himself for
  giving them.</p>

  <p>He did not intend staying more than a day, and had come without baggage;
  but his first call was at the red hotel that was perched on the cliffs.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, Lord Weald is staying here, but I think he's out just now,"
  said the porter.</p>

  <p>A waiting bath chairman at the door volunteered husky information.</p>

  <p>"His lordship's down on the beach with that yaller chair."</p>

  <p>Dick had forgotten the colour of the vehicle and how easy it was to
  identify from a host of others less conspicuously painted or he might have
  saved himself the journey to Cliftonville.</p>

  <p>He walked down the slope back towards Margate, keeping his eyes on the
  crowded beach below. So absorbed was he in his search that he actually
  collided with the sober and silent chairman.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, old boy!" It was Tommy's voice.</p>

  <p>Dick looked up and met the eyes of Mary Dane, steady, unwavering eyes.
  They were searching his face, and her gravity gave to her a new
  breath-catching loveliness.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning," he said awkwardly, and could think of nothing else to
  say.</p>

  <p>"What are you down here for?" demanded Tommy.</p>

  <p>There was a certain amount of resentment in his tone with which Dick could
  sympathise. The bath chair had moved on a few paces and had stopped; the
  chairman stood motionless. Mr. Cornfort was asleep. Dick found his courage
  oozing under her silent scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"I came down to see Miss Dane," he said, "on&mdash;er&mdash;a little
  matter I discussed with her the other night."</p>

  <p>Tommy was not satisfied.</p>

  <p>"What other night?" he asked truculently. "My dear old fellow, why didn't
  you tell us you were coming?" But at one glance from the girl's eyes his tone
  changed. "When I say 'us,' I mean 'me.' Naturally, it's frightfully
  startling to see you barging into the poor old chairman. Miss Dane doesn't
  like it, I don't like it, I'm sure poor old Mr. Cornfort doesn't like it. He's
  got a weak heart," he added.</p>

  <p>"Will you go on, Tommy?" she said. Tommy gaped at her.</p>

  <p>"Go on? How?"</p>

  <p>"On your feet," she said, with just the faint ghost of a smile in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>The chair was moving. Lord Weald blinked from one to the other, turned
  with a sulky shrug and trudged after it.</p>

  <p>"I can't see you for any length of time until after lunch," she said
  quickly. "Mr. Cornfort sleeps in the afternoon. Will you drive over to
  Westgate and I will come to you&mdash;just in front of the hotel? I will meet
  you there at three o'clock. Is that too late?" she said quickly. "Or two?
  Either time."</p>

  <p>"Two would be better because there is a train at three, and I have to get
  back to town." He was a little stiff in his manner. The easy familiarity of
  that 'Tommy' had chilled him.</p>

  <p>"Have you come on business?" Her eyes were questioning.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Private business, yes."</p>

  <p>He was in terror lest she should find occasion to retract the words she
  had spoken to him on the platform at Victoria. Yet somehow he knew that she
  would not now refer to that amazing moment, and that she did not expect him
  to speak of it either.</p>

  <p>Unsmilingly she nodded and turned, walking quickly after her little party.
  Dick stood, leaning against the rails, watching her. Presently he saw her
  catch up with her charge, talk for a moment to Tommy, who, rather reluctantly
  it seemed, turned back.</p>

  <p>"I'm terribly sorry, old boy "&mdash;Tommy really was almost
  humble&mdash;"being so fearfully haughty and all that; but, you know, this
  young damsel rattles me&mdash;she does really! I'm fearfully and absolutely
  in love with her. In the evening she's perfectly divine and charming when I
  <i>see</i> her; in the morning she gives me the frozen eye, my dear old boy,
  as our Transatlantic cousins say&mdash;I really don't believe they say
  anything so darn' silly&mdash;my life's simply torn two ways, old boy. I'm
  getting a perfect wreck ... can't sleep at nights, Dicky. Phew!" He mopped his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"That's bad news, Tommy." Dick Staines was rather concerned.</p>

  <p>"I knew you'd understand." Tommy smiled wanly. "And she's perfectly awful
  about it&mdash;hard, old boy, hard as nails in an iron door! When I told her
  I'd only slept for seven hours she laughed at me."</p>

  <p>"For the love of Mike, how long do you sleep as a rule?" demanded his
  indignant friend.</p>

  <p>"Ten," said Tommy simply. "Doctor says I've got the kind of brain that
  requires a great deal of recuperation."</p>

  <p>"That I can well believe," said Dick, "but I shouldn't tell any of your
  friends that, because it's not exactly complimentary. So you're in love with
  Mary Dane?"</p>

  <p>Tommy hitched up his trousers, dusted a public seat with a
  pocket-handkerchief, and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Desperately," he said, "in the evenings. In the mornings&mdash;I'll be
  perfectly frank with you, old boy&mdash;I'm not in love with her. She
  exasperates me, she annoys me, she loses all her gentleness and
  loving-kindness, and when I try to hold her hand, she gives me the sort of
  look that you'd get if you tried to borrow a match in a gunpowder factory. I
  did that once," he said reminiscently, "and from what the fellows told me,
  people never smoke in gunpowder factories. One of the customs of the
  trade."</p>

  <p>"Are you in the habit of holding her hand?" Dick meant the question to be
  put in the most careless and indifferent tone. Tommy regarded the question in
  quite another way.</p>

  <p>"Don't get peeved, old boy. Naturally I've held her hand. That's the sort
  of thing a feller does who's in love."</p>

  <p>"And she didn't call for the police?" asked Dick, annoyed.</p>

  <p>"No, old boy, never mentioned you." Tommy was convulsed with his own merry
  jest.</p>

  <p>"Women have queer tastes," said Dick. Inwardly he was thinking of nothing
  so trite.</p>

  <p>He was puzzled; he was always being puzzled by Mary Dane. He wished he
  wasn't. It was so unlike her, so inconceivable that she could have sat for
  hours holding the moist paw of his very amiable but uninspiring friend. It
  gave him a new angle, viewed from which he was seeing a woman so completely
  strange to him that he could not recognise her. Mary had said that Tommy was
  rather a prevaricator. It was certainly true, as Dick knew, that he was given
  to romancing and, not to put too fine a point upon it, to boasting. He was
  one of those who go through life with the pleasant illusion that they have
  been endowed by nature with qualities especially attractive to women.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to bet you've never held her hand."</p>

  <p>"You'd lose, my boy." Tommy's calmness, his superior amusement, rather
  suggested that he had been speaking the truth. "I've asked her to marry me,"
  he said. He made the confession quite calmly.</p>

  <p>"And she was overwhelmed?"</p>

  <p>"No good being ironical with me, old boy. That's the word, isn't it,
  ironical? She wasn't exactly overwhelmed, but she said she'd like nothing
  better. In fact, old boy, she accepted me with certain reservations."</p>

  <p>Dick turned in his seat and looked at his friend open-mouthed. Tommy was
  smiling smugly.</p>

  <p>"With reservations," he said. "As soon as this old boy pops off she's
  going to give up nursing, and there you are! And then&mdash;there'll be a new
  Countess of Weald in the land. And topping she will look in a dinky little
  coronet&mdash;I saw one at Grays the other day&mdash;perfectly ripping!"</p>

  <p>He was speaking the truth, he was not boasting. These truths came home to
  Dick.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You needn't start butting: there it is. She's the dearest thing on earth,
  old boy, and fearfully sensible. When I brought her a diamond ring she
  wouldn't wear it&mdash;said it looked too flash ... well, she didn't say it was
  'too flash,' but you know what I mean&mdash;something ladylike that meant the
  same thing. So I bought the other one: didn't you notice she was wearing
  it?"</p>

  <p>The town and promenade of Margate were wobbling up and down before Dick's
  disordered eyes. His head reeled. Was this a very bad dream or a very bad
  joke? He sought information as the latter.</p>

  <p>"No joke at all." Tommy settled himself more comfortably in his seat. "I
  mean even peers of the realm get married. There's nothing comic about that.
  If they didn't get married," he added, as the brilliant thought occurred to
  him, "I shouldn't have been here, old boy. How does that strike you?"</p>

  <p>Dick Staines was stunned. All that he had come to ask had gone from his
  mind. Here was the tragic, incredible fact to occupy his brain to the
  exclusion of every other thought: Mary Dane was engaged! What was
  she&mdash;coquette? What kind of coquette was she who could tell him ...</p>

  <p>He took a tight hold of himself.</p>

  <p>"I heartily congratulate you, Tommy."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Tommy.</p>

  <p>His complacency was such that Dick could have thrown him over the cliff
  without compunction.</p>

  <p>"Jane and I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jane? You mean Mary?"</p>

  <p>"Her name is Jane Mary. I call her Mary Jane. As a matter of fact, her
  people call her Jane or did call her Jane. It's a funny thing how everybody
  has a different name at home to what they have in public. My gov'nor used to
  call me 'Dogeyes'&mdash;sort of term of affection. Anyway, she asked me to
  call her Jane when we were alone&mdash;when I say she asked me, I mean she
  allows me. It's a fearful privilege, old boy," he added hastily, "and given
  only to her best friends. You're a very good friend of hers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall not call her Jane," said Dick with emphasis.</p>

  <p>He did not know whether to laugh or cry; there was no further interest for
  him in the interview which she had promised, and he would have returned by
  the first train, unmindful of his mission, but for his promise. He shrugged
  his shoulders contemptuously. It would not be a very painful interview; it
  might be a little disconcerting, but by that time he would be, he hoped, as
  calm and as cold-blooded as she, who, engaged to another man, had dared say
  what she had. A coquette ... Then he had a mental picture of her eyes, very
  steady, very honest. He looked at Tommy Weald; his lordship's head was
  nodding, his rather large mouth was open, and his eyes were closed. It was
  the title ... Again he saw her eyes. In his imagination he saw them pained and
  hurt.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it," he said aloud. Tommy woke up with a start.</p>

  <p>"It's the sun&mdash;I always get drowsy in the morning. As a matter of
  fact, it's the air. Of course it's the air&mdash;comes straight down from the
  North Pole, old boy, fearfully bracing!"</p>

  <p>"When do you expect to get married?" Tommy spread out his plump palms to
  indicate his uncertainty.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. St. George's, Hanover Square, of course, old boy, with full
  choral service and all my aunts&mdash;no, I think it had better be a
  registrar's office. The aunts will be fearfully peeved, especially the three
  with the daughters. But I don't believe in intermarrying with one's own
  family, old boy. It's quite wrong, and I'm naturally hygienic."</p>

  <p>The last words were murmured; his chin sank again, his hands were clasped
  across his well-developed figure. His chin sank lower and lower. Dick looked
  at the chosen of Mary Dane, and was neither amused nor contemptuous; he loved
  him for the goodness of his heart and the genial effervescence of his
  character. He was a good friend; would certainly be a good husband.</p>

  <p>"Oh, God!" said Dick Staines, and left the sleeper to finish his nap.</p>

  <p>Punctually to the minute, a Margate taxi turned from the main road and
  came slowly along the crowded front of Westgate, and the girl got out. She
  was not wearing her nurse's costume, but a grey dress which gave her
  complexion a darker and richer tint. He had always thought it was pale
  before; now he could value her delicate colouring.</p>

  <p>"You don't want to go on the beach, do you? Do you mind walking up towards
  Margate?"</p>

  <p>He fell in by her side, and they paced in silence along an endless road of
  small and large villas, each designed apparently by an architect who had lost
  his reason, until they came to a clear stretch of grass and soil, where only
  a few nursemaids were visible.</p>

  <p>"Let us sit on the grass," she said. "People will think that we're an
  engaged couple down for the day, but you'll survive that."</p>

  <p>He had an idea that she made that provocative statement deliberately. He
  was not prepared to accept the challenge.</p>

  <p>"Well? What do you want to see me about?"</p>

  <p>"Why did you ask me to see you to the station the other night?"</p>

  <p>She was plucking at the grass and did not look up.</p>

  <p>"Was that an unusual request? I mean, isn't it an ordinary thing&mdash;why
  do you think I asked you?" she said, raising her eyes.</p>

  <p>"During my absence somebody got into Derrick's house and hammered down a
  part of the wall, evidently searching for gold which is believed to be
  hidden&mdash;they were the same people who were there before, with one
  exception. The woman whose dress reeked of 'Sans Atout' did not seem to be
  amongst those present."</p>

  <p>She smiled at the flippancy.</p>

  <p>"Me? And are you suggesting that I lured you away from the house in order
  that these&mdash;impossible friends of mine&mdash;burglar friends, that is to
  say&mdash;should destroy Mr. Derrick's wall?"</p>

  <p>He was silent.</p>

  <p>"Is that your suggestion?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm not suggesting anything." He knew how lame and weak he was being. "I
  am just asking you whether&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So far you've only expressed a desire to know why I asked you to take me
  to the station. I think that has the most natural explanation."</p>

  <p>"I'm going a little farther."</p>

  <p>He was desperate, and, to his dismay, out of breath. Why he should be,
  knowing that this girl was the fiancee of another man, was astounding to
  him.</p>

  <p>"I'm constantly meeting you or your double in London and elsewhere&mdash;I
  have a suspicion&mdash;and when I say 'suspicion' I mean the word&mdash;that
  you are in some way mixed up with the crowd&mdash;I don't know for what
  reason, for what purpose, but I might help you. Mary "&mdash;he laid his hand
  on hers and she let it lie&mdash;"I haven't come to collect information as a
  police officer; I've come to offer my help as a friend. If in any of these
  mad adventures of yours&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or my double," she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Or your double&mdash;you are arrested, I can do nothing. But I can do
  something now; I can make all your risks unnecessary. Won't you give me a
  little confidence?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head half-heartedly, looked away over the blue sea, and then
  suddenly brought her eyes back to him.</p>

  <p>"I have less right to give any confidence than you have to ask it," she
  said, and the formality of her little speech struck him cold.</p>

  <p>And then his eyes fell upon her hand and the little circle of emeralds on
  her engagement finger. He hadn't seen it before, and he looked and looked,
  until she drew her hand quickly away and put it behind her.</p>

  <p>"Tommy told me," he said. "He's a good fellow, an awfully good
  fellow."</p>

  <p>"Is he rich?"</p>

  <p>So cold-blooded was the question, which momentarily struck him dumb.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is rather rich, and will be richer when some of his
  well-advertised aunts have crossed over.</p>

  <p>"You thought that was a terribly brutal question to ask, didn't you?" she
  said quietly. "Does it strike you that, if he is rich and I am engaged to
  him, I must be the worst kind of fool to risk&mdash;everything for the sake
  of a stupid adventure, as you called it&mdash;an adventure which so far has
  done nothing worse than dig holes in Mr. Derrick's wall?"</p>

  <p>"And kill a man," he added.</p>

  <p>He saw her stiffen.</p>

  <p>"Do you add that to my infamy? How absurd of you!"</p>

  <p>She lifted her hand and looked at the engagement ring furiously.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'm terribly self-controlled? I am really. You've had
  proof." She was smiling, a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"I've had several proofs," he agreed, as he rose and helped her to her
  feet.</p>

  <p>"But this is the supreme proof," she said quietly, "that I haven't thrown
  this ring over the edge of the cliff! Remember that in my favour."</p>

  <p>She patted his arm.</p>

  <p>Everything she did was unexpected and in some extraordinary way vital.
  She, more than any other person in the world, had the trick of making him
  feel a fool.</p>

  <p>"Now you can catch your train&mdash;it stops at Westgate. My taxi is
  waiting. Tommy is getting an extravagant wife in me," she said evenly, and
  then suddenly caught his arm in her hands and squeezed it. "I've told you one
  big lie, Dick Staines, but I've told you one big truth, and it's such a big
  truth that I hadn't got myself back to normal when I reached Margate that
  night. And I'm not normal yet. Hold on to the truth, my dear."</p>

  <p>He saw her into her cab. It was an unconscious trick of hers, apparently,
  to reserve her most tremendous pronouncement to the very last, when she was
  beyond questioning. As she drew her hand from his, and the car was moving,
  she said:</p>

  <p>"I'm in such a terrible, terrible mess, Dick, dear." And then she was
  gone.</p>

  <p>Before the cab was out of sight he remembered that he had set a man to
  watch her: the memory of his disloyalty took him back to town in a sour
  mood.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BACK in town, and raining. It was always raining in London,
  he complained savagely, as he swung aboard a convenient bus. He had left
  London under blue skies, with the parks all green and gold and filled with
  thousands and thousands of children being busily happy. He came back to find
  the roads mirrors, and every tree dripping melancholy drops. If he had come
  back to find Town basking in sunlight he would have had a complaint against
  that also. All sorts of things annoyed him. Mr. Minns, Tommy's butler, had
  gone out, taken the afternoon off under the impression, it seemed, that the
  visitor would not return. Also there was a long document from Scotland Yard,
  the depositions in a case wholly forgotten by Dick, though he had been
  instrumental in bringing the man to justice, and this he had to read through
  because some half-witted lifer in Peterhead Prison had confessed to the crime
  for which Dick's victim was suffering, and justly suffering.</p>

  <p>And yet he was glad of the occupation: it kept quite a lot off his
  mind.</p>

  <p>He had dinner alone, and in the midst of this Minns, who had returned very
  diffident and rather flustered, came in to say that Larkin would like to see
  him.</p>

  <p>"He says it isn't anything very important, sir. He's waiting in the hall.
  I'll tell him to wait."</p>

  <p>"Bring him in," said Dick, pushing aside the typewritten document he had
  been reading in the course of the meal.</p>

  <p>Larkin merely came to say that he had been over the house and had nothing
  unusual to report.</p>

  <p>"You remember that iron cupboard, sir, that you showed me&mdash;the one up
  in the office? I tried to open it this afternoon&mdash;you didn't lock it,
  did you?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Dick. "I think it fastens with a spring catch. You heard
  nothing suspicious inside the cupboard?" he smiled.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I don't mind the house in the daytime, but I tell you straight,
  sir, that I wouldn't stay there another night not if I lost me job for
  refusing!"</p>

  <p>"Larkin, do you remember the night I found you drugged on the floor, and
  somebody searching your pockets?"</p>

  <p>"I don't remember much about it, sir, but I know it happened," said the
  man ruefully.</p>

  <p>"What were they looking for&mdash;do you know? Had you any keys? That
  matter was never cleared up to my satisfaction."</p>

  <p>"I can't understand what they were looking for, sir. The only thing I had
  were the keys of the wine-cellar."</p>

  <p>"Which they took?" suggested Dick.</p>

  <p>Mr. Larkin shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, they didn't take both of 'em. That's the curious thing: only one of
  them. Mr. Derrick gave me charge of them before he went away. I might say,"
  he said with some pride, "that I've been trusted with more valuable things
  than wine."</p>

  <p>"Have you the key they left?"</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether I ought to give it to you, sir, but I suppose it's
  all right."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see your wine-cellar," said Dick, his eyes twinkling; "and
  you may be sure, Larkin, that my reputation for honesty is almost as good as
  yours. Mr. Derrick will find all his choice vintages undisturbed when he
  comes to take stock."</p>

  <p>"There's one thing I wanted to tell you, sir," said the man as he prepared
  to go. "Mr. Derrick gave me strict orders to fasten up all the windows. I
  don't know whether he told you, but he said he was not going to risk any
  man's life in the house until the mystery was cleared up."</p>

  <p>Dick laughed.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't matter a great deal, if you're not sleeping there," he said.
  "Besides, I've got a key to the front door."</p>

  <p>He thought Larkin looked a little uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"I didn't tell Mr. Derrick that: he's anxious about you, sir&mdash;he
  mentioned you several times. Mr. Derrick likes you. He said a life like yours
  was worth more than any gold that the burglars could find."</p>

  <p>"That's the kind of talk I like to hear," said Dick.</p>

  <p>He put the key in his pocket. When Larkin had gone he folded away the
  depositions, wrote the comments that were expected of him, and posted them to
  Scotland Yard. The night was his own. He might put to the test quite a number
  of suspicions which were beginning to form in his mind.</p>

  <p>They were suspicions which, viewed cold-bloodedly, had the fantastical
  qualities of bad dreams. He had serious thoughts of asking Bourke to release
  him from the case. His mental outlook was so coloured by Mary's association
  with the mystery that his judgment was probably at fault.</p>

  <p>Derrick's solicitude for his safety was very charming, but it was wholly
  irrelevant. A murder had been committed in that house in the past few days,
  and naturally the police could come and go as they wished. He had not
  insisted upon this step to Mr. Derrick, but when he met him again it would be
  a simple matter to obtain a modification of his instructions.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch: it was nearly ten o'clock, and he should be
  hearing from Rees. He hated the thought of spying on the girl, he who had
  spied on so many people, men and women. But he must be sure as a police
  officer, however much he might be wounded as a man.</p>

  <p>He walked out into the street to take a survey of Derrick's house. There
  was no evidence of anything in the slightest degree suspicious. Bareheaded,
  he went round the block as far as the mews, and came back and wiped the rain
  from his hair.</p>

  <p>It took him some time to settle down with a book to wait for the
  detective's report. It came just after eleven.</p>

  <p>"Sorry I couldn't get through before, sir. I'm 'phoning from the hotel. I
  have been keeping observation; I've seen the young lady twice."</p>

  <p>"Is it raining?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, it's a very nice night. She's walking up and down the road with
  his lordship. It has been easy to keep watch without being seen, because it's
  a pretty dark road."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed!" said Dick grimly.</p>

  <p>It was not a particularly pleasing picture he conjured up&mdash;Mary and
  the love-sick Weald strolling together in a 'pretty dark road.'</p>

  <p>"She was holding his lordship's hand," the unfortunate Detective Rees went
  on; "sort of swinging hands like children ..."</p>

  <p>"I hope it didn't make you feel ill?" snarled Dick. "Get on with the
  essentials. What time was this?"</p>

  <p>"I've just left them, sir."</p>

  <p>Dick hung up the receiver and went slowly upstairs to his room. Mary was
  an enigma, not to be solved by his wit. How could she&mdash;the inconsistency
  of it, the heartlessness! How could she? Since time began men had asked
  themselves such questions about women and had found no answer satisfactory to
  their intelligence. Dick sighed. His hand went up to loosen his tie.</p>

  <p>"<i>Brr-r-r!</i>"</p>

  <p>On the table near his bed he had arranged three little alarms. They had
  been fixed all unknown to Larkin. This tiny buzzer which held his attention
  had been connected almost under the eyes of the caretaker and led from the
  basement of Derrick's house along the ground floor and through a back window.
  Even the sharp-eyed Minns had not seen the threadlike wire. At the other end
  it had so pegged that whosoever set his foot upon the lower stairs leading to
  the kitchen was certain to break the connection.</p>

  <p>He went to the telephone and gave a number.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Staines speaking. All reserves to Lowndes Square; surround
  Derrick's house. Allow nobody to leave."</p>

  <p>He put down the receiver and went back to his room. He lifted his overcoat
  from a cupboard, drew a pistol from the pocket, and thumbed back the safety
  catch.</p>

  <p>As he was doing this the butler came in to ask if he wanted anything
  further for the night. His face fell at the sight of the pistol.</p>

  <p>"Are they in there again, sir?" he asked, going pale.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Don't let the servants know&mdash;if they're still up. You stay
  here. There's nothing to be afraid of. I shall have fifty policemen round the
  house in five minutes."</p>

  <p>He went outside to Derrick's front door and silently inserted the key.</p>

  <p>As he did so, and before he could turn it, he heard the soft thud of bolts
  on the other side of the door being shot home. He was just the second too
  late. He flew back past the alarmed butler, taking the stairs two at a time,
  and came to the top floor. His lantern showed him the skylight fire-escape
  and, reaching up, he pulled down the ladder. By this time the butler was at
  his heels.</p>

  <p>"That leads to the roof, sir," he said unnecessarily.</p>

  <p>"You astonish me," said Dick, and climbed quickly, and in a second or two
  was standing on the flat roof.</p>

  <p>The drizzle had become a downpour, and he was grateful for the security of
  his foothold. It was not a night he would like to have been climbing along a
  sloping slate roof. He made no sound as he moved towards the square frame
  over Derrick's roof. It did not so much as creak as he lifted it. Before he
  went down he listened intently, thrusting his head into the opening, but
  heard nothing. Swiftly he descended to the floor, and as the ladder swung
  silently back to its place, the skylight closed.</p>

  <p>There was no need to use his lantern; a faint light came down from the
  glass frame. Ahead of him, as he knew, were the two flights of narrow stairs
  that would bring him down to the 'office' floor.</p>

  <p>Again he stopped, holding his breath, his ears strained for the slightest
  sound, and then he began cautiously to feel his way down the stairs. Before
  he came to the tiny landing where the stairs turned, he realised that there
  was a light burning on the lower landing, and he remembered that on his
  advice Larkin had fixed a low-powered night globe which gave just sufficient
  illumination to enable the caretaker to move about. These had been fixed on
  all the landings, and evidently before he had left, Larkin had either
  forgotten to turn them out or had deliberately left them burning.</p>

  <p>Very cautiously he approached the sharp bend in the stairs and peeped
  round.</p>

  <p>As he looked, a cold shiver ran down his spine. The door of the room in
  which Larkin had slept was opening slowly, wider and wider it came, and as he
  saw the intruder his blood turned to ice.</p>

  <p>A girl dressed in black stood in the doorway, her head bent as though she
  were listening. He could not see her face. About her neck was a dark-coloured
  and flimsy scarf. Presently she raised her face, and he had all his work to
  check the exclamation of amazement.</p>

  <p>It was Mary Dane!</p>

  <p>He could swear to her, though he had never seen her in black. He could see
  the slow rise and fall of her bosom, almost hear her breathing. With one hand
  she held a glazed and folded paper&mdash;he thought it looked like an
  architect's plan&mdash;in the other she gripped a small electric torch.
  Slowly she moved on to the landing, closing the door behind her, and came
  forward to the head of the stairs.</p>

  <p>There were two doors here&mdash;that at right angles to the 'office' led
  to the back room&mdash;and now Dick saw the second door moving. Her back was
  turned to this, but the watching detective expected nothing more than the
  arrival of a confederate. Presently he came into view, a tall man in a long,
  dark rain-coat that reached to his heels. His face was invisible; over his
  head was drawn a black silk stocking with two holes cut on a level with his
  eyes. Dick gaped at him. Never in all his detective experience had he seen a
  masked man!</p>

  <p>Why did the girl expose her face whilst the man was masked? And then,
  horrified, he saw the mask come behind the girl and, jerking out his two
  hands, grip her by the throat. He heard the strangled scream, saw the look of
  wild terror in her face as she turned and fought desperately for life.</p>

  <p>"Got you!"</p>

  <p>The fierce, exultant whisper came to Dick. He saw the man lift her bodily
  and drag her back to the open door of the room from whence he had emerged,
  saw her face grow distorted and pinched in that fierce grip, and then:</p>

  <p>"Drop her or I'll shoot!"</p>

  <p>The mask raised his head to the stairway. Dick saw the two malignant eyes
  gleaming at him; and then, as the detective leapt, the masked man released
  his grip and flew down the stairs. Dick Staines would have followed, but the
  girl lay in a heap, apparently dead.</p>

  <p>He lifted her bodily and carried her back into the office room and laid
  her on the caretaker's bed. When he tried to turn on the lights he discovered
  that all the globes had been removed by somebody. He had perforce to depend,
  upon the dim light afforded by the lantern. He could see her face
  distinctly.</p>

  <p>"Mary!" he said gently.</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes and stared at him. He felt tenderly at her throat. He
  could not see the marks of those cruel fingers; they were hidden in the
  disorder of her scarf.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer; her wide-open eyes were without expression. They were
  looking beyond him. He had the same uncanny feeling as he had had that night
  when she had stared up at him.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. Her hand was still at her throat. And then she
  whispered:</p>

  <p>"Get me a drink of water."</p>

  <p>He remembered there was a bathroom on the next floor; he went down, found
  a porcelain tumbler and filled it with water. When he came back the bed was
  empty.</p>

  <p>The double had disappeared.</p>

  <p>There was a knock on the front door below&mdash;the reserves had arrived,
  and he went downstairs to admit a uniformed inspector. Outside he saw five
  police cars parked bonnet to tail; the streets was alive with policemen in
  uniform and plain-clothes men.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen anybody?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; we have only just arrived."</p>

  <p>Dick made a quick search of the house and found that the kitchen door to
  the area was wide open. A cabman, who had been drawn up by the side of the
  gardens nearly opposite, had seen a man run out just before the first police
  squad had come into sight. While Dick was interrogating the cabman, Minns
  came on the scene.</p>

  <p>"There's a 'phone message through from Margate," he said, and Dick went
  quickly into the house.</p>

  <p>It was the watching detective.</p>

  <p>"His lordship's gone back to his hotel, and the young lady's gone into her
  house, sir. Are there any further orders?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Dick. "Watch the house all night and report to me in the
  morning who goes in and at what hour."</p>

  <p>Dick heard the long-suffering detective groan. He had already been on duty
  all day.</p>

  <p>"I know it is cruelty to animals, but I've got to do it, Rees. Do this for
  me and I'll get you two extra days' leave."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. I suppose I can have some supper?"</p>

  <p>Dick pardoned his sarcasm and grinned.</p>

  <p>"All right." He called the butler. "I want some electric globes," he
  said.</p>

  <p>These he carried to the office room and had them fixed. He had noticed
  when he came in that the cupboard door was open, and after the disappearance
  of the mysterious girl it was closed.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to do a little bit of housebreaking myself. I want a crowbar
  from somewhere."</p>

  <p>He pulled the door of the cupboard; ordinarily a tug at the knob brought
  it open, for it was fastened with a two-way spring catch. It was half an hour
  before a crowbar was procurable, and during that time he made an inspection
  and saw that it was going to be a difficult job, for the door and its steel
  post fitted so perfectly that it was impossible to put a sheet of paper
  between them. And then, to his surprise, as he was fiddling with the knob,
  the door opened quite easily.</p>

  <p>Dick examined the edge of it very carefully, and found, as he had
  expected, two oblong, sunken strips of copper flush with the surface.
  Corresponding to these, he found in the doorpost two similar pieces inlaid in
  the steel surface.</p>

  <p>"There's an electric control here," he told the inspector. "What a fool I
  am not to have seen it before. There are the other connections!"</p>

  <p>It required very sharp eyes to detect the two studs near the hinges
  through which the locking current flowed. Dick attacked the back of the wall
  with the crowbar. He hadn't gone far before he realised that this energy of
  his would show no results. He tried the side, and found that also of steel.
  And then a thought occurred to him, and he sent a man down to turn over the
  main switch and extinguish all the lights in the house. There was no
  result.</p>

  <p>"Turn it on again. The power may work from a heating circuit. There are
  power plugs in all the rooms."</p>

  <p>The detective whom he sent was absent for some time after the lights came
  on again, and Dick grew impatient. He stood, leaning against the side of the
  cupboard, talking to the old uniformed inspector, when suddenly, he felt the
  surface on which his hand rested fall away from him. The side of the cupboard
  swung open like a door. Two minutes later the man he sent returned.</p>

  <p>"You found it, I know," said Dick.</p>

  <p>He took out his lamp and flashed it into the dark opening. The stone
  stairs that led straight downwards were unusually steep, and so narrow that a
  stout man would have found it difficult to use them. As it was, Dick had to
  walk sideways, feeling for every step, and keeping his head bent, since the
  sloping brick roofing was low.</p>

  <p>He had gone down four steps when, looking to the right, he saw a
  horizontal slit in the wall, and realised that he was looking under the
  fireplace into the room. It was from here, then, that the mocking laughter
  had come so inexplicably.</p>

  <p>He was bewildered by his discovery. Modern houses in London do not have
  secret passages, and these stairs had the appearance of great age. The treads
  had been hollowed by much use.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen anything like this before?" he asked the inspector over his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Never," was the reply, "but I've seen these steps before!"</p>

  <p>Dick was so startled that he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"They used to be on the outside of the house thirty or forty years ago. A
  sort of stone fire-escape. They were put up by the Brothers of St. Anna when
  they used this place as a sort of headquarters. I've often wondered what old
  Derrick had done with them when he rebuilt. He must have enclosed them with
  another wall."</p>

  <p>"Where did they end?"</p>

  <p>The old inspector thought.</p>

  <p>"I believe in the courtyard."</p>

  <p>This information did not entirely dispel Dick Staines' amazement. Why
  should old Derrick, a law-abiding man, spend money on this whim of his,
  fitting electric doors, building secret stairways?</p>

  <p>A third of the way down he saw a depression in the wall on the right, and
  what appeared to be another wicket. He tapped it, and it sounded hollow. When
  he tried to find a handle or a switch that would open it he was
  unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>"There were doors on all the floors," said the inspector. "Perhaps this
  one isn't working. The old man was crazy about fire danger. He used to have a
  patent cradle on the roof so that he could let himself down to the ground,
  hand over hand, and on the top floor he had ropes hanging on pegs at all the
  windows."</p>

  <p>They came at last to the bottom, and a door which yielded to the touch.
  Apparently the old man had induced the engineers to reverse the usual
  procedure. Ordinarily to cut off the current would be to keep the doors
  immovably closed. There was a switch here, as there was at the top of the
  stairs, but there were no lights and Dick found himself in complete darkness.
  Sending the rays of his lamp around, he saw that the walls were covered with
  steel shelves, and every shelf was filled with bottles lying on their side.
  This was the wine-cellar. He put his hand in his pocket; Larkin's key was
  still there, and, taking it out, he unlocked the heavy iron door. There was
  no sign of the fugitive girl, nor did he expect to see one.</p>

  <p>He illuminated the wine-cellar and made another examination. Three walls
  were covered with shelves and half the fourth. On the ground was a big,
  heavy, iron box, in which there were a number of compartments, half of which
  were occupied by bottles of liqueur. He tried to lift the receptacle to make
  a further examination of the floor, but it resisted his efforts. Calling to
  one of the detectives, he pointed to this box.</p>

  <p>"Help pull this aside," he said.</p>

  <p>The man stooped, gave one tug, and in another second was sprawling on his
  back; for the steel box was hinged in one corner, and somebody had neglected
  to fasten the invisible bolt which kept it tight to the wall. In the place of
  the box was a square aperture and an iron ladder that led down into the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>Dick flashed his lamp down, saw that it was less than six feet deep; saw
  something else. A little black heap of some flimsy material. He went down the
  ladder, and picked it up. It was a woman's scarf&mdash;the scarf that Mary
  Dane's double had worn&mdash;there was about it a queerly elusive fragrance.
  He stuffed it in his pocket and took his bearings.</p>

  <p>A low-roofed passage ran ahead of him. It was, he found, level for about
  twenty yards, then began to climb upwards,' and terminated in a square brick
  cellar about six feet by eight. On his right was another door&mdash;ajar. He
  pushed it wide and stepped out into the open air.</p>

  <p>He was in a garden of some sort. Ahead of him loomed the gaunt outlines of
  a big house.</p>

  <p>He looked back at the building from which he had emerged. It was a small,
  red-brick outhouse, surmounted by a cupola on which were still traces of
  ancient gilding. Over the door through which he had passed was chiselled on
  the stone slab that spanned the door:</p>

  <p>"Let us descend that we may ascend."</p>

  <p>The inspector and two detectives followed him into the garden and Dick
  pointed out the inscription.</p>

  <p>"That's a motto of the old Brothers of St. Anna," said the inspector. "I
  seem to remember there was some connection between the two houses. They had a
  chapel, which is now Lord Weald's garage. This is probably the way to
  it."</p>

  <p>The inspector (Dick recalled the fact that Bourke had spoken of him) told
  him something else that was interesting. He said that old Mr. Derrick had
  bought this derelict house, in the garden of which they now stood, for a very
  high price. Nobody understood why such a shrewd dealer should have allowed
  himself to be robbed. Some other house speculator had got in before him,
  apparently.</p>

  <p>"Obviously the old man knew about this passage. That is why he allowed the
  house to go to blazes," said Dick. "But why on earth did he do it? He was an
  honest man. Was this house ever occupied after he bought it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," said the inspector, who had an encyclopedic knowledge of the
  neighbourhood. "A lady lived here. I forget her name; she died about twelve
  years ago."</p>

  <p>"Young?" asked Dick, beginning to understand.</p>

  <p>"Middle-aged. She was a very good-looking lady, a Miss Belfer." He
  laughed. "I dare say Mr. Derrick will tell you all about it: that was what
  the quarrel was about when he left home."</p>

  <p>Dick asked no more. From the garden it was easy to escape: there was the
  gate leading into the mews, or the weed-grown path that skirted the house and
  came out by its side.</p>

  <p>When he got back to Tommy Weald's dining-room he took out the scarf he had
  in his pocket and examined it. It was a very dark blue, and he remembered now
  that she had worn it loosely round her neck. His first step was to get into
  touch with Walter Derrick. Keyley could give him no exact information; they
  thought he was 'somewhere in the north,' and were unaware that he had come
  back to London. There were certain hotels, however, at which he invariably
  stopped on his way to Scotland, and this list Dick handed over to a
  detective-sergeant who spent half the night telephoning.</p>

  <p>They failed to locate him, however, until the following morning, when he
  rang up from Stamford to ask for news. Dick was out, but immediately on his
  return he called up the 'George,' from which 'hostel Mr. Derrick had 'phoned,
  and gave the silent man a very long and detailed account of what had happened
  the previous night.</p>

  <p>"Did you catch the girl?" interrupted Walter. "And the man&mdash;what a
  brute. I can't understand it, can you?"</p>

  <p>"I can't understand anything," admitted Dick. "There's another point I
  want to ask you, Mr. Derrick. Do you know a Miss Belfer?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the reply. "Who is she?"</p>

  <p>For a moment Dick was too dumbfounded to speak.</p>

  <p>"Miss Belfer was a friend of your father's.". There was a long pause.</p>

  <p>"I don't know her by that name."</p>

  <p>"She occupied that old house of yours."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, yes. Did she? I forget."</p>

  <p>Either he could not or would not talk on the matter, for immediately he
  changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"Secret passages, eh? That's in your line, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It's very much out of my line," said Dick. "Though there's a very simple
  explanation for it. The two houses were at one time in the possession of a
  religious Order, and I found this morning that in 1845 they received
  permission from the Board of Works to tunnel between the two houses. There
  was no secret about it, only the fact seems to have been forgotten. And
  there's nothing mysterious, either, about the secret stairway; that is in the
  borough architect's records. Your father had it made as an additional fire
  passage."</p>

  <p>He had sent two men to make inquiries at Somerset House and to search the
  local registers, without hoping that he could gain any definite knowledge
  about Miss Belfer. They did not come back to Lowndes Square, and he found
  them waiting for him at Scotland Yard when he went there. Their search had
  produced an important piece of data: no less than the marriage licence at a
  North London Non-conformist chapel of old man Derrick and 'Martha Ann
  Belfer.' It had been a secret marriage in every sense of the word. The old
  man in his selfish way had insisted upon separate establishments, and had
  maintained his mystery for thirteen years.</p>

  <p>Derrick had left the hotel when Dick called up, but two hours later he saw
  his big yellow car sweep up to the door, and Derrick hoisted himself out of
  the driver's seat.</p>

  <p>"Well, they seem to be using my house as they like! I'm almost inclined to
  come back. I'm entitled to a little of the fun, as I'm paying most of the
  damages," he chuckled. "What's the latest news? Has the ghost been seen? Have
  you found the beautiful young lady, or the masked miscreant? By Gad, it
  sounds like something out of a thriller!"</p>

  <p>"I've found Miss Belfer."</p>

  <p>"Now who the devil is Miss Belfer&mdash;you mentioned her before?" asked
  Derrick wonderingly, as Dick led him into the dining-room, where he did most
  of his work.</p>

  <p>"Probably she had some other name. She was the lady over whom you
  quarrelled with your father&mdash;the second Mrs. Derrick."</p>

  <p>Derrick's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Did he marry her? Are there any children?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"Miss Belfer? That is what she called herself? I used to call her
  Miss&mdash;Constable. Queer he married her ... have you got all
  the&mdash;er&mdash;proofs?"</p>

  <p>Dick had them on the table, and showed him the copies of the certificate.
  He read them intently, marking each word he deciphered, with a quick downward
  jerk of his eyelids.</p>

  <p>"Well, well ... the old dog ... so he married her!"</p>

  <p>He had said this three or four times.</p>

  <p>"And no children." He drew a long breath. "That's queer. Of course, I knew
  all about it, but imagined that it was just&mdash;friendship. I had rather a
  row with him about it&mdash;and money, and a few things like that. You're
  sure there are no children?"</p>

  <p>Dick laughed.</p>

  <p>"As far as it is humanly possible to judge, there were none. There is no
  record in the register, and a local inspector who knew your
  father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" asked Derrick, and when Dick told him: "Yes, I seem to
  remember the name. He said there were no children either, eh? Well, well.
  Mystery on mystery!"</p>

  <p>He was speaking quickly, like a man who was thinking of something entirely
  different.</p>

  <p>"What happened last night? Who was that girl? You didn't catch her? I
  should have thought you'd have managed to put a stop to <i>her</i> activities
  at any rate."</p>

  <p>"She went down the wall-stairway."</p>

  <p>Derrick nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've come to look at that. I shan't be able to sleep in the house again.
  Where's your idiotic pal?" That grated a little.</p>

  <p>"The number of my idiotic friends is rather limited, and I ought to
  recognise him instantly. Whom do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean Tommy Weald. He's running after a nurse, they tell me. Stupid
  fool! Married to-day and divorced to-morrow."</p>

  <p>And then, without a change of tone or the slightest pause to indicate that
  he turned the subject:</p>

  <p>"Constable&mdash;that's what I used to call her&mdash;Miss Constable. Not
  an unfamiliar name to a policeman, eh?"</p>

  <p>Dick said nothing, and presently Derrick was discussing his future
  plans.</p>

  <p>"I really am going abroad, and I'm giving these devils permission to find
  the gold if they can! I think I'll leave a notice in the house that so long
  as they leave me ten per cent. of their findings they can get away with the
  rest! That's a sporting offer that would make my poor old father turn in his
  grave. Gold! The only gold in that house is on the picture-frames!"</p>

  <p>"You were in South Africa for some time; did you ever meet a Miss de
  Villiers?"</p>

  <p>Derrick pursed his lips thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I don't know ... there are lots of de Villiers scattered up and down the
  colony. I wasn't there very long. I broke north along the Tuli river, then
  north again to Victoria, and east towards Tanganyika. Any more thumb-prints?"
  he asked, his eyes twinkling.</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there will be any more. At any rate we're not giving them
  very much attention. Bourke and I have agreed that the thumb-prints were put
  there by means of a stamp&mdash;a senseless sort of scheme&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A stamp? A rubber stamp?"</p>

  <p>Derrick drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"How damned ingenious! A rubber stamp, eh? I wonder if it is anything to
  do with my father's collection? That idea just struck me. Perhaps our friend
  thinks that there are still a number of fingerprints in the house, including
  his. That may be what they're searching for, and not the gold."</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"In that case," he said dryly, "they would not be advertising the fact by
  leaving the Slough murderer's thumb-print behind. Have you had any burglaries
  at Keyley?"</p>

  <p>"None," said Derrick. "When I am away from this infernal house I am not
  troubled."</p>

  <p>He went off to look at the staircase and came back rather
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>"It isn't half as spooky as I thought it was," he said. "Of course, you
  will have a policeman in the garden or block up the tunnel?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Dick, "our little visitor will not come that way again.
  Hullo! Where have you sprung from?"</p>

  <p>Derrick turned round as Tommy Weald came violently into the room. Tommy
  did everything in a great hurry, and gave the impression that he had less
  than two minutes to spare.</p>

  <p>"Shirts, old boy," he said rapidly. "I'm not staying to lunch. Hope you're
  comfortable. Hullo, Derrick! They tell me your pals have been giving your
  house a good look-over!"</p>

  <p>"How is the fiancee?" asked Derrick blandly. Tommy had the grace to
  blush.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said awkwardly, "Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Dane is very well indeed.
  Extraordinarily well considering the weather. Thank you very kindly for
  inquiring."</p>

  <p>He coughed embarrassedly, shot a sideways glance at Dick, and asked:</p>

  <p>"Where did you hear the joyful tidings?"</p>

  <p>"I read it in the newspaper," said Derrick, to Dick Staines'
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Have you announced it?" he asked so fiercely that Tommy shrank back.</p>

  <p>"Of course I have!" he said defiantly. "And why the dickens shouldn't I?
  Mary doesn't mind, I don't mind, and my aunts are delighted."</p>

  <p>Dick could only look at him in pained wonder.</p>

  <p>"Then it is fixed?" he said, a little huskily.</p>

  <p>"On the fourth of September, old boy. We're going to Bellagio, wherever
  that may be, for our honeymoon. The wedding will be quiet."</p>

  <p>"Which means that they won't allow you to talk," said Dick savagely.</p>

  <p>He was confounded, too confounded to be polite. All his world was going
  topsy-turvy. Here was one of his best friends marrying the girl who was, or
  might be, a member of a most dangerous criminal organisation, and yet he
  could not warn him without being disloyal to his own ideal. It was the most
  incredible situation that the crazy mind of a lunatic could conceive.</p>

  <p>"I give it up," he said.</p>

  <p>"Give what up, old boy? Don't be rash." Tommy raised an imploring hand.
  "You're going to be best man."</p>

  <p>"And I'll send you a wedding present," said Derrick heartily, and slapped
  the happy man upon the back.</p>

  <p>When he had gone, Derrick and Tommy left the room together, Derrick to
  lunch, Tommy, with the help of his butler, to search for shirts. And Dick was
  left alone to work out this mad combination of fate. When Mary Dane had told
  him that she loved him, she was speaking the truth. He would not even
  question that. And yet&mdash;here was the unbelievable fact: she was marrying
  Tommy Weald, an almost chance acquaintance. He would not believe that Tommy's
  position, his undoubted wealth, were factors in the step she was taking. That
  was impossible. There must be some other explanation.</p>

  <p>Tommy came down to give him an opportunity, all unconsciously, of hearing
  from her own lips the reason for the step she was taking.</p>

  <p>"What about a trot down to Eastbourne, old boy&mdash;yes, we've moved to
  Eastbourne&mdash;terribly nice place&mdash;Beachy Head and everything."</p>

  <p>Tommy had attached himself to this queer entourage with staggering
  facility.</p>

  <p>"We went there this morning. Old boy, I'm getting so well acquainted with
  English watering-places that I'll soon know all the landladies in England by
  sight!"</p>

  <p>"How long would it take us?"</p>

  <p>Tommy considered.</p>

  <p>"If the chauffeur drives, about a couple of hours," he said. "If I drive,
  an hour and a half."</p>

  <p>Dick hesitated.</p>

  <p>"She was talking about you last night," Tommy went on, "saying what a
  brilliant man you were and how much she liked you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, said Dick.</p>

  <p>"Needn't be sarcastic, old boy. I'm just passing on a few remarks. Be
  generous, Dicky! I've cut you out, old boy, but I bear you no ill will."</p>

  <p>"You haven't cut me out at all," said Dick hotly; "and I <i>do</i> bear
  you a great deal of ill will! And if you please, I'd rather you did not
  discuss <i>me</i> with Mary or anybody else."</p>

  <p>"Don't be girlish," said Tommy severely, and Dick had to admit that the
  adjective was rather applicable. He was being infantile in his jealousy.</p>

  <p>He 'phoned Bourke, and told him he was going to Eastbourne to spend the
  night.</p>

  <p>"I think it's a good idea. What's the attraction at Eastbourne?"</p>

  <p>"Weald," said Dick.</p>

  <p>The chauffeur drove them, which was comforting in one way and distressing
  in another; for now Tommy could give him all his attention and tell him in
  detail just the provision he was making for his future bride, and what his
  aunt had written from Cromer and another aunt had wired from Derby, and what
  an unhappy life a man lived unless he had the intelligence to marry.</p>

  <p>"Let's talk about dog-racing," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about dog-racing," replied Tommy.</p>

  <p>"I should still prefer to hear you on the subject," snapped Dick.</p>

  <p>Tommy was in so exalted a mood that he was not even offended.</p>

  <p>They went by way of Lewes, and stopped to tea in that ancient town. As the
  car drew up to the principal hostelry Dick caught a glimpse of a big yellow
  Rolls in the stable yard.</p>

  <p>"That's old Derrick's," said Tommy, who had also seen the car. "Funny old
  devil! Do you know what he asked me when we went out of the room together? If
  I'd like to sell my pictures! Have you ever heard of such a perfectly ghastly
  idea?"</p>

  <p>"Which pictures?"</p>

  <p>Tommy looked at him reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you see them in the dining-room, old boy? Where is your artistic
  eye?"</p>

  <p>Dick was conscious that there were four large pictures in the room, but
  that they were landscapes which did not particularly interest him.</p>

  <p>"Four of the best Constables in England," said Tommy impressively.</p>

  <p>"Eh? Constables? I didn't know that. Have they by chance any titles on the
  frames?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," said Tommy wearily, "the artist's name is on a small
  plate on every frame, and unless your poor old peepers are going wrong you
  would have seen them&mdash;just the word 'Constable.'"</p>

  <p>"I see," said Dick slowly, "just the word 'Constable,' eh?"</p>

  <p>Was it a coincidence that Derrick had called his father's wife 'Miss
  Constable'? He remembered that the millionaire had been looking round the
  room as he had put the question to him about Miss Belfer, and it was then
  that he had recalled the lady whom he said he had known by another name.</p>

  <p>Dick did remember the pictures and the titles: he had noticed them
  subconsciously, as he had noticed the other furnishings of the room.</p>

  <p>"That's certainly very odd."</p>

  <p>"What's very odd?" asked Tommy, who was leading the way to the lounge.
  "The pictures? You're wrong, old boy&mdash;they're all the same size."</p>

  <p>He had a trick of stopping suddenly, so that people who followed at his
  heels had either to fall over him or move round him. He stopped to give his
  views on the difficulty of matching frames. Dick pushed him on.</p>

  <p>The lounge was crowded at this hour with people taking tea. It was the
  first of the two days' race meeting at Lewes, and they had arrived almost
  simultaneously with a large number of sportsmen from the course. But there
  was no sign of Mr. Derrick. When they had finished their tea and gone out,
  Dick had a look into the stable yard and found that the yellow Rolls had
  gone.</p>

  <p>The yard man, who still retained the archaic title of 'hostler,' said the
  gentleman had gone on to Brighton.</p>

  <p>"I resent Derrick fearfully," said Tommy.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"Because, old boy, he nearly killed the future Lady Weald. When I think of
  the possibilities of that beastly yellow motor-car&mdash;I can imagine
  nothing worse than being popped off by a yellow motor-car&mdash;and how it
  might have&mdash;phew! Good Lord! it doesn't bear thinking about."</p>

  <p>Dick tried to work up an interest in his friend's astonishing marriage. He
  found himself putting questions that he had asked before.</p>

  <p>"On the fourth of September. I keep telling you, my dear boy. For heaven's
  sake keep that day free!"</p>

  <p>"Does Mary know I'm coming down? No, not to the wedding, you ass!
  To-day?"</p>

  <p>Tommy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No. I didn't see her this morning before I left. Poor old Cornfort had
  been awake since three o'clock. Whatever is going to happen to him after Mary
  goes?"&mdash;he shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"There are other nurses in the world," said Dick brutally. "Now for the
  menagerie!"</p>

  <p>Tommy gave him the look of a dying fawn.</p>

  <p>"Don't call it a menagerie, dear old thing," said Tommy, hurt. "It isn't
  in the best of taste, old boy."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Dick.</p>

  <p>They drove straight to the private hotel where Mr. Cornfort's party was
  staying.</p>

  <p>Mary and her charge were out. They found her near a shelter overlooking
  the beach. She greeted the visitor from London very coolly. Dick's eyes were
  all for her throat: she wore a nurse's low-necked dress which concealed
  nothing&mdash;there was apparently nothing to conceal. If she were the girl
  who was in Derrick's house on the previous night, her throat would at least
  have been bruised&mdash;though her scarf might have protected her. He put his
  hand mechanically into his pocket and touched the soft thing, and hated
  himself for his suspicion.</p>

  <p>He thought she was looking rather tired and ill, and was alarmed, though
  why he should be alarmed when her burbling fiancé was at hand to share any of
  her burdens, he could not explain.</p>

  <p>He was very unhappy; wished he hadn't come. He had to face the certainty
  of an evening spent in the company of these young lovers&mdash;for himself he
  felt immeasurably old&mdash;and that was not a very pleasant prospect.</p>

  <p>"Are you taking a holiday, Mr. Staines, or are you here on business?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm taking a holiday&mdash;that is almost official." He tried to be
  flippant and failed dismally.</p>

  <p>He could not fathom her or read any significance in her attitude, except
  that his presence made her feel uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Cornfort is going back to the house soon. Won't you take me
  somewhere to tea?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He looked at Tommy instinctively. He at any rate was a good
  interpreter.</p>

  <p>"Tommy needn't come," she said.</p>

  <p>"I say!" said the indignant Tommy.</p>

  <p>Yet it struck Dick as a curious circumstance that Tommy's protest lacked
  heartiness; and later, when they were walking together, Tommy gave him a hint
  as to the reason.</p>

  <p>"She's a darling, but in the daytime she's terribly practical, old boy.
  She gives me the shivers&mdash;awfully sharp on me. And she's fierce on
  canoodling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"On what?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"You know what I mean: you've been in love yourself, old boy. I mean to
  say ... we're all human, and she doesn't like canoodling in broad daylight
  under the eyes of the public."</p>

  <p>"What a remarkable girl!"</p>

  <p>"Sarcasm is wasted on me," said Tommy, unoffended. "There are lots of
  quiet little nooks and places where a fellow can sit without a lot of Paul
  Prys seeing him. But she won't go there in the daytime. I tried to hold her
  hand this morning and she asked me if I was frightened. I mean to
  say&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>Dick had never dreamt that another man's love affair could bore him so
  intolerably as Tommy's. He schooled himself to hear without listening, and to
  make appropriate responses, according to the inflection of the other's voice.
  They followed the bath chair party through the town, and once helped to push
  that yellow monstrosity up a steep bit of hill. Whilst the hotel porter was
  assisting the bath chair towards the elevator, Mary gave him the rendezvous.
  At five o'clock he was sitting in an airy cafe, watching a party of children
  playing on the beach, when she floated in. She had been very formal and stiff
  when they had met at first, but now she was in her gayest mood.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to our city!" she mocked him. "Now show me how a police officer
  behaves when he's off duty. First of all, are there any questions you want to
  ask me about my criminal antecedents? And, by the way, have you seen my
  double? Poor darling! she must be the busiest woman in London."</p>

  <p>"Is this yours?"</p>

  <p>He took out the scarf and put it on the table. She picked it up calmly
  without a word and examined it curiously.</p>

  <p>"That certainly looks like mine. I bought one in town last time I was
  there."</p>

  <p>"Is it yours?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>She opened the bag she carried, put in her hand and took out the exact
  replica and unfolded it.</p>

  <p>"My double?" she asked, the light of laughter in her eyes. "Even my scarf
  has one!"</p>

  <p>Dick was pushing the silk scarf back in his pocket when she stopped
  him.</p>

  <p>"Let me take that, unless I'm removing very important clues."</p>

  <p>He tossed it across to her.</p>

  <p>"Add it to your collection," he said.</p>

  <p>"Poor man!" She patted his hand softly. "Tommy's been telling me what a
  dreadful time you've had with those wretched visitors to Mr. Derrick's house.
  Tommy told me they pulled down one of the walls; is that true?"</p>

  <p>"Tommy talks a great deal too much."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't tell me half enough," she said, "although I admit he talks too
  much."</p>

  <p>"You remember Lordy Brown, don't you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and the smile left her face.</p>

  <p>"The man who was killed? Yes. He was the same man who stopped me in
  Bloomsbury Square and thought he recognised me. Poor soul!"</p>

  <p>"Are you sorry for him?" It was an inane question.</p>

  <p>"Yes, aren't you? Terribly, terribly sorry. And his poor little wife."</p>

  <p>He looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about his wife?"</p>

  <p>For a moment she did not answer.</p>

  <p>"I can't think of a lie," she said very lightly. "So I'll ask you to
  excuse me answering that question. I know he has a wife, who is, or was, in a
  pretty bad way. She has two or three children."</p>

  <p>"Then you knew him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I had a short conversation with him."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>She pushed herself back from the table, her eyes twinkling.</p>

  <p>"You're being a police officer," she accused him. "I suppose it's
  difficult to get out of the habit. I saw him subsequent to our meeting in
  Bloomsbury Square. Does that satisfy you?"</p>

  <p>"You didn't tell me."</p>

  <p>"You never asked me. Besides, I didn't think you were interested in Lordy
  Brown&mdash;oh yes, I did. But I didn't tell you because&mdash;well, it would
  have been rather embarrassing."</p>

  <p>"You're an amazing girl," he said.</p>

  <p>"I used to think so," she answered, and sighed. "I don't think so any
  more; I think I'm rather&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Rather a failure. Conceit has been my ruin."</p>

  <p>He made an obvious retort. "Tommy will do nothing to cure it."</p>

  <p>She gave him one reproachful glance.</p>

  <p>"You deserve to be smacked for that," she said. "Poor Tommy!"</p>

  <p>"I really can't understand you, Mary. Why are you marrying Weald?"</p>

  <p>"Call him 'Tommy'; it's so much more like him. I always imagined earls
  were terribly ruddy-faced creatures with fists like shoulders of mutton. Why
  am I marrying him? Who said I was marrying him?"</p>

  <p>"Why, it's been announced in the newspapers," he said indignantly. "Why do
  you quibble?"</p>

  <p>"Don't let us quarrel," she said, as the waitress approached with a tray
  piled high with cups and plates and a dazzling array of confectionery. "Now,
  imagine I'm a wicked vamp trying to charm secret information from you. Have
  you found anything really startling? Tommy said you found something in an old
  box."</p>

  <p>"Why I told Tommy I don't know. Anyway, it was nothing&mdash;a sort of
  vacuum pump, or as we called it when we were young, a 'sucker.' It's for
  lifting or pulling things with a smooth surface."</p>

  <p>He raised his eyes from the little cake he was dissecting and was struck
  dumb by the expression on her face. She was staring at him, her eyes open
  wide, her lips parted.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is the matter?"</p>

  <p>For a second she had lost control. Now she was regaining her equilibrium
  with difficulty.</p>

  <p>"Matter?" she stammered. "Nothing ... only I've just remembered that I've
  forgotten to give Mr. Cornfort his&mdash;his medicine."</p>

  <p>"What was the matter?" he asked again. "It had nothing whatever to do with
  Mr. Cornfort's medicine. Besides, he doesn't take medicine. You told me that
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about that vacuum pump; what shape was it? I won't pretend I'm
  not interested."</p>

  <p>He described it briefly, cursing Tommy for his loquacity. Not that he
  attached any especial importance to that commonplace tool.</p>

  <p>She looked up at the ceiling and her eyes narrowed. He guessed that she
  was thinking, and thinking very quickly.</p>

  <p>"Can you remember any more about that pump?"</p>

  <p>In spite of his annoyance he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can. I could describe it so faithfully that you could make one
  yourself. It is not like any other vacuum, because in the middle it has a
  small long steel needle. We only discovered that when we were examining it
  the other day. There's a tiny little screw near the handle and the needle
  extends itself down beyond the cup. My superintendent thinks that it was used
  to lift some circular object, and the needle was employed to find the centre.
  That's all I can tell you, and I have told you too much." And then she came
  back to the present.</p>

  <p>"Can you stay till to-morrow night?"</p>

  <p>He had to leave in the morning, he told her, some time about lunch.
  Earlier if there was trouble in Derrick's house. He had left two men there
  without consulting that gentleman.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there'll be trouble," she said, when they were strolling
  along the picturesque front.</p>

  <p>"Can you guarantee that?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I can't be responsible for my double. Tommy says they found the
  finger-print of the Slough murderer."</p>

  <p>"What do you know about the Slough murderer?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I know very little, except that the man who committed the murder was
  named Herman Lavinski, a naturalised Russian. And there's Tommy looking
  positively radiant. I told him to fetch me."</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment."</p>

  <p>In his agitation he gripped her arm. "What was his name, do you
  say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Herman Lavinski."</p>

  <p>"But how do you know?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment, a smile in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"My double told me," she said.</p>

  <p>Dick was on the telephone to the record office at Scotland Yard within
  half an hour. If she was fooling him&mdash;well, she had done her work well.
  But he had a feeling that when she gave that name, she was in deadly
  earnest.</p>

  <p>He gave the office time to look up their data and then he called London
  again.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he's never been through our hands, but we had him on
  Supplementary List A some years ago."</p>

  <p>'Supplementary List A' was that in which were tabulated foreign wrongdoers
  who were expected to be in the country.</p>

  <p>"Read his description," he ordered, and, when this was done: "No
  finger-prints?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. He may have had a conviction abroad. I will put through an
  inquiry to Paris. I'm not so sure they keep finger-prints."</p>

  <p>Dick wasn't sure either.</p>

  <p>This fact was patent: there was a man called Lavinski, and the description
  that had been read to him tallied with that ten-year-old description that had
  been handed down to the archives of Scotland Yard. It was no invention of
  Mary Dane's; he would have been surprised if it had been.</p>

  <p>It always gave him a pang to see Tommy and the girl together, and he
  rejoined them on the beach with no great pleasure. Mr. Cornfort was asleep.
  He saw the unshaven chairman sitting on a public bench, smoking a clay pipe
  and at peace with the world.</p>

  <p>"What is the name of that beast of burden of yours?"</p>

  <p>"If you mean our chairman, you're being very disrespectful," she said
  severely. "His name is Henry."</p>

  <p>"Does he ever speak?"</p>

  <p>"He has been known to ask for his dinner," she said. And then: "Mr.
  Staines, I want you to talk to Tommy. He's being difficult."</p>

  <p>Tommy was sulky, sitting cross-legged like a naughty boy and throwing all
  the stones within his reach towards the incoming sea.</p>

  <p>"I really don't think that we want to discuss the matter, Mary," he said
  testily. "I mean to say, it's perfectly private between you and me."</p>

  <p>"But it isn't perfectly private between you and me," she said. "It's
  perfectly public&mdash;at least, you wanted to make it so."</p>

  <p>He rose with dignity.</p>

  <p>"I'm going back to Town," he said.</p>

  <p>She drew off the little emerald circlet from her finger.</p>

  <p>"Take this with you."</p>

  <p>He wilted under the implied threat.</p>

  <p>"Don't be perfectly ghastly," he said. "Put it on, put it on!" Then
  suddenly he bent down and seized her hand. "I told you that ring didn't fit
  you. I'll have it tightened up to-morrow, old lady."</p>

  <p>"Don't call me 'old lady,' Tommy," she said wearily. "You know, you make me
  feel all curls and crinolines."</p>

  <p>Tommy looked at his watch rather importantly. He had risen from the depth
  of gloom to the height of confidence in the course of a minute.</p>

  <p>"I'll dash up to the hotel&mdash;you won't come to dinner?"</p>

  <p>"I'm dining with Mr. Staines," she said. Tommy winced at that.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, all right." He went away making incoherent noises.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"Tommy wants to be affectionate&mdash;I don't think he ever had a mother's
  care. And, by the way, you needn't dress to-night. Mr. Cornfort is sleeping
  and he expressed a desire to go out in the evening after dark. You shall join
  the caravan with me."</p>

  <p>They talked idly and aimlessly. Dick mentioned casually that he had seen
  Walter Derrick's car at Lewes.</p>

  <p>"Do you like him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do rather. Don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm rather prejudiced. You see, I haven't forgotten my narrow
  escape."</p>

  <p>"You didn't go on as if it were a narrow escape. I thought you were the
  coolest person I had ever met."</p>

  <p>"That was sheer&mdash;what's the word?&mdash;swank, I think. Yes, I was
  terrified. Ever so much more frightened than when poor Lordy Brown discovered
  in me his mortal enemy. You've inquired about Lavinski, of course?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked. "Is there any such person?"</p>

  <p>He nodded again.</p>

  <p>"Are you surprised?"</p>

  <p>"I should have been surprised if there wasn't," he said, "after you had
  told me."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"That implies a very touching faith in me! Do you like the idea of my
  marrying Tommy?"</p>

  <p>He drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"I think it's horrible. Not that Tommy isn't a very good fellow," he said
  guardedly, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why is it horrible?" She looked at him so intently that he almost forgot
  that he sat there in view of thousands of children and nursemaids, mothers
  and papas, to say nothing of itinerant photographers.</p>

  <p>"Because I love you."</p>

  <p>It didn't sound like his voice speaking that. She did not move her eyes
  from his; they were very searching, eager eyes. He had seen pain in them, and
  that made them more precious.</p>

  <p>"When did you discover this&mdash;at Victoria? Have I provoked you into
  this declaration?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I think I loved you at Brighton, and realised it in Lowndes Square. I
  really don't know why I love you at all."</p>

  <p>The ghost of a smile trembled on her lips.</p>

  <p>"It sounds rather a sententious thing to say. Does anybody know why
  anybody loves anybody?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I love you," he repeated doggedly, "especially as I'm
  full of suspicion about you. Even now I can't get rid of it. There's no
  other woman in the world like you. I know your eyes, your mouth, I know every
  line of you. I saw you in Derrick's house last night&mdash;in the hands of a
  masked man who was trying to strangle you. I've been looking for the bruises
  all the day."</p>

  <p>"Have you?"</p>

  <p>And then she did a surprising thing. She wetted the tip of her finger and
  brought it down her neck, and under his eyes there came into view a blue oval
  bruise.</p>

  <p>"Like that?" she said.</p>

  <p>He was incapable of reply.</p>

  <p>She took a little gold box from her bag, opened it, looked in the mirrored
  lid, smoothed a pad down her throat; when it had passed, the bruise had
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"I saw you looking." She was half smiling, very serious. "You were peeping
  at my throat when you met me this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Then it was you?" he said in a low voice. She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was I."</p>

  <p>He could only shake his head helplessly.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, why? Yet it couldn't have been you&mdash;Tommy was with
  you all yesterday evening."</p>

  <p>She touched his hand&mdash;that little petting trick of hers that she had,
  how sweet it was!</p>

  <p>"You're the most impossible man, Dick Staines," she said. "Having proved
  that I was being slowly strangled to death, that I was the wicked
  housebreaker, you are now trying to prove an alibi. Now I'll show you the
  greatest trick of all."</p>

  <p>Again she took out her little box, again wiped the bruise into view. Then
  she wet the corner of her handkerchief with the tip of her tongue and drew it
  down her throat, and lo! the bruise had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Now are you satisfied?"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"There isn't a bruise," she said, "but I hated to disappoint you. I
  thought I'd make a dramatic revelation of it at tea. It occurred to me this
  morning that you would expect to see it and my ingenious mind got to work: I
  first painted the bruise and then I covered it up with a special kind of damp
  powder. What else would you like me to do? I'm full of tricks to-day!"</p>

  <p>He reached out and took her hand.</p>

  <p>"I should like to marry you," he said simply. She looked away.</p>

  <p>"I wonder." Then, with a sigh, she got up. "Come along. I'm going to
  change again. Life's one darned dress after another! Dinner at half-past
  seven, and don't keep me waiting in the vestibule, or I shall be terribly
  dignified and distant!"</p>

  <p>After she had gone he climbed up to Beachy Head and stood for so long
  admiring the view that he almost qualified for her displeasure. He had five
  minutes to tidy himself; she was waiting for him in the hotel lounge,
  absorbed in an evening newspaper. He saw the page she was reading and was a
  little surprised.</p>

  <p>"Are you interested in the stock markets?"</p>

  <p>She looked up quickly and threw down the paper. "Yes, a little," she said.
  "I have some African stocks that jump up and down; they afford a little
  excitement in life. They're constantly jumping up and down. At the moment
  they're down."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you were a rich woman."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't call myself rich. I have ten or twenty thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>He was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. Did that hurt your feelings?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth are you a nurse?"</p>

  <p>"I love my profession," she said solemnly. "No, seriously, I used to be
  terribly keen on it. I was the youngest qualified nurse in my hospital. Then
  I got rather tired of it, and Daddy wanted me at home."</p>

  <p>"Have you a daddy?" He apologised for the crudity of the question, but it
  was unnecessary.</p>

  <p>"Of course I have, and a very clever daddy."</p>

  <p>She did not speak of him again. Always she returned banteringly to what
  she called the haunted house.</p>

  <p>"I'd love to know what you think about it all," she said. "Tommy says
  you're very bright, and that's the highest praise Tommy gives to
  anybody!"</p>

  <p>He rather wished she wouldn't drag Tommy into the conversation. He was not
  quite sure how he and Tommy would meet that evening. If he were in Tommy's
  place he thought he would be rather annoyed. He tried to bring the
  conversation to her wedding. She side-tracked his effort with consummate
  skill, and when he returned again by a vague reference to a wedding present,
  she said:</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't talk about it. I'm not marrying Tommy. How could
  I?"</p>

  <p>"But surely&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Between her emphatic announcement and his sense of loyalty to his absent
  friend he made an unconvincing glowing.</p>

  <p>"Is it really fair to Tommy to let him think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't discuss Tommy," she said, "just leave
  it&mdash;<i>laissez</i>. You've no idea how things work out: Nature and
  Providence and Fate perform miracles."</p>

  <p>"But Tommy ought to be told; one can't make a fool of him."</p>

  <p>Her voice changed.</p>

  <p>"I shall not make a fool of Tommy. You're very rude to suggest that I
  should. At the right time I shall explain things, and Tommy will be just as
  happy and more."</p>

  <p>After dinner she left him, telling him where they were to meet, halfway
  down the sea front, near the road. Mr. Cornfort did not like going on the
  actual front: he was a very nervous man, besides which he attracted a lot of
  attention; and he was a very sensitive man: he didn't like the noise that
  pierrots and bands made, because he was a very weary man.</p>

  <p>Tommy was waiting near the bandstand when Dick came up, and apparently he
  was in his usually amiable mood.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful girl, isn't she, Dicky?" he said enthusiastically. "Such
  strength of mind and character, old boy! Took no notice of my
  tantrums&mdash;off she went to dinner with my best pal and left me flat.
  Would any other girl do that?"</p>

  <p>"Would any other fiancé stand it?" thought Dick.</p>

  <p>"I like character in a woman," Tommy went on, "though there are times when
  Mary shows just a little bit too much of it. We've had our little tiffs, old
  boy&mdash;lovers' quarrels and all that sort of thing." He dusted his knees
  complacently. "But she's always given in or I have. The point is, one of us
  usually 'fesses up that we're in the wrong. I might say it's always me who's
  in the wrong, but we take it in turns to admit it."</p>

  <p>"Why on earth did you tell her about that vacuum pump?"</p>

  <p>Tommy opened his blue eyes wide.</p>

  <p>"Did I, old boy? I don't see why I shouldn't."</p>

  <p>"But who told you?"</p>

  <p>"My butler told me, and I suppose Larkin told him.. And who told Larkin?
  You!" He pointed an accusing finger, and Dick was so staggered at having the
  war carried into his own country that he did not protest.</p>

  <p>"She's marvellous," Tommy went on. "She's knitting me a tie with my old
  school colours."</p>

  <p>Tommy was an old Etonian: it was the only thing he had ever done in life
  and he liked to tell the world about it through the medium of his
  neckwear.</p>

  <p>"And sew, my boy! She showed me some work the other night that you
  couldn't buy in a shop."</p>

  <p>His rhapsody was interrupted by the arrival of the inseparable three:
  Henry tugged at the handle, and kept up a regular, if funereal, pace; Mary
  walked by the side and a little behind the yellow chair; and Mr. Cornfort
  alternately dozed and stared. They followed the path that runs parallel a few
  feet from the road. It was getting quite dark, for though the night was warm
  it was cloudy.</p>

  <p>But it was very pleasant walking at her side, talking for the main part
  nonsense, hearing her low, sweet laughter. They were nearing the end of the
  long green strip which separates the beach from the road. Here pedestrians
  were few. Beyond lay the Crumbles.</p>

  <p>"I think we'll turn, Henry," said Mary.</p>

  <p>The bath chair came round at a leisured pace. Henry was bending to the
  pull when from nowhere appeared a small car, coming towards them at a furious
  pace: a black car with dim lamps; there was just enough light to distinguish
  its shape and make.</p>

  <p>"He's taking a risk, on the wrong side of the road."</p>

  <p>The driver's face was hidden behind monstrous motoring goggles. As Dick
  was speaking he slowed. Then the detective saw his hand come up and shoot
  forward. Something hurtled through the air, some black, swirling body that
  Dick with a thrill of horror instantly recognised. He leapt forward and up,
  fielded the missile, and, spinning round, with one motion he flung the thing
  into the sea.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;" began Mary.</p>

  <p>Just before the object touched water there was a terrific explosion.
  Something whizzed past with an angry burr; from behind them came the smash of
  breaking glass.</p>

  <p>And then a surprising thing happened. Henry, the bent chairman,
  straightened himself. Dick saw his hand stiffen upward. There was a staccato
  rattle of shots, and the car swerved dangerously, almost capsizing as it
  turned, and fled down a side road at an increasing pace.</p>

  <p>"I think I got him!" said Henry in a very calm and gentle voice.</p>

  <p>There was commotion enough on the beach; people were running; a mounted
  policeman came flying along towards them; Dick saw another policeman
  sprinting in their direction.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble? What was that explosion?"</p>

  <p>"A man threw a bomb from a car," Dick explained quickly. He said nothing
  about Henry's strange behaviour.</p>

  <p>"I thought I heard pistol shots, too. Which way did he go?"</p>

  <p>They pointed up the road where the car had vanished, and the mounted man
  went galloping after it.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes they were the centre of a large crowd. It was typical of
  Mr. Cornfort that he only opened his eyes to note the fact that he was an
  object of interest, and then fell into a deep sleep.</p>

  <p>The first sergeant of police who arrived Dick took on one side and
  revealed his profession.</p>

  <p>"It's a surprising thing, Inspector. You're sure it wasn't a
  firework?"</p>

  <p>"Not it," said Dick shaking his head. "You may find a casualty in one of
  these houses. I heard a window smash. No, it was a Mills bomb, and it was
  beautifully placed." He calculated that it would have fallen into Mr.
  Cornfort's lap, in which case Mr. Cornfort would have been asleep
  permanently.</p>

  <p>At last the crowd fell away and they moved on. Mary said nothing, but he
  saw in the failing light that her face was very pale.</p>

  <p>"It was splendid of you not to tell about Henry," she said in a low
  voice.</p>

  <p>Henry was the amazing feature of the evening to Dick; that silent and
  preoccupied man had been revealed as an expert gunman. Dick knew what pistol
  shooting was. This man was an adept.</p>

  <p>"Henry's rather like that. I think he must have been a soldier some
  time."</p>

  <p>"And do soldiers shoot at motorists?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"If they don't like them," she replied gently. They were talking under
  cover of Lord Weald's conversation, addressed indiscriminately to Henry and
  to the slumbering Mr. Cornfort. It was a conversation sprinkled with 'By
  Gads!' and it was made up with suggestions for the punishment of people who
  threw Mills bombs at invalids. Tommy was happy in that he needed neither the
  stimulation of agreement nor the provocation of dispute. His was one of those
  radiant natures that emit vocal energy unceasingly. The peculiar thing was
  that he had not seen Henry shoot, and as Henry was his chief audience, Tommy
  unwittingly deprived himself of a great deal of subject-matter.</p>

  <p>There was Henry pulling at the bath chair, slow and self-absorbed, an
  unshaven figure of a man&mdash;who could suspect a 48-calibre automatic
  hitting his leg with every stride he took?</p>

  <p>"Are you frightened?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"I was&mdash;after. I didn't realise at the time. It almost seemed as if
  he knew I'd told you."</p>

  <p>Dick stopped dead.</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"Herman Lavinski."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Don't stop, please, or Tommy will come back to us. I know it was
  Lavinski. That was his first recorded offence&mdash;throwing a bomb into a
  jeweller's shop. Not a fearfully dangerous one, but enough to scare everybody
  under the counter, during which he cleared out the window."</p>

  <p>"You know a lot about him," said Dick suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I'm a great student," she replied demurely; "and since I have known you,
  naturally I have taken a tremendous interest in crime."</p>

  <p>"If you laugh at me I shall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not in public," she said, in the same low voice. "Tommy will tell you
  that I'm rather a fanatic on the subject. Poor Henry!"</p>

  <p>"Why poor Henry?"</p>

  <p>"Because he'll get no sleep to-night, poor dear! He'll be sitting on the
  doorstep waiting for developments. Henry is a great optimist."</p>

  <p>"You're a puzzling lot of people," said Dick in despair.</p>

  <p>They had turned the corner of the road and the bath chair and Tommy were
  out of sight. They were in the darkest part of the promenade and nearly
  alone. As if by common agreement, their pace slackened to its slowest.</p>

  <p>"You'd better go now," she said softly, and put up her face to his.</p>

  <p>For a second he held her in his arms, his lips against hers, then gently
  she drew clear of him.</p>

  <p>"That's for not telling on Henry," she said breathlessly, and was
  gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HAPPINESS can keep a man awake as readily as trouble. It was
  past three o'clock before Dick Staines fell asleep, and he woke so light of
  heart that in the midst of his shaving there was a knock on the door and the
  chambermaid came in.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman next door says would you please stop singing, sir? He's
  suffering from nerves."</p>

  <p>Dick's roar of laughter was probably as disturbing as his song.</p>

  <p>He saw the girl only for a few minutes; a telephone message from Bourke
  urged him to come back to town at the earliest opportunity. Tommy came with
  him to the station, and Tommy's exuberance brought the first pang.</p>

  <p>"Everything's all right, old boy," said the jubilant young man. "We've
  made it up."</p>

  <p>"Made what up?" asked Dick. "I didn't know you'd quarrelled."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you weren't there!" said Tommy, remembering. "It was just before she
  went in with the dear old wreck. I asked her ... well, you know what I mean. I
  mean, it's quite the natural thing for a feller to do, and she gave me a
  perfectly frozen face and went inside without saying good-night. I toddled up
  and down broken-hearted, old boy."</p>

  <p>"Toddled up and down who?"</p>

  <p>"I mean outside the house," explained Tommy. "Then she came out into the
  garden. Old boy, she was divine!"</p>

  <p>If Tommy had struck him, Dick could not have had a greater and more
  hurtful shock.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by divine? Did you&mdash;kiss her?" he said
  desperately.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Tommy.</p>

  <p>"I give it up," groaned Dick.</p>

  <p>"You're always giving things up, old boy."</p>

  <p>Dick got into a first-class carriage by himself; his scowl terrified the
  only fellow-passenger that offered. It was so unpleasant that the gentleman
  dropped the handle as if it was something hot and scurried off down the train
  looking for a more agreeable companion.</p>

  <p>All the way to Town he was trying to reconcile the two Mary Danes he knew.
  Her double was more like her than she. How could she treat Tommy as she did?
  He remembered that she was almost rude when she snatched her hand away ... what
  was Tommy saying? Oh yes, her ring didn't fit her ...</p>

  <p>His power of volitionary thought ended here, paralysed by a
  revelation ... She had snatched her hand away ... the ring ... from some
  pigeon-hole in his mind came forth the recollection of something she said to
  him on the way to Victoria that night: "I told you a lie." He fell back in
  the corner of the carriage and gasped. For he knew the lie! All that was
  inexplicable was now plainly and understandably written.</p>

  <p>Bourke was waiting for him when he got to Scotland Yard, and the stout
  Superintendent had before him a whole sheaf of documents.</p>

  <p>"How did you get on to Lavinski?" was the first question he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they told you, did they?" laughed Dick. "I really didn't get on to
  him at all, but a young friend of mine offered the suggestion that that was
  the name of the Slough murderer."</p>

  <p>"How did she know?"</p>

  <p>"For the matter of that, how do you know it was a she?" challenged Dick,
  changing colour.</p>

  <p>"A little bird told me," said the Superintendent. "Anyway, it doesn't
  matter. I suppose you asked and the reply wasn't satisfactory. We'll leave it
  at that for the moment. The point is&mdash;here's the point."</p>

  <p>He turned over the documents and took out a square card covered with
  thumb-prints. The language, Dick saw, was German.</p>

  <p>"Convicted in Munich, 1911, Lavinski alias Stein, alias Griedlovitz, alias
  Paul Stammen. Speaks German and Russian with a broken accent; believed to be
  of English extraction."</p>

  <p>Bourke read German as easily as he read English. "Look at that
  thumb-print."</p>

  <p>Dick hadn't to look twice.</p>

  <p>"It's our man," he said. "How did you get it?"</p>

  <p>"Very fortunately, the police department attached to the German Embassy
  had a record of a number of English nationals who had been convicted in
  Germany."</p>

  <p>"The other embassies have the same, and I was intelligent enough to send
  round a memorandum asking if they'd give us particulars of Lavinski. I was
  hoping to get a photograph. By the way, the German description makes him a
  much thinner man, but he was very much younger then. It was for the same type
  of offence that he got time in Germany&mdash;shooting up a cashier and
  getting away with the pay-roll. We've got a later description of him, but the
  finger-print is the thing. If it hadn't been for the disorganisation of the
  embassy following the war, we'd have had this man&mdash;as it is, I've
  written across to the German Minister of Justice asking him to let us have a
  photograph. He may not be in England&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think he is, sir," said Dick. "If I were a betting man, that would be
  the certainty I should back."</p>

  <p>"Anyway we are using the Press," said the Superintendent. "I've circulated
  this description."</p>

  <p>He pushed the slip of paper across and Dick read from:</p>

  <p>"Wanted by the police in connection with a number of offences. Herman
  Lavinski ..." through all his aliases, to the end of the paragraph.</p>

  <p>"It will be in the last edition of the evening newspapers. I'm expecting
  that we shall have the usual crowd of reporters down, but nothing is to be
  said to connect this man with the Slough murder."</p>

  <p>When Dick reached Tommy Weald's house he saw two workmen coming through
  Mr. Derrick's open doorway. He had lost no time in repairing the damage that
  had been done to his wall, apparently. To his surprise, Derrick himself
  followed the workmen.</p>

  <p>"I am blocking up the secret passages of this fine old medieval castle,"
  he said cheerily. "Either I do that or I shall sell the house."</p>

  <p>"And leave the gold for somebody else to find," said Dick.</p>

  <p>Derrick smiled.</p>

  <p>"I've told you before, and I tell you again, the only gold in this house
  is on the picture-frames. Have you been out of Town?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I thought you were in Brighton&mdash;I saw your car at Lewes. The
  hostler told me you had gone on there."</p>

  <p>Mr. Derrick nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'd stayed the night at Brighton, but the place was terribly full ..."</p>

  <p>When a Brighton habitue starts to talk about Brighton, there is no room
  for any other subject of conversation.</p>

  <p>"The one good thing this business has done," Derrick went on, "is to show
  me how deuced uncomfortable this house is. I'm having it refurnished from top
  to bottom. Where are you dining tonight?"</p>

  <p>Dick pointed to Tommy Weald's residence. "At home," he said.</p>

  <p>Derrick laughed.</p>

  <p>"It must be almost like a home to you by now. Will you dine with me or
  shall I invite myself to dine with you?"</p>

  <p>Dick was glad enough to extend the invitation.</p>

  <p>Although he made light of these extraordinary happenings that had so
  distressed him, it was obvious to Dick that the strain was telling on
  Derrick. Behind his joviality was a hint of nervousness and apprehension.
  Over the dinner table he confided the astonishing fact that the one thing
  which really 'rattled' him was the ghost.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand that spook. Larkin is a very nice fellow, but has no
  imagination at all&mdash;he could not have invented it. Are you afraid of
  ghosts?"</p>

  <p>Dick smiled. He might have confessed, but did not, that he had been scared
  of more substantial things than ghosts in that house.</p>

  <p>"Not very, eh? Well, I am," confessed the owner heartily. "I'm so scared
  that I dare not spend a night there to catch him&mdash;Larkin says he comes
  regularly. And he's more frightened than I am!"</p>

  <p>"Why don't you allow me the free run of the place?"</p>

  <p>The other smiled good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"It seems you people have taken it. When I came here this morning I found
  two detectives inside and chased them out. But if you do hear or see
  anything, I'll tell Larkin to unfasten the upstairs window and leave the
  lights on the landing. Oh, by the way "&mdash;he took an evening newspaper
  out of his pocket&mdash;"who is this Lavinski? What is he wanted for?"</p>

  <p>"Quite a number of offences, including murder." Derrick looked at the
  sheet again and read the paragraph slowly.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't say murder. I suppose that's a little dodge of yours? By the
  way, Larkin says that the 'ghost' always appears from half-past eleven to
  twelve. So if you want to be thrilled to death, you might step in round about
  then."</p>

  <p>He was going to an hotel in Weybridge, a beautiful house, in a wooded
  park, which had the advantage of a private golf course.</p>

  <p>Dick spent the evening with a book. He was feeling tired. Once he went up
  to his own room, stepped on to the balcony, and saw that Mr. Derrick had been
  as good as his word and that the French windows were fastened by a catch
  which he could easily open from the outside.</p>

  <p>He came downstairs, read a little, scribbled a little, and thought much.
  He wondered if Mary would call him up. Hitherto he had been suspicious of
  these long-distance calls, but now&mdash;he smiled at his secret thought. By
  the evening post he had an intimation to the effect that his flat was
  available for his use, his tenants having decided to spend the rest of the
  period abroad. Ordinarily he would have been glad to have this news, but now
  he didn't very much care one way or the other. He had made himself very much
  at home in Tommy's best room. Poor old Tommy! How would he take it? he
  wondered. Or would he ever know? Yes, Dick thought he would know, and be very
  pleased. After all, this cheerful man had his moments of doubt concerning
  Mary. Without confiding as much, he had revealed something of his
  apprehension unconsciously. There were moments when Mary terrified him. Yes,
  Tommy would accept the situation in a good spirit.</p>

  <p>He looked up at the clock; it was twenty minutes to twelve and the ghost
  was due! He really did not take that ghost very seriously. At the same time,
  many things that he had not taken seriously had proved tragically
  disturbing.</p>

  <p>As he rose to go upstairs the 'phone bell rang.</p>

  <p>"Take this call from Margate," said a voice, and Dick purred inwardly.</p>

  <p>He waited an interminable time. Somebody else was talking on the
  line&mdash;a thin, high, woman's voice, speaking at a tremendous rate as
  though she realised the full value of a three-minute conversation and was
  anxious to crowd in every syllable. And then:</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Dick?"</p>

  <p>It was Mary's voice, hard with anxiety. Dick, is that you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear."</p>

  <p>"You haven't gone into Derrick's house, have you? Dick, I don't want you
  to go. I want you to promise me ..."</p>

  <p>The gabble of the other woman's voice grew faster and faster, drowning all
  other sounds but the soft undercurrent of the humming wires.</p>

  <p>"Dick... can you hear me, darling? I don't want you to go into&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Click! He was cut off. Again he heard the gabble, and that too died as
  suddenly. He jerked the hook savagely, called the local exchange.</p>

  <p>"I was cut off," he said. "Get me through at once."</p>

  <p>"What number, sir?"</p>

  <p>He did not know the number.</p>

  <p>"Hang up your receiver," came the monotonous instruction. "They will call
  you."</p>

  <p>He waited five minutes, but no call came through. Why was she anxious that
  he should not go into the house next door? The old ghost of suspicion rose in
  his mind&mdash;and a resolution also. He waited another four minutes, but the
  bell did not ring, and, running up the stairs, he passed through his room on
  to the balcony and swung across. With his finger he lifted the latch and
  pushed open the window. There was no sound. The door was wide open. He turned
  the switch; the lights had been cut off at the main, probably by Derrick's
  orders.</p>

  <p>He took a step forward, and for the second time in that room he was seized
  with an unaccountable terror, and in an instant was bathed in a cold
  perspiration. What was it? Danger of some kind ... that animal instinct of his
  was calling to him urgently, loudly, yet he could not interpret the
  message.</p>

  <p>He took one step on the landing. As he did so he felt the lightest of
  obstructions against his ankle. He was wearing silk socks, which was what may
  have saved his life&mdash;that and the cautiousness of his advance. It was a
  thread across the door. He drew back quickly and retreated to the balcony.
  And then he heard a man calling in an agitated voice; it was Minns.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Staines ... don't go into this house ... the young lady says there's a
  spring gun set on the stairs!"</p>

  <p>"Bring me my lamp," said Dick after a pause. "I left it by the side of my
  bed."</p>

  <p>The butler came back.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake be careful, sir."</p>

  <p>In spite of his preoccupation, Dick was amazed to hear the distress in the
  man's voice. For the first time this butler of Tommy's had shown himself
  human.</p>

  <p>Dick took the lamp from his hand and went back flashing a powerful beam
  ahead. There was the gun, so artfully concealed on the top stair that he
  might not have noticed it even if it had been light. He stepped delicately
  across the silken thread, keeping out of the way of that deadly muzzle, and,
  stooping, removed the cap and gently let down the trigger. It was
  old-fashioned, painfully so. The broad muzzle would have belched death at
  him, tearing his flesh to ribbons at so short a range.</p>

  <p>"Miss Dane is still on the 'phone, sir." It was the butler calling from
  the balcony.</p>

  <p>Dick went back and, going downstairs, took the last two minutes of the
  call.</p>

  <p>"Dick, is that you? Oh, Dick, did you go in? Oh, thank God you're safe!
  Did you see it?"</p>

  <p>"The gun? Yes, I jolly nearly found it. If I had had the sense to wait
  until you called up again."</p>

  <p>"Darling, I've nearly died at the end of this phone. Why did you go?"</p>

  <p>"How did you know it was there?"</p>

  <p>"I guessed&mdash;I swear I didn't know. I just guessed, from something I'd
  been told. Was it a gun?"</p>

  <p>Dick described it. He heard the quick intake of her breath.</p>

  <p>"I said 'spring gun,' but I wasn't sure. I knew it was something very,
  very deadly. Dick, you'll not go into that house again&mdash;will you promise
  me that?"</p>

  <p>And then he said a bold thing.</p>

  <p>"Will you promise me that you won't go in?" A long pause; an operator's
  voice intruded itself.</p>

  <p>"Your three minutes is up."</p>

  <p>"I promise," Mary spoke quickly, "not without you."</p>

  <p>Then they were cut off.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TOMMY WEALD sat down in his hotel sitting-room to take stock
  of himself. There were quite a number of people in the world who regarded
  this fresh-faced, young, irresponsible man of thirty as an easy mark. But
  Tommy Weald was no fool, and, if proof were necessary, his bailiff could have
  revealed quite a number of interesting facts. Contrary to the general belief
  the late Lord Weald was not a very rich man&mdash;he was certainly a careless
  one. He had left his estate in some confusion, and it had been Tommy who had
  shored up the tottering fortune of his house and most shrewdly rebuilt its
  foundation.</p>

  <p>Perhaps his patent innocence helped him. He had been 'let in' by
  acquaintances on the Stock Exchange to several good things. They expected him
  to speculate gently, and leave the fat pickings of the market to themselves;
  they were pardonably indignant when they found their novitiate gambling with
  the sang-froid of a hardened jobber, and, what is more, skimming the cream of
  the market.</p>

  <p>Tommy was no born manager of estates, but he had the knack of choosing the
  right men. He had found his reputation for innocence something of an asset,
  and had steered between many dangerous rocks, across many disastrous shoals,
  avoiding, in the process, a lady who was popularly believed to have a million
  of money but no personal attractions, at least two cousins, a charming widow
  or two, and divers detached and distantly related females.</p>

  <p>He ran his fingers through his untidy hair and stared solemnly at his
  reflection in the mirror&mdash;Tommy always sat before a looking-glass when
  he was alone and if there was one available, for he was a gregarious creature
  and loved company.</p>

  <p>And here was the fact that the Earl of Weald had to face: for the first
  time in his life he was desperately in love with a girl who, from
  self-consciousness or some other cause, treated him, in his own words, like a
  beastly poodle by day and by night was to him the most adorable and most
  loving of women.</p>

  <p>Tommy had none of the uncomfortable thoughts which usually beset a man in
  his position. He had no relations to please or displease, for his aunts, if
  the truth be told, were so many pegs on which he could hang timely excuses.
  They were timorous old ladies very much in awe of their nephew. He had money.
  The woman he loved, so far as he could judge by voice and manner, was a lady
  (he never even speculated upon this) and, except for her unfortunate shyness
  or awkwardness or whatever was the disturbing quality which made her so
  impossible in daytime, adored him.</p>

  <p>An aunt had rather diffidently raised the only objection in the course of
  a letter which was filled with reserved congratulation:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"One, of course, must know her people. Many modern young
  girls have the most presentable manners and are indistinguishable from ladies
  and members of a good family until one meets their relations ..."</p><br>

  <p>Tommy replied to that, hotly.</p>

  <p>He was marrying Mary and not her relations, but he was quite prepared to
  discover that they earned a precarious livelihood in the ancient and
  honourable profession of rag-pickers, he said romantically.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he had his uneasy moments. There were a few gritting the
  slides of life, even now.</p>

  <p>He had not dressed for dinner, and sat watching the slow minute hand of
  the clock on the mantelpiece move imperceptibly towards the hour of his
  rendezvous&mdash;it was not remarkable that he should be waiting outside the
  charmed house a quarter of an hour too soon.</p>

  <p>There was a diversion to occupy his mind. He had passed, at the corner of
  the road, a very inebriated gentleman who sang, as he staggered, a song about
  love. Tommy watched him reel through the drizzle, and long after he had
  passed out of sight his melancholy cadences were yet audible. He saw a
  movement near the house, and a dim figure melted out of the bushes near the
  doorway and came towards him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Tommy, I didn't know it was raining," she said, her voice full of
  self-reproach as she opened the gate and led him on to the dark lawn. "How
  mean of me I could have come out before."</p>

  <p>"Nothing, dear old thing, nothing," said Tommy briskly. "If I waited till
  it stopped raining, I should never see you. How's that jolly old rascal
  Cornfort?"</p>

  <p>"He has gone to bed," said the girl as she slipped her arm in his. "He's
  terribly tired."</p>

  <p>There was a canvas swing in the garden, and above, a most substantial
  awning which would have kept out the ultra-violet rays of the sun if the sun
  had ever shown itself, and did, in point of fact, serve as a protection from
  the heavy showers of rain, which were not infrequent.</p>

  <p>Tommy sat down by his companion's side and put his arm about her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Tommy, you're purring," she said in alarm.</p>

  <p>He accepted the accusation as a compliment. Her head sank lower on his
  shoulder, he drooped his head and her velvet cheek was against his. They must
  have looked very silly, but nobody saw them; and two people in such
  circumstances can never look silly except in one another's eyes.</p>

  <p>Presently Tommy straightened up.</p>

  <p>"Mary, my darling," he said, "I've got a fearfully important question to
  ask you."</p>

  <p>He heard her sigh.</p>

  <p>"Tommy, I hate answering fearfully important questions."</p>

  <p>But he was determined.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you awfully keen on Dick Staines?" She thought this matter
  over.</p>

  <p>"I like him," she said thoughtfully; "from what I have seen of him he
  seems rather nice."</p>

  <p>"Honestly, Mary"&mdash;he cleared his throat, for he was putting a
  question which, properly and satisfactorily answered, would sweep away a
  great deal of the unhappiness which clouded his waking
  moments&mdash;"honestly, aren't you in love with him a little bit? I mean,
  he's a shriekingly good-looking chap, and I know I'm a perfectly ghastly
  sight&mdash;every time I look at a baby it goes blue in the face, it's a
  fact!&mdash;what I mean to say is, don't you think you would be happier
  with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What nonsense you talk, Tommy!" There was a little touch of petulance in
  her voice. "I don't know why, but I love you better than anybody in the
  world. Do you believe that?"</p>

  <p>"Believe what?" asked Tommy, who was always cautious at the wrong moment.
  "That you don't know why?"</p>

  <p>She sat bolt upright.</p>

  <p>"Of course I don't know why. Does any girl, Tommy? If I am in love with
  you, which I suppose I am, is it remarkable that I shouldn't know why?"</p>

  <p>Here was a problem in psychology which could not readily be solved. Tommy
  liked a reason for everything&mdash;even for falling in love. And it had
  seemed to him that, in the daytime, at any rate, Mary's attitude was
  distinctly frigid, especially in Dick Staines' presence.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," he said with satisfaction. "The truth is, old darling,
  I've been fearfully worried. You and old Dicky get on so well together, you
  have your secret palavers, and there have been moments when I've been
  frantically jealous."</p>

  <p>She squeezed his arm gently.</p>

  <p>"Then you've been frantically foolish," she said.</p>

  <p>The house where Mr. Cornfort had his lodgings was on the corner of two
  roads, and the large gardens were flanked by low-cut hedges. From where they
  sat the front door was obscured by clumps of rhododendrons, which also hid
  half the tiled path to the gate, which was not only in view in the daylight
  but even at night. Beyond the pathway the ground sloped down to a sunken
  garden, so that anybody passing to the gate from the house showed against the
  'skyline.'</p>

  <p>Tommy's hearing was particularly acute. He heard the front door open and
  close softly and the faint crunch of feet, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook free of his arm and sat up.</p>

  <p>"What was it?"</p>

  <p>Before he could answer the figure of a man came into view. He limped
  quickly across their line of vision, they heard the squeak of the gate and he
  disappeared in the darkness of the roadway.</p>

  <p>"Jumping snakes!" gasped Tommy. "That's old Cornfort!"</p>

  <p>He had seen the thin face, the mop of grey hair, the long, hawk-like
  nose.</p>

  <p>"I thought you said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, Tommy!" Her voice was sharp. "Mr. Cornfort's in bed. That was
  another lodger." He looked round at her slowly.</p>

  <p>"Mary," he said, "you lie in your boots, old dear! If that's not the late,
  or nearly late, Mr. Cornfort, I'll eat my right ear!"</p>

  <p>For a second she was too taken aback to answer.</p>

  <p>"You're probably right," she said with devastating coolness. "But why
  shouldn't he take a little exercise now and again?"</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, in spite of her calm manner, he detected a tremor of
  agitation in her voice when she asked this audacious question.</p>

  <p>"Wait," she said, and ran across the lawn, disappearing into the
  house.</p>

  <p>Presently she came out, followed by a man whom Tommy recognised as Henry.
  Henry had been something of a puzzle to Lord Weald. He had never quite known
  whether the bath chairman was a permanency; certainly he was unaware until
  that moment that Henry had lodgings in the house of his employer.</p>

  <p>The girl and the man talked together quickly in a low voice, and Tommy
  thought he heard the chairman say. "Damn!"&mdash;which in a bath chairman
  seemed near to profanity. Henry hurried out into the road and he also
  disappeared. She waited for a few seconds, looking over the gate, and then
  came slowly back and sat down by Tommy's side.</p>

  <p>"It is really nothing," she said, "Mr. Cornfort has these little fits of
  energy, but I don't like him to go out alone. He may have a fit of vertigo
  and fall over a cliff or something."</p>

  <p>"Which would give him a nasty taste in his mouth," said Tommy flippantly.
  "Old Cornfort! Fancy the old blighter being hauled around in a chair all day
  and trotting about all night on his flat feet!"</p>

  <p>"We like to encourage him to walk," said the girl hastily.</p>

  <p>He had an idea that she was listening, as all her senses showed, for some
  sound, he knew not what. When, a few streets away, a motor-cycle backfired
  incessantly she nearly jumped from her feet.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" she gasped. Her voice was agitated.</p>

  <p>"Sounds like a motor-bike to me," said Tommy, but when he put his arm
  around her she was trembling from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"I'm a terrible coward"&mdash;her voice quavered&mdash;"I wish I had the
  courage&mdash;" She stopped short.</p>

  <p>"You've got plenty of courage, old dear. It's this beastly job trotting
  round after the poor old ditherer that gets you rattled," said Tommy.</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>This time there was no question as to the noise. It was the sound of a
  shot, clear and unmistakable. The girl sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Tommy!" she gasped. "I wish he hadn't!"</p>

  <p>And then came the sound of running feet.</p>

  <p>"Let me go," said an angry voice.</p>

  <p>The gate was flung open and Mr. Cornfort sprawled in as though he had been
  violently pushed from behind.</p>

  <p>Henry followed, closed the gate and leant over. Tommy thought he saw
  something glitter in the chairman's hand.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>Henry looked round. It seemed that he was only then aware of the visitor's
  presence.</p>

  <p>"No, my lord, nothing's wrong. I shouldn't sit out here if I were you,
  young lady."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Somebody," was the ambiguous reply. Then, to Tommy: "Did you see anybody,
  my lord, when you came in?"</p>

  <p>"There was a fellow at the corner of the street rather tight," said Tommy,
  remembering the appearance of the inebriated wayfarer.</p>

  <p>A policeman came into sight under a street lamp. He crossed the road.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear somebody shooting?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir." Henry's voice was almost humble. "There's been a motor-cycle
  exploding round here."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, as though by a prearranged signal and to confirm his
  explanation of the sound, came another back-fire and a quick succession of
  loud pops from the distance.</p>

  <p>"That's what it was, eh?" The policeman teemed relieved. "After that
  bomb-throwing I've been set to keep an eye on the house. I happened to go
  round the corner to see my friend on the next beat ... I didn't half get a
  fright!"</p>

  <p>He chatted for a few seconds and then walked along the road. Henry came
  slowly back to where they sat.</p>

  <p>"I think I should go now if I were you, sir." He was very respectful and
  apparently undisturbed by any adventures through which he might have
  passed.</p>

  <p>Before Tommy could reply, a voice called urgently from the door.</p>

  <p>"Hurry. Come and get your arm dressed quickly."</p>

  <p>It was Cornfort speaking, and for one on the verge of eternity there was
  considerable vigour in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt?" The girl's voice was almost a wail.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, nothing at all," said Henry, showing his first sign of
  impatience. "A scratch, my dear, a bush caught my&mdash;er&mdash;sleeve."</p>

  <p>Then it was that Tommy saw he was holding his left arm a little above the
  wrist.</p>

  <p>"Darling, you <i>are</i> hurt!" said the girl, almost tearfully and Tommy
  nearly dropped.</p>

  <p>"Darling?" Was ever bath chairman addressed in such endearing terms?</p>

  <p>"Miss Dane, you are entirely mistaken." The chairman's voice was very
  firm. "Now, Lord Weald, you would greatly oblige me if you went home."</p>

  <p>In the confusion of farewell the girl disappeared. Tommy had hardly left
  the house when he heard her call him back.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Tommy."</p>

  <p>He turned to kiss her cold lips.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully frightened to-night. Tommy, I'm so terribly wicked&mdash;I
  was never meant to be ..."</p>

  <p>Before he could ask for an explanation she had gone.</p>

  <p>"Dashed extraordinary!" said Tommy aloud, and strode fiercely back to the
  hotel. He kept a lookout for the drunken man, but did not see him. Nearing
  the front, he found himself following a stocky individual who might have been
  the songbird he had seen earlier in the evening.</p>

  <p>He walked more quickly to overtake the suspect, but, as if he knew he was
  being followed, the man walked faster. They came to the fringe of a carnival
  party either going to or returning from a dance, and his quarry disappeared
  before Lord Weald could make his acquaintance.</p>

  <p>For a long time that night Tommy sat on the edge of his bed, with folded
  arms, frowning at the ineffective wallpaper. There were one or two things
  that the future Lady Weald must be taught&mdash;as, for example, the bad
  form of addressing bath chairmen in terms of excessive endearment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. WALTER DERRICK confessed to having an equable nature.
  Few men whose houses were marked by gangs of armed burglars, who had suffered
  the outrages which had been his, had been subjected to the horror of having
  murder done in their dining-rooms, would have accepted so philosophically the
  amazing sequence of events which had punctuated recent weeks.</p>

  <p>"My equanimity," he told the reporter of the <i>Post Herald</i>, "is
  nine-tenths laziness, a sheer disinclination to trouble my head about things
  I cannot rectify or put right&mdash;laziness is my pet vice. My house is an
  extraordinary house. Something alarming is always happening there. A week ago
  a man who claimed acquaintance with me during my stay in Africa was found
  dead there. A few nights later a portion of the wall of my drawing-room was
  excavated, and certain rumours I have heard, coupled with mysterious
  inquiries which have come to me from the police, and especially from my
  friend Inspector Staines, lead me to suppose that yet another outrage was
  attempted or committed only a couple of nights ago."</p>

  <p>"Is the house haunted?"</p>

  <p>"One of my servants swears that he has seen the ghost of my father! But
  that, of course, is a trick, and a particularly cruel trick."</p>

  <p>"What do you imagine the burglars are after?" asked the newspaper man.</p>

  <p>Mr. Derrick smiled broadly.</p>

  <p>"What are we all after?" he demanded. "Money! The theory has been advanced
  by one of the most brilliant police officers at Scotland Yard that my father
  hoarded a large sum of money in some secret place. That may, of course, be
  true. If it is, then it is better that I should find it than my
  persecutors&mdash;I, at least, would pay to the Inland Revenue the additional
  death duties! I do not, however, imagine for one moment that my father did
  anything so stupid or so secretive. His death, though he was an invalid, was
  very sudden, and he had no opportunity of discussing his affairs at the last,
  but I feel sure that if there had been any money hidden he would have told me
  during the last years of his life."</p>

  <p>Dick Staines read this interview whilst he was still in bed. He had been
  in a state of wonder that the murder in Lowndes Square and all the peculiar
  events which had preceded and followed had attracted so little attention.
  Reporters had called and had received the usual vague statements which
  police officers issue on such occasions. But the episode of the spring gun
  (which had not been reported) had shaken him surprisingly. Neither Larkin nor
  Walter Derrick could offer him any explanation. Derrick was certain that when
  he had walked down the stairs five minutes before he left the house, no such
  trap had been laid. Larkin was equally emphatic. Unless there was another way
  into the house, as yet undiscovered, how could the gun have been placed in
  position and the 'leads' so carefully adjusted? There had been workmen in the
  house&mdash;Dick saw the foreman, who assured him that none of the men had
  ascended beyond the drawing-room floor. Examined at Scotland Yard, the gun
  proved to be of a type common enough some years ago in country
  districts&mdash;a muzzle-loaded, big-jawed musket, the barrel sawn off to
  within a few inches of the lock.</p>

  <p>On his return to Town, after giving an interview with the reporters in
  Lowndes Square, Walter accompanied Dick to Scotland Yard and examined the
  machine. No sooner did his eyes fall upon it than he uttered an
  exclamation.</p>

  <p>"That is mine," he said.</p>

  <p>When he had bought Keyley he had found in the stable, amongst a lot of
  other rubbish, this old spring gun. He pointed out the half-obliterated crown
  stamped in the brass butt plate and two notches cut in the grip.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen it for months&mdash;years. Oh yes, I have," he corrected
  himself quickly. "I showed it to Tommy Weald last Sunday week, and he
  suggested I should send it to a museum."</p>

  <p>Which was rather like Tommy&mdash;he was very public-spirited with other
  people's properties.</p>

  <p>"There was also an old powder-horn which probably belongs to the set,"
  Walter went on, "but I don't remember seeing any bullets."</p>

  <p>He had taken a surprising resolution&mdash;at least it was surprising to
  Dick.</p>

  <p>"I am trying to decide to spend a week in my haunted house, and do a
  little gold-digging myself," he smiled. "I can't persuade my servants at
  Keyley to come back to Lowndes Square, for the reputation of the house has
  been quite sufficient to scare them stiff, so I am relying on Larkin to
  assist."</p>

  <p>"If you would care for me to share your watch&mdash;" said Dick.</p>

  <p>Walter nodded.</p>

  <p>"That was my idea. I can't make you as comfortable as Weald does, but I
  may be able to give you a more exciting time!"</p>

  <p>They walked up to the house together, and, just before Derrick went
  in:</p>

  <p>"You were telling me the other day about old Endred, the local inspector.
  He seems to know a great deal more about my father than I do. I suppose there
  is no objection to my having a chat with him?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you know him?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>Walter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I have no recollection of him. So far as I can ascertain, although he
  knew my father very well, he never met me&mdash;I was at school in
  Northumberland until I was seventeen."</p>

  <p>With the aid of Larkin and a couple of charwomen that the caretaker was
  able to engage, Mr. Derrick had restored something like order and tidiness to
  his outraged drawing-room. A square of canvas still covered the hole in the
  wall when old Inspector Endred called that afternoon. He was in mufti, for he
  was off duty, as he explained.</p>

  <p>"I never make any private calls in uniform, Mr. Derrick," said the grim
  old man. "I am one of those old-fashioned police officers who do not mix
  business with pleasure."</p>

  <p>He looked round the drawing-room curiously.</p>

  <p>"It must be fifteen years since I was here as a visitor," he said.
  "Fifteen years! And it seems like yesterday!"</p>

  <p>He pointed to an old grandfather's chair near the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"That was your respected father's favourite chair," he said. "I'd like a
  fiver for every time I've seen him there!"</p>

  <p>"Did we ever meet?" asked Walter, interested. The inspector shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, you were at school at the time, if I remember rightly: The only
  occasion you were down in London I was away on leave, but I knew your father
  very well, and a very nice man he was. He wasn't popular with some people,
  but I speak of a man as I find him."</p>

  <p>The inspector was a loquacious old gentleman with a fund of
  reminiscences&mdash;the sort of man, Walter supposed, who lived on as well as
  in the past.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I knew him quite well; but I had no idea that he had married
  again&mdash;I suppose you didn't know, either?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Mr. Derrick; "that was news to me."</p>

  <p>"It was news to a lot of us," said the inspector, shaking his head, "but I
  always say that nobody really knows anybody."</p>

  <p>"How did you come to be acquainted with my father? He is hardy likely to
  have been very much interested in police affairs."</p>

  <p>The inspector smiled broadly.</p>

  <p>"We came into touch over the finger-print business, and after I was
  shifted to N Division I still used to correspond with him. As a matter of
  fact, Mr. Derrick, I am of the same opinion as your father. I believe there
  are duplicates to fingerprints. It stands to reason that the present system
  can't be infallible, when less than a fortieth part of the population can be
  examined and checked. Do you see what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," said Walter frankly.</p>

  <p>The inspector was now riding his hobby-horse, and apparently he held views
  even more drastic than those held by the late Mr. Derrick. It was more than
  possible that old Derrick had his first lessons in scepticism, and had been
  started on his hobby, as a result of his acquaintance with this grey-haired
  police officer.</p>

  <p>"Suppose there was a dance on at the Albert Hall," said Endred with
  relish, "and there were two thousand people present, and a complaint came
  that a lady had lost a diamond necklace? Do you follow me, Mr. Derrick?"</p>

  <p>Walter nodded.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I had permission to search the crowd, the whole two thousand, and
  instead of searching two thousand I searched fifty and gave the others a
  clean bill. Would that be fair? It is the same with the finger-print system.
  The only prints we have are criminals'&mdash;the law-abiding population never
  comes under review. And it is any odds that if you were to take the
  finger-prints of the forty million people in this country, you'd find
  duplicates, and once you'd found a solitary duplicate, the whole finger-print
  system would collapse!"</p>

  <p>"That was my father's view, too," said Derrick thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"And it was a good view," insisted Inspector Endred emphatically. "That is
  what your revered father was trying to prove. He had finger-prints by the
  thousand&mdash;by the hundreds of thousands&mdash;on criminals, clergymen,
  bankers&mdash;everybody he could get to give him a print."</p>

  <p>He was amused at a recollection.</p>

  <p>"It's curious how people jibbed at it, though! Even the most innocent
  people objected to giving themselves away. I must confess," he chuckled,
  "that when he asked me for my own finger-impressions for the family book, I
  didn't at all like the idea!"</p>

  <p>"The family book?" said Derrick quickly. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Endred's eyes were dancing with laughter.</p>

  <p>"You've forgotten it, too. I forget nothing. I've got a memory like a card
  index, Mr. Derrick. I remember that book&mdash;a little red book with padded
  leather covers. His finger-print was in it, and yours, and his
  housekeeper&mdash;you wouldn't remember her, she died when you were a
  child&mdash;and Miss Belfer, and his sister&mdash;she's dead, too&mdash;and
  his partner, old Carlew. I suppose it was a great honour for him to ask me at
  all, but I didn't like putting my finger on the pad, and that's the
  truth."</p>

  <p>There was a silence, and then Derrick said slowly:</p>

  <p>"Of course! I remember now. His little private book. The family book! I
  must have been about fifteen when he called me up to his study and asked me
  to put my finger-print on the page&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Four fingers and thumb," nodded Endred. "Just the same as they do it at
  the police station. The fact is, your father was a fanatic on the
  subject."</p>

  <p>Derrick sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>"Yes. A strange man. It is curious how I'd forgotten that little incident!
  I don't remember having seen the book since."</p>

  <p>"It is in the house somewhere, I'll bet," said Endred. "I wonder you don't
  find it&mdash;it would be rather a curiosity, Mr. Derrick."</p>

  <p>Derrick was looking out of the window, his attention concentrated upon a
  horse-drawn milk cart. The horse, unattended, was straying across the
  road.</p>

  <p>"That's very dangerous," he said, pointing, "the way these milkmen allow
  their horses to wander ... A little red book with padded covers&mdash;I recall
  it now. Rather like an autograph album. Do you remember if my Mother's was
  there?"</p>

  <p>The inspector shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, that is hardly likely. He hadn't got the finger-print craze when
  your respected mother died, but I believe there was an old aunt, because he
  pointed the prints out to me and said that the index finger was almost
  exactly like another print that he had taken of a chimpanzee at the Zoo!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Derrick turned the conversation to the neighbourhood, and the old
  religious Order that had occupied his house, and Mr. Endred plunged
  immediately into a learned and authoritative dissertation enriched by his
  recollections of divers eccentric religious bodies he had met with in his
  time.</p>

  <p>As the inspector was leaving the house Dick Staines came from the house
  next door.</p>

  <p>"Hallo, Inspector!" Dick's curiosity was piqued. "Is anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, nothing," said the old man genially. "I've just been having a
  little chat with Mr. Derrick about old times."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord, yes!" said Dick, remembering. "I gave him your address."</p>

  <p>He was going in the same direction as the older man, and they walked away
  together.</p>

  <p>"Calling at the Yard, are you, Mr. Staines? That's curious, so am I. I'm
  finishing the last thirty-five days of my service, and there's some talk of
  getting me a testimonial. In principle I am against allowing constables to
  subscribe to presentations. It is against the best interests of the Service,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But," smiled Dick, "when a veteran of your record retires, I'm all for
  producing a silver teapot and a nicely inscribed salver. You've got to
  surrender your principles, Inspector."</p>

  <p>He called a taxi and, Endred protesting, he pushed him in.</p>

  <p>"Exercise is a splendid thing, but it can be overdone," he said. "Well,
  how is Mr. Walter Derrick looking?"</p>

  <p>"A fine man that," said Endred solemnly; "a regular chip off the old
  block. I never met a more good-natured gentleman in my life. I happened to
  mention about the presentation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And he offered to subscribe a hundred guineas."</p>

  <p>Endred gasped.</p>

  <p>"Did he tell you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I guessed," said Dick, a twinkle in his eye.</p>

  <p>"Of course I couldn't allow that&mdash;" began Endred.</p>

  <p>"I should surrender my principles once more. Anyway, you deserve it. There
  are no rich prizes for a foot-slogging uniformed inspector, and if the
  taxpayer who has helped to starve you all his life wants to make up for his
  neglect, and give you a little bonus, well, let him!"</p>

  <p>Old Endred looked relieved.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," he confided, "I've got his cheque in my pocket.
  That's what I'm seeing the Assistant Commissioner about. I don't want to
  break any regulations so near to the end of my service, but if he says it's
  all right!"</p>

  <p>Dick knew the old inspector rather well, and guessed that many influential
  and moneyed people in the neighbourhood had heard the story of his retirement
  and his objection to presentations on principle, but his willingness, if his
  superiors agreed, to accept some small honorarium. Probably Derrick was to be
  a test case, and, if the 'principle' was admitted, Inspector Endred would
  carry quite a number of handsome little cheques to solace his days of
  retirement.</p>

  <p>"... mostly we discussed finger-prints, which was his old father's hobby,
  as I've told you before. It's funny what tricks memory plays on a fellow! He
  didn't even remember the family book."</p>

  <p>"What was the family book?" asked Dick, who was hardly listening to the
  voluble officer's recital.</p>

  <p>Inspector Endred told him of the little red book with the padded covers;
  he described its binding, its shape, and the approximate number of its
  pages.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" Dick sat bolt upright, looking at the old man. "Do you remember it
  very well?" he asked quickly. "Who else was in the book?"</p>

  <p>Endred recited the names he could remember: it was doubtful if he missed
  one.</p>

  <p>"And I think there were no more, unless there were some after mine," he
  said proudly. "I forget nothing. I've a memory like a card index, as I told
  Mr. Derrick. I can see the old man sitting down there and writing underneath
  the print my name, the year I was born, where I lived, and everything! And I
  remember his limping up and down the room, laying down the law about the
  system. Endred,' he says to me ..."</p>

  <p>At that moment Dick signalled the cab to stop. They had turned on to the
  Thames Embankment and were within a short distance of Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"I'll go in if you don't mind. The Assistant Commissioner gave me an
  appointment." Endred looked at his large watch. "Dear me, I've only a
  minute."</p>

  <p>Dick let him go and paid the cabman at his leisure. He walked slowly down
  towards the entrance of the Yard, and then noticed a man standing on the
  kerb. His back was towards the detective, but the figure was familiar. Where
  had he seen him? He walked slowly past and looked at him sideways, and then
  stopped.</p>

  <p>"Why, Henry!" he said in amazement.</p>

  <p>It was the unshaven bath chairman who was drawing meditatively at a clay
  pipe, and his eyes were fixed upon the pageant of the river.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HE was not particularly startled; he was not even surprised.
  He gave Dick the impression that nothing in the world had ever succeeded in
  agitating him.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, sir."</p>

  <p>His voice was soft and deferential. He had a queer little droop of his
  head, which was almost like a bow.</p>

  <p>"This is a beautiful place. To me the river is even more interesting that
  the sea. Look at that tug and those barges, like a swan with a number of ugly
  ducklings! One wonders what sort of a life these bargemen live&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When you have finished being philosophical, Henry, will you tell me why
  you are in London, and what poor Mr. Cornfort is doing in the meantime, to
  say nothing of Miss Dane?"</p>

  <p>The bath chairman looked at him reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Cornfort is in bed," he said in a hushed voice. "I fear he may never
  use the bath chair again."</p>

  <p>"As bad as that, eh?" said Dick cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, you can't live forever."</p>

  <p>Henry was pained.</p>

  <p>"And Miss Dane?"</p>

  <p>Henry shook his head.</p>

  <p>"She is in Town, sir, making inquiries about something she lost in London.
  An inconsiderable trinket, but very precious to her. Young girls have their
  peculiar fancies, Mr. Staines, and it is difficult to plumb the minds of
  youth."</p>

  <p>Dick was amused, a little irritated, too. He had a feeling that this man
  was secretly laughing at him.</p>

  <p>"And who is looking after Mr. Cornfort?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Henry's face fell.</p>

  <p>"Three trained nurses," he said in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>Dick looked round at the arched entrance to Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"Is she in there?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so, sir."</p>

  <p>"But that isn't the place she would go to make inquiries about lost
  property. It is farther along." He pointed.</p>

  <p>Henry followed the direction of his finger and seemed interested in the
  low-roofed building the gesture indicated.</p>

  <p>"Is that so, sir?" he asked interestedly. "I'm afraid Miss Dane has only a
  rudimentary acquaintance with police procedure. I have an idea that her loss
  was of such importance that she was seeking an interview with the Chief
  Constable."</p>

  <p>Dick gaped at him.</p>

  <p>"With the Chief Constable? Bourke?" Henry nodded.</p>

  <p>"She is a peculiar young lady who invariably makes it her business to go
  to the fountain head."</p>

  <p>Dick examined the man carefully, but the blue eyes met his scrutiny with
  the least effort at evasion.</p>

  <p>"You speak rather nicely for a bath chairman," said Dick. "What were you
  before you engaged in this profession?"</p>

  <p>Henry for a moment looked embarrassed and coughed behind his gloved hand.
  Dick noticed that, as he raised this hand, his action was stiff and that he
  winced. He wondered what had happened to his arm.</p>

  <p>"In my youth I was a professional prize-fighter," he said, and Dick was
  staggered. "It is rather difficult to believe that a man of my meagre
  physique could have ever had any success in such an arduous profession," said
  Henry, speaking with the greatest precision; "and in order to tone down the
  shock I would explain to you that I was also a teacher of mathematics at a
  very honourable university. I found pugilism was more lucrative, though it
  was somewhat disastrous to my scholastic career."</p>

  <p>"A light-weight?" asked Dick, unconvinced.</p>

  <p>"A feather-weight," said Henry gravely. "I am the only man who ever
  knocked out Digger Bill Ferrers. He fell asleep in the thirteenth round, and
  was never the same man afterwards."</p>

  <p>Dick looked at the man suspiciously. Was his leg being pulled by this mild
  dragger of bath chairs? Before he could ask a question he saw Mary Dane come
  into view. She was walking quickly, but checked her pace at the sight of the
  detective. Henry regarded their meeting with great imperturbability. Dick had
  the suspicion that he was mildly amused.</p>

  <p>"I suppose Henry's told you the news about Mr. Cornfort?"</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?" asked Dick brutally, and she looked at him
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"How brutal you are! Of course he isn't. The poor old man is in bed."</p>

  <p>"And you've come up to Scotland Yard to make an inquiry about
  a&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Whatever Henry told you it was," she interrupted calmly enough. "Please
  don't cross-examine me on the King's highway! I think your Mr. Bourke is
  rather a darling."</p>

  <p>"I will convey your views to him," said Dick. She was looking at him
  thoughtfully, biting that red nether lip of hers, and then:</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Henry, you needn't wait. Mr. Staines is taking me to tea at
  Sollingers'. Let's walk through the park&mdash;I like parks."</p>

  <p>"So I understand," said Dick.</p>

  <p>He looked back over his shoulder. Henry was still standing where they had
  left him, his contemplative eye on the river.</p>

  <p>"Where's his bath chair?" he demanded. "I should have thought that he
  would at least have brought that interesting mustard-coloured vehicle to
  Town&mdash;he looks almost naked without it! I should have loved to see you
  both being held up by a traffic cop!"</p>

  <p>"You're being rather unpleasant this afternoon," she said. "I never use
  bath chairs. I am taking you away from your work, which is selfish of
  me&mdash;but I'm not feeling a bit penitent."</p>

  <p>"You are my work," he said, "and my worry."</p>

  <p>He did not provoke her to a reply.</p>

  <p>They crossed to Whitehall, into the park gates, and their walk slowed to a
  saunter, which is a pace appropriate to parks.</p>

  <p>"How is the ghost?" she asked as they lounged along the edge of the
  lake.</p>

  <p>"Not so well," said Dick. "He has given up his bath chair and has taken to
  bed."</p>

  <p>"You mean Mr. Cornfort? How absurd you are!"</p>

  <p>"I meant the gun-laying ghost."</p>

  <p>"Did they nearly get you? My dear, I was worried ill that night! I hope
  you will never feel as I did. It was horrid!"</p>

  <p>"What made you think there was a spring gun in the house?"</p>

  <p>"Instinct," she said, and he knew that she was speaking the truth. "I
  suppose when a woman feels as I do towards a man, her intelligence is
  sharpened to a point where instinct gets a chance of operating. I thought I
  would die as I sat by that telephone waiting to hear your voice; Dick, you're
  not taking any more chances?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I am."</p>

  <p>She stopped dead and looked at him, her lips parted, her eyes wide with
  fear.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Derrick is coming back to live here, and he has asked me to sleep on
  the premises."</p>

  <p>She said nothing, but slowly resumed her walk. "When do you go in?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, I think&mdash;Tommy hasn't said when he's returning
  "&mdash;and then, as he remembered&mdash;"he is probably in Town."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No. I told him I was coming back to-night."</p>

  <p>"And aren't you?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Henry rather wanted to see a theatre, and I promised him he should." And
  then she went off at a tangent. "I like your Inspector
  Bourke&mdash;Superintendent, is he?&mdash;well, whatever he is! He's a nice,
  fat darling of a man. He was very severe at first, but we became quite good
  friends."</p>

  <p>"What did you see him about?"</p>

  <p>"I lost a bangle," she said. "Why do you make me lie? I saw him about the
  bomb-throwing. As a matter of fact, he wrote to me and asked me to come to
  see him. I suppose you know the municipality of Eastbourne has offered a
  reward of £200?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded. He had seen the announcement in the paper. Moreover, that
  evening of his in Eastbourne had kept him fully occupied since he came back
  to Town. Dick tried to question her about several matters in which he was
  interested, but very skilfully she headed him off, and they reached the great
  departmental store without his being any the wiser. She had some purchases to
  make, she told him, and went by the elevator to the fourth floor, and he
  waited at the entrance of the inquiry bureau.</p>

  <p>He knew this department very well. Here letters could be written and
  received. There were half-a-dozen writing tables for the use of customers,
  and the room was fairly well filled, mainly by women. He had often speculated
  upon the value of such a department as this to the criminally minded man or
  woman. He knew at least one unpleasant case that had its focal point in a
  pigeon-hole behind the polished mahogany counter. Presently he saw Mary Dane
  come in and go to one of the girl attendants and ask a question. The
  attendant shook her head, made a rapid search of a pigeon-hole, and came back
  with another head-shake. Then Mary saw him, smiled, and waved her hand in
  greeting.</p>

  <p>"How dreadful!" she said, with mock humility when she came up to him. "You
  have caught me in the act ... clandestine correspondence&mdash;why do you peep?
  Is it because you're a detective?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't peeping!" said Dick indignantly. "I happened to be near the
  entrance, and I saw you."</p>

  <p>"I didn't leave you at the entrance," she said severely. "Now, stay here,
  and don't move. I am going to buy Certain Garments!"</p>

  <p>He waited for ten minutes, for a quarter of an hour, but she did not
  return. Then he made an inquiry of the shop-walker.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I remember the lady. She went down to the first floor to the
  ladies' undergarments."</p>

  <p>Dick waited another quarter of an hour. There was no sign of the girl. He
  was turning to go when he saw coming towards him the counter-attendant of the
  inquiry bureau.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, you were with Miss Dane, weren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, wondering.</p>

  <p>"The cable just came through over the phone." She had a slip of paper in
  her hand. "Will you be seeing Miss Dane?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so."</p>

  <p>She went back, took an envelope from the counter and slipped the paper in,
  and handed it to him.</p>

  <p>Dick put the message in his pocket and went down in search of the girl.
  She was not on the floor where he expected to find her, and he ascended again
  to the place she had left him. He was a patient man, but nobody short of an
  angel could wait an hour without feeling a sense of irritation. At last, in
  no pleasant temper, he decided to go. He was passing out of one of the big
  spring doors on to the street when a commissionaire came running up to
  him.</p>

  <p>"You're Mr. Staines, aren't you? A young lady left a message for you. She
  said she'd been called away and Mr. Somebody, whose name I've forgotten, is
  ill."</p>

  <p>"Cornfort?" said Dick.</p>

  <p>"That's the name, sir," said the commissionaire. "She asked me if I knew
  you, and of course I do, because you've been here before. On business," he
  grinned. Dick was not in a smiling temper.</p>

  <p>He was annoyed with Mary, more than irritated with himself. She had
  acquired the habit of making him feel extremely foolish, and he was in a
  savage mood when he swung into Scotland Yard and collided with the portly
  figure of Mr. Bourke, who had stopped hazardously at the corner of the
  corridor to light a cigar.</p>

  <p>"You're a little over two hours late," snapped Bourke, as he retrieved his
  injured Corona. "Don't apologise, for I'd forgotten the appointment. We've
  arrested a man at Bexhill for throwing the bomb, but he looks like proving an
  alibi. It was undoubtedly his car, but there seems no doubt that he sold it
  at junk price the week before last."</p>

  <p>"What did Mary Dane want?" blurted Dick.</p>

  <p>"Mary Dane?" Bourke scratched his second chin. "Let me see now, what did
  she want? Oh yes, it was about the bomb-throwing. Rather a nice girl, that,
  eh?" He looked at Dick shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"Clever, too. What a criminal she'd make!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think?" began Inspector Staines.</p>

  <p>"Never," replied the other promptly. "Too brain-wearing. I'll see you in
  the morning."</p>

  <p>He was gone before Dick could fire in another question. Undoubtedly the
  Superintendent was peeved, as he had every right to be, for Inspector Staines
  was considerably over two hours late for his appointment, and, moreover, he
  had spoilt a very good cigar.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DICK had the room next to the Superintendent's, a small,
  narrow apartment which was used, at a pinch, to detain suspected criminals
  brought to the Yard for examination. There were steel bars on the window, and
  the furniture was of a solid and immovable kind, a necessary precaution since
  that memorable occasion when 'Lupe' Leggatt almost brained his interrogator
  with a handy chair. Since that occurrence, the furniture had been of the
  simplest and the unhandiest kind.</p>

  <p>He sat down now in his big writing chair, to read the letters which had
  accumulated in the past two days. There was nothing of importance; and he
  was feeling in his pocket for two letters that had arrived for him at the
  house and which he had not opened, when he felt the telephone message and
  brought it out. In a hurry, the clerk had not addressed it, and when Dick
  turned the envelope over he saw that the flap was open. He turned it over and
  over. It would be inexpressibly mean to read her private
  correspondence&mdash;it would be inexpressibly foolish not to do so. Besides
  (here was a salving thought) she might call him on the 'phone, in which case
  he would be able to communicate the message. He laid the envelope on the
  table and glowered at it. Suppose it was something that incriminated her ... or
  a private message from some man ... He felt a little pang at the thought.</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" he said, and with great resolution drew the slip from the
  envelope. It was a cable from Capetown, and was addressed&mdash;Mary de
  Villiers!</p>

  <p>Mary de Villiers! Then Lordy Brown had made no mistake. The girl he
  attacked that night was the woman he thought she was&mdash;Dick remembered
  the reference in the letter which he had found in Lordy Brown's pocket about
  this mysterious Miss de Villiers who&mdash;</p>

  <p>All the time he was thinking, he was reading mechanically without grasping
  the sense of the message. Presently he concentrated his mind upon the words
  before him. It was evidently, from the indicator, a reply-paid message, and
  ran:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Thank you, Miss de Villiers, for money which very handy as
  we're starving. Sorry about Lordy's death, but that was expected. Thank you
  for the money, Miss de Villiers. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lordy
  Brown</span>."</p><br>

  <p>He read the message over and over again, trying to make head or tail of
  it, though it was obvious enough. Mary de Villiers had sent money to this
  woman, and at the same time had sent news of Lordy's death. Then she had
  known Lordy ... But why should she send money? And what money? The solution to
  that mystery came in a flash. When Brown had left his hotel, he had a pocket
  full of bank-notes; when his dead body was found, his pockets were empty.
  Somebody had taken that money ... Mary! And she had cabled the money to Mrs.
  Brown in Capetown. Why?</p>

  <p>Three facts were evident. Mary Dane had been in the house on the night of
  the murder, had either killed Lordy or found him dying&mdash;more likely the
  latter. Lordy Brown had recognised her again, and had asked her to send the
  money to his wife. Otherwise she could not have known of the woman's
  necessity. It was Mary who had bound up his wounds and attended to him;
  probably had not left the dying man until he had passed.</p>

  <p>Then who had killed Brown? Were there two gangs engaged in the bizarre
  search, and did they sometimes clash?</p>

  <p>The telephone bell at his elbow shrilled, and he took down the
  receiver.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Dick?" It was Mary's voice, tense and fearful.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "Mary, I have opened that cable ..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know," she said impatiently, "from Mrs. Brown? They told me
  when I went back. Dick, will you do something for me?"</p>

  <p>"If I can," he began.</p>

  <p>"Don't 'if,' darling." She was terribly in earnest. "You must."</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>He thought he heard a whispered colloquy at the other end of the wire, and
  then:</p>

  <p>"I want you to let me into your house about one o'clock to-morrow morning.
  You must tell Derrick that you are sleeping at Tommy's. Stand at the door and
  the moment you hear me scratch at the panel, open and let me in. And keep all
  the lights out. And I want you to guard me as if&mdash;as if you loved me.
  Don't let me out of your sight: Will you do this? Minns knows that I am
  coming. Please don't ask any questions, my dear. Will you do it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered, and instantly there was a click and he was rung off.
  He hung up his receiver with a bewildered frown.</p>

  <p>"Minns knows that I am coming!"</p>

  <p>Was Minns in the swindle, if swindle it was? Apparently so. Here was a
  minor confusion that had to be cleared up.</p>

  <p>After he had been home for a quarter of an hour, Minns the imperturbable
  came to his room to announce that dinner had been served.</p>

  <p>"I heard from his lordship today, sir. He is returning to Town at the end
  of the week. You know his lordship is to be married&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am well aware of that, but there are a lot of things I'm not so well
  informed about," said Dick, watching him. "I think you know Miss Mary
  Dane?"</p>

  <p>If he expected hesitation or embarrassment, he was to be disappointed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the butler immediately. Dick stared at him in
  amazement.</p>

  <p>"You know Miss Mary Dane&mdash;the nurse?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. The lady who came here one night&mdash;if I remember, sir, you
  saw her to the station."</p>

  <p>Dick had forgotten that episode, which was an excuse, at any rate, for the
  butler's calmness.</p>

  <p>"Have you had any communication from her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, several." The man did not flinch under his questioning
  gaze.</p>

  <p>"Are you in a sense a confederate of hers?"</p>

  <p>Minns smiled his quiet and deferential smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, in a sense, I am, sir. I have given her help on several occasions
  when she has been examining the house next door."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" gasped Dick, almost unable to believe his ears. "Do you mean
  to say that you knew ... Miss Dane has been in the habit of burgling the next
  house?"</p>

  <p>"Not burgling, sir," said Minns carefully. "And I am not absolutely sure
  that it was Miss Dane. I understand the young lady has a double. At any rate
  the person who called herself Miss Dane has, I know, made several visits to
  Mr. Derrick's house."</p>

  <p>Dick was not dreaming.</p>

  <p>Here was an honest, respectable man who had been in the service of Tommy
  Weald and his father for twenty or thirty years, calmly and brazenly
  admitting that he had assisted in a series of outrages upon an unoffending
  neighbour.</p>

  <p>"I think we'll go into this question a little later, Minns," he said
  quietly. "I am not so sure that you haven't got yourself into very serious
  trouble."</p>

  <p>Again the butler smiled.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, sir, I once got you out of very serious trouble," he said
  surprisingly.</p>

  <p>When Dick demanded an explanation the butler asked to be excused.</p>

  <p>"This is Alice in Wonderland," said Dick after the man had gone. This
  inoffensive butler&mdash;the whole thing was incredible&mdash;except when he
  tested Minns' conduct by his new theory.</p>

  <p>Derrick called while Dick was having dinner. He had decided to sleep in
  the house that night, he said, and would Dick care to share his vigil? It was
  a proposal that Dick Staines would not have hesitated to agree to but for the
  promised adventure of the night.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't really matter," said Derrick when he saw the other hesitate;
  "I shall be able to fix you up to-morrow much more comfortably than I could
  to-night. If you don't mind, I think I'll ask you to put that portable bell
  of yours into operation&mdash;if I'm scared I will cross that rather insecure
  wooden bridge you have fixed on to your balcony."</p>

  <p>This also, in other circumstances, might have been an acceptable proposal.
  Mr. Derrick was perplexed at his reluctance, and he laughed.</p>

  <p>"You don't want your beauty sleep disturbed, eh? Well, if you expect
  sleepless nights when you're in my house, I don't blame you, but my own view
  is that in the course of the next few days we're going to lay the ghost or
  ghosts so effectively that they will never disturb the peace of Lowndes
  Square again."</p>

  <p>He declined Dick's invitation to share a chop. He was dining at his club
  and would call on his way back.</p>

  <p>"I'm in twenty-three minds about that damned house," he said as he rose to
  go; "I tossed a coin to-day to decide whether I'd have the thing pulled down
  from roof to basement and a new building put up. If there is any secret place
  that would be a pretty effective way of finding it?"</p>

  <p>He paused at the door.</p>

  <p>"I see you were in that bomb affair at Eastbourne. What the dickens do you
  make of that? Who was he, an anarchist?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know the politics of Mr. Herman Lavinski," said Dick quietly;
  "but I should imagine that there was violence in them."</p>

  <p>Walter Derrick's eyebrows met.</p>

  <p>"Lavinski? Was that his name? Sounds like a foreigner to me!" He laughed
  with great heartiness at this banality, and Dick wished for a long time after
  he'd gone that he hadn't.</p>

  <p>He settled himself down to pass away the hours that would intervene before
  the arrival of Mary on her mysterious errand. He had ceased to be puzzled,
  ceased to wonder. He had speculated upon Mary's peculiar behaviour until his
  head reeled. Minns had brought the coffee in and had set the tray solemnly on
  the table when, for no reason at all beyond the sudden impulse which prompted
  the question, Dick asked:</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been in South Africa, Minns?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>Dick turned in his chair to face the man. "When was this?"</p>

  <p>"After his lordship, the late earl, died, sir, when Master Thomas, as we
  called him, was still a child. I took service in South Africa."</p>

  <p>Now there is a peculiar expression, familiar to every experienced police
  officer, a kind of embarrassment born of uncomfortable self-consciousness,
  and this dawned and faded in Minns' face. It was only there for the fraction
  of a second, but long enough to be detected.</p>

  <p>"Minns," said Dick softly, "were you ever in trouble in South Africa?"</p>

  <p>The man licked his lips.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," he said huskily. "There was an accusation made against
  me."</p>

  <p>"For stealing?"</p>

  <p>Minns had gone very pale.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I was perfectly innocent."</p>

  <p>"Were you convicted?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir." Then the ghost of a smile hovered on his lips. "I was one of
  those innocent men who really was innocent! The court dismissed the case,
  though I will tell you this much&mdash;it was touch and go, until fortunately
  the real criminal was found, though he was never caught."</p>

  <p>"Lordy Brown?" said Dick quickly, and Minns shook his head.</p>

  <p>"His name doesn't matter, sir. He obtained a position as footman in the
  house of a well-known African millionaire and stole a quantity of plate. I
  could give you all the particulars to-morrow, sir, if you wish. My
  sister-in-law has the newspaper cuttings. When you've read those I don't
  think you'll doubt for a moment that I was an innocent party."</p>

  <p>"Hm!" said Dick thoughtfully, "You never told me you knew him?"</p>

  <p>Minns did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Did you meet Miss Dane in South Africa?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I met her father, but not Miss Dane."</p>

  <p>"Miss de Villiers she was called?" suggested Dick.</p>

  <p>"I believe that is so, sir," said Minns. "Is there anything else you
  require?"</p>

  <p>This might possibly be an explanation for the butler's extraordinary
  attitude. He knew this mysterious family. And then a thought occurred to him.
  Tommy had a library which was mainly devoted to certain works of reference.
  He went upstairs and searched the shelves for a long time before he found
  what he sought. It was a five-year-old volume devoted to boxing records, and
  he brought it down and searched the pages diligently.</p>

  <p>There were short biographies of boxers, dead and alive, and after a while
  he came upon the name for which he had been looking without any great hope.
  Henry had spoken the truth. Here it was:</p>

  <p>"Ferrers, W. G. (Digger Bill Ferrers), featherweight champion of
  Australia, featherweight champion of South Africa ..."</p>

  <p>Here followed a record of his fights. Dick's finger went down the page
  until it stopped.</p>

  <p>"Capetown, July 10th, 1898, knocked out in eleventh round by H. de
  Villiers, ex-amateur featherweight world champion."</p>

  <p>Henry had spoken the truth! De Villiers! Henry had not only spoken the
  truth, but he had discovered his real name ... Mary had told him she had a
  father. It was Henry!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HE fell back in his chair, staring at the printed page.
  Interruption came from a totally unexpected source. The door was pushed open
  violently and Tommy Weald flung in. His hair was dishevelled, his face
  splashed with mud, and the state of his leather coat and his sodden gloves
  suggested he had come by road and in some hurry.</p>

  <p>"Seen Mary?" His voice was shrill with anxiety; and then, without waiting
  for a reply, he went on: "Popped off this afternoon, old boy! The whole
  blooming shoot. Mary, Cornfort &mdash;supposed to be dying, old
  boy&mdash;Henry, everybody&mdash;no, not everybody, the bath chair's left
  behind! They didn't even take that! Most extraordinary thing, old
  boy&mdash;not left a word, just popped off! Must have gone this morning, and
  me walking up and down the front of the house composing poetry, old boy! I
  tell you, it's too ghastly for words!"</p>

  <p>He paused only to take breath, evidently not to listen, because, before
  Dick could open his mouth to speak, the flow of words continued.</p>

  <p>"I'm rattled, old boy!" he said. "Suppose this beastly fellow who threw
  the whiz-bang has got some fearful grudge against Mary? I stopped in
  Streatham to get a newspaper, and got pinched by a copper for having no
  lights, but I simply had to read it. I saw a bill with 'Local Woman Found
  Murdered in West End' ... might have been her, old boy! Can't you do anything,
  Dicky?" he demanded wildly. "You're the police! You're a pal. I'd search the
  town for her. They left in a motor-car at twelve o'clock&mdash;Henry, Mary,
  the night nurse, and the poor old invalid&mdash;he's practically finished, so
  it doesn't matter about him&mdash;and not so much as a sign of her, old boy.
  All went off together, left the bath chair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you'll only shut up," said Dick, "I'll tell you&mdash;I've seen
  Mary."</p>

  <p>Tommy's eyes bulged.</p>

  <p>"Here! In London?" he screeched.</p>

  <p>"Here in London, <i>and</i> Henry, if that's any comfort to you."</p>

  <p>"Phew!" Tommy mopped his steaming brow and sat down heavily. "Ring for
  Minns, old boy, we'll have a bottle on that. She's a naughty, naughty girl.
  I'm terribly vexed with her. Where are they staying, Dicky?"</p>

  <p>Dick could offer no information on this subject, but he told Tommy that
  the girl was coming there that night. It might be very embarrassing if he did
  not, especially as Tommy evidently intended sleeping there. But Tommy was to
  relieve him in his dilemma.</p>

  <p>"But where's she staying? Are you likely to hear from her? Will you ring
  me up if you do?"</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"I was going nowhere&mdash;I was simply going to stay here, old boy, and
  cry myself to sleep. But if she's alive ... that's all I want to know. I'm
  toddling down to a dear little place in Surrey ... you know!" He tapped his
  nose with a forefinger slyly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Dick wearily; "unless that gesture means that you're
  going to have your nose reshaped."</p>

  <p>"Honeymoon, old boy&mdash;everything arranged next week."</p>

  <p>"Next week!" Dick almost shouted the words. "You're mad! I mean, you said
  it was September."</p>

  <p>"Next week," said Tommy with great calmness. "We fixed it up the night
  before last."</p>

  <p>Dick quaked inwardly. He was like a man who was being carried across
  Niagara on a tight-rope by an expert walker. The position might be entirely
  without peril to himself. On the other hand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Give me your telephone number," he said, with extraordinary sang-froid in
  the circumstances.</p>

  <p>Tommy took off his wet glove, poised a pencil over the table-cloth, but
  wrote nothing.</p>

  <p>"You know what your news has meant to me, old boy? I've been like a raving
  lunatic. Suicide, going abroad, shooting lions&mdash;I thought of
  everything."</p>

  <p>He disappeared as rapidly as he had arrived, and Dick had a vision of a
  motor-car moving at an unlawful rate down the crowded streets. Not until too
  late did he realise that he had left no address.</p>

  <p>As soon as it got dark Dick went up to his room, and one foot was thrown
  across the balcony's edge when he remembered his promise to the girl. Yet
  never since he had come into the case did he have such an overpowering desire
  to inspect Mr. Derrick's empty house. He contented himself by examining with
  some curiosity the unlovely façade. Unlovely it was with its glazed brick, an
  eyesore to the neighbourhood. The stone balconies which jutted out looked
  ugly and incongruous. The windows, as he saw for the first time, were out of
  proportion, long and narrow and badly placed. It was curious that he had
  never noticed that fact before.</p>

  <p>He looked down. Below, on the drawing-room floor, the balcony was wider
  than that which was on his own level. Even the dusk and the kindly lights of
  the streets did little to veil the distressing ugliness of the house. No
  great harm would come if Derrick carried out his threat and razed this
  monstrosity to the ground. At least he would employ a modern architect and
  from this drab and dowdy phoenix might well rise a building creditable to the
  aristocratic neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>Derrick was a queer sort of fellow, he mused ... Suddenly he stiffened.</p>

  <p>The French windows of the office room were open, and from where he stood
  he had caught in the glass, the momentary reflection of a lamp flash. Derrick
  had not had time to finish his dinner. Besides, he would have called on his
  way back as he had promised.</p>

  <p>He had his foot raised to the parapet, and again he heard the urgent
  warning of Mary Dane. Who could have got into the house, and how? Not up
  those wall-hidden stairs? The window was moving, and he stepped back to the
  shelter of his room, watching along the edge, and then he saw a gloved hand
  come round the frame of the half window and a head followed.</p>

  <p>In the dark the face would have been indistinguishable, but there was
  sufficient light from the street below to show the mask that enveloped not
  only the face but the head of the stranger and to reveal the awkwardly cut
  holes through which two eyes were glaring.</p>

  <p>He waited a second, and then stepped out. "I want you!" he said.</p>

  <p>He saw a hand jump up, and dropped like a stone to the inadequate cover of
  the balcony.</p>

  <p>As he did so, something whizzed through his hair. He saw the flash, but
  heard no other sound than the stunning thud of the explosion. The unknown had
  him at his mercy, did he but realise and had he the courage, for the narrow
  stone pillars behind which the detective was crouching afforded no vital
  cover.</p>

  <p>But after the first shot the mask spun round and vanished through the open
  window. Again Dick's leg was flung across the parapet. Again the memory of
  Mary Dane called him back.</p>

  <p>He went back to his room, took the first flight of stairs at a leap, would
  have taken the second, but Minns was in his way. The butler he pushed aside,
  dashed down the remaining stairs, and flung open the door ...</p>

  <p>Mr. Derrick was standing on the doorstep, his hand at the bell, and Dick
  in his hurry almost sent him flying down the three steps that led from the
  sidewalk to the house.</p>

  <p>"For the love of heaven, what's wrong?"</p>

  <p>The detective did not reply. He went to Derrick's door and tried it. It
  was closed.</p>

  <p>"Somebody in there?" asked Derrick quickly.</p>

  <p>The two doors were side by side, only a low balustrade separated the stone
  platforms that formed the top step.</p>

  <p>"Come over here," said Dick, and Derrick obeyed with a wondering shake of
  his head. "Try that door!"</p>

  <p>"What is the idea?" asked Derrick as he pushed. "Do you want to get in?
  I've got the key."</p>

  <p>He searched in his pocket and presently found what he sought.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't want to go in."</p>

  <p>Dick was looking at the broad step. It had been raining and the streets
  were wet, but the two porticoes and the houses themselves were on the
  lee-side of the rainstorm and they were bone-dry.</p>

  <p>"Do you notice anything?"</p>

  <p>Derrick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" he asked. There was a note of petulance in his voice.
  "I'm getting rather tired of all these mysteries."</p>

  <p>"No mystery about it. A masked gentleman shot at me from your balcony
  upstairs."</p>

  <p>"Good God!"</p>

  <p>And then Derrick looked round. Two men were standing on the edge of the
  pavement, watching curiously.</p>

  <p>"Who are those fellows?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You needn't bother about those," said Dick sharply. "They're Scotland
  Yard men."</p>

  <p>He beckoned one of them.</p>

  <p>"Did you see anything?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I thought I saw a flash from the balcony."</p>

  <p>Derrick had turned the key and thrown the door open wide. The hall was in
  complete darkness, and for this he admitted he was responsible.</p>

  <p>"I didn't realise it got dark so soon. Will you, come in?"</p>

  <p>Dick signalled the two men.</p>

  <p>"These officers will go up with you," he said, and heard Derrick's
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid?" he bantered.</p>

  <p>"Terribly," said the detective.</p>

  <p>He waited whilst the search was conducted, and after a time one of the men
  came out with something black in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Here is the mask, sir. It looks as if it was cut from a woman's stocking.
  We found it on the stairs."</p>

  <p>"Did you find the gun?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, but we found the silencer. That was in what you call the office
  room."</p>

  <p>Dick examined it casually and slipped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"No sign of any man?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever."</p>

  <p>Dick's smile was not pleasant.</p>

  <p>"I should have been very much surprised if there was," he said, for the
  doorstep had told him all that he wanted to know.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DERRICK followed him into Tommy's dining-room.</p>

  <p>"I am almost beginning to feel that this is my house, too," he said
  jocularly. "Well, what do you make of it? More like a cinema film than a
  piece of real life!"</p>

  <p>And then, as his eyes fell upon the mask in Dick's hand, he laughed.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't imagine that, could you? What do you say about changing your
  mind and spending the night in this ghost house of mine?"</p>

  <p>"Or may I make an alternative suggestion," said Dick quietly; "that you
  let my two men stay there? They won't want to sleep. A chair in the
  drawing-room will be all they require."</p>

  <p>Before he had finished, Derrick was shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," he said. "No, I'm all for reducing the risks to a
  minimum. I'm not staying there myself. To-morrow I'm bringing in a gang of
  workmen, storing my furniture, and as soon as it is out of the house going to
  pull it down brick by brick!"</p>

  <p>And then he asked a most surprising question. "I wonder if I could see the
  butler's pantry?" Dick stared at him.</p>

  <p>"In Weald's house? I don't see any objection."</p>

  <p>He rang for Minns, and that urbane man came.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Derrick wishes to see your pantry."</p>

  <p>To his amazement he saw the butler's jaw drop and his face change
  colour.</p>

  <p>"My pantry, sir? Certainly. If you don't mind, I'll make it just a bit
  tidy."</p>

  <p>"You needn't bother about that," said Derrick, going to follow Minns from
  the room.</p>

  <p>The man turned in the doorway to face him.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir "&mdash;he was his old, dignified self&mdash;"while I'm in
  his lordship's service I'm afraid I can take such orders only from him. I
  shall be most happy to show you my pantry, but it would not be creditable to
  his lordship that my room should be untidy when you inspected it."</p>

  <p>He went out of the room and closed the door behind him. Mr. Derrick stared
  after him.</p>

  <p>"That was the last thing I expected," said Dick, secretly amused.</p>

  <p>Derrick turned on him with a face as black as thunder.</p>

  <p>"The old-fashioned servitor, eh? I've read about them in books, but never
  met them before. I don't think I want to see that pantry."</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel and left the house.</p>

  <p>Dick went out to Mr. Minns' room. He found the butler very placid and
  rather pleased with himself than otherwise.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea about this pantry of yours, Minns?" he asked. "Is it part
  of the general mystery?"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing mysterious about my pantry, sir;" and then, with a note
  of anxiety in his voice: "Do you mind telling me if Mr. Derrick made any
  reference to the fact that I was reluctant to show him the room?"</p>

  <p>A sharp retort was on Dick's lips, but he checked the inclination.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Derrick merely said that he didn't think it necessary now to inspect
  your room."</p>

  <p>He saw the butler's face go grey.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry he said that, sir."</p>

  <p>He offered no explanation for his sorrow, but it was evident to Dick that
  the man was uneasy. He came in at midnight to ask if there was anything
  further Dick required, and Dick heard him walk along the passage and the
  click as he turned the key in his lock.</p>

  <p>At half-past twelve the detective extinguished all the lights in the
  passage and went to the front door. The square was apparently deserted, but
  he knew that in the vicinity and out of sight were a dozen plain-clothes men
  who had drifted there one by one, and were now cursing the rain and cursing
  him for this extra duty imposed upon them.</p>

  <p>He had already warned the sergeant in charge that it was possible he would
  have a late visitor. He glanced at his watch. It was half an hour before one.
  He took down his raincoat and, buttoning it up to his chin, closed the door
  behind him and made a circuit of the block.</p>

  <p>In the mews behind the house he found two of the watchers. Theirs was a
  difficult task. In the mews there were over a dozen garages, not counting the
  two that flanked the garden wall. From twelve o'clock onwards cars had been
  coming and backing into their garages. Even as he was talking to one of the
  men another machine glided into the mews.</p>

  <p>"It is almost impossible to keep track of people coming and going," said
  the detective-sergeant, watching the inspection of the chauffeurs and
  footmen. "Minns was out here a few minutes ago smoking a pipe."</p>

  <p>"Minns? I thought he was in bed," said Dick, surprised.</p>

  <p>Yet there was nothing remarkable in the butler's appearance. Apparently it
  was his nightly practice to emerge through the little wicket gate in the
  garage door and smoke his 'quiet pipe.'</p>

  <p>"Whose car is that?"</p>

  <p>Dick pointed to an open touring car with blazing head-lamps which stood
  across the doorway of Tommy's Gothic motor-house. The detective could give no
  information, except that it had been standing there for an hour.</p>

  <p>Dick examined the machine and found it coated with mud. Even the number
  plate was obscured, but when he wiped this clean he saw that the letters
  before the number indicated a Sussex origin. It was a big Wengley, one of the
  most powerful sporting cars on the road. He put his lamp into the interior
  and discovered nothing more exciting than a waterproof rug designed for the
  protection of the passengers, and beneath this a couple of fleecy rugs.</p>

  <p>"I remember now. It came less than an hour ago," said one of the watchers.
  "I couldn't see who was in it because the head-light was rather fierce."</p>

  <p>"Keep your eye on it," said Dick, and went back to the front of the
  house.</p>

  <p>He stared up at the white front of the mystery house. The windows on the
  upper balcony had been closed, probably by Derrick. There was nothing to do
  now but await developments.</p>

  <p>He sat in the dining-room trying to read, but every few seconds his eye
  went to the clock on the mantelpiece. When the hands pointed to five minutes
  before one he moved quietly into the dark passage and stood by the door. A
  pedestrian passed hurriedly. He heard his footsteps die away in the distance,
  and then the boom of a church clock striking the hour.</p>

  <p>There was no other sound, and his hand was on the lock when he heard a
  faint scratch on the panel. Instantly the door was opened and he saw two
  figures. They must have been standing close against the doorway, for they
  nearly fell into the passage.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"It is Mary&mdash;Dick!" Her voice was breathless.</p>

  <p>"Who is with you?"</p>

  <p>"A&mdash;a friend."</p>

  <p>He saw it was a man, but could not distinguish the face.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said, and the girl's companion walked with a distinct limp.
  "You had better stay in the dining-room."</p>

  <p>"No, no." Her voice was terrified. "You promised to take us back to your
  room&mdash;Dick!"</p>

  <p>The 'Dick!' came hesitantly, as though she were shy of calling him by name
  before a third party.</p>

  <p>"I want you to do as I asked ... My friend, Mr. Jones&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Cornfort, I think," said Dick quietly, and he heard a soft laugh
  from the man.</p>

  <p>"You've got a good memory," he said. It was the cultured voice of a
  public-school man. Certainly there was nothing in it of age or
  decrepitude.</p>

  <p>The man he had not bargained for. He would not have been surprised if
  Henry had been the second of the party&mdash;but the arrival of Cornfort
  rather took him aback.</p>

  <p>"Before we go any farther," he said, "I want to be taken into your little
  secret. I realise that something unpleasant is going to happen, but I want to
  know just how and why."</p>

  <p>"I should be surprised if you didn't," said Cornfort's voice. "I'll tell
  you candidly the position. Mary had no intention that I should be here
  tonight, but I'm tired of her taking risks on my behalf and I wanted to be
  near her."</p>

  <p>"And I can tell you "&mdash;Dick smiled grimly in the darkness&mdash;"that
  Mary is taking no risks, either to-night or any other night!"</p>

  <p>Then he turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Is this the idea? That you want me to help you to get into the house next
  door? Are you the flanking party? If so, you can count me out. I'm a police
  officer and I have a duty to perform. As to what my duty is, exactly, I am
  not perfectly sure. But it certainly isn't my job to help you people towards
  a premature end!"</p>

  <p>"No,"&mdash;her voice was almost a whisper&mdash;"it was&mdash;Henry's
  idea. He wanted me safe. He was so scared that Lavinski would hit back
  through me. I wanted to stay in Eastbourne, but after what happened the other
  night that was impossible. That is the truth, Mr. Dick. They didn't know what
  to do with me at all. Henry said I ought to be locked up in a police station
  and that I should be safe then. And he wanted Mr. Cornfort to go to France.
  Then there came this desperate idea that we should come to you. There's no
  trick in it&mdash;Dick."</p>

  <p>Her hand gripped his arm appealingly.</p>

  <p>"Really, there isn't! You see, Mr. Cornfort had to be somewhere handy.
  You'll understand that some day. So at the last moment they decided he should
  come with me."</p>

  <p>Dick groaned.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, I can't understand anything." He thought a moment. "Oh yes,
  I can, though. Come up to my room."</p>

  <p>He slipped his arm about her waist, but she drew clear with a frightened
  exclamation. It was not unexpected.</p>

  <p>"Don't, don't!" And then she stammered: "I'm terribly sorry, but I'm
  nervous." And then, as though she remembered something: "You're not to leave
  us in any circumstances&mdash;dear." It was a shy 'dear,' and the man she
  addressed understood why and smiled to himself.</p>

  <p>"Come up to my room&mdash;darling!" he said, and there was malice in that
  'darling.'</p>

  <p>He led the way and they followed in silence. At the door she caught his
  arm again.</p>

  <p>"Don't put on the lights, please."</p>

  <p>He ushered them into the room. The curtains were not drawn, and even in
  the half-light he could see how pale she was. Mr. Cornfort, who had not
  spoken more than a sentence since he had come into the house, walked to the
  window and was stepping on to the balcony when the girl pulled him back.</p>

  <p>"No, no, you mustn't. You remember. Can't we draw the blinds?"</p>

  <p>He put his arm in hers. She was trembling from head to foot, and she held
  her arm stiffly like an automaton.</p>

  <p>Then Cornfort spoke.</p>

  <p>"If we could be absolutely sure that Mary's theory was right, the thing
  would be so simple. We could even ask the police to help us, and the matter
  could be settled in daylight! But we aren't sure, and Henry will not allow us
  to take a single risk."</p>

  <p>"What is the risk?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>There was a silence, and then Cornfort spoke slowly and with great
  deliberation:</p>

  <p>"Life imprisonment for me and imprisonment for Mary."</p>

  <p>They heard the whine of a car draw up on the ground below. Dick stepped on
  to the balcony and, shaking off the agonised grasp of the girl, saw it stop
  before the house. Somebody was getting out&mdash;he did not see who&mdash;and
  that somebody was moving to the front door. He went to the head of the stairs
  and listened. There was no sound; and then he heard the door slam and Tommy's
  voice hailed him from below.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, where are all the lights?"</p>

  <p>"Come up quickly and don't make a row."</p>

  <p>"Any trouble?" The voice was eager. "I say, old boy, I forgot to tell you
  where I was staying. Only occurred to me as I was coming out of the Owls
  Club."</p>

  <p>"Don't make a noise," warned Dick again.</p>

  <p>Tommy came up the last flight at a run, stumbled on the last step and
  raised a din which must have been heard on the other side of the square.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, old boy ... the ghost walking? By Jove, I'm just in time!"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" warned Dick in a low voice. "There's somebody you know in my
  room!"</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Mary."</p>

  <p>Tommy did not see the grin which accompanied the words.</p>

  <p>"Mary!" he squeaked. "In your room? Good God! In your room? What in the
  name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She is well chaperoned. Mr. Cornfort is there&mdash;an invalid and a
  gentleman," said Dick flippantly.</p>

  <p>And then the girl spoke.</p>

  <p>"Tommy!" It was not like the timid 'Dick' she had addressed to him.
  "Tommy, darling, why did you come?"</p>

  <p>"Why did I come, by Gad! I think it's about time I did come!" spluttered
  Tommy. "What the deuce does all this mean, Mary? In old Dicky's room? I mean
  to say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Cornfort is here."</p>

  <p>"What does all this darkness mean? Where the devil are the lights?"</p>

  <p>He groped along for the switch, but two hands held his wrist and drew his
  arm away.</p>

  <p>"Tommy, darling, you mustn't!"</p>

  <p>She led the bewildered young man into the room. From somewhere outside
  came a faint whistle. Dick dashed out on to the balcony. He could see nothing
  parallel with him, and then he leaned over.</p>

  <p>Two people were on the balcony of Derrick's house outside the drawing-room
  window. They were feeling along the wall. Their sexes it was impossible to
  determine, so dark, shadowy, and shapeless they were. He saw one reach up and
  touch the glazed wall, and then a miracle happened. A section of the wall,
  about two feet square, swung open like a door!</p>

  <p>As he looked, fascinated, he saw a third figure appear, and instantly
  recognised the bulk of it. It was the man who had shot at him earlier in the
  evening. There was no way of reaching him except one. It involved a swinging
  leap from the upper balcony to that below. He did not hesitate for the
  fraction of a second. He was over the parapet, and for a second was hanging
  by his hands from the stone flooring. Twice he swung his body, and felt his
  fingers slipping on the bevelled edge ... Suddenly he kicked himself forward
  and leapt!</p>

  <p>He missed the stone parapet of the lower balcony by inches, his knees and
  elbows struck the masked man as he fired, and in an instant the two were
  rolling over in that narrow space. The man fought furiously. Dick had gripped
  at the black mask and was tearing it, when he felt two cruel fingers groping
  for his eyes and released his hold. As quick as lightning the man flung
  himself clear; there was a crash of glass as his foot smashed through one of
  the panes of the swinging door, and before the detective could scramble to
  his knees the mask was in the room. He came up to his feet and was making a
  dive at the door when somebody gripped him by the collar and threw him
  back.</p>

  <p>"You fool!" hissed a voice in his ear. "Don't you know&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>Ping!</i></p>

  <p>The bullet struck the window-frame. Dick saw the flash of flame from the
  dark room, and his face smarted with the splinters of a smashed windowpane.
  Breathless, he allowed himself to be drawn to the cover of the balcony.</p>

  <p>Police whistles were blowing now, and he saw officers running from all
  directions towards the house. Shaking off the man who held him, and oblivious
  to the danger, he ran into the drawing-room, pulling his automatic as he
  flew. The door was closed, but not locked. He thought he heard a sound
  below ...</p>

  <p><i>Plop!</i></p>

  <p>This time the explosion was louder. His assailant had abandoned the
  silencer. Dick shot down into the dark once, twice, and then heard a howl of
  pain. A door banged below. The man had flown into the basement, but Dick was
  on his heels. There was no light now, but he could hear the sobbing breath of
  his quarry: he was making for the wine cellar!</p>

  <p>Almost as he realised the destination of his enemy the iron door clanged
  and he heard the sound of a bolt being shot. There was no way in&mdash;and no
  way out except through the garden, and there he knew a policeman was on duty,
  but an unarmed policeman ...</p>

  <p>He ran upstairs, opened the door to admit the crowd of detectives and
  plain-clothes policemen, and gave them instructions. Now he came back to the
  drawing-room. Somebody had turned on the lights. Mary, in a long, black
  raincoat, was waiting for him at the head of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt?" Her voice was thin with anxiety. "Oh, Dick, I told
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm all right."</p>

  <p>He was breathless, his head was reeling, his lacerated face was red with
  blood. As he walked from the drawing-room he saw Henry come in from the
  balcony, and in his hand was a little red book.</p>

  <p>"I think there's pots of money there, darling&mdash;" he began, and then
  he saw Dick and smiled gently. "Good-morning, Mr. Staines. Now I suppose
  we're all going to be arrested?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," he said.</p>

  <p>He had seen on the table, where either Henry or the girl had laid it, a
  replica of that peculiar instrument, the vacuum pump. Evidently it had done
  its work well.</p>

  <p>Henry saw him looking, and smiled broadly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the safe was on the outside of the house," he said, "and a most
  ingenious idea, because it couldn't very well be burgled. Do you realise
  that? I thought it might be, when I searched the records of the borough
  council and found that the late Mr. Derrick had petitioned for a powerful
  street lamp to be placed opposite his house, and had even offered to defray
  the cost&mdash;which in a gentleman of his peculiar temperament was a
  remarkable offer."</p>

  <p>He still fondled the little red book.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea where Mr. Walter Derrick is to be found?" he asked
  politely.</p>

  <p>Dick gave the name of the hotel.</p>

  <p>"It is only right," said Henry, "that we should give an explanation for
  the liberties we have taken from time to time. By the way, I wonder if the
  officers would object to our Mr. Cornfort joining us? There is a young lady
  with him whom I should naturally like to see."</p>

  <p>"I have already sent for your daughter and for Mr. Cornfort," said Dick.
  "I should like that book."</p>

  <p>Henry handed over the red-covered autograph book without protest.</p>

  <p>"Once the outer wall was moved, the safe presented no difficulty. It was,
  in fact, unlocked, the lock being "&mdash;he took the vacuum pump from the
  table and showed the steel lever in the centre&mdash;"this. That had to be
  pressed into a microscopic hole&mdash;it was terribly difficult to find it in
  the dark&mdash;as far as the screw would allow. The vacuum pump then became a
  door-handle."</p>

  <p>"How did you find the needle hole in the wall?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>Henry was almost apologetic as he explained.</p>

  <p>"By telescopic photography&mdash;and skilful enlargement. It was very
  simple. The safe in the outer wall was, as I said, a most ingenious idea. By
  the way, Mr. Staines, there is a very large quantity of paper money in
  that&mdash;er&mdash;receptacle, and I think it would be advisable if your
  officer removed it to a more secure place."</p>

  <p>He was still speaking when Cornfort limped into the room, followed by
  Tommy and the girl. It was the first time Dick had seen Mary and her sister
  together. For his own part, he could never have fallen into the error that
  was Tommy's.</p>

  <p>"You're the night nurse, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"Jane de Villiers?"</p>

  <p>Jane de Villiers smiled and looked timidly at the gaping young man by her
  side. Tommy was staring from one girl to the other. The same eyes, the same
  turn of eyebrows, almost the same colour of hair; Mary de Villiers was, if
  anything, a little fairer.</p>

  <p>"By gosh!" he spluttered. "I mean to say ...!"</p>

  <p>"You mean to say you're rather astonished, Tommy." There was a smile in
  Mary's eyes. "For my own part, I'm fearfully disappointed that
  Detective-Inspector Richard Staines hasn't collapsed on the floor!" She
  addressed Dick pleadingly. "Don't tell me you knew?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I knew."</p>

  <p>"But how?"</p>

  <p>In spite of the tenseness of that moment, in a situation that might be
  fraught with so much danger to herself and those she loved, feminine
  curiosity was paramount to all other issues.</p>

  <p>"You never saw us together&mdash;poor Jane has lived a life of terror for
  months. She never went out except when I was away. How did you know?" she
  challenged.</p>

  <p>Dick was looking at her steadily.</p>

  <p>"Do you ask that question seriously?"</p>

  <p>She half nodded, as though she were afraid to be told.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll tell you&mdash;some other time! The only information I can give
  you now is that, when a woman says things to me on a railway platform, and
  immediately afterwards I hear she is engaged to somebody else, I
  believe&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"I think we'll discuss that some other time," she said hastily. Her pale
  face had gone pink. "You know my father?" She nodded to Henry.</p>

  <p>He looked at Henry and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know him pretty well. His name is Henry de Villiers; he is the
  head of the de Villiers Detective Agency in Capetown."</p>

  <p>"And Johannesburg," murmured Henry. "We have also branches at Durban,
  Pretoria, and Kimberley. Are you going to look at the book? There is somebody
  here rather interested."</p>

  <p>At the sight of the red-covered book Mr. Cornfort had sunk limply into a
  chair, but now he stood up and extended a shaking hand to take the book from
  Dick.</p>

  <p>He turned the leaves rapidly, and presently stopped. On this page there
  were four rows of finger-prints, one under the other, and he pointed to the
  third. In the crabbed, angular handwriting of old Derrick was written:</p>

  <p>"My son Walter, born on the 3rd of January, 1897."</p>

  <p>"Whose finger-prints are those?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"Mine," said Cornfort in a voice that was scarcely above a whisper.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was at that moment that a police officer burst into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"I think they've settled Minns," he said. Mary uttered an exclamation of
  horror.</p>

  <p>"Daddy ... that was the way he went!"</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"He's in the kitchen next door. I think he's been shot."</p>

  <p>In a minute Dick was by the wounded man's side. Minns lay on his back. He
  was unconscious, and his coat was soddened with blood.</p>

  <p>"Let me see, please."</p>

  <p>It was Mary. She knelt by the man, removed his coat and vest and made a
  quick examination of the wound.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it is really bad. Will you get one of your people to ring
  for the ambulance?"</p>

  <p>With quick, skilful fingers she bandaged the wound, and Dick, watching
  her, realised that he was seeing a repetition of the scene that had been
  enacted on the night Lordy Brown had been found in the room upstairs.</p>

  <p>"But how did this happen?"</p>

  <p>"If you look at the pantry I think you'll understand," she said in a low
  voice.</p>

  <p>Dick went into the inner room adjoining the kitchen, which, though it was
  designated with the name of pantry, was, in fact, a small bed-sitting-room.
  It was plainly furnished, and Dick saw that the bed, which ordinarily must
  have stood in the corner, was drawn to the centre of the room. The carpet had
  been rolled away and a small aperture showed in the stone floor. He put down
  the light of his lamp and saw that the butler's pantry was immediately above
  Derrick's wine cellar.</p>

  <p>There must have been a time when the cellar was common to both houses. He
  remembered now that there was no basement to Tommy's residence, a
  circumstance which struck him as peculiar when the fact was first brought to
  his notice.</p>

  <p>While he was making his inspection the girl joined him. "That is the way
  we came in," she said. "Minns let us through your house quite a number of
  times."</p>

  <p>At his questioning look she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, we only once used that underground passage. Poor Minns!"</p>

  <p>"But why on earth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He knew Mr. Walter Derrick," she said quietly. "They were once fellow
  servants in Capetown."</p>

  <p>Then Dick remembered the butler's confidence.</p>

  <p>"Walter Derrick is really our friend upstairs," she went on. "You call him
  'Cornfort.' The other Walter Derrick&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is Herman Lavinski," said Dick. "I guessed that. I was certain of it
  to-night when I found him at the door after he had made his quick 'shoot up.'
  We're stupid fellows, both of us: myself for not arresting him, and he for
  imagining that I hadn't noticed that there were no wet footsteps on either
  step. It said as plainly as though it had been printed that he had not been
  out in the rain, and therefore could not have come in from the rain!"</p>

  <p>There was another casualty besides Minns, he learned immediately
  afterwards. At the first faint sound of shooting the detectives in the mews
  had closed towards the garage door. Immediately after they did so the wicket
  door had opened and an excited voice had called them inside. Two men had
  hardly dashed through the opening before the door was closed upon them.
  Whilst one was searching for the bolt that unfastened the gate, they heard
  the sound of the machine moving.</p>

  <p>At the end of the mews was a third officer, who had attempted to bar the
  way, and had been knocked sprawling for his pains.</p>

  <p>"Walter is not at his hotel, of course. There is only one chance of
  catching him before he does a little more mischief, and that is to 'phone the
  Sussex police."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he'll make for Keyley?" nodded Mary. "So do I! I have an
  idea he has everything planned. I've seen him twice creeping in a large
  motor-boat, but I've never been able to trace where he keeps it.".</p>

  <p>And then Dick asked a question that had been puzzling him ever since he
  had come into the case.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth didn't you go to the police right away?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"That question is very easily answered. It was the one thing we couldn't
  do, although we could do it now. You don't realise that Mr. Cornfort, as you
  call him, is an escaped convict. He was under life sentence in Rhodesia for
  murder."</p>

  <p>Dick was staggered.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear girl," he said at last, "he must be re-arrested."</p>

  <p>"I think that is inevitable," replied this amazing girl.</p>

  <p>The Sussex police were difficult to reach, and when they had spent
  three-quarters of an hour in getting through to the proper authority (there
  are two divisions to Sussex, and either would have been the wrong one) they
  learned that Keyley was not in the Sussex area. It was, in point of fact, in
  Surrey.</p>

  <p>"We shall waste another hour before we reach the Surrey people," said
  Dick; "we will go on to Keyley."</p>

  <p>By this time Bourke had arrived. The big man seemed singularly unimpressed
  when he learnt of what had happened.</p>

  <p>"We shall want a fast car&mdash;" began Dick.</p>

  <p>"I have it on the corner," said Mary. "My dear boy, how do you imagine I
  got to Brighton from Lowndes Square three minutes ahead of Tommy and you, and
  how do you suppose I've beaten your train time and time again?"</p>

  <p>"Who drives?" asked Dick, and she smiled.</p>

  <p>He had never moved so fast in his life as he moved that night. Mary sat at
  the wheel, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. The country seemed to fly past
  them. Once Dick stirred uneasily, but Henry's voice reassured him.</p>

  <p>"My daughter is rather a good driver," he said. "She has won three
  endurance trials in Africa."</p>

  <p>In an incredibly short space of time they came to the lodge gates of
  Keyley, and Dick heaved a sigh of relief, for the last two miles of the
  journey had been made with the aid of the dimmest of head-lights.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, he would have heard us," she said as they got down.</p>

  <p>The three plain-clothes officers who also occupied the car were volubly
  thankful that their perilous journey was over. Silently and in single file
  they passed up the dark drive to the house, keeping close to the hedges that
  fringed the gravel path. There was no light in the house and no sign or
  evidence that it was occupied.</p>

  <p>Dick was in no doubt that the man was here. He had stopped to examine the
  gravel on the path with the aid of his lamp, and had seen fresh wheel-tracks.
  Drawn up near the portico they found the car, its lights extinguished, its
  radiator still burning hot.</p>

  <p>Then, as they stood talking in low tones, a light appeared simultaneously
  behind three shaded windows on the ground floor. The drawing-room, Dick noted
  mentally, and waited. Another light glowed in the semicircular transom above
  the front door. Dick waited, and saw the door open slowly.</p>

  <p>Mr. 'Walter Derrick' stood on the doorstep. He was in his shirt-sleeves.
  One hand was heavily bandaged.</p>

  <p>"Come in, please."</p>

  <p>He was the jovial Walter that Dick had known the day he was introduced at
  Brighton.</p>

  <p>"I saw your lights and I heard your engine. Have you got the decrepit Mr.
  Cornfort with you? You haven't? What a pity! Do I see Miss Mary Dane, or Miss
  Mary de Villiers? And my dear old friend, Henry, the chairman!"</p>

  <p>He turned his back upon his visitors and walked ahead of them into the
  drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"That pistol is quite unnecessary, de Villiers," he said with a portentous
  smile, but that admonition had no effect upon Henry. His long-barrelled
  automatic covered the man.</p>

  <p>"Now I suppose you're going to arrest me? On what charge?"</p>

  <p>He asked the question quite casually, as though it were a subject which
  barely interested him.</p>

  <p>"Murder without a doubt will be one charge," said Dick. "There is also a
  charge of fraudulent impersonation, but I think we shall have you on the
  murder."</p>

  <p>Derrick shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

  <p>"A blackmailer and a poor simpleton. An unworthy cause for an execution.
  There I fear you will have a difficulty, Inspector. If I am a murderer must I
  also be a bungler? I could have got you two or three times,
  Henry&mdash;apparently you credit me with a taste for the spectacular? The
  bomb&mdash;I presume you suspect me of that&mdash;would certainly have been
  an excellent way of disposing of an unpleasant little party. Do you mind
  shutting the door? There's a draught."</p>

  <p>One of the detectives, at a signal from Dick, closed the door. Another
  Dick placed on the far side of the room near the windows.</p>

  <p>"I am unarmed. As I say, de Villiers, this is sheer melodrama," said
  Derrick, glancing at the South African's automatic. "What happens now?"</p>

  <p>Something had already happened to the man. He seemed to be in pain. His
  face was haggard, and his geniality was perhaps the hardest pose he had ever
  assumed.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt?"</p>

  <p>'Derrick' shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nothing very much," he said airily. "What shall I get for all this? Seven
  years? After all, impersonation is a very small thing."</p>

  <p>"I shall want you for the murder of Lordy Brown," said Dick, and the man
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"No human eye ever saw me kill Lordy or any other kind of Brown," he said.
  "The fellow was a burglar in my house, he was armed. I had every
  justification for killing him, even suppose I shot him. I am going to suggest
  that you have no evidence that I killed Brown. I am also going to suggest
  that your friend Mr. Henry de Villiers and his daughter were also in the
  house that night and might be as guilty as I. I am sufficiently well
  acquainted with the law, Inspector Staines, to know that you haven't got
  sufficient evidence to hang a cat."</p>

  <p>Dick knew this equally well.</p>

  <p>"I salute you as my benefactor!" Derrick flashed a grin in Dick's
  direction. "That shot of yours did me a marvellous service. I note that you
  are a little baffled by my statement, but you will understand later. Have you
  any other charge to lay against me? Bomb-throwing&mdash;that you cannot
  prove. I simply state that I was not the culprit."</p>

  <p>"There is one other little matter, Mr. Herman Lavinski," said Dick
  quietly, "and that is the Slough murder&mdash;a cashier shot in cold blood
  and his money stolen. There was a thumb-print on that pistol. A week after
  the killing you sailed for South Africa in the name of Cleave."</p>

  <p>Again that crooked smile.</p>

  <p>"Where is the proof against me there?"</p>

  <p>"The proof is easily supplied&mdash;a print of your thumb will be quite
  sufficient evidence to convict you." The man was still smiling, and then
  slowly he unwrapped the bloody bandage from his hand.</p>

  <p>"A lucky shot for me," he said, and Dick looked and winced.</p>

  <p>His chance bullet had removed all proof.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NOBODY has ever described the scene which followed the real
  Walter Derrick's discovery that his father had married again. The quarrel was
  a bitter one; there was money behind it, for Walter was extravagant. This
  extravagance had a curious cause. He had the same experimental mind as his
  father, but his pet experiments cost money, since they were devoted to the
  study of metallurgy, and particularly to gold recovery. He left his father's
  house never to see him again, and sailed for South Africa in the steerage. A
  year's wandering brought him to the Tanganyika area and to the most
  extraordinary adventure.</p>

  <p>For eighteen months he prospected, living summer and winter in a tent,
  scraping enough from the ground to pay his 'boys,' and replace the horses
  that died like flies. And then chance brought him into the company of a
  wanderer who had sought this thinly populated region for quite another
  reason.</p>

  <p>'Joe Cleave' this man called himself, and he made an agreeable companion.
  He was at first taciturn, a little nervous, and Walter Derrick had the
  uncomfortable impression, for no particular reason, that he was a fugitive
  from justice, but in his wanderings through Northern Rhodesia he had met
  several men into whose antecedents it was undesirable to pry.</p>

  <p>Cleave was down on his luck, and once hinted that the Capetown police
  wanted him, probably for the robbery of silver for which Minns had been held
  responsible. This was one of the peculiarities of the man: it seemed that
  time and time again he escaped the processes of justice by the simple method
  of leading suspicion to innocent men. He was a murderer, a thief, a hold-up
  man, and, above all, a deadly gun-fighter.</p>

  <p>He knew something about gold-digging, and apparently had been in
  Johannesburg for a period, and once spoke vaguely of the platinum mines in
  the Caucasus. Derrick discovered that he had a knowledge of several
  languages; but he did not allow his suspicions to interfere with the amity of
  his daily intercourse.</p>

  <p>The two men came upon a patch of alluvial ground which promised to make
  them rich. Three months later led to a disillusionment. The gold which had
  been plentiful in the first washings petered out to nothing, and they were
  thinking of breaking up their camp and going their several ways, when Walter,
  ranging the veldt in search of food, was attacked by an old lion. He
  succeeded in driving the animal off, but not until he had been badly mauled
  in the calf, an injury which led to a permanent limp, a peculiar coincidence
  since his father was similarly afflicted. It was true that Lordy Brown had
  come to his aid and carried him back to camp. It was also true that Lordy had
  disappeared after three or four days, taking with him a small bag of gold
  that the two men had accumulated with such labour.</p>

  <p>Derrick became seriously ill from his wound and delirious. It is probable
  that during this period of time he divulged his identity and told the
  interested criminal who was his companion the story of his father. It was
  certain that, whilst he was ill, letters to Derrick found their way into the
  camp, and one was undoubtedly from the old man. He had almost lost his sight,
  could scarcely hear, and, feeling the hand of Death upon him, sought a
  reconciliation with his only son. That this letter was read by Cleave admits
  of no doubt. It was whilst he was waiting for his companion to die that his
  scheme took shape.</p>

  <p>He left the camp one night, believing his friend to be <i>in extremis</i>,
  and carrying with him as much of Derrick's goods as he could travel. He had a
  long tramp before him, and he needed money not only to get to the coast, but
  to make some sort of appearance in England. The ground had to be
  reconnoitred. He had to discover something about the old man, and mostly he
  had to be sure that, though Walter had babbled to him that he had no friends,
  this was substantially correct.</p>

  <p>In this dilemma he reached the outskirts of a mining camp and found a
  prospector lying drunk by the side of the road. There was nobody in sight,
  and Cleave searched his pockets and was well rewarded, for the man had
  recently sold a number of claims to a Tanganyika syndicate. He was making his
  get-away when the drunkard became dimly aware of what had happened. The first
  intimation he had that his man was alive and alert was a pistol bullet that
  zipped past his head. He shot back, dropping the man in his tracks. But he
  had not realised that he was as near the little township as he was and that
  there were scores of people within earshot. He had hardly reached the cover
  of a wood before he was under heavy fire. He ran through the wood with his
  pursuers on his heels and flew in the only direction of which he was
  perfectly sure, towards the camp where he had left his dying friend.</p>

  <p>With the fleetest of his pursuers not a hundred yards away he came panting
  into the tent and found Walter Derrick sitting up on the side of his bed
  fully dressed.</p>

  <p>Derrick had no recollection of what happened. When he became conscious he
  was lying in the prison hospital on a charge of murder and robbery. A pistol
  was in his hand when the pursuers came up, there were two exploded shells,
  there was the booty that had been taken from the murdered man lying on the
  bed. Nobody had seen the face of the murderer ...</p>

  <p>Half-dazed, Walter Derrick found himself in a hot, stuffy court listening
  to a death sentence. He had been charged in the name of Cleave, a name that
  he accepted. He himself half believed that in his delirium he had been guilty
  of the crime, and wished to save his father's name from this ignominy.</p>

  <p>It was in the second year of his imprisonment (the death sentence was
  commuted) that he began to piece together the fragments of recollection. He
  learnt, too, why he was called Cleave. On being asked his name on his arrest
  that was the one he gave. Probably he was calling for his lost companion, but
  the local sheriff seemed quite unaware that he had had a companion with him.
  In the meantime Cleave had made his way to the coast, leaving behind him a
  trail of burgled stores.</p>

  <p>In Capetown he disappeared. Two years passed in the Central Prison, and
  then the real Walter Derrick gradually built up the shattered pieces of
  recollection. He was allowed newspapers (he spent a great deal of his time in
  hospital), and one day he read of his father's death in a newspaper, and
  underneath a photograph the caption: "Mr. Walter Derrick, who inherits an
  enormous fortune by the death of his late father."</p>

  <p>He recognised the photograph instantly. It was Cleave. And then the whole
  dastardly plot became clear. He was in prison. It was impossible to prove his
  innocence. He tried to interest the prison doctor and the chaplain. The first
  was frankly amused and the second was maddeningly soothing, for in the gaol
  he was regarded as being a little crazy. Indeed, it was this suspicion of
  madness which had saved him from the gallows.</p>

  <p>For three months he plotted and planned. One stormy night, when the
  thunder did not cease and the lightning flickered incessantly, he dropped
  over the prison wall and made his way into the wilderness. It took him five
  months to reach Capetown, a hundred and fifty-three days of privation and
  terror. He was half mad, wholly exhausted, when one night he found his way
  into a beautiful Rondebosch garden and fell on the step of the only man who
  could help him.</p>

  <p>It was Mary Dane who found him. She had been a nurse in a Capetown
  hospital and had recently left her profession to help her father in his
  rapidly growing business.</p>

  <p>De Villiers was the greatest detective that South Africa had produced.
  Originally a detective-inspector in Kimberley, he had left the police force
  and opened his agency when his girls were young children. They carried the
  unconscious man to a bed, and Henry de Villiers would have rung for an
  ambulance to send him to the local hospital, but Mary intervened.</p>

  <p>Four days later, a weak and desperate man told Henry de Villiers the
  story, told him everything, including the tale of his prison breaking. De
  Villiers was at first sceptical, but Mary Dane with her quick woman's
  intuition was assured that this wild wanderer spoke the truth. There was only
  one proof of his identity, and there was slender hope of securing
  this&mdash;the family book. He knew his father had it, knew dimly there was a
  concealed safe in the house, and that in the safe the old man kept such
  intimate documents as he possessed.</p>

  <p>If the spurious Walter Derrick had found the secret hiding-place there was
  no hope. De Villiers considered the story and made a few inquiries through a
  London agent. He himself went to the scene of the crime, questioned local
  natives, and discovered that Cleave had had an existence. He traced the
  murderer's progress southward, he checked dates, and then one evening:</p>

  <p>"I'm taking a chance with you, Derrick. The doctor's told me to go on a
  holiday and I think this is the kind of holiday I want. It's going to cost me
  five thousand pounds and it will probably land us all in gaol. My fee will be
  fifty thousand pounds if we succeed, nothing if we fail."</p>

  <p>In a most businesslike manner a remarkable document to this effect was
  completed. They came to England, and it was Mary who suggested the yellow
  bath chair. It would keep Derrick out of sight, and give these four people an
  excuse to be together. Jane, who was a year younger than her sister, was the
  night nurse, and it was Mary who designed her for a double.</p>

  <p>"She was my everlasting alibi. Whenever I was likely to be seen in London,
  I made absolutely sure that she should be seen somewhere fifty miles away. It
  was she who danced at the Brighton ball&mdash;I took her place ten minutes
  before you arrived. Poor Jane! She loathed it. She is naturally nervous, and
  then the awful girl complicated matters by falling in love with Tommy! Oh
  yes, it was her ring I was wearing. That is why Tommy's fiancée was so
  affectionate by night and so cold by day. I like Tommy, but I hate being
  pawed by him! Poor dear, he was very hurt! I don't know' when Lavinski began
  to suspect we knew him&mdash;I rather fancy until somebody told him about the
  family book&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Old Inspector Endred was the culprit," said Dirk.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Even before then, perhaps? He may have recognised the real Derrick in the
  bath chair. He may have cabled to South Africa to ask for information about
  de Villiers. Probably Lordy Brown told him."</p>

  <p>"You found Lordy Brown?"</p>

  <p>She nodded again.</p>

  <p>"He died soon after we got into the house. When I heard him groan I was
  terrified. We did all we could to make him a little happy. He recognised me,
  of course, and asked me to send the money he had in his pocket to his wife,
  but he refused to tell me who had shot him. He had the old criminal's code of
  'never tell.' Daddy asked him twice to make a statement, but he refused. So
  far as I could gather, there had been a quarrel; and I am sure, though Lordy
  did not tell us, that he was asked to come secretly to the house, where
  Lavinski was waiting for him, perhaps to bribe him to silence. When did you
  guess?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I half guessed," said Dick, "when Lavinski did not know that his father
  limped. On his return the old man must have been bedridden. He used to do all
  his business in what I call the office room, which I believe must have been
  the room where he had his clandestine meetings and his secret wife. And
  Lavinski knew nothing about her! That was the second jar to me. He invented
  her name, 'Miss Constable,' on the spur of the moment."</p>

  <p>"What will happen to him?" asked Mary after a pause.</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It is going to be terribly difficult to convict him. The
  Public Prosecutor will not allow the charge of murder to go through; he
  thinks the jury would fail to convict, and after that we could not, of
  course, make any other charge. He will probably get a lifer."</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"All my childhood has been spent in this atmosphere of detection, and I
  suppose I must expect it to continue all my life. And, Dick, that idea of our
  being married together, you and I and Tommy and Jane&mdash;we've got to give
  it up! Tommy won't hear of it. He's scared to death he'll get me by
  mistake!"</p>
