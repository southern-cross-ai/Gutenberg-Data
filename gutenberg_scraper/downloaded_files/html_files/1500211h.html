<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. EARLY DAYS (AND SOME
OTHERS)</h2>

<p>I have been a wanderer all my days, in intent when not actually
in action, so if I ramble a bit in these reminiscences it is from
force of incurable habit.</p>

<p>Anyway, let me get down the basic facts that I was born in the
mining township of Stawell (it became the Borough of Stawell that
very year), and that this event, of so much importance to me, took
place at midnight on the 4th of January, 1869. The hour led to some
confusion in after days. We have always celebrated the event as
happening on the 4th; it was only when I entered the Public
Service, and had to obtain a birth certificate, that we discovered
that father had registered me as arriving on the 5th. They say that
a man doesn't waken his <i>second</i> child to hear the infant
laugh&mdash;perhaps father was not quite so particular about me,
the fifth youngster, as he would have been with the first.</p>

<p>I am reminded (I can't help this rambling) that in later years I
discovered that an old friend, Jessie Stewart, had also been born
on January 4. I sent her a card:</p>

<p class="blurb">We are both of us modest folk, I hope,<br>
Who would deprecate a fuss,<br>
<i>But I think they started the New Year well<br>
When they started it with Us!</i></p>

<p>One of my earliest recollections is of a day when I was playing
in the front garden of our house in Houston Street. I was a very
small boy indeed. There was a sudden rush of feet, a roar of angry
men, and I looked through the fence to see a hatless stranger,
racing literally for his life, pursued by a group of miners.</p>

<p>'Jumpers!' said someone, and on the word I was inside, and
hiding behind my mother.</p>

<p>That was my share of the famous claim-jumping riots in Stawell
when the 'Pleasant Creek Jumps Association' was formed in Ballarat
to 'jump' certain Stawell gold mines about the validity of whose
leases there was some doubt, and the diggers of my native town
turned out in force to repel the invaders. That memory goes back a
long way: I was about three years old at the time.</p>

<p>Earlier still is the memory of a warm afternoon, a summer day of
the old type when extreme heat would persist for a week or more
without a break. How old would I be? I had been 'put down' for the
day-sleep of very young childhood, so I must have been a tiny boy
indeed. There was a plate of fruit at my side when I woke. Through
the mists of the years I am aware of that fact and that the house
was empty (which probably impressed the scene on my mind); also I
know that my people had all gone to the near-by dam of water
because a boy had just been drowned there. I could name that
unfortunate lad now.</p>

<p>Stawell, and school at No. 502, and the sand-heaps of the
crushing batteries, and the busy mines, and all the world (and his
wife and children) walking up and down Main Street on a Saturday
night, and the peppermint-flavoured Presbyterian Church on Sunday
mornings&mdash;at first St. Mark's, for did not my people break
away from St. Matthew's and help to build a kirk of their
ain?&mdash;and always and ever the Bush&mdash;these made up much of
my early life. Then walks to the Big Hill, right in the town; to
the Cemetery, to the Hospital, and with greater years greater
distances&mdash;to the Black Range on a Saturday (where I tore
critically my only trousers on one sad occasion and had to lurk in
the rocks while the picnic with Her in it, proceeded gaily below)
and finally to that goal of every youngster's dream in those
days&mdash;the Grampians.</p>

<p>Is there anything more deplorable in humanity, by the way, than
the desire to destroy Nature's fine work, the craving to buy a
paltry prominence at the expense of some magnificent natural
monument! The remarkable Sister Rocks near Stawell are covered from
base to crown with names, painted or tarred or cut, the owners of
which have even taken ladders to assist in the desecration. On the
stone face of the Splitters' Falls in Hall's Gap in the Grampians
(I blush!) are chiselled the names of three youths who now know
better. Kindly Nature has modified my shame by covering those names
with lichen, but they may still be traced by the curious, for they
are cut deeply.</p>

<p>That was my first camp, just past Delly's Bridge in Hall's Gap.
Bill Grant (afterwards General Grant, C.M.G., D.S.O., Order of the
Nile and Bar), Bill Webster (later to become Chief Clerk of the
Education Department), and myself were the trio. This trinity of
bush-lovers increased at times to a quartette by the addition of
Grant's cousin, Bill Blair, son of David Blair, the old historian
of Australia, who, by the way, was the first man to encourage me to
write. But that was to come much later. Bill Blair, coming all the
way from Melbourne, was only an occasional partner.</p>

<p>My one school was the State School in Stawell, ruled over by
Dick Davies ('Dick' was short for the incredible name Richard
Zerubabel); a vigorous hearty man who administered firmly, but with
humanity, and with a rare understanding of juvenile human nature.
The odd things that linger in the mind after more than half a
century!&mdash;I recall his coming into the junior second class (it
was perched perilously in one of those abominations known as a
gallery) and testing the class in spelling. Now I was good at
spelling (no pun) and I scored until he gave me the word 'egg.' In
retrospect I feel that my persistence in rendering it
'<i>a</i>-g-g' was a reflection upon the common pronunciation of
the word rather than upon my abilities.</p>

<p>The teacher's life is not an easy one, but it has its
compensations. A good teacher makes every year a new generation of
friends who will honour his name in after days. Dick Davies was a
fine man and he had a fine team. I wish, in gratitude, that I could
say something here about each of those men and women, all now gone
beyond the voices, who did so much for me, as for others. I shall
mention two only&mdash;Tom Webster (a cousin of my lifelong friend
Bill Webster) and that very successful and prominent man of
business, F. J. Cato&mdash;the first because his influence upon me,
as a member of the highest class in the school, was so stimulating;
the other because of his remarkable progress, as one of the firm of
Moran and Cato and because of his generous benefactions to charity
in the years of his retirement. He abandoned schoolwork at an early
age to take up commerce. My most vivid recollection of him at
school is connected with a cane which he used across my shoulders
one day in class. I'll bet that I deserved it.</p>

<p>It was a big school then, for the town was at the peak of its
gold getting. Mines were indeed worth 'jumping' with the precious
metal being produced literally by the ton. That is not overstating
it. The Pleasant Creek Cross Reefs (known to us as the Duke)
yielded 241,461 ounces in one period of eight years and eventually
paid its shareholders £750,000 in dividends. One man held 2,000
shares: from 'Bill the Smelter' he became the Hon. W. H. Osmand,
M.L.C. As a Legislative Councillor, by the way, he was noted, like
the Harp of Tara, for his enduring silences&mdash;but that in
passing. Crushing batteries, reducing the quartz to sand, thundered
away from midnight Sunday to midnight Saturday without a pause. So
continuous was the roar that no-one was aware of it until it
stopped (is that an Irishism?). Then the old folk woke up,
wondering at the stillness.</p>

<p>All the mines, and there were many, were working three shifts. A
miner's pay was 8/- a day, 48/- a week for 48 hours' work. One of
my early jobs, when I left school to succeed my brother as the
whole staff of Messrs. Bennett and Bristow, legal managers and
insurance agents in the Main Street (with what pride I took home my
£1 a week!) was to pay those wages every fortnight to the men of a
couple of mines. Later, as yields decreased, I was to make many an
excursion along the 'street called Straight' (Main Street, Stawell,
has as many angles as a book on geometry) with a lump of smelted
gold in my pocket to see which bank would give the highest price.
Pure alluvial gold was then worth just over £4 an ounce; this
smelted stuff was valued at from £3/17/3 to £3/17/9. To-day the
price would be twice as high. I can still see the bank tellers
rubbing the bar or dump on a test-stone before making an offer.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption"><b>'THE WOOD-GOD'<br>
(Web Gilbert carves a statue of the author.)</b>
</p>

<p>Low wages in those times! But there seemed to be no
unemployment, and no real grinding poverty.</p>

<p>Social strata in the town there were of course, but, as is
customary, they were mostly woman-created.</p>

<p>Men who had worked together in earlier days did not change as a
rule when some struck riches and their mates didn't. One of the
wealthiest stood in the porch of his new house one morning and saw
his friend the old milkman pass, carrying two cans. Both men hailed
from Scotland. Rain was falling heavily. 'Tak' the lids off,
Jamie,' advised the sheltered one. 'No need, Wullie, they've had
enough a'ready,' came the reply, and the two old friends nodded at
each other appreciatively.</p>

<p>'Breathes there a man with soul so dead.'&mdash;Stawell has a
halo about it which grows more definite to me with the years of
separation. There are no impressions so vivid as those of boyhood.
The bush about Stawell, the Black Range, Doctor's Creek, the
Seventy Foot, the Silver Shilling, the Flying Doe, the
Grampians&mdash;our Saturday and holiday tramps to such places gave
me that taste for vagabondage which has since led me far. How we
ate on those trips! Our careful mothers tried to over-estimate our
appetites, but we came home each time with never a crust of the
food we took away in such quantity.</p>

<p>Marcus Clarke had lived at Ledcourt, not far from Stawell, for a
time. He was a legendary character in my day and later I was to
come closer to that legend when I joined the Public Library, though
I never saw the author of <i>His Natural Life.</i> One of his
Stawell friends was N. Walter Swan, then editing the <i>Pleasant
Creek News and Stawell Chronicle.</i> Swan wrote at least two
novels&mdash;<i>A Couple of Cups Ago</i> and <i>Luke Mivers'
Harvest.</i> The latter won a prize of £100 given by the Sydney
<i>Mail</i> for the best tale by an Australian (they called it
'Colonial' then) author. His family at that time interested me more
than did his writings: I was very young and his daughters were very
charming. They still are.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. 'THE MECHANICS'</h2>

<p>In 1886 I passed the clerical examination of the Public Service,
an examination for which I had to sit in Ballarat, and I was
appointed to the staff of the Melbourne Public Library. Was ever
such luck! I was a booky boy, a reader of everything I could lay
hands on, and here I was thrust into the midst of one of the
greatest collections of literature in the southern hemisphere. My
people had never been well-to-do, but mother had always contrived,
somehow, to keep my brother and myself in reading matter. I said
'somehow'&mdash;as I grew up I realized that those books were
bought very often with money which our mother should rightly have
spent upon herself.</p>

<p>September of that year saw me embark on the great adventure.
Armed with a carpet-bag (yes, truly, a carpet bag) in which my
careful sister Mary had sewn a list of its rather scanty contents
(I have that list still), I left the old Borough for the big City
and duly reported for duty to Dr. Bride, then Librarian of the
Public Library. I was raw, nervous, sensitive, and no doubt
extremely gauche, but, I think, not so crude as some of the great
band of provincial youngsters who were passing the service
examinations in those years, so enriching the city at the expense
of the country. One of them, it is alleged, announced himself to
the head of his Department, a lordly being sitting in lofty
seclusion, by marching in, placing his bag carefully down by the
great man's table and remarking simply: 'I've come!'</p>

<p>The Library exercised a notable influence upon my life. There I
began to write, so shyly that I would not show the stuff to my
mother even&mdash;that mother who all her days was so interested in
her children's progress.</p>

<p>It is a comical thing, by the way, that in most Victorian
country towns the local library is known as the Mechanics'
Institute&mdash;always shortened in speech to 'the Mechanics.' My
birthplace, of course, had its library so-named. After I had been a
year or two in the magnificent Public Library of Melbourne, long
enough that is to have established the pride in its wonderful
collection which I shall ever feel, I met an old schoolfellow just
down from Stawell on a holiday. 'Let's see, Bob,' said he,
reflectively, 'you're in the Mechanics, aren't you?'</p>

<p>Dr. Bride was then librarian (we had a Bride and a Husband, a
Bath and a Brazier on the staff) and Dr. Gagliardi was engaged in a
reclassification of the whole collection of books, following the
opening of the Barry Hall.</p>

<p>Dear old Gagliardi: what a fine man he was to be with! He had
excellent English in construction but some pronunciations were most
amusingly beyond him. He would sound, for instance, the final
consonant in such words as young, shilling, and lamb. His disgust
with the accepted sound of a word like McLeod was comical. I
enjoyed thoroughly, as we worked together, his lectures on the
superiority of Italian over what he called our barbarous language.
He seemed to me a much more able man than Bride, who, by the way,
was never popular with the staff.</p>

<p>M. F. Dowden, E. La T. Armstrong and R. D. Boys, each to be
chief librarian in turn, were on the staff in those days; another
was E. H. C. Oliphant, lately deceased, who returned from America
as Professor Oliphant. My old friend James McConnell Kerr, surely
the wittiest of barristers, was to join us later, and so was James
S. Battye, now B.A., LL.B., LITT.D., Chief Librarian of the Public
Library of Western Australia and Chancellor of the University
there.</p>

<p>The Library still held traditions of Marcus Clarke and the great
Sir Redmond Barry, founder of the institution. An old attendant
told us of Clarke's coming in one day clad all in white, and Barry,
a stickler for what he conceived to be suitable garb for a public
officer, demanding with an oath if Clarke knew how a gentleman
should dress. The retort was an inquiry directed to Barry's
acquaintance with how a gentleman should speak. This sounds
apocryphal.</p>

<p>I learnt to love (literally) that great institution&mdash;the
Public Library, Museums and National Gallery of Victoria, and I
have lost, and lose, no opportunity of serving it.</p>

<p>It was my Alma Mater, the source from which I drew most of my
mental nourishment. I sampled everything in it from Theology (which
commenced the classification in the north end of the main
hall&mdash;this was long before the present rotunda was built) to
Geography, which concluded it in the east end of the Barry Hall.
The whole of the books, except a few shelves of indecencies, and
some rare, and very valuable, volumes kept in the Librarian's room,
as well as the art and medical works in the Gallery, were in bays
open to the readers. There was no need to ask for anything: you
went to the shelves and helped yourself. A wonderful institution, a
true cultural centre with its associated art gallery and museums, a
place which is in truth a monument to the pioneers of the State,
for they, led by the redoubtable Redmond Barry, had laid its
foundations before settlement here was twenty years old.</p>

<p>I think it was in 1891&mdash;anyway, I was still a junior
librarian&mdash;that I saved Rudyard Kipling's life, or so it
pleases me to think. But for me, the world may never have known the
Jungle Books, the Just So Stories, Kim, and, indeed, most of the
works, prose and verse, which made Kipling such a leading figure in
English literature. That sounds boastful: well, it is meant to
sound boastful. Said firmly it tends to smother the feeling, which
will unfortunately persist in me, that Kipling never realized that
he had had such a narrow escape. Memory has a trick of wearing
magnifying glasses&mdash;it is quite possible that that life-saving
feat was not so very remarkable. This is what happened: Kipling was
paying his only visit to Australia when I met him&mdash;a
pleasant-spoken, well-knit figure of a man, young in those days, of
course, with just a touch of 'bay' in his 'good-bye'; obviously,
but not typically, English. He and Bill Blair (son of the then
doyen of the Melbourne journalists) and a Japanese and I walked
down Collins Street together from the Austral Salon (the Oyster
Saloon we irreverent boys called it) and as we crossed Swanston
Street a cab, a wild and wobbly one-horse cab, charged down upon
us. I grasped the great man's arm and hurried him out of danger
just in time.</p>

<p>It is odd to reflect, in these days, that a horse-drawn vehicle
was once the terror of the crossings.</p>

<p>It is odder still to remember that the trustees of our Melbourne
Public Library banned Kipling's books for a while on the ground
(shades of the present-day censorship!) of indecency! I think it
was a reference to Indian society "playing tennis with the Seventh
Commandment" that caused the trouble. The offending volume was
locked up in the librarian's room, and the public was saved from
pollution&mdash;for a time, anyway! Well do I recollect the
amusement of all (save the trustees) who knew of the embargo. He
was also charged, but this charge was more general, with obscurity,
mainly because of his use of Indian words in those early works.
Apropos this he wrote in one of his books when here (if the owner
is still this side Glory, may she forgive me the quotation). Girls
in those days, by the way, had 'mops' of hair:</p>

<p class="poem">'If seven maids with seven mops<br>
Should read for half a year,<br>
Do you suppose,' the author said,<br>
'That they could make it clear?'<br>
'I doubt it,' said the publisher,<br>
'They're only human here!'</p>

<p>The present generation may find it difficult to realize what an
effect this brilliant and forceful young Anglo-Indian writer had
upon us. We youngsters had a burning admiration for
him&mdash;'Kiplingitis,' we named it. After all, we were only
sharing what became a world-wide fever. His Indian stories had
struck a new and arresting note which caught the public taste and,
because it was so novel, had divided the critics into at least two
camps. His truly remarkable Barrack Room Ballads were appearing in
the <i>Scots</i> (later called the <i>National) Observer</i> and
their vigour and originality stirred us like a trumpet call. It was
about this time that J. K. Stephen, with a savage note in his
clever verse, prayed to be translated to a shore&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Where the Rudyards cease from kipling<br>
And the Haggards Ride no more.</p>

<p>I pressed Kipling to say when he would give us the <i>Book of
Mother Maturin</i> (see the final story in <i>Plain Tales from the
Hills)</i> and I wanted badly to know when that grizzled Ulysses,
Terence Mulvaney, would fulfil the curse of ould Mother Sheehy and
'die quick in a strange land, watchin' your death before ut takes
you an' onable to stir hand or foot!' (To-day I would ask him to
finish <i>Kim.)</i> He put me off, of course, and countered with an
inquiry regarding cash betting on our racecourses. I could hardly
be regarded as an authority, having never (then) had a bet, but I
was able to assure him that in my experience (I <i>had</i> seen the
Melbourne Cup once, and then only from the Flat) it was ALL cash
betting! How cheerfully omniscient is Youth, and how willing to
oblige!</p>

<p>Kipling came to the Library one day, and, to my great delight
(bear in mind I was very young), recognized me and gave me a
cordial handshake. He left without having attracted the attention
of the hierarchy of the institution, so far as I know.</p>

<p>Sitting in the little old Presbyterian Church of Evandale,
Tasmania, in the month of January, 1936, I heard the preacher
announce the death of the 'unofficial Laureate of the Empire,' and
I recalled gratefully his wonderful contribution to the literary
wealth of the world. I recalled, too, a small thing which showed
the human side of the man. My son Robin, when very young, was given
<i>Just-So Stories.</i> I read them to him. He asked who wrote
them. The result was a childish note in printed characters (the
only way he could write) in which he thanked Mr. Kipling for the
stories and signed himself 'with love from Robin Croll.' I thought
such a testimonial, unsolicited, artless, might be valued by
anyone. I posted it to Kipling and forgot the incident. By return
mail, however, was a letter headed 'Bateman's, Burwash, Sussex':
the great man had acknowledged promptly and in doing so declared
that 'when an infant of that age is moved to sit down and write
with his own hand, it is a most convincing proof of his gratitude
and it makes me very proud.'</p>

<p class="poem">The sea-coast of Bohemia<br>
Is pleasant to the view</p>

<p>sang Hebblethwaite. My earliest knowledge of that delectable
land came when I was still an assistant in the Public Library. It
came in the shape of a little weekly titled <i>Bohemia,</i> which
was 'run' by a group of the younger journalists of the day, who
took it in turns to act as editor. (To-day, by the way, a new
<i>Bohemia</i> has come to birth&mdash;a monthly sponsored by the
Bread and Cheese Club.) The <i>Argus</i> owes that original journal
something, for out of it was born the 'Oriel' column, a feature of
its Saturday issue for so many years. Rumour had it that John
Sandes and Davison Symmons were told that they could choose between
<i>Bohemia</i> and the paper which employed them; they could not
serve both. So 'Oriel' was created, and 'The Passing Show' started
to give exercise to their skill in light prose and lighter verse,
and very excellently did they perform in the new column.</p>

<p>To <i>Bohemia</i> I began contributing, first scraps of book
gossip (I used to get first view of the old-world literary journals
as the mail arrived at the Library&mdash;well do I remember
announcing the forthcoming publication in Lippincott's Magazine of
Kipling's <i>Light that Failed),</i> then I wrote prose sketches,
then verse. All were anonymous, of course; so shy was I that I
think I could have denied the authorship had anyone charged me! The
Blair girls, Lily and Florrie, knew, for they were of the
<i>Bohemia</i> group and to them I gave my stuff. One of them was
later to do a great deal of <i>Bulletin</i> matter. Their veteran
father (to whom I have already referred) was an astonishing mine of
knowledge and good stories. He knew Dublin and 'Silver's Theayter'
where, you may remember, Mulvaney claimed to have seen
<i>Hamlet</i> played in a new black eye and the Queen as full as a
cornucopia. An old tale David Blair repeated was of the night when
the crowd proceeded to throw a man over the ledge of the gallery
into the pit. The gallery at each end extended above the orchestra.
'Hould on, bhoys!' yelled a voice. 'Don't whaste the mhan! Kill a
fiddler wid him!'</p>

<p>I have said that the old journalist and historian was a mine of
knowledge. Well he knew it. Donald Macdonald told me he went along
for a talk one afternoon. He had the talk all right&mdash;a
monologue. When he was leaving, his host said: 'Come along some day
and hear me again. I'm worth it!'</p>

<p>And so he was, as Macdonald confessed and as I myself can
testify.</p>

<p>The little journal <i>Bohemia</i> lived longer than most of its
kind; but of course it died in a very few years. The Public Library
is a magnificent tomb in which lie buried the remains of numberless
dead and gone Melbourne magazines.</p>

<p>Another which comes to mind was <i>The Outpost.</i> It, I think,
was originally <i>The Cycling News,</i> cycling being the sport of
the day. <i>Bohemia</i> was much above the average, and the
<i>Outpost</i> was at times brilliant. Three of the outstanding
artistic contributors were Norman and Lionel Lindsay and Blamire
Young, and its columns attracted most of the interesting writers of
the period, including that able journalist, E. C. Buley, then in
the Mint, but earlier with me in the Library, who later published a
number of books in London. I think it was he who invented the
caption for the sporting column: 'The Quick and the Dead.' Carey,
the editor, was a very able man. His departure from Australia was a
matter of great regret to many. One thing I have not yet forgiven
him for. Jack Castieau was doing a weekly sketch of men who had
been prominent in the land boom. Each was supposed to be talking in
his sleep and the revelations were very amusing&mdash;to everyone
but the victims. To Carey one day there entered the burly figure of
one of those notabilities, a man who 'came back' eventually and
thoroughly rehabilitated himself. Indeed, he became Premier of
Victoria. He had heard that he was to be served up next week and
asked for mercy, pleading that the dead past should not be raked up
against him now that he was on the up grade again. 'I know what
you're going to say against me, Mr. Carey,' he went on earnestly.
'You are going to say that I have a wife and family in every suburb
and that I neglect them. I <i>don't</i> neglect them, Mr. Carey!' I
have always thought that any editor with bowels should have
'let-off' a man who could make so naive a plea. But the article
appeared.</p>

<p>Collectors should search for a very vivid poster issued by the
Lindsays (Norman and Lionel) for the <i>Outpost.</i> It represents
a pirate with all the raciness that those talented artists could
put into such a subject, and it is probably unique in the fact that
it is signed "Lindsay Brothers." Other posters of that period, rare
enough now and worth collecting, are those done for Joshua Brothers
to advertise their Boomerang Brandy. Blamire Young designed
them.</p>

<p>When I think of the Library period I am reminded of the 'fine
confused feeding' which the famous Scot said he found in a sheep's
head. I came from the place with an interest quickened in an
amazing number of things, if with no great knowledge of any. With
E. C. Buley, Bernard O'Dowd, H. A. Corbett (who eventually settled
in Western Australia), my brother, and a couple of other youthful
enthusiasts, we formed a reading circle. How is this for a bill of
fare for young minds&mdash;Herbert Spencer's <i>Principles of
Sociology,</i> Goethe's <i>Wilhelm Meister,</i> Henry George's
<i>Progress and Poverty,</i> Oliver Wendell Holmes' <i>Autocrat of
the Breakfast Table,</i> Edwin Arnold's <i>Light of Asia</i> and,
of course, Whitman's <i>Leaves of Grass.</i> I still count it a
well-balanced diet, heavy enough, light enough, thought-compelling,
excellent from the literary point of view. We read the books aloud,
a portion of each at a sitting, and discussed them.</p>

<p>I think Buley and O'Dowd were the leaders. Buley had a keen
analytical mind and was blest with real humour. O'Dowd had even
then an encyclopaedic knowledge. Those two were to rise notably in
the literary world, Buley to become an editor and author in London,
where he died, O'Dowd to take a foremost place in Australian
letters. The latter's Celtic ancestors had endowed him with a rare
capacity for enthusiasm. It carried him from the Roman Catholic
religion to rationalism and from there, or I should say while still
there, to sample many forms of belief. A fellow poet, when we were
amusing ourselves by composing epitaphs for people still alive,
wrote this of O'Dowd:</p>

<p class="poem">Here beneath his sable shroud<br>
Lies the Laureate O'Dowd,<br>
Who upon Earth's flowery lap<br>
Had all sorts of Heavens on tap;<br>
Olympus, Asgard, Aidenn, and,<br>
Worst of all, the Silent Land.<br>
Undecided here he lies<br>
Wondering which to patronize.</p>

<p>But that epitaph reflects very little of the true greatness of
my old friend. He moved from opinion to opinion, from belief to
belief, because of no shallowness of intellect, but because of the
very intensity of his study of each and the sincerity and honesty
of his mind. I confess to an admiration and a liking for O'Dowd
which nothing can shake. My 'of course' with regard to <i>Leaves of
Grass</i> referred to O'Dowd's devotion to Whitman, with whom he
had much correspondence.</p>

<p>One day Emil Creed, musician and analytical chemist, who somehow
had come to be a fellow assistant in the Library, asked me if I
cared for wine, women and song, because, if I did, he could put me
on to something. It proved to me Fitzgerald's 'Omar Khayyam.' The
music of it sang in my blood, the pagan philosophy wakened my mind
to new and wonderful audacities&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">O Thou who Man of baser earth didst make<br>
And even with Paradise devise the Snake&mdash;<br>
For all the sin with which the face of Man<br>
Is blackened, Man's forgiveness give&mdash;and take!</p>

<p>An old diary shows that I copied almost the whole of that
remarkable set of verses. This, of course, was long before they
became a popular Christmas card! Creed it was who introduced me to
good orchestral music and told me how to recognize a fugue when I
heard it. We spent many an evening and afternoon at Cowen's
concerts, both at, and following, the 1888 Exhibition. If my more
common taste rejoiced particularly in Phil. Langdale and his
amusing bassoon I came also, though more gradually, to appreciate
Wagner and classical works generally. Melbourne was truly musical
in those years and we could hear first-class renderings of great
compositions by paying a shilling (no amusement tax then) for a
seat in the south gallery of the Town Hall. And that south gallery
was about the best place in the house for hearing&mdash;a knowledge
we hugged to our frugal bosoms for it heightened our enjoyment.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. THE PUBLIC SERVICE</h2>

<p>But three of my boyhood friends in Bill Webster, Gus Scoullar
and Ernest Kent were in the Education Office and I eventually, by
transfer in January, 1892, became the fourth Stawellite there. (I
started on £60 a year at the Library; I was now earning £100 a
year.) We had been at State School No. 502 together and to this day
we remain good friends, but there was something special about the
bond between Webster and myself. Match this for a record of the
lives of two unrelated people: Born in a provincial town within a
few hundred yards of each other and with only four months
separating the births; attended the same school; appointed to the
Public Service in the same year; boarded in Melbourne in the same
suburb; served in the same Department for many years and concluded
that service in the same room, one as Chief Clerk, the other as
Senior Clerk; never lived farther apart from one another than they
do now&mdash;and one is in Kew and the other in Camberwell.
Parallel lives&mdash;yet each has always had his own distinctively
individual tastes and has followed a separate course in most of the
important matters that make up life.</p>

<p>The change from the Library's almost monastic seclusion (save on
wet holidays&mdash;and then, well, the deluge!) to be part of the
huge machinery of one of the biggest Departments of the State was a
marked one. Many a time I longed to go back, but my new colleagues
proved good fellows in most cases and it was easy to be reconciled.
A group of the men, though, has left a bad taste in the mouth of
memory. It was a hard-bitten half-dozen of the elders, hard
drinkers all, usually short of cash and very willing to induce the
more foolish of the youngsters to 'see life' ('Life with a capital
Hell,' as Kipling has it); in other words, the seniors were quite
prepared to spend the juniors' money. The result was disastrous to
several bright lads. One went to the pack with drink, a couple of
others were dogged by money-lenders all their remaining official
days.</p>

<p>Officialdom is an interesting study. I had an escape door,
fortunately, in outside interests which kept me individual, but
there were many of my colleagues who seemed to be no more than cogs
in a machine. Here let me break a lance in defence of a
much-maligned service. First always to bear the brunt of hard
times&mdash;the implication seeming to be that the Service had
caused them; referred to by sections of the Press as though to be a
public servant was necessarily to be a loafer; I want to record,
from knowledge and not hearsay, that the Victorian State Service,
as a whole, is composed of a magnificent body of workers. Men
<i>live</i> their jobs; night after night there are officers
working overtime in those public buildings without any special fee
or gratuity, with no other reward, indeed, than the satisfaction of
knowing that they are keeping their work up to date.</p>

<p>The last of the Old Timers has long gone, relics as they were of
a period when the qualification for a post was influence. The
examination system has replaced them by men who, in many cases,
would have made names for themselves in any other sphere of life,
but who are swallowed up in a system which permits of hardly any
individual recognition. But if there is anything of value in the
pronouncement of a Minister of the Crown, at any time, anywhere,
you may depend upon it a public servant's brains very largely
informed it; if there is anything futile you can be sure it went in
against a public servant's advice.</p>

<p>I would not suggest that I was in that first flight, but because
it was known that my writings were acceptable to newspapers I have
been given the interesting task, not once but many times, of
preparing speeches for Ministers, and on several occasions the
rounded periods and more or less telling phrases, the facts and
suggestions, the amusing anecdotes and the moving peroration, of a
Premier's speech all came from my pen. Indeed, there is a full page
article in one of England's most authoritative financial journals,
under the signature of the Premier of the day, every word of which
I wrote.</p>

<p>That was a very special job and a rush one. Owing to the mass of
matter to be digested, I spent a whole week-end upon it, also a
couple of nights and my lunch times. These spoilt and over-paid
public servants!&mdash;I did not receive so much as 'thank you'
from the gentleman whom I had obliged. My reward was a copy of the
magazine when the article appeared&mdash;that and no more. In
fairness I should mention that I was not asked to pay for the copy!
It cost sixpence.</p>

<p>Some other unusual jobs came my way. One day I was summoned to
Cabinet. I went with trepidation&mdash;what had I done? Was I to be
charged with an offence or offered promotion? Neither; the
Honourable the Treasurer said the Cabinet was taking sides in a
certain struggle&mdash;could I write some verses for publication to
assist the cause? Well, of course I could, and I did, and they were
duly given prominence in the press&mdash;not under my name, of
course. I hae ma doots about their having had any effect on the
issue at stake, but the Treasurer must have liked the effort, for
later he called upon me again, this time for what he was pleased to
name 'a poem' to commemorate a certain national anniversary. That
was not quite so easy, but it was done&mdash;the curious may see
the result in my little book of verses <i>By-Products,</i> under
the title of 'The Singing Wind.' The fee in each case was the same,
but, anyway, I was thanked on this occasion.</p>

<p>With that great-hearted and witty Under-Treasurer, M. A.
Minogue, I wrote a Budget for that careful State Treasurer, Sir
William McPherson. Later I spent over a year in Parliament House as
Secretary to a Royal Commission on Fisheries, and several months in
the State Electricity Commission's office, again as Secretary of a
Royal Commission&mdash;this time on what was known as the Police
Strike; when the Prince of Wales (afterwards King Edward) visited
Australia the Premier (Mr. H. S. W. Lawson) sent me along to assist
the organizer for Victoria, who had fallen ill; I have been on a
Visual Education Committee, a Physical Culture Committee, a
Broadcasting Committee&mdash;these samples of official duties will
serve to show that the routine admits of variation.</p>

<p>The Education Department, despite its ten thousand employees,
its thousands of schools, its three millions, or thereabouts, of
expenditure, and its outstanding importance to the State, has
earned the title of Cinderella of the Departments. Anyone, not
otherwise provided for, has generally been good enough, when
Cabinets were being formed, for the post of Minister of Education.
A few Ministers were excellent, but the list of the inept is an
appalling one. When I said this to a well-known politician (himself
a Minister) his remark was: 'Yes; in creating a Cabinet there are
always certain outstanding men whose professions or known
inclinations suggest that they should be given the Treasury, Law,
Lands, Public Works, Mines or Forests. Things move smoothly till
somebody says "Oh, don't let us forget old So-and-So; we'll have to
give him something." There's a pause, then "Give him Education,"
and all are satisfied. That's how you get your Ministers!'</p>

<p>Now that Minister, often with no more qualifications for the
post than that he was a good Party man, is endowed with power, by
virtue of his office, to sit in judgment upon and to cancel or
modify the plans of, a permanent head who may have given a lifetime
to the special study of the subject. Such a permanent head was Mr.
Frank Tate, the first Director of Education, a man outstanding in
Australia and with an international reputation as an educationist.
The farmer, or storekeeper, or tradesman, or whatnot, who found
himself, as Minister of Education, directing the Director of
Education, would doubtless have smiled scornfully had that Director
put himself up as adviser, really dictator, in the business of
farming, storekeeping or whatever pursuit the Minister followed in
private life.</p>

<p>At a public dinner a year or two ago I suggested that we are
over-blessed with statutes and that it would be a good idea to
proclaim a close season for politicians for a period of five years,
during which time the public service should administer the existing
laws, but have no power to add to them. I am more than half serious
in advocating that to-day. Think of the peace of it!</p>

<p>Minogue, already mentioned, was one of the finest men with whom
I made friends in the public offices. An Irish Catholic, he
collected all the tales against Scotsmen to retail to me, the son
of an Aberdeen father and an Edinburgh mother. In return I never
missed a chance to recount a good one against the Irish. We formed
a sort of Joke Exchange. I remember his joy when I told him of the
Irishman who said it was the fine job he had got&mdash;oh, the fine
job! He was pullin' down a Protestant church and gettin' paid for
it! Poor Minogue, a fine friend, and a man capable of the most
generous acts. Roman Catholic as he was, I knew him to join O. R.
Snowball, prominent Orangeman, in an appeal for a down-and-out
Methodist. I wrote the address the Service presented to Minogue on
his retirement. In it I said, with truth: 'May you never be short
of a good story, for assuredly you will never be short of a friend
to tell it to.' He did not live long to enjoy retirement. A stroke
took him off one day in the public offices: he died in my arms.</p>

<p>He it was who introduced me to the Hon. George Michael
Prendergast, an old Stawellite whom I had not met till then. In an
aside, let me boast a little of my native town. It has produced
many notable men, but I shall name only four&mdash;Mr. Prendergast,
who rose to be Premier of Victoria; Mr. Alex. Cooch, who became
head of what is probably the greatest of our State institutions,
the Savings Bank; Mr. Dave Bell, Chairman of that other great
institution, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works; and Mr.
T. W. Bearup, Manager of the Australian Broadcasting
Commission.</p>

<p>The Hon. George Michael was looking for a Secretary for the
Fisheries Commission, of which he had just been appointed Chairman.
Half-a-dozen other Members of Parliament completed the board. I was
reluctant to take the job, but yielded, and I must say I enjoyed
the experience. Incidentally, I formed a sound liking for my
Chairman. The inquiry extended over a year, during which my
headquarters were the Assembly rooms at the Exhibition Building.
For a proper estimate of the worth of Parliament and the
party-system, I commend a few months in the House 'without the
option.'</p>

<p>Some of the relationships there were astonishing. Publicly the
late O. R. Snowball was in the opposite camp to G. M. Prendergast,
but personally they were the closest of friends. Both were on the
Commission. Each took me aside to assure me of the other's
worth&mdash;'a capital fellow,' said the Orangeman of the Roman
Catholic; 'one of the best,' was the verdict of the Catholic on the
Orangeman. They were excellent companions to travel with, and their
jokes with one another were endless. Each scored a point on one of
our trips. As Secretary, I had forgotten the Bible on which to
swear the witnesses. The only one I could get hold of in the little
fishing village was a Douai version&mdash;the Catholic Bible. 'Not
a word to Snowball,' I warned the Chairman, and the session was
duly carried through. But Prendergast <i>had</i> to tell the tale,
and loud was his crowing over 'Snowy.' At the very next village,
however, the only Bible I could borrow was one bound and prepared
for Masonic services. 'Not a word to the Chairman,' was now my
warning to Snowball, who, as soon as the meeting was over,
proceeded, with mock gravity, to 'get his own back' over the first
incident. All this with the utmost good-nature on both sides.</p>

<p>By the way, the final witness there seemed a trifle confused. He
told me confidentially: 'Jus'-had-a-pint-o'bran'y.' He made it one
word. Whatever he had had, he couldn't stand steady, but swayed
gently back and forth as if a wind blew. He was in a mood to agree
to anything. 'Take the Book in your right hand,' commanded the
Chairman. 'Now repeat after me: I swear by Almighty God that the
evidence that I shall give before this Commission shall be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.' The drunk
beamed on him with admiration. 'Yeah!' he answered impressively.
Then, with emphasis: 'Thash <i>right!'</i></p>

<p>When all is going smoothly and all his plans are working out as
arranged, the Secretary of a Commission has nothing to do but
listen to the evidence and jot down comments to guide him later as
to the credibility of the witnesses. Here is a note made at such a
time, which I handed to the Chairman:</p>

<p class="letter">The gentleman is on his oath,<br>
But, speaking without bias,<br>
I'd sooner take the simple word<br>
Of good old Ananias!</p>

<p>One more anecdote about George Michael Prendergast. Few men of
my acquaintance could tell a better tale than he. This is the story
of his Waterloo. We were in Klug's Hotel at Queenscliff, waiting
for dinner. There were half a dozen M's.P. present. A solitary
stranger sat by the fire sucking a pipe and surveying us with
interested eyes. The Hon. George told a good yarn, directed largely
to the outsider, and told it so well that we laughed and laughed
again. All, that is, but the stranger, who took his pipe out of his
mouth, regarded the speaker gravely, almost with a puzzled air,
then fell to smoking again. Such behaviour was a challenge to our
Chairman. He was not accustomed to having one of his jokes, and a
good one at that, ignored. Almost pointedly addressing the stranger
this time, he told another. It was even better than the first, and
again we were convulsed. The man at the fire had watched the talker
with rapt attention, pipe in hand. At the point he looked at us all
curiously&mdash;and resumed his smoking without a sign. We were now
watching the duel with interest, but just as the tale-spinner had
uttered the preliminaries for another attack the gong went and we
trooped out to dinner.</p>

<p>Imagine the joy of the party when later on we discovered that
the man on whom so much eloquence had been expended was stone
deaf!</p>

</p>

<p>That Fisheries Commission provided many a humorous episode. One
was directly to my address. We were in the early morning train for
Swan Hill. Kyneton was the breakfast station. The train was full of
racing men bound for a meeting up the line. I warned my
parliamentarians that the crush would be great for breakfast and I
led the way directly we pulled in at the platform. I was the first
at the counter. I collected my order, picked up a knife and fork
and put them on the plate with my sausages, took the lot in one
hand and my cup of coffee in the other and began to back out
through the now dense crowd. At the last moment I thought of bread,
put my coffee down, grabbed a couple of slices and then, fully
loaded, managed to get clear and reach one of the small tables.
There I arranged my dishes...but what was this in my hand? It was
the florin with which I had meant to pay the waitress! But, as if
that were not bad enough, when I came to attack my meal I found the
'two slices of bread' were another man's ham sandwich! Apparently
my Aberdonian ancestry had triumphed over my natural
diffidence!...It was hard to persuade my Commissioners, when I told
the story, that I eventually paid the girl. I did...but the ham
sandwich was quite another matter!</p>

<p>Another Royal Commission of which I became secretary was
interesting largely because it introduced me to one of the most
outstanding men I have ever met&mdash;Sir John Monash. Again I did
not want the job, but a public servant must obey his Premier and I
found myself installed, with a dry humorist named Rollo Hesketh as
assistant, in an office in the State Electricity Commission's
building. Monash impressed me profoundly. His wide reading, his
diversity of interests, his astonishing knowledge would in
themselves have constituted him a leader, but greater than these
were the quickness and thoroughness of his grasp of affairs, new
affairs, as they were presented to him, and the promptitude and
certainty of his judgment. It did not take me long to realize why
it was that this civilian rose to such a distinguished position in
the army. By the way, he told me one day how he came to write his
book, <i>The Australian Victories in 1918.</i> He had been invited
to publish something on the Great War and, in preparation for the
job, he had all his papers assembled and arranged while
demobilization was proceeding in 1919. A start at the actual work
was made at seven o'clock one evening and he finished it by writing
from 7 p.m. to midnight each night for thirty consecutive nights.
'I hardly re-wrote a line,' he added. He was paid £2,000 for the
completed volume.</p>

<p>I have a copy of the second edition before me at the moment. It
is inscribed to my son: 'To Robin Croll, confidently believing that
the lads of his generation will be ever ready to emulate the deeds
of patriotism recorded in this book. From the author, John Monash,
Lieutenant-General, 30/1/25.'</p>

<p>This Royal Commission was appointed to investigate the causes of
that amazing happening known as 'the police strike,' a happening
which shook Victoria, and particularly Melbourne, to its very
foundations. Thanks to it, most people realized for the first time
how securely they normally live&mdash;in other words, they
appreciated the meaning of the words law and order.' A number of
police, at a customary parade, refused to obey commands and were
instantly dismissed&mdash;within twenty-four hours the lawless
element which is part of every city began to loot the unprotected
shops, traffic control was lost, and only the loyalty of a small
section of the constabulary, acting in conjunction with a
quickly-formed corps of civilians, who were sworn in as 'specials,'
prevented worse doings.</p>

<p>Who were to blame for the 'strike'? There are two sides to most
questions, and this particular conundrum had many answers&mdash;of
a kind. It is idle to debate the matter now; after listening to all
the evidence of interested parties and hearing much of the
undertones, I concluded that the men had genuine grievances which
called loudly for redress (some have since been redressed), and
that they were in a state of exasperation which made it easy for
certain of their number, rebelliously inclined, to use them for the
mischief-makers' own ends. Many fine men, ornaments to the force,
found themselves involved in a sudden movement with which they had
little sympathy, but from which they could not withdraw. They were
caught 'on the hop.'</p>

<p>A short-lived Labor administration was in office when the
Commission was appointed; a National ministry was in power when our
Report was prepared&mdash;so that Report still remains in the
pigeon-holes! It cost more than a trifle to produce, for three
highly-paid State officers in Sir John Monash, Mr. C. S. McPherson
(Public Service Commissioner), and Police Superintendent J. H.
Martin, to say nothing of a barrister at ten guineas a day and a
Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, officials of the Police
Department, the Government shorthand writers and others, were all
deflected from their ordinary duties. Truly a case of the mountain
and the mouse. The inquiry occupied the last five months of
1924.</p>

<p>The barrister who sat behind the Commissioners was Mr. A. W.
(now Judge) Foster, a man of individuality and charm. His quick wit
was delightful; to him and to the Crown Solicitor, Mr. F. G.
Menzies, I usually gave my versified comments on the proceedings.
Those proceedings were remarkable in at least one regard.
Practically all the witnesses were police or ex-police, all were
thoroughly trained in the art of giving evidence in
court&mdash;never were two opposing sets of evidence so perfect in
their utterance or so completely and wholly contradictory!</p>

<p>As Secretary, it was my job to write the Report. With many
hundreds of pages of these conflicting statements to weigh and, if
possible, reconcile, it was to be no easy task. My relief was great
when Sir John said that he would like to draft and submit an
outline of what he considered should be said. I undertook, and
produced, one section; the rest came from Sir John's pen, and came
from it, too, in a single night. It was a feat that could be
appreciated by those only who had seen that mass of evidence.
Moreover, it passed, almost as it stood, the keen survey of that
very able administrator, C. S. McPherson, and his colleague, J. H.
Martin, and eventually was adopted. Its fate you know.</p>

<p>The visit of the Prince of Wales (afterwards King Edward) to
Victoria in June, 1920, caused another break in my routine. The
organizer of the arrangements (Mr. Sam Whitehead), working double
tides, fell ill owing to the strain, and the Premier of the day,
the Hon. H. S. W. Lawson (now Sir Harry), sent me along to ease the
pressure. Here was a new world. At a first impression it was
peopled mainly by snobs and persons trying to gain favours&mdash;an
early experience was an offer of £10 for an invitation to one of
the functions. Whitehead soon had my complete sympathy. Half
Victoria appeared to be clamouring for something, and all
addressing their requests and complaints to him. Nothing was
apparently too trivial to bring under the notice of the
Prince&mdash;one woman wrote that she would show him a white magpie
if he would call at her house!&mdash;and no device was too mean to
practise in the scramble for cards to meet our illustrious
visitor.</p>

<p>It was not the general public who gave all the trouble; much of
it was caused by people in high places, who demanded that
constituents or relatives should have preferential
treatment&mdash;and when they found us unmoved they carried the
tale to the Premier and worried him. Dignity we found to be a frail
flower which needs careful handling: a well-known Federal
politician 'raised Cain' when he learnt that his seat one evening
was in the second row, behind that of one of the State members! I
don't know what awful consequences might have followed if the
matter had not been found capable of adjustment.</p>

<p>I have never met a more likeable man than the Prince, or a more
thoughtful. By the way, of the many stories about him at the time,
one is well worth retelling. It may be apocryphal, but it rings
true. The scene was supposed to be Brisbane, the place a dance room
to which he had been invited by a group of girls from a big
warehouse. He chose a partner. They danced. She was tongue-tied by
shyness. At last she spoke: 'When you are at home, your Royal
Highness, what do you do in the evenings?' 'Oh,' said the Prince,
'in the evenings? Well, you see, after dinner father gets the paper
and mother takes her knitting, and when I see father begin to nod I
nip out!'</p>

<p>My first big job during the visit was to attend the magnificent
display given by the school children at the Melbourne Cricket
Ground. I was to see that the Prince kept to the schedule laid
down. He duly arrived and was shown up to the box reserved in the
members' pavilion. At a signal he was to come down and pass on to
the arena where the thousands of children stood in their lines to
give him a welcome. I loitered downstairs waiting for the appointed
hour and prepared to have the police make a lane for him through
the crowd.</p>

<p>But he jumped up ahead of time, and the first thing I knew he
was at the foot of the stairs and making for the arena gate. No
policeman was handy at the moment, so I fell in alongside and
together we pushed our way through the crowd, which opened out as
it recognized him. We reached the gate&mdash;'Open up!' I called to
the sergeant standing within. He saluted, threw the gate
wide&mdash;and disclosed a thick rope breast-high across the
entrance. Then it was that I made my first speech to Royalty.
Without preliminary, I turned to our future King and said 'Duck!'
He duly ducked under the rope, and all was well.</p>

<p>Later that day I had private audience with him. His references
to the display showed how much he had appreciated it.</p>

<p>Frank Tate, the first Director of Education, was head of the
Department at the time. Successive governments, ruled by the
selfish precedent that no State Public Servant had ever been
permitted to accept a title, failed to recognize adequately the
wonderful work of this able educationist. He was not only
outstanding in Australia but he took a foremost place at Imperial
gatherings. The I.S.O. and the C.M.G. awarded to him were small
rewards for his outstanding services to the State. He should
certainly have been knighted, if for nothing but the magnificent
War Relief Fund (half a million in cash and half a million parcels
of food and clothing) produced, under his guidance, by the State
Schools during the Great War. Theatrical people and others were
handed the honour for much less.</p>

<p>Tate had a wonderful memory. I introduced him to C. J. Dennis
and to the <i>Sentimental Bloke,</i> and he became greatly
interested in that clean and clever larrikin-classic. Later he told
me that had every copy of the <i>Sentimental Bloke</i> and its
sequel, <i>Ginger Mick,</i> been destroyed, he could have restored
them word for word. His memory of the Shakespeare plays was
phenomenal; often a lecture would be as much quotation as
connecting matter. Most astonishing of all, he could repeat whole
pages of prose, particularly the fine English of Lowell.</p>

<p>He had an elvish, a Puckish, humour which was more than a trifle
disconcerting at times. The late Dr. John Leach, known the world
over for his popular book on the birds of Australia, was an
Inspector in the Education Department and a long-standing friend of
Tate. Leach was humourless and it amused Tate to play on this and
Leach's acknowledged partiality for science and its exactitudes. A
purely imaginary conversation between Leach and an old schoolfellow
is a good example of Tate's whimsicality. 'Married?' inquires
Leach, as the two friends shake hands after years of separation.
'Yes,' replies the other, 'I've been married quite a long time.'
'Any larvae?' queries the scientist.</p>

<p>A true tale is that of the Nightjar. As everyone knows, the
Nightjar is a curious nocturnal bird. The devil entered into me one
day and I said: 'Leach, a friend of mine has found a bird which is
not listed in your <i>Bird Book.'</i> That was enough to rouse the
author. He looked at me scoffingly, but a trifle uneasily, too.
'And what's that?' he asked. 'It's the White-handled Night Jar,' I
answered, and prepared to leave. 'That shows all <i>he</i> knows
about birds,' was Leach's retort. 'It's the White <i>Throated</i>
Nightjar.' At this I shouted with laughter and Leach, good fellow
as he was at heart, hated me for almost a day.</p>

<p>We had another humourless person on the staff at that time. It
seems to me that the possession of humour keeps <i>a</i> man from
making himself ridiculous. We were discussing surnames and our
friend remarked, with much seriousness: 'My name is derived from an
old English word meaning "Polecat!"' I suppose a man can't be
blamed for the habits of his ancestors, but I don't think I would
have advertised their weaknesses if I had been in his place.</p>

<p>In quite another category was our Art Inspector, Carew-Smyth.
Tate was noted for his skill in introducing appropriate stories
when making a speech; Carew-Smyth knew all those stories 'and then
some.' Tall, lean, dignified, serious-faced, he suggested an
ascetic churchman. But that sober countenance would be transformed
as the point of one of his numberless tales was reached&mdash;it
became irresistibly jovial. The man who could remain unmoved when
Carew-Smyth set himself to entertain would be a wonder. I scored
off him once. He came from London and had been trained as an
artist. His knowledge of gardening was thought to be negligible. So
when it was reported that he had joined the Horticultural Society
and had started cultivating some garden plots, I wrote these verses
which, by the way, the Director read to the assembled
horticulturists at their next meeting:</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%">ART AND NATURE</p>

<p class="poem">Oh, the Art Inspector smiled a smile,<br>
And his smile was good to see,<br>
As he turned up the earth in artistic style<br>
To fashion a bed that would seem worth while<br>
To the bean and the good green pea.<br>
<br>
He niggled it here, and he cross-hatched there,<br>
And he rubbed out a line too much,<br>
Till the whole thing glowed like a picture, fair<br>
As a painter's dream, that he felt should wear<br>
A frame as a final touch.<br>
<br>
Then he added a wash of pure Yan Yean<br>
And he picked out the choicest seeds;<br>
Each nude nude bean was a pure French bean,<br>
Each pea a poem, as round and clean<br>
As my Lord High Abbot's beads.<br>
<br>
In the cunningest curves, on High Art lines,<br>
He buried the food to be;<br>
'There's nothing like starting with sound designs,<br>
Art's everything, Nature she quite outshines,&mdash;<br>
I'll be picking them soon,' said he.<br>
<br>
But alas for the Art that would govern Life,<br>
Old Nature had planted, too,<br>
And Hurryup Weed and his hungry wife<br>
With 'umpteen kids each keen as a knife<br>
Came thronging and thrusting through.<br>
<br>
They stippled the ground with their leaflets bright<br>
In patterns all twirl and twist,<br>
They broke each canon he knew was right,<br>
They wedded the lean Preraphaelite<br>
To the Cubist and Futurist.<br>
<br>
And the Art Inspector bent his back,<br>
(With a word that I may not tell)<br>
And oh, but his brow with wrath was black<br>
As he grabbed each weed by the scruff and the slack<br>
And consigned it straight to...well!<br>
<br>
'When at last the tucker took heart and grew,<br>
Its planter's cup was full;<br>
The Spider red made his hopes look blue,<br>
His beautiful curves were all askew,<br>
The slug and the snail got busy, too,<br>
And he hadn't a pod to pull!<br>
<br>
ENVOI&mdash;<i>To P. M. C.-S.</i><br>
<br>
There are one or two morals quite plain to read,<br>
O Artist so lank and lean:&mdash;<br>
<i>'No peas for the wicked' is truth indeed,<br>
And if with the other you did succeed<br>
You'd be classed as an old has-bean!</i></p>

<p>It was Carew-Smyth who dressed as Cardinal Richelieu for an
artists' fête in aid of Red Cross funds. He looked the part to the
life. The only anachronism was the motorcar in which he sat as the
procession wound its way through the city. There was a halt for a
few minutes in Collins Street. It brought the Cardinal's car to a
standstill just in front of a group of his fellow officers of the
Education Department. He regarded us impassively, not deigning to
know at that high moment such base canaille. I determined to break
his poker mask. Squeezing through the crowd, I stood before the
window and held up two fingers in blessing&mdash;'Benedictine,
father!' I called. The response was comical. For a few moments the
Cardinal had the upper hand, then the natural man prevailed, and
the procession moved onwards with its great church dignitary
doubled up in a most wholehearted fit of laughter.</p>

<p>Carew-Smyth was one of the kindest of men. He hated, as
examiner, to fail anybody. The tale goes that he was visited in his
office one Saturday by a woman teacher, a particularly garrulous
sample, whose drawing had not been passed as satisfactory. She had
a portfolio of her works with her, and Carew, sighing, but with his
customary courtesy, went through the lot one by one. To each he
said, 'Ye-es, ye-es!' and finally managed to bow her out. Then he
communed aloud&mdash;'No, they're no good, I can't pass her...no, I
can't pass work like that...' a reflective pause, then, springing
up: 'Oh, my goodness, I'll <i>have</i> to pass her: <i>she might
come back!'</i></p>

<p>I hate to spoil a good story, but the finish of that one smacks
rather of office invention.</p>

<p>The Department yielded many a light episode. No one could invent
anything as funny as some of the genuine documents handed to me at
times by the Attendance Officers. An anxious mother excused
Willie's absence from school&mdash;'he has been under the
Children's Hospital for three weeks.' Another had kept the eldest
girl home and was sorry&mdash;'I have had twins. It will not occur
again.' A teacher, trying to squeeze into one line the cause of a
child's absence and the duration of it, summarized thus: 'Kicked by
a horse from the 8th to the 14th.' But it remained for my friend
Webster, working at top speed during a bad influenza epidemic, to
achieve a telegram of such import that it has become a Departmental
legend. A wire had come in to the effect that the whole staff of
one big school was absent with the exception of the head teacher (a
man) and the sewing mistress. 'Carry on with the sewing mistress!'
ordered Webster.</p>

<p>My Public Service career lasted from 18th September, 1886, to
the 5th January, 1934. I retired as Senior Clerk of the Education
Department and Registrar of the Council of Public Education. The
latter post I had held for over thirteen years, having succeeded my
friend, Martin Bottoms, on 9th November, 1920. That Council, a
statutory body, was one of Frank Tate's thoughtful creations.
Unfortunately, it was given no executive power. It is a body
representing many interests&mdash;the Education Department, the
University, the registered schools, agricultural education, the
Trades Hall, and music. While it may originate any inquiries
relating to education, its main function is to consider matters
referred to it by the Minister of Public Instruction and furnish
reports and recommendations about them. In my experience much
valuable time was spent by some of the wisest of our citizens in
endeavours as members of this Council to assist the
administration&mdash;services utterly wasted, for the Minister
almost invariably either took no notice of them, or refused any
request they embraced.</p>

<p>Still, the Council persevered and it is, I suppose, continuing
to act as a fifth wheel to the coach. I have never ceased to admire
the devotion of most of the members. They gave useful service to
the State, and that not only without reward but customarily without
recognition. Some of the Council's debates were a liberal education
in how to be warm without being heated, and how to oppose without
being personal. I conceived a strong feeling of friendship for
several of these able men and women, and I do not need the books
they gave me when I retired (Baldwin Spencer's <i>The Arunta</i>
and J. M. Barrie's <i>Complete Plays),</i> much as I value and
appreciate them, to keep the Council of Public Education in
grateful remembrance.</p>

<p>To my colleagues of the Department I addressed a farewell word
at the request of Gilbert Wallace, then editor, for publication in
the <i>Education Gazette:</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:20%">SWAN SONG</p>

<p class="poem">Now ends my long official day;<br>
The work is done, the book is signed.<br>
May Fortune grant me on my way<br>
Friends staunch as those I leave behind.</p>

<p>I wonder if it would smack too much of egotism to print one of
the letters which came to me when my retirement was announced. I
quote this partly because of its unexpectedness, for I had no
association with Canberra, and it came from the Federal capital.
But the writer, Senator Sir Harry Lawson, had known me during his
occupancy of several Ministerial posts (including that of Premier)
in Victoria. I esteem very highly his unsolicited testimonial:</p>

<p class="letter">Commonwealth of Australia,<br>
The Senate,<br>
10/12/1933.<br>
Dear Mr. Croll,<br>
<br>
May I as a citizen thank you for your service to the State and
express my appreciation of your fine work at the Education
Department? My best wishes for long life, good health and happiness
in retirement.<br>
<br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
H. S. W. LAWSON.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. ART AND LETTERS</h2>

<p>The Public Library had increased my love of letters; it created
in me a taste for art&mdash;I mean pictorial art&mdash;even as
association with my fellow-librarian, Emil Creed, had wakened a
feeling for music. In neither pictorial art nor in music had I any
power of expression, but one could appreciate and even learn a good
deal, I found, without being an executant. Spare half-hours I spent
in the National Gallery and gradually came to know something not
only of our Australian artists and their work, but of the world of
art outside.</p>

<p>So I was not altogether a Philistine when I joined the Victorian
Artists' Society in 1908 and later was elected a lay member of the
Council. There I met men of outstanding merit, such as Charles Web
Gilbert (the finest native-born sculptor Australia has known),
Douglas Richardson (whose Memorial Exhibition I had the honour to
open in 1933), John Mather, John Ford Paterson, Alex. McClintock,
Walter Withers, Alex. Colquhoun, John Shirlow, Walter Montgomery,
Fred McCubbin&mdash;but the list is too long to detail.</p>

<p>That Council was the joy of my existence. I wish I could tell
the full story. Surely never was there a body like it. One night
McCubbin, kindest of men, proposed a motion. It was duly seconded.
Then Mather rose, waxed eloquent in opposition, and moved an
amendment that in any other Society would have been ruled out as a
direct negative. The chairman accepted it, however, and McCubbin,
stirred by Mather's oratory, actually seconded the
amendment&mdash;an amendment to his own motion!</p>

<p>We used to go round to the life class after the meetings, and
the artists would give advice to the students practising there. One
night the model, sitting in the 'altogether,' had a well-shaped
body but a particularly plain face. John Ford Paterson, pausing at
the back of a student and critically regarding first the sitter and
then the drawing, fired off, in his rich Doric, this remarkable
double-barrel: 'No, no! It'll no do! Too dahmed much like the
model!'</p>

<p>I sat next to Paterson at a supper given by Montague Brown.
'More coffee, Mr. Paterson,' said our host. 'No, thank ye,'
returned Johnnie, reaching for the whiskey bottle, 'Ah can get
coffee at hame!' Of a certain member of that Council it was said
that he could hold an amazing amount of whiskey without showing it.
So he must have been carrying a proper load, when, accosted in the
street by a friend, he swayed as he stood. 'Come and have a drink,'
invited the friend. The artist swayed again, then&mdash;'No, thank
you; I've had one!' said he.</p>

<p>The artists' circle in every country impinges, of course, upon
that place of strange beings and doings known as Bohemia. The
sea-coast of Bohemia may be as pleasant to the view as
Hebblethwaite averred, but I am inclined to think that it is a
better country for a short visit than as a spot to settle in.</p>

<p>So far as Melbourne was concerned, Bohemia (not the magazine
earlier mentioned, but the land of Murger and his like&mdash;our
nearest approach to the Quartier Latin) centred in Fasoli's in
Lonsdale Street, with the willow tree in the back yard. When the
cafe moved to King Street, all its following went with
it&mdash;artists, poets, journalists, musicians, parliamentarians,
professional men and the rest. Many have written of both the old
and the new Fasoli's: none, I think, has done justice to the memory
of Mrs. Maggia, under whose firm and beneficent rule it prospered
for such a number of years. She was a woman who had to play a
tactful and often difficult part, and well she did it. She earned
respect and liking; at her death I felt the loss of a personal
friend.</p>

<p>My old friend and schoolfellow, Jack Shirlow, the etcher, later
to become Art Master of Scotch College and a Trustee of the
National Gallery, was the first to take me to Fasoli's. Here I
found a whole new world of sensations. I was delighted. The salads
(particularly the potato salad) and the 'shark' (as any fish was
named, from sardines upward), or the salami (believed by all to be
of horseflesh) which prefaced the more important dishes; the
spaghetti with its grated cheese; the general flavour of oil and
garlic; the <i>vin ordinaire</i> (it was proper to refer to this,
no matter how excellent it might be, as the etching bath), the
novel cheeses (here I first met Gruyere and Gorgonzola), and, above
all, the flow and sparkle of talk in many languages&mdash;these
were indeed a change from the monotony of the normal. Even the fact
that you must not part from your knife and fork throughout the meal
had a charm&mdash;the charm of novelty.</p>

<p>A famous night (30th July, 1907) at the King Street place
celebrated the coming out in a new form of a little literary
monthly&mdash;<i>The Native Companion.</i> E. J. Brady had taken
over the editorship. I was told that everybody would have to 'do
something,' so I wrote some verse which afterwards appeared, in
part, in <i>The Bulletin,</i> and as a whole in my book,
<i>By-products.</i> But I need not have bothered, there were enough
of the well-known of the writing, artistic, musical and dramatic
worlds to have provided programmes for several nights without
calling on anyone else. What a crowd there was! We had scarcely
room to ply our knives and forks, and as the wine went down the
voices went up, until all West Melbourne must have known there was
'something doing' at Fasoli's. There was to be a flashlight photo.
We put most of the womenfolk on a row of chairs on the table, some
of us sat on the table itself, another row was on seats on the
floor, the rest squeezed in where they could. Everybody did the
arranging. When quiet was obtained&mdash;foof! went the flashlight,
and the Babel broke out again. But a yell from the photographer
silenced us for a moment&mdash;he had forgotten to uncover the
lens! A second attempt gave, on development, an excellent picture
of a London fog, for the room was full of the smoke of the first
explosion.</p>

<p>I have heard notable opera singers and even more notable
violinists and pianists perform after dinner in Fasoli's rooms;
many times has Walter Kirby sung ballads there (no one has sung
certain well-known ballads better than Walter Kirby) to his own
accompaniment. I have heard in the one evening a Member of the
Federal Parliament, a scissor-grinder, and a consul, endeavour to
please the little audience. And we would sit there till the
midnight train in those older days, talking 'about it and about,'
settling the affairs of the world, deciding what the National
Gallery should buy, quarrelling or agreeing about the merits of
this book or that poem or the latest show of pictures&mdash;would
that I had half the wisdom now that Youth is so sure of!</p>

<p>A gay adventure had been the publication of a journal 'issued
now and then, at the Pension Suisse, Lonsdale Street, Melbourne,'
what time Signor Camusso upheld the Fasoli flag. I have the whole
issue: Vol. I, No. 1, for no 'then' succeeded the 'now'.
Consequently (to quote a schoolboy friend), copies are as scarce as
hens' teeth. I doubt if either our Melbourne Public Library, or
even the Mitchell Library, has one. So, Collectors of Australiana,
keep a look-out for a small quarto of eight pages entitled <i>The
Waddy, with which is incorporated The Salami.</i> The cover design
is by Ruby Lindsay (who married Will Dyson, so linking two famous
families of artists) and there is a full-page drawing by her
husband of Dave Wright, 'the man of memory,' the most regular of
diners at Fasoli's. Louis Esson has a prefatory poem on the
Pension&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Wine flows; rare songs are sung;<br>
Here hearts and pockets both are light,<br>
But all the world is young,</p>

<p>and I suspect the unsigned verses, <i>The Willow-Tree,</i> are
likewise his. Particularly bright and very truly personal are the
personal notes. One brother of the band, Hal Cohen, had left for
Germany; 'We congratulate Kaiser Wilhelm,' says the chronicler and
adds: 'Hal's place was difficult to empty.'</p>

<p>Perhaps the most delightful thing in <i>The Waddy</i> is its
motto. Parodying <i>The Herald's</i> then slogan, 'Impartial, not
Neutral', it declared itself 'Neutral, but Biassed'!</p>

<p>William Moore, actor, playwright, historian of the arts, and
most bohemian of journalists (alas! also gone beyond the voices),
had evidently a hand in the issue. He was then on <i>The Herald</i>
and returning some very interesting copy&mdash;that is, when he
remembered to return any at all. An erstwhile editor told me that
once William found his notes in his pocket next morning when they
should have appeared the night before. How he used to relish the
curiosities of life! The lady who, with venom, described in his
presence another woman as a 'puss-cat,' contributed greatly to his
pleasure, and I shall not forget his enjoyment when he went to
report the Dinghy Club and found the members listening to a paper
on Dreadnoughts.</p>

<p>Many of our writers now try the dramatic form of presenting
their ideas, and several societies, here and in other capitals,
offer them encouragement every now and then by staging their plays.
The Repertory Theatre has also, at long intervals, put on a local
tragedy (such as Louis Esson's 'Dead Timber') or comedy (as, for
instance, Blamire Young's 'The Children's Bread'). But William
Moore was very early in the field with his Australian Drama
Nights&mdash;local plays, local music, recitals of local
verse&mdash;several successful nights were held. At the Turn Verein
hall I took charge of the front of the house while Moore filled the
posts of producer and stage manager, playwright and actor. There
was little profit in these affairs, for, just before the last item,
we had a half-hour interval in which we served, free, coffee and
cigarettes. I have not heard of any professional theatre following
suit! A flat rate of three shillings was made for admission, and
there were no reserved seats&mdash;first come, best served. Yes, on
second thoughts, there was one reserve. We were very anxious to
please Tom Carrington, the <i>Argus</i> critic (one-time cartoonist
of Melbourne <i>Punch),</i> and we held a seat for him (without
advertising it) and ushered him in with ceremony. We got the good
notice&mdash;but then, perhaps the show deserved it! A line on the
tickets caught the public fancy&mdash;'Citizens in evening dress
not admitted.' We aimed at a modified Bohemia, and the evenings
certainly were very friendly, happy-go-lucky, democratic affairs.
In the popular phrase: everybody was there, and the long interval,
and the refreshments, made for good fellowship.</p>

</p>

<p>Those Drama Nights brought out plays by Louis Esson ('The Sacred
Place' and 'The Lion Tamer'), Kathleen Watson, William Moore
himself, and several others. When Moore was leaving for the old
country in 1912, there was a fine rally to wish him Godspeed. At
the dinner we gave him, Dr. Springthorpe took the chair, and
amongst the speakers were Frank Tate (Director of Education),
Blamire Young, Louis Esson, Bernard O'Dowd, Desbrowe Annear and Dr.
T. P. McInerney. <i>Faute de mieux</i> I found myself proposing the
important toast of Literature and the Arts. Genial Herr Hattenbach,
leaning lovingly over his 'cello, made music for us, and Doug. Hart
and Tom Skewes put on the best of their comic numbers. After his
return, William married the well-known New Zealand poet, Dora
Wilcox, and lived in Sydney.</p>

<p>Most of the inhabitants of Bohemia, as we knew it, were merely
visitors, tourists, so to speak, 'highly respectable gondoliers'
who looked in occasionally as a relief from what Gordon has called
the dreary round to which we're bound&mdash;the same thing over and
over again&mdash;of their ordinary lives. The regular inhabitants
were few, even as they are to-day; an acquaintance with vermouth
and spaghetti, or even the composition of Minestrone, does not
necessarily qualify for citizenship.</p>

<p>Two burghers of our own Bohemia by naturalization, if not by
birth, were my friends Frank Williamson and Hugh McCrae. Both were
big men, over six feet, and well-proportioned to that height. Each
carried himself like the proverbial lord and each, as Henley wrote
of Stevenson, could be said to be</p>

<p class="poem">Valiant in velvet, light in ragged luck</p>

<p>for each had the cheerful spirit that refused to be long cast
down. It has been said of Frank that, with a shilling in his pocket
and the whole town before him, Romance lurked behind every corner
and smiled at him from every passer-by. Poems came then which he
sometimes wrote down, but more often did not. Generally his work as
a State school teacher carried him to the back-blocks so, city-born
as he was, the pavements were sweet to his feet in the vacations.
He began writing verse at a later age than with most people, and
his whole output is no more than would make one slight book. Most
of it is between the covers of his only volume, <i>Purple and
Gold</i> (so-named from the colours of Wesley College, where he was
once a master).</p>

<p>Well do I remember the birth of that volume. It was printed in
England for a Melbourne publisher. That meant that the author did
not see the proofs. A remarkable result followed, for thus was
produced what has been called the only piece of true Celtic
mysticism written by an Australian. You will find it as a sixth
verse to his poem 'Dirge.'</p>

<p>The first verse runs&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Strew the flowers at Love's behest<br>
Meet for such a lovely guest,<br>
Coronal the sapling weaves,<br>
Rainbows wrought by Spring of leaves,<br>
Blackwood blossom, hither bring<br>
To perfume her slumbering.</p>

<p>Archibald Strong had seen the verses in manuscript and took
exception to the phrase 'Rainbows wrought by Spring of leaves' as a
bit heavy. When Williamson sent me the complete MSS. to hand to the
publisher, I found six lines written in at the foot of the
Dirge&mdash;he wanted one selected to take the place of the line
Strong objected to. I passed the trouble on, the publisher also
passed it on, and the printer in England set up the whole
half-dozen as a new verse. It reads:</p>

<p class="poem">Rainbows made by Spring of leaves,<br>
Rainbows touched by Spring to leaves,<br>
Woven irises of leaves,<br>
Made by Spring of rainbow leaves,<br>
Consecrated rainbow leaves,<br>
Vernal iridescent leaves.</p>

<p>Did I say 'Celtic mysticism'? The more modern 'Surrealism' might
be a better description.</p>

<p>By the way, I was with Williamson when he was handed the first
copy of his <i>Purple and Gold.</i> It is an attractively produced
book and he was charmed, till unhappily he lighted on the new verse
of the Dirge. The row that ensued was epic. There was a line of
small rooms partitioned off along the corridor&mdash;from each came
the scared heads of typistes and clerks who listened, fascinated,
while a really capable performer did justice to his opinion of
printers and publishers, their relatives and friends, their
ancestors and descendants. It was a noble effort.</p>

<p>Frank was a golden talker in his best days. He had read widely
and he had also read well, which is so much better than widely.
When he quoted, there was nothing trite about the saying, and it
was ever to the point. His Muse of written expression died young:
poetry dwells with him to-day but will not let him write her
thoughts. (Alas! he has died since I wrote that!)</p>

<p>Of big, boyish Hugh McCrae one can speak only in love. He is the
Peter Pan of Australian letters and assuredly, despite his size, he
will never grow up. I met him first at McNally's studio at the top
of Oxford Chambers in Bourke Street. I quoted something. 'My God!
Theocritus!' cried Hugh and took me by the shoulders in his two
strong hands and rocked me to and fro.</p>

<p>They used to tell in Sydney that Hugh was wakened one night in a
taxi-cab and asked by the driver where he lived. They had reached
the suburb all right&mdash;'What street do you want?' demanded the
man. 'What streets have you got?' inquired the sleepy poet. But
these are trivia; the real Hugh is in the immortal 'Satyrs and
Sunlight' and was revealed on the stage of the Scots Church Hall in
Melbourne that night when he spoke to an absorbed gathering on the
subject of his father and the famous circle of friends of which
that father was one. To hear the intimate talk of Gordon and
Kendall and Marcus Clarke and Dr. Caffyn and Charles Conder and
Orion Horne was to live for a time in an age fast becoming
legendary. And, best of all, it was brother Hugh (I cannot think of
him otherwise) who had you by the hand as you walked through that
enchanted land.</p>

<p>It was Hugh who said, when Le Gay Brereton died: 'The first
thing Brereton will do over there will be to ask God to forgive the
Devil.' This contrasts well, by the way, with Stevenson's remark
when Matthew Arnold passed out: 'Poor Matthew; he'll never get on
with God!'</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from quoting some personal rhymes addressed to
me a few years ago by Hugh, shortly after I had published a book of
verses. They indicate the kindness of his heart and the charity of
his judgment:</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%">To R. H. C.</p>

<p class="poem">Three slogans in my willing ear<br>

<p>Here are a couple of stories (in Hugh's own words) told me in
Petty's lounge when I was in Sydney in June, 1937. He had been
Editor of the <i>New Triad</i> when Ernest Watt owned it:</p>

<p>During <i>The New Triad</i> period, E. and I (or, 'im an' me)
used to swallow preprandial cocktails at 12.45 p.m., and then walk
across to the cold-table to ask 'How the cheese is, to-day?' This
was part of our machinery, and it happened right through the week.
Ernest always paid for EVERYTHING; and the story went that he never
allowed&mdash;if he could help it&mdash;any man to buy <i>him</i> a
drink. So, with a desire to be different from other chaps, I
conspired with Ernest himself that I, for once, should do this
solitary deed.</p>

<p>The bar we frequented was presided over by an eminently
respectable woman, bowed by years, but always addressed with the
prefix 'Miss.' On this occasion, having ordered the routine
'sherries and bitterses,' I put down the cash&mdash;a pound note.
Miss Asterisk, at the middle of a long conversation, still talking,
backed away to the till...then, with her eyes fixed upon Ernest's
own remarkably beautiful ones, paid Him <i>the change!</i></p>

<p>Ernest, from force of habit, pocketed the money, and
benevolently hooking his arm through mine, walked into Castlereagh
Street.</p>

<p>For me, it was a damned expensive drink; but it wasn't only
sherry that warmed my inside the rest of the afternoon. I loved him
so much he could <i>almost</i> have done the impossible&mdash;taken
a hundred, or a hundred thousand, pounds from me without a
squeak.</p>

<p>Here's the companion story&mdash;</p>

<p>When I first returned from America, Tom McMahon, the
<i>Bulletin</i> accountant invited me to drink. Previously, I had
been telling him how like a child I was with regard to money, not
being able to compute even English currency.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Tom, 'if you can't count English money, how did you
manage with American, during your twelve months in New York?'</p>

<p>I replied 'You can generally trust people. Now, for instance,
here's change of a pound coming to me. It goes into my pocked,
unexamined, and you may be sure it's all right.'</p>

<p>'Humph,' said Tom, 'I shouldn't like to run the risk...That's
not <i>your</i> change of a pound! That's <i>mine!'</i></p>

<p>On that visit to Sydney I parted from Hugh one afternoon in Pitt
Street. Norman Lindsay was with us. I shall not forget that
farewell in a hurry. Hugh is a big man, broad of chest and sturdy
of arm; Norman is slight and so am I. Grasping Norman with his left
hand and me with his right he leaped into the air with us dangling
like puppets as we went up with him, while his jolly voice shouted
'Goodbye! Good-bye! Good-bye!' At each leap we rose like a pair of
marionettes. Then, with his huge laugh, Hugh was off, and I watched
him moving like a giant through the evening crowd.</p>

<p>My impression of Norman Lindsay at that time, as at all times,
was one of extraordinary vitality and great charm.</p>

<p>Mention of M. J. McNally, artist, writer, raconteur, recalls
many a jolly evening spent in his rooms near the roof of Oxford
Chambers. Only once did I know those rooms to be locked, and that
was because he had a prize pup there which he was looking after for
its owner. The pup had a pedigree as long as a wet week-end; it
also had a most catholic taste, for one day it ate Mac's pyjamas!
Much has been said about McNally by his friends and other
detractors. I knew him as the most hospitable of men, generous to a
fault, and many a young artist has had cause to thank him for
advice, practical direction and the immediate solace of a few
pounds. Irish of descent, heir to a Celtic imagination, his natural
heritage was the ability to tell a tale well and he would not spoil
it by merely adhering to the bald facts. He was as much an artist
in this as he was in his painting. His warm temperament and
generous outlook coloured everything he told or possessed. It was a
perpetual joy to hear that he had a new story. Realizing how much
more intimate and interesting is the first-hand narrative, he
invariably told it as happening to himself or in his presence, and
his great gifts as a raconteur carried it over and made it
believable, if only for the moment.</p>

<p>One day I looked in. McNally was out on the balcony, with its
really wonderful view to the east, south and north. Far away, the
Dandenongs swam in a soft haze; beyond them, palely blue, showed
the outlines of the ranges at Healesville. It was a charming
outlook, but for once Mac had no eyes for it. He was laughing
heartily. 'Just had a great lark,' he said. 'See those buildings
down there'&mdash;he pointed to a tall row of offices in Queen
Street&mdash;'when I came out I could see a typiste busy in one of
those rooms. She was hitting off a letter close to the window. Then
I noticed a chap in the next room, I suppose her boss, for he got
up and presently came in to her office. As she looked up at him he
stooped and kissed her. I scooted inside and got my field glasses
and read the name on his window, grabbed the book and found his
telephone number. I suppose he was still with the girl when the
bell rang, for I had to wait a minute or so before he answered. "Is
that Mr. So-and-So?" I asked. "Yes," said he, "this is Mr.
So-and-So speaking." "Oh," said I, "I just rang up to ask why you
were kissing the typiste," and with that I hung up the receiver,
grabbed the glasses and raced out to see what happened...They
pulled down the blind.'</p>

<p>I wanted a meeting-place for a small society&mdash;'Use my
studio,' said Mac, and use it we did. The first night we found on
the table a sketch-portrait of his face ('by the hand that feeds
it,' he had put below) and a characteristic note inviting us to
help ourselves, 'and you'll find the whisky in the corner.' Another
night, at a loose end, I blew in from Fasoli's to find Mac having a
birthday party. With cheers and acclaim I was dragged into it to
the refrain of 'Another Little Drink Wouldn't Do Us Any Harm.' Had
all the world and his wife turned up they would have been welcomed.
As a final gesture of friendship that night Mac decided to 'sell a
horse.' Lest anyone reading should not know, let me explain that
commonly you 'sell a horse' by putting in a shilling apiece, one
member writes a number down privately, then all count as in a
kiddies' game. The person who calls the hidden number scoops the
pool and buys the drinks. In this case we put in no money and at
the discovery of the chosen number Mac presented the fortunate one
with a watercolour. Three times did he do this&mdash;and those
water colours were selling at from ten to fifteen guineas apiece! I
have mine before me as I write; I was one of the lucky.</p>

<p>When I recall McNally I think of that saying of Marcus Aurelius:
'As the vine bears grapes, so it is natural for some to give.'</p>

<p>We would stay down at Fasoli's in King Street swapping yarns and
setting the universe in order till the dinner was comfortably
down&mdash;Quinn of Sanderson's, and Dave Wright, the man of
memory, always in the same corner; and E. J. Brady, both when
bearded and when bare; and that sincere artist Web Gilbert, who
died of overwork in the very flower of his genius; and Mrs. Peters,
ever serene and charming; and Lucy Thomas, the slightly-cynical
onlooker at the game; and the kind little doctor of West Melbourne,
Doctor Maloney (now M.H.R.); and generous Garry Roberts from the
Tramway Company; and witty Alick McClintock, who could tell with
irresistible gravity of the train-loads of holes he had seen going
to the spaghetti factories in Italy; and Jimmy MacDonald, now
Director of the Melbourne Art Gallery; and the Dysons, both Edward
the writer (occasionally) and Will the cartoonist (frequently); and
that charming woman, Ruby Lindsay, doomed to die long before her
time; and Colonel Reay of the <i>Herald;</i> and Bill Moore,
thawing more and more as the night went on; and Frank Williamson,
at his best as a talker; and 'Den,' whose <i>Sentimental Bloke</i>
had yet to be born; and McNally, rubicund and jolly and full of
good tales; and Bogue Luffman with his yarns of Spain and many
another far-off land; and Johnnie Ford Paterson, on occasion
singing a pleasant song; and capable Louis Esson, whose best work
we always felt was yet to be; and brilliant Jack Sommers, able with
both brush and pen; and Percy Lindsay, ever looking younger than he
was; and a certain Public Service Commissioner&mdash;I discovered
him with mixed feelings, being young and a member of that
service&mdash;and Jack Shirlow, rapidly acquiring fame as an
etcher; and lovable Ernest O'Farrell, (Bob' to us), afterwards so
well-known as 'Kodak' of the <i>Bulletin;</i> and his sisters,
Nance and Mrs. Palmer-Archer ('Bushwoman' of the
<i>Australasian</i>); and Alf. Fischer, who gravely led us into St.
James' Old Cathedral one evening, and shut us in a pew before
endeavouring to take up a collection; and big burly Grant Hervey
(not so often); and well-liked Fred McCubbin, with sometimes his
handsome wife, (who may be recognized in that triptych 'The
Pioneers' in our National Gallery); and Leslie Wilkie, Director
(dead, worse luck, since I wrote that) of the Adelaide Gallery (his
portrait of the youthful Guido Maggia hung on the cafe wall for
years); and at odd times that greatest of our thoughtful poets, my
friend Bernard O'Dowd; the 'hero of the piece' Gerald Massey; Doug.
Hart, with his inimitable City Court recital (By cripes, it's time
old Panton was retired'); Tom Skewes, covering a world of waggish
humour under a solemn exterior (who of us can forget his love-lorn
Esquimaux!); cheerful Dolf Leiberman, whose chief delights seemed
to be hard work and Sunday fishing; and Hal Waugh, later to go to
Toolangi and lure 'Den' to follow him (there Waugh established the
Hall of Hal and Dennis the Den of Den); and puckish Hal Gye, most
spontaneous of humorists; and the sober-faced, observant Dave Low,
half-Scotch and half-Irish in descent (he declared that the Scotch
half had a terrible time keeping the other in order)&mdash;by the
way, he is now probably the most highly-paid cartoonist in the
world; and keen-witted Betty Baker, later prominent on the
Repertory stage; and that doughty athlete, J. E. Davidson, then, I
think, on the <i>Argus,</i> but better known in after days as
editor of the <i>Herald,</i> his idea of relaxation from newspaper
work being a bout with Bill Squires or Tommy Burns; and Guy Innes,
well-read, quick at repartee, who was to succeed Davidson in the
<i>Herald</i> chair&mdash;but these are only a few of the fixed and
shifting population of the Bohemia which was Fasoli's.</p>

<p>How many, alas! how very many! of these have died. 'The
milestones turn to headstones as we approach the end, and under
every one there lies some once-familiar friend.' Some were no more
than the stimulating or agreeable acquaintance, but many left gaps
which remain unfilled. Of these Jack Shirlow was one of the hardest
to replace. This is portion of what I wrote of him in the
<i>Argus</i> of June 27, 1936 (he died on the 22nd). Commencing
with a quotation from 'The Bush' by Bernard O'Dowd&mdash;'Strong
Shirlow's hand shall trace Mantegna's line,' I told of our early
association:</p>

<p class="newspaper">I was walking with John Shirlow one fine
spring afternoon along what was then a bush road from Frankston to
Mornington. I had known him for some years and had never suspected
that he was other than a product of the city. So when boyhood
memories were stirred in me by the sight of some ripe cranberries I
proceeded to tell my companion what they were. 'These,' I said,
'are cranberries. They are quite eatable,' and I stooped and
picked, with due regard to the prickles, a small handful of the
little green and gold fruit. 'So they are,' he retorted, took the
handful, tossed it into his mouth, and added, 'The last time I had
a feed of these was in the Stawell cemetery.'<br>
<br>
That statement held two surprises. I let the cranberry reference
pass, but Stawell...it was the first time I had heard him mention
that town. 'I was born in Stawell,' I said. 'Were you?' said he.
'Well, I went to school there!'<br>
<br>
So we learnt, after some twenty years of acquaintance in Melbourne,
where we had been introduced as strangers, that we had been in the
same classes of the same school for a year or two as boys, and had
then completely forgotten each other.<br>
<br>
Shirlow wrote many articles for newspapers and magazines, he
painted in oils, drew in water-colour, and carved in wood; but the
achievements which will survive are his etchings. The medium is
difficult, and its many processes demand not only great artistic
ability, but also constant care. In the beginning, as is customary
in such cases, his work was not appreciated, but he lived to see 20
guineas paid for a copy of a volume he issued in 1904 at a single
guinea. It is known as the <i>Five Etchings.</i> The issues of
several of his plates have long been exhausted, with the
consequence that 10 guineas has been offered for a proof of 'The
River' (1902), while the 'Gothic Spire' (1915) and 'The Central
Station' (1910) have also markedly risen in value. A small octavo
printed in Sydney in 1917 reproduced twenty-five of his etchings;
8,000 copies of this book were sold. In 1917 and 1920 respectively
he brought out two folios of six plates apiece&mdash;the <i>Sydney
Set</i> and the <i>Melbourne Set,</i> both now out of print.</p>

<p>John gave me one very unpleasant task. At his death the
executors sent me the following letter which had been attached to
his will:</p>

<p class="letter">'Beulah,'<br>
16 Park Avenue,<br>
GLENHUNTLY, S.E.9.<br>
4th July, 1935.<br>
<br>
Dear Bob Croll,<br>
<br>
I am not feeling too well just now, but I want you to please
understand that I want you&mdash;quite apart from anything laid
down in my last will and testament, that you are to take charge of
all my copper plates remaining after my decease and while you are
to retain four (4) which you can consider your property&mdash;to do
with as you like&mdash;I want all the other plates, copper or Zinc,
<i>utterly destroyed</i> so that no one can get any further proofs
from them. Under no circumstances should any adventurer get hold of
them to his own profit. Signed by me<br>
<br>
JOHN SHIRLOW.</p>

<p>I could not refuse, so some hundreds of etched plates were
brought to my home and I took a file and defaced all the lovely
things save the four left to me. I have never had a more
distasteful job than this destruction of beauty, but I realized
that my old friend's artistic reputation must suffer if dealers
were to obtain the plates, so I did it. It must be remembered, in
judging this action, that the printing of etchings is almost as
great an art as the creation of the pictures. Whistler went so far
as to say that no etcher is worthy of the name who did not do his
own printing.</p>

<p>From the gathering at Fasoli's one night we took some Sydney
visitors to McNally's studio. As usual, it was open to the world,
though Mac was not at home. As we examined the Norman Lindsays on
the walls, and admired the very fine Cumbrae Stewart which hung
over the mantel, Percy Lindsay looked in. Down in the street again
Percy was still with us. Considering all things, there was humour
in the fact that he had attached himself to the elderly lady of the
party, a staid woman of sixty to whom Fasoli's and an artist's
studio were an almost breathless adventure. It was now capped to
her by the thought that actually she was with one of those famous
Lindsays! Percy was voluble, and she kept him going in her
extremely dignified way. We wandered as far as Princes
Bridge&mdash;'What is that bright light, Mr. Lindsay?' asked the
old dear. Percy identified it as a beacon on the tower of the
Federal Coffee Palace. 'Oh, and look,' she went on, 'there's
another&mdash;what place is that on?' and she pointed down the
river. Percy looked&mdash;'That?' said he genially&mdash;Why,
that's a <i>star,</i> you silly sausage!'</p>

<p>To the old lady's credit, she is laughing yet!</p>

<p>Victor Daley I never met, strangely enough. But I felt I knew
him because of my close contact with so many of his friends.
Innumerable were the yarns in which he figured and he was credited
with many a good saying. At a time when Australian poetry was
largely concerned with the stockrider and the jockey, Victor
remarked that our local lyre was strung with horse-hair. It was
about that period, by the way, that A. G. Stephens asked for a
four-line description of Australian literature, and I wrote for his
<i>Bookfellow:</i></p>

<p class="poem">Whalers, damper, swag and nose-bag, Johnny cakes
and billy tea,<br>
Murrumburrah, Meremendicoowoke, Youlgarbudgeree,<br>
Cattle-duffers, bold bushrangers, diggers, drovers, bush
race-courses,<br>
And on all the other pages horses, horses, horses, horses.</p>

<p>A story told to me recently of Victor Daley is worth repeating.
He fell very sick while living somewhere about Collingwood and
Brodzky went to see him. 'What's the matter, Victor?' said the
visitor. 'I think I'm going to die,' replied the poet. 'Oh, cheer
up,' returned Brodzky, 'you're not as bad as that. Anyway, we've
all got to die; don't get downhearted.' 'No, it isn't that,' said
Victor earnestly. 'I don't mind the dying, but I don't think I can
persuade that undertaker chap to bury me on time-payment!'</p>

<p>In the world of Art I came to know intimately that lovable
genius Blamire Young. Had he not chosen pictorial art as his means
of expression he would most assuredly have made a shining mark in
the profession of letters. As it was, he wrote a good deal, much of
it as contributions (still uncollected) to art criticism. He dipped
into drama with a little comedy 'The Children's Bread,' and he
could turn a neat verse, while his book interpreting Goya is
probably the most illuminating ever published on that extraordinary
Spaniard. I have before me an unpublished account of Blamire's
early life. He sent it to me to consider why the editor of the
<i>Argus</i> should have thought it unsuitable for publication. I
told him it seemed weak in the way it finished and suggested a
different ending. He was in poor health at the time and let the
matter stand.</p>

<p>This thoughtful and penetrating sketch reveals that he had been
destined by his people to enter the Church and to that end was sent
to Cambridge to take his degree. One of his comments is pungent:
'There is a world of difference between taking a degree and
receiving an education.' However, he managed both&mdash;and came
out an agnostic from the process. So there was no Church for him
and he emigrated to Australia as a school teacher who was later,
through friendship with Phil May, to turn artist. The struggle to
make a living was severe. I asked him once how certain notable
pictures of his came into the possession of a rather poorly-endowed
Gallery, and he told me the tale of their seizure for debt.</p>

<p>But those lean days passed and he lived to know prosperity and
enjoy the honours he deserved. Tall, straight-backed,
aristocratic-looking, his was an imposing figure in any company. He
acted as art critic for the Melbourne <i>Herald</i> for some years,
following the appointment of J. S. MacDonald to the Directorship of
the Sydney National Gallery. As Blamire could not, very well,
review his own work, the <i>Herald</i> asked me to act as critic
for his 1929 exhibition. I don't mind confessing that most of the
knowledge displayed in my article came 'direct from the horse's
mouth' for, before starting to write, I walked the artist round the
show and bade him discourse. The language is mine; the facts are
his.</p>

<p>The dinner which followed that show was worthy of it. By the
way, he sold, if my memory is sound, some £1,500 worth of pictures
that time. With Harper Bell I drove to Young's hilltop house near
Montrose one afternoon about six; we left again for home about
eleven next morning! We had put on dinner suits and, fortunately,
we took ordinary clothes along, too. Such a dinner! Blamire Young
was a connoisseur in wines: from the Chablis through the warmed
claret and the iced champagne to the rare old liqueur brandy the
meal flowed gently and happily. Hors d'oeuvres, a choice soup, a
special capon, a delicious sweet, coffee of the blackest, rare
glass and silver, a surround of lovely pictures, talk till the
small hours, a bedroom where your last memory and your first waking
view were of beautiful watercolours hanging on the walls, then a
burst of sunlight, thrushes singing, and our host with coffee and a
roll to preface the morning meal.</p>

<p>But Blamire died, and I came home from the funeral to write
this, more moved than I care to say. It appeared in the
<i>Argus:</i></p>

<p class="newspaper"><i>The dust of his funeral is in my
eyes...</i><br>
<br>
From his hilltop at Montrose the land fell away to green fields, as
usual; his gum trees patterned the slopes; beyond the valley, with
its hidden creek, rose the forested walls of the Dandenongs, upon
which his eyes, those calm, considering eyes, had rested so
regularly in pleasure; deliciously blue were the distant ridges of
Donna Buang...and he lay in his studio insensible to it all.<br>
<br>
How often had he welcomed us at this door, this blue door with the
bluer hydrangeas looking in, the door from which he now camel borne
by men in black who carried him down the narrow track below the
limes to where a hearse waited at the little wicket gate. The old
mare grazed contentedly, near by: she did not lift her head. But
the young colt, head and mane held high, full of friendly
curiosity, trotted forward to inspect this new intruder, and was no
whit dismayed when the motor tuned up.<br>
<br>
Good-bye, home on the hill! Good-bye, trees that he loved!
Good-bye, world in which he found so much beauty! The hearse moved
forward, the colt trotted alongside as if to see his master safely
away, and we followed. Lilydale Cemetery is on a hill. Our way lay
through the valley where wondering children, picnicking, stood in
silent groups to see us pass, through the main street of the
township, astir with afternoon traffic, and out again to the quiet
of the cleared countryside. Ahead was the gentle rise,
tree-planted, where Melba sleeps, and at the gates stood a group of
artists come to pay respect to their dead chief. Not only artists
in pigment, though: one of the mourners was a well-known figure in
the legal world, whose friendship with Australian painters goes
back to days when he was the boon companion of Blamire Young and
Phil May, and many other brilliant artists, and all were young;
another was the foremost poet in the Commonwealth; the common bond
of love for this dead man had brought together a diversity of
interests.<br>
<br>
'I am the Resurrection and the Life,' intoned the priest, and we
walked, holding the gilded tassels of the pall, to where the earth
was torn and a grave stood open. 'O death, where is thy sting?' We
looked upon a sunlit landscape, and the truant thought whispered,
'He is being buried in the heart of one of his own pictures.' 'O
grave, thy victory!' A thrush, Harmonica the musician, immortalized
in his picture 'Mansions of the Grey Thrush,' raised a mellow flute
note in triumph, and once again Memory closed the physical ear to
listen to voices of the past.<br>
<br>
How well he talked! His Cambridge degree, which was to fit him for
the Church, laid a foundation upon which he built greater
structures than his teachers ever intended or dreamt of. His
culture was both deep and wide; without display he held an abundant
knowledge of life in an amazing number of aspects. He was an
aristocrat in the best sense of that abused word, the aristocrat of
intellect. Experience of poverty and of riches, of the company of
peasants and of princes, had ripened in him a natural tolerance
which was expressed in the ease and grace of his manners. Had he
not been a pictorial artist he would certainly have made his mark
as a writer. No one could turn a neater phrase or a more lucid one;
he could create a clever piece of verse, as he did to accompany his
two woodcuts for the Library Association's meeting in 1902, or as
he had done in many a bantering exchange of limericks with myself;
he could and did use the dramatic form to excellent effect, as in
'The Children's Bread,' which he described as a 'tragedy or a
farce, according to how you look at it.'<br>
<br>
The poet at my side wakened me from my dreaming. In the silence
following the Benediction he clasped my hand and looked at the
grave. 'I am proud to belong to the generation which produced him,'
he said. Again I saw the man as we knew him. Tall, erect,
quiet-spoken, gentle in debate, hesitating to correct when he knew
so much better, generous to a fault&mdash;had he lived one hundred
years he would have died too soon. I walked with him again through
the bush and saw him stoop to discuss an orchid with a small boy; I
heard him discourse of the symbolism of Goya, the merits of his
favourite Australian poet, John Shaw Neilson, the scientific
growing of roses, and a wide variety of topics; and I watched him,
the perfect host, pour perfect wine into delicate glasses while he
discovered to his listeners his wonderful knowledge of
vintages.<br>
<br>
Anecdote treads upon the heels of anecdote. Some early pictures of
his had been mentioned. 'When was it you sold those?' I asked. He
smiled. 'I can hardly say I sold them, you know,' he remarked. 'You
see, the bailiffs took them for some money I owed. When they were
seized I asked the man what he was going to do with them. "Sell
them," said he. "Well, I wish you luck," said I; "I've been trying
to for a long time."'<br>
<br>
But those were the days of the beginning of things; he was to be
recognized eventually as, in Arthur Streeton's phrase, 'one of the
three foremost water-colourists of Australia.' As I looked once
more from the mellow landscape to the open grave I thought of the
Greek Heraclitus. Forgive the paraphrase:<br>
<br>
They told me, Heraclitus,<br>
They told me you were dead;<br>
They brought me bitter news to hear<br>
And bitter tears to shed.<br>
<br>
I wept, as I remembered<br>
How often you and I<br>
Had tired the sun with talking,<br>
And sent him down the sky.<br>
<br>
And now that you are lying,<br>
My dear old Carian guest;<br>
A handful of grey ashes,<br>
So silently at rest<br>
<br>
Still are thy pleasant pictures,<br>
Thy nightingales, awake;<br>
For death he taketh all away<br>
But those he cannot take.<br>
<br>
<i>The dust of his funeral in still in my eyes...</i></p>

</p>

<p>Poets in Australia remind one of W. S. Gilbert's 'Barataria,'
where&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Bishops in their shovel hats<br>
Were plentiful as tabby-cats&mdash;<br>
In point of fact too many!</p>

<p>My friend Percival Serle, in his <i>Bibliography of Australasian
Poetry and Verse,</i> has recorded some 2,700 volumes by 1,420
versifiers.</p>

<p>How is that for less than 150 years and a population of only six
millions! That was in 1925&mdash;and still they come! The chief
productions of Australia are wool, wheat and poets. We export the
first two, but only a very occasional sample of the
third&mdash;rather a pity when the supply is so plentiful!</p>

<p>So it is no boast to mention that one is acquainted with a poet.
I have been fortunate enough to know some of the best of our
tuneful choir, amongst them that gentlest of men and most excellent
lyrist, John Shaw Neilson. It was given to me to edit, in 1934, the
<i>Collected Edition</i> of his poems and to write an introduction.
That meant reading, and several times re-reading, the whole of his
output, critically and closely. Nothing is more 'debunking,' as a
rule, to an author; it only increased my admiration in this case.
The fact that he had had little schooling did not come into the
matter&mdash;all too commonly a writer is admired (or patronized)
because he has overcome some such handicap&mdash;the refinement of
expression and the beauty and delicacy of thought in Neilson's work
ranked it high by any standard.</p>

<p>Blamire Young admired it greatly; indeed, he used some of the
lines as titles for a number of attractive pictures, and he offered
to illustrate Neilson's next book. Neilson was working in a quarry
in New South Wales when Young first became acquainted with him. A
monthly journal in Melbourne asked several well-known citizens what
each would do if he were given a million pounds. This is what
Blamire Young wrote:</p>

<p class="newspaper">I should buy for Australia a large and airy
quarry containing lots of stone of the softest and pleasantest
quality that could be found. It may be thought that my object is to
provide material for building war memorials, but that is not the
case. My reason is this: I have noticed that Australia's leading
poet, one John Shaw Neilson, born near Mt. Gambier fifty-five years
ago (this was written in 1927) spends most of his time working in a
large and dangerous quarry containing iron ore of the hardest
consistency imaginable. His eyesight is seriously impaired, and his
hands are so knocked about that he can hardly hold a pen. I had
urged him to leave this kind of work alone, but he said that as he
cannot sell his poems, he must continue to act as quarryman, for
that is the only kind of labour he can get to do.<br>
<br>
Now, if Australia insists on having her quarries worked by her
poets, well and good. I and my million will not interfere. <i>But I
will see to it that the stone in the beastly quarry is soft and
that the hands of the poets are damaged as little as possible, in
case they might ever wish to write another ode.</i></p>

<p>Another piece of work which I enjoyed was one which occupied
most of the leisure time of some eighteen months. Percival Serle
was invited by W. Collins &amp; Sons to prepare an Anthology of
Verse, and he asked Frank Wilmot (himself a poet, best known,
perhaps, as 'Furnley Maurice') and myself to collaborate with him.
This we did and the book came out in 1927 with the title <i>An
Australasian Anthology.</i> We read, and in many cases re-read,
critically and carefully, well over a thousand poems by Australians
and New Zealanders.</p>

<p>It was (again to use that expressive Americanism) a sad
debunking process. Ever since boyhood I had read everything
Australian I could lay hands on, and naturally I came to this new
task with a mind made up about all the better-known of our writers.
The deliberate weighing of the work, to ascertain how much of it
could stand alongside the best produced in Australasia, gave
results that, in the beginning, I could not have believed possible.
Demi-god after demi-god fell down from his pedestal and often we
had desperate work to pick up even a few pieces worthy of the
company into which we wished to place them.</p>

<p>It may be laid down as an axiom that anyone can make a better
anthology than has yet been produced. Everyone believes so, anyway.
Always some personal favourite, probably never critically regarded,
has been omitted&mdash;and that omission condemns the whole. We
were attacked by critics who had not undergone a purging similar to
that which we had endured, and I had, and have, some sympathy for
their point of view, seeing that it would have been mine in like
case. That there were only three fragments of Adam Lindsay Gordon
in our book was a particular offence to a considerable public. That
resentment left me, personally, quite unmoved. Gordon's reputation
rests mainly on his racy verse and not on any large body of
high-class poetry. I feel that the sporting side of his life and
the tragedy of his death have been responsible for the general
knowledge of him almost as much as anything he wrote.</p>

<p>Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson were in different case. They
were the authentic voice of my young Australia and I had never
reasoned about their right of inclusion in a collection of
Australia's best, or ever thought of questioning it. It was a shock
to find how much of their verse fell to the level of the merely
emotional and the brightly topical. Popular verse, full of humour,
manliness and vigour&mdash;yes! but true poetry&mdash;well, hardly
at all. There are a few omissions from that anthology, mainly
caused by publishers' restrictions. But, looking at it now,
dispassionately, as one can after years, I still consider it the
best production of its kind. We aimed at the highest, which means,
of course, the inclusion of a good deal of what would never be
popular, and I think the mistakes are few.</p>

<p>An excellent anthology, bright, happy and really acceptable by
all classes of readers, awaits the patience and industry of someone
who will delve into old files of the <i>Bulletin,</i> the <i>Lone
Hand, Smith's Weekly, Aussie,</i> the <i>Cycling News</i> (yes, I
mean that!) the <i>Outpost, Bohemia,</i> the <i>Queenslander</i>
(remember Brunton Stephens), <i>Birth, Verse,</i> the
<i>Australasian, Table Talk Annual,</i> the <i>Weekly Times
Annual,</i> the <i>Bookfellow, Steele Rudd's Magazine, Norman
Lillie's Magazine</i> and the dozens of other journals, some
living, some dead, which have been started in Australia. He should
seek the humorous and racy contributions which have not been
republished&mdash;not the slap-stick stuff, but the deftly handled
verse of good quality. There is a mine of wealth to be prospected.
The title of the resultant volume could be <i>Australia's Racy
Verse.</i></p>

<p>Another book which should be produced in the interest of gaiety
is a collection of Norman Lindsay's drawings of dogs, cats, fowls,
koalas (particularly koalas) and other animals which he did for the
<i>Bulletin</i> and the <i>Lone Hand.</i> Its welcome is assured. I
know of no artist who has infused so much humour and life into
animal studies. On a couple of occasions I have suggested this book
to Norman, but I suppose the job would be a difficult one. He would
be doing a genuine service to a lugubrious and all-too-serious
world if he would get it out. Art is as definitely served by this
side of his work, it is as true an expression of his great genius
as are any of his finely decorative pictures of gods and godesses.
Lindsay is a great creative artist; his fertile brain has invented
for us worlds of wonder in which move not only creatures of flesh
and blood, but dwarfs and heroes, satyrs and nymphs, and 'more
devils than vast Hell can hold.' When we were writing 'Epitaphs
Before their Time' I suggested this for Norman Lindsay:</p>

<p class="poem">Here lies our Norman Lindsay who<br>
Invented Worlds entirely new.<br>
The dear God, with a sense of fun,<br>
Has sent him now to live in one.</p>

<p>Those Lindsays would be a remarkable family in any country: as
the product of a little country village in Victoria they are
miraculous. They seemed to issue from Creswick like bees swarming
from a hive. How many there are I don't know: I have met no more
than Percy (painter), Lionel (etcher, wood-engraver, painter,
writer), Norman (all-round genius), Ruby (artist, married to Will
Dyson and now, alas, dead), and Daryl (artist). All possessed the
charm that makes friends easily, indeed an artist friend said to me
of Norman, when a young man: 'He's irresistible: if you learnt that
he needed your last half-crown you'd give it to him!' I prize a
deft caricature of himself he drew on a receipt issued for the
price of two drawings I bought from him&mdash;in those days when
the prices of his good pen-and-ink work were not prohibitive.</p>

<p>Norman never looked sturdy, though in reality a tireless worker;
Lionel always suggested robust vigour. He was a voluble, but ever
interesting, talker. For a while he held the job of art critic for
the Melbourne <i>Herald.</i> His critiques formed an interesting
study. Forceful at times to the point of offence, they presented
occasionally a sort of strangled look&mdash;as though he had tried,
not quite successfully, to square his own views with those of
someone else. That impression may be wrong, but it was easy to gain
when reading his notices of one or two of the more advanced
'modernists.'</p>

<p>The Dysons, linked with the Lindsays by marriage, were also
outstanding. Edward made his mark as a writer of both prose and
verse&mdash;he was one of the <i>Bulletin's</i> most regular
contributors&mdash;while Will gained international fame as a
cartoonist. Epigrammatic, concise, mordant and often bitter, his
work, in subject and in its accompanying text, disclosed a powerful
logical mind and a fine gift of expression. That he, too, could
have shone in literature is proved by the volume <i>Poems in Memory
of a Wife</i> which he published shortly after Ruby Lindsay's
death. The verse is marked by dignity and restraint.</p>

<p>It was of Will Dyson, by the way, that his brother Edward
uttered a truly brotherly criticism. Will was induced (these were
early days) to give a lecture on Art to the Australian Literature
Society. He gave it in Furlong's rooms in the Royal Arcade, Bourke
Street, Melbourne. Obviously nervous, he kept moving during the
whole time of its delivery, now with his weight on one foot, then
on the other. When he had finished and returned to the audience I
was privileged to hear Edward's greeting: 'Well, Bill, you can't
lecture for nuts, but you'd make a damn good step-dancer!'</p>

<p>Someone may be interested to look up that lecture. It was
published in Randolph Bedford's brilliant, but short-lived, weekly,
<i>The Clarion.</i></p>

<p>In 1917 John Shirlow dedicated a little book 'To my friends, Mr.
and Mrs. R. H. Croll.' It was titled <i>Etchings,</i> and contained
reproductions of twenty-four of his best-known works. Included was
the portrait he did of me. Three years later Alexander McCubbin,
then in business as a publisher, issued a more important volume
entitled <i>The Etched Work of John Shirlow.</i> To it I
contributed the text, a biography of Shirlow. The book is a
handsome one, a quarto, the broad page of which gives the
illustrations proper display. The ordinary edition was limited to
500 copies, the edition de luxe to 100 numbered copies, each of
which contained a signed etching.</p>

<p>That was my first actual book. In 1928 I gathered together a
number of articles, most of which had appeared in the Melbourne
<i>Herald</i> and <i>Argus,</i> and Robertson and Mullens put them
out in a small octavo which I called <i>The Open Road in Victoria,
Being the Ways of Many Walkers</i> (the sub-title an acknowledged
parody of E. J. Brady's 'Ways of Many Waters'). I was genuinely
astonished at the success of the book. Within three weeks the
presses were busy again, printing a second edition.</p>

<p>My next volume (1930) was another collection of newspaper
articles. I called it <i>Along the Track.</i> Mullens sent it to
England to be printed and thereby managed to produce a most amusing
misprint. I did not have a chance to correct proofs&mdash;a mistake
authors should always avoid. Where I had described 'a lazy swell'
in the ocean the printer made me picture 'a lady swell.' Another
effort by a printer to add to the gaiety of the nation succeeded in
turning Louis Esson's 'Sundowner's Song' into 'Landowner's Song.'
Could there have been a more thorough reversal of idea! That, too,
was the result of having the type set up overseas, so denying the
author a sight of the book until it was actually in circulation.
The misnamed song may be seen in his volume of verses <i>Bells and
Bees.</i></p>

<p>Counselled by my good friends Percival Serle and Frank Wilmot
('Furnley Maurice') I brought together and published a selection of
the verse I had written from time to time. My two critics discarded
a mass of stuff of only topical interest; the remainder appears in
the volume <i>By-Products,</i> which I issued in a limited edition
of 300 copies in 1932. Wilmot printed and Serle published, so 'the
old firm' which produced the <i>Australasian Anthology</i> came
into action once more. This volume does credit to its printer and
binder.</p>

<p>The bound edition of <i>By-products (100</i> copies) numbered
and signed, was sold out within a couple of days; the 200 in paper
covers also sold well, so expenses were covered and a small profit
was made.</p>

<p>My fifth venture was a commission from Mrs. Tom Roberts to write
the life of her husband, who had been one of the most notable of
Australian artists. When he died in 1931 his widow decided that she
would erect a monument which would do his memory greater honour
than anything that could be placed in a graveyard. So she spent the
money on this book. Tom sleeps in the quiet little churchyard of
Illawarra, Tasmania; the book, his memorial, is in every great
library of Australia and New Zealand, and in national libraries of
England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Belgium, Germany, Holland,
Sweden, Norway, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Czecho-Slovakia, India,
China, Japan, Egypt, South Africa, the Argentine, Brazil, Canada,
the United States, Hawaii, and in the municipal library of his
birthplace&mdash;Dorchester (England). A monument indeed! The book
is known as <i>Tom Roberts, Father of Australian Landscape
Painting.</i> It has a number of reproductions of his paintings,
some in colour.</p>

<p>Tom was a vigorous, able man, a born leader, whose influence
upon pictorial Art here, at a critical period, was incalculably
great. His enormous canvas, 'The Opening of the Federal Parliament'
was presented to the King and now hangs in St. James' Palace. He
painted some hundreds of portraits in this, including those of King
George and Queen Mary, and he had many a good tale to tell of
'those present.'</p>

<p>When he went to England to finish the picture he was given, by
Royal favour, a room in the Imperial Institute as a studio. One day
the Queen was due for a sitting and to his horror he found the
Institute locked up. He had forgotten it was a holiday Greatly
disturbed he ran round to the nearest police station to see if
anyone knew where the keys were kept. A fine old shindy was going
on there. The police had brought in a lunatic and it was taking the
whole staff to hold him down. When at last the row was over and the
man removed, Tom, more agitated than ever by this delay, rushed up
to the officer in charge. 'Tell me where I can get the keys of the
Imperial Institute,' he demanded. 'I've got to paint the Queen!'
The sergeant was still wiping his brow after the recent encounter.
'My God!' he exclaimed. 'Here's another one!'</p>

<p>That <i>Life of Tom Roberts</i> appeared in 1935. It, too, was
produced by Robertson and Mullens, whose manager, my good friend
Captain Harold Peters, displayed so active and helpful an interest
in it that the book may rightly be claimed, in its printing and
format, as one to be proud of.</p>

<p>In 1937 I collected the articles written by me on my Central
Australian travels, and submitted them, strung together by various
devices to give continuity to the narrative, to Angus and
Robertson, of Sydney. Their response was gratifying indeed. They
had published a number of books on the Inland, including Idriess'
<i>Lasseter's Last Ride;</i> Plowman's capital trinity&mdash;<i>The
Man from Oodnadatta, Camel Pads</i> and <i>The Boundary Rider;</i>
that fascinating volume by Finlayson called <i>The Red Centre;</i>
several romances by Hatfield; indeed, their output upon our great
hinterland was astonishing both in its number and its variety. So I
was more than pleased to find that my <i>Wide Horizons: Wanderings
in Central Australia</i> (as I named the proposed book) was
regarded by this experienced firm as an 'absorbing account' of my
excursions. 'The manuscript,' I was told, 'touches new ground, and
will appeal to the already great number of readers of Inland
books.' After extending the work, at the publishers' request, by
writing an additional 10,000 words, it was duly accepted and, at
this date of writing (August, 1937) I am waiting for the first
copies, having read the galleys and the page proofs, checked the
illustrations, admired a pull of the endpaper designed by John
Gardner (one of the two artists with whom I took my 1934 trip to
the Centre)&mdash;in short, having performed all those odd jobs
that are necessary between the writing of a book and its issue in
print.</p>

<p>Let me add, writing a month later, that the book is out. I have
to-day received the first copy (September 15, 1937). It is a fine
production, a credit to the publishers.</p>

<p>But there is another volume to add to the list. In fifteen days
I have written the life of Dr. Alexander Thomson, a pioneer of Port
Phillip and founder of Geelong. It was a rush job, done at the
urgent request of Dr. Roland Wettenhall for issue in connection
with the centenary of Geelong and of Presbyterianism in Victoria.
That book was completed (so far as the writing went) by Ocobtor
3.</p>

<p>Still later (now October 15)&mdash;word just to hand from Angus
and Robertson advises me that the first edition (1,500 copies) of
<i>Wide Horizons</i> has been sold out in four weeks and a second
printing is in hand. The retail price is 9/6.</p>

<p>Since writing the foregoing I have completed, by request, a
<i>Life of R. W. Sturgess,</i> who achieved so notable a success in
water colours during his short existence; and a brief history of
Australian art for the catalogue of a collection of paintings
presented to the Melbourne University by Dr. S. A. Ewing.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. THE QUICK AND THE
DEAD</h2>

<p>Horse-racing was never quite a sport to me; it was a spectacle.
As a gathering of humans brought together by a common interest I
have enjoyed the Melbourne Cup many times and have had a thrill
from each of the infrequent races which make up the day's
programme. The horses, dancing to the barrier and fully extended in
the actual contest, were an artistic delight. Being in Rome I did
as Rome did, but I never <i>needed</i> the additional fillip of a
bet to quicken my interest in a finish. I was, and am, a keen
believer in amateur sport&mdash;I mean sport for the health and the
fun of the thing&mdash;and the 'sport of kings' depends so much
upon cash that I must confess to a certain amount of impatience
with its followers when they describe it as 'the' sport.</p>

<p>A good friend of mine in the Public Service was an ardent
punter. One Monday morning I greeted him: 'How did you get on on
Saturday, Mac?' 'No good at all,' was the reply. 'Never struck a
winner!' 'Ah, well,' I consoled him, 'you had your afternoon's
sport, anyway.' 'Sport be &mdash;&mdash;!' he retorted, with
emphasis. 'Do you think I look at the races? When I get my money on
I go round to the back of the Hill and have a smoke till the race
is over!'</p>

<p>Contrast with that form of 'sport' the meetings which are held
every Saturday afternoon in the summer at the Olympic Park in
Melbourne. There you will find something like a thousand young
athletes competing against each other&mdash;for what? What I have
already said&mdash;health and the fun of the game. Not a single
individual prize of any kind is awarded&mdash;a pennant for the
winning club is the one recognition of success. But the fellows
gain the strength that clean exercise yields and, incidentally,
they make better citizens in adult life because of their training
in good sportsmanship.</p>

<p>It is a most excellent training in generosity and the Spartan
virtues. Better than preaching is an illustration. It was in a
cross country championship that two runners were having a ding-dong
go well ahead of the field. With only another mile to the finish
they dived together at one of the obstacles, a barbed-wire fence.
On the other side George found himself racing alone: looking back
he saw his rival hopelessly tangled in the wire. What did he
do&mdash;run on to a secure win? Not he: he turned back and
released his opponent, then went for his life, and fortunately won.
Was his action Quixotic? Maybe...but what an excellent neighbour
that chap would make!</p>

<p>I have called this chapter 'The Quick and the Dead' but 'the
dead' is mainly applicable to the racecourse. Very seldom, in my
long association as participant and official, have I seen anything
that suggested 'stiff running' at amateur sports gatherings. (By
the way, it is high time to create a word to replace 'amateur'; to
many people it suggests inferiority, whereas the world's best
performances are mainly in the names of amateurs.) But the
professional meeting provides plenty of examples of 'crook'
practices. The tales are legion. I recall a case where two men were
matched for a small stake and each had backed the other. The race
was a quarter-mile. After a start so slow as to suggest lumbago,
they gathered speed of a kind till one found himself unavoidably
leading, so he stumbled and fell. <i>The other stopped and helped
him up!</i> Such unusual consideration on the part of a
professional interested the stewards so much that they wiped out
both contestants (?) for life.</p>

<p>An amusing story came from England with my old friend Basil
Parkinson, the father of amateur running in Victoria. He said that
in a handicap race the official starter had backed the scratch man
to win. Pistol in hand he stationed himself close behind scratch
and, directly he had the runners set on their marks, he fired the
blank charge fairly into the thinly-clad posterior of the man his
money was on. That man, it is alleged, went off so fast that he
passed the field before the limit man had heard the report of the
pistol!...Yes, I know! But it's a good story, anyway.</p>

<p>Harking back for a moment&mdash;I remember my first Melbourne
Cup for reasons quite apart from the race itself. It was a blazing
hot day. We three Stawellites, Bill Webster, Gus Scoullar and
myself, all in our 'teens, walked out to Flemington (we walked
because we could not afford to ride&mdash;we had a salary of £60 a
year each and had to pay our board and keep ourselves; there was no
margin for luxuries) and we naturally patronized the Flat, for in
those days admittance to it was free. We had brought lunch and we
bought a bottle of lemonade to go with it. Sitting flat on the
ground at mid-day I was eating my sandwiches, the bottle lying
unopened between my knees. A sudden bang made us jump. The heat had
exploded our bottle by blowing off the end which pointed at me.
Before I could move, my trousers had absorbed most of our drink.
That was bad enough, but the stuff was sickly sweet and, when it
dried, the trousers stiffened till they were like boards wherever
the lemonade had landed.</p>

<p>The other two enjoyed that immensely, though they accused me of
having had more than my fair share of the beverage.</p>

<p>We saw the races, had a most interesting time studying the
crowd, and came home with my pair of unusual-looking trousers, and
a black eye which Gus had gathered for making remarks about a
gentleman who was exhibiting his skill with three cards on the
cover on an open umbrella. Quite an interesting day...I wonder
which horse won the Cup?</p>

<p>(Here's a coincidence, if you like! Gus Scoullar lives in
Hamilton and I have not seen him for over twelve months. As I wrote
that paragraph about his black eye of forty years ago the telephone
rang. I laid down my pen and went to the instrument. It was Gus who
spoke!</p>

<p>I am reminded by this of another effort of 'the long arm.' Going
in to town one morning with my brother, he showed me a little book
he had picked up. It related to the voyages of Robert Louis
Stevenson through the South Seas in the yacht <i>Equator.</i>
Amongst the illustrations was a photograph of the crew grouped
about their distinguished passenger and I remembered that Jim
Rossiter, a fellow officer of mine in the Education Department, had
been a member of that crew. My brother promised to lend me the book
next day and on reaching the office I told Rossiter of the find. He
was greatly pleased, for he had not previously known of the volume.
Nor had I, for that matter. But after lunch Jim came and said 'I
don't need the loan of your brother's book. I have seen a copy.
Here it is. It belongs to you.' 'Belongs to me!' I exclaimed.
'Yes,' he returned, and he told me this remarkable story. He had
gone in the lunch interval to consult his solicitor about a matter.
That solicitor happened to be James McConnell Kerr, another old
cobber of mine. When the business was concluded Kerr remarked:
'You're going back to the Education Office now, Mr. Rossiter, are
you not? I've had a book here for some months that I've been
keeping to give to Mr. Croll, for I know he is interested in Robert
Louis Stevenson&mdash;would you mind taking it up to him?'</p>

<p>It was that very book! a book in which Rossiter's own portrait
appeared and of which neither he nor I had ever heard until my
brother showed me his copy earlier that same day.)</p>

<p>But these are digressions, if there can be such a thing as a
digression in such a rambling narrative!</p>

<p>In amateur sport I was never a champion. I boxed a little, but
never sufficiently well to save myself from the smack that shifted
a rib one day&mdash;the lump is still fairly visible on my sternum;
I played single-stick, but could never be quite sure of guarding
that left ear; I worked long and steadily in a gymnasium, but for
display purposes I never got beyond the running evolutions and
leaping over the 'horse'; I ran with a harrier pack for years, but
would be given pretty well the limit in a distance handicap; I
trained earnestly for that hardest of all contests, the walking
race (yes; I mean it&mdash;it is one of the most trying of all
physical competitions) but a walker like A. O. Barrett could stand
me up at least a mile in ten miles&mdash;in other words, I was no
champion at any of these sports. But from each and all of them I
gained (no 'sour grapes' about this) what was better than any
rewards like cups or medals&mdash;I gained health and strength.</p>

<p>Incidentally, and best of all, I gained friends&mdash;sound
friends whose company has made life the pleasurable thing it has
mostly been. If I were permitted to dictate my own epitaph it would
go something like this:</p>

<p class="poem">Here rests the restless R.H.C.,<br>
Here his last journey ends&mdash;<br>
Happy with all his world was he,<br>
But happiest in his friends.</p>

<p>With a fellow clerk (Henry Amos) in the old Board of Advice room
of the Education Department (some day I must write a little more
about that room, my first in the Department, and its staff. Henry
Ouseley Blake Lane was then its head&mdash;a typical sample of the
class which, before Public Service examinations were devised, found
its positions in what was then always called the Civil Service.
Tall, aristocratic-looking, he had culture, and education of a kind
which did not include instruction in organization or management. As
a youth he had had some connection with the American Civil War and
one of our interests was his repeated attempts to secure a pension
from the United States Government. In the end he proved his case
and was awarded a small monthly gratuity. Francis, next in charge,
was a gentle, keen-minded man, interested in mechanics, the first
person to lure me out on a bicycle trip of any
length&mdash;Melbourne to Sorrento and back&mdash;one of the
earliest citizens to own a motor-car and an early victim to that
Juggernaut of our traffic, for his engine stalled on a railway
crossing and he was killed by a train. Bright-witted,
uncouth-mannered, half-blind Billy Webb; 'Dougal' McKay, who made a
fortune and left us&mdash;but no, there is not space enough to deal
with my room-mates in detail here.)</p>

<p>As I was saying&mdash;with Henry Amos I joined Trinity
Gymnasium, East Melbourne, where the Ingram Brothers (Jack and
Bill&mdash;twins) and the two Nunns (Frank and Crump) were the
honorary instructors, and eventually was elected to the committee.
It was a strong concern in those days. Out of our plenty we
equipped the place with new and up-to-date apparatus, built a
bathroom (an unusual adjunct to a Sunday School building) and
installed excellent showers. Canon Hindley was a sympathetic vicar
and so, I think, was his successor, Canon Berry, but there came a
day when the Church began to interfere with the make-up of the
classes and they, in the words of the old song, began to 'fade away
and grad-u-ally die.' The apparatus, still in good order, of that
defunct gymnasium is now in use in the Y.M.C.A., Brisbane.</p>

<p>Out of the gymnasium came what seems, after a life of over forty
years and 'still going strong,' a permanent institution&mdash;the
East Melbourne Harriers. Henry Amos and I had a paper-chase or two
with the Melbourne Harriers&mdash;why not a club of our own, he
asked me one day. So we called a meeting of the gymnasium fellows
and enrolled about forty. That first meeting had some comical
features. We secured an excellent chairman in Basil Parkinson and
had tried to provide against all contingencies by taking along,
amongst many other things, variously coloured sweaters and running
knickers&mdash;this in case of a division of opinion about club
costume. Division of opinion!...The evening was spent largely in
debating a suitable costume, and it ended in the selection of a
horrible maroon jersey, after rejecting about a dozen other more
attractive colours. Amos and I were disgusted. We had been
appointed secretary and treasurer respectively&mdash;as executive
officers we decided next day to take the law into our own hands,
the result being that the fellows found themselves in the present
neat and serviceable uniform of dark blue jersey with the white
letters E.M.H. on the chest, and black knickers. The proponents of
the claret-coloured creation apparently repented of their choice,
for we heard no complaints.</p>

<p>We linked up our new Club with the Victorian Amateur Athletic
Association and I became the E.M.H. representative on the Council
of that body. It was a struggling concern then, though now very
prosperous. Cross-country running was the chief interest of us all;
to-day the track meetings are the main feature. Entering
officialdom I found myself, in the next three decades, acting as
steward, judge, starter, timekeeper, referee&mdash;whichever post I
was required to fill. This led from local to inter-State
competitions and I went to Sydney, Brisbane, Auckland and Hobart as
manager of Victorian teams taking part in Australasian
championships.</p>

<p>For many years I assisted at that excellent gathering, the
Public Schools sports, in the capacity of judge. Then, for many
more years, I was referee at those meetings. One of my few&mdash;my
very few&mdash;unpleasant recollections of the sporting world is
associated with the Public Schools. A new secretary had succeeded
Harold Stewart (of Wesley) and some question had been raised of the
correctness of the tracks marked out on the Melbourne Cricket
Ground for the new man's first meeting. Those tracks were
re-measured after the meeting by R. W. E. Wilmot and certain
discrepancies were revealed. As the referee who had acted at the
sports, I was telephoned to and invited to come and see, on the
ground itself, what the checking had revealed. It was no fault of
the secretary that the thing had happened, and most men would have
been glad to have had a staff weakness pointed out as a future
safeguard, but this particular secretary chose to regard the
discovery as a personal affront. The result was that I, and another
innocent official who was present at the checking, were not invited
next year to fill our old posts. Moreover, speaking for myself, my
years of service were ignored with an ungraciousness that suggested
anything but good manners, let alone any evidence of that 'Public
School spirit' which the committee and its secretary no doubt
dinned into their pupils as a principle of decent living. In
Stewart's day we officials received a note of thanks after a
meeting...but now&mdash;'Manners, Ben!'</p>

</p>

<p>Some day a man like Basil Parkinson should write an anecdotal
history of the pedestrian sport in Victoria. To-day the growth of
the suburbs about Melbourne has changed the two big championships,
the five and ten miles, from cross-country events to contests on
racecourses. But I recall when we measured the most of the track on
the heathy country, full of singing larks, between Caulfield and
Oakleigh, and I remember the leader in a certain ten-mile vaulting
a fence and seeing below him, as he was in the air, a fine large
snake lying stretched out in the sun. He missed the creature: It
has always interested me to speculate what would have happened,
both to the runner and the race, if he had landed on that snake. He
was running in spiked shoes; the chances are that he would have
taken it with him for a while&mdash;but that's not the best way to
collect snakes! His legs were bare...yes, quite an interesting
speculation opens up!</p>

<p>If I were to catalogue the friends made in those years the list
would dominate the book. But I must mention the Serles, four in
number, whose acquaintance I first made at the gymnasium. In
particular I would specify Percival, for whom I have more than a
liking&mdash;to put it soberly. Well informed and able critic that
he is, I have been privileged to make many joyous excursions into
art and letters in his company. He it was, by the way, who, with
Basil Parkinson, did the pioneer work of founding the Amateur
Sports Club of Victoria, a club of which I was a foundation member.
That was not long after my first trip to Sydney (1897) where I went
with Walter Briggs and others to witness the Australasian Track
Championships. The Amateur Sports Club of New South Wales had
attracted our attention and we determined to create a similar
institution. I am no longer a member, but I know that this is now
one of the flourishing clubs of Melbourne.</p>

<p>On that excursion Wallie Briggs told me of the Melbourne Amateur
Walking and Touring Club, which had been in existence three years.
I joined, at his suggestion, and never did I do anything to yield
more profit in recreation and health. Looking back over the forty
years of my connection with this club (I am proud of the fact that
I have been an official the whole of the time) I see a vista of
forest and mountain and river and lake and sea coast that perhaps I
should never have known&mdash;certainly I should never have known
intimately&mdash;but for it. I shall return to the subject.</p>

<p>It was in my active period with the Council of the Athletic
Association that we formed an Amateur Boxing and Wrestling
Committee and proceeded to hold, first State, then Australian
championships. I could tell many tales of our adventures. Let one
be enough at the moment&mdash;a very personal one. One of the
time-keepers failed to arrive at a championship meeting. It was in
the Athenaeum, where moving pictures now exclude sport. I was given
a stop-watch and sat down at the ringside. All went well till a
particularly merry bout was staged. I became so interested that I
forgot all about my job; one of the boxers was down for some
seconds before I woke up. Then I was aware of my own voice. 'One!'
it called (it sounded horribly like 'Wahn'). Mechanically I had
begun to count and, just as mechanically, my finger had started the
seconds hand of my watch. Fortunately, the man was up again by
'five,' really about 'eight.' I kept wide awake and alert for the
rest of that night!</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. SOLVITUR AMBULANDO</h2>

<p class="poem"><i>The road calls to all that ever drank tea
out<br>
of an iron mug. And it knows they'll hear.<br>
&mdash;Dunsany.</i>
</p>

<p>It is said that an ancient philosopher, sitting in customary
debate with his pupils, was informed by one of them that, in his
belief, everything in the world was static. The old man responded
by rising to his feet and exclaiming, as he marched away,
<i>'Solvitur ambulando!'</i> In other words, he settled that matter
by walking.</p>

<p>Walking has been my doubt-settler, too. It has likewise been my
little liver pill of health, my fountain of bush knowledge, the
inspiration of two books and many articles, and, above all, the
begetter of some valued friendships. To walk is to have leisure and
opportunity to observe; moreover, one meets the back-country
dweller on more even terms than if, say, a car were used;
incidentally it is one of the most natural of all exercises and
perhaps the most easily regulated to suit age and condition.</p>

<p>I am not speaking of speed walking&mdash;that method of
progression which is so artificial that, in my competitive days, we
sought a new name for it, eventually calling it 'gaiting.' I refer
rather to the walking one does, preferably in company, to see new
things or ponder over old, the leisured pacing that conquers
distance, but not by haste. Mostly to me that has meant tramping in
the bush; often it has implied carrying Matilda, the swag. With
that hospitable lady on my shoulder, a nosebag (i.e., a tucker bag)
hanging in front, and a black billy in hand, I have walked some
3,000 miles in Victoria, sleeping hard, eating simple food,
enjoying a freedom difficult to know in cities. Of the innumerable
short excursions with a knapsack I have kept no record: they would
add up to another fair total.</p>

<p>For most of that I am in debt to the Melbourne Walking Club, of
which I am now a life member. It has always been a joyous body,
taking good and bad in the same philosophic spirit, enjoying any
luxuries which came along and not growling too much at 'perishes.'
Does it seem that exploring so small a place as Victoria can
provide no adventure? Well, I have been eight days tramping about
the mountains without seeing a human being outside of my own party;
I have called at a cattle station which no wheeled vehicle has ever
entered, for its only 'highways' are horse-pads which make sidings
along the steep slopes of mountains and cross rivers at girth-deep
fords, for bridges there are none; I have marched a stern thirty
miles, carrying a heavy swag, in a hunt for drinkable water, and
that with the shade temperature over 100° Fahrenheit&mdash;but to
multiply examples would be to give an undue impression of
hardship.</p>

<p>Pleasure predominated, or we should not have taken these
strenuous outings. For twenty-two consecutive years a small party
of the older members spent the Christmas holiday together in a
tramp through the back country. Our longest excursion was from the
Gippsland Lakes Entrance to Cape Everard lighthouse and from there
to the Thurra and the Mueller Rivers, then back along the coast to
our starting point. We must have looked the part of the genuine
swagman, for in the streets of Sale we were hailed by a farmer
seeking harvest hands, and offered a job.</p>

<p>We had imported sleeping-bags from Germany (this was long before
the War) and our first swagging trip was made with these. It was
from Beech Forest to Cape Otway, and along the coast to
Queenscliff. We were new to a walk of such length and we loaded
ourselves with food till I, personally, felt as if I must soon be
cut in half. Steadily we jettisoned the stuff: it may be possible,
even to-day, to follow that thirty-year-old march by the tins of
meat and plum pudding with which we punctuated our path. It was a
case of discard or stop. Perhaps that reckless abandonment explains
the appetites the trip bred in us until we actually ate a whole
crayfish apiece, and no small one at that, at lunch one day.</p>

<p>Chief of us in those high and far-off times was Phil. Flower,
for long secretary of the Club, and definitely the finest man who
ever joined it. His was a humour that could carry any tale he
told&mdash;and he told so many and told them so well that it is
common to-day for older members to preface a remark with 'As Phil
used to say.' Unselfish, generous, resourceful, well-read in
unusual branches of literature, he was an ideal mate for a long
tramp. 'The actions of the just, smell sweet and blossom in the
dust'&mdash;his memory does not die though he has gone from us
these many years.</p>

<p>Of Wallie Briggs, one of the earliest members and my introducer
to the Club, I can only say that we have been intimately associated
for so long that we can quarrel like brothers. Not that we do
quarrel, but I feel that we could without disturbing the
friendship. I recall one day on a long walk when relations were
strained. We camped in the same spot for a couple of nights, our
beds being hollows scooped from the slope of a sandhill. Mine was
just a few feet above Wallie's. The second day I saw him gathering
some fine soft grass from the flat. Presently he climbed the sandy
rise (I saw this from a distance) and lined my bed with the stuff.
I was touched, for we were still a bit huffy. Going across, I said:
'Thanks, Wal.' 'What for?' said he&mdash;I thought rather
aggressively. 'For lining my bed,' I replied. 'Lining <i>your</i>
bed!' he retorted. 'I lined my own!' But he hadn't, and we roared
with laughter as he regarded the result of his labours.</p>

<p>The Melbourne Walkers are now a strong club, interested in many
things beside walking. They have regular lectures on such subjects
as our native fauna and flora, ambulance work and compass reading;
they have a library and a stock of maps, some prepared or corrected
by themselves, of bush tracks; they have joined up with the Forest
League and the Bush Fire Brigade; several of the members are
honorary rangers under the Forests Commission and honorary
protectors under the Wild Flowers Act. Altogether the Club is doing
some good public service while enjoying its healthy exercise.</p>

<p>To-day the motor and the good road make possible at a week-end
many outings which a few years ago would fill a vacation. A
charabanc takes the party a hundred miles or so on a Saturday
afternoon and carries it back on the Monday, when that is a
holiday. A short walk on the Saturday, a full day's tramp on Sunday
and a return to the waiting bus on Monday, and the city men have
had a thorough and delightful change.</p>

<p>'To hike' has become a popular verb since the Boy Scouts adopted
it. 'Hike' is an ugly word of more than doubtful ancestry, but it
has definitely come into the language and, however grudging I was
at first, I must admit it has its use. Something was needed to
define succinctly the special kind of walking now embraced in
'hike,' so hike has come to stay.</p>

<p>The hiking craze which, a year or two ago, put so many damsels
into trousers and carried them in squealing hundreds into the bush
each week-end, evaporated after a few seasons, but it had one fair
result: it accustomed the public, in this motor age, to the idea of
walking for pleasure.</p>

<p>Earlier it was difficult to persuade the ordinary citizen,
especially in the country, that you could do such a thing for fun.
I recall our coming from Gippsland's hidden lake, Tarli Karng, and
running out of tucker. On a river flat we saw a homestead. Dropping
our swags at the gate we went in to buy some food. The squatter
himself welcomed us and, with the characteristic hospitality of our
back country, not only filled our tucker bags, but refused to
accept payment. 'Where are your horses?' he asked as he proceeded
to help us out with the spoil. 'We have no horses; we're walking,'
I replied. 'Walking!' he cried, as if he could not believe his
ears. 'Walking! What a bloody game!'</p>

<p>That summarises the country view. The city opinion was no
better. Just returned from a long tramp through East Gippsland, I
told John Shirlow some of its incidents. He repeated them at home
to his wife. She was very deaf. 'What did you say he had done?' she
asked, after a time. 'He said he walked 250 miles carrying a swag,'
John returned at the top of his voice. She meditated this. Then she
gave her decision: 'He's mad!' she remarked.</p>

<p>The Gippsland walk just mentioned was unusual in that we
attempted to trace the coastline back from Cape Everard (Captain
Cook's first Australian landfall) to Lakes Entrance. At the end of
nearly three weeks of carrying the swag, scrambling through scrub
and marching along miles of sand, we looked pretty disreputable.
Moreover, we had agreed not to shave. Little wonder, then, as we
neared the civilization of Lake Tyers and decided to dodge a wet
night by sleeping indoors&mdash;little wonder that the proprietor
of the highly respectable guest-house we tried closed the door in
our faces with the remark: 'We don't sell liquor here!'</p>

<p>Elsewhere I have told of my writings on this subject of walking
for recreation. So many people have mentioned that they have been
guided by those writings in bush excursions that I am tempted to
claim kinship with Job, of whom, you may recall, one of his friends
said: 'Your words have kept men upon their feet.'</p>

<p>That is not quoted in vanity: any vanity I ever had was pretty
well subdued after a few years' close intercourse with those
exceedingly frank friends, the older members of the Walking Club.
Those who composed the group which for so long spent each Christmas
vacation together in the back country, carrying the swag or leading
the packhorse, sharing perishes and tucker&mdash;those members in
particular had reached the stage when Truth, that lovely lady, was
never disguised but was introduced naked&mdash;fresh, so to speak,
from her well. We had arrived at that state of assured friendliness
in which insults to one another do not exist, so certain is each of
his standing with the rest.</p>

<p>Humour was the keynote of most of the trips; the man who
couldn't take a joke would have been in sorry case. Chief of the
cheerful group was always Phil Flower. He met my wife and me one
day at Mornington. After the greetings: 'I hear you are collecting
those published writings of yours to make into a book,' he
remarked. Then, with that attractive smile of his, he went on:
'I've got the whole of them cut out. That knocks your circulation
down fifty per cent.!' The neat implication that only two copies
would be sold was characteristic of his humour.</p>

<p>Yes; there was not much room for vanity in that company!</p>

<p>Bush tramping has, in many cases, given place to motoring, and
it in turn has proved enjoyable. If that has done nothing else, it
has at least enlarged the horizons. But it is not as good in any
other way. Speed is the life, the very essence, of a motor; it
seeks to arrive and neglects most other things. The man on foot,
though he, too, may desire to arrive, has leisure to observe, and
he does not deserve to walk if he is not noting the details of what
he is passing through. When Rory (in Lord Dunsany's story) marries
and leaves the vagabond life, his friend, Ship-in-the-Bottle, tells
him: 'You'll never see dawn any more, and you'll often miss sunset;
and it's seldom you'll see the light that does be in the air after
the sun is gone: it's as though the holy saints were leaning out of
Heaven then, and blessing the fields, which were too noisy for them
by day.'</p>

<p>So many of those good friends have gone to explore across the
Last Divide! Heber Green, young to be a Doctor of Science, was one
of the best and one of those whose passing I regret the most.
Mercifully, a number of the earliest members of the Walking Club
still survive, and one of our pleasures is to come together in a
stroll at a week-end. I cannot refrain from a story of one of them.
He has grown more absent-minded with the years until, on a longish
trip, he will now mislay most of his losable belongings. One night,
on top of Mount Wellington, I was trying to read at a little fire
and by the light of a candle which I had stuck in the earth. Seated
on the ground, I was aware of the legs of my absent-minded friend,
who had strolled across to me and stood warming himself at my fire.
I went on reading till, suddenly, my light went out. Believe it or
not, my friend had not noticed my lighted candle, and had sat down
on it!</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. THE PRESS</h2>

<p>As I came gradually to increase my press output, I took a
natural interest in the various journals, daily, weekly, monthly,
quarterly or annually published in Australia, most of them to die
an early death. I cannot suppose that there exist anywhere, even in
the Mitchell Library, files of the whole of those love-children of
enthusiasm, as they so often were. To succeed, Enthusiasm
<i>must</i> marry Capital, and generally Hope took the place of
necessary money. A survey of them, if that were possible, would
disclose a remarkable mass of matter, some of it excellent, which
has never been collected and put into volume form. I think readers
would be astonished at the number and variety of these has-beens. I
wonder of which of them it was that this story is told: A group of
writers and artists, conducting between them a struggling magazine,
stood in a Sydney street. Amongst them was the editor. A
well-dressed citizen passed. Off came the editor's hat in a
profound bow. 'Who was that?' asked one of the others. 'That?
That's our subscriber!' was the reply.</p>

<p>If I were writing advice to young reporters, I should begin by
saying: Take an interest in everything you have to report. In a
wide experience I have found that most of the juniors (and it
develops into a habit as seniors) regard each meeting or other
reportable matter much as a bricklayer regards each
brick&mdash;merely as something to put down and get rid of. They
listen to a speaker's words but do not bother about his thoughts.
His subject is merely something <i>he</i> is interested
in&mdash;the words are the thing, and once they are recorded, well,
that's another job done. It is a pose, of course, on the part of
the young&mdash;I could preach a telling sermon against it if space
would permit. Definitely, it is opposed to their own future
welfare: a newspaper man, above all, should have a wide background
of knowledge and should miss no chance of gaining it.</p>

<p>With trepidation I began to send prose and verse to that great
encourager of letters, the <i>Bulletin,</i> and was moved equally
by their acceptance and their rejection&mdash;for to see one's
stuff in print was then bliss indeed, while the frankness, not to
say rudeness, of the remarks on any rejected matter almost burnt
holes in my sensitive skin. (By the way, my wife's father, Arthur
Croall, came to Australia as a wood-engraver. An odd job one day
was to cut the first block of that script title, 'The Bulletin,'
which that Sydney paper uses to-day.)</p>

<p>But there was much matter that was not suitable for the Sydney
weekly, and that matter was tried on the <i>Argus</i> and was found
acceptable. Dr. Cunningham was then editor. For years he and his
successor, R. L. Curthoys, were kind to my work, and on two of my
Central Australian journeys I was given authority to act as
representative of the <i>Argus,</i> the <i>Australasian</i> and the
<i>Sydney Morning Herald.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Herald</i> (Melbourne) was always a good acceptor of my
stuff. When Guy Innes succeeded the athletic J. E. Davidson as
editor, he suggested a series of articles on walking trips. I did
it under a general caption: 'The Open Road, Being the Ways of Many
Walkers.' The sketches proved so popular that they ran for six
months without a break, and had a revival for a short season during
the succeeding Christmas vacation. They form the major portion of
the book which Robertson and Muliens were later to produce.</p>

<p>Mention of the <i>Herald</i> recalls that I started sporting
journalism by writing, with a fellow-runner, Percival Serle,
harrier notes for the <i>Sportsman,</i> long since dead and gone.
We were very young then. We earned, I think, half a crown a week
each. On that paper, by the way, another good friend of mine,
Charlie Smith, was a compositor. By sheer ability he was to rise
through the ranks to become what he is now&mdash;Managing Editor of
the biggest newspaper combination in Western Australia. Presently I
linked up with the <i>Weekly Times</i> (Melbourne) as its writer on
athletics, and, under the pen-name 'All Round,' I contributed a
column weekly for nearly thirty years.</p>

<p>I would be out running with the harriers on Saturday afternoon,
and tramping with the Walking Club on Sunday, and every Monday
night was devoted to the writing of the stuff for my column. It had
to be in the office on Tuesday morning. What a job it was
sometimes, particularly in the off season! Then I must, like a
spider, weave a web from within, for often there was nothing
doing&mdash;outside&mdash;yet the column must be kept open. Like
Whistler, in his famous defence, I relied on 'the knowledge of a
lifetime.' In retrospect I fancy those essays on various aspects of
sport, written in the 'off' season, were better value than the mere
records of happenings with which I customarily must fill my space.
I outlived several editors while on this job, George Mulchinock,
always a good friend to the Australian writer, being the last and
best of them. Long may he prosper!</p>

<p>A youthful reporter of those days (now almost a veteran in the
sporting world) used to make himself a great nuisance to us all in
his search for news. When in doubt, I became his referee. I liked
him well enough, but he grew wearisome. At last I began to play
jokes upon him, but that was no good: he never saw them! He
badgered me intolerably one season for an early pull of the Walking
Club's syllabus showing the forthcoming outings. The Secretary was
ill with, of all things for a grown man to catch, measles. In his
absence the card was held up. I wrote to the importunate one (who
knew nothing about the measles) that the card would be out
soon&mdash;'the Secretary is now considering new spots.' That
cryptic utterance duly went in!</p>

<p>Of making many printers' errors there is, of course, no end.
Doubtless the compositor is often like the office boy who did not
know who was responsible, but knew who was always blamed! However,
one notable error in my matter in a daily paper was definitely the
compositor's, though the 'reader' must take some of the
responsibility, too. I had written about a 'kitchen midden' (a
refuse heap dating back to aboriginal days) which I had visited in
the bush. The compositor knew better, so did the proof-reader. So I
found in print that what I had really done was to find a 'kitchen,
hidden in the bush'!</p>

<p>The champion misprint, said to have cost a Melbourne daily a
pretty sum to soothe the outraged feelings of a Jewish family, was
that memorable notice in the 'Births' column: 'To Mr. and Mrs. (a
well-known Hebrew name), a sow.' It is almost too good to be
true.</p>

<p>Ideas came too fast in those days. I found it hard to keep pace
with them and the commissions which began to come in from editors.
Under various names, I had prose and verse accepted in Victoria,
New South Wales and Queensland, while as far away as Canada an
enterprising monthly lifted a set of verses and did not correct a
very obvious printer's error in them!</p>

<p>A sectional paper, <i>The Public Service Journal,</i> then
edited by my old friend Gordon Carter, looked upon me apparently as
a sort of household poet who could, and would, concoct topical
rhymes upon any given subject at short notice. I used the pen-name
'Barak' (after the ancient 'king' of the Yarra Yarra tribe) until
found out; then I became 'Melbourne Mick.'</p>

<p>A swift run through my books of cuttings has given the names of
eighty-five newspapers and magazines which have published work of
mine. The reader who dislikes mere lists of names is advised to
skip the next paragraph. It records the titles of the journals,
whether important or unimportant, just referred to. They go in

<p>Many of those contributions were what the soldiers called
Buckshee, in other words, were given in response to requests, but
the others represent a considerable income. On year I made £150
from odds and ends of prose and verse&mdash;a substantial sum when
it is remembered that I had many other irons in the fire at the
same time. The game was irresistible; I had to keep going because,
not only did ideas come thick and fast and demand expression, but
editors had begun to send along little notes asking if I could
oblige with an article on so-and-so. Always, by the way, they were
in a hurry&mdash;on a certain occasion the request reached me by
messenger at 9 a.m., and the stuff was wanted by 11 a.m.! With the
approval of the then Director of Education (the matter was a
departmental one), I hid in a quiet room and duly turned out the
required column in the stipulated time.</p>

<p>When writing became my most important sideline and I was keeping
three columns a week going, I was often asked why I did not go in
altogether for journalism. I cannot be too thankful that I repelled
the tempters. The newspaper world is too wearing for men of my
temperament; the daisies would have been growing over me long ago
had I entered it completely. The newspaper man's best gift from his
fairy godmother would be a present of his sensitiveness (if he
happened to be born with any) in a nice little bottle to keep on
his mantelpiece...and never use. It is odd ('funny queer, not funny
ha ha' as an American friend puts it) how few of our journalists
become authors of books. So much brilliant and capable writing is
printed every day, yet of the brilliant and capable producers of
that writing, it would be safe to say that not one in ten ever
comes into the literary field with a volume. Presumably, for a
journalist such a job is knocking off work to carry bricks, or, at
best, a busman's holiday.</p>

<p>Journalism may, of course, be a stepping stone to other (I will
not say higher) things. My giant friend, Irvine Douglas, who began
newspaper work as a junior on the Melbourne <i>Age,</i> passed to
the Sydney <i>Sun</i> and then to the <i>Sydney Morning Herald,</i>
became Publicity Officer for the Commonwealth and, at time of
writing, is Private Secretary to the Prime Minister. But his
ability and fitness for advanced work were outstanding. I hold him
to be a good example of the young reporter who is interested in his
wonderful opportunities to learn, and takes full advantage of them.
My only regret is that the interminable hours of duty in his
present post keep Douglas from exercising his talent for verse and
prose of a non-political kind.</p>

<p>When Keith Murdoch took over the editorship of the Melbourne
<i>Herald,</i> he made many changes. I was in and out of the office
a good deal in those days, and often found myself caught by 'K.M.'
and asked what I thought of such and such a new feature. One day he
pulled me into a room. 'You know lots of stories,' he said. 'Sit
down and write some. They must be short&mdash;not more than three
or four lines.' I wrote some there and then (typical was the tale
of the school ma'am who wanted the class to note that the elephant
has a trunk. 'Now, what is it that elephants have that no other
animal has?' she asked. And the bright child answered: 'Little
elephants, miss!') and wrote scores more afterwards for the 'Who
Told You That?' which tags the 'In Town and Out' column on the
leader page. Percy Jenkin, witty and genial, was the first
'Rouseabout' I knew, and he gave me space for many paragraphs. The
friendly personal tone of that column was carried over to the
<i>Star</i> when Percy joined up for a time with that ill-fated
paper.</p>

<p>When 'K.M.' became Sir Keith, the whole of the <i>Herald</i>
staff became appropriately congratulatory, and in the general
jubilation was mingled the usual amount of facetiousness. Percy
Jenkin's neat retort to a fellow officer is legendary. 'Good
morning, Sir Percy,' hailed the officer, a huge man whose lower
chest stood out like a bay window. 'Good morning, Circumference!'
was Percy's riposte.</p>

<p>I have always liked the <i>Age,</i> except in one regard. That
is (I should rather say was) its policy of seeing no good in
anything conducted by the Public Service, or in any of the doings
of a public institution such as, for instance, the Metropolitan
Board of Works or the Railway Department. As a watchdog and fighter
for reform, the paper has proved its value, but it would have had
much more weight if it had not been so uniformly fault-finding. A
note of querulousness used to be in every
pronouncement&mdash;frequently a good effort at reform was spoilt
by lack of a little generous recognition of good work done.
'There's always a snarl in the voice!' said someone, and one
morning that able citizen, Sir John Monash, then head of the
Electricity Commission, remarked with a smile: 'I feel quite sorry
for <i>The Age</i> to-day: the Commission has just shown a
profit!'</p>

<p>For many years the dead hand of its great founder (it is said)
prevented the <i>Age</i> from using pictures in its columns,
whether as news or as advertising blocks. No newspaper to-day,
however, can afford to be without illustrations, so the <i>Age</i>
has now as many pictures as it can squeeze in. A curious practice
is its custom of omitting the author's name from a contributed
article. That is such a definite loss to the paper itself that the
interested reader marvels that the proprietors tolerate it. An
authority on a particular subject contributes an article on that
subject, and the paper informs the public that it is by 'R.K.' or
P.J.' or whatever the expert's initials are. Few indeed recognize
the writer in the initials, so the article is unread by thousands
who would have been attracted by the expert's name.</p>

<p>Occasionally the rule is varied, apparently because of the
eminence of a particular writer. The result has often been comical
in its disclosure of the office estimate of values. I recall an
article on the late Sir Baldwin Spencer. Only the initials of the
writer were given, yet that writer is as great a scientist as Sir
Baldwin was; moreover, they had worked much together.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Leonard V. Biggs I must say that the <i>Age</i> has
improved under his editorship, and that I enjoy my occasional
opportunities of sharing his witty company.</p>

<p>The Mercury which adorns the Collins Street face of the
<i>Age</i> office was observed one morning to have fluttering from
it what looked like the beginning of a costume. A well-known and
popular member of the staff, Henrietta McGowan, had been married
the day before to Mr. Frank Walker, and a fellow officer had marked
the occasion by climbing to the roof and tying to Mercury's flying
limb a large white satin bow.</p>

<p>Never was a brighter, more generous-spirited woman than
Henrietta Walker. I was at her wedding; a year or two ago I
followed her to the graveside.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. THE INLAND AND THE
NATIVE</h2>

<p>Central Australia, where I have now been five times, was long a
place of desire. When my Sister Elizabeth and her husband, Albert
Watts, went to live at Quorn, a township sitting at the foot of the
Flinders Range in South Australia, I paid her two visits. They
quickened my wish to see more of the remarkable country on the edge
of which Quorn is placed. That was some forty years ago. The first,
a Spring journey, left two vivid memories. One is of the seemingly
endless fields of young wheat which made much of South Australia so
beautiful just then; the other is of a shooting trip to which we
were invited. Our hosts were two young men of the district, tall
and powerful, sons of a German settler. The conveyance was a light
open cart with one fixed seat which held the two brothers. Behind
them, a board rested its ends on the sides of the cart and was
secured to the front seat by a stout rope. That rope was tied to
the middle of the board and was all that held the 'seat' in place,
and all that my brother-in-law and I had to hold on to. In
retrospect I feel that the two half-broken horses never went at
less than a gallop. Lightweights that we were, our board would
often rise beneath us, and Albert and I and the board would stream
out behind like the tail of a comet. It was strenuous work hanging
on, and I rejoiced when I saw ahead a dry creek bed, its banks
steep and its bottom wide and stony, which must mean a slackening
of the furious pace.</p>

<p>Not it! The driver flapped the reins on the backs of his steeds
and let out a yell. Down the near side we charged, arrived in the
bed still miraculously right side up, then, with a further yell, we
rattled over the boulders and went at the opposing bank. That
almost stopped the gallant beasts. As we topped it and at last
slowed down for a breather, our friends looked round, presumably to
find if we were still there. We were; but only by desperate
clinging.</p>

<p>On their appearance, those two big men would have passed, in
South Africa, for Boers. Like so many of the Boers, too, they were
wonderful shots and wonderful judges of distance. A rabbit crouched
in a small clearing on the hillside about a hundred yards away.
Gauging its distance beautifully, one of the men put a rifle bullet
through its head. Euros (the hill kangaroo) were plentiful, and we
secured a number&mdash;sheer waste of life, as I see it now, for we
did nothing with either carcase or pelt.</p>

<p>The little town seemed prosperous enough, but recurring droughts
must have hit it hard, for its welfare derived mainly from pastoral
and agricultural interests. Some twenty miles away, through the
picturesque Pitchi Ritchi Pass, lay Port Augusta at the head of
Spencer Gulf. The Gulf is very narrow there, but the water must be
deep, for I recall visiting a relative-by-marriage, Captain Brodie,
of the Blue Anchor line, who had brought his ship that far when I
was at Quorn.</p>

<p>The ubiquitous Chinese gardener had established himself in
Quorn. This one had married an Irish girl, and a good husband he
proved. One morning he was greatly elated&mdash;a daughter had been
born to him. 'What name you call her?' asked my sister, and the
proud parent replied, with the customary difficulty of his
countrymen to manage the 'r' sound: 'Luby Blidget!'</p>

<p>Standing on the top of the Devil's Peak, a high point of the
Flinders, I looked to the north with special interest. I wanted to
see places like Hergott Springs, the very name of which spelt
mystery, while the word Oodnadatta was all that 'Mesopotamia' could
have meant to the Bishop. And those places lay there in the haze,
beyond vision but not beyond imagining. I went so far as to find
out what could be done in the three weeks which were the limit of
my holiday. Well, that was easy. A train ran once a fortnight to
Oodnadatta; a coach left Oodnadatta for Alice Springs every sixth
week! I gave it up!</p>

<p>Perhaps that was just as well, seeing that I wanted to retain my
job in the Public Service! I could not be away for longer than the
regulation holiday period, and tales of slow trains and uncertain
coaches were plentiful. If one were to credit what he heard, the
transport service was truly happy-go-lucky&mdash;probably a gross
injustice when difficulties were so great. But the yarns were many.
Quorn told me of the artisan who went up the line to do a job,
finished it in a few days, and was so much in debt to the local
publican before the returning fortnightly train happened along that
he found it almost impossible to get home again. Then on another
occasion the train stopped in the middle of a waste where no man
lived. The interested passengers saw first the fireman, then the
engine-driver, and finally the guard, all climb down and start off
for, apparently, the far horizon. But they were only after the
Sturt Desert Pea, which was just then in flower, and presently the
whole train was ablaze from end to end with the beautiful blooms,
for everyone decided to 'take some home to the missus.' More
exciting was another halt, again in a wide desolation, when the two
officials on the engine, showing definite signs of having 'had a
few,' pulled up the train to fight out a couple of quite
ineffectual rounds. They finished an amicable bottle together
before getting the conveyance going again. Apocryphal? Perhaps.</p>

<p>But my dream of the north lingered, despite all discouragement.
So, when an old friend, Professor Stanley D. Porteus, of the Hawaii
University, looked in at my office one day, and mentioned that he
would like me to go with him to Central Australia, he found me more
than willing. That was the Spring of 1929. He had been commissioned
by the Australian National Research Council to make a study of the
mentality of the Australian aboriginal, and he had already spent
some time in the north-west of the continent.</p>

<p>I have told in my book, <i>Wide Horizons,</i> a good deal of
what happened to us. Professor Porteus has given a more detailed
account in his <i>Psychology of a Primitive People.</i> Anyone who
wishes to gain a scientific view of the position our aborigines
hold in the scale of intelligence should read that book, and follow
it with Porteus's later work, <i>Primitive Intelligence and
Environment,</i> which is an absorbing narrative of a journey
through the Kalahari Desert in Africa, with much shrewd comment on
the Bushmen.</p>

<p>I have been lectured by a rather ponderous critic for stating
somewhere that the old men of the Arunta at Hermannsburg had told
Porteus and myself that they had admitted us as members of the
tribe. I was careful to explain how little significance we attached
to this action of a people whose initiation rites are fierce and
bloody and secret, and extend, with intervals, over years. I called
our association with them a sort of honorary membership. But my
critic friend had met people who claimed, seriously, admission into
native tribal life, and the chance was too good to miss. So he made
me the whipping boy for the real sinners.</p>

<p>His was the only discordant voice amongst the critics of my
<i>Wide Horizons.</i> In contrast, a man of real experience in the
Inland said: 'Your book is one hundred per cent. right.'</p>

<p>That first visit was in the fifth year of what proved to be a
five years' drought. The land seemed dead. Carcases of cattle lay,
mummified, wherever water had been. As I said at the time, it
seemed as if Life had taken one look at the place and had gone away
again. Porteus, fresh from green Pacific islands, thought it a pity
that any white man should be allowed to settle in such an arid
wilderness. But the settlers, we found, grimly holding on to their
leases, did not share his view. The whole thing was a gamble, like
most other businesses. Given a good season, the soil responded
wonderfully, grasses and other herbage grew in amazing fashion, and
where there were saltbush and mulga the stock could resist anything
but the most serious of the droughts. They do not ask much of
Nature, these settlers: I was assured-by one cattleman that if his
holding could receive four inches of rain yearly, he would 'turn
out the best fat cattle in the Commonwealth.'</p>

<p>That suggests the real need of the great Inland of
Australia&mdash;water. Until that can be supplied (not necessarily
in quantities, but at the right time), I have the feeling that the
permanent population can never be much greater than it is now. A
goldfield like Tennant Creek, for instance, will collect some
thousands of people and, if rich enough and big enough, could
possibly secure the creation of huge reservoirs in the Macdonnell
Ranges, or nearer, with which the field could be linked up (even as
Coolgardie is linked, by a pipe-line some 300 miles long) with
sources of supply. That would mean, in turn, closer settlement,
more abundant food supplies and improved conditions generally.</p>

<p>Goldfields, however, are notoriously impermanent and, as I see
it now, this large hinterland seems destined to be cattle country
for all time. The sheepman is advancing north a bit, but gingerly
so far, and mining in gold, tin, wolfram, osmiridium, opal, mica
and other minerals will always prove a fascinating, if not always
profitable, pursuit. But cattle are the mainstay, and must remain
so for many years.</p>

<p>The tourist is a distinct possibility as a help to the advance
of the Inland. But, and it is a prodigious but, there is much to be
done before a really appreciable business can be established in
that line. The wealthy Americans who come to Australia in luxury
ships desire, very often, to see our Stone Age aborigines, but two
obstacles are in the way&mdash;want of time to reach the Centre (so
distant from the coast), and absence of that extravagant comfort
which they consider their money entitles them to. I am writing, at
this moment (27th June, 1938) sitting in a car at the entrance to
Palm Valley, about 100 miles west of Alice Springs, which, in turn,
is roughly 1000 miles north of Adelaide. Should the tourists just
mentioned elect to follow the road we came, the only one open
lately owing to washaways caused by a flood last February, they
would be horrified by the difficulties. Almost every creek-crossing
must be matted (that is, rolls of coconut matting must be laid and
relaid several times to keep the car from sinking in the sand), and
at each of these pauses myriads of small flies would torment the
passengers.</p>

<p>If they came by train they could go no farther by that means
than Alice Springs; cars must then be taken over roads of varying
degrees of badness (from a city standpoint)&mdash;the best of which
must offend people who, it is recorded, objected to a single mile
of unbitumened road near Melbourne! The train is comfortable enough
for the ordinary citizen, but I fear that the tourists I am now
discussing do not regard themselves as ordinary citizens.</p>

<p>Air travel would probably suit them better, and that swift
method of travel is now available.</p>

<p>But, whichever way they come, they are faced by the fact that
the accommodation at Alice Springs, good as it is, is much behind
the standards demanded by such pampered world travellers. They must
face the fact, too, that the native, in a native state, is still
far to seek. All the aborigines who may be met within hundreds of
miles of Alice Springs are clothed, and are more likely to be seen
opening tins and making tea than chasing game or dancing
corroborees. Out in the Macdonnells a few days ago Arltinga, a
Loritja looking for a Euro, smiled pityingly when I asked him where
were his spears. 'No usem spear, now; usem rifle!' He had more
clothes on than I had. At a distance the tourist will distinguish
the aboriginal from the white man only by the fact that the native
carries himself so much better than the average European.</p>

<p>Tourist traffic is certainly growing, and an increasing number
of Australians are finding interest and pleasure in becoming
acquainted with this part of their country.</p>

<p>Porteus and I went from Alice Springs to Hermannsburg, more
correctly the Finke River Mission. Lutherans, persecuted in Germany
on religious ground, emulated the Pilgrim Fathers by emigrating.
Many came to South Australia, and a missionary zeal sent some of
them inland to convert the aborigines. Several stations were formed
and doubtless all would still be in existence but for the pestilent
habit of the tribes in dying. Contact with the whites has been
fatal in most cases, whether that contact has been lay or church.
Hermannsburg survives, and I am assured by its present pastor, the
Rev. F. A. Albrecht, that the wastage has been checked and the
births are now exceeding the deaths.</p>

<p>About 300 are on the mission books to-day, mainly
Arunta&mdash;the remnants of the large tribe of many branches,
which once were undisputed lords of this Larapinta Land&mdash;the
land of the source and gorges of the Finke River. A likeable people
we found them&mdash;always ready to smile, quick judges of
character, a people one would do much to have survive.</p>

<p>I fear the worst. Hermannsburg is one small raft on an ocean of
waste. Valiant efforts I know are being made for the native
generally by such enlightened workers as the Rev. J. R. B. Love
(amongst the Worora) and others, but one cannot help remembering
that there are no native Tasmanians alive, that the 6,000
aboriginal Victorians are now down to something under 100, and that
the tale of the census shows a general decrease for Australia
whenever a tally is taken. The existing period is patently one of
transition for the 60,000 who still remain. At the Jay River
Reserve, ruled over by the capable Patrol Officer, Mr. T. G. A.
Strehlow, some 300 natives of several tribes have made
almost-permanent homes. Here the Government hands out, each Friday,
10 lbs. of flour, so much tea and so much sugar, to each old
person. The camp shelters vary from a well-roofed low hut to the
old-time, elementary break-wind of branches. Transition? Yes! Here
may be seen a kangaroo being cooked as Stone Age man cooked it, in
a hot hole in the ground, but it is eaten with damper of white
flour, and a brew of tea washes it down; young men, uninitiated and
intending to remain so, lowering their voices if they mention the
still-dreaded Kurdaitcha and hiding the still-sacred bullroarer
should a woman or child pass by; old men, as grave and as
conventionally dressed as any elder of a Scottish kirk, carrying
spears and woomera on a hunting expedition, smoking a clay pipe as
they go; a fully-clothed ancient singing hymns lustily at the
frequent church services, and keeping holiday on days of religious
festival, yet telling privately, with equal seriousness, of the
'bad fellow snake&mdash;beeg fellow' whose huge body made the gap
known as Standley Chasm and whose descendants still guard certain
waterholes where no man dare go.</p>

<p>What is to be the outcome of this mixing and changing? I am no
prophet. The children sang us a song at Hermannsburg; translated,
it said: 'I do not know the name of my sadness. I look to the hills
where my fathers sought the kangaroo. To-day I cannot find a single
one!' A requiem?</p>

<p>My excursions into the Centre gave me many newspaper and
magazine articles, and quickened my interest in the natives so much
that when my friend Stan. Mitchell suggested the formation of an
Anthropological Society in Victoria I agreed readily. He obtained
copies of the constitution of the New South Wales Society and I
drafted circulars and had them typed. We wanted Professor Wood
Jones as President, knowing that his name would help greatly, but
he was going for a year to China. He promised he would help on
return and we postponed action till he did so. The Society is a
sound concern to-day. Wood Jones held the Presidency for two years,
then A. S. Kenyon for one, then I had it for twelve months, and D.
A. Casey is at present in the chair.</p>

<p>Wood Jones was a remarkable man. He was anatomist first, I
suppose, as Anatomy was his chair, but he had also a world
reputation as an anthropologist, and he was quite unusually gifted
as a writer. His lectures were, in the old phrase, 'a liberal
education.' The matter was invariably good, while his choice of
words and happy turns of phrase were a delight to hear. He was on
the lean side, tallish but not tall, with a small, very neat, head
and quick, observant eyes. With all his learning he could confess
ignorance. 'What is it that constitutes <i>quality</i> in a brain?'
he was asked at one of his talks on Anthropology. 'You have told us
it is not size, or shape, or convolutions&mdash;what actually is it
that makes for value?' And the professor answered: 'Search me!'</p>

<p>One of the outcomes of all this travel on my part has been a
collection of aboriginal implements which has yielded us much
interest. It is particularly rich in the sacred articles known as
Churinga (or Tjurunga, as some spell it). Mainly concerned with
Central Australia, it has been added to through excursions to old
camps in Victoria, on several of which my son has joined me. He had
an unusual experience in the Spring of 1937, when he took part with
Mr. Murray Black, of Tarwin Meadows (Gippsland), in an excursion
into the Riverina near Wakool to obtain aboriginal skeletons for
the Canberra Museum, then presided over by Sir Colin Mackenzie.
They dug up over a score of skeletons during Robin's stay of a
fortnight; the eventual total was over 200. The implements we have
from Victorian camps are axes, knives, scrapers, 'crescents,'
'points,' ochre mills, seed mills, pounding stones and axe
sharpeners&mdash;all of various kinds of stone&mdash;and a few,
<i>a</i> very few, wooden weapons. They have come mainly from
Tarwin and various points on the coastline such as Cape Otway and
Portland; but many inland parts of the State are also
represented.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the captious critic, let me say that, in
summarizing my impressions of the Australian aboriginal, I am well
aware that no one in this world (and least of all the average
Government official, in Darwin or elsewhere) can speak definitely
of the past, any more than he can speak with assurance of the
future, of these interesting people. I have noted facts at
first-hand as they have come before me; deductions from those facts
are not presented as more than my personal opinions.</p>

<p>My reaction to the aboriginal each time that I meet him in
Central Australia is always one of disgust with my own kind. I am
not speaking of the wild, naked people (rarely to be met with now),
but of those who have eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and
evil, as introduced by us, and have learnt shame. In other words,
they are clothed. Usually that transforms them from upright,
free-moving men and women to shambling mendicants. Then we scorn
them for being shabby and for being beggars, conditions which we
have forced upon them.</p>

<p>The sophistication to-day of the native in the neighbourhood of
white settlement is illustrated in a conversation with one I met in
the Macdonnell Ranges. He had a boy with him. I asked the lad's
name. The reply was either 'Benny' or 'Penny,' I was not sure
which. 'What name?' I repeated. The man made a gesture as of
flicking a coin into the air. 'Penny. Alla same toss-up!' he
replied. He evidently was well acquainted with the great Australian
game of Two-up.</p>

<p>Recently, too, I have learnt of a full-blood Arunta who has a
bank account and pays for goods by cheque! He is Albert Namatjira,
a man who, though he has never been out of Central Australia, has
established a reputation as an artist, handling water-colours with
a skill and sensitive appreciation of values remarkable in such
circumstances. His cash, now in the bank, came from a successful
show of his work, assuredly the first of its kind in the world,
held in Melbourne in 1938 and opened by Lady Huntingfield, wife of
the Governor of Victoria. She had met him in Central Australia. My
friend Rex Battarbee gave him a few lessons in painting; beyond
that Albert has had no art tuition. The missionary school at
Hermannsburg, on the Finke River, taught him to write and to read
in Arunta.</p>

<p>Australia has two remarkable inventions to her credit. Doubtless
she has many more, but in those two she definitely led the world.
Each has been a great national boon, benefiting particularly the
people living far from cities. One is the system whereby
back-country children receive education by
correspondence&mdash;this must be credited to Frank Tate, then
Director of Education in Victoria, and James McRae, at that time
Principal of the Teachers' Training College in Melbourne. It has
spread over the whole of the Commonwealth and far beyond. Call at
any remote homestead, separated by perhaps fifty miles from the
nearest neighbour, and you will likely find (as I have found so
many times), the mother superintending the children's
lessons&mdash;lessons sent hundreds of miles by post.</p>

<p>The other is the brain child of another Victorian, the Rev. John
Flynn. Originating in a Presbyterian organization known as the
Australian Inland Mission, it has outgrown its parents' house and
is now the Australian Aerial Medical Services, with centres dotted
about Australia, wireless sets (sending and receiving) in private
homes, and a staff of medical men who use aeroplanes to reach, and
convey, their patients.</p>

<p>These are the great amenities of life in Central Australia.
Coupled with the efforts of several missions, they have made the
lot of the white settlers safer and happier&mdash;have thrown 'a
mantle of safety' over the widely-scattered community.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that my earliest acquaintances with the Inland
was made as a member of Professor Porteus's expedition in 1929; my
second trip was a run to Marree with S. R. Mitchell and Ray Golland
in 1930; the third (in two Ford cars) was with A. S. Kenyon (State
Rivers and Water Supply), my brother Charles, Ron Neil (of the
<i>Age</i> newspaper), the well-known naturalist A. H. Mattingley,
Chris. Bailey (Melbourne Walking Club), H. P. McColl (Field
Naturalists' Club), and Jack Shoebridge (State Rivers); the fourth
with two artists, Rex Battarbee and John Gardner, in 1934; the
fifth, again with two artists (John Gardner and Will Rowell) in
1938. The longest was the trip headed by A. S. Kenyon: we went to
Alice Springs by way of Coober Pedy, and returned via the Jervois
Range and down the Birdsville track in West
Queensland&mdash;incidentally, calling on George Aiston (co-author
with Dr. George Horne, of <i>Savage Life in Central Australia)</i>
at his home in remote Mulka.</p>

<p>During the 1938 trip I collected native Silverfish for the
Melbourne University and narrowly escaped having one of the active
little pests named after me, for at Standley Chasm I captured a new
species&mdash;now Acrotelsella silvestri.</p>

<p>Just a word on that invaluable beast of burden, the camel. I
cannot warm to him, useful as he is&mdash;as someone has said: 'I
can't imagine anyone but a mother camel loving a camel.' I have
written a good deal about him elsewhere, and desire now merely to
note that the ungainly beast has taken to ringbarking the
eucalypts. I knew that, like the goat, he was reputed to eat
anything he could bite, but I was not prepared to find, as I did,
several places where camels had to be excluded because they were
killing the gum trees.</p>

<p>And here is a story which will be my sole contribution to the
Lasseter Reef legend. A bushman leaned over the bar at Oodnadatta
recently and showed a nice gold specimen. 'Where did you get that?'
he was asked. 'That's tellings!' was his rejoinder. 'Well, what are
you going to do with it?' continued the questioner. The bushie
smiled a knowing smile. Then, with quiet emphasis: 'I'm going to
find it one day out in the desert.'</p>

<p>I recall gratefully many valued friendships formed in Central
Australia or on the way there. Albert Miles, opal-gouger, of Coober
Pedy, has proved himself a good 'roadside pal' (his own words); I
have the happiest recollections of the unstinted hospitality of
long-established pastoral families such as the Picks, of Coondambo
and East Well, the Stanes of Erldunda, and the Gills of Doctor's
Stones, in whose friendly houses I have always been made to feel
really at home; and pleasant indeed are the memories associated
with certain padres of various sects&mdash;John Flynn himself and
his fellow Presbyterian J. Andrew Barber; the Methodist
representatives at Alice Springs, H. Griffiths and his helpful
wife; Pastor and Mrs. Albrecht, of the Finke River Mission; just to
name a few where so many have been kind.</p>

<p>I owe much to Mr. H. A. Heinrich, once of Hermannsburg, for
advice and assistance during my first visit to the Inland; and I
must record my admiration for the work performed by certain Federal
officers (the name of D. D. Smith, Resident Engineer at Alice
Springs, comes at once to mind) whose duties, often extremely
difficult, are spread over areas greater than some European
countries.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. SOME BOOKS AND
FRIENDSHIPS</h2>

<p>Writing now in my home in Camberwell (Vic.), I face a book-case
which holds a wealth of memories, for most of the books have been
inscribed by their authors or are rare editions picked up for the
proverbial pence. Adam Lindsay Gordon shot himself on June 24th,
1870, the day following the publication of his <i>Bush Ballads and
Galloping Rhymes.</i> A copy of that first issue stands alongside
the unhappy poet's other two books, also first
editions&mdash;<i>Ashtaroth, by the author of Sea Spray and Smoke
Drift</i> (published June 10th, 1867), and <i>Sea Spray and Smoke
Drift, by the author of Ashtaroth</i> (published June 19th, 1867).
It is recorded that 500 copies of each of this pair were printed,
that the sales of <i>Ashtaroth</i> were negligible, and that only
about 100 of the other found purchasers. My browsing in second-hand
book shops brought these to light&mdash;total cost (despite their
comparative rarity), 4/6.</p>

<p>Alongside is a contemporary volume, Kendall's <i>Leaves from
Australian Forests</i> (1869), not very scarce, but this copy a bit
more interesting because it bears the signature of Garnet Walch,
that bright journalist of last generation who was one-time
Secretary of the Melbourne Athenaeum, but was much better known as
a writer of pantomimes. Jolly pantomimes they were; full of puns
and general hilarity&mdash;proper stuff for the youngsters...and
not too bad for father and mother!</p>

<p>Almost of the same period are some Brunton Stephens books. The
earliest I have is <i>Convict Once: a Poem,</i> which is dated
1871&mdash;Macmillan published it in London. <i>The Black Gin and
other Poems</i> (Melbourne, George Robertson, 1875) comes next in
order of dates; the others are <i>A Hundred Pounds: a Novelette</i>
(Melbourne, Samuel Mullen, 1876), <i>The Godolphin Arabian</i>
(Brisbane, Watson Ferguson, 1894) and <i>Fayette, an Original
Australian Comic Opera in three Acts. Music by George B. Allen</i>
(Brisbane, Watson Ferguson, 1892). An able versatile writer whom I
wish I had met. Each of these was picked up for a few pence.</p>

<p>It was always good fun, if not always good hunting, 'doing' the
second-hand shops, and the game became exciting when, as so
frequently happened, I was accompanied by my equally keen friend,
Percival Serle. By agreement, we would start on the same shelf at
the same time, working from opposite ends to meet, we hoped, in the
middle. Where we did meet depended on our luck, for delay to
examine a possible 'find' might enable the other fellow to gain a
big lead. I was fond of Australiana; Serle desired mainly good
editions of English authors: at the close of a profitable hunt we
were remarkably like the famous Jack Spratt and his wife&mdash;both
contented.</p>

<p>Odds and ends hold interest&mdash;this Carlyle <i>Latter-day
Pamphlets,</i> for instance, mainly because it shows Marcus
Clarke's signature on the title page. Just below his name is
written 'Moon &amp; Rowel, Melbourne, 1899' in, I think, Clarke's
hand. Who were Moon &amp; Rowell? That reminds me that I once wrote
for the <i>Argus</i> a 'Litter-day Pamphlet' during a public
attempt to correct our people's bad habit of leaving rubbish about,
especially in beautiful picnic places. I still think it a rather
happy pun. A few other old things neighbour it, such as: <i>A New
Verfion of the Psalms of David fitted to the Tunes ufed in
Churches,</i> printed for the Company of Stationers <i>and are to
be Sold by moft Bookfellers</i> (the old-fashioned 's' gives a
queer modern turn to that word 'booksellers'). It was the joint
production of N. Brady, D.D., Chaplain in Ordinary to His Majesty,
and Nahum Tate, the then Poet Laureate, or Poet Laureat, as the
printer spells it. A bookplate declares, with much heraldic
flourishing, that this was once the property of the Mackewan of
Muckly, Dungarthill. The book is dated 1751:</p>

<p class="poem">Georgius Secundus was then alive,<br>
Snuffy old drone from the German hive</p>

<p>as Holmes has it.</p>

<p>The next two make me wonder how many pirated editions there were
of Sterne's famous <i>Sentimental Journey.</i> He published it as
'by Mr. Yorick' in 1768. One of my volumes bears the date 1783; it
was (very discreetly) printed 'by the proprietors'! The other,
dated 1791 and embellished with a copperplate frontispiece, was
'sold by all booksellers in town and country.' Each, by the way,
supplies a continuation of the <i>Journey,</i> by someone styling
himself Eugenius, in which Sterne's style is fairly capably
maintained.</p>

<p>More recent in first editions are Mrs. Gaskell's anonymously
issued <i>Cranford</i> (1853), Charles Kingsley's <i>Andromeda</i>
(1858), and Longfellow's <i>Song of Hiawatha</i> (London, David
Bogue, 1855). The last-named has the <i>ex libris</i> of the Rev.
George Richard Mackarness, M.A., Vicar of Ashbourne, Derbyshire,
and is signed by still another ex-owner, 'John Duke Coleridge,
1855.' This was the Coleridge, a grand-nephew of the poet, who rose
to be Lord Chief Justice of England.</p>

<p>But that's enough of older days. I've much more pleasure in the
possession of works of my own period, for in most cases I have
known the authors. William Moore, with whom I collaborated, many
years ago, in the production of the Australian Drama Nights, gave
me several books and drawings. One volume, produced by Whitcombe
and Tombs, bears the unpromising title of <i>Health Reader,</i> but
(however unlikely!) it is illustrated by Norman Lindsay. His
brother-in-law, Dr. J. S. C. Elkington, supplied the text. The
pictures (surely Norman set out to enjoy himself!) are comical
beyond belief. The one labelled 'The Wrong Way to Take Meals' is
typical of all. Father, knife and fork in hand, vociferates so
wildly that he knocks his cup and saucer to the floor, sister
smacks the howling baby, mother reaches over to deal it out to the
two boys, who occupy all one side of the table with their box-on,
and Towzer, the dog, is making off with the leg of mutton. Yes, I
should say it is the wrong way! I think this must be one of the
really rare Australiana; inquiries all over the Commonwealth have
failed to produce another copy.</p>

<p>William Baylebridge is a man of genius, and so much of a
literary recluse that few indeed know him, even in Sydney, where he
now lives. I met him once only. He gave me this <i>Anzac
Muster</i>, which I value highly. It is a prose epic, masculine
from end to end. He writes with a style and a vigour which relate
to no other author; he is original in both outlook and statement.
My copy is No. 78 of an issue of 100, privately printed, as most of
his books have been. Baylebridge will always, I fear, be 'caviare
to the general.' That has been brought about partly by his early
practice of publishing under the name of William Blocksidge (even
to-day he signs his correspondence merely 'W.B.'), but more by the
fact that his poetry (and he is one of the greatest of our poets)
is so packed with thought that he cannot be read lightly. Here is
his <i>Love Redeemed,</i> too, No. 5 of a limited edition, again a
present. The inscription is: 'R. H. Croll from W.B.'</p>

</p>

<p>A valued friend was the New Zealander, Hubert Church, after he
settled in Melbourne. Too bad that so bright a personality should
have been cursed by deafness. It is a strain on both sides when
converse can be carried on only by using pad and pencil, and
particularly hard on an intellect like his. Yet whenever we met I
enjoyed his company. His volume, <i>Poems,</i> has this original
verse addressed to my son, some pertinence being gained by the fact
that Robin is an only child:</p>

<p class="poem">One flower is always best;<br>
And, hidden near the nest,<br>
One bird of all the brood<br>
Will sanctify the wood.<br></p>

<p>Particularly vivid are my memories of C. J. Dennis. He was
always known as 'Den,' but there was much more than that to it.
'Most effusively yours, Clarence James Michael Stanislaus Dennis,'
he once signed a letter to me, so giving his surprisingly full
name. This half-shelf of his books is the whole of his collected
writings, with one exception&mdash;the <i>Singing Garden.</i> That,
excellent in its way, is not Den at the top of his form. Like
Burns, he was best when using the vernacular. No one has ever
worked colloquialisms and slang phrases more neatly into verse;
there is always an effect of perfect naturalness. His first book
was <i>Back Block Ballads</i>, published by Cole, with a cover
design by Dave Low. Here are two copies, one in cloth, the other
paper-covered. Although it has in it the first four sections of the
<i>Sentimental Bloke,</i> also that rousing Australian Marseillaise
which he called the Austra-laise:</p>

<p class="poem">Fellers of Australier<br>
Blokes an' coves an' coots,<br>
Shift yer.....carcases,<br>
Move yer....boots,</p>

<p>the issue was a failure. Eventually Angus &amp; Robertson took
it over and issued a much-changed volume (here it is, too) under
the old title. But that was not until well after the 'Bloke' had
proved such a success.</p>

<p>J. G. ('Garry') Roberts and I worked hard to push the Ballads,
one device being printed stickers placed on all our correspondence;
another dodge was to stand in front of a bookseller's window which
showed a copy of the Ballads and, by a very obvious display of
interest, cause a little crowd to stop and look, too (quite easy,
by the way). Then I wrote at intervals to any newspaper, the
<i>Australasian,</i> for instance, which professed a desire to
answer inquiries; to these I would quote a few lines of Den and ask
where they came from. (A mean dodge, I think now, for some chap
would have a bad job hunting up such obscure references.)</p>

<p>I possess one of the original typescripts of the <i>Sentimental
Bloke</i> prepared by Den for publication. He did three on his
little typewriter ('I want a new typewriter&mdash;neuter!' said one
of his letters). He offered the book to George Robertson's
(Melbourne). It was declined. Then we debated bringing it out
either as a shilling paper-cover or in a limited subscription
edition at five shillings. Fortunately, it was decided to try Angus
&amp; Robertson; the sales have been amazing. I understand that a
first edition of the 'Bloke' has a collector value nowadays. This
one on my shelf may be worth something extra, for it is inscribed
by Den and by Hal Gye (the illustrator), has a signature and other
writings by Henry Lawson (who supplied the Foreword), and, by way
of additional embellishment, a caricature of Den, signed by Low,
has been pasted in, together with portraits of George Robertson
(Sydney), as publisher, and Mr. and Mrs. Roberts as dedicatees.
That, I think, makes a pretty piece of Grangerising&mdash;thorough,
and not overdone.</p>

<p>Here, too, are all his other first editions, inscribed and made
interesting in other ways as well. A true rarity is a small folder,
seven pages of printed matter, titled <i>The Battle of the
Wazzir</i>. This was given to me by Den with the explanation that
he wrote it for the <i>Bulletin</i> in 1916, intending to include
it in the volume, <i>The Moods of Ginger Mick,</i> which came out
that year. Three 'unrevised proofs' were pulled; one had to be
submitted to the censor, one was kept by Den, the third is the one
before me. Rumours had reached Australia that the A.I.F., when
camped in Egypt, had 'cleaned up' that particularly unsavoury
portion of Cairo known as the Wazzir&mdash;Den's was a poetic
version of a first-hand account of this which had been smuggled out
to him at the time. Unfortunately, the censor wouldn't pass it. The
result was that Den's effort remained unprinted, save for the three
copies, until the war was over and, so far as I know, it has never
appeared in volume form. My copy is signed 'C. J. Dennis, August
16th, 1917'; the printed date of the proof is 12th July, 1916. The
verses began:</p>

<p class="poem">If ole Pharaoh, King uv Egyp', 'ad been gazin on
the scene<br>
'E'd 'ave give the A.I.F. a narsty name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . . . . . .<br>
I'm tippin' they'd 'ave phenyled 'im, an' rubbed it in 'is
'ead,<br>
But old Pharaoh, King uv Egyp', 'e is dead.</p>

<p>Den could draw well. I have a number of his sketches, all with
humorous intent and all succeeding. We used to exchange
verses&mdash;a ragtime set, 'The Yea or Muddy,' in which I libelled
his river, brought from him by return 'The Glenferrie Rag,' in
which he professed to describe his efforts to find my Hawthorn
home.</p>

<p>That effort at Grangerising the 'Bloke' recalls another book, on
the same shelf, which I treated similarly. It is that choice
edition 'strictly limited to 2,000 copies,' of the <i>Selected
Poems of Henry Lawson</i> which Angus &amp; Robertson produced in
1918. It has a colour reproduction of Longstaff's portrait of
Lawson (in the N.S.W. National Gallery) as frontispiece, and the
poems are illustrated by that other able artist, Percy Leason.
Written by Henry across the half-title is: 'To R. H. Croll with
kind regards from Henry Lawson, Sydney, Xmas, 1918.' Sir John
Longstaff signed the portrait for me, and Leason the title-page. So
there's another good effort!</p>

<p>There are more Lawson mementoes here, but no other which appeals
to me quite so much as this paper-covered <i>Short Stories in Prose
and Verse,</i> for this was his first volume, and it has a romantic
history. 'L. Lawson, 402 George Street, Sydney,' published
it&mdash;that was Louisa Lawson, Henry's mother, who was then
editing a woman's journal, <i>The Dawn.</i> Henry's little brochure
(it has 96 pages) was printed at <i>The Dawn</i> office, 500 copies
in all. A boy was carrying the sheets to the binder when a
southerly buster (every Sydneysider knows what that means!) sprang
up and assaulted him. When he had recovered, he found a lot of his
precious bundle scattered along the street, the gutters capturing
their share. The result was that the already small edition was
considerably reduced. Apparently there was little demand for the
book, and it faded out of recognition altogether when, next year
(1896), Angus &amp; Robertson began to bring out the volumes by
which Lawson is now so well known, both in Australia and
abroad.</p>

<p>One of the mud-stained volumes is owned by Mary Gilmore
(Sydney); another she presented to Harold Peters (Melbourne) in
1933 as a thank-offering for his recovery from an almost fatal
illness. She had written in it the story of its rescue from the
mud&mdash;it is prized by its present owner as the gem of a
collection of modern first editions, most of them inscribed by
their authors in terms of gratitude.</p>

<p>My copy, bought in 1895, cost me one shilling. A Melbourne
bookseller is reported to have sold one for £10 recently.</p>

<p>In this copy I keep a rather sorry reminder of Henry's common
condition in his later years. It reads:</p>

<p class="cp">I.O.U.<br>
1/6<br>
Henrik Hertzberg Larsen<br>
Henry Lawson.</p>

<p>But here's another item of more than usual interest: <i>The Auld
Shop and the New. Written specially for 'The Chief,' George
Robertson, of Angus and Robertson, as some slight acknowledgment of
and small return for his splendid generosity during years of
trouble, and addressed to Donald Angus by Henry Lawson.</i> It was
printed for private circulation in 1923. I tried to buy a copy, but
George Robertson wrote me: 'I am sorry, but we have not a copy
left. I have actually given away my own! and must consult the
publishing department's file copy when I wish to look at it.
Seventy-five copies seemed an ample number&mdash;until I began to
send it out. Past and present employees of the firm mopped up such
a lot, and naturally they came first.'</p>

<p>That was in January, 1924. At Christmas of the same year came
this present copy, most beautifully bound in half morocco. In it is
written: 'To R. H. Croll. This turned up a few months ago, and I
sent it to London to be bound for you. We had many proofs of this
thing, and I am not sure that this is the final one. George
Robertson.' Surely there is nothing in Australian letters more
entertaining than this rhymed history by Henry of the House of
Angus &amp; Robertson&mdash;unless it is the series of pungent
notes and comments by George Robertson himself, printed as an
appendix to the volume. Between Henry and George, we gain an
amazingly intimate view of both.</p>

<p>Another privately-printed effort by Henry is equally racy, but
not so personal. It is titled <i>Joseph's Dream</i>&mdash;really a
paraphrase, in good (at times lurid) Australian, of the Scriptural
tale of Joseph and Potiphar's wife. Mine is only a typewritten copy
(one given me by my friend, J. K. Moir, that ardent supporter of
our local art and literature and begetter of the vigorous young
Bread and Cheese Club, of which he is Knight Grand Cheese). The
<i>Dream,</i> as interpreted by Henry, is both interesting and
amusing, and the booklet is worth having on that account.</p>

<p>When Mary Gilmore came to Melbourne in 1924, we welcomed her
warmly. I summed her up in the one fine, embracive word 'homely.'
She was unquestionably the woman of her own poem, 'Marri'd.' Bless
the boy who owns this book,' she wrote (with two following verses)
in Robin's copy of her <i>The Passionate Heart.</i> Some years
later I sent her one of my books with 'kind regards.' Back came a
copy of <i>Under the Wilgas,</i> which she had just
published&mdash;'To Robert Henderson Croll with LOVE, not miserable
kind regards.' Little wonder that, when Hugh McCrae and I called at
her flat in Darlinghurst in 1937 and Hugh hugged her in his great
arms&mdash;little wonder I, too, kissed the dear woman. This other
volume, <i>Hound of the Road,</i> is inscribed 'To that good Hound
of Many Roads (in Victoria and elsewhere), R. H. Croll, from Mary
Gilmore, Christmas, 1930.'</p>

<p>Hugh McCrae sent me the <i>Georgiana's Journal,</i> really his
grandmother's diary, annotated by him and illustrated with many
family pictures. He would not take the cheque I posted to him. I
value this volume the more because he wrote a verse in it. He began
by quoting a question from some lines I wrote on Melbourne:</p>

<p class="poem">Her league-long streets with myriad lights
agleam...<br>
Is this the 'Village' of John Batman's dream?</p>

<p>and he added two of his own:</p>

<p class="poem">Somewhere my grandam, stirring, answers Yes!<br>
Dear Crolly-boy...however did you guess?</p>

<p>My copy of Hugh's <i>Satyrs and Sunlight</i> has his 'Colombine'
written in by him&mdash;I had asked him to sign the book, and that
was the nice thing he did. His <i>Du Poissey Anecdotes</i> is also
inscribed, and so is that attractive smaller book, <i>My Father and
My Father's Friends</i>&mdash;but then, so is everything else that
is his. Richly endowed with talents, able draughtsman, still abler
writer, poet of no mean order, he has not, perhaps, made much
money, but what a wealth he has in friends, what a draft he could
draw upon the Bank of Love and Good Fellowship!</p>

<p>Another who found grain where most of us can discover only chaff
was William Moore. I have written of him earlier in this volume.
One of the ambitions of his happy-go-lucky existence was to produce
a history of Australian pictorial art. Over a space of at least
thirty years he collected facts and wrote articles relating to this
subject, and 1934 saw his dream realized in the two handsome
volumes now before me. We had been much associated, but I hardly
expected the florid inscription he wrote in Volume I: 'To Robert
Henderson Croll, author and traveller, whose association with art
culminated as Organizer of the Centenary Art Exhibition. William
George Moore, October, 1934.' (That was the year of Victoria's
Centenary. I organized the Memorial Art display.) The inscription
in Volume II has a more homely touch: 'To Bob from Bill, with happy
memories of the time when you were Manager in front of the house in
connection with the Drama Nights and saw that the critics got good
seats.'</p>

<p>Three paper-covers alongside are Bill's <i>Plays with a Local
Background, City Sketches,</i> and <i>Studio Sketches,</i> all of
them interesting.</p>

<p>Mention of my connection with the Centenary Art Exhibition
reminds me of another volume on the shelf: Russell Grimwade's
charming and useful <i>Anthography of the Eucalypts.</i> He was
Chairman of the Art Committee. I could not have wished for a more
delightful memento of a (to me) happy association than this book,
presented by the author at the end of our labours. He was good
enough to call it 'a record of a happy collaboration.'</p>

<p>One of my hobbies has been the collection of those
<i>liaison</i> between artist, author, and owner known as
bookplates or <i>ex libris.</i> I was in Sydney when the Australian
<i>Ex Libris</i> Society was formed, and Jim Tyrrell, bookseller
and knowledgeable dealer in all sorts of historical curios, found
no difficulty in inducing me to join. I have been Victorian
vice-president for many years. But long before the Society was born
I had become a collector of the dainty things. The Hon. John Lane
Mullins, who died this year (1939), gave me, I think, my first
examples: then that pleasant chap and able writer, Bertram Stevens,
presented me with his design. I began to watch for <i>ex libris</i>
as I hunted the bookshops, and so the collection grew, until to-day
there are many hundreds waiting my leisure to classify and arrange
them.</p>

<p>Neville Barnett, of Sydney, Secretary of the Society, produced
several noble volumes on this subject, each volume a credit to
Australian printing and book production. They are all here,
together with certain other bookplate works, notably those issued
by Adrian Feint and Frank Brangwyn, and Gordon Craig's
quaintly-named <i>Nothing.</i></p>

<p>That recalls that I have several bookplates of my own. John
Shirlow etched me one of a swagman, swag on back, marching towards
the sunrise and reading as he goes. He added as motto: <i>Solvitur
Ambulando.</i> That (generous old Jack!) was a gift. As etchings
are difficult to print (I know it from personal experience), I
ordered a woodcut from Philip Litchfield, of Sydney. He made a very
pleasing job of it. Next that great artist of the fantastic, Sidney
Sime, of London, presented me with a weird dragon design, a plate
of which I had cut in wood by Roy Davies, a Sydney man. I like
that, too. Benefactions, like misfortunes, never come singly: Dr.
Ernest Harden, a Polish scholar who came to me about a teaching
position when I was Registrar of the Council of Public Education,
surprised me one day by bringing in a wood-block and fifty prints
of a bookplate he had designed for me. He had cut the block
himself. This plate, by the way, is rather too big for general use.
Still another gift, again a surprise, was an etched plate by
William Hunter&mdash;it, too, with a swag motif. Varying the theme
came a drawing from, and by, Hugh McCrae&mdash;a graceful,
topsy-turvy figure which my son found pleasure in turning into a
lino-cut. Finally (well, I think so!) is a delightful pencil
drawing given me by Harold Herbert&mdash;a lovely old tree in the
foreground and, striding along the road in the middle distance, a
figure which may reasonably be myself.</p>

<p>Bless all the givers!</p>

<p>Of course, <i>Such is Life</i> is here (the original issue), and
so is the rib which was carved from its huge body: <i>Rigby's
Romance.</i> Joined up, they form Australia's most distinctively
Australian book&mdash;the Austral classic. (What a debt we owe Miss
Kate Baker for her aid in giving us that outstanding work! She
richly deserved her O.B.E.) And here, too, are Mrs. Gunn's fine
<i>We of the Never Never</i> (inscribed), E. J. Brady's very rare
<i>Earthen Floor</i> (printed at Grafton, N.S.W.), and that volume,
<i>The King's Caravan,</i> which he told me was the one book he
really enjoyed writing. It is scarce now; my copy was obtained for
me in London by Miss Helen Bailey.</p>

<p>John Shaw Neilson, most delicate of our lyrists, is well
represented. Generous Mary Gilmore sent me this page-proof copy of
his first volume, <i>Heart of Spring.</i> Its editor, A. G.
Stephens, gave it to Mary. With diffidence (and an appreciation
which warms me through and through), I quote the inscription: 'To
dear Robert Croll, who has such <i>a</i> feeling for Neilson.'
Enclosed is a holograph poem by Neilson, 'The Smoker Parrot,'
written for Mary Gilmore. I edited the Collected Edition of his
works, published by Lothian in 1934. In this copy he has made
graceful acknowledgment of my share in the production. It was an
enjoyable task, the editing and the writing of an
Introduction&mdash;surely never was a gentler being than this poet
who had lived so stern a life! Hard manual work, with its common
contacts, had not affected his naturally sensitive and refined
outlook&mdash;save, perhaps, to render him even more compassionate
of the poor. <i>The Heart of Spring</i> and his <i>Ballads and
Lyrical Poems</i> have long been out of print. Rarely indeed does a
copy turn up for sale. I count myself lucky that all his books are
here, and all inscribed.</p>

<p>This brown-covered <i>Bush,</i> by Bernard O'Dowd, once belonged
to his fellow-poet, Frank Williamson, whose <i>Purple and Gold</i>
stands alongside of it. O'Dowd and Williamson were close friends:
witness the inscription at the end of this book: 'With love,
Bernard O'Dowd, 1913.' He refers in the poem to a number of his
contemporaries and others&mdash;three of those who are named (Web
Gilbert the sculptor, John Shirlow, etcher, and Frank Williamson,
poet) have added their signatures to the little volume. Best of all
is included a letter from O'Dowd himself, and a piece of his
manuscript of the work.</p>

<p>He was attacked by some of the critics for what they regarded as
the unwarranted intrusion of persons' names. To me the 'intrusion'
does not harm the poetry, and it adds a point to the main
contention of the poem. O'Dowd laughed over some of his
difficulties in that regard. He tried, for instance, to introduce a
reference to a certain University professor standing, deservedly,
high in the public regard, but the name conjured up, irresistibly,
memories of a well-known nursery rhyme, and had eventually to be
dropped.</p>

<p>O'Dowd has been silent since 1921, when he published his <i>Alma
Venus.</i> The frontispiece is a photograph of the bronze head of
O'Dowd by Web Gilbert. It stands in the Melbourne National Gallery.
I introduced the two men. The bronze was cast at Gilbert's studio
in Gore Street, Fitzroy, where we used to gather to see him at
work&mdash;the custom was to toss pennies into the molten
bronze.</p>

<p>That recalls the coincidence that the Lotus flowered for the
first time in Victoria (so I was told at the Botanic
Gardens&mdash;it was certainly the first time there) just when Web
Gilbert needed to study a bloom for his famous bas-relief, 'The
Wheel of Life.' This depicts an aged Lama from Tibet who, after
much travail, has reached what he believes to be the River of
Peace. He sits beneath a leafy bamboo, prayer wheel and begging
bowl alongside; closing the beautifully-graduated distance are the
faintly outlined ridges of the Himalayas. A hint that the old man
is still in the grip of Destiny is conveyed by the portrayal of a
section of the mystic Wheel of Life, adorned with strange symbols.
This bas-relief was created for Dr. Springthorpe, of Melbourne, and
stood for a time as part of a memorial in the Boroondara Cemetery.
It was purchased by the Cudmore family and presented to the
Melbourne University, where it adorns the main entrance to the
Union building. By the kindness of P. R. H. St. John, the botanist,
I was able to secure for Gilbert the Lotus leaves and flowers which
he used in this sculpture&mdash;probably the finest of his many
works.</p>

<p>Some other local productions of special worth are the several
books of etchings by John Shirlow, including that scarcest of
publications, the <i>Five Etchings,</i> probably the first of its
kind in Australia. The issue was limited to 25, the price being a
guinea a volume. One was sold in recent years for twenty guineas.
Here, too, of course, are Angus &amp; Robertson's small octavo of
reproductions after Shirlow, with its dedication: 'To my friends,
Mr. and Mrs. R. H. Croll,' and the more important volume, <i>The
Etched Work of John Shirlow,</i> which came from the press of
Alexander McCubbin.</p>

<p>Two even more expensive productions are these portfolios
labelled <i>The Melbourne Set</i> and <i>The Sydney Set.</i></p>

<p>Straying into art like this reminds me of a couple of volumes on
the lower shelf. Both are sketch books used by the late Blamire
Young, and given me as mementoes by his widow. The pencil,
pen-and-ink and watercolour drawings in them are delightful. The
copy, alongside, of <i>The Art of Blamire Young</i> is inscribed
'Robin Croll, in remembrance of Blamire Young,' and I rejoice in
possessing, too, a signed copy of his play, <i>The Children's
Bread,</i> which he dedicated to that good citizen, Gregan
McMahon.</p>

<p>The industrious explorer, and world-famous botanist, Baron Von
Mueller, wrote in this copy of his <i>Select Extra-tropical
Plants</i> (purchased for one shilling in my book-hunting days), a
German inscription to Ch. Tasker and signed it on 16th October,
1889. I wish I had known the old Baron&mdash;what a great
acquisition he was to this young country. Had he recorded the
incidents of his travels as fully as he recorded his beloved
plants, he must have been acclaimed as one of the most intrepid of
our explorers. But with him the plant was the thing; the journey to
find it hardly mattered.</p>

<p>Nearby is Mrs. Langloh Parker's <i>Australian Legendary
Tales,</i> which I bought from A. G. Stephens&mdash;now a very
scarce book. This one has a letter stuck in from the author. Other
works bearing upon the aborigines are five volumes of Baldwin
Spencer, Katharine Susannah Prichard's novel <i>Coonardo</i>
(inscribed) and that capital book, <i>The Red Centre,</i> by
Finlayson, of Adelaide&mdash;a chap who did some truly amazing
journeys into the heart of Australia. He has a delightful
style.</p>

<p>But this is becoming a mere catalogue. Percival Serle's useful
compilation, <i>A Bibliography of Australasian Poetry and
Verse,</i> sits besides his well-produced <i>Song to David</i>
(Christopher Smart's) and his <i>Anthology,</i> and I should, of
course, refer specially to these signed works of Norman and Lionel
Lindsay, of Frank Wilmot, of Bertram Stevens and of Donald
Macdonald. (The veteran journalist, David Watterston, so long
connected with the <i>Argus</i> and the <i>Australasian,</i> told
me that Donald Macdonald was 'the greatest find' the Melbourne
press ever had. His graceful work put Nature-writing here (just to
mention one of his many sides) on a high plane, and set a standard
lofty indeed for his successors on the <i>Argus</i>&mdash;Alex.
Chisholm, Crosbie Morrison, and Norman McCance.) But space forbids
more than the mere naming of some of the other writers
represented&mdash;all of them recalling pleasant memories. Ambrose
Pratt, for instance, and Sir John Monash, and Frederick Chapman,
and Sydney Ure Smith, and Dr. Souter, and A. G. Stephens, and
Professor Osborne, and Louis Esson, and George Essex Evans, and
Martin Peter Hansen (my old chief when Director of Education), and
Louis Lavater, and Dave Low (the cartoonist), and that able
describer of Central Australian life, R. B. Plowman, and Ernest
Favenc, and Fred Johns (the Who's Whoist), and Elliott Napier, and
Dr. Leach and Frederick Macartney, and the productions of that
printer who loves his work and calls himself the Hawthorn Press, I
mean John Gartner, and...and...and...</p>

<p>When H. G. Wells was in Melbourne, he signed this copy of his
<i>Time Machine,</i> remarking that it was a first edition, very
limited in this form, of one of his earliest books. This
<i>Collected Poems</i> has Masefield's autograph (I spent a
pleasant hour with him that afternoon in the Centenary Art
Exhibition), and here are first editions of Kipling and Yeats and
Barrie and Oscar Wilde and others.</p>

<p>Whistler has always attracted me&mdash;though I doubt if I would
have liked to live with such a wasp! From John Shirlow's library,
when John went where all good artists go, I bought these delightful
volumes&mdash;<i>The Gentle Art of Making Enemies, Eden versus
Whistler: The Baronet and the Butterfly</i> (this is the first
printing, Paris, 1899), the <i>Whistler Journal</i> by the
Pennells, and the big <i>Life of Whistler</i> which they wrote.
Another item is <i>Writings by and about Whistler,</i> a most
attractive book produced by Don C. Seitz in Edinburgh in 1910. It
has a full account of the homeric fight between Whistler and
Sheridan Ford, the man who managed to issue the <i>Gentle Art</i>
before the artist-author could interpose. Ford evened up a good
many grievances by publishing a clever set of verses in which he
did justice to Whistler's two sides&mdash;the able artist and the
impish <i>poseur.</i> Here is a sample of his aggressive style:</p>

<p class="poem">When Jimmie sleeps beneath the daisied
sod&mdash;<br>
At peace, at last, with man if not with God,</p>

<p>but he could add, with equal justification:</p>

<p class="poem">'Twas Whistler who, with vision that
transcends,<br>
Pressed on serenely where Velasquez ends<br>
And shaped for curious Nineteenth-Century needs<br>
The colour schemes that only genius breeds,</p>

<p>with much more to the same high effect. This small volume, with
its rubricated title page and its hand-made paper, must be rather
rare. I notice the edition was limited to 350 copies.</p>

<p>But enough of books for the moment. So many personal names crowd
upon me, each connoting pleasurable memories, that I am at a loss
to know how to deal with them, for all cannot go in where space is
so restricted.</p>

<p>First, though, let me quote, and correct, a press reference to
myself. A paragraph in a Sydney weekly, after giving me (as Jael
did to Sisera) 'butter in a lordly dish,' declared that 'R. H.
Croll is about the only man in Australia who writes by Act of
Parliament, a special measure having been passed years ago for his
benefit.' With the <i>Sentimental Bloke</i> my only comment was 'I
wish't yeh meant it, Bill!' The fact was that I had to secure, by
Order in Council, exemption under certain sections of the Public
Service Act or I could not, without infringing the regulations,
have gone on writing for the press and receiving payment for my
work. So I was duly gazetted as permitted to 'contribute articles,
stories and verse to magazines and newspapers.' Later that was
enlarged to cover my broadcasting.</p>

<p>One of the very oddest of compliments anyone could have paid to
him was a dinner to which I was invited at Fasoli's on November 25,
1920. The invitation card measured about a foot by ten inches and
was addressed, cryptically, to 'R. H. Croll, R.C.P.E., V.R.O.C.,
&amp;c.' I gathered later that this described me as Registrar
Council of Public Education, Very Rare Old Cock, &amp;c. As usual,
Garry Roberts was the begetter of this freak banquet, at which I
had to take the chair and propose the toast of my own health, to
which he responded. The card is signed by Bernard O'Dowd, Reg. S.
Ellery, W. A. Shum, G. M. Prendergast, Charles Croll, Guy Innes,
Garry Roberts, his son Bert, John Shirlow and his son Ted, Heber
Green, M. J. McNally, Tom Landy, G. Ampt, E. Wilson Dobbs, Phil. D.
Flower, T. Geo. Ellery, P. C. Clements, A. S. Howcroft, Percival
Serle, W. Webster, E. H. Sutton, and Gilbert Wallace. I prize it as
a memento of one of the happiest of nights.</p>

<p>Still harping on that subject so dear to most of us&mdash;one's
self, here is a set of verses sent to me by poor old Frank
Williamson from a country school (Tragowel) in December, 1911, as a
kind of Christmas greeting:</p>

<p class="poem">What shall I wish you Robbie Croll&mdash;<br>
A girl, a book, or wine?<br>
For sages tell, who these control<br>
Shall taste of the divine.<br>
<br>
A star-eyed girl&mdash;a mouth of rose<br>
To kiss and cling and sigh,<br>
The houri Moslem heaven bestows<br>
When true believers die?<br>
<br>
A book of song, of youth and love,<br>
And joy refined by pain&mdash;<br>
That breathes of beauty gone above<br>
Ere Time could Love arraign?<br>
<br>
Or purple wine that holds the fire<br>
Flung by enamoured suns,<br>
That thrills the blood, and stirs the lyre,<br>
And sybils makes of nuns?<br>
<br>
Yea, take them all, the book and girl&mdash;<br>
But stint the luring cup,<br>
For there, like Cleopatra's pearl,<br>
My soul has shrivelled up.</p>

<p>The personality of the artist, and particularly the literary
artist, has always been an interesting study to me. Oscar Wilde has
said that all Art is betrayal. Well, if the artist cannot help
exposing himself in work done for the public gaze, how much more
must he do so in letters to intimates.</p>

<p>Some are quoted in the next chapter. But before we come to it I
want to give here, at the risk of some little repetition, an
article which the <i>Argus</i> printed in August, 1933, for it
summarizes a happy section of my life. I called it&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:25%">GOOD-BYE, SUNNYSIDE!</p>

<p style="margin-left:25%"><i>Bright blaze the stars, the night is
dark<br>
As down the roads of heaven they ride,<br>
How could they our small planet mark<br>
If 'twere not for its Sunny Side?</i>
</p>

<p class="newspaper">It is a long, steady rise from Belgrave to
Kallista, and twenty years ago the road was rough and stony. The
two city artists who were with me had found the walk rather far. As
we rose to the crest, topped now by the Kallista School, the
water-colourist sighed, drew his hands from his trouser
pockets&mdash;he always strolled with his arms buried to the
wrists&mdash;and looked at me reproachfully. 'Someone has stolen
the end of this road,' he remarked with conviction. Five minutes
later his back straightened, his eye brightened, he was a different
man; we were facing that wonderful view which is framed by the soft
green hills of Sassafras and Olinda. 'Why didn't I bring my
paints?' he asked. But he, as many another of equal skill, was to
'bring his paints' on plenty of other occasions, for the home we
were about to visit was famous for its hospitality. Many of the
choicest spirits of Melbourne's world of art and letters made the
well-named Sunnyside a meeting place, at week-ends, and, like Toby
Belch and his merry company, they frequently 'roused the night-owl
in a catch.'<br>
<br>
The house stands on a hillside which slopes to the creek at
Begley's Bridge. The rich soil has a number of granite boulders
scattered through it, and from one of these, about three feet high,
swelling up near the front verandah, each guest, if he stayed
overnight, was expected to deliver an oration. They were memorable
evenings. No motor cars in those earlier days flashed along the
uneven roadway far below to remind us of city noise and city cares;
our hilltop was a world apart, dedicated to us and to us only. In
every pause we would be aware of the solemn night all about us, of
the scent of musk and mint-bush and eucalypt, of the never-pausing
murmur of the little creek, hurrying, always hurrying. But pauses
were few in such company. Here it was that C. J. Dennis wrote much
of his <i>Sentimental Bloke</i> and it was to his host and hostess,
Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Roberts, that he dedicated that highly
successful book. Mr. Roberts had been manager of the cable system
of the Melbourne Tramway Company. Several of the ancient 'buses,
withdrawn and sold by the company as trams superseded them,
stood&mdash;they still stand&mdash;in favoured spots in the garden.
They made capital bedrooms, as we found on occasion. In one of
these 'Den' camped, and in it he composed much of his verse of that
period.<br>
<br>
We made a rally, a sort of house-warming, when he was installed.
Each contributed a small picture or a text to hang along the line
where, in the 'bus's live days, advertisements used to be placed.
The result was a truly remarkable collection of cards, mainly
figuring beautiful ladies, and of mottoes containing more advice,
direct and oblique, than any man could take in a single lifetime.
One of the cryptic utterances which I recall was the warning,
worthy of a new Delphic oracle, that a 'motor-car is not fit to be
out of!' We sang at nights ancient songs like 'Samuel Hall' and 'O
Landlord, have you any fine wine?' but with verses made on the spot
to supplant the extremely frank statements of the original makers
of those delectable ballads. Dennis was particularly good at
improvisation. A lady visitor declared that she had milked the cow
that morning. The usual scepticism was expressed. 'Den' at once
summed up the matter in a set of neat verses.<br>
<br>
That likeable genius, the sculptor Web Gilbert, was a frequent
visitor, and so were two of his art associates, John Shirlow, best
known then as an etcher, and the late Alick McClintock, the
water-colourist. Clad in a white sweater and wrapped closely in a
snowy sheet of linen, I was posed one day in the garden as a wood
god, alleged to be a creation of Web Gilbert's. The photograph
shows him finishing off this marble statue, his implements being a
garden hoe as a chisel and a wooden block used in rope quoits,
grasped by its pin, as a mallet. It was McClintock who thanked God
he had brought his liver with him when, on one occasion, he drove
down that stony road in a rattling cart.<br>
<br>
Most of the jokes originated in the fertile brain of our host,
whose wit never flagged, whose invention was never at a loss. The
late George Ellery, town clerk of the City of Melbourne, the editor
of a Melbourne daily newspaper, and I were luxuriating in our beds
one Sunday morning, having been forbidden to rise early, when Mr.
Roberts appeared, attired in an old tail-coat, with towel on arm,
as a broken-down waiter. He served me respectfully and passed into
the room of the editor. Decorous murmurings ensued. Then suddenly
the pseudo-waiter reappeared in a hurry, accompanied by a burst of
threatening language from the newspaper man. With very
un-waiterlike joy Mr. Roberts explained that he had offered the
editor a sausage wrapped in a sheet of his journal. 'Well?' said I.
'Well,' replied our host, 'I told him that I had found something
good in his paper at last!' There exists somewhere a remarkable
caricature of Mr. Roberts in that waiter costume. It was done by
David Low, now one of the foremost cartoonists of the
English-speaking world. He and Hal Gye, who illustrated <i>The
Sentimental Bloke,</i> were often at Sunnyside.<br>
<br>
Here, too, M. J. McNally, artist in narrative as in pigment, told
some of his finest stories; here, on the friendliest of footings,
were men such as the late 'Dave' Wright, known to the frequenters
of Fasoli's as 'the man of memory,' and the late Tom
Roberts&mdash;he did a fine portrait in oils of his namesake.
Harold Herbert, who has since recorded so many lovely scenes, has
stood on the verandah to admire the Sunnyside view; that great
annalist, E. Wilson Dobbs, contributed erudition to the gathering;
Hugh Wright, of the Mitchell Library, Sydney, never failed to
include Kallista as a place of call when visiting Victoria; but it
is not possible to chronicle all. One name, however, must not be
omitted. Mrs. Aeneas Gunn, author of those two classics of the
inland <i>A Little Black Princess</i> and <i>We of the Never
Never,</i> was often an honoured guest, coming up from Monbulk, the
village of which, it is hoped, she will write the history some
day.<br>
<br>
But Sunnyside was centre of a wider circle. Its owner boasted that
he was born near Scarsdale, and he was one of the prime movers in
that staunch body, the Old Boys of Scarsdale, whose crest is a
he-goat and whose motto <i>Non extincti sumus.</i> It was fitting
that men born in a goldfield town should so honour their boyhood
friend and enemy, the goat. Roberts wrote histories of the early
times of his birthplace and its neighbourhood, and conducted a wide
correspondence which embraced the late Fred Johns, of <i>Who's Who
in Australia,</i> Adelaide, and many a London friend, including
Colonel Arthur Lynch, soldier, author and Parliamentarian. Friends,
humble or famous, were all welcome to this house in the hills, and
when the fame of Mr. Roberts's collections of books on many
subjects, notably on the foundation of the Australian Commonwealth,
was noised abroad, visitors came even from overseas to Sunnyside to
inspect and be charmed.<br>
<br>
But to-day Sunnyside is empty. 'Garry' Roberts&mdash;to how many
was he 'Garry'&mdash;is dead, and Mrs. Roberts has left the old
place. The shell of the hospitable home stands waiting a new spirit
to quicken it to life again. Farewell, Sunnyside!</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. 'PARLEYINGS WITH
CERTAIN PEOPLE OF IMPORTANCE'</h2>

<p>I stole or lifted ('convey, the wise it call') that
chapter-heading from Browning. It seems a suitable line with which
to introduce some traffic I have had, by correspondence, with a few
of the notables of the earth.</p>

<p>But the first letter I pick up was not to my address at all. It
is a tiny note written by Robert Louis Stevenson in Samoa, a pencil
invitation to R. Hetherington-Carruthers, who was Stevenson's old
solicitor. It is characteristic:</p>

<pre>
<b>Ave,
    gratias,
         Accipe
R.
   L.
      S.
Hail
    Thanks
        Catch!
             And come! R.L.S.</b>
</pre>

<p>The middle R.L.S. is in printed characters, the final is a
flowing signature. This came to me from W. Farmer Whyte when he was
in Apia collaborating with H. J. Moors in a book on Stevenson.</p>

<p>A Kipling note holds a piece of good advice. It was written at
Bateman's Bush, Burwash, Sussex, on May 7, 1928:</p>

<p class="letter">DEAR MR. CROLL,<br>
<br>
Ever so many thanks for sending me your <i>Open Road in
Victoria,</i> which ought to be most useful and, I should think,
was the first work of its kind with you. I like the detail of
it.<br>
<br>
My Melbourne of the old days wasn't yours, but I remember one
wonderful walk in what I suppose are now suburbs.<br>
<br>
Only, <i>please</i> put a map into it, the next edition. One can
get lost quicker on a walking tour than any other way.<br>
<br>
Very sincerely,<br>
<br>
RUDYARD KIPLING.</p>

<p>Masefield also makes pleasant reference to this book, and so
does the octogenarian novelist, Morley Roberts, who roughed it in
Australia as swagman seeking jobs many years ago. His old cobber of
those days, A. J. Sullivan, also over eighty years of course, is
still alert physically and mentally and may be seen at every
literary gathering, as well as every sports meeting, in this city
of Melbourne or its suburbs. One thing struck Morley Roberts as
surprising when reading the <i>Open Road</i>&mdash;'It is the
luxury you hikers live in! A roll of blankets with a spare shirt
and socks (or toe-rags!), a bag of sugar, a bag of tea and one of
flour, and at odd times meat, and a billy, was all I carried when
on the wallaby track...I advise all to carry a few matches in a
water-tight case or a bottle in case of wet weather...I don't know
if you have ever seen my <i>Land Travel and Sea-Faring,</i> some of
it about Australia. A good book in parts, or so I think...'</p>

<p>I had asked that master of the grotesque in art, Sidney H. Sime,
if he had published a volume of his quaint work. He replied that he
had not, and very generously he sent along a book of <i>Bogey
Beasts</i> for which he had drawn the pictures. I had long admired
his illustrations to Lord Dunsany's tales and other men's writings
in the now defunct <i>Idler</i> (Jerome K. Jerome's journal), the
<i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> and many another periodical. Presently I
bought from him, for our National Gallery, a print of his
remarkable etching 'The Gate of Heaven.' I had noted his address as
'Old Crown Inn, Worplesdon, Surrey' and had asked if that were his
fixed abode. 'It is my permanent abode,' he replied. 'I bought an
ancient tavern which had lost its licence and turned it into a
sufficient den for my needs. It is a ramshackle affair dating from
Elizabethan times and shakes in a high wind like an old man with a
palsy&mdash;but the timbers are sound, being old ship ribs, hard as
ebony and as black; with the marks of the adze all over them. My
studio is now what was the stabling. Of course it is a come-down
for the poor old thing; but the licence, the vital spark, has gone:
so I feel no compunctious visitings of remorse. Besides, I've
retained some vestiges of vitality in the cellar.'</p>

<p>John Foster Fraser, the much travelled and the very much
criticized for his statements regarding the many countries he wrote
about, has this to say about his book on Australia: 'I gather from
the newspapers that I am blind as a bat, prejudiced,
ignorant&mdash;and they ought to know. Personally, I thought the
book was favourable to Australia, but that shows what a dullard I
am.</p>

<p>'And publishers continue to woo me with filthy lucre to write
other books about other places. I've one on the stocks and another
arranged&mdash;which is striking testimony to the accuracy of some
Australians that English folk are fools..."Hold on tight round the
curve"&mdash;by the way, I wonder whether I picked that expression
up in Melbourne or Sydney?...Has Flinders Street station been razed
to the ground yet? Somebody told me it is of fire-proof brick. What
a pity!'</p>

<p>I have a photo. somewhere of Henry Lawson standing with that
great journalist, the founder of the Sydney <i>Bulletin,</i> J. F.
Archibald. It is signed by Henry. Here is a letter from Archibald
given me by Mrs. Baverstock (one of David Blair's daughters) who
for a time wrote much of the women's stuff in the 'Bully.' The note
is dated October 18, 1906, just when Archibald's dream of the
<i>Lone Hand</i> monthly was about to come true. 'I am absolutely
burning to skite to you about our new magazine, which is to be the
biggest thing in all the world (Baal gammon!). England and America
export mags. to Australia by the shipload: I am going to see
whether the compliment can't be returned with compound interest. We
mean to start by printing 50,000 at a shilling and selling 'em
out&mdash;and you'll be invited to the christening, which will be
about January.'</p>

<p>In a postscript he added 'I am going to write the genesis of the
<i>Bulletin</i> in the mag., and have been offered £1,000 for the
book it will make.'</p>

<p>Poor Archibald; very soon after that his mind began to fail and,
with his withdrawal, the driving force behind the new venture
weakened so considerably that, as we all know, the <i>Lone Hand</i>
passed, as so many other Australian periodicals have done...and
will continue to do, so long as Australia allows herself to be
flooded by thousands of cheap (and generally nasty) publications
from abroad.</p>

<p>Archibald was (in Furphy's phrase) offensively Australian. One
of his sayings always amuses me in remembrance: 'I have nothing
against Oxford men. Some of our best shearers' cooks are Oxford
men.'</p>

<p>I find it hard to refrain from quoting the pleasant things said
about my first book by (amongst others) Sir John Quick, Sir John
Monash, Theodore Fink, Frank Tate and Bernard O'Dowd, but this from
the poet J. Le Gay Brereton must go in, for other reasons than
vanity. I had never met Brereton. This is what he wrote, dating it
from the University of Sydney, 30/8/28:</p>

<p class="letter">MY DEAR CROLL,<br>
<br>
I feel no more inclined to call you mister than if you were the
wallaby that Shaw Neilson saw drinking. I have lazily opened your
book here and there, as at a campfire, and strolled with you in
beautiful places, glad of the fresh open air and of the wafts of
literary allusion, happy to be reminded of the absorbently taciturn
R. H. Long, whom I always remember with pleasure, and sorry only
because I am never likely to see with the eyes of sense most of the
scenes which you describe. I've got into the way of going regularly
to a place where hills and a fresh river and loneliness have a
varying charm each time I contrive to break from my
'chair'&mdash;'O word of fear, unpleasing to a wanderer's
ear'...</p>

<p>Of making many letters there is no end. A number is here from
that versatile artist Blamire Young. Most are intimate to an extent
that robs them of general interest&mdash;but here's a little bit I
may risk. We used to write nonsense verses to one another&mdash;'I
made this limerick lately,' he wrote&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">A mad little maid is Rose Madder,<br>
As bad as they make 'em and badder.<br>
At her window one night<br>
Was the scandalous sight<br>
Of a lad and, God help us, a ladder.</p>

<p>Some friendly words from Hans Heysen (Ambleside, South
Australia), one of the most famous of our painters, sum up his
views on a subject much debated in artist circles to-day: 'Of
course no artist is every really satisfied with his productions
when he compares them with Nature's wonders and marvellous finish.
At the same time he is thankful for being able to "capture" as much
as he does...An artist's ambition is to "copy" nature as truthfully
as is within his power&mdash;the other qualities that enter into
his production are the unconscious results of his own
character...One thing no one can deny and that is that Nature is
the Fountain head of everything that is to make a lasting appeal to
mankind.'</p>

<p>As a gloss upon that may I mention that one of our 'modernists'
assured me lately that 'Art and Nature have no connection.'</p>

<p>Here is another note from an artist&mdash;that most generous of
men, Harold Herbert, whose friendship I value so much. I bought a
picture from him in his early days when his prices were low. This
letter returned me my cheque with some humorous comments about his
inability to induce a bank to recognize it. In paying it to him I
had remarked that people had been known to get quite good money for
my cheques; he sent the thing back with the retort that he was not
one of the lucky ones. Little wonder! Artist-like he had carried
the cheque about until, when he did remember to pay it in, the
corner, with about half my signature, had been worn off! I like
optimism!</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth recalling that Dave Low, to-day London's
most brilliant cartoonist, owed at least some of his world fame to
his loving studies of the then Prime Minister, William Morris
Hughes. (By the way, I have twice been charged, lately, with being
Mr. Hughes. One of my accosters was a swagman in Bourke Street, who
wanted to profit by the fact that 'I've often been at your place at
Sassafras, Mr. Hughes'; the other was an old woman in Flinders
Street who declared that 'you always buy your matches from me, Mr.
Hughes.' Hughes is not exactly a sculptor's model!...I could have
borne those assaults better if I had not been taken, still more
recently, for Mr. Harold Clapp, Chairman of the Railways
Commissioners!...Worst of all, a little boy friend of mine saw
Mahatma Ghandi on the moving pictures 'Mitter Croll,' he
exclaimed...I am beginning to suspect the motive of the several
artists who have made portraits of me&mdash;F. G. Reynolds, John
Shirlow, Sybil Craig, Dave Low and Will Rowell amongst them.
Apparently, as Hughes said in similar circumstances, what I need is
not justice, but mercy! The Rowell portrait has, however, been
bought by the Castlemaine Art Gallery.)</p>

<p>Well, harking back to Low. His famous cartoon 'Speak to him in
Welsh, David' appeared in the <i>Bulletin,</i> and Minogue of the
Treasury, aware that I knew the artist, wrote me at once about
securing the original for Sir Frank Clarke. Low replied: 'I wrote
to the <i>Bulletin</i> to reserve the cartoon for Frank Clarke (who
has, I notice, resigned from something or other&mdash;probably out
of sheer disappointment) but Munro-Ferguson [then Governor-General]
was first, with a telegram, and he is now the unhappy
possessor...If Frank Clarke would like a replica I can do him one
for ten guineas. You are on one (1) cigar in silver paper if you
can manage to bring this under his notice with results. Yours was
one of six letters I received about that drawing. What's the matter
with the public?'</p>

<p>Munro-Ferguson presented the drawing to the Federal Parliament.
It may be seen at Canberra.</p>

<p>The menu card of the dinner we gave Low at the Grand Hotel in
July, 1919, just prior to his leaving for London, has a design by
Charles Nuttall (dead, now, worse luck!) showing Dave pulling the
strings of a puppet which bears a strong resemblance to W. M.
Hughes. This copy bears the signatures of Low and Nuttall and,
amongst many others of the guests, those of Dave Dow, John Shirlow,
Garry Roberts, Brendon Doyle, Hal Gye, Guy Innes, Edward Dyson, H.
H. Champion, Heber Green, Harrison Owen, H. Lamond and Harry
McClelland.</p>

<p>(It was H. H. Champion, by the way, who made the famous
statement that the Labour Party of his day was 'an army of lions
led by asses.')</p>

<p>Mention of Innes reminds me of much pleasant association. When
he resigned the editorship of the Melbourne <i>Herald</i> and went
to London he illuminated his correspondence by enclosing autographs
of the interesting folk he was meeting. A menu of a dinner given to
the Press Conference in 1924 is adorned by the signature of Tim
Healy, then Governor-General of the Irish Free State. The cover
design is a delightful attempt by Low to picture 'overseas editors
wondering whether their digestions are equal to Welsh rare-bit.'
The editors sit at a long dining table; on the plate of each is a
tiny figure of Lloyd George gesticulating and posturing in a score
of different ways as he delivers one of his wild orations.</p>

<p>With Professor Wood Jones (of the University) and Dr. C. H.
Kellaway (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute) I stood one year for
election to the Committee of the Zoological and Acclimatization
Society. We were badly beaten, the members showing plainly that
they preferred to retain the old Councillors (I use 'old' with its
fullest implications) to outstanding scientists like Wood Jones and
Kellaway. We were concerned with the fact that David Fleay, a
Bachelor of Science and a most amazing man with animals (almost a
second Mowgli) I have ever met, was complaining (it seemed with
good cause) that the Zoo's Australian section, which he had created
and was in charge of, was being badly subordinated to the other
sections. So, believing that the Australian section should be
easily the foremost in any Australian Zoo, and hoping to put new
and vigorous blood into an institution which, as the president told
me, sometimes had as few as five persons at an annual meeting, we
allowed ourselves to be nominated.</p>

<p>But we found that this was no ordinary annual meeting. Dozens of
new members had joined quite suddenly, subscribers whose interest
in the past had ceased with the paying of their fees were quickened
all at once into a desire to vote (that is vote against us) and the
customarily neglected gathering swelled to such a size that the
committee, having somehow sensed that this would happen, had
prepared the rotunda as a meeting place, the usual one being too
small.</p>

<p>Instead of some five votes being cast, the old members whose
term had expired and who stood for re-election, scored a solid
block apiece of some (I forget the exact figures, say) 130, while
of the three rejects Wood Jones had about 30, Kellaway a few less,
and I a few less than his. One amusing outcome of the affair was
the discovery that the whole committee, as it stood, was illegally
elected! As the method adopted had been followed in good faith for
many years, and as no one had been harmed, the Government validated
the action. Since then the Zoological Garden has been taken over by
the State and the bone of contention has become the Director of the
Sir Colin Mackenzie Sanctuary at Badger Creek. He has made this
probably the most popular resort in Victoria.</p>

<p>When Wood Jones decided to resign from the trusteeship of the
National Gallery (he was Chairman of the Museum Committee) I
implored him not to. It was a matter of principle. Here is his
reply: 'Unfortunately, Mr. Croll, I have a soul.'</p>

<p>Just one extract from William Moore's many letters. He had just
returned from England, had married Dora Wilcox, the poet, and they
had settled in Manly. I spoke of the Sime bookplate I use: 'It is a
great thing to have a bookplate by Sime, the weird and imaginative
artist. I always remember his 'Fabulous Animals' in <i>The
Sketch;</i> one was called the Gazook...At the London Sketch Club
one evening I said to a member "Where's Sime?" "Oh, keeping a pub
in the country," said he.' This is evidently a reference to the Old
Crown Inn, Worplesdon&mdash;see earlier in this chapter.</p>

<p>A letter from 'Kodak' O'Ferrall (christened Ernest, but known to
his intimates as Bob) tells of his starting work on the
<i>Bulletin.</i> That was December, 1907. He was the quaintest of
humourists&mdash;his early death was a great blow. Oddly enough,
his first job on the <i>Bulletin</i> was assistant to Prior, the
financial editor. Bob was a treasury of the unexpected. One day as
we rowed down the Yarra he suddenly leaned forward and
remarked:</p>

<p class="poem">A cold grey wind blows out of the north<br>
And the ghosts walk hand in hand,<br>
And the Argus arises in holy wrath,<br>
And is hard to understand!</p>

<p>What does it mean? Nothing, of course. But...</p>

<p>Poor Bob. Most popular of journalists, he was buried in Waverley
Cemetery with only his family present. But as they turned away from
the filling grave, a great group of 'mourners,' from the newspaper
offices and the studios, came into view. They had been delayed by
sundry drinks on the road. 'He's beaten us to it,' hiccuped the
leader. 'Good old Kodak! Wouldn't he have enjoyed this!'</p>

<p>Which recalls the funeral of a prominent Victorian artist and
one of his old cobbers (it was a very hot day) envying Mac 'in his
nice cool coffin!'</p>

<p>By the way, Kodak's grandfather, John Brophy, so Kodak's mother
told him, was the boy employed by John Pascoe Fawkner to help him
print the Port Phillip <i>Gazette.</i> I recall a watercolour by
Blamire Young in which a lad is shown working a hand press with
Fawkner&mdash;presumably the old press now in the Melbourne Public
Library.</p>

<p>Priceless (in the colloquial sense of that word) amongst these
gatherings is 'Australia,' a (let us call it) poem 'written by
Edmund Gerald FitzGibbon and dedicated to the Honourable Sir James
MacBain, K.C.M.G., President of the Legislative Council of
Victoria, and of the Centennial International Exhibition,
Melbourne, 1888.' It is a broadsheet (printed both sides, for it
runs to seven bad verses) and it is inscribed 'With compliments
from E. G. FitzGibbon.' He was town clerk of Melbourne and claimed
to be, if I remember aright, the White Knight of Kerry. His
successor in the Melbourne office, the late George Ellery, gave me
this document and adorned it with pencilled comments of a most
vigorous nature. I cannot well quote them here, but the verses
deserve them all.</p>

<p class="poem">Australia, great plenteous land,<br>
Where youthful, vig'rous States expand;<br>
Freedom and monarchy consort,<br>
And labour alternates with sport,<br>
In smoother verse to sing your fame<br>
I'll change one letter in your name:<br>
I'll turn the final 'a' to 'e',<br>
And fondly call you Australie!</p>

<p>Like so many better poets he could not find a rhyme for
'Australia' so he dodged the issue by inventing a new name for our
country. His statue stands in St. Kilda Road...but not on account
of his poetry!</p>

<p>Talking of poets, here is a verse I have just come across by the
accomplished New Zealander, Herbert Church, whom I have mentioned
earlier. He professed, with a smile, that it was one Martial's
epigrams:</p>

<p class="poem">'We marvel,' said the Parcae, 'where old Croll<br>
Is going to for aye.'<br>
(Doubtless he gave them furiously to think.)<br>
Survivors said, in speech of common day,<br>
Where'er he is he will not vex his soul<br>
If he has pen and ink.'</p>

<p>(The Parcae, of course, are the Fates.)</p>

<p>I was appointed Publicity Officer for the celebration of the
Jubilee (1872-1922) of free education in Victoria. The circulars I
sent out to writers and others brought some interesting replies. I
wanted articles or verse from any who had been helped by State
systems of education in Australia. A good many sent contributions;
others explanatory letters. 'I have just tried the
water-waggon&mdash;a most damnable vehicle, fit only to convey
wowsers to the rubbish tip'&mdash;so one of my poet friends, but he
enclosed what I needed. I have preserved the replies, including a
telegram from Henry Lawson: 'Glad to supply something for your
jubilee. When do you require copy?' That was dated August 31; Henry
died on September 2.</p>

<p>My reward for serving the Australian Academy of Art during the
three troublous (my oath! they were troublous) years of its
beginnings, three years of hard labour for which I asked no
payment, my reward is before me in the shape of a pleasant letter
of thanks from the Council, the signatures being those of Sir John
Longstaff (President), Sydney Ure Smith (Vice-President), Will
Rowell, W. B. McInnes, Harold B. Herbert, Norman Carter, Thea
Proctor, Elioth Gruner, Lionel Lindsay and Hans Heysen&mdash;all of
them artists of distinction. A personal gift of a fine drawing came
also from Hans Heysen.</p>

<p>So rich in good matter have been the letters of Hugh McCrae, and
so full of attractive drawings, that it seemed the act of a vandal
to destroy any. So they have gone into a folder, now before me.
Here are a few crumbs from this well-furnished table:</p>

<p class="newspaper">'A poet's at his best dead drunk:<br>
So here's a go!' smooth Flaccus said.<br>
A half-truth on the edge of bunk&mdash;<br>
A poet's best when he is dead!<br>
<br>
'Chris Brennan has gone. A man so deep-rooted in the world couldn't
die easily. From desolate lodgings he was carried to the hospital
where he denied himself to his friends; asked for a priest;
confessed his sins; took the crucifix in his hands...and
expired.<br>
<br>
'Some people are hushing up the story: but I don't think they have
understood Chris, or will ever understand this last most natural
act. An inadequate lament has appeared in the <i>Herald</i>&mdash;a
splinter of sugar where one had a right to expect a pillar of
rock.<br>
<br>
<i>'Tell Bernard O'Dowd.</i><br>
<br>
'I loved Chris. To hear him&mdash;as I did&mdash;declaim part of a
Greek ode <i>ore rotundo,</i> in a street off Elizabeth Bay...the
wind twisting his clothes about his body...and without any previous
salute when I turned the corner: was to take to myself a treasure
for life.'</p>

<p>And here is a postscript (headed 'To-morrow,' by the way) to
that same letter:</p>

<p class="newspaper">'As if to give my feelings an upward flourish
my grandchild, Rosemary Cowper, and her mother arrived.<br>
<br>
'Every child in the neighbourhood, every dog, every cat, every fly,
every duck, every mouse, every cow, every horse has assembled to
see the sight. The flowers in the garden have been smashed to
confetti by the mob trying to touch the hem of Miss Cowper's
sanctified garments.<br>
<br>
'Her mama sits aloof&mdash;calm&mdash;full of
mother-consciousness.'<br>
<br>
'How Neilson can write! The other evening I had to talk to the
Fellowship about John Le Gay Brereton; and I finished up by
reciting "The Heart of Spring," a poem which my wife and I have
said to one another ever since it was first printed in <i>The
Bookfellow:</i> also<br>
<br>
...it is a merry morn<br>
The glittering bird has danced into a tree...<br>
<br>
Could Chaucer or Wordsworth have imagined better?'<br>
<br>
'Last week, on a visit to town, I called on Norman Lindsay, now the
occupant of a flat in Bridge Street. He didn't answer my first
knock; but, when I whistled, hurried to meet me. In his rooms, he
was so merry he bounced up and down like a tennis ball and at last
landed on a chair, Turkish-fashion, with both hands in his lap...I
hadn't seen him for years; but could find no change except that his
hair had become grey. While he spoke, his body play-acted his
emotions...and I felt as if he were the only creature I cared for
in the world. At last, when the lights came on, I left him seated
before a table with a drawing cocked up on a couple of books...the
usual garland-design of naked girls, with a satyr in the
midst!...Seeing him was like the realization of a dream of
youth...my own youth. I wanted to ride a horse, to shoot, to
wrestle, to swim, to sail a ship to Treasure Island...instead of
which I bought a second-class ticket to Wahroonga, and read
'orrible tragedies in the newspaper all the way up.'</p>

<p>I sent him Frank Wilmot's <i>Melbourne Odes:</i></p>

<p class="newspaper">'Your unheralded gift filled me with joy. I
loved every bit of it and wound up my speech on Tuesday
afternoon&mdash;Authors' Week&mdash;with an excerpt from "Victoria

especially when he writes about foodstuffs, and so on. It is that
the stomach has no past or future...'<br>
<br>
'What old saying of what old man in what old book comes into my
head. "I pray you weep not while I'm alive and I will give you
leave to laugh when I am dead"?' And, in the same letter, a sad
one, he quotes:<br>
<br>
We're all deluded, vainly searching ways<br>
To make us happy by the length of days;<br>
For, cunningly, to make's protract this breath,<br>
The gods conceal the happiness of death.</p>

<p>And here is a poem&mdash;'for R.H.C.'</p>

<p style="margin-left:25%">STRATEGY<br>
<br>
(For R.H.C.)</p>

<p class="newspaper">He, though immortal, mortal pleasure
takes;<br>
Hollas a song; or, prickt by thorny love,<br>

Who, 'ware of him, straightway appears a dove.<br>

<i>He</i> towers as an hawk; <i>she</i> drops from high<br>
<br>
To earth; whence, freshly dight, she hurries forth,<br>

<p>Mention has been made of the fact that I edited the <i>Collected
Poems of John Shaw Neilson</i>. Long before that we had
corresponded, although his sight had become so weak that writing
was very difficult for him. This sweet singer of moving lyrics
could be humorous on occasion. I find in a letter from Merbein in
1928 some limericks I had provoked by a challenge to produce things
of the kind. His headings are particularly delightful:</p>

<p class="poem">PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE OF FOOD VALUES<br>
<br>
An up-to-date doctor of Tamworth<br>
Was asked what he thought turnip jam worth.<br>
As he felt rather tired<br>
He politely inquired:<br>
What would you consider a damn worth?<br>
<br>
REMARKABLE CLARITY OF EXPRESSION<br>
<br>
A lecturer whom we love dearly<br>
Was stung by some bees most severely.<br>
Did he swear or get narked?<br>
Not at all&mdash;he remarked:<br>
They express themselves rather too clearly.<br>
<br>
MAKING CHURCH SERVICES ATTRACTIVE<br>
<br>
There was once an old Bishop named Gault,<br>
Solemnity was his one fault.<br>
So he screwed up a smile,<br>
And he hopped down the aisle,<br>
Then he turned a profound somersault.<br>
<br>
THE CRITIC AFTER DEATH<br>
<br>
A savage old critic named Byer,<br>
Renowned for his gloom and his ire,<br>
When to Hell he went down<br>
He arrived with a frown<br>
And began to belittle the fire.</p>

<p>When there is so much beautiful thought in these letters it is
perhaps unfair to quote only a light interlude like that. Here, by
the way, also in 1928, Neilson makes an appeal for the financial
recognition of that fine art critic, A. G. Stephens, either by
public subscription, or by State or Federal grant. He claimed,
rightly, that Stephens had done an outstanding job to benefit art
and letters in Australia and now he needed assistance. In this,
Neilson forestalled our idea, ten years later, to honour A.G.S.
Meanwhile Stephens had died. Neither effort was
successful&mdash;ours was to have been posthumous honour; Neilson's
was to have helped the living man.</p>

<p>So much must be omitted...a few of the autographs may be
mentioned, though; mainly attached to pleasant letters, but
some...well, just autographs. Dr. Thomas Wood wrote, in
<i>Cobbers,</i> perhaps the best book on Australia by an outsider,
and Francis Ratcliffe's <i>Flying Fox and Drifting Sand</i> is a
good second&mdash;here are letters from each. Writers, I think,
predominate in the very mixed salad: Arthur Adams (poet and
novelist), for instance, and Roy Bridges (novelist), and Randolph
Bedford (novelist mainly), and Louis Becke (South Sea yarn
spinner), and J. H. Curle (the Marco Polo of his day) and Zora
Cross (poet) and Edward Dyson (all-rounder) and Ambrose Pratt
(romancer, historian, biographer) and Lord Dunsany (most
imaginative of story spinners and playwrights&mdash;I particularly
love his Irish tales) and Philip Gibbs (of international fame) and
versatile Montague Grover, and our finest essayist, Walter Murdoch,
whose writings as 'Elzevir' meant so much to the <i>Argus</i> at
one time, and Vance Palmer (novelist) and his equally-famous wife,
Nettie, and Sir John Quick, who originated the idea of a great
bio-biblio-graphical work, but died before he could complete it. A
work suggested by him, also dealing with Australian literature, but
diverging widely from Sir John's design, has been prepared by
Professor Morris Miller and should issue from the Melbourne
University Press this year (1939). And there are dozens more from
the followers of the inky way, while those from artists are like
Gilbert's Bishops, who, 'in their shovel hats, were plentiful as
tabby cats.' Other interests, too, are well
represented&mdash;General Birdwood of Anzac fame, Baden-Powell of
the Scouts, 'Snowy' Baker (boxer), Frederick Chapman
(palaeontologist), Peter Dawson (singer), Sinclair Lewis
(novelist), Sir Oliver Lodge (scientist), Sir John Longstaff and
Lionel Lindsay (artists), Dame Nellie Melba (singer), Bertram
Mackennal (sculptor), R. G. Menzies (Prime Minister), Dr. William
Maloney (politician and friend of all the world), Herbert Sutcliffe
(international cricketer), Lord Stonehaven (Governor-General),
Donald Thomson (anthropologist)&mdash;these represent something of
the variety, but do not suggest the number.</p>

<p>By the way, there is one good book going to waste in Australia
for the sole reason that it remains in the mind of a certain
citizen&mdash;it has yet to be produced. Its title should be
<i>Memoirs of the Honorable Theodore Fink.</i></p>

<p>It was in a queer conjunction that I first came to know that
many-faceted citizen, Theodore Fink. It might easily have been on
his art side, or his legal side, or his political side, or his
literary side, or in some other of the more obvious of his many
activities. But it was not any of these. Henry Amos (afterwards
Comptroller of Stamps, then a clerk in the Education Department)
and I founded the East Melbourne Harriers, and my acquaintance with
Mr. Fink began when he accepted the position of President and
actually came out (on a bicycle) to see us run. He was a good
friend to the club. A dinner he gave us at his home in Balaclava
was easily the most popular item of the fixture card! The Reverend
Digby Berry, most serious-faced of all divines, vicar at the time
of Holy Trinity, East Melbourne, was one of the guests. I shall not
readily forget his looks, at the smoke-concert which followed, as
he fought to regard with gravity our comedian. No one could resist
that humorist when he really played the fool, as he did that night.
Probably the greatest triumph of his career was his conquest of
Canon Berry, who fairly doubled up with laughter.</p>

<p>Phil May I never met, but I came near him in the home of his
friend, Theodore Fink, which seemed to me full of remembrances of
the artist and his circle. There, too, I first knew something of
one who was afterwards to become a close friend of my own, Blamire
Young. Our host had command of all the arts of hospitality and used
them liberally. Not the least attractive items were his own
speeches, full of glancing wit and always pithy.</p>

<p>He has known everybody and remembers everything. When will that
book be written?</p>

<p>Mention of the East Melbourne Harrier Club recalls many
distinguished men who found recreation in its ranks in younger
days. I meet some of them now as grave and reverend signiors about
this city of Melbourne; others I hear of as filling high positions
in remote parts of the globe. The Administrator of the Mandated
Territory of New Guinea, Brigadier-General Sir Walter McNicoll,
K.B.E., C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., V.D., will possibly remember happy
smoke-nights with our old club, long before war and politics
claimed him.</p>

<p>I suppose all writers receive letters from strangers. I have had
many hundreds, agreeing or disagreeing with views put forth in
articles and books. Of all those hundreds, I have retained this one
with particular pleasure, because of its sympathetic understanding
and the eloquence of its appeal. It was unsigned; if the writer
ever reads this book, I hope she will write to me again. Here is
the letter in full:</p>

<p class="letter">The Outback,<br>
May, 1935<br>
<br>
Dear Mr. Croll,<br>
<br>
I have just read your article in the <i>Argus,</i> about the birds,
and I enjoyed it, as I do everything you write. It is quite true,
they <i>are</i> murderers, and cruel ones, too, but Nature has made
them so, and of course they are not responsible. But don't you
think that we 'humans' are much worse? It makes one wretched even
to think of what we cause innocent animals to suffer. I live on a
farm, and every time I see a flock of sheep driven from their happy
'hunting-grounds' by cruel dogs and unfeeling men to be trucked to
the city, and, after ill-treatment and hunger and thirst, to be
then slaughtered for our gratification, I can't help thinking that
there is something seriously wrong somewhere, and tho' God may be
'in His heaven,' all is <i>not</i> right with the world. I am old,
<i>very</i> old, and all my life I have felt far keener sympathy
and pity for animals than I have for my fellow beings. We have
reason and intelligence to help us to bear our troubles, and also a
sense of humour (which I think is a better help than prayer!), but
they can only feel and suffer!<br>
<br>
I could write pages on this subject if I had time, and if I were so
inconsiderate as to inflict them on you, but I will only say that
if you would use the gift you possess in expressing yourself, to
try and abolish at least some of the cruel practices that attend
the trucking and sale of sheep and cattle for the Melbourne market
you would earn the gratitude of<br>
<br>
One Old Woman<br>
<br>
who always reads and enjoys your contributions to the <i>Argus,</i>
and also the books you have written.</p>

<p>Let me close this chapter by including 'The Martyr of Bovinia,'
the set of verses referred to earlier as written, hot-foot, by C.
J. Dennis when one of the lady visitors to Kallista (she is now my
wife) declared that she had milked the cow that morning. The verses
have not previously been printed.</p>

<p class="poem">THE MARTYR OF BOVINIA<br>
<br>
She milked the cow; and all the morn was hushed<br>
(It was a beast that never kicked or rushed),<br>
The startled dicky-birds of early Spring<br>
Sat up amazed to mark this splendid thing,<br>
Nigh fainting with delight upon the bough...<br>
<i>She</i> milked the cow.<br>
<br>
She milked the cow; nor all the glory rare<br>
Of that October morning could compare<br>
With that sweet sylvan scene; the grace, the charm,<br>
The rhythmic movement of her dimpled arm,<br>
Would make a poor bloke feel just anyhow...<br>
She milked the cow.<br>
<br>
She milked the cow. 'Twas at South Sassafras&mdash;<br>
(Which is a cruel word to rhyme, alas)<br>
And all who gazed thereon declared, with force,<br>
It was sublime&mdash;except the cow, of course,<br>
Who wore a patient frown upon her brow...<br>
She milked the cow.<br>
<br>
She milked the cow&mdash;at least, she said she did.<br>
There was the milk in proof; and God forbid<br>
That I should doubt the statement in the least,<br>
(I sympathised in private with the beast,<br>
Who said&mdash;but, still, what does it matter now?)<br>
She <i>milked</i> the cow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:30%">Done at South Sassafras on the fifth day
of<br>
October, 1913, by C. J. Dennis, after<br>
drinking the milk.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. IN MY ANECDOTAGE</h2>

<p>Carlyle, grim as he was, declared laughter to be 'the cipher-key
wherewith we decipher the whole man.' By the same token he seems to
have given the world very little chance to 'decipher' Thomas
Carlyle! Is it recorded that he ever laughed? I, too, value
laughter&mdash;not from an analyst's point of view, but from the
standpoint of one who welcomes its obvious implication of good
humour and happiness. Yes; I know there is 'sardonic laughter' (the
novels of part of the XIXth century were full of it), and 'satiric
laughter' (we all have met hateful people who find amusement in
human weakness), and I suppose there are other well-known special
brands, but laughter in the main is wholesome and a sure sign of
peace and jollity.</p>

<p>In the course of a varied life one hears, and enjoys, many a
good story. Mostly they are forgotten in a day or two, or that is
my experience. From time to time I have felt that a particular
story, or incident, was too good to lose, so jotted it down. The
result lies before me&mdash;a mass of old envelopes and scraps of
paper, each with something on it to be deciphered.</p>

<p>Occasionally, though, they recall matters that are far from the
jocular. One reminds me of a night I spent 'in the dim, dead days
beyond recall' (as the syrupy old song has it, or, more plainly,
when I was a youth of about 19), touring the slums and the dens of
Little Bourke Street and its lanes with the plain-clothes police. I
have said that, like Jurgen, I have always been willing to taste
anything once (incidentally, I have been equally ready to spit it
out if distasteful) so I found myself tailing up the inspector and
making some queer acquaintances. He opened a door and we stepped
into a room where a score of Chinamen sat at a table. Little piles
of money were in front of them on the board. Had that policeman
been the Gorgon's head, the effect could not have been more
arresting. Not a sound, not a movement&mdash;all seemed petrified,
all eyes stared unwinking at us. Then a fat, suave Oriental
appeared and slipped forward ingratiatingly, the officer
nodded...at once we were ignored by the gamblers&mdash;play went on
as if we did not exist. They had grasped the fact instantly that
this was not a police raid. In the next room was a different game;
between the two stood a table with lottery tickets.</p>

<p>That scene was repeated many times during the night. Opium
joints, too, were numerous. A typical one was up a stair which went
steeply from a narrow ground floor. The furniture consisted of
three hessian stretchers without covering of any kind. For 1/6 a
small piece of opium was supplied, together with a little lamp, a
steel knitting needle and a pipe. Lie on your side on the
stretcher, take a tiny piece of the opium on your needle, cook it
dexterously over the chimney of the lamp (this is where the novice
usually fails&mdash;overheating melts the stuff into the flame),
wipe it dexterously into the bowl of the pipe (the bowl looks like
an acorn cup), lean over the light and, as the 'dope' ignites, draw
one long breath of delight into your lungs. There's the recipe for
heaven.</p>

<p>Well, the addicts said it was heaven. An experimental smoke had
no effect at all upon me. The stretcher on one side of me held a
Chinaman, that on the other side a woman, both lost in a dream
which excluded all care. 'Never worry about an opium addict,' said
the constable. 'You will never be attacked by one; his nerves are
so destroyed that he is harmless.'</p>

<p>The loveliest creature I have ever seen was in one of those
joints. A half-caste Chinese, she lay on the stretcher in the
gentle waking sleep which the drug induces. Her face was faintly,
subtly, Chinese, just enough to give it distinction, but the
general effect was European, for her eyes were round and large and
her skin was fair. Add to perfect features a bloom like the faint
flush on the face of a slumbering child&mdash;she could have passed
for the Sleeping Beauty of the fairy tale.</p>

<p>As we waited, her Chinese husband and their youngster, a little
chap of five or six, called to take her home-a nightly practice,
for the woman had reached the stage when she must have her daily
six or eight pipes or become practically demented.</p>

<p>Life has been full of variety. Contrast that experience with an
earnest endeavour, always present, to get at the heart of the
mystery of existence. One way that suggested itself was to try all
the churches. It's astonishing what a number of sects exists in
Melbourne; I think I tasted the lot. Also, I tried the
Spiritualists, sat at the feet of Mrs. Besant (most eloquent and
delightful of speakers), read the Koran and Joseph Smith, took
Buddhism in the agreeable form of the <i>Light of Asia,</i> and
sampled, as best I may, the wisdom of that shrewd old philosopher,
Confucius, who said: 'While you cannot serve men, how can you serve
spirits?' Incidentally, I ran through much free-thought literature
and heard atheist lecturers.</p>

<p>All of which leads up to an anecdote. I met a French Canadian
priest in Melbourne. His English was poor; my French was worse.
However, we managed a conversation. 'You are of the Old Church?'
(words to that effect), asked the father. 'No, m'sieu,' I replied,
'I am a Protestant; but I claim to be fairly free from prejudice.'
Then I was able to say that, a few months before, I had lectured at
the Methodist Church's Pleasant Sunday Afternoon, that in the
following week I had spoken in the Chapter House of the Anglican
Cathedral, that a little later I gave an address to a Roman
Catholic society in Oakleigh, that I had, in Central Australia,
read the prayers for a Lutheran household; with all that, I had
been brought up as a Presbyterian.</p>

<p>The father was very polite about it. I'd like to know what he
really thought!</p>

<p>A lawyer friend of mine was fond of quoting a cynical maxim:
'The truth will out&mdash;even in an affidavit!' I am reminded of
this by a news-cutting from the <i>Portland Observer:</i> 'During
the evening R. H. Croll, a noted archer and explorer, gave a
lecturette on Central Australia.' I must have pulled the long bow
to some purpose that time! It is possible, of course, that 'author'
was meant.</p>

<p>I am afraid that my son, Robin, was not very old when he began
prospecting amongst my books, for he was a very little fellow
indeed when he made this announcement to his mother: 'In a book of
Daddy's I saw a man walking about just in his bones&mdash;no bleed
or skin on!' He had probably opened my Holbein's <i>Dance of
Death.</i> It was he who was so concerned about his, and my,
welfare as we lay on a couch together in the dining-room. That is,
it was a couch to the ordinary observer, but to this imaginative
little kiddie it was at that moment an aeroplane. We had soared to
a tremendous height. He looked over the edge at the crowds of
people far below&mdash;'They can't touch us up here, can they,
Daddy?' was his remark; then, suddenly glancing up, he added,
rather apprehensively&mdash;'and if God tries to, we'll go down
again!' He was having a bit both ways, as they say on the turf.</p>

<p>The most remarkable child utterance of which I have first-hand
knowledge was this, said by little Marjorie, daughter of a
well-known artist: 'Muvver, just before I was going to be born, I
saw a big, fat lady coming be-wards me and I saw you and Daddy
sitting in the corner and I went be-wards you'!</p>

<p>On long walks through the back country (hikes, as that sturdy
Rover Scout, and my good friend, Bill Waters, consistently names
them) we have had, as I have told earlier, many mild adventures.
One afternoon, in East Gippsland, we breasted the bar of the Bell
Bird Hotel, had a drink apiece, and bought a home-made loaf ('the
best bread in Gippsland'&mdash;and I'll swear it was!) preparatory
to camping. Enter Sylvia and her sister, daughters of mine host,
and we were sure then that this was an ideal camping spot. Promoted
from mere swagmen, we were soon helping to wash up in the kitchen
and assisting to finish the Christmas pudding. Both girls were
attractive; pretty, and in their early twenties. They had drawn the
young men of the district for fifty miles round&mdash;and bear in
mind this was before motors or good roads. Sylvia's 'autograph
book' was full of more or less direct compliments, but the swain
who referred to this plump, well-favoured young woman as an 'angle'
(which he did in each of four verses) rather missed his mark. I was
tempted to write beneath it Pope Gregory's famous compliment,</p>

<p class="poem"><i>Non Angli, sed angeli</i>
</p>

<p>but we felt that the original joke, in its innocence, should not
be trespassed upon.</p>

<p>A witty suggestion, made on one of those walking tours, lingers
in my memory. One of the party was R. A. Broinowski, then Usher of
the Black Rod in the State Parliament, now Clerk of the Senate in
Canberra. He was always known to the Walking Club as 'Bron.' A
cottage came to view, and he mentioned that he was thinking of
purchasing it as a country retreat. Could we suggest a name for it?
At the moment nothing could have looked more dismal&mdash;rain was
falling in sheets, the creek was threatening the back door,
everything was drenched and miserable. 'What about Bron-chitis?'
asked someone.</p>

<p>Travelling up the Queensland coast with my brother Charles in
the s.s. <i>Canberra, I</i> made a pretty <i>faux pas.</i> A group
of passengers, first appearance after breakfast, stood watching the
coastline and speculating as to what the headland was of which we
were abreast. So many people, so many guesses...but just then
appeared the burly form of that most genial of skippers, Captain
Firth. 'Morning, Captain!' I called. 'Have you any idea where we
are?' I have not lived that down yet!</p>

<p>It was a great pleasure to voyage with Firth. Someone should put
into print a collection of his wonderfully good stories and tell
something of his varied life. I hope he will forgive me for telling
this: He was in Melbourne one blustery Saturday. Of course, there
were races on, but he was not interested. Turning into Elizabeth
Street, he met not only a gale, but a shower of an old newspaper
woman's papers which had blown out of her hands. Always kind, the
captain bent his back and retrieved some of the flying journals.
The old woman was touched by this act of gallantry. Poor as she
was, she tried to repay it. 'Back So-and-so for the Hurdle!' she
said impressively, nodded to drive it home, and departed.</p>

<p>It was Captain Firth who told of one of the ship's firemen who
was given a day off at a North Queensland port. He returned in the
evening carrying every sign of having had a good time. 'They're a
bonzer crowd,' he declared. 'I had sixteen long beers&mdash;could
have got full if I'd liked!' I mentioned the saying of a shearer's
cook that some of the chaps in his sheds had had wonderful
appetites&mdash;he'd seen a man make a sandwich out of a whole
sheep between two bags of flour! That reminded the captain at once
of the other extreme, which he called the Sandy Mac sandwich. Sandy
Mac, it appeared, was an out-back squatter noted for his meanness.
His idea of a sandwich was a lizard between two pieces of bark!</p>

<p>My people were related by marriage to John Collins, red-faced,
blustering, good-natured John Collins, who looked a seaman and was
one in his youth, although stationmaster at Sydney Railway Station
when I knew him. I recall with amusement that a young Scottish
nephew of his came to New South Wales and, while staying with
Collins during a spell ashore, confided that he would like to leave
the sea. The uncle's horror was profound. 'What! Desert!
Unthinkable!' and much more to that effect. But he confided to me
later that he had done just that very thing when <i>he</i> was a
lad!</p>

<p>He linked us up with Sir John Franklin for, as a boy, Collins
went to the Polar regions in one of the ships sent to look for the
lost explorer whose disappearance, when searching for the North
West Passage, was one of the major mysteries of the nineteenth
century. I wonder if my memory is correct in attempting to quote
the first verse of a popular poem of the day. I have not seen it
since I was a boy:</p>

<p class="poem">The Polar clouds uplift<br>
A moment and no more,<br>
And, through the snowy drift,<br>
We see them on the shore,<br>
A band of gallant hearts,<br>
Well-ordered, calm and brave,<br>
Braced for their closing parts&mdash;<br>
Their long march to the grave.</p>

<p>Collins and his shipmates contributed nothing to the solution of
the puzzle, but they had some interesting experiences. The first
great iceberg they came to was like a minor mountain. It towered up
to a peak which dominated the whole scene. A boat was put off and
the crew, including young Collins, 'landed' on the berg. There was
a scramble and a race to scale the peak. Collins, a marlinspike in
his hand, was an easy first and, as he reached the summit, he smote
it a driving blow with the point of the iron bar. The result was
amazing. The ice split like glass and crashed down in masses on to
the climbing sailors, taking the youngster with them. No one was
hurt&mdash;but John found himself very unpopular.</p>

<p>My brother and I, young then, played a successful joke upon
Collins when he visited us at our home in Melbourne. Father was an
excellent gardener, and we had a good show of flowers. Collins was
promised seeds of some of the choicest, and in due season these
were made up in neat packets and forwarded. Now, John Collins, in
his breezy way, was fond of 'throwing off' at us the old New South
Wales jibe that Victoria was merely a 'cabbage garden.' So we
included a packet of cabbage seeds, disguised under a Latin name,
and managed to make it look so important that he planted them in
the most conspicuous parts of his front garden. They grew
beautifully. We had a complete retort to his remonstrances: 'What
else could you expect from a cabbage garden?'</p>

<p>Collins's hospitable home at Glebe Point comes to mind in quite
a different connection. I went to Auckland, New Zealand, as manager
of a team of Victorian athletes who competed in the Australasian
Championships there. Harvey Sutton (later to be the second
Victorian Rhodes Scholar) and I found ourselves landing in Sydney
on the return journey with just half a crown between us.
Mercifully, we had our railway tickets for Melbourne, so could
reach home, but what about some tucker during that more than
twenty-four hours? We recklessly spent some of our hoard on a cab
to the station&mdash;we were to leave that evening and it was then
afternoon&mdash;and I undertook to raise a loan from Collins. But
when I reached the Glebe there was no one home but the maid. I
could not borrow from her, of course. As I pondered what to do, she
asked me to have a cup of tea. Well, that was something to the
good, and when she added ham sandwiches I felt that matters were
not so black, after all. I certainly had some twinges about Harvey,
guarding our one and threepence as he waited in the city. But
abstention on my part was not going to help him, so I did justice
to my meal. Eventually we boarded the express with a few apples,
sat up all night, and when we crossed into Victoria (this was
before federation), I spent a well-saved ninepence on a telegram to
my brother: 'Meet us. Stony.'</p>

<p>Harvey Sutton is one of the best all-rounders I have ever known.
Amiable, level-headed, full of common sense, a wide reader with a
taste for art, an excellent student and a first-class athlete, he
was the ideal Rhodes Scholar, for he so completely fulfilled the
Rhodes requirements. He is now Professor Harvey Sutton, O.B.E.,
M.D., D.PH., B.SC., Director of the School of Public Health and
Preventive Medicine at Sydney University. I wonder if he remembers
his triumphs in the mile and half-mile championships?</p>

<p>In those teams which I managed I recall, for their quaint
humour, George ('Dad') Wheatley and George Blake, the one a
middle-distance runner, the other best at the mile and onwards. No
one could keep serious when either of these started their joking;
the two in combination would have moved a Highland clergyman to
laughter. But they took their sport as it should be taken, and
never gave the manager any uneasiness. Herbert Hunter, sprinter and
jumper, after whom the shield awarded in Victorian track
championships is named, was one of my Auckland team. He was in the
famous landing at Gallipoli, was wounded in the ankle and, as he
lay on the beach awaiting transport, a stray bullet came over and
killed him. Another fine sacrifice to that foul goddess, War.</p>

<p>Mention of Sydney reminds me of how I once took part in that
silly old controversy about the relative merits of the two main
cities of Australia. The prejudice on each side is dying now, thank
goodness, but at the time of which I write it was very active. I
blew in at my cousin's house in a Sydney suburb one afternoon and
found an 'at home' in full blast. None but women were present, and
they were all Sydney women. I handed cakes and 'did the amiable'
till my cousin offered me up as a conversation piece, the topic
being Melbourne and its ridiculous ways. This was much to the
general liking; even I enjoyed it for a time. But they wouldn't
stop, and I found myself the centre of a gradually warming
bombardment. The worm turned. 'Mima,' I said, in a pause, 'I saw a
Melbourne girl in George Street to-day.' 'A friend of yours?' asked
my cousin. 'No, I didn't know her at all,' was my answer. 'How did
you know she was from Melbourne, then?' and all looked at me with
curiosity. My retort was rude, I admit, but it was singularly
effective: 'She had a smart hat on!'</p>

<p>A gourmand, according to the dictionary, is a glutton; a gourmet
is a connoisseur in food. In which class was the man (I knew him
pretty well) of whom this tale was told? He was an extremely
well-to-do German, long settled in Australia, a bachelor who sent
his mother each year a cheque for £1,000 as a Christmas box. He
prided himself on his chef: the 'little dinners' he gave were as
artistic and satisfying as the fine etchings he used to import. A
dinner for four was in progress. Suddenly the host turned to a
guest and, speaking with a marked accent, demanded: 'Do you taste
mushroom in dis sauce?' The guest meditated, tasted again,
hesitated, then said doubtfully: 'I <i>think</i> I can taste
mushrooms in it.' Up jumped the host and went out of the room
angrily. He was still angry when he returned. 'I haf spoke to der
cook,' he said. 'Dere <i>should</i> be mushroom in dat sauce, but
you should not taste it'!</p>

<p>Amongst our Melbourne friends was one whom we valued for many
reasons, but mainly, I think, looking back, because of her
outstanding sense of humour. Despite her advanced years we knew her
as Kate Alice; the familiarity implied a great liking for her. At
her house one night we found her rocking with laughter over a new
experience. She had met a small girl of about eight in the street
that day and, feeling in good humour with the world, she paused and
said: 'Well, my little dear, and how are you this nice morning?'
And the little dear had answered in three succinct sentences: ''Oo
are you talkin' to? Mind yer own business. Shut yer jaw!'</p>

<p>Did I say Kate Alice had an unusual sense of humour? How many
old ladies would have seen anything to laugh at in such an
encounter? But she counted it a joyous affair.</p>

<p>It was she who told of her very dignified son-in-law's
involuntary emulation of Lady Godiva. He had taken the family
riding hack to the sea beyond Elwood to give the beast a swim. In
those days the beach along there had no houses near it, and the
rider disrobed in the tea-tree, took the saddle off the horse, and
went in, riding bareback, to the breakers. At the first crash he
lost control, his steed took complete command, and a tall,
strikingly handsome gentleman found himself careering through the
streets of St. Kilda completely nude. That was bad enough, but
while the beast was obviously bolting the situation was not beyond
explanation; it was when he had mastered the horse and had to ride
it back, and at a controlled pace, that his blushes had a real
chance. He had three miles to go!</p>

<p>None of us were ever courageous enough to speak of this incident
to the victim, but I have more than a suspicion that his
mother-in-law was not so reticent when the humour took her.</p>

<p>Still harping on happenings to my personal friends, let me here
tell of Marjorie's small adventure on the Adelaide express. She had
a pet dog with her. 'Madam,' said the conductor, 'I am sorry, but
the dog must go into the van until I see if you are to have your
compartment (it was a two-berth sleeper) to yourself. Come and I'll
show you where I'll put him, and if you find you are to be alone,
slip along and you can have him again.' She duly saw where her pet
was placed, and returned to her seat. Later in the evening she
found all clear, so went back to the van to collect the dog. A man
was there, presumably the conductor, standing with his back to her.
'I'm alone now,' she called out. The man turned; he was a stranger.
Now, Marjorie is distinctly prepossessing. 'Oh, are you?' he said
with a pleased smile, which so disconcerted the little lady that
she made matters much worse. 'Oh, you're not the man I want!' she
exclaimed, became aware at once of the implications of her speech,
and fled for her cabin.</p>

<p>Old Jimmy Walker (he always seemed old to me, but he was not
much more than 70 when he died) was the first to introduce me to
Robbie Burns. With an Aberdonian father and an Edinburgh mother, I
must have had some natural leanings towards the Scottish
bard-anyway, I lapped his verses up as a cat laps milk. Jim Walker,
junior, was my mate in those days; we lived next door in Stawell,
and there was always a hole big enough for boys in the dividing
fence. Very vividly do I recall the old man, a weather-beaten miner
he was, with a broken nose, sitting in the chimney corner,
spectacles on face, getting every ounce out of 'Tam o' Shanter,' or
'Holy Willie's Prayer,' or the 'Cotter's Saturday Night,' sometimes
pausing to explain an unusual Scotticism, but mostly trusting to
the context to make the meaning clear. What swing he gave to the
racy 'Tam o' Shanter,' how shocked we were by the Louse on the
lady's bonnet in church (we really were!), and how we sympathized
with that 'wee, sleekit, cowrin', tim'rous beastie,' the Mouse
whose nest the plough destroyed.</p>

<p>When Jimmy Walker ceased to be a miner he took up land in the
Strathbogie Ranges, in the north-east of Victoria. It was a day's
drive then, along shocking roads, to and from the nearest town, and
in that town (Euroa) my old friend was accosted one afternoon by a
man who wanted a lift to Strathbogie. Of course, country fashion,
he was told to jump into the spring-cart and come along. The
stranger was a well-put-on citizen, with a slight American accent.
He proved to be a member of the Church of the Latter Day Saints
<i>(alias</i> Mormons) seeking to convert Australians to his form
of belief. (I found, by the way, several converts in the back
country of Victoria in after years.) Now, the driver was dressed in
shabby old clothes and doubtless appeared, to the passenger, to be
a dull country 'yob.' Patronizingly, he proceeded to 'enlighten'
the yokel regarding the Scriptures and their message to humanity.
Never did he make a greater mistake. Walker, like so many other
Scotsmen of the period, had been brought up in an atmosphere of
religious debate and, again like so many of his fellow-countrymen,
he was steeped in the Scriptures. It was long since he had had such
an opportunity of renewing anything in the nature of the old
debates&mdash;grimly, enjoying himself thoroughly, he set out to
destroy the Mormon's arguments. It was a humbled Saint who bade his
driver a chastened farewell at the end of the journey.</p>

<p>Jimmy, prospering a little, came to the city for a holiday, and
we welcomed him to our home in Glenferrie. The days were hot and he
found his greatest pleasure in sitting with his boots off and his
stockinged feet cooling on the linoleum of our kitchen. I
introduced bananas to his notice. He had never tasted any before. I
left a dozen on his plate. He ate five. 'They're no' bad,' was his
comment, 'but I couldna eat mony of them'!</p>

<p>He had been a fast sprinter in his day, winning many races. And
what a fine gun shot! One afternoon I fired at a duck which rose
from a swamp and went down the wind straight ahead of me. I missed.
Jimmy took one step clear of my smoke (ordinary black powder then),
raised his gun, fired, and the bird fell. It was a remarkable shot,
for the duck was travelling very fast and directly away from
us.</p>

<p>For some years Jimmy's was the farthest-out selection in that
lonely bush. His nearest neighbour was his married daughter, who
lived with her family a couple of miles away. Once a week he paid
them a visit. The habit of a lifetime of Sabbath observance made
him cease work every Sunday and don his cleanest clothes for the
day. Then he would generally 'daunder doon' to the daughter's farm
for a meal and a talk. On one occasion he found everybody at
work&mdash;washing on the line, chaffcutter going&mdash;his
Calvinistic blood boiled at the sacrilege. 'Are six days in the
week no' enough for ye?' he stormed, as he entered the house. 'But,
father, this is Monday!' returned his daughter. And so it was; the
old man, in his loneliness, had missed a day.</p>

<p>That that was in 'the Kelly country' goes without
saying&mdash;there's hardly a spot in north-east Victoria, if you
credit local legend, that that gang of bushrangers did not
frequent! Visiting the Clarkes at their sheep-station near Benalla
(Mary Clarke is my godchild), I saw the last of the Kelly brothers
driving a wagonette&mdash;an elderly man with a bushy beard. At the
station I found everyone reading, week by week, a serial by Roy
Bridges called <i>The Fenceless Ranges.</i> I have no excuse for
what followed. With a bottle of red ink, I drew a bowl of blood
with a dripping dagger above it, labelled the atrocity 'Beware: the
Kellys is after you,' and mailed it to Roy. I then forgot all about
it. But one day Roy blew in to my office&mdash;he had discovered
somehow that I had perpetrated the rather silly joke. He had a tale
to tell: he had altered his novel because of it! The thing had
struck him as a joke until he noticed the postmark was Benalla (he
had not learnt that I was there). He knew that township was just
then the headquarters of the remaining Kellys, and he was uneasily
aware that his rendering of the characters of some of their
relatives might not please the family. Moreover, a particularly
delicate situation was developing in the next chapter&mdash;he
wired the publishers of the serial and had the incident cut
out!</p>

<p>One of the hearty laughers of the world was W. A. Callaway,
aforetime Under-Secretary for Victoria, that is, permanent head of
the Department under which are grouped such diverse interests as
the Public Library, Museums and National Gallery of the State, the
gaols, the lunatic asylums, the aborigines, the Electoral Office,
and everything else not big enough (like Education, for instance)
to have a Department to itself. He was a good administrator, a
particularly well-read man, and I liked especially his cheery
optimism when, after his retirement, he was threatened with
blindness and had to undergo an operation for cataract. Never was
he despondent. He had joined the Cremation Society and one day,
with a characteristic outburst of laughter, he said: 'When I go,
all I want in the way of obituary is just: "Died&mdash;W.A.C. Gone
to blazes."'</p>

<p>A group of writers who meet monthly at Percival Serle's home in
Hawthorn decided one night,</p>

<p class="poem">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...for lack<br>
Of something else to hew and hack,</p>

<p>to write one another's epitaphs. Some of the results were much
in the vein suggested by Byron when he remarked: 'Believe a
woman&mdash;or an epitaph!' but some, more honest, were worth
preserving. Epitaphs of a general nature followed, and I was able
to present my friend Callaway with this&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">ON A CREMATIONIST<br>
<br>
Here lies the ash of one who,<br>
Sore perplext,<br>
Found he could burn in this world,<br>
And the next!</p>

<p>I think it was he, by the way, who told me the tale of the
notoriously lazy man. This man died, and the friend of the family
called, after the funeral, to condole with the widow. The body had
been cremated. Looking at a nice vase on the mantelpiece, the
visitor said sympathetically: 'I suppose that's poor old George
reposing up there?' 'O dear no,' retorted the widow, briskly. 'I've
got him going at last. That's George in the hourglass!'</p>

<p>I have already quoted one or two of the epitaphs devised by the
group at Serle's. That special evening led me to attempt a few
more&mdash;both for the living and the dead. The identity of my
first victim is thinly hidden under the initials 'P.S.'</p>

<p class="poem">ON A KINDLY MENTOR<br>
<br>
The gods took Wisdom and a Heart<br>
And mixed them in a subtle blend;<br>
Here lies the product of their art&mdash;<br>
Critic, scholar, friend.</p>

<p>It seems right to use merely initials for the living, but the
feelings of the dead need not be so considered, especially if they
belong to the very remote past. So I served our First Parents in
this fashion:</p>

<p class="poem">ADAM<br>
<br>
Here rests that great Progenitor<br>
In whom all nations mingle.<br>
Just think what we've to thank him for&mdash;<br>
Ah, would that he'd stayed single!</p>

<p class="poem">EVE<br>
<br>
And here the Mother of us all,<br>
Long freed from earthly passions.<br>
No woman now regrets the Fall&mdash;<br>
It introduced the fashions!</p>

<p>With no particular person in mind, and in an endeavour to
produce something more poetic than usual, this was fashioned:</p>

<p class="poem">ON ONE WHO DIED YOUNG<br>
<br>
Make moan with softest music: she is dead<br>
Who perfect lived and passed withouten stain.<br>
O Death, to whom Mankind is daily bread,<br>
Thou hast the Sweetest taken, now refrain!</p>

<p>But the epitaph lends itself agreeably to satire (perhaps
because, as a rule, the satirised is beyond answering back):</p>

<p class="poem">A CERTAIN POLITICIAN<br>
<br>
Upon this stone see carved a Statesman's name,<br>
Whose word was wont to shake the Austral skies.<br>
He gained his ends&mdash;wealth, power, place and fame,<br>
All, all were his! And now? Oh, still he lies!</p>

<p>Someone has remarked that the Devil was the first critic;
generally speaking, the followers of that profession are regarded
with at least suspicion, if not dislike, by the creative artist.
Reviewing the unsparing judgments of A. G. Stephens, so long a
guide to the literary aspirant in Australia, I conceived a strong
admiration for his work:</p>

<p class="poem">Here sleeps the critic A.G.S.,<br>
His mordant wit the brown earth smothers.<br>
Seeming to curse, he did but bless&mdash;<br>
His monument's the work of others.</p>

on</p>

<p class="poem">"BANJO"<br>
<br>
The final gallop's done; the mopoke calls;<br>
His well-loved hills fade slowly from the sight;<br>
From out the arch of Heaven a wailing falls&mdash;<br>
The keen of swans high-flying through the night.</p>

<p>Risking a slight ruffling of his feelings, I shall identify the
well-known poet and musician</p>

<p class="poem">LOUIS LAVATER<br>
<br>
And art thou mute, O singing soul!<br>
Death was unkind to stop thy voice.<br>
Now Other Worlds thy songs extol&mdash;<br>
We grieve that they rejoice!</p>

<p>I don't know how a certain other friend would take this
reflection upon his stability, so he will remain
anonymous&mdash;none the less is it a true bill:</p>

<p class="poem">Nor Death, nor Principalities, nor Powers<br>
Shall stay this Poet if he will to roam;<br>
Here he <i>should</i> sleep, but, peradventure, scours<br>
Blind Space with Comets, and makes Stars his home.</p>

<p>Two more will suffice, both, unhappily, of dead men. I knew and
liked them well:</p>

<p class="poem">HENRY LAWSON<br>
<br>
Here rests that man who made Mankind his mate<br>
Peasant and prince alike his death deplore&mdash;<br>
An old dog whimpers lonely at the gate,<br>
A weathered swag lies idle at the door.</p>

Delicious laughter haunts the place,<br>
Though here Doreen weeps with the Kid.<br>
Our Yorick <i>sleeps</i> within this space&mdash;<br>
The Bloke has passed: Oh, dip the lid!</p>

<p>Earlier in this book I have suggested that, to put it mildly, my
old Department was not fortunate, as a rule, in its Ministers.
There were notable exceptions, of course, men who were able indeed,
men with whom it was a pleasure to work because one could respect
their decisions. I would name them but for obvious reasons. One of
my unusual jobs was to represent the Department at the annual
swimming school conducted, usually at Queenscliff, for and by
teachers of the State service. This school was organized most
capably on each occasion by the Supervisor of Swimming, Miss May
Cox. On one occasion we managed to induce the Minister of the day
to spend a week observing the work of the school. He was Mr. H. I.
Cohen, M.L.C. I recall his visit largely because of his ready wit.
We were walking on the cliff one evening, and facing out to sea.
With mock seriousness, I complained that we had not had a decent
sunset during the whole of our stay. Could he, as a Victorian
Minister of the Crown, not do something about it? Like a flash he
retorted: 'No power, Mr. Croll. Anything outside the Heads is a
Commonwealth matter!'</p>

<p>I could tell many stories of Central Australian wanderings and
the Inland people, but most of them are either in my book, <i>Wide
Horizons,</i> or could not be told in print. One I may, perhaps,
delicately indicate. A foreign scientist and his wife were studying
the natives when I first visited the Centre. They had a very large
train of camels, and so well provided were they that a meal might,
and often did, include tinned asparagus, <i>paté de fois gras,</i>
and other delicacies unusual to those parts, accompanied by quite a
good selection of wines. 'Do you enjoy the camp fires?' I asked
Madame. 'Camp fires? Oh, no; I haf a stove in my tent!' The bushmen
studied this strange couple with relish&mdash;he, heavy-jowled and
fleshy, with enormous tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses before two
rolling eyes, she trim, petite, dainty even in such
surroundings&mdash;and the bushmen indulged in a sort of ashamed
mirth at the sight, in public view on the rearmost camel, of what I
may euphemistically describe as two complete toilet sets, except
that there were no jugs, no wash basins and no soap dishes.</p>

<p>One of the accepted fictions is that Scotsmen have no sense of
humour. This of the nation which produced Robert Burns! And when it
is, grudgingly, conceded that they may possess humour of a sort,
the qualification follows that, anyway, they are not quick in the
uptake&mdash;this from the slow-thinking English! Two fine old
Scots I knew in Melbourne gave the lie to both assumptions. One,
James Ferguson, was telling me of his early days in Scotland, when
I interrupted with 'My father came from Aberdeen.' 'Ah dinna blame
him!' was the instant retort, with a hearty laugh. The other Scot
told a tale of his playing golf with a fellow countryman. Two women
held the pair up badly by lingering at one of the greens. 'Fore!'
called one Scot. They took no notice. Forre!' he called again, and
again 'Forrre!' the 'r' becoming more pronounced each time. As he
paused at last and glared at the offenders: 'Hoots, mon!' said the
other Mc. 'Ye canna shift them wi' Fore. Try them wi' three and
eleven!'</p>

<p>My friend, Gilbert Wallace, editor of the <i>Victorian School
Papers</i> and <i>Education Gazette,</i> was fond of telling the
tale of the dull scholar who became so careless and inattentive to
his lessons that the Head decided he would not be bothered any
longer with such a failure. But the lad was the very backbone of
the football team, and the sports master pleaded for another
chance. 'All right,' said the Head at last. 'Give him a test in any
subject you like, and if he gets 50 per cent. right I'll keep him.'
Away went the sports master, and in a day or two he was back,
jubilant. 'He got his 50 per cent., sir,' he announced. 'Oh,' said
the Head, doubtingly, for he knew the lad. 'What did you test him
in?' 'I gave him two questions,' was the reply. 'I asked him the
colour of anthracite, and he answered "red"&mdash;which was wrong,
of course&mdash;but when I asked him the nature of chlorine gas he
said he didn't know&mdash;which was right! That gave him his
50.'</p>

<p>A truer story Gilbert told me was of his staying one night at a
little country hotel. At breakfast next morning he had for
companion a youngish man who showed in conversation a truly
astonishing knowledge. Wallace was unusually well read, and this
man could meet him at all points. The stranger turned out to be
Joseph Furphy, afterwards ('Tom Collins') to reach fame as the
author of <i>Such is Life.</i></p>

<p>Many were the good things which had birth in my old Department.
Examination papers supplied the majority ('howlers'), but, to even
things up between examiner and examinee, we had an apocryphal story
of the history paper which contained as one of its questions: 'On
which of his three voyages was Captain Cook killed?'</p>

<p>I have told elsewhere of the unconscious humour of parents and
others, but even those brass-hats, the inspectors, would display,
at times, a human weakness. In the earlier days, before the motor
became the common vehicle, we used to chaff one of them on an entry
in his office diary: 'Spelling horse, one hour.' It was suggested
that he would save time by carrying a dictionary with him!</p>

<p>Amongst these old papers is a tiny booklet composed of seven
pages of Fire Brigade Regulations, printed specially for the Public
Library, Museums and National Gallery of Victoria. It will probably
be news to the present staff that we, the clerical officers of the
Library, went through a form of drill every month or two. We
handled the hoses (and how we hated the messy job!), connected them
to the hydrants, and pretended to put out a fire. Another
unpleasantness the staff to-day knows nothing of was the wearing of
badges to give us official standing with the public. The badge was
in the form of a crown in gold wire, and we wore it (when the
Librarian was about, and only then, for we detested the label!) on
the lapel of the coat. I know that the Library to-day, through its
very obliging staff, answers questions in amazing variety and
number; in my day, too, we expected to spend much time satisfying
inquiries. I recall being asked for a Do-away Bible, and satisfied
the lady when I found her a copy of the Douai version. And one day
a lean, sunburnt man, with 'bush' written all over him, wanted to
find out how long it would take him to drive a bullock team from
Victoria to Coolgardie, Western Australia. I think I saved that
man's life, to say nothing of a team of bullocks! Every quotation
under heaven was asked for at some time or other. The big reading
room (now part of the Museum) was a popular place in which to have
fits. Out-patients would come in from the Hospital next door, often
surrounded by an aura of iodoform. In the peace of the reading
room, where quiet was strictly enforced, the outcry and fall of an
epileptic were terrifying at first to my unaccustomed ears.</p>

<p>The division then of the room into bays gave opportunity for
theft and mutilation of books. The Irish History section should
never have been placed, as it was, in a corner under the stairs,
for the seclusion gave a rare chance to a reader who disagreed with
the book to write his comments on the margin. And he did! And the
next reader, disagreeing with him, would pencil in a libellous
remark or two about the first commentator, and so the merry game
proceeded. Sometimes these marginal exchanges were better reading
(to an unprejudiced person) than the book itself!</p>

<p>Emil Creed, whom I have mentioned earlier, assisted to give the
Library a treat one day. A group of Italians (Pifferari, I think is
the name) was making Melbourne lively just then by playing several
instruments (I recall one as a curious-looking bagpipe) about the
streets. Creed was ceasing duty and met this band on the outside
steps, looking interrogatively at the building. In very halting
English they asked him what it was. He told us that he answered
them in Italian, but his effort in what he conceived to be their
native tongue could not be regarded as a success, for they at once
lined up, the bagpipe squealed and the band broke forth, to the
amusement of the readers and the astonishment of the staff, into a
popular operatic piece. Evidently they thought the place an hotel.
They didn't get a chance to finish their serenade!</p>

<p>A gong was beaten in the Library at 9.55 each night to warn all
readers that the place closed at 10 o'clock. I recall with
amusement (and some envy) that I could, and frequently did, catch
the 10.5 train at Princes Bridge station. The race is sometimes to
the swift&mdash;especially if he is able to dodge through
traffic!</p>

<p>Of all the fine men and women I have met, I know none to rival
Misss Edith Onians, honorary secretary of the City Newsboys'
Society. If it is a notable deed to make two grains of corn grow
where only one grew before, how great must be the action which
produces a group of wholesome, honest citizens where the conditions
make for nothing but evil? I am not speaking lightly when I say
that I esteem it an honour to be associated in any way at all with
such a work. I am one of the committee, but do not misunderstand
the position&mdash;the committee meets regularly and passes
accounts and listens to the doings of the month, <i>but it is Miss
Onians who does the work.</i> She is 'Miss' (no other form of
address is ever used by her immense family of boys and old boys) to
thousands; the word connotes more than 'mother' to many, it means
help and cheer and advice to all. The building she has raised (she
will deny that it was she who raised it&mdash;but who else?) in
Little Collins Street has a warmed swimming bath (how great a boon
in health and cleanliness), rooms where bootmaking, carpentry,
haircutting and other trades are taught, a hall with cinema and
talkie equipment, a library, a room for games and gymnastics, and
(again what a boon to these youngsters with their long hours of
exposure in, often, wet streets) hot meals.</p>

<p>And all this has been achieved by Miss Onians without salary or
other reward than that finest of all possible pleasures&mdash;the
sight of men living honoured lives whose initial handicaps of
poverty and environment would almost surely have been ruinous but
for her.</p>

<p>None of her boys can do wrong...but in committee we hear of much
that they do right. The streets teach them shrewdness and give them
a rare ability to express themselves. They judge quickly and are
not easily taken in. 'Miss' gathers a number of them into a Sunday
School every week. She finds that their attention is best held when
she recounts the Bible stories of great men and their doings. One
day she told them how Samson carried off the gates of Gaza. 'Aw,
that's a double-header, Miss!' came from one frank young
sceptic.</p>

<p>Before I joined the committee of the Newsboys' Society I
represented the Education Department on the Street Traders' Board,
the principal duty of which was the licensing of the lads who sell
papers in the city streets. We had some thirty boys before us one
day. They sat below the platform and came up one by one as called.
As a lad started up the steps I observed that he had the olive
skin, the oval face and the dark eyes and hair of a member of one
of the Latin races. I had not heard his name. Leaning across to the
chairman I offered the opinion that the youngster was Italian and I
wondered if we would understand him. I asked the first question. As
he reached us I said: 'Where were you born, sonny?' In perfect
English, with a slight lisp, he replied: 'In a private hospital,
sir!' I don't know yet what his nationality was.</p>

<p>Miss Onians sits as a justice in the Children's Court, but it
was not she who told me that amusing story of the cross-eyed
magistrate. He was very cross-eyed indeed. Three prisoners were in
the dock together. He addressed the first: 'What is your name?'
'John Smith!' promptly replied the second one. The magistrate was
annoyed. Turning to No. 2 he said severely: 'You speak when you're
spoken to!' 'Gorblime,' said the third man, 'I never opened me
lips!'</p>

<p>A couple of other good yarns demand recording. One was used with
delightful effect by a Victorian Minister of the Crown at a
gathering of fellow politicians. A surgeon, an architect and a
politician were discussing the origins of their callings. 'Well,'
said the surgeon, 'mine goes back a long way. If you look at
Genesis you'll find an operation was performed on Adam, the very
first man. He had a rib removed.' 'Yes, that certainly is an early
reference to your profession,' returned the architect. 'But
remember that long before that incident took place, the Great
Architect had created order out of chaos. So my profession
obviously antedates those of you two.' 'All very well,' was the
politician's retort, 'all very well&mdash;but who created
chaos!'</p>

<p>I have written earlier of newspaper errors and happenings. It
remained for that able Presbyterian, the Rev. Dr. Button of
Ballarat (a Scot who refutes in his own person all that is commonly
said about Scotsmen and humour)&mdash;it remained for him to put
over to me, with a solemn face, the statement that, when an
undertaker up there died during a burial, the local paper announced
that the sad occurrence cast quite a gloom over the proceedings! If
I had thought of it at the time I should have retorted with the
equally apocryphal story of the undertaker who set his son up in
business and committed suicide to give the lad a start!</p>

<p>Which recalls 'Den's' tale of the reporter (he said this
happened in Adelaide!) who had ideas of his own as to the best way
of telling a 'news story.' He was sent to get details of a murder
and suicide and he started the narrative thus: 'Mind the blood and
brains, said the courteous constable as he opened the door to our
representative...'</p>

<p>And while dwelling on morbid subjects let me recall the witty
remark of a lady patient in one of our most modern hospitals. When
my wife entered the building it reeked of disinfectant. 'And how
are you?' she asked her friend. 'My dear,' was the reply, 'I am
suffering from phenyle decay!'</p>

<p>A cheerful Melbourne artist, nothing if not original and
inventing the unusual, had to be operated on for some abdominal
trouble. He was a source of mingled joy and trepidation to the
nurses&mdash;joy because no one could help liking him, trepidation
because he observed no rules known to hospitals. He boasted a
visitors' book, surely the most unusual ever devised, for it was
the broad bandage which covered the scar on his 'lower chest!' A
fountain pen was kept handy; all must sign, and sign they did!</p>

<p>I remember M. J. McNally pretending to be a doctor during one of
our visits to Sunnyside (of sainted memory). He caught me in bed
and that, I think, gave him the idea. Drawing a chair up, he
clasped my wrist with one hand, counted the pulse, looked startled,
produced his watch, counted again, then leaping to his
feet&mdash;'Good God!' he cried. 'The man's ten minutes fast!' Dave
Low did a caricature portrait of Garry Roberts at that home and,
later, in his William Street studio, he did one of me which was
published in the <i>Bulletin.</i> The original drawing hangs on the
wall of my bookroom. Framed with it is a piece of verse by Low. I
had photographed the caricature and sent him a print as a Christmas
card. On the back I wrote:</p>

<p class="poem">Though the artist here traduces<br>
Quite a noble countenance,<br>
Ugly mugs may have their uses&mdash;<br>
As a mopper-up of juices<br>
This one offers no excuses&mdash;<br>
All it asks is half a chance.</p>

<p>His reply was very much to the point:</p>

<p class="poem">It hurts me sore, so help me, Bob,<br>
To find my rendering of your gob<br>
Regarded as a base traduce.<br>
Goldarn it, Robert, what's the use?<br>
My art did but lay bare your soul&mdash;<br>
Should I be blamed for R. H. Croll!</p>

<p>Jack Cato, photographer, told me one night at the Savage Club a
number of informative things about Tom Roberts, whose life I had
just written. But Cato's best, I think, was of his meeting with
Bernard Shaw, who expressed the hope that colour photography would
soon come in&mdash;his ruddy beard was turning white!</p>

<p>My versatile friend, Garry Roberts, startled us one evening by
the announcement that he had been 'best man' at his father's
wedding! So he had; the father had married a second time, well
after his first family had grown up, and they were very friendly
towards their father's proposed new partner. Which recalls that a
padre in Central Australia told me that, in a remote part of the
back country where no clergyman had been before, he married a
couple, their two grown-up children being the witnesses. Talking of
remarriage reminds me of a conversation in which I took part one
afternoon. 'How's father?' I asked one of the group. 'I'm not
speaking to father,' came the reply. 'I won't have anything more to
do with him.' 'What's that?' I queried, then thought I knew the
cause. 'Oh, is it because he has married again?' 'No!' she
retorted. 'I don't mind that, but he took mother to the church with
him!' 'Took mother! how the deuce...?' 'Yes, you see, mother was
cremated and father always wears her in his scarf-pin!'</p>

<p>Of the making of many anecdotes there is no end. Here's a pretty
piece of punning told me by Frank Tate. He was with Franklin
Peterson the younger&mdash;that brilliant journalist who died long
before his time&mdash;on a steamer coming from America. A group of
American girls chatted with a group of young Australians and, said
Tate, all spoke most distressingly through their noses. 'They are
contending for the nasal supremacy of the Pacific' was Peterson's
crisp comment.</p>

<p>Amongst men who have, in the flesh, interested me very much are
Mark Twain and Sir Henry Parkes. I saw Mark on the stage of the
Town Hall, a benevolent looking, quiet man, who made you laugh by
sheer personality, an oozing of humour (if I may put it that way)
for he had no tricks of oratory and no high lights of emphasis in
his talk. It just flowed on, and you listened reposefully till some
delicious absurdity, delivered almost as though he did not mean it,
swept you off your feet. He was, in his own words, 'as ca'm as a
ham.'</p>

<p>Parkes, too, I heard in Melbourne Town Hall. He was a surprise.
I had thought that his reputation for dropping the 'h' was forged
by the humorous papers and fostered by his opponents in politics.
But this able old man, who spoke most forcefully and eloquently,
strewed the stage with his aspirates in the most illiterate
fashion. What a gift he was for the caricaturists with that leonine
head and bushy beard.</p>

<p>George Reid, so witty of speech, so resourceful in debate, has
been the subject of countless stories. My personal contact with him
was when he joined a band of athletes at dinner in Sydney one night
as chief guest and we toasted his health. He replied, glancing down
at his portly figure: 'I, too, have a championship belt!' Is it too
stale a tale, that one in which for once he had no retort? I'll
chance it. He was contesting an election and ended a narration of
his claims by declaring himself necessary in the government of the
country. He pointed out that his party seemed to depend on him. 'If
I were to die, as things now are, what would happen!' he exclaimed.
It was only a rhetorical question, but it brought a reply: 'The fat
would be in the fire then, George!'</p>

<p>It was not politics which brought me into touch with the present
Prime Minister of Australia, the Right Honourable Robert Gordon
Menzies. It was Art. He originated the idea of an Academy which
would link up all art interests in Australia (the pictorial and
plastic arts, that is), so making it possible for the whole of
these great cultural influences to speak with a single voice. What
a row ensued! In Sydney, a few well-known painters, members of a
local society, after joining the Academy, discovered that they were
outnumbered by members of a rival society. So they
resigned&mdash;hardly a logical act when it was clear that
societies had not been considered in the matter, but merely the
merits of individuals. Then Melbourne witnessed the remarkable
sight of the numerous warring schools of that metropolis meeting
for once on common ground! Led by one or two capable artists, who
disagreed with academies 'on principle,' the mass of painters, most
of whom could never show sufficient talent to reach the standard
required by an academy, noisily rejected the idea of such a body.
There remained, in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart
sufficient of the really talented exponents of painting and
sculpture (architecture was added later) to found an academy of
some fifty leading artists, so joining up the whole of the
Australian States, save Western Australia. I predict that this
academy will some day have the prefix 'Royal' and stand on the same
footing in Australia as the Royal Academy does in England.</p>

<p>Menzies was then Federal Attorney-General. The academy, with him
as chairman at the meeting, was formally brought into being at
Canberra in June, 1937. I was appointed general secretary and
treasurer, a busy job indeed. In the months which followed, I was
to sit with Menzies in conference many times. I have never met an
abler man. He was inevitably to be a leader and to fill high
positions. Clear thinking, a good memory, wide reading, a really
amazing gift of expression&mdash;combine these with mental
alertness at its highest and you have some idea of his equipment.
Without a gesture or other aid to his oratory, without a change of
expression on his face, he could hold his audience absolutely. He
even, on one memorable night, magicked a roomful of Savage Club
members into silence (they had just dined, too!) while he told
them, in the quietest way, of some of his travels abroad. It was
said of him, when he was in the State House, that he would rather
lose a friend than a repartee. Well, I heard many repartees...and
enjoyed them all. When he became Prime Minister I sent him a wire
with a quotation from Newbolt. This was the message: 'To Robert
Gordon Menzies&mdash;Gay goes the Gordon to a fight. Good luck.
Robert Henderson Croll.' I reckoned he was in for a fight&mdash;and
so he was!</p>

<p>Although I am a life member of the Melbourne Walking Club I
joined that other body of walkers in woodland ways, the Wallaby
Club, a few years ago. Its members are mostly older men than those
of the first-named club and are largely of the professional
classes&mdash;University professors, doctors and lawyers being, I
think, in the majority. My first close touch was made when, as the
guest of Theodore Fink, I sat with him and Sir John Monash at an
annual dinner of the club in the Oriental Hotel. Later, Professor
Wadham (of the School of Agriculture, Melbourne University) was
good enough to propose me as a member. I recall with much amusement
a dictum of Mr. Justice Dixon, of the High Court of Australia, who
was then, I fancy, president of the Wallabys. With mock seriousness
he quoted: 'Stealing from one author is plagiarism; stealing from
three authors is research!'</p>

<p>There are moments of expansion when I recall that, as a younger
man, I once (and once only!) wrestled Clarence Weber when that
active giant was at the height of his powers. I had just finished
exercising in his rooms and was walking across to the bathroom when
I encountered Weber standing with both arms stretched up high,
doing breathing practice. I leaped at him, gripped him round the
body, twisted my legs round his and sank my chin into his neck. The
bout was on. He did not lower his arms: he merely bent his head
slightly to glance down at me. Then he said: 'Well, I can't get you
off without hurting you...!' The bout was over.</p>

<p>Thinking back to younger days when, with my good friend and
indefatigable worker Lindley Wood as honorary secretary, a group of
us, all very enthusiastic, 'ran' the Hawthorn branch of the
University Extension movement, I am interested to recall our
ambitions and the excellence of the matter we managed to present to
our members. I cannot remember the titles of all the series of
lectures, but here are some: Sir Edgeworth David on Antarctica;
Professor W. A. Osborne on Physiology of Daily Life; the Revd.
Professor Rentoul on English Literature; Dr. J. A. Leach on Nature
Study in the Vicinity of Hawthorn; Professor Walter Murdoch on
Great Living Writers; Mr. Frank Tate on Shakespeare. That gives an
indication of the fare. There were other lecturers, including one
who spoke on Ibsen. He folded up his notes as the clock struck
nine, remarked that that was the customary length of an Extension
lecture, and we were left to finish Ibsen for ourselves.</p>

<p class="caption"><b>Clockwise: Grace Devereaux Croll (wife);
Robin Croll (son); Blamire Young; "Yours in dirty weather." Captain
Firth of the S.S. "Canberra."</b>
</p>

<p>I was to know Walter Murdoch in other ways as well. One night at
W. A. Callaway's he was prompter while Callaway and I acted a scene
from <i>Cyrano de Bergerac.</i> I can see his perplexed face now
when I managed to skip several pages. When I think of Murdoch as
'Elzevir' the essayist I am reminded of Neilson's line: 'Gold he
has poured out and silver on this tent of mine.'</p>

<p>The Savage Club, joined when I left the Amateur Sports Club
(reluctantly, for I had been a foundation member), has been a
source of much pleasure in recent years. So many good fellows
gather there, so many artists, so many writers, so many men it is a
mental exhilaration to talk with. Kingsley Henderson has been
president for the greater part of my period: I always think of him
as a maker of neat, and telling, speeches and as the perfect host.
One of the most interesting of my Savage memories is of the lunch
given by Ambrose Pratt to help a young writer to put a new magazine
<i>(Manuscripts)</i> on the market. It was one of those lunches
calculated to rouse generous feelings in the heart of the most
penurious. On our host's right sat the youth, Tatlock Miller by
name; on the left was R. G. Menzies; the late Sidney Myer was also
one of the dozen. When all were at the coffee stage a menu card was
passed round for signatures. When it came back to Ambrose Pratt he
handed it to Menzies who, as a lawyer, wrote in the blank space
above our names an undertaking that we, whose names followed, had
agreed to subscribe to the magazine. In vain, with much laughter,
we protested. The only reply was: 'How many copies will you take?'
As a poor public servant I was let down lightly with two, but some
of my wealthy neighbours were loaded with as many as six. If anyone
hesitated, his means were appraised by the whole company, the
figures mounting with each pause. When Sidney Myer's turn came, he
dug his hand deep into his pocket, produced his keys and threw them
on the table with a despairing gesture&mdash;'Take the lot!' said
he. He was put up to auction. The company was invited to bid: 'How
many subscriptions for Sidney Myer?' called the chairman. 'Five!'
from one voice. 'Six!' from another&mdash;we ran him up to
eleven.</p>

<p>Have I told the tale already, I wonder, of meeting the Poet
Laureate, John Masefield, one night at Mrs. Bull's home in Surrey
Hills. Mrs. Masefield was with him. It was during that exceedingly
wet spring which damped Victoria's centenary celebrations.
Masefield remarked to my wife, as we drove home, that that was the
first night of stars in the six weeks of their sojourn here! He had
admired Arthur Streeton's great picture (now in the National
Gallery, Adelaide) which the painter had named so happily
'Australia Felix.' 'Indeed an Australia felix' (strong accent on
the felix) 'which has such a painter,' was Masefield's comment. He
wished to meet Streeton, and I arranged that the two should come
together.</p>

<p>That night at Bull's the Poet Laureate asked me if I could sing
'Waltzing Matilda'&mdash;he had heard in England, he said, that it
was Australia's national anthem. Vance Palmer, sitting next to me,
broke into the song, I joined him, and the company swelled the
chorus. We had supper under the pines in the garden beside a camp
fire: I think I may claim that my son Robin and our hostess's son,
Ronald, have been the first persons in the world to make billy tea
for a Poet Laureate. Masefield, by his kindly thoughtfulness, won a
host of friends in Australia.</p>

<p>Like King Charles, this section is an inordinate time a-dying.
Anecdote leads to anecdote until the chapter threatens to parallel
the case of the widow of pious memory who, it is said, loved her
husband so dearly that she went on having children for years after
he died. I close it with much, even now, of the 'trivial fond
record' still unwritten.</p>

NOTE ON ORIGINS</h2>

<p>My father, Charles Croll, was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, on
March 24, 1823, my mother, Janet Henderson, in Gladsmuir, near
Edinburgh, on July 3, 1828. They married at St. Cuthbert's Parish
Church, Edinburgh, on May 26, 1854, the minister being the Revd.
William Bruce, of the Cowgate U.P. Church. Father and mother both
died at 'Gladsmuir,' 20 Percy Street, Glenferrie, he in 1891, she
on June 14, 1904. They are buried in the Boroondara Cemetery,
Kew.</p>

<p>Of their Scottish life I know little save the fact that father
had three brothers and two sisters, that one brother, William (born
in 1819) went to America and settled there, and that another,
James, succeeded in altering the spelling of the family name. He
established a business in Edinburgh and had a doorplate made. The
engraver put an 'a' into the name, making it Croall, and my uncle
did not bother to alter it. So we have one set of cousins who are
Crolls and another who are Croalls.</p>

<p>I have traced the 'Croll' back to the Danish 'Krone,' a crown,
so it is possible ('anything is possible in a democracy') that one
of my remote forbears was a leader of a raiding band which came
across the water and managed the difficult job of holding its own
against the Scots. Anyway, the Crolls have been a long time in
Aberdeen; the name still persists there.</p>

<p>Six months after marriage my parents started for Australia as
units in an immigration scheme. They left Birkenhead in the
Clyde-built sailing ship <i>William Miles</i> on October 16, 1854,
sighted the coast of Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) on New Year's
morning, 1855, and cast anchor in Moreton Bay (then part of New
South Wales) on January 16. The ship could not cross the bar, so
the passengers were taken up the river to Brisbane in flat-bottomed
boats. That was on January 24, 1855.</p>

<p>The colony had ceased in 1840 to be a dumping ground for
convicts, and the <i>William Miles</i> emigrants were at first
accommodated in the old convict barracks near the end of Queen
Street where the bridge now crosses the river to South Brisbane.
The cost of the trip had been £13 per head. Father obtained work
with a chemist named Kent, and a small house was rented on the
river bank in South Brisbane&mdash;the South Brisbane railway
station now occupies the site. Here my eldest sister, Mary, was
born on May 11, 1855.</p>

<p>Father left in 1855 for Warrnambool, Victoria, where his brother
David had established himself as architect and builder. Mother
followed at the end of the year in the steamer <i>Boomerang
(?),</i> which took her as far as Sydney, where she transferred to
the steamer <i>Wonga Wonga (?)</i> without entering the town. This
boat came up the Yarra and, at 8 o'clock one evening, mother
mounted the only vehicle available, an ordinary cart, and drove
about Melbourne for many hours before she discovered her friend,
Mrs. Horne, who had been her bridesmaid, and who now welcomed her
to a home near the top of Little Collins Street.</p>

<p>In December, 1855, mother resumed her journey, embarking for
Warrnambool in the steamer <i>Lady Bird.</i> For some years the
family lived in Warrnambool or its neighbourhood and there the
second child, Arthur, and the third, Elizabeth, were born (1857 and
1860 respectively).</p>

<p>Then came the flit to Pleasant Creek (now Stawell) where Arthur
died, and Charles (1864) and myself (1869) came to light. The trek
from Warrnambool by waggon took some three days and cost £4. Camp
had to be made each night.</p>

<p>Mother had one trip back to the old country. That was in 1878.
She started on October 26 (I have noted that it was the day of the
Kelly outbreak of bushranging!) in the Money Wigram Co.'s steamer
<i>Durham.</i> She left Scotland again on July 22, 1879, and landed
at Williamstown (then the port for the mailboats) on September 11,
1879.</p>

<p>We moved from Stawell to Richmond in 1888 and to Glenferrie in
1890. I married, in 1914, Grace Devereaux Croall, of Sydney. Our
son, Robert Devereaux ('Robin'), Bachelor of Agricultural Science,
is now 22 years of age.</p>

<p>There is a very early mention of a family of Crolls in Victoria;
I should like to know something of them. It appears in the diary of
the Revd. Wm. Waterfield, first Congregational minister to the Port
Phillip Settlement (as Victoria was originally called). Under date
Wednesday, October 12, 1842, appears the entry: 'Baptized Mr.
Croll's child, William.'</p>
