    <p class="first">IF any one wishes to form the fullest estimate of the real
    character and influence of the great man whose name is prefixed to these
    remarks, he will not find it in his novels, splendid as they are, or in his
    ethical views, clearly and finely as they are conceived and expanded. He
    will find it best expressed in the news that has recently come from Canada,
    that a sect of Russian Christian anarchists has turned all its animals
    loose, on the ground that it is immoral to possess them or control them.
    About such an incident as this there is a quality altogether independent of
    the rightness or wrongness, the sanity or insanity, of the view. It is
    first and foremost a reminder that the world is still young. There are
    still theories of life as insanely reasonable as those which were disputed
    under the clear blue skies of Athens. There are still examples of a faith
    as fierce and practical as that of the Mahometans, who swept across Africa
    and Europe, shouting a single word. To the languid contemporary politician
    and philosopher it seems doubtless like something out of a dream, that in
    this iron-bound, homogeneous, and clockwork age, a company of European men
    in boots and waistcoats should begin to insist on taking the horse out of
    the shafts of the omnibus, and lift the pig out of his pig-sty, and the dog
    out of his kennel, because of a moral scruple or theory. It is like a page
    from some fairy farce to imagine the Dukhobor solemnly escorting a hen to
    the door of the yard and bidding it a benevolent farewell as it sets out on
    its travels. All this, as I say, seems mere muddle-headed absurdity to the
    typical leader of human society in this decade, to a man like Mr. Balfour,
    or Mr. Wyndham.</p>

    <p>But there is nevertheless a further thing to be said, and that is that,
    if Mr. Balfour could be converted to a religion which taught him that he
    was morally bound to walk into the House of Commons on his hands, and he
    did walk on his hands, if Mr. Wyndham could accept a creed which taught
    that he ought to dye his hair blue, and he did dye his hair blue, they
    would both of them be, almost beyond description, better and happier men
    than they are. For there is only one happiness possible or conceivable
    under the sun, and that is enthusiasm&mdash;that strange and splendid word
    that has passed through so many vicissitudes, which meant, in the
    eighteenth century the condition of a lunatic, and in ancient Greece the
    presence of a god.</p>

    <p>This great act of heroic consistency which has taken place in Canada is
    the best example of the work of Tolstoy. It is true (as I believe) that the
    Dukhobors have an origin quite independent of the great Russian moralist,
    but there can surely be little doubt that their emergence into importance
    and the growth and mental distinction of their sect, is due to his
    admirable summary and justification of their scheme of ethics. Tolstoy,
    besides being a magnificent novelist, is one of the very few men alive who
    have a real, solid, and serious view of life. He is a Catholic church, of
    which he is the only member, the somewhat arrogant Pope and the somewhat
    submissive layman. He is one of the two or three men in Europe, who have an
    attitude towards things so entirely their own, that we could supply their
    inevitable view on anything&mdash;a silk hat, a Home Rule Bill, an Indian
    poem, or a pound of tobacco. There are three men in existence who have such
    an attitude: Tolstoy, Mr. Bernard Shaw, and my friend Mr. Hilaire Belloc.
    They are all diametrically opposed to each other, but they all have this
    essential resemblance, that, given their basis of thought, their soil of
    conviction, their opinions on every earthly subject grow there naturally,
    like flowers in a field. There are certain views of certain things that
    they must take; they do not form opinions, the opinions form themselves.
    Take, for instance, in the case of Tolstoy, the mere list of miscellaneous
    objects which I wrote down at random above, a silk hat, a Home Rule Bill,
    an Indian poem, and a pound of tobacco. Tolstoy would say: "I believe in
    the utmost possible simplification of life; therefore, this silk hat is a
    black abortion." He would say: "I believe in the utmost possible
    simplification of life; therefore, this Home Rule Bill is a mere peddling
    compromise; it is no good to break up a centralised empire into nations,
    you must break the nation up into individuals." He would say: "I believe in
    the utmost possible simplification of life; therefore, I am interested in
    this Indian poem, for Eastern ethics, under all their apparent
    gorgeousness, are far simpler and more Tolstoyan than Western." He would
    say: "I believe in the utmost possible simplification of life; therefore,
    this pound of tobacco is a thing of evil; take it away." Everything in the
    world, from the Bible to a bootjack, can be, and is, reduced by Tolstoy to
    this great fundamental Tolstoyan principle, the simplification of life.
    When we deal with a body of opinion like this we are dealing with an
    incident in the history of Europe infinitely more important than the
    appearance of Napoleon Buonaparte.</p>

    <p>This emergence of Tolstoy, with his awful and simple ethics, is
    important in more ways than one. Among other things it is a very
    interesting commentary on an attitude which has been taken up for the
    matter of half a century by all the avowed opponents of religion. The
    secularist and the sceptic have denounced Christianity first and foremost,
    because of its encouragement of fanaticism; because religious excitement
    led men to burn their neighbours and to dance naked down the street. How
    queer it all sounds now. Religion can be swept out of the matter
    altogether, and still there are philosophical and ethical theories which
    can produce fanaticism enough to fill the world. Fanaticism has nothing at
    all to do with religion. There are grave scientific theories which, if
    carried out logically, would result in the same fires in the market-place
    and the same nakedness in the street. There are modern aesthetes who would
    expose themselves like the Adamites if they could do it in elegant
    attitudes. There are modern scientific moralists who would burn their
    opponents alive, and would be quite contented if they were burnt by some
    new chemical process. And if any one doubts this proposition&mdash;that
    fanaticism has nothing to do with religion, but has only to do with human
    nature&mdash;let him take this case of Tolstoy and the Dukhobors. A sect of
    men start with no theology at all, but with the simple doctrine that we
    ought to love our neighbour and use no force against him, and they end in
    thinking it wicked to carry a leather handbag, or to ride in a cart.</p>

    <p>A great modern writer who erases theology altogether, denies the
    validity of the Scriptures and the Churches alike, forms a purely ethical
    theory that love should be the instrument of reform, and ends by
    maintaining that we have no right to strike a man if he is torturing a
    child before our eyes. He goes on, he develops a theory of the mind and the
    emotions, which might be held by the most rigid atheist, and he ends by
    maintaining that the sexual relation out of which all humanity has come, is
    not only not moral, but is positively not natural. This is fanaticism as it
    has been and as it will always be. Destroy the last copy of he Bible, and
    persecution and insane orgies will be founded on Mr. Herbert Spencer's
    "Synthetic Philosophy." Some of the broadest thinkers of the Middle Ages
    believed in faggots, and some of the broadest thinkers in the nineteenth
    century believe in dynamite.</p>

    <p>The truth is that Tolstoy, with his immense genius, with his colossal
    faith, with his vast fearlessness and vast knowledge of life, is deficient
    in one faculty and one faculty alone. He is not a mystic: and therefore he
    has a tendency to go mad. Men talk of the extravagances and frenzies that
    have been produced by mysticism: they are a mere drop in the bucket. In the
    main, and from the beginning of time, mysticism has kept men sane. The
    thing that has driven them mad was logic. It is significant that, with all
    that has been said about the excitability of poets, only one English poet
    ever went mad, and he went mad from a logical system of theology. He was
    Cowper, and his poetry retarded his insanity for many years. So poetry, in
    which Tolstoy is deficient, has always been a tonic and sanative thing. The
    only thing that has kept the race of men from the mad extremes of the
    convent and the pirate-galley, the night-club and the lethal chamber, has
    been mysticism&mdash;the belief that logic is misleading, and that things
    are not what they seem.</p><br>

    <p class="first">HALF the ignorance or misunderstanding of this greatest
    living figure in literature comes of the attempt to judge him as we judge
    the specialised Western novelist&mdash;an utterly futile method of
    approach. He is a Russian, in the first place. Had he come to Paris with
    Turgenev, he might have been similarly re-nationalised, might possibly have
    developed into a writer pure and simple; the world might so have gained a
    few great romances&mdash;it would have lost infinitely in other directions.
    Turgenev wished it so. "My friend," he wrote to Tolstoy from his deathbed,
    "return to literature! Reflect that that gift comes to you whence
    everything comes to us. Ah! how happy I should be if I could think that my
    prayers could influence you...My friend, great writer of our Russian land,
    hear my entreaty!" For once, the second greatest of modern Russians took a
    narrow view of character and destiny. Genius must work itself out on its
    own lines. Tolstoy remained a Russian from tip to toe&mdash;that is one of
    his supreme values for us; and he remained an indivisible personality. The
    artist and the moralist are inseparable in his works. "We are not to take
    'Anna Karenina' as a work of art," said Matthew Arnold; "we are to take it
    as a piece of life." The distinction is not very satisfactorily stated, but
    the meaning is clear.</p>

    <p>So, too, W. D. Howells, in his introduction to an American edition of
    the "Sebastopol Sketches": "I do not know how it is with others to whom
    these books of Tolstoy's have come, but for my part I cannot think of them
    as literature in the artistic sense at all. Some people complain to me when
    I praise them that they are too long, too diffuse, too confused, that the
    characters' names are hard to pronounce, and that the life they portray is
    very sad and not amusing. In the presence of these criticisms I can only
    say that I find them nothing of the kind, but that each history of
    Tolstoy's is as clear, as orderly, as brief, as something I have lived
    through myself....</p>

    <p>I cannot think of any service which imaginative literature has done the
    race so great as that which Tolstoy has done in his conception of Karenina
    at that crucial moment when the cruelly outraged man sees that he cannot be
    good with dignity. This leaves all tricks of fancy, all effects of art,
    immeasurably behind." So much being said, however, we may be allowed to
    emphasise in this qualities and achievements of Tolstoy as artist, rather
    than the expositions of Christian Anarchism and the social philippics under
    which those achievements have been somewhat hidden in recent years.</p>

    <p>Morbid introspectiveness and the spirit of revolt inevitably colour what
    is best in nineteenth-century Russia. Born at Yasnaya Polyana ("Clear
    Field"), Tula, in 1828, and early orphaned, Tolstoy's youth synchronised
    with the period of reaction that brought the Empire to the humiliating
    disasters of the Crimean War. No hope was left in the thin layer of society
    lying between the two mill-stones of the Court and the serfs; none in the
    little sphere of art where Byronic romanticism was ready to expire. The boy
    saw from the first the rottenness of the patriarchal aristocracy in which
    his lot seemed to be cast. Precocious, abnormally sensitive and observant,
    impatient of discipline and formal learning, awkward and bashful, always
    brooding, not a little conceited, he was a sceptic at fifteen, and left the
    University of Kazan in disgust at the stupid conventions of the time and
    place, without taking his degree.</p>

    <p>"Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth"&mdash;which appeared in three sections
    between 1852 and 1857&mdash;tells the story of this period, though the
    figure of Irtenev is probably a projection rather than a portrait of
    himself, to whom he is always less fair, not to say merciful, than to
    others. This book is a most uncompromising exercise in self-analysis. It of
    great length, there is no plot, and few outer events are recorded. The
    realism is generally morbid, but is varied by some passages of great
    descriptive power, such as the account of the storm, and occasionally with
    tender pathos, as in the story of the soldier's death, as well as by grimly
    vivid pages, such as the narrative of the mother's death. In this earliest
    work will be found the seeds both of Tolstoy's artistic genius and of his
    ethical gospel.</p>

    <p>After five years of mildly benevolent efforts among his serfs at Yasnaya
    Polyana (the disappointments of which he related a few years later in "A
    Landlord's Morning," intended to have been part of a full novel called "A
    Russian Proprietor"), his elder brother Nicholas persuaded him to join the
    army, and in 1851 he was drafted to the Caucasus as an artillery officer.
    On this favourite stage of Russian romance, where for the first time he saw
    the towering mountains and the tropical sun, and met the rugged adventurous
    highlanders, Tolstoy felt his imagination stirred as Byron among the isles
    of Greece, and his early revulsion against city life confirmed as
    Wordsworth amid the Lakes, as Thoreau at Walden, by a direct call from
    Nature to his own heart. The largest result of this experience was "The
    Cossacks" (1852). Turgenev described this fine prose epic of the contact of
    civilised and savage man as "the best novel written in our language." "The
    Raid" (or "The Invaders," as Mr. Dole's translation is entitled), same
    year, "The Wood-Cutting Expedition" (1855), "Meeting an Old Acquaintance"
    (1856), and "A Prisoner in the Caucasus" (1862) are also drawn from
    recollections of this sojourn, and show the same descriptive and romantic
    power. Upon the outbreak of the Crimean War the Count was called to
    Sebastopol, where he had command of a battery, and took part in the defence
    of the citadel. The immediate product of these dark months of bloodshed was
    the thrilling series of impressions reprinted from one of the leading
    Russian reviews as "Sebastopol Sketches" (1856). From that day onward
    Tolstoy knew and hateful truth about war and the thoughtless
    pseudo-patriotism which hurries nations into fratricidal slaughter. From
    that there was expunged from his mind all the cheap romanticism which
    depends upon the glorification of the savage nature. These wonderful
    pictures of the routine of the battlefield established his position in
    Russia as a writer, and later on created in Western countries an impression
    like that of the canvases of Vereshchagin.</p>

    <p>For a brief time Tolstoy became a figure in the old and new capitals of
    Russia by right of talent as well as birth. His very chequered friendship
    with Turgenev, one of the oddest chapters in literary history, can only be
    mentioned here.</p>

    <p>The catalogue of crime which he charged against himself in his
    salvationist crisis of twenty years later must not be taken literally; but
    that there was some ground for it we may guess from the scenic and
    incidental realism of the "Recollections of a Billiard Marker" (1856), and
    of many a later page. Several other powerful short novels date from about
    this time, including "Albert" and "Lucerne," both of which remind us of the
    Count's susceptibility to music; "Polikushka," a tale of peasant life; and
    "Family Happiness," the story of a marriage that failed, a most clear,
    consistent, forceful, and in parts beautiful piece of work, anticipating in
    essentials "The Kreutzer Sonata" that was to scandalise the world thirty
    years afterward.</p>

    <p>After all, it was family happiness that saved Leo Tolstoy. For the third
    time the hand of death had snatched away one of the nearest to
    him&mdash;his brother Nicholas. Two years later, in 1862, he married Miss
    Behrs, daughter of the army surgeon in Tula&mdash;the most fortunate thing
    that has happened to him in his whole life, I should think. Family
    responsibilities, those novel and daring experiments in peasant education
    which are recorded in several volumes of the highest interest, the
    supervision of the estate, magisterial work, and last, but not least, the
    prolonged labours upon "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina" fill up the next
    fifteen years. "War and Peace" (1864-9) is a huge panorama of the
    Napoleonic campaign of 1812, with preceding and succeeding episodes in
    Russian society. These four volumes display in their superlative degree
    Tolstoy's indifference to plot and his absorption in individual character;
    they are rather a series of scenes threaded upon the fortunes of several
    families than a set novel; but they contain passages of penetrating
    psychology and vivid description, as well as a certain amount of anarchist
    theorising. Of this work, by which its author became known in the West,
    Flaubert (how the name carries us backward!) wrote: "It is of the first
    order. What a painter and what a psychologist! The two first volumes are
    sublime, but the third drags frightfully. There are some quite
    Shakespearean things in it." The artist's hand was now strengthening for
    his highest attainment. In 1876 appeared "Anna Karenina," his greatest, and
    as he intended at the time (but Art is not so easily jilted), his last
    novel. The fine qualities of this book, which, though long, is dramatically
    unified and vitally coherent, have been so fully recognised that I need not
    attempt to describe them. Mr. George Meredith has described Anna as "the
    most perfectly depicted female character in all fiction," which, from the
    author of "Diana," is praise indeed. Parallel with the main subject of the
    illicit love of Anna and Vronsky there is a minor subject in the fortunes
    of Levin and Kitty, wherein the reader will discover many of Tolstoy's own
    experiences.</p>

    <p>Matthew Arnold complained that the book contained too many characters
    and a burdensome multiplicity of actions, but praised its author's
    extraordinarily fine perception and no less extraordinary truthfulness, and
    frankly revelled in Anna's "large, fresh, rich, generous, delightful
    nature." "When I had ended my work 'Anna Karenina,'" said Tolstoy in "My
    Confession" (1879-82), "my despair reached such a height that I could do
    nothing but think of the horrible condition in which I found myself...I saw
    only one thing&mdash;Death. Everything else was a lie."</p>

    <p>Of that spiritual crisis nothing need be said here except that it only
    intensified, and did not really, as it seemed to do, vitally change,
    principles and instincts which had possessed Tolstoy from the beginning.
    His subsequent ethical and religious development may be traced in a long
    series of books and pamphlets, of which the most important are "The Gospels
    Translated, Compared, and Harmonised" (1880-2), "What I Believe" ["My
    Religion"], produced abroad in 1884, "What is to be Done?" (1884-5), "Life"
    (1887), "Work" (1888), "The Kingdom of God is Within You" (1893),
    "Non-Action" (1894), "Patriotism and Christianity" (1896)&mdash;crusade, in
    the foreign and the clandestine presses at least, against all Imperial
    authority and social maladjustments. Mr. Chertkov, Mr. Aylmer Maude, the
    "Brotherhood Publishing Co.," and the "Free Age Press" deserve praise for
    their efforts to popularise these and other works of the Count in
    thoroughly good translations. In "What is Art?" (1898), not content with
    the bare utilitarian argument that it is merely a means of social union, he
    launched a jehad against all modern ideas of Art which rely upon a
    conception of beauty and all ideas of beauty into which pleasure enters as
    a leading constituent. A short but luminous essay on "Guy de Maupassant and
    the Art of Fiction" is a scathing attack upon militarism in general and the
    Franco-Russian Alliance in particular&mdash;"The Christian Teaching"
    (1898), and "The Slavery of our Times" (1900). Various letters on the
    successive famines and on the religious persecutions in Russia deserve
    separate mention; they remind us that since the failure of the
    revolutionary movement miscalled "Nihilism" Tolstoy has gradually risen to
    the position of the one man who can continue with impunity a public more
    satisfactory contribution to the subject.</p>

    <p>It is more to our purpose to note that in this volcanic and fecund if
    fundamentally simple personality the artist has dogged the steps of the
    evangelist to the last. "Master and Man" (1895) is one of the most
    exquisite short stories ever written. "The Death of Ivan Ilyich" (1884) and
    "Resurrection" (1899) are in some ways the most powerful of all his works.
    The much condemned "Dominion of Darkness" (1886) and "Kreutzer Sonata"
    (1889) will be more fairly judged when the average Englishman has learned
    the supreme merit of that uncompromising truthfulness which gives nobility
    to every line the grand Russian ever wrote.</p>

    <p>To submit a work like "Resurrection" to the summary treatment which the
    ordinary novel receives and merits is absurd. It is a large picture of the
    fall and rise of man done by the swift and restless hand of a master who
    stands in a category apart, with an eye that sees externals and essentials
    with like accuracy and rapidity. Because the dramatic quality of these
    living pictures lies, not in their organisation into a conventionally
    limited plot, but first in the challenging idea upon which they are
    founded, then the inexorable development of individual characters, and ever
    and anon in the grip of particular episodes, the little critics scoff.</p>

    <p>The idea, the characters, the episodes are all too real and precious
    British self-complacency. The grandmotherly Athenaeum permits some person
    to describe this Promethean figure as "a precious vase that has been
    broken," and can now only be pieced together to make "the ornament of a
    museum,"&mdash;which reminds me that I heard a lecturer before a well-known
    literary society in London describe him lately as a "scavenger," and that a
    city bookseller assured me the other day that there was something almost
    amounting to a boycott against his fiction in the shops. The publisher who
    is preparing a complete edition of Tolstoy&mdash;enormous work!&mdash;knows
    better, knows that Tolstoy is one of the world&mdash;spirits whose advance
    out of the obscurity of a benighted land into the largest contemporary
    circulation is but a foretaste of an influence that will soon be
    co-extensive with the commonwealth of thinking men and women.</p>

    <p>His service to literature is precisely the same as his service to
    morals. Like Bunyan and Burns, Dickens and Whitman, he throws down in a
    world of decadent conventions the gauge of the democratic ideal. As he
    calls the politician and the social reformer back to the land and the
    common people, so he calls the artist back to the elemental forces ever at

    <p>There is no staginess, no sentimentality, in his work. He has no heroes
    in our Western sense, none, even, of those sensational types of personality
    which glorify the name of his Northern contemporary, Ibsen. His style is
    always natural, direct, irresistible as a physical process. He has rarely
    strayed beyond the channel of his own experience, and the reader who
    prefers breadth to depth of knowledge must seek elsewhere. He has little
    humour, but a grimly satiric note has sometimes crept into his writing, as
    Archdeacon Farrar will remember. Of artifice designed for vulgar
    entertainment he knows nothing; in the world of true art, which is the
    wine-press of the soul of man, he stands, a princely figure. Theories,
    prescriptions, and discussions are forgotten, and we think only with love

    <small>BY EDWARD GARNETT</small></h2>

    <p class="first">THE justness of the word <i>great</i> applied to a
    nation's writers is perhaps best tested by simply taking each writer in
    turn from out his Age, and seeing how far our conception of his Age remains
    unaffected.</p>

    <p>We may take away hundreds of clever writers, scores of distinguished
    creators, and the Age remains before our eyes, solidly unaffected by their
    absence; but touch one or two central figures, and lo! the whole framework
    of the Age gives in your hands, and you realise that the World's insight
    into, and understanding of that Age's life has been supplied us by the
    special interpretation offered by two or three great minds. In fact, every
    Age seems dwarfed, chaotic, full of confused tendencies and general
    contradiction till the few great men have arisen, and symbolised in
    themselves what their nation's growth or strife signifies. How many dumb
    ages are there in which no great writer has appeared, ages to whose inner
    life in consequence we have no key!</p>

    <p>Tolstoy's significance as the great writer of modern Russia can scarcely
    be augmented in Russian eyes by his exceeding significance to Europe as
    symbolising the spiritual unrest of the modern world. Yet so inevitably
    must the main stream of each age's tendency and the main movement of the
    world's thought be discovered for us by the great writers, whenever they
    appear, that Russia can no more keep Tolstoy's significance to herself than
    could Germany keep Goethe's to herself. True it is that Tolstoy, as great
    novelist, has been absorbed in mirroring the peculiar world of half-feudal,
    modern Russia, a world strange to Western Europe, but the spirit of
    analysis with which the creator of Anna Karenina and War and Peace has
    confronted the modern world is more truly representative of our Age's
    outlook than is the spirit of any other of his great contemporaries.
    Between the days of "Wilhelm Meister" and of "Resurrection" what an
    extraordinary volume of the rushing tide of modern life has swept by! A
    century of that "liberation of modern Europe from the old routine" has
    passed since Goethe stood forth for "the awakening of the modern
    spirit."</p>

    <p>A century of emancipation, of Science, of unbelief, of incessant shock,
    change, and Progress all over the face of Europe, and even as Goethe a
    hundred years ago typified the triumph of the new intelligence of Europe
    over the shackles of its old institutions, routine, and dogma (as Matthew
    Arnold affirms), so Tolstoy today stands for the triumph of the European
    soul against civilisation's routine and dogma.</p>

    <p>The peculiar modernness of Tolstoy's attitude, however, as we shall
    presently show, is that he is inspired largely by the modern scientific
    spirit in his searching analysis of modern life. Apparently at war with
    Science and Progress, his extraordinary fascination for the mind of Europe
    lies in the fact that he of all great contemporary writers has come nearest
    to demonstrating, to realising what the life of the modern man is. He of
    all the analysts of the civilised man's thoughts, emotions, and actions has
    least idealized, least beautified, and least distorted the complex daily
    life of the European world. With a marked moral bias, driven onward in his
    search for truth by his passionate religious temperament, Tolstoy, in his
    pictures of life, has constructed a truer whole, a human world less bounded
    by the artist's individual limitations, more mysteriously living in its
    vast flux and flow than is the world of any writer of the century. War and
    Peace and Anna Karenina, those great worlds where the physical environment,
    mental outlook, emotional aspiration, and moral code of the whole community
    of Russia are reproduced by his art, as some mighty cunning phantasmagoria
    of changing life, are superior in the sense of containing a whole nation's
    life, to the world of Goethe, Byron, Scott, Victor Hugo, Balzac, Dickens,
    Thackeray, Maupassant, or any latter day creator we can name. And not only
    so, but Tolstoy's analysis of life throws more light on the main currents
    of thought in our Age, raises deeper problems, and explores more untouched
    territories of the mind than does any corresponding analysis by his
    European contemporaries.</p>

    <p>It is by Tolstoy's passionate seeking of the life of the soul that the
    great Russian writer towers above the men of our day, and it is because his
    hunger for spiritual truth has led him to probe contemporary life, to
    examine all modern formulas and appearances, to penetrate into the secret
    thought and emotion of men of all grades in our complex society, that his
    work is charged with the essence of nearly all that modernity thinks and
    feels, believes and suffers, hopes and fears as it evolves in more and more
    complex forms of our terribly complex civilisation. The soul of humanity
    is, however, always the appeal of men from the life that environs, moulds,
    and burdens them, to instincts that go beyond and transcend their present
    life. Tolstoy is the appeal of the modern world, the cry of the modern
    conscience against the blinded fate of its own progress. To the eye of
    science everything is possible in human life, the sacrifice of the innocent
    for the sake of the progress of the guilty, the crushing and deforming of
    the weak so that the strong may triumph over them, the evolution of new
    serf classes at the dictates of a ruling class. All this the nineteenth
    century has seen accomplished, and not seen alone in Russia. It is
    Tolstoy's distinction to have combined in his life-work more than any other
    great artist two main conflicting points of view. He has fused by his art
    the science that defines the way Humanity is forced forward blindly and
    irresponsibly from century to century by the mere pressure of events, he
    has fused with this science of our modern world the soul's protest against
    the earthly fate of man which leads the generations into taking the
    ceaseless roads of evil which every age unwinds.</p>

    <p>Let us cite Tolstoy's treatment of War as an instance of how this great
    artist symbolises the Age for us and so marks the advance in
    self-consciousness of the modern mind, and as a nearer approximation to a
    realisation of what life is. We have only got to compare Tolstoy's
    "Sebastopol" (1856) with any other document on war by other European
    writers to perceive that Tolstoy alone among artists has realised war, his
    fellows have idealised it. To quote a passage from a former article let us
    say that: "Sebastopol" gives us war under all aspects&mdash;war as a
    squalid, honourable, daily affair of mud and glory, of vanity, disease,
    hard work, stupidity, patriotism, and inhuman agony. Tolstoy gets the
    complex effects of "Sebastopol" by keenly analysing the effect of the
    sights and sounds, dangers and pleasures, of war on the brains of a variety
    of typical men, and by placing a special valuation of his own on these
    men's actions, thoughts, and emotions, on their courage, altruism, and show
    of indifference in the face of death.</p>

    <p>He lifts up, in fact, the veil of appearances conventionally drawn by
    society over the actualities of the glorious trade of killing men, and he
    does this chiefly by analysing keenly the insensitiveness and indifference
    of the average mind, which says of the worst of war's realities, "I felt so
    and so, and did so and so: but as to what those other thousands may have
    felt in their agony, that I did not enter into at all." "Sebastopol,"
    therefore, though an exceedingly short and exceedingly simple narrative, is
    a psychological document on modern war of extraordinary value, for it
    simply relegates to the lumber-room, as unlife-like and hopelessly limited,
    all those theatrical glorifications of war which men of letters, romantic
    poets, and grave historians alike have been busily piling up on humanity's
    shelves from generation to generation. And more: we feel that in
    "Sebastopol" we have at last the skeptical modern spirit, absorbed in
    actual life, demonstrating what war is, and expressing at length the
    confused sensations of countless men, who have heretofore, recognising this
    man Tolstoy as the most advanced product of our civilisation, and likening
    him to a great surgeon, who, not deceived by the world's presentation of
    its own life, penetrates into the essential joy and suffering, health and
    disease of multitudes of men; a surgeon who, face to face with the
    strangest of Nature's laws in the constitution of human society, puzzled by
    all the illusions, fatuities, and conventions of the human mind, resolutely
    sets himself to lay bare the roots of all its passions, appetites, and
    incentives in the struggle for life, so that at least human reason may
    advance farther along the path of self-knowledge in advancing towards a
    general sociological study of man.</p>

    <p>Tolstoy's place in nineteenth-century literature is, therefore, in our
    view, no less fixed and certain than is Voltaire's place in the eighteenth
    century. Both of these writers focus for us in a marvelously complete
    manner the respective methods of analysing life by which the rationalism of
    the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the science and
    humanitarianism of the nineteenth century have moulded for us the modern
    world. All the movements, all the problems, all the speculation, all the
    agitations of the world of today in contrast with the immense materialistic
    civilisation that science has hastily built up for us in three or four
    generations, all the spirit of modern life is condensed in the pages of
    Tolstoy's writings, because, as we have said, he typifies the soul of the
    modern man gazing, now undaunted, and now in alarm, at the formidable array
    of the newly-tabulated cause and effect of humanity's progress, at the
    appalling cheapness and waste of human life in Nature's hands. Tolstoy thus
    stands for the modern soul's alarm in contact with science. And just as
    science's work after its first destruction of the past ages' formalism,
    superstition, and dogma is directed more and more to the examination and
    amelioration of human life, so Tolstoy's work has been throughout inspired
    by a passionate love of humanity, and by his ceaseless struggle against
    conventional religion, dogmatic science, and society's mechanical influence
    on the minds of its members. To make man more conscious of his acts, to
    show society its real motives and what it is feeling, and not cry out in
    admiration at what it pretends to feel&mdash;this has been the great
    novelist's aim in his delineation of Russia's life. Ever seeking the one
    truth&mdash;to arrive at men's thoughts and sensations under the daily
    pressure of life&mdash;never flinching from his exploration of the dark
    world of man's animalism and incessant self-deception, Tolstoy's realism in
    art is symbolical of our absorption in the world of fact, in the modern
    study of natural law, a study of ultimately without loss of spirituality,
    nay, resulting in immense gain to the spiritual life. The realism of the
    great Russian's novels is, therefore, more in line with the modern tendency
    and outlook than is the general tendency of other schools of Continental
    literature. And Tolstoy must be finally looked on, not merely as the
    conscience of the Russian world revolting against the too heavy burden
    which the Russian people have now to bear in Holy Russia's onward march
    towards the building-up of her great Asiatic Empire, but also as the soul
    of the modern world seeking to replace in its love of humanity the life of
    those old religions which science is destroying day by day. In this sense
    Tolstoy will stand in European literature as the conscience of the modern
    world.</p>

    <h2><a id="part4"
       name="part4">IV.&mdash;BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</a></h2>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn01"
       name="bn01"></a><b>Count Tolstoy</b></p>

    <p class="note">Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy was born at Yasnaya Polyana on
    August 28th (September 9th new style), 1828. His father, Count Nicholas
    Tolstoy, was a member of the old Russian nobility. In 1813, after the siege
    of Erfurt, he was taken prisoner by the French and afterwards retired from
    the army holding the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Having assumed the burden
    of many family debts, he succeeded in paying his creditors in full, thus
    gaining a reputation for unfailing perseverance. Tolstoy has described his
    character in "Childhood and Youth." "He was a man of the last century," he
    wrote, "and, like all his contemporaries, he had in him something
    chivalrous, enterprising, self-possessed, amiable, a passion for
    pleasure...His life was so full of all kinds of impulse that he had no time
    to think about convictions; and besides, he had been so happy all his life
    that he did not feel it necessary to do so." His father died before Tolstoy
    reached the age of ten years, seven years after the death of his mother, of
    whom he wrote: "When I try to recall to mind my mother as she was then,
    only her brown eyes arise before me, always the same look of love and
    kindness in them. If during the most trying moments of my life I could have
    caught a glimpse of her smile, I should not have known what grief is."</p>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn02"
       name="bn02"></a><b>Tolstoy in his Student days/Yasnaya Polyana</b></p>

    <p class="note">Tolstoy's early years were passed in the country on the
    old- fashioned Russian estate, which resembled somewhat in patriarchal
    habits, aristocratic manners, democratic familiarity, shiftlessness, and
    superstition, a Southern Plantation in the days of slavery. After the death
    of his father in 1837 the family was taken charge of by an aunt, the
    Countess Alexandra Osten-Saken, and three years later by relatives of his
    mother who lived at Kazan. In 1843 Tolstoy entered the University of Kazan,
    where "Impervious to the ambitions of scholarship and research, unimpressed
    by the provincial aristocracy, too nice to enjoy the rough revels of the
    students, and repelled alike from aristocrats, professors, and students by
    an unsocial and what, with our English emphasis on government, we should
    call an unregulated disposition, he seems to have had during these two or
    three years a thoroughly unhappy and unprofitable experience."* Having left
    the University in 1896 without graduating he returned to the old country
    home. Yasnaya Polyana descended to Tolstoy from his mother. The estate,
    which covers an area of some 2,500 acres, partly arable and partly wooded,
    lies a hundred miles due south of Moscow. It was at one time Tolstoy's
    intention to dispossess himself entirely of his property and live as a
    peasant. Instead of this, however, he has made over the whole of the land
    to his wife and children, and lives in the house nominally as a guest.</p>

    <p class="note">[* "Leo Tolstoy," by G. H. Perris. ]</p>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn03"
       name="bn03"></a><b>Tolstoy as an Officer</b> <i>see page 1</i></p>

    <p class="note">For a few years he lived the ordinary life of the Russian
    nobleman, enlisting at the age of 28 as cadet in a regiment of artillery in
    which his elder brother Nicholas was captain. Discontented with the idle
    life he was leading and out of harmony with his gay surroundings, he
    decided to jot down his recollections of the homeland he loved so well, and
    it was at this time that he commenced writing "Childhood and Youth" (which,
    however, was not published in its complete form until six years later) and
    "The Cossacks."</p>

    <p class="note">Subsequently Tolstoy was appointed to a post on Prince
    Gorchakov's staff in Turkey, and was present at Sebastopol in 1855, having
    attained the rank of divisional commander. His experiences during the war
    are pictured in his three sketches, "Sebastopol in December 1854," "In May
    1855," and "In August 1855." These were published the following year and at
    once made his literary reputation. At the end of the campaign he left the
    army and visited Western Europe, in order to study various school systems,
    and upon his return to Yasnaya Polyana he established several schools of
    his own.</p>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn04"
       name="bn04"></a><b>The Gateway to Yasnaya Polyana/<br>
    The Approach to the Park/<br>
    "The Tree Of the Poor" (<i>Derevo bednyakov</i>)</b></p>

    <p class="note">At the entrance to the park are two towers, medieval in
    style, which were erected by Tolstoy's maternal grandfather. From them the
    road runs through the park, rising as it approaches the house, and becomes
    merged in a level avenue of birch trees. Glimpses of a pond are caught
    through the dense foliage and of a square smoothly rolled space used as a
    tennis-ground, the game being one in which Count Tolstoy participates with
    great enjoyment. It will be noticed that in the photograph of Count Tolstoy
    and his Family, below, he is holding a tennis racket in his hand.</p>

    <p class="note">The house itself is a plain white rectangular two-storied
    building of stuccoed brick, and it would he hard to imagine a simpler and
    less pretentious place than the home in which Tolstoy has spent the greater
    part of his life. It boasts neither piazzas nor towers; indeed, no
    architectural ornaments of any kind, nor are vines or other creepers
    trained upon the flat walls to relieve their striking whiteness or soften
    their rectangular outlines. The house was not completed all at once, but
    was enlarged in proportion to the needs of the family. On one side, devoid
    of windows, there is a low porch, near which stands an old elm tree, called
    "The Tree of the Poor." Close to its trunk is a bench on which the peasants
    sit to await the coming of Count Tolstoy. Here he listens with unwearying
    patience to many stories of distress and difficulty, and gives in return,
    not only sympathy and advice, but such material assistance as may lie at
    his command.</p>

    <p class="note">It was during the period following upon his University
    career that Tolstoy threw all his energies into the task of raising both
    the economical and moral standard of peasant life, and suffered much
    disappointment at the hands of the peasants, who refused to allow him to
    pull down their dilapidated hovels even that he might erect new and
    convenient ones at his own cost. The result was that Tolstoy left Yasnaya
    Polyana for St. Petersburg in the autumn of 1847, resolved to prosecute his
    studies with the intention of taking a degree in law. With this choice of a
    career, however, he was dissatisfied, and returned again to his estate in
    1848.</p>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn05"
       name="bn05"></a><b>Count Tolstoy and his wife</b></p>

    <p class="note">In September 1862 Tolstoy married Sophia Andreevna Behrs,
    the daughter of a military doctor. He was at this time thirty-four years of
    age, his bride being sixteen years younger. Miss Behrs was not only
    beautiful, she was an exceedingly cultured girl, having passed various
    examinations at the Moscow University. According to her brother, the manner
    of their courtship was practically identical with that of Levin and Kitty
    in "Anna Karenina." Countess Tolstoy at the age of forty-eight is described
    by Sergeyenko in "How Count Tolstoy Lives and Works," as having "An open,
    expressive countenance, with vivacious, fearless eyes, which she constantly
    brings near to the objects at which she is looking. At her very first words
    one feels her straightforward nature. In her manner there is not even a
    shadow of truckling to suit the tone of any one whomsoever; her own
    individual note is always audible."</p>

    <p class="note">About the time of his marriage, Tolstoy was described as "a
    tall, wide-shouldered thin-waisted man, with a moustache, but without a
    beard, with a serious, even a gloomy expression of face, which, however,
    was softened by a gleam of kindliness whenever he smiled."</p>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn06"
       name="bn06"></a><b>Count Tolstoy at work in the fields</b></p>

    <p class="note">Living at Yasnaya Polyana winter and summer, with but rare
    intervening visits to Moscow, Tolstoy interested himself in all the
    practical details of farming. Probably his own experiences of the physical
    labour of mowing are depicted as those of Levin in "Anna Karenina." "The
    work went on and on. Levin absolutely lost all idea of time, and did not
    know whether it was early or late, though the sweat stood on his face, and
    dropped from his nose, and all his back was wet as though he had been
    plunged in water, still he felt very well. His work now seemed to him full
    of pleasure. It was a state of unconsciousness: he did not know what he was
    doing, or how much he was doing, or how the hours and moments were flying,
    but only felt that at this time his work was good."</p>

    <p class="note">Tolstoy was also an enthusiastic sportsman&mdash;a
    diversion which occasioned him two serious accidents&mdash;and, in addition
    to fulfilling the duties of a Justice of the Peace, he set himself to
    grapple with the novel conditions of land-owning, a complicated and arduous
    task to which he applied himself with characteristic energy and shrewdness.
    Indeed, his interests were manifold and exacting. Yet during this busy
    period he by no means neglected his literary work. The composition of his
    novel "War and Peace" began immediately after his marriage, and extended
    over a period of eight years. His wife copied out the manuscript of this
    work no less than seven times as he altered and improved it. "War and
    Peace" was followed by "Anna Karenina," which was not completed until
    1876.</p>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn07"
       name="bn07"></a><b>Facsimile of a portion of a Tolstoy
       manuscript.</b></p>

    <p class="note">In his method of working, Tolstoy may be likened to the old
    painters. Having settled upon a plan of work, and collected a large number
    of studies, he first makes a charcoal sketch, as it were, and writes
    rapidly without thinking of particulars. He then has a clean copy of the
    work made by his wife or one of his daughters, and this is again subjected
    to careful remodelling. It is still in the nature of a charcoal sketch. The
    MS. is speedily covered with erasures and interpolations. Whole sentences
    replace others. The work is then copied again, and some chapters Tolstoy
    writes more than ten times. He usually writes on quarto sheets of cheap
    plain paper in a large involved hand, and sometimes covers as many as
    twenty pages in one day. He regards the interval between nine o'clock and
    three as the best time for work.</p>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn08"
       name="bn08"></a><b>Tolstoy at work in his study at Yasnaya
       Polyana</b></p>

    <p class="note">His study at Yasnaya Polyana is a small room with an
    uncarpeted floor, a vaulted ceiling, and thick stone walls. Formerly it was
    a store-room, and on the ceiling are heavy black iron rings, on which hams
    used to hang and which were used later for gymnastic exercises. The study
    is very cool and quiet, and contains various implements of labour, such as
    a scythe, a saw, pincers, files, etc.</p>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn09"
       name="bn09"></a><b>Tolstoy with his bicycle</b></p>

    <p class="note">After his morning labours, Tolstoy generally goes out,
    often riding on horseback or on his bicycle, according to the state of the
    weather. He is a strict vegetarian, eating only the simplest food and
    avoiding all stimulants. He long ago ceased to smoke. Attaching great
    importance to manual labour, he takes a share in the housework, lighting
    his own fire and carrying water. At one time he learned boot-making, and it
    is wonderful what an amount of physical exertion he was able to undergo at
    the age of seventy in the way of heavy labour in the field, of riding
    scores of versts on his bicycle, or of playing for hours at lawn
    tennis.</p>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn10"
       name="bn10"></a><b>A portrait of Tolstoy/Tolstoy in the grounds of
       Yasnaya Polyana</b></p>

    <p class="note">Tolstoy has always dressed extremely simply, and when at
    home his costume consisted of a grey flannel blouse, which in summer he
    exchanged for a canvas one of a very original cut, as may be judged from
    the fact that there was in the whole district only one old woman who could
    make it according to his orders. In this blouse Tolstoy sat for his
    portrait to Kramsky and Repin, the painters. His over-dress was composed of
    a caftan and half-shuba, made of the simplest materials, and, like the
    blouse, eccentric in their cut, being made evidently not for show but to
    stand bad weather. The Hon. Ernest Howard Crosby has given an interesting
    description of Count Tolstoy's appearance. "He is dressed like a peasant in
    a grey-white blouse of thin, coarse, canvas-like material, with a leather
    belt; but his toilet differs from a peasant's in being scrupulously clean.
    His features are irregular and plain, and yet his figure is so strong and
    massive that the <i>tout ensemble</i> is striking and fine-looking. His
    little blue eyes peer out from under his bushy eyebrows with the kindliest
    of expressions."</p>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn11"
       name="bn11"></a><b>Count Tolstoy and his family</b></p>

    <p class="note">Count and Countess Tolstoy have had fifteen children of
    whom only seven survived. The system of their upbringing has been fully
    dealt with by M. C. A. Behrs in his "Recollections of Count Leo Tolstoy."
    Toys and playthings were rigorously banished from the nursery. With the
    first child the trial was made to dispense altogether with a nurse. But
    later it was thought well to yield to the requirements of their social
    position and to the habits of contemporary life, and the children were put
    under the care of nurses, <i>bonnes</i>, and governesses. The parents,
    however, exercised a strict and unremittent surveillance over both the
    children and those who had the care of them.</p>

    <p class="note">The greatest possible liberty was allowed to the children,
    and all put in authority over them were strictly forbidden to have resort
    under any pretext to violent or severe punishments.</p>

    <p class="note">Tolstoy believed that these principles were nowhere so
    generally accepted as in England, and, accordingly, from their third to
    their ninth year, the children were placed under the charge of young
    English governesses engaged directly from London.</p>

    <p class="note">Countess Tolstoy is an excellent housewife, attentive and
    hospitable. All the complicated and troublesome management of the
    housekeeping and direction of household affairs is under her charge. She is
    indefatigable, and brings her brisk energy, thriftiness, and activity to
    bear in every direction, and this she does without help. Her three eldest
    sons live apart, each occupied with his own business matters. Her daughters
    have their own interests and duties, which take up the greater part of
    their time.</p>

    <p class="note">Tolstoy's eldest daughter, Tatyana Lvovna, a girl of
    exceptional talent, in particular works very hard. In addition to copying
    much of her father's manuscript, she conducts his vast correspondence,
    consisting of an almost incredible number of letters received in all
    languages from every part of the globe.</p>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn12"
       name="bn12"></a><b>Leo Tolstoy, from a portrait painted in 1884</b></p>

    <p class="note">This is probably the most striking of all the portraits of
    Count Tolstoy, representing him when at the height of his popularity and
    power. In 1884 he was at work on the Popular Tales and Sketches which sold
    by millions throughout Russia, and from which we reproduce two or three
    illustrations&mdash;viz., one by H. R. Millar from the English edition of
    "What Men Live By," written in 1881; another by the same artist from the
    English edition of "Where Love is there God is also," and a third showing
    the cover of this tract, which was written in 1885, and issued in rough
    pamphlet form at the price of a few farthings.</p>

    <p class="note">During the last twenty years Tolstoy has written the
    following books:&mdash; "My Confession," "A Criticism of Dogmatic
    Theology," which has never been translated, "The Four Gospels, Harmonized
    and Translated," "What I Believe," "The Gospel in Brief," "What to Do," "On
    Life" (also called "Life"), "The Kreutzer Sonata," "The Kingdom of God is
    Within You," "The Christian Teaching," "What is Art?" which in Tolstoy's
    own opinion is the best constructed of his books, "Resurrection," his last
    novel, begun about 1894, and then laid aside in favour of what seemed more
    important work to be completely rewritten and published in 1899 for the
    benefit of the Dukhobors, and latterly "What is Religion and what is Its
    Essence," published in February 1902.</p>

       name="bn13"></a><b>Pasternak's illustrations to "Resurrection"</b></p>

    <p class="note">The illustrations reproduced from "Resurrection" are from
    the remarkable drawings by Leonid Pasternak. Concerning these pictures
    there is an interesting note in the preface of the French edition of the
    novel from which it may be gathered that the drawings tallied very closely
    with Tolstoy's own conception of the appearance of his characters. It was
    the artist's usual custom to submit each design on its completion to the
    eminent novelist for his opinion. Invariably Tolstoy showed his approval of
    the clever realisation of his ideas. But when it came to the sketch of
    Prince Nekhludov, Tolstoy went so far as to enquire of M. Pasternak whether
    he was acquainted with the person who had served him as a model. At this
    the artist showed extreme surprise&mdash;he had not even been aware that
    the character was copied from an original.</p>
