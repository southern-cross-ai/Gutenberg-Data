  <h2><a name="intro"
     id="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

  <p class="first">If I were writing this in French, as I should be if Chaucer
  had not chosen to write in English, I might be able to head this preliminary
  note with something like <i>Avis au lecteur</i>; which, with a French fine
  shade, would suggest without exaggeration the note of warning. As it is, I
  feel tempted to write, 'Beware!' or some such melodramatic phrase, in large
  letters across the frontispiece. For I do really desire to warn the reader,
  or the critic, of some possible mistakes in or about this book: touching its
  real purpose and its inevitable pitfalls.</p>

  <p>It were perhaps too sanguine a simplicity to say that this book is
  intended to be popular; but at least it is intended to be simple. It
  describes only the effect of a particular poet on a particular person; but it
  also expresses a personal conviction that the poet could be an extremely
  popular poet; that is, could produce the same effect on many other normal or
  unpretentious persons. It makes no claim to specialism of any sort in the
  field of Chaucerian scholarship. It is written for people who know even less
  about Chaucer than I do. It does not in any of the disputed details, dictate
  to those who know much more about Chaucer than I do. It is primarily
  concerned with the fact that Chaucer was a poet. Or, in other words, that it
  is possible to know him, without knowing anything about him. A distinguished
  French critic said of my sketch of an English novelist that it might well
  bear the simple title, 'The Praise of Dickens'; and I should be quite content
  if this tribute only bore the title of 'The Praise of Chaucer'. The whole
  point, so far as I am concerned, is that it is as easy for an ordinary
  Englishman to enjoy Chaucer as to enjoy Dickens. Dickensians always quote
  Dickens; from which it follows that they often misquote Dickens. Having long
  depended on memory, I might be quite capable of misquotation; but I fear I
  have fallen into something that may seem even more shocking: a sort of
  irregular popular translation. I do incline to think that it is necessary to
  take some such liberties, when first bringing Chaucer to the attention of
  fresh and casual readers. However that may be, all this part of the
  explanation is relatively easy; and the intention of the book is tolerably
  obvious.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately this plan of simplification and popularity is interrupted by
  two problems, which can hardly be prevented from presenting a greater
  complexity. In the second chapter, I plunged rather rashly into the wider
  historical elements of Chaucer's age; and soon found myself among deep tides
  that might well have carried me far out of my course. And yet I cannot
  altogether regret the course that I actually followed; for there grew upon
  me, while writing this chapter, a very vivid realization which the chapter
  itself does not very clearly explain. I fear that the reader will only pause
  to wonder, with not unjust irritation, why I sometimes seem to be writing
  about modern politics instead of about medieval history. I can only say that
  the actual experience, of trying to tell such truths as I know about the
  matter, left me with an overwhelming conviction that it is because we miss
  the point of the medieval history that we make a mess of the modern politics.
  I felt suddenly the fierce and glaring relevancy of all the walking social
  symbols of the Chaucerian scene to the dissolving views of our own social
  doubts and speculations to-day. There came upon me a conviction I can hardly
  explain, in these few lines, that the great Types, the heroic or humorous
  figures that make the pageant of past literature, are now fading into
  something formless; because we do not understand the old civilized order
  which gave them form, and can hardly even construct any alternative form. The
  presence of the Guilds or the grades of Chivalry, the presence of the
  particular details of that day, are not of course necessary to all human
  beings. But the absence of the Guilds and the grades of Chivalry, and the
  absence of any positive substitute for them, is now a great gap that is none
  the less a fact because it is a negative fact. Feeling this so strongly, at
  the moment, I simply could not force myself to the usual stiff official
  attitude of dealing with all such things as dead; of talking of Heraldry as
  if it were Hieroglyphics or dealing with the friars as if they had
  disappeared like the Druids. But I apologize for the disproportion of the
  second chapter, which spoils the simplicity of the opening and the general
  intention. Perhaps I might put up my notice of warning, and warn the reader
  not to read the second chapter. Now I come to think of it, I might warn him
  not to read the book at all; but in this, perhaps, there would be a tinge of
  inconsistency. Nevertheless, the book would have served its purpose if anyone
  had learned, even by getting as far as this page, that what matters is not
  books on Chaucer, but Chaucer.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Lastly, it would be affectation on my part to deny that the very subject
  forces me to face (or as ostentatiously to avoid) a subject on which I am in
  a sense expected to be controversial; on which I could not really be expected
  to be non-controversial. But this problem is all the more practical, because
  of the particular summary, or main truth about Chaucer, which is most borne
  in upon my mind, on rereading and reconsidering his work. Chaucer was a poet
  who came at the end of the medieval age and order; which certainly contained
  fanaticism, ferocity, wild asceticism and the rest. There are some who really
  suggest that it contained only fanaticism, ferocity and the rest. Anyhow, I
  was faced with the fact that Chaucer was the final fruit and inheritor of
  that order. And I was also confronted with the fact, which seems to me quite
  as certain a fact, that he was much more sane and cheerful and normal than
  most of the later writers. He was less delirious than Shakespeare, less harsh
  than Milton, less fanatical than Bunyan, less embittered than Swift. I had in
  any case to construct some sort of theory in connexion with this practical
  problem and this practical fact. Therefore in this book I advance the general
  thesis; that, in spite of everything, there was a balanced philosophy in
  medieval times; and some very unbalanced philosophies in later times.</p>

  <p>I am sorry; I could easily have ended differently; it would be much more
  simple and sociable to treat Chaucer only as a charming companion and sit
  down with him at the Tabard without further questioning about whence he came.
  But something is due to conviction; my book was bound to make some attempt to
  explain Chaucer; and this is the only way I can explain him. <span class=

  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a><small>CHAPTER I</small><br>
  The Greatness of Chaucer</h2>

  <p class="first">It is beginning to be realized that the English are the
  eccentrics of the earth. They have produced an unusually large proportion of
  what they used to call Humorists and would now perhaps rather call
  Characters. And nothing is more curious about them than the contradiction of
  their consciousness and unconsciousness of their own merits. It is nonsense,
  I regret to say, to claim that they are incapable of boasting. Sometimes they
  boast most magnificently of their weaknesses and deficiencies. Sometimes they
  boast of the more striking and outstanding virtues they do not possess.
  Sometimes (I say it with groans and grovellings before the just wrath of
  heaven) they sink so low as to boast of not boasting. But it is perfectly
  true that they seem to be entirely unaware of the very existence of some of
  their most extraordinary claims to glory and distinction. One example among
  many is the fact that they have never realized the nature, let alone the
  scale, of the genius of Geoffrey Chaucer.</p>

  <p>I say advisedly the scale; for what seems to me altogether missed is the
  <i>greatness</i> of Chaucer. Men say the obvious things about him; they call
  him the Father of English Poetry, but only in the sense in which the same
  title has been given to an obscure Anglo-Saxon like Caedmon. He also has been
  called the Father of English Poetry, though what he wrote is not in that
  sense poetry and not in any sense English. They say that Chaucer marks the
  moment when our language began to be formed out of French and Saxon elements;
  but they see nothing elemental about the man who did so much to form it. They
  say (probably falsely) that Chaucer borrowed from Boccaccio the notion of a
  framework of stories; and they admit that he brightened it a little by giving
  more personality to the tellers of the Canterbury Tales. They admit
  (sometimes with a faint air of surprise) that this fourteenth-century man was
  acquainted with the nature of a joke; they concede a certain courtesy and
  urbanity, and then generally turn with relief to digging up the old original
  dull stories which Chaucer made interesting. In short, there has been
  perceptible, in greater or less degree, an indescribable disposition to
  <i>patronize</i> Chaucer. Sometimes he is patted on the head like a child,
  because all our other poets are his children. Sometimes he is treated as the
  Oldest Inhabitant, partially demented and practically dead, because he was
  alive before anybody else in Europe to certain revolutions of the European
  mind. Sometimes he is treated as entirely dead; a bag of dry bones to be
  dissected by antiquarians, interested only in matters of detail. But in no
  common English ears, as yet, does his name actually sound as a thunderclap or
  a trumpet-peal, like the name of Dante or of Shakespeare. It may seem
  fanciful to say so, but the name of Chaucer has not yet completely achieved
  the sound of a <i>serious</i> thing. It is partly the popular sense that
  Early English is a sort of Pidgin English. It is partly the pedantic
  prejudice that medieval civilization was not civilized. It is partly a sheer
  incapacity to thank those who have given us everything, because we cannot
  imagine anything else.</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>The medieval word for a Poet was a Maker, which indeed is the original
  meaning of a Poet. It is one of the points, more numerous than some suppose,
  in which Greek and medieval simplicity nearly touch. There was never a man
  who was more of a Maker than Chaucer. He made a national language; he came
  very near to making a nation. At least without him it would probably never
  have been either so fine a language or so great a nation. Shakespeare and
  Milton were the greatest sons of their country; but Chaucer was the Father of
  his Country, rather in the style of George Washington. And apart from that,
  he made something that has altered all Europe more than the Newspaper: the
  Novel. He was a novelist when there were no novels. I mean by the novel the
  narrative that is not primarily an anecdote or an allegory, but is valued
  because of the almost accidental variety of actual human characters. The
  Prologue of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> is the Prologue of Modern Fiction. It
  is the preface to <i>Don Quixote</i> and the preface to <i>Gil Blas</i>. The
  astonishing thing is not so much that an Englishman did this as that
  Englishmen hardly ever brag about it. Nobody waves a Union Jack and cries,
  'England made jolly stories for the whole earth.' It is not too much to say
  that Chaucer made not only a new nation but a new world; and was none the
  less its real maker because it is an unreal world. And he did it in a
  language that was hardly usable until he used it; and to the glory of a
  nation that had hardly existed till he made it glorious.</p>

  <p>I know not why the people who are so silent about this go about glorying
  in the fact of having painted Tasmania red in an atlas or introduced the golf
  of Tooting to the upper classes of Turkey. But it is certain that, while some
  of them have (if it were possible) overrated the greatness of Shakespeare,
  most of them have unaccountably underrated the greatness of Chaucer. Yet most
  of the things that are hinted in depreciation of Chaucer could be said as
  easily in depreciation of Shakespeare. If Chaucer borrowed from Boccaccio and
  other writers, Shakespeare borrowed from anybody or anything, and often from
  the same French or Italian sources as his forerunner. The answer indeed is
  obvious and tremendous; that if Shakespeare borrowed, he jolly well paid
  back. But so did Chaucer, as in that very central instance I have named; when
  he turned the decorative picture-frame of the Decameron into the moving
  portrait-gallery of the ride to Canterbury.</p>

  <p>It is worth noting, touching that patronizing tone towards the
  childishness of Chaucer, that there is very much the same patronizing tone in
  many of the earlier compliments to Shakespeare. In the case of Shakespeare,
  as of Chaucer, his contemporaries and immediate successors seem to have been
  struck by something sweet or kindly about him, which they felt as too natural
  to be great in the grand style. He is chiefly praised, and occasionally
  rebuked, for freshness and spontaneity. Is it unfair to find a touch of that
  patronizing spirit even in the greatest among those who were less great?</p>

  <p class="verse">Or sweetest Shakespeare, fancy's child,<br>
  Warble his native wood-notes wild.</p>

  <p>I suspect Milton of meaning that his own organ-notes would be of a deeper
  and grander sort than wood-notes so innocently warbling. Yet somehow, as a
  summary of Shakespeare, the description does not strike one as comprehensive.
  Hung be the heavens with black...have lighted fools the way to dusty
  death...the multitudinous seas incarnadine...let the high gods, who keep this
  dreadful pother o'er our heads, find out their enemies now&mdash;these do not
  strike us exclusively as warblings. But neither, it may respectfully be
  submitted, are all the wood-notes of Chaucer to be regarded as warblings.
  There are things in Chaucer that are both austere and exalted, such as
  certain lines in his religious poems, especially his addresses to the Blessed
  Virgin; there are things in Chaucer that are both grim and violent, such as
  the description of the death-blow that broke the neck of the accuser of
  Constance. And if he only occasionally rises to the grand or descends to the
  grotesque, it is not obvious that he is the less like life for that.</p>

  <p>These examples, I may say in passing, afford an opportunity to say a word
  of explanation, even at this stage, about the spelling and diction of Chaucer
  and how I have decided to deal with it. In this also Chaucer suffers from a
  somewhat unfair disadvantage as compared with Shakespeare. Much of
  Shakespeare, as a matter of fact, was actually printed in an old spelling
  which would make many familiar lines look fantastic or awkward. Shakespeare's
  old English was near enough to be easily modernized; Chaucer's old English
  was just remote enough to make it hard to do so while preserving the accent
  and melody. Nobody can read it, indeed, without wishing that some of its
  antiquated words were in modern use. The wretched scribe, starving for
  descriptive terms, will find many which he will envy the scribe of the
  fourteenth century. Indeed, the two examples I have given themselves
  illustrate the point. There is no nobler image of the ideal, in the ideal
  sense of that vulgarized term, than that single glimpse in Chaucer:</p>

  <p class="verse">Virgin, that art so noble of apparail<br>
  That leadest us unto the highe tower<br>
  Of Paradise...</p>

  <p>nor can I ever read it without a sort of vision, of a garden tilted on a
  remote turret and a woman in trailing raiment, splendiferous like a comet,
  going up a winding stair. But, incidentally, what a pity that we cannot say
  'apparail', instead of being dismally reduced to saying 'apparel'. And, oddly
  enough, there is a similar detail in the other instance I took at random; for
  when the slanderer of Constance was 'strook' so as to break his neck-bone, we
  have the pleasing further fact that his eyes 'brast out of his head'; which
  is going about as far as grotesque violence will go. But will not the envious
  man of letters think pensively and tenderly about the possibilities of the
  word 'brast'? When the sensational novelist makes the hero burst the bonds
  knotted by the atrocious Chinaman, how much better if he brast them! When the
  comic novelist says that Mr. Pobbles burst his collar, how much more forcible
  if he brast his collar! For this reason there is every argument for leaving
  Chaucer's language as it stands, and even admitting its superiority for some
  of Chaucer's purposes. Nevertheless, for reasons which I shall explain more
  fully elsewhere, I propose in many cases boldly to modernize the Chaucerian
  language, and especially for the purpose that is immediate here: that of
  showing that Chaucer was great in the sense in which Matthew Arnold connected
  greatness with what he called 'high seriousness' and the grand style.</p>

  <p>Let anyone knowing only the popular and patronizing impression of a merry
  gossip or warbling court minstrel, suppose that he has presented to him
  without context or criticism merely such a verse as this, printed as I have
  printed it:</p>

  <p class="verse">Such end hath, lo, this Troilus for love:<br>
  Such end hath all his greatë worthiness,<br>
  Such end hath all his royal estate above,<br>
  Such end his lust, such end his nobleness,<br>
  Such end hath all the false world's brittleness:<br>
  And thus began his loving of Creseid<br>
  As I have told; and in this wise he died.</p>

  <p>Nobody who knows what English is will say that that verse is not
  dignified. Nobody who knows what tragedy is will say it is unworthy of a
  tragic poet. The words and spelling are not exactly as Chaucer wrote them,
  but they represent with some reasonable worthiness what Chaucer meant us to
  read. Now if anybody is so excruciatingly fond of the expression 'swich fin'
  that he desires to mingle it with his daily talk, as I have desired to use
  'brast' and 'apparail', it will be easy for him (by the laborious literary
  research involved in looking at the book) to discover that 'swich fin' is
  Chaucerian for 'such end' and to convict me of having poisoned the well of
  English undefiled. But I will modestly yet obstinately repeat that it does
  not give the modern reader an idea of the dignity, that was in Chaucer's mind
  and gesture, to repeat 'swich fin' five times; especially as we do not know
  how Chaucer pronounced it and are almost certainly pronouncing it wrong.</p>

  <p>Here, however, I have introduced this quotation in a quotable form, in
  order to emphasize the fact that Chaucer was capable of greatness even in the
  sense of gravity. We all know that Matthew Arnold denied that the medieval
  poet possessed this 'high seriousness'; but Matthew Arnold's version of high
  seriousness was often only high and dry solemnity. That Chaucer was, in that
  passage about Troilus, speaking with complete conviction and a sense of the
  greatness of the subject (which seem to me the only essentials of the real
  grand style) nobody can doubt who reads the following verses, in which he
  turns with terrible and realistic scorn on the Pagan gods with whom he had so
  often played. I have mentioned these matters first to show that Chaucer was
  capable of high seriousness, even in the sense of those who feel that only
  what is serious can be high. But for my part I dispute the identification. I
  think there are other things that can be high as well as high seriousness. I
  think, for instance, that there can be such things as high spirits; and that
  these also can be spiritual.</p>

  <p>Now even if we consider Chaucer only as a humorist, he was in this very
  exact sense a great humorist. And by this I do not only mean a very good
  humorist. I mean a humorist in the grand style; a humorist whose broad
  outlook embraced the world as a whole, and saw even great humanity against a
  background of greater things. This quality of grandeur in a joke is one which
  I can only explain by an example. The example also illustrates that clinging
  curse of all the criticism of Chaucer; the fact that while the poet is always
  large and humorous, the critics are often small and serious. They not only
  get hold of the wrong end of the stick, but of the diminishing end of the
  telescope; and take in a detail when they should be taking in a design. The
  Chaucerian irony is sometimes so large that it is too large to be seen. I
  know no more striking example than the business of his own contribution to
  the tales of the Canterbury Pilgrims. A thousand times have I heard men tell
  (as Chaucer himself would put it) that the poet wrote <i>The Rime of Sir
  Topas</i> as a parody of certain bad romantic verse of his own time. And the
  learned would be willing to fill their notes with examples of this bad
  poetry, with the addition of not a little bad prose. It is all very
  scholarly, and it is all perfectly true; but it entirely misses the point.
  The joke is not that Chaucer is joking at bad ballad-mongers; the joke is
  much larger than that. To see the scope of this gigantic jest we must take in
  the whole position of the poet and the whole conception of the poem.</p>

  <p>The Poet is the Maker; he is the creator of a cosmos; and Chaucer is the
  creator of the whole world of his creatures. He made the pilgrimage; he made
  the pilgrims. He made all the tales that are told by the pilgrims. Out of him
  is all the golden pageantry and chivalry of 'The Knight's Tale;' all the rank
  and rowdy farce of the Miller's; he told through the mouth of the Prioress
  the pathetic legend of the Child Martyr and through the mouth of the Squire
  the wild, almost Arabian romance of Cambuscan. And he told them all in
  sustained melodious verse, seldom so continuously prolonged in literature; in
  a style that sings from start to finish. Then in due course, as the poet is
  also a pilgrim among the other pilgrims, he is asked for his contribution. He
  is at first struck dumb with embarrassment; and then suddenly starts a gabble
  of the worst doggerel in the book. It is so bad that, after a page or two of
  it, the tolerant innkeeper breaks in with the desperate protest of one who
  can bear no more, in words that could be best translated as 'Gorlumme!' or
  'This is a bit too thick!' The poet is shouted down by a righteous revolt of
  his hearers, and can only defend himself by saying sadly that this is the
  only poem he knows. Then, by way of a final climax or anticlimax of the same
  satire, he solemnly proceeds to tell a rather dull story <i>in prose</i>.</p>

  <p>Now a joke of that scale goes a great deal beyond the particular point, or
  pointlessness, of <i>The Rime of Sir Topas</i>. Chaucer is mocking not merely
  bad poets but good poets; the best poet he knows; 'the best in this kind are
  but shadows'. Chaucer, having to represent himself as reciting bad verse, did
  very probably take the opportunity of parodying somebody else's bad verse.
  But the parody is not the point. The point is in the admirable irony of the
  whole conception of the dumb or doggerel rhymer who is nevertheless the
  author of all the other rhymes; nay, even the author of their authors. Among
  all the types and trades, the coarse miller, the hard-fisted reeve, the
  clerk, the cook, the shipman, the poet is the only man who knows no poetry.
  But the irony is wider and even deeper than that. There is in it some hint of
  those huge and abysmal ideas of which the poets are half-conscious when they
  write; the primal and elemental ideas connected with the very nature of
  creation and reality. It has in it something of the philosophy of a
  phenomenal world, and all that was meant by those sages, by no means
  pessimists, who have said that we are in a world of shadows. Chaucer has made
  a world of his own shadows, and, when he is on a certain plane, finds himself
  equally shadowy. It has in it all the mystery of the relation of the maker
  with things made. There falls on it from afar even some dark ray of the irony
  of God, who was mocked when He entered His own world, and killed when He came
  among His creatures.</p>

  <p>That is laughter in the grand style, <i>pace</i> Matthew Arnold; and
  Arnold, with all his merits, did not laugh but only smiled&mdash;not to say
  smirked. It is the presence of such things, behind the seeming simplicity of
  the fourteenth-century poet, which constitutes what I mean here by the
  greatness of Chaucer. He was a man much less commonplace than he appeared; I
  think than he deliberately appeared. He had so great a faith in common sense
  that he seems to have accepted with a smile the suggestion of the
  commonplace. But he was not commonplace. He was not superficial. His
  judgments are sufficient to show that he was not superficial. There is
  perhaps no better example of it than his journey to Italy and probable
  friendship with Petrarch, who was crowned with universal acclamation in the
  Eternal City as the one and only supreme and universal poet of the age; nor
  indeed was the admiration of the age undeserved. Petrarch was a poet, a
  prophet, a patriot, almost everything except what he was called, the greatest
  genius alive. It is typical of the neglected side of Chaucer that he admired
  Dante more than Petrarch.</p>

  <p>It may be questioned, in passing, whether this understanding is
  understood. Dante was very different from Chaucer; but he was not so utterly
  different as the sound of the two names would now generally imply. It must be
  remembered that people began to talk patronizingly of a cheerful or almost
  chirpy Chaucer, at the very time when they talked about a merely Byronic or
  melodramatic Dante. Those who see Dante as something to be illustrated by
  Doré might well be content that Chaucer should be illustrated by Stothard.
  But there was another Chaucer who was illustrated by Blake. There was an
  element in Chaucer that was symbolic to the eye of a serious mystic. A
  medieval writer actually said that Chaucer's <i>House of Fame</i> had put
  Dante into English. And though this is an extravagant exaggeration, it is not
  (as some would think) an extravagant contrast. There is much more of Dante in
  the description of Chaucer, as he is whirled aloft by the golden eagle of the
  gods, feeling that Thought can lift us to the last heaven with 'the feathers
  of philosophy', than there is in the ordinary nineteenth-century notion that
  Dante was a dark and lowering Dago who was really only at home in Hell.
  Chaucer caught sight of the eagle; his tale is not always 'of a cock'. Yet he
  is greatest perhaps with the cock and not the eagle. He is not a great Latin
  epic poet; he is a great English humorist and humanist; but he is great. The
  very case of the cock in the Nun's Priest's Tale is concerned with richer and
  deeper things than a mere fable about animals. It is not enough to talk, as
  some critics do, about Reynard the Fox or the Babrian origins. Just as they
  mainly insist that 'Sir Topas' is a parody, so they are chiefly struck by the
  fact that the fable is a fable. Curiously enough, in actual fact, it is
  either much more or much less than a fable. The interpretation is full of
  that curious rich native humour, which is at once riotous and secretive. It
  is extraordinarily English, especially in this, that it does not aim at being
  neat, as wit and logic are neat. It rather delights in being clumsy; as if
  clumsiness were part of the fun. Chaucer is not accepting a convention; he is
  enjoying a contradiction. Hundreds of years afterwards, a French poet was
  struck by the strutting parody of humanity in the poultry yard, and
  elaborated the same medieval jest, giving the cock the same medieval name.
  But the Chantecler of Rostand, with its many beautiful and rational epigrams
  in the French manner, has about it a sort of exact coincidence of mimicry,
  which fits it to the province of an actor. Rostand is pleased, as a stage
  manager, with the aptness of making a man act like a cock. Chaucer is pleased
  with the absurdity of making a cock act like a man. These are aesthetic and
  psychological impressions, about which nobody can prove anything; but I am
  pretty certain that Chaucer revelled, I might say wallowed, in the wild
  disproportion of making his little farmyard fowl talk like a philosopher and
  even a scholar. The chicken in question is hatched from the works of
  Aristotle and Virgil; the Song of Roland, or at least the Carolingian legend;
  and was also (it is reassuring to know) very properly instructed in the
  Gospels. In a speech of great eloquence, the fox is compared to Ganelon and
  Judas Iscariot and to the Greek who betrayed Troy to its downfall. The cock's
  oration involves a deep dissertation on the reliability of Dreams, and their
  relation to the problem of freewill, fate and the foreknowledge of heaven;
  all considered with a sensitive profundity of which any chicken-run may well
  be proud. In other words, in one sense the very sense of all this is its
  nonsense; at least its aptitude is its ineptitude. It is always difficult to
  make the fable, or even the four-footed animal, go on all fours. In this case
  Chaucer does not care if his two-footed animal has a leg to stand on. It has
  to limp as well as strut; the whole fun of the fable is in its being
  lop-sided; and he only partially disguises his biped in feathers. Then, when
  the imposture is quite obvious, he delights in asserting it again, allowing,
  as it were, his cock to hide hurriedly behind the one feather it has left. I
  can imagine nothing more English, or more amusing, than this exasperating
  evasion. He launches a denunciation of Woman as the destroyer of Paradise,
  and then explains to the ladies, as with a bow and a beaming smile:</p>

  <p class="verse">If I the counsel of woman woldë blame<br>
  Pass over, for I said it in my game...<br>
  These be the cockë's wordës and not mine,<br>
  I can none harm of no woman divine.</p>

  <p>There is something intensely individual in this playing in and out of the
  curtain, and putting on and off of the feathered mask. It is all the more
  subtle because nobody who reads Chaucer as a whole will doubt that, despite
  his occasional and probably personal grumblings against some faithless or
  scornful woman, he did really have a respect for women, which was not merely
  a bow to ladies. But if there is something here of subtlety, there is also
  something here of scope or scale. There is a largeness and liberty in the
  humorist who gets such huge enjoyment out of the metaphysical chicken, and
  expands so large a world of fancy out of the little opportunity of the fable.
  That is the quality in Chaucer which I would here emphasize first, because it
  should be realized before we go on to the secondary matters of origins and
  parallels and interpretations of particular points. The mind of Chaucer was
  capacious; there was room for ideas to play about in it. He could see the
  connexion, and still more the disconnexion, of different parts of his own
  scheme, or of any scheme. In the first example of 'Sir Topas', he completes
  his own scheme with his own incompleteness. In the second example we find him
  taking the tiny opening of a trivial farmyard fable, to expand it into an
  almost cosmic comedy. He seems to see himself as a small featherless fowl
  talking about the riddle of Destiny and Deity. Both have the same quality,
  not very easy to describe, the quality by which a very great artist sometimes
  allows his art to become semi-transparent, and a light to shine through the
  shadow pantomime which makes it confess itself a shadowy thing. So
  Shakespeare, at the highest moment of two of his happiest comedies, utters
  those deep and not unhappy sayings, that the best in this kind are but
  shadows, and that we are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little
  life is rounded with a sleep. I say that this deeper note does exist in
  Chaucer, for those who will start with sufficient sympathy to listen for it,
  and not be content with some crabbed inquisition into whether he stole
  something from Petrarch or wrote something to please John of Gaunt. For one
  thing is quite certain; nobody who takes Chaucer quite so literally, I might
  say quite so seriously, will ever understand him. There is a sort of penumbra
  of playfulness round everything he ever said or sang; a halo of humour. Much
  of his work is marked by what can only be called a quiet exaggeration, even a
  quiet extravagance. It is said, in the description of him, that there was
  something elvish about his face; and there was something elvish about his
  mind. He did not object to playing a kind of delicate practical joke on the
  reader, or on the plan of the book; and all this may be summed up here, for
  convenience, under the example I have given. He did not mind making his fable
  something more than fabulous. He enjoyed giving a touch or two to the story
  of a cock and hen; that made it look like the story of a cock and bull.</p>

  <p>We shall see more of this double outlook when we come to the conjectures
  about his private life, and especially about his personal religion. For the
  moment the matter to be established is a matter of scale or size; the fact
  that we are not here dealing with a mind to be merely patronized for its
  simplicity, but with a mind that has already baffled many commentators with
  its complexity. In one sense he is taken too seriously and in the other sense
  not seriously enough. But in both senses, almost as many men have lost
  themselves in Chaucer's mind as have lost themselves in Shakespeare's. But in
  the latter case they are like children wondering what their father means; in
  the former, like beaming uncles, wondering what the child means.</p>

  <p>I mean that in the popular attitude towards Chaucer, and to some extent
  even in the more cultured criticism of him, there is a curious and rather
  comic suggestion of 'drawing him out'. I have said elsewhere that to many
  modern Englishmen a fourteenth-century Englishman would be like a foreigner.
  These modern Englishmen do really treat Geoffrey Chaucer as a foreigner. Some
  of them treat him very much as Mr. Podsnap treated the foreign gentleman. It
  will be remembered that that worthy merchant not only talked to the alien as
  if he must necessarily be slightly deaf, but as if he was in every other way
  defective, and had to have things put very plainly to him in words of one
  syllable. Yet Mr. Podsnap was really encouraging the foreign gentleman; he
  was drawing him out. Only there was a general feeling of pleased surprise
  that there was anything there to be drawn out. Chaucer is treated as a child,
  just as the foreign gentleman was treated as a child; but I am sure that
  Chaucer was quite sufficiently subtle to be as much amused at it as the
  foreign gentleman. Hence it will be generally found, even now, that anything
  like a problem or puzzle in Chaucer is approached quite differently from a
  problem or puzzle in Shakespeare. When somebody finds one of the Sonnets as
  dark as the Dark Lady, he admits that it is just possible that Shakespeare's
  mind may have been slightly superior to his own. But he has made up his mind
  that Chaucer's mind must have been more simple than his own, merely because
  Chaucer lived at the most complicated and entangled transitional time in
  European history, and drew on the traditions of about four European
  literatures instead of one. We shall get no further till we allow for this
  central and civilized character in the medieval poet; for the fact that he
  knew his philosophy; that he thought about his theology; and for the still
  more surprising fact that he saw the joke of the jokes he made, and made a
  good many more jokes than his critics have ever seen.</p>

  <p>There is indeed one character, which Chaucer shares with all the great
  ancient poets, which may in some quarters weaken his position as a great
  modern poet. There are many moderns who say that a man is not a thinker, when
  they mean he is not a freethinker. Or they say he is not a freethinker, when
  they mean that his thinking is not tied tight and fast to some special system
  of materialism. But the point I mean is much deeper than these mere quarrels
  about secularism and sectarianism. The greatest poets of the world have a
  certain serenity, because they have not bothered to invent a small
  philosophy, but have rather inherited a large philosophy. It is, nine times
  out of ten, a philosophy which very great men share with very ordinary men.
  It is therefore not a theory which attracts attention as a theory. In these
  days, when Mr. Bernard Shaw is becoming gradually, amid general applause, the
  Grand Old Man of English letters, it is perhaps ungracious to record that he
  did once say there was nobody, with the possible exception of Homer, whose
  intellect he despised so much as Shakespeare's. He has since said almost
  enough sensible things to outweigh even anything so silly as that. But I
  quote it because it exactly embodies the nineteenth-century notion of which I
  speak. Mr. Shaw had probably never read Homer; and there were passages in his
  Shakespearean criticism that might well raise a doubt about whether he ever
  read Shakespeare. But the point was that he could not, in all sincerity, see
  what the world saw in Homer and Shakespeare, because what the world saw was
  not what G. B. S. was then looking for. He was looking for that ghastly thing
  which Nonconformists call a Message, and continue to call a Message, even
  when they have become atheists and do not know who the Message is from. He
  was looking for a system; one of the very little systems that do very truly
  have their day. The system of Kant; the system of Hegel; the system of
  Schopenhauer and Nietzsche and Marx and all the rest. In each of these
  examples a man sprang up and pretended to have a thought that nobody had ever
  had. But the great poet only professes to express the thought that everybody
  has always had. The greatness of Homer does not consist in proving, by the
  death of Hector, that the Will to Live is a delusion and a snare; because it
  is not a delusion and a snare. It does not consist in proving, by the victory
  of Achilles, that the Will to Power must express itself in a Superman; for
  Achilles is not a Superman, but, on the contrary, a hero. The greatness of
  Homer consists in the fact that he could make men feel, what they were
  already quite ready to think, that life is a strange mystery in which a hero
  may err and another hero may fail. The poet makes men realize how great are
  the great emotions which they, in a smaller way, have already experienced.
  Every man who has tried to keep any good thing going, though it were a little
  club or paper or political protest, sounds the depths of his own soul when he
  hears that rolling line, which can only be rendered so feebly: 'For truly in
  my heart and soul I know that Troy will fall.' Every man who looks back on
  old days, for himself and others, and realizes the changes that vex something
  within us that is unchangeable, realizes better the immensity of his own
  meaning in the mere sound of the Greek words, which only mean, 'For, as we
  have heard, you too, old man, were at one time happy.' These words are in
  poetry, and therefore they have never been translated. But there are perhaps
  some people to whom even the words of Shakespeare need to be translated.
  Anyhow, what a man learns from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> is not a new theory of
  Sex; it is the mystery of something much more than what sensualists call Sex,
  and what cads call Sex Appeal. What he learns from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> is
  not to call first love 'calf-love'; not to call even fleeting love a
  flirtation; but to understand that these things, which a million vulgarians
  have vulgarized, are not vulgar. The great poet exists to show the small man
  how great he is. A man does not learn from Hamlet a new method of
  Psychoanalysis, or the proper treatment of lunatics. What he learns is not to
  despise the soul as small; even when rather feminine critics say that the
  will is weak. As if the will were ever strong enough for the tasks that
  confront it in this world! The great poet is alone strong enough to measure
  that broken strength we call the weakness of man.</p>

  <p>It has only been for a short time, a recent and disturbed time of
  transition, that each writer has been expected to write a new theory of all
  things, or draw a new wild map of the world. The old writers were content to
  write of the old world, but to write of it with an imaginative freshness
  which made it in each case look like a new world. Before the time of
  Shakespeare, men had grown used to the Ptolemaic astronomy, and since the
  time of Shakespeare men have grown used to the Copernican astronomy. But
  poets have never grown used to stars; and it is their business to prevent
  anybody else ever growing used to them. And any man who reads for the first
  time the words, 'Night's candles are burnt out,' catches his breath and
  almost curses himself for having neglected to look rightly, or sufficiently
  frequently, at the grand and mysterious revolutions of night and day.
  Theories soon grow stale; but things continue to be fresh. And, according to
  the ancient conception of his function, the poet was concerned with things;
  with the tears of things, as in the great lament of Virgil; with the delight
  in the number of things, as in the lighthearted rhyme of Stevenson; with
  thanks for things, as in the Franciscan Canticle of the Sun or the
  <i>Benedicite Omnia Opera</i>. That behind these things there are certain
  great truths is true; and those so unhappy as not to believe in these truths
  may of course call them theories. But the old poets did not consider that
  they had to compete and bid against each other in the production of
  counter-theories. The coming of the Christian cosmic conception made a vast
  difference; the Christian poet had a more vivid hope than the Pagan poet.
  Even when he was sometimes more stern, he was always less sad. But, allowing
  for that more than human change, the poets taught in a continuous tradition,
  and were not in the least ashamed of being traditional. Each taught in an
  individual way; 'with a perpetual slight novelty,' as Aristotle said; but
  they were not a series of separate lunatics looking at separate worlds. One
  poet did not provide a pair of spectacles by which it appeared that the grass
  was blue; or another poet lecture on optics to teach people to say that the
  grass was orange; they both had the far harder and more heroic task of
  teaching people to feel that the grass is green. And because they continue
  their heroic task, the world, after every epoch of doubt and despair, always
  grows green again.</p>

  <p>Now Chaucer is a particularly easy mark for the morbid intellectual or the
  mere innovator. He is very easily pelted by the pedants, who demand that
  every eternal poet should be an ephemeral philosopher. For there is no
  nonsense about Chaucer; there is no deception, as the conjurers say. There is
  no pretence of being a prophet instead of a poet. There is no shadow of shame
  in being a traditionalist or, as some would say, a plagiarist. One of the
  most attractive elements in the curiously attractive personality of Chaucer
  is exactly that; that he is not only negatively without pretentiousness, but
  he is positively full of warm acknowledgement and admiration of his models.
  He is as awakening as a cool wind on a hot day, because he breathes forth
  something that has fallen into great neglect in our time, something that very
  seldom stirs the stuffy atmosphere of self-satisfaction or self-worship. And
  that is gratitude, or the theory of thanks. He was a great poet of gratitude;
  he was grateful to God; but he was also grateful to Gower. He was grateful to
  the everlasting Romance of the Rose; he was still more grateful to Ovid and
  grateful to Virgil and grateful to Petrarch and Boccaccio. He is always eager
  to show us over his little library and to tell us where all his tales come
  from. He is prouder of having read the books than of having written the
  poems. This easy and natural traditionalism had become a little more
  constrained and doubtful even by the time of the Renaissance. There is no
  question of Shakespeare concealing or disguising his borrowed plots; but we
  do feel that he dealt with them as mere dead material, of no interest until
  he made it interesting. He did in a sense destroy the originals by making the
  infinitely more mighty and magnificent parodies. Even great originals sink
  under him; he comes to bury Plutarch not to praise him. But Chaucer would
  want to praise him; he always confesses a literary pleasure which may well
  conceal his literary power. He seems the less original, because he is
  concerned to praise and not merely to parody. There is nothing he likes
  better than telling the reader to read books that are not his own books; as
  when the Nun's Priest expansively refers the company to the numerous works
  dealing with the subject of Woman, which excuse him from justifying the
  sentiments of a cock or further analysing the defects of a hen. Perhaps, by
  the way, there is a Chaucerian joke, of the sort that is called sly, in
  making the Confessor of the Nuns (of all men) say that he, for his part,
  knows no harm about any woman. It is the same in any number of passages, as
  in that admirably cheerful passage that begins:</p>

  <p class="verse">A thousand timës have I heard men tell<br>
  That there is joy in heaven and pain in hell,<br>
  And I accord right well that it is so,<br>
  And yet indeed full well myself I know<br>
  That there is not a man in this countrie<br>
  That either has in heaven or hell y'be,</p>

  <p>and which goes on to explain that these things rest on Authority; and that
  we must depend on Authority for many things, especially the things of which
  we can only read in books. It is typical of the obtusity of some partisans
  that this passage has been quoted as evidence of scepticism, when it is in
  perfectly plain words a justification of faith. But the point is that Chaucer
  talks in that cheerful voice, or writes in that almost jaunty style, because
  he is not in the least ashamed of depending on 'oldë bookës', but exceedingly
  proud of it, and, above all, exceedingly pleased to testify to his own
  pleasure. This is a temper which will always seem 'unoriginal' to the
  sensational sectarian; or the quack with a new nostrum; or the monomaniac
  with one idea. Yet, as a fact of literary history, Chaucer was one of the
  most original men who ever lived. There had never been anything like the
  lively realism of the ride to Canterbury done or dreamed of in our literature
  before. He is not only the father of all our poets, but the grandfather of
  all our hundred million novelists. It is rather a responsibility for him. But
  anyhow, nothing can be more original than an origin.</p>

  <p>When we have this actual originality, and then added to it this graceful
  tone of gratitude and even humility, we have the presence of something which
  I will venture to call great. There is in the medieval poet something that
  can only be conveyed by the medieval word Largesse; that he is too hearty and
  expansive to conceal the connexion between himself and his masters or models.
  He would not stoop to ignore a book in order to borrow from it; and it does
  not occur to him to be always trying to secure the copyright of a copy. This
  is the sort of cool and contented character that looks much less original
  than it is. A man must have a balance of rather extraordinary talents, and
  even rather extraordinary virtues, in order to seem so ordinary. As they say
  of St. Peter's at Rome, it is so well proportioned that it looks almost
  small. To the eyes of sensational innovators, with their skyscraper religions
  toppling and tumbling, and conspicuous by their crazy disproportion, it does
  look very small. But it is in fact very large; and there is nothing larger in
  its way than the spirit of Chaucer, with its confession of pleasure and its
  unconsciousness of power.</p>

  <p>May I be pardoned if I insert a sort of personal parenthesis here? All
  this does not mean, what I should be the last man in the world to mean, that
  revolutionists should be ashamed of being revolutionists or (still more
  disgusting thought) that artists should be content with being artists. I have
  been mixed up more or less all my life in such mild revolutions as my country
  could provide; and have been rather more extreme, for instance, in my
  criticism of Capitalism than many who are accused of Communism. That, I
  think, is being a good citizen; but it is not being a great poet; and I
  should never set up to be a great poet on any ground, but least of all on
  that ground. A great poet, as such, deals with eternal things; and it would
  indeed be a filthy notion to suppose that the present industrial and economic
  system is an eternal thing. Nor, on the other hand, should the idea of the
  poet dealing with things more permanent than politics be confounded with the
  dirty talk of the 'nineties, about the poet being indifferent to morals.
  Morals are eternal things, though the particular political immorality of the
  moment is not eternal. Here again I can modestly claim to have cleared myself
  long ago of the horrid charge of being a True Artist. I have been mixed up in
  politics, but never in aesthetics; and I was an enthusiast for the Wearing of
  the Green, but never for the Wearing of the Green Carnation. In those days I
  even had something like a prejudice against pure Beauty; there seemed to be
  very much the wrong sort of betrothal between Beauty and the Beast. But, for
  all that, it is true that the true poet is ultimately dedicated to Beauty, in
  a world where it is cleansed of beastliness, and it is not either a new
  scheme or theory on the one hand, nor a narrow taste or technique on the
  other. It is concerned with ideas; but with ideas that are never new in the
  sense of neat, as they are never old in the sense of exhausted. They lie a
  little too deep to find perfect expression in any age; and great poets can
  give great hints of them in any. I would say no more of Chaucer than that the
  hints that he gave were great.</p>

  <p>There is at the back of all our lives an abyss of light, more blinding and
  unfathomable than any abyss of darkness; and it is the abyss of actuality, of
  existence, of the fact that things truly are, and that we ourselves are
  incredibly and sometimes almost incredulously real. It is the fundamental
  fact of being, as against not being; it is unthinkable, yet we cannot unthink
  it, though we may sometimes be unthinking about it; unthinking and especially
  unthanking. For he who has realized this reality knows that it does outweigh,
  literally to infinity, all lesser regrets or arguments for negation, and that
  under all our grumblings there is a subconscious substance of gratitude. That
  light of the positive is the business of the poets, because they see all
  things in the light of it more than do other men. Chaucer was a child of
  light and not merely of twilight, the mere red twilight of one passing dawn
  of revolution, or the grey twilight of one dying day of social decline. He
  was the immediate heir of something like what Catholics call the Primitive
  Revelation; that glimpse that was given of the world when God saw that it was
  good; and so long as the artist gives us glimpses of that, it matters nothing
  that they are fragmentary or even trivial; whether it be in the mere fact
  that a medieval Court poet could appreciate a daisy, or that he could write,
  in a sort of flash of blinding moonshine, of the lover who 'slept no more
  than does the nightingale'. These things belong to the same world of wonder
  as the primary wonder at the very existence of the world; higher than any
  common pros and cons, or likes and dislikes, however legitimate. Creation was
  the greatest of all Revolutions. It was for that, as the ancient poet said,
  that the morning stars sang together; and the most modern poets, like the
  medieval poets, may descend very far from that height of realization and
  stray and stumble and seem distraught; but we shall know them for the Sons of
  God, when they are still shouting for joy. This is something much more
  mystical and absolute than any modern thing that is called optimism; for it
  is only rarely that we realize, like a vision of the heavens filled with a
  chorus of giants, the primeval duty of Praise.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a><small>CHAPTER II</small><br>
  The Age of Chaucer</h2>

  <p class="first">One of the most necessary and most neglected points, about
  the story called history, is the fact that the story is not finished.
  Generally speaking, we do not realize a problem of the past till we realize
  it as a problem of the present, and even of the future. This is what was
  really the matter with the 'liberal' historians of the nineteenth century. No
  men talked more about the future, as something different from the past. No
  men thought less about the future, as something different from the present.
  The Victorians are somewhat excessively derided to-day, because their notion
  of a novel was a story that ended well. The real vice of the Victorians was
  that they regarded history as a story that ended well&mdash;because it ended with
  the Victorians. They turned all human records into one three-volume novel;
  and were quite sure that they themselves were the third volume. History had
  come to an end; if not to a cessation, at least to a consummation. Therefore
  their doubts about the past were easily resolved, because they were not
  really troubled by doubts about the future. Whatever had obviously led to
  their own Constitutionalism or Commercialism was good. They did not really
  ask to what their Constitutionalism and Commercialism would lead. We, on the
  other hand, know where they have already led. They have led us to where we
  are at present; and where that is, the Lord only knows.</p>

  <p>There are four facts about Chaucer, which are the four corners of the
  world he lived in; the four conditions of Christendom at the end of the
  fourteenth century. In themselves they can be stated very simply. Chaucer was
  English; at a time when the full national identity was still near its
  beginning. Chaucer was Catholic; at a time when the full Catholic unity of
  Europe was near the beginning of its end. Chaucer was chivalric, in the sense
  that he belonged, if only by adoption, to the world of chivalry and armorial
  blazonry, broadly French, when that world was in its gorgeous autumn,
  glorious with decay. Finally, Chaucer was none the less <i>bourgeois</i>, as
  our dear comrades say, in the sense that he himself was born and bred of
  burgesses, of tradesmen working under the old Guild system, also already
  rather too grand for its own good, but fresher and stronger than the fading
  feudal system. His figure bestrides the gap between these two last systems.
  It is as if he had the Trade Guild for a mother and the Order of Knighthood
  for a father.</p>

  <p>Now we cannot understand any of these things by dismissing them as dead
  things, as the nineteenth century did, and never thinking of their
  application to our own present or future. We cannot, like the Victorians,
  talk about them as if they were stone hatchets or wattle houses; things
  obviously left behind in the past. They are no longer only in the past but
  also in the future; if not as possibilities at least as comparisons. Take the
  first two together; for they were parts of one problem. If we think (and
  rightly) that Rome did not adequately realize the growth of national life in
  the north, we must still follow the idea further; at least as far as the time
  when patriotism turned into Prussianism. Quite apart from religion, we must
  realize that there was a case, and may again be a case, for Europe having a
  centre. And we must anticipate, in the future, many pathetic attempts of
  Europe to be centralized without a centre. It is the same with the two last
  as with the two first of the four conditions. We may reasonably or even
  rightly think that society was fettered by feudal heraldry; but we must
  understand exactly what we lost by losing it. Similarly, we may think that
  trade was fettered by Guilds; but our own trade is not so happy just now that
  we can forget the Guild, without understanding exactly what we lost by losing
  it. Touching all these things, we must try to imagine, not so much merely
  what is to be said for them, as what is to be said against the absence of
  them.</p>

  <p>I have therefore decided, after some doubt and reflexion, to dwell a
  little further on each of these four conditions; to dwell at what some may
  think disproportionate length on the real reason for their presence in those
  days, and the real problem of their absence in these days. All are subject to
  one formula. We have not seen the last of any of them, but if they are really
  lost in the future, it may yet turn out to be through losing the forms they
  had in the past. I will preface these four brief sketches by two
  generalizations. The great medieval civilization had already been wounded,
  perhaps mortally wounded, by two great griefs; the first material and the
  other moral. The first was the Black Death, which turned Christendom into a
  house of mourning, and had dreadful results of every kind; the worst being
  that priests became so few, and bad priests had so easily become priests,
  that the whole great Christian philosophy and morality was brought into
  contempt. The second fatality, I think, was the failure of the Crusades,
  which remained as a sort of hopeless taunt or challenge never accepted. Half
  the men of Chaucer's time were haunted by a Crusade that never happened. His
  friend Froissart tells how Bruce sent his heart to Palestine, whither he had
  failed to go; his patron Henry of Bolingbroke consoled himself by dying in
  the Jerusalem Chamber after his failure to go to Jerusalem. As will be seen
  in a moment, in more ways than one, the Crusade was a sort of dark background
  of judgment to all the bright and brittle triumphs and scandals of that
  day.</p>

  <p>First, the special spirit of Chaucer as an Englishman I have dealt with at
  length in the chapter under that name. It is only necessary to note here one
  fact that was really peculiar to England, which, unlike the Church and the
  Chivalric Orders and the Guilds, was not common to all Europe. This was the
  particular break in the history of the Plantagenets. By this time England had
  ceased to be a King and his people, and had become a group of gentlemen and
  their servants. It is but a bitter consolation to call them the best
  gentlemen and the best servants. Everywhere else, whatever was lost by the
  Pope was gained by the King. Sometimes it happened even though the King were
  a Catholic King. The French King had already made a monopoly of the Papacy;
  the Spanish King was later to attempt to make a sort of monopoly of the
  Church; and even the English King did, for a brief and brazen hour of
  triumph, become Head of the Church. But whatever happened to the English
  King, this was not what happened to the English nation. There another and
  special force was already at work, which was destined to make the triumph of
  the King as brief as it was brazen. That fact was the evolution of the
  Aristocratic State, which begins far back in Chaucer's time and before;
  chiefly by an alliance between the Barons and the great merchants of the City
  of London. It thus touches the life of Chaucer at two points, since his
  people were London traders and his patrons were, at least partly, of the
  baronial party. It was also mixed up with the problem of the peasants, or
  those who regarded themselves as peasant proprietors, while the lawyers still
  regarded them as serfs. They therefore rose in the famous Peasant Rising and
  killed the lawyers; a comprehensible and (relatively) even commendable
  course; though they also showed some disposition to hang anybody who could
  read or write; which is perhaps carrying the distrust of professionalism too
  far. But with all this Chaucer had less to do, being a Londoner and, on his
  more popular side, a son of the Guilds and not the peasantry. Nevertheless,
  it was at the Court, where he counted for a good deal, that the whole quarrel
  of kings, barons, merchants and peasants came to a crisis and a crash.</p>

  <p>The life and death of Richard the Second constitute a tragedy which was
  perhaps the tragedy of English history, and was certainly the tragedy of
  English monarchy. It is seldom seen with any clearness; because of two
  prejudices that prevent men letting in on it the disinterested daylight of
  their minds. The first is the fact that, though it happened more than five
  hundred years ago, it is still dimly felt to be a Party Question.
  Shakespeare, in the time of the Tudors, saw it as an opportunity for exalting
  a sort of Divine Right; later writers, in the time of the Georges, have seen
  in it an opportunity for depreciating Divine Right. What is much more curious
  is the fact that neither ever noticed that the unfortunate Richard did not by
  any means merely stand for Divine Right; that in his earliest days he stood
  for what we are accustomed to consider much later rights, and for some which
  were, at least relatively speaking, the rights of democracy. The origin of
  this oblivion is in the second of the two modern prejudices. It is the
  extraordinary prejudice, sometimes identified with progress, to the effect
  that the world has always been growing more and more liberal, and that
  therefore there could be no popular ideals present in earlier times and
  forgotten in later times. The case of Richard the Second might have been
  specially staged in order to destroy this delusion. He was very far from
  being a faultless sovereign; he did various things which permit modern
  Parliamentarians to represent him as a despotic sovereign; but he was, by
  comparison with many contemporaries and most successors, a democratic
  sovereign. He did definitely attempt to help the democratic movement of his
  day, and he was definitely restrained from doing so. Shakespeare is full of
  sympathy for him, but Shakespeare was not full of sympathy for what most
  modern people would find sympathetic. He does not even mention the fact that
  the prince, whom he represents as bewailing the insult to his crown, and
  appealing to the sacred immunity of his chrism, had in his youth faced a
  rabble of roaring insurgent serfs, had declared that he himself would be
  their leader, the true demagogue of their new democracy, had promised to
  grant their demands, had disputed desperately with his nobles to get those
  demands granted, and had finally been overruled and forced to abandon the
  popular cause by that very baronial insolence which soon forced him to
  abandon the throne. If we ask why the greatest of dramatists was blind to the
  most dramatic of historic scenes, the young king claiming the leadership of
  the oppressed people, the explanation is perfectly simple. The explanation is
  that the whole theory, that 'the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process
  of the suns', is all ignorant rubbish.</p>

  <p>How could the suns widen anybody's thoughts? The explanation is that the
  men of Shakespeare's time understood far less of the democratic ideal than
  the men of Chaucer's time. The Tudors were occupied in their own time, as
  Shakespeare is occupied in his great play, with the sixteenth-century
  mystical worship of The Prince. There was much more chance in the fourteenth
  century of having a mystical feeling about The People. Shakespeare's Richard
  is religious, to the extent of always calling himself The Lord's Anointed.
  The real Richard would also, very probably, have referred to the people as
  God's Flock. Ideas were mixed and misused in both periods, as in all periods;
  but in the time of Chaucer and Langland there was much more vague and general
  moral pressure upon the mind of the presence of problems of mere wealth and
  poverty, of the status of a peasant or the standards of a Christian, than
  there was in the time of Shakespeare and Spenser; of the splendour of
  Gloriana and the Imperial Votaress in the West. Therefore Shakespeare, great
  and human as he was, sees in Richard only the insulted king; and seems to
  think almost as little about the subjects of Richard as about the subjects of
  Lear.</p>

  <p><a id="pic10"

  </div>

  <p>But Richard had thought about the subjects of Richard. He had, in his
  early days and in his own way, tried to be a popular king in the sense of a
  popular leader. And though the popular ideas failed, and in some cases were
  bound to fail, they would have been much more present to the mind of a great
  writer of that time, than they were to the mind of one of the Queen's
  Servants under the last of the Tudors. In other words, even when there really
  is progress, as there certainly is growth, the progress is not a progress in
  everything, perfectly simple and universal and all of a piece. Civilizations
  go forward in some things, while they go backward in others. Men had better
  looms and steam hammers in 1850 than in 1750, but not handsomer hats and
  breeches or more dignified manners and oratory. And in the same way a man in
  the position of Shakespeare had more subtle and many-coloured arts, but not
  more simple and popular sympathies, than a man in the position of Langland.
  The Renaissance exalted the Poet, but even more it exalted the Prince; it was
  not primarily thinking about the Peasant. Therefore the greatest of all the
  great sons of the Renaissance, rolling out thousands of thunderous and
  intoxicant lines upon the single subject of the reign of King Richard the
  Second, does not trouble himself about The Peasants' War.</p>

  <p>The real stories of this world are not melodramas or fables with a moral,
  and we seldom see simple retribution for a simple crime or even simple
  martyrdom for a simple idea. Nobody maintains that Richard was dethroned on
  the direct issue of the frustrated popular sympathies of his youth; he was
  dethroned for the somewhat simpler reason that he had an unscrupulous
  relative who wanted his throne. Nor need anyone maintain that there were no
  other excuses for the dethronement; though almost certainly there was no
  other motive. But the fact remains that there did disappear, with the last
  true Plantagenet, the last true attempt of the monarch to take the side of
  the mob against the governing class; and it is certain that since that day,
  and for centuries increasingly, the mob in England has been impotent and the
  governing class has governed. A profound instinct told our modern historians
  that with the quarrel of Richard and Bolingbroke the true Party System had
  begun. They might be more or less indifferent to York and Lancaster, and
  admit that the tangle and thicket of the Wars of the Roses mostly consisted
  of thorns. But the long quarrel of English history was not between the
  Lancastrians and the Yorkists, but between the Lords and the King. Long
  before we were born the Lords had completely conquered; and the historian
  could at least see that the first blow was struck at Pomfret, three hundred
  years before the last blow was struck at Whitehall.</p>

  <p>Here is the first typical instance; showing that medieval history is
  useless unless it is modern history. The problem has remained; anyhow it has
  returned. The general view of government by a gentry, even in its best sense,
  must be affected by the present problem of whether it ought to continue;
  whether it can continue; whether a thing so undefined and atmospheric can be
  restored. It is not at all impossible that the age following Maurras and
  Mussolini may want Monarchy restored. It is one thing to tolerate the rich
  because they are gentlemen; and another to tolerate the bounders because they
  are rich. The latest phase of the thing may be seen in what is called the
  Public School tradition; the final outcome of the fact that medieval schools
  dedicated to poverty or pure learning were turned, after the Reformation,
  into the fenced training-camps of a governing class. The paradox of such a
  system, at this moment, is that it might really be easier to revive it as a
  medieval Public School than as a modern Public School. Anyhow, anybody can
  see that such associations are at the very instant of transition. The finest
  of Public School songs unconsciously confesses that even gazing at the past
  involves gazing at the future; and few will claim to know what will happen to
  that tradition, twenty or thirty or forty years on.</p>

  <p>Next, as to the religious position: put these four facts together. Chaucer
  was a perfectly orthodox Catholic, and the English had hitherto been little
  interested in the old medieval heresies. But to them the Pope had begun to
  seem faintly foreign; <i>not</i> on the theory that he was an Italian priest
  in Rome, but, on the contrary, on the theory that he was a French priest at
  Avignon. The French King had carried the Papacy there; challenging the Schism
  and almost dragging it into the French Wars. The Papacy stood, of course, for
  the international ideal; but it stood for two other things, good or bad.
  First, for the Friars and such international movements which depended
  <i>only</i> on the Papacy. Second, for more dubious 'drives' of the Charity
  Bazaar sort; not always producing (or receiving) perfect charity. Lastly,
  there was a general discontent with the <i>practical</i> Christianity of the
  time; producing Lollards, the most practical (and therefore the most stupid)
  of heretics. But most men were Reformers without being Lollards.</p>

  <p>Most wanted what was called 'a reform of the Head and Members'.
  Unfortunately too many, even at the later reforming councils of Basle and
  Constance, confined themselves rather to reforming the Head; because of the
  special horror of the two-headed monster of the Schism. It is by no means
  certain, however, that the Head was worse than the Members.</p>

  <p>It is the paradox of history that the Pope was really more important after
  the Reformation than before it. He was always important to Catholics, of
  course, as the tribunal of truth in disputed matters; but as a political and
  social figure, he really bulks bigger in the modern world than he did in the
  medieval world; at least in the later medieval world. The reason for this is
  really very reasonable. His personal position had been diminished by division
  and rivalry. But his doctrinal position was rather more clearly defined after
  it had been defied. In the scandal of the Schism there had been two or even
  three Popes; whom various nations accepted. But in the supreme struggle of
  the Reformation there was only one Pope; even if he was one whom nations
  renounced. The proceedings of the Protestant nations who renounced him made
  it quite clear, for the first time, why the earlier nations had accepted him.
  Whoever was right or wrong in the quarrel, it became perfectly clear that
  those who quarrelled with the Pope began to quarrel with the Creed. There had
  been no hint of that sort of thing in the rather squalid squabble of the
  rival Popes of the Middle Ages. The Popes might make each other look foolish,
  or denounce each other as fools; but they did not denounce the Faith as
  folly. Nobody who attacked the Pope attacked the Papacy. Still less did
  anybody attack the Papacy in the sense of attacking the Church. Thousands of
  Christians were shocked and pained at the mere fact that a false Pope could
  put himself up against a real Pope. But they would not have been shocked, but
  startled out of their wits, if one of the Popes had stood up and said there
  was no such thing as Purgatory. They would not have felt pain, they would
  have felt mortal terror at a world gone mad, if a Pope had told another Pope
  to leave off talking nonsense about prayers for the dead or praise of the
  Blessed Virgin. When the nations that had broken away from the Papacy did
  begin to say things like this, an entirely new sort of importance began to
  attach to the Papacy from which they had broken away. Even the people who
  said these things could see that fact. They could see that the Pope was now
  the power who held a whole moral and metaphysical system together; as they
  themselves had proved, by parting with him in order to found a new moral and
  metaphysical system. But in the later Middle Ages, before the break had come
  in actual ecclesiastical government, the whole situation was much more vague
  and dim. People knew that the Pope was a part of the system; but the system
  was so solid and universal that they hardly thought that anything was needed
  to be the protector of the system. We must not look therefore to men in the
  age of Chaucer for any of that sharp partisanship, any more than that sharp
  antagonism, which afterwards came to clash over the position of the Roman
  Pontiff. A man like Chaucer would most certainly have been a furious Papist,
  if he had thought that the alternative was to be a Puritan. But he lived in a
  world which had not yet even seen a real Puritan. In that world, in that
  sense, and in that sense alone, we may say that such a man felt himself
  rather as a Catholic than as a Papist. He had no notion of what results would
  follow a real split in Christendom; for since the beginnings of such a split
  had been stopped by St. Dominic, in the Albigensian affair, there had never
  been anything to suggest such a catastrophe to such a Catholic layman. But
  the Catholic layman, especially the good Catholic layman, was very far from
  happy. He knew that things were going wrong; he knew that the Church ought to
  put them right; but he did not look at the Pope to put them right precisely
  as a Catholic would look to-day: and that all the less, in Chaucer's case,
  because the Pope was a prisoner of the French King&mdash;as Chaucer had been; the
  prisoner of an enemy.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, however, the Pope had long appeared to Europe in another aspect
  that had nothing to do with his theological authority, but which was destined
  more than any other accident to precipitate the disaster. He wanted to
  collect money for various objects; many of them normal, some of them rather
  of the Renaissance type of ambition; like that which was destined later on to
  bring about the break in Germany: the building of St. Peter's. The trouble
  was not so much what he was doing as the way in which the thing was done. The
  shortest way of describing it is to say, in modern language, that the Papacy
  condescended to employ up-to-date methods of Advertisement. It put its trust
  in people who professed to be a sort of Publicity Experts. In the religious
  atmosphere of the time, it took the form of going about delivering ranting
  sermons about the Indulgences attached to works of piety and charity; and
  then sending round the hat in the usual rather vulgar fashion. But the
  trouble with these men, as with many Publicity Experts, was that there was
  nothing pious or charitable about <i>them</i>. They were only expert&mdash;and
  vulgar. It constantly happens, even now, when good people are so silly as to
  trust merely capable people. These hustling advertising agents dragged
  religion in the mire; but they got the money. But the root of the whole evil
  was there. It was that they had not been chosen as priests or preachers, not
  even as fanatical priests or preachers, but as what the Americans would call
  live wires and go-getters. These in turn doubtless produced a rabble of
  imitators of yet more ragged reputation, touts and cheapjacks entirely
  irresponsible, but familiarizing everybody with the idea of making the Faith
  a stunt or (worse still) a business proposition. The contempt that normal
  Catholics felt for all this is written in red-hot letters in Chaucer's
  account of the Pardoner.</p>

  <p>When Chaucer says, in his vivid way, that the Pardoner had pardon 'brought
  from Rome all hot', he means what moderns call Hustle. But during part of
  this period, there was another problem. Rome was not always situated in Rome.
  The Pope of Avignon was rather unfairly regarded as a Frenchman because he
  was a prisoner of the French. Often, of course, he was a Frenchman&mdash;for the
  same reason. Chaucer's great contemporary Petrarch felt the scandal, though
  not from the English standpoint, like Chaucer. Petrarch also had his quarrel
  with the 'French' Popes. He was perhaps most famous, after his love for
  Laura, for his lamentations over Babylon; which was his polite name for the
  city of Avignon, the French exile of the Roman Pontiffs. Critics are
  beginning to be rather more reasonable in discriminating, if not
  discrediting, the religious denunciations of particular partisans in the
  Middle Ages. We should allow for the fact that Petrarch was a little partial
  to Laura; and we may well allow that he was not entirely impartial about
  Avignon. The time has gone by when any poet denouncing any Pope was assumed
  to have the gift of Infallibility. Something may be discounted in the
  invectives of Dante; more in the invectives of Petrarch; and something (which
  concerns us more closely here) in the invectives of Chaucer, not indeed
  against any Pope or Anti-Pope, but against certain religious groups or
  parties which were really, though only relatively, connected with the
  Papacy.</p>

  <p>It is a commonplace that Chaucer makes fun of the Friar. Chaucer makes fun
  of so many people, that I always doubted whether we could lean so heavily as
  the learned do on the political or partisan significance of his satire. Still
  it may well be that, like Langland, he was of the party opposed to the
  Friars, probably because his sympathies were with the ordinary village
  priests. What is not so fully understood is that this question also was
  indirectly connected with the undercurrent of quarrel about the Popes. Men
  criticized the Roman officialism in many matters in which it was really
  wrong. But it is typical of its history that it was even then criticized,
  more severely, for an attitude in which it was right. It is impracticable to
  discuss fully here the merits of the quarrel about the Friars. There is a
  merely traditional anecdote that Chaucer, in early youth, was fined for
  fighting with a friar and knocking him about in Fleet Street. There is no
  historical proof of it; but, if it were true, it would be possible that his
  aversion to the friar in the story was as personal and accidental as his
  aversion to the friar in the street. Shakespeare is admitted to have been
  very fond of friars, even by those who regard him as an emancipated
  Englishman of the Elizabethan settlement. Chaucer is recognized as having
  uttered very violent and outspoken criticism of friars, even by those who
  regard him as the slave of a superstition that silences every criticism. It
  is perfectly possible that there were merely personal affections or aversions
  in both cases; and it is as likely that Chaucer was wrong as that Shakespeare
  was right. But many of the learned have thrown themselves into the quarrel
  with all the fury of Chaucer attacking the friar in Fleet Street; and have
  done their best to reproduce the edifying quarrel of the Frere and the
  Sompnour, in the interests of England or of Rome. As I say, these large
  historical matters cannot be adequately considered here. But in so far as we
  do consider them, it had better be upon principles that are really historical
  and really large.</p>

  <p>The Sompnour, or Summoner, is an official of the ecclesiastical court, and
  he stands in this story for the ecclesiastical authorities actually ruling
  England, from the Archbishop of Canterbury downwards. The Frere, or Friar,
  stands for the Dominican and Franciscan Orders, of preaching and begging
  brethren, who claimed freedom from local jurisdictions and appealed direct to
  the Pope. It is always assumed that Chaucer was entirely on the side of the
  former, mainly because he makes a more or less amusing figure of the Friar.
  The argument might well be turned the other way; for he makes a most
  horrifying and revolting figure of the Summoner. Many a man would prefer to
  be satirized as the Friar, with his popularity and athletic prowess, his
  strong white neck and eyes twinkling like frosty stars, rather than to be
  championed in the person of the Summoner with his red eruptive visage, and
  pimples and rank onion-laden breath. If Chaucer really was championing the
  Church authorities of England against foreign friars, he seems to have chosen
  a queer sort of champion. But I have myself a dark suspicion that Chaucer was
  writing a poem, and especially telling a story; and that to him as an artist
  the vivid and coloured figures of the Summoner and the Friar were of much
  more importance than the interests they represented in ecclesiastical law.
  Nevertheless, as I have said, it is well to see the ecclesiastical and social
  situation in the large, if we see it at all. There were two sides to the
  dispute between the Friars and the national or parochial clergy, and there is
  one side that is almost entirely neglected and never certainly
  emphasized.</p>

  <p>It will be found again and again, in ecclesiastical history, that the new
  departure, the daring innovation, the progressive party, depended directly on
  the Pope. It was naturally more or less negatively resisted by the bishops,
  the canons, the clergy in possession under political and patriotic
  settlements. Official oligarchies of that sort generally do resist reform and
  experiment, either rightly or wrongly. It is no more peculiar to Catholics
  than to an Anglican Archdeacon talking about Bolshevism or a Baptist in
  Tennessee talking about Negro Education. But whenever there appeared, in
  Catholic history, a new and promising experiment, bolder or broader or more
  enlightened than existing routine, that movement always came to be identified
  with the Papacy; because the Papacy alone upheld it against the resisting
  social medium which it rent asunder. So, in the present case, it was really
  the Pope who upheld St. Francis and the popular movement of the Friars. So,
  in the sixteenth century, it was really the Pope who upheld St. Ignatius
  Loyola and the great educational movement of the Jesuits. The Pope, being the
  ultimate court of appeal, cannot for shame be a mere expression of any local
  prejudice; this may easily be strong among local ecclesiastics, without any
  evil intention; but the remote arbiter at Rome must make some attempt to keep
  himself clear of it. Thus arises the situation of which Chaucer very possibly
  complained, of which many in Chaucer's time certainly complained; that a
  particular set of men, more recent or less rooted than the parish clergy,
  talked as if they were the Pope's pet children, and need take no notice of
  anybody but him. Anybody can see that this could be an irritating attitude;
  but there were two sides to the question. The Friars or the Jesuits were
  partly irritating because they were innovating, and in many matters,
  especially at the beginning, improving. And the Pope often supported the
  improvement, because he alone was independent and strong enough to do so. The
  Pope was often very much in advance of the Church, as the Encyclical on
  Labour of Pope Leo XIII would have been very much in advance of many
  reactionary bishops and priests of his time. Protestants will not damage
  their Protestantism by understanding that for Catholics, in history, the Pope
  is a <i>leader</i> as well as a ruler.</p>

  <p>By the time of Chaucer, indeed, it is likely enough that the movement of
  Dominic and Francis had passed its best period; and that the popular Friars
  were sometimes unpopular, with the people as well as the priests. It is quite
  probable; but the poet's personal jokes against friars do not prove it.
  Chaucer was no more certainly justified in abusing the friars in poetry than
  in belabouring the friar in Fleet Street; in both cases we should need to
  know a little more of the facts; a little more about the friars&mdash;and the
  friar. But it is worth while to note that Rome had originally supported an
  innovation in supporting the Friar; as later a less worthy innovation in
  supporting the Pardoner. Both came from Rome being in the centre of
  civilization and readier for new notions than the provinces were. If this was
  so about ideas that really were new, like those of St. Francis, it is the
  more obvious about ideas like the unity of nations, that never were
  new&mdash;except to very new people.</p>

  <p>The international ideal, which seems so very modern to the moderns, was of
  course very ancient to the Popes. They had originally risen in a cosmopolitan
  community, covering the civilized world, and their real mistake was that they
  thought the world was more international than it was. But this is not a
  mistake of barbaric bigotry; it rather amounted to thinking the world more
  enlightened than it was. Anyhow, the misunderstanding between the national
  and international ideas had begun long before; even in the time of the
  English discontent about Peter's Pence. France, the first of the entirely
  national nations, had been responsible for the prolonged insult of Avignon.
  The monstrous progeny of Anti-Popes had been born largely out of the
  readiness of rival kingdoms to back rival Pontiffs. The nations, for good or
  evil, were becoming themselves; and it would doubtless have been better if
  the Popes had understood the process. But it is far from self-evident that
  the process was entirely what we now call a progress.</p>

  <p>In any case, we have seen that the Church was heavily weakened by these
  three calamities. The Black Death which decimated the priesthood, leaving
  hardly enough priests to go round and admitting a good many who had much
  better not have gone round. The captivity of the Pope, who seemed to be in
  the pocket of the French King, and was defied by other Popes supported by
  other kings. And the uneasy conscience and general depression following on
  the failure of the Crusade. In this spiritual desert it was natural that
  there should appear prophets, whether we call them fanatics or reformers; and
  to some extent at least they were supported by a general discontent. It is
  very difficult to be fair to them to-day; because their ghosts have been set
  to lead armies that they never led, and would probably have refused to lead.
  Anybody who was born within three hundred years either way, of the one great
  crack or explosion of the sixteenth century, is dragged out of his grave to
  demonstrate as a Protestant or Papist, and carry a banner in a triumph of St.
  Bartholomew or the Boyne. Men like Wycliffe, living in Chaucer's time, had no
  notion of such things. They probably began by feeling a quite comprehensible
  sympathy with the hard-worked village priests, as against the monks, whose
  life should mean contemplation, and often did mean contemplation, but
  obviously might mean idleness. Whenever it really meant contemplation, it
  meant incessant activity. Generations before, the Friars had thus rebelled
  against the Monks; now a new school of Simple Preachers was rebelling against
  the Friars. But for events utterly different in origin, the Simple Preachers
  might have been absorbed by Christendom like the Friars&mdash;and later had the
  honour of being denounced as decadent like the Friars. But there was another
  difference: and it did arise partly from the operation of a very ordinary
  human weakness.</p>

  <p>Some historical critics seem to express a faint surprise that a number of
  people were sympathetic with Wycliffe up to a certain point, and then lost
  their sympathy with him. There is supposed to be a vague savour of this in a
  whole group, which included a gentleman named Chaucer (with whom we are more
  immediately concerned); another literary man like Langland; a great lord like
  John of Gaunt; possibly even a King like Richard the Second. Various
  explanations have been offered of this change or chill in their relations to
  the reformers. John of Gaunt was one of those rather dangerous aristocrats
  who have too much activity for their intelligence; and, being rather stupid,
  probably prided himself on being broadminded. It is said that he felt a faint
  coolness creeping over his sympathy with the New Movement, when the peasants
  in revolt took particular care to burn down his own palace. Reasons far less
  reasonable have been alleged for the fine distinction which others drew
  between Wycliffe the reformer and Wycliffe the theologian. Many explanations
  are indeed possible; but I would timidly suggest this possibility; that men
  like Chaucer and Langland may have supported Wycliffe to some extent in
  practice, and then repudiated him more completely in theory, for a particular
  reason of their own. The reason was (odd as it will sound in modern ears)
  that they supported him when he was right and repudiated him when he was
  wrong.</p>

  <p>Wycliffe was only one example of a man who yields to a temptation, which
  few reformers have been sufficiently clear-headed to resist. He became so
  irritated with the fact that the Idea was badly carried out in practice, that
  at last he was weak enough to turn and attack the Idea in theory. The idea
  that God gives Himself to mankind in the Blessed Sacrament has nothing to do
  with the fact that some particular priests are fools or knaves, or ignorant
  or incompetent for their office. Wycliffe began by objecting to the latter
  condition, to which Chaucer and Langland, and probably John of Gaunt, equally
  and rightly objected. But there is here some haunting temptation which
  perpetually betrays reformers. It betrays the reformers of modern as of
  medieval times. It is as applicable to the idea of property as to the idea of
  priesthood; to the Married State as to the Mass. In a dark hour, poor
  Wycliffe seems to have tried, though very vaguely, to apply it to the Mass.
  Therefore we find him splitting hairs about Transubstantiation, which was
  much less logical than splitting heads with bills and axes, like the sane
  though savage peasants. The logical, or rather illogical, process is
  perfectly simple and perfectly familiar. A man sets out to distribute Milk to
  mothers or families or the whole community. He very soon discovers that
  distribution is not so easy as it looks. Before long he is perfectly familiar
  with the fact of people intercepting milk, stealing milk, making a corner in
  milk, adulterating milk, poisoning milk. He is very naturally in a rage,
  which verges on a revolutionary rage; nor is he wrong in proposing even
  precipitate and violent action against those who swindle about milk or poison
  milk. But there always comes a time when he is tempted to turn, in a towering
  passion, and say, 'There shall be no Milk.' That is what happened at the
  Reformation. That is what happens in nearly every revolution. That is why
  modern revolutionists want to destroy the household because of the housing
  shortage; or abolish private property because most people have not got enough
  of it.</p>

  <p>There is therefore nothing to be deduced from the fact, if it be a fact,
  that Chaucer sympathized with the Wycliffites in matters of discipline, but
  abjured them in matters of doctrine, except the fact (otherwise already
  familiar) that Chaucer had a clear head. But it has some relation to the
  general thesis of this book; that he also had a clear philosophy. That
  philosophy was a Christian philosophy, and all the more so because it had
  been mixed in the original Christian fashion with many Pagan influences. What
  is not sufficiently realized is that this Christian philosophy, even in the
  Middle Ages, could be, and was, a cool and well-balanced philosophy. The true
  meaning of the importance of Boethius has not been seen. There is a truth,
  perhaps unconscious, in Chaucer's use of the phrase about 'the feathers of
  philosophy'. His own touch was as light as a feather; but the feather came
  truly from an angel's wing.</p>

  <p>It is the same with Chivalry: the long shadow falling on the fourteenth
  century from the Crusade. What we call militarism was almost unknown to
  medievalism. But that is partly because what we call militarism depends on
  most people being unmilitary. Medieval kings seldom possessed what was
  afterwards called a standing army; in the sense of a professional specialist
  army. Nevertheless, away at the back of all that was medieval was a sort of
  half-forgotten foundation which was military. This arose from two facts, far
  back in the beginning; first, that when Rome itself collapsed it left a
  number of garrisons and military outposts, to be the nuclei of national and
  local recovery; and second, that this world, when it began to recover, was
  suddenly invaded and almost vanquished by Islam; so that it could think of
  nothing but swords and spears for nearly a thousand years. One result was
  that the social <i>formation</i> remained military. The standing army soon
  became a very standing-at-ease army, and later, so to speak, a sitting army
  or even a sleeping army. But the system of subordination and obedience had
  been originally military. European aristocracy was a military hierarchy; just
  as Indian aristocracy was a religious hierarchy. The Duke is the
  Commander-in-Chief; the Marquis is the Warden of the Marches; the Knight is
  the Cavalry soldier; the Squire is the shield-bearer, and so on. These local
  commands, mixed with the Pagan legacy of slavery and modified by the family
  sentiment of Christianity, had produced what we call the feudal system. As a
  whole, these local commands tended to gather round certain central commands,
  some eight or ten of them in Western Europe, which were called monarchies.
  But even in France, where the monarchy was most centralized, there had been a
  time when the great Dukes had been too strong for it; and in England the
  great Dukes overthrew it. Apart from this, however, a change had passed over
  all that chivalry and aristocracy; a change vividly visible in Chaucer's
  time, as compared with the time of its original beginnings in the Roman Camp
  or the early medieval Crusade.</p>

  <p>The crucial phrase 'bearing arms' had begun to shift its emphasis from the
  notion of carrying weapons to the notion of carrying coats of arms. This is
  far from meaning that men did not fight. They fought in the wars between
  England and France in Chaucer's time. They fought even more in the wars
  between England and England just after Chaucer's time. But it might fairly be
  said that, where the first medieval men had fought for a cross or a creed,
  the later medieval men actually fought for a coat of arms. The French Wars
  were heraldic wars; fought upon a point of pedigree; ending in the quartering
  of the Leopards and the Lilies. The Wars of the Roses were heraldic wars;
  also fought upon a point of pedigree; ending characteristically in the Tudor
  Rose parti-coloured, parti-per-pale. But there was a collateral effect of all
  this, of which a word must be said, if we are to realize the peculiar rich
  autumnal atmosphere of the Chaucerian epoch. There went side by side with the
  exaggeration of heraldry, an exaggeration of costume; a fantasy in coats as
  well as in coats of arms. The figures of the lords standing round the long
  sunset of the splendour of Edward the Third, the lords who were to rebel
  against his heir, have indeed something of the burning but decaying colour of
  the sunset clouds. There is doubtless something ominous and unnatural,
  especially in the lurid light of later disasters, about those toppling
  headdresses, those sleeves slashed into points like plumes, those crazily
  curling shoes; like the outlines of prehistoric birds or fabulous beasts
  rather than men. Nevertheless, there was another side to the matter, and if
  we are to understand Chaucer, we must try to sympathize with something that
  is behind such heraldry, and even such fantasy; something that was
  universally taken for granted in the fourteenth century; something that has
  been almost entirely forgotten by the twentieth.</p>

  <p>I have remarked elsewhere on a common saying; supposed to be shrewd and
  realistic and rational; actually shallow and ignorant and totally false. I
  mean the statement that modern people think modern dress ugly, only because
  all people have always thought contemporary dress ugly. If I find less than
  perfect loveliness in a billy-cock hat, it is insisted that Garrick thought
  the same about a three-cornered hat; that Van Dyck thought the same about a
  Van Dyck hat; and Chaucer the same about a hood. It is enough to answer that
  Garrick did not think it odd to act Roman or Romantic heroes in his own
  clothes; that Van Dyck <i>did</i> think the Van Dyck costume beautiful, as
  anybody can tell to whom paint is plain like print; and that there is not a
  line or a word to suggest that Chaucer as a poet thought that there was
  anything particularly unpoetical about his own clothes. The truth is (as I
  have shown in another place) that nobody until the nineteenth century, and
  the ugly industrial revolution, ever did think that there was anything
  particularly unpoetical about his own clothes. All of them, without
  exception, would paint the Twelve Apostles, or even the Greek gods, in what
  were for them modern clothes. We have thought our modern clothes ugly, simply
  because our modern clothes have been ugly; and it does credit to our taste.
  But the real point to grasp about the costume of another period, such as that
  of the later Middle Ages, is not so much aesthetic as moral. The ultimate
  justification of heraldry, even in its extravagant decline, lay in the fact
  that it was a sort of pattern or standard of significance, by which even
  slighter and more trivial things tended to be significant. And this fact was
  not a little helpful, to a humane and humorous writer, in the matter of
  really enjoying the costumes and customs of his own time.</p>

  <p>This truth runs like an ornamental design through the whole of the
  Canterbury Pilgrimage, and especially the Prologue to the Pilgrimage. Sir
  Walter Scott was accused of antiquarian antics, when he dwelt on the details
  of badge or baldrick worn by the minor vassals of Marmion. He was accused of
  being pompously poetical about trifles, merely because they were the trifles
  of a previous age. But Chaucer has just as much pomp and poetry about the
  trifles of his own age. He has no difficulty in making poetry out of them,
  but it is only fair to say that they really are poetical. Everybody who has
  seen medieval pictures knows how beautiful and balanced a colour scheme can
  depend on those stiff attitudes or flat perspectives; and the Prologue is,
  among other things, a medieval picture of exactly that type. We can all see,
  as clearly as a child sees the figures in a toy theatre, the Yeoman in his
  green coat and hood and his great silver clasp of St. Christopher, and his
  quiver of arrows plumed with peacock-feathers; the Wife of Bath with her
  scarlet stockings and hat as large as a target; the Squire with his long
  sleeves powdered with a pattern of red and white flowers like a meadow, and
  hair curled close as in a press; the Shipman with his brown sunburnt face and
  his dagger hanging round his neck and armpit on a string, whose beard had
  been shaken in tempests from Hull to Carthage; the Franklin with his sanguine
  complexion and beard white as a daisy, with his white silk pouch and
  prosperous philosophy of Epicurus; the Summoner with the gigantic garland on
  his head, which seems to give an additional frightfulness to his 'fire-red
  cherubim's face', of which children were frightened. All this description is
  in the true sense imaginative. But Chaucer was doing what a great poet does;
  he was imagining what he saw. Certainly there is no artistic suggestion of
  his despising what he saw. I mean that, in the moral sense, he despised many
  of the vices of many of the characters; but he did not in an artistic sense
  despise their emblems and externals, as unsuited to serious art. Above all,
  he enjoyed them even more as emblems than as externals. And with that we
  encounter a medieval idea which students of Chaucer must consider with some
  sympathy, but which is seldom considered with even reasonable justice.</p>

  <p>I for one should be the last to wish to see such things as Sumptuary Laws
  restraining the liberty of the citizen. It is true that the men who suffered
  the old Sumptuary Laws would have thought their King had gone raving mad, if
  he had suddenly risen up and forbidden anybody to drink ale, as does the
  President of the modern American democracy. It is far more of an interference
  with liberty to veto a man's drink, which he consumes in his private house,
  than to limit the choice of his dress, in which he walks down the public
  street. Nevertheless, I should rejoice in being free alike from the medieval
  rules about dress and the modern rules about drink. Yet I doubt if there is
  any free-minded and imaginative man, looking at the modern world, who has not
  sometimes wished that there were some way of ordering the externals of life,
  so as to make them appropriate; and, above all, so as to make them
  expressive. The garments and attributes of the Canterbury Pilgrims are
  expressive. They express what the people are; they express what the poet
  means. It may be very dreadful that a Knight should bear arms (and we have the
  assurance of Mrs. Wiffle that this is the case); it may be very luxurious of
  the young Squire to have flowers embroidered all over his coat; and Chaucer
  is obviously chaffing him, to some extent, upon his foppishness. But the arms
  do express the Knight and the flowers do express the Squire. When such
  flowers were dotted all over the flowered waistcoat of a fat stockbroker in
  1860, who read <i>The Times</i> and talked about the danger of Puseyites in
  the Protestant Church of England, the flowers did not express anything at
  all. They did not make us think that the stockbroker was like a flower; or
  even, in Chaucer's phrase, that he was like a meadow.</p>

  <p>In short, if we ever did want Sumptuary Laws, it would not be so much
  against waste of money as against waste of work; waste of art, waste of
  effect, waste of colour and design. It is not that we dislike colour, but
  that we should rather like a language of colours; not that we dislike design,
  but that we should like designs to appear by design, and not by accident. I
  confess, though I am as fond of the colour of life as another, I have
  sometimes had a weird complex of thoughts on seeing a dull dumpy woman, with
  an expressionless face, approaching me in a hat or coat of flaming crimson
  like a tremendous Turner sunset. I feel inclined to ask her, as if she were
  at a masquerade ball, what she is meant to be. Perhaps I do her a wrong.
  Perhaps she glows within with so glorious a charity, that she has a right to
  robe herself as the Rose of the World. Perhaps she has merely brooded on
  burning wrongs till she is ready to set fire to London and burn it to ashes.
  That would be quite a reasonable explanation. But short of that, I have a
  sort of Sumptuary feeling, that it is a waste of red; a waste of blood and
  fire; a waste of the most glorious colour God has given to our eyes. Now when
  those red robes are hung on a Cardinal, or even on a soldier or a judge, they
  do have this extra glow or intensity of having a meaning. And that is because
  the custom which clothes such figures is inherited from the old system of
  symbolism; and that system of symbolism ran through the whole system of
  medievalism. Chaucer's coloured figures are all the more coloured, because
  their colours mean something, as do the colours of heraldry. But that system,
  of which heraldry was the stamp, is so remote from us that it is necessary to
  go through all this explanation and argument in order to begin to see what it
  meant to medieval men. There are different sorts of freedom and even of
  comfort. And there is such a thing as a coat that fits because it is fitting.
  A Friar feels freer in a Friar's gown; as a man feels freer in a man's
  body.</p>

  <p>When once we realize that heraldry was not a mummery or even a mystery;
  but a meaning part of a passion for significance which made all colours,
  stones, planets, beasts and flowers emblematic to the medieval mind, we may
  go on to agree that heraldry badly wanted pruning by the time of Edward the
  Third. If the twelfth century was the medieval spring, and the thirteenth the
  medieval summer, the fourteenth was a sort of rank and overgrown autumn that
  was already menaced by the crooked and cruel fifteenth century; in the north
  at least, very truly, the 'winter of our discontent'. The costumes of the
  rich, which had already become fanciful, became utterly fantastic; and that
  with something that was already sinister as well as fantastic: Chaucer's
  Parson denounces the motley figures of contemporary fops, striped and cut up
  into patterns, by saying that they look as if they were blasted white or
  yellow or red by leprosies and loathsome plagues. It was not for nothing that
  the popular preachers denounced the horned and towering headdresses of great
  ladies as toppling travesties of the horns of Satan. It is true that the
  Court looked gay, and also true that there was already something ghastly
  about its gaiety. Its fine French dances had already something of the Dance
  of Death, and indeed the Black Death had already led the world a dance. It
  was in this world, in which the chivalric civilization of the fourteenth
  century was already passing into the cynicism of the fifteenth, that Geoffrey
  Chaucer had to live his life, in frequent contact with the Court and complete
  familiarity with the systems of heraldry and precedence. These things were,
  in the eyes of many of his contemporaries, by far the chief affairs of his
  time. They were to that age what Aviation, Breaking the World Record,
  Swimming the Atlantic, or any use of science for the purpose of speed, are to
  ours. Some followed them with an excitement quite superficial; others saw
  them as more or less significant; but they filled the landscape, as Push and
  Publicity now fill the land and sea and sky. It is only fair to remember that
  to this period belong many really graceful and worthy stories of dignity and
  delicacy of behaviour, like that of the Black Prince, when he acted as a
  servant to his royal captive. It is quite a mistake to suppose that such
  things were insincere; but it is quite valid to say they were not
  inconsistent, for instance, with the Black Prince sacking a city in the blind
  rage of a sick man. What is much more to the point, it may be noted that
  courtesy and conquest were alike shown in a purely dynastic, that is, a
  purely family war; a family quarrel dividing the great family of
  Christendom.</p>

  <p>There is one very strange fact, which a few have noticed, about the figure
  of the Knight in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>. It may be an accident; but,
  like some other accidents, it is as awful as an omen. The obvious point to be
  made about the Knight is that he has won great glory in battle; and the poet
  makes the point quite clear. The obvious example of winning glory in battle,
  in the poet's own period, was winning glory in the French campaign, on the
  fields of Crécy and Poictiers. But the poet seems actually to take a detour
  in order to avoid the fields of Crécy and Poictiers. The poet himself had
  been distinguished in the contemporary foreign fuss; the tourney between St.
  Denis and St. George. But the Knight has had nothing to do with pitting St.
  Denis against St. George. Chaucer goes out of his way to say that his hero
  has fought for the Cross and not the Crown. He has fought against the heathen
  in Prussia (which some might indeed call an omen), but anyhow he has only
  fought against the heathen; and to such a company Prussia was as remote as
  Palestine. Indeed, it is all very remote; and apparently deliberately remote.
  The last great war had been between the English and the French. The next
  great war was to be between the English and the English. But the noblest
  Pilgrim of the great Pilgrimage has only heard of a war between the Crescent
  and the Cross. He comes from the ends of the earth; from those ultimate
  enmities in which Christianity is in collision with the things really outside
  itself. He is the ghost of a grander Europe; of that first De Montfort, with
  the fixed fanatical eyes, who rode away from the Fourth Crusade because he
  would not war with Christian men; of that last of the Nine Worthies, who
  declared that no man must wear a crown of gold, where God had worn a crown of
  thorns.</p>

  <p>Therefore the Knight is of a larger make or framework than the rest; and
  throws a sort of giant shadow on the coloured crowd; a shadow almost of
  shame. But the shadow lies also on us and on our children. It is a problem of
  the present and even more of the future, whether we can make even so large a
  commonwealth of nations as combined in the Crusade. But if this is true of
  the significance of the Knights, it is even truer of the Guildsmen or the
  Burgesses. The point is that, looking into the fog of the future, we may see
  figures losing their <i>identity</i>; as the eventual result of having lost
  the Crest and the Trade Mark. Here indeed is the vital example of this long
  and difficult preface; on the need of seeing medieval things as living (or
  dying) modern things. Blake said that Chaucer numbered the types of men as
  Linnaeus numbered the plants. But he was a mystic and not a prophet. Most
  normal men suppose these types to be normal. But in truth the Types are
  Trades; and the Trades are Guilds. Destroy the Guild and you destroy the
  natural classification of men. This appears vividly in the great Chaucerian
  characters. For Chaucer himself was a child of the old Craft and Mystery. And
  to men to-day the Mystery is a Mystery indeed.</p>

  <p>There exists a misunderstanding rather than a quarrel about medieval and
  modern ideas; because the two do not meet on the same plane. The medieval
  world, with all its crimes and crudities, was intensely concerned with ideas
  as ideas; and not in the least concerned with them as medieval ideas. But the
  moderns, and especially the modernists, are intensely concerned with the fact
  that modern ideas are modern. They are sometimes so much excited about it
  that they neglect to make them anything like ideas. I know some very learned
  writers on the Middle Ages, whose heads are so constructed as not to permit
  the entrance even of the idea of an idea. The modern world has immeasurably
  surpassed the medieval world in organization and the application of such
  ideas as it has; so that the general improvement in certain kinds of
  humanity, certain kinds of instruction, and certain kinds of arbitration and
  order, is not merely an idea, but a material fact. But that does not alter
  the moral fact; that when we compare medieval ideas with modern ideas, we
  often find that the modern ideas are comparatively hasty, superficial or
  unbalanced; or else that the ideas, as ideas, really do not exist at all.
  There could not be a better example than the comparison between the
  <i>idea</i> of Guilds with the <i>fact</i> of Capitalism. The idea of Guilds
  was worked out very narrowly and imperfectly; and the fact of Capitalism may
  work out, at least in the opinion of some, more practically and prosperously.
  But there <i>was</i> an idea of Guilds; and there is not and never was any
  idea in Capitalism. Nobody knew where it came from; nobody especially wanted
  it to come. Nobody knew where it was going to; and at this moment it appears
  to be going straight to sheer strangling Monopoly and then to bankruptcy.</p>

  <p>Nobody understands the modern world who does not realize this primary
  truth. The modern world began with the problem of the grocer and the grocer's
  assistant. It is in fact ending with a vast growth of grocers' assistants and
  no grocer. It must still be emphasized, obvious as it is, that the grocers'
  assistants have not <i>grown</i> into grocers. They have all remained
  assistants; only, instead of assisting a humble human grocer, with a soul to
  be saved, they are assisting the International Stores or the Universal
  Provision Department. In other words, the servants have not become masters,
  and will never have the faintest chance of becoming masters. They remain
  servants; only they are like those slaves that were held to public service in
  pagan antiquity; they have personal servants over them, but only an
  impersonal master overall. Now, very broadly, one idea in the Guild is that
  the grocer's assistant should grow into a grocer. For that purpose, it is
  obviously necessary to preserve a large number of equal and independent
  grocers. It is necessary to prevent these grocers from being bought out or
  sold up by the Stores or the Super-Grocer. With this object the Guild
  deliberately checked certain forms of competition, protected the weaker
  brethren; and, preserved the Types that seem eternal in Chaucer's Tales.</p>

  <p>Now to anybody who knows an idea when he sees it, it is relatively
  irrelevant whether the application of this idea be patchy or imperfect, at
  any particular period. It is not patchy and imperfect, but very nearly
  non-existent, in our own period. But the point is in the clear comprehension
  of the idea. If there had been only one Guild, instead of scores and
  hundreds, it would still have stood for one medieval idea and not for the
  other modern idea. If its benefits had only been extended to two Guildsmen,
  they would still have been benefited in a particular way, and according to an
  idea other than the idea of modern competition or modern monopoly. Chaucer
  mentions several Master Craftsmen, evidently attached to a Guild, as going on
  his Canterbury Pilgrimage; he mentions, for instance, a Dyer and a worker in
  tapestry. If we compare the first with the huge development of the modern Dye
  Industry, we shall recognize at once the main distinction I mean. More and
  more people may have come to work in dye factories; more and more processes
  may have been invented; more marvellous as a matter of science, though often
  much less marvellous as a matter of art. And although for some time the logic
  of Capitalism produced worse and worse conditions, the wisdom of Capitalists
  (following on the courage of Trades Unionists) may now produce (or pretend to
  produce) better and better conditions. But they produce better and better
  conditions for servants; they do not attempt to produce a Guild, which is a
  fraternity of masters. And if we wish to consider the idea itself, clear of
  all these muddled bickerings about 'medievalism', we cannot do better than
  take the example of a trade which does still exist to-day, in something
  resembling the guise and function which it had in the days of Chaucer.</p>

  <p>There rode in the cavalcade to Canterbury, along with the Dyer, the more
  conspicuous figure of the Doctor. He is conspicuous even in a literary sense;
  for he is picked out in colours that are still clear and fresh; a striking
  and almost startling example of Chaucer's power of describing a complete and
  even complex personality in a few lines. His combination of rich and
  impressive dress with cautious and hygienic diet is a calculation from two
  angles finding the exact point of a personality. He was particular that his
  food should be nourishing and digestible, but took it in small quantities;
  and though he did not talk about proteids and vitamins, he probably talked in
  some similar terms from the same learned language. The moment we know this,
  we know that it is true that he was irreligious; sceptical and anti-clerical
  in a rather negative way. He was dignified; but not averse from fees. That
  sort of man still exists; and his general sense of status, his social
  position and his professional etiquette, are still very much the same. The
  Doctor, in short, still exists as a roughly recognizable figure. The Dyer has
  totally disappeared; his hand is not subdued to what it works in, but his
  whole body and soul dissolved in his own dye-vat. He has become a liquid; a
  flowing stream of tendency; an impersonal element in the economics of the
  dye-works. He is not a Master-Dyer; he is at the most a Master of Dyers. But,
  in plain truth, he is not really a master, but only a paymaster. With every
  day that passes there is less importance in the mastery and more importance
  in the pay. The reason why the Doctor is recognizable, and the Dyer is
  unrecognizable, is perfectly simple. It is that the Doctors not only were,
  but still are, organized on the <i>idea</i> of a Medieval Guild.</p>

  <p>In the modern doctor we can see and study the medieval idea. We shall not,
  even if we are medievalists, think it an infallible or impeccable idea. The
  Guild is capable of pedantry; it is sometimes capable of tyranny. The British
  Medical Council, which is the council of a Guild, sometimes condemns men
  harshly for very pardonable breaches of professional law; it sometimes
  excludes outsiders from membership who might well have been members. But it
  does do what a Guild was supposed to do. It keeps the doctors going; it keeps
  the doctors alive; and it does prevent one popular quack from eating all his
  brethren out of house and home. It sets limits to competition; it prevents
  the growth of monopoly. It does not allow a fashionable physician in Harley
  Street to destroy the livelihood of four general practitioners in Hoxton. It
  does not permit one professional man to buy up all the practices, as one
  grocer can buy up all the grocers' shops. And it does permit us to study, in
  a clear modern example, outside all the medieval controversies, religious and
  other, what is really to be said for and against this system of economic
  combination, and what it is that can really be criticized, and can really be
  valued, in the idea of a Guild.</p>

  <p>The Physician of Chaucer has changed, it may be said, in every other
  character except his economic relation to the Guild, which is still founded
  on medieval economics. As a matter of fact, the story is more comic than the
  common story of evolution. He has changed so often that he has very nearly
  changed back to what he was before. It is true that he no longer regards the
  art of healing as founded on Astrology; though he sometimes founds it on the
  yet more ancient superstition of Divination by Dreams. But though we have not
  yet gone far enough for eager young scientists to be dealing in Astrology,
  there is something curious and almost creepy about their dealings with
  Alchemy. Many of the most modern speculations are a great deal nearer to the
  medieval notion of the transmutation of metals, than they are to the
  intervening materialist's dogmas of elemental and indestructible fixity. We
  may yet see the chemist turn into an alchemist, even if there is no immediate
  prospect of the astronomer turning into an astrologer. There is a typical
  piece of Chaucerian irony in the passage referring to the Doctor's purely
  scientific interest in gold:</p>

  <p class="verse">For gold in physic is a cordial<br>
  Therefore he loved gold in special.</p>

  <p>But nobody will say that this very special love of economic values is
  merely medieval, and cannot be admitted as modern. If avarice counted for
  something in alchemy, it has not been entirely absent from the services which
  modern science has offered to chemical combines and the discovery of mines.
  It is an amusing fact, by the way, that the quaint old legend, which
  Protestant prejudice set afloat some sixty years ago, to the effect that the
  Pope once condemned the study of Chemistry, really referred to this very
  fact; the fact that medieval religion did attempt to restrain medieval
  avarice. What the Pope did condemn was the practice of certain quack
  astrologers and alchemists, who used to go round to the houses of poor people
  and take away all their pots and pans with a promise of turning them all into
  gold. Against this great step in scientific progress the Pope did indeed set
  his face with ferocious medieval bigotry. If any modern moral authority were
  to condemn the somewhat similar students of the Art of Salesmanship, who go
  round tempting poor people to run into debt for all sorts of furniture and
  appliances for which they cannot ultimately pay, I for one should welcome
  such an outburst of Papal persecution. But I have no doubt that the
  progressive historian would give a simple summary of the incident; by saying
  that it was made a mortal sin to have any chairs and tables.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, the Guild principle has in fact saved the Doctor; and left him
  standing as a separate social figure in any crowd going to Wembley or
  Wimbledon, as he did in the crowd going to Canterbury. But it is the tendency
  of all the separate social figures, falling into modern monopolist and
  impersonal tendencies, to disappear altogether. Standardization lowers the
  standard of personality and independence in all the types and trades. Under
  that tendency, we no longer see the Ploughman but the new methods of the
  Steam-Plough; we no longer recognize the Miller but only a particular
  machinery of mills; and the current tendency, even of gossip, is to discuss
  not so much cooks as cookery and not so much clerks as clerking. A certain
  decline in the Comic Characters, conceived in relation to common trades, once
  so typical of English literature, is probably due to the decline in the idea
  of men who were Masters of their trade; and the substitution of numberless
  servants who had less pride in their professions. And this is relevant; for
  it may be the end of that long procession of English figures of fun, which
  undoubtedly began with Chaucer.</p>

  <p>True, this is masked by the fact that the moderns can find phrases which
  they call quite modern, when they mean that they are quite human. Chaucer's
  unsleeping eye on human nature did indeed spot any number of small but
  amusing facts, that were true in his time and are true in ours. This could be
  illustrated even in the examples which I have mentioned and contrasted; the
  examples of the Doctor and the Dyer. A modern reader gives something like a
  start of amusement, when he reads of the relation between the Doctor and the
  Chemist; how 'each of them made other for to win', that is, the Apothecary
  recommended the Physician and the Physician ordered the drugs from the
  Apothecary. That is the sort of social relation that might go on for ever,
  and can certainly go on to-day. On the other hand, Chaucer does not tell us
  much about the Dyer or his friends, and it is possible that they were an
  afterthought, inserted for some special reason, as were (in all probability)
  the three Priests who appear and disappear after the mention of the Second
  Nun. But he does tell us one thing in connexion with these worthy Guildsmen
  or Livery Men of City Companies, which is an excellent example of what men
  say is quite modern, when they mean that it is very ancient. He says that the
  Dyer, and the other Masters of their respective Mysteries, were quite in the
  way of becoming Aldermen. He throws a delicate veil, in his own indescribable
  way, over the question of whether they deserved to be Aldermen, or even
  wanted to be Aldermen. But he adds that, anyhow, their wives were all in
  favour of it; and that it is very pleasant to be distinguished from other
  women by being called 'Madame'. That is a drawing-room comedy that is modern
  enough, in that sense, and has a present and practical relation to the
  Honours List and the Sale of Peerages. There is many a knighthood given
  to-day, not so much because Mr. Biggs wishes to be Sir Benjamin Biggs, as
  because a more astute person has calculated that when she is Lady Biggs, it
  will sound quite as good as Lady Beauchamp or Lady Salisbury. The whole of
  Chaucer's book is dotted with details of this lively and accurate sort, to
  such an extent that a man might easily suppose that society had hardly
  changed at all, between the fourteenth and the twentieth centuries. The
  historic process of change is partly covered by certain comic antics of human
  nature, which can indeed occur in any age and are instantly recognized across
  the ages.</p>

  <p>But we must not allow this to mislead us to the extent of underrating the
  change there has really been. Even in the instances I have given, there is
  sufficient evidence of what has changed and what has not. It is so with the
  Doctor and the Chemist. The Doctor, who is still the member of a living and
  real Guild, remains the same. The Chemist, who is not the member of a real
  Guild, is already changing. It is no longer a case of the private physician
  calling on a private apothecary, living at the corner of the street. He has
  to deal already with vast commercial combines, with multiple and identical
  shops, in which all the chemists are servants and none of the chemists are
  masters. The name of one apothecary is now written in a hundred towns. And we
  owe it to the survival of a true medieval Guild, that the name of a single
  physician is not written on a hundred brass plates.</p>

  <p>In the same way, while men have ambitions in every age, and women change
  from age to age even less than men, there really is a difference between the
  Alderman and Livery in Chaucer's time and in ours. The old Dyers' Company was
  still concerned only, or mainly, with the defence of Dyers; not only with the
  defence of unsuccessful Dyers, but also, in the long run, with attack on
  successful Dyers. I know not if there is still a Dyers' Company; if there is,
  it is doubtless charitable in all manner of ways, but not in that way. It
  does not exist to bar and break the International Chemical Dyeworks Combine;
  it does not perceptibly try to do it, and it certainly does not do it. This
  may be partly explained by the fact that a considerable number of Dyers are
  aged colonels and clergymen, who have never dreamed of dyeing anything,
  except possibly their hair.</p>

  <p>This example of the Dyer and the Doctor and the Guild is the supreme
  example of what was meant, at the beginning of this chapter, by saying that
  we cannot understand the past life of the fourteenth century, until we have
  begun to look a little even into the future of the twentieth. We are now in
  the middle of movements that may distort or dissolve all those distinctive
  and independent types which Chaucer distinguished by trades. In short, we may
  yet find, in the long run, that the loss of Arms and Heraldry has killed the
  Gentleman: the loss of Guilds and Mysteries has killed the Citizen. We cannot
  strike a right balance of judgment about the medieval attempt to organize
  trades and traders, without considering, not merely that it is now lost, but
  where the loss of it may ultimately lead. We must not judge by that later but
  intermediary phase, in which England could be called a nation of shopkeepers,
  with the implication that each man must keep his shop. If a man wanted to
  keep his shop, he would have been wiser to keep his guild. Where we have lost
  the guild principle, we have collapsed into a totally different sort of
  collectivist plutocracy. For that is what it is; whether we put it in
  revolutionary terms, by saying that one man keeps a hundred shops, or put it
  in humanitarian terms, by saying that one shop keeps a hundred men. One vital
  distinction is that in such a system the organizer can only be an organizer;
  he must deal with the abstractions and not the materials of the trade; with
  pen and ink and not with dye-vats or wine-barrels.</p>

  <p>Now Chaucer came of a line of men that did deal directly with
  wine-barrels. They dealt as masters and not as servants, at least in the last
  two generations. But they dealt with a wine-barrel and not with a wine-list;
  with facts and not merely with figures. For them was natural magic and the
  world's desire stored in positive pots; solid as those that poured for Christ
  the incredible wine. He came of people who had dealt with the stuff and
  substance of things, and in his case, with a highly appropriate sort of
  thing. If we were to look for an allegory about him who dealt so often in
  allegories, we could hardly find for his birthplace a more appropriate House
  of Fame. Forth from among those vats of more than purple dye, forth from
  among the mighty vats of the vine, brought by the Shipman from the lands of
  Froissart and Petrarch, he came to walk the world; who went singing all his
  days as if wine were in his very veins, and hidden in his northern blood, the
  very secret of the sun.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a><small>CHAPTER III</small><br>
  Public and Private Life</h2>

  <p class="first">The name of Chaucer seems to have been quite common in
  medieval times, and is practically unknown in modern times. This alone
  strikes me as rather curious and unique. Almost all other famous names
  reappear in some fashion; there storms across the stage of relatively recent
  history somebody with the remarkable name of Sir Julius Caesar. We have
  accepted unstartled a worthy dissenting minister as the Rev. Mr. Shakespeare,
  and admired a brilliant stage-player with the Puritan name of Milton. But we
  look in vain for Mr. Chaucer, in Bohemia or Belgravia or the suburbs; nor in
  'the Street', nor up the Strand is he. The surname has not even appeared as a
  florid alias, or alternative title, among those who periodically alter their
  own pedigree and, like the wanton lapwing, get themselves another crest.
  Curiously enough, the latter course was actually adopted, in the reverse
  direction, in the original Chaucer family, if certain historians are correct.
  According to this theory, the son of Chaucer did really abandon his father's
  crest and coat-armour in favour of that of the De Roets, his maternal
  ancestors, supposing, heaven help us (such is the simplicity of snobs) that
  it would aggrandize Chaucer to be turned into Roet. But nowadays, when the
  Roets are forgotten, it does not even seem likely that Roet would be turned
  into Chaucer. Not even the most glittering, shifting and opalescent
  Opalstein, changing his name for the tenth time, ever seems to change it to
  Chaucer. I suspect that there is in this fact some faint shadow of something
  already noted here; something that is not exactly neglect, but is in a sense
  negligence. I mean that vague popular feeling that poor old Chaucer is a
  joke; that he is a funny, snuffy old man, like an antiquary or a small
  bookseller selling black-letter and broadsheets. An odd association of ideas
  about him, who sang in courts and had the confidence of kings: but I believe
  a very real one, among those who only know his name; and possibly a partial
  reason for their failure to claim or cling to his name. As I have said,
  somehow or other, it does not yet sound quite like a serious name: but,
  whatever be the reason, it is now at least a very rare name. And though it is
  very likely that a hundred Chaucers will leap out of dark corners or remote
  colonies, and write me long letters about this rash statement, it is a fact,
  at this actual moment by the clock, that I have never seen or heard of any
  living person bearing the once widespread name of the greatest Englishman of
  the Middle Ages.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, we may say that it was Chaucer who abolished the name of
  Chaucer. He did a number of rather remarkable things, including, for all
  practical purposes, tossing off a little trifle called The English Language.
  The name of Chaucer, or Chausseur, the maker of footwear, was once a common
  name because it described a common trade. A man was called Shoemaker as
  another man was called Tailor or Baker or Butler or Gardener; only he was
  called Shoemaker in French. For that matter, of course, the terms for
  tailoring and butlering and other things were of Norman and not Saxon origin;
  but that is another discussion, and a very tiresome one. The really important
  fact to be seized is this: that it was rather an unexpected, belated and
  almost reactionary accident, that the glorious English language came into
  existence at all. It was one of those lucky things that are not likely to
  happen and do happen; and often nearly happen too late. The whole trend of
  progress or organic growth was towards France and England growing together,
  under the common captaincy of a French-speaking nobility and chivalry. If a
  serious sociologist, mapping out the evolution of mankind, had existed in the
  earlier Middle Ages (and they had many other plagues and pestilences), that
  scientific prophet would most certainly have said that England was destined
  to become as French-speaking as France. The cultured class generally has an
  unfair advantage over the uncultured; and the whole culture had originally
  been a Latin culture. The Plantagenet attempts to make France a part of
  England were really a half-confession that England was a part of France. Then
  something happened at the last moment, of the sort that confounds scientific
  politics; something dimly resembling the combined instinctive movements of a
  populace and a poet. There was a faint trail of Anglo-Saxon traditions and
  various dialects like Middle English; but left to itself the trail would have
  led nowhere. Then a great genius saw that he could Frenchify it enough to
  make it English. That is about as nearly as we can define the process.
  Chaucer Europeanized English; he brought it into the current of culture, by
  setting it to foreign tunes and mixing it with foreign terms. But Chaucer
  destroyed the domination of pure French; he destroyed all sorts of incidental
  terms, titles and conventions that went along with it; and, while he was
  about it, he destroyed his own name.</p>

  <p>It would seem that the poet's grandfather was a certain Robert le Chaucer,
  who had some post in the Customs connected with the imports of wine from
  Aquitaine; so the connexion with the wine trade can be traced at least as far
  as that. The creator of The Wife of Bath, the great professional widow of
  literature, seems to have come of a household somewhat haunted by widows; to
  an extent to alarm Mr. Tony Weller. His grandmother was married at least
  twice; his mother was apparently married three times; and, touching later
  developments, it would seem that his sister-in-law was at least once a widow,
  before she became the third wife of that determined and untiring widower,
  John of Gaunt. It is a trivial coincidence, and yet not wholly uninforming;
  for many earnest students have missed the point about medieval life by not
  noticing that a thing was often derided as comic and yet was very common; was
  derided as comic because it was very common. Similarly, when we find medieval
  moralists indignantly denouncing something, we can generally deduce that it
  was a very medieval thing. Widowhood was really tragic, which is why kings
  and knights swore specially to defend the widow and orphan; but remarriage
  was none the less comic because it was obviously convenient. Anyhow, the way
  in which these rather entangled relations affected Chaucer is roughly this.
  His grandmother, Mary le Chaucer, who was probably born a Stace and
  previously married to a Heyroun, had a son named John Chaucer. After the
  death of her husband, Robert le Chaucer, she married a certain Richard le
  Chaucer; having apparently a taste in Chaucers. Richard was certainly a
  vintner and lived in London, in a part called Cordwaners-strete. There is a
  curious episode about some people called Stace, probably kinsmen, trying to
  kidnap young John Chaucer and marry him for monetary purposes; the youth
  being rescued by his stepfather. The stepfather died in 1349; and John
  himself went on vintnering with increasing success; as he deputized for the
  King's Butler in Southampton and even seems to have gone abroad in the train
  of the King. It seems likely that the Chaucers had for some time been, so to
  speak, among the camp-followers of the Court; but first in lowlier and
  afterwards in loftier stations or offices. John married Agnes, daughter of
  John Copton, of a family connected with the Mint, and lived in Thames Street.
  When he died, the widow was married again to another vintner, bearing the
  pleasing name of Bartholemew atte Chapel. So that a certain child named
  Geoffrey Chaucer, who is presumed to be her son, was provided with a
  stepfather, as his father had been; and may have received in childhood that
  impression of a transformation-scene of marrying and remarrying, which he
  extended into vistas of somewhat unscrupulous exaggeration in the career of
  The Wife of Bath. There are many other complicated controversies about the
  Chaucer family; but they may be left, first because they cannot be settled;
  and second because the Chaucer family is not so interesting as Chaucer.</p>

  <p>The life of Chaucer, in the somewhat limited sense of the biography of
  Chaucer, consists of a very few facts and an incredible crowd of fancies.
  Perhaps it would be fairer to say a crowd of conjectures; for part of the
  difficulty lies in the plausibility or probability of some of the
  conjectures, which come near the ground but never quite settle on it. At the
  very outset, the writer of a sketch of this poet has to decide whether he
  will confine himself to what he knows to be true, or speculate at length on
  many things which he can see to be possible, or even probable, but which may,
  after all (especially in the light of later research), be entirely
  misleading. I have here decided to dwell definitely only on the definite
  facts, and to reserve speculation for what must in any case be speculative:
  the spiritual and philosophical and literary meaning of the story. My reason
  is that the ramifications of the mere conjectures of the learned have been so
  vast, and, in some cases, so vain. They are liable to be pursued patiently,
  or impatiently, through thousands and thousands of words, and then brought to
  a stop with a few words. In one case I remember, Chaucer went on the wildest
  adventures in connexion with the revolt of the citizens of London concerning
  John of Northampton; a story in which the poet fled to Holland, was flung
  into the Tower, was released by the personal intervention of Anne of Bohemia,
  was put to thrilling tests involving the betrayal of his fellow-conspirators,
  before he could reappear in the light of day. To the whole of which story a
  subsequent biographer put a full stop of scepticism, by saying it was rather
  odd that through all these changes Chaucer regularly received his pension
  with his own hands, quite quietly, in his home in London. I am not going to
  erect towers of tentative theory which can be so rapidly ruined. The romance
  called 'The Possible Life of Geoffrey Chaucer, Gentleman', would be a most
  fascinating and spirited work; 'The Black Prince's Treasure'; 'In the House
  of Wat Tyler'; 'The Rescue of Laura'; 'What Became of Dante's Beatrice?'; or
  the great mystery story: 'Why Was Chaucer Robbed Twice in One Day?'&mdash;as he
  really was. Doubtless it was mixed up with the Pope or Wycliffe or someone;
  for the time was picturesque almost to excess: and the great men he may have
  met would need a volume apiece. But this volume is only about Chaucer; and
  this chapter is only about the ascertained facts about Chaucer. The trouble
  is that they are not only few, but they are not even always the few facts
  that make up the most rudimentary biography.</p>

  <p>A good example, to begin with, is the question about the date of his
  birth. It is largely calculated from the evidence which he gave in the affair
  of Scrope and Grosvenor; a lawsuit in which he is officially recorded as
  being 'forty and upwards, and armed twenty-seven years'. This lawsuit was
  certainly in 1386, so that presuming that Chaucer was then about forty-five,
  he was probably born about 1341. But it has always struck me as quaintly
  typical of the time, as well as of the oddity of the Chaucerian problem, that
  the Court records should be so very exact about the period during which he
  had borne arms and possessed armorial bearings, and so very vague about the
  period during which he had been alive. It is possible that Chaucer was
  himself rather vague, possibly out of natural vagueness, possibly out of
  natural vanity; but it seems clear that the legal authorities did not trouble
  to pin him down about his age, when once they were certain about his status
  of Armiger. That double information, certain on the smaller point and
  uncertain on the larger, is typical of all the information about Chaucer.
  There are rather interesting possibilities in such matters, to which I shall
  refer elsewhere; here I only note in passing that the very date of his birth
  is doubtful, though the date of his admission into the system of chivalry is
  clear. The problem of his parentage is in the same lopsided state. It has
  been traditionally, and apparently truly said (indeed it is substantially
  certain) that he was the son of a vintner of the City of London; but we do
  not know this even, so well as we know that he appears later in totally
  different positions: often the last positions where one would expect the
  vintner's son to be.</p>

  <p>One disadvantage of seeing the same figure in a series of flashes of
  lightning is that we cannot always be quite certain that it is the same
  figure. The fact that we have only disjointed bits and snippets of the
  biography of Geoffrey Chaucer involves the occasional possibility that, in
  the words of the ancient jest about a more ancient poet, it is not the
  biography of Geoffrey Chaucer, but of somebody else of the same name. In this
  connexion we cannot forget what we have already noted: that it was then a
  fairly common name. Nevertheless, there is a series of such glimpses of what
  would appear to be a continuous historical personality; though some of them
  seem to me less certainly, and others quite certainly, the personality of the
  poet. But whether they are certain or uncertain, they are none of them
  continuous; they are isolated impressions which can only be treated like
  separate pictures. The searchlight of criticism can only fall here and there,
  like a spotlight, upon a particular spot; and that so briefly that we cannot
  always be equally sure that the human figure which we see is part of the
  human story which we study.</p>

  <p>Thus, the very first figure we see is that of a boy in a short cloak with
  a pair of black and red breeches, who is hanging about in some more or less
  menial capacity in the house of the Countess of Ulster, who married Lionel of
  Clarence, one of the sons of Edward the Third. There is also an entry showing
  that he received a small sum 'for necessaries at Christmas'; and we will hope
  that the Countess of Ulster had proper ideas about what a boy's necessaries
  at Christmas are. But the whole thing was on a small scale, and seems to be
  suited to quite a subordinate position, and we cannot be absolutely certain
  that the boy in black and red breeches was father to the man with whom we
  deal.</p>

  <p>Next, we have a much brighter glimpse, in much broader daylight, of a very
  sharp-eyed and observant young man, probably clad as a <i>scutifer</i> or
  subordinate and assistant of some knight, walking about among the tents and
  painted palisades of a medieval camp, gay with heraldry; noticing especially
  the blazonry of one particular pavilion, and falling into talk with old
  soldiers or heralds' followers on the subject. The young man was about twenty
  years old; the time was the year 1359; and the place was the northern plains
  of France, stretching from the poplars of Picardy to the vines of Champagne,
  somewhere near the place where the road goes up to the holy towers of Rheims.
  There is no doubt whatever that this young man is that Galfridus Chaucer who
  filled up the chinks in his chivalric or bureaucratic duties with a few
  little literary exercises, admittedly not without merit. The military
  campaign, in which he was thus serving as a soldier, was one of the last
  efforts made by Edward the Third in his later years to repeat the success, or
  recover the crown of glory, which he had won at Crécy long before. About it,
  as about much of that dying medieval glory, there was an atmosphere of doom.
  It was probably felt by all that the first English triumphs could not be
  recovered; though John of Gaunt's grandson was to make yet another very
  gallant throw for it at Agincourt. Anyhow, it ended in defeat, and Chaucer,
  fighting in the defeated army, was taken prisoner.</p>

  <p>Here, however, we have the first really important light on the level of
  life, so to speak, on which he was by this time living. He was not only
  ransomed, but ransomed by a pretty large sum personally advanced by the King.
  It is clear that he was already a person of some distinction; or at least a
  person of some promise; and it is most probable that he was connected with
  the King by the tie of some task or commission, in which his own personality
  counted. He was still only a young squire, at most; but the Government was
  certainly employing the young squire on some particular business. In fact, it
  was a matter of what may be called (in every sense) Intelligence. It was as
  important then as now to have in the Intelligence Department at least one
  person of Intelligence. Such a man is valued, and efforts will be made to
  rescue or to ransom him. It seems clear at least that about the year 1360 and
  onwards, Chaucer, young as he was, was acting as some sort of King's
  Messenger or bearer of dispatches between France and England.</p>

  <p>In one of these foreign journeys, later on, he became a friend of
  Froissart; and Froissart is the type of that time and task in his life.
  Froissart is the historian who really did know everything about chivalry;
  except the most important thing: that what had turned into a Tournament had
  once been a Crusade. Courtesy was stooping to courtliness: chivalry was
  entangled in heraldry; but much of it was still worth learning; and anyhow
  these were the things the young poet had to learn. I have already said
  something of that flamboyant background of heraldry against which he stands.
  It is the vividness of heraldry in those days, and its vagueness in these
  days, which gives its amusing moral to the little incident that has often
  been quoted; one of the few living incidents in which the figure of Chaucer
  can be seen for a moment walking alive in the daylight. It happened, as
  noted, much later in his life; but it recalls the romantic youth here in
  question. The fashionable world, as we should put it, was divided into
  enthusiastic factions over a quarrel which had arisen about the legitimacy of
  a coat of arms, which then seemed almost as thrilling as the legitimacy of a
  child or a last will and testament. The arms borne by the great Border family
  of Scrope, in popular language a blue shield with a gold band across it (I
  can say 'azure a bend-or' quite as prettily as anybody else) was found to
  have been also adopted by a certain Sir Thomas Grosvenor, then presumably the
  newer name of the two. The trial was conducted with all the voluminous detail
  and seething excitement of a Society divorce case; reams and rolls of it, for
  all I know, remain, in the records of the heraldic office, for anybody to
  read if he likes; though I have my doubts even about Garter King-at-Arms. But
  somewhere in that pile of records there is one little paragraph, for which
  alone, perhaps, the world would now turn them over at all. It merely states
  that among a long list of witnesses, one 'Geoffrey Chaucer, gentleman, armed
  twenty-seven years', had testified that he saw the Golden Bend displayed
  before Scrope's tent in the battlefield of France; and that long afterwards,
  he had stopped some people in the streets of London and pointed to the same
  escutcheon displayed as a tavern sign; whereon they had told him that it was
  not the coat of Scrope but of Grosvenor. This, he said, was the first time he
  had ever heard tell of the Grosvenors. Such small flashes of fact are so
  provocative, that I can almost fancy he smiled as he said the last words.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the chief interest of the incident is the reversal of the
  relations between the witness and the trial; and indeed between the witness
  and the world. Chaucer at that moment was only of importance because he
  offered testimony about Scrope and Grosvenor. Scrope and Grosvenor at this
  moment are only of importance because they elicited testimony from Chaucer.
  It is an old moral, and obvious enough, that the fashion of this world passes
  away; yet we often find it hard to believe about the fashion of this age. All
  that world of the heraldic and the emblematic, full of many very noble
  meanings as well as many very idle mummeries, has long been rolled away like
  a scroll and vanished like a cloud; and we cannot conceive that the world
  once thought all that nonsense necessary. Yet we are not always eager to
  realize that all which we call necessary may some day be called nonsense. It
  is amusing to reflect that some day the apocalyptic newspaper files, with
  their huge headlines about The First Man Who Flew Round The World, or the
  American professor who thinks we can send wireless waves to Mars, will all
  seem to our descendants a dust of indescribably dreary triviality; and that
  nobody will ever look at the long-lost records, except to find a paragraph in
  a corner, in which Mr. Laurence Binyon or Mr. T. S. Eliot gave evidence about
  a motor-car collision.</p>

  <p>In dealing with all such incidents in Chaucer's life, it is unavoidable
  that we should have a very little fact to a great deal of theory or
  hypothesis; because it is impossible to recover the details of his life, but
  not altogether impossible to recover a good many of the details of his time.
  His appearance at the great Scrope and Grosvenor inquiry is entirely typical
  of all we know about him; of his footing among the gentry, which was yet not
  quite that of a conventional hereditary gentleman; of the confidence that was
  undoubtedly placed in his word and wisdom, in more important matters than
  this; of the good sense and clearness which marked all his modes of
  expression, and would in any case have made him an excellent witness; and
  even of a certain cheerful curiosity about common things, which made him stop
  in the street to find out the truth about the new public-house sign. But, on
  the whole, the difficulty of dealing with the life of Chaucer is that there
  are so very few of these flashes of daylight, in which the man himself can be
  seen and snapshotted, moving about on his personal affairs. Almost all we
  know of him comes from legal documents and official actions; not, as is the
  case with so many later poets, from contemporary memoirs or personal letters.
  No man is more personal in his work and more impersonal in his biography. So
  that, while we can see through his own eyes, with almost startling clearness,
  the Miller, blind and bloated and roaring with drink, thrusting aside the
  Monk and making sure of the second place in the series, or the Canon's Yeoman
  overtaking the cavalcade at a rush, with the foam on his horse's bridle,
  there was no one present to snapshot the figure of Chaucer himself, as he
  stood, sharp and observant, outside the blazoned tent in France or the
  painted tavern in London.</p>

  <p>But we do at least know that the rulers observed his observation, and were
  sharp enough to note his sharpness. He was trusted with diplomatic missions
  of great dignity, and with some which were, perhaps, too important to be
  dignified. In other words, it looks as if some of his foreign commissions had
  been of the nature of what we call Secret Service; and anyhow there is no
  doubt that he was deep in the secrets of two, if not three Kings. What we
  know of him publicly through his offices is entirely consonant with what we
  know of him personally through his poems. If there is one thing that we could
  have guessed for ourselves, about the personality of the poet, it is that he
  would have made a perfectly admirable diplomatist. The diplomatist of fiction
  and drama, especially the diplomatist of melodrama, seems extraordinarily
  unfitted for diplomacy. He is represented as a rigid and sinister person,
  with a perpetual sneer, and a background of assassins and the Third Degree.
  What is wanted in diplomacy is the careful cultivation of the exact contrary
  of all this; and the exact contrary of all this was Chaucer. The unshaken
  good temper which was combined with his wide knowledge of the world, his
  ready realization of the variety of human character, his perfectly genuine
  geniality towards most people, combined with an equally genuine knowledge of
  the weaknesses of most people, were exactly the qualities most wanted in that
  time of tangled feudal claims and touchy semi-dependent vassals. No man ever
  understood better that it takes all sorts to make a world, or even to make a
  pilgrimage. No man suffered fools more gladly, for he did actually suffer
  them gladly; getting any amount of gladness or gaiety out of his private
  observation of their folly. He was a polished adept in the dangerous
  diplomatic art of really getting some fun out of funny people.</p>

  <p>I shall deal on another page with the details of his political fortunes,
  the later part of which is admittedly covered with some obscurity. We are not
  certain of his personal attitude to the palace revolution which replaced the
  true Plantagenet by the ambitious son of John of Gaunt. We know that John of
  Gaunt had been in a general sense a patron of Chaucer, as of others; but it
  is difficult to deduce from this all his individual views about rather
  unforeseen changes in the next generation. For the purpose of the present
  problem, it is enough to say that he never ceased to receive a certain amount
  of reward and protection from the Court; though in his later years he was
  somewhat poorer and less frequently in public employment. He was not the kind
  of man to quarrel if he could help it, and, even in those quarrelsome days,
  none of the rulers seems to have finally or seriously quarrelled with him.
  The end of their own increasing quarrelsomeness he did not see, but carried
  with him to the last something of the calmer splendour of the victorious age
  of Edward. He died before the Wars of the Roses.</p>

  <p>I have summarized this chapter under the title of public and private life;
  and the difficulty is that the poet had a public life that was very much of a
  private life. Nay, in one sense, it was more private than his private life.
  We are not in fact told very much about the personal affairs of Geoffrey
  Chaucer; but what we are told we are told quite frankly. The biography of
  Chaucer is lost; but it is not hidden. When he does happen to talk about
  himself, he describes himself quite as vividly as he describes everybody
  else. He makes fun of himself as he does of everybody else. The description
  is incomplete, merely because there is not very much of it; and, like most
  light descriptions of the sort, it does not deal with the most serious
  matters. But though there is not enough of it to describe a complete person,
  it does not shrink from being personal, in the sense in which we now speak
  (generally with grave disapproval) about personalities. Chaucer has told us
  that he was fat, that he was reluctant to get out of bed, that he was content
  on occasion to look very much of a fool, that he was thought to neglect his
  neighbours for his craze for books; and many other things that are quite
  private and confidential as far as they go. But he has told us nothing of
  what was really private and confidential: and that was his work in the public
  service. He was practically by profession a diplomatist; and <i>his</i>
  diplomacy was a very secret diplomacy. In all his maze of multitudinous
  words, in all his wandering paths of narrative and meditation, in all the
  thousand things that he touches on as a poet, a philosopher, a moralist and a
  humorist, he has not left one single word, I think, which throws any light on
  those political missions which the King his master trusted him to conduct
  with the princes of France or the great merchants of Italy. His silence is
  entirely creditable to him; it was doubtless part of his code of honour as a
  public servant, especially as a feudal servant; but it is not very helpful to
  his biographers. A little is known, merely because it was generally known,
  about the object of some of his journeys abroad; but there are others that
  seem to me to have been of the Secret Service that is really secret. But this
  contrast between his ease and gaiety on the subject of himself, and his
  sobriety and silence on the subject of his business, is very characteristic
  of the man; and strikes that note of balance, or the power of keeping two
  different considerations in the mind, which will later be found a clue to
  deeper things. Chaucer (as has been said) was not so simple as he looked. It
  would be quite false to say, in modern English, that his simplicity was
  doubled by duplicity. But it would be quite true to say, in the older Latin,
  that he was duplex; that is, that he could think about two things at once.
  This sort of noble and honourable duplicity will later be found relevant to
  his philosophy and his religion.</p>

  <p>But the practical matter, for the moment, is that even his public life was
  a private life. It is only recorded in a few official entries, and we have to
  depend upon these, or upon things equally meagre, for much of our speculation
  about all that was really more private, in the sense of more personal.
  Perhaps this is most notably the case in the matter of the dates of his
  poems; a difficult matter which is somewhat doubtfully tested by the foreign
  influences brought in by his foreign travels. Thus, his work was at one time
  divided into a French and an Italian period; just as his diplomatic career
  was divided into a French and an Italian plan of movements. Later discussion
  has shown a tendency rather to turn on a distinction between the two Italian
  visits; many believing that it was not until the second that he received
  anything like the full Italian influence. These matters will be dealt with
  later, not indeed in detail; for there is little that can be called detail;
  but with reference to the real differences between his French and English and
  Italian elements. Here it is sufficient to fix the main facts as they concern
  a biography, even if it be a literary biography. Chaucer began his career as
  an envoy in foreign parts with certain negotiations in France, referring
  probably to the peace after the disastrous war and to other things. In 1367,
  we find him receiving a pension under the particular title of
  <i>valettus</i>: a Court office which, quaintly enough, is sometimes
  translated as Valet and sometimes as Yeoman. It would be hard to find two
  words which have strayed farther from each other in their subsequent
  significance. Anyhow, the next glimpse we have of the poet is that of a
  ceremonial functionary, carrying a torch or lifting a curtain, in the
  ordinary small rituals that surround royalty. But it is plain that this was
  only a sort of interlude, and his missions to France were soon followed by
  the first of his missions to Italy. It involved his going abroad, apparently
  alone, with a little money and some letters of exchange; and its full object
  perhaps will never be known. In 1372 he went to parley with two citizens of
  Genoa about a port in England suitable to the Genoese trade. It is much
  debated, among Chaucerian critics, whether the great enthusiasm he certainly
  showed later for Italian literature came to him through this first visit; but
  the best authorities now seem to think that all the really valuable
  'Italianate' work was done after the second visit in 1378. Anyhow, his first
  important work, which is not Italianate at all, was the lament over the
  Duchess who was the wife of John of Gaunt: and the question of his relation
  to the House of Lancaster would suffice to bring us back to more practical
  and personal elements in his own life.</p>

  <p>Among the very scrappy scraps that historians have had to piece together,
  there is mention in the year 1366 of a certain Philippa Chaucer being one of
  the attendants of the Queen. She was granted a pension, and later on we find
  the pension being paid through her husband Geoffrey Chaucer. This has given
  rise to endless disputes and difficulties; ranging from the suggestion that
  Geoffrey had revived the family fancy for Chaucers marrying Chaucers, and
  married a cousin of the same surname, to a deep and delicate dispute about
  whether he could possibly have been married in 1366, when a poem written
  about that year expresses the sentiment of a disappointed lover. Leaving the
  latter point for a moment, we may note that the theory of any close
  cousinship involves a non-existent dispensation from Rome, and in any case
  does not seem necessary. The alternative theory favoured is that he married
  Philippa de Roet; and if he did, a really interesting situation arises.</p>

  <p>If he did, it would seem that two strides, both almost accidental, really
  took him into a world far above his own. For it so happened, merely by
  chance, that Philippa de Roet's sister was engaged in John of Gaunt's family
  as a governess; it seems too probable that she became John of Gaunt's
  mistress; and it is quite certain that she eventually became his wife. She
  was his third wife; and men at that stage have often something a little
  senile about their sentiment. But something seems to tell us that she must
  have been rather a remarkable woman, whether in a pleasant or an unpleasant
  fashion; and it seems not altogether unlikely that some remarkable qualities
  ran in the family. Perhaps there was also something remarkable about her
  sister Philippa, that attracted the attention of the most subtle judge of
  character in that age. But beyond that, there seems very little material for
  judgment. What is much more to the point is, however, that if this
  identification be true, Chaucer had one wild leap of luck apart from all his
  services. By a sort of <i>mésalliance</i> nobody could have foreseen, the
  vintner's son became something very like a brother-in-law of the Blood
  Royal.</p>

  <p>The present writer is prayerfully conscious that he was never meant to be
  a biographer; not having that eye for detail which can trace a tenable theory
  among many doubts. On the other hand, if unlearned in the more recondite
  documents, he has in his time studied about one thousand detective-stories,
  and is often struck by the resemblance between the ingenuity of their authors
  and the ingenuity of the learned biographers. The true biographer hunts down
  a hero as the romantic detective hunts down a villain; tracking him, so to
  speak, by lost buttons and cigarette-ends; deducing his designs from his
  slightest scribbles or scraps of paper; drawing hints from eavesdropping on
  his most casual conversational remarks. Unfortunately, there is a fallacy in
  transferring these talents to the task of biography. A decent detective-story
  is itself a selected bundle of clues, with a few blinds as carefully selected
  as the clues. If therefore the reader, or his romantic detective, finds that
  somebody has made a note of the latest train to Market Harborough, or
  observes somebody else wave his hat towards a particular window with a
  striped green blind, he knows that these things have some connexion, however
  obscure or remote, with the great problem of who hanged Admiral Bundleton
  with his own bootlaces. But when we are dealing with the whole life of a real
  human being, and trying to trace its outstanding events, it is not in the
  least necessary, it is not in the least likely, that all the trivial
  incidents or allusions will refer to outstanding events. Many of them will
  refer to things that nobody can possibly discover, after five hundred years;
  many to things that were next to nothing even at the time; some actually to
  nothing at all. But some of the illustrious Chaucerian scholars, to whom the
  world owes such everlasting thanks for elucidating the text and many of the
  true facts, sometimes seem to be unable to realize this reality. They cannot
  believe that they are not sleuths, following a trail that was laid for them
  and cunningly darting upon clues that they were meant to see. Whatever
  Chaucer does or says, however idly or carelessly, can be taken down and used
  in evidence against him. Everything that could be an expression of his
  private feelings is supposed to refer to his private life. Anything, that
  could be twisted into the expression of an intention, must be an intention
  that he seriously entertained; anything like an intention that he seriously
  entertained must be an intention that he actually carried out. If he says
  anything, anywhere, in any connexion, referring to marriage, he must be
  referring to his own marriage. If he says, after writing a tragedy, that he
  would rather like to write a comedy, it must be some comedy that he actually
  wrote. If he should happen to say, or even happen to make one of his
  characters say, that he does not like the subject of some story, it must mean
  that he does not like a particular rival poet, who happens to have told the
  story. If he makes one of his characters claim to have gone somewhere where
  he himself actually went, then the fictitious character must be meant for a
  portrait of himself. This sort of hunting for hints is wonderfully exciting
  and very profitable and edifying&mdash;in murder-stories. But it is not human; and
  it has no relation to real human life. And when they come to what is in fact
  the very foggiest and most fanciful phase of human nature, young love and
  sentiment about the other sex, they become all the more ruthlessly like
  policemen on the pounce.</p>

  <p>Chaucer wrote a poem, apparently an early poem, called 'An Exclamation of
  the Death of Pity'. It is all about a young gentleman being in love with a
  young lady, and talking about her to various other people, allegorical and
  otherwise, in the medieval manner; and complaining especially that pity is
  dead and there is no hope of the fulfilment of his dream; which certainly
  seems a rather dreamy sort of dream. But the most elaborate scaffolding of
  scientific dates and details has been erected on this chance metrical
  exercise of Chaucer; calculations about when he was married; about whether it
  could have been written after he was married; about whether, in that case, it
  proves that he was unhappily married; calculations about the date of his
  falling in love, the date of his falling out of love, and (of course) the
  exact identity of the only possible lady whom he could ever have loved. I may
  be very irresponsible, but all this seems to me to be extraordinarily wide of
  the mark, touching a man's actual life in this vale of tears. I should
  imagine that there never was a man, not actually convinced of a vocation of
  virginity somewhere about the age of seven, who had not had enough in the way
  of day-dreams and dallyings to have written such sentimental verse by the age
  of seventeen. Sentimental verse of that sort has been written about a total
  stranger; about a face seen in a crowd; about a person who did not exist at
  all. Yet all this subjective side of youthful poetry seems to be entirely
  forgotten, because we are trying to make an objective biography of Chaucer
  out of any objects lying about; as the buttons and cigarettes lie about in
  the murder-story.</p>

  <p>Now the fact is that youthful brooding is so subjective that it hardly
  even needs a subject. Certainly its literary self-expression can often be
  quite easily transferred to another subject. The poet preserves what the
  lover has forgotten; and many a famous love-poem may have been begun about
  one lady and finished about another. The time at which it was published is no
  clue to the time at which it was written. The time at which it was written is
  no clue to the theme that it was written about. Save in a few very vivid and
  personal examples, the theme may have even begun and ended in thought. And it
  seems to me very unfair to Mrs. Geoffrey Chaucer to deduce, in a detective
  manner, that her husband was unhappy with her; or that her husband was
  unfaithful to her; or indeed that there was anything whatever the matter with
  either of them, from anything so flimsy as the fact that her husband is the
  author of some rather artificial love-verses, that he might have written to
  anybody at any time, or touched up at any time, or decided to publish at any
  time.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Some of the other evidences that have been found before now, by detectives
  hovering round the Chaucer household, are much more ridiculous than this.
  Somebody found a confession of domestic tragedy in the fact that Chaucer
  confessed that he was a little liable to be cross with the voice that woke
  him up too early in the morning. This may have been a tribute to his dreams,
  though more probably to his taste for dreamless sleep; but it can hardly be
  regarded as a very definite and detailed criticism of his daily or domestic
  life. As to the hundred and one jests and jeers that are thrown throughout
  his works at women or wives or marriage, they do not differ from the ordinary
  conventional joke of Mrs. Caudle's Curtain Lectures, or the picture of any
  henpecked husband in <i>Punch</i>, except in being much more refined. For the
  author of the Miller's Tale was refined. That is, he could be refined; and a
  good many modern writers are most coarse and clumsy when they intend to be
  refined. These jokes certainly prove nothing either way about the happiness
  of his marriage. Such jokes have been made by hundreds and thousands of happy
  and unhappy husbands, and fill all the libraries of the world. The people who
  write them think they are funny; they write them because they think they are
  funny; not because they describe exactly the facts of their own private
  lives. There seems, in short, to be a curious oblivion of the purely literary
  reasons for literature. Poetry generally comes out of the poet's life, as
  distinct from his biography; not out of what he did, but of what he thought
  when he was doing nothing; not out of the self that he expressed in working
  or wiving or flirting, but of the self that he could only express in writing.
  Certainly he does not sit down and keep a diary in verse, with all the
  details relevant and realistic. That is not the way poetry is written. But it
  seems to be the way biography is written.</p>

  <p>I therefore delicately deprecate the idea of biographers thus appearing as
  detectives; especially as that not very superior sort of detective employed
  to collect evidence for a divorce between Mr. and Mrs. Chaucer, five hundred
  years after their death. I do not know whether Mr. and Mrs. Chaucer were
  happy or unhappy. Apparently it has not occurred to our bright psychologists
  that they were probably both. There seems to be a certain lack of vividness
  in envisaging what marriage is like, as well as what poetry is like. But, as
  Professor Pollard has justly said, what evidence there is rather points to
  Chaucer having been both happier and more religious and respectable while his
  wife was alive than afterwards. It is more to the point that he was
  apparently poorer afterwards. Which may be rather a compliment to the
  wife.</p>

  <p>I have said that I attach very little importance to the merely exclamatory
  or flippant phrases, on which the theory of the poet's conjugal tragedy has
  been based. It is a good rough rule with Chaucer to translate him into modern
  English, or a parallel modern passage. The passage about his wife waking him
  up might be rendered more or less correctly thus: 'A voice woke me up, rather
  as somebody I needn't mention very often <i>does</i> wake me up; but then,
  you see, the voice was very mild or gentle, so I knew it wasn't my wife.'
  That remark might pass in the patter of any comedian, or the half-impersonal
  confessions of any comic writer, without being supposed to throw any very
  blazing or blasting light on the actual misery of his actual marriage. And
  this is perhaps the most positive and pointed of the purely literary
  allusions that have been used for this purpose. But it is only right to add
  that there is one piece of actual record, that is not merely a piece of
  literature or a lark, which can be interpreted in the sense that the poet had
  been practically misbehaving himself. It is a rather mysterious legal
  document in which a young woman named Cecilia de Chaumpaigne releases a
  Geoffrey Chaucer from his legal liability in some charge of abducting or
  eloping. It is quite possible, of course, that the matter was concerned with
  some real wrong, though this does not fully explain it. The woman presumably
  had some reason for having once involved Chaucer (if it was Chaucer) in the
  affair. It is equally true, on that argument, that she presumably had some
  reason for releasing him from it. The best Chaucerian authorities seem to
  think that it was not exactly a personal matter, but part of one of those
  curious family conspiracies for getting hold of people and marrying them to
  other selected people, which were rather a recurrent scandal in those times;
  in one case of which Chaucer's own father had been the victim. Quite apart
  from morality, in which any man may fail, it was not at all typical of
  Chaucer's temperament to engage in any personal or isolated violence or
  lawlessness; and it is certainly the only mark of the sort against his name.
  It is possible that he might play something like the part of Pandarus to some
  Troilus in his own marrying and remarrying family; it seems more probable
  that he would play the part of mentor or moderator; hence, possibly, the
  special pardon to himself. There may have been almost any sort of complicated
  comedy of relations; there may have been simply a bad break and nothing else.
  The incident forms the most thrilling and entertaining chapter in that
  Possible Life of Geoffrey Chaucer, which I am not writing and do not intend
  to write.</p>

  <p>We have seen that Chaucer's first Italian mission was to Genoa; it has
  been conjectured that he went from there to Padua, where it would have been
  possible for him to meet, as he certainly would have wished to meet, the most
  famous and in one sense the first poet of the age. Petrarch was in Padua at
  the end of 1372; and there is certainly something at least like a coincidence
  in the fact that he was then turning into Latin the same story of Griselda
  which Chaucer later turned into English. This (if one may say so) seems to me
  a good example of the difference between reasonable and unreasonable
  deduction from our fragmentary documents. There is a real objective concrete
  coincidence or convergence of facts, or at any rate approximation of facts,
  in Chaucer, Genoa, Padua, Petrarch and Griselda, <i>plus</i> the fact that
  the Clerk of Oxford, in telling the tale of Griselda, actually mentions
  Petrarch and Padua. Any one of these things might happen without any
  connexion; but it is odd that they were all connected. But when people pass
  from this to saying that Chaucer must have meant the Clerk of Oxford for
  himself, or rather a double of himself (seeing that he already happened to be
  present in his own person), and when they mix up Chaucer's gossiping
  greediness for all sorts of books with the concentration on Aristotle which
  is a part of the character of the Oxford Schoolman and philosopher, they go a
  great deal too fast and indulge in fancy. No two Canterbury Pilgrims can ever
  be confused for a moment; and the Clerk of Oxford is the Clerk of Oxford, and
  Chaucer is very emphatically Chaucer. Nevertheless, Chaucer <i>was</i>
  interested in philosophy; besides being, in a really natural sense, a natural
  philosopher.</p>

  <p>It is very possible therefore that Chaucer did here enter for the first
  time into that golden air of the Roman culture that was soon to be the golden
  air of the Renaissance; at the gates of which, crowned with laurel, stood
  great Petrarch clad in gold. That was how he seemed, at least, to his
  contemporaries to stand; and Chaucer certainly did not fail to admire him,
  however soon or late he began to imitate him; but he seems to have admired
  Dante more, though he could hardly be expected to imitate him better. Whether
  there be any connexion or no between the two turns of his fate, it is certain
  that the mission to Italy was like a golden gate for the practical prosperity
  of Chaucer. His real period of wealth, public importance and (it is fair to
  add) public industry, stretches from that St. George's Day in 1374, when the
  great English poet received from the English King the highly symbolic pitcher
  of wine (which he afterwards turned into a pension), right away past the
  death of King Edward in 1377 to the time of the revolt of Gloucester in the
  councils of his grandson. In the summer of the same year he became
  Comptroller of the Customs and Subsidy of Wools, Skins and Tanned Hides in
  the Port of London, and his salary seems to have been augmented by a variety
  of other payments, in a rather patchwork fashion; by a pension from John of
  Gaunt; two ward ships which carried remuneration, and a special grant from
  the King on some wool forfeited for non-payment of duty. He then went on
  another foreign mission to Flanders, of a smaller and secret sort, and we
  find that in such cases he was allowed to appoint deputies for his official
  work. But, in the ordinary way, he was a good hard-working official. It is
  apparent in everything, from such details as we know about the work itself to
  the particular tone of the relief he expresses at having balanced his ledgers
  and gone back to his books. In that way he was a good business man; though
  perhaps rather of the type that is a better business man for his employers
  than for himself. It is a type not uncommon among good-tempered, abstracted,
  secretly imaginative men; the type that goes on for years as an excellent
  Government Office clerk, but when once it is superannuated and at leisure, is
  not always wise in dealing with its own hobbies or investments. There has
  been much talk about whether the breakdown in Chaucer's fortunes, and the
  relative poverty that fell upon him, was entirely due to the later political
  accident which turned him for a time out of office. It has been suggested,
  for instance, that a hobby of Astrology, accompanied by a more expensive
  hobby of Alchemy, ran away with a great deal of his money. In this connexion
  only two facts can be noted in a mere skeleton of facts like the present.
  First, Chaucer seems to have had a son named Lewis; presumably by Philippa
  Chaucer, who is thought to have died about 1387. Chaucer wrote for his son a
  little treatise on the Astrolabe, treating that scientific instrument very
  much as a toy, and definitely stating that, whatever there may be in
  astronomy, there is precious little in astrology. This has been held to refer
  to a grievance against such medieval experiments. But it seems to me quite
  sufficiently explained by the fact that Chaucer was a Christian and a
  Catholic, with plenty of common sense and an acquiescence in the Church's
  protest against the superstitions of fatalism and doom. Even if he had not
  been sensible enough to be orthodox on that subject, a man of his nature
  would certainly be specially orthodox when writing something for his own
  child. That might not have prevented him playing the fool with sham sciences
  himself; but the thing is quite unproved. The other proof offered is the very
  violent explosion against the fraud and rascality of Alchemy in the Canon's
  Yeoman's Tale, which sounds to some good critics like the real recital of a
  real wrong. We cannot tell whether Chaucer had this experience; we can be
  quite certain that he had this conviction.</p>

  <p>His second Italian mission first arrests the attention by bringing in
  certain figures who counted for a good deal, either in life or literature. We
  find here certainly, for the first time, that he was a close friend of his
  famous contemporary, the poet Gower; for he left Gower as a deputy to look
  after his affairs. Here we have another of these typical fancies, that have
  hardened into theories; the theory of the broken friendship and subsequent
  quarrel of the two medieval poets. Their relation is of some historical
  interest, but this sort of guesswork is very unhistorical. We can only
  speculate on the friendship. Chaucer was a man for whom the world teemed with
  quiet fun, as it says in the comic opera; and I have often wondered whether
  he felt the full irony of the patronage to which men such as he are subject.
  I do not mean the royal or feudal patronage, which was simply a part of the
  social order of the time, which a sensible man of his type would probably
  accept as we accept policemen or postmen. It was considered part of the
  province of a prince to support artists and such odd people; and, though the
  thing had obvious abuses, there was something to be said for it, if we
  compare it in all aspects with the problem of the best-seller or the man who
  starves in Fleet Street. But I mean that more subtle patronage that is
  extended to poets by poets, and not by patrons. There is always something a
  little quaint in that relation of the rich artist and the poor artist; or the
  old artist and the young artist; or the successful artist and the other who
  is not as yet successful. It is recorded with rather savage irony in Mr.
  Belloc's sketch of 'The Good Poet and the Bad Poet'. Remember that Hayley as a
  poet, and not merely Hayley as a squire, was in a position to patronize
  Blake. There is a grim humour in the fact that a man like Swift felt bound to
  mention a man like Temple as a literary leader, and not merely as a social
  protector. The practical patrons of Chaucer did not, so far as I know, appear
  also as the rivals of Chaucer. At least I never heard of John of Gaunt
  dropping into poetry; or Henry of Bolingbroke capping <i>The Canterbury
  Tales</i> with a little thing of his own. But the thing has more subtle forms
  when it comes from the seniors of the school of letters; from those who are,
  for any reason, considered more established, or more learned, or more in the
  official limelight, than a mere stray genius. I have always felt that there
  was a touch of this in the attitude of Ben Jonson to Shakespeare. I am pretty
  sure there was a touch of it in the attitude of Gower to Chaucer.</p>

  <p>John Gower seems to have had a vaguely national or official function,
  which was never entirely accorded to Chaucer, for all his laureateship and
  his butt of sack. Shakespeare, following some tradition of tragedy, and more
  especially of morality, uses the name for the funereal figure appearing
  before the curtain as a Prologue or prophet of woe and wisdom, to draw all
  the proper morals from the historical plays; as if it were the name of the
  licensed and labelled moralist of English literature. Chaucer addresses him
  as, 'O moral Gower', distinguishing him, in a departmental manner, from 'the
  philosophical Strode', whose province was presumably philosophy. But the
  delicate difference of tone appears when we pass from what Chaucer said to
  Gower to what Gower said to Chaucer. Gower was thoroughly friendly; entirely
  affable. He says that Chaucer is his poet; but he also says that Chaucer is
  his disciple and even 'his own clerk', who has taken down many of his
  thoughts, perhaps in somewhat lighter language. And in his doubtless sincere
  compliment to Chaucer's verse, we have exactly the same suggestion as that
  made by many graver poets about Shakespeare and his warbling of
  wood-notes:</p>

  <p class="verse">Of dytees and of songes glade<br>
  The whiche he for my sake made.</p>

  <p>One would not say that the graver poets disapprove of cheerfulness in the
  minor poets; but they mention it. Chaucer, like Matthew Arnold in Max's
  caricature, was not at all times wholly serious. Without claiming to have
  read every line and word of the moral Gower, which would be a boast of no
  little hardihood, I suspect that he was, for the most part, wholly serious.
  When I hint that it is barely possible that Chaucer saw some humour in all
  this, I do not mean to discredit the view that the two poets were friends.
  They were both, in their way, men of good will, and one of them was
  conspicuously a man of good humour. That sort of friendship need not go
  wrong, unless both the friends treat it wrongly. Blake abused Hayley like a
  pickpocket; but then Blake was as hard to please as Hayley was tactless in
  pleasing. Chaucer was not at all hard to please. It is written all over his
  work that he was very easy to please. George Macdonald finely said that God
  is easy to please and hard to satisfy; and there is something of that in many
  great men. I can believe that Chaucer was pleased with Gower's patronage,
  though I rather doubt if he was satisfied with Gower's poetry.</p>

  <p>These being the human and rather humorous probabilities of the case, the
  ingenious melodrama of the mortal quarrel of the poets has apparently been
  made up merely out of one chance remark in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>. It is
  the characteristic remark of Chaucer that he dislikes stories of which the
  subject is some horrible perversion or monstrosity; he mentions one such
  legend, which does happen to have been dealt with by Gower. We can only say
  that this might conceivably have led to a quarrel; but I can find no direct
  evidence that it ever did. To say it could only have been written
  <i>because</i> of a quarrel seems to me simple nonsense. For the rest,
  Gower's place in the biography is that of the friend whom Chaucer left to
  represent him when he went to Italy for the second time: that second visit
  which introduced him to other historical persons of importance; notably to
  Bernabo Visconti of Milan, whose tragedy attracted the sympathy of Chaucer,
  as remains recorded in the Monk's Tale. He was not long in Italy this time,
  but most critics hold that he saw more books and manuscripts and received
  then his real introduction to Italian letters. There seems to follow an
  expanding leisure and importance at home; he was given a new Comptrollership;
  he was able to appoint a permanent deputy for his old Comptrollership, and in
  the same year, 1385, he was made a Justice of the Peace for Kent, and in the
  following year a Member of Parliament, as Knight of the Shire for Kent. Thus
  he seems to settle down and spread himself in that very English landscape
  through which he and his great company will ride for ever; when there came
  the sharp turn in his destiny and something even like disaster.</p>

  <p>Richard the Second, the grandson of the old King, had come to the throne
  as a mere boy; though a rather remarkable boy, to judge by the presence of
  mind and instinct, at once princely and popular, with which in his boyhood he
  faced and pacified the Peasant Rising. But he naturally suffered from uncles;
  generally either from John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster, or from his other
  uncle, the Duke of Gloucester. Lancaster went abroad, leaving his protégés
  unprotected; Gloucester seized the power and almost the person of the young
  King, and in the overturn Mr. Geoffrey Chaucer lost all his comfortable jobs,
  which were given to the Gloucester party. There follow clear indications that
  he had fallen on evil days. He obtains protection for a year against being
  sued for debts; he sells some of his pensions for cash down. Relatively to
  his previous prosperity, his comparative poverty seems to have continued till
  his death. But relatively to these first pressing years of poverty,
  immediately after Gloucester's palace revolution, he makes a very
  considerable recovery; and seems to have received royal help once more,
  whenever he really required it. For Richard the Second, a year after he had
  become a man, determined to become a King. He suddenly rent the rod of office
  from Gloucester; summoned back John of Gaunt, and resumed that sort of rule
  which Victorian historians always called despotic, especially when it was
  slightly democratic. The effects of this, and of his ultimate fall, on
  English history were very great and have been considered elsewhere. But the
  effects on Geoffrey Chaucer were very practical and consoling; for he was
  appointed Clerk of the Works in the repairing of the greatest public
  buildings: the Tower of London and the Palace of Westminster, and St.
  George's Chapel at Windsor. He was later made a commissioner for the repair
  of high-roads, and though these jobs did not last indefinitely, he was never
  entirely neglected after the return of John of Gaunt. Richard the Second gave
  him a new pension in 1394, and later a tun of wine. Fortunately, also, even
  the fall of King Richard, which changed so many things, did not change this
  partial recovery of Chaucer's more moderate prosperity. Whatever else Henry
  Bolingbroke was, he was John of Gaunt's son, and had no quarrel with his
  father's old poet. He sent him a fresh pension in response to the humorous
  melancholy of the poet's 'Complaint to his Purse'; and with this Chaucer
  passed his last days in peace. But his last days had come. He died just after
  he had moved into a house near St. Mary's Chapel, from which he is said to
  have looked out in his last hours on the gardens and the great roof of the
  Abbey.</p>

  <p>More than one portrait of Chaucer remains to give a general idea of his
  appearance, though that was the time of the first beginnings of portraiture
  in paint, at least in this country, as Chaucer himself may be called the
  beginning of portrait-painting in literature. The pictures we have represent
  him as he was in later life, when the Host of the Tabard chaffed him on his
  stoutness. It would be interesting to have an earlier impression, touching
  the days when he was light on his feet, and knew fighting and foreign travel,
  yet had already what was called his elvish face and the pleasant shyness that
  covered so much sharpness. The best existing portrait is that published by
  the poet Occleve, to illustrate one of his own poems. It shows the head in a
  black hood against a green ground; two tufts of grey beard and a wisp of
  whitish hair rather recall, at least to modern associations, the elvish
  comparison; but the face is sober and benevolent, not without something of
  that sleepiness touched with slyness, that is the mood of much of his later
  work. Red cords on his dress support writing materials and he appears to be
  carrying a rosary; at least, as it is certainly a string of beads, it seems
  most likely that it is a rosary. For I cannot suppose that Chaucer's quarrel
  with the Friar, even if it went to the point of assault and battery, would
  have prevented him from carrying what has been called the Layman's Breviary,
  devoted to the Virgin to whom he had so much devotion, merely because the
  instrument happens to have been invented by St. Dominic. However that may be,
  the portrait is unmistakably a portrait; the person unmistakably a person.
  And it is easy to imagine the old man, in much that habit and condition,
  pottering about the Gothic lanes of Westminster, until he died, almost to a
  day (it is conjectured), coincidently with the death of the flamboyant,
  toppling and tottering fourteenth century.</p>

  <p>He was buried, as we all know, in Westminster Abbey; the first of the
  poets to lie in Poets' Corner. There have been differences about the tomb, of
  late Gothic design, that still covers his bones; but it is certainly so far a
  genuinely Gothic thing, that it is the only thing in that Corner that
  suggests the idea of a corner. The more modern monuments do not suggest the
  sort of persons who would be content in any case to remain in corners. Even
  if it were erected much later, and not in the best medieval manner, it is so
  far medieval that it does suggest that the buried man is buried; not that he
  is impatiently and prematurely resurrected before the Resurrection. Even here
  we feel something of that <i>communis sententia</i>, or medieval common
  sense; which was so much less rhetorical, and therefore so much more really
  rational, than the rational eighteenth century. Few will deny that the
  figures which fill the Abbey to-day, mostly the relics of the eighteenth
  century, are in their nature rather rhetorical. I do not mind such rhetoric
  in its place; but I doubt if its place is a Gothic church, and I think it is
  made to look rather silly by the silent presence of the Gothic tomb. The
  latter seems to say, in the language of a simpler time, that Galfridus
  Chaucer had lived his life, and this monument commemorated his death; and
  that, <i>salve fide</i>, there was an end of it. He had swaggered a little
  in his day, and that cheerfully and pleasantly; but he does not swagger
  solemnly in his death. He had served in arms, and been among swords and
  soldiers; but he does not stand wildly waving a sabre and bestriding a
  cannon, like General Sir Peveril Potts, whose services in the campaign before
  the Peace of Utrecht will leap to all our memories. He had done his best for
  his country in diplomatic negotiations with foreigners, and settled several
  questions of royal ransoms or marriages of considerable importance in their
  day; but he does not stand grasping a scroll or pointing to a map like the
  Right Hon. Benjamin Buffle, whose patriotic virtues have boiled over from his
  tomb in billows of bloated marble. He had written a little thing or two that
  some have admired; but he does not lean elegantly on an urn or look up at a
  laurel or invoke an invisible Muse, as does the immortal Timmins, whose works
  were so widely read by the fashionable world in the Age of Reason. He does
  not strike any attitudes as do the varied representatives of that remarkable
  company; including, I believe, five or six professional politicians and one
  butler; probably the most respectable person present. He does not offer any
  remarks, by means of post-mortem pantomime or sculptured signal or
  gesticulation. He lies prostrate as when death struck him down; in the last
  dark instant when he cried upon Christ.</p>

     id="ch4"></a><small>CHAPTER IV</small><br>
  The Garden of Romance</h2>

  <p class="first">Chaucer advances into the light of literary history out of a
  forest of tangled traditions, translations, imitations, partial imitations
  and patchwork collaborations, like a figure emerging from that chequered and
  glimmering forest of dreams in which such medieval figures so often walk; in
  which a half-human figure will carry two faces under a hood of allegory, and
  haunting half-recognizable voices speak from behind the golden masks of the
  gods. Most people realize more or less the curious sort of communism in
  culture that prevailed in those days. Some, however, hardly realize that
  there were two sides to it. Many medieval translators really were inventing,
  even while they were translating&mdash;or stealing. While the modern egoist has
  the rather petty prudence of Polonius, and will neither a borrower nor a
  lender be, the medieval traditional translator would often lend as well as
  borrow. We first find a poem and read it as if it were an original; and then
  are surprised to find that it is a rather close translation. Then we read it
  as a translation, and are surprised again to find that it contains a great
  deal that is purely original. It is hard to say which of the two would seem
  the stranger, in the case of any strong and sincere talent to-day. Modern
  writers are intense individualists, and certainly none more so than the
  Socialists. If Mr. Bernard Shaw, say, or some more impatient intellect of
  recent times, had just begun his literary career, he certainly would not
  begin it by writing laborious English versions of the longest novels of
  Tolstoy. But still less, if possible, would he add to the length of the works
  of Tolstoy long passages entirely invented by Bernard Shaw. We should not
  find the whole dramatic story of Candida somehow embedded in the story of
  Anna Karenina. We should not find all the best speeches in <i>Arms and the
  Man</i> put into the mouths of moujiks, in the retreat from Moscow described
  in <i>War and Peace</i>. And that is exactly how the medieval translators
  used to go on. At the first glance, they almost seem to be publishing
  somebody else's book as their own. At the second glance, they seem to be
  gratuitously giving away their own work to improve somebody else's book. It
  cannot be understood without calling up a vanished world of the community of
  thoughts and themes, in which a tale or a topic was in some sense set up like
  a target; in which a romantic story was rather like a smoking-room story,
  which can be told over and over again, with variations by different
  story-tellers. One author did not so much rob the other as enrich the other.
  These ragged Northern poets may have taken refuge in the ruins of Greek
  temples or Italian villas, but not merely in the manner of bats and owls;
  they repaired the ruins not merely with new stones, but with precious stones.
  They often wore second-hand clothes; but they patched the old garment, not
  only with new cloth, but with cloth of gold.</p>

  <p>It is necessary, to start with, to make this point clear about the
  spontaneity and sincerity of the translator. In this, even more than other
  things, the modern change has chilled the sense of scale or grandeur in
  Chaucer. There exists a fine French ballade, addressed to Chaucer by a
  contemporary in France; lauding his work up to the skies with a warmth it
  would be impossible to doubt; and it has for a refrain, like a burst of
  boisterous salutation: 'Grant translateur! Noble Geffroy Chaucier.' Some
  English critics have been a little sniffy (I can use no other word) in
  receiving this fervent foreign compliment; because it appears to describe
  Chaucer merely as a translator. On the other hand, a brilliant French critic,
  who does full justice to the poet otherwise, has in this matter also a faint
  suggestion of sniffiness (I apologize again to the academy of pure English),
  in so far as he seems to insist that Chaucer <i>was</i> merely a translator;
  touching certain works of which much has been made. Chaucer was a translator;
  but his French critic seems to me to miss his countryman's full meaning in
  speaking of a <i>great</i> translator. It is not easy nowadays to think of
  the thing on quite that scale; partly because it is badly paid; partly
  because it is badly done. Talking of 'a great translator' sounds like talking
  of 'a great scrivener', or 'a great stenographer'. But this is to leave out
  that vital medieval virtue; the enthusiasm of the translator, his primary
  motive of admiration; sometimes admiration for the author; sometimes simply
  admiration for the subject. It will be necessary to note, in another
  connexion, that it is indeed impossible to translate poetry, in the sense of
  finding a precise equivalent to poetical language. But it is none the less
  possible to be inspired to write fine native verse by the inspiration of fine
  foreign verse; or sometimes, even, of slight foreign verse. Indeed, I am
  disposed to suspect that a translation is always either much greater or much
  smaller than the original. Now some of Chaucer's translations were much
  greater than the original. All of them were, in a rather curious sense, more
  original than the original. All of them seem to move quite naturally in
  English poetry; though English poetry, in a manner of speaking, had only just
  begun to move. Indeed translations of this old natural sort do seem to find
  it easy to get naturalized. 'Drink to me only with thine eyes', is not less a
  lyric essentially English because it is taken, almost line by line, from the
  Greek. 'When lovely woman stoops to folly', is none the less an English poem
  because it was taken, almost word for word, from the French. But in the case
  of Chaucer we are dealing with something much deeper than the
  eighteenth-century sentiment of Goldsmith or the robust pedantry of Ben
  Jonson. He was often dealing with those profound intellectual passions that
  concern themselves with the ultimates of the universe; with the philosophy
  that is even prior to poetry. He was moved to translate the original, he was
  moved to make the translation greater than the original, not by personal
  rivalry, or even by personal admiration, but by what he himself would call
  the <i>primum mobile</i>, or Great Mover of all hearts and heads; by a direct
  appeal, not to the original, but to the origin.</p>

         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Those who do not happen to understand these emotions are at a disadvantage
  in the matter. This appears very clearly, for instance, in a composition
  which is generally placed by scholars among Chaucer's early works, and is
  certainly among his traditional works. I mean the alphabetical address to the
  Blessed Virgin, commonly called Chaucer's A B C. The French critic, to whom I
  have referred, pins the matter down to the single point that this poem is
  undoubtedly a copy of a similar French prayer, written by a French priest. He
  seems to make everything turn on the fact that the French priest wrote the
  poem in short lines, and the English poet was wise enough to widen them into
  long lines. In other words, while admitting the artistic effect, he tends to
  insinuate that it is an artificial effect. He congratulates Chaucer as an
  artist or artificer; but he congratulates him upon having selected a more
  ingenious form of verse, or made an experiment in metre. But this sort of
  technicality is not tenable in the presence of the poem itself. At least, it
  is not enough to satisfy any one with a strong sense of poetry. The original
  French poem is an honest but somewhat bald statement in very short lines; the
  first line being 'A toy du monde le refui'. Chaucer merely turns his mind to
  the same subject, and bursts out, 'Almighty and all-merciable Queen!' You do
  not produce that sort of line by counting the syllables.</p>

  <p>Chaucer is not expanding his metre; he is expanding himself. He is
  expanding his lungs and his heart, like a man stretching out his arms in the
  pattern of the cross. He only breaks out of the framework of the French
  metre, because there was not room in it to stretch his arms. The mere words,
  as they stand, call up the image of a man so standing; and making some such
  wide gesture of worship. Of course, having once created his lyric metre, by
  merely breaking into his lyric cry, he has to sustain it throughout the poem,
  like any other poet; and sometimes sustains it with some difficulty, or (what
  is worse) with too great ingenuity; also like any other poet. But the poem is
  not a piece of ingenuity; certainly not a piece of metrical ingenuity. It is
  an original poem, in the sense that the emotions have their origin in the
  poet, and not merely in the other poet whose work he had read. I know that;
  as I know when a love-song is a love-song; or whether a drinking song could
  really be sung in chorus. Luckily or unluckily, as the case may be, this is a
  curious kind of love-song. The writer quoted above, remarks, in a tone not
  uncommon also among some of the English writers on the subject: 'The learned
  critic Ten Brink, basing his opinion on this prayer as well as some other
  effusions addressed to the Virgin Mary, which are to be found in Chaucer's
  work, concluded that he must have passed through a period of intense
  devotion, more especially towards the Virgin Mary. That is possible.'</p>

  <p>It is. It does occur from time to time. I do not quite understand why
  Chaucer must have 'passed through' this fit of devotion; as if he had
  Mariolatry like the measles. Even an amateur who has encountered the malady
  may be allowed to testify that it does not usually visit its victim for a
  brief 'period'; it is generally chronic and (in some sad cases I have known)
  quite incurable. And as Chaucer's work, practically beginning with
  translations like the A B C, practically ends with the almost excessive
  devotionalism of the Parson's Tale, and has any number of devotional
  declarations scattered between the two, I cannot understand why his very
  normal European religion should only be allowed to him during one peculiar
  period of delirium. But in any case, the point that concerns us here is that
  Chaucer wrote a poem as well as a translation. It is a poetical poem, not
  because of its relation to its original, but because of its relation to its
  subject. It is full of lines that have a certain large and liberal majesty,
  because they are filled with the greatness of the occasion: 'Glorious maid
  and mother, which that never were bitter, neither in the earth nor sea'&mdash;'O
  very light of eyen that ben blind, O very lust of labour and distress'&mdash;'And
  bringest him out of the crooked street; whoso thee loveth, he shall not love
  in vain.' If this were a translation of a heathen hymn to the sun, it would
  still be the sort which a man only writes by staring at the sun. If this were
  a Scandinavian song of the sea, it would be one which a man writes by knowing
  the sea, and not merely by knowing the Scandinavian song-book. And the purely
  literary moral, apart from any moral moral, of all this passage in the poet's
  life, is that he was already emphatically a poet, even if he was still a
  translator. He is a poet because he sings; because he opens his lungs and
  liberates his soul by a resounding and rhythmic utterance, the expression of
  love or admiration or passionate amazement. It is a primary and not secondary
  expression; as would be proved in answering the question: 'But what is he
  admiring?' Is he singing out in admiration of Guillaume de Deguileville, of
  Chalis, the original singer of the French A B C? No; not at the moment. He is
  singing to the singer of the Magnificat.</p>

  <p>I have begun with this example, not because it is chronologically the
  first, or perhaps even one of the first, examples of that dependence on
  tradition in which Chaucer's work begins; but because it is a clear and
  compact case of the way in which a man may easily be expressing the most
  positive and even passionate feelings of his own, and yet be technically a
  traditional type of translator. This double truth runs through the whole of
  the work of Chaucer, the whole of the work rightly or wrongly attributed to
  Chaucer, and indeed through the whole of the works of his contemporaries,
  which are not by Chaucer at all. The disputes about the actual chronology of
  Chaucer's first writings are such that the most learned are those,
  confessedly, who know that they know nothing. The controversy is
  extraordinarily complex, because of this communal character in medieval
  literature which I have already mentioned. When he was ostensibly writing an
  original poem, he thought nothing of quoting at enormous length from anybody
  who happened to interest him, for any reason. When he was avowedly writing a
  translation, of a recognized Latin or French original, he thought nothing of
  putting in chunks of Chaucer which are not in the original at all. But this
  part of the problem presents itself first, on fairly clear grounds, in the
  case of the two longer and more important works, with which Chaucer certainly
  dealt among his earliest experiments; and in which he appears as a true
  translator, without any particular doubt or disguise about the matter. The
  first example is his translation of <i>The Romance of the Rose</i>; if I may
  frankly translate the title as the poet did the poem. The other was his
  translation of Boethius on The <i>Consolations of Philosophy</i>.</p>

  <p><i>The Romance of the Rose</i> is rather like the Briar Rose of
  Pre-Raphaelite legend. It is very beautiful and rather difficult to get
  through. It is a long allegorical French poem, which was written in two parts
  by two distinct and indeed very different poets. If we compare it to the
  Briar Rose, we may say that the first half contains most of the roses and the
  second half most of the thorns. That is, the first four thousand lines were
  written by one Guillaume de Lorris, and are a grave and graceful allegory of
  the kind that can be traced like a tapestry in the background of the medieval
  mind; the description of a dream, a magical garden inhabited by Virtues and
  other valuable abstractions; much healthier company than many real persons in
  fact or fiction, but not very stimulating to a modern taste. The rest of the
  poem was added nearly half a century afterwards by the satirist Jean de
  Meung. He seems to have declined to accept the medieval convention that
  everything in the garden was lovely; with the result that everything in the
  garden became considerably more lively. Like Chaucer and Langland and the
  best men of the time, Jean de Meung was perfectly orthodox so far as theology
  was concerned; but, like them, and perhaps much more than they, he was
  critical of the growing corruptions and abuses of the Church. His satire was
  enormously fashionable, especially as some ecclesiastics had condemned it;
  just as if it were a modern improper novel. In any case, he was a man of
  ideas, over and above the one idea of the conventional though beautiful
  allegory; and he probably had a great deal of intellectual influence on
  Chaucer. But exactly how he and Chaucer stand to each other in connexion with
  the documents, it is very difficult to decide. It is enough to say here that
  a very long and continuous English version of the French poem does exist, and
  is apparently, or at least partially, by Chaucer; but that Chaucer himself,
  (in the medieval manner of which I have spoken) is said to have confused the
  question further by putting in long passages that do not come either from his
  original or from himself, but are simply things that happened to please him
  in all sorts of other authors; chiefly ancient or classical authors. Possibly
  he may have thought that when something so luxuriant and unlimited as the
  Briar Rose had once begun to grow, there could not be too much of it. But
  this was in his early days, and I fancy that by the time he had developed the
  thrifty and cutting critical quality of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, he would
  have admitted that the beautiful entanglement of the Briar Rose was a bit too
  thick. Nevertheless, his work was never cut in two quite in the style of the
  work he translated; and in him the blossom and bramble remained a fairly
  recurrent design. There was always something courteous about him that would
  not obtrude a thorn without covering it with a rose; and something malicious
  about him which would not offer a rose without hiding a thorn.</p>

  <p>Beyond this, the only general effect of <i>The Romance of the Rose</i> on
  his life is, as has been said, rather the effect of a decorative background.
  It was all this sort of thing that a poet meant by poetry, in the fourteenth
  century; as distinct from his own personal experiments or curiosities in
  poetry; which eventually became much more curious and experimental in Chaucer
  than they did in any of his contemporaries. But this is the starting-point
  of his poetical journey. This is the tradition which he took at first for
  granted as the tradition of his trade; this is the education as distinct from
  the evolution of a poet. All the medieval poets began with this story of a
  dream. We might say that they all began by walking in their sleep; a company
  of singing somnambulists. It is curious to think that <i>he</i> began so; who
  came to be, of all poets perhaps, the most conspicuously wide awake.</p>

  <p>The business of the translation of Boethius touches a general truth, even
  at the beginning, which will become more apparent and important towards the
  end. The relation of medieval men to philosophy, and enlightenment in
  general, was rather curious; and is not covered by the natural metaphors
  employed. We used to talk of the Dark Ages; most of us know by now that the
  true Dark Ages came before the true Middle Ages; and that in many ways the
  Middle Ages were far from dark. But, following the figure of an age of
  darkness, we are apt to think of an age of twilight; or perhaps, of grey
  morning light. But the metaphor itself is misleading. Twilight means an
  equally diffused light; and the difficulty of medievalism was the difficulty
  of diffusion. It would be truer to compare even the Dark Ages to a dark room,
  with certain chinks in the shutters through which particular rays of light
  could pierce. But the light was daylight, what there was of it; and not even
  a dull or troubled daylight. It was broad daylight that came through a narrow
  hole. Or it was like some long narrow ray of a searchlight sent out from a
  great city and falling like a spotlight on a remote village or a lonely man.
  And just as any man, however much in darkness, if he looks right down the
  searchlight, looks into a furnace of white-hot radiance, so any medieval man,
  who had the luck to hear the right lectures or look at the right manuscript,
  did not merely 'follow a gleam', a grey glimmer in a mystical forest; but
  looked straight down the ages into the radiant mind of Aristotle. There was
  indeed, as I have said, any amount of indirect transmission of light; any
  amount of reflection&mdash;in every sense. But I am not talking of the quantity,
  but of the quality of the light. Such light as they had came, not only from
  the broad daylight, but from the brilliant daylight; it was the buried
  sunlight of the Mediterranean. These men seem to be, and in some ways were,
  men simple or primitive. But their philosophy was not merely simple or
  primitive. In some cases it came from a ripe and rounded civilization; in
  some cases even from an over-ripe, from an autumnal civilization; from an
  over-civilized civilization. We might compare them to children in some cold
  and gloomy March, looking at the barns filled with the grain garnered by dead
  men in a forgotten autumn; but anyhow they fed their wild boyhood on things
  that were mature, and sometimes more than mature. Hence we have the paradox
  that a rude and primitive society, in some sense starting afresh, yet had so
  often for its guides, not merely the writers of the old world, but the
  writers of the world when it was growing old. All such paradoxes work back to
  the paradox that the further we go back to the first ages of the modern
  world, the nearer we are to the last ages of the ancient world; as King
  Arthur stands in Britain at once as the first of the Britons and the last of
  the Romans. Thus a primitive poem, like Abbo's 'Siege of Paris', stops amid
  the storm of northern arrows rattling on rude roofs and walls, to make
  mythological conceits that had been copied from the copyists of Ovid or
  Virgil for five hundred years. But Ovid and Virgil are not the less civilized
  poets because barbarians continued to copy them. The men of a new
  civilization were not the less able to understand the civilized poets,
  because they had been continually copied. In a word, medieval men were not in
  the twilight; what they knew they knew. They had not read Homer at all; and
  (strange as it seems in a literate and enlightened age) did not despise him
  because they had not read him. They had read Virgil much more fully and
  thoroughly than we have. Anyone who doubts it may make the experiment of
  quoting beautiful Virgilian lines in a first-class railway carriage, full of
  politicians and captains of industry. In a word, though their knowledge of
  civilized antiquity was in a sense scrappy, though the scraps were not only
  old scraps but sometimes stale scraps, they had enough of them to understand
  what the great ancients had meant by wisdom; and, unlike some others, they
  had the great wisdom truly to try to be wise.</p>

  <p>The case of Boethius illustrates specially the second truth; that the
  spring of medievalism had fed on the autumn of classicism. Boethius was a man
  who lived very late in the break-up of the Empire, under Theodoric. The
  period, with its power of amalgamating old and new, has been much underrated.
  Boethius hands on the Stoic memories; but it is not really necessary to deny
  that he was a Christian or assert that he was a nominal Christian. Many pagan
  philosophers were converted by Christian philosophy. His work was a sort of
  distillation of all that had been best in Paganism; small in quantity but
  good in quality. Thus he served very truly as a guide, philosopher and friend
  to many Christians; precisely because, while his own times were corrupt, his
  own culture was complete. Generally speaking, the cultured Mediterranean man
  had come to play this part towards northern men. His disciples had not read
  Homer, but he had; they did not remember one kingdom acknowledged from
  Scotland to Syria, but he did; they did not know in detail what fine shades
  of feeling or criticism had come with Catullus or Lucian, but he did. Thus
  (in the special case of Boethius) we find this mirror of maturity still
  reflecting a lost daylight in the darkest age; and playing a unique part,
  especially in the development of the English. Boethius, who had been martyred
  for justice by his barbarian master, wrote in prison a book called 'The
  Consolations of Philosophy'; in which he summed up all the truth and
  tradition of antiquity. Alfred of Wessex, the first great man of our own
  island story, wishing to educate his half-savage Saxons, assumes at once that
  it can be done best by translating Boethius. He also, like those who followed
  him, put a great deal into Boethius that is not in Boethius. He may be said
  to have completed the old Stoic's conversion to Christianity after his death.
  Chaucer, perhaps the last great Englishman of the same united Christendom,
  feeling the same need of portable philosophy, instantly turned to the same
  idea of a translation of Boethius. He also quotes from Boethius, consciously
  and unconsciously, in any number of his ordinary poems. Boethius was a point
  of view; it was a calm and cultured and well-balanced point of view; and the
  essential thing to realize is that a medieval man could have it as a common
  and normal point of view; and take it quite easily, like Chaucer.</p>

  <p>All that we mean, in common talk, by 'taking things philosophically' was
  possible to a medieval man like Chaucer, even if we mean no more by
  philosophy than his whistling or shrugging his shoulders. The possibility is
  worth recalling, because it is generally rather left out of sight, both by
  those praising medievalism and those reviling it; by those who most admire
  its mysticism and those who rage most fanatically at its fanaticism. These
  elements, bad and good, did exist; but there were other elements; other
  fragments of the old Roman pavement of the world; other bits of the broken
  Christian empire of Constantine, that a man could pick up here and there. One
  of them was this Christian stoicism, or what would now be called manliness;
  and Chaucer was much attracted to it. We may mention here the handful of
  small poems in which the influence appears; though the dates of all of them
  seem to be rather doubtful. It stiffens the very virile and spirited little
  ballade with its familiar lines:</p>

  <p class="verse">Hold the hye wey, and lat thy gost thee lede:<br>
  And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede.</p>

  <p>Somewhat of the same sort is the moral appeal he addressed to Richard the
  Second on Steadfastness, decidedly a Stoic as well as a Christian idea. The
  remarkable poem, commonly called 'Gentilesse', in which he appeals to
  Christian equality against feudal inequality, might be said to savour of that
  remote concept of citizenship, which had once been left in the code of
  Justinian as the legacy of the Christian Caesars; anyhow, it suggests an
  aspect not always considered in the conventional conceptions of heraldry and
  chivalry. The poem called 'Fortune' opens with a self-sufficing defiance
  quite in the way of the ancients, and invokes the great name of Socrates:
  though Chaucer's sense of humour (a very Christian thing) leads him to let
  Fortune, as a lady, have the last word. The poem called 'The Former Age', a
  sort of Earthly Paradise, is almost altogether a paraphrase from
  Boethius.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, as has been noted, he did deal thus with Boethius and <i>The
  Romance of the Rose</i>. These two translations were translations, whenever
  they were written or whatever was written along with them. When we come to
  the original poems of Chaucer, we come to much disputed matters, especially
  in the matter of chronology. We have very little to guide us except Chaucer's
  own references in his own writing, which are generally very amusing and
  rather disparaging references. We have also the dates of some historical
  events more or less clearly connected with the poems. Thus we know that by
  the time he wrote <i>The Legend of Good Women</i>, whenever that time was, he
  had already written the poem on the death of the Duchess, the wife of John of
  Gaunt; <i>The House of Fame; The Parlement of Foules</i>, and <i>Troilus and
  Criseyde</i>. For in the Legend he makes Love complain that Chaucer has
  mocked lovers in translating <i>The Romance of the Rose</i> and depressed
  their spirits with the tragedy of Troilus. But the leading lady, representing
  Woman, pleads for the poet, saying that although 'he can nat wel endyte'
  (that is, although this writer is unfortunately unable to write), yet he has
  done his best, by producing various very proper works in her praise; and the
  remainder of the list is given as above. As we shall note presently, it
  contains other matter; but it is not certainly a complete list. Many hold
  that these very early writings included the Legend of St. Cicely, as
  afterwards inserted in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>; also perhaps the story,
  or a story, of Griselda, and some fragments of the Monk's Tale. There is also
  a group of very doubtful date; <i>The Complaint of Mars; The Complaint of
  Venus; The Complaint to his Lady</i>; and similar things, all very
  complaining. On the whole, however, the list in the <i>Legend</i> is the
  important one. It is suggested by some that the passage in <i>Troilus</i>, in
  which the poet expresses the hope of writing a 'comedy', refers to <i>The
  House of Fame</i>, meaning that that vision is divided in three on the model
  of <i>The Divine Comedy</i>. It is possible, and we know that Chaucer
  venerated the epic. It seems much more probable to me that the promise of a
  comedy refers to the intention to write <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, or
  perhaps 'The Knight's Tale' as originally separate from <i>The Canterbury
  Tales</i>; or, most likely of all (for those who admit literary men to be
  human beings), some perfectly vague and general intention to go off and have
  a jolly time, after all that weeping; a hazy hope of writing something simply
  human and funny, such as was afterwards largely satisfied in <i>The
  Canterbury Tales</i>. Strictly speaking, indeed, the list is more
  enlightening about the life of Chaucer than about the argument of Love; for
  the poet slips into the list, not only the translation of Boethius, but a
  theological work by Origen on St. Mary Magdalene and a pronouncement of the
  great Pope Innocent III, about the miseries of the poor, which hardly seem at
  first sight to advance the cause of Lovely Woman in pleading before Cupid.
  For that very reason we may take it as certain that Chaucer had written these
  religious paraphrases, along with certain roundels and virelays, presumably
  lost.</p>

  <p>On the whole, it seems most probable that he began his creative career by
  writing <i>The Death of Blanche the Duchess</i>, a sort of family service,
  almost a feudal service, to his patron John of Gaunt; that at some time later
  he wrote The <i>Parlement of Foules</i>, followed by the larger and more
  ambitious enterprise of <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>, and then <i>The Legend
  of Good Women</i>. The Duchess Blanche actually died in 1369, which gives us
  one of the few definite points in the chronology. On our own calculations
  Chaucer would be about twenty-eight, and likely enough to be given a sort of
  minor laureateship to the Lancaster branch of royalty. There is a more
  shadowy possibility of dating <i>The Parlement of Foules</i>, because it
  involves a veiled and tactful allusion to proposals of marriage between
  Richard the Second and Anne of Bohemia: similar allusions to certain stages
  of this Royal courtship have been found in <i>The House of Fame</i> and in
  <i>Troilus</i>. But <i>The Parlement of Foules</i> is practically concerned
  only with these proposals, though in a highly allegorical fashion. Richard
  was actually married to Anne of Bohemia in 1382, but the preliminary
  proposals and suggestions began in 1380. Short of entering indefinitely, not
  only into details but into disputed details, this is about all that can be
  said with certainty of the time and order of these poems; save indeed for one
  separate problem, which arises out of several references to a poem called
  <i>Palamon and Arcyte</i> and an actually existing poem called <i>Anelida and
  Arcyte</i>. Some suppose the former to be simply the story afterwards
  incorporated in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> as 'The Knight's Tale'; others an
  earlier experiment which is lost. The latter is a rather unconvincing
  fragment, full of the laments of some lady whom Arcyte has deserted, but
  linked with the other by the presence of that very English gentleman,
  Theseus, Duke of Athens, destined to play so breezy a part in English letters
  from the <i>Anelida</i> to <i>The Midsummer Night's Dream</i>.</p>

  <p>Those who deal in labels for literature may be surprised to be told that
  the official ode, the feudal family duty, of a lament over the loss of John
  of Gaunt's wife, is in fact a very touching poem. First of all, it seems
  quite incredibly likely that John of Gaunt was really very fond of his wife,
  and that Chaucer was very sympathetic with so deplorably sentimental a state
  of mind. It contains a very noble description of love in marriage; of a deep
  comradeship that has never lost the last intimate veil of courtesy. The point
  is worthy of remark, because those hostile to such normal things have made a
  great hash of history, in their version of the medieval view of marriage.
  Because marriage was made merciless fun of, as it is still; and because love
  outside marriage, or even against marriage, was often pardoned as romantic or
  sympathetic, as it is still; above all, because certain fantastic fashions
  allowed of the public proclamation of the sort of beauty-worship and
  intellectual flirtation that exists still&mdash;because of all this, those who
  understand neither the fantastic nor the normal have pretended that all
  medieval men and women saw love and marriage merely as rivals to each other;
  accepted no marriage except as a dull duty; and enjoyed no love except as an
  illicit enjoyment. But this is all nonsense; not only to anybody who knows a
  little of human nature, but to anybody who knows even a little of medieval
  literature. The truisms remain true, however much fun people may get out of
  the paradoxes; the cynical paradoxes of satire, or the romantic paradoxes of
  adventure. A man imagines a happy marriage as a marriage of love; even if he
  makes fun of marriages that are without love, or feels sorry for lovers who
  are without marriage. That Chaucer was normal in this, as in nearly
  everything else, is abundantly proved by his own printed words. It is true
  that his printed words were poetical words, and will be less perfectly
  understood by those who can only read them as prosaic words. But even these
  can hardly misread them altogether. And anybody who can read poetry as poetry
  knows perfectly well when a poet is weighing his words, in a truly weighty
  fashion, and means exactly what he says. There is something in the sound and
  measure of the words, as of the tolling and swaying of a great bell; and it
  sounds unmistakably when the great Theseus lays before the lovers the
  Christian majesty of the mystery of marriage:</p>

  <p class="verse">The first Mover of the Cause above,<br>
  When He first made the faire chain of Love,<br>
  Great was the effect and high was his intent<br>
  Well wist He why, and what thereof He meant.</p>

  <p>Any man who really understands it does not see a Greek king sitting on an
  ivory throne, nor a feudal lord sitting on a faldstool; but God standing in a
  primordial garden, granting the most gigantic of the joys of the children of
  men. Poetry of this kind is not written by accident; it does not write
  itself. The poet who writes it takes a tone as unmistakable as a change in
  the human voice. Few will say that in this Chaucer was flattering the Duke of
  Lancaster. Fewer still, I imagine, will say he was flattering the Duke of
  Athens. He did not write that sort of thing in his sleep, or in a fit of
  absence of mind. 'Well wist he why, and what thereof he meant.'</p>

  <p>The mixture of nonsense and normality in a healthy man, and the particular
  sort of nonsense which went to make up a medieval man, is very well
  illustrated, in the same connexion, in the case of <i>The Legend of Good
  Women</i>. At first sight they seem a very extraordinary exhibition of Good
  Women. They are selected according to a rather pedantic fantasy, which
  prevailed in the Middle Ages, concerning heroes and heroines who had died for
  love, as a sort of religion. Chaucer himself calls them the Saints of Cupid;
  the martyrs of romance who were to be a sort of decorative pendant or
  parallel to the martyrs of religion. Of the deeper meaning of this historic
  mood there may be something said elsewhere. But the modern reader may
  possibly be slightly amused, when Cleopatra makes her positively first
  appearance in the character of a Good Woman. He will be wise, however, in
  every sense, if he does not fix his eyes only on Cleopatra. He will be very
  unwise if he interprets the whole legend in the light, or shadow, of
  Cleopatra. I mean that he will be wildly wrong if he fancies it to be a
  Swinburnian hymn of harlotry; or supposes that the Legend of Good Women is
  really a Legend of Bad Women. Cleopatra finds herself among the saints,
  because she is credited with what would be called the final perseverance of
  the saints; with constancy, as distinct from inconstancy. But the poem itself
  proves that Chaucer did not think that constancy was necessarily the wild
  constancy of Cleopatra and Anthony, or even of Guinevere and Lancelot. For
  the great queen, the grand heroine, the perfect woman who rules the rest and
  leads them and speaks for them, the lady who is set up as the supreme lover,
  is neither Guinevere nor Francesca nor Iseult. She is Alcestis, the
  long-married woman who went down to Tartarus to deliver her husband. She is
  alone enough to show that Chaucer and his age did not merely separate love
  and marriage. She is obviously put first among the Saints of Cupid because
  she is one of the Saints of Hymen: and is called a Good Woman because she is
  a Good Wife.</p>

  <p><i>The Parlement of Foules</i>, presumed to come in between <i>The Death
  of the Duchess</i> and <i>The Legend of Good Women</i>, does not indeed give
  such scope to such sentiments. It is all about proposals for a marriage, but
  it hardly allows of any such serious emotion about the ideal of being
  married. It is a particularly graceful exercise in that sort of stately
  levity, which is suitable for compliments paid at court, by men who are
  rather more than courtiers. In form it is a fable about an assembly of birds,
  before whom three rival eagles advance their claim to the bird most desired
  as a bride; presumably a reference to the imperial princes who might have
  married Anne of Bohemia. It is not so easy to enter into the darker and more
  delicate psychology of a large bird of prey as of a bereaved husband, with
  whom you happen to be personally acquainted. Chaucer had not yet developed
  that divine impudence, which enabled him to make a cock in a farmyard talk
  like Aristotle and Aquinas about the mysteries of the supreme Will and
  Wisdom. In short, it is a charming parable; but we all feel that the
  Parliament of Fowls would have had a livelier session, if the Cock had been
  returned as a member. With <i>The Legend of Good Women</i> (leaving
  <i>Troilus</i> for fuller treatment) we pass to matters more purely
  Chaucerian, as being more personal and peculiar to Chaucer. In the prologue
  to this poem appears the picturesque and vivid, though quite light and
  unpretentious, personal sketch of the poet. In the livelier and more telling
  manner of his later tales, he tells us something of his own habits and
  humours; how he delights in books; how he is criticized for neglecting his
  neighbours for the companionship of books; how, when he has done his day's
  work with the accounts and ledgers of his various public offices, he does not
  want to go on a holiday but only to sit down with a book. Having worked the
  description up to this point, he gets the full effect out of the one
  exception, and makes quite a dramatic entrance for the Daisy. He owns that,
  when spring first comes on the fields, he suddenly flings away his books and
  goes down into the daisy-meadows to drink of a deeper delight.</p>

  <p>The special feeling of Chaucer for the daisy, among the flowers of the
  field, has often been remarked, and both the personal taste and the popular
  tradition illustrate a sound instinct in medieval symbolism. A man might
  really learn more of the special spirit of Chaucer, by looking at daisies,
  than by reading a good many annotations by dons and doctors of literature. If
  he did toil laboriously in the long tangles of The Romance of the Rose, it is
  true to say that he opposed to it something fresh that might be called the
  Romance of the Daisy. We might even carry the figurative parallel further,
  and say that at one end or extreme of poetry is all that Walt Whitman meant
  by <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, the acceptance of the common even in the sense of
  the chaotic or incomplete, and at the other extreme the symbolic and almost
  heraldic Rose of the medieval allegorists; and that between that garden and
  that grass the exquisite and temperate medium or transition was really
  expressed in the daisy, or the first fresh realism of Chaucer. I am not
  denying the worth of any of the three types of poetry, from the wildest to
  the tamest; and I offer every apology to the grass. But when we talk of wild
  poetry, we sometimes forget the parallel of wild flowers. They exist to show
  that a thing may be more modest and delicate for being wild. And that
  atmosphere is exactly the atmosphere of Chaucer and of daisies. Certainly
  some of Gower's garden roses were tolerably tame flowers. But this is not
  meant in the modern 'ruthless' realistic spirit. When we say that Chaucer's
  flowers were wild flowers, we do not mean that they went on like wild beasts.
  We mean that there is a certain freshness and freedom about their very
  slightness or subordination, and it is this sort of unmistakable air that
  comes to us in Chaucer, like a cool wind across a meadow.</p>

  <p>I am aware, of course, that some industrious critics have suggested that
  all this was not only formal but even fictitious, and that Chaucer intended
  some elaborate compliment to some lady whose name was Marguerite. This is
  quite possible, as advanced by the best Chaucerian scholars, but there is a
  type of student who advances it to lay waste the whole daisy-meadow. He has a
  curious subconscious itch in the presence of poetry; an itch for explaining
  it, in the hope of explaining it away. But this sort of critic is in any case
  unreliable, because, in dealing with a poem, he cannot distinguish between
  its occasion and its origin. He is the sort of commentator who, listening to
  the enchanted voice of Oberon telling of mermaids and meteors and the purple
  flower, is chiefly anxious to assure us that the imperial votaress was
  certainly Queen Elizabeth, and that there actually was a pageant at Nobbin
  Castle, for a wedding in the Fitznobbin family, in which a cupid and a
  mermaid figured in such a manner as completely to explain William
  Shakespeare's remarks&mdash;and almost explain William Shakespeare. It is all
  quite probable; it is all quite true: by all means, let us be gravely
  grateful for the information. There were doubtless a good many pageants and a
  good many parades of Cupid and Dian; and I dare say a great many mermaids on
  a great many dolphins' backs. But, by an odd chance, only one of them ever,
  in the whole history of the world, uttered such dulcet and harmonious breath
  that the rude sea grew civil at her song, and certain stars shot madly from
  their spheres to hear the sea-maid's music. That is the kind of thing that
  has rather a way of only happening once. And if we really must find out where
  it came from, or why it came, we shall be wise to guess that it had a good
  deal less to do with the Mermaid at Nobbin Castle than with that other
  Mermaid at which Mr. William Shakespeare of Stratford sometimes took a little
  more wine than was good for him. In the same way, any appreciator of poetry
  as poetry knows that the medieval poet had a real kinship or sympathy with
  daisies and what they stand for, quite apart from whether or no he used them
  for personal purposes on particular occasions. It is quite possible that
  Chaucer took pleasure in the pun about the daisy when he was in love with
  some lady called Marguerite. It is much more probable that he had to pay some
  conventional compliment to a lady called Marguerite, and jumped at the chance
  of using a little thing he had already written about daisies. But anyhow it
  was he who wrote it, and it was about daisies that he wrote; and anybody who
  cannot see that cannot see that Walt Whitman liked grass because it is rank
  and ragged or that William Morris liked roses because they are symmetrical
  and symbolic. The whole picture he contrives to suggest, of his rising at the
  faint call of May, and leaving his books, and going forth like a shadow to
  find the green meadows under the grey dawn, is full of a certain kind of cool
  and colourless intoxication which would call up a crowd of daisies in any
  imaginative mind, even if he had never mentioned them. If he knew anybody
  called Marguerite (and shared with the professors that profound scholarship,
  of the school of Stratford-atte-Bow, which reveals that Marguerite is the
  French for daisy), he would very probably mention that. It has been similarly
  ascertained that a lady named Rose has sometimes been compared to a rose,
  and, I presume, a lady called Rhoda to a rhododendron. But a poet, and his
  particular kind of poetry, are really to be judged by the fact that he
  prefers to talk most of roses, or rhododendrons, or sunflowers, or
  poisonous-looking orchids, or daisies in the fields of morning. His selection
  of such things strikes the note which he wishes to strike, and lets us
  realize the things of which he likes to dream. In this sense the selection
  and use of the daisy is Chaucerian; individually and unmistakably Chaucerian;
  it is one of the clues to Chaucer. It may be remarked that whenever he uses
  the word elsewhere, though in a casual connexion, it has the same sort of
  freshness and felicity. Among those splendid and spirited sketches in the
  Prologue of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, slashed in with a few strokes as
  verbally fastidious as Stevenson, we are told that the jolly red-faced
  Franklin, or country squire, in whose house 'it snowed meat and drink', had a
  beard 'as white as a daisy'. There could hardly be a better example of
  Chaucer's brilliant brevity of description. If he had said white as frost or
  snow, it would have been banal and suggested some senile decay. As it is, he
  conveys that even the blanching of the man's beard seemed to make him look
  more lusty and lively. Finally, as a last lesson from the daisy, it seems
  probable that the poet was quietly aware, so to speak, of the rather large
  and daring significance of the derivation of daisy from the eye of day; which
  gives to that small object something apocalyptic like the sunrise, and a sort
  of claim to be the eye of the whole earth. It is notable, because it connotes
  that something, which was kept rather quietly in the background, but which I
  have called elsewhere the greatness of Chaucer.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, the personal preface of <i>The Legend of Good Women</i> naturally
  rather overshadows the legend itself; but even in the latter the interest is
  not altogether impersonal. Chaucer is chaffing himself, more or less, upon an
  imaginary charge of being a misogynist, and represents Love as charging him
  with having done great wrong to lovers, and notably to ladies. This, as has
  been said, seems to refer chiefly to <i>The Romance of the Rose</i>, which
  seems a little unfair; it is hard if a man, who has had the toil of copying
  out and translating such an interminable poem, should have also the burden of
  defending all its sentiments. But it is notable that the poet sets himself
  politely but decisively to the task of disproving his hatred of women. He
  does it all the more energetically because it was a very unnecessary task.
  Chaucer certainly did not hate women, let alone lovers; he did not hate
  anybody. At any rate, whether it be a strength or a weakness in him, he did
  not hate anybody much. All his talents were on the side of sympathy, even
  when they seem to take the form of satire. That is where he really does
  differ, for instance, from Dante; and there is something rather national
  about the difference. But indeed Chaucer had written or was about to write a
  more complete answer to the charge than is found in <i>The Legend of Good
  Women</i>. So far from thinking ill of women whom he was expected to admire,
  he managed to think well, or at least to think kindly, of a woman whom the
  whole world expected him to deride and despise. In the <i>Legend</i> he
  praised each woman in turn, for being a faithful lover. But he could not
  bring himself to curse a woman, even for being a false lover. The curious way
  in which this corner is turned, with a curve rather than an angle, is one of
  the most singular and individual qualities in the poem that probably he wrote
  most carefully and seriously, and intended to be the outstanding creation of
  his career.</p>

  <p>There is nowhere a more whimsical, or even weird historical product than
  the story of Troilus and Criseyde. To begin with, it is a myth made out of a
  mistake; or what would now be a misprint. There never was any person called
  Criseyde, even in the sense in which there was a person called Helen. She is
  only the corruption of the name of somebody else, who was entirely different.
  And yet this walking misquotation walks the world as a more living creature
  than most legendary figures quoted on the highest authority; this talking
  typographical error not only talks to us, in an animated manner, in an
  unmistakably human voice; but also with a new voice that strikes a new note
  in human history. The tale of Troilus and Criseyde is an anachronism, an
  anomaly; in some sense a prodigy and a portent. It is a Homeric story of
  which Homer had never even dreamed. It is a posthumous Pagan myth belatedly
  born centuries after the death of Pagan mythology. It is a medieval romance,
  invented by medieval men, who seem to have managed to revere it as a part of
  pagan Antiquity, and to have practically forgotten that they had made it up
  out of their own heads. Finally, it is a Christian story entirely about
  Pagans; it is full of the particular sort of moral sensitiveness and sense of
  spiritual freedom which alone makes possible certain sorts of criticism; and
  especially of self-criticism. Criseyde is a Christian creation because she is
  a Minx; and a Minx is a product of the culture of Christendom.</p>

  <p>Many even among educated readers may not be aware that the name of
  Criseyde is all that the Dark Ages had left of that very harmless person
  Briseis, the beautiful slave whom Achilles and Agamemnon each claimed as part
  of the spoil of war. It illustrates the difference between the two
  atmospheres, that the former lady is a passive instrument of fate, while the
  latter lady is a very active example of the abuse of free will. Briseis is
  blameless because she is blind. Cressida is even false, in order to show that
  she is free. Because Briseis was beautiful, the dogs tore on the Trojan plain
  the limbs of mighty chieftains: 'Such was the sovereign doom and such the
  will of Jove.' But because Cressida was something more than beautiful, was
  something of what men have come to call romantic; because she was wilful and
  mysterious and incalculable, Diomed is wounded and Troilus is slain; and
  bards lament, reproaching, not Jove, but Criseyde. Nobody had ever thought of
  reproaching Briseis. With this extraordinary medieval postscript to the
  Iliad, we come upon an entirely new world of curious and even complicated
  feeling; produced by the overflowing of medieval mysticism into the old jests
  and tragedies of love and lust. It is seen at its finest in Chaucer's version
  of the tale, because Chaucer was perhaps the man with the finest feelings in
  that age. It is a basic blunder to suppose that he was superficial, merely
  because he had a light touch. A light touch is a mark of strength and not
  weakness, in spiritual as in bodily things; and (in those days especially) to
  be in that sense superficial was a way of avoiding being intolerably
  sentimental.</p>

  <p>It is a commonplace that this tale was treated both by Chaucer and
  Shakespeare; and it is rather a misfortune that we generally think first of
  the version that was written last. Anyhow, it illustrates a certain
  difference (of which there will be more to say later) to note that the
  Renaissance version, compared with the medieval version, is certainly
  livelier, and certainly not happier. It is the liveliness of the second
  fermentation; and what in Chaucer was still wine, in Shakespeare is very like
  vinegar. The chalice of Chaucer does indeed contain the dark wine of tragedy
  and the lamentation of lovers. But he laments chiefly for true lovers, and
  even when he implies the existence of false lovers, he never begins to imply
  that all love is false. Indeed his simplicity contains a subtlety that is not
  always justly valued, and can hardly be too carefully considered. When I say
  it is a new note, I do not mean of course that there was anything new either
  about jeering at lovers or raving at false lovers. I mean that there was
  something new in the particular way in which Chaucer balanced both so as to
  produce neither; the way in which Chaucer did not jeer and did not rave; but
  jested without jeering and reproached without raving. The charity of Chaucer
  towards Cressida is one of the most beautiful things in human literature; but
  its particular blend belongs entirely to Christian literature. Pagans had
  felt the agony and anomaly of true love given to the false lover; but the
  mixture was never a blend like this. Catullus, the most subtle and (as some
  would say) the most modern of the ancients, had reached the paralysing
  paradox of 'I hate and I love'. But the particular Chaucerian tone cannot be
  translated as 'I hate and I love'; it is something more like a combination of
  'I adore and I pity', with 'I pity and I condemn'. Again we feel, if only for
  a moment, that it was not quite so absurd to talk of putting 'Daunt' into
  English; for many have felt the same fine shade in the feeling of Dante about
  Francesca.</p>

  <p>But even apart from the more merciful view taken by Chaucer&mdash;even in the
  case of the rather merciless view taken by Shakespeare (which was indeed the
  view originally taken by Boccaccio)&mdash;there was a mystical medieval element in
  all this tragedy, or bitter comedy, about false love. It might almost be
  translated into theological language as a sense of the insecurity of the
  souls of others; though the theologians, to do them justice, generally urged
  us to begin with a sense of the insecurity of our own. I know of course that
  Chaucer does once, in a sort of noble weakness, snatch at a sort of fatalism
  as an excuse for his heroine; chiefly because he really cannot think of any
  other excuse. He is heart-broken about it: but this does not alter the new
  universal tone of <i>moralizing</i> about love. It is not fanciful to see
  something of a new spirit, even in the spiritual sense, in this closer
  vigilance touching the problems of the weak and wavering human will. It is
  really, for reasons on which we shall remark later, a sort of shadow thrown
  by a mystical and metaphysical cloud upon the classic and flowery fields of
  pure poesy. The medieval world did incessantly talk about true lovers and
  false lovers, where the classical world would often have been content to talk
  about lovers. And though there are many false lovers in classic fable, it is
  interesting to note that their falsehood does not really discredit them; and
  the false lover is the true hero. Theseus is not less the Athenian hero
  because he deserts Ariadne; nor Aeneas less the pious Aeneas because he
  deserts Dido. But a new note has crept into laments like that of Anelida and
  Arcyte; a suggestion that the false lover is the false knight, and has broken
  some bond of chivalry. All this atmosphere, heavier with moral responsibility
  and self-determination, was not unconnected with the special social ideals of
  feudalism; and the notion of a wandering knight still owning dependence on a
  distant lord. But it was also deeply affected by that religious idea, which
  denied doom and substituted damnation or salvation determined by the will;
  the spirit that made Dante acclaim freedom as the first of divine gifts, or
  made Chaucer contradict Calvin, centuries before he was born, in the very
  first words of the Parson's Tale. In the very centre of that Christian
  cosmos, everything pivoted on the idea that the human heart could be given to
  God or withheld from him. The highest affections of the soul could turn this
  way or that, to the divine or the diabolic; and the supreme charity was
  valued because it was not enforced. It is rather a grim joke that the main
  tenet of the most orthodox creed might be summed up as Free Love.</p>

  <p>Another new step, or rather a new stride, is taken in literary progress
  with the publication of Chaucer's version of <i>Troilus</i>. It concerns the
  character of Pandarus; and Pandarus really is a character. With him we have
  the first full appearance of Chaucer as a humorist; that is, of Chaucer at
  his broadest and best as a benefactor of humanity. The character of Pandarus
  does indeed sprawl through that very lengthy poem rather lazily, like the
  limbs of a giant where they have room to stretch themselves. The author has
  not yet achieved that brilliant brevity, that power of dashing in a whole
  personal description in a few strokes, which he developed later in <i>The
  Canterbury Tales</i>. The humour of Pandarus is not quite so humane as the
  humour in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>; it is sometimes deliberately
  unpleasant; but it is the humour of a humorist. It is also important, in the
  matter of the general literary transition, to notice the points in which
  Chaucer changes the tale as he had read it in older versions. It is very
  significant of his independent craving for character that he turns Pandarus
  from a young cousin to an elderly uncle. Bernard Shaw said somewhere, very
  truly, that the vigour and virility of Rembrandt are best shown in his
  preference for painting old women rather than young ones. There is the same
  sort of clean and interested love of character in Chaucer's excellent
  descriptions of elderly men; such as the Franklin and the Knight. It must not
  be forgotten in relation to this change in the romance of Troilus. As has
  been noted already, the whole story has a very eccentric evolution from its
  Greek origin, and had already gone through curious changes. Criseyde was once
  Briseis; and Pandarus was not always a pandar. It seems to have begun with
  the usual graceful friendship of two youths, Troilus and Pandarus; pretty
  much like Damon and Pythias or Pylades and Orestes. But Pandarus had to take
  on, more or less, what was known in later theatrical circles as the part of
  Charles's Friend. And it was an almost inevitable implication, even in modern
  theatricals, that Charles's Friend was rather more cynical than Charles.
  Anyhow, Troilus's Friend became very cynical indeed; and the part he has to
  play, of bringing the lovers secretly together, lent itself easily to the
  less-pleasing jocularity of medieval and Renaissance literature. Thus, by the
  time of Chaucer, Pandarus has become a funny old man; and, by the time of
  Shakespeare, he has become a decidedly nasty old man. But, for the moment of
  medieval transition, the point is that Chaucer made the young man old,
  because he wished to make the character at once more ripe and more quaint,
  more experienced and more fixed. In that sense the character of Criseyde's
  uncle takes the new road as the first of the Canterbury Pilgrims; the first
  of that great and gay procession of the English comic characters, which has
  not ended with Falstaff or with Pickwick. We must not exaggerate the
  proportions of the change; the Chaucerian art is still mainly dominated by
  the serious romance of medievalism; with decoration for its form and
  sentiment for its substance. Only the less serious passages which are filled
  by Pandarus suggest the beginning of that new and powerful use of the comic,
  which seems sometimes almost more tremendous than the tragic.</p>

  <p>I do not know whether it is one of Chaucer's jokes (and I am sure he made
  many jokes that nobody knows) when he appends to this apparently interminable
  poem, consisting of no less than eight thousand, two hundred and forty-six
  lines, the cheerful comment, 'Go, little book; go, my little tragedy.' But in
  any case it is profoundly significant that he adds to this the remark that he
  hopes some day to be able to write, 'Some comedy.' This has been variously
  interpreted; even in the sense that he meant <i>The House of Fame</i> to
  resemble <i>The Divine Comedy</i>. But it seems to me more likely that he had
  found the one comic character in his tragedy so amusing a study that he hoped
  to produce some more; or, in other words, that he found Sir Pandarus such
  good fun that he had already guessed, perhaps, that his greatest talent
  pointed towards such achievements as the Wife of Bath or the Nun's Priest's
  Tale.</p>

  <p>On the whole, we may say that in <i>Troilus</i> we find that Chaucer, who
  was already a good poet, is beginning to be a great poet. There were depths
  and delicacies of regret, when the heroine entirely declined to be heroic,
  which were not possible in anything like <i>The Legend of Good Women</i>;
  where the heroines stood in a row, all being resolutely heroic. There could
  be a directness, even an excessive directness, about the jokes of Pandarus,
  which was not to be expected in the indirect diplomatic discussion of an
  international alliance, as explained by eagles. Chaucer has become
  Chaucerian, and emerges as a man of genius distinct from the many men of
  talent, who could then be counted on (if officially required) to go to sleep
  and dream of a house of gold or a garden of lilies. But when all this is
  allowed for, it will be well to realize also that all Chaucer's work, up to
  <i>Troilus</i> and including <i>Troilus</i>, come under a certain general
  description, that hardly applies to <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, and are
  conducted within a framework of conventions, from which he afterwards broke
  away. In other words, the great poem of <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> is
  possibly the last and certainly the best of the series of works written
  primarily under the power and magic of that special sort of Romance which
  turned love as it exists between lovers first into a sort of philosophy and
  then into a sort of religion; a thing that had both its grammar and its
  gospel; both its science and its asceticism. It is true that it would affect
  many robust rationalists as merely amounting to sentimentalism. But there was
  much more in it than that; as there was much more in Rossetti or Swinburne
  than appeared to the satirists of aestheticism in <i>Patience</i> or
  <i>Punch</i>.</p>

  <p>Indeed that wood of wandering lovers, with their figured garments and
  burning pallor, and insistence on the kinship of desire and death, is a very
  easy thing to make fun of. A modern man may legitimately smile at the curious
  convention, by which it appears to be necessary for anybody in love with a
  young lady to collect a large number of other young ladies, and tell them all
  about it, and elaborately thank them for their gracious sympathy and their
  highly exemplary patience; yet the man with the superior smile may not
  realize that he is being superior to Dante. He may think himself much more
  robust than the medieval lover who swoons when the conversation takes a
  discouraging turn; or the poet who weeps over the death of an abstract person
  called Pity, because his young woman (in more robust language) has turned him
  down. Yet it may be questioned whether the modern man really is more robust
  than Chaucer; or even half so robust. Nor would he find it easy to laugh at
  Chaucer very long, without beginning to have a dark suspicion that Chaucer
  was laughing at him. The truth is that Chaucer included this phase of
  romantic and visionary passion, and many other things as well. But he
  included it because God had given him a remarkable talent for seeing what
  good there was in things; and there was a great deal of good in this. A man
  vowed to this religion of romance may appear to us very effeminate in his
  emotions; but he might easily need to be very virile in his experiences. He
  could be called upon to fight; to die; and, what is worse, to wait. Professor
  Pollard, who certainly has no medieval battle-axe to grind, remarks in his
  excellent study of Chaucer that the discipline of such lovers was rather
  severe and noble than merely weak and self-indulgent. The really important
  point, as a point of biography and history, is that, however stale we may
  find it now, it seemed at that time fresh, because it really was fresh. The
  <i>Vita Nuova</i> really was the New Life; there had been nothing exactly
  like it before, in all the history of love.</p>

  <p>Romance was a strange by-product of Religion; all the more so because
  Religion, through some of its representatives, may have regretted having
  produced it. But it is quite obviously the transfer of the tragic
  responsibilities of the Faith to the field of almost pagan passion. It is
  sometimes said that Christianity has been weak and ineffectual. The truth is
  that it has been so powerful and effective that it coloured even the things
  it had not hoped to influence; and changed its enemies as well as its
  friends. Even worldliness, when it did not become otherworldliness, became
  another sort of worldliness. Even the Church, as imperfectly represented on
  its human side, continued to inspire even what it had denounced, and
  transformed even what it had abandoned. Anyone who judges by living facts,
  and not by dead details, can see the Christian ideal remodelling even the
  Pagan image in its own image. In a word, Chaucer was right (as he generally
  was) when he talked, with pleasant blasphemy, about the Saints of Cupid. They
  were in one sense saints; because they were in one sense martyrs. He could
  talk about martyrs of love more reasonably than modern rationalists talk
  about martyrs of science. But both are in this sense rational; that a martyr
  really means a witness. And these two types are indeed witnesses. They are
  witnesses to the necessity, which forces irreligion to borrow the terms of
  religion.</p>

  <p>In short, whether or no this or that Christian may choose to oppose
  romance or chivalry, it is quite certain that without the Christians there
  would never have been any romance or chivalry to oppose. It is also perfectly
  true that there was a great deal of romance and chivalry which it would have
  been quite sensible to oppose. The period during which Chaucer lingered in
  this literary garden, extends from his first official poem on the Death of
  the Duchess to the completion of <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>. But it includes
  one or two less pivotal poems, of more doubtful date, in which this sort of
  garden had perhaps rather run to seed. One is the work called <i>The Death of
  Pity</i>, to which I have already referred; another is <i>The Complaint of
  Mars</i>, and perhaps <i>The Complaint of Venus</i>; and <i>The Complaint to
  His Lady</i>, apparently a continuation of the former. These things are more
  shadowy and have a more shadowy relation to Chaucer; but they obviously have
  a relation to this contemporary Romance. Whether they are by the poet or no,
  they belong to this period of poetry; and it is well that this period should
  be understood. In the final phase of <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> it can be
  fully understood; and Chaucer fully understood it, in its limits as well as
  its liberties.</p>

  <p>This religion of romantic love had till lately all the advantages, and has
  now all the disadvantages, of having been revived by the Victorians. 'Love Is
  Enough', which was the title of one of William Morris's plays, might have
  been the motto of all William Morris's period. Rossetti and Browning, as well
  as Tennyson and Mrs. Browning, wrote always with this implication, right or
  wrong, of identifying the ideal morality with the higher sentiment of sex. We
  were all more or less brought up in that tradition, which contains a real
  truth; but we all know that there has been of late a reaction against it;
  rather an excessive reaction, beginning with Mr. Bernard Shaw and ending with
  Mr. Aldous Huxley. There are only two considerations in this connexion which
  affect a fair judgment of its earlier appearance in the age of Chaucer. The
  first is this; that, for all the advance of rationalism and science, the
  medieval romanticist was much more of a realist than the modern romanticist.
  The medieval poet did not deny that love-stories could end badly; it was the
  Victorian novelist who invented the idea that they must always end well. The
  medieval man may sometimes have been a sentimentalist; but, to do him
  justice, he was not an optimist. He did not pretend that this particular kind
  of emotion, healthily popular as it is, and eternally attractive as it is,
  has only brought happiness and never unhappiness to human beings. The true
  lover was often tragic; the inspiriting thing about him was simply that he
  was true. Whatever therefore may be justly urged against the mere cushioned
  comfort or upholstered respectability of Victorianism, certainly cannot be
  urged against the thorny thickets and visionary vigils of medievalism. The
  second fact to remember is even simpler and more to the point. It is that
  Chaucer, having paid a magnificent tribute in <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> to
  all that is really generous and humane in the worship of a highly
  medievalized and almost Christianized Cupid, does finally give his judgment;
  and his judgment is not in favour of the cult of Cupid but against it. In a
  series of verses of great beauty and power, as Professor Pollard has noted,
  he gives his ultimate decision that happiness is not to be found by dancing
  after any heathen god of love; but by looking up, as he bids all the 'young
  fresh folks' to look up, to where a more terrible but a more tender god of
  love hangs, not on Olympus but on Calvary. Thus, in relation to the whole of
  this business, of the medieval ideal of True Lovers, which Chaucer every bit
  as much as Browning can treat at its very truest, we may say that Chaucer was
  large enough to be delighted by the vision; but too large to be deceived by
  it. His claim to greatness gains on both sides; and he will not suffer by any
  cynical psychological discoveries, which the latest sceptics may imagine they
  have made about the falsity of Romance. If the nineteenth century deified
  Romance, if the twentieth century deserts Romance, the great medieval Maker
  is equally master of that vision; four hundred years ahead in seeing it; and
  five hundred years ahead in seeing through it.</p>

  The Canterbury Tales</h2>

  <p class="first">To watch the unfolding of the genius of Chaucer is to watch
  a pattern changing into a picture; or into a series of pictures. It is
  something like the illusion of a sick or sleepy child, staring at a
  wall-paper, for whom the flat plants seem to branch and blossom, or figures
  to begin to move among the formal trees. His work begins with the purely
  rhythmic decorative style that possessed medieval prose and verse, even more
  than medieval painting and carving. It ends with something more than the
  realism of Renaissance pictures; with something suggestive of the realism of
  modern novels. There is even a sort of paradox in it; that in his vigorous
  and adventurous youth he was formal; in his comparatively crippled and
  limited old age he was free. When he was a young soldier, fighting sword in
  hand against the spears of France, or a young traveller and political agent,
  dealing with delicate crises in the cities of Italy, his style of writing was
  still as rigid a pattern as the prison-bars that enclosed Palamon and Arcite.
  When he was something more like a shabby old pensioner, stout of body and
  lean of purse, limited, as it were, to the view from his own lattice looking
  towards the Abbey and his own future grave, he broke out into a dance of
  lively and dramatic detail that reminds us rather of Dickens or of Balzac. We
  see him gradually breaking those flowery chains of his youth, and then living
  to sow such very wonderful wild oats in his old age. It is in itself an
  inspiriting sight, and the outline of a gallant story. But, for all that, we
  must not exaggerate one side of the matter, or imagine that he merely escaped
  from a prison to a free hostelry and highway, when he fled from the House of
  Fame to the Tabard in Southwark.</p>

  </div>

  <p>For instance, it is well to remember that the purely medieval Chaucer has
  been an inspiration, even more, if possible, than the purely personal
  Chaucer. Art critics are now everywhere returning to that medieval sense of
  rhythm in art, and many literary men, long before, returned to it in
  literature. William Morris was a Socialist and in his time a typically modern
  man; what is very much more important, he was a typically manly man. He was
  eminently sane, hearty and healthy; and his broad face and leonine beard were
  in a sort of symbolic way felt as types of freedom and fraternity. But the
  Chaucer who inspired Morris was the Chaucer of the long elaborate pageants
  and allegories; even more than the Chaucer of the last brief excursion into
  the coarse comedies of daily life. A man wandering through the coloured
  corridors and labyrinths of the long decorative tales of The Earthly Paradise
  does sometimes feel a little like a fly crawling across a wallpaper. But that
  paper is a fly-paper that has attracted a good many flies. A Cambridge
  professor of chemistry whom I knew, a man whose whole main business was
  material modern science, had for his whole conception of a hobby or a holiday
  an endless journey in those realms of gold from the Glittering Plain to The
  Wood At The End Of The World. Mr. George Moore, who still manages to be a
  modern man of our time as well as his own, delights above all things in the
  decorative poetry of Morris; especially in the most meaningless parts of it,
  like the recurrent emblem of 'two red roses across the moon'. Now nearly all
  this inspiration was drawn, not only from Chaucer, but from the early
  romantic Chaucer as distinct from the later realistic Chaucer. If the hero of
  <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> seems to be an unconscionable long time dying,
  the hero of <i>The Life and Death of Jason</i> also seems a little leisurely
  in his life and slow in getting to his death.</p>

  <p>The moral is obvious enough; that what we call the length and even the
  monotony of medieval literature is a human pleasure and a human need, in
  certain moods and moments of mankind. It lay like an infinite inviting sea in
  the background of the fourteenth century. It returned like a refreshing and
  copious flood to the dry and dusty respectability of the nineteenth century.
  And, in the case of Chaucer, our very admiration for his later discoveries
  may make us exaggerate the futility of the traditions he inherited. Sir Topas
  may create a false perspective, rather as Don Quixote creates a partly unjust
  retrospect. Readers infer from the novel of Cervantes that the old romances
  were all rubbish; though Cervantes goes out of his way to explain that they
  were not. Readers may remember the name of Sir Topas as a satire on chivalry,
  though in fact it follows on a very noble exaltation of chivalry in the
  person of the real Knight; the Knight who is without a name. Something of the
  same irony may even be found in the lives of the two men of genius. For
  Chaucer, who travesties Topas, had figured in armour and armorial bearings in
  the most florid period of the wars of chivalry; the terrible tourney of the
  Leopards against the Lilies. And Cervantes, credited with despising and
  destroying romance, had himself lived one of the most wildly romantic lives
  in history; escaping from slavery among the Paynims of Africa, and wielding a
  sword and losing a hand in the deathless death-grip of Lepanto.</p>

  <p>There is, then, something to be said for the long poetical allegories
  eventually abandoned by Chaucer; as for the long prose romances ultimately
  satirized by Cervantes. Their very extension and expanse satisfied a
  psychological need now perhaps only felt by children and poor people, who
  like to have a very big book for their money. Yet there are few cultivated
  moderns who have not felt something of the pleasure of being able to lose
  themselves in the longest books of Dickens or Trollope. But there is more in
  it than that; for man lives by his devouring appetite for morality. The
  chivalric romance does really represent the Christian conception of life,
  which is at once a Quest, a Test and an Adventure. And the decorative
  allegories, that seem so dead to us, were once alive like a dance with the
  balanced morality of the Middle Ages.</p>

  <p>Dante makes the very heavens dance, in the last pages of the Paradiso;
  sweeping the sky with swaying and spinning ballets of angels and spirits; and
  the symbol is very appropriate to the philosophy. It is appropriate; not
  because the dance stands for disorder, but because it stands for order. The
  dance is in its nature a rhythmic and recurrent thing, returning upon itself;
  and was therefore a perfectly correct and orthodox type of medieval moral
  theology. This, by the way, will be noted by the intelligent as correcting
  the exaggerated solemnity, with which some scholars have taken the tirades of
  fanatical friars, and other people, against the use or abuse of dancing.
  Doubtless there was much that was really pagan left in popular dancing, and
  doubtless there were plenty of donkeys in holy orders who found paganism in
  what was not really pagan. But in face of a fact like Dante's vision of the
  celestial dance, it is not tenable that the medieval mind thought of dancing
  merely as immorality or indecency. Nobody would describe people as doing in
  heaven what he had a deep and indignant horror of their doing on earth.
  Mahomet would not describe his Paradise as a place where the faithful were
  incessantly occupied in carving and worshipping idols. The Pacifist would not
  point happily to a future life in which everybody would be always waving
  sabres and firing off guns; the Prohibitionist would not picture heaven as a
  state of perfection in which the blessed could drink rum and gin for ever and
  ever. And Dante would not have filled the skies with dancing, if he had
  instinctively thought of the dance as degrading. The truth is, of course,
  that he instinctively thought of the dance as decorative and rhythmic, and
  therefore corresponding to a certain character in his whole conception of
  life. Indeed, it marks the whole difference between medieval life and modern
  life.</p>

  <p>A certain break or sharp change in history can hardly be sketched more
  sharply, than by saying that up to a certain time life was conceived as a
  Dance, and after that time life was conceived as a Race. Medieval morality
  was full of the idea that one thing must balance another, that each stood on
  one side or the other of something that was in the middle, and something that
  remained in the middle. There might be any amount of movement, but it was
  movement round this central thing; perpetually altering the attitudes, but
  perpetually preserving the balance. The Virtues were like children going
  round the Mulberry Bush, only the Mulberry Bush was that Burning Bush which
  they made symbolical of the Incarnation; that flamboyant bush in which the
  Virgin and Child appear in the picture, with Rene of Provence and his beloved
  wife kneeling on either side. Now since that break in history, whatever we
  call it or whatever we think of it, the Dance has turned into a Race. That
  is, the dancers lose their balance and only recover it by running towards
  some object, or alleged object; not an object within their circle or their
  possession, but an object which they do not yet possess. It is a flying
  object; a disappearing object; and, as some hold, a disappointing object. But
  I am not concerned with condemning or commending either the religion of the
  Race or the religion of the Dance. I am only pointing out that this is the
  fundamental difference between them. One is rhythmic and recurrent movement,
  because there is a known centre; while the other is precipitate or
  progressive movement, because there is an unknown goal. The latter has
  produced all that we call Progress; the former produced what the medievals
  meant by Order; but it was the lively order of a dance.</p>

  <p>When we understand this dance, we understand the order or pattern of the
  early poems of Chaucer; and above all why he does not seem to be in any hurry
  to finish them. Judged by our higher standards of hustle and pep, the
  Canterbury Pilgrims do not seem to be in a very great hurry to get to
  Canterbury. But they are like American tourists in the pace they observe, in
  getting to the pilgrims' goal, compared with the pace of Pandarus or Phoebus
  in getting to the point. But this leisurely quality is bound up in the very
  nature of the work, or play. A dance is a thing enjoyable in itself, and
  given such a dance of gods and heroes, it can go on for ever. A journey, if
  it is enjoyable on account of its object, is not equally enjoyable if it goes
  on for ever. I know that some moderns have tried to confuse at once the
  metaphor and the mind, by pretending that the joy of the journey is in
  something that can never be enjoyed. But this is a confusion. If they could
  express themselves clearly, they would either say that the journey is itself
  the goal, or else that the journey is hopeless and only an illusion makes it
  hopeful. Otherwise, they are out on a tramp that has no end, to find an inn
  that has no existence. The more reasonable progressives profess to envisage
  an end of some kind, and when praising the goal naturally tend to foreshorten
  the journey. These are the authors of Utopias and plans of perfect social
  reform. But the poet, who is describing a dance of virtues, or a pageant of
  beauty, has naturally no particular impatience that this should itself end.
  And something of this lingering love of his own day-dream unduly prolongs his
  own description. It has the effect, especially for modern readers, of making
  much of such medieval writing dull. But even if we find it dull, let us not
  suppose it was the product of dullness, when it was the product of
  delight.</p>

  <p>Of course, even these early works of Chaucer, on the old medieval model,
  are of very varying merit. <i>The Book of the Duchess</i> is a very
  affecting, because a relatively young and innocent, version of human grief;
  <i>The Parlement of Foules</i> has already more of the freedom of the fable
  about cocks and hens; <i>The Legend of Good Women</i> has moments in which it
  almost turns into a graver though certainly not greater <i>Canterbury
  Tales</i>; and the tale of Troilus and Criseyde, though to us inordinately
  long, has high and magnificent passages that are worth the toil of reading
  anything ten times longer. The point here, however, is that there is a sort
  of break in the story of Chaucer's style, and that the break came
  comparatively late in his story. He probably regarded the tale of Troilus as
  his supreme work, and the Canterbury Pilgrimage as a more casual postscript.
  His masterpiece is a kind of afterthought.</p>

  <p>It might be maintained that, in the very act of leading his coloured crowd
  out of the Tabard and the town, and along the open road, Chaucer symbolized
  something of the change from the medieval balance to the modern march; from
  the philosophy of the Dance to the philosophy of the Race. Few modern racing
  men, fewer still among modern racing motorists, will regard the journey as
  much of a sporting event. Few journeys have a greater air of leisure; and
  nobody, certainly, will suggest that it was a race in which the best man was
  meant to win. The fact that the Reeve always rode at the tail of the
  procession will be sufficiently balanced by the fact that the Miller
  apparently rode at the head of it. Here at least the medieval poet can have
  meant no allegory of spiritual superiority. But there is also a serious
  element in the idea of the Canterbury Pilgrimage which makes the Pilgrims'
  Way something more than merely the open road. So far as having a definite
  purpose is concerned, the Pilgrim of Chaucer is as genuine as the Pilgrim of
  Bunyan. He is not in such a hurry because he is not in such a horrible
  fright; and there is no question of the Franklin or the Squire putting his
  fingers in his ears and fleeing from London as from a City of Destruction.
  But he is none the less really fleeing to Canterbury as a City of Salvation.
  Anyhow, he is not merely wishing to escape into the wilderness and leave all
  cities behind. I shall discuss in a moment the really new element which the
  poet half consciously introduced into his long comedy of travel; the element
  of delay, or what a medieval man would have called dalliance. But though he
  admits a good many things besides pilgrimage and piety on this side of
  Canterbury, he does not admit anything beyond Canterbury. His scheme of
  travel is still dominated by the idea of a definite purpose, and the fresh
  forces which entered literature at this stage were more subtle, more
  subconscious, and more difficult to judge with delicacy, than a mere
  procession or progress into the void.</p>

  <p>I know it was commonly said, both in medieval times and modern times, that
  the pilgrimage had become a mockery, by which it seems to be meant merely
  that it had become a holiday. But it was because it had been a popular shrine
  that it became a popular holiday. That this involved all the revelry,
  buffoonery, drunkenness and incidental swinishness of all sorts that belonged
  and still belong to a popular holiday, we could learn easily enough from
  Chaucer's own description, if we had not already learned it from our own
  common sense and experience. But Chaucer himself is very careful to put first
  the solid fact that a great many people, at least, did really wish to render
  thanks to St. Thomas of Canterbury for help in their past sickness; a good
  proportion of his own pilgrims are certainly religious people acting from
  religious motives. The truth is that, in this matter, I am again haunted, I
  might almost say tormented, by that little query which I put in the first
  pages of this book; the query that runs, 'But what of to-day&mdash;and what of
  to-morrow?' If it was a scandal to have religion mixed with riot or
  profanity, has it been such a complete cure to have riot and profanity
  unmixed with religion? If it was superstition to venerate the bones of a
  great man killed by a tyrant, is it any more intelligent that millions of
  clerks should go down and merely gape at the Sea, without having even the
  sense to worship Neptune? Is it more dignified that bankers should give us a
  St. Lubbock's Day on which nobody thinks of St. Lubbock; not even to the
  point of adoring colossal images of ants and bees? Simon of Sudbury, Bishop
  of London, had denounced the popular profanation of the pilgrimage. The
  Wycliffite tradition, and afterwards the Puritan tradition, has treated him
  as a hero. He may have been a hero, but he was not a prophet. He did not know
  what was going to happen to popular religion, when it had lost the Canterbury
  Pilgrimage. The truth is that anybody who tries to look at Simon of Sudbury's
  problem from both sides, from front and behind, will realize its real
  difficulty; but will incline to a simple if slightly impatient conclusion. He
  will be tempted to say that human beings are not to be trusted with a
  religion. But are they therefore to be trusted the more without a
  religion?</p>

  <p>Chaucer died and left his last great work unfinished; his most perfect
  achievement still imperfect. Though he lived a long and busy life, he, more
  than any other great writer, died young. He had only come to the beginning
  when he came to the end. He was already old when his work became suddenly and
  entirely new. There have been cases of men trying a new trick or experiment
  and breaking down in the middle of it, as did Dickens in the detective-story
  of Drood. But the experiment was a small one; which he might have made at any
  time, and one which many others had already made. There are cases of an
  author in his last days writing something rather separate and unique, like a
  last confession or farewell; as did Shakespeare with the unearthly loveliness
  of <i>The Tempest</i>; or, in another way, Ibsen in the rather
  incomprehensible outbreak of <i>When We Dead Awaken</i>. But these were
  things not to be developed or extended further, even by their authors, let
  alone by anybody else. For good or evil, they were not things that could be
  done twice. Nobody could write another play like <i>The Tempest</i>; nobody,
  I should imagine, wants to write a play like <i>When We Dead Awaken</i>. But
  <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, the last unfinished work of Chaucer, is in quite
  another sense unfinished and finished. It is not only a new scheme, but a new
  style. It is not only a new style, but potentially a new school. It is as if
  he had been an architect, who through a long and successful life had planned
  out the round arches of the Romanesque and the squat pillars of the Norman
  churches, and then, almost on his death-bed, had dreamed of and designed the
  first Gothic cathedral. For indeed <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> do remain
  rather like a huge, hollow, unfinished Gothic cathedral with some of the
  niches empty and some filled with statues, and some part of the large plan
  traced only in lines upon the ground.</p>

  <p>Just as in such a case, the arches would stand up more strongly than the
  statues, or the walls be made first and more firmly than the ornament, so in
  Chaucer's work the framework is finer than the stories which correspond to
  the statues. The prolonged comedy which we call the Prologue, though it
  includes many interludes and something like an epilogue, is made of much
  stronger material than the tales which it carries; the narrative is quite
  superior to the narratives. The Wife of Bath's Tale is not so good as the
  Wife of Bath; the Reeve's Tale is not so vivid as the Reeve; we are not so
  much interested in the Summoner's story as in the Summoner, and care less
  about Griselda than about the Clerk of Oxford. The Miller does not prove even
  his own rather brutal energy, by telling a broad and rather brutal story,
  half so well as the poet conveys it in those curt and strong lines about his
  breaking a door by butting it with his red-bristled head. And the whole
  conception and cult of Chivalry is no better set forth, in all the seventy
  pages that unfold 'The Knight's Tale,' than in the first few lines that
  describe the Knight.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to say for certain, of course, whether Chaucer realized
  how much more real and original were the passages which concern the Pilgrims
  than those which concern their imaginary heroes or martyrs. It is possible
  that, like many another great original genius, he did not know which parts of
  his own work were really original, still less which were really great. It is
  likely enough that Shakespeare attached more importance to some laboured
  conceit, in the manner of the Euphuists, than to such stabs of staccato
  speech as 'Kill Claudio!' or 'Undo this button'. It may be that Chaucer
  really did regard the Prologue as a mere frame, in the sense of a
  picture-frame. In that case, we can only say he invented a new kind of
  picture-gallery, in which the picture-frames are much better than the
  pictures. Still, a word must be said for the understanding of the pictures,
  even when he had boldly stolen them out of other people's picture-frames. In
  other words, we must understand something about stories as stories, before we
  even open this medieval story-book.</p>

  <p>I have taken too much notice, perhaps, of those who are still so childish
  as to talk about the childishness of Chaucer. I mean in the sense of bearing
  with him, as if he talked broken English. It would be truer to say he talked
  the unbroken English, which we have since broken up into bits and snippets of
  American slang or jaded journalese. There is rather more sense of a rounded
  whole, in expressing the religious sentiment in words like 'Almighty and
  almerciable Queen', than in saying, 'Up-to-date scientists admit worth-while
  qualities in religious urge'. I leave it to the most modern critic to decide
  which sounds like English and which like Pidgin English. I have pointed out
  that the poet was not in fact infantile or immature in any contemptible
  connotation of the words; but in many ways an experienced and even a polished
  person. He was an artist who picked perfect words to produce his exact
  effect; he was a diplomatist who was probably himself picked out for his
  power of picking his words tactfully and persuasively; he was a philosopher
  who drew theoretical distinctions, along the lines of contemporary thought,
  with almost the delicacy of a theologian; he was a well-read man, who could
  collect stories of all shapes and colours from the ends of the earth; whose
  fancy could follow the mazy mythology of Ovid, and whose intellectual
  imagination could measure the starry stature of Dante. But I confess that
  there is a real element which might rightly be called childishness, if the
  term be used in a healthier sense, for something that may or may not have
  grown up, but has not grown old. There is a quality in Chaucer, and in the
  whole civilization that produced Chaucer, which men of rather wearier
  civilizations must make a certain effort to understand. It is something that
  moderns have mainly praised in childhood; because moderns have not preserved
  it in manhood. It is gusto; it is zest; it is a certain appetite for things
  as they actually are, and because they actually are; for a stone because it
  is a stone, or a story because it is a story. If that is merely simplicity,
  he was simple. If that is merely stupidity, he was stupid. That is, if we
  would appreciate him or his age, we must go back to something that stirred in
  us when we first found that the door of a doll's-house would open; or when we
  first found that the end of a story could be the point of a story, as in the
  surprise that ends the admirable story of Puss in Boots. Chaucer and his
  friends were really capable of reacting to those surprises; of waiting
  patiently for the point of those stories; of treating the whole narrative
  process as a pleasure in itself. Most modern people cannot really do this;
  they have read too many novels. They have forgotten the very verbal meaning,
  by which novels once meant news. They have lost the positive pleasure in a
  double fashion; partly because they have been bewildered by too many plots;
  partly because they have been even more bewildered by the newer sort of
  novels, which have not got any plots.</p>

  <p>Now when we talk of Chaucer, or for that matter of Shakespeare and many
  others, as borrowing plots, or copying plots, or repeating plots, we must
  always remember that the age was really simpler in the sense that there were
  fewer plots; and that a plot was a very precious thing. It was really prized,
  unlike many other precious things. It was prized because it had a point, and
  people were normal enough in their nervous system to start at the prick of
  the point; instead of having their dead minds punctured all over with old
  pricks, like the diseased arm of a drug-fiend. A mere anecdote was thought
  worthy of careful presentation, as a relic was worthy of a casket of jewels.
  The medieval man spent, or wasted, music and ornament and developed detail
  upon a pointed story; just as the more subtle modern novelist wastes them
  upon a pointless story. The point to seize is that the people involved were
  really so far simple, or (as I should say) so far receptive, as to regard a
  mere story as something rich and rare; something that was a gift; something
  that was a good in itself. Most of the Canterbury Tales, and especially the
  first and most finished of them, are good in themselves. I mean they are good
  even apart from the way in which this particular man of genius presented
  them. We may say, if we like, that Chaucer's stories are excellent, only they
  are not Chaucer's. But we must realize that Chaucer thought they were
  excellent, and enjoyed them as much as if he had invented them. We must not
  leave out the love of mere naked narrative in the men of medieval times.
  Every one knows, for instance, the outline of 'The Knight's Tale;' how two
  friends quarrelled for the same lady-love and were condemned to settle it by
  combat; how one knight prayed to Mars to give him the victory, but the other
  knight prayed to Venus to give him the lady. It is a good story; it would
  make a good play; if a play were still a thing with a plot. Everybody knows,
  I suppose, the plot of the Pardoner's Tale, which is a plot in the precise
  sense; of how three thieves went to find Death to slay him, and found only a
  heap of gold; and how one was sent to fetch food and wine, which he poisoned,
  while the others plotted to stab him and did so; so that they all found Death
  on their heap of gold. That is a good story, and contains a grim crescendo of
  dramatic action. This element of mere pleasure in narrative must be allowed
  for, in all accounts of the atmosphere of the age. For instance, the story of
  Griselda, as a moral story, must be balanced with a great mass of medieval
  jokes and satires about the woman ruling the roost, and the grey mare being
  the better horse. But the story of Griselda, as a story, is simply one of the
  numberless legends and fables about a person passing successfully through a
  series of tests or trials; like the weird tasks of Michael Scott or the
  Twelve Labours of Hercules. Men listen to it, as children would listen to it,
  merely to see how the person passed through his or her misfortunes to the
  end. If this sort of innocent intensity be called childishness, it is true
  that the age of Chaucer was childish. But we must recover something of the
  spirit in order to understand the age; we must sink back into that barbaric
  past, and far beyond it into dark depths of primitive instinct, and even
  endure to hear some cry out of prehistoric savagery commanding us to become
  like little children.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, there is another side; and an aspect in which the pictures
  are extremely picturesque. It is a commonplace of the critics that the actual
  stock of stories, which fill up the framework of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>,
  is a borrowed stock from all sorts of sources, like the plots of the plays
  of Shakespeare. But the narrative poet had at least one opportunity of
  showing dramatic talent which was denied to the dramatist. Shakespeare did
  not have to offer each of his comedies as the creation of one of his
  characters. We only know that Hamlet liked a particular play about Hecuba and
  that Theseus could put up with a particular play about Pyramus and Thisbe.
  We are unilluminated touching the theatrical tastes of King Lear or Macbeth.
  But Chaucer had a collection of characters almost as diverse in dignity or
  indignity, and had to select a story for each. The stories are chosen with
  admirable art; with much more aptitude than some speeches in some dramas.
  Nothing could be more fitting than the sustained nobility of 'The Knight's
  Tale;' a tapestry of heroes clad in gold, except perhaps the ragged and
  rending contrast that tears it at the end, when the Monk is just about to
  begin his dignified recital of the deaths of kings, and the drunken Miller
  roars him down with his cataract of coarse, not to say foul narrative; an
  admirably managed collision of comedy; as if the ruffian had thrown a pail of
  slops over the statelier story-teller. But other examples, which are less
  well known, illustrate the same persistent neatness of impersonation. What
  could be more apt than making the dignified anti-clerical Doctor careful to
  narrate, not a Christian or even romantic story, but a story of the stoic
  virtue of heathen Rome; the story of Virginius, precisely the sort of hero
  whom such secularists have always preferred to the saint. How right it is
  that the chivalric romance of the young Squire should differ from that of the
  old Knight, in having a touch of the Arabian Nights about it; a more
  irresponsible and fabulous flight, upon a winged horse, into the golden
  horizons of Tartary. Equally delicate is the instinct which makes the
  Prioress, the refined and charming spinster, tell the beautiful legend of the
  child singing down the street on his way to the crown of martyrdom; or the
  Father Confessor of the nuns, a comfortable humorist of the type rather
  common as the male adviser of devout females, tell a sort of playful parable,
  full of nods and winks, in which the weaknesses of humanity are courteously
  covered by the feathered costume of cocks and hens. It is more generally
  recognized that the quarrel between the Summoner and the Friar is vigorously
  illustrated in their respective narratives, and the same sort of interplay of
  tales occurs in many places throughout the whole. Perhaps nothing is more
  characteristic of the Wife of Bath's Tale than the enormous and inordinate
  length of the Wife of Bath's Prologue. One is momentarily reminded of the
  proportions between one of Mr. Bernard Shaw's plays and one of Mr. Bernard
  Shaw's prefaces. Nobody will say that the Wife of Bath bears a marked
  resemblance to Mr. Shaw; for of all the Pilgrims she was possibly the least
  Puritan. But her glorious and garrulous egotism, her unfathomable and
  inexhaustible vitality, are quite admirably hit off in the mere fact that she
  talks about things in general at such interminable, if not intolerable
  length, long before she gets to the beginning of her story at all. Chaucer,
  with his typical shrewdness, has not supplied any such long personal preface
  to any of the other stories. There are, of course, any number of other minor
  examples of the same aptitude; indeed there are very few of the stories that
  are in themselves entirely impersonal, or could have been shifted to any
  other person. It is not for nothing that the comfortable and prosperous
  Merchant tells a tale that is rather naughty, in the manner of a French
  farce, but not gross in the manner of the Miller's Tale. I will not debate
  the case of the Cook's Tale, specially called 'Gamelyn', because I know its
  authenticity is very doubtful. Finally, there is the supreme example that I
  have already given, of the irony of the Rhyme of Sir Topas. I mean the fact
  that the poet's own story is the only unpoetical story. The tales are always
  appropriate; and the inappropriate is the most appropriate of all. Chaucer
  has distributed caps to fit the heads of the whole company; and when he
  reserves the dunce's cap for himself, it is all the more fitting because it
  does not fit.</p>

  <p>If, then, we regard the stories in a dramatic light, as connected with the
  characters and quarrels of the storytellers, we can stretch our minds to take
  in a general conception of the work which Chaucer was doing, whether he knew
  he was doing it or not. The whole work takes on the character of a Novel, the
  first true Novel in history. In it the fundamental logic of most previous
  storytelling is already reversed. The story-tellers do not merely exist to
  tell the stories; the stories exist to tell us something about the
  story-tellers. The novel of character has appeared, and the novel of
  character is something rather different even from the epic, let alone the
  allegory or anecdote or story with a point. For though the great epic poets,
  Homer above all, have sometimes a very strong sense of character, still their
  ultimate motive is a true movement towards a crisis or an act; a
  turning-point of time illustrative of the fate of man or the will of God.
  Homer has made a real character of Hector, but the subject of the Iliad is
  not the character of Hector, or even the life of Hector; it is the death of
  Hector, and the death of Hector is the doom of Adam. It is quite different
  with that more modern form of art for art's sake, which may be called
  character for character's sake. We could not expect to have Hector talking
  for ever in his tent; as we should like to have Falstaff talking for ever in
  his tavern. One could not go wandering aimlessly with Orlando and Ruggiero as
  one could with Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, or with Mr. Pickwick and Sam
  Weller. There would have to be a Quest of some kind, that is, an ultimate
  epic action; the epic is always a <i>chanson de geste</i>. And in the same
  way, nobody perhaps would have been more surprised than Chaucer to be told
  that he had added or discovered something that is not to be found in Virgil.
  Yet it is true that we might be interested in a Knight who never got to
  Canterbury, as we could hardly be interested in a Trojan hero who never got
  to Rome. In the novel of character, characters are companions; and <i>The
  Canterbury Tales</i> is the grand original of all such works, because they
  appear in companionship.</p>

  <p>Indeed I rather wonder nobody has tried to turn it into a novel. Many have
  made a paraphrase; including some cases in which it might rather be called
  parody. But, oddly enough, the experiment which would be the most frivolous
  seems to me the most fascinating; and I am rather surprised that it has never
  been tried. There have been renderings of the medieval poet into modern
  verse, and renderings into a sort of medieval prose. There have also been
  renderings into a more or less modern prose. But I have never seen what I may
  call a rendering into modern fiction. I wonder that somebody, especially
  among the novelists, has not tried his hand, merely as an experiment or a
  joke, at turning the Prologue and framework of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>
  into the form of a modern novel. The thing might be done, of course, in very
  different degrees of seriousness or silliness or pure satire. It would be
  quite unhistorical to turn the medieval crowd into a modern crowd; for in a
  thousand things all the characters are really medieval. But, like many
  anachronisms, it would be a great joke. It would be amusing to see how far we
  could really get along with the Host as a modern hotel-proprietor, the Knight
  as a retired Colonel knighted for his military services, the Clerk of Oxford
  as an Oxford don, the Franklin as an ordinary country gentleman with a good
  estate, the Doctor as a modern doctor, the Parson as a modern parson, and so
  on. It would be historically illuminating to see what could be done; still
  more historically illuminating to note what could not be done. For the
  moment, however, I do not mention this imaginary modern novel with any wild
  intention of attempting to write it. I mention it as the shortest and
  sharpest way of conveying, to the modern reader, what seems to me the amazing
  genius of Geoffrey Chaucer as a novelist.</p>

  <p>It is not a question of the broad comedy or farce which is most commonly
  mentioned by the critics, as in the unedifying quarrels of the Summoner or
  the Miller. It is a thread of thoroughly sound and thoughtful psychology that
  runs through almost all the interchanges, rather especially in the passages
  that are comparatively quiet. I will take only one example to illustrate what
  I mean. It is an example that I have never seen noticed, though doubtless
  some of the very able Chaucerian students have noticed it. But I rather fancy
  most people have not noticed it, because it is not anything in the way of an
  insult, but is rather a compliment. Only it is exactly the compliment that
  would be paid by that particular sort of person, to the other particular sort
  of person, at that particular time and place. I mean the passage in which the
  Franklin, the hoary but hearty old squire, with the big appetite and the
  beaming geniality, listens to the tale told by the other or medieval sort of
  Squire, the young gallant who is the son and attendant of the Knight. This
  young gentleman has pleasing manners, and I suspect a certain modest
  self-complacency, but he has been taught to treat his elders with respect,
  and to mingle such courtesy with his natural high spirits. He tells a tale
  which is of the nature of a fairy-tale, as compared with many of the others;
  a fine fantastic fable about a king who had a magic ring and a magic horse;
  there is nothing else notable about it, except that he evidently tells it
  with fluency and gusto and makes himself, more or less consciously, rather a
  fine figure in the company. At the end of his story comes one of those minor
  humours which reveal the real novelist's grip on human nature. The old
  Franklin, who has been listening, I imagine, with a slightly gaping gravity,
  impressed by the continuity rather than the content or precise meaning of the
  monologue, seems to shake himself, assumes an air of massive and venerable
  solemnity, and ponderously compliments the young man on having said his
  little piece. He informs the youth (if we may so translate him) that he is a
  credit to his family and upbringing; that he has performed his duties in an
  eminently satisfactory manner, and generally that he is almost a model to his
  generation. Then the thought behind all this begins to shape itself, and the
  old gentleman introduces the lamentable subject of his own son, who is (it
  would seem) a most prodigal and unprofitable social character; quite unlikely
  to go out of his way to entertain the company by telling, or even leaving
  half-told, the story of Cambuscan bold. The rest of the old squire's speech
  consists entirely of regrets and gloomy prophecies about his own absent and
  unpresentable offspring. Now that is a living incident that leaps at the eye;
  a story that comes straight out of the things that really happen. It is as
  quiet and as real as Jane Austen. It has only to be translated into the
  language of a modern novel, and it would be as vivid even to the modern
  novel-reader. He would instantly see the poor old gentleman shaking his head
  and saying (entirely irrelevantly, because some other young man had just
  finished a recitation), 'Ah, I only wish <i>my</i> boy could be made to
  understand, &amp;c., &amp;c.' It reminds one of that situation which
  Stevenson truly said would make an excellent comedy; in which two grumbling
  old fathers had each a sort of half-jealous, half-argumentative, admiration
  for the son of the other.</p>

  <p>Now there are any number of little lively scenes like that, in the
  intercourse of the characters in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>. They are filled
  with that truth that is especially the truth of fiction. I mean that Chaucer
  knew exactly what sort of person he meant by the Franklin and exactly what
  sort of person he meant by the Squire; and therefore knew exactly what they
  would say to each other, even in a contingency that he had not yet especially
  considered. The characters have been already built up by innumerable small
  touches, and, improbable as it may sound in such a connexion, nearly all the
  seemingly accidental touches are actually used, or do actually tell, in the
  full development of the comedy. There would not be that particular touch of
  comic pathos, about the poor old Franklin's disapproval of his son, if the
  Franklin himself had been primarily a moralist or a model of austerity and
  abnegation. The fact that we know the old man to be himself rather a jolly
  old heathen, enormously fond of food and drink, gives him somehow all the
  human helplessness of a very normal father. Similarly, it was not for nothing
  that we were told of the young Squire, long before he began to tell the
  Squire's Tale, that, with all his gaiety, he was meek and serviceable, and
  carved before his father at the table. It was exactly that touch of deference
  in the young dandy, that probably produced the vague but vastly favourable
  impression which moved the Franklin to speech. We can imagine the young man
  anywhere, even in a modern novel. He would be the sort of young man from
  Oxford, who is very careful to address an older man as 'Sir'.</p>

  <p>And all this was done when the world had never so much as dreamed of a
  novel, in the modern sense of a mere study of the fine shades of fictitious
  character. This was done in an age of rigid religious allegories, of flat and
  decorative romances of chivalry, of stories having indeed a hundred merits of
  harmonious pattern or verbal melody, of spiritual idealism or intellectual
  symbolism; but hardly as yet even the beginnings of what we now call the
  psychological element in narrative. Chaucer did it alone; he did it almost by
  accident; he did it by sheer moral imagination, in a style of which there
  were as yet no models to emulate and no rules even to break. It was like the
  first portrait drawn in a world that had known nothing but patterns.
  Beautiful patterns indeed, and ingenious and intellectual patterns, and
  patterns showing a profound knowledge of mathematics and their relation to
  metaphysics; but with never a line or a curve in them calculated to teach
  anybody how to begin the particular picture of a face. It may be said that
  this is too sweeping a description of the world of literature to which
  Chaucer had access, and so in a sense it is; but it will be found, I think,
  that the exceptions really prove the rule. Dante, for instance, most
  certainly had a profound sense of a human character, in the deeper sense of a
  human soul. I think it probable that it was this sense of individuality in
  Dante that so profoundly attracted Chaucer; and made Chaucer, with an insight
  remarkable at the time, prefer the bitter exile of Ravenna to the resplendent
  Laureate of Rome. But even the case of Dante does not meet the particular
  point I mean. The reason is not merely that Dante could not, by the very
  nature of his work and plan, develop the delicate and light comedy in
  consideration here. Nobody would expect to find the joke about the Franklin
  and the Squire cheerfully introduced into the Circle of Ice or mentioned in
  passing by St. Bernard when discoursing on the Beatific Vision. But the
  reason is deeper than that. It is the reason given, with great insight and
  wisdom, by Mr. W. B. Yeats, when he said that tragedy swamps character while
  comedy consists in character. Dante deals with those huge and heroic passions
  which are simply human or superhuman; but in any case overwhelm the small
  differentiations that make all the fun of comic fiction. The Franklin is
  essentially one particular father grumbling over one particular son, in one
  particular set of highly amusing social circumstances. But the cry of the
  father in Dante, as it comes out of the Tower of Hunger, is simply the cry of
  fatherhood. I am not claiming for Chaucer the very highest power of tragic or
  typical expression, which is not so much the voice of men as of man. But I do
  claim for him that his comedy of character was of the finest; but above all,
  that it was the first.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, if we are to understand the medieval world, but still more
  if we are to understand the modern world, we must recur to the real limit or
  term set to the long-drawn-out comedy of the Canterbury Pilgrims; the limit
  which is Canterbury. It is true, as I have said, that this original and
  astonishing adventure in literature does bring in all that we value most of
  the fiction of the present; but it also brings us to a certain blank or doubt
  about the fiction of the future. The Novel was a speciality of the nineteenth
  century; precisely because it did seem, in the lull of the liberal
  enlightenment, possible to study mere individuality or idiosyncrasy; and to
  study it in a world of eternal leisure. It was not for nothing that the
  three-volume novel was found in the seaside library. There was a sort of
  suggestion of an endless holiday, in that study of character for character's
  sake. I do not mean that it was not, or is not, or will not always be, a
  normal and even noble intellectual interest. I mean that the age of the great
  novelists took the holiday for granted: assumed that the basis of the human
  brotherhood could never be broken up. The real trouble is this; that after a
  certain point of intellectual differentiation, the brotherhood is broken up.
  In a revolution, men will not stand still to be studied. In a fundamental
  philosophical disagreement, men will not even agree about what is worth
  studying. This modern division is masked by the mildness of modern manners.
  The Conservative clerk and the Socialist clerk do not bawl and bellow at each
  other as did the Miller and the Reeve; but they disagree with each other much
  more than did the Miller and the Reeve. And when the Socialist actually acts
  as the Communist, even the mildness has been known to be modified. It is also
  masked by a modern mysticism, which leads many to feel quite honestly that
  they can do without the definite goal of the journey. But while this may mean
  for some a growth of sympathy, it means for most a break-up of sympathies.
  There is nothing to keep the Pilgrims on the same Pilgrimage.</p>

  <p>The truth is that the broad religion creates the narrow clique. It is what
  is called the religion of dogmas, that is of facts (or alleged facts), that
  creates a broader brotherhood and brings men of all kinds together. This is
  called a paradox; but it will be obvious to anyone who considers the nature
  of a fact. All men share in a fact, if they believe it to be a fact. Only a
  few men commonly share a feeling, when it is only a feeling. If there is a
  deep and delicate and intangible feeling, detached from all statements, but
  reaching to a wordless worship of beauty, wafted in a sweet savour from the
  woods of Kent or the spires of Canterbury, then we may be tolerably certain
  that the Miller will not have it. The Miller can only become the Pilgrim, if
  he recognizes that God is in the heavens as he recognizes that the sun is in
  the sky. If he does recognize it, he can share the dogma just as he can share
  the daylight. But he cannot be expected to share all the shades of fine
  intellectual mysticism that might exist in the mind of the Prioress or the
  Parson. I can understand that argument being turned in an anti-democratic as
  well as an anti-dogmatic direction; but anyhow the individualistic mystics
  must either do without the mysticism or do without the Miller. To some
  refined persons the loss of the latter would be no very insupportable
  laceration of the feelings. But I am not a refined person and I am not merely
  thinking about feelings. I am even so antiquated as to be thinking about
  rights; about the rights of men, which are extended even to millers. Among
  those rights is a certain rough working respect and consideration, which is
  at the basis of comradeship. And I say that if the comradeship is to include
  the Miller at all, it must be based on the recognition of something as really
  true, and not merely as ideally beautiful. It is easy to imagine the Knight
  and the Prioress riding to Canterbury and talking in the most elegant and
  cultivated strain, exchanging graceful fictions about knights and ladies for
  equally graceful legends about virgins and saints. But that sort of sympathy,
  especially when it reaches the point of subtlety, is not a way of uniting, or
  even collecting, all the Canterbury Pilgrims. The Knight and the Prioress
  would be the founders of a clique; as they probably were already the
  representatives of a class. I am not concerned here with whether the modern
  mind prefers its pretensions to popular breadth or its claims to creedless
  spirituality. I am only pointing out that it cannot have both at once; that
  if religion is an intuition, it must be an individual intuition and not a
  social institution; and that it is much easier to build a social institution
  on something that is regarded as a solid fact. Now, however strange it may
  seem, the men of the Middle Ages did regard the miracles of St. Thomas of
  Canterbury, and the help given them from heaven by his intercession 'when
  that they were sick', as examples of a solid fact. There was any amount of
  human historical evidence for such miracles; and they were too ignorant and
  primitive to have learnt to prefer determinist theory to historical evidence.
  And as all men desire health, and as even the worst men may ask heaven for
  help in ill-health, and as few except the very worst would refuse altogether
  to be thankful for being healthy, the whole purpose and attitude of the
  Pilgrimage rested on a reality recognized by all sorts of people, good, bad
  and indifferent. A religion of miracles turned all this crowd of incongruous
  people into one company. A religion of moods would never have brought them
  together at the tavern, far less sent them trotting laboriously to the
  tomb.</p>

  <p>That is perhaps the deepest difference between medieval and modern life,
  and the difference is so great that many never imagine it, because it is
  impossible to describe it. We may even say that the modern world is more
  religious, in that the religious are more religious. Anyhow, there is nothing
  to prevent a modern mystic being as mystical as St. John of the Cross; and
  doubtless many students of St. John of the Cross are even now approaching his
  sanctity. But we may be practically certain that if there is a modern man
  like the Miller or the Reeve, he has not got any religion at all. He
  certainly would not go on a religious pilgrimage, or perform any religious
  duty at all. One of the quarrels in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> sounds
  exactly like a quarrel in a public-house to-day, between a boisterous bookie
  and a surly north-country groom. It is still possible to find two such
  persons in a public-house; it might be possible to find them in a public
  conveyance going down to the Derby. But how are we to stretch our minds so as
  to imagine the bookie and the groom deliberately going together to
  Glastonbury, solely to inquire into the recent psychic phenomena supposed (by
  some) to be connected with the Holy Grail? That is the measure of the
  difference between Chaucer's age and our own. That is the measure of the
  difference between an objective religion, worshipped as an object by the
  whole people, and a subjective religion, studied as a subject only by the
  religious. There is something much more dramatic and challenging than the
  disagreement of the Summoner and the Friar: and that is the agreement of the
  Summoner and the Friar. They would never even have come together to quarrel,
  except in a social system that fundamentally assumed them to agree.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Canterbury Pilgrimage takes on a very symbolic social character,
  and is indeed the progress which emerged out of the medieval into the modern
  world. All modern critics can take pleasure in the almost modern realism of
  the portraiture; in the variety of the types and the vigour of the quarrels.
  But the modern problem is more and more the problem of keeping the company
  together at all; and the company was kept together because it was going to
  Canterbury. It will be another business, if the variety of companions
  discovers a variety of aims. It will raise a new problem if the Miller, with
  his appetite for more vulgar noises, refuses after all to go to Canterbury
  and insists on going off to Ramsgate; possibly the scene of sports in which
  he bore away the Ram. It will be a different thing, if the Merchant firmly
  refuses to ride beyond Chatham, because all his interests are limited to the
  progressive industry of that wealthy and dirty town. Darker days will come,
  when the Prioress, not content with pitying mice, will withdraw to a
  Vegetarian Hostel on the hills of Westerham, inhabited by cranks; while the
  now aged Knight, swearing that the Service is going to the dogs, and that
  these damned pacifists haven't a damned patriotic instinct left, shall devote
  himself furiously to the fortifications of Dover. As their counterparts stand
  to-day, it is easier to imagine the Wife of Bath wanting to go sunbathing at
  Margate, or the Clerk instantly returning, with refined disgust, to Oxford,
  than to imagine either of them wanting to toil on together to a particular
  tomb in Canterbury. For the moment, this division of heart is masked by a
  certain heartiness, in the modern pursuit of mere games and pleasures; but
  you cannot make a complete social system out of games and pleasures. You
  cannot, in some dark hour of peril, ask thousands to die for the Derby, or
  even to be taxed to death for the International Golf Championship. A nation
  that has nothing but its amusements will not be amused for very long.
  Moreover, the amusements are at least as narrow as the devotions and
  dedications. You will not persuade the Clerk of Oxford to go to Ramsgate,
  merely to see the Miller win the Ram. You will not persuade the Miller to go
  to Oxford, which might well have been named, at that time, after the Dumb Ox
  of Philosophy: St. Thomas of Aquin. But they were both ready to go together
  to the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury. The real modern problem is&mdash;what
  pilgrimage have we on which these two different men will ride together? I
  mean, of course, one on which they will ride together and remain different.
  There are many forces making for a superficial sameness in modern life; far
  too many. There is standardization and the stunts of journalism and the
  various forms of conscription and coercion rather peculiar to our time; such
  as Prohibition. But you do not re-consecrate the Cathedral by shutting up the
  Tabard; or make men want to go on a pilgrimage by forbidding them to go to a
  public-house. There are many modern forces, commercial or scientific, tending
  to make men look or talk the same. But the Clerk and the Miller did not look
  and talk the same. They had nothing in common but their purpose; but they had
  a purpose. It is very puzzling to look at the real society around us at this
  moment, and consider whether it has a purpose. For the present, at least,
  there is no Canterbury in sight for the Canterbury Pilgrims. The coloured
  cavalcade is halted somewhere in the suburbs, and suffering the bewilderment
  dating from that day, when sectarians and journalists and jerry-builders
  between them decided that every man should live in the same villa and every
  man in a different universe.</p>

  <p>Some of these conclusions are inevitably coloured with my own convictions;
  but I do not think that those most opposed to them will differ greatly about
  the contemporary facts. Few will deny that a certain kind of straightforward
  story, with a plot and a point, but adorned with vivid portraits of different
  persons, began to enter the world in Chaucer's time. Not many will deny that
  the development of that straightforward story is doubtful and perplexed in
  our own time. It is possible, of course, that somebody will make something
  out of it; something that is another story; something that is not a story.
  Something may be done with the subconsciousness of the Miller or the dual
  personality of the Wife of Bath. But I doubt whether it will be what we have
  known as a readable romance, if it cannot hold together the Wife of Bath as
  one person or the Canterbury Pilgrimage as one party. I am not alone in
  thinking that we are likely to see the break-up of the particular culture
  made by the Renaissance, at least as much as Chaucer was in a position to see
  the break-up of the particular culture of the Middle Ages. Nor am I alone, I
  fancy, in suspecting that this special creation called the modern Novel,
  which began with him, may end with us.</p>

  <p>At least, in this lighter and (dare I say) lesser matter of letters, may
  we who are burdened with conclusions, or even convictions, be suffered to
  entertain a suspicion? A suspicion that in the secret matter of happiness
  (not prosperity, or efficiency, or even equality, but happiness) men do not
  merely progress indefinitely, but rather pass a flashing moment of maturity;
  pass it, for instance, when they drink just too much good wine at the Tabard
  and fall under the table, or progress beyond Canterbury and fall into the
  sea. That there is an instant of radiant ripeness which the drunkard does not
  recover, and to which neither does the dead return; and that this crisis of
  perfection, in literature and the love of literature, comes when what is old
  and simple can still mingle with what is new and strange. When men can still
  listen to a story like children, but can already savour the humours of men
  like men; when men can still be surprised at the logical turn of fate that
  swings round and strikes down the victorious Arcite, but can already be
  ironically entertained by the torrent of self-expression from the Wife of
  Bath, who exults in sheer egotism for pages before she gets to any story at
  all; when they were still so unsophisticated as to be moved by the
  mountainous yet ever mounting crescendo of magnanimity in the generous
  rivalries of the Franklin's Tale; and yet have gained enough of culture to
  appreciate some verbal felicities in the telling, as in the Dantesque touch
  of the woman's wild prayer that all the high black rocks be sunken into hell;
  when a man could yet weep like the Host (that sentimentalist!) over the mere
  death of a simple maid, and yet roar down a bore or a bully with the joyful
  contempt of Rabelais; when they could find a melodious pleasure in the mere
  flow of a narrative and yet remain sufficiently wide-awake to react when it
  ended with the point of an anecdote; when the world was young enough to be
  capable of hero-worship and old enough to be capable of humour; and that this
  flame of the highest happiness flashed for a moment in the mirror of the
  genius of Chaucer; like the noonday sun upon a naked sword.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch6"

  Chaucer as an Englishman</h2>

  <p class="first">We have heard much of late of something called Emergent
  Evolution; a phrase which, like many scientific phrases, we may find rather
  useful so long as we do not use it scientifically. Evolution as explanation,
  as an ultimate philosophy of the cause of living things, is still faced with
  the problem of producing rabbits out of an empty hat; a process commonly
  involving some hint of Design. But evolution, and especially emergence, as a
  convenient and compact description of a sort of relative growth we can all
  see for ourselves, is very useful in many connexions, and especially in
  connexion with the problem of England in the later Middle Ages. The
  Englishman, as a national figure now fully nationalized, stands in the modern
  world for certain associations or impressions, true or false, but anyhow
  fairly familiar. We could hardly say simply that, in Chaucer's time, the
  Englishman was non-existent. We cannot exactly say that the Englishman was
  existent. We can say that the Englishman was emergent. But it is necessary to
  state more exactly the stage of his emergence, and the true proportions in
  which he was like and unlike ourselves.</p>

  <p>The nineteenth-century version of the Englishman would be entirely false
  in the fourteenth century. It may be urged in answer (by curious and restless
  minds) that the nineteenth-century version was entirely false in the
  nineteenth century. It is easy enough to point out contrasts and
  inconsistencies that might seem to make the whole ordinary English legend a
  lie. The normal Englishman was supposed to be a sturdy and stoical figure,
  who hated to show his feelings for fear of seeming flashy; or making anything
  so theatrical as 'a scene'. And his most popular novelist was Dickens and his
  most fashionable statesman was Disraeli. But though it is obvious that he was
  much more romantic than he thought he was, it is true that his romance about
  himself was the romance of being unromantic. That is, it was the romance of
  being practical; even the romance of being prosaic. There was a multitudinous
  English type made on that model, and they really were more national as well
  as more normal than the quacks or geniuses whom they admired. It is obvious
  that the 'unpatriotic' Cobden was a hundred times more of an Englishman than
  the patriotic Lord Beaconsfield; and perhaps the humdrum Trollope more
  representative than the dazzling Dickens. When all allowances are made, it is
  true that a type had appeared, by about the end of the eighteenth century,
  which was commonly regarded as the English type and is even now only
  partially transformed; a type compared with which most foreigners appeared
  volatile or violent or exuberantly vivacious. Its story had been one of two
  or three centuries. Its foundation, like every foundation, was religious: its
  first basis had been Puritanism; on this was erected all the ugly opulence of
  Industrialism; and then there had matured another influence, most modern but
  perhaps most fascinating and fashionable of all; what may be called the
  genteel stoicism of the Public Schools. The gentlemen who governed England,
  the gentlemen who were England, received their two great commandments. They
  must play the game and they must not play at it. Above all, they must not
  play at it playfully. A singular seriousness must be directed towards the
  sports that most other people think merely sportive; and they must be made
  the rites of a religion of patriotism. With this went all the kindred things:
  the pride in evading emotion; the contented confession of a certain ignorance
  of music or foreign refinements; the hazy identification of the vices of
  industrialism with the virtue of industry. This Englishman did exist; at any
  rate he did try to exist. And there is a sense in which the ideal is more
  important than the real. The real is only useful to realistic novelists. It
  is the ideal, or in a better language the god, who really leads the masses of
  men and turns the corners of history.</p>

  <p>When we have firmly and clearly modelled the image of what the whole
  modern world has meant by an Englishman, we must instantly and utterly
  destroy it. When we have once vividly understood what was really meant by the
  national ideal in the nineteenth century, we must utterly sweep it away from
  the whole field of the fourteenth century. Nothing whatever resembling that
  conscious ideal of common sense, or cold virility, existed for Chaucer and
  his contemporary countrymen. Indeed, so far as there was a general atmosphere
  and attitude, it was all the other way. If the Victorians could have actually
  had a vision of Chaucerian England, they would have thought the Englishman
  was a Frenchman. All the jokes against the Frenchman would be jokes against
  the fourteenth-century Englishman. All the emotions and expressions of
  emotions were there, especially those considered most un-English. If Jules
  and Jacques kissed each other, it would seem altogether absurd to Thackeray.
  If Palamon and Arcite kissed each other, it would not seem in the least
  absurd to Chaucer. That men should on occasion weep, and even weep in public,
  seemed no more unnatural to the writers of the older England than it did to
  the writers of the Old Testament or the Iliad. But the contrast is even
  plainer in the gesture of joy than the gesture of grief. The tag about Merry
  England is not unhistorical; for many historic witnesses did regard it as
  rather merrier than the neighbouring nations. The Victorian Englishman was
  rather prone to regard a damned fiddler as a damned foreigner. The medieval
  visitor to England described it as full of fiddling; as especially addicted
  to music and minstrelsy and dance and song. From the Victorian point of view,
  in so far as England did differ from France, it was in being rather more
  French than France. And indeed the Victorian, or the man who finds virtue
  only in the modern Public School ideal, must frankly face the fact that in
  the fourteenth century what he has called England did not exist. Not only was
  there another nation, but it was in a sense a Franco-English nation. It was
  partly because France and England were so nearly one nation, that the kings
  struggled so long to make them one kingdom. Anybody can see in history how
  near were the national types to each other then, and how far apart they are
  now. The Black Prince and Bertrand du Guesclin understood each other much
  better, as enemies, than French and Foch could understand each other as
  allies. Behind all was the great unity of Christendom, more than twelve
  hundred years old, which the later insular Englishman had never even heard
  of. Such was the condition when the first cracks appeared in that Continent.
  France and England did not unite; and the great English nation was founded,
  very largely by Joan of Arc.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Now it is when we have frankly and fully realized this that the fun
  begins. It is when we have cleared our minds of the last lingering notion
  that the proverbial practical Englishman existed then, as he exists now, that
  we can begin to consider what is meant by saying that he was not existent;
  but he was emergent. Geoffrey Chaucer no more regarded himself as John Bull
  than a prehistoric Red Indian regarded himself as a Regular Guy. He no more
  prided himself on being a plain blunt Englishman, with a Bible under one arm
  and a business ledger under the other, than a Cossack of the twelfth century
  prided himself on being a Communist of the twentieth. It was an utterly
  different world, the old world of Christendom which had once been the
  Christian Roman Empire; a world in which the local loyalties were still
  feudal; the larger loyalties still often imperial; and the ultimate loyalty
  entirely religious and long centred in Rome. Nine-tenths of the mind of a man
  like Chaucer were busy with things that have entirely vanished from the
  world, as seen by an English patriot to-day. The vast, if shadowy, suzerainty
  of the Emperor that had reared itself against the supremacy of the Pope; the
  assumption at the back of every Christian mind that the Crusades ought really
  to be continued, though they had already been practically abandoned; the
  serious juridical argument about the Plantagenet claim to the French throne;
  the vast and crowded ways of medieval travel, which followed so largely the
  great roads to the great shrines of the Continent. It can all be summed up by
  saying that Chaucer would have thought it quite as natural to go on a
  pilgrimage to Compostella as on a pilgrimage to Canterbury. It is also worth
  remarking that, if he had gone on a pilgrimage to Compostella, or to any
  Christian shrine in Hungary or Poland or the other end of Europe, he would
  very probably have seen a statue of St. Thomas of Canterbury looking down on
  him in a strange land.</p>

  <p>But the point is this; that while nine-tenths of his mind made him a
  citizen of the old empire of Christendom, there was another tenth of his
  mind; and it was beginning to tell. Canterbury would not suggest to him
  anything resembling what we mean now by a cathedral city or an Archbishop of
  Canterbury. It would be more likely to suggest the Pope who had avenged St.
  Thomas on the tyrant who had him slain. But he was beginning to feel, with a
  part of his mind, that Canterbury was Canterbury and not Compostella: that it
  had a Kentish and not a Spanish smell about it; that, while it was an
  international shrine, it was a point of pride to have an international shrine
  inside one's own nation; and that, while it was only one of the holy places,
  it was convenient and comfortable to have a holy place so near home. We may
  say, if we like, that his subconsciousness was more national than his
  consciousness; I suspect that it was as yet only a corner of his
  subconsciousness; but it was growing; it was evolving; it was emergent. And
  it is really a subtle and fascinating study, far more fascinating than
  anything offered by a cheap simplification, modernization or nationalization
  of the Chaucerian phase, to trace out the first faint beginnings of the
  separate national character that exists to-day; the real roots of the
  difference that afterwards, in its later exaggeration, divided England from
  Europe.</p>

  <p>There are several very curious, and even mysterious, things about Chaucer,
  which do already mark him out as a man somewhat different from the same sort
  of man in the France or Italy of his day. There are moments when we can truly
  say that the medieval Englishman is already beginning to be the modern
  Englishman. Something, often something oddly negative (as is often the case
  with the quaint qualities of the English), has begun to appear, in such a way
  that we can say now, though it is doubtful if we could have said then, 'This
  man is beginning to look devilish like an English Gentleman', or, 'If he does
  not look out, this will end in being a Good Sport'. Not that I would imply
  any lack of sympathy with these modern ideals, in moderation; I merely mean
  that, in this time of transition in which Chaucer lived, we sometimes
  suddenly see them looming far ahead; things not perhaps inevitable, but
  certainly unmistakable. These possibilities already existed; they need not
  eventually have been so much exaggerated; above all, they need not have been
  so much isolated. Anyhow, Chaucer could already boast of being distinguished
  from his fellow-Christians; though he could not yet boast of being divided
  from them.</p>

  <p>I will take first one very strange example; the position of the poet in
  relation to fame and fashion. He was not an unsuccessful man. For the greater
  part of his life he was a successful man and a poet; and yet we cannot say
  exactly that he was a successful poet. That is, he was not successful as a
  poet in the way in which some of his contemporaries were successful as poets:
  praised and applauded as poets; crowned and enthroned as poets. In this
  respect there is a curious parallel between the mystery of Chaucer and the
  mystery of Shakespeare. They were neither of them failures or outcasts; they
  both seem to have had a good deal of solid success, though Shakespeare was
  wealthiest in later life and Chaucer in middle life. But they were more
  successful than famous; and more famous than glorious. The odd obscurity of
  Shakespeare, in some aspects, which has been the negative opportunity of so
  many cranks and quacks, is a real fact so far as it goes; and it can best be
  measured if we compare it, for instance, with the flamboyant fame of Ronsard
  a few years before in France. Some say that Shakespeare's death was
  disreputable; it is a far more creepy and uncanny fact that his life was
  respectable. He lived and died, not like a first-rate failure, but like a
  fourth-rate success. He lived and died a proper provincial burgess, a few
  years after Ronsard had gathered round his gorgeous death-bed that great
  assembly of nobles and princes in the robes of religion, and proclaimed to
  all Europe as with a trumpet that no man born had known so much glory as he,
  and that he was weary of it and thirsty for the glory of God. The obscure
  death of Shakespeare is almost as startling a contrast, whether it was
  disreputable or respectable.</p>

  <p>Now Chaucer moves in almost exactly the same manner, on what may be called
  a lower level of moderate success. As we can compare the respectability of
  Shakespeare with the public glory of Ronsard, so we can compare the
  respectability of Chaucer with the towering splendour of Petrarch. Petrarch
  was not, I fancy, a much greater poet than Chaucer; certainly not so original
  a poet as Chaucer. Petrarch had a public triumph like the triumph of Julius
  Caesar; like the triumph of an Emperor who had conquered the world. He passed
  through the streets of Rome with an army of banners and trumpets, to where he
  was crowned with laurel, the eternal crown, upon the high rock of the
  Capitol, and went to Mass like a king in state, to leave his wreath on the
  altar of St. Peter's. And all this time we find the English poet, greater or
  at least as great, moving about busily, but entirely lost in the crowd; noticed by
  nobody in particular except the few people who sent him on his rather
  mysterious errands; apparently having a good deal to do, but always of the
  sort that rather involved his avoiding observation than obtaining fame. He
  seems to be all over the place; but he is always under the surface. Nobody
  says, 'I met old Chaucer in Westminster'; nobody writes, 'I had the honour to
  meet no less a person than Mr. Chaucer when I was in Italy'. He was in Italy
  when the radiant and resplendent Petrarch was there; certainly in the same
  country, probably in the same town. It is highly probable, though by no means
  certain, that they met. The question has been debated down to the last detail
  by men much more learned than I. But a much more important point, as I should
  consider it, is this: that in any case people would have said that Chaucer
  had managed to meet Petrarch; not that Petrarch had managed to meet
  Chaucer.</p>

  <p>Now we may easily note this, to begin with, with the somewhat melancholy
  moral, 'That is about as much as England will do for literature and literary
  men'. Probably it was true then, as it is certainly true now, that France and
  Italy would lend themselves more naturally to a great popular enthusiasm for
  a poet as such; to a great national and even political pageant in honour of
  pure Beauty. It is also true that they have preserved, perhaps by their more
  direct hold on pagan antiquity, more of the ancient idea of an
  <i>officium</i> or official status of the Bard or the Orator; a sort of
  sacred position like that of the Priest or the Sibyl. Compared with that, we
  may say that in England all authors are amateurs. Many of them were primarily
  what used to be called humorists; that is, many of them were characters and
  some of them pretty queer characters. Even as early as Chaucer's time, it
  would seem, there was something of this aversion to the public carnival for
  the crowning of a poor literary gent. But, unless I am mistaken, there was
  something else in it, much more deep and subtle. Mr. Geoffrey Chaucer, with
  his unobtrusive way of going off on Government business, his taste for being
  trustworthy and not conspicuous, his carrying of important dispatches and
  trying to look like anybody else, has something extraordinarily English about
  him. We almost feel that he has given 'his man' a holiday and quietly packed
  his suit-case at the club. Already, in the fourteenth century, there is
  faintly foreshadowed that indescribable tone of the English gentleman on such
  a job. He is the unofficial official. He has the official obscurity of
  numberless gentlemen in Government offices. He has even a touch of the strong
  silent hero, who goes on Secret Service in the novels of Sapper and Le Queux.
  All this, of course, is a wild exaggeration like the novels in question; for,
  as I have said, the thing had only just faintly begun to be a tendency and
  had not yet ended in a type. Still, we cannot dismiss a dim impression of
  that sort of gentlemanly understanding, of that sort of impersonal personal
  mission, when we compare the sort of success that was allowed to Chaucer with
  the sort of success that was allowed to Petrarch. We have, perhaps, a hint of
  the sort of man who really, in his heart, thinks it more important to share a
  secret with his country's rulers than to be acclaimed like a god by all the
  crowds of his countrymen. Anyhow, it seems to me that there is already a
  subtly national note in this odd use of a man of genius; and this
  concentration on public affairs as private affairs. Chaucer was not in the
  least like a modern Englishman; but he was the beginning of something of
  which the modern Englishman was the end. The point here is that it had
  already begun.</p>

  <p>Second, there is something symbolic in his social rank. There is even
  something symbolic in the doubts about his social rank. Something was already
  growing, and was especially developed in England, which was not quite
  explained by the logical system of ranks and guilds in the Middle Ages. For
  logic (or what reasonable people call reason) was almost the very soul of the
  Middle Ages. Yet something more indeterminate is already detaching itself;
  and in England it has become most detached. It is symbolized, as I say, in
  the very fact that one aspect or tradition of Chaucer shows him as the child
  of a common vintner selling barrels of wine to ruffians like the Shipman;
  while another shows him not so much a courtier as almost a cousin of some
  great prince like John of Gaunt. Something individualistic in English
  development made this really true of individuals, though not of classes. It
  must not be confused with that lifting of men from the lowest to the highest
  estate, which was a common action of medieval monarchy, as of all genuine
  monarchy. King Henry could raise the butcher's son as King Cophetua could
  raise the beggar-maid; that true personal authority often had a touch that
  seemed like magic. The thing I mean concerned the way in which the upper
  middle class abutted upon the upper class; and how particular people could
  cross the line in a particular way, especially in this particular country.
  Nor must it be confused with that opportunity often offered to the poorest to
  rise by the ladder of learning, and the assistance of the Church, which was
  the peculiar glory of the Middle Ages. This matter I mention now is more of a
  social accident; it would always be rather a chance for the richest than for
  the poorest; but they probably had more of a chance here than elsewhere. One
  way of putting it would be to say that the system of nobility was no longer
  mere nepotism; but it was still mere favouritism. Another way of putting it
  would be to say that the vintner's son, in the words of the comic opera, was
  appointed by a job; and a good job too.</p>

  <p>Our England has been an aristocracy which denied that it was aristocratic.
  In this queer inverted pride there has often been hypocrisy, but often only
  inconsistency; the desire to combine limited privileges with liberal
  sentiments. Anyhow, its story for the last century or two has been that of a
  governing class which pretended not to govern. Now nothing of that last phase
  was possible to the philosophy of the Middle Ages. Princes they knew and
  citizens they knew, and the authority of superiors and the equality of
  brethren; but accepting social superiority as an atmosphere, while not
  asserting it as an institution, would have seemed to them mere nonsense. A
  medieval man would have thought it simply a mad paradox for anybody to give a
  man a coronet and a coat of arms to make him admirable, and then call people
  snobs for admiring him. When they crowned a man king, they made him king; and
  would have thought it silly to crown him, if he were only what we now call a
  constitutional king. Sometimes they preferred a republic; occasionally it
  degenerated into an aristocratic republic. But they did not explain that
  aristocracy is more democratic than democracy. All this singular way of
  talking is entirely modern, and we must not look for anything like that in
  the social position of Chaucer. Nevertheless, there is already something
  distinctively English in the social position. There is something private and
  occasional in his way of slipping into the social class above his own. We can
  almost hear the County, or the Club, saying that after all he is a damned
  good fellow; not without the implication of a damned useful fellow. But the
  point of the admission was, as it continued to be at least until very lately,
  that the exception was exceptional. It was exceptional even if it became
  pretty frequent or general. It was exceptional because it was personal. The
  word went forth that the vintner should be accepted; not that the vintners
  should be. So, until lately, the whole object of English aristocratic
  diplomacy was to admit the greengrocer without admitting the greengrocers; to
  admit the pork-butcher without admitting the pork-butchers; and especially of
  late, to admit the pawnbroker and the moneylender on the same principles and
  in even larger numbers. With the last phase of all (which has begun to happen
  in our time), in which the gentleman no longer patronizes the pawnbroker,
  because the pawnbroker patronizes the gentleman, we are not here
  concerned.</p>

  <p>Thus, though the social status of the poet was only a sort of far-off
  signal, that might hint to historians that a long historical process had
  begun, there is something satisfactory and almost soothing in its embodiment
  in so great and so magnanimous a man. For it is not fair to forget the good
  side of this curious opportunist aristocracy adopted by the English. It has
  certainly proved the only human and workable way of preserving aristocracy,
  which has really not been preserved at all, as a method of government, by
  anybody except the English. Everywhere where aristocracy was logical, that
  is, where nobility and heredity and heraldry went together in a consistent
  scheme, that nobility has ceased to govern the nation. It has always been
  elbowed aside either by democracy or by despotism. The working of the English
  method does really require a certain kind of geniality and good humour; a
  certain spirit which, if we wish to see it at its very best, we could hardly
  find more vividly embodied than in the personal character of Chaucer.</p>

  <p>I do not think it fanciful to find in Chaucer's work, not only the first
  faint outline of the English Gentleman, but also the first faint outline of
  the English Lady. There is no doubt that the Prioress in <i>The Canterbury
  Tales</i> is a Lady; but she seems to me to be an exceedingly English Lady.
  The considerable social importance of her little dogs would alone strike the
  special note. She was a spinster with exactly the right amount of sentiment;
  as exhibited in the motto on her brooch or clasp. She was particular about
  manners at table. She did not like to see a mouse caught in a trap. And
  indeed we may once more indulge our fancy, in finding one of these ancestral
  adumbrations; the suggestion of the whole temperamental tendency expressed in
  the special kind of kindness to animals so much valued by the English gentry
  to-day. It is a special kind; and some critics might even find it a
  paradoxical kind. The Prioress was more logical than many a modern lady,
  whose favourite cat (if he is anything of a logician) must be profoundly
  puzzled at being allowed to kill mice but not to kill birds. The same critic
  (if he were in a mood to be merely critical) might possibly describe the
  gentry of England as a nation of fox-hunters perpetually boasting that they
  are not bullfighters. But the critic would be too critical, if he implied
  that the inconsistency was an insincerity. There really is a particular kind
  of affection for animals, which is very marked among the modern English; and
  in some indefinable but very vivid fashion, it does rise up before us in the
  presence of this medieval English lady. Somehow, she does waft across the
  ages a delicately mingled atmosphere of refinement and fuss. It is indeed an
  error to suppose that our ancestors were merely barbarous and benighted to a
  man, about difficult questions like our relation to the lower animals; or
  that the notion of avoiding cruelty is merely new or modern. It is not even
  true, as some more sympathetic people imagine, that tenderness to wild
  animals was the isolated individual discovery of the great St. Francis of
  Assisi; original as he was in many ways. There are any number of old medieval
  stories about hermits and holy men who protected animals from the hunters,
  for instance; and might not have been so popular after all with the North
  Blankshire Hunt. It was a characteristic of St. Anselm a century before St.
  Francis. The truer way of stating the case is that men have always been
  pretty patchy and inconsistent in their attitude to animals, and that we
  ourselves are pretty patchy and inconsistent still. In every age there are a
  few who are very careful and many who are very careless, and a modern lady
  with a devotion to mice might find herself almost as much in a minority at a
  modern tea-table as did the Prioress at the Tabard.</p>

  <p>I only mention the matter here, however, as another example of that almost
  creepy unconscious fashion, in which we can feel the mind of Chaucer
  beginning to work towards the things that afterwards went to make up the
  peculiar modern mood of the English nation. As I have suggested that there
  was something, so to speak, of pre-natal nationality about Chaucer's way of
  going about his business, I may add that there is an even more unmistakable
  social savour about Chaucer on a holiday. In all his remarks about his
  companions, as well as in his few remarks about himself, there is all that
  particular sort of self-effacing sociability which has really, when all cant
  is disposed of, made the English gentleman the best companion in the world.
  It has been complicated by all sorts of inconsistencies, and by many that
  have arisen since Chaucer's time. It has been often narrowed by aristocracy
  and sometimes soured by Puritanism, but it is there still; and in the
  Catholic Canterbury pilgrimage it is there already. It is marked off from the
  same kind of courtesy among Frenchmen or Italians by two unmistakable marks,
  which still exist; a certain casualness and flippancy, especially to fill up
  silences, and a certain half-conscious policy of avoiding deep disagreement
  on matters that really matter. Chaucer is all for letting sleeping dogs lie,
  including the greyhounds of the Prioress. He is not fond of fuss. He rather
  evades the questions asked of him, and does not mind looking more of a fool
  than he is. It is when I consider the man at this particular moment, in this
  particular aspect, in the hour of holiday when he was most himself, that a
  vague notion occurs to me that may be the explanation of the difficult
  problem of his politics.</p>

  <p>Chaucer lived in a time that was the turning-point of English history;
  more truly the turning-point, I think, than even the time of Shakespeare.
  Being, like Chaucer, made free of a free religion, I do not admit that men or
  societies are bound to any inevitable doom. So I will not say that after what
  happened in the England of Chaucer, nobody could have avoided what happened
  in the England of Shakespeare. But I will say that in the time of Chaucer a
  turn was taken and a road was partly travelled, which it would have been
  necessary to retrace in order to avoid the destruction or transformation that
  lay ahead. What happened in Chaucer's time was that the Nobles broke the
  King, and could actually set up a new man to call himself King, though he was
  no more than a Noble. These things always happen by stages; and this could
  not have happened so early, except that the Noble was the nearest to the
  royal blood. But he was almost admittedly a usurper, and his success stood
  for the breakdown of many medieval principles that nobody before had ventured
  to break. What Chaucer himself thought of the political position we have no
  certain means of knowing. The catastrophe occurred late in his life, when he
  was probably willing enough to receive occasional help from the Court he had
  known in his youth, without interfering further in its quarrels. It has
  sometimes struck me as rather curious and interesting that when he addressed
  to the new King his humorous ballade about the emptiness of his purse, he
  accompanied that very broad hint with an Envoi which might have more meanings
  than one. It begins, 'O conqueror of Brutus' Albion' and, though he hastened
  to add more formal salutations, this might possibly be read as a reference to
  the violent and untraditional origin of the reign. Something of the same
  oddity has always struck me in Andrew Marvell's admirable Horatian Ode on
  Cromwell, which is supposed to be a compliment to Cromwell, but sounds to me
  like a prolonged sneer at him. The long parenthesis on the dignified and
  courageous death of Charles the First can hardly have been very cosy reading
  for Cromwell. And the last lines, about 'the same arts that did gain a power
  must it maintain', sound to me uncommonly like saying, 'You've got everything
  by brute force, and you'll jolly well have to hang on to it'. However this
  may be, I do not pretend that there is even this amount of criticism
  necessarily implied in Chaucer's action, when he addresses Henry of
  Bolingbroke as a Conqueror rather than a King. Still, it is one of those
  half-shades that seem faintly suggestive where all is shadowy; and I think it
  likely enough that Chaucer's mind was somewhat divided on the matter. On the
  one hand, he had been of the party and group of poets whose patron was John
  of Gaunt, the father of the usurper; on the other hand there is nothing to
  prove that John of Gaunt himself, let alone all his poets and protégés, would
  have approved entirely of the usurpation. Then, again, the tone of Chaucer's
  previous poem, addressed to the dethroned King before his dethronement, lends
  some support to the idea that he thought that prince was reckless or almost
  riding for a fall. He continually repeats, in no very courtly tone, that what
  the realm needs everywhere is Steadfastness; with the possible inference that
  its ruler was not sufficiently steadfast. This was certainly a charge made
  against Richard the Second, both in his own time and in ours, but here again
  the inference is very insufficient. To take another parallel from the age of
  Marvell; there were many Cavaliers who continually reproached Charles the
  First with his errors in the earlier stages, but who supported him at the
  last and to the last, from Wentworth who died for him on the scaffold to
  Falkland who died for him on the battlefield. I think, therefore, that there
  is very little that can be inferred from the fragmentary evidences of
  Chaucer's political attitude. He had been a diplomatist, but not a
  politician, and the common desire of almost every intelligent diplomatist is
  to keep as far as possible out of politics. He had been ready to represent
  the country and the court among foreigners, but it does not follow that he
  had any particular partisan interest in the quarrels of native factions among
  themselves. With the question of whether there was any political significance
  in his disappearance from office, and interlude of obscurity, I deal
  elsewhere.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In any case, all such speculations are conditioned by the great historical
  limitation called human life; the fact, too often forgotten, that such a man
  never saw the sequel that we see. Shakespeare, who on the whole upholds the
  legend of a lack of steadfastness in Richard the Second, could see far too
  much of what followed to think that steadfastness was secured by the
  accession of Henry the Fourth. Though Shakespeare seems on the whole
  Lancastrian in his sympathies, he was much more conscious of the inevitable
  perils of pitting Lancaster against York. He looked back at his princely but
  pathetic Richard, the last pure Plantagenet, across a valley of dry bones, of
  death and futile destruction; of which Chaucer could never have had a hint.
  There was no way in which the old court poet, brought up in the splendid
  court of the victorious Edward, could guess the ghastly evisceration of
  England by feudal rebels up to the exhausted peace of Bosworth. Chaucer was
  brought up in a time when the Lilies could be triumphantly quartered with the
  Leopards, as if France and England had become one country. He never knew that
  the time was coming when England would become two countries, or perhaps three
  or four countries, and her shield be quartered in a very different sense. Yet
  that disruption of England in the Wars of the Roses was of some curious
  concern to Chaucer, as a poet as well as a patriot. For I cannot but suppose
  that the desolation of that dynastic war was the explanation of something
  that needs not a little explaining; the comparative barrenness of the
  Chaucerian tradition in literature after his death. He had, if ever man did
  in the world, started a new impulse; yet it seemed to have stopped almost as
  soon as it started. It would be an exaggeration to say that we had no
  medieval poets before Chaucer and precious few after him. But there was
  nothing like the poetic progeny or dynasty we had every right to expect,
  until long afterwards when the Renaissance came to England. And I suspect it
  was due to the conqueror of Brutus' Albion, who did more by his example to
  encourage potential conquerors than to encourage potential poets. If Chaucer
  did expect steadfastness from the Lancastrian usurpation, he suffered a
  post-mortem punishment for his mistake.</p>

  <p>Thus the readiness of Chaucer to support the party of the son of John of
  Gaunt, though regarded by good historians as probable, is certainly not
  proved. But I confess that I come to regard it as more probable, when I
  contemplate, as I am doing here, his curiously casual English attitude as
  expressed in the comedy of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>. With so much about
  him of what has made the English glorious or generous or genial, there was
  something also of what has made them gullible and indifferent and too much
  controlled by events. Chaucer was not a snob, but he was something of what
  they call in America a regular guy or in England a clubable fellow or a man's
  man. I could easily believe that he was never so much in revolt against the
  success of Bolingbroke as Shakespeare was against the success of Burleigh;
  for Shakespeare was a tragic poet with a touch in him of the revolt of Timon.
  It is a possible fancy, where all is fanciful, that the greatest Englishman
  of that age did not rebel against the tragic turn of the age, because he was
  too English to be a rebel. He may even have been duped by that dull cynicism
  that talks about the need of practical politics, and then gives itself up to
  be plundered by practical politicians. He may have been so far infected by
  such opportunism as to accept Henry of Bolingbroke as a practical politician.
  He would not be the less English for having joined in the biggest blunder of
  English history. But I repeat that there is no proof of the fact; it is
  little more than a possibility, and it is a possibility that only interests
  me here because it goes along with all the other hints that there was already
  something in the medieval Englishman pointing towards the particular
  idiosyncrasies of the modern Englishman. It had nothing to do with the higher
  part of his mind and work, which was concerned with that everlasting light in
  which all things stand bright and solid; but on the lower level it is likely
  enough that he may have let things slide like sand. He may have let sleeping
  dogs lie; little knowing, like many another opportunist, that what he really
  did was to let slip the dogs of war.</p>

  <p>There is one comment which may well be added at this point. It is agreed
  that in the modern sense of novelty, the production of new nostrums and
  notions, to be worked into systems like Socialism or Christian Science,
  Chaucer was not a man who troubled about ideas being new. It was quite enough
  for him, strange to say, that they were true. He was in many ways really
  conservative and even his talents did not lie in the direction of new
  definitions or demands. A critic might put it in the form of saying that
  Chaucer was a true son of the feudal system, in that he was even proud of
  being a dependent. He was, as we have seen, proud of being a dependent of the
  poet Ovid, a dependent of the philosopher Aristotle, a dependent of the
  theologian Aquinas. All this is true, and it is a truth that disposes at a
  blow of all the dreary attempts that have lately been made to represent
  medieval society as utterly servile or brutal or bigoted. Every man who has
  ever opened a book of Chaucer, every man who has ever opened the doors of
  Chaucer's mind and world, knows all that to be nonsense, even when it is
  nonsense supported by detailed or laborious learning. Chaucer was a great
  poet; he was a great man; but he was not a great revolutionist, not even in
  that sense a great reformer; certainly not a great iconoclast or heretic. He
  was not a man to hurl Bolshevist opinions like bombs into the crowd of
  conventional people with whom he lived so courteously and contentedly; he did
  not have them to throw, and he would not have thought them worth throwing;
  certainly not worth the explosion. If anybody thinks this sort of 'taking the
  world as he found it' a proof of littleness, such a person cannot be expected
  to accept my view of Chaucer's largeness. But the critic, in withdrawing the
  compliment from Chaucer, must withdraw the slander from the Middle Ages. It
  is quite certain that the reader of Chaucer instantly breathes an atmosphere
  of breezy and cordial brotherhood, of charity towards all sorts of men, of a
  sense of the worthlessness of rank and wealth in comparison with worth, of a
  sense of fundamental freedom and fraternity in the commonwealth of Christian
  men. These notions must have been normal medieval notions, or a man like
  Chaucer would never have had them, or bothered about them. He was not the
  sort to go digging for abnormal notions. There is that amount of truth in
  calling him a conservative or even a courtier. They must have been ideas that
  a man could casually express; or Chaucer would not have remained a court
  favourite all his life, when he was always expressing them so casually. If
  that is what is meant by denying originality to Chaucer, the charge is true.
  There was nothing of the New Morality about him; there was nothing of the man
  who wears no clothes in Hampstead or cannot keep cats because they are
  carnivorous. It was not so that he held the view that men of rank should be
  rebuked or that gentility was not mere ancestry. If these liberal sentiments
  had been fads in that sense, to the medieval mind, nobody with a notion of
  personal character can think that Geoffrey Chaucer would have joined the
  faddists. Some may hold, but I do not hold, that a man cannot be really
  original who has this huge appetite for what is normal. Anyhow, Chaucer had
  it, and he was so native to his age and country that his attitude must have
  seemed tolerably normal to them.</p>

  <p>So far we have seen in faint outline a figure very familiar to us in
  modern literature and to some extent in modern life. He minds his own
  business; he does not talk shop; he is even content to remain under the
  mystical cloud of being Something in the City; he does not make scenes, and
  has a particular kind of limited politeness to servants; he is rather silent
  and yet somehow sociable, in the sense of being able to get on with other
  fellows at the club or (it is right to add) in the camp; he is manly; he is
  modest, at least in external manners; he is well-bred; he is well-groomed; he
  is solid and reasonable and reliable; but he has his good points, for all
  that. And the greatest of these is something that neither Puritanism nor the
  Public School has contrived to kill; he is generally fond of a joke. His
  great national contribution to the culture of Christendom has been that
  quality. It is the English sense of humour, like the Spanish sense of honour
  or the French sense of right reason. It is true that a certain sort of
  pompous ass like Sir Willoughly Patterne or Mr. Dombey has been exhibited as
  an Englishman; but he has generally been exhibited by Englishmen. Podsnap
  would not have been so absurdly English, if Dickens had not been an
  Englishman. True, there is only one Dickens, but there are a million
  Dickensians; a great many more Dickensians than there are Podsnaps. On the
  whole, the prevailing spirit of the English is an appreciation of this sort
  of fun, especially when it broadens into farce. Indeed, when it is properly
  understood, there is something in it that breaks out beyond the limits of
  mere farce, and becomes a sort of poetry of pantomime; a climax of
  anti-climax. Dickens is full of wild images that would be nothing if they
  were not funny. They would be not merely nonsensical but non-existent, if
  they were not (I say it with some firmness) so damned funny. Mrs. Todgers's
  wooden leg; Mr. Swiveller's gazelle who married a market-gardener; the
  toothpick of the gentleman next door, which if sent to the Commander-in-Chief
  would produce such marked results; the effect of Henry the Eighth's little
  peepy eyes on Mrs. Skewton's view of history; these are things that would
  simply cease to exist in a really rational universe. They are not symbolic;
  they are not really satiric. They are upheld by an invisible power and lifted
  without support upon the wings of laughter; by a power more unanswerable and
  more irresponsible than pure beauty.</p>

  <p>Now compared with the fun of Dickens, there is certainly something
  altogether shrewd, sensible and solid about the humour of Chaucer. He was, as
  has been said already, only the seed of that separate growth; but it was
  growing separate and it was soon to be growing wild. We shall note elsewhere
  the way in which the medieval common sense of Chaucer differs from the almost
  maniac laughter we sometimes hear from the Elizabethans, even from
  Shakespeare. But for all that a frontier had been crossed, and there is
  already in Chaucer an element of irrational humour, which is not the same as
  the old rational humour. The old humour had been a form of satire. Chaucer
  often sounds satirical; yet Chaucer was not strictly a satirist. Perhaps the
  shortest way of putting it is to say that he already inhabits a world of
  comicality that is not a world of controversy. He makes fun of people, in the
  exact sense of getting fun out of them for himself. He does not make game of
  them, in the actual sense of hunting them down and killing them like wild
  vermin or public pests. He does not want the Friar and the Wife of Bath to
  perish; one would sometimes suspect that he does not really want them to
  change. Anyhow, a softening element of this sort has got into his satire,
  even if he really meant it for satire. But, with this step, he is already on
  the road to the Dickensian lunatic-asylum of laughter; because he is valuing
  his fools and knaves and almost wishing (as it were) to preserve them in
  spirits&mdash;in high spirits. In a hundred other ways his humour is English, and
  not least in this, that he often uses flippancy to avoid an argument and not
  to provoke it.</p>

  <p>For I have so far confined myself strictly to considering what
  (unfortunately) a great mass of modern Englishmen mean by an Englishman. I
  have taken the matter from this end, so to speak, and started with the
  strictly national type produced by Protestantism and the modern division of
  nations. And I have pointed out that, even in terms of this familiar type,
  Chaucer is readily recognizable as English: that he contains the seeds of
  some of the things that have since become even extravagantly English. But I
  apologize to England for talking as if these things alone were English; and
  to Chaucer for supposing that he did not know and love an England that was
  relatively free from all these things. There is matter much larger than these
  little social tricks in the real heritage of the English; and Chaucer was the
  true trustee of that heritage; above all of the great national heritage of
  humour. It is the custom to boast that it is more than wit, but the really
  interesting truth is that it is more even than humour. It is not merely a
  critical quality; in a sense it is even a creative quality; a sort of crooked
  creation that is called the fantastic or the topsy-turvy. Here again it is
  possible to quote things from Chaucer that seem to have come into the world
  centuries too early, and to be of the type of the nursery nonsense of to-day.
  That this wild spirit runs through all English literature can be proved by a
  single quotation from Lear. I do not mean the comic Lear but the tragic Lear;
  who was almost equally nonsensical. There was never a crazy touch in that
  crack-brained style done better than that of Shakespeare's fool, when he
  says:</p>

  <p class="verse">'This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his
  time.'</p>

  <p>This poetry also Mr. Lewis Carroll shall make; but Chaucer lives before
  his time. Even in the Father of English Poetry that far-off cry of pure folly
  can be heard, perhaps for the first time in human history.</p>

  <p>There is in English humour something that can not only be compared to art
  for art's sake, but might more truly be described as adventure for
  adventure's sake. It is not unconnected with the sense in which the more
  honourable part of English conquest and colonization was adventure for
  adventure's sake. I mean that it was not really directed towards a consistent
  policy of rule. Grave historians have expressed a mild astonishment that the
  British were so long unconscious of the British Empire. It is a possible
  explanation, to suppose that they were unconscious of it because it did not
  exist. It was not an empire in the logical sense of an <i>imperium</i>; a
  scheme for extending a type of civilization over countries that had not got
  it; as other empires wished to extend the Roman Law or the Spanish religion.
  It had first the practical purpose of trade; but after that its purpose might
  more truly be described as fun; the satisfaction of seeing strange
  places&mdash;and leaving them strange. If we like to put it so, the adventurer had
  something nobler than greed; which was curiosity. Now that curiosity always
  delighted in curiosities. They were like the curios that sailors brought home
  from strange seas; parrots and monkeys and tropical shells. But there was
  even more interest in the curiosities the sailor could not exactly bring home
  to his landlady; such as Cannibal Kings or Chinese temples or Arctic whales.
  There runs through the English adventure the vague desire that these funny
  things should <i>remain</i> funny. He does not specially wish to convert the
  yellow men in the temple; though he might attempt a constitutional compromise
  about cannibalism. And there runs through the English humour the same notion
  of amusing monsters, to be stared at. And Chaucer is at the spring of this
  spirit; because to him the Wife of Bath is an amusing monster. We do not
  approve of her; but we do not feel responsible for her, any more than for a
  whale or a white elephant. There is a wise fool whose eyes are in the ends of
  the earth; and the English invented that phrase of yet more imaginative
  folly: 'The other end of nowhere.'</p>

  <p>It is a very extraordinary fact, when considered historically, that
  Chaucer should have been so unmistakably English almost before the existence
  of England. It is the details of language, like the details of landscape,
  that give this entirely unique and unmistakable touch. It is an elvish touch,
  to use a term that was actually used about the poet. It almost suggests that
  the other name of England is Elfland. Yet it has nothing whatever of the thin
  ethereal spirit of faerie; as we see it, for instance, in the Celtic myths
  and the poems of Mr. W. B. Yeats. It is a solid and almost smug sort of
  goblin market; a real town where the goblins are really marketing. The
  nearest we can come to a more serious definition is that it is a certain
  spirit of nonsense even in landscape. We find it in the names of some real
  English villages, which might have come out of the wild geography books of
  Mr. Edward Lear. We feel it in some of the impossible places invented by Mr.
  Edward Lear, which might be the names of real English villages, valleys or
  downs; such as that typical title, 'The Hills of the Chankly Bore'.</p>

  <p>Now this touch is instantly felt in Chaucer. The Pilgrims' Way does not
  run merely, in the medieval manner, through meadows patterned with flowers or
  forests dark with enchantment. But neither does it run merely through
  reasonable and recognizable places like Southwark and Sittingbourne. There is
  something selective in the eye of Chaucer, which is already open for other
  and special things. Nobody at home with the nonsense element I mean can read
  that phrase, in the account of the pilgrimage, about passing a town 'which
  that i-clepd is Bob-Up-and-Down', without his heart leaping with joy, and
  bobbing up and down with that buoyant and unconquerable city. I do not know
  exactly what it means; and there have been all sorts of speculations about
  it. I do not know whether Chaucer made it up out of his own head, which is
  quite possible; or whether it was a real English village, which is also quite
  possible; or whether it was a nickname connected with some local jest, which
  is perhaps most probable. Some have suggested that it was so called because
  something in the winding, rising and falling road made it appear to be on
  different levels at different stages; and that sort of rambling road probably
  was then, and certainly is now, rather specially characteristic of the
  English countryside. But the feeling of the curious primeval kinship between
  England and Chaucer is justified in either case. I do not care whether it was
  something that England invented and Chaucer glorified; or whether it was
  something that Chaucer invented and England glorified. The spirit of a man
  who loves that landscape can sometimes run so close to the land, that it
  invents something that exists already. I remember composing, when I was quite
  young, the first rough form of a song about the round hills and rolling,
  almost revolving roads, of which a man dreams after a day in Sussex. In that
  song I invented an entirely imaginary town of Roundabout as the mystic centre
  of this rotatory landscape. And it was some time afterwards that I discovered
  that there really is a town in Sussex called Roundabout, because the men of
  Sussex had seen the same scenes and dreamed the same dream.</p>

  <p>Therefore there is, it seems, something primitive about this poet, because
  he is as large as the land and as old as the nation. There was little enough
  in him of the mystic, in the narrow or special sense; yet it is impossible
  not to feel something mystical about his magnitude as an emblem of England.
  He had somehow got into his head and into his note-book a certain national
  quality, centuries before the nation attempted to understand or describe its
  own quality. He had, for instance, the humour that is at once broadened and
  blunted by good humour. He had the particular <i>sort</i> of soft-heartedness
  that can be seen in the English; sometimes an incomplete and illogical sort;
  but not far removed from that of Chaucer's Prioress, who might have been
  frightened of a mouse, but wept over its being in a trap. He had the English
  type of tolerance and in some things the English type of irresponsible
  individualism; there is that amount of truth in Matthew Arnold's view that he
  was lacking in 'seriousness'. He was not the stuff of which Reformers are
  made. He took things as they came, and the world as he found it, and men as
  God had made them, or even as they had made themselves. He had a curious sort
  of abstract liberality underlying concrete conservatism, which was very
  national, and can be seen in many Tories who are devoted to a Monarchy and
  explain that it is just as republican as a Republic. In all this he is the
  First of The English; and his figure has therefore this quality of a type and
  even an archetype. That figure is seen in the sunlight of history walking
  among the gay pavilions and palaces of French kings and French-speaking
  knights and nobles; negotiating war and peace in what was practically a
  French quarrel about a French pedigree; he is seen learning a thousand things
  from the sonneteers of Italy and the troubadours of Provence; but within him
  something is born, and it is the name by which we live. He may or may not
  have made the somewhat dreary attempt to translate <i>Le Roman de la Rose</i>
  into English. But nobody could possibly translate <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>
  into French.</p>

  <p>There is something personal about England. Rome or France or Bolshevist
  Russia or Republican America, each in its own way, is a principle; but
  England is a person. And it is very like the very indescribable sort of
  person this book has to describe. I will not be so daring as to define what
  William Blake meant by The Giant Albion; but we may agree that if the country
  called by poets Albion could be conceived as a single figure, it would be a
  giant. And when I think of Chaucer in this primary and general fashion, I do
  not think of a Court poet receiving a laurel from the King or a flagon from
  the King's butler, nor even of a stout and genial gentleman with a forked
  beard setting forth from the Tabard upon the Canterbury road; but of some
  such elemental and emblematic giant, alive at our beginnings and made out of
  the very elements of the land. Perhaps if we were caught up by that eagle
  that whirled away the poet to the gates of The House of Fame, we might begin
  to see spread out beneath us the titanic outlines of such a prehistoric or
  primordial Anak or Adam, with our native hills for his bones and our native
  forests for his beard; and see for an instant a single figure outlined
  against the sea and a great face staring at the sky.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7"></a><small>CHAPTER VII</small><br>
  Chaucer and the Renaissance</h2>

  <p class="first">It will be noted that many quotations from Chaucer in these
  pages are recast in a manner that may well distress Chaucerians; though it is
  done with the hope of increasing the number of Chaucerians in the world. I
  can only say that I am acutely sensitive to all that can be said against what
  I am doing. To say that I have modernized Chaucer has a very ugly sound, and
  might stand for a very ugly thing. The first difficulty about disturbing any
  ancient language, that is good of its kind, is that the man who turns it into
  new language may turn it into pretty thoroughly bad language; in the sense of
  something worse than slang. There is also this paradoxical but practical
  fact: that the very examples in which the meaning of a word has changed are
  the examples in which we know what it means. If we substitute a very modern
  word, we may find that everybody uses it and nobody knows what it means. It
  marked the use of an old phrase, of which the meaning has changed, when the
  Prayer-Book said, 'Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings'. But nobody does
  imagine that the vicar, who reads it out in the parish church, means that he
  wants to be tripped up with booby-traps and butter-slides in everything he
  attempts. The dead word, like the dead language, does in a sense remain
  sacred. 'Prevent' is a Latin word and still makes sense in Latin. But there
  is always the peril that turning it into modern English might mean turning it
  into more modern American; and ghastly possibilities open before us, of some
  future reformer altering 'prevent us' to 'put us wise'. Or, to take another
  example, it is now extremely archaic English to talk about the Holy Ghost.
  But it is perfectly intelligible English, although it is archaic English.
  Indeed it is intelligible English because it is archaic English. It stands
  for a certain idea which was strong when the language was made, and it stands
  exactly where it did. Whereas, even so reasonable a change as that of 'ghost'
  to 'spirit', may bring in a nuance of change, owing to modern uses of the
  word 'spiritual' and the looming spectre of Spiritualism. Similarly, it is
  archaic to talk about ghostly counsel or ghostly consolation. But nobody does
  in fact imagine that ghostly consolation means consoling people by telling
  them ghost-stories. Whereas, if we begin to think of what does give spiritual
  consolation, or appear to give it, to a great many modern people, the most
  horrid possibilities begin to close in upon us. We may end by altering old
  English to something that is not English at all; and talking about an Uplift
  or (heaven defend us) about an Urge.</p>

  <p>Therefore, while I believe in occasionally changing the Chaucerian speech
  or spelling, I believe in changing it as little as possible, and indeed only
  where the original is utterly unintelligible to an ordinary modern reader; or
  where (what is far worse) the accidental look of ugly unintelligible words
  makes a passage appear undignified, which in fact is full of dignity. Several
  excellent attempts have been made to modernize Chaucer; nor is the idea
  itself confined to the times we call modern. It strongly possessed the great
  critical imagination of Dryden; a poet whose greatness, humanity and English
  breadth were in many ways very Chaucerian, but who was persistently
  underrated in the nineteenth century, merely because he had voted Blue
  instead of Buff in the party quarrels of the seventeenth century. It would be
  truer, of course, to admit that the prejudice had real roots; and that
  Dryden's crime was his lack of enthusiasm for the establishment of plutocracy
  and his Catholic dislike of the Puritans. Anyhow, he had every right to recur
  to the great English tradition of the medieval poet; and he did admirable
  work in paraphrasing and popularizing whole sections of the Canterbury Tales.
  His version shows very clearly the particular limitations of his age, and we
  may be absolutely certain that all our versions will show posterity the very
  obvious limitations of ours. But it is on the whole much better than many
  experiments of the sort in our own time. A modernized version of four of the
  Canterbury Tales has recently come from America. It is ingenious and
  intelligent; but it shows very clearly the danger of needless modernization
  of what is merely medieval, without being, for any reader, in the least
  meaningless. What is wanted is not the reconstruction of every line of
  Chaucer so as to make it fit metrically and grammatically into a modern line.
  What is wanted is a careful preservation of the old construction of every
  line, except where it is quite impossible to keep the construction and yet
  put the right construction on it.</p>

  <p>For there is another objection, far deeper than the first I mentioned. It
  is really true to say that the best guide for doing this job is to remember
  that it is impossible to do it. After all, by trying to do it at all, we are
  treating medieval English as a foreign language. And there never was, is not,
  and never will be, a translation of a poem from a foreign language. There
  have been some beautiful poems written in one language, more or less parallel
  to beautiful poems in the other. There have been reasonable translations into
  the one language, which were good enough to goad people into really learning
  the other language. There have even been great poems, which professed to be
  only translations of small poems. But no man has ever reproduced the
  atmosphere and magic of one single word by the use of another word. Nobody
  could put the exact equivalent of 'revisit thus the glimpses of the moon'
  into any other English words; and he certainly could not put it into German
  or Russian or Chinese words. It is this separation that makes necessary such
  intermediate explanations as these; it may be that the Tower of Babel was
  indeed the chief tragedy of mankind. But anyhow, it is strictly true that we
  can translate anything in reason. We cannot translate anything that is beyond
  reason; like the way in which mere sound and spelling can be a spell. The
  American edition, of which I have spoken, does really translate everything in
  reason. It explains the ordinary sense of Chaucer's narrative with sustained
  and competent clearness, but it works on the assumption that everything must
  be translated from the foreign language called Chaucerian into the other
  language called English&mdash;or perhaps American. The consequence is that while
  the style and the story go forward energetically, something has gone out of
  the story and the style; and what has vanished is the song. Thus, to take the
  test case of a passage so often quoted, the dying speech of Arcite, I should
  think it quite satisfactory to leave the lines substantially as they
  stand:</p>

  <p class="verse">What is this world? What asken man to have?<br>
  Now with his love, now in his coldë grave,<br>
  Alone withouten any company.</p>

  <p>But the conscientious transatlantic translator thinks it his duty to make
  it scan in modern grammar by saying:</p>

  <p class="verse">What is this world? What asketh man to have?<br>
  Now with his love, now cold within his grave,<br>
  Alone, alone, with none for company.</p>

  <p>Now somehow or other, with the best intentions, he has broken the backbone
  of the tragic line with a load of repetition, like the repetitions that fill
  up bad blank verse; while the original simple line 'alone withouten any
  company' is like a desolate yet living cry, echoing in a vault of stone. That
  is the intangible trick that we call poetry. And that is the paradox of
  dealing with the present problem of Chaucer. The same thing that convinces us
  that he must be translated convinces us that he cannot be translated.</p>

  <p>In my own citations, therefore, I have adopted the principle of altering
  the lilt or accent or form of the line as little as possible, and only
  altering the words where they are in actual fact foreign words. But I am
  quite conscious that even by doing this I lose a great deal, and can only say
  that there are readers who could hardly get anything, if this were not lost.
  If I criticize other experiments, I would accompany the criticism with a
  profound groan of gratitude, to St. Thomas of Canterbury or my patron saint,
  that I have not got the job of carrying out my own principles of
  interpretation through a complete translation of Chaucer's works. The thing
  is so stupendously difficult that even to do it decently is to do it
  admirably. I for one (if I may excuse myself in the polite manner of the poet
  among the story-tellers) do not propose to do it at all. But it seems only
  right, since I have quoted the poetry in a particular form, according to my
  own taste and fancy, that I should insert here this brief note upon the
  practical rules I have observed. For the rest, I am quite sure that the
  translator need not avoid slight variations of speech, such as are no longer
  used but are still understood. On the contrary, I think he should preserve
  them rather carefully, for they very often have a unique quality lost in the
  later development of the language. The old word can actually strike a new
  note. We have all observed the fine touch of distinction given in Shakespeare
  or Milton by the mere shifting of the accent on a familiar word, or the
  variation of a customary termination; the pleasure there is in realizing that
  Hamlet says 'I'll wipe away all trivial fond recòrds', merely because we
  always say 'récords'; or in repeating Milton's ending, 'And summons given,
  the dread consult began'. I hope no American will translate Milton into
  English and turn it into a consultation&mdash;the common consultation one has with
  a doctor or a dentist or a trustee. There is not a little of this pleasure,
  among the many pleasures of reading Chaucer. Aristotle, the teacher of
  medieval men, said very truly that the language of poetry has a perpetual
  slight novelty. It is none the less so, when the slight novelty is a slight
  antiquity.</p>

  <p>In my own unscrupulous experiment, I should aim at two things; first, as
  far as possible preserving the original word; and second, preserving the
  originality of the original word. Now in some cases we cannot keep the force
  of the word, if we keep the form of the word. Men cannot think a strange word
  striking if they do not know what it means; but short of that, it may be all
  the more striking because it is more strange. There has been very little
  recognition of the possibility of such an intermediate course. Chaucer is
  either copied in a style that is not popular, or translated into a style that
  is not Chaucer.</p>

  <p>There was never a better criticism of Chaucer than that written within a
  hundred years of his death by old Caxton the printer; nor has this particular
  aptitude with words been expressed in words so apt. The medieval master
  printer's estimate is worth libraries of the patronizing pedantry, that has
  been written in the four hundred years that followed. 'For he writeth no void
  words; but all his matter is full of high and quick sentence'; that is,
  sense; <i>sententia</i>. The melodious but monotonous etiquette of much
  medieval poetry was a perpetual temptation to write void words; like the void
  words of modern journalese; except that the medieval words at least were
  graceful and the modern words base.</p>

  <p>Very tentatively, therefore, and with all the mingled tact and terror
  proper to an amateur in a field where so many scholars must have speculated,
  I am in favour of doing for Chaucer something like what has already been done
  for Shakespeare. I mean publishing a popularized version, in so far as this
  can be done by the mere simplification of spelling or clarification of common
  words, where the difference is a difficulty; and nowhere else. I do not mean
  modernizing Chaucer, in the sense of making him appear modern; I mean only
  elucidating him just enough to permit him to appear medieval. I imagine that
  a multitude of medieval things have already, in fact, been treated in this
  way; Malory and the Paston Letters and any number of Border Ballads,
  especially those in the original Scots. It is unfortunate that Chaucer
  happens historically to stand, as if he were a Borderer himself, on the exact
  frontier between writing in a foreign language that is translated and writing
  only in an old-fashioned language that needs only to be brought up to date.
  This makes the thing much more difficult to do; but not the less worth
  doing.</p>

  <p>Broadly, my principle would be this; that no reader minds meeting an old
  word, but is only bothered when he meets a new word. I mean, of course, a
  word that is new to him; a word that is old enough to be new. He does not
  dislike, but likes, any ancient medieval monument as such, so long as it does
  not block the road, and hold up the ride to Canterbury. For instance, in the
  famous line I have quoted from 'The Knight's Tale,' what in the world is the
  use of altering the word 'withouten'? If there be any human being who can
  read the line, 'Alone withouten any company', who does not know at once that
  'withouten' means 'without', I should imagine he must be a very rare and
  isolated sort of reader; withouten any company and certainly withouten any
  common sense. But when, in another passage I have also quoted, the poet
  lamenting over Troilus speaks of 'this false world's brotelness', then I
  should boldly alter it in the modern version to 'brittleness', precisely
  because it would be quite natural to suppose that it meant 'brutalness'.
  Where there is an ambiguity of that sort, for a modern reader, I would not
  give the word a modern meaning, but merely give it back its own medieval
  meaning. I admit that the task would be terribly delicate, and I have not the
  faintest intention of trying to do it myself. It would be a matter of
  tireless and sustained tact, every touch of which would look like caprice. It
  would have to turn perpetually to different solutions for different problems;
  sometimes alteration, sometimes accentuation, sometimes annotation. Anyone
  rushing lightly upon it may well be checked at the very start; for I think
  the very first line of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> presents the greatest
  difficulty of all. Many a modern reader may have been induced to try Chaucer,
  as merely a rather old-fashioned English writer, and found, 'Whan that
  Aprille with his schowres swoote,' a slight obstacle at the start. Merely to
  show what I mean by using different methods, I should be frankly inconsistent
  in dealing with the difficulties of that line. I should leave 'Whan' (who
  would be such a fool as not to know that it meant 'when'?) but I might in
  compassion alter 'schowres' to 'showers', lest the consonants be really
  misleading, and because the syllabification is just the same. I should put an
  accent on the second syllable of 'Aprille', and the mark showing that the 'e'
  is not mute. Finally, if I could not change 'swoote' to 'sweet' (because,
  curse it, it has to rhyme to root), I would put a foot-note to say that it is
  meant for sweet and pronounced more like 'sooty'. I see a vast and varied
  task open before me; from which I cheerfully turn away.</p>

  <p>Now my only excuse for dwelling on this literary possibility is that I do
  think it a matter of vital importance to open up the English past at least as
  far as Chaucer, in the sense that it has been opened up as far as
  Shakespeare. As I shall try to point out here, the great river of the
  national culture and character did in some sense grow narrower as well as
  swifter and stronger, at the moment when it came over the rocks in the
  cataract of the Elizabethan Renaissance. But, anyhow, it falsifies everything
  to suppose that, because all modern intellectual life still moves with the
  impetus of that mighty fall, therefore the fall is the same as the fountain.
  A man does not understand England who has read Shakespeare and not Chaucer,
  any more than a man understands Italy who has read Tasso and not Dante, or a
  man understands France who has read Ronsard and not Villon. Anybody can see
  that these ancient inspirations are constantly coming to the surface again,
  sometimes much later than the later fashions; that much cynical French
  writing derives rather from Villon than from Ronsard, or that the new vision
  of Italy may find more in the imperialism of Dante than in the ornamental
  chivalry of Tasso. So there are all sorts of things in Chaucer, or for that
  matter, in Langland, which should come out in a complete consciousness of the
  English destiny; and which happened, by historical accident, to be more or
  less out of sight for the very greatest of the Elizabethans. In a word, the
  ordinary modern Englishman will considerably enlarge his mind by reading
  Chaucer; and it is my humble desire that he should to some extent be able to
  read Chaucer, even if he is unable to read Middle English or Anglo-Saxon or
  Norman-French; or if he is, by mere sloth and moral weakness, unable to read
  the learned books in which the structure of these various languages is set
  forth. I do believe, as Dryden did, that it would be a good thing to make
  Chaucer an ordinary possession of ordinary Englishmen; and I should not think
  the thing thrown away, even if, like Dryden's experiment, it had to be done
  over again about three hundred years hence. In the future, for all I know,
  men will say that our culture began with Dryden. In that case our culture
  will stop short with Dryden. Even at present, as I do know, many men talk as
  if our culture began with Shakespeare. In that case their culture stops short
  with Shakespeare. And, as I propose to suggest in this chapter, there really
  are matters in which even Shakespeare stops short of Chaucer.</p>

  <p>But in these opening words I only claim to maintain that Chaucer is
  readable, or can readily be made readable by ignorant people like myself; I
  am not in the least concerned to conceal my ignorance. It will be noted that
  nowhere in this book have I made any pretence of pronouncing upon the purely
  philological or grammatical or metrical problems, with which the study of
  Chaucer, for the students of Chaucer, teems on every side. There is a whole
  labyrinth for grammarians and the scientific students of language in the
  development of the medieval English dialects, and the degree of their
  absorption in the French-English of Chaucer. There is a world of inquiry, and
  very interesting and important inquiry, in the matter of his adoption of
  Continental metres or schemes of scansion, and the order in which he adopted
  them. But it is the whole point of this book that Chaucer is literature and
  not linguistic study for the learned; that it needs very little to make him
  popular in the sense that literature can be popular; and that learning is a
  totally different thing. I have learned some rudiments of Chaucerian problems
  at school, or rather neglected to learn them at school, and I have read and
  forgotten a good many facts on the same subject since. But I should no more
  think of setting up to be an authority on Chaucer than an authority on Punch
  and Judy; or Pickwick; or the Christmas pantomime. These things are not
  studied, but appreciated. What little I remember of earlier instruction leads
  me to think that it has changed a great deal, and that some parts of it were
  always rather crabbed and perverse. I remember that the jokes of Chaucer were
  the subject of specially serious discussion. Doubtless there does exist this
  second class of Chaucerian difficulties, but I doubt whether I am
  particularly suited to overcome them.</p>

  <p>There is something faintly irritating in the fact that so many
  popularizers of Chaucer have described his humour as 'sly'. And yet there is
  something in it; or something to be got out of the right understanding of it.
  Doubtless it is partly due to a more or less external and technical trick of
  expression; he is very fond of laughing in a parenthetical manner, like the
  aside of a comic actor; so that even when the joke itself is jolly and
  obvious enough, it has the grammatical shape of a broad grin in brackets.
  This is common enough; perhaps the best example is that charming passage in
  the charming fable of the Cock and Hen, in which the former bitterly exclaims
  in Latin, <i>mulier est hominis confusio</i>, and Chaucer gravely adds the
  explanation:</p>

  <p class="verse">'Madame, the sentence of this Latin is Woman is mannës joy
  and mannës bliss.'</p>

  <p>When the critic calls this sly, we can see what he means; but in fact the
  effect is produced not so much by being secretive as by being simply
  impudent. Anyhow, the general effect is produced by being large and simple
  and all of a piece. Chaucer's humour is spread over so wide a surface of
  himself that it is always partially present, when he seems most serious and
  especially when he seems most simple. But there is a third accidental aspect
  in which Chaucer may truly in some sense be congratulated on his slyness. I
  suspect that he has made a good many jokes that his critics and commentators
  cannot see; and one or two which the commentators have sat down grimly and
  resolutely to prove not to be jokes at all. True, their serious explanations
  change. I remember how a schoolmaster explained to me with desperate
  seriousness, in the days of my youth, that Chaucer's remark about the French
  language, as spoken by the Prioress, was pure and unstained by any
  adulteration of amusement. Chaucer says that the Prioress spoke French very
  well according to the school of Stratford-at-Bow: 'For French of Paris was to
  her unknown.' The authority then proceeded to prove, with academic passion,
  that French, so long the language of the English court and aristocracy,
  really was talked correctly at Stratford; and therefore Chaucer can be
  acquitted of the grave charge of flippancy, when he said she was unacquainted
  with the French of France. I fancy that the smile of Chaucer, as he left the
  court without a stain on his character, might truly be described as a little
  sly. For it might occur to simpler souls than the academic, and intelligences
  more in touch with Chaucerian simplicity, that even if correct French is
  talked by foreigners, there is still something a little funny about pitting
  it against that national tongue as talked by the natives. If I were to say,
  'Professor Hiram Q. Hike spoke the most correct and cultivated English that
  Boston can produce, though he ignored some nuances adopted in London,
  England', I think it barely possible that I might be suspected of irony. And
  the charge would not be answered by saying that the people of Boston do talk
  English, or something they have a right to call English; that they talk much
  better English than the people of Bison City, Texas; and that Boston is
  justly proud of a great tradition of English scholars and critics. There
  would still remain the faint possibility that critics even more English might
  be found in England. If somebody said, 'Our Guatemalan guide talked a vivid
  and picturesque Spanish, which would have considerably puzzled the
  inhabitants of Spain', it would not entirely extract the sting to say that
  Spanish is the official language of Guatemala. And so, when even a poor
  medieval poet goes out of his way to compare the French talked by an English
  lady with the French talked by Frenchmen, I am, and was even as a boy,
  disposed darkly to suspect that he saw the fun of it. Of course this
  individual authority may have been only an individual and not an authority. I
  only know that the criticism was confidently imposed on me in my schooldays.
  But what amuses me most is to discover that a totally opposite criticism has
  been confidently imposed since. Later on, I discovered that the serious
  commentators were saying (at another stage) that the passage about the
  Prioress means, not that she spoke French well, but that she did not speak
  French at all. And they quote certain phrases two hundred years later, which
  suggest that knowledge acquired in Stratford-at-Bow had become a proverb for
  total ignorance. This seems much the more plausible dogma of the two; but
  even of this I am daring enough to have my doubts. Saluting in all
  seriousness men better informed than myself, and being myself in every way a
  citizen of Stratford-at-Bow in the matter of ignorance, I still think that
  the emphasis of such expressions varies much from age to age; that a
  suggestion might be positive under Elizabeth which was relative under Edward
  III; and that the nuance of Shakespeare's language might be different from
  the nuance of Chaucer. I still think that the best way of finding the nuance
  of Chaucer is to look for it in Chaucer. Given the character and the context,
  I think it most likely that Chaucer meant the Prioress to speak French as an
  English schoolmistress speaks it, stiffly and imperfectly but not altogether
  without pretension. The joke against this sort of <i>parly-vooing</i> might
  easily have been broadened and blunted until it came to mean common insular
  ignorance. But I may be quite wrong; and I do not attach much importance to
  the question of being right. I only note that if the learned are now right,
  some of the earlier learned were very wrong.</p>

  <p>A somewhat more serious reason, however, led me a few paragraphs back to
  bring into consideration the attempt of Dryden to popularize or modernize
  Chaucer in his own day. For the whole of this business of the modern
  translation of Chaucer, or the medieval difficulties of Chaucer, is bound up
  with the general destiny of literature and language after his death. He was
  indeed saluted after his death in tones of very noble loyalty and gratitude
  by the few fine English poets that were at all worthy to praise him; by
  Occleve and by Lydgate. But we hardly have that impression of a literary
  dynasty that we might have expected as following such a king and conqueror in
  the world of culture. Curiously enough, as many acute critics have pointed
  out, the richer and more romantic quality of Chaucer's tradition was carried
  on rather more continuously in Scotland than in England. The Wars of the
  Roses, I suppose, had something to do with it. Anyhow, when a full poetic
  inspiration came to England, it came as the influence of de Meung or Petrarch
  had come to Chaucer; direct from foreign lands, but from lands now in the
  full noonday of the Renaissance. Everybody can see the sense in which that
  noonday sun was brighter even than the brightest star in the medieval night
  of the north. But there is something more to be said about the comparison,
  which has never, as it seems to me, been said sufficiently clearly. And as
  the matter arises directly out of an attempt like that of Dryden, and the
  suggestion that it should be repeated, I will deal with it here.</p>

  <p>To many in the nineteenth century the notion of Dryden paraphrasing
  Chaucer was very like their notion about Pope translating Homer. It was the
  notion of a primitive giant being introduced by a dwarf who was also a dandy.
  They thought that Pope had done nothing but provide the golden-haired Apollo
  with a gilded peruke, or the swift-footed Achilles with a pair of high-heeled
  shoes; giving a new irony to the weakness of the heel of Achilles. They
  exalted Chapman's Homer against Pope's (as did Keats, the greatest of the
  Romantics) merely because Chapman was full of the particular Elizabethan type
  of fire and fancy. Only, as Arnold and others eventually hinted, there was
  something to be said on the other side. Pope is not very like Homer; but he
  is so far like Homer that he talks like a sane man; and the great
  Elizabethans did not always do so; neither indeed did the great
  Romantics.</p>

  <p>In the same way, the critics of the more romantic nineteenth century felt
  sure that Dryden could do nothing in the red-rose thicket or daisied lawn of
  the medieval poet, except clip the hedges with the extravagant trimness of
  topiary; or turn a Dantesque forest into a Dutch garden. It was owing to the
  particular angle at which they stood at that moment to historical research
  and political theory. They exaggerated very much the antiquity and simplicity
  of Chaucer; they also exaggerated very much the artificiality and decadence
  of Dryden. They did not understand the many respects in which Dryden stood
  much nearer to Chaucer than they did themselves. And we may repeat, with all
  respect to them, that one of these was the same as in the other case; that
  Chaucer and Dryden both talked sense. There was indeed, as I have suggested
  before and shall more fully explain later, a sense in which Chaucer talked
  nonsense; and a somewhat different sense in which Shakespeare talked
  nonsense. But they did not talk nonsense with that high seriousness, that
  earnest belief in effort, that faith in the utmost for the highest, which was
  sometimes the special glory of the Victorian era. There was even a quality of
  objective rationality, which separated them in some degree from the
  imaginative ambitions of the Elizabethan era. Chaucer may be a very ancient
  well of English undefiled; and Dryden may be only a seventeenth-century
  specimen of an artificial lake, not to say an ornamental pond. But both the
  well and the pond have this in common; that they are still waters that may
  possibly run deep, and do at any rate reflect calmly the real objects of
  earth and sky. Whereas the torrent of the Renaissance in the sixteenth
  century, and the torrent of the Romantics in the nineteenth century, are much
  too splendid and inspiring as torrents to be useful for any sort of
  reflection. In other words, we need to look a little more carefully into the
  real merits of these various phases of literary history, and to note
  especially what there was about Chaucer that does in some ways separate him
  from Shakespeare; and may even in some ways unite him to Dryden. I think the
  quickest way of approaching it is through something in the particular nature
  of his humour, even though it is so elusive as to have caused disturbance
  among the learned, some of whom call it sly, some of whom refuse with dignity
  to see any humour at all.</p>

  <p>However, this particular sort of slyness, and its distinction from a
  darker kind, does give us a key to certain very vital changes following on
  the Chaucerian simplicity. I know that commentators, or those critics who
  chiefly shine as commentators, are often gravely anxious to clear great men
  of the charge of talking nonsense. They apply it to Shakespeare; who has
  whole passages in which he talks nothing but nonsense. When Hamlet says, 'I
  am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a
  hand-saw,' the remark strikes his critics as one eminently suitable for
  scientific and rationalizing treatment; some hastily amending it to 'I know a
  hawk from a heronshaw,' and the other, I think, inventing some new tool or
  utensil called a hawk. I know nothing of these things; they may be right. But
  seeing that the man was a fantastic humorist in any case, and pretending to
  be a lunatic at that, and seeing he starts the very same sentence by saying
  he is mad, it seems to me, as a humble fellow-habitant of Hanwell, that he
  probably meant to say, 'a hawk from a hand-saw', as he might have said, 'a
  bishop from a blunderbuss', or, 'a postman from a pickle-jar'. Now this sort
  of wild fantasticality is Shakespearian but not Chaucerian. Chaucer has in
  the background too much of that logic which was the backbone of the Middle
  Ages. The Renaissance was, as much as anything, a revolt from the logic of
  the Middle Ages. We speak of the Renaissance as the birth of rationalism; it
  was in many ways the birth of irrationalism. It is true that the medieval
  School-men, who had produced the finest logic that the world has ever seen,
  had in later years produced more logic than the world can ever be expected to
  stand. They had loaded and lumbered up the world with libraries of mere
  logic; and some effort was bound to be made to free it from such endless
  chains of deduction. Therefore, there was in the Renaissance a wild touch of
  revolt, not against religion but against reason. Thus one of the very
  greatest of the sixteenth-century giants was almost as much of a nonsense
  writer as Edward Lear: Rabelais. So another of the very greatest wrote an
  Orlando Furioso which might sometimes be called Ariosto Furioso. So, in the
  same way, the narration of Raphael Hythloday is a wild jest. But there are
  some who still believe, quite literally, that Thomas More's Utopia describes
  the Utopia of Thomas More. For all I know, there may be some who believe that
  his friend Erasmus wrote <i>The Praise of Folly</i> because he thought that
  all fools were truly deserving of praise. As the Latin exercise-book said,
  there are some who laugh; and there are some who apparently don't, under the
  most extreme provocation. There may be some, for all I know, who would quote
  the anti-feminist observation of Chaucer's cock, with its cowardly
  parenthesis, as solid and scientific proof that a dead language was used to
  keep the people in ignorance; and that woman was oppressed by refusing her
  the benefits of education.</p>

  <p>In any case, the truth in this suggestion of slyness is that it is a
  suggestion of sense. Chaucer was a man much more prudent, and in some ways
  much more balanced, than the great men of the Renaissance who came after him.
  Just as it was not in his temper, so it was not in his tradition, to let a
  joke run away with him, or to indulge a fantasy at the expense of everything
  else. It was the essence of the medieval philosophy that there is danger in
  all directions, just as there is good in all directions. That is the meaning
  of that balanced scheme of Mortal Sins, of Pride and Sloth and Avarice and
  the rest, with which Chaucer actually concludes and crowns the whole huge
  design of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>; and of which Mrs. Haldane, the wife of
  the professor, recently remarked mysteriously that they are all 'quite out of
  date'. Whether she really meant that nobody nowadays runs after money, or
  neglects any of his duties, or thinks too much of himself, I do not know. But
  what the medievals meant, by thus dividing and labelling the vices, was that
  a man might fall into one of these vices even when fleeing too far from
  another. A man who neglects his business may fall into sloth; a man who
  pursues his business may fall into avarice. And what the wreckers of the
  medieval system really did, practically and in the long run, was to let loose
  some of the vices on the excuse of exterminating the others. After the
  Renaissance, the Pagans went in for unlimited lust and the Puritans for
  unlimited avarice; on the excuse that at least neither of them was being
  guilty of sloth.</p>

  <p>The poets, who take the tone of the time, had often a touch of this
  lawlessness, and of something that can be worse than lawlessness;
  concentration. That is, the time tended sometimes to be not only maniac but
  monomaniac. Chaucer inherited the tradition of a Church which had condemned
  heresies on the right hand and the left; and always claimed to stand for the
  truth as a whole and not for concentration on a part. He came indeed in days
  when that tradition was not at its best, and was beginning to degenerate into
  bitterness and abnormality; but he is himself a living embodiment of what
  that tradition had really been. <i>Communis sententia</i>; the phrase is
  Latin and very medieval. It marks the real effects of 'the vulgar tongue'
  that everybody knew what it meant while it was in Latin, and nobody notices
  what it means now it is in English. A modern man using the term does not even
  notice the word 'common' and means the very contrary of 'common'. He means
  private judgment; his own personal incommunicable sense. But Chaucer was very
  medieval and he was pickled in common sense.</p>

  <p>The point is worthy of note, because it is one of the points in which his
  greatness has been rather unfairly overshadowed by the greatness of
  Shakespeare. When all is said, there was in the very greatest of the
  sixteenth-century men of genius a slight slip or failure upon the point of
  common sense. That is what Voltaire meant when he called Shakespeare an
  inspired barbarian; and there is something to be said for Voltaire as well as
  for Shakespeare. Let it be agreed, on the one hand, that the Renaissance
  poets had in one sense obtained a wider as well as a wilder range. But though
  they juggled with worlds, they had less real sense of how to balance a world,
  I am sorry that Chaucer 'left half-told the story of Cambuscan bold', and I
  can imagine that that flying horse might have carried the hero into very
  golden skies of Greek or Asiatic romance; but I am prepared to agree that he
  would never have beaten Ariosto in anything like a voyage to the moon. On the
  other hand, even in Ariosto there is something symbolic, if only accidentally
  symbolic, in the fact that his poem is less tragic but more frantic than 'The
  Song of Roland'; and deals not with Roland Dead but with Roland Mad. Anyhow,
  what is here only accidental becomes in the Elizabethans rather anarchical.
  When all is said, there is something a little sinister in the number of mad
  people there are in Shakespeare. We say that he uses his fools to brighten
  the dark background of tragedy; I think he sometimes uses them to darken it.
  Somewhere on that highest of all human towers there is a tile loose. There is
  something that rattles rather crazily in the high wind of the highest of
  mortal tragedies. What is felt faintly even in Shakespeare is felt far more
  intensely in the other Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists; they seem to go
  in for dancing ballets of lunatics and choruses of idiots, until sanity is
  the exception rather than the rule. In some ways Chaucer's age was even
  harsher than Shakespeare's; but even its ferocity was rational. Chaucer
  describes a whole crowd of many-coloured personalities, of all possible types
  and tendencies. But I do not remember that, in the whole five volumes of
  Chaucer, there is such a thing as a madman.</p>

  <p>In other words, the medieval mind did not really believe that the truth
  was to be found by going to extremes. And the Elizabethan mind had already
  had a sort of hint that it might be found there; at the extreme edges of
  existence and precipices of the human imagination. That is why there followed
  in theology and thought, after the Renaissance, such extremes of speculation
  as the Calvinist or the Antinomian. I am concerned here to point out a
  difference rather than a preference; my own preferences are pretty obvious,
  but they are not the obvious truth involved here. The point is that even
  those who see the change as bringing more liberty may admit that it brought
  less sanity. Chaucer was not on the edge of a precipice, but in the middle of
  a solid meadow of daisies. And he not only was sure of his own common sense;
  he was also sure that the sense was really common.</p>

  <p>Somebody said, and eventually everybody said, something about 'the
  spacious days of Queen Elizabeth'. I fancy it has falsified history more than
  any other popular quotation. If they had said, 'the spacious days of King
  Richard the Second', it would, in some ways, have been much more true; that
  is, in the sense of a consciousness of the whole problem of the whole people,
  of community with other countries and the Continent as a whole, or the vision
  of life in the light of a general philosophy. The Elizabethan epoch was of
  intense interest; of intensive intelligence; of piercing sharpness and
  delicacy in certain new forms of diplomacy and domestic policy, and the arts
  of the ambassador and the courtier; and, especially in one or two great men,
  of vivid and concentrated genius in the study of certain particular problems
  of character. But it was not spacious. If there was one thing it did not
  possess, it was that particular sort of fresh air that blows over the daisied
  meadows of Chaucer. Its special and specialist studies involved men in almost
  everything except fresh air. I have used the word 'involved' by accident; but
  it is applicable as well as accidental. Everything, even the great poetry of
  Elizabethan times, was a little too much involved. In literature it was the
  age of conceits. In politics it was the age of conspiracies. In those
  conspiracies there is a curious absence of the fresh popular spirit that
  often blew like a wind even through the heresies and horrors of the Middle
  Ages. None of it was in the same world with the Peasants' Rising. The age of
  Richard the Second was an age of revolutions. The age of Elizabeth was an age
  of plots. And we all know that this was mirrored more or less even in the
  mightiest minds of that epoch. It is almost in a double sense that we talk
  about Shakespeare's 'plots'. In almost every case, it is a plot about a plot.
  He has even a sort of restlessness vaguely connected with the
  sixteenth-century sense of the importance and the insecurity of princes.
  'Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown'; and also the head that has crowns
  on the brain.</p>

  <p>That Shakespeare is the English giant, all but alone in his stature among
  the sons of men, is a truth that does not really diminish with distance. But
  it is a truth with two aspects; a shield with two sides; a sword with two
  edges. It is exactly because Shakespeare is an English giant that he blocks
  up the perspective of English history. He is as disproportionate to his own
  age as to every age; but he throws a misleading limelight on his own age and
  throws a gigantic shadow back on the other ages. For this reason many will
  not even know what I mean, when I talk about the greater spaciousness around
  the medieval poet. If the matter were pushed to a challenge, however, I could
  perhaps illustrate my meaning even better with another medieval poet. It is
  vaguely implied that Shakespeare was always jolly and Dante always gloomy.
  But, in a philosophical sense, it is almost the other way. It is notably so
  if, so to speak, we actually bring Shakespeare to the test of Dante. Do we
  not know in our hearts that Shakespeare could have dealt with Dante's Hell
  but hardly with Dante's Heaven? In so far as it is possible to be greater
  than anything that is really great, the man who wrote of Romeo and Juliet
  might have made something even more poignant out of Paolo and Francesca. The
  man who uttered that pulverizing 'He has no children,' over the butchery in
  the house of Macduff, might have picked out yet more awful and telling words
  for the father's cry out of the Tower of Hunger. But the Tower of Hunger is
  not spacious. And when Dante is really dealing with the dance of the
  liberated virtues in the vasty heights of heaven, he is spacious. He is
  spacious when he talks of Liberty; he is spacious when he talks of Love. It
  is so in the famous words at the end about Love driving the sun and stars; it
  is the same in the far less famous and far finer passage, in which he hails
  the huge magnanimity of God in giving to the human spirit the one gift worth
  having; which is Liberty. Nobody but a fool will say that Shakespeare was a
  pessimist; but we may, in this limited sense, say that he was a pagan; in so
  far that he is at his greatest in describing great spirits in chains. In that
  sense, his most serious plays are an Inferno. Anyhow, they are certainly not
  a Paradiso.</p>

  <p>I only use Shakespeare here as a parallel, and I will not continue it
  indefinitely as a parenthesis. Otherwise I should, of course, qualify the
  word paganism by well-known facts about his life, as well as by the whole
  tone of his literature. That Shakespeare was a Catholic is a thing that every
  Catholic feels by every sort of convergent common sense to be true. It is
  supported by the few external and political facts we know; it is utterly
  unmistakable in the general spirit and atmosphere; and in nothing more than
  in the scepticism, which appears in some aspects to be paganism. But I am not
  talking about the various kinds of Catholic; I am talking about the
  atmosphere of the sixteenth century as compared with the fourteenth century.
  And I say that while the former was more refined, it was in certain special
  ways more restricted, or properly speaking, more concentrated. Shakespeare is
  more concentrated on Hamlet than Dante is upon Hell; for the very reason that
  Dante's mind is full of the larger plan of which this is merely a part. But,
  it may reasonably be said, I have no right to take the case of Dante in order
  to make out a case for Chaucer. I am not likely to pretend that Chaucer
  absorbed every detail of the Thomist theology and purely theoretical ethics
  of the Divine Comedy. What, it may be asked, has Chaucer to do with Dante;
  what did he actually inherit from Dante? I answer, the spaciousness. The
  general sense of not being himself in prison; for Chaucer does not himself go
  to prison with Palamon and Arcite, as Shakespeare does in some sense go to
  prison with Richard the Second. Nay, to some extent, and in some subtle
  fashion, Shakespeare seems to identify himself with Hamlet who finds Denmark
  a prison, or the whole world a prison. We do not have this sense of things
  closing in upon the soul in Chaucer, with his simple tragedies; one might
  almost say, his sunny tragedies. In his world misfortunes are misfortunes,
  like clouds in the sky; but there is a sky. And there is a quite
  indescribable serenity that comes from security, in the thought that the sky
  is settled in an accepted order; or, as the medieval men used to put it, that
  the heavens are incorruptible. This sense, which Chaucer has vaguely and
  Dante vividly, is in all its variations quite different from the later mood
  that culminated in Ford and Webster; where the storm has become more than the
  sky. It appeared in Chaucer in a leisurely and allusive fashion, but it is
  there all right; and it is the consciousness of a cosmic philosophy at the
  back of the mind. It is enough to a man of his temperament to joke about it;
  to say that it can all be found in 'olde bookes'; to feel a sort of
  satisfaction that somebody somewhere has a hundred books clothed in black
  and red, of Aristotle and his philosophy. But it is the feeling that was lost
  at the Renaissance, when so much else was gained; the feeling of a sort of
  reasonable repose in the common sense of Christian philosophy; especially the
  colossal common sense of St. Thomas Aquinas.</p>

  <p>Thus we have the paradox that the spirit of the Renaissance, at the very
  moment when it seemed to most men to be emerging into the daylight, was, in
  another sense, at that very moment plunging into the dark. It was plunging
  into those dark problems of scepticism with which the world is wrestling
  still. But it is not a mere question of some calling scepticism an
  enlightenment and others calling it a benighted gloom. There really was
  something of mystification and secrecy in the very air which Shakespeare
  breathed; which remains in the sort of biographical problems which he left
  behind him. I have said elsewhere that there is a certain parallel between
  the obscurity of Chaucer and the obscurity of Shakespeare, in a practical or
  political sense. But the cases are very different in this spiritual or
  atmospheric sense. The mystery of Chaucer is mainly negative; it simply
  arises from the fact that we happen to have few official records and no
  private memoirs. It is a <i>hiatus valde deflendus</i>; but it is not, thank
  God, a Cipher. Nobody can imagine <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> being a
  Cryptogram. It was only possible to suggest it of Shakespeare because
  Shakespeare had the bad luck to live in an age of cryptograms. That is, he
  lived in an age of conspiracies. But, in fact, there are real riddles for
  Shakespearians; quite apart from the mad riddles of Baconians. There is no
  Mr. W. H. to distract our minds from the poetry of Chaucer. Chaucer's purely
  personal poems are mostly of the sort that anybody could understand; such as
  frank and hearty demands for more money. There are problems about his private
  life, as is noted elsewhere; but they are not presented in a manner at once
  deliberate, defiant and tantalizing, as are some of the relations adumbrated
  in the Sonnets. His Dark Lady was never so dark as all that. She is rather,
  so to speak, a wash-out; a figure so faint and pale that we cannot be certain
  whether she existed, or whether the poet is really writing about her at all.
  Here again, the obscurity is merely negative; but in the Sonnets there is a
  positive obscurity, a darkness visible. It was said that Shakespeare unlocked
  his heart with this key; but it sometimes seems truer to say that he hampered
  the lock.</p>

  <p>It is well to remember that this particular <i>kind</i> of perplexity has
  really come into the world since the breakdown of the medieval order; even
  though the breakdown was accompanied by brilliant diversions in all other
  directions. It is true, for instance, that the Renaissance had expanded the
  exploration of the earth; and in that sense, I have spoken of its artists
  inhabiting a wider and a wilder world. But in some other respects, they
  inhabited a world which, though certainly wilder, was not so wide. It was
  very exciting to discover that there were Red Indians or yellow Chinamen; but
  it did not increase the old Roman and philosophical sense of the broad
  brotherhood of the <i>humanum genus</i>: the human race. Rather it raised new
  problems about it; problems which produced all sorts of horrible things, from
  slavery to anthropology. It was very satisfactory to know that you could pay
  a visit to mountains made of silver or cities made of gold; but humanity was
  not in fact so much united by the wealth of Ferdinand as by the poverty of
  Francis. Nothing, indeed, was destined in the long run to produce such
  bottomless botheration and bewildering intellectual difficulties, as the
  relation of the precious metals to the older and more practical economics.
  Those gallant men, who stormed the gates of the sunset to set up the golden
  banners of Spain, were fortunately unaware that they were fixing on a peak in
  Darien the enigmatic ensign that we call the Gold Standard.</p>

  <p>What we have to realize, in short (against much of the atmospheric
  assumptions or allusions of modern literature), is that the older
  intellectual world was not stupid merely because it was static. Whatever our
  creed, that is as stupid as calling Confucius stupid because China was
  static. Chaucer's world was simpler, in the sense that there were fewer
  unanswered questions. But whether or no we think the questions had been
  rightly answered, they had certainly been rationally answered. Intelligent
  men had answered them in an intelligent way; in such a way that an
  intelligent man like Chaucer could repose in the reasons given. This is
  simply a fact of history, necessary to the elucidation of biography; it has
  nothing to do with whether we ourselves accept the theology, or even the
  philosophy. The point to grasp is that we disagree with it as a philosophy;
  as we might disagree with the Platonic or the Positivist philosophy; not as
  we disagree with a wild savage taboo in Africa or a Prohibitionist prejudice
  in Alabama.</p>

  <p>There are inferences from all this which I shall discuss in the last
  chapter of this book. For the moment, the point to realize is, not merely
  that there is something to be said for medievalism against the Renaissance (a
  view which Ruskin and the modern medievalists have sufficiently made clear),
  but that in some special aspects medievalism could be more rational, or even
  more rationalistic, than the Renaissance. I am well aware that it is a case
  not only of complexities, but of contradictions. It is true on the one side
  that the very reason of medievalism was rooted in religion; it is true on the
  other side that the very frenzy of the sixteenth century was akin to a thirst
  for truth. But the distinction I draw is true; and it is of some importance
  in life and letters. The Renaissance genius was never so much intellectually
  inspired as when he seemed to be intellectually intoxicated; and his very
  depression was an exaltation. It would be something to be able even to
  despair like one of Shakespeare's characters. A dying man might want to live,
  if he could go on producing such phrases as 'Absent thee from felicity
  awhile'; he might even continue to absent himself. A murderer might grow
  cheerful, if he were able to utter his misery in those words about life being
  a thing 'full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'. But try the experiment
  of reading a few lines of Aristotle or Aquinas, even as echoed by Chaucer.
  You will begin to wonder (dare we say it?) whether the great Life of the
  Renaissance, if it had been a little less full of sound and fury, might not
  have signified more.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8"></a><small>CHAPTER VIII</small><br>
  The Religion of Chaucer</h2>

  <p class="first">It marks something thin and repetitive, about much of the
  comment on Chaucer, that we can all remember reading twenty times a
  comparison between Chaucer and Langland. It commonly adds to a description of
  <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> something like the remark: 'A very different
  picture is given in <i>Piers Plowman</i>.' It is indeed a different picture,
  because it happens to be a different book, written by a different man. But it
  would be perfectly easy to make the same contrast concerning two descriptions
  of the same period written by the same man. It would mark a rather wider
  contrast to describe the scope and spirit of Pickwick, and then add: 'A very
  different picture is given in <i>Hard Times</i>.' For that matter, it would
  be almost equally effective to take two of the Dickens novels that come next
  to each other in his earliest period and say: 'A very different picture is
  given in Oliver Twist.' And in both cases a reasonable critic will answer,
  somewhat impatiently, that it is indeed a different picture; for the reason
  that a good painter does not generally paint two pictures at once. But in the
  case of the medieval authors, there is always a sort of insinuation that one
  of the two pictures must be false; and that in any case the happier and more
  humane picture cannot be true. The suggestion is that Chaucer, being a court
  poet, was a sort of conservative optimist, while Langland, being supposed to
  be a popular poet, must necessarily have been a pessimist; and pessimists
  must necessarily be right.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, all this view is riddled with inaccuracies, even
  about the actual comparison between Chaucer and Langland. Supposing there
  were any particular reason to compare them, a real comparison would be
  considerably more complex. For instance, though Chaucer is called a courtier,
  it is Chaucer, much more than Langland, who is always saying that true
  nobility is not in noble birth but in noble behaviour; that men are to be
  judged by worth rather than rank; and generally that all men are equal in the
  sight of God. And similarly, though Langland is treated as a revolutionary,
  it is Langland much more than Chaucer who is always saying that upstarts have
  seized power to which their birth does not entitle them; that the claims of
  family have been disregarded through the insolence of novelty, and that men
  are bragging and boasting above their station. There is doubtless much to be
  said for both these views, nor are they really inconsistent with each other.
  But Chaucer can scarcely have said the first in order to flatter the
  aristocracy, nor Langland said the second as part of a demand for change. It
  is also curious that many have missed the point of certain passages in
  Langland, as they have missed the point of so many passages in Chaucer. The
  author of <i>Piers Plowman</i> denounces a vast variety of evils, indeed an
  almost universal conspectus of evils; because the very form of his book is an
  account of something very like a Day of Judgment; and not an account of a
  casual ride of holiday-makers to Canterbury. But in many places he denounces
  the fourteenth-century conditions, not so much because certain classes have
  too little as because they have too much. He denounces the riot and excesses
  that accompanied the economic overturn of his time; but much of it was a
  condition of high though perilously precarious wages, and a wealth which was
  not under adequate or responsible control. He sometimes speaks of beggars as
  if they were bullies, rather than abject creatures; and while he certainly
  thinks the poor are in danger, it is not his point merely that they are in
  destitution. His point is rather that they and everybody else are in chaos;
  and there is much in that sort of lopsided luck that suggests our own time as
  well as his.</p>

  <p>The point is here, however, that Langland was nothing so simple as a man
  lamenting over a starving people; and certainly Chaucer was nothing so simple
  as a smug snob or conservative not knowing or caring whether anybody could
  starve. They were men of very different temperaments, but they did not after
  all bear such very different testimony. They were both highly intelligent
  Christians and Catholics living in an extremely bewildering time of
  transition; in which some things were certainly breaking free, but a good
  many things appeared to be breaking down. The rather remarkable ballade which
  Chaucer addressed to Richard the Second might have been written by Langland
  himself, in his sternest mood of reproach and responsibility. The burden of
  it, even in the literal sense of the refrain of it, is a repeated insistence
  that only Steadfastness can save the nation in such a welter of novelties. It
  is not difficult to imagine that particular personage called Steadfastness
  walking about for edification in The Field Full of Folk.</p>

  <p>It is doubtless true that while Chaucer could sometimes be as severe as
  Langland, it is not very likely that Langland would be as jocular as Chaucer.
  But that in itself hardly shows that Chaucer was lacking in popular
  sympathies. The English lower classes have been known to make jokes, both
  then and now. As a matter of fact, I fancy Langland would have been much more
  harsh to the coarse and common people on the Pilgrimage than Chaucer. But the
  whole comparison arises from the initial ineptitude of not realizing that one
  kind of man will write one kind of book; and that one kind of book will of
  its very nature contain one kind of material. We might as well complain that
  <i>Everyman</i> is tragic as complain that <i>Piers Plowman</i> is prophetic,
  in the sense which some call pessimistic. It is by its whole plan and
  conception a vision of Christ calling all human society to repentance. It is
  not very likely that Chaucer, considered as an artist, would have attacked
  that particular literary scheme at all. But if he had attacked it, he would
  have had exactly the same fundamental ideas about the nature of repentance
  and the authority of Christ. And, what is perhaps more cogent here, he would
  have had exactly the same fundamental belief in the sacramental and
  ecclesiastical system of the Middle Ages. Those who do not realize that fact
  simply do not know that system; though it did not, curiously enough,
  disappear with the Middle Ages.</p>

  <p>Some critics have vaguely suspected Chaucer of being a Lollard, through a
  simple ignorance of what is meant by being a Catholic. I am aware that there
  is a Victorian convention, according to which a literary study should not
  refer to religion, except when there is an opportunity of a passing sneer at
  it. But nobody can make head or tail of the fourteenth century without
  understanding what is meant by being a Catholic; and therefore by being a
  heretic. A man does not come an inch nearer to being a heretic by being a
  hundred times a critic. Nor does he do so because his criticisms resemble
  those of critics who are also heretics. He only becomes a heretic at the
  precise moment when he prefers his criticism to his Catholicism. That is, at
  the instant of separation in which he thinks the view peculiar to himself
  more valuable than the creed that unites him to his fellows. At any given
  moment the Catholic Church is full of people sympathizing with social
  movements or moral ideas, which may happen to have representatives outside
  the Church. For the Church is not a movement or a mood or a direction, but
  the balance of many movements and moods; and membership of it consists of
  accepting the ultimate arbitrament which strikes the balance between them,
  not in refusing to admit any of them into the balance at all. A Catholic does
  not come any nearer to being a Communist by hating the Capitalist
  corruptions, any more than he comes any nearer to being a Moslem by hating
  real idolatry or real excess in wine. He accepts the Church's ruling about
  the use and abuse of wine and images; and after that it is irrelevant how
  much he happens to hate the abuse of them. A Catholic did not come any nearer
  to being a Calvinist by dwelling on the omniscience of God and the power of
  Grace, any more than he came any nearer to being an atheist by saying that
  man possessed reason and freewill. What constituted a Calvinist was that he
  preferred his Calvinism to his Catholicism. And what constituted his
  Catholicism was that he accepted the ultimate arbitration which reconciled
  freewill and grace, and did not exclude either. So a Catholic did not come
  any nearer to being a Lollard because he criticized the ecclesiastical evils
  of the fourteenth century, as Leo the Thirteenth or Cardinal Manning
  criticized the economic evils of the nineteenth century. He said many things
  which Lollards also said, as the Pope and the Cardinal said many things which
  Socialists also said. But he was no nearer to being a Lollard; and nobody can
  begin to suggest that Chaucer was a Lollard, unless he can prove either or
  both of two propositions about him. First, that he held any Lollard doctrine
  that can be proved to be heretical by exact and authoritative definition: the
  sort of precise thing not very likely to be found in such poetry. And,
  second, that if he did hold it as a private opinion, he would in the last
  resort have preferred that private opinion to membership of the Body of
  Christ. I need not say that there is not the wildest suggestion of a reason
  for supposing that Chaucer was a Lollard either in one sense or the
  other.</p>

  <p>To me personally, the Lollard is the most sympathetic of all the heretics.
  I might say, in a figure of speech, that he was the most Catholic of all the
  heretics. He was, beyond any possible question, the least Protestant of all
  the heretics. His whole suggestion, so far as there was any clear suggestion
  beyond a healthy discontent, was the superiority of the Catholic ideals of
  holy poverty and brotherhood to the ranks and powers of this world. But
  'Dominion founded on Grace' is not tenable; nobody could live in a society in
  which practical authority and right were only recognized in holy and innocent
  persons. The experiment of telephoning to a policeman to stop a murder, and
  being told that he must call on the priest for confession on his way to the
  scene of the crime, would be enough to settle the legal practicality of
  Lollardy. It seems to me enormously unlikely that a man of Chaucer's
  temperament, which was sensible almost to excess, ever thought anything of
  the kind. It is quite certain that he never said anything of the kind. It is
  equally certain that he did say something else of a totally different kind,
  which Lollards said also; that it was disgraceful for priests and men in
  authority to be base and unworthy; or, as he put it in a picturesque figure,
  that it was horrible to see a filthy shepherd and a clean sheep. But there is
  nothing particularly Lollardish about saying that; thousands of Catholics
  have said it in every age and are saying it now. It is worthy of remark,
  perhaps, that Chaucer's very strictures on clerics are rather clerical than
  anti-clerical. That is, they are based on the notion that the priest is not
  merely bad when he ought to be good, but bad because he ought to be better.
  In the same passage he uses another figure of speech, which is even more
  conclusive. 'If gold rust, what shall iron do?' He never doubted that the
  priest, as a priest, had received something as precious as gold in comparison
  to iron. But, the ultimate test is even more practical. The question is, even
  if Chaucer was anti-clerical, would he have allowed it to make him
  anti-Catholic? Would he have left the Church for the love of a grievance?
  There is not, and never has been, the shadow of a reason to think so.</p>

  <p>For the rest, he was unquestionably and even passionately devoted to the
  particular parts of Catholicism that have been most condemned by
  Protestantism. He had a devotion to Our Lady perhaps greater than that of
  Dante; as great as that of St. Bernard in his great oration in Dante. The
  poem significantly called his A B C, as if it were the first elements of his
  childlike faith, contains language that goes almost beyond the doctrinal
  limit in attributing omnipotence and supremacy to Mary. In short, there is no
  reason for saying that Chaucer was a Lollard; but there is overwhelming
  reason for saying that he was not a Protestant.</p>

  <p>Modern critics have congratulated Chaucer, or congratulated themselves, on
  the fact that he was so enlightened a reformer as to satirize the Monk and
  the Friar. Curiously enough, they have neglected to notice what he satirized
  them for. Rather simple things of this sort do often get overlooked. And the
  simple truth is that Chaucer satirizes the Monk for not being sufficiently
  Monastic. He may have been right or wrong; but it is certain that if he was
  right, the Reformers of the Reformation were wrong; and only on the
  assumption that they were wrong can we pretend that he was in any sense
  right. The point is rather practical; because nearly all studies of this
  period are full of the suggestion that Chaucer, like his contemporary
  Wycliffe, was a sort of morning star of the Reformation. We can only answer
  that in that case he was an eccentric star who wanted the sun to move
  backwards instead of forwards. In the whole of his satirical sketch of the
  Monk, the point is, not that the Monk is sunk in monkish superstitions, but
  simply that the Monk is not monkish enough. Protestantism, as it ultimately
  developed, professed to free monks and nuns from the prison of the cloister.
  It welcomed runaway monks and nuns to the freedom of the secular world; even
  when their conduct was rather alarmingly free and somewhat startlingly
  secular. But all Chaucer's denunciation is directed, not so much at a monk,
  as at a runaway monk; and that not because he is a monk but because he is a
  runaway. He jeers at him for coming out of the cloister and partaking of the
  pleasures of the world. He jeers at him indeed in his own jovial and even
  genial fashion; making up an imaginary defence for the monk, which is full of
  a hearty hatred of work and the bother of reading books. Why, he asks, should
  the jolly fellow do any work at all? Why should he work with his hands,
  because St. Augustine believed in the Dignity of Labour? Let St. Augustine
  work, if he wants to. But this breezy outburst certainly cannot be taken
  seriously as an attack on monasticism, unless it is to be taken seriously as
  an attack on manual labour, or labour of any sort. There are doubtless modern
  critics who are capable of taking that or anything else seriously. To those
  troubled in spirit by the divine disturbance of humour, it will be obvious
  that Chaucer is simply chaffing a monk for his cheek in not being a monk at
  all. The whole of this passage, taken in an historical and social sense, is
  simply a protest against the decline of monastic discipline. It is like a
  patriotic protest against the decline of military discipline. Such a protest
  would very probably contain an ironical congratulation, on the lines of 'He
  who fights and runs away will live to fight another day'. But it is scarcely
  the sort of congratulation that any soldier would be flattered to receive.
  The fact is that the man who said this sort of thing was the flat contrary of
  a modern opponent of asceticism. Neither Chaucer, nor anybody who really
  counted in Chaucer's day, ever dreamed of complaining that monks were monks.
  They only complained, as Chaucer did, because the monks were not monks.</p>

  <p>Chaucer, of course, took for granted the whole Catholic theory about the
  normal vocation of Marriage and the exceptional vocation of Virginity. He
  explains it all, in strictly orthodox theological terms; though in one place
  he puts it, with a twist of his quaint humour, into the mouth of the Wife of
  Bath. She is the lady who has buried four husbands and explains that, on the
  whole, Virginity is not her vocation. Here again, if this were a joke against
  anything, it would not be a joke against the Virgin but against the Wife; or
  at any rate against the Wife of Bath. Indeed, anyone superficially acquainted
  with medieval culture and the Chaucerian origins will know that the latter is
  the more likely of the two. He will know that while such a satirist was ready
  to satirize both unmarried and married people, he was rather more ready to
  satirize the married than the unmarried. The references to Theophrastus and
  his clerical copyists make that clear enough. But he will also know, what is
  the most important point of all, that whenever the satirist became a serious
  writer, he accepted quite as naturally the status of the officially unmarried
  as that of the officially married. He no more dreamed of suggesting that
  there ought to be no Monasticism than that there ought to be no Marriage. He
  was bred in the bone and blood of a whole living society, of which one was as
  much an organic part as the other. He might, like many another medieval
  writer, deal rather scandalously with the scandal of monks or nuns who broke
  their vows. He would never, like a modern writer, think it scandalous that
  they kept their vows.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Chaucer deals even with the former scandal less
  scandalously than most of his great contemporaries. It is a point of some
  importance, as marking not only the more genial and less militant temper of
  the English poet and the English people, but as illustrating the point that
  England was really less anti-clerical than Europe. The English people were
  the most remote from heresy, when the English rulers were the most near to
  schism. But there was also an amiable element, not only national but
  personal. It is suggested, somewhat plausibly I think, that the extremely
  abrupt introduction of the Second Nun, followed by her equally abrupt
  dismissal without any description, and with only the mysterious addition of
  Three Priests (who never appear again and have no stories to contribute), is
  really a badly botched excision and join, to cover the fact that Chaucer
  originally wrote something about the Second Nun which he decided not to
  publish. Nor, I think, need such an act of prudence have been merely
  prudential. If Chaucer had ever let his mind run along lines of such licence
  as did Boccaccio, in suggesting the immorality of nuns, I do honestly believe
  that Chaucer himself would have been ashamed of it. For that matter, it is
  true that Boccaccio himself ultimately repented of it. But there was in
  Chaucer from the first something quite different from the hard scorn and hot
  repentance of the Italian. It was something which, in the legend of Robin
  Hood, went along with the same English devotion to the Blessed Virgin; so
  that it was said that the outlaw 'would never hurt a company that any woman
  was in'. Chaucer merely as a man (if I understand anything at all of the man)
  would always have felt that he might say things about monks that he must not
  say about nuns; in which one other English Catholic may be permitted to agree
  with him.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, whether we take the test of the cult of Mary, or of the code of
  Monasticism, or of any other recognized mark for modern criticism, it is
  perfectly obvious that Geoffrey Chaucer was an ordinary orthodox medieval
  Catholic and never dreamed of being anything else. Nor did he ever dream that
  he was likely to lose that status (to all who held it the most vital thing in
  life and death) by making fun of fat friars or monks who went hunting instead
  of working with their hands. But those who, reading history backwards, look
  for the later type called the Protestant in a medieval man who was not even a
  Lollard, may find in every sense a more final answer in the final pages of
  the great poem. It may be suspected that few of them have read as far as
  those final pages; still less had the heroic tenacity to read through them.
  Everybody knows the joke about Lord Macaulay; who said of Spenser that few of
  his readers were in at the death of the Blatant Beast; thereby proving that
  Macaulay at least was not one of the few, or he would have found out that the
  Blatant Beast does not die after all. Something of the same doubt affects the
  case of those to whom Chaucer's religion seems not only a simple matter, but
  merely a religion of simplicity.</p>

  <p>They are naturally attached to the beautiful description of the Parson,
  which sounds in many ways very simple, and which occurs at the beginning of
  <i>The Tales</i> and is therefore easily skimmed even by the superficial.
  They remark very truly that Chaucer, for some reason or other, evidently
  preferred the parish priests to the monks and friars; though I know not why
  there should be supposed to be something vaguely Protestant about preferring
  one set of Catholic priests to another. There is certainly nothing very
  Protestant about taking it for granted that one medieval Catholic must have
  been right in his preferences. Nevertheless, those who imagine that Jesus
  Christ and the Gospels were first discovered by Martin Luther, and are never
  mentioned among Catholics, have hinted in a hundred ways that the mention of
  these things in the first description of the Parson shows him to be a good
  hearty Protestant Parson, with Muscular Christianity and Morning Service at
  eleven o'clock. May I inflict on such readers the somewhat heavy medieval
  penance of reading what is (very deceptively) called 'The Parson's Tale',
  with which Chaucer deliberately winds up the whole series of tales? It is in
  fact simply a sermon, and if ever there was a medieval sermon, in the whole
  range of the Middle Ages, it is that of the simple Parson of Chaucer. It is
  arranged in the formal and almost decorative scheme of the Seven Deadly Sins,
  each division having equally formal and doctrinal sub-divisions; and each
  division and sub-division stating with minute accuracy the exact and distinct
  Roman Catholic doctrine, as it is to this day. There is the need of
  Confession to a priest, the distinction between mortal and venial sin, and
  all the rest. There are a hundred points on which it agrees with itself then
  and now, and differs from everybody else then and now. It is appallingly long
  and elaborate, but it does not trip on a single term; and there is written
  all over it in large letters Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur. For those who
  believe in the change of morals or the innovations of science, it may be
  amusing to note that the simple Parson indulges in a ferocious, and somewhat
  ruthlessly realistic, outburst against Birth-Control.</p>

  <p>There is one point in this connexion that should be made clear. Nobody
  understands the nature of man, the nature of medieval man, or above all the
  nature of the medieval man named Geoffrey Chaucer, who imagines that this
  sort of long explanation is necessarily a bore. At any rate, it is not
  necessarily a bore to the writer, even if it is for the reader. All healthy
  and vigorous minds have great pleasure in explaining anything; and especially
  in explaining a system. There were so many systems in the Middle Ages,
  ranging from the gravest to the most trivial matters, from hagiology to
  heraldry, from the rules of faith to the rules of falconry, from the
  calculation of planets to the language of colours, that the general effect on
  the modern mind is that of a complicated and bewildering pattern. But almost
  all the men expounding these things took a palpable and even passionate
  pleasure in the pattern. This was not less, but rather more the case when it
  was a doctrinal or dogmatic pattern. Chaucer has a huge appetite for
  theological and ethical explanations; he will often turn aside for them in
  the most casual and incongruous context. It is thoroughly typical of him that
  he makes the Wife of Bath pour out a torrent of turbulent, gross and
  egotistical discourse, as coarse as a fishwife's and as personal as a Margate
  landlady's; and yet feels it perfectly natural that she should pause to
  explain the correct Catholic doctrine about Virginity and Counsels of
  Perfection. It was perfectly natural. It would not only have been perfectly
  natural to Chaucer. It would probably have been perfectly natural to the Wife
  of Bath. Here and there, even in modern England, we may find the remnants of
  that ancient relish, when some tavern talker expounds heavily the whole case
  for atheism or the Anglo-Israelite theory or the proofs from Apocalypse that
  the Kaiser was the Beast. But if we wish to find the tradition more truly and
  directly descended from the Middle Ages, and until lately really moving a
  whole people as it did in the Middle Ages, we must go, strangely enough, to
  the Puritans of Scotland. There was found the true medieval passion for logic
  and the long exposition of a system. The Scot in Stevenson's stories, who
  'sits with relish' under a thunderous but entirely theoretical theologian&mdash;he
  had preserved one thread, though only a thin black thread, out of the woven
  tapestry of the Middle Ages. In that sense, so far as this island was
  concerned, the Calvinists were the last Catholics.</p>

  <p>It is the paradox, but the truth of the matter, that what may be called
  the dullness of medievalism came from the excitement of medievalism. The
  vigour and vivacious interest required to follow those interminable
  arguments, or interminable allegories, were the virtues of a young and virile
  humanity. An eagerness more inexhaustible than that of a child was needed to
  carry readers breathlessly through the endless decorative forest of <i>The
  Romance of the Rose</i>. It is a truth of psychology that needs a fuller
  exposition; for no psychologist has yet written a very necessary book called
  'A Defence of Bores'. Perhaps it is the bored rather than the bore that needs
  defence, but it is true that the bored is the weaker of the two. It is the
  bore who is joyous and triumphant; the true conqueror of the earth. Or, to
  put the matter less flippantly, it is true that a living and logical gusto
  for giving long explanations of everything, though it may be an infliction on
  the sensitive, is itself an attribute of the strong. To anyone who knows what
  logic is, the sustained lucidity and consistency of the Parson's Tale is
  itself sufficient proof that writing it was, for Chaucer, not merely a moral
  toil, but an intellectual joy. A modern man is quite entitled to say that joy
  in writing it is one thing and joy in reading it quite another. But the
  medieval man may have been the more joyful of the two.</p>

  <p>In another sense, of course, the question of Chaucer's religion rises into
  a region that is far above all this controversy. I have already mentioned
  certain fragments from his religious poems, which are like flashes of this
  more serene and enduring light. But if we are to realize what a man like
  Chaucer meant by that light, and how and why it differed from daylight (the
  daylight which he of all men loved as he loved the daisy), we must cast back
  and consider some more general principles which are the explanations of his
  attitude; not only because they were universally understood as the basis of
  medieval thought, but because they are almost universally misunderstood in
  the outlook of modern thought. The poet never mentioned them because he
  started with them, and the critics never mentioned them because they have not
  reached them as yet.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the largest fact about the Middle Ages is that two forces worked
  and to some extent warred in that time. One was that mystical vision, or
  whatever we call it, which Catholics call The Faith; the other was the
  prodigious prestige of Pagan Antiquity. Neo-Pagans of the Swinburnian
  interlude imagined that Paganism stood merely for light and liberty, and
  Catholicism merely for superstition and slavery. But the case was much more
  complex upon any reading. Some superstitions, such as Astrology, still
  imposed themselves although they were Pagan; or rather <i>because</i> they
  were Pagan. They seemed to be classic, like Aristotle and Virgil. It is
  amusing to read the medieval Catholics on Astrology, and note how much they
  resemble the modern Catholics on Evolution. Both feel <i>first</i> that no
  science must be allowed to deny the dignity and liberty of the human soul;
  but the medievals have the same vague respect for all that is labelled
  Antiquity that we have for all that is labelled Science. Or again, in the
  matter of liberty, the mere instinctive growth of a Catholic peasantry had
  already loosened the old slavery, when lawyers insisting on the old Roman Law
  tried to revive the definition of the slave. The mystical element had its own
  crimes and cruelties; but the point is that both elements were mixed and that
  the conflict was very complicated. One truth, however, was fairly constant;
  that Pagan and Christian conceptions ran parallel; but the Christian
  <i>above</i> the Pagan.</p>

  <p>It is wholly typical of our time that the old theologians are commonly
  blamed for subtle distinctions; because in our time we tend always to
  superficial resemblances. It is counted the triumph of classification to
  class everything together; that is, the triumph of classification is to say
  there are no classes. Imperialism painting the map red and internationalism
  painting the globe grey are alike in practice; in so far as each will spread
  the paint very thin, if it can only spread it very far. Almost all forms of
  popular science shine chiefly by shallow parallels. For instance, the whole
  business of Comparative Mythology is made up of shallow parallels; that is,
  of superficial resemblances which cover deep and fundamental divisions. I
  have legs and a table has legs; if I am large and round, it is also possible
  for a table to be large and round. Therefore I am the legendary counterpart,
  or possibly the mythical origin, of the Round Table. But if I modestly
  advance this claim, it may occur to some that the differences between a man
  and a table are fundamental; while the resemblances between table-legs and
  merely human legs are superficial; they are in fact almost metaphorical. A
  man is alive and walks about; a table seldom does so, save under the moral
  influence of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. And the abyss between the organic and
  the inorganic is too absolute to be bridged by the figure of speech called a
  wooden leg. So we commonly find in current discussions a pretence of finding
  things roughly similar when they are radically different; as if a man were
  accused of splitting hairs because he obstinately distinguished between
  feathers and ferns.</p>

  <p>Thus there are critics so shallow that they cannot see the quite
  fundamental difference between the Puritanism from which England is emerging
  at the present time and the Asceticism from which England was emerging in the
  time of Chaucer. The difference, or rather the contrast, is clear and sharp;
  and has nothing to do with whether we happen to prefer one or the other. It
  may be maintained that Puritanism is more practical, or even more concerned
  with the present world. It may be reasonably alleged that ascetic mysticism
  was too much concerned with the other world. But the roots are utterly
  distinct; even when there is in both a renunciation of the things of this
  world in the name of the other world. And the difference is this; that the
  older ascetic saw heaven as very bright, and this world as dark in
  comparison. But the later Puritan saw heaven itself as dark, in the sense of
  stern and rather stormy; and his genuine imagination exulted in the storm.
  For him the Lord was in the thunder, much more than in the still small voice;
  and he was thus at the opposite extreme to even the most extreme ascetic, or
  excessive ascetic, who wished the sound of lutes and viols to cease, so that
  the still small voice might be heard. The point is, however, that the old
  ascetic was looking for joy and beauty, whether we think his vision of joy
  and beauty impossible or merely invisible. But the true Puritan was not
  primarily looking for joy and beauty, but for strength and even violence.
  This can be stated, and for a hundred years has been stated, in a form
  favourable to the Puritan. He has been called the stalwart and virile
  Puritan; he is always very much gratified to be called the grim and rugged
  Puritan. The other religious ideal can as easily be stated in an unfavourable
  form; suggesting a sentimental and childish attraction to bright colours or
  costly trinkets. I am not at all concerned with the favourable or
  unfavourable comments here. But, favourable or unfavourable, they point to a
  clean-cut contrast between the two things. There is such a contrast between
  those things; which is why so many modern writers describe them as the
  same.</p>

  <p>The contrast instantly appears in black and white, when the two creeds
  express themselves in externals. When once the ascetic was assured that
  certain things were dedicated to divine things, he wanted them to be
  exceptionally brilliant and gorgeous things. He wanted the vestments of the
  priest to run through all the colours of the rainbow or the marbles of the
  shrine to mimic all the sunsets of the world. The Puritan insisted that the
  preacher should wear a black Geneva gown, instead of any coloured vestment,
  and that the chapel should be a shed or barn and not a temple shining with
  marbles; and he was consistent with his fundamental conception. He was not
  merely stern towards other people's religion or irreligion. He was stern
  towards his own religion; and was most stern where he was most religious. In
  his religious picture even the high light was a hard light; the sort of harsh
  and hueless light that can be seen in the black engravings in the old Family
  Bibles. It was not a question of preferring light to darkness; it was a
  question of preferring a colourless light to a coloured light. It was not a
  question of flowers or beautiful raiment, conceived as a vision of heaven
  rather than of earth; it was a question of being on the side of the storm
  against the flower or of the stark bones against the garment. As I say, it
  can be described as a sublime exultation in strength and severity; appealing
  to sturdy races or to strict family traditions. It can also be described (so
  far as I am concerned) as a return to heathenism and a howling to the gods of
  fear. But it is a fact of history, which still plays a part even in politics;
  that certain people were proud, not of being stern to this or that
  indulgence; but simply proud of being stern.</p>

  <p>Now this note is <i>never</i> found in medieval asceticism. Nobody can
  imagine St. Thomas Aquinas saying, 'I am a grand grim old Dominican, who
  stands no nonsense; we are a rugged stock, scorning the pleasures of the
  world.' Nobody can conceive St. Bernard boasting, 'We Burgundians are a
  harsh, hardy race and like the thunder in our hills more than the pretty
  flowers of a garden paradise.' These men may have dwelt too much on the
  supernatural as compared to the natural, according to our own views upon such
  matters; but they thought the supernatural more beautiful than the natural;
  not merely more naked or elemental or terrible. M. Reinach, a learned Jew who
  has an artistic admiration for medievalism certainly quite untinged with
  Catholicism, has very truly pointed out that the purely medieval artists
  always represented heavenly beings as gay and happy, and attributed sorrow
  only to the lost. The insistence even on the Man of Sorrows and the Mater
  Dolorosa, in artistic expression, belongs to a time after the medieval. It
  was in the seventeenth century that the two more sombre religious moods
  appeared in the two religions. In the Catholic world it became in some sense
  a worship of sorrow; in the Puritan world a worship of severity, and in some
  cases of savagery. The point here, however, is that we cannot understand
  medieval men, even the most extreme or extravagant ascetics, unless we
  understand that to them the contrast was quite clear between the cross and
  the crown; between the harsh and angular timber of the cross and the coloured
  jewels of the crown. A man like Fra Angelico might live a very plain life;
  but he did not imagine paradise as a penny plain, but very decidedly as
  twopence coloured. A man like John Knox prided himself on being plain even in
  his religious conceptions; some might say flippantly that he was too much of
  a Scot to spare the twopence. From him descends a sort of pride in rudeness,
  growing more self-conscious with later times; but unknown even to the rudest
  people in older times. We may think that the earlier saints tried to be saved
  by an excess of humility; but nobody tried to be admired for an excess of
  hardness. They did not even excuse themselves for being hard-hearted by
  calling themselves hard-headed. As a rule, they did not call themselves
  anything, except miserable sinners.</p>

  <p>This is a good example of the subtle contrasts of history; the contrasts
  which a shallow person will probably see as resemblances. It is much easier
  to see that Buddhism and Byzantine Christianity both have images or incense
  or gilded shrines, than to see that their fundamental theories flatly
  contradict each other. It is much easier to say that Pelagians and Puritans
  both quarrelled with bishops than to state lucidly their two separate
  beliefs, which were at opposite extremes of belief. The Lollards of the
  fifteenth century were in many ways the very reverse of the Lutherans of the
  sixteenth century. Yet it is found convenient to class them together, because
  it is now found convenient to class nearly everything and anything together,
  in a generalization which is obviously sweeping and certainly
  superficial.</p>

  <p>When we have thus firmly grasped that medievalism had a heavenly vision
  (or illusion) of which the colours were intrinsically beautiful and even gay,
  we can then follow correctly the curious and interesting process by which the
  rest of the environment grew somewhat gayer. In other words, the next phase
  is that in which men like the Troubadours and the Italian poets, and in the
  present case the English poets, began to give gayer expression to their
  pleasure in the pagan poets; especially in Ovid. Now this pagan prestige
  covered, to a great extent, the pranks of the poets; and yet it produced a
  duality in the medieval mind which often puzzles the modern mind. It is not
  that the later medieval man is torn, like Tannhauser, between Venus and the
  Virgin. He often seems, like Chaucer and Petrarch, to be able to turn with
  comparative lightness and innocence from the subject of Venus to that of the
  Virgin. But we shall completely misunderstand him, if we think that his
  levity means that they are too sympathetic or similar to be contrasted. On
  the contrary, his levity means that they are too unequal to be compared.
  There still remains the same contrast between this world and the other, even
  when this world has allowed itself to grow more worldly. There still remains
  the contrast between the cross and the crown, even when the cross has been
  moulded in gold, and jewelled more than all royal crowns.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it might be pictured somewhat thus; that for a medieval man, his
  Paganism was like a wall and his Catholicism was like a window. No
  discussions of degree or relativity can get over the difference between a
  wall and a window. It is more even than a difference of dimension or of
  plane; it is very near to one of negative and positive. Anyhow, just as a
  very white sheet of paper looks black if held up against the sun, so any wall
  looks dark against any window. It may be a whitewashed wall, but it will not
  be as white as the dullest daylight. Now in the early days of medievalism,
  the wall of the world really was rather grey and grim. There was, as Mr.
  Belloc has said, something stark about the very strength of the first
  medieval structure of secular society. The wall was, let us say, of the cold
  colour of earth, and only the window had the colours of heaven. As medieval
  civilization progressed, and for a time it progressed very rapidly and well,
  the wall of this world was painted in brighter colours. When men like
  Petrarch and Chaucer were almost within sight of the Renaissance, they
  painted the wall with gorgeous designs in gold and scarlet. They did not
  hesitate to paint it with highly Pagan designs of gods and nymphs. Considered
  as mural illuminations, these things were very illuminating. Contrasted with
  the dull stone of the Dark Ages, they were very bright. But, contrasted with
  the window, they were still dark.</p>

  <p>It never really crossed the mind of any typical man of the Middle Ages, or
  for that matter of any typical man of the Renaissance, that the lightness of
  his mural decoration could approach anywhere near to the light from heaven.
  They were still divided by that abstract abyss between a window and a wall,
  which is like the chasm between light and darkness. If the window were
  curtained, if the wall were considered in itself, by artificial light, he
  would go almost any lengths in the enjoyment of its glitter or gaiety of
  colour; not to mention its sometimes rather excessive gaiety of subject. But
  he did not make it a rival to reality or the daylight. The moment he put the
  two into competition, he treated the lesser with contempt. For instance, some
  of the best Chaucerian authorities profoundly doubt, and I as an amateur,
  ignorant of all but human experience, also profoundly doubt, the authenticity
  of that queer postscript to <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, expressing regret
  for all literary vanities except some poems of religion. It seems an unlikely
  sort of ending to any work; especially to a work that was not in fact
  ended.</p>

  <p>But if it were authentic, I could understand it better than men who are
  better scholars than I. Even if Chaucer wrote it, it would not mean what a
  modern poet would mean by being ashamed of his poems. It would not mean that
  they were something specially bad on their own plane: it would mean that they were
  nothing on his ultimate plane: the plane of death and eternity. If this is
  inconsistent, his admitted works are inconsistent. Venus and Cupid dance in
  and out of his long love-poems on a principle of unfailing recurrence. They
  are a burden in the sense of a refrain; before the end, I fear, they are a
  burden in the sense of a bore. Of the many minor trades that Chaucer seems to
  be practising before us, perhaps the one he enjoys most is that of an
  architect of heathen temples. He never used better his beautiful sense of
  design than when fitting up those shrines with the ivory statue of Venus or
  the red metal of Mars. Troilus, the heroic lover, is necessarily in perpetual
  relation to the god and goddess of love, and many might read whole pages of
  such a poem and suppose it to be a translation from Ovid or Theocritus.</p>

  <p>But when Troilus was actually dead and done with, the poet suddenly turned
  and spat all these things out of his mouth, as the saint spat the cold
  temples of Laodicea. He treats all his graceful gods and goddesses exactly as
  'the damned crew' which the Puritan Milton hurled howling from all their
  hollow fanes.</p>

  <p class="verse">Lo, here of pagans' cursed olden rites,<br>
  Lo, here what all their high gods might avail,<br>
  Lo, here this wretched worldës appetites,<br>
  Lo, here the end and guerdon of travail,<br>
  Of Jove, Apollo, of Mars and such rascaille...</p>

  <p>...or (if we may modernize the language further) of all such rascals. That
  is what the serious Chaucer said of the serious Paganism. That is what he
  thought of the painted pictures on the wall, when there was talk of their
  blocking up the window.</p>

  <p>To most modern people, with their notions drawn from the nineteenth
  century rather than the twentieth, this will seem an inconsistency, and in a
  sense it is indeed a complexity. But it is a complexity essential to the
  understanding of what they would call the simplicity of the Middle Ages, and
  especially the simplicity of 'Dan Chaucer'. There are perhaps three elements
  in it; one concerned with his time, one with his creed, and a third very
  specially with himself. The first was a general character of medieval
  philosophy, especially Thomist philosophy, if we compare it with the real
  rival philosophies of the world; with the Buddhist philosophy or the
  Calvinist philosophy or the Positivist philosophy. It is the main mark of St.
  Thomas Aquinas, for instance, as compared with the few sages who are as
  great. He does lift Faith above Reason; but does not lower Reason. He does
  put the supernatural higher than the natural; but does not lower the natural.
  He says that the lower thing is in every sense worthy; except that compared
  with the higher it is worthless. This led to a habit of thinking on two
  levels, or even on three. It was like the medieval theatres which sometimes
  had three stages, one above the other; so, in the poetry influenced by this
  philosophy, there was the lower stage in which the heathen gods were high,
  and the higher stage in which they were low. Secondly it was connected with a
  character in Catholic morality as distinct from Protestant morality. I do not
  wish to state the contrast controversially, for it is easy to state it
  favourably or unfavourably to either side. But the point of Protestantism was
  that it wiped out <i>all</i> a man's sins at once, as if they were all
  equally sinful. <i>All</i> Christian's burden fell from him before the Cross.
  He did not have to unpack his own luggage in the confessional-box. But
  Catholicism always tended more to a table of sins, as of different weights
  and measures, and a real sense that while all are positively heavy, some are
  relatively light. This accounts for the very varying laxity of medieval and
  other writers about lighter things. Even when they thought the lover was a
  sinner, they never thought he was so great a sinner as the traitor. They
  might have thought Lancelot infinitely inferior to Galahad; but they also
  thought Modred infinitely inferior to Lancelot. We see these shifting and
  conflicting crosslights shining or darkening continually on the figure of
  Troilus. These matters of medieval philosophy and morality made up much of
  the paradox; but there was a third part of it that was not entirely of any
  period or system, but came out of the character of Geoffrey Chaucer.</p>

  <p>If there is one feature that stands out, we might say sticks out, from the
  literary personality of Chaucer, it is a curious sort of hilarious
  half-ironical welcome to people more cynical than himself. He has an
  impulsive movement to applaud what he does not approve. It is as if their
  impudence gave him so much pleasure, that he could not withhold a sort of
  affection based on gratitude. We all remember the extraordinary virtues
  attributed to the Summoner:</p>

  <p class="verse">He was a gentle harlot and a kind,<br>
  A better fellow could men nowhere find:<br>
  For he would suffer for a quart of wine<br>
  A good fellow to have his concubine<br>
  A twelve-month, and excuse him at the full.</p>

  <p>Fastidious readers have formed the impression that Chaucer's Summoner must
  have been about as objectionable a person to go on a pilgrimage with as
  anybody in the world, even the Miller; yet Chaucer cannot contain himself for
  gladness at the thought of such sociable eccentricities. His attitude towards
  the Shipman is more sympathetic than that of Stevenson towards a pirate. And
  indeed, so far as I can make out, the Shipman was, among other things, a
  pirate. But Chaucer is not to be shaken out of his geniality by trifles like
  that.</p>

  <p class="verse">And certainly he was a good felawe<br>
  Full many a draught of wine would he draw<br>
  From Bordeaux Ward, while the chapmen sleep;<br>
  Of nice conscience took he no keep.<br>
  If that he fought, and had the higher hand,<br>
  By water he sent them home to every land.</p>

  <p>which is said to be a polite way of saying that he made them walk the
  plank. But while Chaucer is on this level of artistic amusement, a little
  murder does not trouble him. Yet there were some murders that troubled him
  very much indeed. When he was once on the higher level, of considering the
  sufferings of the murdered, and facing the serious question of whether murder
  is morally advisable, he was rather specially a pathetic, rather than a stoic
  moralist. It would be hard to count the number of times he repeats the
  piteousness of the death of this or that person unjustly slain, as in the
  piercing lines about the boy martyr in the Tale of the Prioress. But he had
  set up, as part of the structure of his own mind, a sort of lower and larger
  stage, for all mankind, in which anything could happen without seriously
  hurting anybody; and an upper stage which he kept almost deliberately
  separate, on which walked the angels of the justice and the mercy and the
  omniscience of God. This was a sort of cosmic complexity, which was supported
  by the dual standpoint of his morality and philosophy, but which belonged in
  any case to his individual temperament. It was a temperament especially
  English; but it is not quite fair to infer, in the usual fashion, that it was
  therefore merely illogical. At bottom, it was no more illogical than the
  three dimensions are illogical. It depended on whether he was thinking along
  one line; or in the flat, as in broad farce; or of the solid images of
  virtue.</p>

  <p>Chaucer did not hate the world; he did not undervalue it or despise it; he
  only distrusted it, as a mellowed and matured old gentleman might distrust a
  bridge made by larky little boys. His sense of the vanity of earthly fortune
  and success was the recognition of a fact; not the insurgent rise of a
  feeling. He did not particularly dislike fate or dislike fortune, any more
  than he disliked the Shipman or the Wife of Bath; he was simply aware of what
  they were really made of. In this unruffled and radiant receptivity, he is
  rather unique among poets, and even among great men. Perhaps it would be true
  to say that he had the power of liking people whom he did not respect; and
  that he extended this sentiment to the Goddess of Fortune and even to the
  Three Fates. His Christianity warmed and deepened whatever in this was Stoic,
  nay, whatever in this was Epicurean; but it is the whole point that his creed
  and culture had digested the dead philosophies; that is, brought them to life
  in a living organism. But his spiritual sanity showed itself most in this
  variety of emphasis or pressure; in being able to take at once his heathenism
  so lightly and his Christianity so weightily; in treating the gods and the
  grim fates as trifles, and the little relics and holy tokens as if they were
  larger things.</p>

  <p>Thus the personal humour of Chaucer is an indirect, and perhaps distorted,
  derivative of the moral mood of his age and creed. It had bad by-products and
  good by-products; and Chaucer's wit was one of the best. But they ramified
  back to that double root in the rationalism and super-rationalism of the
  medieval moral philosophy. In short, Geoffrey Chaucer was exactly what 'the
  gentle Pardoner' was not&mdash;he was a gentle Pardoner. But we shall
  misunderstand all the men of that curious and rather complex society, if we
  do not realize that in a sense their eccentricities were connected with the
  same centre. The official venality of the bad Pardoner, and the very
  unofficial amiability of the good Pardoner, both came from the peculiar
  temptations and difficult diplomacies of the same religious system. They came
  because it was not, in the Puritan sense, a simple system. It was accustomed,
  even in minds much more serious than Chaucer's, to seeing (so to speak) two
  sides of a sin; to seeing it, now as awful and appalling merely because it
  was a sin; now as a venial sin utterly and unutterably different in its
  ultimate direction from a mortal sin. It was out of the abuse of distinctions
  of that kind that the distortions and corruptions appeared, which are made
  vivid in the flagrant figure of the Pardoner; the practice of Indulgences
  which had degenerated from the theory of Indulgences. But it was out of the
  use of distinctions of that kind that a man like Chaucer had originally
  reached the sort of balanced and delicate habit of mind, the habit of looking
  at all sides of the same thing; the power to realize that even an evil has a
  right to its own place in the hierarchy of evils, to realize, at least, that
  in the abysmal relativities of Hell and Purgatory, there are even things more
  unpardonable than the Pardoner.</p>

  <p>In any case, this attitude is directly connected with the reality of his
  religion. Chaucer was more unmistakably orthodox than Langland; not because
  Chaucer was more superficial, but because he was more fundamental. Langland
  was troubled about many things, though most of them were worthy things;
  social order and moral discipline and the economics and ethics sharply needed
  in his time. But Chaucer had the one thing needful; he had the frame of mind
  that is the ultimate result of right reason and a universal philosophy; the
  temper that is the flower and fruit of all the tillage and the toil of
  moralists and theologians. He had Charity; that is the heart and not merely
  the mind of our ancient Christendom; and between the black robes of Gower and
  the grey gown of Langland, he stands clothed in scarlet like all the
  household of love; and emblazoned with the Sacred Heart.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9"></a><small>CHAPTER IX</small><br>
  The Moral of the Story</h2>

  <p class="first">Those strangely fanatical historians, who would darken the
  whole medieval landscape, have to give up Chaucer in despair; because he is
  obviously not despairing. His mere voice hailing us from a distance has the
  abruptness of a startling whistle or halloo; a blast blowing away all their
  artificially concocted atmosphere of gas and gloom. It is as if we opened the
  door of an ogre's oven, in which we were told that everybody was being
  roasted alive, and heard a clear, cheery but educated voice remarking that it
  was a fine day. It is manifestly and mortally impossible that anybody should
  write or think as Geoffrey Chaucer wrote and thought, in a world so narrow
  and insane as that which the anti-medievalists laboriously describe. They
  have no chance, on their own theory and argument, of answering that Chaucer
  was cheerful because he happened to be lucky in some ways, though unlucky in
  others; and certainly lived among the rich, though himself, at certain
  periods, decidedly poor. The whole point of Chaucer is in the fact that he
  does not retire with lords and ladies, like Boccaccio, to tell his tales. He
  is enjoying not the walled garden but the world. The world he is enjoying is
  just as much the world of the Ploughman and the Cook as of the Prioress and
  the Squire. Moreover, it is vital to the hostile contention that even
  emperors and princes could be crushed under superstitions that paralysed them
  like nightmares; and that to all men even the promise of heaven was only the
  threat of hell. And it is a stark staring fact, of everyday psychology, that
  a man like Chaucer could not have lived in a world like that. We are placed
  in a dilemma; but the horns are hardly of equal length. We know that Chaucer
  did live in the fourteenth century; we cannot be so certain of estimates
  formed in the twentieth century&mdash;or (as a matter of fact) surviving out of
  the nineteenth century. We know that Chaucer did live; and we are by no means
  so certain that the modern historians are alive.</p>

  <p>In this chapter I would advance a certain general proposition, which I
  know will be called a paradox. We know the thousand things in Chaucer that
  converge to make it inconceivable that he should have walked about alive in a
  merely barbarous or bigoted or benighted epoch. We know, to mention one thing
  out of the thousand, the gentleness of his controversial manner; the way in
  which he feels confident that a light touch will tell; his assumption that
  his companions, gentle and simple, will understand each other. We know that
  men do not write like that, in an age when nobody could understand them. We
  know his bottomless bonhomie and good temper; as of one who had certainly
  never been tortured to exasperation by an alien world. We know his levity;
  the way in which he can flit from flower to flower even in the garden of
  heathenism; obviously without any pressing panic about the possibilities of
  heresy. We know his soaring hilarity and high spirits; never stronger than in
  his old age and comparative poverty, when he began to sing of the April day
  when men took the road of Kent to Canterbury. We know that this did not come
  out of a dark and twisted superstition or a debased social slavery; and it
  only remains for us to ask what it did come from.</p>

  <p>Now I will here advance the thesis that this cheerfulness or sanity came
  from theology. I say deliberately, not religion, but theology. It was not
  <i>his</i> theology: it was the theology at the back of the philosophy at the
  back of his mind. So far as a general religious sentiment goes, that might
  indeed have given him moods of thankfulness; but it would also have given him
  moods of melancholy. In so far as he was romantic (and he was); in so far as
  he was sometimes sentimental (and he was) he would often have become that
  sick and smitten lover so common in medieval romances. In all that medieval
  province there was something of Botticelli; even something of Burne-Jones.
  Nothing is more typical of that time than the fact that its very real valour
  and virility were nevertheless covered with a veil of merely poetical
  sentiment, which strikes us as rather affected and lackadaisical; like the
  iron armour of a knight covered by some embroidered vestment with figured
  patterns of broken lilies or heart-broken ladies. All the literature of that
  time is loud with Complaints of Lovers and Confessions of Love; and there is
  a sense in which men like Chaucer did make of it a religion as well as a
  romance. For instance, we have seen that Chaucer, with very Chaucerian
  freshness (almost in the slang sense of impudence), calls his collection of
  Pagan ladies, like Dido or Cleopatra, by the title of 'Cupid's Lives of the
  Saints', or 'The <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> of Cupid'. Romance was a religion;
  certainly it was all that the modern Romantics mean by a religion. It was
  even rather more respectable than some of the modern developments that owe
  their inspiration to Byron or George Sand. It demanded very real virtues;
  fidelity to the death; patience even in despair; courtesy even in combat. Now
  if Love had really been a religion to Chaucer and Petrarch, even in the sense
  in which it was to some extent a religion to Keats or Rossetti, it might well
  have been in many cases a rather sad religion. Chaucer, however romantic, is
  quite sufficiently realistic to realize that Cupid can be a tyrant or that
  jealousy is cruel as the grave. If this sort of poetic sense of beauty is
  what we mean by religion (and it is what many moderns mean by religion),
  <i>that</i> alone would not have kept Chaucer cheerful. It was his real
  religion that kept him cheerful. Perhaps it will seem less paradoxical, if I
  point out that it is exactly parallel to the example of the greatest of
  Chaucer's contemporaries. You will find precisely that religion of lovers in
  Dante's <i>Vita Nuova</i>; and in <i>that</i>, therefore, Beatrice fades away
  like a fancy and leaves the poet sad. It is only when Beatrice reappears as a
  Theological Virtue in the <i>Paradiso</i>, that things begin to brighten up a
  bit. They were so paradoxical that they thought brightness came from the
  sky.</p>

  <p>The real trouble of the Middle Ages lay in their rudimentary and
  relatively bad communications for the handing on of their good things; not in
  the least in their not having the good things to communicate. We are in a
  position to appreciate the distinction at the present moment; when we have
  very good communications and nothing to communicate. The comparative
  impotence of medievalism to carry out its own plans, whether evil or good,
  can indeed be best tested by comparing their processes with a practical thing
  like a large modern newspaper; that loud and regular organ by which our
  civilization daily proclaims that it has nothing to say. Had it existed in
  the Middle Ages, it might conceivably have made the philosophers more
  popular; it would certainly have made the tyrants more tyrannical. No man in
  the Middle Ages was so rich that he could have sent a herald to every man's
  house every morning, to challenge with trumpet and tabard any other view than
  that which this particular rich man wished to promulgate; yet that is exactly
  the power now possessed by several rich men, much less dignified than any
  rich man in the fourteenth century. No man was rich enough to nail a
  proclamation upon every man's door at dawn, as some are now rich enough to
  place a newspaper upon every man's table at breakfast; in both cases to be
  taken as unanswerable because it is unanswered. It is amusing to speculate
  what would have happened if Caxton had come a century earlier and developed
  all the powers of a few centuries later; and that an engine like the Press
  had been (as of course it would have been, and indeed still is) in the hands
  of the governing class of the day. If the King could have made the same
  statement suddenly and simultaneously to all his subjects, it would doubtless
  have averted many revolutions founded on rumours; nor would this be the less
  effective because the rumours were true and the royal explanation was false.
  Richard the Second could probably have prevented the Peasants' Rising, if he
  could have posted his promise of reform and offer to be a popular leader,
  made in the famous speech at Blackheath, to every cottage and hovel in the
  whole feudal countryside. After that the promise could be broken in due
  course, as it was then and probably would be now; possibly through the same
  agency, the pressure of the plutocrats in Parliament. Similarly, if
  Bolingbroke had been able to send horsemen so swiftly all over England that
  every squire, yeoman or vassal could hear his side of the case and no other,
  if he could have done all that in one day on the very day when he deposed
  Richard the Second, there would probably have been no rising in the North, no
  Battle of Shrewsbury or legend of the return of Richard. It would certainly
  have hugely solidified the position of the usurper; and whether that would
  have been a good thing the reader must be left, on his own general
  principles, to judge. It is enough to note, as one aspect of the rudeness and
  delay of medieval communications, that revolutions could occur in one part of
  the country without the most powerful persons, in another part of the
  country, having even the power to parley with them. And if, on the other
  hand, something happened about which any parley was undesirable, there was
  then no really efficient machinery for keeping the public misinformed on the
  matter.</p>

  <p>But whatever we may think about the halting of political information,
  there is no doubt that the halting of general information was a defect of the
  ruder conditions of medieval life. The information existed, and was in many
  matters very varied and full. Nor was it necessarily regarded as privileged
  information; it was never impossible for a poor man to obtain instruction in
  medieval England as it was impossible for a Negro to obtain it in a great
  part of nineteenth-century America. It was not so much that he was forbidden
  to get it, as that it was physically difficult to get. All books had to be
  laboriously transcribed by hand; the possession of a mass of such manuscripts
  was rare; and they were handed about cautiously, by comparison with all
  modern caution in the lending of books. Even a cultivated man like Chaucer,
  with a comfortable salary, seems frequently to get glimpses of the most
  important books indirectly, or even accidentally. Often he seems never to
  have seen the very books that we should chiefly expect him to see. After
  having been long regarded almost as a mere copyist of the Decameron, he is
  now supposed, by the most recent scholars, never to have seen the Decameron
  at all. But he did see one story out of the Decameron; not as it was written
  in Italian by Boccaccio, but as it was translated into Latin by Petrarch. It
  is possible that he owed even this to the accident of meeting Petrarch.
  Similarly, while he had certainly read Ovid and Virgil, it is thought
  improbable that he had ever seen a manuscript of Livy: though he invokes Livy
  and praises Livy and actually tells a tale out of Livy. Probably he took it
  from somebody who took it from Livy. There is any amount of this indirect,
  distorted and scrappy element in the culture; education by haphazard and
  hearsay. In this sense the opportunities of culture were limited; the
  communications for conveying culture were limited; the machinery for
  popularizing culture was limited.</p>

  <p>But the culture was not limited. The education that was imparted, the
  education that was interrupted, was not limited. The books, that were
  borrowed or copied or translated or mistranslated, were not narrow or limited
  books. They were books which often conveyed, more completely than the
  fashionable books of any other epoch, the idea of an enlarged and enlightened
  philosophy of life; the consideration of both sides of a question; the
  balancing of one consideration against another; the conception of the whole
  sublunary world under the light of reason. Consider only one ordinary
  possibility, which in the case of Chaucer amounts to a probability. Suppose
  at some time some medieval man had only three medieval books. And suppose
  those three were, first, some version of the works 'of Aristotle and his
  philosophy'; second, the Divine Comedy of Dante; and third, the Summa of St.
  Thomas Aquinas. This is not to possess books but to possess worlds. They are
  three universes of thoughts and things; or rather three aspects of the same
  universe; the one positive and rationalist; the other imaginative and
  pictorial; the third moral and mystical, but still inherently logical. A man
  might own a whole Circulating Library of modern novels and minor poets,
  without having anything like such a cosmic conspectus, or complete
  consideration of all sides of the real world. But the vital point to seize,
  in connexion with the particular case of Chaucer, is that the philosophy
  considered as a philosophy, and even the theology considered as a theology,
  was one which aimed at a certain equilibrium, achieved by giving so much
  weight to one thing and so much less or more to another. I know all about the
  harsher side of it, and especially the harsher defence of it, as it affects
  the humanitarians of our own time; that it believed in devils; that it
  defended itself by inquisitors. But that has nothing whatever to do with the
  present point, about the nature of the thing defended. That thing was a
  poised and proportioned thing; thought out and thrashed out by the comparison
  of many thoughts; not a single thing or a simple thing, in the sense of the
  isolation of one thought. And though even a man like Chaucer, through the
  limits of the medieval machinery, received this culture in a rather
  fragmentary way, he received enough of its fragments to be filled with its
  fulness. He was full enough of that fulness not to let his own thought be
  merely fragmentary; in the sense of thinking one fragment of truth as good as
  the whole. Still less did he think, as does the true heretic, that the
  fragment of truth is better than the whole.</p>

  <p>External ecclesiasticism had indeed so far degenerated in Chaucer's day
  that many good and simple people then, like many good and simple people now,
  had begun to cry out for a simpler religion; for a simplified Christianity.
  They had that natural yearning, which always begins with a prayer for a
  single eye and always ends (with painfully exact fulfilment) in winking the
  other eye, in a one-eyed concentration on a single object. Modern historians
  often accept it, even now, as the purest form of idealism; but it always
  means being a man of one idea. It means very precisely fulfilling the
  proverbial phrase about the man 'who has not two ideas in his head'.</p>

  <p>Now the Schoolman always had two ideas in his head; if they were only the
  Yes and No of his own proposition. The Schoolman was not only the
  schoolmaster but also the schoolboy; he examined himself; he cross-examined
  himself; he may be said to have heckled himself for hundreds of pages. Nobody
  can read St. Thomas's theology without hearing all the arguments against St.
  Thomas's theology. Therefore, even when that sort of faith produced what many
  would call ferocity, it always produced what I mean here by fairness; the
  almost involuntary intellectual fairness of one who cannot help knowing that
  the universe is a many-sided thing. That is precisely the temper of Chaucer;
  and that is what I mean when I say that he got his broad-mindedness from his
  theology; though it was not what is now generally meant by a broad theology.
  The essential point is that it was not a simple theology. As I have said,
  many medieval heretics, admired by modern historians, were even then
  beginning to cry out for a simpler theology. In the time of the Lollards, and
  in their particular and painful circumstances, it was often pardonable, and
  certainly ought more often to have been pardoned. In the time of Mr. G. M.
  Trevelyan, which is somewhat later in history, it is more mystifying. One
  would suppose that an able and cultivated man, who has lived to see the
  subdivision and suicide of all the sects, would have had enough of such
  simplifications. But in his interesting book, on the Age of Wycliffe, he
  makes a comparison equally suicidal. He says that his hero proposed, in the
  most sweepingly Protestant manner, to free the parish clergy of all control
  by Popes or Bishops or anybody else; until every parson should be as
  independent as a Presbyterian minister in Scotland. The example is somewhat
  unfortunate. Certainly the creed of Calvinism, which all Scottish ministers
  were forced to teach for two hundred years, was a simple creed. Nothing could
  be simpler than saying that men go to Hell because God made them on purpose
  to send them to Hell. But even of that childlike innocence and simplicity a
  good many people seem to have grown tired at last. Nothing could be simpler
  than the stark negation of the Scottish Sabbath; for nothing can be simpler
  than nothing. Yet even of the childlike Scottish Sabbath, it is sometimes
  said that the children grew a little restless towards the end of the day.
  Their modern descendants certainly grew as restless towards the end of the
  nineteenth century as ever the Lollards did towards the end of the fourteenth
  century. And when among <i>these</i> eighteenth-century Presbyterians there
  arose a Poet, that unfortunate bard was not quite so calm or so contented or
  so cheerful as Chaucer.</p>

  <p>Matthew Arnold coupled Chaucer with Burns, as two fine poets who fell
  short of 'seriousness'. It is queer that he does not see the very contrast he
  suggests. Chaucer may or may not be serious, but he is not seriously in
  revolt against seriousness. He does not resent the Parson or the Clerk of
  Oxford being wholly serious. He leans back easily against the hundred books
  of Aristotle; like a man in his own home. Chaucer may be too much at ease in
  Zion. But Burns is not at all at ease in his Zion. The attitude of Burns to
  the local and national theology is one of revolt and nothing else. It was
  simply a dingy provincialism that could only narrow the mind. But for Chaucer
  his theology was a thing that broadened his mind. It brought him into contact
  with great minds like Dante and Aquinas; it linked up his country with all
  Europe; it even referred him backwards to the greatest sages of pagan
  antiquity. That is the fact that must in fairness be balanced against the
  slow progress and patchy incompleteness of medieval education. Chaucer,
  though a courtier and diplomatist, might have only one or two books; little
  trifles tossed off by Aristotle or Dante. Robert Burns, though a peasant and
  a poor man, might have a chance of buying a whole load of books of Scottish
  theology; a small library of Calvinistic sermons. Only he did not want to. He
  did not like them. He was never moved to say of them, 'On bokës for to rede I
  me delyte.' Poor Burns never got out of the Puritan fog for one breath of
  that fresh air and daylight, of quite spontaneous spiritual joy and
  gratitude, with which the medieval poet stretches out his hands to saints and
  sages as to his best benefactors and friends. In that larger enlightenment of
  theological theory, Chaucer could afford to be relatively cheerful and
  charitable even about the degradations of ecclesiastical practice. Chaucer
  had more tolerance for the corruptions of Catholicism than Burns had even for
  the decencies of Calvinism. And it is not hard to see why; because, while
  Chaucer's mind had been irritated or distressed by the incidental evils of a
  corrupted Christianity, at least his soul had not been poisoned and blackened
  and blasted by the monomaniac horrors of a Simple Christianity.</p>

  <p>He had not seen all theology shrivel to a single thought; its very
  thunders of indignation all on one note; or the whole great Christian
  philosophy hardened into one harsh doctrine. It is that flat featureless
  inhumanity, that repetition of pattern, that absence of ornament, that made
  Puritanism to a man like Burns, not a castle of enchantment, not even a false
  enchantment, but merely a prison. It is that which gives that indescribable
  irrationality and violence to the cry of Burns; an irrationality that was
  perhaps the beginning of Romanticism. But Chaucer is never irrational;
  however much he may be irritated. He feels in a vast if vague fashion that he
  has Reason behind him; as he has Aristotle and Aquinas and a whole
  civilization behind him. It was in many ways a decaying civilization; it was
  (for the time being) even a dying civilization. But it was a dying
  civilization by which a man might live; and even live merrily. He did not
  suffer the particular kind of suffocation that comes in the <i>cul-de-sac</i>
  of a single idea, which is called a simple creed. He had the breadth and the
  blessings of a complicated creed. Its corruptions, as distinct from its
  complications, often took the form of the most abominable abuses; because the
  corruption of the best is the worst. But the corruption of the worst is
  nothing at all; it simply ceases; it does not even continue to corrupt.</p>

  <p>As I have already emphasized, I have very considerable sympathy with the
  Lollards; the particular heretics of the Chaucerian epoch. They were often
  infamously treated; they were sometimes intuitively right. In so far as they
  originally set out to reform the practical Catholicism of their day, there
  were few reputable Catholics then, and there are no reasonable Catholics now,
  who would deny that Catholicism very much needed it. In so far as they had a
  desire to purify Catholicism, they may often have been spiritually right even
  when they were intellectually wrong; and in that sense, may have been better
  Catholics than the Catholics. But in so far as they had a desire to
  <i>simplify</i> Catholicism, the Catholic Church was ten thousand times right
  in its desire to defeat and crush them. That notion, in its essence a very
  negative notion, has never wrought anything but ill to Christendom; and is
  always returning with a plausibility and a false simplicity to tempt and to
  betray Christians. Mahomet, centuries before, had tried to create a
  simplified Christianity, and had created a world of fatalism and stagnation.
  Calvin, centuries afterwards, tried to create a simplified Christianity, and
  created a world of pessimism and devil-worship. It was of the very life of
  the ancient civilization, Pagan as well as Christian, from which medievalism
  drew its deep and strange type of strength, that it was rooted in very varied
  realities; that it had made a cosmos out of a chaos of experiences; that it
  knew what was positive and could yet allow for what was really relative; that
  its Christ was shared by God and Man; that its government was shared by God
  and Caesar: that its philosophers made a bridge between faith and reason,
  between freedom and fatalism; and that its moralists warned men alike against
  presumption and despair. Only by understanding all that ten times complicated
  sort of complication, can we see how Geoffrey Chaucer could find life so
  simple.</p>

  <p>The meaning of Aquinas is that medievalism was always seeking a centre of
  gravity. The meaning of Chaucer is that, when found, it was always a centre
  of gaiety. For very many modern people, even of those who are sympathetic
  with, or even reverential towards, the religion that prevailed before the
  Reformation, quite honestly believe that it is solely a mystical ecstasy; and
  that sincere believers in it must be saints or nothing. In fact, it is
  exactly the other way round. It was Protestantism that was a mystical
  ecstasy; especially Protestantism in its pure form of Puritanism. It was the
  really good and sincere Protestants who were saints or nothing. The political
  period, that was actually named The Reign of the Saints, meant the
  Commonwealth that was The Reign of the Puritans. A frivolous Puritan was not
  a Puritan at all. But it is not true, in the same sense, that a frivolous
  Catholic is not a Catholic at all. A Catholic may be like (or indeed may
  actually be) a dancer whose whole business is dancing, a clown who has to be
  continually thinking about clowning; but may feel all the time that there is
  solid ground to dance on, in the sort of solid world that his soul inhabits.
  And this has a way of happening, especially at moments when the world is
  becoming much less solid, for people who are more serious. When corruption
  and chaos are disturbing ordinary minds, and many good men are only worried
  and serious, it has often happened that a great man could apparently be
  frivolous; and appear in history almost as a great buffoon. One of the
  sonnets of Mr. Maurice Baring has a haunting line about the souls of lovers
  blown upon a wind: 'to rest for ever on the unresting air.' In a very
  different connexion, it can be said that these rare and sane spirits did rest
  on the unresting air of a revolutionary epoch or a dissolving civilization.
  And there is always something about them puzzling to those who see their
  frivolity from the outside and not their faith from the inside. It is not
  realized that their faith is not a stagnation but an equilibrium. If we take
  three men as types; Chaucer and Thomas More and Cervantes, we shall note that
  they were three Catholics whose lives cover the whole story of the breakdown
  of Catholicism; the first appearing in the earliest disturbances at the end
  of medievalism; the second at the very crisis of the crash; the third just
  after the division of Christendom was practically complete. And our first
  impression will be that they were all three of them humorists, who took
  things very easily, considering the dreadful days of destruction and
  transition in which they lived. The only legend left by Sir Thomas More was
  that he actually died laughing. It is quite true that he died joking, though
  there was already the beginnings of the Puritan stiffness that would not
  unbend to jokes; just as his fellow-martyr Kimball died smoking, in spite of
  the fury which faddists like James the First were to fulminate against
  tobacco. There is something almost irresponsible in the intellectual ease
  with which Cervantes feels himself free to chaff chivalry out of existence;
  when so many greater things, that went with it, had largely ceased to exist.
  The greatest of all satires on mere medievalism came out of the man and the
  country most full of what is called the medieval creed. But Catholicism is
  not medievalism. It is only something that could make medievalism tolerable
  to a man like Chaucer; just as it could make something more like modernism
  tolerable to men of the Renaissance like More and Cervantes. The whole story
  will make no sense, unless we realize that the Catholic philosophy can
  content a man; rather specially if the man is a philosopher; and not least if
  he is a laughing philosopher.</p>

  <p>In this sense we are quite ready to admit that Chaucer was only a lucky
  and lonely elf, who found a sunbeam and danced in it. But sunbeams only come
  from the sun, and the sun is the centre of a solar system. At any rate, his
  sun was the centre of his solar system. If we are to understand it, we must
  go back to a very ancient sunrise; nay, to many repeated sunsets. It is
  <i>not</i> true that his daylight spirit belongs only to the day that had not
  yet dawned; the day of the Renaissance. If we want to trace that light, we
  must trace it backward through the ages; and, by way of a beginning, as was
  here recorded at the start, we must go back to Boethius. It does not matter
  for the moment whether we call that culture Catholicism or the continuity of
  an ancient Humanism. We must go back to that 'long evening by the
  Mediterranean', as it has been finely called, when all that was best in a
  Christian Empire, in the person of Boethius, remembered the Stoics and defied
  a tyrant and died. There were not two men who died, a Christian and a Stoic;
  but one man who was already both. That is the heritage that had been handed
  down to Christian men; and it was not lopsided or bigoted. Why did Alfred
  throw himself at once upon the translation of Boethius? There were any number
  of dreary hagiographical legends for him to translate. Why did St. Thomas, at
  the very top of the Middle Ages, think also of Boethius? Why did he resist
  the short-sighted panic that condemned Aristotle? Because against a thousand
  wild and wanton accidents, in the confusion following on the barbarian
  invasions and the failure of the Roman scheme, the spirit of all that society
  was making for a balance; a balance like that of the two eyes of a man; or
  that which gives two scales even to Justice blind. It was holding hard on to
  civilization and an equal law, and that hold did not fail, even when the
  civilization failed.</p>

  <p>The ancient central civilization from which the Lollards and Lutherans and
  later Puritans broke away was, or looked like, a dying civilization. So the
  central civilization from which Mahomet and the Moslems broke away was, or
  looked like, a dying civilization. Byzantium appeared in the eyes of Mahomet,
  as Babylon in the visions of Petrarch, as a thing stiff with gold but stiff
  also with fossilization; a thing visibly sinking under the weight of its own
  wickedness and wealth. It is not specially surprising that many in the Dark
  Ages preferred Bagdad to Byzantium, and even called it the superiority of
  Islam to Christendom. But it has not in the long run meant the superiority of
  Asia to Europe; or even the absorption of Christendom by the advance of
  Islam. Similarly, the setting up of sects in the sixteenth and seventeenth
  centuries has not meant in the long run the absorption of Catholicism by the
  advance of Puritanism. What Mahomet and Calvin and all those thus breaking
  away from the dying civilization did not realize, is the curious fact that it
  is a dying civilization that never dies. It does decline, and has done so any
  number of times; it does decay; it is always at it. But it does not
  disappear; and, at the end of more or less debased periods, has a way of
  managing to reappear, when its enemies have in their turn decayed. The moral
  is, I will venture to think, that it is unwise to desert this perpetually
  sinking ship, or betray this everlastingly dying creed and culture. It has
  had another period of final extinction; even since its final extinction at
  the end of the Middle Ages. It has suffered eclipse in the Enlightenment of
  the Age of Reason and Revolution; which in their turn begin to look as if
  they had seen better days. And to-day it stands erect and resurrected; and to
  right and left of it the Moslems have stagnated and the Puritans starved;
  starved not only for the art and symbolism normal to men, but now for the
  faith and conviction once special to themselves. No; it was not wise to leave
  it, even for the Republic; it will not be wise to leave it, even for the
  Soviet.</p>

  <p>The moral is that no man should desert that civilization. It can cure
  itself; but those who leave it cannot cure it. Not Nestorius nor Mahomet nor
  Calvin nor Lenin have cured, nor will cure, the real evils of Christendom;
  for the severed hand does not heal the whole body. Those outside the body
  will endure only centuries of separation and then death. Where are the
  Nestorians? Meanwhile, within the body of the Christian world, there was a
  perpetual and centripetal tendency towards the discovery of a just balance of
  all these ideas. All those who broke away were centrifugal and not
  centripetal; they went away into deserts to develop a solitary doctrine. But
  medieval philosophy and culture, with all the crimes and errors of its
  exponents, was always <i>seeking</i> equilibrium. It can be seen in every
  line of its rhythmic and balanced art; in every sentence of its carefully
  qualified and self-questioning philosophy. It was everywhere in the air,
  though it affected various people in various degrees now impossible to
  distinguish. But it was everywhere a movement towards civilization; towards
  the centre of ideas; whatever might be the wild decentralization of events.
  And, while there are many proofs of this, there could be no more full or
  unanswerable proof than the shout that showed that normality had been found.
  For a great voice was given by God, and a great volume of singing, not to his
  saints who deserved it much better; not to any of those heroes who had made
  that clearing in the ancient forest; but only suddenly, and for a season, to
  the most human of human beings.</p>
