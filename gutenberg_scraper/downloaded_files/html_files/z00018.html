Crusoe</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;START IN LIFE</h3>

<p>I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good
family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of
Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He got a good estate by
merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York,
from whence he had married my mother, whose relations were named
Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was
called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words
in England, we are now called&mdash;nay we call ourselves and write
our name&mdash;Crusoe; and so my companions always called me.</p>

<p>I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to
an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the
famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk
against the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never
knew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.</p>

<p>Being the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my
head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My
father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of
learning, as far as house-education and a country free school
generally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied
with nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so
strongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and
against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other
friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity
of nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to
befall me.</p>

<p>My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent
counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one
morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and
expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me
what reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for
leaving father's house and my native country, where I might be well
introduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application
and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was
men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior
fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by
enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature
out of the common road; that these things were all either too far
above me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or
what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had
found, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the
most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and
hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of
mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and
envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the
happiness of this state by this one thing&mdash;viz. that this was
the state of life which all other people envied; that kings have
frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to
great things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the
two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man
gave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he
prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.</p>

<p>He bade me observe it, and I should always find that the
calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of
mankind, but that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and
was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part
of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and
uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious
living, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard
labour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the
other hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural
consequences of their way of living; that the middle station of
life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of
enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle
fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society,
all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the
blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men
went silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out
of it, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the
head, not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed
with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the
body of rest, nor enraged with the passion of envy, or the secret
burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy
circumstances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly
tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that they
are happy, and learning by every day's experience to know it more
sensibly.</p>

<p>After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate
manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into
miseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in,
seemed to have provided against; that I was under no necessity of
seeking my bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to
enter me fairly into the station of life which he had just been
recommending to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in
the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it;
and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus
discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he knew
would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind
things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he directed, so
he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any
encouragement to go away; and to close all, he told me I had my
elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same earnest
persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but
could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the
army, where he was killed; and though he said he would not cease to
pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take
this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I should have
leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when
there might be none to assist in my recovery.</p>

<p>I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly
prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so
himself&mdash;I say, I observed the tears run down his face very
plentifully, especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed:
and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to
assist me, he was so moved that he broke off the discourse, and
told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me.</p>

<p>I was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who
could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any
more, but to settle at home according to my father's desire. But
alas! a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of
my father's further importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved
to run quite away from him. However, I did not act quite so hastily
as the first heat of my resolution prompted; but I took my mother
at a time when I thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary,
and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the
world that I should never settle to anything with resolution enough
to go through with it, and my father had better give me his consent
than force me to go without it; that I was now eighteen years old,
which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an
attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never serve out my
time, but I should certainly run away from my master before my time
was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my father to let
me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it,
I would go no more; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to
recover the time that I had lost.</p>

<p>This put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it
would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject;
that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to
anything so much for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could
think of any such thing after the discourse I had had with my
father, and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father
had used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there
was no help for me; but I might depend I should never have their
consent to it; that for her part she would not have so much hand in
my destruction; and I should never have it to say that my mother
was willing when my father was not.</p>

<p>Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard
afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my
father, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a
sigh, "That boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he
goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was
born: I can give no consent to it."</p>

<p>It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose,
though, in the meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulated with
my father and mother about their being so positively determined
against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to. But being
one day at Hull, where I went casually, and without any purpose of
making an elopement at that time; but, I say, being there, and one
of my companions being about to sail to London in his father's
ship, and prompting me to go with them with the common allurement
of seafaring men, that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I
consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent
them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might,
without asking God's blessing or my father's, without any
consideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour,
God knows, on the 1st of September 1651, I went on board a ship
bound for London. Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I
believe, began sooner, or continued longer than mine. The ship was
no sooner out of the Humber than the wind began to blow and the sea
to rise in a most frightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea
before, I was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in
mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and
how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked
leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty. All the good
counsels of my parents, my father's tears and my mother's
entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my conscience, which
was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has since,
reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the breach of my
duty to God and my father.</p>

<p>All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high,
though nothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what
I saw a few days after; but it was enough to affect me then, who
was but a young sailor, and had never known anything of the matter.
I expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every
time the ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or
hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; in this agony of
mind, I made many vows and resolutions that if it would please God
to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot
upon dry land again, I would go directly home to my father, and
never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would take his
advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these any more.
Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the middle
station of life, how easy, how comfortably he had lived all his
days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea or troubles on
shore; and I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal,
go home to my father.</p>

<p>These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm
lasted, and indeed some time after; but the next day the wind was
abated, and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to
it; however, I was very grave for all that day, being also a little
sea-sick still; but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind
was quite over, and a charming fine evening followed; the sun went
down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and having
little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the
sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.</p>

<p>I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but
very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough
and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant
in so little a time after. And now, lest my good resolutions should
continue, my companion, who had enticed me away, comes to me;
"Well, Bob," says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, "how do you do
after it? I warrant you were frighted, wer'n't you, last night,
when it blew but a capful of wind?" "A capful d'you call it?" said
I; "'twas a terrible storm." "A storm, you fool you," replies he;
"do you call that a storm? why, it was nothing at all; give us but
a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall of
wind as that; but you're but a fresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let
us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that; d'ye see what
charming weather 'tis now?" To make short this sad part of my
story, we went the way of all sailors; the punch was made and I was
made half drunk with it: and in that one night's wickedness I
drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct,
all my resolutions for the future. In a word, as the sea was
returned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the
abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my
fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being
forgotten, and the current of my former desires returned, I
entirely forgot the vows and promises that I made in my distress. I
found, indeed, some intervals of reflection; and the serious
thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again sometimes; but
I shook them off, and roused myself from them as it were from a
distemper, and applying myself to drinking and company, soon
mastered the return of those fits&mdash;for so I called them; and I
had in five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience
as any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could
desire. But I was to have another trial for it still; and
Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave
me entirely without excuse; for if I would not take this for a
deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most
hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the
mercy of.</p>

<p>The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads;
the wind having been contrary and the weather calm, we had made but
little way since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an
anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary&mdash;viz. at
south-west&mdash;for seven or eight days, during which time a great
many ships from Newcastle came into the same Roads, as the common
harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river.</p>

<p>We had not, however, rid here so long but we should have tided
it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and after we had
lain four or five days, blew very hard. However, the Roads being
reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our
ground-tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the
least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth,
after the manner of the sea; but the eighth day, in the morning,
the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to strike our
topmasts, and make everything snug and close, that the ship might
ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed,
and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we
thought once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which our
master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two
anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the bitter end.</p>

<p>By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began to
see terror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen
themselves. The master, though vigilant in the business of
preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin by me,
I could hear him softly to himself say, several times, "Lord be
merciful to us! we shall be all lost! we shall be all undone!" and
the like. During these first hurries I was stupid, lying still in
my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my temper:
I could ill resume the first penitence which I had so apparently
trampled upon and hardened myself against: I thought the bitterness
of death had been past, and that this would be nothing like the
first; but when the master himself came by me, as I said just now,
and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted. I got up
out of my cabin and looked out; but such a dismal sight I never
saw: the sea ran mountains high, and broke upon us every three or
four minutes; when I could look about, I could see nothing but
distress round us; two ships that rode near us, we found, had cut
their masts by the board, being deep laden; and our men cried out
that a ship which rode about a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two
more ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out of the
Roads to sea, at all adventures, and that with not a mast standing.
The light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the
sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running
away with only their spritsail out before the wind.</p>

<p>Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our
ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was very
unwilling to do; but the boatswain protesting to him that if he did
not the ship would founder, he consented; and when they had cut
away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood so loose, and shook the
ship so much, they were obliged to cut that away also, and make a
clear deck.</p>

<p>Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who
was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at
but a little. But if I can express at this distance the thoughts I
had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind
upon account of my former convictions, and the having returned from
them to the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was
at death itself; and these, added to the terror of the storm, put
me into such a condition that I can by no words describe it. But
the worst was not come yet; the storm continued with such fury that
the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never seen a worse. We
had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and wallowed in the sea,
so that the seamen every now and then cried out she would founder.
It was my advantage in one respect, that I did not know what they
meant by <i>founder</i> till I inquired. However, the storm was so
violent that I saw, what is not often seen, the master, the
boatswain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their
prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship would go to the
bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all the rest of our
distresses, one of the men that had been down to see cried out we
had sprung a leak; another said there was four feet water in the
hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that word, my
heart, as I thought, died within me: and I fell backwards upon the
side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused
me, and told me that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as
well able to pump as another; at which I stirred up and went to the
pump, and worked very heartily. While this was doing the master,
seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm
were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would come near us,
ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing
what they meant, thought the ship had broken, or some dreadful
thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised that I fell down in a
swoon. As this was a time when everybody had his own life to think
of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me; but another man
stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let
me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I
came to myself.</p>

<p>We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was
apparent that the ship would founder; and though the storm began to
abate a little, yet it was not possible she could swim till we
might run into any port; so the master continued firing guns for
help; and a light ship, who had rid it out just ahead of us,
ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost hazard the
boat came near us; but it was impossible for us to get on board, or
for the boat to lie near the ship's side, till at last the men
rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our
men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then
veered it out a great length, which they, after much labour and
hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern, and
got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after
we were in the boat, to think of reaching their own ship; so all
agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as
much as we could; and our master promised them, that if the boat
was staved upon shore, he would make it good to their master: so
partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away to the
northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as Winterton
Ness.</p>

<p>We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship
till we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what
was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had
hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for
from the moment that they rather put me into the boat than that I
might be said to go in, my heart was, as it were, dead within me,
partly with fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of
what was yet before me.</p>

<p>While we were in this condition&mdash;the men yet labouring at
the oar to bring the boat near the shore&mdash;we could see (when,
our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore) a great
many people running along the strand to assist us when we should
come near; but we made but slow way towards the shore; nor were we
able to reach the shore till, being past the lighthouse at
Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward towards Cromer, and
so the land broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we
got in, and though not without much difficulty, got all safe on
shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as
unfortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well by the
magistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by
particular merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us
sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull as we
thought fit.</p>

<p>Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone
home, I had been happy, and my father, as in our blessed Saviour's
parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for hearing the
ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great
while before he had any assurances that I was not drowned.</p>

<p>But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing
could resist; and though I had several times loud calls from my
reason and my more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power
to do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I urge that it is
a secret overruling decree, that hurries us on to be the
instruments of our own destruction, even though it be before us,
and that we rush upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but
some such decreed unavoidable misery, which it was impossible for
me to escape, could have pushed me forward against the calm
reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and against
two such visible instructions as I had met with in my first
attempt.</p>

<p>My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the
master's son, was now less forward than I. The first time he spoke
to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three
days, for we were separated in the town to several quarters; I say,
the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone was altered; and,
looking very melancholy, and shaking his head, he asked me how I
did, and telling his father who I was, and how I had come this
voyage only for a trial, in order to go further abroad, his father,
turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone "Young man,"
says he, "you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to take
this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a
seafaring man." "Why, sir," said I, "will you go to sea no more?"
"That is another case," said he; "it is my calling, and therefore
my duty; but as you made this voyage on trial, you see what a taste
Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you persist.
Perhaps this has all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the
ship of Tarshish. Pray," continues he, "what are you; and on what
account did you go to sea?" Upon that I told him some of my story;
at the end of which he burst out into a strange kind of passion:
"What had I done," says he, "that such an unhappy wretch should
come into my ship? I would not set my foot in the same ship with
thee again for a thousand pounds." This indeed was, as I said, an
excursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of
his loss, and was farther than he could have authority to go.
However, he afterwards talked very gravely to me, exhorting me to
go back to my father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin, telling
me I might see a visible hand of Heaven against me. "And, young
man," said he, "depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you
go, you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments,
till your father's words are fulfilled upon you."</p>

<p>We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I saw
him no more; which way he went I knew not. As for me, having some
money in my pocket, I travelled to London by land; and there, as
well as on the road, had many struggles with myself what course of
life I should take, and whether I should go home or to sea.</p>

<p>As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to
my thoughts, and it immediately occurred to me how I should be
laughed at among the neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not
my father and mother only, but even everybody else; from whence I
have since often observed, how incongruous and irrational the
common temper of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason
which ought to guide them in such cases&mdash;viz. that they are
not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not ashamed of
the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but
are ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be esteemed
wise men.</p>

<p>In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain
what measures to take, and what course of life to lead. An
irresistible reluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed
away a while, the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore
off, and as that abated, the little motion I had in my desires to
return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the
thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;SLAVERY AND ESCAPE</h3>

<p>That evil influence which carried me first away from my father's
house&mdash;which hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of
raising my fortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly
upon me as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the
entreaties and even the commands of my father&mdash;I say, the same
influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate of all
enterprises to my view; and I went on board a vessel bound to the
coast of Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly called it, a voyage to
Guinea.</p>

<p>It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did
not ship myself as a sailor; when, though I might indeed have
worked a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I should
have learnt the duty and office of a fore-mast man, and in time
might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a
master. But as it was always my fate to choose for the worse, so I
did here; for having money in my pocket and good clothes upon my
back, I would always go on board in the habit of a gentleman; and
so I neither had any business in the ship, nor learned to do
any.</p>

<p>It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in
London, which does not always happen to such loose and misguided
young fellows as I then was; the devil generally not omitting to
lay some snare for them very early; but it was not so with me. I
first got acquainted with the master of a ship who had been on the
coast of Guinea; and who, having had very good success there, was
resolved to go again. This captain taking a fancy to my
conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that time,
hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me if I would go
the voyage with him I should be at no expense; I should be his
messmate and his companion; and if I could carry anything with me,
I should have all the advantage of it that the trade would admit;
and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement.</p>

<p>I embraced the offer; and entering into a strict friendship with
this captain, who was an honest, plain-dealing man, I went the
voyage with him, and carried a small adventure with me, which, by
the disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I increased
very considerably; for I carried about &Acirc;&pound;40 in such
toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. These
&Acirc;&pound;40 I had mustered together by the assistance of some
of my relations whom I corresponded with; and who, I believe, got
my father, or at least my mother, to contribute so much as that to
my first adventure.</p>

<p>This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all
my adventures, which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my
friend the captain; under whom also I got a competent knowledge of
the mathematics and the rules of navigation, learned how to keep an
account of the ship's course, take an observation, and, in short,
to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a
sailor; for, as he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to
learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a
merchant; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust
for my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return, almost
&Acirc;&pound;300; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts
which have since so completed my ruin.</p>

<p>Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particularly,
that I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent calenture
by the excessive heat of the climate; our principal trading being
upon the coast, from latitude of 15 degrees north even to the line
itself.</p>

<p>I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my great
misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same
voyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was
his mate in the former voyage, and had now got the command of the
ship. This was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for though
I did not carry quite &Acirc;&pound;100 of my new-gained wealth, so
that I had &Acirc;&pound;200 left, which I had lodged with my
friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into terrible
misfortunes. The first was this: our ship making her course towards
the Canary Islands, or rather between those islands and the African
shore, was surprised in the grey of the morning by a Turkish rover
of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail she could make.
We crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread, or our
masts carry, to get clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us,
and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared to
fight; our ship having twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen. About
three in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing to, by
mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as
he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on that side, and
poured in a broadside upon him, which made him sheer off again,
after returning our fire, and pouring in also his small shot from
near two hundred men which he had on board. However, we had not a
man touched, all our men keeping close. He prepared to attack us
again, and we to defend ourselves. But laying us on board the next
time upon our other quarter, he entered sixty men upon our decks,
who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the sails and rigging.
We plied them with small shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such
like, and cleared our deck of them twice. However, to cut short
this melancholy part of our story, our ship being disabled, and
three of our men killed, and eight wounded, we were obliged to
yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging
to the Moors.</p>

<p>The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I
apprehended; nor was I carried up the country to the emperor's
court, as the rest of our men were, but was kept by the captain of
the rover as his proper prize, and made his slave, being young and
nimble, and fit for his business. At this surprising change of my
circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was
perfectly overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon my father's
prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable and have none
to relieve me, which I thought was now so effectually brought to
pass that I could not be worse; for now the hand of Heaven had
overtaken me, and I was undone without redemption; but, alas! this
was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will appear
in the sequel of this story.</p>

<p>As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, so
I was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea
again, believing that it would some time or other be his fate to be
taken by a Spanish or Portugal man-of-war; and that then I should
be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken away; for
when he went to sea, he left me on shore to look after his little
garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves about his house; and
when he came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in
the cabin to look after the ship.</p>

<p>Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might
take to effect it, but found no way that had the least probability
in it; nothing presented to make the supposition of it rational;
for I had nobody to communicate it to that would embark with
me&mdash;no fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman
there but myself; so that for two years, though I often pleased
myself with the imagination, yet I never had the least encouraging
prospect of putting it in practice.</p>

<p>After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself,
which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty
again in my head. My patron lying at home longer than usual without
fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for want of money, he
used constantly, once or twice a week, sometimes oftener if the
weather was fair, to take the ship's pinnace and go out into the
road a-fishing; and as he always took me and young Maresco with him
to row the boat, we made him very merry, and I proved very
dexterous in catching fish; insomuch that sometimes he would send
me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth&mdash;the
Maresco, as they called him&mdash;to catch a dish of fish for
him.</p>

<p>It happened one time, that going a-fishing in a calm morning, a
fog rose so thick that, though we were not half a league from the
shore, we lost sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which
way, we laboured all day, and all the next night; and when the
morning came we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling
in for the shore; and that we were at least two leagues from the
shore. However, we got well in again, though with a great deal of
labour and some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in
the morning; but we were all very hungry.</p>

<p>But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more
care of himself for the future; and having lying by him the
longboat of our English ship that he had taken, he resolved he
would not go a-fishing any more without a compass and some
provision; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who also was an
English slave, to build a little state-room, or cabin, in the
middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a place to
stand behind it to steer, and haul home the main-sheet; the room
before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails. She sailed
with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton sail; and the boom jibed
over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in
it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on,
with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he
thought fit to drink; and his bread, rice, and coffee.</p>

<p>We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing; and as I was
most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It
happened that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for
pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction
in that place, and for whom he had provided extraordinarily, and
had, therefore, sent on board the boat overnight a larger store of
provisions than ordinary; and had ordered me to get ready three
fusees with powder and shot, which were on board his ship, for that
they designed some sport of fowling as well as fishing.</p>

<p>I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next
morning with the boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants out,
and everything to accommodate his guests; when by-and-by my patron
came on board alone, and told me his guests had put off going from
some business that fell out, and ordered me, with the man and boy,
as usual, to go out with the boat and catch them some fish, for
that his friends were to sup at his house, and commanded that as
soon as I got some fish I should bring it home to his house; all
which I prepared to do.</p>

<p>This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my
thoughts, for now I found I was likely to have a little ship at my
command; and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself,
not for fishing business, but for a voyage; though I knew not,
neither did I so much as consider, whither I should
steer&mdash;anywhere to get out of that place was my desire.</p>

<p>My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this
Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board; for I told him
we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread. He said that was
true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, and three
jars of fresh water, into the boat. I knew where my patron's case
of bottles stood, which it was evident, by the make, were taken out
of some English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the
Moor was on shore, as if they had been there before for our master.
I conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat, which
weighed about half a hundred-weight, with a parcel of twine or
thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of which were of great
use to us afterwards, especially the wax, to make candles. Another
trick I tried upon him, which he innocently came into also: his
name was Ismael, which they call Muley, or Moely; so I called to
him&mdash;"Moely," said I, "our patron's guns are on board the
boat; can you not get a little powder and shot? It may be we may
kill some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I
know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship." "Yes," says he,
"I'll bring some;" and accordingly he brought a great leather
pouch, which held a pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and
another with shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets,
and put all into the boat. At the same time I had found some powder
of my master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the
large bottles in the case, which was almost empty, pouring what was
in it into another; and thus furnished with everything needful, we
sailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which is at the
entrance of the port, knew who we were, and took no notice of us;
and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in
our sail and set us down to fish. The wind blew from the N.N.E.,
which was contrary to my desire, for had it blown southerly I had
been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to
the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it would,
I would be gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave the
rest to fate.</p>

<p>After we had fished some time and caught nothing&mdash;for when
I had fish on my hook I would not pull them up, that he might not
see them&mdash;I said to the Moor, "This will not do; our master
will not be thus served; we must stand farther off." He, thinking
no harm, agreed, and being in the head of the boat, set the sails;
and, as I had the helm, I ran the boat out near a league farther,
and then brought her to, as if I would fish; when, giving the boy
the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and making as if
I stooped for something behind him, I took him by surprise with my
arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard into the sea.
He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me,
begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over the world with
me. He swam so strong after the boat that he would have reached me
very quickly, there being but little wind; upon which I stepped
into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented
it at him, and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be
quiet I would do him none. "But," said I, "you swim well enough to
reach to the shore, and the sea is calm; make the best of your way
to shore, and I will do you no harm; but if you come near the boat
I'll shoot you through the head, for I am resolved to have my
liberty;" so he turned himself about, and swam for the shore, and I
make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent
swimmer.</p>

<p>I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and
have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When
he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said
to him, "Xury, if you will be faithful to me, I'll make you a great
man; but if you will not stroke your face to be true to
me"&mdash;that is, swear by Mahomet and his father's beard&mdash;"I
must throw you into the sea too." The boy smiled in my face, and
spoke so innocently that I could not distrust him, and swore to be
faithful to me, and go all over the world with me.</p>

<p>While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out
directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that
they might think me gone towards the Straits' mouth (as indeed any
one that had been in their wits must have been supposed to do): for
who would have supposed we were sailed on to the southward, to the
truly Barbarian coast, where whole nations of negroes were sure to
surround us with their canoes and destroy us; where we could not go
on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more
merciless savages of human kind.</p>

<p>But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course,
and steered directly south and by east, bending my course a little
towards the east, that I might keep in with the shore; and having a
fair, fresh gale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail
that I believe by the next day, at three o'clock in the afternoon,
when I first made the land, I could not be less than one hundred
and fifty miles south of Sallee; quite beyond the Emperor of
Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for
we saw no people.</p>

<p>Yet such was the fright I had taken of the Moors, and the
dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I
would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor; the wind
continuing fair till I had sailed in that manner five days; and
then the wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also that if
any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would now give
over; so I ventured to make to the coast, and came to an anchor in
the mouth of a little river, I knew not what, nor where, neither
what latitude, what country, what nation, or what river. I neither
saw, nor desired to see any people; the principal thing I wanted
was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening, resolving
to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the country;
but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of
the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not
what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and
begged of me not to go on shore till day. "Well, Xury," said I,
"then I won't; but it may be that we may see men by day, who will
be as bad to us as those lions." "Then we give them the shoot gun,"
says Xury, laughing, "make them run wey." Such English Xury spoke
by conversing among us slaves. However, I was glad to see the boy
so cheerful, and I gave him a dram (out of our patron's case of
bottles) to cheer him up. After all, Xury's advice was good, and I
took it; we dropped our little anchor, and lay still all night; I
say still, for we slept none; for in two or three hours we saw vast
great creatures (we knew not what to call them) of many sorts, come
down to the sea-shore and run into the water, wallowing and washing
themselves for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they made
such hideous howlings and yellings, that I never indeed heard the
like.</p>

<p>Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but we
were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty creatures
come swimming towards our boat; we could not see him, but we might
hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast.
Xury said it was a lion, and it might be so for aught I know; but
poor Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and row away; "No," says
I, "Xury; we can slip our cable, with the buoy to it, and go off to
sea; they cannot follow us far." I had no sooner said so, but I
perceived the creature (whatever it was) within two oars' length,
which something surprised me; however, I immediately stepped to the
cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at him; upon which he
immediately turned about and swam towards the shore again.</p>

<p>But it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and hideous
cries and howlings that were raised, as well upon the edge of the
shore as higher within the country, upon the noise or report of the
gun, a thing I have some reason to believe those creatures had
never heard before: this convinced me that there was no going on
shore for us in the night on that coast, and how to venture on
shore in the day was another question too; for to have fallen into
the hands of any of the savages had been as bad as to have fallen
into the hands of the lions and tigers; at least we were equally
apprehensive of the danger of it.</p>

<p>Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or
other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat; when and
where to get to it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him go
on shore with one of the jars, he would find if there was any
water, and bring some to me. I asked him why he would go? why I
should not go, and he stay in the boat? The boy answered with so
much affection as made me love him ever after. Says he, "If wild
mans come, they eat me, you go wey." "Well, Xury," said I, "we will
both go and if the wild mans come, we will kill them, they shall
eat neither of us." So I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat,
and a dram out of our patron's case of bottles which I mentioned
before; and we hauled the boat in as near the shore as we thought
was proper, and so waded on shore, carrying nothing but our arms
and two jars for water.</p>

<p>I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
coming of canoes with savages down the river; but the boy seeing a
low place about a mile up the country, rambled to it, and by-and-by
I saw him come running towards me. I thought he was pursued by some
savage, or frighted with some wild beast, and I ran forward towards
him to help him; but when I came nearer to him I saw something
hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot,
like a hare, but different in colour, and longer legs; however, we
were very glad of it, and it was very good meat; but the great joy
that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good water
and seen no wild mans.</p>

<p>But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for
water, for a little higher up the creek where we were we found the
water fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but a little way
up; so we filled our jars, and feasted on the hare he had killed,
and prepared to go on our way, having seen no footsteps of any
human creature in that part of the country.</p>

<p>As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well
that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verde Islands
also, lay not far off from the coast. But as I had no instruments
to take an observation to know what latitude we were in, and not
exactly knowing, or at least remembering, what latitude they were
in, I knew not where to look for them, or when to stand off to sea
towards them; otherwise I might now easily have found some of these
islands. But my hope was, that if I stood along this coast till I
came to that part where the English traded, I should find some of
their vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would relieve
and take us in.</p>

<p>By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was must
be that country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco's
dominions and the negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by
wild beasts; the negroes having abandoned it and gone farther south
for fear of the Moors, and the Moors not thinking it worth
inhabiting by reason of its barrenness; and indeed, both forsaking
it because of the prodigious number of tigers, lions, leopards, and
other furious creatures which harbour there; so that the Moors use
it for their hunting only, where they go like an army, two or three
thousand men at a time; and indeed for near a hundred miles
together upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste, uninhabited
country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild
beasts by night.</p>

<p>Once or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the Pico of
Teneriffe, being the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the
Canaries, and had a great mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching
thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary
winds, the sea also going too high for my little vessel; so, I
resolved to pursue my first design, and keep along the shore.</p>

<p>Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we
had left this place; and once in particular, being early in
morning, we came to an anchor under a little point of land, which
was pretty high; and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go
farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about him than it seems mine
were, calls softly to me, and tells me that we had best go farther
off the shore; "For," says he, "look, yonder lies a dreadful
monster on the side of that hillock, fast asleep." I looked where
he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a
terrible, great lion that lay on the side of the shore, under the
shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little over
him. "Xury," says I, "you shall on shore and kill him." Xury,
looked frighted, and said, "Me kill! he eat me at one
mouth!"&mdash;one mouthful he meant. However, I said no more to the
boy, but bade him lie still, and I took our biggest gun, which was
almost musket-bore, and loaded it with a good charge of powder, and
with two slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another gun with
two bullets; and the third (for we had three pieces) I loaded with
five smaller bullets. I took the best aim I could with the first
piece to have shot him in the head, but he lay so with his leg
raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about
the knee and broke the bone. He started up, growling at first, but
finding his leg broken, fell down again; and then got upon three
legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a
little surprised that I had not hit him on the head; however, I
took up the second piece immediately, and though he began to move
off, fired again, and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to
see him drop and make but little noise, but lie struggling for
life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me let him go on shore.
"Well, go," said I: so the boy jumped into the water and taking a
little gun in one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and
coming close to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his
ear, and shot him in the head again, which despatched him
quite.</p>

<p>This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very
sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that
was good for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would have some
of him; so he comes on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet.
"For what, Xury?" said I. "Me cut off his head," said he. However,
Xury could not cut off his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought
it with him, and it was a monstrous great one.</p>

<p>I bethought myself, however, that, perhaps the skin of him
might, one way or other, be of some value to us; and I resolved to
take off his skin if I could. So Xury and I went to work with him;
but Xury was much the better workman at it, for I knew very ill how
to do it. Indeed, it took us both up the whole day, but at last we
got off the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our cabin,
the sun effectually dried it in two days' time, and it afterwards
served me to lie upon.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III&mdash;WRECKED ON A DESERT ISLAND</h3>

<p>After this stop, we made on to the southward continually for ten
or twelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which
began to abate very much, and going no oftener to the shore than we
were obliged to for fresh water. My design in this was to make the
river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say anywhere about the Cape de
Verde, where I was in hopes to meet with some European ship; and if
I did not, I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for
the islands, or perish there among the negroes. I knew that all the
ships from Europe, which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to
Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this cape, or those islands;
and, in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this single
point, either that I must meet with some ship or must perish.</p>

<p>When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I
have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited; and in two
or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the
shore to look at us; we could also perceive they were quite black
and naked. I was once inclined to have gone on shore to them; but
Xury was my better counsellor, and said to me, "No go, no go."
However, I hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to them,
and I found they ran along the shore by me a good way. I observed
they had no weapons in their hand, except one, who had a long
slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they could
throw them a great way with good aim; so I kept at a distance, but
talked with them by signs as well as I could; and particularly made
signs for something to eat: they beckoned to me to stop my boat,
and they would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered the top of
my sail and lay by, and two of them ran up into the country, and in
less than half-an-hour came back, and brought with them two pieces
of dried flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country; but we neither knew what the one or the other was;
however, we were willing to accept it, but how to come at it was
our next dispute, for I would not venture on shore to them, and
they were as much afraid of us; but they took a safe way for us
all, for they brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went
and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board, and then
came close to us again.</p>

<p>We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them
amends; but an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them
wonderfully; for while we were lying by the shore came two mighty
creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury
from the mountains towards the sea; whether it was the male
pursuing the female, or whether they were in sport or in rage, we
could not tell, any more than we could tell whether it was usual or
strange, but I believe it was the latter; because, in the first
place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night;
and, in the second place, we found the people terribly frighted,
especially the women. The man that had the lance or dart did not
fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran
directly into the water, they did not offer to fall upon any of the
negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about, as if
they had come for their diversion; at last one of them began to
come nearer our boat than at first I expected; but I lay ready for
him, for I had loaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade
Xury load both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my
reach, I fired, and shot him directly in the head; immediately he
sank down into the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and
down, as if he were struggling for life, and so indeed he was; he
immediately made to the shore; but between the wound, which was his
mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just before
he reached the shore.</p>

<p>It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor
creatures at the noise and fire of my gun: some of them were even
ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the very terror;
but when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the water, and
that I made signs to them to come to the shore, they took heart and
came, and began to search for the creature. I found him by his
blood staining the water; and by the help of a rope, which I slung
round him, and gave the negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore,
and found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to
an admirable degree; and the negroes held up their hands with
admiration, to think what it was I had killed him with.</p>

<p>The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the
noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the
mountains from whence they came; nor could I, at that distance,
know what it was. I found quickly the negroes wished to eat the
flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have them take it as a
favour from me; which, when I made signs to them that they might
take him, they were very thankful for. Immediately they fell to
work with him; and though they had no knife, yet, with a sharpened
piece of wood, they took off his skin as readily, and much more
readily, than we could have done with a knife. They offered me some
of the flesh, which I declined, pointing out that I would give it
them; but made signs for the skin, which they gave me very freely,
and brought me a great deal more of their provisions, which, though
I did not understand, yet I accepted. I then made signs to them for
some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning it bottom
upward, to show that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it
filled. They called immediately to some of their friends, and there
came two women, and brought a great vessel made of earth, and
burnt, as I supposed, in the sun, this they set down to me, as
before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them all
three. The women were as naked as the men.</p>

<p>I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and
water; and leaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for about
eleven days more, without offering to go near the shore, till I saw
the land run out a great length into the sea, at about the distance
of four or five leagues before me; and the sea being very calm, I
kept a large offing to make this point. At length, doubling the
point, at about two leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on
the other side, to seaward; then I concluded, as it was most
certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verde, and those the
islands called, from thence, Cape de Verde Islands. However, they
were at a great distance, and I could not well tell what I had best
to do; for if I should be taken with a fresh of wind, I might
neither reach one or other.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin
and sat down, Xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy
cried out, "Master, master, a ship with a sail!" and the foolish
boy was frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of
his master's ships sent to pursue us, but I knew we were far enough
out of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw,
not only the ship, but that it was a Portuguese ship; and, as I
thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea, for negroes. But, when I
observed the course she steered, I was soon convinced they were
bound some other way, and did not design to come any nearer to the
shore; upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I could,
resolving to speak with them if possible.</p>

<p>With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to
come in their way, but that they would be gone by before I could
make any signal to them: but after I had crowded to the utmost, and
began to despair, they, it seems, saw by the help of their glasses
that it was some European boat, which they supposed must belong to
some ship that was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come up.
I was encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's ancient on
board, I made a waft of it to them, for a signal of distress, and
fired a gun, both which they saw; for they told me they saw the
smoke, though they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals they
very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in about three
hours; time I came up with them.</p>

<p>They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in
French, but I understood none of them; but at last a Scotch sailor,
who was on board, called to me: and I answered him, and told him I
was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from
the Moors, at Sallee; they then bade me come on board, and very
kindly took me in, and all my goods.</p>

<p>It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe,
that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable
and almost hopeless condition as I was in; and I immediately
offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a return for my
deliverance; but he generously told me he would take nothing from
me, but that all I had should be delivered safe to me when I came
to the Brazils. "For," says he, "I have saved your life on no other
terms than I would be glad to be saved myself: and it may, one time
or other, be my lot to be taken up in the same condition. Besides,"
said he, "when I carry you to the Brazils, so great a way from your
own country, if I should take from you what you have, you will be
starved there, and then I only take away that life I have given.
No, no," says he: "Seignior Inglese" (Mr. Englishman), "I will
carry you thither in charity, and those things will help to buy
your subsistence there, and your passage home again."</p>

<p>As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the
performance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none should
touch anything that I had: then he took everything into his own
possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I
might have them, even to my three earthen jars.</p>

<p>As to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw, and told
me he would buy it of me for his ship's use; and asked me what I
would have for it? I told him he had been so generous to me in
everything that I could not offer to make any price of the boat,
but left it entirely to him: upon which he told me he would give me
a note of hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil;
and when it came there, if any one offered to give more, he would
make it up. He offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my
boy Xury, which I was loth to take; not that I was unwilling to let
the captain have him, but I was very loth to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own.
However, when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and
offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to
set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian: upon this, and
Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the captain have
him.</p>

<p>We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived in the
Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in about twenty-two
days after. And now I was once more delivered from the most
miserable of all conditions of life; and what to do next with
myself I was to consider.</p>

<p>The generous treatment the captain gave me I can never enough
remember: he would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me
twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's
skin, which I had in my boat, and caused everything I had in the
ship to be punctually delivered to me; and what I was willing to
sell he bought of me, such as the case of bottles, two of my guns,
and a piece of the lump of beeswax&mdash;for I had made candles of
the rest: in a word, I made about two hundred and twenty pieces of
eight of all my cargo; and with this stock I went on shore in the
Brazils.</p>

<p>I had not been long here before I was recommended to the house
of a good honest man like himself, who had an <i>ingenio</i>, as
they call it (that is, a plantation and a sugar-house). I lived
with him some time, and acquainted myself by that means with the
manner of planting and making of sugar; and seeing how well the
planters lived, and how they got rich suddenly, I resolved, if I
could get a licence to settle there, I would turn planter among
them: resolving in the meantime to find out some way to get my
money, which I had left in London, remitted to me. To this purpose,
getting a kind of letter of naturalisation, I purchased as much
land that was uncured as my money would reach, and formed a plan
for my plantation and settlement; such a one as might be suitable
to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive from
England.</p>

<p>I had a neighbour, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of English
parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as I
was. I call him my neighbour, because his plantation lay next to
mine, and we went on very sociably together. My stock was but low,
as well as his; and we rather planted for food than anything else,
for about two years. However, we began to increase, and our land
began to come into order; so that the third year we planted some
tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground ready for
planting canes in the year to come. But we both wanted help; and
now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in parting with my
boy Xury.</p>

<p>But, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great
wonder. I hail no remedy but to go on: I had got into an employment
quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I
delighted in, and for which I forsook my father's house, and broke
through all his good advice. Nay, I was coming into the very middle
station, or upper degree of low life, which my father advised me to
before, and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might as well
have stayed at home, and never have fatigued myself in the world as
I had done; and I used often to say to myself, I could have done
this as well in England, among my friends, as have gone five
thousand miles off to do it among strangers and savages, in a
wilderness, and at such a distance as never to hear from any part
of the world that had the least knowledge of me.</p>

<p>In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost
regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and then this
neighbour; no work to be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I
used to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon some desolate
island, that had nobody there but himself. But how just has it
been&mdash;and how should all men reflect, that when they compare
their present conditions with others that are worse, Heaven may
oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced of their former
felicity by their experience&mdash;I say, how just has it been,
that the truly solitary life I reflected on, in an island of mere
desolation, should be my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it
with the life which I then led, in which, had I continued, I had in
all probability been exceeding prosperous and rich.</p>

<p>I was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the
plantation before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took
me up at sea, went back&mdash;for the ship remained there, in
providing his lading and preparing for his voyage, nearly three
months&mdash;when telling him what little stock I had left behind
me in London, he gave me this friendly and sincere
advice:&mdash;"Seignior Inglese," says he (for so he always called
me), "if you will give me letters, and a procuration in form to me,
with orders to the person who has your money in London to send your
effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in such
goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you the produce
of them, God willing, at my return; but, since human affairs are
all subject to changes and disasters, I would have you give orders
but for one hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your
stock, and let the hazard be run for the first; so that, if it come
safe, you may order the rest the same way, and, if it miscarry, you
may have the other half to have recourse to for your supply."</p>

<p>This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I
could not but be convinced it was the best course I could take; so
I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had
left my money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he
desired.</p>

<p>I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all my
adventures&mdash;my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the
Portuguese captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what
condition I was now in, with all other necessary directions for my
supply; and when this honest captain came to Lisbon, he found
means, by some of the English merchants there, to send over, not
the order only, but a full account of my story to a merchant in
London, who represented it effectually to her; whereupon she not
only delivered the money, but out of her own pocket sent the
Portugal captain a very handsome present for his humanity and
charity to me.</p>

<p>The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in English
goods, such as the captain had written for, sent them directly to
him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to the Brazils;
among which, without my direction (for I was too young in my
business to think of them), he had taken care to have all sorts of
tools, ironwork, and utensils necessary for my plantation, and
which were of great use to me.</p>

<p>When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune made, for I was
surprised with the joy of it; and my stood steward, the captain,
had laid out the five pounds, which my friend had sent him for a
present for himself, to purchase and bring me over a servant, under
bond for six years' service, and would not accept of any
consideration, except a little tobacco, which I would have him
accept, being of my own produce.</p>

<p>Neither was this all; for my goods being all English
manufacture, such as cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly
valuable and desirable in the country, I found means to sell them
to a very great advantage; so that I might say I had more than four
times the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my
poor neighbour&mdash;I mean in the advancement of my plantation;
for the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave, and an
European servant also&mdash;I mean another besides that which the
captain brought me from Lisbon.</p>

<p>But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of
our greatest adversity, so it was with me. I went on the next year
with great success in my plantation: I raised fifty great rolls of
tobacco on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbours; and these fifty rolls, being each
of above a hundredweight, were well cured, and laid by against the
return of the fleet from Lisbon: and now increasing in business and
wealth, my head began to be full of projects and undertakings
beyond my reach; such as are, indeed, often the ruin of the best
heads in business. Had I continued in the station I was now in, I
had room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me for which
my father so earnestly recommended a quiet, retired life, and of
which he had so sensibly described the middle station of life to be
full of; but other things attended me, and I was still to be the
wilful agent of all my own miseries; and particularly, to increase
my fault, and double the reflections upon myself, which in my
future sorrows I should have leisure to make, all these
miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my
foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and pursuing that
inclination, in contradiction to the clearest views of doing myself
good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and those
measures of life, which nature and Providence concurred to present
me with, and to make my duty.</p>

<p>As I had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents, so
I could not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy view
I had of being a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only
to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the
nature of the thing admitted; and thus I cast myself down again
into the deepest gulf of human misery that ever man fell into, or
perhaps could be consistent with life and a state of health in the
world.</p>

<p>To come, then, by the just degrees to the particulars of this
part of my story. You may suppose, that having now lived almost
four years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very
well upon my plantation, I had not only learned the language, but
had contracted acquaintance and friendship among my
fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants at St. Salvador,
which was our port; and that, in my discourses among them, I had
frequently given them an account of my two voyages to the coast of
Guinea: the manner of trading with the negroes there, and how easy
it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles&mdash;such as beads,
toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the
like&mdash;not only gold-dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth,
&amp; c., but negroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great
numbers.</p>

<p>They listened always very attentively to my discourses on these
heads, but especially to that part which related to the buying of
negroes, which was a trade at that time, not only not far entered
into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on by assientos, or
permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed in the
public stock: so that few negroes were bought, and these
excessively dear.</p>

<p>It happened, being in company with some merchants and planters
of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly,
three of them came to me next morning, and told me they had been
musing very much upon what I had discoursed with them of the last
night, and they came to make a secret proposal to me; and, after
enjoining me to secrecy, they told me that they had a mind to fit
out a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all plantations as well
as I, and were straitened for nothing so much as servants; that as
it was a trade that could not be carried on, because they could not
publicly sell the negroes when they came home, so they desired to
make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately, and
divide them among their own plantations; and, in a word, the
question was whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to
manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered
me that I should have my equal share of the negroes, without
providing any part of the stock.</p>

<p>This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made
to any one that had not had a settlement and a plantation of his
own to look after, which was in a fair way of coming to be very
considerable, and with a good stock upon it; but for me, that was
thus entered and established, and had nothing to do but to go on as
I had begun, for three or four years more, and to have sent for the
other hundred pounds from England; and who in that time, and with
that little addition, could scarce have failed of being worth three
or four thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too&mdash;for
me to think of such a voyage was the most preposterous thing that
ever man in such circumstances could be guilty of.</p>

<p>But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more
resist the offer than I could restrain my first rambling designs
when my father' good counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told
them I would go with all my heart, if they would undertake to look
after my plantation in my absence, and would dispose of it to such
as I should direct, if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do,
and entered into writings or covenants to do so; and I made a
formal will, disposing of my plantation and effects in case of my
death, making the captain of the ship that had saved my life, as
before, my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my
effects as I had directed in my will; one half of the produce being
to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.</p>

<p>In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects and
to keep up my plantation. Had I used half as much prudence to have
looked into my own interest, and have made a judgment of what I
ought to have done and not to have done, I had certainly never gone
away from so prosperous an undertaking, leaving all the probable
views of a thriving circumstance, and gone upon a voyage to sea,
attended with all its common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons
I had to expect particular misfortunes to myself.</p>

<p>But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my
fancy rather than my reason; and, accordingly, the ship being
fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all things done, as by
agreement, by my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil
hour, the 1st September 1659, being the same day eight years that I
went from my father and mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel
to their authority, and the fool to my own interests.</p>

<p>Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried
six guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself.
We had on board no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as
were fit for our trade with the negroes, such as beads, bits of
glass, shells, and other trifles, especially little
looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like.</p>

<p>The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the
northward upon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the
African coast when we came about ten or twelve degrees of northern
latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of course in those days.
We had very good weather, only excessively hot, all the way upon
our own coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino;
from whence, keeping further off at sea, we lost sight of land, and
steered as if we were bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha,
holding our course N.E. by N., and leaving those isles on the east.
In this course we passed the line in about twelve days' time, and
were, by our last observation, in seven degrees twenty-two minutes
northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us
quite out of our knowledge. It began from the south-east, came
about to the north-west, and then settled in the north-east; from
whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve days
together we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding away before
it, let it carry us whither fate and the fury of the winds
directed; and, during these twelve days, I need not say that I
expected every day to be swallowed up; nor, indeed, did any in the
ship expect to save their lives.</p>

<p>In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of
our men die of the calenture, and one man and the boy washed
overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the
master made an observation as well as he could, and found that he
was in about eleven degrees north latitude, but that he was
twenty-two degrees of longitude difference west from Cape St.
Augustino; so that he found he was upon the coast of Guiana, or the
north part of Brazil, beyond the river Amazon, toward that of the
river Orinoco, commonly called the Great River; and began to
consult with me what course he should take, for the ship was leaky,
and very much disabled, and he was going directly back to the coast
of Brazil.</p>

<p>I was positively against that; and looking over the charts of
the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was no
inhabited country for us to have recourse to till we came within
the circle of the Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to stand
away for Barbadoes; which, by keeping off at sea, to avoid the
indraft of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as
we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail; whereas we could not
possibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa without some
assistance both to our ship and to ourselves.</p>

<p>With this design we changed our course, and steered away N.W. by
W., in order to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped
for relief. But our voyage was otherwise determined; for, being in
the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen minutes, a second storm
came upon us, which carried us away with the same impetuosity
westward, and drove us so out of the way of all human commerce,
that, had all our lives been saved as to the sea, we were rather in
danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own
country.</p>

<p>In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our
men early in the morning cried out, "Land!" and we had no sooner
run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in
the world we were, than the ship struck upon a sand, and in a
moment her motion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in such
a manner that we expected we should all have perished immediately;
and we were immediately driven into our close quarters, to shelter
us from the very foam and spray of the sea.</p>

<p>It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like
condition to describe or conceive the consternation of men in such
circumstances. We knew nothing where we were, or upon what land it
was we were driven&mdash;whether an island or the main, whether
inhabited or not inhabited. As the rage of the wind was still
great, though rather less than at first, we could not so much as
hope to have the ship hold many minutes without breaking into
pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of miracle, should turn
immediately about. In a word, we sat looking upon one another, and
expecting death every moment, and every man, accordingly, preparing
for another world; for there was little or nothing more for us to
do in this. That which was our present comfort, and all the comfort
we had, was that, contrary to our expectation, the ship did not
break yet, and that the master said the wind began to abate.</p>

<p>Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the
ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us
to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed,
and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as
we could. We had a boat at our stern just before the storm, but she
was first staved by dashing against the ship's rudder, and in the
next place she broke away, and either sunk or was driven off to
sea; so there was no hope from her. We had another boat on board,
but how to get her off into the sea was a doubtful thing. However,
there was no time to debate, for we fancied that the ship would
break in pieces every minute, and some told us she was actually
broken already.</p>

<p>In this distress the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat,
and with the help of the rest of the men got her slung over the
ship's side; and getting all into her, let go, and committed
ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy and the wild sea;
for though the storm was abated considerably, yet the sea ran
dreadfully high upon the shore, and might be well called <i>den
wild zee</i>, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.</p>

<p>And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly
that the sea went so high that the boat could not live, and that we
should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor
if we had could we have done anything with it; so we worked at the
oar towards the land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to
execution; for we all knew that when the boat came near the shore
she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea.
However, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest manner;
and the wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened our
destruction with our own hands, pulling as well as we could towards
land.</p>

<p>What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or
shoal, we knew not. The only hope that could rationally give us the
least shadow of expectation was, if we might find some bay or gulf,
or the mouth of some river, where by great chance we might have run
our boat in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made
smooth water. But there was nothing like this appeared; but as we
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful
than the sea.</p>

<p>After we had rowed, or rather driven about a league and a half,
as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling
astern of us, and plainly bade us expect the <i>coup de
gr&Atilde;&cent;ce</i>. It took us with such a fury, that it
overset the boat at once; and separating us as well from the boat
as from one another, gave us no time to say, "O God!" for we were
all swallowed up in a moment.</p>

<p>Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt when
I sank into the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not
deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave
having driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the
shore, and having spent itself, went back, and left me upon the
land almost dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I had so
much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself
nearer the mainland than I expected, I got upon my feet, and
endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as I could before
another wave should return and take me up again; but I soon found
it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as
high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had no
means or strength to contend with: my business was to hold my
breath, and raise myself upon the water if I could; and so, by
swimming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the
shore, if possible, my greatest concern now being that the sea, as
it would carry me a great way towards the shore when it came on,
might not carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the
sea.</p>

<p>The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or
thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried
with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore&mdash;a very
great way; but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still
forward with all my might. I was ready to burst with holding my
breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate
relief, I found my head and hands shoot out above the surface of
the water; and though it was not two seconds of time that I could
keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath, and new
courage. I was covered again with water a good while, but not so
long but I held it out; and finding the water had spent itself, and
began to return, I struck forward against the return of the waves,
and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few moments to
recover breath, and till the waters went from me, and then took to
my heels and ran with what strength I had further towards the
shore. But neither would this deliver me from the fury of the sea,
which came pouring in after me again; and twice more I was lifted
up by the waves and carried forward as before, the shore being very
flat.</p>

<p>The last time of these two had well-nigh been fatal to me, for
the sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather
dashed me, against a piece of rock, and that with such force, that
it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own
deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast, beat the
breath as it were quite out of my body; and had it returned again
immediately, I must have been strangled in the water; but I
recovered a little before the return of the waves, and seeing I
should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold fast by
a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till
the wave went back. Now, as the waves were not so high as at first,
being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then
fetched another run, which brought me so near the shore that the
next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as
to carry me away; and the next run I took, I got to the mainland,
where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the shore
and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger and quite out of
the reach of the water.</p>

<p>I was now landed and safe on shore, and began to look up and
thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein there was some
minutes before scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible
to express, to the life, what the ecstasies and transports of the
soul are, when it is so saved, as I may say, out of the very grave:
and I do not wonder now at the custom, when a malefactor, who has
the halter about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned
off, and has a reprieve brought to him&mdash;I say, I do not wonder
that they bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very
moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may not drive the
animal spirits from the heart and overwhelm him.</p>

<blockquote>"For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at
first."</blockquote>

<p>I walked about on the shore lifting up my hands, and my whole
being, as I may say, wrapped up in a contemplation of my
deliverance; making a thousand gestures and motions, which I cannot
describe; reflecting upon all my comrades that were drowned, and
that there should not be one soul saved but myself; for, as for
them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of them, except
three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not
fellows.</p>

<p>I cast my eye to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and froth
of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far of;
and considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore?</p>

<p>After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my
condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of place I
was in, and what was next to be done; and I soon found my comforts
abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was
wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or
drink to comfort me; neither did I see any prospect before me but
that of perishing with hunger or being devoured by wild beasts; and
that which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I had no
weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or
to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to
kill me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife,
a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was all my
provisions; and this threw me into such terrible agonies of mind,
that for a while I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon me, I
began with a heavy heart to consider what would be my lot if there
were any ravenous beasts in that country, as at night they always
come abroad for their prey.</p>

<p>All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time was to
get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which grew
near me, and where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the
next day what death I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of
life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see if I could
find any fresh water to drink, which I did, to my great joy; and
having drank, and put a little tobacco into my mouth to prevent
hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to
place myself so that if I should sleep I might not fall. And having
cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up
my lodging; and having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast
asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done
in my condition, and found myself more refreshed with it than, I
think, I ever was on such an occasion.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV&mdash;FIRST WEEKS ON THE ISLAND</h3>

<p>When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm
abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before. But that
which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the
night from the sand where she lay by the swelling of the tide, and
was driven up almost as far as the rock which I at first mentioned,
where I had been so bruised by the wave dashing me against it. This
being within about a mile from the shore where I was, and the ship
seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on board, that at
least I might save some necessary things for my use.</p>

<p>When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about
me again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as
the wind and the sea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two
miles on my right hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore
to have got to her; but found a neck or inlet of water between me
and the boat which was about half a mile broad; so I came back for
the present, being more intent upon getting at the ship, where I
hoped to find something for my present subsistence.</p>

<p>A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide
ebbed so far out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of
the ship. And here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw
evidently that if we had kept on board we had been all
safe&mdash;that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had
not been so miserable as to be left entirety destitute of all
comfort and company as I now was. This forced tears to my eyes
again; but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if
possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my clothes&mdash;for
the weather was hot to extremity&mdash;and took the water. But when
I came to the ship my difficulty was still greater to know how to
get on board; for, as she lay aground, and high out of the water,
there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her
twice, and the second time I spied a small piece of rope, which I
wondered I did not see at first, hung down by the fore-chains so
low, as that with great difficulty I got hold of it, and by the
help of that rope I got up into the forecastle of the ship. Here I
found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in
her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand,
or, rather earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and
her head low, almost to the water. By this means all her quarter
was free, and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be
sure my first work was to search, and to see what was spoiled and
what was free. And, first, I found that all the ship's provisions
were dry and untouched by the water, and being very well disposed
to eat, I went to the bread room and filled my pockets with
biscuit, and ate it as I went about other things, for I had no time
to lose. I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took
a large dram, and which I had, indeed, need enough of to spirit me
for what was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish
myself with many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to
me.</p>

<p>It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had;
and this extremity roused my application. We had several spare
yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or
two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and I flung
as many of them overboard as I could manage for their weight, tying
every one with a rope, that they might not drive away. When this
was done I went down the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I
tied four of them together at both ends as well as I could, in the
form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon
them crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it
was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being too light.
So I went to work, and with a carpenter's saw I cut a spare topmast
into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great deal of
labour and pains. But the hope of furnishing myself with
necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I should have been able
to have done upon another occasion.</p>

<p>My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. My
next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid
upon it from the surf of the sea; but I was not long considering
this. I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that I could
get, and having considered well what I most wanted, I got three of
the seamen's chests, which I had broken open, and emptied, and
lowered them down upon my raft; the first of these I filled with
provisions&mdash;viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces
of dried goat's flesh (which we lived much upon), and a little
remainder of European corn, which had been laid by for some fowls
which we brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed. There
had been some barley and wheat together; but, to my great
disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten or
spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several, cases of bottles
belonging to our skipper, in which were some cordial waters; and,
in all, about five or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by
themselves, there being no need to put them into the chest, nor any
room for them. While I was doing this, I found the tide begin to
flow, though very calm; and I had the mortification to see my coat,
shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on the shore, upon the sand,
swim away. As for my breeches, which were only linen, and
open-kneed, I swam on board in them and my stockings. However, this
set me on rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough, but took
no more than I wanted for present use, for I had others things
which my eye was more upon&mdash;as, first, tools to work with on
shore. And it was after long searching that I found out the
carpenter's chest, which was, indeed, a very useful prize to me,
and much more valuable than a shipload of gold would have been at
that time. I got it down to my raft, whole as it was, without
losing time to look into it, for I knew in general what it
contained.</p>

<p>My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were two
very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols. These
I secured first, with some powder-horns and a small bag of shot,
and two old rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder
in the ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed them; but
with much search I found them, two of them dry and good, the third
had taken water. Those two I got to my raft with the arms. And now
I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to think how I
should get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor
rudder; and the least capful of wind would have overset all my
navigation.</p>

<p>I had three encouragements&mdash;1st, a smooth, calm sea; 2ndly,
the tide rising, and setting in to the shore; 3rdly, what little
wind there was blew me towards the land. And thus, having found two
or three broken oars belonging to the boat&mdash;and, besides the
tools which were in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, and a
hammer; with this cargo I put to sea. For a mile or thereabouts my
raft went very well, only that I found it drive a little distant
from the place where I had landed before; by which I perceived that
there was some indraft of the water, and consequently I hoped to
find some creek or river there, which I might make use of as a port
to get to land with my cargo.</p>

<p>As I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a little
opening of the land, and I found a strong current of the tide set
into it; so I guided my raft as well as I could, to keep in the
middle of the stream.</p>

<p>But here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which,
if I had, I think verily would have broken my heart; for, knowing
nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a
shoal, and not being aground at the other end, it wanted but a
little that all my cargo had slipped off towards the end that was
afloat, and to fallen into the water. I did my utmost, by setting
my back against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could
not thrust off the raft with all my strength; neither durst I stir
from the posture I was in; but holding up the chests with all my
might, I stood in that manner near half-an-hour, in which time the
rising of the water brought me a little more upon a level; and a
little after, the water still-rising, my raft floated again, and I
thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel, and then
driving up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a
little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current of tide
running up. I looked on both sides for a proper place to get to
shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up the river:
hoping in time to see some ships at sea, and therefore resolved to
place myself as near the coast as I could.</p>

<p>At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek,
to which with great pain and difficulty I guided my raft, and at
last got so near that, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust
her directly in. But here I had like to have dipped all my cargo
into the sea again; for that shore lying pretty steep&mdash;that is
to say sloping&mdash;there was no place to land, but where one end
of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and the other
sink lower, as before, that it would endanger my cargo again. All
that I could do was to wait till the tide was at the highest,
keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor, to hold the side of it
fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected
the water would flow over; and so it did. As soon as I found water
enough&mdash;for my raft drew about a foot of water&mdash;I thrust
her upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored
her, by sticking my two broken oars into the ground, one on one
side near one end, and one on the other side near the other end;
and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all
my cargo safe on shore.</p>

<p>My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place
for my habitation, and where to stow my goods to secure them from
whatever might happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the
continent or on an island; whether inhabited or not inhabited;
whether in danger of wild beasts or not. There was a hill not above
a mile from me, which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed
to overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge from it
northward. I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the
pistols, and a horn of powder; and thus armed, I travelled for
discovery up to the top of that hill, where, after I had with great
labour and difficulty got to the top, I saw my fate, to my great
affliction&mdash;viz. that I was in an island environed every way
with the sea: no land to be seen except some rocks, which lay a
great way off; and two small islands, less than this, which lay
about three leagues to the west.</p>

<p>I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw
good reason to believe, uninhabited except by wild beasts, of whom,
however, I saw none. Yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not
their kinds; neither when I killed them could I tell what was fit
for food, and what not. At my coming back, I shot at a great bird
which I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a great wood. I
believe it was the first gun that had been fired there since the
creation of the world. I had no sooner fired, than from all parts
of the wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls, of many
sorts, making a confused screaming and crying, and every one
according to his usual note, but not one of them of any kind that I
knew. As for the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of hawk,
its colour and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or claws
more than common. Its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.</p>

<p>Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell
to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of
that day. What to do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed
where to rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the ground, not
knowing but some wild beast might devour me, though, as I
afterwards found, there was really no need for those fears.</p>

<p>However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with the
chest and boards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind of
hut for that night's lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which way
to supply myself, except that I had seen two or three creatures
like hares run out of the wood where I shot the fowl.</p>

<p>I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many things
out of the ship which would be useful to me, and particularly some
of the rigging and sails, and such other things as might come to
land; and I resolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if
possible. And as I knew that the first storm that blew must
necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all other
things apart till I had got everything out of the ship that I could
get. Then I called a council&mdash;that is to say in my
thoughts&mdash;whether I should take back the raft; but this
appeared impracticable: so I resolved to go as before, when the
tide was down; and I did so, only that I stripped before I went
from my hut, having nothing on but my chequered shirt, a pair of
linen drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.</p>

<p>I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft;
and, having had experience of the first, I neither made this so
unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several
things very useful to me; as first, in the carpenters stores I
found two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a great
screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above all, that most
useful thing called a grindstone. All these I secured, together
with several things belonging to the gunner, particularly two or
three iron crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets,
another fowling-piece, with some small quantity of powder more; a
large bagful of small shot, and a great roll of sheet-lead; but
this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over the
ship's side.</p>

<p>Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could
find, and a spare fore-topsail, a hammock, and some bedding; and
with this I loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe on
shore, to my very great comfort.</p>

<p>I was under some apprehension, during my absence from the land,
that at least my provisions might be devoured on shore: but when I
came back I found no sign of any visitor; only there sat a creature
like a wild cat upon one of the chests, which, when I came towards
it, ran away a little distance, and then stood still. She sat very
composed and unconcerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had
a mind to be acquainted with me. I presented my gun at her, but, as
she did not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor
did she offer to stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit of
biscuit, though by the way, I was not very free of it, for my store
was not great: however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she went to
it, smelled at it, and ate it, and looked (as if pleased) for more;
but I thanked her, and could spare no more: so she marched off.</p>

<p>Having got my second cargo on shore&mdash;though I was fain to
open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they
were too heavy, being large casks&mdash;I went to work to make me a
little tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for that
purpose: and into this tent I brought everything that I knew would
spoil either with rain or sun; and I piled all the empty chests and
casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from any sudden
attempt, either from man or beast.</p>

<p>When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with
some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end without; and
spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols
just at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to bed for the
first time, and slept very quietly all night, for I was very weary
and heavy; for the night before I had slept little, and had
laboured very hard all day to fetch all those things from the ship,
and to get them on shore.</p>

<p>I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid
up, I believe, for one man: but I was not satisfied still, for
while the ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to
get everything out of her that I could; so every day at low water I
went on board, and brought away something or other; but
particularly the third time I went I brought away as much of the
rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope-twine I
could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the
sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I
brought away all the sails, first and last; only that I was fain to
cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could, for
they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only.</p>

<p>But that which comforted me more still, was, that last of all,
after I had made five or six such voyages as these, and thought I
had nothing more to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling
with&mdash;I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead of
bread, three large runlets of rum, or spirits, a box of sugar, and
a barrel of fine flour; this was surprising to me, because I had
given over expecting any more provisions, except what was spoiled
by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead of the bread, and wrapped
it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cut out;
and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore also.</p>

<p>The next day I made another voyage, and now, having plundered
the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the
cables. Cutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could move,
I got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the ironwork I
could get; and having cut down the spritsail-yard, and the
mizzen-yard, and everything I could, to make a large raft, I loaded
it with all these heavy goods, and came away. But my good luck
began now to leave me; for this raft was so unwieldy, and so
overladen, that, after I had entered the little cove where I had
landed the rest of my goods, not being able to guide it so handily
as I did the other, it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into
the water. As for myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the
shore; but as to my cargo, it was a great part of it lost,
especially the iron, which I expected would have been of great use
to me; however, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of
the cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite
labour; for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which
fatigued me very much. After this, I went every day on board, and
brought away what I could get.</p>

<p>I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven times
on board the ship, in which time I had brought away all that one
pair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring; though I
believe verily, had the calm weather held, I should have brought
away the whole ship, piece by piece. But preparing the twelfth time
to go on board, I found the wind began to rise: however, at low
water I went on board, and though I thought I had rummaged the
cabin so effectually that nothing more could be found, yet I
discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of which I found two
or three razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a
dozen of good knives and forks: in another I found about thirty-six
pounds value in money&mdash;some European coin, some Brazil, some
pieces of eight, some gold, and some silver.</p>

<p>I smiled to myself at the sight of this money: "O drug!" said I,
aloud, "what art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me&mdash;no,
not the taking off the ground; one of those knives is worth all
this heap; I have no manner of use for thee&mdash;e'en remain where
thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose life is not
worth saying." However, upon second thoughts I took it away; and
wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I began to think of making
another raft; but while I was preparing this, I found the sky
overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour
it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently occurred to me
that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind
offshore; and that it was my business to be gone before the tide of
flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at
all. Accordingly, I let myself down into the water, and swam across
the channel, which lay between the ship and the sands, and even
that with difficulty enough, partly with the weight of the things I
had about me, and partly the roughness of the water; for the wind
rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water it blew a
storm.</p>

<p>But I had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my
wealth about me, very secure. It blew very hard all night, and in
the morning, when I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be
seen! I was a little surprised, but recovered myself with the
satisfactory reflection that I had lost no time, nor abated any
diligence, to get everything out of her that could be useful to me;
and that, indeed, there was little left in her that I was able to
bring away, if I had had more time.</p>

<p>I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything
out of her, except what might drive on shore from her wreck; as,
indeed, divers pieces of her afterwards did; but those things were
of small use to me.</p>

<p>My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself
against either savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if
any were in the island; and I had many thoughts of the method how
to do this, and what kind of dwelling to make&mdash;whether I
should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth; and,
in short, I resolved upon both; the manner and description of
which, it may not be improper to give an account of.</p>

<p>I soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settlement,
because it was upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I
believed it would not be wholesome, and more particularly because
there was no fresh water near it; so I resolved to find a more
healthy and more convenient spot of ground.</p>

<p>I consulted several things in my situation, which I found would
he proper for me: 1st, health and fresh water, I just now
mentioned; 2ndly, shelter from the heat of the sun; 3rdly, security
from ravenous creatures, whether man or beast; 4thly, a view to the
sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, I might not lose any
advantage for my deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish
all my expectation yet.</p>

<p>In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on
the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain
was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me
from the top. On the one side of the rock there was a hollow place,
worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave but there
was not really any cave or way into the rock at all.</p>

<p>On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I
resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred yards
broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a green before my
door; and, at the end of it, descended irregularly every way down
into the low ground by the seaside. It was on the N.N.W. side of
the hill; so that it was sheltered from the heat every day, till it
came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those
countries, is near the setting.</p>

<p>Before I set up my tent I drew a half-circle before the hollow
place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the
rock, and twenty yards in its diameter from its beginning and
ending.</p>

<p>In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving
them into the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the
biggest end being out of the ground above five feet and a half, and
sharpened on the top. The two rows did not stand above six inches
from one another.</p>

<p>Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and
laid them in rows, one upon another, within the circle, between
these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in
the inside, leaning against them, about two feet and a half high,
like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong, that neither
man nor beast could get into it or over it. This cost me a great
deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods,
bring them to the place, and drive them into the earth.</p>

<p>The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door, but by
a short ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in, I
lifted over after me; and so I was completely fenced in and
fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and consequently slept
secure in the night, which otherwise I could not have done; though,
as it appeared afterwards, there was no need of all this caution
from the enemies that I apprehended danger from.</p>

<p>Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all
my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you
have the account above; and I made a large tent, which to preserve
me from the rains that in one part of the year are very violent
there, I made double&mdash;one smaller tent within, and one larger
tent above it; and covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin,
which I had saved among the sails.</p>

<p>And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had brought
on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and
belonged to the mate of the ship.</p>

<p>Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything that
would spoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my goods, I
made up the entrance, which till now I had left open, and so passed
and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.</p>

<p>When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and
bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through my
tent, I laid them up within my fence, in the nature of a terrace,
so that it raised the ground within about a foot and a half; and
thus I made me a cave, just behind my tent, which served me like a
cellar to my house.</p>

<p>It cost me much labour and many days before all these things
were brought to perfection; and therefore I must go back to some
other things which took up some of my thoughts. At the same time it
happened, after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent,
and making the cave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick,
dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that a
great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of it. I was not
so much surprised with the lightning as I was with the thought
which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning
itself&mdash;Oh, my powder! My very heart sank within me when I
thought that, at one blast, all my powder might be destroyed; on
which, not my defence only, but the providing my food, as I
thought, entirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious about my
own danger, though, had the powder took fire, I should never have
known who had hurt me.</p>

<p>Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm was
over I laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and
applied myself to make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and
to keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in the hope that,
whatever might come, it might not all take fire at once; and to
keep it so apart that it should not be possible to make one part
fire another. I finished this work in about a fortnight; and I
think my powder, which in all was about two hundred and forty
pounds weight, was divided in not less than a hundred parcels. As
to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any danger
from that; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, I
called my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down in holes among
the rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully
where I laid it.</p>

<p>In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once at
least every day with my gun, as well to divert myself as to see if
I could kill anything fit for food; and, as near as I could, to
acquaint myself with what the island produced. The first time I
went out, I presently discovered that there were goats in the
island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but then it was
attended with this misfortune to me&mdash;viz. that they were so
shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most
difficult thing in the world to come at them; but I was not
discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and then shoot
one, as it soon happened; for after I had found their haunts a
little, I laid wait in this manner for them: I observed if they saw
me in the valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run
away, as in a terrible fright; but if they were feeding in the
valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from
whence I concluded that, by the position of their optics, their
sight was so directed downward that they did not readily see
objects that were above them; so afterwards I took this
method&mdash;I always climbed the rocks first, to get above them,
and then had frequently a fair mark.</p>

<p>The first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a
she-goat, which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to,
which grieved me heartily; for when the old one fell, the kid stood
stock still by her, till I came and took her up; and not only so,
but when I carried the old one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid
followed me quite to my enclosure; upon which I laid down the dam,
and took the kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes
to have bred it up tame; but it would not eat; so I was forced to
kill it and eat it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a great
while, for I ate sparingly, and saved my provisions, my bread
especially, as much as possibly I could.</p>

<p>Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary
to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn: and what I
did for that, and also how I enlarged my cave, and what
conveniences I made, I shall give a full account of in its place;
but I must now give some little account of myself, and of my
thoughts about living, which, it may well be supposed, were not a
few.</p>

<p>I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not cast
away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a
violent storm, quite out of the course of our intended voyage, and
a great way, viz. some hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary
course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to consider it
as a determination of Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in
this desolate manner, I should end my life. The tears would run
plentifully down my face when I made these reflections; and
sometimes I would expostulate with myself why Providence should
thus completely ruin His creatures, and render them so absolutely
miserable; so without help, abandoned, so entirely depressed, that
it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life.</p>

<p>But something always returned swift upon me to check these
thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly one day, walking with
my gun in my hand by the seaside, I was very pensive upon the
subject of my present condition, when reason, as it were,
expostulated with me the other way, thus: "Well, you are in a
desolate condition, it is true; but, pray remember, where are the
rest of you? Did not you come, eleven of you in the boat? Where are
the ten? Why were they not saved, and you lost? Why were you
singled out? Is it better to be here or there?" And then I pointed
to the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good that is in
them, and with what worse attends them.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my
subsistence, and what would have been my case if it had not
happened (which was a hundred thousand to one) that the ship
floated from the place where she first struck, and was driven so
near to the shore that I had time to get all these things out of
her; what would have been my case, if I had been forced to have
lived in the condition in which I at first came on shore, without
necessaries of life, or necessaries to supply and procure them?
"Particularly," said I, aloud (though to myself), "what should I
have done without a gun, without ammunition, without any tools to
make anything, or to work with, without clothes, bedding, a tent,
or any manner of covering?" and that now I had all these to
sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in
such a manner as to live without my gun, when my ammunition was
spent: so that I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without any
want, as long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning how I
would provide for the accidents that might happen, and for the time
that was to come, even not only after my ammunition should be
spent, but even after my health and strength should decay.</p>

<p>I confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition
being destroyed at one blast&mdash;I mean my powder being blown up
by lightning; and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me,
when it lightened and thundered, as I observed just now.</p>

<p>And now being about to enter into a melancholy relation of a
scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the
world before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it
in its order. It was by my account the 30th of September, when, in
the manner as above said, I first set foot upon this horrid island;
when the sun, being to us in its autumnal equinox, was almost over
my head; for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the
latitude of nine degrees twenty-two minutes north of the line.</p>

<p>After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my
thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books,
and pen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days; but to
prevent this, I cut with my knife upon a large post, in capital
letters&mdash;and making it into a great cross, I set it up on the
shore where I first landed&mdash;"I came on shore here on the 30th
September 1659."</p>

<p>Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with
my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest,
and every first day of the month as long again as that long one;
and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly
reckoning of time.</p>

<p>In the next place, we are to observe that among the many things
which I brought out of the ship, in the several voyages which, as
above mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value,
but not at all less useful to me, which I omitted setting down
before; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcels in
the captain's, mate's, gunner's and carpenter's keeping; three or
four compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives,
charts, and books of navigation, all which I huddled together,
whether I might want them or no; also, I found three very good
Bibles, which came to me in my cargo from England, and which I had
packed up among my things; some Portuguese books also; and among
them two or three Popish prayer-books, and several other books, all
which I carefully secured. And I must not forget that we had in the
ship a dog and two cats, of whose eminent history I may have
occasion to say something in its place; for I carried both the cats
with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship of himself,
and swam on shore to me the day after I went on shore with my first
cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many years; I wanted nothing
that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could make up to
me; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not do. As
I observed before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded
them to the utmost; and I shall show that while my ink lasted, I
kept things very exact, but after that was gone I could not, for I
could not make any ink by any means that I could devise.</p>

<p>And this put me in mind that I wanted many things
notwithstanding all that I had amassed together; and of these, ink
was one; as also a spade, pickaxe, and shovel, to dig or remove the
earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I soon learned to
want that without much difficulty.</p>

<p>This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; and it
was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my little
pale, or surrounded my habitation. The piles, or stakes, which were
as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and
preparing in the woods, and more, by far, in bringing home; so that
I spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home one of
those posts, and a third day in driving it into the ground; for
which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last
bethought myself of one of the iron crows; which, however, though I
found it, made driving those posts or piles very laborious and
tedious work. But what need I have been concerned at the
tediousness of anything I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do
it in? nor had I any other employment, if that had been over, at
least that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek
for food, which I did, more or less, every day.</p>

<p>I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the
circumstances I was reduced to; and I drew up the state of my
affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any that were to
come after me&mdash;for I was likely to have but few heirs&mdash;as
to deliver my thoughts from daily poring over them, and afflicting
my mind; and as my reason began now to master my despondency, I
began to comfort myself as well as I could, and to set the good
against the evil, that I might have something to distinguish my
case from worse; and I stated very impartially, like debtor and
creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I suffered,
thus:&mdash;<br>
<br></p>

<p><i>Evil</i>. vs. <i>Good</i>.</p>

<p>- I am cast upon a horrible, desolate island, void of all hope
of recovery.</p>

<p>+ But I am alive; and not drowned, as all my ship's company
were.</p>

<p>- I am singled out and separated, as it were, from all the
world, to be miserable.</p>

<p>+ But I am singled out, too, from all the ship's crew, to be
spared from death; and He that miraculously saved me from death can
deliver me from this condition.</p>

<p>- I am divided from mankind&mdash;a solitaire; one banished from
human society.</p>

<p>+ But I am not starved, and perishing on a barren place,
affording no sustenance.</p>

<p>- I have no clothes to cover me.</p>

<p>+ But I am in a hot climate, where, if I had clothes, I could
hardly wear them.</p>

<p>- I am without any defence, or means to resist any violence of
man or beast.</p>

<p>+ But I am cast on an island where I see no wild beasts to hurt
me, as I saw on the coast of Africa; and what if I had been
shipwrecked there?</p>

<p>- I have no soul to speak to or relieve me.</p>

<p>+ But God wonderfully sent the ship in near enough to the shore,
that I have got out as many necessary things as will either supply
my wants or enable me to supply myself, even as long as I live.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony that there was
scarce any condition in the world so miserable but there was
something negative or something positive to be thankful for in it;
and let this stand as a direction from the experience of the most
miserable of all conditions in this world: that we may always find
in it something to comfort ourselves from, and to set, in the
description of good and evil, on the credit side of the
account.</p>

<p>Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and
given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship&mdash;I
say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself to arrange
my way of living, and to make things as easy to me as I could.</p>

<p>I have already described my habitation, which was a tent under
the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and
cables: but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind
of wall up against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the
outside; and after some time (I think it was a year and a half) I
raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or
covered it with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get, to
keep out the rain; which I found at some times of the year very
violent.</p>

<p>I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this
pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me. But I must
observe, too, that at first this was a confused heap of goods,
which, as they lay in no order, so they took up all my place; I had
no room to turn myself: so I set myself to enlarge my cave, and
work farther into the earth; for it was a loose sandy rock, which
yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on it: and so when I found
I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the
right hand, into the rock; and then, turning to the right again,
worked quite out, and made me a door to come out on the outside of
my pale or fortification. This gave me not only egress and regress,
as it was a back way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me
room to store my goods.</p>

<p>And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as
I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for
without these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the
world; I could not write or eat, or do several things, with so much
pleasure without a table: so I went to work. And here I must needs
observe, that as reason is the substance and origin of the
mathematics, so by stating and squaring everything by reason, and
by making the most rational judgment of things, every man may be,
in time, master of every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool
in my life; and yet, in time, by labour, application, and
contrivance, I found at last that I wanted nothing but I could have
made it, especially if I had had tools. However, I made abundance
of things, even without tools; and some with no more tools than an
adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way before,
and that with infinite labour. For example, if I wanted a board, I
had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before
me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I brought it
to be thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is
true, by this method I could make but one board out of a whole
tree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I
had for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took me up
to make a plank or board: but my time or labour was little worth,
and so it was as well employed one way as another.</p>

<p>However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in
the first place; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards
that I brought on my raft from the ship. But when I had wrought out
some boards as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth of a
foot and a half, one over another all along one side of my cave, to
lay all my tools, nails and ironwork on; and, in a word, to
separate everything at large into their places, that I might come
easily at them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang
my guns and all things that would hang up; so that, had my cave
been to be seen, it looked like a general magazine of all necessary
things; and had everything so ready at my hand, that it was a great
pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, and especially to
find my stock of all necessaries so great.</p>

<p>And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day's
employment; for, indeed, at first I was in too much hurry, and not
only hurry as to labour, but in too much discomposure of mind; and
my journal would have been full of many dull things; for example, I
must have said thus: "30<i>th</i>.&mdash;After I had got to shore,
and escaped drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my
deliverance, having first vomited, with the great quantity of salt
water which had got into my stomach, and recovering myself a
little, I ran about the shore wringing my hands and beating my head
and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying out, 'I was undone,
undone!' till, tired and faint, I was forced to lie down on the
ground to repose, but durst not sleep for fear of being
devoured."</p>

<p>Some days after this, and after I had been on board the ship,
and got all that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear
getting up to the top of a little mountain and looking out to sea,
in hopes of seeing a ship; then fancy at a vast distance I spied a
sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and then after looking
steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down and
weep like a child, and thus increase my misery by my folly.</p>

<p>But having gotten over these things in some measure, and having
settled my household staff and habitation, made me a table and a
chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my
journal; of which I shall here give you the copy (though in it will
be told all these particulars over again) as long as it lasted; for
having no more ink, I was forced to leave it off.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V&mdash;BUILDS A HOUSE&mdash;THE JOURNAL</h3>

<p>September 30, 1659.&mdash;I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe,
being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm in the offing, came on
shore on this dismal, unfortunate island, which I called "The
Island of Despair"; all the rest of the ship's company being
drowned, and myself almost dead.</p>

<p>All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the
dismal circumstances I was brought to&mdash;viz. I had neither
food, house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to; and in despair
of any relief, saw nothing but death before me&mdash;either that I
should be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved
to death for want of food. At the approach of night I slept in a
tree, for fear of wild creatures; but slept soundly, though it
rained all night.</p>

<p><i>October</i> 1.&mdash;In the morning I saw, to my great
surprise, the ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven
on shore again much nearer the island; which, as it was some
comfort, on one hand&mdash;for, seeing her set upright, and not
broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on
board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my
relief&mdash;so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss
of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board,
might have saved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have
been all drowned as they were; and that, had the men been saved, we
might perhaps have built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship to
have carried us to some other part of the world. I spent great part
of this day in perplexing myself on these things; but at length,
seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I
could, and then swam on board. This day also it continued raining,
though with no wind at all.</p>

<p><i>From the 1st of October to the 24th</i>.&mdash;All these days
entirely spent in many several voyages to get all I could out of
the ship, which I brought on shore every tide of flood upon rafts.
Much rain also in the days, though with some intervals of fair
weather; but it seems this was the rainy season.</p>

<p><i>Oct.</i> 20.&mdash;I overset my raft, and all the goods I had
got upon it; but, being in shoal water, and the things being
chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide was out.</p>

<p><i>Oct.</i> 25.&mdash;It rained all night and all day, with some
gusts of wind; during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind
blowing a little harder than before, and was no more to be seen,
except the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I spent this
day in covering and securing the goods which I had saved, that the
rain might not spoil them.</p>

<p><i>Oct.</i> 26.&mdash;I walked about the shore almost all day,
to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to
secure myself from any attack in the night, either from wild beasts
or men. Towards night, I fixed upon a proper place, under a rock,
and marked out a semicircle for my encampment; which I resolved to
strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification, made of double
piles, lined within with cables, and without with turf.</p>

<p>From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in carrying all my
goods to my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained
exceedingly hard.</p>

<p>The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with my
gun, to seek for some food, and discover the country; when I killed
a she-goat, and her kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed
also, because it would not feed.</p>

<p><i>November</i> 1.&mdash;I set up my tent under a rock, and lay
there for the first night; making it as large as I could, with
stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> 2.&mdash;I set up all my chests and boards, and the
pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence
round me, a little within the place I had marked out for my
fortification.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> 3.&mdash;I went out with my gun, and killed two
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon went
to work to make me a table.</p>

<p><i>Nov</i>. 4.&mdash;This morning I began to order my times of
work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of
diversion&mdash;viz. every morning I walked out with my gun for two
or three hours, if it did not rain; then employed myself to work
till about eleven o'clock; then eat what I had to live on; and from
twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being excessively
hot; and then, in the evening, to work again. The working part of
this day and of the next were wholly employed in making my table,
for I was yet but a very sorry workman, though time and necessity
made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe they
would do any one else.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> 5.&mdash;This day went abroad with my gun and my
dog, and killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh
good for nothing; every creature that I killed I took of the skins
and preserved them. Coming back by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts
of sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but was surprised, and
almost frightened, with two or three seals, which, while I was
gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got into the sea, and
escaped me for that time.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> 6.&mdash;After my morning walk I went to work with
my table again, and finished it, though not to my liking; nor was
it long before I learned to mend it.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> 7.&mdash;Now it began to be settled fair weather.
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was
Sunday) I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado
brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me; and even
in the making I pulled it in pieces several times.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for,
omitting my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> 13.&mdash;This day it rained, which refreshed me
exceedingly, and cooled the earth; but it was accompanied with
terrible thunder and lightning, which frightened me dreadfully, for
fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved to separate
my stock of powder into as many little parcels as possible, that it
might not be in danger.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> 14, 15, 16.&mdash;These three days I spent in making
little square chests, or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or
two pounds at most, of powder; and so, putting the powder in, I
stowed it in places as secure and remote from one another as
possible. On one of these three days I killed a large bird that was
good to eat, but I knew not what to call it.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> 17.&mdash;This day I began to dig behind my tent
into the rock, to make room for my further conveniency.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;Three things I wanted exceedingly for this
work&mdash;viz. a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow or basket;
so I desisted from my work, and began to consider how to supply
that want, and make me some tools. As for the pickaxe, I made use
of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy; but the
next thing was a shovel or spade; this was so absolutely necessary,
that, indeed, I could do nothing effectually without it; but what
kind of one to make I knew not.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> 18.&mdash;The next day, in searching the woods, I
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in the Brazils they
call the iron-tree, for its exceeding hardness. Of this, with great
labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it
home, too, with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy. The
excessive hardness of the wood, and my having no other way, made me
a long while upon this machine, for I worked it effectually by
little and little into the form of a shovel or spade; the handle
exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the board part
having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me so
long; however, it served well enough for the uses which I had
occasion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made
after that fashion, or so long in making.</p>

<p>I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow. A
basket I could not make by any means, having no such things as
twigs that would bend to make wicker-ware&mdash;at least, none yet
found out; and as to a wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but
the wheel; but that I had no notion of; neither did I know how to
go about it; besides, I had no possible way to make the iron
gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in; so I gave
it over, and so, for carrying away the earth which I dug out of the
cave, I made me a thing like a hod which the labourers carry mortar
in when they serve the bricklayers. This was not so difficult to me
as the making the shovel: and yet this and the shovel, and the
attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no
less than four days&mdash;I mean always excepting my morning walk
with my gun, which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed also
bringing home something fit to eat.</p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> 23.&mdash;My other work having now stood still,
because of my making these tools, when they were finished I went
on, and working every day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent
eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it
might hold my goods commodiously.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;During all this time I worked to make this
room or cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or
magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for my
lodging, I kept to the tent; except that sometimes, in the wet
season of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep myself
dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my place within my
pale with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning against the
rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of trees, like a
thatch.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 10.&mdash;I began now to think my cave or vault
finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a
great quantity of earth fell down from the top on one side; so much
that, in short, it frighted me, and not without reason, too, for if
I had been under it, I had never wanted a gravedigger. I had now a
great deal of work to do over again, for I had the loose earth to
carry out; and, which was of more importance, I had the ceiling to
prop up, so that I might be sure no more would come down.</p>

<p><i>Dec</i>. 11.&mdash;This day I went to work with it
accordingly, and got two shores or posts pitched upright to the
top, with two pieces of boards across over each post; this I
finished the next day; and setting more posts up with boards, in
about a week more I had the roof secured, and the posts, standing
in rows, served me for partitions to part off the house.</p>

<p><i>Dec.</i> 17.&mdash;From this day to the 20th I placed
shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts, to hang everything up
that could be hung up; and now I began to be in some order within
doors.</p>

<p><i>Dec.</i> 20.&mdash;Now I carried everything into the cave,
and began to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards
like a dresser, to order my victuals upon; but boards began to be
very scarce with me; also, I made me another table.</p>

<p><i>Dec.</i> 24.&mdash;Much rain all night and all day. No
stirring out.</p>

<p><i>Dec.</i> 25.&mdash;Rain all day.</p>

<p><i>Dec.</i> 26.&mdash;No rain, and the earth much cooler than
before, and pleasanter.</p>

<p><i>Dec.</i> 27.&mdash;Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so
that I caught it and led it home in a string; when I had it at
home, I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;I took such care of it that it lived, and the
leg grew well and as strong as ever; but, by my nursing it so long,
it grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and would
not go away. This was the first time that I entertained a thought
of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food when my
powder and shot was all spent.</p>

<p><i>Dec.</i> 28,29,30,31.&mdash;Great heats, and no breeze, so
that there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food;
this time I spent in putting all my things in order within
doors.</p>

<p><i>January</i> 1.&mdash;Very hot still: but I went abroad early
and late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This
evening, going farther into the valleys which lay towards the
centre of the island, I found there were plenty of goats, though
exceedingly shy, and hard to come at; however, I resolved to try if
I could not bring my dog to hunt them down.</p>

<p><i>Jan.</i> 2.&mdash;Accordingly, the next day I went out with
my dog, and set him upon the goats, but I was mistaken, for they
all faced about upon the dog, and he knew his danger too well, for
he would not come near them.</p>

<p><i>Jan.</i> 3.&mdash;I began my fence or wall; which, being
still jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make
very thick and strong.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;This wall being described before, I purposely
omit what was said in the journal; it is sufficient to observe,
that I was no less time than from the 2nd of January to the 14th of
April working, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it was
no more than about twenty-four yards in length, being a half-circle
from one place in the rock to another place, about eight yards from
it, the door of the cave being in the centre behind it.</p>

<p>All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me many
days, nay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I should never
be perfectly secure till this wall was finished; and it is scarce
credible what inexpressible labour everything was done with,
especially the bringing piles out of the woods and driving them
into the ground; for I made them much bigger than I needed to have
done.</p>

<p>When this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced, with
a turf wall raised up close to it, I perceived myself that if any
people were to come on shore there, they would not perceive
anything like a habitation; and it was very well I did so, as may
be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable occasion.</p>

<p>During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game every
day when the rain permitted me, and made frequent discoveries in
these walks of something or other to my advantage; particularly, I
found a kind of wild pigeons, which build, not as wood-pigeons in a
tree, but rather as house-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks; and
taking some young ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and
did so; but when they grew older they flew away, which perhaps was
at first for want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them;
however, I frequently found their nests, and got their young ones,
which were very good meat. And now, in the managing my household
affairs, I found myself wanting in many things, which I thought at
first it was impossible for me to make; as, indeed, with some of
them it was: for instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped.
I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before; but I could
never arrive at the capacity of making one by them, though I spent
many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, or join the
staves so true to one another as to make them hold water; so I gave
that also over. In the next place, I was at a great loss for
candles; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally
by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump
of beeswax with which I made candles in my African adventure; but I
had none of that now; the only remedy I had was, that when I had
killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little dish made of
clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some
oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave me light, though not a
clear, steady light, like a candle. In the middle of all my labours
it happened that, rummaging my things, I found a little bag which,
as I hinted before, had been filled with corn for the feeding of
poultry&mdash;not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when
the ship came from Lisbon. The little remainder of corn that had
been in the bag was all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing in
the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to have the bag for
some other use (I think it was to put powder in, when I divided it
for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook the husks of
corn out of it on one side of my fortification, under the rock.</p>

<p>It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that I
threw this stuff away, taking no notice, and not so much as
remembering that I had thrown anything there, when, about a month
after, or thereabouts, I saw some few stalks of something green
shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might be some plant I
had not seen; but I was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when,
after a little longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come
out, which were perfect green barley, of the same kind as our
European&mdash;nay, as our English barley.</p>

<p>It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my
thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no religious
foundation at all; indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my
head, nor had entertained any sense of anything that had befallen
me otherwise than as chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases
God, without so much as inquiring into the end of Providence in
these things, or His order in governing events for the world. But
after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I knew was not
proper for corn, and especially that I knew not how it came there,
it startled me strangely, and I began to suggest that God had
miraculously caused His grain to grow without any help of seed
sown, and that it was so directed purely for my sustenance on that
wild, miserable place.</p>

<p>This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my
eyes, and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature
should happen upon my account; and this was the more strange to me,
because I saw near it still, all along by the side of the rock,
some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice,
and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa when I was
ashore there.</p>

<p>I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for
my support, but not doubting that there was more in the place, I
went all over that part of the island, where I had been before,
peering in every corner, and under every rock, to see for more of
it, but I could not find any. At last it occurred to my thoughts
that I shook a bag of chickens' meat out in that place; and then
the wonder began to cease; and I must confess my religious
thankfulness to God's providence began to abate, too, upon the
discovering that all this was nothing but what was common; though I
ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen a
providence as if it had been miraculous; for it was really the work
of Providence to me, that should order or appoint that ten or
twelve grains of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had
destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven; as
also, that I should throw it out in that particular place, where,
it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately;
whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else at that time, it had been
burnt up and destroyed.</p>

<p>I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in
their season, which was about the end of June; and, laying up every
corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have some
quantity sufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not till
the fourth year that I could allow myself the least grain of this
corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall say
afterwards, in its order; for I lost all that I sowed the first
season by not observing the proper time; for I sowed it just before
the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least not as it
would have done; of which in its place.</p>

<p>Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care and for the
same use, or to the same purpose&mdash;to make me bread, or rather
food; for I found ways to cook it without baking, though I did that
also after some time.</p>

<p>But to return to my Journal.</p>

<p>I worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my
wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go
into it, not by a door but over the wall, by a ladder, that there
might be no sign on the outside of my habitation.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 16.&mdash;I finished the ladder; so I went up the
ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down
in the inside. This was a complete enclosure to me; for within I
had room enough, and nothing could come at me from without, unless
it could first mount my wall.</p>

<p>The very next day after this wall was finished I had almost had
all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed. The case was
thus: As I was busy in the inside, behind my tent, just at the
entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted with a most
dreadful, surprising thing indeed; for all on a sudden I found the
earth come crumbling down from the roof of my cave, and from the
edge of the hill over my head, and two of the posts I had set up in
the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily scared; but
thought nothing of what was really the cause, only thinking that
the top of my cave was fallen in, as some of it had done before:
and for fear I should be buried in it I ran forward to my ladder,
and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for
fear of the pieces of the hill, which I expected might roll down
upon me. I had no sooner stepped do ground, than I plainly saw it
was a terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood on shook three
times at about eight minutes' distance, with three such shocks as
would have overturned the strongest building that could be supposed
to have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock
which stood about half a mile from me next the sea fell down with
such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I perceived
also the very sea was put into violent motion by it; and I believe
the shocks were stronger under the water than on the island.</p>

<p>I was so much amazed with the thing itself, having never felt
the like, nor discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one
dead or stupefied; and the motion of the earth made my stomach
sick, like one that was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling
of the rock awakened me, as it were, and rousing me from the
stupefied condition I was in, filled me with horror; and I thought
of nothing then but the hill falling upon my tent and all my
household goods, and burying all at once; and this sunk my very
soul within me a second time.</p>

<p>After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some
time, I began to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough to go
over my wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still
upon the ground greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing
what to do. All this while I had not the least serious religious
thought; nothing but the common "Lord have mercy upon me!" and when
it was over that went away too.</p>

<p>While I sat thus, I found the air overcast and grow cloudy, as
if it would rain. Soon after that the wind arose by little and
little, so that in less than half-an-hour it blew a most dreadful
hurricane; the sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and
froth; the shore was covered with the breach of the water, the
trees were torn up by the roots, and a terrible storm it was. This
held about three hours, and then began to abate; and in two hours
more it was quite calm, and began to rain very hard. All this while
I sat upon the ground very much terrified and dejected; when on a
sudden it came into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being
the consequences of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent
and over, and I might venture into my cave again. With this thought
my spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade
me, I went in and sat down in my tent. But the rain was so violent
that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it; and I was forced
to go into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it
should fall on my head. This violent rain forced me to a new
work&mdash;viz. to cut a hole through my new fortification, like a
sink, to let the water go out, which would else have flooded my
cave. After I had been in my cave for some time, and found still no
more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more composed.
And now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I
went to my little store, and took a small sup of rum; which,
however, I did then and always very sparingly, knowing I could have
no more when that was gone. It continued raining all that night and
great part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my
mind being more composed, I began to think of what I had best do;
concluding that if the island was subject to these earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a cave, but I must consider of
building a little hut in an open place which I might surround with
a wall, as I had done here, and so make myself secure from wild
beasts or men; for I concluded, if I stayed where I was, I should
certainly one time or other be buried alive.</p>

<p>With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place
where it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the
hill; and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall
upon my tent; and I spent the two next days, being the 19th and
20th of April, in contriving where and how to remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that I never slept in
quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad without any fence
was almost equal to it; but still, when I looked about, and saw how
everything was put in order, how pleasantly concealed I was, and
how safe from danger, it made me very loath to remove. In the
meantime, it occurred to me that it would require a vast deal of
time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to venture
where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had secured
it so as to remove to it. So with this resolution I composed myself
for a time, and resolved that I would go to work with all speed to
build me a wall with piles and cables, &amp; c., in a circle, as
before, and set my tent up in it when it was finished; but that I
would venture to stay where I was till it was finished, and fit to
remove. This was the 21st.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 22.&mdash;The next morning I begin to consider of
means to put this resolve into execution; but I was at a great loss
about my tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets
(for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the Indians); but
with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full
of notches, and dull; and though I had a grindstone, I could not
turn it and grind my tools too. This cost me as much thought as a
statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or a
judge upon the life and death of a man. At length I contrived a
wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have
both my hands at liberty. <i>Note</i>.&mdash;I had never seen any
such thing in England, or at least, not to take notice how it was
done, though since I have observed, it is very common there;
besides that, my grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine
cost me a full week's work to bring it to perfection.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 28, 29.&mdash;These two whole days I took up in
grinding my tools, my machine for turning my grindstone performing
very well.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 30.&mdash;Having perceived my bread had been low a
great while, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one
biscuit cake a day, which made my heart very heavy.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 1.&mdash;In the morning, looking towards the sea
side, the tide being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger
than ordinary, and it looked like a cask; when I came to it, I
found a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the
ship, which were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of
the water than it used to do. I examined the barrel which was
driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder; but
it had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone;
however, I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and went on
upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to
look for more.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI&mdash;ILL AND CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN</h3>

<p>When I came down to the ship I found it strangely removed. The
forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least
six feet, and the stern, which was broke in pieces and parted from
the rest by the force of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging
her, was tossed as it were up, and cast on one side; and the sand
was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that whereas there
was a great place of water before, so that I could not come within
a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming I could now walk
quite up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised with this at
first, but soon concluded it must be done by the earthquake; and as
by this violence the ship was more broke open than formerly, so
many things came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, and
which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land.</p>

<p>This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my
habitation, and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, in
searching whether I could make any way into the ship; but I found
nothing was to be expected of that kind, for all the inside of the
ship was choked up with sand. However, as I had learned not to
despair of anything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I
could of the ship, concluding that everything I could get from her
would be of some use or other to me.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 3.&mdash;I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a
beam through, which I thought held some of the upper part or
quarter-deck together, and when I had cut it through, I cleared
away the sand as well as I could from the side which lay highest;
but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that
time.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 4.&mdash;I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish
that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when, just going
to leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long line
of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks; yet I frequently caught fish
enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the sun,
and ate them dry.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 5.&mdash;Worked on the wreck; cut another beam
asunder, and brought three great fir planks off from the decks,
which I tied together, and made to float on shore when the tide of
flood came on.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 6.&mdash;Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts
out of her and other pieces of ironwork. Worked very hard, and came
home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it over.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 7.&mdash;Went to the wreck again, not with an intent
to work, but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down,
the beams being cut; that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie
loose, and the inside of the hold lay so open that I could see into
it; but it was almost full of water and sand.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 8.&mdash;Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow
to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water or
sand. I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on shore also
with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for next day.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 9.&mdash;Went to the wreck, and with the crow made
way into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and
loosened them with the crow, but could not break them up. I felt
also a roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it was too
heavy to remove.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 10-14.&mdash;Went every day to the wreck; and got a
great many pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three
hundredweight of iron.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 15.&mdash;I carried two hatchets, to try if I could
not cut a piece off the roll of lead by placing the edge of one
hatchet and driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot
and a half in the water, I could not make any blow to drive the
hatchet.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 16.&mdash;It had blown hard in the night, and the
wreck appeared more broken by the force of the water; but I stayed
so long in the woods, to get pigeons for food, that the tide
prevented my going to the wreck that day.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 17.&mdash;I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on
shore, at a great distance, near two miles off me, but resolved to
see what they were, and found it was a piece of the head, but too
heavy for me to bring away.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 24.&mdash;Every day, to this day, I worked on the
wreck; and with hard labour I loosened some things so much with the
crow, that the first flowing tide several casks floated out, and
two of the seamen's chests; but the wind blowing from the shore,
nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber, and a hogshead,
which had some Brazil pork in it; but the salt water and the sand
had spoiled it. I continued this work every day to the 15th of
June, except the time necessary to get food, which I always
appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when the tide
was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed out; and by this
time I had got timber and plank and ironwork enough to have built a
good boat, if I had known how; and also I got, at several times and
in several pieces, near one hundredweight of the sheet lead.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 16.&mdash;Going down to the seaside, I found a large
tortoise or turtle. This was the first I had seen, which, it seems,
was only my misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity;
for had I happened to be on the other side of the island, I might
have had hundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards; but
perhaps had paid dear enough for them.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 17.&mdash;I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in
her three-score eggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the
most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had
no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid
place.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 18.&mdash;Rained all day, and I stayed within. I
thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was something
chilly; which I knew was not usual in that latitude.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 19.&mdash;Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather
had been cold.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 20.&mdash;No rest all night; violent pains in my
head, and feverish.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 21.&mdash;Very ill; frighted almost to death with
the apprehensions of my sad condition&mdash;to be sick, and no
help. Prayed to God, for the first time since the storm off Hull,
but scarce knew what I said, or why, my thoughts being all
confused.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 22.&mdash;A little better; but under dreadful
apprehensions of sickness.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 23.&mdash;Very bad again; cold and shivering, and
then a violent headache.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 24.&mdash;Much better.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 25.&mdash;An ague very violent; the fit held me
seven hours; cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 26.&mdash;Better; and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun, but found myself very weak. However, I killed a
she-goat, and with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some of
it, and ate, I would fain have stewed it, and made some broth, but
had no pot.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 27.&mdash;The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed
all day, and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for
thirst; but so weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to get
myself any water to drink. Prayed to God again, but was
light-headed; and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not
what to say; only I lay and cried, "Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity
me! Lord, have mercy upon me!" I suppose I did nothing else for two
or three hours; till, the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did
not wake till far in the night. When I awoke, I found myself much
refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty. However, as I had no
water in my habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and went
to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible dream: I
thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my
wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and
that I saw a man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright
flame of fire, and light upon the ground. He was all over as bright
as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him; his
countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words
to describe. When he stepped upon the ground with his feet, I
thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before in the
earthquake, and all the air looked, to my apprehension, as if it
had been filled with flashes of fire. He was no sooner landed upon
the earth, but he moved forward towards me, with a long spear or
weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came to a rising
ground, at some distance, he spoke to me&mdash;or I heard a voice
so terrible that it is impossible to express the terror of it. All
that I can say I understood was this: "Seeing all these things have
not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;" at which
words, I thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to
kill me.</p>

<p>No one that shall ever read this account will expect that I
should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible
vision. I mean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of
those horrors. Nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind when I awaked, and found it
was but a dream.</p>

<p>I had, alas! no divine knowledge. What I had received by the
good instruction of my father was then worn out by an uninterrupted
series, for eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant
conversation with none but such as were, like myself, wicked and
profane to the last degree. I do not remember that I had, in all
that time, one thought that so much as tended either to looking
upwards towards God, or inwards towards a reflection upon my own
ways; but a certain stupidity of soul, without desire of good, or
conscience of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me; and I was all that
the most hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our common
sailors can be supposed to be; not having the least sense, either
of the fear of God in danger, or of thankfulness to God in
deliverance.</p>

<p>In the relating what is already past of my story, this will be
the more easily believed when I shall add, that through all the
variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me, I never had
so much as one thought of it being the hand of God, or that it was
a just punishment for my sin&mdash;my rebellious behaviour against
my father&mdash;or my present sins, which were great&mdash;or so
much as a punishment for the general course of my wicked life. When
I was on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of Africa, I
never had so much as one thought of what would become of me, or one
wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from
the danger which apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious
creatures as cruel savages. But I was merely thoughtless of a God
or a Providence, acted like a mere brute, from the principles of
nature, and by the dictates of common sense only, and, indeed,
hardly that. When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the
Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and honourably with,
as well as charitably, I had not the least thankfulness in my
thoughts. When, again, I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of
drowning on this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on
it as a judgment. I only said to myself often, that I was an
unfortunate dog, and born to be always miserable.</p>

<p>It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my
ship's crew drowned and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind
of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which, had the grace of
God assisted, might have come up to true thankfulness; but it ended
where it began, in a mere common flight of joy, or, as I may say,
being glad I was alive, without the least reflection upon the
distinguished goodness of the hand which had preserved me, and had
singled me out to be preserved when all the rest were destroyed, or
an inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful unto me. Even just
the same common sort of joy which seamen generally have, after they
are got safe ashore from a shipwreck, which they drown all in the
next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over; and
all the rest of my life was like it. Even when I was afterwards, on
due consideration, made sensible of my condition, how I was cast on
this dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind, out of all
hope of relief, or prospect of redemption, as soon as I saw but a
prospect of living and that I should not starve and perish for
hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore off; and I began to be
very easy, applied myself to the works proper for my preservation
and supply, and was far enough from being afflicted at my
condition, as a judgment from heaven, or as the hand of God against
me: these were thoughts which very seldom entered my head.</p>

<p>The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had at
first some little influence upon me, and began to affect me with
seriousness, as long as I thought it had something miraculous in
it; but as soon as ever that part of the thought was removed, all
the impression that was raised from it wore off also, as I have
noted already. Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more
terrible in its nature, or more immediately directing to the
invisible Power which alone directs such things, yet no sooner was
the first fright over, but the impression it had made went off
also. I had no more sense of God or His judgments&mdash;much less
of the present affliction of my circumstances being from His
hand&mdash;than if I had been in the most prosperous condition of
life. But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the
miseries of death came to place itself before me; when my spirits
began to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and nature
was exhausted with the violence of the fever; conscience, that had
slept so long, began to awake, and I began to reproach myself with
my past life, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness,
provoked the justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and
to deal with me in so vindictive a manner. These reflections
oppressed me for the second or third day of my distemper; and in
the violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of
my conscience, extorted some words from me like praying to God,
though I cannot say they were either a prayer attended with desires
or with hopes: it was rather the voice of mere fright and distress.
My thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon my mind, and
the horror of dying in such a miserable condition raised vapours
into my head with the mere apprehensions; and in these hurries of
my soul I knew not what my tongue might express. But it was rather
exclamation, such as, "Lord, what a miserable creature am I! If I
should be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help; and what
will become of me!" Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I
could say no more for a good while. In this interval the good
advice of my father came to my mind, and presently his prediction,
which I mentioned at the beginning of this story&mdash;viz. that if
I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would
have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel
when there might be none to assist in my recovery. "Now," said I,
aloud, "my dear father's words are come to pass; God's justice has
overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me. I rejected the
voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a posture or
station of life wherein I might have been happy and easy; but I
would neither see it myself nor learn to know the blessing of it
from my parents. I left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am
left to mourn under the consequences of it. I abused their help and
assistance, who would have lifted me in the world, and would have
made everything easy to me; and now I have difficulties to struggle
with, too great for even nature itself to support, and no
assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice." Then I cried out,
"Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress." This was the first
prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for many years.</p>

<p>But to return to my Journal.</p>

<p><i>June</i> 28.&mdash;Having been somewhat refreshed with the
sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up; and
though the fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I
considered that the fit of the ague would return again the next
day, and now was my time to get something to refresh and support
myself when I should be ill; and the first thing I did, I filled a
large square case-bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in
reach of my bed; and to take off the chill or aguish disposition of
the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and
mixed them together. Then I got me a piece of the goat's flesh and
broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little. I walked about,
but was very weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted under a
sense of my miserable condition, dreading, the return of my
distemper the next day. At night I made my supper of three of the
turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we call
it, in the shell, and this was the first bit of meat I had ever
asked God's blessing to, that I could remember, in my whole life.
After I had eaten I tried to walk, but found myself so weak that I
could hardly carry a gun, for I never went out without that; so I
went but a little way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out
upon the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth.
As I sat here some such thoughts as these occurred to me: What is
this earth and sea, of which I have seen so much? Whence is it
produced? And what am I, and all the other creatures wild and tame,
human and brutal? Whence are we? Sure we are all made by some
secret Power, who formed the earth and sea, the air and sky. And
who is that? Then it followed most naturally, it is God that has
made all. Well, but then it came on strangely, if God has made all
these things, He guides and governs them all, and all things that
concern them; for the Power that could make all things must
certainly have power to guide and direct them. If so, nothing can
happen in the great circuit of His works, either without His
knowledge or appointment.</p>

<p>And if nothing happens without His knowledge, He knows that I am
here, and am in this dreadful condition; and if nothing happens
without His appointment, He has appointed all this to befall me.
Nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these
conclusions, and therefore it rested upon me with the greater
force, that it must needs be that God had appointed all this to
befall me; that I was brought into this miserable circumstance by
His direction, He having the sole power, not of me only, but of
everything that happened in the world. Immediately it followed: Why
has God done this to me? What have I done to be thus used? My
conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had
blasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a voice: "Wretch!
dost <i>thou</i> ask what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful
misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast <i>not</i> done? Ask,
why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed? Why wert thou not
drowned in Yarmouth Roads; killed in the fight when the ship was
taken by the Sallee man-of-war; devoured by the wild beasts on the
coast of Africa; or drowned <i>here</i>, when all the crew perished
but thyself? Dost <i>thou</i> ask, what have I done?" I was struck
dumb with these reflections, as one astonished, and had not a word
to say&mdash;no, not to answer to myself, but rose up pensive and
sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I
had been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I
had no inclination to sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted
my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the
return of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my
thought that the Brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for
almost all distempers, and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in
one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some also that was
green, and not quite cured.</p>

<p>I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest I found a
cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and found what I
looked for, the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there
too, I took out one of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and
which to this time I had not found leisure or inclination to look
into. I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco
with me to the table. What use to make of the tobacco I knew not,
in my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no: but I tried
several experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one
way or other. I first took a piece of leaf, and chewed it in my
mouth, which, indeed, at first almost stupefied my brain, the
tobacco being green and strong, and that I had not been much used
to. Then I took some and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and
resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt
some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of
it as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as almost for
suffocation. In the interval of this operation I took up the Bible
and began to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only, having opened
the book casually, the first words that occurred to me were these,
"Call on Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify Me." These words were very apt to my case, and
made some impression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them,
though not so much as they did afterwards; for, as for being
<i>delivered</i>, the word had no sound, as I may say, to me; the
thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehension of things,
that I began to say, as the children of Israel did when they were
promised flesh to eat, "Can God spread a table in the wilderness?"
so I began to say, "Can God Himself deliver me from this place?"
And as it was not for many years that any hopes appeared, this
prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but, however, the words made
a great impression upon me, and I mused upon them very often. It
grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head so
much that I inclined to sleep; so I left my lamp burning in the
cave, lest I should want anything in the night, and went to bed.
But before I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my
life&mdash;I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfil the promise
to me, that if I called upon Him in the day of trouble, He would
deliver me. After my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank
the rum in which I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and
rank of the tobacco that I could scarcely get it down; immediately
upon this I went to bed. I found presently it flew up into my head
violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more till,
by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock in the
afternoon the next day&mdash;nay, to this hour I am partly of
opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost
three the day after; for otherwise I know not how I should lose a
day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared
some years after I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and
recrossing the line, I should have lost more than one day; but
certainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew which way. Be
that, however, one way or the other, when I awaked I found myself
exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful; when I
got up I was stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach
better, for I was hungry; and, in short, I had no fit the next day,
but continued much altered for the better. This was the 29th.</p>

<p>The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my
gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a sea-fowl or
two, something like a brandgoose, and brought them home, but was
not very forward to eat them; so I ate some more of the turtle's
eggs, which were very good. This evening I renewed the medicine,
which I had supposed did me good the day before&mdash;the tobacco
steeped in rum; only I did not take so much as before, nor did I
chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke; however, I
was not so well the next day, which was the first of July, as I
hoped I should have been; for I had a little spice of the cold fit,
but it was not much.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 2.&mdash;I renewed the medicine all the three ways;
and dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity
which I drank.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 3.&mdash;I missed the fit for good and all, though I
did not recover my full strength for some weeks after. While I was
thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this
Scripture, "I will deliver thee"; and the impossibility of my
deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting it;
but as I was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it occurred to
my mind that I pored so much upon my deliverance from the main
affliction, that I disregarded the deliverance I had received, and
I was as it were made to ask myself such questions as
these&mdash;viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too,
from sickness&mdash;from the most distressed condition that could
be, and that was so frightful to me? and what notice had I taken of
it? Had I done my part? God had delivered me, but I had not
glorified Him&mdash;that is to say, I had not owned and been
thankful for that as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater
deliverance? This touched my heart very much; and immediately I
knelt down and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my
sickness.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 4.&mdash;In the morning I took the Bible; and
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and
imposed upon myself to read a while every morning and every night;
not tying myself to the number of chapters, but long as my thoughts
should engage me. It was not long after I set seriously to this
work till I found my heart more deeply and sincerely affected with
the wickedness of my past life. The impression of my dream revived;
and the words, "All these things have not brought thee to
repentance," ran seriously through my thoughts. I was earnestly
begging of God to give me repentance, when it happened
providentially, the very day, that, reading the Scripture, I came
to these words: "He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give
repentance and to give remission." I threw down the book; and with
my heart as well as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of
ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, "Jesus, thou son of David!
Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour! give me repentance!" This
was the first time I could say, in the true sense of the words,
that I prayed in all my life; for now I prayed with a sense of my
condition, and a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the
encouragement of the Word of God; and from this time, I may say, I
began to hope that God would hear me.</p>

<p>Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, "Call on Me,
and I will deliver thee," in a different sense from what I had ever
done before; for then I had no notion of anything being called
<i>deliverance</i>, but my being delivered from the captivity I was
in; for though I was indeed at large in the place, yet the island
was certainly a prison to me, and that in the worse sense in the
world. But now I learned to take it in another sense: now I looked
back upon my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared so
dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance from
the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary
life, it was nothing. I did not so much as pray to be delivered
from it or think of it; it was all of no consideration in
comparison to this. And I add this part here, to hint to whoever
shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things,
they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing than
deliverance from affliction.</p>

<p>But, leaving this part, I return to my Journal.</p>

<p>My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my
way of living, yet much easier to my mind: and my thoughts being
directed, by a constant reading the Scripture and praying to God,
to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of comfort within,
which till now I knew nothing of; also, my health and strength
returned, I bestirred myself to furnish myself with everything that
I wanted, and make my way of living as regular as I could.</p>

<p>From the 4th of July to the 14th I was chiefly employed in
walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a
time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after a fit of
sickness; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to
what weakness I was reduced. The application which I made use of
was perfectly new, and perhaps which had never cured an ague
before; neither can I recommend it to any to practise, by this
experiment: and though it did carry off the fit, yet it rather
contributed to weakening me; for I had frequent convulsions in my
nerves and limbs for some time. I learned from it also this, in
particular, that being abroad in the rainy season was the most
pernicious thing to my health that could be, especially in those
rains which came attended with storms and hurricanes of wind; for
as the rain which came in the dry season was almost always
accompanied with such storms, so I found that rain was much more
dangerous than the rain which fell in September and October.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII&mdash;AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCE</h3>

<p>I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months. All
possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be
entirely taken from me; and I firmly believe that no human shape
had ever set foot upon that place. Having now secured my
habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great desire to
make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to see what other
productions I might find, which I yet knew nothing of.</p>

<p>It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more
particular survey of the island itself. I went up the creek first,
where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found after I
came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and
that it was no more than a little brook of running water, very
fresh and good; but this being the dry season, there was hardly any
water in some parts of it&mdash;at least not enough to run in any
stream, so as it could be perceived. On the banks of this brook I
found many pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and
covered with grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the
higher grounds, where the water, as might be supposed, never
overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to
a great and very strong stalk. There were divers other plants,
which I had no notion of or understanding about, that might,
perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I could not find out. I
searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that
climate, make their bread of, but I could find none. I saw large
plants of aloes, but did not understand them. I saw several
sugar-canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I
contented myself with these discoveries for this time, and came
back, musing with myself what course I might take to know the
virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should
discover, but could bring it to no conclusion; for, in short, I had
made so little observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew
little of the plants in the field; at least, very little that might
serve to any purpose now in my distress.</p>

<p>The next day, the sixteenth, I went up the same way again; and
after going something further than I had gone the day before, I
found the brook and the savannahs cease, and the country become
more woody than before. In this part I found different fruits, and
particularly I found melons upon the ground, in great abundance,
and grapes upon the trees. The vines had spread, indeed, over the
trees, and the clusters of grapes were just now in their prime,
very ripe and rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was
exceeding glad of them; but I was warned by my experience to eat
sparingly of them; remembering that when I was ashore in Barbary,
the eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who were
slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers. But I found
an excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to cure or dry
them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept,
which I thought would be, as indeed they were, wholesome and
agreeable to eat when no grapes could be had.</p>

<p>I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my
habitation; which, by the way, was the first night, as I might say,
I had lain from home. In the night, I took my first contrivance,
and got up in a tree, where I slept well; and the next morning
proceeded upon my discovery; travelling nearly four miles, as I
might judge by the length of the valley, keeping still due north,
with a ridge of hills on the south and north side of me. At the end
of this march I came to an opening where the country seemed to
descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh water, which
issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that
is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so
flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure or flourish of
spring that it looked like a planted garden. I descended a little
on the side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret kind
of pleasure, though mixed with my other afflicting thoughts, to
think that this was all my own; that I was king and lord of all
this country indefensibly, and had a right of possession; and if I
could convey it, I might have it in inheritance as completely as
any lord of a manor in England. I saw here abundance of cocoa
trees, orange, and lemon, and citron trees; but all wild, and very
few bearing any fruit, at least not then. However, the green limes
that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome;
and I mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made it very
wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I found now I had business
enough to gather and carry home; and I resolved to lay up a store
as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the
wet season, which I knew was approaching. In order to do this, I
gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in
another place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in another
place; and taking a few of each with me, I travelled homewards;
resolving to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could
make, to carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent three days
in this journey, I came home (so I must now call my tent and my
cave); but before I got thither the grapes were spoiled; the
richness of the fruit and the weight of the juice having broken
them and bruised them, they were good for little or nothing; as to
the limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few.</p>

<p>The next day, being the nineteenth, I went back, having made me
two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when
coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I
gathered them, to find them all spread about, trod to pieces, and
dragged about, some here, some there, and abundance eaten and
devoured. By this I concluded there were some wild creatures
thereabouts, which had done this; but what they were I knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps, and no
carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would be
destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed with their own
weight, I took another course; for I gathered a large quantity of
the grapes, and hung upon the out-branches of the trees, that they
might cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I
carried as many back as I could well stand under.</p>

<p>When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great
pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of
the situation; the security from storms on that side of the water,
and the wood: and concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix
my abode which was by far the worst part of the country. Upon the
whole, I began to consider of removing my habitation, and looking
out for a place equally safe as where now I was situate, if
possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part of the island.</p>

<p>This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it
for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me; but when
I came to a nearer view of it, I considered that I was now by the
seaside, where it was at least possible that something might happen
to my advantage, and, by the same ill fate that brought me hither
might bring some other unhappy wretches to the same place; and
though it was scarce probable that any such thing should ever
happen, yet to enclose myself among the hills and woods in the
centre of the island was to anticipate my bondage, and to render
such an affair not only improbable, but impossible; and that
therefore I ought not by any means to remove. However, I was so
enamoured of this place, that I spent much of my time there for the
whole of the remaining part of the month of July; and though upon
second thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet I built me a little
kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with a strong
fence, being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked
and filled between with brushwood; and here I lay very secure,
sometimes two or three nights together; always going over it with a
ladder; so that I fancied now I had my country house and my
sea-coast house; and this work took me up to the beginning of
August.</p>

<p>I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labour,
when the rains came on, and made me stick close to my first
habitation; for though I had made me a tent like the other, with a
piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter
of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat
into when the rains were extraordinary.</p>

<p>About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my
bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August, I found the
grapes I had hung up perfectly dried, and, indeed, were excellent
good raisins of the sun; so I began to take them down from the
trees, and it was very happy that I did so, for the rains which
followed would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best part of
my winter food; for I had above two hundred large bunches of them.
No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried the most of them
home to my cave, than it began to rain; and from hence, which was
the 14th of August, it rained, more or less, every day till the
middle of October; and sometimes so violently, that I could not
stir out of my cave for several days.</p>

<p>In this season I was much surprised with the increase of my
family; I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who
ran away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead, and I heard no
more tidings of her till, to my astonishment, she came home about
the end of August with three kittens. This was the more strange to
me because, though I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my
gun, yet I thought it was quite a different kind from our European
cats; but the young cats were the same kind of house-breed as the
old one; and both my cats being females, I thought it very strange.
But from these three cats I afterwards came to be so pestered with
cats that I was forced to kill them like vermin or wild beasts, and
to drive them from my house as much as possible.</p>

<p>From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I
could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In
this confinement, I began to be straitened for food: but venturing
out twice, I one day killed a goat; and the last day, which was the
26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my
food was regulated thus: I ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast;
a piece of the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner,
broiled&mdash;for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to boil
or stew anything; and two or three of the turtle's eggs for my
supper.</p>

<p>During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked daily
two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it
on towards one side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and
made a door or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall; and so
I came in and out this way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying
so open; for, as I had managed myself before, I was in a perfect
enclosure; whereas now I thought I lay exposed, and open for
anything to come in upon me; and yet I could not perceive that
there was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had
yet seen upon the island being a goat.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> 30.&mdash;I was now come to the unhappy anniversary
of my landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and found I had
been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as
a solemn fast, setting it apart for religious exercise, prostrating
myself on the ground with the most serious humiliation, confessing
my sins to God, acknowledging His righteous judgments upon me, and
praying to Him to have mercy on me through Jesus Christ; and not
having tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even till the
going down of the sun, I then ate a biscuit-cake and a bunch of
grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I began it. I had all
this time observed no Sabbath day; for as at first I had no sense
of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, omitted to
distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for
the Sabbath day, and so did not really know what any of the days
were; but now, having cast up the days as above, I found I had been
there a year; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every
seventh day for a Sabbath; though I found at the end of my account
I had lost a day or two in my reckoning. A little after this, my
ink began to fail me, and so I contented myself to use it more
sparingly, and to write down only the most remarkable events of my
life, without continuing a daily memorandum of other things.</p>

<p>The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular
to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide for them
accordingly; but I bought all my experience before I had it, and
this I am going to relate was one of the most discouraging
experiments that I made.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley and
rice, which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of
themselves, and I believe there were about thirty stalks of rice,
and about twenty of barley; and now I thought it a proper time to
sow it, after the rains, the sun being in its southern position,
going from me. Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well as I
could with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed
my grain; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts
that I would not sow it all at first, because I did not know when
was the proper time for it, so I sowed about two-thirds of the
seed, leaving about a handful of each. It was a great comfort to me
afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this
time came to anything: for the dry months following, the earth
having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to
assist its growth, and never came up at all till the wet season had
come again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly sown.
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined was by
the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make another
trial in, and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and
sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal
equinox; and this having the rainy months of March and April to
water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop;
but having part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all
that I had, I had but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not
amounting to above half a peck of each kind. But by this experiment
I was made master of my business, and knew exactly when the proper
season was to sow, and that I might expect two seed-times and two
harvests every year.</p>

<p>While this corn was growing I made a little discovery, which was
of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, and the
weather began to settle, which was about the month of November, I
made a visit up the country to my bower, where, though I had not
been some months, yet I found all things just as I left them. The
circle or double hedge that I had made was not only firm and
entire, but the stakes which I had cut out of some trees that grew
thereabouts were all shot out and grown with long branches, as much
as a willow-tree usually shoots the first year after lopping its
head. I could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were
cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the
young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as
much alike as I could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a
figure they grew into in three years; so that though the hedge made
a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for
such I might now call them, soon covered it, and it was a complete
shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season. This made me
resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in
a semi-circle round my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling),
which I did; and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at
about eight yards distance from my first fence, they grew
presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and
afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its
order.</p>

<p>I found now that the seasons of the year might generally be
divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the
rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were generally
thus:&mdash;The half of February, the whole of March, and the half
of April&mdash;rainy, the sun being then on or near the
equinox.</p>

<p>The half of April, the whole of May, June, and July, and the
half of August&mdash;dry, the sun being then to the north of the
line.</p>

<p>The half of August, the whole of September, and the half of
October&mdash;rainy, the sun being then come back.</p>

<p>The half of October, the whole of November, December, and
January, and the half of February&mdash;dry, the sun being then to
the south of the line.</p>

<p>The rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds
happened to blow, but this was the general observation I made.
After I had found by experience the ill consequences of being
abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions
beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out, and I sat within
doors as much as possible during the wet months. This time I found
much employment, and very suitable also to the time, for I found
great occasion for many things which I had no way to furnish myself
with but by hard labour and constant application; particularly I
tried many ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs I could
get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing.
It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy,
I used to take great delight in standing at a basket-maker's, in
the town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware;
and being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great
observer of the manner in which they worked those things, and
sometimes lending a hand, I had by these means full knowledge of
the methods of it, and I wanted nothing but the materials, when it
came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my
stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the sallows,
willows, and osiers in England, and I resolved to try. Accordingly,
the next day I went to my country house, as I called it, and
cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as
much as I could desire; whereupon I came the next time prepared
with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for
there was great plenty of them. These I set up to dry within my
circle or hedge, and when they were fit for use I carried them to
my cave; and here, during the next season, I employed myself in
making, as well as I could, a great many baskets, both to carry
earth or to carry or lay up anything, as I had occasion; and though
I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently
serviceable for my purpose; thus, afterwards, I took care never to
be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made more,
especially strong, deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of
sacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it.</p>

<p>Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time
about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two
wants. I had no vessels to hold anything that was liquid, except
two runlets, which were almost full of rum, and some glass
bottles&mdash;some of the common size, and others which were case
bottles, square, for the holding of water, spirits, &amp; c. I had
not so much as a pot to boil anything, except a great kettle, which
I saved out of the ship, and which was too big for such as I
desired it&mdash;viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by
itself. The second thing I fain would have had was a tobacco-pipe,
but it was impossible to me to make one; however, I found a
contrivance for that, too, at last. I employed myself in planting
my second rows of stakes or piles, and in this wicker-working all
the summer or dry season, when another business took me up more
time than it could be imagined I could spare.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;SURVEYS HIS POSITION</h3>

<p>I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole
island, and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I
built my bower, and where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel quite across to
the sea-shore on that side; so, taking my gun, a hatchet, and my
dog, and a larger quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two
biscuit-cakes and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch for my
store, I began my journey. When I had passed the vale where my
bower stood, as above, I came within view of the sea to the west,
and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land&mdash;whether
an island or a continent I could not tell; but it lay very high,
extending from the W. to the W.S.W. at a very great distance; by my
guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.</p>

<p>I could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise
than that I knew it must be part of America, and, as I concluded by
all my observations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and
perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where, if I had landed, I had
been in a worse condition than I was now; and therefore I
acquiesced in the dispositions of Providence, which I began now to
own and to believe ordered everything for the best; I say I quieted
my mind with this, and left off afflicting myself with fruitless
wishes of being there.</p>

<p>Besides, after some thought upon this affair, I considered that
if this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or
other, see some vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not,
then it was the savage coast between the Spanish country and
Brazils, where are found the worst of savages; for they are
cannibals or men-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour all the
human bodies that fall into their hands.</p>

<p>With these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward. I
found that side of the island where I now was much pleasanter than
mine&mdash;the open or savannah fields sweet, adorned with flowers
and grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots,
and fain I would have caught one, if possible, to have kept it to
be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I did, after some
painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I knocked it down with a
stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home; but it was some
years before I could make him speak; however, at last I taught him
to call me by name very familiarly. But the accident that followed,
though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place.</p>

<p>I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the low
grounds hares (as I thought them to be) and foxes; but they
differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met with, nor could
I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed several. But I had no
need to be venturous, for I had no want of food, and of that which
was very good too, especially these three sorts, viz. goats,
pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise, which added to my grapes,
Leadenhall market could not have furnished a table better than I,
in proportion to the company; and though my case was deplorable
enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness that I was not
driven to any extremities for food, but had rather plenty, even to
dainties.</p>

<p>I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a
day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and re-turns to see
what discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the
place where I resolved to sit down all night; and then I either
reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes
set upright in the ground, either from one tree to another, or so
as no wild creature could come at me without waking me.</p>

<p>As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that
I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island, for here,
indeed, the shore was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on
the other side I had found but three in a year and a half. Here was
also an infinite number of fowls of many kinds, some which I had
seen, and some which I had not seen before, and many of them very
good meat, but such as I knew not the names of, except those called
penguins.</p>

<p>I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of
my powder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat
if I could, which I could better feed on; and though there were
many goats here, more than on my side the island, yet it was with
much more difficulty that I could come near them, the country being
flat and even, and they saw me much sooner than when I was on the
hills.</p>

<p>I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than
mine; but yet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I
was fixed in my habitation it became natural to me, and I seemed
all the while I was here to be as it were upon a journey, and from
home. However, I travelled along the shore of the sea towards the
east, I suppose about twelve miles, and then setting up a great
pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home again,
and that the next journey I took should be on the other side of the
island east from my dwelling, and so round till I came to my post
again.</p>

<p>I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I
could easily keep all the island so much in my view that I could
not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country; but I
found myself mistaken, for being come about two or three miles, I
found myself descended into a very large valley, but so surrounded
with hills, and those hills covered with wood, that I could not see
which was my way by any direction but that of the sun, nor even
then, unless I knew very well the position of the sun at that time
of the day. It happened, to my further misfortune, that the weather
proved hazy for three or four days while I was in the valley, and
not being able to see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably,
and at last was obliged to find the seaside, look for my post, and
come back the same way I went: and then, by easy journeys, I turned
homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, and my gun, ammunition,
hatchet, and other things very heavy.</p>

<p>In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon
it; and I, running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it
alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it home if I could,
for I had often been musing whether it might not be possible to get
a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats, which might
supply me when my powder and shot should be all spent. I made a
collar for this little creature, and with a string, which I made of
some rope-yam, which I always carried about me, I led him along,
though with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and there I
enclosed him and left him, for I was very impatient to be at home,
from whence I had been absent above a month.</p>

<p>I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into
my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This little wandering
journey, without settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to
me, that my own house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect
settlement to me compared to that; and it rendered everything about
me so comfortable, that I resolved I would never go a great way
from it again while it should be my lot to stay on the island.</p>

<p>I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my
long journey; during which most of the time was taken up in the
weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a
mere domestic, and to be well acquainted with me. Then I began to
think of the poor kid which I had penned in within my little
circle, and resolved to go and fetch it home, or give it some food;
accordingly I went, and found it where I left it, for indeed it
could not get out, but was almost starved for want of food. I went
and cut boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I could
find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did
before, to lead it away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that
I had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog: and
as I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle,
and so fond, that it became from that time one of my domestics
also, and would never leave me afterwards.</p>

<p>The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I
kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as before,
being the anniversary of my landing on the island, having now been
there two years, and no more prospect of being delivered than the
first day I came there, I spent the whole day in humble and
thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies which my
solitary condition was attended with, and without which it might
have been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty
thanks that God had been pleased to discover to me that it was
possible I might be more happy in this solitary condition than I
should have been in the liberty of society, and in all the
pleasures of the world; that He could fully make up to me the
deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of human society,
by His presence and the communications of His grace to my soul;
supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon His
providence here, and hope for His eternal presence hereafter.</p>

<p>It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy
this life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than
the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my
days; and now I changed both my sorrows and my joys; my very
desires altered, my affections changed their gusts, and my delights
were perfectly new from what they were at my first coming, or,
indeed, for the two years past.</p>

<p>Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting or for viewing
the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out
upon me on a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to
think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I
was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the
ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without redemption. In the
midst of the greatest composure of my mind, this would break out
upon me like a storm, and make me wring my hands and weep like a
child. Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, and I
would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the ground for
an hour or two together; and this was still worse to me, for if I
could burst out into tears, or vent myself by words, it would go
off, and the grief, having exhausted itself, would abate.</p>

<p>But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts: I daily
read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my
present state. One morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon
these words, "I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee."
Immediately it occurred that these words were to me; why else
should they be directed in such a manner, just at the moment when I
was mourning over my condition, as one forsaken of God and man?
"Well, then," said I, "if God does not forsake me, of what ill
consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the world should
all forsake me, seeing on the other hand, if I had all the world,
and should lose the favour and blessing of God, there would be no
comparison in the loss?"</p>

<p>From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was
possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary
condition than it was probable I should ever have been in any other
particular state in the world; and with this thought I was going to
give thanks to God for bringing me to this place. I know not what
it was, but something shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst
not speak the words. "How canst thou become such a hypocrite," said
I, even audibly, "to pretend to be thankful for a condition which,
however thou mayest endeavour to be contented with, thou wouldst
rather pray heartily to be delivered from?" So I stopped there; but
though I could not say I thanked God for being there, yet I
sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever
afflicting providences, to see the former condition of my life, and
to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the Bible,
or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed God for directing my
friend in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up among
my goods, and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the
wreck of the ship.</p>

<p>Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year;
and though I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular
an account of my works this year as the first, yet in general it
may be observed that I was very seldom idle, but having regularly
divided my time according to the several daily employments that
were before me, such as: first, my duty to God, and the reading the
Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some time for thrice every
day; secondly, the going abroad with my gun for food, which
generally took me up three hours in every morning, when it did not
rain; thirdly, the ordering, cutting, preserving, and cooking what
I had killed or caught for my supply; these took up great part of
the day. Also, it is to be considered, that in the middle of the
day, when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was
too great to stir out; so that about four hours in the evening was
all the time I could be supposed to work in, with this exception,
that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and working, and went
to work in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>To this short time allowed for labour I desire may be added the
exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for want
of tools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took up
out of my time. For example, I was full two and forty days in
making a board for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave;
whereas, two sawyers, with their tools and a saw-pit, would have
cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day.</p>

<p>My case was this: it was to be a large tree which was to be cut
down, because my board was to be a broad one. This tree I was three
days in cutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs, and
reducing it to a log or piece of timber. With inexpressible hacking
and hewing I reduced both the sides of it into chips till it began
to be light enough to move; then I turned it, and made one side of
it smooth and flat as a board from end to end; then, turning that
side downward, cut the other side til I brought the plank to be
about three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one may
judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of work; but labour
and patience carried me through that, and many other things. I only
observe this in particular, to show the reason why so much of my
time went away with so little work&mdash;viz. that what might be a
little to be done with help and tools, was a vast labour and
required a prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. But
notwithstanding this, with patience and labour I got through
everything that my circumstances made necessary to me to do, as
will appear by what follows.</p>

<p>I was now, in the months of November and December, expecting my
crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured and dug up for
them was not great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peck, for I had lost one whole crop by
sowing in the dry season. But now my crop promised very well, when
on a sudden I found I was in danger of losing it all again by
enemies of several sorts, which it was scarcely possible to keep
from it; as, first, the goats, and wild creatures which I called
hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and
day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that it could get
no time to shoot up into stalk.</p>

<p>This I saw no remedy for but by making an enclosure about it
with a hedge; which I did with a great deal of toil, and the more,
because it required speed. However, as my arable land was but
small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about
three weeks' time; and shooting some of the creatures in the
daytime, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to a
stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all night long; so
in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and the corn grew
very strong and well, and began to ripen apace.</p>

<p>But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in the
blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in
the ear; for, going along by the place to see how it throve, I saw
my little crop surrounded with fowls, of I know not how many sorts,
who stood, as it were, watching till I should be gone. I
immediately let fly among them, for I always had my gun with me. I
had no sooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud of fowls,
which I had not seen at all, from among the corn itself.</p>

<p>This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they
would devour all my hopes; that I should be starved, and never be
able to raise a crop at all; and what to do I could not tell;
however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I
should watch it night and day. In the first place, I went among it
to see what damage was already done, and found they had spoiled a
good deal of it; but that as it was yet too green for them, the
loss was not so great but that the remainder was likely to be a
good crop if it could be saved.</p>

<p>I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if
they only waited till I was gone away, and the event proved it to
be so; for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out
of their sight than they dropped down one by one into the corn
again. I was so provoked, that I could not have patience to stay
till more came on, knowing that every grain that they ate now was,
as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in the consequence; but
coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them.
This was what I wished for; so I took them up, and served them as
we serve notorious thieves in England&mdash;hanged them in chains,
for a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine that this
should have such an effect as it had, for the fowls would not only
not come at the corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of
the island, and I could never see a bird near the place as long as
my scarecrows hung there. This I was very glad of, you may be sure,
and about the latter end of December, which was our second harvest
of the year, I reaped my corn.</p>

<p>I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and
all I could do was to make one, as well as I could, out of one of
the broadswords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of
the ship. However, as my first crop was but small, I had no great
difficulty to cut it down; in short, I reaped it in my way, for I
cut nothing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great basket
which I had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands; and at the
end of all my harvesting, I found that out of my half-peck of seed
I had near two bushels of rice, and about two bushels and a half of
barley; that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure at that
time.</p>

<p>However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I foresaw
that, in time, it would please God to supply me with bread. And yet
here I was perplexed again, for I neither knew how to grind or make
meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor, if
made into meal, how to make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet
I knew not how to bake it. These things being added to my desire of
having a good quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply,
I resolved not to taste any of this crop but to preserve it all for
seed against the next season; and in the meantime to employ all my
study and hours of working to accomplish this great work of
providing myself with corn and bread.</p>

<p>It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. I
believe few people have thought much upon the strange multitude of
little things necessary in the providing, producing, curing,
dressing, making, and finishing this one article of bread.</p>

<p>I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my
daily discouragement; and was made more sensible of it every hour,
even after I had got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as I
have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise.</p>

<p>First, I had no plough to turn up the earth&mdash;no spade or
shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making me a wooden
spade, as I observed before; but this did my work but in a wooden
manner; and though it cost me a great many days to make it, yet,
for want of iron, it not only wore out soon, but made my work the
harder, and made it be performed much worse. However, this I bore
with, and was content to work it out with patience, and bear with
the badness of the performance. When the corn was sown, I had no
harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great heavy
bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be called, rather
than rake or harrow it. When it was growing, and grown, I have
observed already how many things I wanted to fence it, secure it,
mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it from the
chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it sieves to
dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake
it; but all these things I did without, as shall be observed; and
yet the corn was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me too.
All this, as I said, made everything laborious and tedious to me;
but that there was no help for. Neither was my time so much loss to
me, because, as I had divided it, a certain part of it was every
day appointed to these works; and as I had resolved to use none of
the corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had the
next six months to apply myself wholly, by labour and invention, to
furnish myself with utensils proper for the performing all the
operations necessary for making the corn, when I had it, fit for my
use.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX&mdash;A BOAT</h3>

<p>But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough
to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week's
work at least to make me a spade, which, when it was done, was but
a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required double labour to
work with it. However, I got through that, and sowed my seed in two
large flat pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find them
to my mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes of
which were all cut off that wood which I had set before, and knew
it would grow; so that, in a year's time, I knew I should have a
quick or living hedge, that would want but little repair. This work
did not take me up less than three months, because a great part of
that time was the wet season, when I could not go abroad.
Within-doors, that is when it rained and I could not go out, I
found employment in the following occupations&mdash;always
observing, that all the while I was at work I diverted myself with
talking to my parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly
taught him to know his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty
loud, "Poll," which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the
island by any mouth but my own. This, therefore, was not my work,
but an assistance to my work; for now, as I said, I had a great
employment upon my hands, as follows: I had long studied to make,
by some means or other, some earthen vessels, which, indeed, I
wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them. However,
considering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could
find out any clay, I might make some pots that might, being dried
in the sun, be hard enough and strong enough to bear handling, and
to hold anything that was dry, and required to be kept so; and as
this was necessary in the preparing corn, meal, &amp; c., which was
the thing I was doing, I resolved to make some as large as I could,
and fit only to stand like jars, to hold what should be put into
them.</p>

<p>It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell
how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste; what odd,
misshapen, ugly things I made; how many of them fell in and how
many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own
weight; how many cracked by the over-violent heat of the sun, being
set out too hastily; and how many fell in pieces with only
removing, as well before as after they were dried; and, in a word,
how, after having laboured hard to find the clay&mdash;to dig it,
to temper it, to bring it home, and work it&mdash;I could not make
above two large earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in
about two months' labour.</p>

<p>However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted
them very gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker
baskets, which I had made on purpose for them, that they might not
break; and as between the pot and the basket there was a little
room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and barley straw; and
these two pots being to stand always dry I thought would hold my
dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when the corn was bruised.</p>

<p>Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I
made several smaller things with better success; such as little
round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any things my
hand turned to; and the heat of the sun baked them quite hard.</p>

<p>But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an
earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which none
of these could do. It happened after some time, making a pretty
large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out after I
had done with it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthenware
vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I
was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself, that
certainly they might be made to burn whole, if they would burn
broken.</p>

<p>This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it burn
some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters burn in,
or of glazing them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with;
but I placed three large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile,
one upon another, and placed my firewood all round it, with a great
heap of embers under them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel round
the outside and upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside
red-hot quite through, and observed that they did not crack at all.
When I saw them clear red, I let them stand in that heat about five
or six hours, till I found one of them, though it did not crack,
did melt or run; for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted
by the violence of the heat, and would have run into glass if I had
gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually till the pots began to
abate of the red colour; and watching them all night, that I might
not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very
good (I will not say handsome) pipkins, and two other earthen pots,
as hard burnt as could be desired, and one of them perfectly glazed
with the running of the sand.</p>

<p>After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of
earthenware for my use; but I must needs say as to the shapes of
them, they were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I
had no way of making them but as the children make dirt pies, or as
a woman would make pies that never learned to raise paste.</p>

<p>No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine,
when I found I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire;
and I had hardly patience to stay till they were cold before I set
one on the fire again with some water in it to boil me some meat,
which it did admirably well; and with a piece of a kid I made some
very good broth, though I wanted oatmeal, and several other
ingredients requisite to make it as good as I would have had it
been.</p>

<p>My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat
some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving
at that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To supply this
want, I was at a great loss; for, of all the trades in the world, I
was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter as for any
whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it with. I spent many
a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow, and make
fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except what was in
the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out; nor
indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, but
were all of a sandy, crumbling stone, which neither would bear the
weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without filling
it with sand. So, after a great deal of time lost in searching for
a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a great block
of hard wood, which I found, indeed, much easier; and getting one
as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on
the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then with the help of fire
and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in
Brazil make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle
or beater of the wood called the iron-wood; and this I prepared and
laid by against I had my next crop of corn, which I proposed to
myself to grind, or rather pound into meal to make bread.</p>

<p>My next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce, to dress my
meal, and to part it from the bran and the husk; without which I
did not see it possible I could have any bread. This was a most
difficult thing even to think on, for to be sure I had nothing like
the necessary thing to make it&mdash;I mean fine thin canvas or
stuff to searce the meal through. And here I was at a full stop for
many months; nor did I really know what to do. Linen I had none
left but what was mere rags; I had goat's hair, but neither knew
how to weave it or spin it; and had I known how, here were no tools
to work it with. All the remedy that I found for this was, that at
last I did remember I had, among the seamen's clothes which were
saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin; and
with some pieces of these I made three small sieves proper enough
for the work; and thus I made shift for some years: how I did
afterwards, I shall show in its place.</p>

<p>The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I
should make bread when I came to have corn; for first, I had no
yeast. As to that part, there was no supplying the want, so I did
not concern myself much about it. But for an oven I was indeed in
great pain. At length I found out an experiment for that also,
which was this: I made some earthen-vessels very broad but not
deep, that is to say, about two feet diameter, and not above nine
inches deep. These I burned in the fire, as I had done the other,
and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire
upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square tiles of my own
baking and burning also; but I should not call them square.</p>

<p>When the firewood was burned pretty much into embers or live
coals, I drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all
over, and there I let them lie till the hearth was very hot. Then
sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf or loaves, and
whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew the embers all round
the outside of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat; and thus as
well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my barley-loaves,
and became in little time a good pastrycook into the bargain; for I
made myself several cakes and puddings of the rice; but I made no
pies, neither had I anything to put into them supposing I had,
except the flesh either of fowls or goats.</p>

<p>It need not be wondered at if all these things took me up most
part of the third year of my abode here; for it is to be observed
that in the intervals of these things I had my new harvest and
husbandry to manage; for I reaped my corn in its season, and
carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear, in
my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out, for I had no floor
to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with.</p>

<p>And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to
build my barns bigger; I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the
increase of the corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the
barley about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much or more;
insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use it freely; for my
bread had been quite gone a great while; also I resolved to see
what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year, and to sow
but once a year.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and
rice were much more than I could consume in a year; so I resolved
to sow just the same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in
hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me with bread, &amp;
c.</p>

<p>All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my
thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen
from the other side of the island; and I was not without secret
wishes that I were on shore there, fancying that, seeing the
mainland, and an inhabited country, I might find some way or other
to convey myself further, and perhaps at last find some means of
escape.</p>

<p>But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such
an undertaking, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and
perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than the
lions and tigers of Africa: that if I once came in their power, I
should run a hazard of more than a thousand to one of being killed,
and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the people of the
Caribbean coast were cannibals or man-eaters, and I knew by the
latitude that I could not be far from that shore. Then, supposing
they were not cannibals, yet they might kill me, as many Europeans
who had fallen into their hands had been served, even when they had
been ten or twenty together&mdash;much more I, that was but one,
and could make little or no defence; all these things, I say, which
I ought to have considered well; and did come into my thoughts
afterwards, yet gave me no apprehensions at first, and my head ran
mightily upon the thought of getting over to the shore.</p>

<p>Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with
shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles
on the coast of Africa; but this was in vain: then I thought I
would go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was
blown up upon the shore a great way, in the storm, when we were
first cast away. She lay almost where she did at first, but not
quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves and the winds,
almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of beachy, rough sand,
but no water about her. If I had had hands to have refitted her,
and to have launched her into the water, the boat would have done
well enough, and I might have gone back into the Brazils with her
easily enough; but I might have foreseen that I could no more turn
her and set her upright upon her bottom than I could remove the
island; however, I went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers,
and brought them to the boat resolving to try what I could do;
suggesting to myself that if I could but turn her down, I might
repair the damage she had received, and she would be a very good
boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily.</p>

<p>I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and
spent, I think, three or four weeks about it; at last finding it
impossible to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to
digging away the sand, to undermine it, and so to make it fall
down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the
fall.</p>

<p>But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or
to get under it, much less to move it forward towards the water; so
I was forced to give it over; and yet, though I gave over the hopes
of the boat, my desire to venture over for the main increased,
rather than decreased, as the means for it seemed impossible.</p>

<p>This at length put me upon thinking whether it was not possible
to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those
climates make, even without tools, or, as I might say, without
hands, of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought
possible, but easy, and pleased myself extremely with the thoughts
of making it, and with my having much more convenience for it than
any of the negroes or Indians; but not at all considering the
particular inconveniences which I lay under more than the Indians
did&mdash;viz. want of hands to move it, when it was made, into the
water&mdash;a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all
the consequences of want of tools could be to them; for what was it
to me, if when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, and with much
trouble cut it down, if I had been able with my tools to hew and
dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut
out the inside to make it hollow, so as to make a boat of
it&mdash;if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I
found it, and not be able to launch it into the water?</p>

<p>One would have thought I could not have had the least reflection
upon my mind of my circumstances while I was making this boat, but
I should have immediately thought how I should get it into the sea;
but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it,
that I never once considered how I should get it off the land: and
it was really, in its own nature, more easy for me to guide it over
forty-five miles of sea than about forty-five fathoms of land,
where it lay, to set it afloat in the water.</p>

<p>I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man
did who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the
design, without determining whether I was ever able to undertake
it; not but that the difficulty of launching my boat came often
into my head; but I put a stop to my inquiries into it by this
foolish answer which I gave myself&mdash;"Let me first make it; I
warrant I will find some way or other to get it along when it is
done."</p>

<p>This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my
fancy prevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar-tree, and I
question much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building
of the Temple of Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter at
the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter
at the end of twenty-two feet; after which it lessened for a while,
and then parted into branches. It was not without infinite labour
that I felled this tree; I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it
at the bottom; I was fourteen more getting the branches and limbs
and the vast spreading head cut off, which I hacked and hewed
through with axe and hatchet, and inexpressible labour; after this,
it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to
something like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as
it ought to do. It cost me near three months more to clear the
inside, and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it; this I
did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the
dint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be a very handsome
periagua, and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, and
consequently big enough to have carried me and all my cargo.</p>

<p>When I had gone through this work I was extremely delighted with
it. The boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or
periagua, that was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary
stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and had I gotten it into the
water, I make no question, but I should have begun the maddest
voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed, that ever was
undertaken.</p>

<p>But all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though
they cost me infinite labour too. It lay about one hundred yards
from the water, and not more; but the first inconvenience was, it
was up hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this
discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth,
and so make a declivity: this I began, and it cost me a prodigious
deal of pains (but who grudge pains who have their deliverance in
view?); but when this was worked through, and this difficulty
managed, it was still much the same, for I could no more stir the
canoe than I could the other boat. Then I measured the distance of
ground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water up
to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down to the water.
Well, I began this work; and when I began to enter upon it, and
calculate how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was
to be thrown out, I found that, by the number of hands I had, being
none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve years before I
could have gone through with it; for the shore lay so high, that at
the upper end it must have been at least twenty feet deep; so at
length, though with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt over
also.</p>

<p>This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the
folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we
judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it.</p>

<p>In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this
place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as
much comfort as ever before; for, by a constant study and serious
application to the Word of God, and by the assistance of His grace,
I gained a different knowledge from what I had before. I
entertained different notions of things. I looked now upon the
world as a thing remote, which I had nothing to do with, no
expectations from, and, indeed, no desires about: in a word, I had
nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever likely to have, so I
thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it
hereafter&mdash;viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of
it; and well might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives, "Between me
and thee is a great gulf fixed."</p>

<p>In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the
world here; I had neither the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the
eye, nor the pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all
that I was now capable of enjoying; I was lord of the whole manor;
or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the
whole country which I had possession of: there were no rivals; I
had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command with me:
I might have raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had no use for it;
so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my occasion. I had
tortoise or turtle enough, but now and then one was as much as I
could put to any use: I had timber enough to have built a fleet of
ships; and I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cured
into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it had been built.</p>

<p>But all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I had
enough to eat and supply my wants, and what was all the rest to me?
If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or
vermin; if I sowed more corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled;
the trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the ground; I could
make no more use of them but for fuel, and that I had no occasion
for but to dress my food.</p>

<p>In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me,
upon just reflection, that all the good things of this world are no
farther good to us than they are for our use; and that, whatever we
may heap up to give others, we enjoy just as much as we can use,
and no more. The most covetous, griping miser in the world would
have been cured of the vice of covetousness if he had been in my
case; for I possessed infinitely more than I knew what to do with.
I had no room for desire, except it was of things which I had not,
and they were but trifles, though, indeed, of great use to me. I
had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver,
about thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas! there the sorry, useless
stuff lay; I had no more manner of business for it; and often
thought with myself that I would have given a handful of it for a
gross of tobacco-pipes; or for a hand-mill to grind my corn; nay, I
would have given it all for a sixpenny-worth of turnip and carrot
seed out of England, or for a handful of peas and beans, and a
bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least advantage by it or
benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with
the damp of the cave in the wet seasons; and if I had had the
drawer full of diamonds, it had been the same case&mdash;they had
been of no manner of value to me, because of no use.</p>

<p>I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself
than it was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my
body. I frequently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and admired
the hand of God's providence, which had thus spread my table in the
wilderness. I learned to look more upon the bright side of my
condition, and less upon the dark side, and to consider what I
enjoyed rather than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes such
secret comforts, that I cannot express them; and which I take
notice of here, to put those discontented people in mind of it, who
cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them, because they see
and covet something that He has not given them. All our discontents
about what we want appeared to me to spring from the want of
thankfulness for what we have.</p>

<p>Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would
be so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was;
and this was, to compare my present condition with what I at first
expected it would be; nay, with what it would certainly have been,
if the good providence of God had not wonderfully ordered the ship
to be cast up nearer to the shore, where I not only could come at
her, but could bring what I got out of her to the shore, for my
relief and comfort; without which, I had wanted for tools to work,
weapons for defence, and gunpowder and shot for getting my
food.</p>

<p>I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to
myself, in the most lively colours, how I must have acted if I had
got nothing out of the ship. How I could not have so much as got
any food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it was long before
I found any of them, I must have perished first; that I should have
lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savage; that if I had
killed a goat or a fowl, by any contrivance, I had no way to flay
or open it, or part the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to
cut it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my
claws, like a beast.</p>

<p>These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of
Providence to me, and very thankful for my present condition, with
all its hardships and misfortunes; and this part also I cannot but
recommend to the reflection of those who are apt, in their misery,
to say, "Is any affliction like mine?" Let them consider how much
worse the cases of some people are, and their case might have been,
if Providence had thought fit.</p>

<p>I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my
mind with hopes; and this was comparing my present situation with
what I had deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from the
hand of Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly
destitute of the knowledge and fear of God. I had been well
instructed by father and mother; neither had they been wanting to
me in their early endeavours to infuse a religious awe of God into
my mind, a sense of my duty, and what the nature and end of my
being required of me. But, alas! falling early into the seafaring
life, which of all lives is the most destitute of the fear of God,
though His terrors are always before them; I say, falling early
into the seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that
little sense of religion which I had entertained was laughed out of
me by my messmates; by a hardened despising of dangers, and the
views of death, which grew habitual to me by my long absence from
all manner of opportunities to converse with anything but what was
like myself, or to hear anything that was good or tended towards
it.</p>

<p>So void was I of everything that was good, or the least sense of
what I was, or was to be, that, in the greatest deliverances I
enjoyed&mdash;such as my escape from Sallee; my being taken up by
the Portuguese master of the ship; my being planted so well in the
Brazils; my receiving the cargo from England, and the like&mdash;I
never had once the words "Thank God!" so much as on my mind, or in
my mouth; nor in the greatest distress had I so much as a thought
to pray to Him, or so much as to say, "Lord, have mercy upon me!"
no, nor to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear by, and
blaspheme it.</p>

<p>I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I
have already observed, on account of my wicked and hardened life
past; and when I looked about me, and considered what particular
providences had attended me since my coming into this place, and
how God had dealt bountifully with me&mdash;had not only punished
me less than my iniquity had deserved, but had so plentifully
provided for me&mdash;this gave me great hopes that my repentance
was accepted, and that God had yet mercy in store for me.</p>

<p>With these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to a
resignation to the will of God in the present disposition of my
circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my condition;
and that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing
I had not the due punishment of my sins; that I enjoyed so many
mercies which I had no reason to have expected in that place; that
I ought never more to repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and
to give daily thanks for that daily bread, which nothing but a
crowd of wonders could have brought; that I ought to consider I had
been fed even by a miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah
by ravens, nay, by a long series of miracles; and that I could
hardly have named a place in the uninhabitable part of the world
where I could have been cast more to my advantage; a place where,
as I had no society, which was my affliction on one hand, so I
found no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten
my life; no venomous creatures, or poisons, which I might feed on
to my hurt; no savages to murder and devour me. In a word, as my
life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a life of mercy
another; and I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort but to
be able to make my sense of God's goodness to me, and care over me
in this condition, be my daily consolation; and after I did make a
just improvement on these things, I went away, and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long that many things which I had brought on
shore for my help were either quite gone, or very much wasted and
near spent.</p>

<p>My ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very
little, which I eked out with water, a little and a little, till it
was so pale, it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper.
As long as it lasted I made use of it to minute down the days of
the month on which any remarkable thing happened to me; and first,
by casting up times past, I remembered that there was a strange
concurrence of days in the various providences which befell me, and
which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to observe days as
fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason to have looked upon
with a great deal of curiosity.</p>

<p>First, I had observed that the same day that I broke away from
my father and friends and ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea,
the same day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and
made a slave; the same day of the year that I escaped out of the
wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day-year afterwards
I made my escape from Sallee in a boat; the same day of the year I
was born on&mdash;viz. the 30th of September, that same day I had
my life so miraculously saved twenty-six years after, when I was
cast on shore in this island; so that my wicked life and my
solitary life began both on a day.</p>

<p>The next thing to my ink being wasted was that of my
bread&mdash;I mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship;
this I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but one
cake of bread a-day for above a year; and yet I was quite without
bread for near a year before I got any corn of my own, and great
reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the getting it
being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous.</p>

<p>My clothes, too, began to decay; as to linen, I had had none a
good while, except some chequered shirts which I found in the
chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully preserved;
because many times I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt;
and it was a very great help to me that I had, among all the men's
clothes of the ship, almost three dozen of shirts. There were also,
indeed, several thick watch-coats of the seamen's which were left,
but they were too hot to wear; and though it is true that the
weather was so violently hot that there was no need of clothes, yet
I could not go quite naked&mdash;no, though I had been inclined to
it, which I was not&mdash;nor could I abide the thought of it,
though I was alone. The reason why I could not go naked was, I
could not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with
some clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin:
whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and
whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No
more could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sun
without a cap or a hat; the heat of the sun, beating with such
violence as it does in that place, would give me the headache
presently, by darting so directly on my head, without a cap or hat
on, so that I could not bear it; whereas, if I put on my hat it
would presently go away.</p>

<p>Upon these views I began to consider about putting the few rags
I had, which I called clothes, into some order; I had worn out all
the waistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I could not
make jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by me, and
with such other materials as I had; so I set to work, tailoring, or
rather, indeed, botching, for I made most piteous work of it.
However, I made shift to make two or three new waistcoats, which I
hoped would serve me a great while: as for breeches or drawers, I
made but a very sorry shift indeed till afterwards.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones, and I had them hung up,
stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which means some of them
were so dry and hard that they were fit for little, but others were
very useful. The first thing I made of these was a great cap for my
head, with the hair on the outside, to shoot off the rain; and this
I performed so well, that after I made me a suit of clothes wholly
of these skins&mdash;that is to say, a waistcoat, and breeches open
at the knees, and both loose, for they were rather wanting to keep
me cool than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that
they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a
worse tailor. However, they were such as I made very good shift
with, and when I was out, if it happened to rain, the hair of my
waistcoat and cap being outermost, I was kept very dry.</p>

<p>After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make an
umbrella; I was, indeed, in great want of one, and had a great mind
to make one; I had seen them made in the Brazils, where they are
very useful in the great heats there, and I felt the heats every
jot as great here, and greater too, being nearer the equinox;
besides, as I was obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful
thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of
pains with it, and was a great while before I could make anything
likely to hold: nay, after I had thought I had hit the way, I
spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind: but at last I
made one that answered indifferently well: the main difficulty I
found was to make it let down. I could make it spread, but if it
did not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any
way but just over my head, which would not do. However, at last, as
I said, I made one to answer, and covered it with skins, the hair
upwards, so that it cast off the rain like a pent-house, and kept
off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of
the weather with greater advantage than I could before in the
coolest, and when I had no need of it could close it, and carry it
under my arm.</p>

<p>Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely composed
by resigning myself to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly
upon the disposal of His providence. This made my life better than
sociable, for when I began to regret the want of conversation I
would ask myself, whether thus conversing mutually with my own
thoughts, and (as I hope I may say) with even God Himself, by
ejaculations, was not better than the utmost enjoyment of human
society in the world?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X&mdash;TAMES GOATS</h3>

<p>I cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary
thing happened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the
same posture and place, as before; the chief things I was employed
in, besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and
curing my raisins, of both which I always kept up just enough to
have sufficient stock of one year's provisions beforehand; I say,
besides this yearly labour, and my daily pursuit of going out with
my gun, I had one labour, to make a canoe, which at last I
finished: so that, by digging a canal to it of six feet wide and
four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half a mile. As
for the first, which was so vastly big, for I made it without
considering beforehand, as I ought to have done, how I should be
able to launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the water,
or bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was
as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time: indeed, the
next time, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in
a place where I could not get the water to it at any less distance
than, as I have said, near half a mile, yet, as I saw it was
practicable at last, I never gave it over; and though I was near
two years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes of
having a boat to go off to sea at last.</p>

<p>However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of
it was not at all answerable to the design which I had in view when
I made the first; I mean of venturing over to the <i>terra
firma</i>, where it was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and now
I thought no more of it. As I had a boat, my next design was to
make a cruise round the island; for as I had been on the other side
in one place, crossing, as I have already described it, over the
land, so the discoveries I made in that little journey made me very
eager to see other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I
thought of nothing but sailing round the island.</p>

<p>For this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion and
consideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and made a
sail too out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails which lay in
store, and of which I had a great stock by me. Having fitted my
mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found she would sail very
well; then I made little lockers or boxes at each end of my boat,
to put provisions, necessaries, ammunition, &amp; c., into, to be
kept dry, either from rain or the spray of the sea; and a little,
long, hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could
lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to keep it dry.</p>

<p>I fixed my umbrella also in the step at the stern, like a mast,
to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an
awning; and thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon the
sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little creek. At
last, being eager to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I
resolved upon my cruise; and accordingly I victualled my ship for
the voyage, putting in two dozen of loaves (cakes I should call
them) of barley-bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice (a food
I ate a good deal of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and
powder and shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of
those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's
chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in
the night.</p>

<p>It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my
reign&mdash;or my captivity, which you please&mdash;that I set out
on this voyage, and I found it much longer than I expected; for
though the island itself was not very large, yet when I came to the
east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two
leagues into the sea, some above water, some under it; and beyond
that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more, so that I was
obliged to go a great way out to sea to double the point.</p>

<p>When I first discovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it might
oblige me to go out to sea; and above all, doubting how I should
get back again: so I came to an anchor; for I had made a kind of an
anchor with a piece of a broken grappling which I got out of the
ship.</p>

<p>Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore,
climbing up a hill, which seemed to overlook that point where I saw
the full extent of it, and resolved to venture.</p>

<p>In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived
a strong, and indeed a most furious current, which ran to the east,
and even came close to the point; and I took the more notice of it
because I saw there might be some danger that when I came into it I
might be carried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able
to make the island again; and indeed, had I not got first upon this
hill, I believe it would have been so; for there was the same
current on the other side the island, only that it set off at a
further distance, and I saw there was a strong eddy under the
shore; so I had nothing to do but to get out of the first current,
and I should presently be in an eddy.</p>

<p>I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty
fresh at ESE., and that being just contrary to the current, made a
great breach of the sea upon the point: so that it was not safe for
me to keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to go too far
off, because of the stream.</p>

<p>The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated overnight,
the sea was calm, and I ventured: but I am a warning to all rash
and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point, when I
was not even my boat's length from the shore, but I found myself in
a great depth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill; it
carried my boat along with it with such violence that all I could
do could not keep her so much as on the edge of it; but I found it
hurried me farther and farther out from the eddy, which was on my
left hand. There was no wind stirring to help me, and all I could
do with my paddles signified nothing: and now I began to give
myself over for lost; for as the current was on both sides of the
island, I knew in a few leagues distance they must join again, and
then I was irrecoverably gone; nor did I see any possibility of
avoiding it; so that I had no prospect before me but of perishing,
not by the sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving from
hunger. I had, indeed, found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost
as I could lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had a great
jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen pots; but
what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be
sure, there was no shore, no mainland or island, for a thousand
leagues at least?</p>

<p>And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make
even the most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now I looked
back upon my desolate, solitary island as the most pleasant place
in the world and all the happiness my heart could wish for was to
be but there again. I stretched out my hands to it, with eager
wishes&mdash;"O happy desert!" said I, "I shall never see thee
more. O miserable creature! whither am going?" Then I reproached
myself with my unthankful temper, and that I had repined at my
solitary condition; and now what would I give to be on shore there
again! Thus, we never see the true state of our condition till it
is illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know how to value what
we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is scarcely possible to imagine
the consternation I was now in, being driven from my beloved island
(for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost
two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again.
However, I worked hard till, indeed, my strength was almost
exhausted, and kept my boat as much to the northward, that is,
towards the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as possibly
I could; when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought
I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing up from SSE.
This cheered my heart a little, and especially when, in about
half-an-hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale. By this time I had
got at a frightful distance from the island, and had the least
cloudy or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way,
too; for I had no compass on board, and should never have known how
to have steered towards the island, if I had but once lost sight of
it; but the weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up my
mast again, and spread my sail, standing away to the north as much
as possible, to get out of the current.</p>

<p>Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to
stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water some
alteration of the current was near; for where the current was so
strong the water was foul; but perceiving the water clear, I found
the current abate; and presently I found to the east, at about half
a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks: these rocks I found
caused the current to part again, and as the main stress of it ran
away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the
other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made a strong eddy,
which ran back again to the north-west, with a very sharp
stream.</p>

<p>They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon
the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder
them, or who have been in such extremities, may guess what my
present surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the
stream of this eddy; and the wind also freshening, how gladly I
spread my sail to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with
a strong tide or eddy underfoot.</p>

<p>This eddy carried me about a league on my way back again,
directly towards the island, but about two leagues more to the
northward than the current which carried me away at first; so that
when I came near the island, I found myself open to the northern
shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the island, opposite
to that which I went out from.</p>

<p>When I had made something more than a league of way by the help
of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no
further. However, I found that being between two great
currents&mdash;viz. that on the south side, which had hurried me
away, and that on the north, which lay about a league on the other
side; I say, between these two, in the wake of the island, I found
the water at least still, and running no way; and having still a
breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the
island, though not making such fresh way as I did before.</p>

<p>About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a league of
the island, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this
disaster stretching out, as is described before, to the southward,
and casting off the current more southerly, had, of course, made
another eddy to the north; and this I found very strong, but not
directly setting the way my course lay, which was due west, but
almost full north. However, having a fresh gale, I stretched across
this eddy, slanting north-west; and in about an hour came within
about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon got
to land.</p>

<p>When I was on shore, God I fell on my knees and gave God thanks
for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my
deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with such things as I
had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I
had spied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite
spent with the labour and fatigue of the voyage.</p>

<p>I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat! I
had run so much hazard, and knew too much of the case, to think of
attempting it by the way I went out; and what might be at the other
side (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run
any more ventures; so I resolved on the next morning to make my way
westward along the shore, and to see if there was no creek where I
might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again if I
wanted her. In about three miles or thereabouts, coasting the
shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about a mile over, which
narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or brook, where I
found a very convenient harbour for my boat, and where she lay as
if she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her. Here I
put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to
look about me, and see where I was.</p>

<p>I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had
been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so taking
nothing out of my boat but my gun and umbrella, for it was
exceedingly hot, I began my march. The way was comfortable enough
after such a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached my old bower
in the evening, where I found everything standing as I left it; for
I always kept it in good order, being, as I said before, my country
house.</p>

<p>I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my
limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep; but judge you, if you
can, that read my story, what a surprise I must be in when I was
awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me by my name several
times, "Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe: poor Robin Crusoe! Where are
you, Robin Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you been?"</p>

<p>I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or
part of the day, and with walking the latter part, that I did not
wake thoroughly; but dozing thought I dreamed that somebody spoke
to me; but as the voice continued to repeat, "Robin Crusoe, Robin
Crusoe," at last I began to wake more perfectly, and was at first
dreadfully frightened, and started up in the utmost consternation;
but no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the
top of the hedge; and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to
me; for just in such bemoaning language I had used to talk to him
and teach him; and he had learned it so perfectly that he would sit
upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face and cry, "Poor
Robin Crusoe! Where are you? Where have you been? How came you
here?" and such things as I had taught him.</p>

<p>However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed
it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose
myself. First, I was amazed how the creature got thither; and then,
how he should just keep about the place, and nowhere else; but as I
was well satisfied it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over
it; and holding out my hand, and calling him by his name, "Poll,"
the sociable creature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used
to do, and continued talking to me, "Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did
I come here? and where had I been?" just as if he had been
overjoyed to see me again; and so I carried him home along with
me.</p>

<p>I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had
enough to do for many days to sit still and reflect upon the danger
I had been in. I would have been very glad to have had my boat
again on my side of the island; but I knew not how it was
practicable to get it about. As to the east side of the island,
which I had gone round, I knew well enough there was no venturing
that way; my very heart would shrink, and my very blood run chill,
but to think of it; and as to the other side of the island, I did
not know how it might be there; but supposing the current ran with
the same force against the shore at the east as it passed by it on
the other, I might run the same risk of being driven down the
stream, and carried by the island, as I had been before of being
carried away from it: so with these thoughts, I contented myself to
be without any boat, though it had been the product of so many
months' labour to make it, and of so many more to get it into the
sea.</p>

<p>In this government of my temper I remained near a year; and
lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; and my
thoughts being very much composed as to my condition, and fully
comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of Providence, I
thought I lived really very happily in all things except that of
society.</p>

<p>I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises
which my necessities put me upon applying myself to; and I believe
I should, upon occasion, have made a very good carpenter,
especially considering how few tools I had.</p>

<p>Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my
earthenware, and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel,
which I found infinitely easier and better; because I made things
round and shaped, which before were filthy things indeed to look
on. But I think I was never more vain of my own performance, or
more joyful for anything I found out, than for my being able to
make a tobacco-pipe; and though it was a very ugly, clumsy thing
when it was done, and only burned red, like other earthenware, yet
as it was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, I was
exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been always used to smoke;
and there were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not
thinking there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I
searched the ship again, I could not come at any pipes.</p>

<p>In my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made abundance of
necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed me; though not
very handsome, yet they were such as were very handy and convenient
for laying things up in, or fetching things home. For example, if I
killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, dress
it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket; and the
like by a turtle; I could cut it up, take out the eggs and a piece
or two of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home
in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also, large deep baskets
were the receivers of my corn, which I always rubbed out as soon as
it was dry and cured, and kept it in great baskets.</p>

<p>I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; this was
a want which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began
seriously to consider what I must do when I should have no more
powder; that is to say, how I should kill any goats. I had, as is
observed in the third year of my being here, kept a young kid, and
bred her up tame, and I was in hopes of getting a he-goat; but I
could not by any means bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old
goat; and as I could never find in my heart to kill her, she died
at last of mere age.</p>

<p>But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I
have said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some
art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I could not catch
some of them alive; and particularly I wanted a she-goat great with
young. For this purpose I made snares to hamper them; and I do
believe they were more than once taken in them; but my tackle was
not good, for I had no wire, and I always found them broken and my
bait devoured. At length I resolved to try a pitfall; so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I had observed the
goats used to feed, and over those pits I placed hurdles of my own
making too, with a great weight upon them; and several times I put
ears of barley and dry rice without setting the trap; and I could
easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn,
for I could see the marks of their feet. At length I set three
traps in one night, and going the next morning I found them, all
standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone; this was very
discouraging. However, I altered my traps; and not to trouble you
with particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I found in one
of them a large old he-goat; and in one of the others three kids, a
male and two females.</p>

<p>As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was so
fierce I durst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to bring
him away alive, which was what I wanted. I could have killed him,
but that was not my business, nor would it answer my end; so I even
let him out, and he ran away as if he had been frightened out of
his wits. But I did not then know what I afterwards learned, that
hunger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay three or four days
without food, and then have carried him some water to drink and
then a little corn, he would have been as tame as one of the kids;
for they are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they are
well used.</p>

<p>However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that
time: then I went to the three kids, and taking them one by one, I
tied them with strings together, and with some difficulty brought
them all home.</p>

<p>It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing them
some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. And
now I found that if I expected to supply myself with goats' flesh,
when I had no powder or shot left, breeding some up tame was my
only way, when, perhaps, I might have them about my house like a
flock of sheep. But then it occurred to me that I must keep the
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild when they
grew up; and the only way for this was to have some enclosed piece
of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them in
so effectually, that those within might not break out, or those
without break in.</p>

<p>This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands yet, as I saw
there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was to
find out a proper piece of ground, where there was likely to be
herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep
them from the sun.</p>

<p>Those who understand such enclosures will think I had very
little contrivance when I pitched upon a place very proper for all
these (being a plain, open piece of meadow land, or savannah, as
our people call it in the western colonies), which had two or three
little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end was very
woody&mdash;I say, they will smile at my forecast, when I shall
tell them I began by enclosing this piece of ground in such a
manner that, my hedge or pale must have been at least two miles
about. Nor was the madness of it so great as to the compass, for if
it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough to do it in;
but I did not consider that my goats would be as wild in so much
compass as if they had had the whole island, and I should have so
much room to chase them in that I should never catch them.</p>

<p>My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards
when this thought occurred to me; so I presently stopped short,
and, for the beginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about one
hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred yards in
breadth, which, as it would maintain as many as I should have in
any reasonable time, so, as my stock increased, I could add more
ground to my enclosure.</p>

<p>This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with
courage. I was about three months hedging in the first piece; and,
till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the best part of
it, and used them to feed as near me as possible, to make them
familiar; and very often I would go and carry them some ears of
barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand; so that
after my enclosure was finished and I let them loose, they would
follow me up and down, bleating after me for a handful of corn.</p>

<p>This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a
flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more I
had three-and-forty, besides several that I took and killed for my
food. After that, I enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed
them in, with little pens to drive them to take them as I wanted,
and gates out of one piece of ground into another.</p>

<p>But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's flesh to
feed on when I pleased, but milk too&mdash;a thing which, indeed,
in the beginning, I did not so much as think of, and which, when it
came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise, for now I
set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a
day. And as Nature, who gives supplies of food to every creature,
dictates even naturally how to make use of it, so I, that had never
milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or cheese made only
when I was a boy, after a great many essays and miscarriages, made
both butter and cheese at last, also salt (though I found it partly
made to my hand by the heat of the sun upon some of the rocks of
the sea), and never wanted it afterwards. How mercifully can our
Creator treat His creatures, even in those conditions in which they
seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How can He sweeten the
bitterest providences, and give us cause to praise Him for dungeons
and prisons! What a table was here spread for me in the wilderness,
where I saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI&mdash;FINDS PRINT OF MAN'S FOOT ON THE SAND</h3>

<p>It would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me and my little
family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty the prince and lord
of the whole island; I had the lives of all my subjects at my
absolute command; I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it
away, and no rebels among all my subjects. Then, to see how like a
king I dined, too, all alone, attended by my servants! Poll, as if
he had been my favourite, was the only person permitted to talk to
me. My dog, who was now grown old and crazy, and had found no
species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand; and
two cats, one on one side of the table and one on the other,
expecting now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of especial
favour.</p>

<p>But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at
first, for they were both of them dead, and had been interred near
my habitation by my own hand; but one of them having multiplied by
I know not what kind of creature, these were two which I had
preserved tame; whereas the rest ran wild in the woods, and became
indeed troublesome to me at last, for they would often come into my
house, and plunder me too, till at last I was obliged to shoot
them, and did kill a great many; at length they left me. With this
attendance and in this plentiful manner I lived; neither could I be
said to want anything but society; and of that, some time after
this, I was likely to have too much.</p>

<p>I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use
of my boat, though very loath to run any more hazards; and
therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the
island, and at other times I sat myself down contented enough
without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down
to the point of the island where, as I have said in my last ramble,
I went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the current
set, that I might see what I had to do: this inclination increased
upon me every day, and at length I resolved to travel thither by
land, following the edge of the shore. I did so; but had any one in
England met such a man as I was, it must either have frightened
him, or raised a great deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood
still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my
travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage, and in such a
dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as follows.</p>

<p>I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with a
flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to
shoot the rain off from running into my neck, nothing being so
hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the
clothes.</p>

<p>I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down to
about the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches
of the same; the breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat,
whose hair hung down such a length on either side that, like
pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my legs; stockings and
shoes I had none, but had made me a pair of somethings, I scarce
knew what to call them, like buskins, to flap over my legs, and
lace on either side like spatterdashes, but of a most barbarous
shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.</p>

<p>I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew
together with two thongs of the same instead of buckles, and in a
kind of a frog on either side of this, instead of a sword and
dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side and one on
the other. I had another belt not so broad, and fastened in the
same manner, which hung over my shoulder, and at the end of it,
under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's skin too,
in one of which hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my back I
carried my basket, and on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a
great clumsy, ugly, goat's-skin umbrella, but which, after all, was
the most necessary thing I had about me next to my gun. As for my
face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-like as one might
expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living within nine
or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard I had once suffered to grow
till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both
scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except
what grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large pair of
Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks at
Sallee, for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did; of
these moustachios, or whiskers, I will not say they were long
enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length and
shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would have passed
for frightful.</p>

<p>But all this is by-the-bye; for as to my figure, I had so few to
observe me that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say no
more of that. In this kind of dress I went my new journey, and was
out five or six days. I travelled first along the sea-shore,
directly to the place where I first brought my boat to an anchor to
get upon the rocks; and having no boat now to take care of, I went
over the land a nearer way to the same height that I was upon
before, when, looking forward to the points of the rocks which lay
out, and which I was obliged to double with my boat, as is said
above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet&mdash;no
rippling, no motion, no current, any more there than in other
places. I was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to
spend some time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the
sets of the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently convinced
how it was&mdash;viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the west,
and joining with the current of waters from some great river on the
shore, must be the occasion of this current, and that, according as
the wind blew more forcibly from the west or from the north, this
current came nearer or went farther from the shore; for, waiting
thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock again, and then the
tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current again as before,
only that it ran farther off, being near half a league from the
shore, whereas in my case it set close upon the shore, and hurried
me and my canoe along with it, which at another time it would not
have done.</p>

<p>This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to
observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very
easily bring my boat about the island again; but when I began to
think of putting it in practice, I had such terror upon my spirits
at the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that I could not
think of it again with any patience, but, on the contrary, I took
up another resolution, which was more safe, though more
laborious&mdash;and this was, that I would build, or rather make,
me another periagua or canoe, and so have one for one side of the
island, and one for the other.</p>

<p>You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two
plantations in the island&mdash;one my little fortification or
tent, with the wall about it, under the rock, with the cave behind
me, which by this time I had enlarged into several apartments or
caves, one within another. One of these, which was the driest and
largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or
fortification&mdash;that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to
the rock&mdash;was all filled up with the large earthen pots of
which I have given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great
baskets, which would hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up
my stores of provisions, especially my corn, some in the ear, cut
off short from the straw, and the other rubbed out with my
hand.</p>

<p>As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so
big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least
appearance, to any one's view, of any habitation behind them.</p>

<p>Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the
land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which
I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their
harvest in its season; and whenever I had occasion for more corn, I
had more land adjoining as fit as that.</p>

<p>Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a tolerable
plantation there also; for, first, I had my little bower, as I
called it, which I kept in repair&mdash;that is to say, I kept the
hedge which encircled it in constantly fitted up to its usual
height, the ladder standing always in the inside. I kept the trees,
which at first were no more than stakes, but were now grown very
firm and tall, always cut, so that they might spread and grow thick
and wild, and make the more agreeable shade, which they did
effectually to my mind. In the middle of this I had my tent always
standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles, set up for
that purpose, and which never wanted any repair or renewing; and
under this I had made me a squab or couch with the skins of the
creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket
laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had
saved; and a great watch-coat to cover me. And here, whenever I had
occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my country
habitation.</p>

<p>Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to
say my goats, and I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to
fence and enclose this ground. I was so anxious to see it kept
entire, lest the goats should break through, that I never left off
till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so
full of small stakes, and so near to one another, that it was
rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce room to put a hand
through between them; which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as
they all did in the next rainy season, made the enclosure strong
like a wall, indeed stronger than any wall.</p>

<p>This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared
no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my
comfortable support, for I considered the keeping up a breed of
tame creatures thus at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh,
milk, butter, and cheese for me as long as I lived in the place, if
it were to be forty years; and that keeping them in my reach
depended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to such a degree
that I might be sure of keeping them together; which by this
method, indeed, I so effectually secured, that when these little
stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick that I was
forced to pull some of them up again.</p>

<p>In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally
depended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never
failed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable
dainty of my whole diet; and indeed they were not only agreeable,
but medicinal, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last
degree.</p>

<p>As this was also about half-way between my other habitation and
the place where I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay
here in my way thither, for I used frequently to visit my boat; and
I kept all things about or belonging to her in very good order.
Sometimes I went out in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous
voyages would I go, scarcely ever above a stone's cast or two from
the shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried out of my
knowledge again by the currents or winds, or any other accident.
But now I come to a new scene of my life. It happened one day,
about noon, going towards my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with
the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very plain
to be seen on the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I
had seen an apparition. I listened, I looked round me, but I could
hear nothing, nor see anything; I went up to a rising ground to
look farther; I went up the shore and down the shore, but it was
all one; I could see no other impression but that one. I went to it
again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might not
be my fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was exactly
the print of a foot&mdash;toes, heel, and every part of a foot. How
it came thither I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine; but
after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly
confused and out of myself, I came home to my fortification, not
feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the last
degree, looking behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking
every bush and tree, and fancying every stump at a distance to be a
man. Nor is it possible to describe how many various shapes my
affrighted imagination represented things to me in, how many wild
ideas were found every moment in my fancy, and what strange,
unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts by the way.</p>

<p>When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after
this), I fled into it like one pursued. Whether I went over by the
ladder, as first contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock,
which I had called a door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I
remember the next morning, for never frightened hare fled to cover,
or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to this
retreat.</p>

<p>I slept none that night; the farther I was from the occasion of
my fright, the greater my apprehensions were, which is something
contrary to the nature of such things, and especially to the usual
practice of all creatures in fear; but I was so embarrassed with my
own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal
imaginations to myself, even though I was now a great way off.
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil, and reason joined in with
me in this supposition, for how should any other thing in human
shape come into the place? Where was the vessel that brought them?
What marks were there of any other footstep? And how was it
possible a man should come there? But then, to think that Satan
should take human shape upon him in such a place, where there could
be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his foot
behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for he could not be
sure I should see it&mdash;this was an amusement the other way. I
considered that the devil might have found out abundance of other
ways to have terrified me than this of the single print of a foot;
that as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he would
never have been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it
was ten thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in
the sand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind,
would have defaced entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the
thing itself and with all the notions we usually entertain of the
subtlety of the devil.</p>

<p>Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of
all apprehensions of its being the devil; and I presently concluded
then that it must be some more dangerous creature&mdash;viz. that
it must be some of the savages of the mainland opposite who had
wandered out to sea in their canoes, and either driven by the
currents or by contrary winds, had made the island, and had been on
shore, but were gone away again to sea; being as loath, perhaps, to
have stayed in this desolate island as I would have been to have
had them.</p>

<p>While these reflections were rolling in my mind, I was very
thankful in my thoughts that I was so happy as not to be
thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by
which they would have concluded that some inhabitants had been in
the place, and perhaps have searched farther for me. Then terrible
thoughts racked my imagination about their having found out my
boat, and that there were people here; and that, if so, I should
certainly have them come again in greater numbers and devour me;
that if it should happen that they should not find me, yet they
would find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, and carry away all my
flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.</p>

<p>Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former
confidence in God, which was founded upon such wonderful experience
as I had had of His goodness; as if He that had fed me by miracle
hitherto could not preserve, by His power, the provision which He
had made for me by His goodness. I reproached myself with my
laziness, that would not sow any more corn one year than would just
serve me till the next season, as if no accident could intervene to
prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground; and this I
thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the future to have
two or three years' corn beforehand; so that, whatever might come,
I might not perish for want of bread.</p>

<p>How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the life of man! and
by what secret different springs are the affections hurried about,
as different circumstances present! To-day we love what to-morrow
we hate; to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire
what to-morrow we fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of.
This was exemplified in me, at this time, in the most lively manner
imaginable; for I, whose only affliction was that I seemed banished
from human society, that I was alone, circumscribed by the
boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and condemned to what I call
silent life; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be
numbered among the living, or to appear among the rest of His
creatures; that to have seen one of my own species would have
seemed to me a raising me from death to life, and the greatest
blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of
salvation, could bestow; I say, that I should now tremble at the
very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the
ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set
his foot in the island.</p>

<p>Such is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me a
great many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a little
recovered my first surprise. I considered that this was the station
of life the infinitely wise and good providence of God had
determined for me; that as I could not foresee what the ends of
Divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to dispute His
sovereignty; who, as I was His creature, had an undoubted right, by
creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as He thought fit;
and who, as I was a creature that had offended Him, had likewise a
judicial right to condemn me to what punishment He thought fit; and
that it was my part to submit to bear His indignation, because I
had sinned against Him. I then reflected, that as God, who was not
only righteous but omnipotent, had thought fit thus to punish and
afflict me, so He was able to deliver me: that if He did not think
fit to do so, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself
absolutely and entirely to His will; and, on the other hand, it was
my duty also to hope in Him, pray to Him, and quietly to attend to
the dictates and directions of His daily providence.</p>

<p>These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say weeks
and months: and one particular effect of my cogitations on this
occasion I cannot omit. One morning early, lying in my bed, and
filled with thoughts about my danger from the appearances of
savages, I found it discomposed me very much; upon which these
words of the Scripture came into my thoughts, "Call upon Me in the
day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify
Me." Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not
only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly
to God for deliverance: when I had done praying I took up my Bible,
and opening it to read, the first words that presented to me were,
"Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and He shall strengthen
thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible to express
the comfort this gave me. In answer, I thankfully laid down the
book, and was no more sad, at least on that occasion.</p>

<p>In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and
reflections, it came into my thoughts one day that all this might
be a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might be the print
of my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat: this cheered me
up a little, too, and I began to persuade myself it was all a
delusion; that it was nothing else but my own foot; and why might I
not come that way from the boat, as well as I was going that way to
the boat? Again, I considered also that I could by no means tell
for certain where I had trod, and where I had not; and that if, at
last, this was only the print of my own foot, I had played the part
of those fools who try to make stories of spectres and apparitions,
and then are frightened at them more than anybody.</p>

<p>Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had
not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I
began to starve for provisions; for I had little or nothing within
doors but some barley-cakes and water; then I knew that my goats
wanted to be milked too, which usually was my evening diversion:
and the poor creatures were in great pain and inconvenience for
want of it; and, indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost
dried up their milk. Encouraging myself, therefore, with the belief
that this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet, and that
I might be truly said to start at my own shadow, I began to go
abroad again, and went to my country house to milk my flock: but to
see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind me,
how I was ready every now and then to lay down my basket and run
for my life, it would have made any one have thought I was haunted
with an evil conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly
frightened; and so, indeed, I had. However, I went down thus two or
three days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder,
and to think there was really nothing in it but my own imagination;
but I could not persuade myself fully of this till I should go down
to the shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by
my own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I
might be assured it was my own foot: but when I came to the place,
first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my boat I
could not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabouts; secondly, when
I came to measure the mark with my own foot, I found my foot not so
large by a great deal. Both these things filled my head with new
imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to the highest degree,
so that I shook with cold like one in an ague; and I went home
again, filled with the belief that some man or men had been on
shore there; or, in short, that the island was inhabited, and I
might be surprised before I was aware; and what course to take for
my security I knew not.</p>

<p>Oh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with
fear! It deprives them of the use of those means which reason
offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to myself was,
to throw down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into
the woods, lest the enemy should find them, and then frequent the
island in prospect of the same or the like booty: then the simple
thing of digging up my two corn-fields, lest they should find such
a grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the island: then
to demolish my bower and tent, that they might not see any vestiges
of habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in order to find
out the persons inhabiting.</p>

<p>These were the subject of the first night's cogitations after I
was come home again, while the apprehensions which had so overrun
my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours. Thus,
fear of danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger
itself, when apparent to the eyes; and we find the burden of
anxiety greater, by much, than the evil which we are anxious about:
and what was worse than all this, I had not that relief in this
trouble that from the resignation I used to practise I hoped to
have. I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complained not only that
the Philistines were upon him, but that God had forsaken him; for I
did not now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in
my distress, and resting upon His providence, as I had done before,
for my defence and deliverance; which, if I had done, I had at
least been more cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and
perhaps carried through it with more resolution.</p>

<p>This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in
the morning I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind,
been as it were tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very
soundly, and waked much better composed than I had ever been
before. And now I began to think sedately; and, upon debate with
myself, I concluded that this island (which was so exceedingly
pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the mainland than as I had
seen) was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine; that
although there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot,
yet that there might sometimes come boats off from the shore, who,
either with design, or perhaps never but when they were driven by
cross winds, might come to this place; that I had lived there
fifteen years now and had not met with the least shadow or figure
of any people yet; and that, if at any time they should be driven
here, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever they
could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix here upon any
occasion; that the most I could suggest any danger from was from
any casual accidental landing of straggling people from the main,
who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were here
against their wills, so they made no stay here, but went off again
with all possible speed; seldom staying one night on shore, lest
they should not have the help of the tides and daylight back again;
and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to consider of some
safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon the
spot.</p>

<p>Now, I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as
to bring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out
beyond where my fortification joined to the rock: upon maturely
considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second
fortification, in the manner of a semicircle, at a distance from my
wall, just where I had planted a double row of trees about twelve
years before, of which I made mention: these trees having been
planted so thick before, they wanted but few piles to be driven
between them, that they might be thicker and stronger, and my wall
would be soon finished. So that I had now a double wall; and my
outer wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and
everything I could think of, to make it strong; having in it seven
little holes, about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the
inside of this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick with
continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the
foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven holes
I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I had
got seven on shore out of the ship; these I planted like my cannon,
and fitted them into frames, that held them like a carriage, so
that I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes' time; this
wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought
myself safe till it was done.</p>

<p>When this was done I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a
great length every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the
osier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could well
stand; insomuch that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand
of them, leaving a pretty large space between them and my wall,
that I might have room to see an enemy, and they might have no
shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to approach my
outer wall.</p>

<p>Thus in two years' time I had a thick grove; and in five or six
years' time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrously
thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no
men, of what kind soever, could ever imagine that there was
anything beyond it, much less a habitation. As for the way which I
proposed to myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue), it was
by setting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which was low,
and then broke in, and left room to place another ladder upon that;
so when the two ladders were taken down no man living could come
down to me without doing himself mischief; and if they had come
down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.</p>

<p>Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my
own preservation; and it will be seen at length that they were not
altogether without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at that
time more than my mere fear suggested to me.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII&mdash;A CAVE RETREAT</h3>

<p>While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other
affairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of
goats: they were not only a ready supply to me on every occasion,
and began to be sufficient for me, without the expense of powder
and shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting after the wild
ones; and I was loath to lose the advantage of them, and to have
them all to nurse up over again.</p>

<p>For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but
two ways to preserve them: one was, to find another convenient
place to dig a cave underground, and to drive them into it every
night; and the other was to enclose two or three little bits of
land, remote from one another, and as much concealed as I could,
where I might keep about half-a-dozen young goats in each place; so
that if any disaster happened to the flock in general, I might be
able to raise them again with little trouble and time: and this
though it would require a good deal of time and labour, I thought
was the most rational design.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired
parts of the island; and I pitched upon one, which was as private,
indeed, as my heart could wish: it was a little damp piece of
ground in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is
observed, I almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to come
back that way from the eastern part of the island. Here I found a
clear piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded with woods
that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at least, it did not
want near so much labour to make it so as the other piece of ground
I had worked so hard at.</p>

<p>I immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and in
less than a month's time I had so fenced it round that my flock, or
herd, call it which you please, which were not so wild now as at
first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secured in it:
so, without any further delay, I removed ten young she-goats and
two he-goats to this piece, and when they were there I continued to
perfect the fence till I had made it as secure as the other; which,
however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time by a
great deal. All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my
apprehensions on account of the print of a man's foot; for as yet I
had never seen any human creature come near the island; and I had
now lived two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed, made my
life much less comfortable than it was before, as may be well
imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare
of the fear of man. And this I must observe, with grief, too, that
the discomposure of my mind had great impression also upon the
religious part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling
into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits,
that I seldom found myself in a due temper for application to my
Maker; at least, not with the sedate calmness and resignation of
soul which I was wont to do: I rather prayed to God as under great
affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in
expectation every night of being murdered and devoured before
morning; and I must testify, from my experience, that a temper of
peace, thankfulness, love, and affection, is much the more proper
frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure: and that
under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a
comforting performance of the duty of praying to God than he is for
a repentance on a sick-bed; for these discomposures affect the
mind, as the others do the body; and the discomposure of the mind
must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and
much greater; praying to God being properly an act of the mind, not
of the body.</p>

<p>But to go on. After I had thus secured one part of my little
living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another
private place to make such another deposit; when, wandering more to
the west point of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking
out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great
distance. I had found a perspective glass or two in one of the
seamen's chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I had it not
about me; and this was so remote that I could not tell what to make
of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to hold to
look any longer; whether it was a boat or not I do not know, but as
I descended from the hill I could see no more of it, so I gave it
over; only I resolved to go no more out without a perspective glass
in my pocket. When I was come down the hill to the end of the
island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was presently
convinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a
strange thing in the island as I imagined: and but that it was a
special providence that I was cast upon the side of the island
where the savages never came, I should easily have known that
nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the main, when
they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to
that side of the island for harbour: likewise, as they often met
and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any
prisoners, would bring them over to this shore, where, according to
their dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and
eat them; of which hereafter.</p>

<p>When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above,
being the SW. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and
amazed; nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my mind
at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other
bones of human bodies; and particularly I observed a place where
there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a
cockpit, where I supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their
human feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I
entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long
while: all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a
pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of the
degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard of it often,
yet I never had so near a view of before; in short, I turned away
my face from the horrid spectacle; my stomach grew sick, and I was
just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder
from my stomach; and having vomited with uncommon violence, I was a
little relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a moment;
so I got up the hill again with all the speed I could, and walked
on towards my own habitation.</p>

<p>When I came a little out of that part of the island I stood
still awhile, as amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up
with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in
my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of
the world where I was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as
these; and that, though I had esteemed my present condition very
miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it that I had still
more to give thanks for than to complain of: and this, above all,
that I had, even in this miserable condition, been comforted with
the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of His blessing: which was a
felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which
I had suffered, or could suffer.</p>

<p>In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and
began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances,
than ever I was before: for I observed that these wretches never
came to this island in search of what they could get; perhaps not
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting anything here; and having
often, no doubt, been up the covered, woody part of it without
finding anything to their purpose. I knew I had been here now
almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of human
creature there before; and I might be eighteen years more as
entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself to
them, which I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my only
business to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I
found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself
known to. Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched, inhuman
custom of their devouring and eating one another up, that I
continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle for
almost two years after this: when I say my own circle, I mean by it
my three plantations&mdash;viz. my castle, my country seat (which I
called my bower), and my enclosure in the woods: nor did I look
after this for any other use than an enclosure for my goats; for
the aversion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was
such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil
himself. I did not so much as go to look after my boat all this
time, but began rather to think of making another; for I could not
think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat
round the island to me, lest I should meet with some of these
creatures at sea; in which case, if I had happened to have fallen
into their hands, I knew what would have been my lot.</p>

<p>Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no
danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off my
uneasiness about them; and I began to live just in the same
composed manner as before, only with this difference, that I used
more caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did before,
lest I should happen to be seen by any of them; and particularly, I
was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them, being on the
island, should happen to hear it. It was, therefore, a very good
providence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed of
goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about the woods, or
shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it was by
traps and snares, as I had done before; so that for two years after
this I believe I never fired my gun once off, though I never went
out without it; and what was more, as I had saved three pistols out
of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least two of
them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. I also furbished up one
of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a
belt to hang it on also; so that I was now a most formidable fellow
to look at when I went abroad, if you add to the former description
of myself the particular of two pistols, and a broadsword hanging
at my side in a belt, but without a scabbard.</p>

<p>Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed,
excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate
way of living. All these things tended to show me more and more how
far my condition was from being miserable, compared to some others;
nay, to many other particulars of life which it might have pleased
God to have made my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little
repining there would be among mankind at any condition of life if
people would rather compare their condition with those that were
worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing them with
those which are better, to assist their murmurings and
complainings.</p>

<p>As in my present condition there were not really many things
which I wanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I had been in
about these savage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my
own preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention, for my
own conveniences; and I had dropped a good design, which I had once
bent my thoughts upon, and that was to try if I could not make some
of my barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer. This
was really a whimsical thought, and I reproved myself often for the
simplicity of it: for I presently saw there would be the want of
several things necessary to the making my beer that it would be
impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to preserve it in,
which was a thing that, as I have observed already, I could never
compass: no, though I spent not only many days, but weeks, nay
months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place, I
had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or
kettle to make it boil; and yet with all these things wanting, I
verily believe, had not the frights and terrors I was in about the
savages intervened, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to
pass too; for I seldom gave anything over without accomplishing it,
when once I had it in my head to began it. But my invention now ran
quite another way; for night and day I could think of nothing but
how I might destroy some of the monsters in their cruel, bloody
entertainment, and if possible save the victim they should bring
hither to destroy. It would take up a larger volume than this whole
work is intended to be to set down all the contrivances I hatched,
or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these
creatures, or at least frightening them so as to prevent their
coming hither any more: but all this was abortive; nothing could be
possible to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself:
and what could one man do among them, when perhaps there might be
twenty or thirty of them together with their darts, or their bows
and arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I
could with my gun?</p>

<p>Sometimes I thought if digging a hole under the place where they
made their fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder,
which, when they kindled their fire, would consequently take fire,
and blow up all that was near it: but as, in the first place, I
should be unwilling to waste so much powder upon them, my store
being now within the quantity of one barrel, so neither could I be
sure of its going off at any certain time, when it might surprise
them; and, at best, that it would do little more than just blow the
fire about their ears and fright them, but not sufficient to make
them forsake the place: so I laid it aside; and then proposed that
I would place myself in ambush in some convenient place, with my
three guns all double-loaded, and in the middle of their bloody
ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound
perhaps two or three at every shot; and then falling in upon them
with my three pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but that, if
there were twenty, I should kill them all. This fancy pleased my
thoughts for some weeks, and I was so full of it that I often
dreamed of it, and, sometimes, that I was just going to let fly at
them in my sleep. I went so far with it in my imagination that I
employed myself several days to find out proper places to put
myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them, and I went
frequently to the place itself, which was now grown more familiar
to me; but while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge
and a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I
may call it, the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of
the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abetted my malice.
Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill where I was
satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of their boats
coming; and might then, even before they would be ready to come on
shore, convey myself unseen into some thickets of trees, in one of
which there was a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely; and
there I might sit and observe all their bloody doings, and take my
full aim at their heads, when they were so close together as that
it would be next to impossible that I should miss my shot, or that
I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot. In
this place, then, I resolved to fulfil my design; and accordingly I
prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets
I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller
bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the fowling-piece I
loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of the largest size; I also
loaded my pistols with about four bullets each; and, in this
posture, well provided with ammunition for a second and third
charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.</p>

<p>After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my
imagination put it in practice, I continually made my tour every
morning to the top of the hill, which was from my castle, as I
called it, about three miles or more, to see if I could observe any
boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or standing over
towards it; but I began to tire of this hard duty, after I had for
two or three months constantly kept my watch, but came always back
without any discovery; there having not, in all that time, been the
least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but on the whole
ocean, so far as my eye or glass could reach every way.</p>

<p>As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill, to look out, so
long also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits seemed
to be all the while in a suitable frame for so outrageous an
execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for an
offence which I had not at all entered into any discussion of in my
thoughts, any farther than my passions were at first fired by the
horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of the people of that
country, who, it seems, had been suffered by Providence, in His
wise disposition of the world, to have no other guide than that of
their own abominable and vitiated passions; and consequently were
left, and perhaps had been so for some ages, to act such horrid
things, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but nature,
entirely abandoned by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish
degeneracy, could have run them into. But now, when, as I have
said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had
made so long and so far every morning in vain, so my opinion of the
action itself began to alter; and I began, with cooler and calmer
thoughts, to consider what I was going to engage in; what authority
or call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner upon these men
as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit for so many ages to
suffer unpunished to go on, and to be as it were the executioners
of His judgments one upon another; how far these people were
offenders against me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel
of that blood which they shed promiscuously upon one another. I
debated this very often with myself thus: "How do I know what God
Himself judges in this particular case? It is certain these people
do not commit this as a crime; it is not against their own
consciences reproving, or their light reproaching them; they do not
know it to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of divine
justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit. They think it
no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war than we do to kill
an ox; or to eat human flesh than we do to eat mutton."</p>

<p>When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I
was certainly in the wrong; that these people were not murderers,
in the sense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any
more than those Christians were murderers who often put to death
the prisoners taken in battle; or more frequently, upon many
occasions, put whole troops of men to the sword, without giving
quarter, though they threw down their arms and submitted. In the
next place, it occurred to me that although the usage they gave one
another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to
me: these people had done me no injury: that if they attempted, or
I saw it necessary, for my immediate preservation, to fall upon
them, something might be said for it: but that I was yet out of
their power, and they really had no knowledge of me, and
consequently no design upon me; and therefore it could not be just
for me to fall upon them; that this would justify the conduct of
the Spaniards in all their barbarities practised in America, where
they destroyed millions of these people; who, however they were
idolators and barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous
rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to their
idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent people; and
that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of with the
utmost abhorrence and detestation by even the Spaniards themselves
at this time, and by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a
mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty,
unjustifiable either to God or man; and for which the very name of
a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible, to all people
of humanity or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of Spain
were particularly eminent for the produce of a race of men who were
without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to
the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of generous temper in
the mind.</p>

<p>These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of
a full stop; and I began by little and little to be off my design,
and to conclude I had taken wrong measures in my resolution to
attack the savages; and that it was not my business to meddle with
them, unless they first attacked me; and this it was my business,
if possible, to prevent: but that, if I were discovered and
attacked by them, I knew my duty. On the other hand, I argued with
myself that this really was the way not to deliver myself, but
entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to kill
every one that not only should be on shore at that time, but that
should ever come on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to
tell their country-people what had happened, they would come over
again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and I
should only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which, at
present, I had no manner of occasion for. Upon the whole, I
concluded that I ought, neither in principle nor in policy, one way
or other, to concern myself in this affair: that my business was,
by all possible means to conceal myself from them, and not to leave
the least sign for them to guess by that there were any living
creatures upon the island&mdash;I mean of human shape. Religion
joined in with this prudential resolution; and I was convinced now,
many ways, that I was perfectly out of my duty when I was laying
all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent
creatures&mdash;I mean innocent as to me. As to the crimes they
were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do with them;
they were national, and I ought to leave them to the justice of
God, who is the Governor of nations, and knows how, by national
punishments, to make a just retribution for national offences, and
to bring public judgments upon those who offend in a public manner,
by such ways as best please Him. This appeared so clear to me now,
that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had not
been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much reason to
believe would have been no less a sin than that of wilful murder if
I had committed it; and I gave most humble thanks on my knees to
God, that He had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness;
beseeching Him to grant me the protection of His providence, that I
might not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or that I might
not lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more clear call from
Heaven to do it, in defence of my own life.</p>

<p>In this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and
so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill to
see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know whether any
of them had been on shore there or not, that I might not be tempted
to renew any of my contrivances against them, or be provoked by any
advantage that might present itself to fall upon them; only this I
did: I went and removed my boat, which I had on the other side of
the island, and carried it down to the east end of the whole
island, where I ran it into a little cove, which I found under some
high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the currents, the
savages durst not, at least would not, come with their boats upon
any account whatever. With my boat I carried away everything that I
had left there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare
going thither&mdash;viz. a mast and sail which I had made for her,
and a thing like an anchor, but which, indeed, could not be called
either anchor or grapnel; however, it was the best I could make of
its kind: all these I removed, that there might not be the least
shadow for discovery, or appearance of any boat, or of any human
habitation upon the island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I said,
more retired than ever, and seldom went from my cell except upon my
constant employment, to milk my she-goats, and manage my little
flock in the wood, which, as it was quite on the other part of the
island, was out of danger; for certain, it is that these savage
people, who sometimes haunted this island, never came with any
thoughts of finding anything here, and consequently never wandered
off from the coast, and I doubt not but they might have been
several times on shore after my apprehensions of them had made me
cautious, as well as before. Indeed, I looked back with some horror
upon the thoughts of what my condition would have been if I had
chopped upon them and been discovered before that; when, naked and
unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often only with small
shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the island, to
see what I could get; what a surprise should I have been in if,
when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had, instead of
that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me,
and by the swiftness of their running no possibility of my escaping
them! The thoughts of this sometimes sank my very soul within me,
and distressed my mind so much that I could not soon recover it, to
think what I should have done, and how I should not only have been
unable to resist them, but even should not have had presence of
mind enough to do what I might have done; much less what now, after
so much consideration and preparation, I might be able to do.
Indeed, after serious thinking of these things, I would be
melancholy, and sometimes it would last a great while; but I
resolved it all at last into thankfulness to that Providence which
had delivered me from so many unseen dangers, and had kept me from
those mischiefs which I could have no way been the agent in
delivering myself from, because I had not the least notion of any
such thing depending, or the least supposition of its being
possible. This renewed a contemplation which often had come into my
thoughts in former times, when first I began to see the merciful
dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we run through in this life;
how wonderfully we are delivered when we know nothing of it; how,
when we are in a quandary as we call it, a doubt or hesitation
whether to go this way or that way, a secret hint shall direct us
this way, when we intended to go that way: nay, when sense, our own
inclination, and perhaps business has called us to go the other
way, yet a strange impression upon the mind, from we know not what
springs, and by we know not what power, shall overrule us to go
this way; and it shall afterwards appear that had we gone that way,
which we should have gone, and even to our imagination ought to
have gone, we should have been ruined and lost. Upon these and many
like reflections I afterwards made it a certain rule with me, that
whenever I found those secret hints or pressings of mind to doing
or not doing anything that presented, or going this way or that
way, I never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I knew no
other reason for it than such a pressure or such a hint hung upon
my mind. I could give many examples of the success of this conduct
in the course of my life, but more especially in the latter part of
my inhabiting this unhappy island; besides many occasions which it
is very likely I might have taken notice of, if I had seen with the
same eyes then that I see with now. But it is never too late to be
wise; and I cannot but advise all considering men, whose lives are
attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or even though
not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret intimations of
Providence, let them come from what invisible intelligence they
will. That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but
certainly they are a proof of the converse of spirits, and a secret
communication between those embodied and those unembodied, and such
a proof as can never be withstood; of which I shall have occasion
to give some remarkable instances in the remainder of my solitary
residence in this dismal place.</p>

<p>I believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I
confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in,
and the concern that was now upon me, put an end to all invention,
and to all the contrivances that I had laid for my future
accommodations and conveniences. I had the care of my safety more
now upon my hands than that of my food. I cared not to drive a
nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I might make
should be heard: much less would I fire a gun for the same reason:
and above all I was intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the
smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day, should
betray me. For this reason, I removed that part of my business
which required fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &amp; c.,
into my new apartment in the woods; where, after I had been some
time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave
in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I daresay, no
savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to
venture in; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who, like me,
wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.</p>

<p>The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock,
where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant
reason to ascribe all such things now to Providence), I was cutting
down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal; and before I go
on I must observe the reason of my making this charcoal, which was
this&mdash;I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I
said before; and yet I could not live there without baking my
bread, cooking my meat, &amp; c.; so I contrived to burn some wood
here, as I had seen done in England, under turf, till it became
chark or dry coal: and then putting the fire out, I preserved the
coal to carry home, and perform the other services for which fire
was wanting, without danger of smoke. But this is by-the-bye. While
I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived that, behind a very
thick branch of low brushwood or underwood, there was a kind of
hollow place: I was curious to look in it; and getting with
difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty large, that
is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps
another with me: but I must confess to you that I made more haste
out than I did in, when looking farther into the place, and which
was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature,
whether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars; the
dim light from the cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the
reflection. However, after some pause I recovered myself, and began
to call myself a thousand fools, and to think that he that was
afraid to see the devil was not fit to live twenty years in an
island all alone; and that I might well think there was nothing in
this cave that was more frightful than myself. Upon this, plucking
up my courage, I took up a firebrand, and in I rushed again, with
the stick flaming in my hand: I had not gone three steps in before
I was almost as frightened as before; for I heard a very loud sigh,
like that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken
noise, as of words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I
stepped back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise that it
put me into a cold sweat, and if I had had a hat on my head, I will
not answer for it that my hair might not have lifted it off. But
still plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging
myself a little with considering that the power and presence of God
was everywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped forward
again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little
over my head, I saw lying on the ground a monstrous, frightful old
he-goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for life,
and, dying, indeed, of mere old age. I stirred him a little to see
if I could get him out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able
to raise himself; and I thought with myself he might even lie
there&mdash;for if he had frightened me, so he would certainly
fright any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy as to
come in there while he had any life in him.</p>

<p>I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round
me, when I found the cave was but very small&mdash;that is to say,
it might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape,
neither round nor square, no hands having ever been employed in
making it but those of mere Nature. I observed also that there was
a place at the farther side of it that went in further, but was so
low that it required me to creep upon my hands and knees to go into
it, and whither it went I knew not; so, having no candle, I gave it
over for that time, but resolved to go again the next day provided
with candles and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock of one
of the muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles
of my own making (for I made very good candles now of goat's
tallow, but was hard set for candle-wick, using sometimes rags or
rope-yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles);
and going into this low place I was obliged to creep upon all-fours
as I have said, almost ten yards&mdash;which, by the way, I thought
was a venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far it
might go, nor what was beyond it. When I had got through the
strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty
feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I
daresay, as it was to look round the sides and roof of this vault
or cave&mdash;the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me
from my two candles. What it was in the rock&mdash;whether diamonds
or any other precious stones, or gold which I rather supposed it to
be&mdash;I knew not. The place I was in was a most delightful
cavity, or grotto, though perfectly dark; the floor was dry and
level, and had a sort of a small loose gravel upon it, so that
there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, neither was
there any damp or wet on the sides or roof. The only difficulty in
it was the entrance&mdash;which, however, as it was a place of
security, and such a retreat as I wanted; I thought was a
convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and
resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things which I
was most anxious about to this place: particularly, I resolved to
bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare
arms&mdash;viz. two fowling-pieces&mdash;for I had three in
all&mdash;and three muskets&mdash;for of them I had eight in all;
so I kept in my castle only five, which stood ready mounted like
pieces of cannon on my outmost fence, and were ready also to take
out upon any expedition. Upon this occasion of removing my
ammunition I happened to open the barrel of powder which I took up
out of the sea, and which had been wet, and I found that the water
had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every
side, which caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside like
a kernel in the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of very good
powder in the centre of the cask. This was a very agreeable
discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither, never
keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle,
for fear of a surprise of any kind; I also carried thither all the
lead I had left for bullets.</p>

<p>I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were
said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come
at them; for I persuaded myself, while I was here, that if five
hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never find me
out&mdash;or if they did, they would not venture to attack me here.
The old goat whom I found expiring died in the mouth of the cave
the next day after I made this discovery; and I found it much
easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and cover him
with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him there, to
prevent offence to my nose.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;WRECK OF A SPANISH SHIP</h3>

<p>I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this
island, and was so naturalised to the place and the manner of
living, that, could I but have enjoyed the certainty that no
savages would come to the place to disturb me, I could have been
content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my time there,
even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and died, like the
old goat in the cave. I had also arrived to some little diversions
and amusements, which made the time pass a great deal more
pleasantly with me than it did before&mdash;first, I had taught my
Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and
talked so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me;
and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years. How long he
might have lived afterwards I know not, though I know they have a
notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. My dog was a
pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years
of my time, and then died of mere old age. As for my cats, they
multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree that I was obliged
to shoot several of them at first, to keep them from devouring me
and all I had; but at length, when the two old ones I brought with
me were gone, and after some time continually driving them from me,
and letting them have no provision with me, they all ran wild into
the woods, except two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and
whose young, when they had any, I always drowned; and these were
part of my family. Besides these I always kept two or three
household kids about me, whom I taught to feed out of my hand; and
I had two more parrots, which talked pretty well, and would all
call "Robin Crusoe," but none like my first; nor, indeed, did I
take the pains with any of them that I had done with him. I had
also several tame sea-fowls, whose name I knew not, that I caught
upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the little stakes which I
had planted before my castle-wall being now grown up to a good
thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred
there, which was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I
began to be very well contented with the life I led, if I could
have been secured from the dread of the savages. But it was
otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all people who
shall meet with my story to make this just observation from it: How
frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil which in itself we
seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into, is the most
dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our
deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again from the
affliction we are fallen into. I could give many examples of this
in the course of my unaccountable life; but in nothing was it more
particularly remarkable than in the circumstances of my last years
of solitary residence in this island.</p>

<p>It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my
twenty-third year; and this, being the southern solstice (for
winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harvest,
and required me to be pretty much abroad in the fields, when, going
out early in the morning, even before it was thorough daylight, I
was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a
distance from me of about two miles, toward that part of the island
where I had observed some savages had been, as before, and not on
the other side; but, to my great affliction, it was on my side of
the island.</p>

<p>I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short
within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised;
and yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had
that if these savages, in rambling over the island, should find my
corn standing or cut, or any of my works or improvements, they
would immediately conclude that there were people in the place, and
would then never rest till they had found me out. In this extremity
I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me,
and made all things without look as wild and natural as I
could.</p>

<p>Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of
defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I called them&mdash;that is to
say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new
fortification&mdash;and all my pistols, and resolved to defend
myself to the last gasp&mdash;not forgetting seriously to commend
myself to the Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to
deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. I continued in this
posture about two hours, and began to be impatient for intelligence
abroad, for I had no spies to send out. After sitting a while
longer, and musing what I should do in this case, I was not able to
bear sitting in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the
side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I observed
before, and then pulling the ladder after me, I set it up again and
mounted the top of the hill, and pulling out my perspective glass,
which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on
the ground, and began to look for the place. I presently found
there were no less than nine naked savages sitting round a small
fire they had made, not to warm them, for they had no need of that,
the weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some
of their barbarous diet of human flesh which they had brought with
them, whether alive or dead I could not tell.</p>

<p>They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the
shore; and as it was then ebb of tide, they seemed to me to wait
for the return of the flood to go away again. It is not easy to
imagine what confusion this sight put me into, especially seeing
them come on my side of the island, and so near to me; but when I
considered their coming must be always with the current of the ebb,
I began afterwards to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied
that I might go abroad with safety all the time of the flood of
tide, if they were not on shore before; and having made this
observation, I went abroad about my harvest work with the more
composure.</p>

<p>As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to the
westward I saw them all take boat and row (or paddle as we call it)
away. I should have observed, that for an hour or more before they
went off they were dancing, and I could easily discern their
postures and gestures by my glass. I could not perceive, by my
nicest observation, but that they were stark naked, and had not the
least covering upon them; but whether they were men or women I
could not distinguish.</p>

<p>As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my
shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by my
side without a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make
went away to the hill where I had discovered the first appearance
of all; and as soon as I get thither, which was not in less than
two hours (for I could not go quickly, being so loaded with arms as
I was), I perceived there had been three canoes more of the savages
at that place; and looking out farther, I saw they were all at sea
together, making over for the main. This was a dreadful sight to
me, especially as, going down to the shore, I could see the marks
of horror which the dismal work they had been about had left behind
it&mdash;viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of human
bodies eaten and devoured by those wretches with merriment and
sport. I was so filled with indignation at the sight, that I now
began to premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw there,
let them be whom or how many soever. It seemed evident to me that
the visits which they made thus to this island were not very
frequent, for it was above fifteen months before any more of them
came on shore there again&mdash;that is to say, I neither saw them
nor any footsteps or signals of them in all that time; for as to
the rainy seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at least
not so far. Yet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of
the constant apprehensions of their coming upon me by surprise:
from whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is more bitter
than the suffering, especially if there is no room to shake off
that expectation or those apprehensions.</p>

<p>During all this time I was in a murdering humour, and spent most
of my hours, which should have been better employed, in contriving
how to circumvent and fall upon them the very next time I should
see them&mdash;especially if they should be divided, as they were
the last time, into two parties; nor did I consider at all that if
I killed one party&mdash;suppose ten or a dozen&mdash;I was still
the next day, or week, or month, to kill another, and so another,
even <i>ad infinitum</i>, till I should be, at length, no less a
murderer than they were in being man-eaters&mdash;and perhaps much
more so. I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of
mind, expecting that I should one day or other fall, into the hands
of these merciless creatures; and if I did at any time venture
abroad, it was not without looking around me with the greatest care
and caution imaginable. And now I found, to my great comfort, how
happy it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of goats, for
I durst not upon any account fire my gun, especially near that side
of the island where they usually came, lest I should alarm the
savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them
come again with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a
few days, and then I knew what to expect. However, I wore out a
year and three months more before I ever saw any more of the
savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It
is true they might have been there once or twice; but either they
made no stay, or at least I did not see them; but in the month of
May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth
year, I had a very strange encounter with them; of which in its
place.</p>

<p>The perturbation of my mind during this fifteen or sixteen
months' interval was very great; I slept unquietly, dreamed always
frightful dreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night.
In the day great troubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the night I
dreamed often of killing the savages and of the reasons why I might
justify doing it.</p>

<p>But to waive all this for a while. It was in the middle of May,
on the sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar
would reckon, for I marked all upon the post still; I say, it was
on the sixteenth of May that it blew a very great storm of wind all
day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder, and; a very foul
night it was after it. I knew not what was the particular occasion
of it, but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up with very
serious thoughts about my present condition, I was surprised with
the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea. This was, to be
sure, a surprise quite of a different nature from any I had met
with before; for the notions this put into my thoughts were quite
of another kind. I started up in the greatest haste imaginable;
and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock,
and pulled it after me; and mounting it the second time, got to the
top of the hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen
for a second gun, which, accordingly, in about half a minute I
heard; and by the sound, knew that it was from that part of the sea
where I was driven down the current in my boat. I immediately
considered that this must be some ship in distress, and that they
had some comrade, or some other ship in company, and fired these
for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had the presence of
mind at that minute to think, that though I could not help them, it
might be that they might help me; so I brought together all the dry
wood I could get at hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it
on fire upon the hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and,
though the wind blew very hard, yet it burned fairly out; so that I
was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must needs
see it. And no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed
up, I heard another gun, and after that several others, all from
the same quarter. I plied my fire all night long, till daybreak:
and when it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw something
at a great distance at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail
or a hull I could not distinguish&mdash;no, not with my glass: the
distance was so great, and the weather still something hazy also;
at least, it was so out at sea.</p>

<p>I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that
it did not move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at
anchor; and being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took
my gun in my hand, and ran towards the south side of the island to
the rocks where I had formerly been carried away by the current;
and getting up there, the weather by this time being perfectly
clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a
ship, cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks which I
found when I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as they checked
the violence of the stream, and made a kind of counter-stream, or
eddy, were the occasion of my recovering from the most desperate,
hopeless condition that ever I had been in in all my life. Thus,
what is one man's safety is another man's destruction; for it seems
these men, whoever they were, being out of their knowledge, and the
rocks being wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the
night, the wind blowing hard at ENE. Had they seen the island, as I
must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought,
have endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help of
their boat; but their firing off guns for help, especially when
they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts.
First, I imagined that upon seeing my light they might have put
themselves into their boat, and endeavoured to make the shore: but
that the sea running very high, they might have been cast away.
Other times I imagined that they might have lost their boat before,
as might be the case many ways; particularly by the breaking of the
sea upon their ship, which many times obliged men to stave, or take
in pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard with
their own hands. Other times I imagined they had some other ship or
ships in company, who, upon the signals of distress they made, had
taken them up, and carried them off. Other times I fancied they
were all gone off to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by
the current that I had been formerly in, were carried out into the
great ocean, where there was nothing but misery and perishing: and
that, perhaps, they might by this time think of starving, and of
being in a condition to eat one another.</p>

<p>As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition
I was in, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the
poor men, and pity them; which had still this good effect upon my
side, that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks to God,
who had so happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate
condition; and that of two ships' companies, who were now cast away
upon this part of the world, not one life should be spared but
mine. I learned here again to observe, that it is very rare that
the providence of God casts us into any condition so low, or any
misery so great, but we may see something or other to be thankful
for, and may see others in worse circumstances than our own. Such
certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could not so much as
see room to suppose any were saved; nothing could make it rational
so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish there,
except the possibility only of their being taken up by another ship
in company; and this was but mere possibility indeed, for I saw not
the least sign or appearance of any such thing. I cannot explain,
by any possible energy of words, what a strange longing I felt in
my soul upon this sight, breaking out sometimes thus: "Oh that
there had been but one or two, nay, or but one soul saved out of
this ship, to have escaped to me, that I might but have had one
companion, one fellow-creature, to have spoken to me and to have
conversed with!" In all the time of my solitary life I never felt
so earnest, so strong a desire after the society of my
fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the want of it.</p>

<p>There are some secret springs in the affections which, when they
are set a-going by some object in view, or, though not in view, yet
rendered present to the mind by the power of imagination, that
motion carries out the soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent,
eager embracings of the object, that the absence of it is
insupportable. Such were these earnest wishings that but one man
had been saved. I believe I repeated the words, "Oh that it had
been but one!" a thousand times; and my desires were so moved by
it, that when I spoke the words my hands would clinch together, and
my fingers would press the palms of my hands, so that if I had had
any soft thing in my hand I should have crushed it involuntarily;
and the teeth in my head would strike together, and set against one
another so strong, that for some time I could not part them again.
Let the naturalists explain these things, and the reason and manner
of them. All I can do is to describe the fact, which was even
surprising to me when I found it, though I knew not from whence it
proceeded; it was doubtless the effect of ardent wishes, and of
strong ideas formed in my mind, realising the comfort which the
conversation of one of my fellow-Christians would have been to me.
But it was not to be; either their fate or mine, or both, forbade
it; for, till the last year of my being on this island, I never
knew whether any were saved out of that ship or no; and had only
the affliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy
come on shore at the end of the island which was next the
shipwreck. He had no clothes on but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of
open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to
direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of. He had nothing
in his pockets but two pieces of eight and a tobacco pipe&mdash;the
last was to me of ten times more value than the first.</p>

<p>It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my
boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find something on
board that might be useful to me. But that did not altogether press
me so much as the possibility that there might be yet some living
creature on board, whose life I might not only save, but might, by
saving that life, comfort my own to the last degree; and this
thought clung so to my heart that I could not be quiet night or
day, but I must venture out in my boat on board this wreck; and
committing the rest to God's providence, I thought the impression
was so strong upon my mind that it could not be resisted&mdash;that
it must come from some invisible direction, and that I should be
wanting to myself if I did not go.</p>

<p>Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my
castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of
bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle
of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left), and a basket of
raisins; and thus, loading myself with everything necessary. I went
down to my boat, got the water out of her, got her afloat, loaded
all my cargo in her, and then went home again for more. My second
cargo was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head
for a shade, another large pot of water, and about two dozen of
small loaves, or barley cakes, more than before, with a bottle of
goat's milk and a cheese; all which with great labour and sweat I
carried to my boat; and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put
out, and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore, came at last
to the utmost point of the island on the north-east side. And now I
was to launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or not to
venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly on
both sides of the island at a distance, and which were very
terrible to me from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in
before, and my heart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was
driven into either of those currents, I should be carried a great
way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach or sight of the island
again; and that then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale
of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost.</p>

<p>These thoughts so oppressed my mind that I began to give over my
enterprise; and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the
shore, I stepped out, and sat down upon a rising bit of ground,
very pensive and anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage;
when, as I was musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned,
and the flood come on; upon which my going was impracticable for so
many hours. Upon this, presently it occurred to me that I should go
up to the highest piece of ground I could find, and observe, if I
could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay when the flood came
in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I
might not expect to be driven another way home, with the same
rapidity of the currents. This thought was no sooner in my head
than I cast my eye upon a little hill which sufficiently overlooked
the sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the
currents or sets of the tide, and which way I was to guide myself
in my return. Here I found, that as the current of ebb set out
close by the south point of the island, so the current of the flood
set in close by the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing
to do but to keep to the north side of the island in my return, and
I should do well enough.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this observation, I resolved the next morning to
set out with the first of the tide; and reposing myself for the
night in my canoe, under the watch-coat I mentioned, I launched
out. I first made a little out to sea, full north, till I began to
feel the benefit of the current, which set eastward, and which
carried me at a great rate; and yet did not so hurry me as the
current on the south side had done before, so as to take from me
all government of the boat; but having a strong steerage with my
paddle, I went at a great rate directly for the wreck, and in less
than two hours I came up to it. It was a dismal sight to look at;
the ship, which by its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in
between two rocks. All the stern and quarter of her were beaten to
pieces by the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks,
had run on with great violence, her mainmast and foremast were
brought by the board&mdash;that is to say, broken short off; but
her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm. When I
came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried; and as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea
to come to me. I took him into the boat, but found him almost dead
with hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he
devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight
in the snow; I then gave the poor creature some fresh water, with
which, if I would have let him, he would have burst himself. After
this I went on board; but the first sight I met with was two men
drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship, with their
arms fast about one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable,
that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so
high and so continually over her, that the men were not able to
bear it, and were strangled with the constant rushing in of the
water, as much as if they had been under water. Besides the dog,
there was nothing left in the ship that had life; nor any goods,
that I could see, but what were spoiled by the water. There were
some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay
lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could
see; but they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests,
which I believe belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of
them into the boat, without examining what was in them. Had the
stern of the ship been fixed, and the forepart broken off, I am
persuaded I might have made a good voyage; for by what I found in
those two chests I had room to suppose the ship had a great deal of
wealth on board; and, if I may guess from the course she steered,
she must have been bound from Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata,
in the south part of America, beyond the Brazils to the Havannah,
in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt,
a great treasure in her, but of no use, at that time, to anybody;
and what became of the crew I then knew not.</p>

<p>I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of
about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much
difficulty. There were several muskets in the cabin, and a great
powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it; as for the
muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took the
powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which I wanted
extremely, as also two little brass kettles, a copper pot to make
chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this cargo, and the dog, I came
away, the tide beginning to make home again&mdash;and the same
evening, about an hour within night, I reached the island again,
weary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that night in the
boat and in the morning I resolved to harbour what I had got in my
new cave, and not carry it home to my castle. After refreshing
myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and began to examine the
particulars. The cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but
not such as we had at the Brazils; and, in a word, not at all good;
but when I came to open the chests, I found several things of great
use to me&mdash;for example, I found in one a fine case of bottles,
of an extraordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine and
very good; the bottles held about three pints each, and were tipped
with silver. I found two pots of very good succades, or sweetmeats,
so fastened also on the top that the salt-water had not hurt them;
and two more of the same, which the water had spoiled. I found some
very good shirts, which were very welcome to me; and about a dozen
and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths;
the former were also very welcome, being exceedingly refreshing to
wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, when I came to the till in
the chest, I found there three great bags of pieces of eight, which
held about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in one of them,
wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars
or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh near a pound. In
the other chest were some clothes, but of little value; but, by the
circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner's mate; though
there was no powder in it, except two pounds of fine glazed powder,
in three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their fowling-pieces
on occasion. Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage that
was of any use to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner of
occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I
would have given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and
stockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had had none on
my feet for many years. I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now,
which I took off the feet of two drowned men whom I saw in the
wreck, and I found two pair more in one of the chests, which were
very welcome to me; but they were not like our English shoes,
either for ease or service, being rather what we call pumps than
shoes. I found in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight,
in rials, but no gold: I supposed this belonged to a poorer man
than the other, which seemed to belong to some officer. Well,
however, I lugged this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I
had done that before which I had brought from our own ship; but it
was a great pity, as I said, that the other part of this ship had
not come to my share: for I am satisfied I might have loaded my
canoe several times over with money; and, thought I, if I ever
escape to England, it might lie here safe enough till I come again
and fetch it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;A DREAM REALISED</h3>

<p>Having now brought all my things on shore and secured them, I
went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to
her old harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way
to my old habitation, where I found everything safe and quiet. I
began now to repose myself, live after my old fashion, and take
care of my family affairs; and for a while I lived easy enough,
only that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked out
oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if at any time I did
stir with any freedom, it was always to the east part of the
island, where I was pretty well satisfied the savages never came,
and where I could go without so many precautions, and such a load
of arms and ammunition as I always carried with me if I went the
other way. I lived in this condition near two years more; but my
unlucky head, that was always to let me know it was born to make my
body miserable, was all these two years filled with projects and
designs how, if it were possible, I might get away from this
island: for sometimes I was for making another voyage to the wreck,
though my reason told me that there was nothing left there worth
the hazard of my voyage; sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes
another&mdash;and I believe verily, if I had had the boat that I
went from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound anywhere,
I knew not whither. I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento
to those who are touched with the general plague of mankind,
whence, for aught I know, one half of their miseries flow: I mean
that of not being satisfied with the station wherein God and Nature
hath placed them&mdash;for, not to look back upon my primitive
condition, and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition to
which was, as I may call it, my <i>original sin</i>, my subsequent
mistakes of the same kind had been the means of my coming into this
miserable condition; for had that Providence which so happily
seated me at the Brazils as a planter blessed me with confined
desires, and I could have been contented to have gone on gradually,
I might have been by this time&mdash;I mean in the time of my being
in this island&mdash;one of the most considerable planters in the
Brazils&mdash;nay, I am persuaded, that by the improvements I had
made in that little time I lived there, and the increase I should
probably have made if I had remained, I might have been worth a
hundred thousand moidores&mdash;and what business had I to leave a
settled fortune, a well-stocked plantation, improving and
increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch negroes, when
patience and time would have so increased our stock at home, that
we could have bought them at our own door from those whose business
it was to fetch them? and though it had cost us something more, yet
the difference of that price was by no means worth saving at so
great a hazard. But as this is usually the fate of young heads, so
reflection upon the folly of it is as commonly the exercise of more
years, or of the dear-bought experience of time&mdash;so it was
with me now; and yet so deep had the mistake taken root in my
temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but was
continually poring upon the means and possibility of my escape from
this place; and that I may, with greater pleasure to the reader,
bring on the remaining part of my story, it may not be improper to
give some account of my first conceptions on the subject of this
foolish scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what foundation, I
acted.</p>

<p>I am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my late
voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as
usual, and my condition restored to what it was before: I had more
wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at all the richer;
for I had no more use for it than the Indians of Peru had before
the Spaniards came there.</p>

<p>It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the
four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of
solitude, I was lying in my bed or hammock, awake, very well in
health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor any
uneasiness of mind more than ordinary, but could by no means close
my eyes, that is, so as to sleep; no, not a wink all night long,
otherwise than as follows: It is impossible to set down the
innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great
thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this night's time. I ran
over the whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridgment,
as I may call it, to my coming to this island, and also of that
part of my life since I came to this island. In my reflections upon
the state of my case since I came on shore on this island, I was
comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my
habitation here, with the life of anxiety, fear, and care which I
had lived in ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand.
Not that I did not believe the savages had frequented the island
even all the while, and might have been several hundreds of them at
times on shore there; but I had never known it, and was incapable
of any apprehensions about it; my satisfaction was perfect, though
my danger was the same, and I was as happy in not knowing my danger
as if I had never really been exposed to it. This furnished my
thoughts with many very profitable reflections, and particularly
this one: How infinitely good that Providence is, which has
provided, in its government of mankind, such narrow bounds to his
sight and knowledge of things; and though he walks in the midst of
so many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him,
would distract his mind and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and
calm, by having the events of things hid from his eyes, and knowing
nothing of the dangers which surround him.</p>

<p>After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to
reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many
years in this very island, and how I had walked about in the
greatest security, and with all possible tranquillity, even when
perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill, a great tree, or the casual
approach of night, had been between me and the worst kind of
destruction&mdash;viz. that of falling into the hands of cannibals
and savages, who would have seized on me with the same view as I
would on a goat or turtle; and have thought it no more crime to
kill and devour me than I did of a pigeon or a curlew. I would
unjustly slander myself if I should say I was not sincerely
thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular protection I
acknowledged, with great humanity, all these unknown deliverances
were due, and without which I must inevitably have fallen into
their merciless hands.</p>

<p>When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken
up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures, I mean
the savages, and how it came to pass in the world that the wise
Governor of all things should give up any of His creatures to such
inhumanity&mdash;nay, to something so much below even brutality
itself&mdash;as to devour its own kind: but as this ended in some
(at that time) fruitless speculations, it occurred to me to inquire
what part of the world these wretches lived in? how far off the
coast was from whence they came? what they ventured over so far
from home for? what kind of boats they had? and why I might not
order myself and my business so that I might be able to go over
thither, as they were to come to me?</p>

<p>I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do
with myself when I went thither; what would become of me if I fell
into the hands of these savages; or how I should escape them if
they attacked me; no, nor so much as how it was possible for me to
reach the coast, and not to be attacked by some or other of them,
without any possibility of delivering myself: and if I should not
fall into their hands, what I should do for provision, or whither I
should bend my course: none of these thoughts, I say, so much as
came in my way; but my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my
passing over in my boat to the mainland. I looked upon my present
condition as the most miserable that could possibly be; that I was
not able to throw myself into anything but death, that could be
called worse; and if I reached the shore of the main I might
perhaps meet with relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the
African shore, till I came to some inhabited country, and where I
might find some relief; and after all, perhaps I might fall in with
some Christian ship that might take me in: and if the worst came to
the worst, I could but die, which would put an end to all these
miseries at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed
mind, an impatient temper, made desperate, as it were, by the long
continuance of my troubles, and the disappointments I had met in
the wreck I had been on board of, and where I had been so near
obtaining what I so earnestly longed for&mdash;somebody to speak
to, and to learn some knowledge from them of the place where I was,
and of the probable means of my deliverance. I was agitated wholly
by these thoughts; all my calm of mind, in my resignation to
Providence, and waiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven,
seemed to be suspended; and I had as it were no power to turn my
thoughts to anything but to the project of a voyage to the main,
which came upon me with such force, and such an impetuosity of
desire, that it was not to be resisted.</p>

<p>When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with
such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my
pulse beat as if I had been in a fever, merely with the
extraordinary fervour of my mind about it, Nature&mdash;as if I had
been fatigued and exhausted with the very thoughts of
it&mdash;threw me into a sound sleep. One would have thought I
should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything relating
to it, but I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning as
usual from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven
savages coming to land, and that they brought with them another
savage whom they were going to kill in order to eat him; when, on a
sudden, the savage that they were going to kill jumped away, and
ran for his life; and I thought in my sleep that he came running
into my little thick grove before my fortification, to hide
himself; and that I seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the
others sought him that way, showed myself to him, and smiling upon
him, encouraged him: that he kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me
to assist him; upon which I showed him my ladder, made him go up,
and carried him into my cave, and he became my servant; and that as
soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, "Now I may certainly
venture to the mainland, for this fellow will serve me as a pilot,
and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, and
whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what places to
venture into, and what to shun." I waked with this thought; and was
under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my
escape in my dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon
coming to myself, and finding that it was no more than a dream,
were equally extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very
great dejection of spirits.</p>

<p>Upon this, however, I made this conclusion: that my only way to
go about to attempt an escape was, to endeavour to get a savage
into my possession: and, if possible, it should be one of their
prisoners, whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should bring
hither to kill. But these thoughts still were attended with this
difficulty: that it was impossible to effect this without attacking
a whole caravan of them, and killing them all; and this was not
only a very desperate attempt, and might miscarry, but, on the
other hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to myself;
and my heart trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood,
though it was for my deliverance. I need not repeat the arguments
which occurred to me against this, they being the same mentioned
before; but though I had other reasons to offer now&mdash;viz. that
those men were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they
could; that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree, to
deliver myself from this death of a life, and was acting in my own
defence as much as if they were actually assaulting me, and the
like; I say though these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of
shedding human blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me,
and such as I could by no means reconcile myself to for a great
while. However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself,
and after great perplexities about it (for all these arguments, one
way and another, struggled in my head a long time), the eager
prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest;
and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages into my
hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to contrive how to do
it, and this, indeed, was very difficult to resolve on; but as I
could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put
myself upon the watch, to see them when they came on shore, and
leave the rest to the event; taking such measures as the
opportunity should present, let what would be.</p>

<p>With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the
scout as often as possible, and indeed so often that I was heartily
tired of it; for it was above a year and a half that I waited; and
for great part of that time went out to the west end, and to the
south-west corner of the island almost every day, to look for
canoes, but none appeared. This was very discouraging, and began to
trouble me much, though I cannot say that it did in this case (as
it had done some time before) wear off the edge of my desire to the
thing; but the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager I was
for it: in a word, I was not at first so careful to shun the sight
of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was now eager
to be upon them. Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay,
two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely
slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent
their being able at any time to do me any hurt. It was a great
while that I pleased myself with this affair; but nothing still
presented itself; all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for
no savages came near me for a great while.</p>

<p>About a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and
by long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for
want of an occasion to put them into execution), I was surprised
one morning by seeing no less than five canoes all on shore
together on my side the island, and the people who belonged to them
all landed and out of my sight. The number of them broke all my
measures; for seeing so many, and knowing that they always came
four or six, or sometimes more in a boat, I could not tell what to
think of it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty or thirty
men single-handed; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and
discomforted. However, I put myself into the same position for an
attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for action,
if anything had presented. Having waited a good while, listening to
hear if they made any noise, at length, being very impatient, I set
my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of
the hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, however, that my
head did not appear above the hill, so that they could not perceive
me by any means. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number; that they had
a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed. How they had cooked
it I knew not, or what it was; but they were all dancing, in I know
not how many barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round
the fire.</p>

<p>While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my
perspective, two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where,
it seems, they were laid by, and were now brought out for the
slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fall; being knocked
down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for that was their
way; and two or three others were at work immediately, cutting him
open for their cookery, while the other victim was left standing by
himself, till they should be ready for him. In that very moment
this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at liberty and unbound,
Nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away from
them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands, directly
towards me; I mean towards that part of the coast where my
habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge,
when I perceived him run my way; and especially when, as I thought,
I saw him pursued by the whole body: and now I expected that part
of my dream was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take
shelter in my grove; but I could not depend, by any means, upon my
dream, that the other savages would not pursue him thither and find
him there. However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to
recover when I found that there was not above three men that
followed him; and still more was I encouraged, when I found that he
outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained ground on them;
so that, if he could but hold out for half-an-hour, I saw easily he
would fairly get away from them all.</p>

<p>There was between them and my castle the creek, which I
mentioned often in the first part of my story, where I landed my
cargoes out of the ship; and this I saw plainly he must necessarily
swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken there; but when the
savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though the
tide was then up; but plunging in, swam through in about thirty
strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran with exceeding strength
and swiftness. When the three persons came to the creek, I found
that two of them could swim, but the third could not, and that,
standing on the other side, he looked at the others, but went no
farther, and soon after went softly back again; which, as it
happened, was very well for him in the end. I observed that the two
who swam were yet more than twice as strong swimming over the creek
as the fellow was that fled from them. It came very warmly upon my
thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me
a servant, and, perhaps, a companion or assistant; and that I was
plainly called by Providence to save this poor creature's life. I
immediately ran down the ladders with all possible expedition,
fetched my two guns, for they were both at the foot of the ladders,
as I observed before, and getting up again with the same haste to
the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea; and having a very
short cut, and all down hill, placed myself in the way between the
pursuers and the pursued, hallowing aloud to him that fled, who,
looking back, was at first perhaps as much frightened at me as at
them; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back; and, in the
meantime, I slowly advanced towards the two that followed; then
rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the
stock of my piece. I was loath to fire, because I would not have
the rest hear; though, at that distance, it would not have been
easily heard, and being out of sight of the smoke, too, they would
not have known what to make of it. Having knocked this fellow down,
the other who pursued him stopped, as if he had been frightened,
and I advanced towards him: but as I came nearer, I perceived
presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at
me: so I was then obliged to shoot at him first, which I did, and
killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who fled, but had
stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen and killed, as he
thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and noise of my piece
that he stood stock still, and neither came forward nor went
backward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to
come on. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come forward,
which he easily understood, and came a little way; then stopped
again, and then a little farther, and stopped again; and I could
then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken
prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies were.
I beckoned to him again to come to me, and gave him all the signs
of encouragement that I could think of; and he came nearer and
nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of
acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at him, and looked
pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer; at length he
came close to me; and then he kneeled down again, kissed the
ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by the
foot, set my foot upon his head; this, it seems, was in token of
swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up and made much of
him, and encouraged him all I could. But there was more work to do
yet; for I perceived the savage whom I had knocked down was not
killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to come to himself: so
I pointed to him, and showed him the savage, that he was not dead;
upon this he spoke some words to me, and though I could not
understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear; for they
were the first sound of a man's voice that I had heard, my own
excepted, for above twenty-five years. But there was no time for
such reflections now; the savage who was knocked down recovered
himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I perceived that
my savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my
other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this my
savage, for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my
sword, which hung naked in a belt by my side, which I did. He no
sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut off
his head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it
sooner or better; which I thought very strange for one who, I had
reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except
their own wooden swords: however, it seems, as I learned
afterwards, they make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and
the wood is so hard, that they will even cut off heads with them,
ay, and arms, and that at one blow, too. When he had done this, he
comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword
again, and with abundance of gestures which I did not understand,
laid it down, with the head of the savage that he had killed, just
before me. But that which astonished him most was to know how I
killed the other Indian so far off; so, pointing to him, he made
signs to me to let him go to him; and I bade him go, as well as I
could. When he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at
him, turning him first on one side, then on the other; looked at
the wound the bullet had made, which it seems was just in his
breast, where it had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood
had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He
took up his bow and arrows, and came back; so I turned to go away,
and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him that more might
come after them. Upon this he made signs to me that he should bury
them with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if they
followed; and so I made signs to him again to do so. He fell to
work; and in an instant he had scraped a hole in the sand with his
hands big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him into
it, and covered him; and did so by the other also; I believe he had
him buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then, calling away, I
carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on the
farther part of the island: so I did not let my dream come to pass
in that part, that he came into my grove for shelter. Here I gave
him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water,
which I found he was indeed in great distress for, from his
running: and having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go and
lie down to sleep, showing him a place where I had laid some
rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon
myself sometimes; so the poor creature lay down, and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with
straight, strong limbs, not too large; tall, and well-shaped; and,
as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a very good
countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have
something very manly in his face; and yet he had all the sweetness
and softness of a European in his countenance, too, especially when
he smiled. His hair was long and black, not curled like wool; his
forehead very high and large; and a great vivacity and sparkling
sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite black,
but very tawny; and yet not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the
Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of
a bright kind of a dun olive-colour, that had in it something very
agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His face was round and
plump; his nose small, not flat, like the negroes; a very good
mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and as white as
ivory.</p>

<p>After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half-an-hour,
he awoke again, and came out of the cave to me: for I had been
milking my goats which I had in the enclosure just by: when he
espied me he came running to me, laying himself down again upon the
ground, with all the possible signs of an humble, thankful
disposition, making a great many antic gestures to show it. At last
he lays his head flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets
my other foot upon his head, as he had done before; and after this
made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and submission
imaginable, to let me know how he would serve me so long as he
lived. I understood him in many things, and let him know I was very
well pleased with him. In a little time I began to speak to him;
and teach him to speak to me: and first, I let him know his name
should be Friday, which was the day I saved his life: I called him
so for the memory of the time. I likewise taught him to say Master;
and then let him know that was to be my name: I likewise taught him
to say Yes and No and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some
milk in an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and
sop my bread in it; and gave him a cake of bread to do the like,
which he quickly complied with, and made signs that it was very
good for him. I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as
it was day I beckoned to him to come with me, and let him know I
would give him some clothes; at which he seemed very glad, for he
was stark naked. As we went by the place where he had buried the
two men, he pointed exactly to the place, and showed me the marks
that he had made to find them again, making signs to me that we
should dig them up again and eat them. At this I appeared very
angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at
the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to him to come away,
which he did immediately, with great submission. I then led him up
to the top of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone; and
pulling out my glass I looked, and saw plainly the place where they
had been, but no appearance of them or their canoes; so that it was
plain they were gone, and had left their two comrades behind them,
without any search after them.</p>

<p>But I was not content with this discovery; but having now more
courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with
me, giving him the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at
his back, which I found he could use very dexterously, making him
carry one gun for me, and I two for myself; and away we marched to
the place where these creatures had been; for I had a mind now to
get some further intelligence of them. When I came to the place my
very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk within me, at
the horror of the spectacle; indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at
least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing of it. The place
was covered with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, and
great pieces of flesh left here and there, half-eaten, mangled, and
scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the triumphant feast
they had been making there, after a victory over their enemies. I
saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four legs
and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies; and Friday,
by his signs, made me understand that they brought over four
prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that
he, pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there had been a
great battle between them and their next king, of whose subjects,
it seems, he had been one, and that they had taken a great number
of prisoners; all which were carried to several places by those who
had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was
done here by these wretches upon those they brought hither.</p>

<p>I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and
whatever remained, and lay them together in a heap, and make a
great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had
still a hankering stomach after some of the flesh, and was still a
cannibal in his nature; but I showed so much abhorrence at the very
thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of it, that he durst
not discover it: for I had, by some means, let him know that I
would kill him if he offered it.</p>

<p>When he had done this, we came back to our castle; and there I
fell to work for my man Friday; and first of all, I gave him a pair
of linen drawers, which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I
mentioned, which I found in the wreck, and which, with a little
alteration, fitted him very well; and then I made him a jerkin of
goat's skin, as well as my skill would allow (for I was now grown a
tolerably good tailor); and I gave him a cap which I made of hare's
skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough; and thus he was
clothed, for the present, tolerably well, and was mighty well
pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his master. It is
true he went awkwardly in these clothes at first: wearing the
drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat
galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a little
easing them where he complained they hurt him, and using himself to
them, he took to them at length very well.</p>

<p>The next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to
consider where I should lodge him: and that I might do well for him
and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in
the vacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside of
the last, and in the outside of the first. As there was a door or
entrance there into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and
a door to it, of boards, and set it up in the passage, a little
within the entrance; and, causing the door to open in the inside, I
barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders, too; so that
Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost wall,
without making so much noise in getting over that it must needs
awaken me; for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of
long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the
hill; which was again laid across with smaller sticks, instead of
laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with the
rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds; and at the hole or place
which was left to go in or out by the ladder I had placed a kind of
trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would
not have opened at all, but would have fallen down and made a great
noise&mdash;as to weapons, I took them all into my side every
night. But I needed none of all this precaution; for never man had
a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me:
without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and
engaged; his very affections were tied to me, like those of a child
to a father; and I daresay he would have sacrificed his life to
save mine upon any occasion whatsoever&mdash;the many testimonies
he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and soon convinced me that
I needed to use no precautions for my safety on his account.</p>

<p>This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
wonder, that however it had pleased God in His providence, and in
the government of the works of His hands, to take from so great a
part of the world of His creatures the best uses to which their
faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted, yet that He
has bestowed upon them the same powers, the same reason, the same
affections, the same sentiments of kindness and obligation, the
same passions and resentments of wrongs, the same sense of
gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing
good and receiving good that He has given to us; and that when He
pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these, they are as
ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses for which
they were bestowed than we are. This made me very melancholy
sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how
mean a use we make of all these, even though we have these powers
enlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God,
and by the knowledge of His word added to our understanding; and
why it has pleased God to hide the like saving knowledge from so
many millions of souls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage,
would make a much better use of it than we did. From hence I
sometimes was led too far, to invade the sovereignty of Providence,
and, as it were, arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition
of things, that should hide that sight from some, and reveal it to
others, and yet expect a like duty from both; but I shut it up, and
checked my thoughts with this conclusion: first, that we did not
know by what light and law these should be condemned; but that as
God was necessarily, and by the nature of His being, infinitely
holy and just, so it could not be, but if these creatures were all
sentenced to absence from Himself, it was on account of sinning
against that light which, as the Scripture says, was a law to
themselves, and by such rules as their consciences would
acknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not discovered to
us; and secondly, that still as we all are the clay in the hand of
the potter, no vessel could say to him, "Why hast thou formed me
thus?"</p>

<p>But to return to my new companion. I was greatly delighted with
him, and made it my business to teach him everything that was
proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to
make him speak, and understand me when I spoke; and he was the
aptest scholar that ever was; and particularly was so merry, so
constantly diligent, and so pleased when he could but understand
me, or make me understand him, that it was very pleasant for me to
talk to him. Now my life began to be so easy that I began to say to
myself that could I but have been safe from more savages, I cared
not if I was never to remove from the place where I lived.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV&mdash;FRIDAY'S EDUCATION</h3>

<p>After I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I
thought that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of
feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to
let him taste other flesh; so I took him out with me one morning to
the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own
flock; and bring it home and dress it; but as I was going I saw a
she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting by
her. I catched hold of Friday. "Hold," said I, "stand still;" and
made signs to him not to stir: immediately I presented my piece,
shot, and killed one of the kids. The poor creature, who had at a
distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not
know, nor could imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised,
trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed that I thought he would
have sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceive I had
killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel whether he was not
wounded; and, as I found presently, thought I was resolved to kill
him: for he came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees,
said a great many things I did not understand; but I could easily
see the meaning was to pray me not to kill him.</p>

<p>I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm;
and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the
kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which
he did: and while he was wondering, and looking to see how the
creature was killed, I loaded my gun again. By-and-by I saw a great
fowl, like a hawk, sitting upon a tree within shot; so, to let
Friday understand a little what I would do, I called him to me
again, pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I
thought it had been a hawk; I say, pointing to the parrot, and to
my gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let him see I would
make it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and kill
that bird; accordingly, I fired, and bade him look, and immediately
he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened again,
notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found he was the more
amazed, because he did not see me put anything into the gun, but
thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death and
destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or
anything near or far off; and the astonishment this created in him
was such as could not wear off for a long time; and I believe, if I
would have let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As for
the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for several days
after; but he would speak to it and talk to it, as if it had
answered him, when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards
learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him. Well, after his
astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to him to run and
fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but stayed some time; for
the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered away a good
distance from the place where she fell: however, he found her, took
her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceived his ignorance
about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun
again, and not to let him see me do it, that I might be ready for
any other mark that might present; but nothing more offered at that
time: so I brought home the kid, and the same evening I took the
skin off, and cut it out as well as I could; and having a pot fit
for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made
some very good broth. After I had begun to eat some I gave some to
my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well; but
that which was strangest to him was to see me eat salt with it. He
made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat; and putting a
little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit
and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it: on
the other hand, I took some meat into my mouth without salt, and I
pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as much as he had
done at the salt; but it would not do; he would never care for salt
with meat or in his broth; at least, not for a great while, and
then but a very little.</p>

<p>Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved
to feast him the next day by roasting a piece of the kid: this I
did by hanging it before the fire on a string, as I had seen many
people do in England, setting two poles up, one on each side of the
fire, and one across the top, and tying the string to the cross
stick, letting the meat turn continually. This Friday admired very
much; but when he came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to
tell me how well he liked it, that I could not but understand him:
and at last he told me, as well as he could, he would never eat
man's flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear.</p>

<p>The next day I set him to work beating some corn out, and
sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before; and he
soon understood how to do it as well as I, especially after he had
seen what the meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of;
for after that I let him see me make my bread, and bake it too; and
in a little time Friday was able to do all the work for me as well
as I could do it myself.</p>

<p>I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed instead
of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a
larger quantity of corn than I used to do; so I marked out a larger
piece of land, and began the fence in the same manner as before, in
which Friday worked not only very willingly and very hard, but did
it very cheerfully: and I told him what it was for; that it was for
corn to make more bread, because he was now with me, and that I
might have enough for him and myself too. He appeared very sensible
of that part, and let me know that he thought I had much more
labour upon me on his account than I had for myself; and that he
would work the harder for me if I would tell him what to do.</p>

<p>This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this
place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names
of almost everything I had occasion to call for, and of every place
I had to send him to, and talked a great deal to me; so that, in
short, I began now to have some use for my tongue again, which,
indeed, I had very little occasion for before. Besides the pleasure
of talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow
himself: his simple, unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more
every day, and I began really to love the creature; and on his side
I believe he loved me more than it was possible for him ever to
love anything before.</p>

<p>I had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his own
country again; and having taught him English so well that he could
answer me almost any question, I asked him whether the nation that
he belonged to never conquered in battle? At which he smiled, and
said&mdash;"Yes, yes, we always fight the better;" that is, he
meant always get the better in fight; and so we began the following
discourse:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Master</i>.&mdash;You always fight the better; how came you
to be taken prisoner, then, Friday?</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;My nation beat much for all that.</p>

<p><i>Master</i>.&mdash;How beat? If your nation beat them, how
came you to be taken?</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;They more many than my nation, in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me: my nation
over-beat them in the yonder place, where me no was; there my
nation take one, two, great thousand.</p>

<p><i>Master</i>.&mdash;But why did not your side recover you from
the hands of your enemies, then?</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;They run, one, two, three, and me, and make
go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.</p>

<p><i>Master</i>.&mdash;Well, Friday, and what does your nation do
with the men they take? Do they carry them away and eat them, as
these did?</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Yes, my nation eat mans too; eat all
up.</p>

<p><i>Master</i>.&mdash;Where do they carry them?</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Go to other place, where they think.</p>

<p><i>Master</i>.&mdash;Do they come hither?</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else
place.</p>

<p><i>Master</i>.&mdash;Have you been here with them?</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Yes, I have been here (points to the NW.
side of the island, which, it seems, was their side).</p>

<p>By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been among
the savages who used to come on shore on the farther part of the
island, on the same man-eating occasions he was now brought for;
and some time after, when I took the courage to carry him to that
side, being the same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the
place, and told me he was there once, when they ate up twenty men,
two women, and one child; he could not tell twenty in English, but
he numbered them by laying so many stones in a row, and pointing to
me to tell them over.</p>

<p>I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows:
that after this discourse I had with him, I asked him how far it
was from our island to the shore, and whether the canoes were not
often lost. He told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost:
but that after a little way out to sea, there was a current and
wind, always one way in the morning, the other in the afternoon.
This I understood to be no more than the sets of the tide, as going
out or coming in; but I afterwards understood it was occasioned by
the great draft and reflux of the mighty river Orinoco, in the
mouth or gulf of which river, as I found afterwards, our island
lay; and that this land, which I perceived to be W. and NW., was
the great island Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth of the
river. I asked Friday a thousand questions about the country, the
inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were near; he
told me all he knew with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked
him the names of the several nations of his sort of people, but
could get no other name than Caribs; from whence I easily
understood that these were the Caribbees, which our maps place on
the part of America which reaches from the mouth of the river
Orinoco to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha. He told me that up a
great way beyond the moon, that was beyond the setting of the moon,
which must be west from their country, there dwelt white bearded
men, like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned
before; and that they had killed much mans, that was his word: by
all which I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in
America had been spread over the whole country, and were remembered
by all the nations from father to son.</p>

<p>I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this island,
and get among those white men. He told me, "Yes, yes, you may go in
two canoe." I could not understand what he meant, or make him
describe to me what he meant by two canoe, till at last, with great
difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a large boat, as big as
two canoes. This part of Friday's discourse I began to relish very
well; and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one time or
other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape from this
place, and that this poor savage might be a means to help me.</p>

<p>During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that
he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to
lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly I
asked him one time, who made him. The creature did not understand
me at all, but thought I had asked who was his father&mdash;but I
took it up by another handle, and asked him who made the sea, the
ground we walked on, and the hills and woods. He told me, "It was
one Benamuckee, that lived beyond all;" he could describe nothing
of this great person, but that he was very old, "much older," he
said, "than the sea or land, than the moon or the stars." I asked
him then, if this old person had made all things, why did not all
things worship him? He looked very grave, and, with a perfect look
of innocence, said, "All things say O to him." I asked him if the
people who die in his country went away anywhere? He said, "Yes;
they all went to Benamuckee." Then I asked him whether those they
eat up went thither too. He said, "Yes."</p>

<p>From these things, I began to instruct him in the knowledge of
the true God; I told him that the great Maker of all things lived
up there, pointing up towards heaven; that He governed the world by
the same power and providence by which He made it; that He was
omnipotent, and could do everything for us, give everything to us,
take everything from us; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes.
He listened with great attention, and received with pleasure the
notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us; and of the manner
of making our prayers to God, and His being able to hear us, even
in heaven. He told me one day, that if our God could hear us, up
beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater God than their
Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear
till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt to speak to
them. I asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him. He said,
"No; they never went that were young men; none went thither but the
old men," whom he called their Oowokakee; that is, as I made him
explain to me, their religious, or clergy; and that they went to
say O (so he called saying prayers), and then came back and told
them what Benamuckee said. By this I observed, that there is
priestcraft even among the most blinded, ignorant pagans in the
world; and the policy of making a secret of religion, in order to
preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy, not only to be
found in the Roman, but, perhaps, among all religions in the world,
even among the most brutish and barbarous savages.</p>

<p>I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday; and told
him that the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to
say O to their god Benamuckee was a cheat; and their bringing word
from thence what he said was much more so; that if they met with
any answer, or spake with any one there, it must be with an evil
spirit; and then I entered into a long discourse with him about the
devil, the origin of him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to
man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark parts of
the world to be worshipped instead of God, and as God, and the many
stratagems he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin; how he
had a secret access to our passions and to our affections, and to
adapt his snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to be
our own tempters, and run upon our destruction by our own
choice.</p>

<p>I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind
about the devil as it was about the being of a God. Nature assisted
all my arguments to evidence to him even the necessity of a great
First Cause, an overruling, governing Power, a secret directing
Providence, and of the equity and justice of paying homage to Him
that made us, and the like; but there appeared nothing of this kind
in the notion of an evil spirit, of his origin, his being, his
nature, and above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw
us in to do so too; and the poor creature puzzled me once in such a
manner, by a question merely natural and innocent, that I scarce
knew what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal to him of
the power of God, His omnipotence, His aversion to sin, His being a
consuming fire to the workers of iniquity; how, as He had made us
all, He could destroy us and all the world in a moment; and he
listened with great seriousness to me all the while. After this I
had been telling him how the devil was God's enemy in the hearts of
men, and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs
of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and
the like. "Well," says Friday, "but you say God is so strong, so
great; is He not much strong, much might as the devil?" "Yes, yes,"
says I, "Friday; God is stronger than the devil&mdash;God is above
the devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him down under our
feet, and enable us to resist his temptations and quench his fiery
darts." "But," says he again, "if God much stronger, much might as
the wicked devil, why God no kill the devil, so make him no more do
wicked?" I was strangely surprised at this question; and, after
all, though I was now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and
ill qualified for a casuist or a solver of difficulties; and at
first I could not tell what to say; so I pretended not to hear him,
and asked him what he said; but he was too earnest for an answer to
forget his question, so that he repeated it in the very same broken
words as above. By this time I had recovered myself a little, and I
said, "God will at last punish him severely; he is reserved for the
judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with
everlasting fire." This did not satisfy Friday; but he returns upon
me, repeating my words, "'<i>Reserve at last</i>!' me no
understand&mdash;but why not kill the devil now; not kill great
ago?" "You may as well ask me," said I, "why God does not kill you
or me, when we do wicked things here that offend Him&mdash;we are
preserved to repent and be pardoned." He mused some time on this.
"Well, well," says he, mighty affectionately, "that well&mdash;so
you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all."
Here I was run down again by him to the last degree; and it was a
testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature, though they will
guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God, and of a
worship or homage due to the supreme being of God, as the
consequence of our nature, yet nothing but divine revelation can
form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption purchased for
us; of a Mediator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor at the
footstool of God's throne; I say, nothing but a revelation from
Heaven can form these in the soul; and that, therefore, the gospel
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and
the Spirit of God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of His
people, are the absolutely necessary instructors of the souls of
men in the saving knowledge of God and the means of salvation.</p>

<p>I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my
man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going out;
then sending him for something a good way off, I seriously prayed
to God that He would enable me to instruct savingly this poor
savage; assisting, by His Spirit, the heart of the poor ignorant
creature to receive the light of the knowledge of God in Christ,
reconciling him to Himself, and would guide me so to speak to him
from the Word of God that his conscience might be convinced, his
eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he came again to me, I
entered into a long discourse with him upon the subject of the
redemption of man by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine
of the gospel preached from Heaven, viz. of repentance towards God,
and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him as
well as I could why our blessed Redeemer took not on Him the nature
of angels but the seed of Abraham; and how, for that reason, the
fallen angels had no share in the redemption; that He came only to
the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.</p>

<p>I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the
methods I took for this poor creature's instruction, and must
acknowledge, what I believe all that act upon the same principle
will find, that in laying things open to him, I really informed and
instructed myself in many things that either I did not know or had
not fully considered before, but which occurred naturally to my
mind upon searching into them, for the information of this poor
savage; and I had more affection in my inquiry after things upon
this occasion than ever I felt before: so that, whether this poor
wild wretch was better for me or no, I had great reason to be
thankful that ever he came to me; my grief sat lighter, upon me; my
habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure: and when I
reflected that in this solitary life which I have been confined to,
I had not only been moved to look up to heaven myself, and to seek
the Hand that had brought me here, but was now to be made an
instrument, under Providence, to save the life, and, for aught I
knew, the soul of a poor savage, and bring him to the true
knowledge of religion and of the Christian doctrine, that he might
know Christ Jesus, in whom is life eternal; I say, when I reflected
upon all these things, a secret joy ran through every part of My
soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to this
place, which I had so often thought the most dreadful of all
afflictions that could possibly have befallen me.</p>

<p>I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time;
and the conversation which employed the hours between Friday and me
was such as made the three years which we lived there together
perfectly and completely happy, if any such thing as complete
happiness can be formed in a sublunary state. This savage was now a
good Christian, a much better than I; though I have reason to hope,
and bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted,
restored penitents. We had here the Word of God to read, and no
farther off from His Spirit to instruct than if we had been in
England. I always applied myself, in reading the Scripture, to let
him know, as well as I could, the meaning of what I read; and he
again, by his serious inquiries and questionings, made me, as I
said before, a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge than
I should ever have been by my own mere private reading. Another
thing I cannot refrain from observing here also, from experience in
this retired part of my life, viz. how infinite and inexpressible a
blessing it is that the knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of
salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the Word of
God, so easy to be received and understood, that, as the bare
reading the Scripture made me capable of understanding enough of my
duty to carry me directly on to the great work of sincere
repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life and
salvation, to a stated reformation in practice, and obedience to
all God's commands, and this without any teacher or instructor, I
mean human; so the same plain instruction sufficiently served to
the enlightening this savage creature, and bringing him to be such
a Christian as I have known few equal to him in my life.</p>

<p>As to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention which
have happened in the world about religion, whether niceties in
doctrines or schemes of church government, they were all perfectly
useless to us, and, for aught I can yet see, they have been so to
the rest of the world. We had the sure guide to heaven, viz. the
Word of God; and we had, blessed be God, comfortable views of the
Spirit of God teaching and instructing by His word, leading us into
all truth, and making us both willing and obedient to the
instruction of His word. And I cannot see the least use that the
greatest knowledge of the disputed points of religion, which have
made such confusion in the world, would have been to us, if we
could have obtained it. But I must go on with the historical part
of things, and take every part in its order.</p>

<p>After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that
he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty
fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted him with my
own history, or at least so much of it as related to my coming to
this place: how I had lived there, and how long; I let him into the
mystery, for such it was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and
taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was
wonderfully delighted with; and I made him a belt, with a frog
hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in; and in the
frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only
as good a weapon in some cases, but much more useful upon other
occasions.</p>

<p>I described to him the country of Europe, particularly England,
which I came from; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we
behaved to one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of
the world. I gave him an account of the wreck which I had been on
board of, and showed him, as near as I could, the place where she
lay; but she was all beaten in pieces before, and gone. I showed
him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and which
I could not stir with my whole strength then; but was now fallen
almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood, musing a
great while, and said nothing. I asked him what it was he studied
upon. At last says he, "Me see such boat like come to place at my
nation." I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I
had examined further into it, I understood by him that a boat, such
as that had been, came on shore upon the country where he lived:
that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of
weather. I presently imagined that some European ship must have
been cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose and
drive ashore; but was so dull that I never once thought of men
making their escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they
might come: so I only inquired after a description of the boat.</p>

<p>Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought me
better to understand him when he added with some warmth, "We save
the white mans from drown." Then I presently asked if there were
any white mans, as he called them, in the boat. "Yes," he said;
"the boat full of white mans." I asked him how many. He told upon
his fingers seventeen. I asked him then what became of them. He
told me, "They live, they dwell at my nation."</p>

<p>This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined
that these might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast
away in the sight of my island, as I now called it; and who, after
the ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost,
had saved themselves in their boat, and were landed upon that wild
shore among the savages. Upon this I inquired of him more
critically what was become of them. He assured me they lived still
there; that they had been there about four years; that the savages
left them alone, and gave them victuals to live on. I asked him how
it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them. He said, "No,
they make brother with them;" that is, as I understood him, a
truce; and then he added, "They no eat mans but when make the war
fight;" that is to say, they never eat any men but such as come to
fight with them and are taken in battle.</p>

<p>It was after this some considerable time, that being upon the
top of the hill at the east side of the island, from whence, as I
have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the main or continent
of America, Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very
earnestly towards the mainland, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a
jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some
distance from him. I asked him what was the matter. "Oh, joy!" says
he; "Oh, glad! there see my country, there my nation!" I observed
an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and his
eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a strange eagerness,
as if he had a mind to be in his own country again. This
observation of mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made
me at first not so easy about my new man Friday as I was before;
and I made no doubt but that, if Friday could get back to his own
nation again, he would not only forget all his religion but all his
obligation to me, and would be forward enough to give his
countrymen an account of me, and come back, perhaps with a hundred
or two of them, and make a feast upon me, at which he might be as
merry as he used to be with those of his enemies when they were
taken in war. But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for
which I was very sorry afterwards. However, as my jealousy
increased, and held some weeks, I was a little more circumspect,
and not so familiar and kind to him as before: in which I was
certainly wrong too; the honest, grateful creature having no
thought about it but what consisted with the best principles, both
as a religious Christian and as a grateful friend, as appeared
afterwards to my full satisfaction.</p>

<p>While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day
pumping him to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts
which I suspected were in him; but I found everything he said was
so honest and so innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my
suspicion; and in spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last
entirely his own again; nor did he in the least perceive that I was
uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit.</p>

<p>One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at
sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called to him, and
said, "Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own country, your
own nation?" "Yes," he said, "I be much O glad to be at my own
nation." "What would you do there?" said I. "Would you turn wild
again, eat men's flesh again, and be a savage as you were before?"
He looked full of concern, and shaking his head, said, "No, no,
Friday tell them to live good; tell them to pray God; tell them to
eat corn-bread, cattle flesh, milk; no eat man again." "Why, then,"
said I to him, "they will kill you." He looked grave at that, and
then said, "No, no, they no kill me, they willing love learn." He
meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He added, they
learned much of the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I
asked him if he would go back to them. He smiled at that, and told
me that he could not swim so far. I told him I would make a canoe
for him. He told me he would go if I would go with him. "I go!"
says I; "why, they will eat me if I come there." "No, no," says he,
"me make they no eat you; me make they much love you." He meant, he
would tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved his life,
and so he would make them love me. Then he told me, as well as he
could, how kind they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men,
as he called them who came on shore there in distress.</p>

<p>From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and see
if I could possibly join with those bearded men, who I made no
doubt were Spaniards and Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could,
we might find some method to escape from thence, being upon the
continent, and a good company together, better than I could from an
island forty miles off the shore, alone and without help. So, after
some days, I took Friday to work again by way of discourse, and
told him I would give him a boat to go back to his own nation; and,
accordingly, I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
side of the island, and having cleared it of water (for I always
kept it sunk in water), I brought it out, showed it him, and we
both went into it. I found he was a most dexterous fellow at
managing it, and would make it go almost as swift again as I could.
So when he was in, I said to him, "Well, now, Friday, shall we go
to your nation?" He looked very dull at my saying so; which it
seems was because he thought the boat was too small to go so far. I
then told him I had a bigger; so the next day I went to the place
where the first boat lay which I had made, but which I could not
get into the water. He said that was big enough; but then, as I had
taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty years
there, the sun had so split and dried it, that it was rotten.
Friday told me such a boat would do very well, and would carry
"much enough vittle, drink, bread;" this was his way of
talking.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;RESCUE OF PRISONERS FROM CANNIBALS</h3>

<p>Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of
going over with him to the continent that I told him we would go
and make one as big as that, and he should go home in it. He
answered not one word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked him
what was the matter with him. He asked me again, "Why you angry mad
with Friday?&mdash;what me done?" I asked him what he meant. I told
him I was not angry with him at all. "No angry!" says he, repeating
the words several times; "why send Friday home away to my nation?"
"Why," says I, "Friday, did not you say you wished you were there?"
"Yes, yes," says he, "wish we both there; no wish Friday there, no
master there." In a word, he would not think of going there without
me. "I go there, Friday?" says I; "what shall I do there?" He
turned very quick upon me at this. "You do great deal much good,"
says he; "you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans; you tell
them know God, pray God, and live new life." "Alas, Friday!" says
I, "thou knowest not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man
myself." "Yes, yes," says he, "you teachee me good, you teachee
them good." "No, no, Friday," says I, "you shall go without me;
leave me here to live by myself, as I did before." He looked
confused again at that word; and running to one of the hatchets
which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it to me.
"What must I do with this?" says I to him. "You take kill Friday,"
says he. "What must kill you for?" said I again. He returns very
quick&mdash;"What you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no
send Friday away." This he spoke so earnestly that I saw tears
stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost
affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I told
him then and often after, that I would never send him away from me
if he was willing to stay with me.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled
affection to me, and that nothing could part him from me, so I
found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country was
laid in his ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my
doing them good; a thing which, as I had no notion of myself, so I
had not the least thought or intention, or desire of undertaking
it. But still I found a strong inclination to attempting my escape,
founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse, that there
were seventeen bearded men there; and therefore, without any more
delay, I went to work with Friday to find out a great tree proper
to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe, to undertake the
voyage. There were trees enough in the island to have built a
little fleet, not of periaguas or canoes, but even of good, large
vessels; but the main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the
water that we might launch it when it was made, to avoid the
mistake I committed at first. At last Friday pitched upon a tree;
for I found he knew much better than I what kind of wood was
fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what wood to call the
tree we cut down, except that it was very like the tree we call
fustic, or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of
the same colour and smell. Friday wished to burn the hollow or
cavity of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but I showed him
how to cut it with tools; which, after I had showed him how to use,
he did very handily; and in about a month's hard labour we finished
it and made it very handsome; especially when, with our axes, which
I showed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the
true shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost us near a
fortnight's time to get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon
great rollers into the water; but when she was in, she would have
carried twenty men with great ease.</p>

<p>When she was in the water, though she was so big, it amazed me
to see with what dexterity and how swift my man Friday could manage
her, turn her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he would,
and if we might venture over in her. "Yes," he said, "we venture
over in her very well, though great blow wind." However I had a
further design that he knew nothing of, and that was, to make a
mast and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As to a
mast, that was easy enough to get; so I pitched upon a straight
young cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and which there
were great plenty of in the island, and I set Friday to work to cut
it down, and gave him directions how to shape and order it. But as
to the sail, that was my particular care. I knew I had old sails,
or rather pieces of old sails, enough; but as I had had them now
six-and-twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to
preserve them, not imagining that I should ever have this kind of
use for them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten; and,
indeed, most of them were so. However, I found two pieces which
appeared pretty good, and with these I went to work; and with a
great deal of pains, and awkward stitching, you may be sure, for
want of needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like
what we call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a
boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as
usually our ships' long-boats sail with, and such as I best knew
how to manage, as it was such a one as I had to the boat in which I
made my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part of my
story.</p>

<p>I was near two months performing this last work, viz. rigging
and fitting my masts and sails; for I finished them very complete,
making a small stay, and a sail, or foresail, to it, to assist if
we should turn to windward; and, what was more than all, I fixed a
rudder to the stern of her to steer with. I was but a bungling
shipwright, yet as I knew the usefulness and even necessity of such
a thing, I applied myself with so much pains to do it, that at last
I brought it to pass; though, considering the many dull
contrivances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost as
much labour as making the boat.</p>

<p>After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what
belonged to the navigation of my boat; though he knew very well how
to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing of what belonged to a sail and a
rudder; and was the most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and
again in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail jibed, and filled
this way or that way as the course we sailed changed; I say when he
saw this he stood like one astonished and amazed. However, with a
little use, I made all these things familiar to him, and he became
an expert sailor, except that of the compass I could make him
understand very little. On the other hand, as there was very little
cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there
was the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were always
to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy
seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad either by land or
sea.</p>

<p>I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my
captivity in this place; though the three last years that I had
this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the account,
my habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of
the time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here with the same
thankfulness to God for His mercies as at first: and if I had such
cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so now, having
such additional testimonies of the care of Providence over me, and
the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily delivered;
for I had an invincible impression upon my thoughts that my
deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be another year in
this place. I went on, however, with my husbandry; digging,
planting, and fencing as usual. I gathered and cured my grapes, and
did every necessary thing as before.</p>

<p>The rainy season was in the meantime upon me, when I kept more
within doors than at other times. We had stowed our new vessel as
secure as we could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I
said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship; and hauling
her up to the shore at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a
little dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to
give her water enough to float in; and then, when the tide was out,
we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the water out;
and so she lay, dry as to the tide from the sea: and to keep the
rain off we laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick that she
was as well thatched as a house; and thus we waited for the months
of November and December, in which I designed to make my
adventure.</p>

<p>When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my
design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for
the voyage. And the first thing I did was to lay by a certain
quantity of provisions, being the stores for our voyage; and
intended in a week or a fortnight's time to open the dock, and
launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon something of this
kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him to go to the sea-shore
and see if he could find a turtle or a tortoise, a thing which we
generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the
flesh. Friday had not been long gone when he came running back, and
flew over my outer wall or fence, like one that felt not the ground
or the steps he set his foot on; and before I had time to speak to
him he cries out to me, "O master! O master! O sorrow! O
bad!"&mdash;"What's the matter, Friday?" says I. "O yonder there,"
says he, "one, two, three canoes; one, two, three!" By this way of
speaking I concluded there were six; but on inquiry I found there
were but three. "Well, Friday," says I, "do not be frightened." So
I heartened him up as well as I could. However, I saw the poor
fellow was most terribly scared, for nothing ran in his head but
that they were come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces
and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled so that I scarcely knew
what to do with him. I comforted him as well as I could, and told
him I was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat me as
well as him. "But," says I, "Friday, we must resolve to fight them.
Can you fight, Friday?" "Me shoot," says he, "but there come many
great number." "No matter for that," said I again; "our guns will
fright them that we do not kill." So I asked him whether, if I
resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and do
just as I bid him. He said, "Me die when you bid die, master." So I
went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I had been so
good a husband of my rum that I had a great deal left. When we had
drunk it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we always
carried, and loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small
pistol-bullets. Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two
slugs and five small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with
a brace of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by
my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. When I had thus prepared
myself, I took my perspective glass, and went up to the side of the
hill, to see what I could discover; and I found quickly by my glass
that there were one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three
canoes; and that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant
banquet upon these three human bodies: a barbarous feast, indeed!
but nothing more than, as I had observed, was usual with them. I
observed also that they had landed, not where they had done when
Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek, where the shore was
low, and where a thick wood came almost close down to the sea.
This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came
about, filled me with such indignation that I came down again to
Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to them and kill
them all; and asked him if he would stand by me. He had now got
over his fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the
dram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before,
he would die when I bid die.</p>

<p>In this fit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged, as
before, between us; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his
girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol and
the other three guns myself; and in this posture we marched out. I
took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large
bag with more powder and bullets; and as to orders, I charged him
to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything
till I bid him, and in the meantime not to speak a word. In this
posture I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as
well to get over the creek as to get into the wood, so that I could
come within shot of them before I should be discovered, which I had
seen by my glass it was easy to do.</p>

<p>While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I
began to abate my resolution: I do not mean that I entertained any
fear of their number, for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it
is certain I was superior to them&mdash;nay, though I had been
alone. But it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what occasion,
much less what necessity I was in to go and dip my hands in blood,
to attack people who had neither done or intended me any wrong?
who, as to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous customs were
their own disaster, being in them a token, indeed, of God's having
left them, with the other nations of that part of the world, to
such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses, but did not call me to
take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an
executioner of His justice&mdash;that whenever He thought fit He
would take the cause into His own hands, and by national vengeance
punish them as a people for national crimes, but that, in the
meantime, it was none of my business&mdash;that it was true Friday
might justify it, because he was a declared enemy and in a state of
war with those very particular people, and it was lawful for him to
attack them&mdash;but I could not say the same with regard to
myself. These things were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all
the way as I went, that I resolved I would only go and place myself
near them that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that I
would act then as God should direct; but that unless something
offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not
meddle with them.</p>

<p>With this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all possible
wariness and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched
till I came to the skirts of the wood on the side which was next to
them, only that one corner of the wood lay between me and them.
Here I called softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree which
was just at the corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and
bring me word if he could see there plainly what they were doing.
He did so, and came immediately back to me, and told me they might
be plainly viewed there&mdash;that they were all about their fire,
eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay
bound upon the sand a little from them, whom he said they would
kill next; and this fired the very soul within me. He told me it
was not one of their nation, but one of the bearded men he had told
me of, that came to their country in the boat. I was filled with
horror at the very naming of the white bearded man; and going to
the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man, who lay upon the
beach of the sea with his hands and his feet tied with flags, or
things like rushes, and that he was an European, and had clothes
on.</p>

<p>There was another tree and a little thicket beyond it, about
fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by
going a little way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and
that then I should be within half a shot of them; so I withheld my
passion, though I was indeed enraged to the highest degree; and
going back about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which held
all the way till I came to the other tree, and then came to a
little rising ground, which gave me a full view of them at the
distance of about eighty yards.</p>

<p>I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful
wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had
just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring
him perhaps limb by limb to their fire, and they were stooping down
to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Friday. "Now, Friday,"
said I, "do as I bid thee." Friday said he would. "Then, Friday,"
says I, "do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing." So I set
down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon the ground, and
Friday did the like by his, and with the other musket I took my aim
at the savages, bidding him to do the like; then asking him if he
was ready, he said, "Yes." "Then fire at them," said I; and at the
same moment I fired also.</p>

<p>Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that
he shot he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my
side I killed one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in
a dreadful consternation: and all of them that were not hurt jumped
upon their feet, but did not immediately know which way to run, or
which way to look, for they knew not from whence their destruction
came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him,
he might observe what I did; so, as soon as the first shot was
made, I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and
Friday did the like; he saw me cock and present; he did the same
again. "Are you ready, Friday?" said I. "Yes," says he. "Let fly,
then," says I, "in the name of God!" and with that I fired again
among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as our pieces
were now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small
pistol-bullets, we found only two drop; but so many were wounded
that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all
bloody, and most of them miserably wounded; whereof three more fell
quickly after, though not quite dead.</p>

<p>"Now, Friday," says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and
taking up the musket which was yet loaded, "follow me," which he
did with a great deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the
wood and showed myself, and Friday close at my foot. As soon as I
perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could, and bade
Friday do so too, and running as fast as I could, which, by the
way, was not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made
directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon
the beach or shore, between the place where they sat and the sea.
The two butchers who were just going to work with him had left him
at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to
the seaside, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the
rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him step
forwards and fire at them; he understood me immediately, and
running about forty yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them; and
I thought he had killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap
into the boat, though I saw two of them up again quickly; however,
he killed two of them, and wounded the third, so that he lay down
in the bottom of the boat as if he had been dead.</p>

<p>While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut
the flags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his hands and
feet, I lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue what
he was. He answered in Latin, Christianus; but was so weak and
faint that he could scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of
my pocket and gave it him, making signs that he should drink, which
he did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked
him what countryman he was: and he said, Espagniole; and being a
little recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could possibly
make, how much he was in my debt for his deliverance. "Seignior,"
said I, with as much Spanish as I could make up, "we will talk
afterwards, but we must fight now: if you have any strength left,
take this pistol and sword, and lay about you." He took them very
thankfully; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but, as if
they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers like a
fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the
truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor
creatures were so much frightened with the noise of our pieces that
they fell down for mere amazement and fear, and had no more power
to attempt their own escape than their flesh had to resist our
shot; and that was the case of those five that Friday shot at in
the boat; for as three of them fell with the hurt they received, so
the other two fell with the fright.</p>

<p>I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing
to keep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol
and sword: so I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree
from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay there that
had been discharged, which he did with great swiftness; and then
giving him my musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again,
and bade them come to me when they wanted. While I was loading
these pieces, there happened a fierce engagement between the
Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him with one of their
great wooden swords, the weapon that was to have killed him before,
if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold and brave
as could be imagined, though weak, had fought the Indian a good
while, and had cut two great wounds on his head; but the savage
being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him
down, being faint, and was wringing my sword out of his hand; when
the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting the sword, drew the
pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the body, and
killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help him,
could come near him.</p>

<p>Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying
wretches, with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet: and with that
he despatched those three who as I said before, were wounded at
first, and fallen, and all the rest he could come up with: and the
Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one of the
fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the savages, and
wounded them both; but as he was not able to run, they both got
from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one
of them, but the other was too nimble for him; and though he was
wounded, yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam with all
his might off to those two who were left in the canoe; which three
in the canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not whether he died or
no, were all that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty. The account
of the whole is as follows: Three killed at our first shot from the
tree; two killed at the next shot; two killed by Friday in the
boat; two killed by Friday of those at first wounded; one killed by
Friday in the wood; three killed by the Spaniard; four killed,
being found dropped here and there, of the wounds, or killed by
Friday in his chase of them; four escaped in the boat, whereof one
wounded, if not dead&mdash;twenty-one in all.</p>

<p>Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-shot,
and though Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find
that he hit any of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of
their canoes, and pursue them; and indeed I was very anxious about
their escape, lest, carrying the news home to their people, they
should come back perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes
and devour us by mere multitude; so I consented to pursue them by
sea, and running to one of their canoes, I jumped in and bade
Friday follow me: but when I was in the canoe I was surprised to
find another poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot, as the
Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not
knowing what was the matter; for he had not been able to look up
over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard neck and heels, and
had been tied so long that he had really but little life in
him.</p>

<p>I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes which they had
bound him with, and would have helped him up; but he could not
stand or speak, but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems,
still, that he was only unbound in order to be killed. When Friday
came to him I bade him speak to him, and tell him of his
deliverance; and pulling out my bottle, made him give the poor
wretch a dram, which, with the news of his being delivered, revived
him, and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him
speak, and look in his face, it would have moved any one to tears
to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him,
cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sang; then cried
again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head; and then sang
and jumped about again like a distracted creature. It was a good
while before I could make him speak to me or tell me what was the
matter; but when he came a little to himself he told me that it was
his father.</p>

<p>It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what
ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the
sight of his father, and of his being delivered from death; nor
indeed can I describe half the extravagances of his affection after
this: for he went into the boat and out of the boat a great many
times: when he went in to him he would sit down by him, open his
breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom for many
minutes together, to nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles,
which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed
them with his hands; and I, perceiving what the case was, gave him
some rum out of my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great
deal of good.</p>

<p>This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the
other savages, who were now almost out of sight; and it was happy
for us that we did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after,
and before they could be got a quarter of their way, and continued
blowing so hard all night, and that from the north-west, which was
against them, that I could not suppose their boat could live, or
that they ever reached their own coast.</p>

<p>But to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father that I
could not find in my heart to take him off for some time; but after
I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to me, and he
came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme: then
I asked him if he had given his father any bread. He shook his
head, and said, "None; ugly dog eat all up self." I then gave him a
cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried on purpose; I also
gave him a dram for himself; but he would not taste it, but carried
it to his father. I had in my pocket two or three bunches of
raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his father. He had no
sooner given his father these raisins but I saw him come out of the
boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched, for he was the
swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw: I say, he ran at such
a rate that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant; and
though I called, and hallooed out too after him, it was all
one&mdash;away he went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come
back again, though not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer I
found his pace slacker, because he had something in his hand. When
he came up to me I found he had been quite home for an earthen jug
or pot, to bring his father some fresh water, and that he had got
two more cakes or loaves of bread: the bread he gave me, but the
water he carried to his father; however, as I was very thirsty too,
I took a little of it. The water revived his father more than all
the rum or spirits I had given him, for he was fainting with
thirst.</p>

<p>When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there was
any water left. He said, "Yes"; and I bade him give it to the poor
Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father; and I sent
one of the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard too, who was
indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon a green place under
the shade of a tree; and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very
much swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I
saw that upon Friday's coming to him with the water he sat up and
drank, and took the bread and began to eat, I went to him and gave
him a handful of raisins. He looked up in my face with all the
tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any
countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted
himself in the fight, that he could not stand up upon his
feet&mdash;he tried to do it two or three times, but was really not
able, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to him; so I bade
him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them
with rum, as he had done his father's.</p>

<p>I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or
perhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his head about to see
if his father was in the same place and posture as he left him
sitting; and at last he found he was not to be seen; at which he
started up, and, without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness
to him that one could scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground
as he went; but when he came, he only found he had laid himself
down to ease his limbs, so Friday came back to me presently; and
then I spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up if he could,
and lead him to the boat, and then he should carry him to our
dwelling, where I would take care of him. But Friday, a lusty,
strong fellow, took the Spaniard upon his back, and carried him
away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the side or gunnel
of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then lifting
him quite in, he set him close to his father; and presently
stepping out again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the
shore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard
too; so he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving them
in the boat, ran away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me I
spoke to him, and asked him whither he went. He told me, "Go fetch
more boat;" so away he went like the wind, for sure never man or
horse ran like him; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost
as soon as I got to it by land; so he wafted me over, and then went
to help our new guests out of the boat, which he did; but they were
neither of them able to walk; so that poor Friday knew not what to
do.</p>

<p>To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to
Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon
made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried
them both up together upon it between us.</p>

<p>But when we got them to the outside of our wall, or
fortification, we were at a worse loss than before, for it was
impossible to get them over, and I was resolved not to break it
down; so I set to work again, and Friday and I, in about two hours'
time, made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above
that with boughs of trees, being in the space without our outward
fence and between that and the grove of young wood which I had
planted; and here we made them two beds of such things as I
had&mdash;viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it to
lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed.</p>

<p>My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in
subjects; and it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made,
how like a king I looked. First of all, the whole country was my
own property, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion.
Secondly, my people were perfectly subjected&mdash;I was absolutely
lord and lawgiver&mdash;they all owed their lives to me, and were
ready to lay down their lives, if there had been occasion for it,
for me. It was remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they
were of three different religions&mdash;my man Friday was a
Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard
was a Papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout
my dominions. But this is by the way.</p>

<p>As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners, and
given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think
of making some provision for them; and the first thing I did, I
ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat,
out of my particular flock, to be killed; when I cut off the
hinder-quarter, and chopping it into small pieces, I set Friday to
work to boiling and stewing, and made them a very good dish, I
assure you, of flesh and broth; and as I cooked it without doors,
for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I carried it all into
the new tent, and having set a table there for them, I sat down,
and ate my own dinner also with them, and, as well as I could,
cheered them and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter,
especially to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the
Spaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty well.</p>

<p>After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take
one of the canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms,
which, for want of time, we had left upon the place of battle; and
the next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the
savages, which lay open to the sun, and would presently be
offensive. I also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their
barbarous feast, which I could not think of doing myself; nay, I
could not bear to see them if I went that way; all which he
punctually performed, and effaced the very appearance of the
savages being there; so that when I went again, I could scarce know
where it was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to
the place.</p>

<p>I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new
subjects; and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he
thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we
might expect a return of them, with a power too great for us to
resist. His first opinion was, that the savages in the boat never
could live out the storm which blew that night they went off, but
must of necessity be drowned, or driven south to those other
shores, where they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be
drowned if they were cast away; but, as to what they would do if
they came safe on shore, he said he knew not; but it was his
opinion that they were so dreadfully frightened with the manner of
their being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he believed
they would tell the people they were all killed by thunder and
lightning, not by the hand of man; and that the two which
appeared&mdash;viz. Friday and I&mdash;were two heavenly spirits,
or furies, come down to destroy them, and not men with weapons.
This, he said, he knew; because he heard them all cry out so, in
their language, one to another; for it was impossible for them to
conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at
a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done now: and this
old savage was in the right; for, as I understood since, by other
hands, the savages never attempted to go over to the island
afterwards, they were so terrified with the accounts given by those
four men (for it seems they did escape the sea), that they believed
whoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed with fire
from the gods. This, however, I knew not; and therefore was under
continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my
guard, with all my army: for, as there were now four of us, I would
have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open field, at
any time.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;VISIT OF MUTINEERS</h3>

<p>In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of
their coming wore off; and I began to take my former thoughts of a
voyage to the main into consideration; being likewise assured by
Friday's father that I might depend upon good usage from their
nation, on his account, if I would go. But my thoughts were a
little suspended when I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard,
and when I understood that there were sixteen more of his
countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast away and made their
escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the
savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and, indeed,
for life. I asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and
found they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to
the Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which was
chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European goods
they could meet with there; that they had five Portuguese seamen on
board, whom they took out of another wreck; that five of their own
men were drowned when first the ship was lost, and that these
escaped through infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost
starved, on the cannibal coast, where they expected to have been
devoured every moment. He told me they had some arms with them, but
they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder nor
ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder but a
little, which they used at their first landing to provide
themselves with some food.</p>

<p>I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if
they had formed any design of making their escape. He said they had
many consultations about it; but that having neither vessel nor
tools to build one, nor provisions of any kind, their councils
always ended in tears and despair. I asked him how he thought they
would receive a proposal from me, which might tend towards an
escape; and whether, if they were all here, it might not be done. I
told him with freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and
ill-usage of me, if I put my life in their hands; for that
gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of man, nor did men
always square their dealings by the obligations they had received
so much as they did by the advantages they expected. I told him it
would be very hard that I should be made the instrument of their
deliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their prisoner
in New Spain, where an Englishman was certain to be made a
sacrifice, what necessity or what accident soever brought him
thither; and that I had rather be delivered up to the savages, and
be devoured alive, than fall into the merciless claws of the
priests, and be carried into the Inquisition. I added that,
otherwise, I was persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with
so many hands, build a barque large enough to carry us all away,
either to the Brazils southward, or to the islands or Spanish coast
northward; but that if, in requital, they should, when I had put
weapons into their hands, carry me by force among their own people,
I might be ill-used for my kindness to them, and make my case worse
than it was before.</p>

<p>He answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness,
that their condition was so miserable, and that they were so
sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the thought of
using any man unkindly that should contribute to their deliverance;
and that, if I pleased, he would go to them with the old man, and
discourse with them about it, and return again and bring me their
answer; that he would make conditions with them upon their solemn
oath, that they should be absolutely under my direction as their
commander and captain; and they should swear upon the holy
sacraments and gospel to be true to me, and go to such Christian
country as I should agree to, and no other; and to be directed
wholly and absolutely by my orders till they were landed safely in
such country as I intended, and that he would bring a contract from
them, under their hands, for that purpose. Then he told me he would
first swear to me himself that he would never stir from me as long
as he lived till I gave him orders; and that he would take my side
to the last drop of his blood, if there should happen the least
breach of faith among his countrymen. He told me they were all of
them very civil, honest men, and they were under the greatest
distress imaginable, having neither weapons nor clothes, nor any
food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages; out of all
hopes of ever returning to their own country; and that he was sure,
if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die by
me.</p>

<p>Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if
possible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them
to treat. But when we had got all things in readiness to go, the
Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so much prudence
in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I
could not but be very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put
off the deliverance of his comrades for at least half a year. The
case was thus: he had been with us now about a month, during which
time I had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the
assistance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently what
stock of corn and rice I had laid up; which, though it was more
than sufficient for myself, yet it was not sufficient, without good
husbandry, for my family, now it was increased to four; but much
less would it be sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as he
said, sixteen, still alive, should come over; and least of all
would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build
one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America; so
he told me he thought it would be more advisable to let him and the
other two dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I could
spare seed to sow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we
might have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should
come; for want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to
think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty
into another. "You know," says he, "the children of Israel, though
they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet
rebelled even against God Himself, that delivered them, when they
came to want bread in the wilderness."</p>

<p>His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I
could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I
was satisfied with his fidelity; so we fell to digging, all four of
us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted;
and in about a month's time, by the end of which it was seed-time,
we had got as much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed
two-and-twenty bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice,
which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare: indeed, we left
ourselves barely sufficient, for our own food for the six months
that we had to expect our crop; that is to say reckoning from the
time we set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed
it is six months in the ground in that country.</p>

<p>Having now society enough, and our numbers being sufficient to
put us out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their
number had been very great, we went freely all over the island,
whenever we found occasion; and as we had our escape or deliverance
upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to have the
means of it out of mine. For this purpose I marked out several
trees, which I thought fit for our work, and I set Friday and his
father to cut them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I
imparted my thoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct their
work. I showed them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a
large tree into single planks, and I caused them to do the like,
till they made about a dozen large planks, of good oak, near two
feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four
inches thick: what prodigious labour it took up any one may
imagine.</p>

<p>At the same time I contrived to increase my little flock of tame
goats as much as I could; and for this purpose I made Friday and
the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with Friday the next day
(for we took our turns), and by this means we got about twenty
young kids to breed up with the rest; for whenever we shot the dam,
we saved the kids, and added them to our flock. But above all, the
season for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious
quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, I believe, had we been at
Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we could have
filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread, formed a
great part of our food&mdash;very good living too, I assure you,
for they are exceedingly nourishing.</p>

<p>It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not the
most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it
was enough to answer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley
we brought in and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty
bushels; and the like in proportion of the rice; which was store
enough for our food to the next harvest, though all the sixteen
Spaniards had been on shore with me; or, if we had been ready for a
voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our ship to have
carried us to any part of the world; that is to say, any part of
America. When we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn,
we fell to work to make more wicker-ware, viz. great baskets, in
which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at
this part, and often blamed me that I did not make some things for
defence of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it.</p>

<p>And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I
expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see
what he could do with those he had left behind him there. I gave
him a strict charge not to bring any man who would not first swear
in the presence of himself and the old savage that he would in no
way injure, fight with, or attack the person he should find in the
island, who was so kind as to send for them in order to their
deliverance; but that they would stand by him and defend him
against all such attempts, and wherever they went would be entirely
under and subjected to his command; and that this should be put in
writing, and signed in their hands. How they were to have done
this, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a question
which we never asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard and
the old savage, the father of Friday, went away in one of the
canoes which they might be said to have come in, or rather were
brought in, when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the
savages. I gave each of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and
about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be very
good husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon
urgent occasions.</p>

<p>This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me in
view of my deliverance for now twenty-seven years and some days. I
gave them provisions of bread and of dried grapes, sufficient for
themselves for many days, and sufficient for all the
Spaniards&mdash;for about eight days' time; and wishing them a good
voyage, I saw them go, agreeing with them about a signal they
should hang out at their return, by which I should know them again
when they came back, at a distance, before they came on shore. They
went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon was at full, by
my account in the month of October; but as for an exact reckoning
of days, after I had once lost it I could never recover it again;
nor had I kept even the number of years so punctually as to be sure
I was right; though, as it proved when I afterwards examined my
account, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.</p>

<p>It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a
strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has
not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my
hutch one morning, when my man Friday came running in to me, and
called aloud, "Master, master, they are come, they are come!" I
jumped up, and regardless of danger I went, as soon as I could get
my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the way, was by
this time grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of
danger I went without my arms, which was not my custom to do; but I
was surprised when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a
boat at about a league and a half distance, standing in for the
shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the
wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in: also I observed,
presently, that they did not come from that side which the shore
lay on, but from the southernmost end of the island. Upon this I
called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these were not the
people we looked for, and that we might not know yet whether they
were friends or enemies. In the next place I went in to fetch my
perspective glass to see what I could make of them; and having
taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I
used to do when I was apprehensive of anything, and to take my view
the plainer without being discovered. I had scarce set my foot upon
the hill when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at anchor, at
about two leagues and a half distance from me, SSE., but not above
a league and a half from the shore. By my observation it appeared
plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an
English long-boat.</p>

<p>I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of
seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned by
my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such as I cannot
describe; but yet I had some secret doubts hung about me&mdash;I
cannot tell from whence they came&mdash;bidding me keep upon my
guard. In the first place, it occurred to me to consider what
business an English ship could have in that part of the world,
since it was not the way to or from any part of the world where the
English had any traffic; and I knew there had been no storms to
drive them in there in distress; and that if they were really
English it was most probable that they were here upon no good
design; and that I had better continue as I was than fall into the
hands of thieves and murderers.</p>

<p>Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which
sometimes are given him when he may think there is no possibility
of its being real. That such hints and notices are given us I
believe few that have made any observation of things can deny; that
they are certain discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse
of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to
be to warn us of danger, why should we not suppose they are from
some friendly agent (whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate,
is not the question), and that they are given for our good?</p>

<p>The present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of
this reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret
admonition, come it from whence it will, I had been done
inevitably, and in a far worse condition than before, as you will
see presently. I had not kept myself long in this posture till I
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a creek to
thrust in at, for the convenience of landing; however, as they did
not come quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet where
I formerly landed my rafts, but ran their boat on shore upon the
beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very happy for me;
for otherwise they would have landed just at my door, as I may say,
and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have
plundered me of all I had. When they were on shore I was fully
satisfied they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two I
thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so; there were in all
eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed and, as I
thought, bound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped
on shore, they took those three out of the boat as prisoners: one
of the three I could perceive using the most passionate gestures of
entreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance;
the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes,
and appeared concerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the
first. I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what
the meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me in English, as
well as he could, "O master! you see English mans eat prisoner as
well as savage mans." "Why, Friday," says I, "do you think they are
going to eat them, then?" "Yes," says Friday, "they will eat them."
"No no," says I, "Friday; I am afraid they will murder them,
indeed; but you may be sure they will not eat them."</p>

<p>All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was,
but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every
moment when the three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw
one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the
seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of the poor men; and I
expected to see him fall every moment; at which all the blood in my
body seemed to run chill in my veins. I wished heartily now for the
Spaniard, and the savage that had gone with him, or that I had any
way to have come undiscovered within shot of them, that I might
have secured the three men, for I saw no firearms they had among
them; but it fell out to my mind another way. After I had observed
the outrageous usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, I
observed the fellows run scattering about the island, as if they
wanted to see the country. I observed that the three other men had
liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat down all three
upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in despair. This
put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore, and began to
look about me; how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly I looked
round me; what dreadful apprehensions I had; and how I lodged in
the tree all night for fear of being devoured by wild beasts. As I
knew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive by the
providential driving of the ship nearer the land by the storms and
tide, by which I have since been so long nourished and supported;
so these three poor desolate men knew nothing how certain of
deliverance and supply they were, how near it was to them, and how
effectually and really they were in a condition of safety, at the
same time that they thought themselves lost and their case
desperate. So little do we see before us in the world, and so much
reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the
world, that He does not leave His creatures so absolutely
destitute, but that in the worst circumstances they have always
something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer deliverance
than they imagine; nay, are even brought to their deliverance by
the means by which they seem to be brought to their
destruction.</p>

<p>It was just at high-water when these people came on shore; and
while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in,
they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the water
was ebbed considerably away, leaving their boat aground. They had
left two men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drunk
a little too much brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking
a little sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast
aground for him to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who were
straggling about: upon which they all soon came to the boat: but it
was past all their strength to launch her, the boat being very
heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost
like a quicksand. In this condition, like true seamen, who are,
perhaps, the least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave
it over, and away they strolled about the country again; and I
heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them off from the
boat, "Why, let her alone, Jack, can't you? she'll float next
tide;" by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what
countrymen they were. All this while I kept myself very close, not
once daring to stir out of my castle any farther than to my place
of observation near the top of the hill: and very glad I was to
think how well it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten
hours before the boat could float again, and by that time it would
be dark, and I might be at more liberty to see their motions, and
to hear their discourse, if they had any. In the meantime I fitted
myself up for a battle as before, though with more caution, knowing
I had to do with another kind of enemy than I had at first. I
ordered Friday also, whom I had made an excellent marksman with his
gun, to load himself with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces,
and I gave him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce; I
had my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have
mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a
gun upon each shoulder.</p>

<p>It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt
till it was dark; but about two o'clock, being the heat of the day,
I found that they were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as
I thought, laid down to sleep. The three poor distressed men, too
anxious for their condition to get any sleep, had, however, sat
down under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a
mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn
something of their condition; immediately I marched as above, my
man Friday at a good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms
as I, but not making quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I
did. I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before
any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, "What are
ye, gentlemen?" They started up at the noise, but were ten times
more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure that I
made. They made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them
just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English.
"Gentlemen," said I, "do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may
have a friend near when you did not expect it." "He must be sent
directly from heaven then," said one of them very gravely to me,
and pulling off his hat at the same time to me; "for our condition
is past the help of man." "All help is from heaven, sir," said I,
"but can you put a stranger in the way to help you? for you seem to
be in some great distress. I saw you when you landed; and when you
seemed to make application to the brutes that came with you, I saw
one of them lift up his sword to kill you."</p>

<p>The poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling,
looking like one astonished, returned, "Am I talking to God or man?
Is it a real man or an angel?" "Be in no fear about that, sir,"
said I; "if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would have
come better clothed, and armed after another manner than you see
me; pray lay aside your fears; I am a man, an Englishman, and
disposed to assist you; you see I have one servant only; we have
arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can we serve you? What is your
case?" "Our case, sir," said he, "is too long to tell you while our
murderers are so near us; but, in short, sir, I was commander of
that ship&mdash;my men have mutinied against me; they have been
hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last, have set me on
shore in this desolate place, with these two men with me&mdash;one
my mate, the other a passenger&mdash;where we expected to perish,
believing the place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to
think of it." "Where are these brutes, your enemies?" said I; "do
you know where they are gone? There they lie, sir," said he,
pointing to a thicket of trees; "my heart trembles for fear they
have seen us and heard you speak; if they have, they will certainly
murder us all." "Have they any firearms?" said I. He answered,
"They had only two pieces, one of which they left in the boat."
"Well, then," said I, "leave the rest to me; I see they are all
asleep; it is an easy thing to kill them all; but shall we rather
take them prisoners?" He told me there were two desperate villains
among them that it was scarce safe to show any mercy to; but if
they were secured, he believed all the rest would return to their
duty. I asked him which they were. He told me he could not at that
distance distinguish them, but he would obey my orders in anything
I would direct. "Well," says I, "let us retreat out of their view
or hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further." So they
willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us from
them.</p>

<p>"Look you, sir," said I, "if I venture upon your deliverance,
are you willing to make two conditions with me?" He anticipated my
proposals by telling me that both he and the ship, if recovered,
should be wholly directed and commanded by me in everything; and if
the ship was not recovered, he would live and die with me in what
part of the world soever I would send him; and the two other men
said the same. "Well," says I, "my conditions are but two; first,
that while you stay in this island with me, you will not pretend to
any authority here; and if I put arms in your hands, you will, upon
all occasions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or
mine upon this island, and in the meantime be governed by my
orders; secondly, that if the ship is or may be recovered, you will
carry me and my man to England passage free."</p>

<p>He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man
could devise that he would comply with these most reasonable
demands, and besides would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it
upon all occasions as long as he lived. "Well, then," said I, "here
are three muskets for you, with powder and ball; tell me next what
you think is proper to be done." He showed all the testimonies of
his gratitude that he was able, but offered to be wholly guided by
me. I told him I thought it was very hard venturing anything; but
the best method I could think of was to fire on them at once as
they lay, and if any were not killed at the first volley, and
offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly upon
God's providence to direct the shot. He said, very modestly, that
he was loath to kill them if he could help it; but that those two
were incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all the
mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still,
for they would go on board and bring the whole ship's company, and
destroy us all. "Well, then," says I, "necessity legitimates my
advice, for it is the only way to save our lives." However, seeing
him still cautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go
themselves, and manage as they found convenient.</p>

<p>In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and
soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either
of them were the heads of the mutiny? He said, "No." "Well, then,"
said I, "you may let them escape; and Providence seems to have
awakened them on purpose to save themselves. Now," says I, "if the
rest escape you, it is your fault." Animated with this, he took the
musket I had given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and
his two comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand; the two
men who were with him going first made some noise, at which one of
the seamen who was awake turned about, and seeing them coming,
cried out to the rest; but was too late then, for the moment he
cried out they fired&mdash;I mean the two men, the captain wisely
reserving his own piece. They had so well aimed their shot at the
men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and the
other very much wounded; but not being dead, he started up on his
feet, and called eagerly for help to the other; but the captain
stepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he
should call upon God to forgive his villainy, and with that word
knocked him down with the stock of his musket, so that he never
spoke more; there were three more in the company, and one of them
was slightly wounded. By this time I was come; and when they saw
their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for
mercy. The captain told them he would spare their lives if they
would give him an assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery
they had been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him in
recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to
Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him all the protestations
of their sincerity that could be desired; and he was willing to
believe them, and spare their lives, which I was not against, only
that I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while they were
on the island.</p>

<p>While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate to
the boat with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and
sails, which they did; and by-and-by three straggling men, that
were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came back upon
hearing the guns fired; and seeing the captain, who was before
their prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to be bound
also; and so our victory was complete.</p>

<p>It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one
another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole
history, which he heard with an attention even to
amazement&mdash;and particularly at the wonderful manner of my
being furnished with provisions and ammunition; and, indeed, as my
story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply. But
when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to
have been preserved there on purpose to save his life, the tears
ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more. After this
communication was at an end, I carried him and his two men into my
apartment, leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the top
of the house, where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had,
and showed them all the contrivances I had made during my long,
long inhabiting that place.</p>

<p>All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing;
but above all, the captain admired my fortification, and how
perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which
having been now planted nearly twenty years, and the trees growing
much faster than in England, was become a little wood, so thick
that it was impassable in any part of it but at that one side where
I had reserved my little winding passage into it. I told him this
was my castle and my residence, but that I had a seat in the
country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat upon
occasion, and I would show him that too another time; but at
present our business was to consider how to recover the ship. He
agreed with me as to that, but told me he was perfectly at a loss
what measures to take, for that there were still six-and-twenty
hands on board, who, having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by
which they had all forfeited their lives to the law, would be
hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on, knowing
that if they were subdued they would be brought to the gallows as
soon as they came to England, or to any of the English colonies,
and that, therefore, there would be no attacking them with so small
a number as we were.</p>

<p>I mused for some time on what he had said, and found it was a
very rational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be
resolved on speedily, as well to draw the men on board into some
snare for their surprise as to prevent their landing upon us, and
destroying us. Upon this, it presently occurred to me that in a
little while the ship's crew, wondering what was become of their
comrades and of the boat, would certainly come on shore in their
other boat to look for them, and that then, perhaps, they might
come armed, and be too strong for us: this he allowed to be
rational. Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do was to
stave the boat which lay upon the beach, so that they might not
carry her of, and taking everything out of her, leave her so far
useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly, we went on board,
took the arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever
else we found there&mdash;which was a bottle of brandy, and another
of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of
sugar in a piece of canvas (the sugar was five or six pounds): all
which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of
which I had had none left for many years.</p>

<p>When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast,
sail, and rudder of the boat were carried away before), we knocked
a great hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to
master us, yet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was
not much in my thoughts that we could be able to recover the ship;
but my view was, that if they went away without the boat, I did not
much question to make her again fit to carry as to the Leeward
Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way, for I
had them still in my thoughts.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;THE SHIP RECOVERED</h3>

<p>While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main
strength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high that the tide
would not float her off at high-water mark, and besides, had broke
a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were set
down musing what we should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and
make a waft with her ensign as a signal for the boat to come on
board&mdash;but no boat stirred; and they fired several times,
making other signals for the boat. At last, when all their signals
and firing proved fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir,
we saw them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat out and
row towards the shore; and we found, as they approached, that there
were no less than ten men in her, and that they had firearms with
them.</p>

<p>As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full
view of them as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces;
because the tide having set them a little to the east of the other
boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to the same place where
the other had landed, and where the boat lay; by this means, I say,
we had a full view of them, and the captain knew the persons and
characters of all the men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were
three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this
conspiracy by the rest, being over-powered and frightened; but that
as for the boatswain, who it seems was the chief officer among
them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the
ship's crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new
enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too
powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told him that men in our
circumstances were past the operation of fear; that seeing almost
every condition that could be was better than that which we were
supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether
death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him what
he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a
deliverance were not worth venturing for? "And where, sir," said I,
"is your belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your
life, which elevated you a little while ago? For my part," said I,
"there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it."
"What is that?" say he. "Why," said I, "it is, that as you say
there are three or four honest fellows among them which should be
spared, had they been all of the wicked part of the crew I should
have thought God's providence had singled them out to deliver them
into your hands; for depend upon it, every man that comes ashore is
our own, and shall die or live as they behave to us." As I spoke
this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found it
greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our business.</p>

<p>We had, upon the first appearance of the boat's coming from the
ship, considered of separating our prisoners; and we had, indeed,
secured them effectually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less
assured than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three
delivered men, to my cave, where they were remote enough, and out
of danger of being heard or discovered, or of finding their way out
of the woods if they could have delivered themselves. Here they
left them bound, but gave them provisions; and promised them, if
they continued there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day
or two; but that if they attempted their escape they should be put
to death without mercy. They promised faithfully to bear their
confinement with patience, and were very thankful that they had
such good usage as to have provisions and light left them; for
Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their
comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over them
at the entrance.</p>

<p>The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept
pinioned, indeed, because the captain was not able to trust them;
but the other two were taken into my service, upon the captain's
recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die
with us; so with them and the three honest men we were seven men,
well armed; and I made no doubt we should be able to deal well
enough with the ten that were coming, considering that the captain
had said there were three or four honest men among them also. As
soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay, they ran
their boat into the beach and came all on shore, hauling the boat
up after them, which I was glad to see, for I was afraid they would
rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance from the
shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should not be
able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did,
they ran all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were
under a great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that
was in her, and a great hole in her bottom. After they had mused a
while upon this, they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing
with all their might, to try if they could make their companions
hear; but all was to no purpose. Then they came all close in a
ring, and fired a volley of their small arms, which indeed we
heard, and the echoes made the woods ring. But it was all one;
those in the cave, we were sure, could not hear; and those in our
keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer
to them. They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, as
they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board again to
their ship, and let them know that the men were all murdered, and
the long-boat staved; accordingly, they immediately launched their
boat again, and got all of them on board.</p>

<p>The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this,
believing they would go on board the ship again and set sail,
giving their comrades over for lost, and so he should still lose
the ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered; but he
was quickly as much frightened the other way.</p>

<p>They had not been long put off with the boat, when we perceived
them all coming on shore again; but with this new measure in their
conduct, which it seems they consulted together upon, viz. to leave
three men in the boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into
the country to look for their fellows. This was a great
disappointment to us, for now we were at a loss what to do, as our
seizing those seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if we
let the boat escape; because they would row away to the ship, and
then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail, and so
our recovering the ship would be lost. However we had no remedy but
to wait and see what the issue of things might present. The seven
men came on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put her
off to a good distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to
wait for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at them in
the boat. Those that came on shore kept close together, marching
towards the top of the little hill under which my habitation lay;
and we could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us.
We should have been very glad if they would have come nearer us, so
that we might have fired at them, or that they would have gone
farther off, that we might come abroad. But when they were come to
the brow of the hill where they could see a great way into the
valleys and woods, which lay towards the north-east part, and where
the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they were
weary; and not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor
far from one another, they sat down together under a tree to
consider it. Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as
the other part of them had done, they had done the job for us; but
they were too full of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to
sleep, though they could not tell what the danger was they had to
fear.</p>

<p>The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this
consultation of theirs, viz. that perhaps they would all fire a
volley again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we
should all sally upon them just at the juncture when their pieces
were all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we should
have them without bloodshed. I liked this proposal, provided it was
done while we were near enough to come up to them before they could
load their pieces again. But this event did not happen; and we lay
still a long time, very irresolute what course to take. At length I
told them there would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night;
and then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find
a way to get between them and the shore, and so might use some
stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore. We waited a
great while, though very impatient for their removing; and were
very uneasy when, after long consultation, we saw them all start up
and march down towards the sea; it seems they had such dreadful
apprehensions of the danger of the place that they resolved to go
on board the ship again, give their companions over for lost, and
so go on with their intended voyage with the ship.</p>

<p>As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it
to be as it really was that they had given over their search, and
were going back again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my
thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it; but I
presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back again, and
which answered my end to a tittle. I ordered Friday and the
captain's mate to go over the little creek westward, towards the
place where the savages came on shore, when Friday was rescued, and
so soon as they came to a little rising round, at about half a mile
distant, I bid them halloo out, as loud as they could, and wait
till they found the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they
heard the seamen answer them, they should return it again; and
then, keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the
others hallooed, to draw them as far into the island and among the
woods as possible, and then wheel about again to me by such ways as
I directed them.</p>

<p>They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate
hallooed; and they presently heard them, and answering, ran along
the shore westward, towards the voice they heard, when they were
stopped by the creek, where the water being up, they could not get
over, and called for the boat to come up and set them over; as,
indeed, I expected. When they had set themselves over, I observed
that the boat being gone a good way into the creek, and, as it
were, in a harbour within the land, they took one of the three men
out of her, to go along with them, and left only two in the boat,
having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore.
This was what I wished for; and immediately leaving Friday and the
captain's mate to their business, I took the rest with me; and,
crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men
before they were aware&mdash;one of them lying on the shore, and
the other being in the boat. The fellow on shore was between
sleeping and waking, and going to start up; the captain, who was
foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down; and then called
out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead man. They needed
very few arguments to persuade a single man to yield, when he saw
five men upon him and his comrade knocked down: besides, this was,
it seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as
the rest of the crew, and therefore was easily persuaded not only
to yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely with us. In the
meantime, Friday and the captain's mate so well managed their
business with the rest that they drew them, by hallooing and
answering, from one hill to another, and from one wood to another,
till they not only heartily tired them, but left them where they
were, very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it was
dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the
time they came back to us.</p>

<p>We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and
to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with them. It was
several hours after Friday came back to me before they came back to
their boat; and we could hear the foremost of them, long before
they came quite up, calling to those behind to come along; and
could also hear them answer, and complain how lame and tired they
were, and not able to come any faster: which was very welcome news
to us. At length they came up to the boat: but it is impossible to
express their confusion when they found the boat fast aground in
the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone. We could
hear them call one to another in a most lamentable manner, telling
one another they were got into an enchanted island; that either
there were inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered, or
else there were devils and spirits in it, and they should be all
carried away and devoured. They hallooed again, and called their
two comrades by their names a great many times; but no answer.
After some time we could see them, by the little light there was,
run about, wringing their hands like men in despair, and sometimes
they would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves: then
come ashore again, and walk about again, and so the same thing over
again. My men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon
them at once in the dark; but I was willing to take them at some
advantage, so as to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could;
and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing of any of our
men, knowing the others were very well armed. I resolved to wait,
to see if they did not separate; and therefore, to make sure of
them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the
captain to creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground
as they could, that they might not be discovered, and get as near
them as they could possibly before they offered to fire.</p>

<p>They had not been long in that posture when the boatswain, who
was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown
himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came
walking towards them, with two more of the crew; the captain was so
eager at having this principal rogue so much in his power, that he
could hardly have patience to let him come so near as to be sure of
him, for they only heard his tongue before: but when they came
nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly
at them. The boatswain was killed upon the spot: the next man was
shot in the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die till
an hour or two after; and the third ran for it. At the noise of the
fire I immediately advanced with my whole army, which was now eight
men, viz. myself, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-general; the
captain and his two men, and the three prisoners of war whom we had
trusted with arms. We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that
they could not see our number; and I made the man they had left in
the boat, who was now one of us, to call them by name, to try if I
could bring them to a parley, and so perhaps might reduce them to
terms; which fell out just as we desired: for indeed it was easy to
think, as their condition then was, they would be very willing to
capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could to one of them,
"Tom Smith! Tom Smith!" Tom Smith answered immediately, "Is that
Robinson?" for it seems he knew the voice. The other answered, "Ay,
ay; for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or
you are all dead men this moment." "Who must we yield to? Where are
they?" says Smith again. "Here they are," says he; "here's our
captain and fifty men with him, have been hunting you these two
hours; the boatswain is killed; Will Fry is wounded, and I am a
prisoner; and if you do not yield you are all lost." "Will they
give us quarter, then?" says Tom Smith, "and we will yield." "I'll
go and ask, if you promise to yield," said Robinson: so he asked
the captain, and the captain himself then calls out, "You, Smith,
you know my voice; if you lay down your arms immediately and
submit, you shall have your lives, all but Will Atkins."</p>

<p>Upon this Will Atkins cried out, "For God's sake, captain, give
me quarter; what have I done? They have all been as bad as I:"
which, by the way, was not true; for it seems this Will Atkins was
the first man that laid hold of the captain when they first
mutinied, and used him barbarously in tying his hands and giving
him injurious language. However, the captain told him he must lay
down his arms at discretion, and trust to the governor's mercy: by
which he meant me, for they all called me governor. In a word, they
all laid down their arms and begged their lives; and I sent the man
that had parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them all; and
then my great army of fifty men, which, with those three, were in
all but eight, came up and seized upon them, and upon their boat;
only that I kept myself and one more out of sight for reasons of
state.</p>

<p>Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the
ship: and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with
them, he expostulated with them upon the villainy of their
practices with him, and upon the further wickedness of their
design, and how certainly it must bring them to misery and distress
in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. They all appeared very
penitent, and begged hard for their lives. As for that, he told
them they were not his prisoners, but the commander's of the
island; that they thought they had set him on shore in a barren,
uninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to direct them that
it was inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman; that he
might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given them
all quarter, he supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt
with there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was
commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for that
he would be hanged in the morning.</p>

<p>Though this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its
desired effect; Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to
intercede with the governor for his life; and all the rest begged
of him, for God's sake, that they might not be sent to England.</p>

<p>It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come,
and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to
be hearty in getting possession of the ship; so I retired in the
dark from them, that they might not see what kind of a governor
they had, and called the captain to me; when I called, at a good
distance, one of the men was ordered to speak again, and say to the
captain, "Captain, the commander calls for you;" and presently the
captain replied, "Tell his excellency I am just coming." This more
perfectly amazed them, and they all believed that the commander was
just by, with his fifty men. Upon the captain coming to me, I told
him my project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonderfully
well, and resolved to put it in execution the next morning. But, in
order to execute it with more art, and to be secure of success, I
told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should go and
take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send them
pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This was committed to
Friday and the two men who came on shore with the captain. They
conveyed them to the cave as to a prison: and it was, indeed, a
dismal place, especially to men in their condition. The others I
ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I have given a full
description: and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place
was secure enough, considering they were upon their behaviour.</p>

<p>To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter
into a parley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me
whether he thought they might be trusted or not to go on board and
surprise the ship. He talked to them of the injury done him, of the
condition they were brought to, and that though the governor had
given them quarter for their lives as to the present action, yet
that if they were sent to England they would all be hanged in
chains; but that if they would join in so just an attempt as to
recover the ship, he would have the governor's engagement for their
pardon.</p>

<p>Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted
by men in their condition; they fell down on their knees to the
captain, and promised, with the deepest imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that they should owe
their lives to him, and would go with him all over the world; that
they would own him as a father to them as long as they lived.
"Well," says the captain, "I must go and tell the governor what you
say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it." So he
brought me an account of the temper he found them in, and that he
verily believed they would be faithful. However, that we might be
very secure, I told him he should go back again and choose out
those five, and tell them, that they might see he did not want men,
that he would take out those five to be his assistants, and that
the governor would keep the other two, and the three that were sent
prisoners to the castle (my cave), as hostages for the fidelity of
those five; and that if they proved unfaithful in the execution,
the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive on the shore.
This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor was in
earnest; however, they had no way left them but to accept it; and
it was now the business of the prisoners, as much as of the
captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty.</p>

<p>Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first, the
captain, his mate, and passenger; second, the two prisoners of the
first gang, to whom, having their character from the captain, I had
given their liberty, and trusted them with arms; third, the other
two that I had kept till now in my bower, pinioned, but on the
captain's motion had now released; fourth, these five released at
last; so that there were twelve in all, besides five we kept
prisoners in the cave for hostages.</p>

<p>I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these
hands on board the ship; but as for me and my man Friday, I did not
think it was proper for us to stir, having seven men left behind;
and it was employment enough for us to keep them asunder, and
supply them with victuals. As to the five in the cave, I resolved
to keep them fast, but Friday went in twice a day to them, to
supply them with necessaries; and I made the other two carry
provisions to a certain distance, where Friday was to take
them.</p>

<p>When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the
captain, who told them I was the person the governor had ordered to
look after them; and that it was the governor's pleasure they
should not stir anywhere but by my direction; that if they did,
they would be fetched into the castle, and be laid in irons: so
that as we never suffered them to see me as governor, I now
appeared as another person, and spoke of the governor, the
garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.</p>

<p>The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his
two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his
passenger captain of one, with four of the men; and himself, his
mate, and five more, went in the other; and they contrived their
business very well, for they came up to the ship about midnight. As
soon as they came within call of the ship, he made Robinson hail
them, and tell them they had brought off the men and the boat, but
that it was a long time before they had found them, and the like,
holding them in a chat till they came to the ship's side; when the
captain and the mate entering first with their arms, immediately
knocked down the second mate and carpenter with the butt-end of
their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men; they
secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter decks, and
began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down that were below;
when the other boat and their men, entering at the forechains,
secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle which went down
into the cook-room, making three men they found there prisoners.
When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the
mate, with three men, to break into the round-house, where the new
rebel captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up, and
with two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands; and when
the mate, with a crow, split open the door, the new captain and his
men fired boldly among them, and wounded the mate with a musket
ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but
killed nobody. The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into
the round-house, wounded as he was, and, with his pistol, shot the
new captain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and
came out again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a
word more: upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken
effectually, without any more lives lost.</p>

<p>As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven
guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give
me notice of his success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad
to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it till near two
o'clock in the morning. Having thus heard the signal plainly, I
laid me down; and it having been a day of great fatigue to me, I
slept very sound, till I was surprised with the noise of a gun; and
presently starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of
"Governor! Governor!" and presently I knew the captain's voice;
when, climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and,
pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms, "My dear friend
and deliverer," says he, "there's your ship; for she is all yours,
and so are we, and all that belong to her." I cast my eyes to the
ship, and there she rode, within little more than half a mile of
the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were
masters of her, and, the weather being fair, had brought her to an
anchor just against the mouth of the little creek; and the tide
being up, the captain had brought the pinnace in near the place
where I had first landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door. I
was at first ready to sink down with the surprise; for I saw my
deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy,
and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to
go. At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one word;
but as he had taken me in his arms I held fast by him, or I should
have fallen to the ground. He perceived the surprise, and
immediately pulled a bottle out of his pocket and gave me a dram of
cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me. After I had drunk
it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it brought me to myself,
yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to him. All
this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only not
under any surprise as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender
things to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but such was the
flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into
confusion: at last it broke out into tears, and in a little while
after I recovered my speech; I then took my turn, and embraced him
as my deliverer, and we rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon
him as a man sent by Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole
transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such things as
these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence
governing the world, and an evidence that the eye of an infinite
Power could search into the remotest corner of the world, and send
help to the miserable whenever He pleased. I forgot not to lift up
my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to
bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner provided for me
in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but from
whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed.</p>

<p>When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought
me some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as
the wretches that had been so long his masters had not plundered
him of. Upon this, he called aloud to the boat, and bade his men
bring the things ashore that were for the governor; and, indeed, it
was a present as if I had been one that was not to be carried away
with them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent
cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles held
two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good
pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of
peas, and about a hundred-weight of biscuit; he also brought me a
box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles
of lime-juice, and abundance of other things. But besides these,
and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me six
new clean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one
pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good
suit of clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little: in
a word, he clothed me from head to foot. It was a very kind and
agreeable present, as any one may imagine, to one in my
circumstances, but never was anything in the world of that kind so
unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was to me to wear such
clothes at first.</p>

<p>After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things
were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was
to be done with the prisoners we had; for it was worth considering
whether we might venture to take them with us or no, especially two
of them, whom he knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last
degree; and the captain said he knew they were such rogues that
there was no obliging them, and if he did carry them away, it must
be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the
first English colony he could come to; and I found that the captain
himself was very anxious about it. Upon this, I told him that, if
he desired it, I would undertake to bring the two men he spoke of
to make it their own request that he should leave them upon the
island. "I should be very glad of that," says the captain, "with
all my heart." "Well," says I, "I will send for them up and talk
with them for you." So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for
they were now discharged, their comrades having performed their
promise; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the
five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there
till I came. After some time, I came thither dressed in my new
habit; and now I was called governor again. Being all met, and the
captain with me, I caused the men to be brought before me, and I
told them I had got a full account of their villainous behaviour to
the captain, and how they had run away with the ship, and were
preparing to commit further robberies, but that Providence had
ensnared them in their own ways, and that they were fallen into the
pit which they had dug for others. I let them know that by my
direction the ship had been seized; that she lay now in the road;
and they might see by-and-by that their new captain had received
the reward of his villainy, and that they would see him hanging at
the yard-arm; that, as to them, I wanted to know what they had to
say why I should not execute them as pirates taken in the fact, as
by my commission they could not doubt but I had authority so to
do.</p>

<p>One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had
nothing to say but this, that when they were taken the captain
promised them their lives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I
told them I knew not what mercy to show them; for as for myself, I
had resolved to quit the island with all my men, and had taken
passage with the captain to go to England; and as for the captain,
he could not carry them to England other than as prisoners in
irons, to be tried for mutiny and running away with the ship; the
consequence of which, they must needs know, would be the gallows;
so that I could not tell what was best for them, unless they had a
mind to take their fate in the island. If they desired that, as I
had liberty to leave the island, I had some inclination to give
them their lives, if they thought they could shift on shore. They
seemed very thankful for it, and said they would much rather
venture to stay there than be carried to England to be hanged. So I
left it on that issue.</p>

<p>However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if
he durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a little angry
with the captain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not
his; and that seeing I had offered them so much favour, I would be
as good as my word; and that if he did not think fit to consent to
it I would set them at liberty, as I found them: and if he did not
like it he might take them again if he could catch them. Upon this
they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty,
and bade them retire into the woods, to the place whence they came,
and I would leave them some firearms, some ammunition, and some
directions how they should live very well if they thought fit. Upon
this I prepared to go on board the ship; but told the captain I
would stay that night to prepare my things, and desired him to go
on board in the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and send
the boat on shore next day for me; ordering him, at all events, to
cause the new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the
yard-arm, that these men might see him.</p>

<p>When the captain was gone I sent for the men up to me to my
apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them on their
circumstances. I told them I thought they had made a right choice;
that if the captain had carried them away they would certainly be
hanged. I showed them the new captain hanging at the yard-arm of
the ship, and told them they had nothing less to expect.</p>

<p>When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then
told them I would let them into the story of my living there, and
put them into the way of making it easy to them. Accordingly, I
gave them the whole history of the place, and of my coming to it;
showed them my fortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my
corn, cured my grapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to
make them easy. I told them the story also of the seventeen
Spaniards that were to be expected, for whom I left a letter, and
made them promise to treat them in common with themselves. Here it
may be noted that the captain, who had ink on board, was greatly
surprised that I never hit upon a way of making ink of charcoal and
water, or of something else, as I had done things much more
difficult.</p>

<p>I left them my firearms&mdash;viz. five muskets, three
fowling-pieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and a half
of powder left; for after the first year or two I used but little,
and wasted none. I gave them a description of the way I managed the
goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, and to make both
butter and cheese. In a word, I gave them every part of my own
story; and told them I should prevail with the captain to leave
them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden-seeds, which I
told them I would have been very glad of. Also, I gave them the bag
of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade them be
sure to sow and increase them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;RETURN TO ENGLAND</h3>

<p>Having done all this I left them the next day, and went on board
the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that
night. The next morning early, two of the five men came swimming to
the ship's side, and making the most lamentable complaint of the
other three, begged to be taken into the ship for God's sake, for
they should be murdered, and begged the captain to take them on
board, though he hanged them immediately. Upon this the captain
pretended to have no power without me; but after some difficulty,
and after their solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on
board, and were, some time after, soundly whipped and pickled;
after which they proved very honest and quiet fellows.</p>

<p>Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide
being up, with the things promised to the men; to which the
captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and clothes to be
added, which they took, and were very thankful for. I also
encouraged them, by telling them that if it lay in my power to send
any vessel to take them in, I would not forget them.</p>

<p>When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for
relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of
my parrots; also, I forgot not to take the money I formerly
mentioned, which had lain by me so long useless that it was grown
rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass for silver till it had
been a little rubbed and handled, as also the money I found in the
wreck of the Spanish ship. And thus I left the island, the 19th of
December, as I found by the ship's account, in the year 1686, after
I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two months, and nineteen
days; being delivered from this second captivity the same day of
the month that I first made my escape in the long-boat from among
the Moors of Sallee. In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived
in England the 11th of June, in the year 1687, having been
thirty-five years absent.</p>

<p>When I came to England I was as perfect a stranger to all the
world as if I had never been known there. My benefactor and
faithful steward, whom I had left my money in trust with, was
alive, but had had great misfortunes in the world; was become a
widow the second time, and very low in the world. I made her very
easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would give her no
trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude for her former care and
faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock would afford;
which at that time would, indeed, allow me to do but little for
her; but I assured her I would never forget her former kindness to
me; nor did I forget her when I had sufficient to help her, as
shall be observed in its proper place. I went down afterwards into
Yorkshire; but my father was dead, and my mother and all the family
extinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the children
of one of my brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for
dead, there had been no provision made for me; so that, in a word,
I found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little money
I had would not do much for me as to settling in the world.</p>

<p>I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I did not
expect; and this was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so
happily delivered, and by the same means saved the ship and cargo,
having given a very handsome account to the owners of the manner
how I had saved the lives of the men and the ship, they invited me
to meet them and some other merchants concerned, and all together
made me a very handsome compliment upon the subject, and a present
of almost &Acirc;&pound;200 sterling.</p>

<p>But after making several reflections upon the circumstances of
my life, and how little way this would go towards settling me in
the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come
at some information of the state of my plantation in the Brazils,
and of what was become of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose,
had some years past given me over for dead. With this view I took
shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April following, my man
Friday accompanying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and
proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions. When I came to
Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my particular satisfaction,
my old friend, the captain of the ship who first took me up at sea
off the shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and had left off
going to sea, having put his son, who was far from a young man,
into his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade. The old man did
not know me, and indeed I hardly knew him. But I soon brought him
to my remembrance, and as soon brought myself to his remembrance,
when I told him who I was.</p>

<p>After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance
between us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my
partner. The old man told me he had not been in the Brazils for
about nine years; but that he could assure me that when he came
away my partner was living, but the trustees whom I had joined with
him to take cognisance of my part were both dead: that, however, he
believed I would have a very good account of the improvement of the
plantation; for that, upon the general belief of my being cast away
and drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the produce of
my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who had
appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, one-third to the
king, and two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be
expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of the
Indians to the Catholic faith: but that, if I appeared, or any one
for me, to claim the inheritance, it would be restored; only that
the improvement, or annual production, being distributed to
charitable uses, could not be restored: but he assured me that the
steward of the king's revenue from lands, and the providore, or
steward of the monastery, had taken great care all along that the
incumbent, that is to say my partner, gave every year a faithful
account of the produce, of which they had duly received my moiety.
I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had brought
the plantation, and whether he thought it might be worth looking
after; or whether, on my going thither, I should meet with any
obstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety. He told
me he could not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was
improved; but this he knew, that my partner was grown exceeding
rich upon the enjoying his part of it; and that, to the best of his
remembrance, he had heard that the king's third of my part, which
was, it seems, granted away to some other monastery or religious
house, amounted to above two hundred moidores a year: that as to my
being restored to a quiet possession of it, there was no question
to be made of that, my partner being alive to witness my title, and
my name being also enrolled in the register of the country; also he
told me that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair,
honest people, and very wealthy; and he believed I would not only
have their assistance for putting me in possession, but would find
a very considerable sum of money in their hands for my account,
being the produce of the farm while their fathers held the trust,
and before it was given up, as above; which, as he remembered, was
for about twelve years.</p>

<p>I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account,
and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the
trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had
made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain, my
universal heir, &amp; c.</p>

<p>He told me that was true; but that as there was no proof of my
being dead, he could not act as executor until some certain account
should come of my death; and, besides, he was not willing to
intermeddle with a thing so remote: that it was true he had
registered my will, and put in his claim; and could he have given
any account of my being dead or alive, he would have acted by
procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio (so they call the
sugar-house), and have given his son, who was now at the Brazils,
orders to do it. "But," says the old man, "I have one piece of news
to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the
rest; and that is, believing you were lost, and all the world
believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account
with me, in your name, for the first six or eight years' profits,
which I received. There being at that time great disbursements for
increasing the works, building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it
did not amount to near so much as afterwards it produced; however,"
says the old man, "I shall give you a true account of what I have
received in all, and how I have disposed of it."</p>

<p>After a few days' further conference with this ancient friend,
he brought me an account of the first six years' income of my
plantation, signed by my partner and the merchant-trustees, being
always delivered in goods, viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in
chests, besides rum, molasses, &amp; c., which is the consequence
of a sugar-work; and I found by this account, that every year the
income considerably increased; but, as above, the disbursements
being large, the sum at first was small: however, the old man let
me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores
of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar and fifteen double rolls of
tobacco, which were lost in his ship; he having been shipwrecked
coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my having the
place. The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes, and
how he had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his
losses, and buy him a share in a new ship. "However, my old
friend," says he, "you shall not want a supply in your necessity;
and as soon as my son returns you shall be fully satisfied." Upon
this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me one hundred and sixty
Portugal moidores in gold; and giving the writings of his title to
the ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he was
quarter-part owner, and his son another, he puts them both into my
hands for security of the rest.</p>

<p>I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor
man to be able to bear this; and remembering what he had done for
me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used
me on all occasions, and particularly how sincere a friend he was
now to me, I could hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to
me; therefore I asked him if his circumstances admitted him to
spare so much money at that time, and if it would not straiten him?
He told me he could not say but it might straiten him a little;
but, however, it was my money, and I might want it more than
he.</p>

<p>Everything the good man said was full of affection, and I could
hardly refrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took one
hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a
receipt for them: then I returned him the rest, and told him if
ever I had possession of the plantation I would return the other to
him also (as, indeed, I afterwards did); and that as to the bill of
sale of his part in his son's ship, I would not take it by any
means; but that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest enough
to pay me; and if I did not, but came to receive what he gave me
reason to expect, I would never have a penny more from him.</p>

<p>When this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me
into a method to make my claim to my plantation. I told him I
thought to go over to it myself. He said I might do so if I
pleased, but that if I did not, there were ways enough to secure my
right, and immediately to appropriate the profits to my use: and as
there were ships in the river of Lisbon just ready to go away to
Brazil, he made me enter my name in a public register, with his
affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was alive, and that I was
the same person who took up the land for the planting the said
plantation at first. This being regularly attested by a notary, and
a procuration affixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter of
his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place; and
then proposed my staying with him till an account came of the
return.</p>

<p>Never was anything more honourable than the proceedings upon
this procuration; for in less than seven months I received a large
packet from the survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose
account I went to sea, in which were the following, particular
letters and papers enclosed:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, there was the account-current of the produce of my farm
or plantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with
my old Portugal captain, being for six years; the balance appeared
to be one thousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in my
favour.</p>

<p>Secondly, there was the account of four years more, while they
kept the effects in their hands, before the government claimed the
administration, as being the effects of a person not to be found,
which they called civil death; and the balance of this, the value
of the plantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thousand four
hundred and forty-six crusadoes, being about three thousand two
hundred and forty moidores.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine's account, who had
received the profits for above fourteen years; but not being able
to account for what was disposed of by the hospital, very honestly
declared he had eight hundred and seventy-two moidores not
distributed, which he acknowledged to my account: as to the king's
part, that refunded nothing.</p>

<p>There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very
affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how the
estate was improved, and what it produced a year; with the
particulars of the number of squares, or acres that it contained,
how planted, how many slaves there were upon it: and making
two-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so many
<i>Ave Marias</i> to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive;
inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession of
my own, and in the meantime to give him orders to whom he should
deliver my effects if I did not come myself; concluding with a
hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his family; and sent
me as a present seven fine leopards' skins, which he had, it seems,
received from Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither,
and which, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He sent me
also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of
gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same fleet my
two merchant-trustees shipped me one thousand two hundred chests of
sugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole
account in gold.</p>

<p>I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was
better than the beginning. It is impossible to express the
flutterings of my very heart when I found all my wealth about me;
for as the Brazil ships come all in fleets, the same ships which
brought my letters brought my goods: and the effects were safe in
the river before the letters came to my hand. In a word, I turned
pale, and grew sick; and, had not the old man run and fetched me a
cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature,
and I had died upon the spot: nay, after that I continued very ill,
and was so some hours, till a physician being sent for, and
something of the real cause of my illness being known, he ordered
me to be let blood; after which I had relief, and grew well: but I
verily believe, if I had not been eased by a vent given in that
manner to the spirits, I should have died.</p>

<p>I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand pounds
sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in
the Brazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an
estate of lands in England: and, in a word, I was in a condition
which I scarce knew how to understand, or how to compose myself for
the enjoyment of it. The first thing I did was to recompense my
original benefactor, my good old captain, who had been first
charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in my beginning, and
honest to me at the end. I showed him all that was sent to me; I
told him that, next to the providence of Heaven, which disposed all
things, it was owing to him; and that it now lay on me to reward
him, which I would do a hundred-fold: so I first returned to him
the hundred moidores I had received of him; then I sent for a
notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge
from the four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had
acknowledged he owed me, in the fullest and firmest manner
possible. After which I caused a procuration to be drawn,
empowering him to be the receiver of the annual profits of my
plantation: and appointing my partner to account with him, and make
the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in my name; and by a
clause in the end, made a grant of one hundred moidores a year to
him during his life, out of the effects, and fifty moidores a year
to his son after him, for his life: and thus I requited my old
man.</p>

<p>I had now to consider which way to steer my course next, and
what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put into my
hands; and, indeed, I had more care upon my head now than I had in
my state of life in the island where I wanted nothing but what I
had, and had nothing but what I wanted; whereas I had now a great
charge upon me, and my business was how to secure it. I had not a
cave now to hide my money in, or a place where it might lie without
lock or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished before anybody would
meddle with it; on the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or
whom to trust with it. My old patron, the captain, indeed, was
honest, and that was the only refuge I had. In the next place, my
interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me thither; but now I
could not tell how to think of going thither till I had settled my
affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind me. At first
I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and
would be just to me; but then she was in years, and but poor, and,
for aught I knew, might be in debt: so that, in a word, I had no
way but to go back to England myself and take my effects with
me.</p>

<p>It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and,
therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his
satisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I began to
think of the poor widow, whose husband had been my first
benefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my faithful steward
and instructor. So, the first thing I did, I got a merchant in
Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London, not only to pay a
bill, but to go find her out, and carry her, in money, a hundred
pounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her
poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have a further
supply: at the same time I sent my two sisters in the country a
hundred pounds each, they being, though not in want, yet not in
very good circumstances; one having been married and left a widow;
and the other having a husband not so kind to her as he should be.
But among all my relations or acquaintances I could not yet pitch
upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock, that I might
go away to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me; and this
greatly perplexed me.</p>

<p>I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils and have settled
myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalised to the place; but
I had some little scruple in my mind about religion, which
insensibly drew me back. However, it was not religion that kept me
from going there for the present; and as I had made no scruple of
being openly of the religion of the country all the while I was
among them, so neither did I yet; only that, now and then, having
of late thought more of it than formerly, when I began to think of
living and dying among them, I began to regret having professed
myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the best religion to
die with.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me
from going to the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom
to leave my effects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to
England, where, if I arrived, I concluded that I should make some
acquaintance, or find some relations, that would be faithful to me;
and, accordingly, I prepared to go to England with all my
wealth.</p>

<p>In order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the
Brazil fleet being just going away) resolved to give answers
suitable to the just and faithful account of things I had from
thence; and, first, to the Prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter
full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer of the eight
hundred and seventy-two moidores which were undisposed of, which I
desired might be given, five hundred to the monastery, and three
hundred and seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should direct;
desiring the good padre's prayers for me, and the like. I wrote
next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the
acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for: as for
sending them any present, they were far above having any occasion
of it. Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in
the improving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the
stock of the works; giving him instructions for his future
government of my part, according to the powers I had left with my
old patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever became due to
me, till he should hear from me more particularly; assuring him
that it was my intention not only to come to him, but to settle
myself there for the remainder of my life. To this I added a very
handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife and two
daughters, for such the captain's son informed me he had; with two
pieces of fine English broadcloth, the best I could get in Lisbon,
five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good
value.</p>

<p>Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my
effects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was which
way to go to England: I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and
yet I had a strange aversion to go to England by the sea at that
time, and yet I could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty
increased upon me so much, that though I had once shipped my
baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and that not once
but two or three times.</p>

<p>It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might be
one of the reasons; but let no man slight the strong impulses of
his own thoughts in cases of such moment: two of the ships which I
had singled out to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than
any other, having put my things on board one of them, and in the
other having agreed with the captain; I say two of these ships
miscarried. One was taken by the Algerines, and the other was lost
on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned except three;
so that in either of those vessels I had been made miserable.</p>

<p>Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom
I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea,
but either to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of
Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe journey
by land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to
Madrid, and so all the way by land through France. In a word, I was
so prepossessed against my going by sea at all, except from Calais
to Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as
I was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by much the
pleasanter way: and to make it more so, my old captain brought an
English gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing
to travel with me; after which we picked up two more English
merchants also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going
to Paris only; so that in all there were six of us and five
servants; the two merchants and the two Portuguese, contenting
themselves with one servant between two, to save the charge; and as
for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant,
besides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of
supplying the place of a servant on the road.</p>

<p>In this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company being very
well mounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof they did me
the honour to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest
man, as because I had two servants, and, indeed, was the origin of
the whole journey.</p>

<p>As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall
trouble you now with none of my land journals; but some adventures
that happened to us in this tedious and difficult journey I must
not omit.</p>

<p>When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to Spain,
were willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and what
was worth observing; but it being the latter part of the summer, we
hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the middle of October;
but when we came to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at
several towns on the way, with an account that so much snow was
falling on the French side of the mountains, that several
travellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having
attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on.</p>

<p>When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed; and to
me, that had been always used to a hot climate, and to countries
where I could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was
insufferable; nor, indeed, was it more painful than surprising to
come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where the weather was
not only warm but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from the
Pyrenean Mountains so very keen, so severely cold, as to be
intolerable and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers
and toes.</p>

<p>Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all
covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen
or felt before in his life. To mend the matter, when we came to
Pampeluna it continued snowing with so much violence and so long,
that the people said winter was come before its time; and the
roads, which were difficult before, were now quite impassable; for,
in a word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel,
and being not hard frozen, as is the case in the northern
countries, there was no going without being in danger of being
buried alive every step. We stayed no less than twenty days at
Pampeluna; when (seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of
its being better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe
that had been known in the memory of man) I proposed that we should
go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux, which
was a very little voyage. But, while I was considering this, there
came in four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the
French side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out
a guide, who, traversing the country near the head of Languedoc,
had brought them over the mountains by such ways that they were not
much incommoded with the snow; for where they met with snow in any
quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and
their horses. We sent for this guide, who told us he would
undertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow,
provided we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild
beasts; for, he said, in these great snows it was frequent for some
wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being made
ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered with snow. We
told him we were well enough prepared for such creatures as they
were, if he would insure us from a kind of two-legged wolves, which
we were told we were in most danger from, especially on the French
side of the mountains. He satisfied us that there was no danger of
that kind in the way that we were to go; so we readily agreed to
follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen with their servants,
some French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and
were obliged to come back again.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide on the
15th of November; and indeed I was surprised when, instead of going
forward, he came directly back with us on the same road that we
came from Madrid, about twenty miles; when, having passed two
rivers, and come into the plain country, we found ourselves in a
warm climate again, where the country was pleasant, and no snow to
be seen; but, on a sudden, turning to his left, he approached the
mountains another way; and though it is true the hills and
precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such
meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly
passed the height of the mountains without being much encumbered
with the snow; and all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant and
fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all green and
flourishing, though at a great distance, and we had some rough way
to pass still.</p>

<p>We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one
whole day and a night so fast that we could not travel; but he bid
us be easy; we should soon be past it all: we found, indeed, that
we began to descend every day, and to come more north than before;
and so, depending upon our guide, we went on.</p>

<p>It was about two hours before night when, our guide being
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, from a hollow way
adjoining to a thick wood; two of the wolves made at the guide, and
had he been far before us, he would have been devoured before we
could have helped him; one of them fastened upon his horse, and the
other attacked the man with such violence, that he had not time, or
presence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried
out to us most lustily. My man Friday being next me, I bade him
ride up and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in
sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the other, "O master!
O master!" but like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor
man, and with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that attacked
him.</p>

<p>It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; for,
having been used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear
upon him, but went close up to him and shot him; whereas, any other
of us would have fired at a farther distance, and have perhaps
either missed the wolf or endangered shooting the man.</p>

<p>But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and,
indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of
Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the most dismal howling of
wolves; and the noise, redoubled by the echo of the mountains,
appeared to us as if there had been a prodigious number of them;
and perhaps there was not such a few as that we had no cause of
apprehension: however, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other
that had fastened upon the horse left him immediately, and fled,
without doing him any damage, having happily fastened upon his
head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth. But
the man was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him twice,
once in the arm, and the other time a little above his knee; and
though he had made some defence, he was just tumbling down by the
disorder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf.</p>

<p>It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we
all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very
difficult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter. As soon
as we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we saw
clearly what had been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the
poor guide, though we did not presently discern what kind of
creature it was he had killed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX&mdash;FIGHT BETWEEN FRIDAY AND A BEAR</h3>

<p>But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a
surprising manner as that which followed between Friday and the
bear, which gave us all, though at first we were surprised and
afraid for him, the greatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a
heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does, who
is swift and light, so he has two particular qualities, which
generally are the rule of his actions; first, as to men, who are
not his proper prey (he does not usually attempt them, except they
first attack him, unless he be excessively hungry, which it is
probable might now be the case, the ground being covered with
snow), if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle with you;
but then you must take care to be very civil to him, and give him
the road, for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step
out of his way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your
best way is to look another way and keep going on; for sometimes if
you stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it
for an affront; but if you throw or toss anything at him, though it
were but a bit of stick as big as your finger, he thinks himself
abused, and sets all other business aside to pursue his revenge,
and will have satisfaction in point of honour&mdash;that is his
first quality: the next is, if he be once affronted, he will never
leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge, but follows at a
good round rate till he overtakes you.</p>

<p>My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to
him he was helping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt and
frightened, when on a sudden we espied the bear come out of the
wood; and a monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I
saw. We were all a little surprised when we saw him; but when
Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's
countenance. "O! O! O!" says Friday, three times, pointing to him;
"O master, you give me te leave, me shakee te hand with him; me
makee you good laugh."</p>

<p>I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased. "You fool,"
says I, "he will eat you up."&mdash;"Eatee me up! eatee me up!"
says Friday, twice over again; "me eatee him up; me makee you good
laugh; you all stay here, me show you good laugh." So down he sits,
and gets off his boots in a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as
we call the flat shoes they wear, and which he had in his pocket),
gives my other servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew,
swift like the wind.</p>

<p>The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with
nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the
bear could understand him. "Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday, "me
speakee with you." We followed at a distance, for now being down on
the Gascony side of the mountains, we were entered a vast forest,
where the country was plain and pretty open, though it had many
trees in it scattered here and there. Friday, who had, as we say,
the heels of the bear, came up with him quickly, and took up a
great stone, and threw it at him, and hit him just on the head, but
did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall; but
it answered Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he
did it purely to make the bear follow him, and show us some laugh
as he called it. As soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he
turns about and comes after him, taking very long strides, and
shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would have put a horse to a
middling gallop; away reins Friday, and takes his course as if he
ran towards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon
the bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at him for
bringing the bear back upon us, when he was going about his own
business another way; and especially I was angry that he had turned
the bear upon us, and then ran away; and I called out, "You dog! is
this your making us laugh? Come away, and take your horse, that we
may shoot the creature." He heard me, and cried out, "No shoot, no
shoot; stand still, and you get much laugh:" and as the nimble
creature ran two feet for the bear's one, he turned on a sudden on
one side of us, and seeing a great oak-tree fit for his purpose, he
beckoned to us to follow; and doubling his pace, he got nimbly up
the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground, at about five or six
yards from the bottom of the tree. The bear soon came to the tree,
and we followed at a distance: the first thing he did he stopped at
the gun, smelt at it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the
tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed
at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not for my life
see anything to laugh at, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we
all rode near to him.</p>

<p>When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small
end of a large branch, and the bear got about half-way to him. As
soon as the bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree
was weaker, "Ha!" says he to us, "now you see me teachee the bear
dance:" so he began jumping and shaking the bough, at which the
bear began to totter, but stood still, and began to look behind
him, to see how he should get back; then, indeed, we did laugh
heartily. But Friday had not done with him by a great deal; when
seeing him stand still, he called out to him again, as if he had
supposed the bear could speak English, "What, you come no farther?
pray you come farther;" so he left jumping and shaking the tree;
and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come a
little farther; then he began jumping again, and the bear stopped
again. We thought now was a good time to knock him in the head, and
called to Friday to stand still and we should shoot the bear: but
he cried out earnestly, "Oh, pray! Oh, pray! no shoot, me shoot by
and then:" he would have said by-and-by. However, to shorten the
story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that
we had laughing enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow
would do: for first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear
off; and we found the bear was too cunning for that too; for he
would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with
his great broad claws and feet, so that we could not imagine what
would be the end of it, and what the jest would be at last. But
Friday put us out of doubt quickly: for seeing the bear cling fast
to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come any
farther, "Well, well," says Friday, "you no come farther, me go;
you no come to me, me come to you;" and upon this he went out to
the smaller end, where it would bend with his weight, and gently
let himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near
enough to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, took
it up, and stood still. "Well," said I to him, "Friday, what will
you do now? Why don't you shoot him?" "No shoot," says Friday, "no
yet; me shoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh:"
and, indeed, so he did; for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he
came back from the bough, where he stood, but did it very
cautiously, looking behind him every step, and coming backward till
he got into the body of the tree, then, with the same hinder end
foremost, he came down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and
moving one foot at a time, very leisurely. At this juncture, and
just before he could set his hind foot on the ground, Friday
stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his
ear, and shot him dead. Then the rogue turned about to see if we
did not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he
began to laugh very loud. "So we kill bear in my country," says
Friday. "So you kill them?" says I; "why, you have no
guns."&mdash;"No," says he, "no gun, but shoot great much long
arrow." This was a good diversion to us; but we were still in a
wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly
knew; the howling of wolves ran much in my head; and, indeed,
except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa, of which I
have said something already, I never heard anything that filled me
with so much horror.</p>

<p>These things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else,
as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the
skin of this monstrous creature off, which was worth saving; but we
had near three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we left
him, and went forward on our journey.</p>

<p>The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and
dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, as we
heard afterwards, were come down into the forest and plain country,
pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a great deal of
mischief in the villages, where they surprised the country people,
killed a great many of their sheep and horses, and some people too.
We had one dangerous place to pass, and our guide told us if there
were more wolves in the country we should find them there; and this
was a small plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and a long,
narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through the
wood, and then we should come to the village where we were to
lodge. It was within half-an-hour of sunset when we entered the
wood, and a little after sunset when we came into the plain: we met
with nothing in the first wood, except that in a little plain
within the wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw five
great wolves cross the road, full speed, one after another, as if
they had been in chase of some prey, and had it in view; they took
no notice of us, and were gone out of sight in a few moments. Upon
this, our guide, who, by the way, was but a fainthearted fellow,
bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed there were more
wolves a-coming. We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us; but
we saw no more wolves till we came through that wood, which was
near half a league, and entered the plain. As soon as we came into
the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us. The first
object we met with was a dead horse; that is to say, a poor horse
which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at work,
we could not say eating him, but picking his bones rather; for they
had eaten up all the flesh before. We did not think fit to disturb
them at their feast, neither did they take much notice of us.
Friday would have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him by
any means; for I found we were like to have more business upon our
hands than we were aware of. We had not gone half over the plain
when we began to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left in a
frightful manner, and presently after we saw about a hundred coming
on directly towards us, all in a body, and most of them in a line,
as regularly as an army drawn up by experienced officers. I scarce
knew in what manner to receive them, but found to draw ourselves in
a close line was the only way; so we formed in a moment; but that
we might not have too much interval, I ordered that only every
other man should fire, and that the others, who had not fired,
should stand ready to give them a second volley immediately, if
they continued to advance upon us; and then that those that had
fired at first should not pretend to load their fusees again, but
stand ready, every one with a pistol, for we were all armed with a
fusee and a pair of pistols each man; so we were, by this method,
able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time; however, at present
we had no necessity; for upon firing the first volley, the enemy
made a full stop, being terrified as well with the noise as with
the fire. Four of them being shot in the head, dropped; several
others were wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the
snow. I found they stopped, but did not immediately retreat;
whereupon, remembering that I had been told that the fiercest
creatures were terrified at the voice of a man, I caused all the
company to halloo as loud as they could; and I found the notion not
altogether mistaken; for upon our shout they began to retire and
turn about. I then ordered a second volley to be fired in their
rear, which put them to the gallop, and away they went to the
woods. This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again; and that we
might lose no time, we kept going; but we had but little more than
loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness, when we heard a
terrible noise in the same wood on our left, only that it was
farther onward, the same way we were to go.</p>

<p>The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which
made it worse on our side; but the noise increasing, we could
easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those
hellish creatures; and on a sudden we perceived three troops of
wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and one in our front, so
that we seemed to be surrounded with them: however, as they did not
fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as we could make our
horses go, which, the way being very rough, was only a good hard
trot. In this manner, we came in view of the entrance of a wood,
through which we were to pass, at the farther side of the plain;
but we were greatly surprised, when coming nearer the lane or pass,
we saw a confused number of wolves standing just at the entrance.
On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the noise of
a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and
a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen
wolves after him, full speed: the horse had the advantage of them;
but as we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we
doubted not but they would get up with him at last: no question but
they did.</p>

<p>But here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcasses of
another horse and of two men, devoured by the ravenous creatures;
and one of the men was no doubt the same whom we heard fire the
gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as to the man,
his head and the upper part of his body was eaten up. This filled
us with horror, and we knew not what course to take; but the
creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about us presently,
in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were three hundred of
them. It happened, very much to our advantage, that at the entrance
into the wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large
timber-trees, which had been cut down the summer before, and I
suppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little troop in among
those trees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree,
I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree before us for a
breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our
horses in the centre. We did so, and it was well we did; for never
was a more furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this
place. They came on with a growling kind of noise, and mounted the
piece of timber, which, as I said, was our breastwork, as if they
were only rushing upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it
seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind
us. I ordered our men to fire as before, every other man; and they
took their aim so sure that they killed several of the wolves at
the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a continual
firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on those
before.</p>

<p>When we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought they
stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but it was
but a moment, for others came forward again; so we fired two
volleys of our pistols; and I believe in these four firings we had
killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many, yet
they came on again. I was loth to spend our shot too hastily; so I
called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was better employed,
for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had charged my
fusee and his own while we were engaged&mdash;but, as I said, I
called my other man, and giving him a horn of powder, I had him lay
a train all along the piece of timber, and let it be a large train.
He did so, and had but just time to get away, when the wolves came
up to it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an unchanged
pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; those that were upon
the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell; or
rather jumped in among us with the force and fright of the fire; we
despatched these in an instant, and the rest were so frightened
with the light, which the night&mdash;for it was now very near
dark&mdash;made more terrible that they drew back a little; upon
which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one volley, and
after that we gave a shout; upon this the wolves turned tail, and
we sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones that we found
struggling on the ground, and fell to cutting them with our swords,
which answered our expectation, for the crying and howling they
made was better understood by their fellows; so that they all fled
and left us.</p>

<p>We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them, and had
it been daylight we had killed many more. The field of battle being
thus cleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a league
to go. We heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods
as we went several times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of
them; but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain. In about
an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge, which we
found in a terrible fright and all in arms; for, it seems, the
night before the wolves and some bears had broken into the village,
and put them in such terror that they were obliged to keep guard
night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve their
cattle, and indeed their people.</p>

<p>The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so
much with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no
farther; so we were obliged to take a new guide here, and go to
Toulouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant
country, and no snow, no wolves, nor anything like them; but when
we told our story at Toulouse, they told us it was nothing but what
was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mountains,
especially when the snow lay on the ground; but they inquired much
what kind of guide we had got who would venture to bring us that
way in such a severe season, and told us it was surprising we were
not all devoured. When we told them how we placed ourselves and the
horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it
was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed, for it was the
sight of the horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their
prey, and that at other times they are really afraid of a gun; but
being excessively hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness
to come at the horses had made them senseless of danger, and that
if we had not by the continual fire, and at last by the stratagem
of the train of powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but
that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content to
have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not
have taken the horses so much for their own, when men were on their
backs, as otherwise; and withal, they told us that at last, if we
had stood altogether, and left our horses, they would have been so
eager to have devoured them, that we might have come off safe,
especially having our firearms in our hands, being so many in
number. For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life;
for, seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and
open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us or
retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it was, I believe
I shall never care to cross those mountains again: I think I would
much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was sure to meet
with a storm once a-week.</p>

<p>I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through
France&mdash;nothing but what other travellers have given an
account of with much more advantage than I can. I travelled from
Toulouse to Paris, and without any considerable stay came to
Calais, and landed safe at Dover the 14th of January, after having
had a severe cold season to travel in.</p>

<p>I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little
time all my new-discovered estate safe about me, the bills of
exchange which I brought with me having been currently paid.</p>

<p>My principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good ancient
widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no
pains too much nor care too great to employ for me; and I trusted
her so entirely that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my
effects; and, indeed, I was very happy from the beginning, and now
to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this good
gentlewoman.</p>

<p>And now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the
Brazils, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who, having offered it
to the two merchants, the survivors of my trustees, who lived in
the Brazils, they accepted the offer, and remitted thirty-three
thousand pieces of eight to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to
pay for it.</p>

<p>In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which
they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the
bills of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of
eight for the estate, reserving the payment of one hundred moidores
a year to him (the old man) during his life, and fifty moidores
afterwards to his son for his life, which I had promised them, and
which the plantation was to make good as a rent-charge. And thus I
have given the first part of a life of fortune and
adventure&mdash;a life of Providence's chequer-work, and of a
variety which the world will seldom be able to show the like of;
beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any part of
it ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.</p>

<p>Any one would think that in this state of complicated good
fortune I was past running any more hazards&mdash;and so, indeed, I
had been, if other circumstances had concurred; but I was inured to
a wandering life, had no family, nor many relations; nor, however
rich, had I contracted fresh acquaintance; and though I had sold my
estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep that country out of my
head, and had a great mind to be upon the wing again; especially I
could not resist the strong inclination I had to see my island, and
to know if the poor Spaniards were in being there. My true friend,
the widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so far prevailed
with me, that for almost seven years she prevented my running
abroad, during which time I took my two nephews, the children of
one of my brothers, into my care; the eldest, having something of
his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of
some addition to his estate after my decease. The other I placed
with the captain of a ship; and after five years, finding him a
sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good
ship, and sent him to sea; and this young fellow afterwards drew me
in, as old as I was, to further adventures myself.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I in part settled myself here; for, first of
all, I married, and that not either to my disadvantage or
dissatisfaction, and had three children, two sons and one daughter;
but my wife dying, and my nephew coming home with good success from
a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and his
importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to go in his ship as a
private trader to the East Indies; this was in the year 1694.</p>

<p>In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my
successors the Spaniards, had the old story of their lives and of
the villains I left there; how at first they insulted the poor
Spaniards, how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united,
separated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliged to use
violence with them; how they were subjected to the Spaniards, how
honestly the Spaniards used them&mdash;a history, if it were
entered into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my own
part&mdash;particularly, also, as to their battles with the
Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as to the
improvement they made upon the island itself, and how five of them
made an attempt upon the mainland, and brought away eleven men and
five women prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty
young children on the island.</p>

<p>Here I stayed about twenty days, left them supplies of all
necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes,
tools, and two workmen, which I had brought from England with me,
viz. a carpenter and a smith.</p>

<p>Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved
to myself the property of the whole, but gave them such parts
respectively as they agreed on; and having settled all things with
them, and engaged them not to leave the place, I left them
there.</p>

<p>From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a bark,
which I bought there, with more people to the island; and in it,
besides other supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I found
proper for service, or for wives to such as would take them. As to
the Englishmen, I promised to send them some women from England,
with a good cargo of necessaries, if they would apply themselves to
planting&mdash;which I afterwards could not perform. The fellows
proved very honest and diligent after they were mastered and had
their properties set apart for them. I sent them, also, from the
Brazils, five cows, three of them being big with calf, some sheep,
and some hogs, which when I came again were considerably
increased.</p>

<p>But all these things, with an account how three hundred
Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and
how they fought with that whole number twice, and were at first
defeated, and one of them killed; but at last, a storm destroying
their enemies' canoes, they famished or destroyed almost all the
rest, and renewed and recovered the possession of their plantation,
and still lived upon the island.</p>

<p>All these things, with some very surprising incidents in some
new adventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a
farther account of in the Second Part of my Story.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>The Further Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;REVISITS ISLAND</h3>

<p>That homely proverb, used on so many occasions in England, viz.
"That what is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh," was
never more verified than in the story of my Life. Any one would
think that after thirty-five years' affliction, and a variety of
unhappy circumstances, which few men, if any, ever went through
before, and after near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the
fulness of all things; grown old, and when, if ever, it might be
allowed me to have had experience of every state of middle life,
and to know which was most adapted to make a man completely happy;
I say, after all this, any one would have thought that the native
propensity to rambling which I gave an account of in my first
setting out in the world to have been so predominant in my
thoughts, should be worn out, and I might, at sixty one years of
age, have been a little inclined to stay at home, and have done
venturing life and fortune any more.</p>

<p>Nay, farther, the common motive of foreign adventures was taken
away in me, for I had no fortune to make; I had nothing to seek: if
I had gained ten thousand pounds I had been no richer; for I had
already sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave it to; and
what I had was visibly increasing; for, having no great family, I
could not spend the income of what I had unless I would set up for
an expensive way of living, such as a great family, servants,
equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were things I had no notion
of, or inclination to; so that I had nothing, indeed, to do but to
sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and see it increase
daily upon my hands. Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or
at least not enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go
abroad again, which hung about me like a chronic distemper. In
particular, the desire of seeing my new plantation in the island,
and the colony I left there, ran in my head continually. I dreamed
of it all night, and my imagination ran upon it all day: it was
uppermost in all my thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily and
strongly upon it that I talked of it in my sleep; in short, nothing
could remove it out of my mind: it even broke so violently into all
my discourses that it made my conversation tiresome, for I could
talk of nothing else; all my discourse ran into it, even to
impertinence; and I saw it myself.</p>

<p>I have often heard persons of good judgment say that all the
stir that people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions is
owing to the strength of imagination, and the powerful operation of
fancy in their minds; that there is no such thing as a spirit
appearing, or a ghost walking; that people's poring affectionately
upon the past conversation of their deceased friends so realises it
to them that they are capable of fancying, upon some extraordinary
circumstances, that they see them, talk to them, and are answered
by them, when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapour in
the thing, and they really know nothing of the matter.</p>

<p>For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are any such
things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of people after
they are dead; or whether there is anything in the stories they
tell us of that kind more than the product of vapours, sick minds,
and wandering fancies: but this I know, that my imagination worked
up to such a height, and brought me into such excess of vapours, or
what else I may call it, that I actually supposed myself often upon
the spot, at my old castle, behind the trees; saw my old Spaniard,
Friday's father, and the reprobate sailors I left upon the island;
nay, I fancied I talked with them, and looked at them steadily,
though I was broad awake, as at persons just before me; and this I
did till I often frightened myself with the images my fancy
represented to me. One time, in my sleep, I had the villainy of the
three pirate sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard,
and Friday's father, that it was surprising: they told me how they
barbarously attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that they
set fire to the provisions they had laid up, on purpose to distress
and starve them; things that I had never heard of, and that,
indeed, were never all of them true in fact: but it was so warm in
my imagination, and so realised to me, that, to the hour I saw
them, I could not be persuaded but that it was or would be true;
also how I resented it, when the Spaniard complained to me; and how
I brought them to justice, tried them, and ordered them all three
to be hanged. What there was really in this shall be seen in its
place; for however I came to form such things in my dream, and what
secret converse of spirits injected it, yet there was, I say, much
of it true. I own that this dream had nothing in it literally and
specifically true; but the general part was so true&mdash;the base;
villainous behaviour of these three hardened rogues was such, and
had been so much worse than all I can describe, that the dream had
too much similitude of the fact; and as I would afterwards have
punished them severely, so, if I had hanged them all, I had been
much in the right, and even should have been justified both by the
laws of God and man.</p>

<p>But to return to my story. In this kind of temper I lived some
years; I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours, no
agreeable diversion but what had something or other of this in it;
so that my wife, who saw my mind wholly bent upon it, told me very
seriously one night that she believed there was some secret,
powerful impulse of Providence upon me, which had determined me to
go thither again; and that she found nothing hindered me going but
my being engaged to a wife and children. She told me that it was
true she could not think of parting with me: but as she was assured
that if she was dead it would be the first thing I would do, so, as
it seemed to her that the thing was determined above, she would not
be the only obstruction; for, if I thought fit and resolved to
go&mdash;[Here she found me very intent upon her words, and that I
looked very earnestly at her, so that it a little disordered her,
and she stopped. I asked her why she did not go on, and say out
what she was going to say? But I perceived that her heart was too
full, and some tears stood in her eyes.] "Speak out, my dear," said
I; "are you willing I should go?"&mdash;"No," says she, very
affectionately, "I am far from willing; but if you are resolved to
go," says she, "rather than I would be the only hindrance, I will
go with you: for though I think it a most preposterous thing for
one of your years, and in your condition, yet, if it must be," said
she, again weeping, "I would not leave you; for if it be of Heaven
you must do it, there is no resisting it; and if Heaven make it
your duty to go, He will also make it mine to go with you, or
otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct it."</p>

<p>This affectionate behaviour of my wife's brought me a little out
of the vapours, and I began to consider what I was doing; I
corrected my wandering fancy, and began to argue with myself
sedately what business I had after threescore years, and after such
a life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in so happy
and easy a manner; I, say, what business had I to rush into new
hazards, and put myself upon adventures fit only for youth and
poverty to run into?</p>

<p>With those thoughts I considered my new engagement; that I had a
wife, one child born, and my wife then great with child of another;
that I had all the world could give me, and had no need to seek
hazard for gain; that I was declining in years, and ought to think
rather of leaving what I had gained than of seeking to increase it;
that as to what my wife had said of its being an impulse from
Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go, I had no notion of
that; so, after many of these cogitations, I struggled with the
power of my imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe
people may always do in like cases if they will: in a word, I
conquered it, composed myself with such arguments as occurred to my
thoughts, and which my present condition furnished me plentifully
with; and particularly, as the most effectual method, I resolved to
divert myself with other things, and to engage in some business
that might effectually tie me up from any more excursions of this
kind; for I found that thing return upon me chiefly when I was
idle, and had nothing to do, nor anything of moment immediately
before me. To this purpose, I bought a little farm in the county of
Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither. I had a little
convenient house upon it, and the land about it, I found, was
capable of great improvement; and it was many ways suited to my
inclination, which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting,
and improving of land; and particularly, being an inland country, I
was removed from conversing among sailors and things relating to
the remote parts of the world. I went down to my farm, settled my
family, bought ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon-horses, cows, and
sheep, and, setting seriously to work, became in one half-year a
mere country gentleman. My thoughts were entirely taken up in
managing my servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting,
&amp;c.; and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable life that
nature was capable of directing, or that a man always bred to
misfortunes was capable of retreating to.</p>

<p>I farmed upon my own land; I had no rent to pay, was limited by
no articles; I could pull up or cut down as I pleased; what I
planted was for myself, and what I improved was for my family; and
having thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had not the least
discomfort in any part of life as to this world. Now I thought,
indeed, that I enjoyed the middle state of life which my father so
earnestly recommended to me, and lived a kind of heavenly life,
something like what is described by the poet, upon the subject of a
country life:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Free from vices, free from care,<br>
Age has no pain, and youth no snare."</blockquote>

<p>But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen
Providence unhinged me at once; and not only made a breach upon me
inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its consequences, into a
deep relapse of the wandering disposition, which, as I may say,
being born in my very blood, soon recovered its hold of me; and,
like the returns of a violent distemper, came on with an
irresistible force upon me. This blow was the loss of my wife. It
is not my business here to write an elegy upon my wife, give a
character of her particular virtues, and make my court to the sex
by the flattery of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the
stay of all my affairs; the centre of all my enterprises; the
engine that, by her prudence, reduced me to that happy compass I
was in, from the most extravagant and ruinous project that filled
my head, and did more to guide my rambling genius than a mother's
tears, a father's instructions, a friend's counsel, or all my own
reasoning powers could do. I was happy in listening to her, and in
being moved by her entreaties; and to the last degree desolate and
dislocated in the world by the loss of her.</p>

<p>When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me. I was as
much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, as I was in the Brazils,
when I first went on shore there; and as much alone, except for the
assistance of servants, as I was in my island. I knew neither what
to think nor what to do. I saw the world busy around me: one part
labouring for bread, another part squandering in vile excesses or
empty pleasures, but equally miserable because the end they
proposed still fled from them; for the men of pleasure every day
surfeited of their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and
repentance; and the men of labour spent their strength in daily
struggling for bread to maintain the vital strength they laboured
with: so living in a daily circulation of sorrow, living but to
work, and working but to live, as if daily bread were the only end
of wearisome life, and a wearisome life the only occasion of daily
bread.</p>

<p>This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the
island; where I suffered no more corn to grow, because I did not
want it; and bred no more goats, because I had no more use for
them; where the money lay in the drawer till it grew mouldy, and
had scarce the favour to be looked upon in twenty years. All these
things, had I improved them as I ought to have done, and as reason
and religion had dictated to me, would have taught me to search
farther than human enjoyments for a full felicity; and that there
was something which certainly was the reason and end of life
superior to all these things, and which was either to be possessed,
or at least hoped for, on this side of the grave.</p>

<p>But my sage counsellor was gone; I was like a ship without a
pilot, that could only run afore the wind. My thoughts ran all away
again into the old affair; my head was quite turned with the
whimsies of foreign adventures; and all the pleasant, innocent
amusements of my farm, my garden, my cattle, and my family, which
before entirely possessed me, were nothing to me, had no relish,
and were like music to one that has no ear, or food to one that has
no taste. In a word, I resolved to leave off housekeeping, let my
farm, and return to London; and in a few months after I did so.</p>

<p>When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was before; I
had no relish for the place, no employment in it, nothing to do but
to saunter about like an idle person, of whom it may be said he is
perfectly useless in God's creation, and it is not one farthing's
matter to the rest of his kind whether he be dead or alive. This
also was the thing which, of all circumstances of life, was the
most my aversion, who had been all my days used to an active life;
and I would often say to myself, "A state of idleness is the very
dregs of life;" and, indeed, I thought I was much more suitably
employed when I was twenty-six days making a deal board.</p>

<p>It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew, whom,
as I have observed before, I had brought up to the sea, and had
made him commander of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to
Bilbao, being the first he had made. He came to me, and told me
that some merchants of his acquaintance had been proposing to him
to go a voyage for them to the East Indies, and to China, as
private traders. "And now, uncle," says he, "if you will go to sea
with me, I will engage to land you upon your old habitation in the
island; for we are to touch at the Brazils."</p>

<p>Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and of
the existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of second
causes with the idea of things which we form in our minds,
perfectly reserved, and not communicated to any in the world.</p>

<p>My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering was
returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his thought
to say, when that very morning, before he came to me, I had, in a
great deal of confusion of thought, and revolving every part of my
circumstances in my mind, come to this resolution, that I would go
to Lisbon, and consult with my old sea-captain; and if it was
rational and practicable, I would go and see the island again, and
what was become of my people there. I had pleased myself with the
thoughts of peopling the place, and carrying inhabitants from
hence, getting a patent for the possession and I know not what;
when, in the middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I have
said, with his project of carrying me thither in his way to the
East Indies.</p>

<p>I paused a while at his words, and looking steadily at him,
"What devil," said I, "sent you on this unlucky errand?" My nephew
stared as if he had been frightened at first; but perceiving that I
was not much displeased at the proposal, he recovered himself. "I
hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, sir," says he. "I daresay
you would be pleased to see your new colony there, where you once
reigned with more felicity than most of your brother monarchs in
the world." In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper,
that is to say, the prepossession I was under, and of which I have
said so much, that I told him, in a few words, if he agreed with
the merchants, I would go with him; but I told him I would not
promise to go any further than my own island. "Why, sir," says he,
"you don't want to be left there again, I hope?" "But," said I,
"can you not take me up again on your return?" He told me it would
not be possible to do so; that the merchants would never allow him
to come that way with a laden ship of such value, it being a
month's sail out of his way, and might be three or four. "Besides,
sir, if I should miscarry," said he, "and not return at all, then
you would be just reduced to the condition you were in before."</p>

<p>This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy for it,
which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which, being
taken in pieces, might, by the help of some carpenters, whom we
agreed to carry with us, be set up again in the island, and
finished fit to go to sea in a few days. I was not long resolving,
for indeed the importunities of my nephew joined so effectually
with my inclination that nothing could oppose me; on the other
hand, my wife being dead, none concerned themselves so much for me
as to persuade me one way or the other, except my ancient good
friend the widow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider my
years, my easy circumstances, and the needless hazards of a long
voyage; and above all, my young children. But it was all to no
purpose, I had an irresistible desire for the voyage; and I told
her I thought there was something so uncommon in the impressions I
had upon my mind, that it would be a kind of resisting Providence
if I should attempt to stay at home; after which she ceased her
expostulations, and joined with me, not only in making provision
for my voyage, but also in settling my family affairs for my
absence, and providing for the education of my children. In order
to do this, I made my will, and settled the estate I had in such a
manner for my children, and placed in such hands, that I was
perfectly easy and satisfied they would have justice done them,
whatever might befall me; and for their education, I left it wholly
to the widow, with a sufficient maintenance to herself for her
care: all which she richly deserved; for no mother could have taken
more care in their education, or understood it better; and as she
lived till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it.</p>

<p>My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January
1694-5; and I, with my man Friday, went on board, in the Downs, the
8th; having, besides that sloop which I mentioned above, a very
considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony,
which, if I did not find in good condition, I resolved to leave
so.</p>

<p>First, I carried with me some servants whom I purposed to place
there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there upon my
account while I stayed, and either to leave them there or carry
them forward, as they should appear willing; particularly, I
carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious
fellow, who was a cooper by trade, and was also a general mechanic;
for he was dexterous at making wheels and hand-mills to grind corn,
was a good turner and a good pot-maker; he also made anything that
was proper to make of earth or of wood: in a word, we called him
our Jack-of-all-trades. With these I carried a tailor, who had
offered himself to go a passenger to the East Indies with my
nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our new plantation, and
who proved a most necessary handy fellow as could be desired in
many other businesses besides that of his trade; for, as I observed
formerly, necessity arms us for all employments.</p>

<p>My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not kept
account of the particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity of
linen, and some English thin stuffs, for clothing the Spaniards
that I expected to find there; and enough of them, as by my
calculation might comfortably supply them for seven years; if I
remember right, the materials I carried for clothing them, with
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they could
want for wearing, amounted to about two hundred pounds, including
some beds, bedding, and household stuff, particularly kitchen
utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &amp;c.; and near a
hundred pounds more in ironwork, nails, tools of every kind,
staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing I could think
of.</p>

<p>I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees;
besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes,
three or four tons of lead, and two pieces of brass cannon; and,
because I knew not what time and what extremities I was providing
for, I carried a hundred barrels of powder, besides swords,
cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and halberds. In short,
we had a large magazine of all sorts of store; and I made my nephew
carry two small quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ship,
to leave behind if there was occasion; so that when we came there
we might build a fort and man it against all sorts of enemies.
Indeed, I at first thought there would be need enough for all, and
much more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of the island, as
shall be seen in the course of that story.</p>

<p>I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to
meet with, and therefore shall have the less occasion to interrupt
the reader, who perhaps may be impatient to hear how matters went
with my colony; yet some odd accidents, cross winds and bad weather
happened on this first setting out, which made the voyage longer
than I expected it at first; and I, who had never made but one
voyage, my first voyage to Guinea, in which I might be said to come
back again, as the voyage was at first designed, began to think the
same ill fate attended me, and that I was born to be never
contented with being on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at
sea. Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and we were
obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay wind-bound
two-and-twenty days; but we had this satisfaction with the
disaster, that provisions were here exceeding cheap, and in the
utmost plenty; so that while we lay here we never touched the
ship's stores, but rather added to them. Here, also, I took in
several live hogs, and two cows with their calves, which I
resolved, if I had a good passage, to put on shore in my island;
but we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them.</p>

<p>We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very
fair gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might be about
the 20th of February in the evening late, when the mate, having the
watch, came into the round-house and told us he saw a flash of
fire, and heard a gun fired; and while he was telling us of it, a
boy came in and told us the boatswain heard another. This made us
all run out upon the quarter-deck, where for a while we heard
nothing; but in a few minutes we saw a very great light, and found
that there was some very terrible fire at a distance; immediately
we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we all agreed that
there could be no land that way in which the fire showed itself,
no, not for five hundred leagues, for it appeared at WNW. Upon
this, we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea; and as, by
our hearing the noise of guns just before, we concluded that it
could not be far off, we stood directly towards it, and were
presently satisfied we should discover it, because the further we
sailed, the greater the light appeared; though, the weather being
hazy, we could not perceive anything but the light for a while. In
about half-an-hour's sailing, the wind being fair for us, though
not much of it, and the weather clearing up a little, we could
plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire in the middle of
the sea.</p>

<p>I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at
all acquainted with the persons engaged in it; I presently
recollected my former circumstances, and what condition I was in
when taken up by the Portuguese captain; and how much more
deplorable the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to
that ship must be, if they had no other ship in company with them.
Upon this I immediately ordered that five guns should be fired, one
soon after another, that, if possible, we might give notice to them
that there was help for them at hand and that they might endeavour
to save themselves in their boat; for though we could see the
flames of the ship, yet they, it being night, could see nothing of
us.</p>

<p>We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning ship
drove, waiting for daylight; when, on a sudden, to our great
terror, though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the
air; and in a few minutes all the fire was out, that is to say, the
rest of the ship sunk. This was a terrible, and indeed an
afflicting sight, for the sake of the poor men, who, I concluded,
must be either all destroyed in the ship, or be in the utmost
distress in their boat, in the middle of the ocean; which, at
present, as it was dark, I could not see. However, to direct them
as well as I could, I caused lights to be hung out in all parts of
the ship where we could, and which we had lanterns for, and kept
firing guns all the night long, letting them know by this that
there was a ship not far off.</p>

<p>About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's
boats by the help of our perspective glasses, and found there were
two of them, both thronged with people, and deep in the water. We
perceived they rowed, the wind being against them; that they saw
our ship, and did their utmost to make us see them. We immediately
spread our ancient, to let them know we saw them, and hung a waft
out, as a signal for them to come on board, and then made more
sail, standing directly to them. In little more than half-an-hour
we came up with them; and took them all in, being no less than
sixty-four men, women, and children; for there were a great many
passengers.</p>

<p>Upon inquiry we found it was a French merchant ship of
three-hundred tons, home-bound from Quebec. The master gave us a
long account of the distress of his ship; how the fire began in the
steerage by the negligence of the steersman, which, on his crying
out for help, was, as everybody thought, entirely put out; but they
soon found that some sparks of the first fire had got into some
part of the ship so difficult to come at that they could not
effectually quench it; and afterwards getting in between the
timbers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded into the
hold, and mastered all the skill and all the application they were
able to exert.</p>

<p>They had no more to do then but to get into their boats, which,
to their great comfort, were pretty large; being their long-boat,
and a great shallop, besides a small skiff, which was of no great
service to them, other than to get some fresh water and provisions
into her, after they had secured their lives from the fire. They
had, indeed, small hopes of their lives by getting into these boats
at that distance from any land; only, as they said, that they thus
escaped from the fire, and there was a possibility that some ship
might happen to be at sea, and might take them in. They had sails,
oars, and a compass; and had as much provision and water as, with
sparing it so as to be next door to starving, might support them
about twelve days, in which, if they had no bad weather and no
contrary winds, the captain said he hoped he might get to the banks
of Newfoundland, and might perhaps take some fish, to sustain them
till they might go on shore. But there were so many chances against
them in all these cases, such as storms, to overset and founder
them; rains and cold, to benumb and perish their limbs; contrary
winds, to keep them out and starve them; that it must have been
next to miraculous if they had escaped.</p>

<p>In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless
and ready to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told me
they were on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fire,
and after that four more: these were the five guns which I caused
to be fired at first seeing the light. This revived their hearts,
and gave them the notice, which, as above, I desired it should,
that there was a ship at hand for their help. It was upon the
hearing of these guns that they took down their masts and sails:
the sound coming from the windward, they resolved to lie by till
morning. Some time after this, hearing no more guns, they fired
three muskets, one a considerable while after another; but these,
the wind being contrary, we never heard. Some time after that again
they were still more agreeably surprised with seeing our lights,
and hearing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be fired
all the rest of the night. This set them to work with their oars,
to keep their boats ahead, at least that we might the sooner come
up with them; and at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found
we saw them.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the
strange ecstasies, the variety of postures which these poor
delivered people ran into, to express the joy of their souls at so
unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear are easily described:
sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head and hands,
make up the sum of its variety; but an excess of joy, a surprise of
joy, has a thousand extravagances in it. There were some in tears;
some raging and tearing themselves, as if they had been in the
greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark raving and downright
lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with their feet, others
wringing their hands; some were dancing, some singing, some
laughing, more crying, many quite dumb, not able to speak a word;
others sick and vomiting; several swooning and ready to faint; and
a few were crossing themselves and giving God thanks.</p>

<p>I would not wrong them either; there might be many that were
thankful afterwards; but the passion was too strong for them at
first, and they were not able to master it: then were thrown into
ecstasies, and a kind of frenzy, and it was but a very few that
were composed and serious in their joy. Perhaps also, the case may
have some addition to it from the particular circumstance of that
nation they belonged to: I mean the French, whose temper is allowed
to be more volatile, more passionate, and more sprightly, and their
spirits more fluid than in other nations. I am not philosopher
enough to determine the cause; but nothing I had ever seen before
came up to it. The ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in
when he found his father in the boat came the nearest to it; and
the surprise of the master and his two companions, whom I delivered
from the villains that set them on shore in the island, came a
little way towards it; but nothing was to compare to this, either
that I saw in Friday, or anywhere else in my life.</p>

<p>It is further observable, that these extravagances did not show
themselves in that different manner I have mentioned, in different
persons only; but all the variety would appear, in a short
succession of moments, in one and the same person. A man that we
saw this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and confounded, would
the next minute be dancing and hallooing like an antic; and the
next moment be tearing his hair, or pulling his clothes to pieces,
and stamping them under his feet like a madman; in a few moments
after that we would have him all in tears, then sick, swooning,
and, had not immediate help been had, he would in a few moments
have been dead. Thus it was, not with one or two, or ten or twenty,
but with the greatest part of them; and, if I remember right, our
surgeon was obliged to let blood of about thirty persons.</p>

<p>There were two priests among them: one an old man, and the other
a young man; and that which was strangest was, the oldest man was
the worst. As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw
himself safe, he dropped down stone dead to all appearance. Not the
least sign of life could be perceived in him; our surgeon
immediately applied proper remedies to recover him, and was the
only man in the ship that believed he was not dead. At length he
opened a vein in his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the part,
so as to warm it as much as possible. Upon this the blood, which
only dropped at first, flowing freely, in three minutes after the
man opened his eyes; a quarter of an hour after that he spoke, grew
better, and after the blood was stopped, he walked about, told us
he was perfectly well, and took a dram of cordial which the surgeon
gave him. About a quarter of an hour after this they came running
into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a Frenchwoman that
had fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark mad. It seems
he had begun to revolve the change of his circumstances in his
mind, and again this put him into an ecstasy of joy. His spirits
whirled about faster than the vessels could convey them, the blood
grew hot and feverish, and the man was as fit for Bedlam as any
creature that ever was in it. The surgeon would not bleed him again
in that condition, but gave him something to doze and put him to
sleep; which, after some time, operated upon him, and he awoke next
morning perfectly composed and well. The younger priest behaved
with great command of his passions, and was really an example of a
serious, well-governed mind. At his first coming on board the ship
he threw himself flat on his face, prostrating himself in
thankfulness for his deliverance, in which I unhappily and
unseasonably disturbed him, really thinking he had been in a swoon;
but he spoke calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving God thanks
for his deliverance, begged me to leave him a few moments, and
that, next to his Maker, he would give me thanks also. I was
heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not only left him, but
kept others from interrupting him also. He continued in that
posture about three minutes, or little more, after I left him, then
came to me, as he had said he would, and with a great deal of
seriousness and affection, but with tears in his eyes, thanked me,
that had, under God, given him and so many miserable creatures
their lives. I told him I had no need to tell him to thank God for
it, rather than me, for I had seen that he had done that already;
but I added that it was nothing but what reason and humanity
dictated to all men, and that we had as much reason as he to give
thanks to God, who had blessed us so far as to make us the
instruments of His mercy to so many of His creatures. After this
the young priest applied himself to his countrymen, and laboured to
compose them: he persuaded, entreated, argued, reasoned with them,
and did his utmost to keep them within the exercise of their
reason; and with some he had success, though others were for a time
out of all government of themselves.</p>

<p>I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may be
useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for guiding
themselves in the extravagances of their passions; for if an excess
of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the reach of their
reason, what will not the extravagances of anger, rage, and a
provoked mind carry us to? And, indeed, here I saw reason for
keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of every kind, as well
those of joy and satisfaction as those of sorrow and anger.</p>

<p>We were somewhat disordered by these extravagances among our new
guests for the first day; but after they had retired to lodgings
provided for them as well as our ship would allow, and had slept
heartily&mdash;as most of them did, being fatigued and
frightened&mdash;they were quite another sort of people the next
day. Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for the
kindness shown them, was wanting; the French, it is known, are
naturally apt enough to exceed that way. The captain and one of the
priests came to me the next day, and desired to speak with me and
my nephew; the commander began to consult with us what should be
done with them; and first, they told us we had saved their lives,
so all they had was little enough for a return to us for that
kindness received. The captain said they had saved some money and
some things of value in their boats, caught hastily out of the
flames, and if we would accept it they were ordered to make an
offer of it all to us; they only desired to be set on shore
somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they might get a passage
to France. My nephew wished to accept their money at first word,
and to consider what to do with them afterwards; but I overruled
him in that part, for I knew what it was to be set on shore in a
strange country; and if the Portuguese captain that took me up at
sea had served me so, and taken all I had for my deliverance, I
must have been starved, or have been as much a slave at the Brazils
as I had been at Barbary, the mere being sold to a Mahometan
excepted; and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much better master than
a Turk, if not in some cases much worse.</p>

<p>I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up in
their distress, it was true, but that it was our duty to do so, as
we were fellow-creatures; and we would desire to be so delivered if
we were in the like or any other extremity; that we had done
nothing for them but what we believed they would have done for us
if we had been in their case and they in ours; but that we took
them up to save them, not to plunder them; and it would be a most
barbarous thing to take that little from them which they had saved
out of the fire, and then set them on shore and leave them; that
this would be first to save them from death, and then kill them
ourselves: save them from drowning, and abandon them to starving;
and therefore I would not let the least thing be taken from them.
As to setting them on shore, I told them indeed that was an
exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the East
Indies; and though we were driven out of our course to the westward
a very great way, and perhaps were directed by Heaven on purpose
for their deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to
change our voyage on their particular account; nor could my nephew,
the captain, answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under
charter to pursue his voyage by way of Brazil; and all I knew we
could do for them was to put ourselves in the way of meeting with
other ships homeward bound from the West Indies, and get them a
passage, if possible, to England or France.</p>

<p>The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind they
could not but be very thankful for it; but they were in very great
consternation, especially the passengers, at the notion of being
carried away to the East Indies; they then entreated me that as I
was driven so far to the westward before I met with them, I would
at least keep on the same course to the banks of Newfoundland,
where it was probable I might meet with some ship or sloop that
they might hire to carry them back to Canada.</p>

<p>I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and
therefore I inclined to agree to it; for indeed I considered that
to carry this whole company to the East Indies would not only be an
intolerable severity upon the poor people, but would be ruining our
whole voyage by devouring all our provisions; so I thought it no
breach of charter-party, but what an unforeseen accident made
absolutely necessary to us, and in which no one could say we were
to blame; for the laws of God and nature would have forbid that we
should refuse to take up two boats full of people in such a
distressed condition; and the nature of the thing, as well
respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged us to set them on
shore somewhere or other for their deliverance. So I consented that
we would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would
permit: and if not, I would carry them to Martinico, in the West
Indies.</p>

<p>The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty good;
and as the winds had continued in the points between NE. and SE. a
long time, we missed several opportunities of sending them to
France; for we met several ships bound to Europe, whereof two were
French, from St. Christopher's, but they had been so long beating
up against the wind that they durst take in no passengers, for fear
of wanting provisions for the voyage, as well for themselves as for
those they should take in; so we were obliged to go on. It was
about a week after this that we made the banks of Newfoundland;
where, to shorten my story, we put all our French people on board a
bark, which they hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and
afterwards to carry them to France, if they could get provisions to
victual themselves with. When I say all the French went on shore, I
should remember that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were
bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and to
be set on shore on the coast of Coromandel; which I readily agreed
to, for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason, as
will appear afterwards; also four of the seamen entered themselves
on our ship, and proved very useful fellows.</p>

<p>From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, steering
away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days together, sometimes
little or no wind at all; when we met with another subject for our
humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that before.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;INTERVENING HISTORY OF COLONY</h3>

<p>It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N., on the 19th
day of March 1694-95, when we spied a sail, our course SE. and by
S. We soon perceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to
us, but could not at first know what to make of her, till, after
coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her main-topmast,
fore-mast, and bowsprit; and presently she fired a gun as a signal
of distress. The weather was pretty good, wind at NNW. a fresh
gale, and we soon came to speak with her. We found her a ship of
Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the
road at Barbadoes a few days before she was ready to sail, by a
terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate were both gone
on shore; so that, besides the terror of the storm, they were in an
indifferent case for good mariners to bring the ship home. They had
been already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible
storm, after the hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out
of their knowledge to the westward, and in which they lost their
masts. They told us they expected to have seen the Bahama Islands,
but were then driven away again to the south-east, by a strong gale
of wind at NNW., the same that blew now: and having no sails to
work the ship with but a main course, and a kind of square sail
upon a jury fore-mast, which they had set up, they could not lie
near the wind, but were endeavouring to stand away for the
Canaries.</p>

<p>But that which was worst of all was, that they were almost
starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had
undergone; their bread and flesh were quite gone&mdash;they had not
one ounce left in the ship, and had had none for eleven days. The
only relief they had was, their water was not all spent, and they
had about half a barrel of flour left; they had sugar enough; some
succades, or sweetmeats, they had at first, but these were all
devoured; and they had seven casks of rum. There was a youth and
his mother and a maid-servant on board, who were passengers, and
thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came on board the
evening before the hurricane began; and having no provisions of
their own left, they were in a more deplorable condition than the
rest: for the seamen being reduced to such an extreme necessity
themselves, had no compassion, we may be sure, for the poor
passengers; and they were, indeed, in such a condition that their
misery is very hard to describe.</p>

<p>I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not led
me, the weather being fair and the wind abated, to go on board the
ship. The second mate, who upon this occasion commanded the ship,
had been on board our ship, and he told me they had three
passengers in the great cabin that were in a deplorable condition.
"Nay," says he, "I believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing
of them for above two days; and I was afraid to inquire after
them," said he, "for I had nothing to relieve them with." We
immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we could
spare; and indeed I had so far overruled things with my nephew,
that I would have victualled them though we had gone away to
Virginia, or any other part of the coast of America, to have
supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity for that.</p>

<p>But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of
eating too much, even of that little we gave them. The mate, or
commander, brought six men with him in his boat; but these poor
wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak that they could
hardly sit to their oars. The mate himself was very ill, and half
starved; for he declared he had reserved nothing from the men, and
went share and share alike with them in every bit they ate. I
cautioned him to eat sparingly, and set meat before him
immediately, but he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began
to be sick and out of order; so he stopped a while, and our surgeon
mixed him up something with some broth, which he said would be to
him both food and physic; and after he had taken it he grew better.
In the meantime I forgot not the men. I ordered victuals to be
given them, and the poor creatures rather devoured than ate it:
they were so exceedingly hungry that they were in a manner
ravenous, and had no command of themselves; and two of them ate
with so much greediness that they were in danger of their lives the
next morning. The sight of these people's distress was very moving
to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible prospect of at my
first coming on shore in my island, where I had not the least
mouthful of food, or any prospect of procuring any; besides the
hourly apprehensions I had of being made the food of other
creatures. But all the while the mate was thus relating to me the
miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not put out of
my thought the story he had told me of the three poor creatures in
the great cabin, viz. the mother, her son, and the maid-servant,
whom he had heard nothing of for two or three days, and whom, he
seemed to confess, they had wholly neglected, their own extremities
being so great; by which I understood that they had really given
them no food at all, and that therefore they must be perished, and
be all lying dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck of the cabin.</p>

<p>As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain, on
board with his men, to refresh them, so I also forgot not the
starving crew that were left on board, but ordered my own boat to
go on board the ship, and, with my mate and twelve men, to carry
them a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef to boil. Our
surgeon charged the men to cause the meat to be boiled while they
stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men
taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it was
well boiled, and then to give every man but a very little at a
time: and by this caution he preserved the men, who would otherwise
have killed themselves with that very food that was given them on
purpose to save their lives.</p>

<p>At the same time I ordered the mate to go into the great cabin,
and see what condition the poor passengers were in; and if they
were alive, to comfort them, and give them what refreshment was
proper: and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher, with some of the
prepared broth which he had given the mate that was on board, and
which he did not question would restore them gradually. I was not
satisfied with this; but, as I said above, having a great mind to
see the scene of misery which I knew the ship itself would present
me with, in a more lively manner than I could have it by report, I
took the captain of the ship, as we now called him, with me, and
went myself, a little after, in their boat.</p>

<p>I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the
victuals out of the boiler before it was ready; but my mate
observed his orders, and kept a good guard at the cook-room door,
and the man he placed there, after using all possible persuasion to
have patience, kept them off by force; however, he caused some
biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the pot, and softened with the liquor
of the meat, which they called brewis, and gave them every one some
to stay their stomachs, and told them it was for their own safety
that he was obliged to give them but little at a time. But it was
all in vain; and had I not come on board, and their own commander
and officers with me, and with good words, and some threats also of
giving them no more, I believe they would have broken into the
cook-room by force, and torn the meat out of the furnace&mdash;for
words are indeed of very small force to a hungry belly; however, we
pacified them, and fed them gradually and cautiously at first, and
the next time gave them more, and at last filled their bellies, and
the men did well enough.</p>

<p>But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of
another nature, and far beyond the rest; for as, first, the ship's
company had so little for themselves, it was but too true that they
had at first kept them very low, and at last totally neglected
them: so that for six or seven days it might be said they had
really no food at all, and for several days before very little. The
poor mother, who, as the men reported, was a woman of sense and
good breeding, had spared all she could so affectionately for her
son, that at last she entirely sank under it; and when the mate of
our ship went in, she sat upon the floor on deck, with her back up
against the sides, between two chairs, which were lashed fast, and
her head sunk between her shoulders like a corpse, though not quite
dead. My mate said all he could to revive and encourage her, and
with a spoon put some broth into her mouth. She opened her lips,
and lifted up one hand, but could not speak: yet she understood
what he said, and made signs to him, intimating, that it was too
late for her, but pointed to her child, as if she would have said
they should take care of him. However, the mate, who was
exceedingly moved at the sight, endeavoured to get some of the
broth into her mouth, and, as he said, got two or three spoonfuls
down&mdash;though I question whether he could be sure of it or not;
but it was too late, and she died the same night.</p>

<p>The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most
affectionate mother's life, was not so far gone; yet he lay in a
cabin bed, as one stretched out, with hardly any life left in him.
He had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, having eaten up the
rest of it; however, being young, and having more strength than his
mother, the mate got something down his throat, and he began
sensibly to revive; though by giving him, some time after, but two
or three spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought it
up again.</p>

<p>But the next care was the poor maid: she lay all along upon the
deck, hard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen down
in a fit of apoplexy, and struggled for life. Her limbs were
distorted; one of her hands was clasped round the frame of the
chair, and she gripped it so hard that we could not easily make her
let it go; her other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both
together, set fast against the frame of the cabin table: in short,
she lay just like one in the agonies of death, and yet she was
alive too. The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and
terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us
afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying
for two or three days before, and whom she loved most tenderly. We
knew not what to do with this poor girl; for when our surgeon, who
was a man of very great knowledge and experience, had, with great
application, recovered her as to life, he had her upon his hands
still; for she was little less than distracted for a considerable
time after.</p>

<p>Whoever shall read these memorandums must be desired to consider
that visits at sea are not like a journey into the country, where
sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at a place. Our
business was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by
for them; and though they were willing to steer the same course
with us for some days, yet we could carry no sail to keep pace with
a ship that had no masts. However, as their captain begged of us to
help him to set up a main-topmast, and a kind of a topmast to his
jury fore-mast, we did, as it were, lie by him for three or four
days; and then, having given him five barrels of beef, a barrel of
pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, flour,
and what other things we could spare; and taking three casks of
sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight from them for
satisfaction, we left them, taking on board with us, at their own
earnest request, the youth and the maid, and all their goods.</p>

<p>The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a pretty,
well-bred, modest, and sensible youth, greatly dejected with the
loss of his mother, and also at having lost his father but a few
months before, at Barbadoes. He begged of the surgeon to speak to
me to take him out of the ship; for he said the cruel fellows had
murdered his mother: and indeed so they had, that is to say,
passively; for they might have spared a small sustenance to the
poor helpless widow, though it had been but just enough to keep her
alive; but hunger knows no friend, no relation, no justice, no
right, and therefore is remorseless, and capable of no
compassion.</p>

<p>The surgeon told him how far we were going, and that it would
carry him away from all his friends, and put him, perhaps, in as
bad circumstances almost as those we found him in, that is to say,
starving in the world. He said it mattered not whither he went, if
he was but delivered from the terrible crew that he was among; that
the captain (by which he meant me, for he could know nothing of my
nephew) had saved his life, and he was sure would not hurt him; and
as for the maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she would be
very thankful for it, let us carry them where we would. The surgeon
represented the case so affectionately to me that I yielded, and we
took them both on board, with all their goods, except eleven
hogsheads of sugar, which could not be removed or come at; and as
the youth had a bill of lading for them, I made his commander sign
a writing, obliging himself to go, as soon as he came to Bristol,
to one Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the youth said he was
related, and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the
goods he had belonging to the deceased widow; which, I suppose, was
not done, for I could never learn that the ship came to Bristol,
but was, as is most probable, lost at sea, being in so disabled a
condition, and so far from any land, that I am of opinion the first
storm she met with afterwards she might founder, for she was leaky,
and had damage in her hold when we met with her.</p>

<p>I was now in the latitude of 19 degrees 32 minutes, and had
hitherto a tolerable voyage as to weather, though at first the
winds had been contrary. I shall trouble nobody with the little
incidents of wind, weather, currents, &amp;c., on the rest of our
voyage; but to shorten my story, shall observe that I came to my
old habitation, the island, on the 10th of April 1695. It was with
no small difficulty that I found the place; for as I came to it and
went to it before on the south and east side of the island, coming
from the Brazils, so now, coming in between the main and the
island, and having no chart for the coast, nor any landmark, I did
not know it when I saw it, or, know whether I saw it or not. We
beat about a great while, and went on shore on several islands in
the mouth of the great river Orinoco, but none for my purpose; only
this I learned by my coasting the shore, that I was under one great
mistake before, viz. that the continent which I thought I saw from
the island I lived in was really no continent, but a long island,
or rather a ridge of islands, reaching from one to the other side
of the extended mouth of that great river; and that the savages who
came to my island were not properly those which we call Caribbees,
but islanders, and other barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited
nearer to our side than the rest.</p>

<p>In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose; some
I found were inhabited, and some were not; on one of them I found
some Spaniards, and thought they had lived there; but speaking with
them, found they had a sloop lying in a small creek hard by, and
came thither to make salt, and to catch some pearl-mussels if they
could; but that they belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay
farther north, in the latitude of 10 and 11 degrees.</p>

<p>Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes with the
ship, sometimes with the Frenchman's shallop, which we had found a
convenient boat, and therefore kept her with their very good will,
at length I came fair on the south side of my island, and presently
knew the very countenance of the place: so I brought the ship safe
to an anchor, broadside with the little creek where my old
habitation was. As soon as I saw the place I called for Friday, and
asked him if he knew where he was? He looked about a little, and
presently clapping his hands, cried, "Oh yes, Oh there, Oh yes, Oh
there!" pointing to our old habitation, and fell dancing and
capering like a mad fellow; and I had much ado to keep him from
jumping into the sea to swim ashore to the place.</p>

<p>"Well, Friday," says I, "do you think we shall find anybody here
or no? and do you think we shall see your father?" The fellow stood
mute as a stock a good while; but when I named his father, the poor
affectionate creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears
run down his face very plentifully. "What is the matter, Friday?
are you troubled because you may see your father?" "No, no," says
he, shaking his head, "no see him more: no, never more see him
again." "Why so, Friday? how do you know that?" "Oh no, Oh no,"
says Friday, "he long ago die, long ago; he much old man." "Well,
well, Friday, you don't know; but shall we see any one else, then?"
The fellow, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he points to the
hill just above my old house; and though we lay half a league off,
he cries out, "We see! we see! yes, we see much man there, and
there, and there." I looked, but I saw nobody, no, not with a
perspective glass, which was, I suppose, because I could not hit
the place: for the fellow was right, as I found upon inquiry the
next day; and there were five or six men all together, who stood to
look at the ship, not knowing what to think of us.</p>

<p>As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the English
ancient to be spread, and fired three guns, to give them notice we
were friends; and in about a quarter of an hour after we perceived
a smoke arise from the side of the creek; so I immediately ordered
the boat out, taking Friday with me, and hanging out a white flag,
I went directly on shore, taking with me the young friar I
mentioned, to whom I had told the story of my living there, and the
manner of it, and every particular both of myself and those I left
there, and who was on that account extremely desirous to go with
me. We had, besides, about sixteen men well armed, if we had found
any new guests there which we did not know of; but we had no need
of weapons.</p>

<p>As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high water, we
rowed directly into the creek; and the first man I fixed my eye
upon was the Spaniard whose life I had saved, and whom I knew by
his face perfectly well: as to his habit, I shall describe it
afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at first but myself;
but there was no keeping Friday in the boat, for the affectionate
creature had spied his father at a distance, a good way off the
Spaniards, where, indeed, I saw nothing of him; and if they had not
let him go ashore, he would have jumped into the sea. He was no
sooner on shore, but he flew away to his father like an arrow out
of a bow. It would have made any man shed tears, in spite of the
firmest resolution, to have seen the first transports of this poor
fellow's joy when he came to his father: how he embraced him,
kissed him, stroked his face, took him up in his arms, set him down
upon a tree, and lay down by him; then stood and looked at him, as
any one would look at a strange picture, for a quarter of an hour
together; then lay down on the ground, and stroked his legs, and
kissed them, and then got up again and stared at him; one would
have thought the fellow bewitched. But it would have made a dog
laugh the next day to see how his passion ran out another way: in
the morning he walked along the shore with his father several
hours, always leading him by the hand, as if he had been a lady;
and every now and then he would come to the boat to fetch something
or other for him, either a lump of sugar, a dram, a biscuit, or
something or other that was good. In the afternoon his frolics ran
another way; for then he would set the old man down upon the
ground, and dance about him, and make a thousand antic gestures;
and all the while he did this he would be talking to him, and
telling him one story or another of his travels, and of what had
happened to him abroad to divert him. In short, if the same filial
affection was to be found in Christians to their parents in our
part of the world, one would be tempted to say there would hardly
have been any need of the fifth commandment.</p>

<p>But this is a digression: I return to my landing. It would be
needless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that
the Spaniards received me with. The first Spaniard, whom, as I
said, I knew very well, was he whose life I had saved. He came
towards the boat, attended by one more, carrying a flag of truce
also; and he not only did not know me at first, but he had no
thoughts, no notion of its being me that was come, till I spoke to
him. "Seignior," said I, in Portuguese, "do you not know me?" At
which he spoke not a word, but giving his musket to the man that
was with him, threw his arms abroad, saying something in Spanish
that I did not perfectly hear, came forward and embraced me,
telling me he was inexcusable not to know that face again that he
had once seen, as of an angel from heaven sent to save his life; he
said abundance of very handsome things, as a well-bred Spaniard
always knows how, and then, beckoning to the person that attended
him, bade him go and call out his comrades. He then asked me if I
would walk to my old habitation, where he would give me possession
of my own house again, and where I should see they had made but
mean improvements. I walked along with him, but, alas! I could no
more find the place than if I had never been there; for they had
planted so many trees, and placed them in such a position, so thick
and close to one another, and in ten years' time they were grown so
big, that the place was inaccessible, except by such windings and
blind ways as they themselves only, who made them, could find.</p>

<p>I asked them what put them upon all these fortifications; he
told me I would say there was need enough of it when they had given
me an account how they had passed their time since their arriving
in the island, especially after they had the misfortune to find
that I was gone. He told me he could not but have some pleasure in
my good fortune, when he heard that I was gone in a good ship, and
to my satisfaction; and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion
that one time or other he should see me again, but nothing that
ever befell him in his life, he said, was so surprising and
afflicting to him at first as the disappointment he was under when
he came back to the island and found I was not there.</p>

<p>As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left
behind, and of whom, he said, he had a long story to tell me, the
Spaniards all thought themselves much better among the savages,
only that their number was so small: "And," says he, "had they been
strong enough, we had been all long ago in purgatory;" and with
that he crossed himself on the breast. "But, sir," says he, "I hope
you will not be displeased when I shall tell you how, forced by
necessity, we were obliged for our own preservation to disarm them,
and make them our subjects, as they would not be content with being
moderately our masters, but would be our murderers." I answered I
was afraid of it when I left them there, and nothing troubled me at
my parting from the island but that they were not come back, that I
might have put them in possession of everything first, and left the
others in a state of subjection, as they deserved; but if they had
reduced them to it I was very glad, and should be very far from
finding any fault with it; for I knew they were a parcel of
refractory, ungoverned villains, and were fit for any manner of
mischief.</p>

<p>While I was saying this, the man came whom he had sent back, and
with him eleven more. In the dress they were in it was impossible
to guess what nation they were of; but he made all clear, both to
them and to me. First, he turned to me, and pointing to them, said,
"These, sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you;"
and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them know who
I was; upon which they all came up, one by one, not as if they had
been sailors, and ordinary fellows, and the like, but really as if
they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch or great
conqueror: their behaviour was, to the last degree, obliging and
courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic gravity, which very
well became them; and, in short, they had so much more manners than
I, that I scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much less
how to return them in kind.</p>

<p>The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island after
my going away is so very remarkable, and has so many incidents
which the former part of my relation will help to understand, and
which will in most of the particulars, refer to the account I have
already given, that I cannot but commit them, with great delight,
to the reading of those that come after me.</p>

<p>In order to do this as intelligibly as I can, I must go back to
the circumstances in which I left the island, and the persons on
it, of whom I am to speak. And first, it is necessary to repeat
that I had sent away Friday's father and the Spaniard (the two
whose lives I had rescued from the savages) in a large canoe to the
main, as I then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's companions
that he left behind him, in order to save them from the like
calamity that he had been in, and in order to succour them for the
present; and that, if possible, we might together find some way for
our deliverance afterwards. When I sent them away I had no visible
appearance of, or the least room to hope for, my own deliverance,
any more than I had twenty years before&mdash;much less had I any
foreknowledge of what afterwards happened, I mean, of an English
ship coming on shore there to fetch me off; and it could not be but
a very great surprise to them, when they came back, not only to
find that I was gone, but to find three strangers left on the spot,
possessed of all that I had left behind me, which would otherwise
have been their own.</p>

<p>The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that I might
begin where I left off, was of their own part; and I desired the
Spaniard would give me a particular account of his voyage back to
his countrymen with the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over.
He told me there was little variety in that part, for nothing
remarkable happened to them on the way, having had very calm
weather and a smooth sea. As for his countrymen, it could not be
doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to see him (it seems
he was the principal man among them, the captain of the vessel they
had been shipwrecked in having been dead some time): they were, he
said, the more surprised to see him, because they knew that he was
fallen into the hands of the savages, who, they were satisfied,
would devour him as they did all the rest of their prisoners; that
when he told them the story of his deliverance, and in what manner
he was furnished for carrying them away, it was like a dream to
them, and their astonishment, he said, was somewhat like that of
Joseph's brethren when he told them who he was, and the story of
his exaltation in Pharaoh's court; but when he showed them the
arms, the powder, the ball, the provisions that he brought them for
their journey or voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a
just share of the joy of their deliverance, and immediately
prepared to come away with him.</p>

<p>Their first business was to get canoes; and in this they were
obliged not to stick so much upon the honesty of it, but to
trespass upon their friendly savages, and to borrow two large
canoes, or periaguas, on pretence of going out a-fishing, or for
pleasure. In these they came away the next morning. It seems they
wanted no time to get themselves ready; for they had neither
clothes nor provisions, nor anything in the world but what they had
on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used to make their
bread. They were in all three weeks absent; and in that time,
unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered for my escape, as I
mentioned in the other part, and to get off from the island,
leaving three of the most impudent, hardened, ungoverned,
disagreeable villains behind me that any man could desire to meet
with&mdash;to the poor Spaniards' great grief and
disappointment.</p>

<p>The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the Spaniards
came ashore, they gave my letter to them, and gave them provisions,
and other relief, as I had ordered them to do; also they gave them
the long paper of directions which I had left with them, containing
the particular methods which I took for managing every part of my
life there; the way I baked my bread, bred up tame goats, and
planted my corn; how I cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a
word, everything I did. All this being written down, they gave to
the Spaniards (two of them understood English well enough): nor did
they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with anything else, for
they agreed very well for some time. They gave them an equal
admission into the house or cave, and they began to live very
sociably; and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my
methods, together with Friday's father, managed all their affairs;
but as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the
island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises; and when they came home
at night, the Spaniards provided their suppers for them.</p>

<p>The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this had the others
but let them alone, which, however, they could not find in their
hearts to do long: but, like the dog in the manger, they would not
eat themselves, neither would they let the others eat. The
differences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, and such as
are not worth relating, but at last it broke out into open war: and
it began with all the rudeness and insolence that can be
imagined&mdash;without reason, without provocation, contrary to
nature, and indeed to common sense; and though, it is true, the
first relation of it came from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may
call the accusers, yet when I came to examine the fellows they
could not deny a word of it.</p>

<p>But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must supply
a defect in my former relation; and this was, I forgot to set down
among the rest, that just as we were weighing the anchor to set
sail, there happened a little quarrel on board of our ship, which I
was once afraid would have turned to a second mutiny; nor was it
appeased till the captain, rousing up his courage, and taking us
all to his assistance, parted them by force, and making two of the
most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons: and as
they had been active in the former disorders, and let fall some
ugly, dangerous words the second time, he threatened to carry them
in irons to England, and have them hanged there for mutiny and
running away with the ship. This, it seems, though the captain did
not intend to do it, frightened some other men in the ship; and
some of them had put it into the head of the rest that the captain
only gave them good words for the present, till they should come to
same English port, and that then they should be all put into gaol,
and tried for their lives. The mate got intelligence of this, and
acquainted us with it, upon which it was desired that I, who still
passed for a great man among them, should go down with the mate and
satisfy the men, and tell them that they might be assured, if they
behaved well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the time
past should be pardoned. So I went, and after passing my honour's
word to them they appeared easy, and the more so when I caused the
two men that were in irons to be released and forgiven.</p>

<p>But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night; the
wind also falling calm next morning, we found that our two men who
had been laid in irons had stolen each of them a musket and some
other weapons (what powder or shot they had we knew not), and had
taken the ship's pinnace, which was not yet hauled up, and run away
with her to their companions in roguery on shore. As soon as we
found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore, with twelve men and
the mate, and away they went to seek the rogues; but they could
neither find them nor any of the rest, for they all fled into the
woods when they saw the boat coming on shore. The mate was once
resolved, in justice to their roguery, to have destroyed their
plantations, burned all their household stuff and furniture, and
left them to shift without it; but having no orders, he let it all
alone, left everything as he found it, and bringing the pinnace
way, came on board without them. These two men made their number
five; but the other three villains were so much more wicked than
they, that after they had been two or three days together they
turned the two newcomers out of doors to shift for themselves, and
would have nothing to do with them; nor could they for a good while
be persuaded to give them any food: as for the Spaniards, they were
not yet come.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business began to go
forward: the Spaniards would have persuaded the three English
brutes to have taken in their countrymen again, that, as they said,
they might be all one family; but they would not hear of it, so the
two poor fellows lived by themselves; and finding nothing but
industry and application would make them live comfortably, they
pitched their tents on the north shore of the island, but a little
more to the west, to be out of danger of the savages, who always
landed on the east parts of the island. Here they built them two
huts, one to lodge in, and the other to lay up their magazines and
stores in; and the Spaniards having given them some corn for seed,
and some of the peas which I had left them, they dug, planted, and
enclosed, after the pattern I had set for them all, and began to
live pretty well. Their first crop of corn was on the ground; and
though it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up at
first, having had but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve
them, and find them with bread and other eatables; and one of the
fellows being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at making
soup, puddings, and such other preparations as the rice and the
milk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished him to do.</p>

<p>They were going on in this little thriving position when the
three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere humour,
and to insult them, came and bullied them, and told them the island
was theirs: that the governor, meaning me, had given them the
possession of it, and nobody else had any right to it; and that
they should build no houses upon their ground unless they would pay
rent for them. The two men, thinking they were jesting at first,
asked them to come in and sit down, and see what fine houses they
were that they had built, and to tell them what rent they demanded;
and one of them merrily said if they were the ground-landlords, he
hoped if they built tenements upon their land, and made
improvements, they would, according to the custom of landlords,
grant a long lease: and desired they would get a scrivener to draw
the writings. One of the three, cursing and raging, told them they
should see they were not in jest; and going to a little place at a
distance, where the honest men had made a fire to dress their
victuals, he takes a firebrand, and claps it to the outside of
their hut, and set it on fire: indeed, it would have been all
burned down in a few minutes if one of the two had not run to the
fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire out with his feet, and
that not without some difficulty too.</p>

<p>The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrusting him
away, that he returned upon him, with a pole he had in his hand,
and had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the
hut, he had ended his days at once. His comrade, seeing the danger
they were both in, ran after him, and immediately they came both
out with their muskets, and the man that was first struck at with
the pole knocked the fellow down that began the quarrel with the
stock of his musket, and that before the other two could come to
help him; and then, seeing the rest come at them, they stood
together, and presenting the other ends of their pieces to them,
bade them stand off.</p>

<p>The others had firearms with them too; but one of the two honest
men, bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his danger,
told them if they offered to move hand or foot they were dead men,
and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms. They did not,
indeed, lay down their arms, but seeing him so resolute, it brought
them to a parley, and they consented to take their wounded man with
them and be gone: and, indeed, it seems the fellow was wounded
sufficiently with the blow. However, they were much in the wrong,
since they had the advantage, that they did not disarm them
effectually, as they might have done, and have gone immediately to
the Spaniards, and given them an account how the rogues had treated
them; for the three villains studied nothing but revenge, and every
day gave them some intimation that they did so.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III&mdash;FIGHT WITH CANNIBALS</h3>

<p>But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part of
the rogueries with which they plagued them continually, night and
day, it forced the two men to such a desperation that they resolved
to fight them all three, the first time they had a fair
opportunity. In order to do this they resolved to go to the castle
(as they called my old dwelling), where the three rogues and the
Spaniards all lived together at that time, intending to have a fair
battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair play: so they
got up in the morning before day, and came to the place, and called
the Englishmen by their names telling a Spaniard that answered that
they wanted to speak with them.</p>

<p>It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards, having
been in the woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, for
distinction, I called the honest men, and he had made a sad
complaint to the Spaniards of the barbarous usage they had met with
from their three countrymen, and how they had ruined their
plantation, and destroyed their corn, that they had laboured so
hard to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat and their three
kids, which was all they had provided for their sustenance, and
that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist
them again, they should be starved. When the Spaniards came home at
night, and they were all at supper, one of them took the freedom to
reprove the three Englishmen, though in very gentle and mannerly
terms, and asked them how they could be so cruel, they being
harmless, inoffensive fellows: that they were putting themselves in
a way to subsist by their labour, and that it had cost them a great
deal of pains to bring things to such perfection as they were then
in.</p>

<p>One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, "What had they to
do there? that they came on shore without leave; and that they
should not plant or build upon the island; it was none of their
ground." "Why," says the Spaniard, very calmly, "Seignior Inglese,
they must not starve." The Englishman replied, like a rough
tarpaulin, "They might starve; they should not plant nor build in
that place." "But what must they do then, seignior?" said the
Spaniard. Another of the brutes returned, "Do? they should be
servants, and work for them." "But how can you expect that of
them?" says the Spaniard; "they are not bought with your money; you
have no right to make them servants." The Englishman answered, "The
island was theirs; the governor had given it to them, and no man
had anything to do there but themselves;" and with that he swore
that he would go and burn all their new huts; they should build
none upon their land. "Why, seignior," says the Spaniard, "by the
same rule, we must be your servants, too." "Ay," returned the bold
dog, "and so you shall, too, before we have done with you;" mixing
two or three oaths in the proper intervals of his speech. The
Spaniard only smiled at that, and made him no answer. However, this
little discourse had heated them; and starting up, one says to the
other. (I think it was he they called Will Atkins), "Come, Jack,
let's go and have t'other brush with them; we'll demolish their
castle, I'll warrant you; they shall plant no colony in our
dominions."</p>

<p>Upon this they were all trooping away, with every man a gun, a
pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things among
themselves of what they would do to the Spaniards, too, when
opportunity offered; but the Spaniards, it seems, did not so
perfectly understand them as to know all the particulars, only that
in general they threatened them hard for taking the two
Englishmen's part. Whither they went, or how they bestowed their
time that evening, the Spaniards said they did not know; but it
seems they wandered about the country part of the night, and them
lying down in the place which I used to call my bower, they were
weary and overslept themselves. The case was this: they had
resolved to stay till midnight, and so take the two poor men when
they were asleep, and as they acknowledged afterwards, intended to
set fire to their huts while they were in them, and either burn
them there or murder them as they came out. As malice seldom sleeps
very sound, it was very strange they should not have been kept
awake. However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as I
have said, though a much fairer one than that of burning and
murdering, it happened, and very luckily for them all, that they
were up and gone abroad before the bloody-minded rogues came to
their huts.</p>

<p>When they came there, and found the men gone, Atkins, who it
seems was the forwardest man, called out to his comrade, "Ha, Jack,
here's the nest, but the birds are flown." They mused a while, to
think what should be the occasion of their being gone abroad so
soon, and suggested presently that the Spaniards had given them
notice of it; and with that they shook hands, and swore to one
another that they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as
they had made this bloody bargain they fell to work with the poor
men's habitation; they did not set fire, indeed, to anything, but
they pulled down both their houses, and left not the least stick
standing, or scarce any sign on the ground where they stood; they
tore all their household stuff in pieces, and threw everything
about in such a manner, that the poor men afterwards found some of
their things a mile off. When they had done this, they pulled up
all the young trees which the poor men had planted; broke down an
enclosure they had made to secure their cattle and their corn; and,
in a word, sacked and plundered everything as completely as a horde
of Tartars would have done.</p>

<p>The two men were at this juncture gone to find them out, and had
resolved to fight them wherever they had been, though they were but
two to three; so that, had they met, there certainly would have
been blood shed among them, for they were all very stout, resolute
fellows, to give them their due.</p>

<p>But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than they
themselves could do to meet; for, as if they had dogged one
another, when the three were gone thither, the two were here; and
afterwards, when the two went back to find them, the three were
come to the old habitation again: we shall see their different
conduct presently. When the three came back like furious creatures,
flushed with the rage which the work they had been about had put
them into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told them what they
had done, by way of scoff and bravado; and one of them stepping up
to one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of boys at
play, takes hold of his hat as it was upon his head, and giving it
a twirl about, fleering in his face, says to him, "And you,
Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce if you do not
mend your manners." The Spaniard, who, though a quiet civil man,
was as brave a man as could be, and withal a strong, well-made man,
looked at him for a good while, and then, having no weapon in his
hand, stepped gravely up to him, and, with one blow of his fist,
knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a pole-axe; at which one
of the rogues, as insolent as the first, fired his pistol at the
Spaniard immediately; he missed his body, indeed, for the bullets
went through his hair, but one of them touched the tip of his ear,
and he bled pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard believe he was
more hurt than he really was, and that put him into some heat, for
before he acted all in a perfect calm; but now resolving to go
through with his work, he stooped, and taking the fellow's musket
whom he had knocked down, was just going to shoot the man who had
fired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards, being in the cave,
came out, and calling to him not to shoot, they stepped in, secured
the other two, and took their arms from them.</p>

<p>When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all the
Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own countrymen, they
began to cool, and giving the Spaniards better words, would have
their arms again; but the Spaniards, considering the feud that was
between them and the other two Englishmen, and that it would be the
best method they could take to keep them from killing one another,
told them they would do them no harm, and if they would live
peaceably, they would be very willing to assist and associate with
them as they did before; but that they could not think of giving
them their arms again, while they appeared so resolved to do
mischief with them to their own countrymen, and had even threatened
them all to make them their servants.</p>

<p>The rogues were now quite deaf to all reason, and being refused
their arms, they raved away like madmen, threatening what they
would do, though they had no firearms. But the Spaniards, despising
their threatening, told them they should take care how they offered
any injury to their plantation or cattle; for if they did they
would shoot them as they would ravenous beasts, wherever they found
them; and if they fell into their hands alive, they should
certainly be hanged. However, this was far from cooling them, but
away they went, raging and swearing like furies. As soon as they
were gone, the two men came back, in passion and rage enough also,
though of another kind; for having been at their plantation, and
finding it all demolished and destroyed, as above mentioned, it
will easily be supposed they had provocation enough. They could
scarce have room to tell their tale, the Spaniards were so eager to
tell them theirs: and it was strange enough to find that three men
should thus bully nineteen, and receive no punishment at all.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially, having
thus disarmed them, made light of their threatenings; but the two
Englishmen resolved to have their remedy against them, what pains
soever it cost to find them out. But the Spaniards interposed here
too, and told them that as they had disarmed them, they could not
consent that they (the two) should pursue them with firearms, and
perhaps kill them. "But," said the grave Spaniard, who was their
governor, "we will endeavour to make them do you justice, if you
will leave it to us: for there is no doubt but they will come to us
again, when their passion is over, being not able to subsist
without our assistance. We promise you to make no peace with them
without having full satisfaction for you; and upon this condition
we hope you will promise to use no violence with them, other than
in your own defence." The two Englishmen yielded to this very
awkwardly, and with great reluctance; but the Spaniards protested
that they did it only to keep them from bloodshed, and to make them
all easy at last. "For," said they, "we are not so many of us; here
is room enough for us all, and it is a great pity that we should
not be all good friends." At length they did consent, and waited
for the issue of the thing, living for some days with the
Spaniards; for their own habitation was destroyed.</p>

<p>In about five days' time the vagrants, tired with wandering, and
almost starved with hunger, having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs
all that while, came back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard,
who, as I have said, was the governor, and two more with him,
walking by the side of the creek, they came up in a very
submissive, humble manner, and begged to be received again into the
society. The Spaniards used them civilly, but told them they had
acted so unnaturally to their countrymen, and so very grossly to
themselves, that they could not come to any conclusion without
consulting the two Englishmen and the rest; but, however, they
would go to them and discourse about it, and they should know in
half-an-hour. It may be guessed that they were very hard put to it;
for, as they were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they begged
they would send them out some bread in the meantime, which they
did, sending at the same time a large piece of goat's flesh and a
boiled parrot, which they ate very eagerly.</p>

<p>After half-an-hour's consultation they were called in, and a
long debate ensued, their two countrymen charging them with the
ruin of all their labour, and a design to murder them; all which
they owned before, and therefore could not deny now. Upon the
whole, the Spaniards acted the moderators between them; and as they
had obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three while they
were naked and unarmed, so they now obliged the three to go and
rebuild their fellows' two huts, one to be of the same and the
other of larger dimensions than they were before; to fence their
ground again, plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up
the land again for planting corn, and, in a word, to restore
everything to the same state as they found it, that is, as near as
they could.</p>

<p>Well, they submitted to all this; and as they had plenty of
provisions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and
the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together
again; only that these three fellows could never be persuaded to
work&mdash;I mean for themselves&mdash;except now and then a
little, just as they pleased. However, the Spaniards told them
plainly that if they would but live sociably and friendly together,
and study the good of the whole plantation, they would be content
to work for them, and let them walk about and be as idle as they
pleased; and thus, having lived pretty well together for a month or
two, the Spaniards let them have arms again, and gave them liberty
to go abroad with them as before.</p>

<p>It was not above a week after they had these arms, and went
abroad, before the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and
troublesome as ever. However, an accident happened presently upon
this, which endangered the safety of them all, and they were
obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look to the
preservation of their lives.</p>

<p>It happened one night that the governor, the Spaniard whose life
I had saved, who was now the governor of the rest, found himself
very uneasy in the night, and could by no means get any sleep: he
was perfectly well in body, only found his thoughts tumultuous; his
mind ran upon men fighting and killing one another; but he was
broad awake, and could not by any means get any sleep; in short, he
lay a great while, but growing more and more uneasy, he resolved to
rise. As they lay, being so many of them, on goat-skins laid thick
upon such couches and pads as they made for themselves, so they had
little to do, when they were willing to rise, but to get upon their
feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was, and their pumps,
and they were ready for going any way that their thoughts guided
them. Being thus got up, he looked out; but being dark, he could
see little or nothing, and besides, the trees which I had planted,
and which were now grown tall, intercepted his sight, so that he
could only look up, and see that it was a starlight night, and
hearing no noise, he returned and lay down again; but to no
purpose; he could not compose himself to anything like rest; but
his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and he knew not for
what. Having made some noise with rising and walking about, going
out and coming in, another of them waked, and asked who it was that
was up. The governor told him how it had been with him. "Say you
so?" says the other Spaniard; "such things are not to be slighted,
I assure you; there is certainly some mischief working near us;"
and presently he asked him, "Where are the Englishmen?" "They are
all in their huts," says he, "safe enough." It seems the Spaniards
had kept possession of the main apartment, and had made a place for
the three Englishmen, who, since their last mutiny, were always
quartered by themselves, and could not come at the rest. "Well,"
says the Spaniard, "there is something in it, I am persuaded, from
my own experience. I am satisfied that our spirits embodied have a
converse with and receive intelligence from the spirits unembodied,
and inhabiting the invisible world; and this friendly notice is
given for our advantage, if we knew how to make use of it. Come,
let us go and look abroad; and if we find nothing at all in it to
justify the trouble, I'll tell you a story to the purpose, that
shall convince you of the justice of my proposing it."</p>

<p>They went out presently to go up to the top of the hill, where I
used to go; but they being strong, and a good company, nor alone,
as I was, used none of my cautions to go up by the ladder, and
pulling it up after them, to go up a second stage to the top, but
were going round through the grove unwarily, when they were
surprised with seeing a light as of fire, a very little way from
them, and hearing the voices of men, not of one or two, but of a
great number.</p>

<p>Among the precautions I used to take on the savages landing on
the island, it was my constant care to prevent them making the
least discovery of there being any inhabitant upon the place: and
when by any occasion they came to know it, they felt it so
effectually that they that got away were scarce able to give any
account of it; for we disappeared as soon as possible, nor did ever
any that had seen me escape to tell any one else, except it was the
three savages in our last encounter who jumped into the boat; of
whom, I mentioned, I was afraid they should go home and bring more
help. Whether it was the consequence of the escape of those men
that so great a number came now together, or whether they came
ignorantly, and by accident, on their usual bloody errand, the
Spaniards could not understand; but whatever it was, it was their
business either to have concealed themselves or not to have seen
them at all, much less to have let the savages have seen there were
any inhabitants in the place; or to have fallen upon them so
effectually as not a man of them should have escaped, which could
only have been by getting in between them and their boats; but this
presence of mind was wanting to them, which was the ruin of their
tranquillity for a great while.</p>

<p>We need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him,
surprised with this sight, ran back immediately and raised their
fellows, giving them an account of the imminent danger they were
all in, and they again as readily took the alarm; but it was
impossible to persuade them to stay close within where they were,
but they must all run out to see how things stood. While it was
dark, indeed, they were safe, and they had opportunity enough for
some hours to view the savages by the light of three fires they had
made at a distance from one another; what they were doing they knew
not, neither did they know what to do themselves. For, first, the
enemy were too many; and secondly, they did not keep together, but
were divided into several parties, and were on shore in several
places.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight; and,
as they found that the fellows went straggling all over the shore,
they made no doubt but, first or last, some of them would chop in
upon their habitation, or upon some other place where they would
see the token of inhabitants; and they were in great perplexity
also for fear of their flock of goats, which, if they should be
destroyed, would have been little less than starving them. So the
first thing they resolved upon was to despatch three men away
before it was light, two Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive
away all the goats to the great valley where the cave was, and, if
need were, to drive them into the very cave itself. Could they have
seen the savages all together in one body, and at a distance from
their canoes, they were resolved, if there had been a hundred of
them, to attack them; but that could not be done, for they were
some of them two miles off from the other, and, as it appeared
afterwards, were of two different nations.</p>

<p>After having mused a great while on the course they should take,
they resolved at last, while it was still dark, to send the old
savage, Friday's father, out as a spy, to learn, if possible,
something concerning them, as what they came for, what they
intended to do, and the like. The old man readily undertook it; and
stripping himself quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he
went. After he had been gone an hour or two, he brings word that he
had been among them undiscovered, that he found they were two
parties, and of two several nations, who had war with one another,
and had a great battle in their own country; and that both sides
having had several prisoners taken in the fight, they were, by mere
chance, landed all on the same island, for the devouring their
prisoners and making merry; but their coming so by chance to the
same place had spoiled all their mirth&mdash;that they were in a
great rage at one another, and were so near that he believed they
would fight again as soon as daylight began to appear; but he did
not perceive that they had any notion of anybody being on the
island but themselves. He had hardly made an end of telling his
story, when they could perceive, by the unusual noise they made,
that the two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight. Friday's
father used all the arguments he could to persuade our people to
lie close, and not be seen; he told them their safety consisted in
it, and that they had nothing to do but lie still, and the savages
would kill one another to their hands, and then the rest would go
away; and it was so to a tittle. But it was impossible to prevail,
especially upon the Englishmen; their curiosity was so importunate
that they must run out and see the battle. However, they used some
caution too: they did not go openly, just by their own dwelling,
but went farther into the woods, and placed themselves to
advantage, where they might securely see them manage the fight,
and, as they thought, not be seen by them; but the savages did see
them, as we shall find hereafter.</p>

<p>The battle was very fierce, and, if I might believe the
Englishmen, one of them said he could perceive that some of them
were men of great bravery, of invincible spirit, and of great
policy in guiding the fight. The battle, they said, held two hours
before they could guess which party would be beaten; but then that
party which was nearest our people's habitation began to appear
weakest, and after some time more some of them began to fly; and
this put our men again into a great consternation, lest any one of
those that fled should run into the grove before their dwelling for
shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover the place; and that, by
consequence, the pursuers would also do the like in search of them.
Upon this, they resolved that they would stand armed within the
wall, and whoever came into the grove, they resolved to sally out
over the wall and kill them, so that, if possible, not one should
return to give an account of it; they ordered also that it should
be done with their swords, or by knocking them down with the stocks
of their muskets, but not by shooting them, for fear of raising an
alarm by the noise.</p>

<p>As they expected it fell out; three of the routed army fled for
life, and crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in
the least knowing whither they went, but running as into a thick
wood for shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad gave notice of
this within, with this comforting addition, that the conquerors had
not pursued them, or seen which way they were gone; upon this the
Spanish governor, a man of humanity, would not suffer them to kill
the three fugitives, but sending three men out by the top of the
hill, ordered them to go round, come in behind them, and surprise
and take them prisoners, which was done. The residue of the
conquered people fled to their canoes, and got off to sea; the
victors retired, made no pursuit, or very little, but drawing
themselves into a body together, gave two great screaming shouts,
most likely by way of triumph, and so the fight ended; the same
day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also marched to
their canoes. And thus the Spaniards had the island again free to
themselves, their fright was over, and they saw no savages for
several years after.</p>

<p>After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their den,
and viewing the field of battle, they found about two-and-thirty
men dead on the spot; some were killed with long arrows, which were
found sticking in their bodies; but most of them were killed with
great wooden swords, sixteen or seventeen of which they found in
the field of battle, and as many bows, with a great many arrows.
These swords were strange, unwieldy things, and they must be very
strong men that used them; most of those that were killed with them
had their heads smashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as we call it
in English, their brains knocked out, and several their arms and
legs broken; so that it is evident they fight with inexpressible
rage and fury. We found not one man that was not stone dead; for
either they stay by their enemy till they have killed him, or they
carry all the wounded men that are not quite dead away with
them.</p>

<p>This deliverance tamed our ill-disposed Englishmen for a great
while; the sight had filled them with horror, and the consequences
appeared terrible to the last degree, especially upon supposing
that some time or other they should fall into the hands of those
creatures, who would not only kill them as enemies, but for food,
as we kill our cattle; and they professed to me that the thoughts
of being eaten up like beef and mutton, though it was supposed it
was not to be till they were dead, had something in it so horrible
that it nauseated their very stomachs, made them sick when they
thought of it, and filled their minds with such unusual terror,
that they were not themselves for some weeks after. This, as I
said, tamed even the three English brutes I have been speaking of;
and for a great while after they were tractable, and went about the
common business of the whole society well enough&mdash;planted,
sowed, reaped, and began to be all naturalised to the country. But
some time after this they fell into such simple measures again as
brought them into a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>They had taken three prisoners, as I observed; and these three
being stout young fellows, they made them servants, and taught them
to work for them, and as slaves they did well enough; but they did
not take their measures as I did by my man Friday, viz. to begin
with them upon the principle of having saved their lives, and then
instruct them in the rational principles of life; much less did
they think of teaching them religion, or attempt civilising and
reducing them by kind usage and affectionate arguments. As they
gave them their food every day, so they gave them their work too,
and kept them fully employed in drudgery enough; but they failed in
this by it, that they never had them to assist them and fight for
them as I had my man Friday, who was as true to me as the very
flesh upon my bones.</p>

<p>But to come to the family part. Being all now good
friends&mdash;for common danger, as I said above, had effectually
reconciled them&mdash;they began to consider their general
circumstances; and the first thing that came under consideration
was whether, seeing the savages particularly haunted that side of
the island, and that there were more remote and retired parts of it
equally adapted to their way of living, and manifestly to their
advantage, they should not rather move their habitation, and plant
in some more proper place for their safety, and especially for the
security of their cattle and corn.</p>

<p>Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they would
not remove their habitation; because that, some time or other, they
thought they might hear from their governor again, meaning me; and
if I should send any one to seek them, I should be sure to direct
them to that side, where, if they should find the place demolished,
they would conclude the savages had killed us all, and we were
gone, and so our supply would go too. But as to their corn and
cattle, they agreed to remove them into the valley where my cave
was, where the land was as proper for both, and where indeed there
was land enough. However, upon second thoughts they altered one
part of their resolution too, and resolved only to remove part of
their cattle thither, and part of their corn there; so that if one
part was destroyed the other might be saved. And one part of
prudence they luckily used: they never trusted those three savages
which they had taken prisoners with knowing anything of the
plantation they had made in that valley, or of any cattle they had
there, much less of the cave at that place, which they kept, in
case of necessity, as a safe retreat; and thither they carried also
the two barrels of powder which I had sent them at my coming away.
They resolved, however, not to change their habitation; yet, as I
had carefully covered it first with a wall or fortification, and
then with a grove of trees, and as they were now fully convinced
their safety consisted entirely in their being concealed, they set
to work to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually than
before. For this purpose, as I planted trees, or rather thrust in
stakes, which in time all grew up to be trees, for some good
distance before the entrance into my apartments, they went on in
the same manner, and filled up the rest of that whole space of
ground from the trees I had set quite down to the side of the
creek, where I landed my floats, and even into the very ooze where
the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or any
sign that there had been any landing thereabouts: these stakes also
being of a wood very forward to grow, they took care to have them
generally much larger and taller than those which I had planted. As
they grew apace, they planted them so very thick and close
together, that when they had been three or four years grown there
was no piercing with the eye any considerable way into the
plantation. As for that part which I had planted, the trees were
grown as thick as a man's thigh, and among them they had placed so
many other short ones, and so thick, that it stood like a palisado
a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to impossible to
penetrate it, for a little dog could hardly get between the trees,
they stood so close.</p>

<p>But this was not all; for they did the same by all the ground to
the right hand and to the left, and round even to the side of the
hill, leaving no way, not so much as for themselves, to come out
but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then
lifted up, and placed again from the first stage up to the top: so
that when the ladder was taken down, nothing but what had wings or
witchcraft to assist it could come at them. This was excellently
well contrived: nor was it less than what they afterwards found
occasion for, which served to convince me, that as human prudence
has the authority of Providence to justify it, so it has doubtless
the direction of Providence to set it to work; and if we listened
carefully to the voice of it, I am persuaded we might prevent many
of the disasters which our lives are now, by our own negligence,
subjected to.</p>

<p>They lived two years after this in perfect retirement, and had
no more visits from the savages. They had, indeed, an alarm given
them one morning, which put them into a great consternation; for
some of the Spaniards being out early one morning on the west side
or end of the island (which was that end where I never went, for
fear of being discovered), they were surprised with seeing about
twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore. They made the best
of their way home in hurry enough; and giving the alarm to their
comrades, they kept close all that day and the next, going out only
at night to make their observation: but they had the good luck to
be undiscovered, for wherever the savages went, they did not land
that time on the island, but pursued some other design.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV&mdash;RENEWED INVASION OF SAVAGES</h3>

<p>And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen; one of
whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage at one of the three
captive slaves, because the fellow had not done something right
which he bade him do, and seemed a little untractable in his
showing him, drew a hatchet out of a frog-belt which he wore by his
side, and fell upon the poor savage, not to correct him, but to
kill him. One of the Spaniards who was by, seeing him give the
fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his
head, but stuck into his shoulder, so that he thought he had cut
the poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and entreating him not to
murder the poor man, placed himself between him and the savage, to
prevent the mischief. The fellow, being enraged the more at this,
struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would serve
him as he intended to serve the savage; which the Spaniard
perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a shovel, which he had in
his hand (for they were all working in the field about their corn
land), knocked the brute down. Another of the Englishmen, running
up at the same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard down;
and then two Spaniards more came in to help their man, and a third
Englishman fell in upon them. They had none of them any firearms or
any other weapons but hatchets and other tools, except this third
Englishman; he had one of my rusty cutlasses, with which he made at
the two last Spaniards, and wounded them both. This fray set the
whole family in an uproar, and more help coming in they took the
three Englishmen prisoners. The next question was, what should be
done with them? They had been so often mutinous, and were so very
furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, they knew not what
course to take with them, for they were mischievous to the highest
degree, and cared not what hurt they did to any man; so that, in
short, it was not safe to live with them.</p>

<p>The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many words, that
if they had been of his own country he would have hanged them; for
all laws and all governors were to preserve society, and those who
were dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out of it; but
as they were Englishmen, and that it was to the generous kindness
of an Englishman that they all owed their preservation and
deliverance, he would use them with all possible lenity, and would
leave them to the judgment of the other two Englishmen, who were
their countrymen. One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and
said they desired it might not be left to them. "For," says he, "I
am sure we ought to sentence them to the gallows;" and with that he
gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to
have all the five Englishmen join together and murder all the
Spaniards when they were in their sleep.</p>

<p>When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will Atkins,
"How, Seignior Atkins, would you murder us all? What have you to
say to that?" The hardened villain was so far from denying it, that
he said it was true, and swore they would do it still before they
had done with them. "Well, but Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard,
"what have we done to you that you will kill us? What would you get
by killing us? And what must we do to prevent you killing us? Must
we kill you, or you kill us? Why will you put us to the necessity
of this, Seignior Atkins?" says the Spaniard very calmly, and
smiling. Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's
making a jest of it, that, had he not been held by three men, and
withal had no weapon near him, it was thought he would have
attempted to kill the Spaniard in the middle of all the company.
This hare-brained carriage obliged them to consider seriously what
was to be done. The two Englishmen and the Spaniard who saved the
poor savage were of the opinion that they should hang one of the
three for an example to the rest, and that particularly it should
be he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet;
indeed, there was some reason to believe he had done it, for the
poor savage was in such a miserable condition with the wound he had
received that it was thought he could not live. But the governor
Spaniard still said No; it was an Englishman that had saved all
their lives, and he would never consent to put an Englishman to
death, though he had murdered half of them; nay, he said if he had
been killed himself by an Englishman, and had time left to speak,
it should be that they should pardon him.</p>

<p>This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard,
that there was no gainsaying it; and as merciful counsels are most
apt to prevail where they are so earnestly pressed, so they all
came into it. But then it was to be considered what should be done
to keep them from doing the mischief they designed; for all agreed,
governor and all, that means were to be used for preserving the
society from danger. After a long debate, it was agreed that they
should be disarmed, and not permitted to have either gun, powder,
shot, sword, or any weapon; that they should be turned out of the
society, and left to live where they would and how they would, by
themselves; but that none of the rest, either Spaniards or English,
should hold any kind of converse with them, or have anything to do
with them; that they should be forbid to come within a certain
distance of the place where the rest dwelt; and if they offered to
commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of
the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the
society, they should die without mercy, and they would shoot them
wherever they could find them.</p>

<p>The humane governor, musing upon the sentence, considered a
little upon it; and turning to the two honest Englishmen, said,
"Hold; you must reflect that it will be long ere they can raise
corn and cattle of their own, and they must not starve; we must
therefore allow them provisions." So he caused to be added, that
they should have a proportion of corn given them to last them eight
months, and for seed to sow, by which time they might be supposed
to raise some of their own; that they should have six milch-goats,
four he-goats, and six kids given them, as well for present
subsistence as for a store; and that they should have tools given
them for their work in the fields, but they should have none of
these tools or provisions unless they would swear solemnly that
they would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of
their fellow-Englishmen.</p>

<p>Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to
shift for themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, as
neither content to go away nor to stay: but, as there was no
remedy, they went, pretending to go and choose a place where they
would settle themselves; and some provisions were given them, but
no weapons. About four or five days after, they came again for some
victuals, and gave the governor an account where they had pitched
their tents, and marked themselves out a habitation and plantation;
and it was a very convenient place indeed, on the remotest part of
the island, NE., much about the place where I providentially landed
in my first voyage, when I was driven out to sea in my foolish
attempt to sail round the island.</p>

<p>Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived them
in a manner like my first habitation, being close under the side of
a hill, having some trees already growing on three sides of it, so
that by planting others it would be very easily covered from the
sight, unless narrowly searched for. They desired some dried
goat-skins for beds and covering, which were given them; and upon
giving their words that they would not disturb the rest, or injure
any of their plantations, they gave them hatchets, and what other
tools they could spare; some peas, barley, and rice, for sowing;
and, in a word, anything they wanted, except arms and
ammunition.</p>

<p>They lived in this separate condition about six months, and had
got in their first harvest, though the quantity was but small, the
parcel of land they had planted being but little. Indeed, having
all their plantation to form, they had a great deal of work upon
their hands; and when they came to make boards and pots, and such
things, they were quite out of their element, and could make
nothing of it; therefore when the rainy season came on, for want of
a cave in the earth, they could not keep their grain dry, and it
was in great danger of spoiling. This humbled them much: so they
came and begged the Spaniards to help them, which they very readily
did; and in four days worked a great hole in the side of the hill
for them, big enough to secure their corn and other things from the
rain: but it was a poor place at best compared to mine, and
especially as mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly enlarged
it, and made several new apartments in it.</p>

<p>About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new
frolic took these rogues, which, together with the former villainy
they had committed, brought mischief enough upon them, and had very
near been the ruin of the whole colony. The three new associates
began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious life they led, and
that without hope of bettering their circumstances: and a whim took
them that they would make a voyage to the continent, from whence
the savages came, and would try if they could seize upon some
prisoners among the natives there, and bring them home, so as to
make them do the laborious part of the work for them.</p>

<p>The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no
further. But they did nothing, and proposed nothing, but had either
mischief in the design, or mischief in the event. And if I may give
my opinion, they seemed to be under a blast from Heaven: for if we
will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall
we reconcile the events of things with the divine justice? It was
certainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy
that brought them to the state they were in; and they showed not
the least remorse for the crime, but added new villanies to it,
such as the piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave
because he did not, or perhaps could not, understand to do what he
was directed, and to wound him in such a manner as made him a
cripple all his life, and in a place where no surgeon or medicine
could be had for his cure; and, what was still worse, the
intentional murder, for such to be sure it was, as was afterwards
the formed design they all laid to murder the Spaniards in cold
blood, and in their sleep.</p>

<p>The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning, and in
very humble terms desired to be admitted to speak with them. The
Spaniards very readily heard what they had to say, which was this:
that they were tired of living in the manner they did, and that
they were not handy enough to make the necessaries they wanted, and
that having no help, they found they should be starved; but if the
Spaniards would give them leave to take one of the canoes which
they came over in, and give them arms and ammunition proportioned
to their defence, they would go over to the main, and seek their
fortunes, and so deliver them from the trouble of supplying them
with any other provisions.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but very
honestly represented to them the certain destruction they were
running into; told them they had suffered such hardships upon that
very spot, that they could, without any spirit of prophecy, tell
them they would be starved or murdered, and bade them consider of
it. The men replied audaciously, they should be starved if they
stayed here, for they could not work, and would not work, and they
could but be starved abroad; and if they were murdered, there was
an end of them; they had no wives or children to cry after them;
and, in short, insisted importunately upon their demand, declaring
they would go, whether they gave them any arms or not.</p>

<p>The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they were
resolved to go they should not go like naked men, and be in no
condition to defend themselves; and that though they could ill
spare firearms, not having enough for themselves, yet they would
let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and each man a
hatchet, which they thought was sufficient for them. In a word,
they accepted the offer; and having baked bread enough to serve
them a month given them, and as much goats' flesh as they could eat
while it was sweet, with a great basket of dried grapes, a pot of
fresh water, and a young kid alive, they boldly set out in the
canoe for a voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty miles
broad. The boat, indeed, was a large one, and would very well have
carried fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather too big for
them to manage; but as they had a fair breeze and flood-tide with
them, they did well enough. They had made a mast of a long pole,
and a sail of four large goat-skins dried, which they had sewed or
laced together; and away they went merrily together. The Spaniards
called after them "<i>Bon voyajo</i>;" and no man ever thought of
seeing them any more.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to the two
honest Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and comfortably
they lived, now these three turbulent fellows were gone. As for
their coming again, that was the remotest thing from their thoughts
that could be imagined; when, behold, after two-and-twenty days'
absence, one of the Englishmen being abroad upon his planting work,
sees three strange men coming towards him at a distance, with guns
upon their shoulders.</p>

<p>Away runs the Englishman, frightened and amazed, as if he was
bewitched, to the governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all
undone, for there were strangers upon the island, but he could not
tell who they were. The Spaniard, pausing a while, says to him,
"How do you mean&mdash;you cannot tell who? They are the savages,
to be sure." "No, no," says the Englishman, "they are men in
clothes, with arms." "Nay, then," says the Spaniard, "why are you
so concerned! If they are not savages they must be friends; for
there is no Christian nation upon earth but will do us good rather
than harm." While they were debating thus, came up the three
Englishmen, and standing without the wood, which was new planted,
hallooed to them. They presently knew their voices, and so all the
wonder ceased. But now the admiration was turned upon another
question&mdash;What could be the matter, and what made them come
back again?</p>

<p>It was not long before they brought the men in, and inquiring
where they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them a
full account of their voyage in a few words: that they reached the
land in less than two days, but finding the people alarmed at their
coming, and preparing with bows and arrows to fight them, they
durst not go on, shore, but sailed on to the northward six or seven
hours, till they came to a great opening, by which they perceived
that the land they saw from our island was not the main, but an
island: that upon entering that opening of the sea they saw another
island on the right hand north, and several more west; and being
resolved to land somewhere, they put over to one of the islands
which lay west, and went boldly on shore; that they found the
people very courteous and friendly to them; and they gave them
several roots and some dried fish, and appeared very sociable; and
that the women, as well as the men, were very forward to supply
them with anything they could get for them to eat, and brought it
to them a great way, on their heads. They continued here for four
days, and inquired as well as they could of them by signs, what
nations were this way, and that way, and were told of several
fierce and terrible people that lived almost every way, who, as
they made known by signs to them, used to eat men; but, as for
themselves, they said they never ate men or women, except only such
as they took in the wars; and then they owned they made a great
feast, and ate their prisoners.</p>

<p>The Englishmen inquired when they had had a feast of that kind;
and they told them about two moons ago, pointing to the moon and to
two fingers; and that their great king had two hundred prisoners
now, which he had taken in his war, and they were feeding them to
make them fat for the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty
desirous of seeing those prisoners; but the others mistaking them,
thought they were desirous to have some of them to carry away for
their own eating. So they beckoned to them, pointing to the setting
of the sun, and then to the rising; which was to signify that the
next morning at sunrising they would bring some for them; and
accordingly the next morning they brought down five women and
eleven men, and gave them to the Englishmen to carry with them on
their voyage, just as we would bring so many cows and oxen down to
a seaport town to victual a ship.</p>

<p>As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their
stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know what to do. To
refuse the prisoners would have been the highest affront to the
savage gentry that could be offered them, and what to do with them
they knew not. However, after some debate, they resolved to accept
of them: and, in return, they gave the savages that brought them
one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of
their bullets; which, though they did not understand their use,
they seemed particularly pleased with; and then tying the poor
creatures' hands behind them, they dragged the prisoners into the
boat for our men.</p>

<p>The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had
them, or else they that gave them this noble present would
certainly have expected that they should have gone to work with
them, have killed two or three of them the next morning, and
perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. But having taken their
leave, with all the respect and thanks that could well pass between
people, where on either side they understood not one word they
could say, they put off with their boat, and came back towards the
first island; where, when they arrived, they set eight of their
prisoners at liberty, there being too many of them for their
occasion. In their voyage they endeavoured to have some
communication with their prisoners; but it was impossible to make
them understand anything. Nothing they could say to them, or give
them, or do for them, but was looked upon as going to murder them.
They first of all unbound them; but the poor creatures screamed at
that, especially the women, as if they had just felt the knife at
their throats; for they immediately concluded they were unbound on
purpose to be killed. If they gave them thing to eat, it was the
same thing; they then concluded it was for fear they should sink in
flesh, and so not be fat enough to kill. If they looked at one of
them more particularly, the party presently concluded it was to see
whether he or she was fattest, and fittest to kill first; nay,
after they had brought them quite over, and began to use them
kindly, and treat them well, still they expected every day to make
a dinner or supper for their new masters.</p>

<p>When the three wanderers had give this unaccountable history or
journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them where their new
family was; and being told that they had brought them on shore, and
put them into one of their huts, and were come up to beg some
victuals for them, they (the Spaniards) and the other two
Englishmen, that is to say, the whole colony, resolved to go all
down to the place and see them; and did so, and Friday's father
with them. When they came into the hut, there they sat, all bound;
for when they had brought them on shore they bound their hands that
they might not take the boat and make their escape; there, I say,
they sat, all of them stark naked. First, there were three comely
fellows, well shaped, with straight limbs, about thirty to
thirty-five years of age; and five women, whereof two might be from
thirty to forty, two more about four or five and twenty; and the
fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about seventeen. The women were
well-favoured, agreeable persons, both in shape and features, only
tawny; and two of them, had they been perfect white, would have
passed for very handsome women, even in London, having pleasant
countenances, and of a very modest behaviour; especially when they
came afterwards to be clothed and dressed, though that dress was
very indifferent, it must be confessed.</p>

<p>The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our
Spaniards, who were, to give them a just character, men of the most
calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good humour, that ever I met
with: and, in particular, of the utmost modesty: I say, the sight
was very uncouth, to see three naked men and five naked women, all
together bound, and in the most miserable circumstances that human
nature could be supposed to be, viz. to be expecting every moment
to be dragged out and have their brains knocked out, and then to be
eaten up like a calf that is killed for a dainty.</p>

<p>The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday's
father, to go in, and see first if he knew any of them, and then if
he understood any of their speech. As soon as the old man came in,
he looked seriously at them, but knew none of them; neither could
any of them understand a word he said, or a sign he could make,
except one of the women. However, this was enough to answer the
end, which was to satisfy them that the men into whose hands they
were fallen were Christians; that they abhorred eating men or
women; and that they might be sure they would not be killed. As
soon as they were assured of this, they discovered such a joy, and
by such awkward gestures, several ways, as is hard to describe; for
it seems they were of several nations. The woman who was their
interpreter was bid, in the next place, to ask them if they were
willing to be servants, and to work for the men who had brought
them away, to save their lives; at which they all fell a-dancing;
and presently one fell to taking up this, and another that,
anything that lay next, to carry on their shoulders, to intimate
they were willing to work.</p>

<p>The governor, who found that the having women among them would
presently be attended with some inconvenience, and might occasion
some strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they
intended to do with these women, and how they intended to use them,
whether as servants or as wives? One of the Englishmen answered,
very boldly and readily, that they would use them as both; to which
the governor said: "I am not going to restrain you from
it&mdash;you are your own masters as to that; but this I think is
but just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels among you, and I
desire it of you for that reason only, viz. that you will all
engage, that if any of you take any of these women as a wife, he
shall take but one; and that having taken one, none else shall
touch her; for though we cannot marry any one of you, yet it is but
reasonable that, while you stay here, the woman any of you takes
shall be maintained by the man that takes her, and should be his
wife&mdash;I mean," says he, "while he continues here, and that
none else shall have anything to do with her." All this appeared so
just, that every one agreed to it without any difficulty.</p>

<p>Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they designed to take
any of them? But every one of them answered "No." Some of them said
they had wives in Spain, and the others did not like women that
were not Christians; and all together declared that they would not
touch one of them, which was an instance of such virtue as I have
not met with in all my travels. On the other hand, the five
Englishmen took them every one a wife, that is to say, a temporary
wife; and so they set up a new form of living; for the Spaniards
and Friday's father lived in my old habitation, which they had
enlarged exceedingly within. The three servants which were taken in
the last battle of the savages lived with them; and these carried
on the main part of the colony, supplied all the rest with food,
and assisted them in anything as they could, or as they found
necessity required.</p>

<p>But the wonder of the story was, how five such refractory,
ill-matched fellows should agree about these women, and that some
two of them should not choose the same woman, especially seeing two
or three of them were, without comparison, more agreeable than the
others; but they took a good way enough to prevent quarrelling
among themselves, for they set the five women by themselves in one
of their huts, and they went all into the other hut, and drew lots
among them who should choose first.</p>

<p>Him that drew to choose first went away by himself to the hut
where the poor naked creatures were, and fetched out her he chose;
and it was worth observing, that he that chose first took her that
was reckoned the homeliest and oldest of the five, which made mirth
enough amongst the rest; and even the Spaniards laughed at it; but
the fellow considered better than any of them, that it was
application and business they were to expect assistance in, as much
as in anything else; and she proved the best wife of all the
parcel.</p>

<p>When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, and
fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition returned
upon them again, and they firmly believed they were now going to be
devoured. Accordingly, when the English sailor came in and fetched
out one of them, the rest set up a most lamentable cry, and hung
about her, and took their leave of her with such agonies and
affection as would have grieved the hardest heart in the world: nor
was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them that they were
not to be immediately murdered, till they fetched the old man,
Friday's father, who immediately let them know that the five men,
who were to fetch them out one by one, had chosen them for their
wives. When they had done, and the fright the women were in was a
little over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and
helped them: and in a few hours they had built them every one a new
hut or tent for their lodging apart; for those they had already
were crowded with their tools, household stuff, and provisions. The
three wicked ones had pitched farthest off, and the two honest ones
nearer, but both on the north shore of the island, so that they
continued separated as before; and thus my island was peopled in
three places, and, as I might say, three towns were begun to be
built.</p>

<p>And here it is very well worth observing that, as it often
happens in the world (what the wise ends in God's providence are,
in such a disposition of things, I cannot say), the two honest
fellows had the two worst wives; and the three reprobates, that
were scarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, and neither
seemed born to do themselves good nor any one else, had three
clever, careful, and ingenious wives; not that the first two were
bad wives as to their temper or humour, for all the five were most
willing, quiet, passive, and subjected creatures, rather like
slaves than wives; but my meaning is, they were not alike capable,
ingenious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat. Another
observation I must make, to the honour of a diligent application on
one hand, and to the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper
on the other, that when I came to the place, and viewed the several
improvements, plantings, and management of the several little
colonies, the two men had so far out-gone the three, that there was
no comparison. They had, indeed, both of them as much ground laid
out for corn as they wanted, and the reason was, because, according
to my rule, nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more
corn than they wanted; but the difference of the cultivation, of
the planting, of the fences, and indeed, of everything else, was
easy to be seen at first view.</p>

<p>The two men had innumerable young trees planted about their
huts, so that, when you came to the place, nothing was to be seen
but a wood; and though they had twice had their plantation
demolished, once by their own countrymen, and once by the enemy, as
shall be shown in its place, yet they had restored all again, and
everything was thriving and flourishing about them; they had grapes
planted in order, and managed like a vineyard, though they had
themselves never seen anything of that kind; and by their good
ordering their vines, their grapes were as good again as any of the
others. They had also found themselves out a retreat in the
thickest part of the woods, where, though there was not a natural
cave, as I had found, yet they made one with incessant labour of
their hands, and where, when the mischief which followed happened,
they secured their wives and children so as they could never be
found; they having, by sticking innumerable stakes and poles of the
wood which, as I said, grew so readily, made the grove impassable,
except in some places, when they climbed up to get over the outside
part, and then went on by ways of their own leaving.</p>

<p>As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, though they
were much civilised by their settlement compared to what they were
before, and were not so quarrelsome, having not the same
opportunity; yet one of the certain companions of a profligate mind
never left them, and that was their idleness. It is true, they
planted corn and made fences; but Solomon's words were never better
verified than in them, "I went by the vineyard of the slothful, and
it was all overgrown with thorns": for when the Spaniards came to
view their crop they could not see it in some places for weeds, the
hedge had several gaps in it, where the wild goats had got in and
eaten up the corn; perhaps here and there a dead bush was crammed
in, to stop them out for the present, but it was only shutting the
stable-door after the steed was stolen. Whereas, when they looked
on the colony of the other two, there was the very face of industry
and success upon all they did; there was not a weed to be seen in
all their corn, or a gap in any of their hedges; and they, on the
other hand, verified Solomon's words in another place, "that the
diligent hand maketh rich"; for everything grew and thrived, and
they had plenty within and without; they had more tame cattle than
the others, more utensils and necessaries within doors, and yet
more pleasure and diversion too.</p>

<p>It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly
within doors; and having learned the English ways of dressing, and
cooking from one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a
cook's mate on board the ship, they dressed their husbands'
victuals very nicely and well; whereas the others could not be
brought to understand it; but then the husband, who, as I say, had
been cook's mate, did it himself. But as for the husbands of the
three wives, they loitered about, fetched turtles' eggs, and caught
fish and birds: in a word, anything but labour; and they fared
accordingly. The diligent lived well and comfortably, and the
slothful hard and beggarly; and so, I believe, generally speaking,
it is all over the world.</p>

<p>But I now come to a scene different from all that had happened
before, either to them or to me; and the origin of the story was
this: Early one morning there came on shore five or six canoes of
Indians or savages, call them which you please, and there is no
room to doubt they came upon the old errand of feeding upon their
slaves; but that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to
our men too, that they did not concern themselves about it, as I
did: but having been made sensible, by their experience, that their
only business was to lie concealed, and that if they were not seen
by any of the savages they would go off again quietly, when their
business was done, having as yet not the least notion of there
being any inhabitants in the island; I say, having been made
sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to give notice to all
the three plantations to keep within doors, and not show
themselves, only placing a scout in a proper place, to give notice
when the boats went to sea again.</p>

<p>This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster spoiled all
these measures, and made it known among the savages that there were
inhabitants there; which was, in the end, the desolation of almost
the whole colony. After the canoes with the savages were gone off,
the Spaniards peeped abroad again; and some of them had the
curiosity to go to the place where they had been, to see what they
had been doing. Here, to their great surprise, they found three
savages left behind, and lying fast asleep upon the ground. It was
supposed they had either been so gorged with their inhuman feast,
that, like beasts, they were fallen asleep, and would not stir when
the others went, or they had wandered into the woods, and did not
come back in time to be taken in.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight and perfectly
at a loss what to do. The Spaniard governor, as it happened, was
with them, and his advice was asked, but he professed he knew not
what to do. As for slaves, they had enough already; and as to
killing them, there were none of them inclined to do that: the
Spaniard governor told me they could not think of shedding innocent
blood; for as to them, the poor creatures had done them no wrong,
invaded none of their property, and they thought they had no just
quarrel against them, to take away their lives. And here I must, in
justice to these Spaniards, observe that, let the accounts of
Spanish cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met
with seventeen men of any nation whatsoever, in any foreign
country, who were so universally modest, temperate, virtuous, so
very good-humoured, and so courteous, as these Spaniards: and as to
cruelty, they had nothing of it in their very nature; no
inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous passions; and yet all of
them men of great courage and spirit. Their temper and calmness had
appeared in their bearing the insufferable usage of the three
Englishmen; and their justice and humanity appeared now in the case
of the savages above. After some consultation they resolved upon
this; that they would lie still a while longer, till, if possible,
these three men might be gone. But then the governor recollected
that the three savages had no boat; and if they were left to rove
about the island, they would certainly discover that there were
inhabitants in it; and so they should be undone that way. Upon
this, they went back again, and there lay the fellows fast asleep
still, and so they resolved to awaken them, and take them
prisoners; and they did so. The poor fellows were strangely
frightened when they were seized upon and bound; and afraid, like
the women, that they should be murdered and eaten: for it seems
those people think all the world does as they do, in eating men's
flesh; but they were soon made easy as to that, and away they
carried them.</p>

<p>It was very happy for them that they did not carry them home to
the castle, I mean to my palace under the hill; but they carried
them first to the bower, where was the chief of their country work,
such as the keeping the goats, the planting the corn, &amp;c.; and
afterward they carried them to the habitation of the two
Englishmen. Here they were set to work, though it was not much they
had for them to do; and whether it was by negligence in guarding
them, or that they thought the fellows could not mend themselves, I
know not, but one of them ran away, and, taking to the woods, they
could never hear of him any more. They had good reason to believe
he got home again soon after in some other boats or canoes of
savages who came on shore three or four weeks afterwards, and who,
carrying on their revels as usual, went off in two days' time. This
thought terrified them exceedingly; for they concluded, and that
not without good cause indeed, that if this fellow came home safe
among his comrades, he would certainly give them an account that
there were people in the island, and also how few and weak they
were; for this savage, as observed before, had never been told, and
it was very happy he had not, how many there were or where they
lived; nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of their guns,
much less had they shown him any of their other retired places;
such as the cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the two
Englishmen had made, and the like.</p>

<p>The first testimony they had that this fellow had given
intelligence of them was, that about two mouths after this six
canoes of savages, with about seven, eight, or ten men in a canoe,
came rowing along the north side of the island, where they never
used to come before, and landed, about an hour after sunrise, at a
convenient place, about a mile from the habitation of the two
Englishmen, where this escaped man had been kept. As the chief
Spaniard said, had they been all there the damage would not have
been so much, for not a man of them would have escaped; but the
case differed now very much, for two men to fifty was too much
odds. The two men had the happiness to discover them about a league
off, so that it was above an hour before they landed; and as they
landed a mile from their huts, it was some time before they could
come at them. Now, having great reason to believe that they were
betrayed, the first thing they did was to bind the two slaves which
were left, and cause two of the three men whom they brought with
the women (who, it seems, proved very faithful to them) to lead
them, with their two wives, and whatever they could carry away with
them, to their retired places in the woods, which I have spoken of
above, and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot, till they
heard farther. In the next place, seeing the savages were all come
on shore, and that they had bent their course directly that way,
they opened the fences where the milch cows were kept, and drove
them all out; leaving their goats to straggle in the woods, whither
they pleased, that the savages might think they were all bred wild;
but the rogue who came with them was too cunning for that, and gave
them an account of it all, for they went directly to the place.</p>

<p>When the two poor frightened men had secured their wives and
goods, they sent the other slave they had of the three who came
with the women, and who was at their place by accident, away to the
Spaniards with all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy
help, and, in the meantime, they took their arms and what
ammunition they had, and retreated towards the place in the wood
where their wives were sent; keeping at a distance, yet so that
they might see, if possible, which way the savages took. They had
not gone far but that from a rising ground they could see the
little army of their enemies come on directly to their habitation,
and, in a moment more, could see all their huts and household stuff
flaming up together, to their great grief and mortification; for
this was a great loss to them, irretrievable, indeed, for some
time. They kept their station for a while, till they found the
savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all over the place,
rummaging every way, and every place they could think of, in search
of prey; and in particular for the people, of whom now it plainly
appeared they had intelligence.</p>

<p>The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not secure
where they stood, because it was likely some of the wild people
might come that way, and they might come too many together, thought
it proper to make another retreat about half a mile farther;
believing, as it afterwards happened, that the further they
strolled, the fewer would be together. Their next halt was at the
entrance into a very thick-grown part of the woods, and where an
old trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and very large; and in
this tree they both took their standing, resolving to see there
what might offer. They had not stood there long before two of the
savages appeared running directly that way, as if they had already
had notice where they stood, and were coming up to attack them; and
a little way farther they espied three more coming after them, and
five more beyond them, all coming the same way; besides which, they
saw seven or eight more at a distance, running another way; for in
a word, they ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their
game.</p>

<p>The poor men were now in great perplexity whether they should
stand and keep their posture or fly; but after a very short debate
with themselves, they considered that if the savages ranged the
country thus before help came, they might perhaps find their
retreat in the woods, and then all would be lost; so they resolved
to stand them there, and if they were too many to deal with, then
they would get up to the top of the tree, from whence they doubted
not to defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as their
ammunition lasted, though all the savages that were landed, which
was near fifty, were to attack them.</p>

<p>Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether they
should fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take
the middle party, by which the two and the five that followed would
be separated; at length they resolved to let the first two pass by,
unless they should spy them the tree, and come to attack them. The
first two savages confirmed them also in this resolution, by
turning a little from them towards another part of the wood; but
the three, and the five after them, came forward directly to the
tree, as if they had known the Englishmen were there. Seeing them
come so straight towards them, they resolved to take them in a line
as they came: and as they resolved to fire but one at a time,
perhaps the first shot might hit them all three; for which purpose
the man who was to fire put three or four small bullets into his
piece; and having a fair loophole, as it were, from a broken hole
in the tree, he took a sure aim, without being seen, waiting till
they were within about thirty yards of the tree, so that he could
not miss.</p>

<p>While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on, they
plainly saw that one of the three was the runaway savage that had
escaped from them; and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved
that, if possible, he should not escape, though they should both
fire; so the other stood ready with his piece, that if he did not
drop at the first shot, he should be sure to have a second. But the
first was too good a marksman to miss his aim; for as the savages
kept near one another, a little behind in a line, he fired, and hit
two of them directly; the foremost was killed outright, being shot
in the head; the second, which was the runaway Indian, was shot
through the body, and fell, but was not quite dead; and the third
had a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that
went through the body of the second; and being dreadfully
frightened, though not so much hurt, sat down upon the ground,
screaming and yelling in a hideous manner.</p>

<p>The five that were behind, more frightened with the noise than
sensible of the danger, stood still at first; for the woods made
the sound a thousand times bigger than it really was, the echoes
rattling from one side to another, and the fowls rising from all
parts, screaming, and every sort making a different noise,
according to their kind; just as it was when I fired the first gun
that perhaps was ever shot off in the island.</p>

<p>However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the
matter was, came on unconcerned, till they came to the place where
their companions lay in a condition miserable enough. Here the poor
ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were within reach of the
same mischief, stood all together over the wounded man, talking,
and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him how he came to be hurt;
and who, it is very rational to believe, told them that a flash of
fire first, and immediately after that thunder from their gods, had
killed those two and wounded him. This, I say, is rational; for
nothing is more certain than that, as they saw no man near them, so
they had never heard a gun in all their lives, nor so much as heard
of a gun; neither knew they anything of killing and wounding at a
distance with fire and bullets: if they had, one might reasonably
believe they would not have stood so unconcerned to view the fate
of their fellows, without some apprehensions of their own.</p>

<p>Our two men, as they confessed to me, were grieved to be obliged
to kill so many poor creatures, who had no notion of their danger;
yet, having them all thus in their power, and the first having
loaded his piece again, resolved to let fly both together among
them; and singling out, by agreement, which to aim at, they shot
together, and killed, or very much wounded, four of them; the
fifth, frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell with the
rest; so that our men, seeing them all fall together, thought they
had killed them all.</p>

<p>The belief that the savages were all killed made our two men
come boldly out from the tree before they had charged their guns,
which was a wrong step; and they were under some surprise when they
came to the place, and found no less than four of them alive, and
of them two very little hurt, and one not at all. This obliged them
to fall upon them with the stocks of their muskets; and first they
made sure of the runaway savage, that had been the cause of all the
mischief, and of another that was hurt in the knee, and put them
out of their pain; then the man that was not hurt at all came and
kneeled down to them, with his two hands held up, and made piteous
moans to them, by gestures and signs, for his life, but could not
say one word to them that they could understand. However, they made
signs to him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard by; and one of
the Englishmen, with a piece of rope-yarn, which he had by great
chance in his pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and there they
left him; and with what speed they could made after the other two,
which were gone before, fearing they, or any more of them, should
find way to their covered place in the woods, where their wives,
and the few goods they had left, lay. They came once in sight of
the two men, but it was at a great distance; however, they had the
satisfaction to see them cross over a valley towards the sea, quite
the contrary way from that which led to their retreat, which they
were afraid of; and being satisfied with that, they went back to
the tree where they left their prisoner, who, as they supposed, was
delivered by his comrades, for he was gone, and the two pieces of
rope-yarn with which they had bound him lay just at the foot of the
tree.</p>

<p>They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing what
course to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in what number;
so they resolved to go away to the place where their wives were, to
see if all was well there, and to make them easy. These were in
fright enough, to be sure; for though the savages were their own
countrymen, yet they were most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps
the more for the knowledge they had of them. When they came there,
they found the savages had been in the wood, and very near that
place, but had not found it; for it was indeed inaccessible, from
the trees standing so thick, unless the persons seeking it had been
directed by those that knew it, which these did not: they found,
therefore, everything very safe, only the women in a terrible
fright. While they were here they had the comfort to have seven of
the Spaniards come to their assistance; the other ten, with their
servants, and Friday's father, were gone in a body to defend their
bower, and the corn and cattle that were kept there, in case the
savages should have roved over to that side of the country, but
they did not spread so far. With the seven Spaniards came one of
the three savages, who, as I said, were their prisoners formerly;
and with them also came the savage whom the Englishmen had left
bound hand and foot at the tree; for it seems they came that way,
saw the slaughter of the seven men, and unbound the eighth, and
brought him along with them; where, however, they were obliged to
bind again, as they had the two others who were left when the third
ran away.</p>

<p>The prisoners now began to be a burden to them; and they were so
afraid of their escaping, that they were once resolving to kill
them all, believing they were under an absolute necessity to do so
for their own preservation. However, the chief of the Spaniards
would not consent to it, but ordered, for the present, that they
should be sent out of the way to my old cave in the valley, and be
kept there, with two Spaniards to guard them, and have food for
their subsistence, which was done; and they were bound there hand
and foot for that night.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so encouraged,
that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any longer there;
but taking five of the Spaniards, and themselves, with four muskets
and a pistol among them, and two stout quarter-staves, away they
went in quest of the savages. And first they came to the tree where
the men lay that had been killed; but it was easy to see that some
more of the savages had been there, for they had attempted to carry
their dead men away, and had dragged two of them a good way, but
had given it over. From thence they advanced to the first rising
ground, where they had stood and seen their camp destroyed, and
where they had the mortification still to see some of the smoke;
but neither could they here see any of the savages. They then
resolved, though with all possible caution, to go forward towards
their ruined plantation; but, a little before they came thither,
coming in sight of the sea-shore, they saw plainly the savages all
embarked again in their canoes, in order to be gone. They seemed
sorry at first that there was no way to come at them, to give them
a parting blow; but, upon the whole, they were very well satisfied
to be rid of them.</p>

<p>The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their
improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help them
to rebuild, and assist them with needful supplies. Their three
countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the least inclination
to do any good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for they, living
remote eastward, knew nothing of the matter till all was over),
came and offered their help and assistance, and did, very friendly,
work for several days to restore their habitation and make
necessaries for them. And thus in a little time they were set upon
their legs again.</p>

<p>About two days after this they had the farther satisfaction of
seeing three of the savages' canoes come driving on shore, and, at
some distance from them, two drowned men, by which they had reason
to believe that they had met with a storm at sea, which had overset
some of them; for it had blown very hard the night after they went
off. However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand, enough
of them escaped to inform the rest, as well of what they had done
as of what had happened to them; and to whet them on to another
enterprise of the same nature, which they, it seems, resolved to
attempt, with sufficient force to carry all before them; for except
what the first man had told them of inhabitants, they could say
little of it of their own knowledge, for they never saw one man;
and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, they had no other
witness to confirm it to, them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V&mdash;A GREAT VICTORY</h3>

<p>It was five or six months after this before they heard any more
of the savages, in which time our men were in hopes they had either
forgot their former bad luck, or given over hopes of better; when,
on a sudden, they were invaded with a most formidable fleet of no
less than eight-and-twenty canoes, full of savages, armed with bows
and arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, and such like engines of
war; and they brought such numbers with them, that, in short, it
put all our people into the utmost consternation.</p>

<p>As they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost
side of the island, our men had that night to consult and consider
what to do. In the first place, knowing that their being entirely
concealed was their only safety before and would be much more so
now, while the number of their enemies would be so great, they
resolved, first of all, to take down the huts which were built for
the two Englishmen, and drive away their goats to the old cave;
because they supposed the savages would go directly thither, as
soon as it was day, to play the old game over again, though they
did not now land within two leagues of it. In the next place, they
drove away all the flocks of goats they had at the old bower, as I
called it, which belonged to the Spaniards; and, in short, left as
little appearance of inhabitants anywhere as was possible; and the
next morning early they posted themselves, with all their force, at
the plantation of the two men, to wait for their coming. As they
guessed, so it happened: these new invaders, leaving their canoes
at the east end of the island, came ranging along the shore,
directly towards the place, to the number of two hundred and fifty,
as near as our men could judge. Our army was but small indeed; but,
that which was worse, they had not arms for all their number. The
whole account, it seems, stood thus: first, as to men, seventeen
Spaniards, five Englishmen, old Friday, the three slaves taken with
the women, who proved very faithful, and three other slaves, who
lived with the Spaniards. To arm these, they had eleven muskets,
five pistols, three fowling-pieces, five muskets or fowling-pieces
which were taken by me from the mutinous seamen whom I reduced, two
swords, and three old halberds.</p>

<p>To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusee; but
they had each a halberd, or a long staff, like a quarter-staff,
with a great spike of iron fastened into each end of it, and by his
side a hatchet; also every one of our men had a hatchet. Two of the
women could not be prevailed upon but they would come into the
fight, and they had bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken
from the savages when the first action happened, which I have
spoken of, where the Indians fought with one another; and the women
had hatchets too.</p>

<p>The chief Spaniard, whom I described so often, commanded the
whole; and Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for
wickedness, was a most daring, bold fellow, commanded under him.
The savages came forward like lions; and our men, which was the
worst of their fate, had no advantage in their situation; only that
Will Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was
planted just behind a small thicket of bushes as an advanced guard,
with orders to let the first of them pass by and then fire into the
middle of them, and as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat as
nimbly as he could round a part of the wood, and so come in behind
the Spaniards, where they stood, having a thicket of trees before
them.</p>

<p>When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every way in
heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will Atkins let about fifty
of them pass by him; then seeing the rest come in a very thick
throng, he orders three of his men to fire, having loaded their
muskets with six or seven bullets apiece, about as big as large
pistol-bullets. How many they killed or wounded they knew not, but
the consternation and surprise was inexpressible among the savages;
they were frightened to the last degree to hear such a dreadful
noise, and see their men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody
that did it; when, in the middle of their fright, Will Atkins and
his other three let fly again among the thickest of them; and in
less than a minute the first three, being loaded again, gave them a
third volley.</p>

<p>Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately, as soon as they
had fired, as they were ordered to do, or had the rest of the body
been at hand to have poured in their shot continually, the savages
had been effectually routed; for the terror that was among them
came principally from this, that they were killed by the gods with
thunder and lightning, and could see nobody that hurt them. But
Will Atkins, staying to load again, discovered the cheat: some of
the savages who were at a distance spying them, came upon them
behind; and though Atkins and his men fired at them also, two or
three times, and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they
could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his
fellow-Englishmen with their arrows, as they did afterwards one
Spaniard, and one of the Indian slaves who came with the women.
This slave was a most gallant fellow, and fought most desperately,
killing five of them with his own hand, having no weapon but one of
the armed staves and a hatchet.</p>

<p>Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two other
men killed, retreated to a rising ground in the wood; and the
Spaniards, after firing three volleys upon them, retreated also;
for their number was so great, and they were so desperate, that
though above fifty of them were killed, and more than as many
wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our men, fearless of
danger, and shot their arrows like a cloud; and it was observed
that their wounded men, who were not quite disabled, were made
outrageous by their wounds, and fought like madmen.</p>

<p>When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the
Englishman that were killed behind them: and the savages, when they
came up to them, killed them over again in a wretched manner,
breaking their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs and wooden
swords, like true savages; but finding our men were gone, they did
not seem inclined to pursue them, but drew themselves up in a ring,
which is, it seems, their custom, and shouted twice, in token of
their victory; after which, they had the mortification to see
several of their wounded men fall, dying with the mere loss of
blood.</p>

<p>The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together
upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, would have had
them march and charge again all together at once: but the Spaniard
replied, "Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded men fight; let
them alone till morning; all the wounded men will be stiff and sore
with their wounds, and faint with the loss of blood; and so we
shall have the fewer to engage." This advice was good: but Will
Atkins replied merrily, "That is true, seignior, and so shall I
too; and that is the reason I would go on while I am warm." "Well,
Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, "you have behaved gallantly,
and done your part; we will fight for you if you cannot come on;
but I think it best to stay till morning:" so they waited.</p>

<p>But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the
savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded men, and a
great noise and hurry among them where they lay, they afterwards
resolved to fall upon them in the night, especially if they could
come to give them but one volley before they were discovered, which
they had a fair opportunity to do; for one of the Englishmen in
whose quarter it was where the fight began, led them round between
the woods and the seaside westward, and then turning short south,
they came so near where the thickest of them lay, that before they
were seen or heard eight of them fired in among them, and did
dreadful execution upon them; in half a minute more eight others
fired after them, pouring in their small shot in such a quantity
that abundance were killed and wounded; and all this while they
were not able to see who hurt them, or which way to fly.</p>

<p>The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, and then
divided themselves into three bodies, and resolved to fall in among
them all together. They had in each body eight persons, that is to
say, twenty-two men and the two women, who, by the way, fought
desperately. They divided the firearms equally in each party, as
well as the halberds and staves. They would have had the women kept
back, but they said they were resolved to die with their husbands.
Having thus formed their little army, they marched out from among
the trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting and
hallooing as loud as they could; the savages stood all together,
but were in the utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our men
shouting from three quarters together. They would have fought if
they had seen us; for as soon as we came near enough to be seen,
some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not
dangerously. But our men gave them no time, but running up to them,
fired among them three ways, and then fell in with the butt-ends of
their muskets, their swords, armed staves, and hatchets, and laid
about them so well that, in a word, they set up a dismal screaming
and howling, flying to save their lives which way soever they
could.</p>

<p>Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or mortally
wounded in the two fights about one hundred and eighty of them; the
rest, being frightened out of their wits, scoured through the woods
and over the hills, with all the speed that fear and nimble feet
could help them to; and as we did not trouble ourselves much to
pursue them, they got all together to the seaside, where they
landed, and where their canoes lay. But their disaster was not at
an end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from
the sea, so that it was impossible for them to go off; nay, the
storm continuing all night, when the tide came up their canoes were
most of them driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore
that it required infinite toil to get them off; and some of them
were even dashed to pieces against the beach. Our men, though glad
of their victory, yet got little rest that night; but having
refreshed themselves as well as they could, they resolved to march
to that part of the island where the savages were fled, and see
what posture they were in. This necessarily led them over the place
where the fight had been, and where they found several of the poor
creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering life; a sight
disagreeable enough to generous minds, for a truly great man though
obliged by the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no delight
in his misery. However, there was no need to give any orders in
this case; for their own savages, who were their servants,
despatched these poor creatures with their hatchets.</p>

<p>At length they came in view of the place where the more
miserable remains of the savages' army lay, where there appeared
about a hundred still; their posture was generally sitting upon the
ground, with their knees up towards their mouth, and the head put
between the two hands, leaning down upon the knees. When our men
came within two musket-shots of them, the Spaniard governor ordered
two muskets to be fired without ball, to alarm them; this he did,
that by their countenance he might know what to expect, whether
they were still in heart to fight, or were so heartily beaten as to
be discouraged, and so he might manage accordingly. This stratagem
took: for as soon as the savages heard the first gun, and saw the
flash of the second, they started up upon their feet in the
greatest consternation imaginable; and as our men advanced swiftly
towards them, they all ran screaming and yelling away, with a kind
of howling noise, which our men did not understand, and had never
heard before; and thus they ran up the hills into the country.</p>

<p>At first our men had much rather the weather had been calm, and
they had all gone away to sea: but they did not then consider that
this might probably have been the occasion of their coming again in
such multitudes as not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so
many and so often as would quite desolate the island, and starve
them. Will Atkins, therefore, who notwithstanding his wound kept
always with them, proved the best counsellor in this case: his
advice was, to take the advantage that offered, and step in between
them and their boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of ever
returning any more to plague the island. They consulted long about
this; and some were against it for fear of making the wretches fly
to the woods and live there desperate, and so they should have them
to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to stir out about their
business, and have their plantations continually rifled, all their
tame goats destroyed, and, in short, be reduced to a life of
continual distress.</p>

<p>Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a hundred
men than with a hundred nations; that, as they must destroy their
boats, so they must destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed
themselves. In a word, he showed them the necessity of it so
plainly that they all came into it; so they went to work
immediately with the boats, and getting some dry wood together from
a dead tree, they tried to set some of them on fire, but they were
so wet that they would not burn; however, the fire so burned the
upper part that it soon made them unfit for use at sea.</p>

<p>When the Indians saw what they were about, some of them came
running out of the woods, and coming as near as they could to our
men, kneeled down and cried, "Oa, Oa, Waramokoa," and some other
words of their language, which none of the others understood
anything of; but as they made pitiful gestures and strange noises,
it was easy to understand they begged to have their boats spared,
and that they would be gone, and never come there again. But our
men were now satisfied that they had no way to preserve themselves,
or to save their colony, but effectually to prevent any of these
people from ever going home again; depending upon this, that if
even so much as one of them got back into their country to tell the
story, the colony was undone; so that, letting them know that they
should not have any mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and
destroyed every one that the storm had not destroyed before; at the
sight of which, the savages raised a hideous cry in the woods,
which our people heard plain enough, after which they ran about the
island like distracted men, so that, in a word, our men did not
really know what at first to do with them. Nor did the Spaniards,
with all their prudence, consider that while they made those people
thus desperate, they ought to have kept a good guard at the same
time upon their plantations; for though it is true they had driven
away their cattle, and the Indians did not find out their main
retreat, I mean my old castle at the hill, nor the cave in the
valley, yet they found out my plantation at the bower, and pulled
it all to pieces, and all the fences and planting about it; trod
all the corn under foot, tore up the vines and grapes, being just
then almost ripe, and did our men inestimable damage, though to
themselves not one farthing's worth of service.</p>

<p>Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet
they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and down;
for as they were too nimble of foot for our people when they found
them single, so our men durst not go abroad single, for fear of
being surrounded with their numbers. The best was they had no
weapons; for though they had bows, they had no arrows left, nor any
materials to make any; nor had they any edge-tool among them. The
extremity and distress they were reduced to was great, and indeed
deplorable; but, at the same time, our men were also brought to
very bad circumstances by them, for though their retreats were
preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and their harvest
spoiled, and what to do, or which way to turn themselves, they knew
not. The only refuge they had now was the stock of cattle they had
in the valley by the cave, and some little corn which grew there,
and the plantation of the three Englishmen. Will Atkins and his
comrades were now reduced to two; one of them being killed by an
arrow, which struck him on the side of his head, just under the
temple, so that he never spoke more; and it was very remarkable
that this was the same barbarous fellow that cut the poor savage
slave with his hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have
murdered the Spaniards.</p>

<p>I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than
mine was at any time, after I first discovered the grains of barley
and rice, and got into the manner of planting and raising my corn,
and my tame cattle; for now they had, as I may say, a hundred
wolves upon the island, which would devour everything they could
come at, yet could be hardly come at themselves.</p>

<p>When they saw what their circumstances were, the first thing
they concluded was, that they would, if possible, drive the savages
up to the farther part of the island, south-west, that if any more
came on shore they might not find one another; then, that they
would daily hunt and harass them, and kill as many of them as they
could come at, till they had reduced their number; and if they
could at last tame them, and bring them to anything, they would
give them corn, and teach them how to plant, and live upon their
daily labour. In order to do this, they so followed them, and so
terrified them with their guns, that in a few days, if any of them
fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would fall
down for fear. So dreadfully frightened were they that they kept
out of sight farther and farther; till at last our men followed
them, and almost every day killing or wounding some of them, they
kept up in the woods or hollow places so much, that it reduced them
to the utmost misery for want of food; and many were afterwards
found dead in the woods, without any hurt, absolutely starved to
death.</p>

<p>When our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and pity
moved them, especially the generous-minded Spaniard governor; and
he proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive and bring him
to understand what they meant, so far as to be able to act as
interpreter, and go among them and see if they might be brought to
some conditions that might be depended upon, to save their lives
and do us no harm.</p>

<p>It was some while before any of them could be taken; but being
weak and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised and made a
prisoner. He was sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink;
but finding himself kindly used, and victuals given to him, and no
violence offered him, he at last grew tractable, and came to
himself. They often brought old Friday to talk to him, who always
told him how kind the others would be to them all; that they would
not only save their lives, but give them part of the island to live
in, provided they would give satisfaction that they would keep in
their own bounds, and not come beyond it to injure or prejudice
others; and that they should have corn given them to plant and make
it grow for their bread, and some bread given them for their
present subsistence; and old Friday bade the fellow go and talk
with the rest of his countrymen, and see what they said to it;
assuring them that, if they did not agree immediately, they should
be all destroyed.</p>

<p>The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in number to
about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the first offer,
and begged to have some food given them; upon which twelve
Spaniards and two Englishmen, well armed, with three Indian slaves
and old Friday, marched to the place where they were. The three
Indian slaves carried them a large quantity of bread, some rice
boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun, and three live goats; and
they were ordered to go to the side of a hill, where they sat down,
ate their provisions very thankfully, and were the most faithful
fellows to their words that could be thought of; for, except when
they came to beg victuals and directions, they never came out of
their bounds; and there they lived when I came to the island and I
went to see them. They had taught them both to plant corn, make
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them: they wanted nothing but
wives in order for them soon to become a nation. They were confined
to a neck of land, surrounded with high rocks behind them, and
lying plain towards the sea before them, on the south-east corner
of the island. They had land enough, and it was very good and
fruitful; about a mile and a half broad, and three or four miles in
length. Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as I made
for myself, and gave among them twelve hatchets and three or four
knives; and there they lived, the most subjected, innocent
creatures that ever were heard of.</p>

<p>After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity with
respect to the savages, till I came to revisit them, which was
about two years after; not but that, now and then, some canoes of
savages came on shore for their triumphal, unnatural feasts; but as
they were of several nations, and perhaps had never heard of those
that came before, or the reason of it, they did not make any search
or inquiry after their countrymen; and if they had, it would have
been very hard to have found them out.</p>

<p>Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that happened
to them till my return, at least that was worth notice. The Indians
were wonderfully civilised by them, and they frequently went among
them; but they forbid, on pain of death, any one of the Indians
coming to them, because they would not have their settlement
betrayed again. One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, but they soon
outdid their masters: for they made abundance of ingenious things
in wicker-work, particularly baskets, sieves, bird-cages,
cupboards, &amp;c.; as also chairs, stools, beds, couches, being
very ingenious at such work when they were once put in the way of
it.</p>

<p>My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we
furnished them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pick-axes,
and all things of that kind which they could want. With the help of
those tools they were so very handy that they came at last to build
up their huts or houses very handsomely, raddling or working it up
like basket-work all the way round. This piece of ingenuity,
although it looked very odd, was an exceeding good fence, as well
against heat as against all sorts of vermin; and our men were so
taken with it that they got the Indians to come and do the like for
them; so that when I came to see the two Englishmen's colonies,
they looked at a distance as if they all lived like bees in a
hive.</p>

<p>As for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious,
useful, and sober fellow, he had made himself such a tent of
basket-work as I believe was never seen; it was one hundred and
twenty paces round on the outside, as I measured by my steps; the
walls were as close worked as a basket, in panels or squares of
thirty-two in number, and very strong, standing about seven feet
high; in the middle was another not above twenty-two paces round,
but built stronger, being octagon in its form, and in the eight
corners stood eight very strong posts; round the top of which he
laid strong pieces, knit together with wooden pins, from which he
raised a pyramid for a handsome roof of eight rafters, joined
together very well, though he had no nails, and only a few iron
spikes, which he made himself, too, out of the old iron that I had
left there. Indeed, this fellow showed abundance of ingenuity in
several things which he had no knowledge of: he made him a forge,
with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the fire; he made himself
charcoal for his work; and he formed out of the iron crows a
middling good anvil to hammer upon: in this manner he made many
things, but especially hooks, staples, and spikes, bolts and
hinges. But to return to the house: after he had pitched the roof
of his innermost tent, he worked it up between the rafters with
basket-work, so firm, and thatched that over again so ingeniously
with rice-straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, which
covered the top, that his house was as dry as if it had been tiled
or slated. He owned, indeed, that the savages had made the
basket-work for him. The outer circuit was covered as a lean-to all
round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the
thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner house, being about
twenty feet distant, so that there was a space like a walk within
the outer wicker-wall, and without the inner, near twenty feet
wide.</p>

<p>The inner place he partitioned off with the same wickerwork, but
much fairer, and divided into six apartments, so that he had six
rooms on a floor, and out of every one of these there was a door:
first into the entry, or coming into the main tent, another door
into the main tent, and another door into the space or walk that
was round it; so that walk was also divided into six equal parts,
which served not only for a retreat, but to store up any
necessaries which the family had occasion for. These six spaces not
taking up the whole circumference, what other apartments the outer
circle had were thus ordered: As soon as you were in at the door of
the outer circle you had a short passage straight before you to the
door of the inner house; but on either side was a wicker partition
and a door in it, by which you went first into a large room or
storehouse, twenty feet wide and about thirty feet long, and
through that into another not quite so long; so that in the outer
circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be come
at through the apartments of the inner tent, and served as closets
or retiring rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle;
and four large warehouses, or barns, or what you please to call
them, which went through one another, two on either hand of the
passage, that led through the outer door to the inner tent. Such a
piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the world, nor a
house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so built. In this
great bee-hive lived the three families, that is to say, Will
Atkins and his companion; the third was killed, but his wife
remained with three children, and the other two were not at all
backward to give the widow her full share of everything, I mean as
to their corn, milk, grapes, &amp;c., and when they killed a kid,
or found a turtle on the shore; so that they all lived well enough;
though it was true they were not so industrious as the other two,
as has been observed already.</p>

<p>One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that as for
religion, I do not know that there was anything of that kind among
them; they often, indeed, put one another in mind that there was a
God, by the very common method of seamen, swearing by His name: nor
were their poor ignorant savage wives much better for having been
married to Christians, as we must call them; for as they knew very
little of God themselves, so they were utterly incapable of
entering into any discourse with their wives about a God, or to
talk anything to them concerning religion.</p>

<p>The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the wives had
made from them was, that they had taught them to speak English
pretty well; and most of their children, who were near twenty in
all, were taught to speak English too, from their first learning to
speak, though they at first spoke it in a very broken manner, like
their mothers. None of these children were above six years old when
I came thither, for it was not much above seven years since they
had fetched these five savage ladies over; they had all children,
more or less: the mothers were all a good sort of well-governed,
quiet, laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to one another,
mighty observant, and subject to their masters (I cannot call them
husbands), and lacked nothing but to be well instructed in the
Christian religion, and to be legally married; both of which were
happily brought about afterwards by my means, or at least in
consequence of my coming among them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE FRENCH CLERGYMAN'S COUNSEL</h3>

<p>Having thus given an account of the colony in general, and
pretty much of my runagate Englishmen, I must say something of the
Spaniards, who were the main body of the family, and in whose story
there are some incidents also remarkable enough.</p>

<p>I had a great many discourses with them about their
circumstances when they were among the savages. They told me
readily that they had no instances to give of their application or
ingenuity in that country; that they were a poor, miserable,
dejected handful of people; that even if means had been put into
their hands, yet they had so abandoned themselves to despair, and
were so sunk under the weight of their misfortune, that they
thought of nothing but starving. One of them, a grave and sensible
man, told me he was convinced they were in the wrong; that it was
not the part of wise men to give themselves up to their misery, but
always to take hold of the helps which reason offered, as well for
present support as for future deliverance: he told me that grief
was the most senseless, insignificant passion in the world, for
that it regarded only things past, which were generally impossible
to be recalled or to be remedied, but had no views of things to
come, and had no share in anything that looked like deliverance,
but rather added to the affliction than proposed a remedy; and upon
this he repeated a Spanish proverb, which, though I cannot repeat
in the same words that he spoke it in, yet I remember I made it
into an English proverb of my own, thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"In trouble to be troubled,<br>
Is to have your trouble doubled."</blockquote>

<p>He then ran on in remarks upon all the little improvements I had
made in my solitude: my unwearied application, as he called it; and
how I had made a condition, which in its circumstances was at first
much worse than theirs, a thousand times more happy than theirs
was, even now when they were all together. He told me it was
remarkable that Englishmen had a greater presence of mind in their
distress than any people that ever he met with; that their unhappy
nation and the Portuguese were the worst men in the world to
struggle with misfortunes; for that their first step in dangers,
after the common efforts were over, was to despair, lie down under
it, and die, without rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies
for escape.</p>

<p>I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly; that they
were cast upon the shore without necessaries, without supply of
food, or present sustenance till they could provide for it; that,
it was true, I had this further disadvantage and discomfort, that I
was alone; but then the supplies I had providentially thrown into
my hands, by the unexpected driving of the ship on the shore, was
such a help as would have encouraged any creature in the world to
have applied himself as I had done. "Seignior," says the Spaniard,
"had we poor Spaniards been in your case, we should never have got
half those things out of the ship, as you did: nay," says he, "we
should never have found means to have got a raft to carry them, or
to have got the raft on shore without boat or sail: and how much
less should we have done if any of us had been alone!" Well, I
desired him to abate his compliments, and go on with the history of
their coming on shore, where they landed. He told me they unhappily
landed at a place where there were people without provisions;
whereas, had they had the common sense to put off to sea again, and
gone to another island a little further, they had found provisions,
though without people: there being an island that way, as they had
been told, where there were provisions, though no people&mdash;that
is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been
there, and had filled the island with goats and hogs at several
times, where they had bred in such multitudes, and where turtle and
sea-fowls were in such plenty, that they could have been in no want
of flesh, though they had found no bread; whereas, here they were
only sustained with a few roots and herbs, which they understood
not, and which had no substance in them, and which the inhabitants
gave them sparingly enough; and they could treat them no better,
unless they would turn cannibals and eat men's flesh.</p>

<p>They gave me an account how many ways they strove to civilise
the savages they were with, and to teach them rational customs in
the ordinary way of living, but in vain; and how they retorted upon
them as unjust that they who came there for assistance and support
should attempt to set up for instructors to those that gave them
food; intimating, it seems, that none should set up for the
instructors of others but those who could live without them. They
gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were driven to; how
sometimes they were many days without any food at all, the island
they were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived more
indolent, and for that reason were less supplied with the
necessaries of life, than they had reason to believe others were in
the same part of the world; and yet they found that these savages
were less ravenous and voracious than those who had better supplies
of food. Also, they added, they could not but see with what
demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the governing providence of
God directs the events of things in this world, which, they said,
appeared in their circumstances: for if, pressed by the hardships
they were under, and the barrenness of the country where they were,
they had searched after a better to live in, they had then been out
of the way of the relief that happened to them by my means.</p>

<p>They then gave me an account how the savages whom they lived
amongst expected them to go out with them into their wars; and, it
was true, that as they had firearms with them, had they not had the
disaster to lose their ammunition, they could have been serviceable
not only to their friends, but have made themselves terrible both
to friends and enemies; but being without powder and shot, and yet
in a condition that they could not in reason decline to go out with
their landlords to their wars; so when they came into the field of
battle they were in a worse condition than the savages themselves,
for they had neither bows nor arrows, nor could they use those the
savages gave them. So they could do nothing but stand still and be
wounded with arrows, till they came up to the teeth of the enemy;
and then, indeed, the three halberds they had were of use to them;
and they would often drive a whole little army before them with
those halberds, and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their
muskets. But for all this they were sometimes surrounded with
multitudes, and in great danger from their arrows, till at last
they found the way to make themselves large targets of wood, which
they covered with skins of wild beasts, whose names they knew not,
and these covered them from the arrows of the savages: that,
notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in great danger; and
five of them were once knocked down together with the clubs of the
savages, which was the time when one of them was taken
prisoner&mdash;that is to say, the Spaniard whom I relieved. At
first they thought he had been killed; but when they afterwards
heard he was taken prisoner, they were under the greatest grief
imaginable, and would willingly have all ventured their lives to
have rescued him.</p>

<p>They told me that when they were so knocked down, the rest of
their company rescued them, and stood over them fighting till they
were come to themselves, all but him whom they thought had been
dead; and then they made their way with their halberds and pieces,
standing close together in a line, through a body of above a
thousand savages, beating down all that came in their way, got the
victory over their enemies, but to their great sorrow, because it
was with the loss of their friend, whom the other party finding
alive, carried off with some others, as I gave an account before.
They described, most affectionately, how they were surprised with
joy at the return of their friend and companion in misery, who they
thought had been devoured by wild beasts of the worst
kind&mdash;wild men; and yet, how more and more they were surprised
with the account he gave them of his errand, and that there was a
Christian in any place near, much more one that was able, and had
humanity enough, to contribute to their deliverance.</p>

<p>They described how they were astonished at the sight of the
relief I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves of
bread&mdash;things they had not seen since their coming to that
miserable place; how often they crossed it and blessed it as bread
sent from heaven; and what a reviving cordial it was to their
spirits to taste it, as also the other things I had sent for their
supply; and, after all, they would have told me something of the
joy they were in at the sight of a boat and pilots, to carry them
away to the person and place from whence all these new comforts
came. But it was impossible to express it by words, for their
excessive joy naturally driving them to unbecoming extravagances,
they had no way to describe them but by telling me they bordered
upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to their passions suitable
to the sense that was upon them; that in some it worked one way and
in some another; and that some of them, through a surprise of joy,
would burst into tears, others be stark mad, and others immediately
faint. This discourse extremely affected me, and called to my mind
Friday's ecstasy when he met his father, and the poor people's
ecstasy when I took them up at sea after their ship was on fire;
the joy of the mate of the ship when he found himself delivered in
the place where he expected to perish; and my own joy, when, after
twenty-eight years' captivity, I found a good ship ready to carry
me to my own country. All these things made me more sensible of the
relation of these poor men, and more affected with it.</p>

<p>Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found them,
I must relate the heads of what I did for these people, and the
condition in which I left them. It was their opinion, and mine too,
that they would be troubled no more with the savages, or if they
were, they would be able to cut them off, if they were twice as
many as before; so they had no concern about that. Then I entered
into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom I call governor,
about their stay in the island; for as I was not come to carry any
of them off, so it would not be just to carry off some and leave
others, who, perhaps, would be unwilling to stay if their strength
was diminished. On the other hand, I told them I came to establish
them there, not to remove them; and then I let them know that I had
brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them; that I had been at
a great charge to supply them with all things necessary, as well
for their convenience as their defence; and that I had such and
such particular persons with me, as well to increase and recruit
their number, as by the particular necessary employments which they
were bred to, being artificers, to assist them in those things in
which at present they were in want.</p>

<p>They were all together when I talked thus to them; and before I
delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked them, one by
one, if they had entirely forgot and buried the first animosities
that had been among them, and would shake hands with one another,
and engage in a strict friendship and union of interest, that so
there might be no more misunderstandings and jealousies.</p>

<p>Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good humour, said
they had met with affliction enough to make them all sober, and
enemies enough to make them all friends; that, for his part, he
would live and die with them, and was so far from designing
anything against the Spaniards, that he owned they had done nothing
to him but what his own mad humour made necessary, and what he
would have done, and perhaps worse, in their case; and that he
would ask them pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish and brutish
things he had done to them, and was very willing and desirous of
living in terms of entire friendship and union with them, and would
do anything that lay in his power to convince them of it; and as
for going to England, he cared not if he did not go thither these
twenty years.</p>

<p>The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first disarmed and
excluded Will Atkins and his two countrymen for their ill conduct,
as they had let me know, and they appealed to me for the necessity
they were under to do so; but that Will Atkins had behaved himself
so bravely in the great fight they had with the savages, and on
several occasions since, and had showed himself so faithful to, and
concerned for, the general interest of them all, that they had
forgotten all that was past, and thought he merited as much to be
trusted with arms and supplied with necessaries as any of them;
that they had testified their satisfaction in him by committing the
command to him next to the governor himself; and as they had entire
confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they acknowledged they
had merited that confidence by all the methods that honest men
could merit to be valued and trusted; and they most heartily
embraced the occasion of giving me this assurance, that they would
never have any interest separate from one another.</p>

<p>Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we
appointed the next day to dine all together; and, indeed, we made a
splendid feast. I caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on
shore and dress our dinner, and the old cook's mate we had on shore
assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of good beef and four
pieces of pork, out of the ship's provisions, with our punch-bowl
and materials to fill it; and in particular I gave them ten bottles
of French claret, and ten bottles of English beer; things that
neither the Spaniards nor the English had tasted for many years,
and which it may be supposed they were very glad of. The Spaniards
added to our feast five whole kids, which the cooks roasted; and
three of them were sent, covered up close, on board the ship to the
seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat from on shore, as we
did with their salt meat from on board.</p>

<p>After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I
brought my cargo of goods; wherein, that there might be no dispute
about dividing, I showed them that there was a sufficiency for them
all, desiring that they might all take an equal quantity, when made
up, of the goods that were for wearing. As, first, I distributed
linen sufficient to make every one of them four shirts, and, at the
Spaniard's request, afterwards made them up six; these were
exceeding comfortable to them, having been what they had long since
forgot the use of, or what it was to wear them. I allotted the thin
English stuffs, which I mentioned before, to make every one a light
coat, like a frock, which I judged fittest for the heat of the
season, cool and loose; and ordered that whenever they decayed,
they should make more, as they thought fit; the like for pumps,
shoes, stockings, hats, &amp;c. I cannot express what pleasure sat
upon the countenances of all these poor men when they saw the care
I had taken of them, and how well I had furnished them. They told
me I was a father to them; and that having such a correspondent as
I was in so remote a part of the world, it would make them forget
that they were left in a desolate place; and they all voluntarily
engaged to me not to leave the place without my consent.</p>

<p>Then I presented to them the people I had brought with me,
particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all of
them most necessary people; but, above all, my general artificer,
than whom they could not name anything that was more useful to
them; and the tailor, to show his concern for them, went to work
immediately, and, with my leave, made them every one a shirt, the
first thing he did; and, what was still more, he taught the women
not only how to sew and stitch, and use the needle, but made them
assist to make the shirts for their husbands, and for all the rest.
As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they were;
for they took to pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things, and made
clever convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers,
shelves, and everything they wanted of that kind. But to let them
see how nature made artificers at first, I carried the carpenters
to see Will Atkins' basket-house, as I called it; and they both
owned they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity before,
nor anything so regular and so handily built, at least of its kind;
and one of them, when he saw it, after musing a good while, turning
about to me, "I am sure," says he, "that man has no need of us; you
need do nothing but give him tools."</p>

<p>Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every
man a digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no barrows or
ploughs; and to every separate place a pickaxe, a crow, a broad
axe, and a saw; always appointing, that as often as any were broken
or worn out, they should be supplied without grudging out of the
general stores that I left behind. Nails, staples, hinges, hammers,
chisels, knives, scissors, and all sorts of ironwork, they had
without reserve, as they required; for no man would take more than
he wanted, and he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them on
any account whatever; and for the use of the smith I left two tons
of unwrought iron for a supply.</p>

<p>My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them was such,
even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at them; for now
they could march as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder,
if there was occasion; and were able to fight a thousand savages,
if they had but some little advantages of situation, which also
they could not miss, if they had occasion.</p>

<p>I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was
starved to death, and the maid also; she was a sober,
well-educated, religious young woman, and behaved so inoffensively
that every one gave her a good word; she had, indeed, an unhappy
life with us, there being no woman in the ship but herself, but she
bore it with patience. After a while, seeing things so well
ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon my island, and
considering that they had neither business nor acquaintance in the
East Indies, or reason for taking so long a voyage, both of them
came to me and desired I would give them leave to remain on the
island, and be entered among my family, as they called it. I agreed
to this readily; and they had a little plot of ground allotted to
them, where they had three tents or houses set up, surrounded with
a basket-work, palisadoed like Atkins's, adjoining to his
plantation. Their tents were contrived so that they had each of
them a room apart to lodge in, and a middle tent like a great
storehouse to lay their goods in, and to eat and to drink in. And
now the other two Englishmen removed their habitation to the same
place; and so the island was divided into three colonies, and no
more&mdash;viz. the Spaniards, with old Friday and the first
servants, at my habitation under the hill, which was, in a word,
the capital city, and where they had so enlarged and extended their
works, as well under as on the outside of the hill, that they
lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never was
there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, in any part of the
world; for I verify believe that a thousand men might have ranged
the island a month, and, if they had not known there was such a
thing, and looked on purpose for it, they would not have found it.
Indeed the trees stood so thick and so close, and grew so fast
woven one into another, that nothing but cutting them down first
could discover the place, except the only two narrow entrances
where they went in and out could be found, which was not very easy;
one of them was close down at the water's edge, on the side of the
creek, and it was afterwards above two hundred yards to the place;
and the other was up a ladder at twice, as I have already described
it; and they had also a large wood, thickly planted, on the top of
the hill, containing above an acre, which grew apace, and concealed
the place from all discovery there, with only one narrow place
between two trees, not easily to be discovered, to enter on that
side.</p>

<p>The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were four
families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with their
wives and children; three savages that were slaves, the widow and
children of the Englishman that was killed, the young man and the
maid, and, by the way, we made a wife of her before we went away.
There were besides the two carpenters and the tailor, whom I
brought with me for them: also the smith, who was a very necessary
man to them, especially as a gunsmith, to take care of their arms;
and my other man, whom I called Jack-of-all-trades, who was in
himself as good almost as twenty men; for he was not only a very
ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow, and before I went away
we married him to the honest maid that came with the youth in the
ship I mentioned before.</p>

<p>And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to say
something of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought with me out
of the ship's crew whom I took up at sea. It is true this man was a
Roman, and perhaps it may give offence to some hereafter if I leave
anything extraordinary upon record of a man whom, before I begin, I
must (to set him out in just colours) represent in terms very much
to his disadvantage, in the account of Protestants; as, first, that
he was a Papist; secondly, a Popish priest; and thirdly, a French
Popish priest. But justice demands of me to give him a due
character; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious, and most
religious person; exact in his life, extensive in his charity, and
exemplary in almost everything he did. What then can any one say
against being very sensible of the value of such a man,
notwithstanding his profession? though it may be my opinion
perhaps, as well as the opinion of others who shall read this, that
he was mistaken.</p>

<p>The first hour that I began to converse with him after he had
agreed to go with me to the East Indies, I found reason to delight
exceedingly in his conversation; and he first began with me about
religion in the most obliging manner imaginable. "Sir," says he,
"you have not only under God" (and at that he crossed his breast)
"saved my life, but you have admitted me to go this voyage in your
ship, and by your obliging civility have taken me into your family,
giving me an opportunity of free conversation. Now, sir, you see by
my habit what my profession is, and I guess by your nation what
yours is; I may think it is my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use
my utmost endeavours, on all occasions, to bring all the souls I
can to the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic
doctrine; but as I am here under your permission, and in your
family, I am bound, in justice to your kindness as well as in
decency and good manners, to be under your government; and
therefore I shall not, without your leave, enter into any debate on
the points of religion in which we may not agree, further than you
shall give me leave."</p>

<p>I told him his carriage was so modest that I could not but
acknowledge it; that it was true we were such people as they call
heretics, but that he was not the first Catholic I had conversed
with without falling into inconveniences, or carrying the questions
to any height in debate; that he should not find himself the worse
used for being of a different opinion from us, and if we did not
converse without any dislike on either side, it should be his
fault, not ours.</p>

<p>He replied that he thought all our conversation might be easily
separated from disputes; that it was not his business to cap
principles with every man he conversed with; and that he rather
desired me to converse with him as a gentleman than as a
religionist; and that, if I would give him leave at any time to
discourse upon religious subjects, he would readily comply with it,
and that he did not doubt but I would allow him also to defend his
own opinions as well as he could; but that without my leave he
would not break in upon me with any such thing. He told me further,
that he would not cease to do all that became him, in his office as
a priest, as well as a private Christian, to procure the good of
the ship, and the safety of all that was in her; and though,
perhaps, we would not join with him, and he could not pray with us,
he hoped he might pray for us, which he would do upon all
occasions. In this manner we conversed; and as he was of the most
obliging, gentlemanlike behaviour, so he was, if I may be allowed
to say so, a man of good sense, and, as I believe, of great
learning.</p>

<p>He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the many
extraordinary events of it; of many adventures which had befallen
him in the few years that he had been abroad in the world; and
particularly, it was very remarkable, that in the voyage he was now
engaged in he had had the misfortune to be five times shipped and
unshipped, and never to go to the place whither any of the ships he
was in were at first designed. That his first intent was to have
gone to Martinico, and that he went on board a ship bound thither
at St. Malo; but being forced into Lisbon by bad weather, the ship
received some damage by running aground in the mouth of the river
Tagus, and was obliged to unload her cargo there; but finding a
Portuguese ship there bound for the Madeiras, and ready to sail,
and supposing he should meet with a ship there bound to Martinico,
he went on board, in order to sail to the Madeiras; but the master
of the Portuguese ship being but an indifferent mariner, had been
out of his reckoning, and they drove to Fayal; where, however, he
happened to find a very good market for his cargo, which was corn,
and therefore resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt
at the Isle of May, and to go away to Newfoundland. He had no
remedy in this exigence but to go with the ship, and had a pretty
good voyage as far as the Banks (so they call the place where they
catch the fish), where, meeting with a French ship bound from
France to Quebec, and from thence to Martinico, to carry
provisions, he thought he should have an opportunity to complete
his first design, but when he came to Quebec, the master of the
ship died, and the vessel proceeded no further; so the next voyage
he shipped himself for France, in the ship that was burned when we
took them up at sea, and then shipped with us for the East Indies,
as I have already said. Thus he had been disappointed in five
voyages; all, as I may call it, in one voyage, besides what I shall
have occasion to mention further of him.</p>

<p>But I shall not make digression into other men's stories which
have no relation to my own; so I return to what concerns our affair
in the island. He came to me one morning (for he lodged among us
all the while we were upon the island), and it happened to be just
when I was going to visit the Englishmen's colony, at the furthest
part of the island; I say, he came to me, and told me, with a very
grave countenance, that he had for two or three days desired an
opportunity of some discourse with me, which he hoped would not be
displeasing to me, because he thought it might in some measure
correspond with my general design, which was the prosperity of my
new colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more than he yet
thought it was, in the way of God's blessing.</p>

<p>I looked a little surprised at the last of his discourse, and
turning a little short, "How, sir," said I, "can it be said that we
are not in the way of God's blessing, after such visible
assistances and deliverances as we have seen here, and of which I
have given you a large account?" "If you had pleased, sir," said
he, with a world of modesty, and yet great readiness, "to have
heard me, you would have found no room to have been displeased,
much less to think so hard of me, that I should suggest that you
have not had wonderful assistances and deliverances; and I hope, on
your behalf, that you are in the way of God's blessing, and your
design is exceeding good, and will prosper. But, sir, though it
were more so than is even possible to you, yet there may be some
among you that are not equally right in their actions: and you know
that in the story of the children of Israel, one Achan in the camp
removed God's blessing from them, and turned His hand so against
them, that six-and-thirty of them, though not concerned in the
crime, were the objects of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of
that punishment."</p>

<p>I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and told him his
inference was so just, and the whole design seemed so sincere, and
was really so religious in its own nature, that I was very sorry I
had interrupted him, and begged him to go on; and, in the meantime,
because it seemed that what we had both to say might take up some
time, I told him I was going to the Englishmen's plantations, and
asked him to go with me, and we might discourse of it by the way.
He told me he would the more willingly wait on me thither, because
there partly the thing was acted which he desired to speak to me
about; so we walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain with
me in what he had to say.</p>

<p>"Why, then, sir," said he, "be pleased to give me leave to lay
down a few propositions, as the foundation of what I have to say,
that we may not differ in the general principles, though we may be
of some differing opinions in the practice of particulars. First,
sir, though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles of religion
(and it is very unhappy it is so, especially in the case before us,
as I shall show afterwards), yet there are some general principles
in which we both agree&mdash;that there is a God; and that this God
having given us some stated general rules for our service and
obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend Him,
either by neglecting to do what He has commanded, or by doing what
He has expressly forbidden. And let our different religions be what
they will, this general principle is readily owned by us all, that
the blessing of God does not ordinarily follow presumptuous sinning
against His command; and every good Christian will be
affectionately concerned to prevent any that are under his care
living in a total neglect of God and His commands. It is not your
men being Protestants, whatever my opinion may be of such, that
discharges me from being concerned for their souls, and from
endeavouring, if it lies before me, that they should live in as
little distance from enmity with their Maker as possible,
especially if you give me leave to meddle so far in your
circuit."</p>

<p>I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him I granted
all he had said, and thanked him that he would so far concern
himself for us: and begged he would explain the particulars of what
he had observed, that like Joshua, to take his own parable, I might
put away the accursed thing from us.</p>

<p>"Why, then, sir," says he, "I will take the liberty you give me;
and there are three things, which, if I am right, must stand in the
way of God's blessing upon your endeavours here, and which I should
rejoice, for your sake and their own, to see removed. And, sir, I
promise myself that you will fully agree with me in them all, as
soon as I name them; especially because I shall convince you, that
every one of them may, with great ease, and very much to your
satisfaction, be remedied. First, sir," says he, "you have here
four Englishmen, who have fetched women from among the savages, and
have taken them as their wives, and have had many children by them
all, and yet are not married to them after any stated legal manner,
as the laws of God and man require. To this, sir, I know, you will
object that there was no clergyman or priest of any kind to perform
the ceremony; nor any pen and ink, or paper, to write down a
contract of marriage, and have it signed between them. And I know
also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has told you, I mean of the
agreement that he obliged them to make when they took those women,
viz. that they should choose them out by consent, and keep
separately to them; which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage, no
agreement with the women as wives, but only an agreement among
themselves, to keep them from quarrelling. But, sir, the essence of
the sacrament of matrimony" (so he called it, being a Roman)
"consists not only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one
another as man and wife, but in the formal and legal obligation
that there is in the contract to compel the man and woman, at all
times, to own and acknowledge each other; obliging the man to
abstain from all other women, to engage in no other contract while
these subsist; and, on all occasions, as ability allows, to provide
honestly for them and their children; and to oblige the women to
the same or like conditions, on their side. Now, sir," says he,
"these men may, when they please, or when occasion presents,
abandon these women, disown their children, leave them to perish,
and take other women, and marry them while these are living;" and
here he added, with some warmth, "How, sir, is God honoured in this
unlawful liberty? And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours
in this place, however good in themselves, and however sincere in
your design, while these men, who at present are your subjects,
under your absolute government and dominion, are allowed by you to
live in open adultery?"</p>

<p>I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much more with
the convincing arguments he supported it with; but I thought to
have got off my young priest by telling him that all that part was
done when I was not there: and that they had lived so many years
with them now, that if it was adultery, it was past remedy; nothing
could be done in it now.</p>

<p>"Sir," says he, "asking your pardon for such freedom, you are
right in this, that, it being done in your absence, you could not
be charged with that part of the crime; but, I beseech you, flatter
not yourself that you are not, therefore, under an obligation to do
your utmost now to put an end to it. You should legally and
effectually marry them; and as, sir, my way of marrying may not be
easy to reconcile them to, though it will be effectual, even by
your own laws, so your way may be as well before God, and as valid
among men. I mean by a written contract signed by both man and
woman, and by all the witnesses present, which all the laws of
Europe would decree to be valid."</p>

<p>I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sincerity of
zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse as to his
own party or church, and such true warmth for preserving people
that he had no knowledge of or relation to from transgressing the
laws of God. But recollecting what he had said of marrying them by
a written contract, which I knew he would stand to, I returned it
back upon him, and told him I granted all that he had said to be
just, and on his part very kind; that I would discourse with the
men upon the point now, when I came to them; and I knew no reason
why they should scruple to let him marry them all, which I knew
well enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid in
England as if they were married by one of our own clergymen.</p>

<p>I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint
which he had to make, acknowledging that I was very much his debtor
for the first, and thanking him heartily for it. He told me he
would use the same freedom and plainness in the second, and hoped I
would take it as well; and this was, that notwithstanding these
English subjects of mine, as he called them, had lived with these
women almost seven years, had taught them to speak English, and
even to read it, and that they were, as he perceived, women of
tolerable understanding, and capable of instruction, yet they had
not, to this hour, taught them anything of the Christian
religion&mdash;no, not so much as to know there was a God, or a
worship, or in what manner God was to be served, or that their own
idolatry, and worshipping they knew not whom, was false and absurd.
This he said was an unaccountable neglect, and what God would
certainly call them to account for, and perhaps at last take the
work out of their hands. He spoke this very affectionately and
warmly.</p>

<p>"I am persuaded," says he, "had those men lived in the savage
country whence their wives came, the savages would have taken more
pains to have brought them to be idolaters, and to worship the
devil, than any of these men, so far as I can see, have taken with
them to teach the knowledge of the true God. Now, sir," said he,
"though I do not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we
would be glad to see the devil's servants and the subjects of his
kingdom taught to know religion; and that they might, at least,
hear of God and a Redeemer, and the resurrection, and of a future
state&mdash;things which we all believe; that they might, at least,
be so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true Church than
they are now in the public profession of idolatry and
devil-worship."</p>

<p>I could hold no longer: I took him in my arms and embraced him
eagerly. "How far," said I to him, "have I been from understanding
the most essential part of a Christian, viz. to love the interest
of the Christian Church, and the good of other men's souls! I
scarce have known what belongs to the being a
Christian."&mdash;"Oh, sir! do not say so," replied he; "this thing
is not your fault."&mdash;"No," said I; "but why did I never lay it
to heart as well as you?"&mdash;"It is not too late yet," said he;
"be not too forward to condemn yourself."&mdash;"But what can be
done now?" said I: "you see I am going away."&mdash;"Will you give
me leave to talk with these poor men about it?"&mdash;"Yes, with
all my heart," said I: "and oblige them to give heed to what you
say too."&mdash;"As to that," said he, "we must leave them to the
mercy of Christ; but it is your business to assist them, encourage
them, and instruct them; and if you give me leave, and God His
blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be
brought home to the great circle of Christianity, if not into the
particular faith we all embrace, and that even while you stay
here." Upon this I said, "I shall not only give you leave, but give
you a thousand thanks for it."</p>

<p>I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to
blame. "Why, really," says he, "it is of the same nature. It is
about your poor savages, who are, as I may say, your conquered
subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is or ought to be received among
all Christians, of what church or pretended church soever, that the
Christian knowledge ought to be propagated by all possible means
and on all possible occasions. It is on this principle that our
Church sends missionaries into Persia, India, and China; and that
our clergy, even of the superior sort, willingly engage in the most
hazardous voyages, and the most dangerous residence amongst
murderers and barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the true
God, and to bring them over to embrace the Christian faith. Now,
sir, you have such an opportunity here to have six or seven and
thirty poor savages brought over from a state of idolatry to the
knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you
can pass such an occasion of doing good, which is really worth the
expense of a man's whole life."</p>

<p>I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to say. I had
here the spirit of true Christian zeal for God and religion before
me. As for me, I had not so much as entertained a thought of this
in my heart before, and I believe I should not have thought of it;
for I looked upon these savages as slaves, and people whom, had we
not had any work for them to do, we would have used as such, or
would have been glad to have transported them to any part of the
world; for our business was to get rid of them, and we would all
have been satisfied if they had been sent to any country, so they
had never seen their own. I was confounded at his discourse, and
knew not what answer to make him.</p>

<p>He looked earnestly at me, seeing my confusion. "Sir," says he,
"I shall be very sorry if what I have said gives you any
offence."&mdash;"No, no," said I, "I am offended with nobody but
myself; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to think that I
should never take any notice of this before, but with reflecting
what notice I am able to take of it now. You know, sir," said I,
"what circumstances I am in; I am bound to the East Indies in a
ship freighted by merchants, and to whom it would be an
insufferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the men
lying all this while at victuals and wages on the owners' account.
It is true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and if I stay
more, I must pay three pounds sterling <i>per diem</i> demurrage;
nor can I stay upon demurrage above eight days more, and I have
been here thirteen already; so that I am perfectly unable to engage
in this work unless I would suffer myself to be left behind here
again; in which case, if this single ship should miscarry in any
part of her voyage, I should be just in the same condition that I
was left in here at first, and from which I have been so
wonderfully delivered." He owned the case was very hard upon me as
to my voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience whether the
blessing of saving thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing all I
had in the world for. I was not so sensible of that as he was. I
replied to him thus: "Why, sir, it is a valuable thing, indeed, to
be an instrument in God's hand to convert thirty-seven heathens to
the knowledge of Christ: but as you are an ecclesiastic, and are
given over to the work, so it seems so naturally to fall in the way
of your profession; how is it, then, that you do not rather offer
yourself to undertake it than to press me to do it?"</p>

<p>Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along, and
putting me to a full stop, made me a very low bow. "I most heartily
thank God and you, sir," said he, "for giving me so evident a call
to so blessed a work; and if you think yourself discharged from it,
and desire me to undertake it, I will most readily do it, and think
it a happy reward for all the hazards and difficulties of such a
broken, disappointed voyage as I have met with, that I am dropped
at last into so glorious a work."</p>

<p>I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this
to me; his eyes sparkled like fire; his face glowed, and his colour
came and went; in a word, he was fired with the joy of being
embarked in such a work. I paused a considerable while before I
could tell what to say to him; for I was really surprised to find a
man of such sincerity, and who seemed possessed of a zeal beyond
the ordinary rate of men. But after I had considered it a while, I
asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would
venture, on the single consideration of an attempt to convert those
poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted island for perhaps his
life, and at last might not know whether he should be able to do
them good or not? He turned short upon me, and asked me what I
called a venture? "Pray, sir," said he, "what do you think I
consented to go in your ship to the East Indies for?"&mdash;"ay,"
said I, "that I know not, unless it was to preach to the
Indians."&mdash;"Doubtless it was," said he; "and do you think, if
I can convert these thirty-seven men to the faith of Jesus Christ,
it is not worth my time, though I should never be fetched off the
island again?&mdash;nay, is it not infinitely of more worth to save
so many souls than my life is, or the life of twenty more of the
same profession? Yes, sir," says he, "I would give God thanks all
my days if I could be made the happy instrument of saving the souls
of those poor men, though I were never to get my foot off this
island or see my native country any more. But since you will honour
me with putting me into this work, for which I will pray for you
all the days of my life, I have one humble petition to you
besides."&mdash;"What is that?" said I.&mdash;"Why," says he, "it
is, that you will leave your man Friday with me, to be my
interpreter to them, and to assist me; for without some help I
cannot speak to them, or they to me."</p>

<p>I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I could
not think of parting with him, and that for many reasons: he had
been the companion of my travels; he was not only faithful to me,
but sincerely affectionate to the last degree; and I had resolved
to do something considerable for him if he out-lived me, as it was
probable he would. Then I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be
a Protestant, it would quite confound him to bring him to embrace
another religion; and he would never, while his eyes were open,
believe that his old master was a heretic, and would be damned; and
this might in the end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so
turn him back again to his first idolatry. However, a sudden
thought relieved me in this strait, and it was this: I told him I
could not say that I was willing to part with Friday on any account
whatever, though a work that to him was of more value than his life
ought to be of much more value than the keeping or parting with a
servant. On the other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by no
means agree to part with me; and I could not force him to it
without his consent, without manifest injustice; because I had
promised I would never send him away, and he had promised and
engaged that he would never leave me, unless I sent him away.</p>

<p>He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational
access to these poor people, seeing he did not understand one word
of their language, nor they one of his. To remove this difficulty,
I told him Friday's father had learned Spanish, which I found he
also understood, and he should serve him as an interpreter. So he
was much better satisfied, and nothing could persuade him but he
would stay and endeavour to convert them; but Providence gave
another very happy turn to all this.</p>

<p>I come back now to the first part of his objections. When we
came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and after
some account given them of what I had done for them, viz. what
necessary things I had provided for them, and how they were
distributed, which they were very sensible of, and very thankful
for, I began to talk to them of the scandalous life they led, and
gave them a full account of the notice the clergyman had taken of
it; and arguing how unchristian and irreligious a life it was, I
first asked them if they were married men or bachelors? They soon
explained their condition to me, and showed that two of them were
widowers, and the other three were single men, or bachelors. I
asked them with what conscience they could take these women, and
call them their wives, and have so many children by them, and not
be lawfully married to them? They all gave me the answer I
expected, viz. that there was nobody to marry them; that they
agreed before the governor to keep them as their wives, and to
maintain them and own them as their wives; and they thought, as
things stood with them, they were as legally married as if they had
been married by a parson and with all the formalities in the
world.</p>

<p>I told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of God,
and were bound in conscience to keep them as their wives; but that
the laws of men being otherwise, they might desert the poor women
and children hereafter; and that their wives, being poor desolate
women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way to help
themselves. I therefore told them that unless I was assured of
their honest intent, I could do nothing for them, but would take
care that what I did should be for the women and children without
them; and that, unless they would give me some assurances that they
would marry the women, I could not think it was convenient they
should continue together as man and wife; for that it was both
scandalous to men and offensive to God, who they could not think
would bless them if they went on thus.</p>

<p>All this went on as I expected; and they told me, especially
Will Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the rest, that they loved
their wives as well as if they had been born in their own native
country, and would not leave them on any account whatever; and they
did verily believe that their wives were as virtuous and as modest,
and did, to the utmost of their skill, as much for them and for
their children, as any woman could possibly do: and they would not
part with them on any account. Will Atkins, for his own particular,
added that if any man would take him away, and offer to carry him
home to England, and make him captain of the best man-of-war in the
navy, he would not go with him if he might not carry his wife and
children with him; and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he
would be married to her now with all his heart.</p>

<p>This was just as I would have it. The priest was not with me at
that moment, but he was not far off; so to try him further, I told
him I had a clergyman with me, and, if he was sincere, I would have
him married next morning, and bade him consider of it, and talk
with the rest. He said, as for himself, he need not consider of it
at all, for he was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a
minister with me, and he believed they would be all willing also. I
then told him that my friend, the minister, was a Frenchman, and
could not speak English, but I would act the clerk between them. He
never so much as asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant,
which was, indeed, what I was afraid of. We then parted, and I went
back to my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk with his
companions. I desired the French gentleman not to say anything to
them till the business was thoroughly ripe; and I told him what
answer the men had given me.</p>

<p>Before I went from their quarter they all came to me and told me
they had been considering what I had said; that they were glad to
hear I had a clergyman in my company, and they were very willing to
give me the satisfaction I desired, and to be formally married as
soon as I pleased; for they were far from desiring to part with
their wives, and that they meant nothing but what was very honest
when they chose them. So I appointed them to meet me the next
morning; and, in the meantime, they should let their wives know the
meaning of the marriage law; and that it was not only to prevent
any scandal, but also to oblige them that they should not forsake
them, whatever might happen.</p>

<p>The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the thing,
and were very well satisfied with it, as, indeed, they had reason
to be: so they failed not to attend all together at my apartment
next morning, where I brought out my clergyman; and though he had
not on a minister's gown, after the manner of England, or the habit
of a priest, after the manner of France, yet having a black vest
something like a cassock, with a sash round it, he did not look
very unlike a minister; and as for his language, I was his
interpreter. But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and the
scruples he made of marrying the women, because they were not
baptized and professed Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence
for his person; and there was no need, after that, to inquire
whether he was a clergyman or not. Indeed, I was afraid his
scruples would have been carried so far as that he would not have
married them at all; nay, notwithstanding all I was able to say to
him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet very steadily, and at
last refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had first talked
with the men and the women too; and though at first I was a little
backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good will,
perceiving the sincerity of his design.</p>

<p>When he came to them he let them know that I had acquainted him
with their circumstances, and with the present design; that he was
very willing to perform that part of his function, and marry them,
as I had desired; but that before he could do it, he must take the
liberty to talk with them. He told them that in the sight of all
indifferent men, and in the sense of the laws of society, they had
lived all this while in a state of sin; and that it was true that
nothing but the consenting to marry, or effectually separating them
from one another, could now put an end to it; but there was a
difficulty in it, too, with respect to the laws of Christian
matrimony, which he was not fully satisfied about, that of marrying
one that is a professed Christian to a savage, an idolater, and a
heathen&mdash;one that is not baptized; and yet that he did not see
that there was time left to endeavour to persuade the women to be
baptized, or to profess the name of Christ, whom they had, he
doubted, heard nothing of, and without which they could not be
baptized. He told them he doubted they were but indifferent
Christians themselves; that they had but little knowledge of God or
of His ways, and, therefore, he could not expect that they had said
much to their wives on that head yet; but that unless they would
promise him to use their endeavours with their wives to persuade
them to become Christians, and would, as well as they could,
instruct them in the knowledge and belief of God that made them,
and to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not marry
them; for he would have no hand in joining Christians with savages,
nor was it consistent with the principles of the Christian
religion, and was, indeed, expressly forbidden in God's law.</p>

<p>They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very
faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his own words as I
could; only sometimes adding something of my own, to convince them
how just it was, and that I was of his mind; and I always very
carefully distinguished between what I said from myself and what
were the clergyman's words. They told me it was very true what the
gentleman said, that they were very indifferent Christians
themselves, and that they had never talked to their wives about
religion. "Lord, sir," says Will Atkins, "how should we teach them
religion? Why, we know nothing ourselves; and besides, sir," said
he, "should we talk to them of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven and
hell, it would make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe
ourselves. And if we should tell them that we believe all the
things we speak of to them, such as of good people going to heaven,
and wicked people to the devil, they would ask us where we intend
to go ourselves, that believe all this, and are such wicked fellows
as we indeed are? Why, sir; 'tis enough to give them a surfeit of
religion at first hearing; folks must have some religion themselves
before they begin to teach other people."&mdash;"Will Atkins," said
I to him, "though I am afraid that what you say has too much truth
in it, yet can you not tell your wife she is in the wrong; that
there is a God and a religion better than her own; that her gods
are idols; that they can neither hear nor speak; that there is a
great Being that made all things, and that can destroy all that He
has made; that He rewards the good and punishes the bad; and that
we are to be judged by Him at last for all we do here? You are not
so ignorant but even nature itself will teach you that all this is
true; and I am satisfied you know it all to be true, and believe it
yourself."&mdash;"That is true, sir," said Atkins; "but with what
face can I say anything to my wife of all this, when she will tell
me immediately it cannot be true?"&mdash;"Not true!" said I; "what
do you mean by that?"&mdash;"Why, sir," said he, "she will tell me
it cannot be true that this God I shall tell her of can be just, or
can punish or reward, since I am not punished and sent to the
devil, that have been such a wicked creature as she knows I have
been, even to her, and to everybody else; and that I should be
suffered to live, that have been always acting so contrary to what
I must tell her is good, and to what I ought to have
done."&mdash;"Why, truly, Atkins," said I, "I am afraid thou
speakest too much truth;" and with that I informed the clergyman of
what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know. "Oh," said the
priest, "tell him there is one thing will make him the best
minister in the world to his wife, and that is repentance; for none
teach repentance like true penitents. He wants nothing but to
repent, and then he will be so much the better qualified to
instruct his wife; he will then be able to tell her that there is
not only a God, and that He is the just rewarder of good and evil,
but that He is a merciful Being, and with infinite goodness and
long-suffering forbears to punish those that offend; waiting to be
gracious, and willing not the death of a sinner, but rather that he
should return and live; and even reserves damnation to the general
day of retribution; that it is a clear evidence of God and of a
future state that righteous men receive not their reward, or wicked
men their punishment, till they come into another world; and this
will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of the resurrection
and of the last judgment. Let him but repent himself, he will be an
excellent preacher of repentance to his wife."</p>

<p>I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the
while, and, as we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily
affected with it; when being eager, and hardly suffering me to make
an end, "I know all this, master," says he, "and a great deal more;
but I have not the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when God and
my conscience know, and my wife will be an undeniable evidence
against me, that I have lived as if I had never heard of a God or
future state, or anything about it; and to talk of my repenting,
alas!" (and with that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could see that
the tears stood in his eyes) "'tis past all that with
me."&mdash;"Past it, Atkins?" said I: "what dost thou mean by
that?"&mdash;"I know well enough what I mean," says he; "I mean
'tis too late, and that is too true."</p>

<p>I told the clergyman, word for word, what he said, and this
affectionate man could not refrain from tears; but, recovering
himself, said to me, "Ask him but one question. Is he easy that it
is too late; or is he troubled, and wishes it were not so?" I put
the question fairly to Atkins; and he answered with a great deal of
passion, "How could any man be easy in a condition that must
certainly end in eternal destruction? that he was far from being
easy; but that, on the contrary, he believed it would one time or
other ruin him."&mdash;"What do you mean by that?" said
I.&mdash;"Why," he said, "he believed he should one time or other
cut his throat, to put an end to the terror of it."</p>

<p>The clergyman shook his head, with great concern in his face,
when I told him all this; but turning quick to me upon it, says,
"If that be his case, we may assure him it is not too late; Christ
will give him repentance. But pray," says he, "explain this to him:
that as no man is saved but by Christ, and the merit of His passion
procuring divine mercy for him, how can it be too late for any man
to receive mercy? Does he think he is able to sin beyond the power
or reach of divine mercy? Pray tell him there may be a time when
provoked mercy will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to
hear, but that it is never too late for men to ask mercy; and we,
that are Christ's servants, are commanded to preach mercy at all
times, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely
repent: so that it is never too late to repent."</p>

<p>I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness;
but it seemed as if he turned off the discourse to the rest, for he
said to me he would go and have some talk with his wife; so he went
out a while, and we talked to the rest. I perceived they were all
stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion, as much as I was when
I went rambling away from my father; yet there were none of them
backward to hear what had been said; and all of them seriously
promised that they would talk with their wives about it, and do
their endeavours to persuade them to turn Christians.</p>

<p>The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported what answer they
gave, but said nothing a good while; but at last, shaking his head,
"We that are Christ's servants," says he, "can go no further than
to exhort and instruct: and when men comply, submit to the reproof,
and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do; we are bound to accept
their good words; but believe me, sir," said he, "whatever you may
have known of the life of that man you call Will Atkin's, I believe
he is the only sincere convert among them: I will not despair of
the rest; but that man is apparently struck with the sense of his
past life, and I doubt not, when he comes to talk of religion to
his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it: for attempting
to teach others is sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves. If
that poor Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ
to his wife, he will assuredly talk himself into a thorough
convert, make himself a penitent, and who knows what may
follow."</p>

<p>Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as above, to
endeavour to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity, he
married the two other couple; but Will Atkins and his wife were not
yet come in. After this, my clergyman, waiting a while, was curious
to know where Atkins was gone, and turning to me, said, "I entreat
you, sir, let us walk out of your labyrinth here and look; I
daresay we shall find this poor man somewhere or other talking
seriously to his wife, and teaching her already something of
religion." I began to be of the same mind; so we went out together,
and I carried him a way which none knew but myself, and where the
trees were so very thick that it was not easy to see through the
thicket of leaves, and far harder to see in than to see out: when,
coming to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny wife
sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager in discourse: I
stopped short till my clergyman came up to me, and then having
showed him where they were, we stood and looked very steadily at
them a good while. We observed him very earnest with her, pointing
up to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens, and then down
to the earth, then out to the sea, then to himself, then to her, to
the woods, to the trees. "Now," says the clergyman, "you see my
words are made good, the man preaches to her; mark him now, he is
telling her that our God has made him, her, and the heavens, the
earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, &amp;c."&mdash;"I believe he
is," said I. Immediately we perceived Will Atkins start upon his
feet, fall down on his knees, and lift up both his hands. We
supposed he said something, but we could not hear him; it was too
far for that. He did not continue kneeling half a minute, but comes
and sits down again by his wife, and talks to her again; we
perceived then the woman very attentive, but whether she said
anything to him we could not tell. While the poor fellow was upon
his knees I could see the tears run plentifully down my clergyman's
cheeks, and I could hardly forbear myself; but it was a great
affliction to us both that we were not near enough to hear anything
that passed between them. Well, however, we could come no nearer
for fear of disturbing them: so we resolved to see an end of this
piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud enough to us without
the help of voice. He sat down again, as I have said, close by her,
and talked again earnestly to her, and two or three times we could
see him embrace her most passionately; another time we saw him take
out his handkerchief and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again
with a kind of transport very unusual; and after several of these
things, we saw him on a sudden jump up again, and lend her his hand
to help her up, when immediately leading her by the hand a step or
two, they both kneeled down together, and continued so about two
minutes.</p>

<p>My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, "St.
Paul! St. Paul! behold he prayeth." I was afraid Atkins would hear
him, therefore I entreated him to withhold himself a while, that we
might see an end of the scene, which to me, I must confess, was the
most affecting that ever I saw in my life. Well, he strove with
himself for a while, but was in such raptures to think that the
poor heathen woman was become a Christian, that he was not able to
contain himself; he wept several times, then throwing up his hands
and crossing his breast, said over several things ejaculatory, and
by the way of giving God thanks for so miraculous a testimony of
the success of our endeavours. Some he spoke softly, and I could
not well hear others; some things he said in Latin, some in French;
then two or three times the tears would interrupt him, that he
could not speak at all; but I begged that he would contain himself,
and let us more narrowly and fully observe what was before us,
which he did for a time, the scene not being near ended yet; for
after the poor man and his wife were risen again from their knees,
we observed he stood talking still eagerly to her, and we observed
her motion, that she was greatly affected with what he said, by her
frequently lifting up her hands, laying her hand to her breast, and
such other postures as express the greatest seriousness and
attention; this continued about half a quarter of an hour, and then
they walked away, so we could see no more of them in that
situation.</p>

<p>I took this interval to say to the clergyman, first, that I was
glad to see the particulars we had both been witnesses to; that,
though I was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began
to think it was all very sincere here, both in the man and his
wife, however ignorant they might both be, and I hoped such a
beginning would yet have a more happy end. "But, my friend," added
I, "will you give me leave to start one difficulty here? I cannot
tell how to object the least thing against that affectionate
concern which you show for the turning of the poor people from
their paganism to the Christian religion; but how does this comfort
you, while these people are, in your account, out of the pale of
the Catholic Church, without which you believe there is no
salvation? so that you esteem these but heretics, as effectually
lost as the pagans themselves."</p>

<p>To this he answered, with abundance of candour, thus: "Sir, I am
a Catholic of the Roman Church, and a priest of the order of St.
Benedict, and I embrace all the principles of the Roman faith; but
yet, if you will believe me, and that I do not speak in compliment
to you, or in respect to my circumstances and your civilities; I
say nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call yourselves
reformed, without some charity. I dare not say (though I know it is
our opinion in general) that you cannot be saved; I will by no
means limit the mercy of Christ so far as think that He cannot
receive you into the bosom of His Church, in a manner to us
unperceivable; and I hope you have the same charity for us: I pray
daily for you being all restored to Christ's Church, by whatsoever
method He, who is all-wise, is pleased to direct. In the meantime,
surely you will allow it consists with me as a Roman to distinguish
far between a Protestant and a pagan; between one that calls on
Jesus Christ, though in a way which I do not think is according to
the true faith, and a savage or a barbarian, that knows no God, no
Christ, no Redeemer; and if you are not within the pale of the
Catholic Church, we hope you are nearer being restored to it than
those who know nothing of God or of His Church: and I rejoice,
therefore, when I see this poor man, who you say has been a
profligate, and almost a murderer kneel down and pray to Jesus
Christ, as we suppose he did, though not fully enlightened;
believing that God, from whom every such work proceeds, will
sensibly touch his heart, and bring him to the further knowledge of
that truth in His own time; and if God shall influence this poor
man to convert and instruct the ignorant savage, his wife, I can
never believe that he shall be cast away himself. And have I not
reason, then, to rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the
knowledge of Christ, though they may not be brought quite home into
the bosom of the Catholic Church just at the time when I desire it,
leaving it to the goodness of Christ to perfect His work in His own
time, and in his own way? Certainly, I would rejoice if all the
savages in America were brought, like this poor woman, to pray to
God, though they were all to be Protestants at first, rather than
they should continue pagans or heathens; firmly believing, that He
that had bestowed the first light on them would farther illuminate
them with a beam of His heavenly grace, and bring them into the
pale of His Church when He should see good."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII&mdash;CONVERSATION BETWIXT WILL ATKINS AND HIS
WIFE</h3>

<p>I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pious
Papist, as much as I was oppressed by the power of his reasoning;
and it presently occurred to my thoughts, that if such a temper was
universal, we might be all Catholic Christians, whatever Church or
particular profession we joined in; that a spirit of charity would
soon work us all up into right principles; and as he thought that
the like charity would make us all Catholics, so I told him I
believed, had all the members of his Church the like moderation,
they would soon all be Protestants. And there we left that part;
for we never disputed at all. However, I talked to him another way,
and taking him by the hand, "My friend," says I, "I wish all the
clergy of the Romish Church were blessed with such moderation, and
had an equal share of your charity. I am entirely of your opinion;
but I must tell you that if you should preach such doctrine in
Spain or Italy, they would put you into the Inquisition."&mdash;"It
may be so," said he; "I know not what they would do in Spain or
Italy; but I will not say they would be the better Christians for
that severity; for I am sure there is no heresy in abounding with
charity."</p>

<p>Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business there
was over, so we went back our own way; and when we came back, we
found them waiting to be called in. Observing this, I asked my
clergyman if we should discover to him that we had seen him under
the bush or not; and it was his opinion we should not, but that we
should talk to him first, and hear what he would say to us; so we
called him in alone, nobody being in the place but ourselves, and I
began by asking him some particulars about his parentage and
education. He told me frankly enough that his father was a
clergyman who would have taught him well, but that he, Will Atkins,
despised all instruction and correction; and by his brutish conduct
cut the thread of all his father's comforts and shortened his days,
for that he broke his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural
return for the most affectionate treatment a father ever gave.</p>

<p>In what he said there seemed so much sincerity of repentance,
that it painfully affected me. I could not but reflect that I, too,
had shortened the life of a good, tender father by my bad conduct
and obstinate self-will. I was, indeed, so surprised with what he
had told me, that I thought, instead of my going about to teach and
instruct him, the man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a
most unexpected manner.</p>

<p>I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly
affected with it, and said to me, "Did I not say, sir, that when
this man was converted he would preach to us all? I tell you, sir,
if this one man be made a true penitent, there will be no need of
me; he will make Christians of all in the island."&mdash;But having
a little composed myself, I renewed my discourse with Will Atkins.
"But, Will," said I, "how comes the sense of this matter to touch
you just now?"</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Sir, you have set me about a work that has
struck a dart though my very soul; I have been talking about God
and religion to my wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a
Christian of her, and she has preached such a sermon to me as I
shall never forget while I live.</p>

<p><i>R.C.</i>&mdash;No, no, it is not your wife has preached to
you; but when you were moving religious arguments to her,
conscience has flung them back upon you.</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Ay, sir, with such force as is not to be
resisted.</p>

<p><i>R.C.</i>&mdash;Pray, Will, let us know what passed between
you and your wife; for I know something of it already.</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Sir, it is impossible to give you a full
account of it; I am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to
express it; but let her have said what she will, though I cannot
give you an account of it, this I can tell you, that I have
resolved to amend and reform my life.</p>

<p><i>R.C.</i>&mdash;But tell us some of it: how did you begin,
Will? For this has been an extraordinary case, that is certain. She
has preached a sermon, indeed, if she has wrought this upon
you.</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Why, I first told her the nature of our laws
about marriage, and what the reasons were that men and women were
obliged to enter into such compacts as it was neither in the power
of one nor other to break; that otherwise, order and justice could
not be maintained, and men would run from their wives, and abandon
their children, mix confusedly with one another, and neither
families be kept entire, nor inheritances be settled by legal
descent.</p>

<p><i>R.C.</i>&mdash;You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you make
her understand what you meant by inheritance and families? They
know no such things among the savages, but marry anyhow, without
regard to relation, consanguinity, or family; brother and sister,
nay, as I have been told, even the father and the daughter, and the
son and the mother.</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;I believe, sir, you are misinformed, and my
wife assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it; perhaps,
for any further relations, they may not be so exact as we are; but
she tells me never in the near relationship you speak of.</p>

<p><i>R.C.</i>&mdash;Well, what did she say to what you told
her?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;She said she liked it very well, as it was
much better than in her country.</p>

<p><i>R.C.</i>&mdash;But did you tell her what marriage was?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Ay, ay, there began our dialogue. I asked her
if she would be married to me our way. She asked me what way that
was; I told her marriage was appointed by God; and here we had a
strange talk together, indeed, as ever man and wife had, I
believe.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife, which
I took down in writing just after he told it me, was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Appointed by your God!&mdash;Why, have you a
God in your country?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Yes, my dear, God is in every country.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;No your God in my country; my country have
the great old Benamuckee God.</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Child, I am very unfit to show you who God is;
God is in heaven and made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and
all that in them is.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;No makee de earth; no you God makee all
earth; no makee my country.</p>

<p>[Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God not
making her country.]</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;No laugh; why laugh me? This no ting to
laugh.</p>

<p>[He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was more serious
than he at first.]</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;That's true, indeed; I will not laugh any
more, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Why you say you God makee all?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and
you, and me, and all things; for He is the only true God, and there
is no God but Him. He lives for ever in heaven.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Why you no tell me long ago?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;That's true, indeed; but I have been a wicked
wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with anything
before, but have lived without God in the world myself.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;What, have you a great God in your country,
you no know Him? No say O to Him? No do good ting for Him? That no
possible.</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;It is true; though, for all that, we live as
if there was no God in heaven, or that He had no power on
earth.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;But why God let you do so? Why He no makee
you good live?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;It is all our own fault.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;But you say me He is great, much great, have
much great power; can makee kill when He will: why He no makee kill
when you no serve Him? no say O to Him? no be good mans?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;That is true, He might strike me dead; and I
ought to expect it, for I have been a wicked wretch, that is true;
but God is merciful, and does not deal with us as we deserve.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;But then do you not tell God thankee for that
too?</p>

<p><i>W. A.</i>&mdash;No, indeed, I have not thanked God for His
mercy, any more than I have feared God from His power.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Then you God no God; me no think, believe He
be such one, great much power, strong: no makee kill you, though
you make Him much angry.</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;What, will my wicked life hinder you from
believing in God? What a dreadful creature am I! and what a sad
truth is it, that the horrid lives of Christians hinder the
conversion of heathens!</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;How me tink you have great much God up there
[she points up to heaven], and yet no do well, no do good ting? Can
He tell? Sure He no tell what you do?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Yes, yes, He knows and sees all things; He
hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we think though we do
not speak.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;What! He no hear you curse, swear, speak de
great damn?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Yes, yes, He hears it all.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Where be then the much great power
strong?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;He is merciful, that is all we can say for it;
and this proves Him to be the true God; He is God, and not man, and
therefore we are not consumed.</p>

<p>[Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with horror to think how
he could tell his wife so clearly that God sees, and hears, and
knows the secret thoughts of the heart, and all that we do, and yet
that he had dared to do all the vile things he had done.]</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Merciful! What you call dat?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;He is our Father and Maker, and He pities and
spares us.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;So then He never makee kill, never angry when
you do wicked; then He no good Himself, or no great able.</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Yes, yes, my dear, He is infinitely good and
infinitely great, and able to punish too; and sometimes, to show
His justice and vengeance, He lets fly His anger to destroy sinners
and make examples; many are cut off in their sins.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;But no makee kill you yet; then He tell you,
maybe, that He no makee you kill: so you makee the bargain with
Him, you do bad thing, He no be angry at you when He be angry at
other mans.</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon
His goodness; and He would be infinitely just if He destroyed me,
as He has done other men.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead:
what you say to Him for that? You no tell Him thankee for all that
too?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that is
true.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Why He no makee you much good better? you say
He makee you.</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;He made me as He made all the world: it is I
have deformed myself and abused His goodness, and made myself an
abominable wretch.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;I wish you makee God know me. I no makee Him
angry&mdash;I no do bad wicked thing.</p>

<p>[Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him to hear a poor
untaught creature desire to be taught to know God, and he such a
wicked wretch, that he could not say one word to her about God, but
what the reproach of his own carriage would make most irrational to
her to believe; nay, that already she had told him that she could
not believe in God, because he, that was so wicked, was not
destroyed.]</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;My dear, you mean, you wish I could teach you
to know God, not God to know you; for He knows you already, and
every thought in your heart.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Why, then, He know what I say to you now: He
know me wish to know Him. How shall me know who makee me?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Poor creature, He must teach thee: I cannot
teach thee. I will pray to Him to teach thee to know Him, and
forgive me, that am unworthy to teach thee.</p>

<p>[The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him to
make her know God, and her wishing to know Him, that he said he
fell down on his knees before her, and prayed to God to enlighten
her mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon
his sins, and accept of his being the unworthy instrument of
instructing her in the principles of religion: after which he sat
down by her again, and their dialogue went on. This was the time
when we saw him kneel down and hold up his hands.]</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;What you put down the knee for? What you hold
up the hand for? What you say? Who you speak to? What is all
that?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;My dear, I bow my knees in token of my
submission to Him that made me: I said O to Him, as you call it,
and as your old men do to their idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed
to Him.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;What say you O to Him for?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;I prayed to Him to open your eyes and your
understanding, that you may know Him, and be accepted by Him.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Can He do that too?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Yes, He can: He can do all things.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;But now He hear what you say?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Yes, He has bid us pray to Him, and promised
to hear us.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Bid you pray? When He bid you? How He bid
you? What you hear Him speak?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;No, we do not hear Him speak; but He has
revealed Himself many ways to us.</p>

<p>[Here he was at a great loss to make her understand that God has
revealed Himself to us by His word, and what His word was; but at
last he told it to her thus.]</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;God has spoken to some good men in former
days, even from heaven, by plain words; and God has inspired good
men by His Spirit; and they have written all His laws down in a
book.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Me no understand that; where is book?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Alas! my poor creature, I have not this book;
but I hope I shall one time or other get it for you, and help you
to read it.</p>

<p>[Here he embraced her with great affection, but with
inexpressible grief that he had not a Bible.]</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;But how you makee me know that God teachee
them to write that book?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;By the same rule that we know Him to be
God.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;What rule? What way you know Him?</p>

<p><i>W.A.</i>&mdash;Because He teaches and commands nothing but
what is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make us perfectly
good, as well as perfectly happy; and because He forbids and
commands us to avoid all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or
evil in its consequence.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;That me would understand, that me fain see;
if He teachee all good thing, He makee all good thing, He give all
thing, He hear me when I say O to Him, as you do just now; He makee
me good if I wish to be good; He spare me, no makee kill me, when I
no be good: all this you say He do, yet He be great God; me take,
think, believe Him to be great God; me say O to Him with you, my
dear.</p>

<p>Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but raised her up,
made her kneel by him, and he prayed to God aloud to instruct her
in the knowledge of Himself, by His Spirit; and that by some good
providence, if possible, she might, some time or other, come to
have a Bible, that she might read the word of God, and be taught by
it to know Him. This was the time that we saw him lift her up by
the hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above.</p>

<p>They had several other discourses, it seems, after this; and
particularly she made him promise that, since he confessed his own
life had been a wicked, abominable course of provocations against
God, that he would reform it, and not make God angry any more, lest
He should make him dead, as she called it, and then she would be
left alone, and never be taught to know this God better; and lest
he should be miserable, as he had told her wicked men would be
after death.</p>

<p>This was a strange account, and very affecting to us both, but
particularly to the young clergyman; he was, indeed, wonderfully
surprised with it, but under the greatest affliction imaginable
that he could not talk to her, that he could not speak English to
make her understand him; and as she spoke but very broken English,
he could not understand her; however, he turned himself to me, and
told me that he believed that there must be more to do with this
woman than to marry her. I did not understand him at first; but at
length he explained himself, viz. that she ought to be baptized. I
agreed with him in that part readily, and wished it to be done
presently. "No, no; hold, sir," says he; "though I would have her
be baptized, by all means, for I must observe that Will Atkins, her
husband, has indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, to be
willing to embrace a religious life, and has given her just ideas
of the being of a God; of His power, justice, and mercy: yet I
desire to know of him if he has said anything to her of Jesus
Christ, and of the salvation of sinners; of the nature of faith in
Him, and redemption by Him; of the Holy Spirit, the resurrection,
the last judgment, and the future state."</p>

<p>I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the poor fellow
fell immediately into tears, and told us he had said something to
her of all those things, but that he was himself so wicked a
creature, and his own conscience so reproached him with his horrid,
ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehensions that her
knowledge of him should lessen the attention she should give to
those things, and make her rather contemn religion than receive it;
but he was assured, he said, that her mind was so disposed to
receive due impressions of all those things, and that if I would
but discourse with her, she would make it appear to my satisfaction
that my labour would not be lost upon her.</p>

<p>Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter
between my religious priest and the woman, I entreated him to begin
with her; but sure such a sermon was never preached by a Popish
priest in these latter ages of the world; and as I told him, I
thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all the sincerity
of a Christian, without the error of a Roman Catholic; and that I
took him to be such a clergyman as the Roman bishops were before
the Church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over the
consciences of men. In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace
the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by Him, not with wonder
and astonishment only, as she did the first notions of a God, but
with joy and faith; with an affection, and a surprising degree of
understanding, scarce to be imagined, much less to be expressed;
and, at her own request, she was baptized.</p>

<p>When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him that he
would perform that office with some caution, that the man might not
perceive he was of the Roman Church, if possible, because of other
ill consequences which might attend a difference among us in that
very religion which we were instructing the other in. He told me
that as he had no consecrated chapel, nor proper things for the
office, I should see he would do it in a manner that I should not
know by it that he was a Roman Catholic myself, if I had not known
it before; and so he did; for saying only some words over to
himself in Latin, which I could not understand, he poured a whole
dishful of water upon the woman's head, pronouncing in French, very
loud, "Mary" (which was the name her husband desired me to give
her, for I was her godfather), "I baptize thee in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;" so that none could
know anything by it what religion he was of. He gave the
benediction afterwards in Latin, but either Will Atkins did not
know but it was French, or else did not take notice of it at that
time.</p>

<p>As soon as this was over we married them; and after the marriage
was over, he turned to Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate
manner exhorted him, not only to persevere in that good disposition
he was in, but to support the convictions that were upon him by a
resolution to reform his life: told him it was in vain to say he
repented if he did not forsake his crimes; represented to him how
God had honoured him with being the instrument of bringing his wife
to the knowledge of the Christian religion, and that he should be
careful he did not dishonour the grace of God; and that if he did,
he would see the heathen a better Christian than himself; the
savage converted, and the instrument cast away. He said a great
many good things to them both; and then, recommending them to God's
goodness, gave them the benediction again, I repeating everything
to them in English; and thus ended the ceremony. I think it was the
most pleasant and agreeable day to me that ever I passed in my
whole life. But my clergyman had not done yet: his thoughts hung
continually upon the conversion of the thirty-seven savages, and
fain be would have stayed upon the island to have undertaken it;
but I convinced him, first, that his undertaking was impracticable
in itself; and, secondly, that perhaps I would put it into a way of
being done in his absence to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow
compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship, when the young
man I had taken out of the famished ship's company came to me, and
told me he understood I had a clergyman with me, and that I had
caused the Englishmen to be married to the savages; that he had a
match too, which he desired might be finished before I went,
between two Christians, which he hoped would not be disagreeable to
me.</p>

<p>I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's
servant, for there was no other Christian woman on the island: so I
began to persuade him not to do anything of that kind rashly, or
because be found himself in this solitary circumstance. I
represented to him that he had some considerable substance in the
world, and good friends, as I understood by himself, and the maid
also; that the maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was
unequal to him, she being six or seven and twenty years old, and he
not above seventeen or eighteen; that he might very probably, with
my assistance, make a remove from this wilderness, and come into
his own country again; and that then it would be a thousand to one
but he would repent his choice, and the dislike of that
circumstance might be disadvantageous to both. I was going to say
more, but he interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great
deal of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses&mdash;that he had
nothing of that kind in his thoughts; and he was very glad to hear
that I had an intent of putting them in a way to see their own
country again; and nothing should have made him think of staying
there, but that the voyage I was going was so exceeding long and
hazardous, and would carry him quite out of the reach of all his
friends; that he had nothing to desire of me but that I would
settle him in some little property in the island where he was, give
him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and he would live
here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if ever I returned
to England, I would redeem him. He hoped I would not be unmindful
of him when I came to England: that he would give me some letters
to his friends in London, to let them know how good I had been to
him, and in what part of the world and what circumstances I had
left him in: and he promised me that whenever I redeemed him, the
plantation, and all the improvements he had made upon it, let the
value be what it would, should be wholly mine.</p>

<p>His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his
youth, and was the more agreeable to me, because he told me
positively the match was not for himself. I gave him all possible
assurances that if I lived to come safe to England, I would deliver
his letters, and do his business effectually; and that he might
depend I should never forget the circumstances I had left him in.
But still I was impatient to know who was the person to be married;
upon which he told me it was my Jack-of-all-trades and his maid
Susan. I was most agreeably surprised when he named the match; for,
indeed, I thought it very suitable. The character of that man I
have given already; and as for the maid, she was a very honest,
modest, sober, and religious young woman: had a very good share of
sense, was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very handsomely
and to the purpose, always with decency and good manners, and was
neither too backward to speak when requisite, nor impertinently
forward when it was not her business; very handy and housewifely,
and an excellent manager; fit, indeed, to have been governess to
the whole island; and she knew very well how to behave in every
respect.</p>

<p>The match being proposed in this manner, we married them the
same day; and as I was father at the altar, and gave her away, so I
gave her a portion; for I appointed her and her husband a handsome
large space of ground for their plantation; and indeed this match,
and the proposal the young gentleman made to give him a small
property in the island, put me upon parcelling it out amongst them,
that they might not quarrel afterwards about their situation.</p>

<p>This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins, who was
now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed,
exceedingly pious and religious; and, as far as I may be allowed to
speak positively in such a case, I verily believe he was a true
penitent. He divided things so justly, and so much to every one's
satisfaction, that they only desired one general writing under my
hand for the whole, which I caused to be drawn up, and signed and
sealed, setting out the bounds and situation of every man's
plantation, and testifying that I gave them thereby severally a
right to the whole possession and inheritance of the respective
plantations or farms, with their improvements, to them and their
heirs, reserving all the rest of the island as my own property, and
a certain rent for every particular plantation after eleven years,
if I, or any one from me, or in my name, came to demand it,
producing an attested copy of the same writing. As to the
government and laws among them, I told them I was not capable of
giving them better rules than they were able to give themselves;
only I made them promise me to live in love and good neighbourhood
with one another; and so I prepared to leave them.</p>

<p>One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being now settled
in a kind of commonwealth among themselves, and having much
business in hand, it was odd to have seven-and-thirty Indians live
in a nook of the island, independent, and, indeed, unemployed; for
except the providing themselves food, which they had difficulty
enough to do sometimes, they had no manner of business or property
to manage. I proposed, therefore, to the governor Spaniard that he
should go to them, with Friday's father, and propose to them to
remove, and either plant for themselves, or be taken into their
several families as servants to be maintained for their labour, but
without being absolute slaves; for I would not permit them to make
them slaves by force, by any means; because they had their liberty
given them by capitulation, as it were articles of surrender, which
they ought not to break.</p>

<p>They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all very
cheerfully along with him: so we allotted them land and
plantations, which three or four accepted of, but all the rest
chose to be employed as servants in the several families we had
settled. Thus my colony was in a manner settled as follows: The
Spaniards possessed my original habitation, which was the capital
city, and extended their plantations all along the side of the
brook, which made the creek that I have so often described, as far
as my bower; and as they increased their culture, it went always
eastward. The English lived in the north-east part, where Will
Atkins and his comrades began, and came on southward and
south-west, towards the back part of the Spaniards; and every
plantation had a great addition of land to take in, if they found
occasion, so that they need not jostle one another for want of
room. All the east end of the island was left uninhabited, that if
any of the savages should come on shore there only for their
customary barbarities, they might come and go; if they disturbed
nobody, nobody would disturb them: and no doubt but they were often
ashore, and went away again; for I never heard that the planters
were ever attacked or disturbed any more.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;SAILS FROM THE ISLAND FOR THE BRAZILS</h3>

<p>It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my friend the
clergyman that the work of converting the savages might perhaps be
set on foot in his absence to his satisfaction, and I told him that
now I thought that it was put in a fair way; for the savages, being
thus divided among the Christians, if they would but every one of
them do their part with those which came under their hands, I hoped
it might have a very good effect.</p>

<p>He agreed presently in that, if they did their part. "But how,"
says he, "shall we obtain that of them?" I told him we would call
them all together, and leave it in charge with them, or go to them,
one by one, which he thought best; so we divided it&mdash;he to
speak to the Spaniards, who were all Papists, and I to speak to the
English, who were all Protestants; and we recommended it earnestly
to them, and made them promise that they would never make any
distinction of Papist or Protestant in their exhorting the savages
to turn Christians, but teach them the general knowledge of the
true God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ; and they likewise
promised us that they would never have any differences or disputes
one with another about religion.</p>

<p>When I came to Will Atkins's house, I found that the young woman
I have mentioned above, and Will Atkins's wife, were become
intimates; and this prudent, religious young woman had perfected
the work Will Atkins had begun; and though it was not above four
days after what I have related, yet the new-baptized savage woman
was made such a Christian as I have seldom heard of in all my
observation or conversation in the world. It came next into my
mind, in the morning before I went to them, that amongst all the
needful things I had to leave with them I had not left them a
Bible, in which I showed myself less considering for them than my
good friend the widow was for me when she sent me the cargo of a
hundred pounds from Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles and a
Prayer-book. However, the good woman's charity had a greater extent
than ever she imagined, for they were reserved for the comfort and
instruction of those that made much better use of them than I had
done.</p>

<p>I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came to Will
Atkins's tent, or house, and found the young woman and Atkins's
baptized wife had been discoursing of religion together&mdash;for
Will Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy&mdash;I asked if
they were together now, and he said, "Yes"; so I went into the
house, and he with me, and we found them together very earnest in
discourse. "Oh, sir," says Will Atkins, "when God has sinners to
reconcile to Himself, and aliens to bring home, He never wants a
messenger; my wife has got a new instructor: I knew I was unworthy,
as I was incapable of that work; that young woman has been sent
hither from heaven&mdash;she is enough to convert a whole island of
savages." The young woman blushed, and rose up to go away, but I
desired her to sit-still; I told her she had a good work upon her
hands, and I hoped God would bless her in it.</p>

<p>We talked a little, and I did not perceive that they had any
book among them, though I did not ask; but I put my hand into my
pocket, and pulled out my Bible. "Here," said I to Atkins, "I have
brought you an assistant that perhaps you had not before." The man
was so confounded that he was not able to speak for some time; but,
recovering himself, he takes it with both his hands, and turning to
his wife, "Here, my dear," says he, "did not I tell you our God,
though He lives above, could hear what we have said? Here's the
book I prayed for when you and I kneeled down under the bush; now
God has heard us and sent it." When he had said so, the man fell
into such passionate transports, that between the joy of having it,
and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran down his face like a
child that was crying.</p>

<p>The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a mistake
that none of us were aware of; for she firmly believed God had sent
the book upon her husband's petition. It is true that
providentially it was so, and might be taken so in a consequent
sense; but I believe it would have been no difficult matter at that
time to have persuaded the poor woman to have believed that an
express messenger came from heaven on purpose to bring that
individual book. But it was too serious a matter to suffer any
delusion to take place, so I turned to the young woman, and told
her we did not desire to impose upon the new convert in her first
and more ignorant understanding of things, and begged her to
explain to her that God may be very properly said to answer our
petitions, when, in the course of His providence, such things are
in a particular manner brought to pass as we petitioned for; but we
did not expect returns from heaven in a miraculous and particular
manner, and it is a mercy that it is not so.</p>

<p>This the young woman did afterwards effectually, so that there
was no priestcraft used here; and I should have thought it one of
the most unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so. But
the effect upon Will Atkins is really not to be expressed; and
there, we may be sure, was no delusion. Sure no man was ever more
thankful in the world for anything of its kind than he was for the
Bible, nor, I believe, never any man was glad of a Bible from a
better principle; and though he had been a most profligate
creature, headstrong, furious, and desperately wicked, yet this man
is a standing rule to us all for the well instructing children,
viz. that parents should never give over to teach and instruct, nor
ever despair of the success of their endeavours, let the children
be ever so refractory, or to appearance insensible to instruction;
for if ever God in His providence touches the conscience of such,
the force of their education turns upon them, and the early
instruction of parents is not lost, though it may have been many
years laid asleep, but some time or other they may find the benefit
of it. Thus it was with this poor man: however ignorant he was of
religion and Christian knowledge, he found he had some to do with
now more ignorant than himself, and that the least part of the
instruction of his good father that now came to his mind was of use
to him.</p>

<p>Among the rest, it occurred to him, he said, how his father used
to insist so much on the inexpressible value of the Bible, and the
privilege and blessing of it to nations, families, and persons; but
he never entertained the least notion of the worth of it till now,
when, being to talk to heathens, savages, and barbarians, he wanted
the help of the written oracle for his assistance. The young woman
was glad of it also for the present occasion, though she had one,
and so had the youth, on board our ship among their goods, which
were not yet brought on shore. And now, having said so many things
of this young woman, I cannot omit telling one story more of her
and myself, which has something in it very instructive and
remarkable.</p>

<p>I have related to what extremity the poor young woman was
reduced; how her mistress was starved to death, and died on board
that unhappy ship we met at sea, and how the whole ship's company
was reduced to the last extremity. The gentlewoman, and her son,
and this maid, were first hardly used as to provisions, and at last
totally neglected and starved&mdash;that is to say, brought to the
last extremity of hunger. One day, being discoursing with her on
the extremities they suffered, I asked her if she could describe,
by what she had felt, what it was to starve, and how it appeared?
She said she believed she could, and told her tale very distinctly
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"First, we had for some days fared exceedingly hard, and
suffered very great hunger; but at last we were wholly without food
of any kind except sugar, and a little wine and water. The first
day after I had received no food at all, I found myself towards
evening, empty and sick at the stomach, and nearer night much
inclined to yawning and sleep. I lay down on the couch in the great
cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and awaked a little
refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay down; after
being about three hours awake, it being about five o'clock in the
morning, I found myself empty, and my stomach sickish, and lay down
again, but could not sleep at all, being very faint and ill; and
thus I continued all the second day with a strange
variety&mdash;first hungry, then sick again, with retchings to
vomit. The second night, being obliged to go to bed again without
any food more than a draught of fresh water, and being asleep, I
dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the market was mightily
stocked with provisions; that I bought some for my mistress, and
went and dined very heartily. I thought my stomach was full after
this, as it would have been after a good dinner; but when I awaked
I was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find myself in the
extremity of family. The last glass of wine we had I drank, and put
sugar in it, because of its having some spirit to supply
nourishment; but there being no substance in the stomach for the
digesting office to work upon, I found the only effect of the wine
was to raise disagreeable fumes from the stomach into the head; and
I lay, as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for
some time. The third day, in the morning, after a night of strange,
confused, and inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing than sleeping,
I awaked ravenous and furious with hunger; and I question, had not
my understanding returned and conquered it, whether if I had been a
mother, and had had a little child with me, its life would have
been safe or not. This lasted about three hours, during which time
I was twice raging mad as any creature in Bedlam, as my young
master told me, and as he can now inform you.</p>

<p>"In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction I fell down and
struck my face against the corner of a pallet-bed, in which my
mistress lay, and with the blow the blood gushed out of my nose;
and the cabin-boy bringing me a little basin, I sat down and bled
into it a great deal; and as the blood came from me I came to
myself, and the violence of the flame or fever I was in abated, and
so did the ravenous part of the hunger. Then I grew sick, and
retched to vomit, but could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to
bring up. After I had bled some time I swooned, and they all
believed I was dead; but I came to myself soon after, and then had
a most dreadful pain in my stomach not to be described&mdash;not
like the colic, but a gnawing, eager pain for food; and towards
night it went off with a kind of earnest wishing or longing for
food. I took another draught of water with sugar in it; but my
stomach loathed the sugar and brought it all up again; then I took
a draught of water without sugar, and that stayed with me; and I
laid me down upon the bed, praying most heartily that it would
please God to take me away; and composing my mind in hopes of it, I
slumbered a while, and then waking, thought myself dying, being
light with vapours from an empty stomach. I recommended my soul
then to God, and then earnestly wished that somebody would throw me
into the into the sea.</p>

<p>"All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought,
expiring, but she bore it with much more patience than I, and gave
the last bit of bread she had left to her child, my young master,
who would not have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it; and I
believe it saved his life. Towards the morning I slept again, and
when I awoke I fell into a violent passion of crying, and after
that had a second fit of violent hunger. I got up ravenous, and in
a most dreadful condition; and once or twice I was going to bite my
own arm. At last I saw the basin in which was the blood I had bled
at my nose the day before: I ran to it, and swallowed it with such
haste, and such a greedy appetite, as if I wondered nobody had
taken it before, and afraid it should be taken from me now. After
it was down, though the thoughts of it filled me with horror, yet
it checked the fit of hunger, and I took another draught of water,
and was composed and refreshed for some hours after. This was the
fourth day; and this I kept up till towards night, when, within the
compass of three hours, I had all the several circumstances over
again, one after another, viz. sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain
in the stomach, then ravenous again, then sick, then lunatic, then
crying, then ravenous again, and so every quarter of an hour, and
my strength wasted exceedingly; at night I lay me down, having no
comfort but in the hope that I should die before morning.</p>

<p>"All this night I had no sleep; but the hunger was now turned
into a disease; and I had a terrible colic and griping, by wind
instead of food having found its way into the bowels; and in this
condition I lay till morning, when I was surprised by the cries and
lamentations of my young master, who called out to me that his
mother was dead. I lifted myself up a little, for I had not
strength to rise, but found she was not dead, though she was able
to give very little signs of life. I had then such convulsions in
my stomach, for want of some sustenance, as I cannot describe; with
such frequent throes and pangs of appetite as nothing but the
tortures of death can imitate; and in this condition I was when I
heard the seamen above cry out, 'A sail! a sail!' and halloo and
jump about as if they were distracted. I was not able to get off
from the bed, and my mistress much less; and my young master was so
sick that I thought he had been expiring; so we could not open the
cabin door, or get any account what it was that occasioned such
confusion; nor had we had any conversation with the ship's company
for twelve days, they having told us that they had not a mouthful
of anything to eat in the ship; and this they told us
afterwards&mdash;they thought we had been dead. It was this
dreadful condition we were in when you were sent to save our lives;
and how you found us, sir, you know as well as I, and better
too."</p>

<p>This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of
starving to death, as, I confess, I never met with, and was
exceeding instructive to me. I am the rather apt to believe it to
be a true account, because the youth gave me an account of a good
part of it; though I must own, not so distinct and so feeling as
the maid; and the rather, because it seems his mother fed him at
the price of her own life: but the poor maid, whose constitution
was stronger than that of her mistress, who was in years, and a
weakly woman too, might struggle harder with it; nevertheless she
might be supposed to feel the extremity something sooner than her
mistress, who might be allowed to keep the last bit something
longer than she parted with any to relieve her maid. No question,
as the case is here related, if our ship or some other had not so
providentially met them, but a few days more would have ended all
their lives. I now return to my disposition of things among the
people. And, first, it is to be observed here, that for many
reasons I did not think fit to let them know anything of the sloop
I had framed, and which I thought of setting up among them; for I
found, at least at my first coming, such seeds of division among
them, that I saw plainly, had I set up the sloop, and left it among
them, they would, upon every light disgust, have separated, and
gone away from one another; or perhaps have turned pirates, and so
made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober
and religious people, as I intended it; nor did I leave the two
pieces of brass cannon that I had on board, or the extra two
quarter-deck guns that my nephew had provided, for the same reason.
I thought it was enough to qualify them for a defensive war against
any that should invade them, but not to set them up for an
offensive war, or to go abroad to attack others; which, in the end,
would only bring ruin and destruction upon them. I reserved the
sloop, therefore, and the guns, for their service another way, as I
shall observe in its place.</p>

<p>Having now done with the island, I left them all in good
circumstances and in a flourishing condition, and went on board my
ship again on the 6th of May, having been about twenty-five days
among them: and as they were all resolved to stay upon the island
till I came to remove them, I promised to send them further relief
from the Brazils, if I could possibly find an opportunity. I
particularly promised to send them some cattle, such as sheep,
hogs, and cows: as to the two cows and calves which I brought from
England, we had been obliged, by the length of our voyage, to kill
them at sea, for want of hay to feed them.</p>

<p>The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at parting, we
set sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints in the Brazils in
about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable in our passage
but this: that about three days after we had sailed, being
becalmed, and the current setting strong to the ENE., running, as
it were, into a bay or gulf on the land side, we were driven
something out of our course, and once or twice our men cried out,
"Land to the eastward!" but whether it was the continent or islands
we could not tell by any means. But the third day, towards evening,
the sea smooth, and the weather calm, we saw the sea as it were
covered towards the land with something very black; not being able
to discover what it was till after some time, our chief mate, going
up the main shrouds a little way, and looking at them with a
perspective, cried out it was an army. I could not imagine what he
meant by an army, and thwarted him a little hastily. "Nay, sir,"
says he, "don't be angry, for 'tis an army, and a fleet too: for I
believe there are a thousand canoes, and you may see them paddle
along, for they are coming towards us apace."</p>

<p>I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my nephew the
captain; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in the
island, and having never been in those seas before, that he could
not tell what to think of it, but said, two or three times, we
should all be devoured. I must confess, considering we were
becalmed, and the current set strong towards the shore, I liked it
the worse; however, I bade them not be afraid, but bring the ship
to an anchor as soon as we came so near as to know that we must
engage them. The weather continued calm, and they came on apace
towards us, so I gave orders to come to an anchor, and furl all our
sails; as for the savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but
fire, and therefore they should get their boats out, and fasten
them, one close by the head and the other by the stern, and man
them both well, and wait the issue in that posture: this I did,
that the men in the boats might he ready with sheets and buckets to
put out any fire these savages might endeavour to fix to the
outside of the ship.</p>

<p>In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they
came up with us; but never was such a horrid sight seen by
Christians; though my mate was much mistaken in his calculation of
their number, yet when they came up we reckoned about a hundred and
twenty-six canoes; some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in
them, and some more, and the least six or seven. When they came
nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with wonder and
astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless they had never seen
before; nor could they at first, as we afterwards understood, know
what to make of us; they came boldly up, however, very near to us,
and seemed to go about to row round us; but we called to our men in
the boats not to let them come too near them. This very order
brought us to an engagement with them, without our designing it;
for five or six of the large canoes came so near our long-boat,
that our men beckoned with their hands to keep them back, which
they understood very well, and went back: but at their retreat
about fifty arrows came on board us from those boats, and one of
our men in the long-boat was very much wounded. However, I called
to them not to fire by any means; but we handed down some deal
boards into the boat, and the carpenter presently set up a kind of
fence, like waste boards, to cover them from the arrows of the
savages, if they should shoot again.</p>

<p>About half-an-hour afterwards they all came up in a body astern
of us, and so near that we could easily discern what they were,
though we could not tell their design; and I easily found they were
some of my old friends, the same sort of savages that I had been
used to engage with. In a short time more they rowed a little
farther out to sea, till they came directly broadside with us, and
then rowed down straight upon us, till they came so near that they
could hear us speak; upon this, I ordered all my men to keep close,
lest they should shoot any more arrows, and made all our guns
ready; but being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go
out upon the deck, and call out aloud to them in his language, to
know what they meant. Whether they understood him or not, that I
knew not; but as soon as he had called to them, six of them, who
were in the foremost or nighest boat to us, turned their canoes
from us, and stooping down, showed us their naked backs; whether
this was a defiance or challenge we knew not, or whether it was
done in mere contempt, or as a signal to the rest; but immediately
Friday cried out they were going to shoot, and, unhappily for him,
poor fellow, they let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and
to my inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being
in their sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than three
arrows, and about three more fell very near him; such unlucky
marksmen they were!</p>

<p>I was so annoyed at the loss of my old trusty servant and
companion, that I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with
small shot, and four with great, and gave them such a broadside as
they had never heard in their lives before. They were not above
half a cable's length off when we fired; and our gunners took their
aim so well, that three or four of their canoes were overset, as we
had reason to believe, by one shot only. The ill manners of turning
up their bare backs to us gave us no great offence; neither did I
know for certain whether that which would pass for the greatest
contempt among us might be understood so by them or not; therefore,
in return, I had only resolved to have fired four or five guns at
them with powder only, which I knew would frighten them
sufficiently: but when they shot at us directly with all the fury
they were capable of, and especially as they had killed my poor
Friday, whom I so entirely loved and valued, and who, indeed, so
well deserved it, I thought myself not only justifiable before God
and man, but would have been very glad if I could have overset
every canoe there, and drowned every one of them.</p>

<p>I can neither tell how many we killed nor how many we wounded at
this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry never were seen
among such a multitude; there were thirteen or fourteen of their
canoes split and overset in all, and the men all set a-swimming:
the rest, frightened out of their wits, scoured away as fast as
they could, taking but little care to save those whose boats were
split or spoiled with our shot; so I suppose that many of them were
lost; and our men took up one poor fellow swimming for his life,
above an hour after they were all gone. The small shot from our
cannon must needs kill and wound a great many; but, in short, we
never knew how it went with them, for they fled so fast, that in
three hours or thereabouts we could not see above three or four
straggling canoes, nor did we ever see the rest any more; for a
breeze of wind springing up the same evening, we weighed and set
sail for the Brazils.</p>

<p>We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sullen that
he would neither cat nor speak, and we all fancied he would starve
himself to death. But I took a way to cure him: for I had made them
take him and turn him into the long-boat, and make him believe they
would toss him into the sea again, and so leave him where they
found him, if he would not speak; nor would that do, but they
really did throw him into the sea, and came away from him. Then he
followed them, for he swam like a cork, and called to them in his
tongue, though they knew not one word of what he said; however at
last they took him in again., and then he began to be more
tractable: nor did I ever design they should drown him.</p>

<p>We were now under sail again, but I was the most disconsolate
creature alive for want of my man Friday, and would have been very
glad to have gone back to the island, to have taken one of the rest
from thence for my occasion, but it could not be: so we went on. We
had one prisoner, as I have said, and it was a long time before we
could make him understand anything; but in time our men taught him
some English, and he began to be a little tractable. Afterwards, we
inquired what country he came from; but could make nothing of what
he said; for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, and he spoke in
the throat in such a hollow, odd manner, that we could never form a
word after him; and we were all of opinion that they might speak
that language as well if they were gagged as otherwise; nor could
we perceive that they had any occasion either for teeth, tongue,
lips, or palate, but formed their words just as a hunting-horn
forms a tune with an open throat. He told us, however, some time
after, when we had taught him to speak a little English, that they
were going with their kings to fight a great battle. When he said
kings, we asked him how many kings? He said they were five nation
(we could not make him understand the plural 's'), and that they
all joined to go against two nation. We asked him what made them
come up to us? He said, "To makee te great wonder look." Here it is
to be observed that all those natives, as also those of Africa when
they learn English, always add two e's at the end of the words
where we use one; and they place the accent upon them, as makee,
takee, and the like; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave it off,
though at last he did.</p>

<p>And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my last
leave of him. Poor honest Friday! We buried him with all the
decency and solemnity possible, by putting him into a coffin, and
throwing him into the sea; and I caused them to fire eleven guns
for him. So ended the life of the most grateful, faithful, honest,
and most affectionate servant that ever man had.</p>

<p>We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil; and in about
twelve days' time we made land, in the latitude of five degrees
south of the line, being the north-easternmost land of all that
part of America. We kept on S. by E., in sight of the shore four
days, when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three days came to an
anchor off the bay of All Saints, the old place of my deliverance,
from whence came both my good and evil fate. Never ship came to
this port that had less business than I had, and yet it was with
great difficulty that we were admitted to hold the least
correspondence on shore: not my partner himself, who was alive, and
made a great figure among them, not my two merchant-trustees, not
the fame of my wonderful preservation in the island, could obtain
me that favour. My partner, however, remembering that I had given
five hundred moidores to the prior of the monastery of the
Augustines, and two hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went to
the monastery, and obliged the prior that then was to go to the
governor, and get leave for me personally, with the captain and one
more, besides eight seamen, to come on shore, and no more; and this
upon condition, absolutely capitulated for, that we should not
offer to land any goods out of the ship, or to carry any person
away without licence. They were so strict with us as to landing any
goods, that it was with extreme difficulty that I got on shore
three bales of English goods, such as fine broadcloths, stuffs, and
some linen, which I had brought for a present to my partner.</p>

<p>He was a very generous, open-hearted man, although he began,
like me, with little at first. Though he knew not that I had the
least design of giving him anything, he sent me on board a present
of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth about thirty
moidores, including some tobacco, and three or four fine medals of
gold: but I was even with him in my present, which, as I have said,
consisted of fine broadcloth, English stuffs, lace, and fine
holland; also, I delivered him about the value of one hundred
pounds sterling in the same goods, for other uses; and I obliged
him to set up the sloop, which I had brought with me from England,
as I have said, for the use of my colony, in order to send the
refreshments I intended to my plantation.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he got hands, and finished the sloop in a very few
days, for she was already framed; and I gave the master of her such
instructions that he could not miss the place; nor did he, as I had
an account from my partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded with
the small cargo I sent them; and one of our seamen, that had been
on shore with me there, offered to go with the sloop and settle
there, upon my letter to the governor Spaniard to allot him a
sufficient quantity of land for a plantation, and on my giving him
some clothes and tools for his planting work, which he said he
understood, having been an old planter at Maryland, and a buccaneer
into the bargain. I encouraged the fellow by granting all he
desired; and, as an addition, I gave him the savage whom we had
taken prisoner of war to be his slave, and ordered the governor
Spaniard to give him his share of everything he wanted with the
rest.</p>

<p>When we came to fit this man out, my old partner told me there
was a certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter of his
acquaintance, who had fallen into the displeasure of the Church. "I
know not what the matter is with him," says he, "but, on my
conscience, I think he is a heretic in his heart, and he has been
obliged to conceal himself for fear of the Inquisition." He then
told me that he would be very glad of such an opportunity to make
his escape, with his wife and two daughters; and if I would let
them go to my island, and allot them a plantation, he would give
them a small stock to begin with&mdash;for the officers of the
Inquisition had seized all his effects and estate, and he had
nothing left but a little household stuff and two slaves; "and,"
adds he, "though I hate his principles, yet I would not have him
fall into their hands, for he will be assuredly burned alive if he
does." I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with
them: and we concealed the man, and his wife and daughters, on
board our ship, till the sloop put out to go to sea; and then
having put all their goods on board some time before, we put them
on board the sloop after she was got out of the bay. Our seaman was
mightily pleased with this new partner; and their stocks, indeed,
were much alike, rich in tools, in preparations, and a
farm&mdash;but nothing to begin with, except as above: however,
they carried over with them what was worth all the rest, some
materials for planting sugar-canes, with some plants of canes,
which he, I mean the Brazil planter, understood very well.</p>

<p>Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the island,
I sent them by the sloop three milch cows and five calves; about
twenty-two hogs, among them three sows; two mares, and a
stone-horse. For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I engaged
three Brazil women to go, and recommended it to them to marry them,
and use them kindly. I could have procured more women, but I
remembered that the poor persecuted man had two daughters, and that
there were but five of the Spaniards that wanted partners; the rest
had wives of their own, though in another country. All this cargo
arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose, was very welcome to
my old inhabitants, who were now, with this addition, between sixty
and seventy people, besides little children, of which there were a
great many. I found letters at London from them all, by way of
Lisbon, when I came back to England.</p>

<p>I have now done with the island, and all manner of discourse
about it: and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums would do
well to turn his thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read of
the follies of an old man, not warned by his own harms, much less
by those of other men, to beware; not cooled by almost forty years'
miseries and disappointments&mdash;not satisfied with prosperity
beyond expectation, nor made cautious by afflictions and distress
beyond example.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX&mdash;DREADFUL OCCURRENCES IN MADAGASCAR</h3>

<p>I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a man at
full liberty has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and desire him to
lock him up among the prisoners there, and starve him. Had I taken
a small vessel from England and gone directly to the island; had I
loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all the necessaries for
the plantation and for my people; taken a patent from the
government here to have secured my property, in subjection only to
that of England; had I carried over cannon and ammunition, servants
and people to plant, and taken possession of the place, fortified
and strengthened it in the name of England, and increased it with
people, as I might easily have done; had I then settled myself
there, and sent the ship back laden with good rice, as I might also
have done in six months' time, and ordered my friends to have
fitted her out again for our supply&mdash;had I done this, and
stayed there myself, I had at least acted like a man of common
sense. But I was possessed of a wandering spirit, and scorned all
advantages: I pleased myself with being the patron of the people I
placed there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty, majestic
way, like an old patriarchal monarch, providing for them as if I
had been father of the whole family, as well as of the plantation.
But I never so much as pretended to plant in the name of any
government or nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or to call my
people subjects to any one nation more than another; nay, I never
so much as gave the place a name, but left it as I found it,
belonging to nobody, and the people under no discipline or
government but my own, who, though I had influence over them as a
father and benefactor, had no authority or power to act or command
one way or other, further than voluntary consent moved them to
comply. Yet even this, had I stayed there, would have done well
enough; but as I rambled from them, and came there no more, the
last letters I had from any of them were by my partner's means, who
afterwards sent another sloop to the place, and who sent me word,
though I had not the letter till I got to London, several years
after it was written, that they went on but poorly; were
discontented with their long stay there; that Will Atkins was dead;
that five of the Spaniards were come away; and though they had not
been much molested by the savages, yet they had had some skirmishes
with them; and that they begged of him to write to me to think of
the promise I had made to fetch them away, that they might see
their country again before they died.</p>

<p>But I was gone a wildgoose chase indeed, and they that will have
any more of me must be content to follow me into a new variety of
follies, hardships, and wild adventures, wherein the justice of
Providence may be duly observed; and we may see how easily Heaven
can gorge us with our own desires, make the strongest of our wishes
be our affliction, and punish us most severely with those very
things which we think it would be our utmost happiness to be
allowed to possess. Whether I had business or no business, away I
went: it is no time now to enlarge upon the reason or absurdity of
my own conduct, but to come to the history&mdash;I was embarked for
the voyage, and the voyage I went.</p>

<p>I shall only add a word or two concerning my honest Popish
clergyman, for let their opinion of us, and all other heretics in
general, as they call us, be as uncharitable as it may, I verily
believe this man was very sincere, and wished the good of all men:
yet I believe he used reserve in many of his expressions, to
prevent giving me offence; for I scarce heard him once call on the
Blessed Virgin, or mention St. Jago, or his guardian angel, though
so common with the rest of them. However, I say I had not the least
doubt of his sincerity and pious intentions; and I am firmly of
opinion, if the rest of the Popish missionaries were like him, they
would strive to visit even the poor Tartars and Laplanders, where
they have nothing to give them, as well as covet to flock to India,
Persia, China, &amp;c., the most wealthy of the heathen countries;
for if they expected to bring no gains to their Church by it, it
may well be admired how they came to admit the Chinese Confucius
into the calendar of the Christian saints.</p>

<p>A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious priest asked me
leave to go thither; being still, as he observed, bound never to
finish any voyage he began. How happy it had been for me if I had
gone with him. But it was too late now; all things Heaven appoints
for the best: had I gone with him I had never had so many things to
be thankful for, and the reader had never heard of the second part
of the travels and adventures of Robinson Crusoe: so I must here
leave exclaiming at myself, and go on with my voyage. From the
Brazils we made directly over the Atlantic Sea to the Cape of Good
Hope, and had a tolerably good voyage, our course generally
south-east, now and then a storm, and some contrary winds; but my
disasters at sea were at an end&mdash;my future rubs and cross
events were to befall me on shore, that it might appear the land
was as well prepared to be our scourge as the sea.</p>

<p>Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board,
who was to direct all her motions after she arrived at the Cape,
only being limited to a certain number of days for stay, by
charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to. This was none
of my business, neither did I meddle with it; my nephew, the
captain, and the supercargo adjusting all those things between them
as they thought fit. We stayed at the Cape no longer than was
needful to take in-fresh water, but made the best of our way for
the coast of Coromandel. We were, indeed, informed that a French
man-of-war, of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone
for the Indies; and as I knew we were at war with France, I had
some apprehensions of them; but they went their own way, and we
heard no more of them.</p>

<p>I shall not pester the reader with a tedious description of
places, journals of our voyage, variations of the compass,
latitudes, trade-winds, &amp;c.; it is enough to name the ports and
places which we touched at, and what occurred to us upon our
passages from one to another. We touched first at the island of
Madagascar, where, though the people are fierce and treacherous,
and very well armed with lances and bows, which they use with
inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with them a while.
They treated us very civilly; and for some trifles which we gave
them, such as knives, scissors, &amp;c., they brought us eleven
good fat bullocks, of a middling size, which we took in, partly for
fresh provisions for our present spending, and the rest to salt for
the ship's use.</p>

<p>We were obliged to stay here some time after we had furnished
ourselves with provisions; and I, who was always too curious to
look into every nook of the world wherever I came, went on shore as
often as I could. It was on the east side of the island that we
went on shore one evening: and the people, who, by the way, are
very numerous, came thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a
distance. As we had traded freely with them, and had been kindly
used, we thought ourselves in no danger; but when we saw the
people, we cut three boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a
distance from us; which, it seems, is a mark in that country not
only of a truce and friendship, but when it is accepted the other
side set up three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they
accept the truce too; but then this is a known condition of the
truce, that you are not to pass beyond their three poles towards
them, nor they to come past your three poles or boughs towards you;
so that you are perfectly secure within the three poles, and all
the space between your poles and theirs is allowed like a market
for free converse, traffic, and commerce. When you go there you
must not carry your weapons with you; and if they come into that
space they stick up their javelins and lances all at the first
poles, and come on unarmed; but if any violence is offered them,
and the truce thereby broken, away they run to the poles, and lay
hold of their weapons, and the truce is at an end.</p>

<p>It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a greater
number of their people came down than usual, but all very friendly
and civil; and they brought several kinds of provisions, for which
we satisfied them with such toys as we had; the women also brought
us milk and roots, and several things very acceptable to us, and
all was quiet; and we made us a little tent or hut of some boughs
or trees, and lay on shore all night. I know not what was the
occasion, but I was not so well satisfied to lie on shore as the
rest; and the boat riding at an anchor at about a stone's cast from
the land, with two men in her to take care of her, I made one of
them come on shore; and getting some boughs of trees to cover us
also in the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and
lay under the cover of the branches of the trees all night in the
boat.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our men making
a terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for God's sake, to
bring the boat in and come and help them, for they were all like to
be murdered; and at the same time I heard the fire of five muskets,
which was the number of guns they had, and that three times over;
for it seems the natives here were not so easily frightened with
guns as the savages were in America, where I had to do with them.
All this while, I knew not what was the matter, but rousing
immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to be
thrust in, and resolved with three fusees we had on board to land
and assist our men. We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men
were in too much haste; for being come to the shore, they plunged
into the water, to get to the boat with all the expedition they
could, being pursued by between three and four hundred men. Our men
were but nine in all, and only five of them had fusees with them;
the rest had pistols and swords, indeed, but they were of small use
to them.</p>

<p>We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty enough too,
three of them being very ill wounded; and that which was still
worse was, that while we stood in the boat to take our men in, we
were in as much danger as they were in on shore; for they poured
their arrows in upon us so thick that we were glad to barricade the
side of the boat up with the benches, and two or three loose boards
which, to our great satisfaction, we had by mere accident in the
boat. And yet, had it been daylight, they are, it seems, such exact
marksmen, that if they could have seen but the least part of any of
us, they would have been sure of us. We had, by the light of the
moon, a little sight of them, as they stood pelting us from the
shore with darts and arrows; and having got ready our firearms, we
gave them a volley that we could hear, by the cries of some of
them, had wounded several; however, they stood thus in battle array
on the shore till break of day, which we supposed was that they
might see the better to take their aim at us.</p>

<p>In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our
anchor, or set up our sail, because we must needs stand up in the
boat, and they were as sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a
tree with small shot. We made signals of distress to the ship, and
though she rode a league off, yet my nephew, the captain, hearing
our firing, and by glasses perceiving the posture we lay in, and
that we fired towards the shore, pretty well understood us; and
weighing anchor with all speed, he stood as near the shore as he
durst with the ship, and then sent another boat with ten hands in
her, to assist us. We called to them not to come too near, telling
them what condition we were in; however, they stood in near to us,
and one of the men taking the end of a tow-line in his hand, and
keeping our boat between him and the enemy, so that they could not
perfectly see him, swam on board us, and made fast the line to the
boat: upon which we slipped out a little cable, and leaving our
anchor behind, they towed us out of reach of the arrows; we all the
while lying close behind the barricade we had made. As soon as we
were got from between the ship and the shore, that we could lay her
side to the shore, she ran along just by them, and poured in a
broadside among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small
bullets, and such stuff, besides the great shot, which made a
terrible havoc among them.</p>

<p>When we were got on board and out of danger, we had time to
examine into the occasion of this fray; and indeed our supercargo,
who had been often in those parts, put me upon it; for he said he
was sure the inhabitants would not have touched us after we had
made a truce, if we had not done something to provoke them to it.
At length it came out that an old woman, who had come to sell us
some milk, had brought it within our poles, and a young woman with
her, who also brought us some roots or herbs; and while the old
woman (whether she was mother to the young woman or no they could
not tell) was selling us the milk, one of our men offered some
rudeness to the girl that was with her, at which the old woman made
a great noise: however, the seaman would not quit his prize, but
carried her out of the old woman's sight among the trees, it being
almost dark; the old woman went away without her, and, as we may
suppose, made an outcry among the people she came from; who, upon
notice, raised that great army upon us in three or four hours, and
it was great odds but we had all been destroyed.</p>

<p>One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just at the
beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they had
made; the rest came off free, all but the fellow who was the
occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his
brutality, for we could not hear what became of him for a great
while. We lay upon the shore two days after, though the wind
presented, and made signals for him, and made our boat sail up
shore and down shore several leagues, but in vain; so we were
obliged to give him over; and if he alone had suffered for it, the
loss had been less. I could not satisfy myself, however, without
venturing on shore once more, to try if I could learn anything of
him or them; it was the third night after the action that I had a
great mind to learn, if I could by any means, what mischief we had
done, and how the game stood on the Indians' side. I was careful to
do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again: but I ought
indeed to have been sure that the men I went with had been under my
command, before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievous
as I was brought into by it, without design.</p>

<p>We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the ship,
besides the supercargo and myself, and we landed two hours before
midnight, at the same place where the Indians stood drawn up in the
evening before. I landed here, because my design, as I have said,
was chiefly to see if they had quitted the field, and if they had
left any marks behind them of the mischief we had done them, and I
thought if we could surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might
get our man again, by way of exchange.</p>

<p>We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two
bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded one and I the other. We
neither saw nor heard anybody stir when we landed: and we marched
up, one body at a distance from another, to the place. At first we
could see nothing, it being very dark; till by-and-by our
boatswain, who led the first party, stumbled and fell over a dead
body. This made them halt a while; for knowing by the circumstances
that they were at the place where the Indians had stood, they
waited for my coming up there. We concluded to halt till the moon
began to rise, which we knew would be in less than an hour, when we
could easily discern the havoc we had made among them. We told
thirty-two bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite dead;
some had an arm and some a leg shot off, and one his head; those
that were wounded, we supposed, they had carried away. When we had
made, as I thought, a full discovery of all we could come to the
knowledge of, I resolved on going on board; but the boatswain and
his party sent me word that they were resolved to make a visit to
the Indian town, where these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and
asked me to go along with them; and if they could find them, as
they still fancied they should, they did not doubt of getting a
good booty; and it might be they might find Tom Jeffry there: that
was the man's name we had lost.</p>

<p>Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough what
answer to have given them; for I should have commanded them
instantly on board, knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to run,
who had a ship and ship-loading in our charge, and a voyage to make
which depended very much upon the lives of the men; but as they
sent me word they were resolved to go, and only asked me and my
company to go along with them, I positively refused it, and rose
up, for I was sitting on the ground, in order to go to the boat.
One or two of the men began to importune me to go; and when I
refused, began to grumble, and say they were not under my command,
and they would go. "Come, Jack," says one of the men, "will you go
with me? I'll go for one." Jack said he would&mdash;and then
another&mdash;and, in a word, they all left me but one, whom I
persuaded to stay, and a boy left in the boat. So the supercargo
and I, with the third man, went back to the boat, where we told
them we would stay for them, and take care to take in as many of
them as should be left; for I told them it was a mad thing they
were going about, and supposed most of them would have the fate of
Tom Jeffry.</p>

<p>They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they would come
off again, and they would take care, &amp;c.; so away they went. I
entreated them to consider the ship and the voyage, that their
lives were not their own, and that they were entrusted with the
voyage, in some measure; that if they miscarried, the ship might be
lost for want of their help, and that they could not answer for it
to God or man. But I might as well have talked to the mainmast of
the ship: they were mad upon their journey; only they gave me good
words, and begged I would not be angry; that they did not doubt but
they would be back again in about an hour at furthest; for the
Indian town, they said, was not above half-a mile off, though they
found it above two miles before they got to it.</p>

<p>Well, they all went away, and though the attempt was desperate,
and such as none but madmen would have gone about, yet, to give
them their due, they went about it as warily as boldly; they were
gallantly armed, for they had every man a fusee or musket, a
bayonet, and a pistol; some of them had broad cutlasses, some of
them had hangers, and the boatswain and two more had poleaxes;
besides all which they had among them thirteen hand grenadoes.
Bolder fellows, and better provided, never went about any wicked
work in the world. When they went out their chief design was
plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there; but a
circumstance which none of them were aware of set them on fire with
revenge, and made devils of them all.</p>

<p>When they came to the few Indian houses which they thought had
been the town, which was not above half a mile off, they were under
great disappointment, for there were not above twelve or thirteen
houses, and where the town was, or how big, they knew not. They
consulted, therefore, what to do, and were some time before they
could resolve; for if they fell upon these, they must cut all their
throats; and it was ten to one but some of them might escape, it
being in the night, though the moon was up; and if one escaped, he
would run and raise all the town, so they should have a whole army
upon them; on the other hand, if they went away and left those
untouched, for the people were all asleep, they could not tell
which way to look for the town; however, the last was the best
advice, so they resolved to leave them, and look for the town as
well as they could. They went on a little way, and found a cow tied
to a tree; this, they presently concluded, would be a good guide to
them; for, they said, the cow certainly belonged to the town before
them, or the town behind them, and if they untied her, they should
see which way she went: if she went back, they had nothing to say
to her; but if she went forward, they would follow her. So they cut
the cord, which was made of twisted flags, and the cow went on
before them, directly to the town; which, as they reported,
consisted of above two hundred houses or huts, and in some of these
they found several families living together.</p>

<p>Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure as sleep
could make them: and first, they called another council, to
consider what they had to do; and presently resolved to divide
themselves into three bodies, and so set three houses on fire in
three parts of the town; and as the men came out, to seize them and
bind them (if any resisted, they need not be asked what to do
then), and so to search the rest of the houses for plunder: but
they resolved to march silently first through the town, and see
what dimensions it was of, and if they might venture upon it or
no.</p>

<p>They did so, and desperately resolved that they would venture
upon them: but while they were animating one another to the work,
three of them, who were a little before the rest, called out aloud
to them, and told them that they had found&mdash;Tom Jeffry: they
all ran up to the place, where they found the poor fellow hanging
up naked by one arm, and his throat cut. There was an Indian house
just by the tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen of the
principal Indians, who had been concerned in the fray with us
before, and two or three of them wounded with our shot; and our men
found they were awake, and talking one to another in that house,
but knew not their number.</p>

<p>The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, as
before, that they swore to one another that they would be revenged,
and that not an Indian that came into their hands should have any
quarter; and to work they went immediately, and yet not so madly as
might be expected from the rage and fury they were in. Their first
care was to get something that would soon take fire, but, after a
little search, they found that would be to no purpose; for most of
the houses were low, and thatched with flags and rushes, of which
the country is full; so they presently made some wildfire, as we
call it, by wetting a little powder in the palm of their hands, and
in a quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in four or five
places, and particularly that house where the Indians were not gone
to bed.</p>

<p>As soon as the fire begun to blaze, the poor frightened
creatures began to rush out to save their lives, but met with their
fate in the attempt; and especially at the door, where they drove
them back, the boatswain himself killing one or two with his
poleaxe. The house being large, and many in it, he did not care to
go in, but called for a hand grenado, and threw it among them,
which at first frightened them, but, when it burst, made such havoc
among them that they cried out in a hideous manner. In short, most
of the Indians who were in the open part of the house were killed
or hurt with the grenado, except two or three more who pressed to
the door, which the boatswain and two more kept, with their
bayonets on the muzzles of their pieces, and despatched all that
came in their way; but there was another apartment in the house,
where the prince or king, or whatever he was, and several others
were; and these were kept in till the house, which was by this time
all in a light flame, fell in upon them, and they were smothered
together.</p>

<p>All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not
waken the people faster than they could master them; but the fire
began to waken them fast enough, and our fellows were glad to keep
a little together in bodies; for the fire grew so raging, all the
houses being made of light combustible stuff, that they could
hardly bear the street between them. Their business was to follow
the fire, for the surer execution: as fast as the fire either
forced the people out of those houses which were burning, or
frightened them out of others, our people were ready at their doors
to knock them on the head, still calling and hallooing one to
another to remember Tom Jeffry.</p>

<p>While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy, and
especially when I saw the flames of the town, which, it being
night, seemed to be close by me. My nephew, the captain, who was
roused by his men seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing
what the matter was, or what danger I was in, especially hearing
the guns too, for by this time they began to use their firearms; a
thousand thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the
supercargo, what would become of us; and at last, though he could
ill spare any more men, yet not knowing what exigence we might be
in, he took another boat, and with thirteen men and himself came
ashore to me.</p>

<p>He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat with
no more than two men; and though he was glad that we were well, yet
he was in the same impatience with us to know what was doing; for
the noise continued, and the flame increased; in short, it was next
to an impossibility for any men in the world to restrain their
curiosity to know what had happened, or their concern for the
safety of the men: in a word, the captain told me he would go and
help his men, let what would come. I argued with him, as I did
before with the men, the safety of the ship, the danger of the
voyage, the interests of the owners and merchants, &amp;c., and
told him I and the two men would go, and only see if we could at a
distance learn what was likely to be the event, and come back and
tell him. It was in vain to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk to
the rest before; he would go, he said; and he only wished he had
left but ten men in the ship, for he could not think of having his
men lost for want of help: he had rather lose the ship, the voyage,
and his life, and all; and away he went.</p>

<p>I was no more able to stay behind now than I was to persuade
them not to go; so the captain ordered two men to row back the
pinnace, and fetch twelve men more, leaving the long-boat at an
anchor; and that, when they came back, six men should keep the two
boats, and six more come after us; so that he left only sixteen men
in the ship: for the whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five
men, whereof two were lost in the late quarrel which brought this
mischief on.</p>

<p>Being now on the march, we felt little of the ground we trod on;
and being guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to
the place of the flame. If the noise of the guns was surprising to
us before, the cries of the poor people were now quite of another
nature, and filled us with horror. I must confess I was never at
the sacking a city, or at the taking a town by storm. I had heard
of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and killing man,
woman, and child; and I had read of Count Tilly sacking the city of
Magdeburg and cutting the throats of twenty-two thousand of all
sexes; but I never had an idea of the thing itself before, nor is
it possible to describe it, or the horror that was upon our minds
at hearing it. However, we went on, and at length came to the town,
though there was no entering the streets of it for the fire. The
first object we met with was the ruins of a hut or house, or rather
the ashes of it, for the house was consumed; and just before it,
plainly now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men and
three women, killed, and, as we thought, one or two more lay in the
heap among the fire; in short, there were such instances of rage,
altogether barbarous, and of a fury something beyond what was
human, that we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of it;
or, if they were the authors of it, we thought they ought to be
every one of them put to the worst of deaths. But this was not all:
we saw the fire increase forward, and the cry went on just as the
fire went on; so that we were in the utmost confusion. We advanced
a little way farther, and behold, to our astonishment, three naked
women, and crying in a most dreadful manner, came flying as if they
had wings, and after them sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the
same terror and consternation, with three of our English butchers
in the rear, who, when they could not overtake them, fired in among
them, and one that was killed by their shot fell down in our sight.
When the rest saw us, believing us to be their enemies, and that we
would murder them as well as those that pursued them, they set up a
most dreadful shriek, especially the women; and two of them fell
down, as if already dead, with the fright.</p>

<p>My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in my
veins, when I saw this; and, I believe, had the three English
sailors that pursued them come on, I had made our men kill them
all; however, we took some means to let the poor flying creatures
know that we would not hurt them; and immediately they came up to
us, and kneeling down, with their hands lifted up, made piteous
lamentation to us to save them, which we let them know we would:
whereupon they crept all together in a huddle close behind us, as
for protection. I left my men drawn up together, and, charging them
to hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get at some of our people, and
see what devil it was possessed them, and what they intended to do,
and to command them off; assuring them that if they stayed till
daylight they would have a hundred thousand men about their ears: I
say I left them, and went among those flying people, taking only
two of our men with me; and there was, indeed, a piteous spectacle
among them. Some of them had their feet terribly burned with
trampling and running through the fire; others their hands burned;
one of the women had fallen down in the fire, and was very much
burned before she could get out again; and two or three of the men
had cuts in their backs and thighs, from our men pursuing; and
another was shot through the body and died while I was there.</p>

<p>I would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was; but
I could not understand one word they said; though, by signs, I
perceived some of them knew not what was the occasion themselves. I
was so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt that I
could not stay there, but went back to my own men, and resolved to
go into the middle of the town, through the fire, or whatever might
be in the way, and put an end to it, cost what it would;
accordingly, as I came back to my men, I told them my resolution,
and commanded them to follow me, when, at the very moment, came
four of our men, with the boatswain at their head, roving over
heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered with blood and dust,
as if they wanted more people to massacre, when our men hallooed to
them as loud as they could halloo; and with much ado one of them
made them hear, so that they knew who we were, and came up to
us.</p>

<p>As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo like a shout
of triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come; and without
waiting to hear me, "Captain," says he, "noble captain! I am glad
you are come; we have not half done yet. Villainous hell-hound
dogs! I'll kill as many of them as poor Tom has hairs upon his
head: we have sworn to spare none of them; we'll root out the very
nation of them from the earth;" and thus he ran on, out of breath,
too, with action, and would not give us leave to speak a word. At
last, raising my voice that I might silence him a little,
"Barbarous dog!" said I, "what are you doing! I won't have one
creature touched more, upon pain of death; I charge you, upon your
life, to stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead
man this minute."&mdash;"Why, sir," says he, "do you know what you
do, or what they have done? If you want a reason for what we have
done, come hither;" and with that he showed me the poor fellow
hanging, with his throat cut.</p>

<p>I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time would
have been forward enough; but I thought they had carried their rage
too far, and remembered Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi:
"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it
was cruel." But I had now a new task upon my hands; for when the
men I had carried with me saw the sight, as I had done, I had as
much to do to restrain them as I should have had with the others;
nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, and told me, in their
hearing, that he was only concerned for fear of the men being
overpowered; and as to the people, he thought not one of them ought
to live; for they had all glutted themselves with the murder of the
poor man, and that they ought to be used like murderers. Upon these
words, away ran eight of my men, with the boatswain and his crew,
to complete their bloody work; and I, seeing it quite out of my
power to restrain them, came away pensive and sad; for I could not
bear the sight, much less the horrible noise and cries of the poor
wretches that fell into their hands.</p>

<p>I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and two
men, and with these walked back to the boat. It was a very great
piece of folly in me, I confess, to venture back, as it were,
alone; for as it began now to be almost day, and the alarm had run
over the country, there stood about forty men armed with lances and
boughs at the little place where the twelve or thirteen houses
stood, mentioned before: but by accident I missed the place, and
came directly to the seaside, and by the time I got to the seaside
it was broad day: immediately I took the pinnace and went on board,
and sent her back to assist the men in what might happen. I
observed, about the time that I came to the boat-side, that the
fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated; but in about
half-an-hour after I got on board, I heard a volley of our men's
firearms, and saw a great smoke. This, as I understood afterwards,
was our men falling upon the men, who, as I said, stood at the few
houses on the way, of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and
set all the houses on fire, but did not meddle with the women or
children.</p>

<p>By the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace our
men began to appear; they came dropping in, not in two bodies as
they went, but straggling here and there in such a manner, that a
small force of resolute men might have cut them all off. But the
dread of them was upon the whole country; and the men were
surprised, and so frightened, that I believe a hundred of them
would have fled at the sight of but five of our men. Nor in all
this terrible action was there a man that made any considerable
defence: they were so surprised between the terror of the fire and
the sudden attack of our men in the dark, that they knew not which
way to turn themselves; for if they fled one way they were met by
one party, if back again by another, so that they were everywhere
knocked down; nor did any of our men receive the least hurt, except
one that sprained his foot, and another that had one of his hands
burned.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X&mdash;HE IS LEFT ON SHORE</h3>

<p>I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and indeed with
all the men, but with him in particular, as well for his acting so
out of his duty as a commander of the ship, and having the charge
of the voyage upon him, as in his prompting, rather than cooling,
the rage of his blind men in so bloody and cruel an enterprise. My
nephew answered me very respectfully, but told me that when he saw
the body of the poor seaman whom they had murdered in so cruel and
barbarous a manner, he was not master of himself, neither could he
govern his passion; he owned he should not have done so, as he was
commander of the ship; but as he was a man, and nature moved him,
he could not bear it. As for the rest of the men, they were not
subject to me at all, and they knew it well enough; so they took no
notice of my dislike. The next day we set sail, so we never heard
any more of it. Our men differed in the account of the number they
had killed; but according to the best of their accounts, put all
together, they killed or destroyed about one hundred and fifty
people, men, women, and children, and left not a house standing in
the town. As for the poor fellow Tom Jeffry, as he was quite dead
(for his throat was so cut that his head was half off), it would do
him no service to bring him away; so they only took him down from
the tree, where he was hanging by one hand.</p>

<p>However just our men thought this action, I was against them in
it, and I always, after that time, told them God would blast the
voyage; for I looked upon all the blood they shed that night to be
murder in them. For though it is true that they had killed Tom
Jeffry, yet Jeffry was the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had
ill-used a young woman of theirs, who came down to them innocently,
and on the faith of the public capitulation.</p>

<p>The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were afterwards on
board. He said it was true that we seemed to break the truce, but
really had not; and that the war was begun the night before by the
natives themselves, who had shot at us, and killed one of our men
without any just provocation; so that as we were in a capacity to
fight them now, we might also be in a capacity to do ourselves
justice upon them in an extraordinary manner; that though the poor
man had taken a little liberty with the girl, he ought not to have
been murdered, and that in such a villainous manner: and that they
did nothing but what was just and what the laws of God allowed to
be done to murderers. One would think this should have been enough
to have warned us against going on shore amongst the heathens and
barbarians; but it is impossible to make mankind wise but at their
own expense, and their experience seems to be always of most use to
them when it is dearest bought.</p>

<p>We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from thence to the
coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surat; but the chief of the
supercargo's design lay at the Bay of Bengal, where, if he missed
his business outward-bound, he was to go out to China, and return
to the coast as he came home. The first disaster that befell us was
in the Gulf of Persia, where five of our men, venturing on shore on
the Arabian side of the gulf, were surrounded by the Arabians, and
either all killed or carried away into slavery; the rest of the
boat's crew were not able to rescue them, and had but just time to
get off their boat. I began to upbraid them with the just
retribution of Heaven in this case; but the boatswain very warmly
told me, he thought I went further in my censures than I could show
any warrant for in Scripture; and referred to Luke xiii. 4, where
our Saviour intimates that those men on whom the Tower of Siloam
fell were not sinners above all the Galileans; but that which put
me to silence in the case was, that not one of these five men who
were now lost were of those who went on shore to the massacre of
Madagascar, so I always called it, though our men could not bear to
hear the word <i>massacre</i> with any patience.</p>

<p>But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had worse
consequences than I expected; and the boatswain, who had been the
head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me he
found that I brought that affair continually upon the stage; that I
made unjust reflections upon it, and had used the men very ill on
that account, and himself in particular; that as I was but a
passenger, and had no command in the ship, or concern in the
voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; that they did not know
but I might have some ill-design in my head, and perhaps to call
them to an account for it when they came to England; and that,
therefore, unless I would resolve to have done with it, and also
not to concern myself any further with him, or any of his affairs,
he would leave the ship; for he did not think it safe to sail with
me among them.</p>

<p>I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told him
that I confessed I had all along opposed the massacre of
Madagascar, and that I had, on all occasions, spoken my mind freely
about it, though not more upon him than any of the rest; that as to
having no command in the ship, that was true; nor did I exercise
any authority, only took the liberty of speaking my mind in things
which publicly concerned us all; and what concern I had in the
voyage was none of his business; that I was a considerable owner in
the ship. In that claim I conceived I had a right to speak even
further than I had done, and would not be accountable to him or any
one else, and began to be a little warm with him. He made but
little reply to me at that time, and I thought the affair had been
over. We were at this time in the road at Bengal; and being willing
to see the place, I went on shore with the supercargo in the ship's
boat to divert myself; and towards evening was preparing to go on
board, when one of the men came to me, and told me he would not
have me trouble myself to come down to the boat, for they had
orders not to carry me on board any more. Any one may guess what a
surprise I was in at so insolent a message; and I asked the man who
bade him deliver that message to me? He told me the coxswain.</p>

<p>I immediately found out the supercargo, and told him the story,
adding that I foresaw there would be a mutiny in the ship; and
entreated him to go immediately on board and acquaint the captain
of it. But I might have spared this intelligence, for before I had
spoken to him on shore the matter was effected on board. The
boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and all the inferior
officers, as soon as I was gone off in the boat, came up, and
desired to speak with the captain; and then the boatswain, making a
long harangue, and repeating all he had said to me, told the
captain that as I was now gone peaceably on shore, they were loath
to use any violence with me, which, if I had not gone on shore,
they would otherwise have done, to oblige me to have gone. They
therefore thought fit to tell him that as they shipped themselves
to serve in the ship under his command, they would perform it well
and faithfully; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain
oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no
further with him; and at that word <i>all</i> he turned his face
towards the main-mast, which was, it seems, a signal agreed on,
when the seamen, being got together there, cried out, "<i>One and
all</i>! <i>one and all</i>!"</p>

<p>My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great
presence of mind; and though he was surprised, yet he told them
calmly that he would consider of the matter, but that he could do
nothing in it till he had spoken to me about it. He used some
arguments with them, to show them the unreasonableness and
injustice of the thing, but it was all in vain; they swore, and
shook hands round before his face, that they would all go on shore
unless he would engage to them not to suffer me to come any more on
board the ship.</p>

<p>This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation to me,
and did not know how I might take it. So he began to talk smartly
to them; told them that I was a very considerable owner of the
ship, and that if ever they came to England again it would cost
them very dear; that the ship was mine, and that he could not put
me out of it; and that he would rather lose the ship, and the
voyage too, than disoblige me so much: so they might do as they
pleased. However, he would go on shore and talk with me, and
invited the boatswain to go with him, and perhaps they might
accommodate the matter with me. But they all rejected the proposal,
and said they would have nothing to do with me any more; and if I
came on board they would all go on shore. "Well," said the captain,
"if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore and talk with
him." So away he came to me with this account, a little after the
message had been brought to me from the coxswain.</p>

<p>I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess; for I was not
without apprehensions that they would confine him by violence, set
sail, and run away with the ship; and then I had been stripped
naked in a remote country, having nothing to help myself; in short,
I had been in a worse case than when I was alone in the island. But
they had not come to that length, it seems, to my satisfaction; and
when my nephew told me what they had said to him, and how they had
sworn and shook hands that they would, one and all, leave the ship
if I was suffered to come on board, I told him he should not be
concerned at it at all, for I would stay on shore. I only desired
he would take care and send me all my necessary things on shore,
and leave me a sufficient sum of money, and I would find my way to
England as well as I could. This was a heavy piece of news to my
nephew, but there was no way to help it but to comply; so, in
short, he went on board the ship again, and satisfied the men that
his uncle had yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his
goods from on board the ship; so that the matter was over in a few
hours, the men returned to their duty, and I began to consider what
course I should steer.</p>

<p>I was now alone in a most remote part of the world, for I was
near three thousand leagues by sea farther off from England than I
was at my island; only, it is true, I might travel here by land
over the Great Mogul's country to Surat, might go from thence to
Bassora by sea, up the Gulf of Persia, and take the way of the
caravans, over the desert of Arabia, to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from
thence by sea again to Italy, and so overland into France. I had
another way before me, which was to wait for some English ships,
which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on the island of Sumatra,
and get passage on board them from England. But as I came hither
without any concern with the East Indian Company, so it would be
difficult to go from hence without their licence, unless with great
favour of the captains of the ships, or the company's factors: and
to both I was an utter stranger.</p>

<p>Here I had the mortification to see the ship set sail without
me; however, my nephew left me two servants, or rather one
companion and one servant; the first was clerk to the purser, whom
he engaged to go with me, and the other was his own servant. I then
took a good lodging in the house of an Englishwoman, where several
merchants lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and
one Englishman. Here I stayed above nine months, considering what
course to take. I had some English goods with me of value, and a
considerable sum of money; my nephew furnishing me with a thousand
pieces of eight, and a letter of credit for more if I had occasion,
that I might not be straitened, whatever might happen. I quickly
disposed of my goods to advantage; and, as I originally intended, I
bought here some very good diamonds, which, of all other things,
were the most proper for me in my present circumstances, because I
could always carry my whole estate about me.</p>

<p>During my stay here many proposals were made for my return to
England, but none falling out to my mind, the English merchant who
lodged with me, and whom I had contracted an intimate acquaintance
with, came to me one morning, saying: "Countryman, I have a project
to communicate, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught
I know, suit with yours also, when you shall have thoroughly
considered it. Here we are posted, you by accident and I by my own
choice, in a part of the world very remote from our own country;
but it is in a country where, by us who understand trade and
business, a great deal of money is to be got. If you will put one
thousand pounds to my one thousand pounds, we will hire a ship
here, the first we can get to our minds. You shall be captain, I'll
be merchant, and we'll go a trading voyage to China; for what
should we stand still for? The whole world is in motion; why should
we be idle?"</p>

<p>I liked this proposal very well; and the more so because it
seemed to be expressed with so much goodwill. In my loose, unhinged
circumstances, I was the fitter to embrace a proposal for trade, or
indeed anything else. I might perhaps say with some truth, that if
trade was not my element, rambling was; and no proposal for seeing
any part of the world which I had never seen before could possibly
come amiss to me. It was, however, some time before we could get a
ship to our minds, and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to
get English sailors&mdash;that is to say, so many as were necessary
to govern the voyage and manage the sailors which we should pick up
there. After some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner,
English; a Dutch carpenter, and three foremast men. With these we
found we could do well enough, having Indian seamen, such as they
were, to make up.</p>

<p>When all was ready we set sail for Achin, in the island of
Sumatra, and from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our
wares for opium and some arrack; the first a commodity which bears
a great price among the Chinese, and which at that time was much
wanted there. Then we went up to Saskan, were eight months out, and
on our return to Bengal I was very well satisfied with my
adventure. Our people in England often admire how officers, which
the company send into India, and the merchants which generally stay
there, get such very great estates as they do, and sometimes come
home worth sixty or seventy thousand pounds at a time; but it is
little matter for wonder, when we consider the innumerable ports
and places where they have a free commerce; indeed, at the ports
where the English ships come there is such great and constant
demands for the growth of all other countries, that there is a
certain vent for the returns, as well as a market abroad for the
goods carried out.</p>

<p>I got so much money by my first adventure, and such an insight
into the method of getting more, that had I been twenty years
younger, I should have been tempted to have stayed here, and sought
no farther for making my fortune; but what was all this to a man
upwards of threescore, that was rich enough, and came abroad more
in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world than a
covetous desire of gaining by it? A restless desire it really was,
for when I was at home I was restless to go abroad; and when I was
abroad I was restless to be at home. I say, what was this gain to
me? I was rich enough already, nor had I any uneasy desires about
getting more money; therefore the profit of the voyage to me was of
no great force for the prompting me forward to further
undertakings. Hence, I thought that by this voyage I had made no
progress at all, because I was come back, as I might call it, to
the place from whence I came, as to a home: whereas, my eye, like
that which Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied with seeing. I
was come into a part of the world which I was never in before, and
that part, in particular, which I heard much of, and was resolved
to see as much of it as I could: and then I thought I might say I
had seen all the world that was worth seeing.</p>

<p>But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions: I
acknowledge his were the more suited to the end of a merchant's
life: who, when he is abroad upon adventures, is wise to stick to
that, as the best thing for him, which he is likely to get the most
money by. On the other hand, mine was the notion of a mad, rambling
boy, that never cares to see a thing twice over. But this was not
all: I had a kind of impatience upon me to be nearer home, and yet
an unsettled resolution which way to go. In the interval of these
consultations, my friend, who was always upon the search for
business, proposed another voyage among the Spice Islands, to bring
home a loading of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts.</p>

<p>We were not long in preparing for this voyage; the chief
difficulty was in bringing me to come into it. However, at last,
nothing else offering, and as sitting still, to me especially, was
the unhappiest part of life, I resolved on this voyage too, which
we made very successfully, touching at Borneo and several other
islands, and came home in about five months, when we sold our
spices, with very great profit, to the Persian merchants, who
carried them away to the Gulf. My friend, when we made up this
account, smiled at me: "Well, now," said he, with a sort of
friendly rebuke on my indolent temper, "is not this better than
walking about here, like a man with nothing to do, and spending our
time in staring at the nonsense and ignorance of the
Pagans?"&mdash;"Why, truly," said I, "my friend, I think it is, and
I begin to be a convert to the principles of merchandising; but I
must tell you, by the way, you do not know what I am doing; for if
I once conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily, old as I am, I
shall harass you up and down the world till I tire you; for I shall
pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you lie still."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI&mdash;WARNED OF DANGER BY A COUNTRYMAN</h3>

<p>A little while after this there came in a Dutch ship from
Batavia; she was a coaster, not an European trader, of about two
hundred tons burden; the men, as they pretended, having been so
sickly that the captain had not hands enough to go to sea with, so
he lay by at Bengal; and having, it seems, got money enough, or
being willing, for other reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public
notice he would sell his ship. This came to my ears before my new
partner heard of it, and I had a great mind to buy it; so I went to
him and told him of it. He considered a while, for he was no rash
man neither; and at last replied, "She is a little too
big&mdash;however, we will have her." Accordingly, we bought the
ship, and agreeing with the master, we paid for her, and took
possession. When we had done so we resolved to engage the men, if
we could, to join with those we had, for the pursuing our business;
but, on a sudden, they having received not their wages, but their
share of the money, as we afterwards learned, not one of them was
to be found; we inquired much about them, and at length were told
that they were all gone together by land to Agra, the great city of
the Mogul's residence, to proceed from thence to Surat, and then go
by sea to the Gulf of Persia.</p>

<p>Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that I should
miss the opportunity of going with them; for such a ramble, I
thought, and in such company as would both have guarded and
diverted me, would have suited mightily with my great design; and I
should have both seen the world and gone homeward too. But I was
much better satisfied a few days after, when I came to know what
sort of fellows they were; for, in short, their history was, that
this man they called captain was the gunner only, not the
commander; that they had been a trading voyage, in which they had
been attacked on shore by some of the Malays, who had killed the
captain and three of his men; and that after the captain was
killed, these men, eleven in number, having resolved to run away
with the ship, brought her to Bengal, leaving the mate and five men
more on shore.</p>

<p>Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came honestly by
her, as we thought, though we did not, I confess, examine into
things so exactly as we ought; for we never inquired anything of
the seamen, who would certainly have faltered in their account, and
contradicted one another. Somehow or other we should have had
reason to have suspected, them; but the man showed us a bill of
sale for the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such name,
for I suppose it was all a forgery, and called himself by that
name, and we could not contradict him: and withal, having no
suspicion of the thing, we went through with our bargain. We picked
up some more English sailors here after this, and some Dutch, and
now we resolved on a second voyage to the south-east for cloves,
&amp;c.&mdash;that is to say, among the Philippine and Malacca
isles. In short, not to fill up this part of my story with trifles
when what is to come is so remarkable, I spent, from first to last,
six years in this country, trading from port to port, backward and
forward, and with very good success, and was now the last year with
my new partner, going in the ship above mentioned, on a voyage to
China, but designing first to go to Siam to buy rice.</p>

<p>In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up and
down a great while in the Straits of Malacca and among the islands,
we were no sooner got clear of those difficult seas than we found
our ship had sprung a leak, but could not discover where it was.
This forced us to make some port; and my partner, who knew the
country better than I did, directed the captain to put into the
river of Cambodia; for I had made the English mate, one Mr.
Thompson, captain, not being willing to take the charge of the ship
upon myself. This river lies on the north side of the great bay or
gulf which goes up to Siam. While we were here, and going often on
shore for refreshment, there comes to me one day an Englishman, a
gunner's mate on board an English East India ship, then riding in
the same river. "Sir," says he, addressing me, "you are a stranger
to me, and I to you; but I have something to tell you that very
nearly concerns you. I am moved by the imminent danger you are in,
and, for aught I see, you have no knowledge of it."&mdash;"I know
no danger I am in," said I, "but that my ship is leaky, and I
cannot find it out; but I intend to lay her aground to-morrow, to
see if I can find it."&mdash;"But, sir," says he, "leaky or not
leaky, you will be wiser than to lay your ship on shore to-morrow
when you hear what I have to say to you. Do you know, sir," said
he, "the town of Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up the river;
and there are two large English ships about five leagues on this
side, and three Dutch?"&mdash;"Well," said I, "and what is that to
me?"&mdash;"Why, sir," said be, "is it for a man that is upon such
adventures as you are to come into a port, and not examine first
what ships there are there, and whether he is able to deal with
them? I suppose you do not think you are a match for them?" I could
not conceive what he meant; and I turned short upon him, and said:
"I wish you would explain yourself; I cannot imagine what reason I
have to be afraid of any of the company's ships, or Dutch ships. I
am no interloper. What can they have to say to me?"&mdash;"Well,
sir," says he, with a smile, "if you think yourself secure you must
take your chance; but take my advice, if you do not put to sea
immediately, you will the very next tide be attacked by five
longboats full of men, and perhaps if you are taken you will be
hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be examined afterwards. I
thought, sir," added he, "I should have met with a better reception
than this for doing you a piece of service of such
importance."&mdash;"I can never be ungrateful," said I, "for any
service, or to any man that offers me any kindness; but it is past
my comprehension what they should have such a design upon me for:
however, since you say there is no time to be lost, and that there
is some villainous design on hand against me, I will go on board
this minute, and put to sea immediately, if my men can stop the
leak; but, sir," said I, "shall I go away ignorant of the cause of
all this? Can you give me no further light into it?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you but part of the story, sir," says he; "but I
have a Dutch seaman here with me, and I believe I could persuade
him to tell you the rest; but there is scarce time for it. But the
short of the story is this&mdash;the first part of which I suppose
you know well enough&mdash;that you were with this ship at Sumatra;
that there your captain was murdered by the Malays, with three of
his men; and that you, or some of those that were on board with
you, ran away with the ship, and are since turned pirates. This is
the sum of the story, and you will all be seized as pirates, I can
assure you, and executed with very little ceremony; for you know
merchant ships show but little law to pirates if they get them into
their power."&mdash;"Now you speak plain English," said I, "and I
thank you; and though I know nothing that we have done like what
you talk of, for I am sure we came honestly and fairly by the ship;
yet seeing such a work is doing, as you say, and that you seem to
mean honestly, I will be upon my guard."&mdash;"Nay, sir," says he,
"do not talk of being upon your guard; the best defence is to be
out of danger. If you have any regard for your life and the lives
of all your men, put to sea without fail at high-water; and as you
have a whole tide before you, you will be gone too far out before
they can come down; for they will come away at high-water, and as
they have twenty miles to come, you will get near two hours of them
by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the length of the way:
besides, as they are only boats, and not ships, they will not
venture to follow you far out to sea, especially if it
blows."&mdash;"Well," said I, "you have been very kind in this:
what shall I do to make you amends?"&mdash;"Sir," says he, "you may
not be willing to make me any amends, because you may not be
convinced of the truth of it. I will make an offer to you: I have
nineteen months' pay due to me on board the ship &mdash;&mdash;,
which I came out of England in; and the Dutchman that is with me
has seven months' pay due to him. If you will make good our pay to
us we will go along with you; if you find nothing more in it we
will desire no more; but if we do convince you that we have saved
your lives, and the ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we
will leave the rest to you."</p>

<p>I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board, and
the two men with me. As soon as I came to the ship's side, my
partner, who was on board, came out on the quarter-deck, and called
to me, with a great deal of joy, "We have stopped the leak&mdash;we
have stopped the leak!"&mdash;"Say you so?" said I; "thank God; but
weigh anchor, then, immediately."&mdash;"Weigh!" says he; "what do
you mean by that? What is the matter?"&mdash;"Ask no questions,"
said I; "but set all hands to work, and weigh without losing a
minute." He was surprised; however, he called the captain, and he
immediately ordered the anchor to be got up; and though the tide
was not quite down, yet a little land-breeze blowing, we stood out
to sea. Then I called him into the cabin, and told him the story;
and we called in the men, and they told us the rest of it; but as
it took up a great deal of time, before we had done a seaman comes
to the cabin door, and called out to us that the captain bade him
tell us we were chased by five sloops, or boats, full of men. "Very
well," said I, "then it is apparent there is something in it." I
then ordered all our men to be called up, and told them there was a
design to seize the ship, and take us for pirates, and asked them
if they would stand by us, and by one another; the men answered
cheerfully, one and all, that they would live and die with us. Then
I asked the captain what way he thought best for us to manage a
fight with them; for resist them I was resolved we would, and that
to the last drop. He said readily, that the way was to keep them
off with our great shot as long as we could, and then to use our
small arms, to keep them from boarding us; but when neither of
these would do any longer, we would retire to our close quarters,
for perhaps they had not materials to break open our bulkheads, or
get in upon us.</p>

<p>The gunner had in the meantime orders to bring two guns, to bear
fore and aft, out of the steerage, to clear the deck, and load them
with musket-bullets, and small pieces of old iron, and what came
next to hand. Thus we made ready for fight; but all this while we
kept out to sea, with wind enough, and could see the boats at a
distance, being five large longboats, following us with all the
sail they could make.</p>

<p>Two of those boats (which by our glasses we could see were
English) outsailed the rest, were near two leagues ahead of them,
and gained upon us considerably, so that we found they would come
up with us; upon which we fired a gun without ball, to intimate
that they should bring to: and we put out a flag of truce, as a
signal for parley: but they came crowding after us till within
shot, when we took in our white flag, they having made no answer to
it, and hung out a red flag, and fired at them with a shot.
Notwithstanding this, they came on till they were near enough to
call to them with a speaking-trumpet, bidding them keep off at
their peril.</p>

<p>It was all one; they crowded after us, and endeavoured to come
under our stern, so as to board us on our quarter; upon which,
seeing they were resolute for mischief, and depended upon the
strength that followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so
that they lay upon our broadside; when immediately we fired five
guns at them, one of which had been levelled so true as to carry
away the stern of the hindermost boat, and we then forced them to
take down their sail, and to run all to the head of the boat, to
keep her from sinking; so she lay by, and had enough of it; but
seeing the foremost boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire
at her in particular. While this was doing one of the three boats
that followed made up to the boat which we had disabled, to relieve
her, and we could see her take out the men. We then called again to
the foremost boat, and offered a truce, to parley again, and to
know what her business was with us; but had no answer, only she
crowded close under our stern. Upon this, our gunner who was a very
dexterous fellow ran out his two case-guns, and fired again at her,
but the shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved their
caps, and came on. The gunner, getting quickly ready again, fired
among them a second time, one shot of which, though it missed the
boat itself, yet fell in among the men, and we could easily see did
a great deal of mischief among them. We now wore the ship again,
and brought our quarter to bear upon them, and firing three guns
more, we found the boat was almost split to pieces; in particular,
her rudder and a piece of her stern were shot quite away; so they
handed her sail immediately, and were in great disorder. To
complete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them
again; where he hit them we could not tell, but we found the boat
was sinking, and some of the men already in the water: upon this, I
immediately manned out our pinnace, with orders to pick up some of
the men if they could, and save them from drowning, and immediately
come on board ship with them, because we saw the rest of the boats
began to come up. Our men in the pinnace followed their orders, and
took up three men, one of whom was just drowning, and it was a good
while before we could recover him. As soon as they were on board we
crowded all the sail we could make, and stood farther out to the
sea; and we found that when the other boats came up to the first,
they gave over their chase.</p>

<p>Being thus delivered from a danger which, though I knew not the
reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I apprehended, I
resolved that we should change our course, and not let any one know
whither we were going; so we stood out to sea eastward, quite out
of the course of all European ships, whether they were bound to
China or anywhere else, within the commerce of the European
nations. When we were at sea we began to consult with the two
seamen, and inquire what the meaning of all this should be; and the
Dutchman confirmed the gunner's story about the false sale of the
ship and of the murder of the captain, and also how that he, this
Dutchman, and four more got into the woods, where they wandered
about a great while, till at length he made his escape, and swam
off to a Dutch ship, which was sailing near the shore in its way
from China.</p>

<p>He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen
belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest in their
travels, and gave an account that the fellow who had run away with
the ship, sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, who were gone
a-cruising in her, and that they had already taken an English ship
and two Dutch ships very richly laden. This latter part we found to
concern us directly, though we knew it to be false; yet, as my
partner said, very justly, if we had fallen into their hands, and
they had had such a prepossession against us beforehand, it had
been in vain for us to have defended ourselves, or to hope for any
good quarter at their hands; especially considering that our
accusers had been our judges, and that we could have expected
nothing from them but what rage would have dictated, and an
ungoverned passion have executed. Therefore it was his opinion we
should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we came, without
putting in at any port whatever&mdash;because where we could give a
good account of ourselves, could prove where we were when the ship
put in, of whom we bought her, and the like; and what was more than
all the rest, if we were put upon the necessity of bringing it
before the proper judges, we should be sure to have some justice,
and not to be hanged first and judged afterwards.</p>

<p>I was some time of my partner's opinion; but after a little more
serious thinking, I told him I thought it was a very great hazard
for us to attempt returning to Bengal, for that we were on the
wrong side of the Straits of Malacca, and that if the alarm was
given, we should be sure to be waylaid on every side&mdash;that if
we should be taken, as it were, running away, we should even
condemn ourselves, and there would want no more evidence to destroy
us. I also asked the English sailor's opinion, who said he was of
my mind, and that we certainly should be taken. This danger a
little startled my partner and all the ship's company, and we
immediately resolved to go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on
to the coast of China&mdash;and pursuing the first design as to
trade, find some way or other to dispose of the ship, and come back
in some of the vessels of the country such as we could get. This
was approved of as the best method for our security, and
accordingly we steered away NNE., keeping above fifty leagues off
from the usual course to the eastward. This, however, put us to
some inconvenience: for, first, the winds, when we came that
distance from the shore, seemed to be more steadily against us,
blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the E. and ENE., so that
we were a long while upon our voyage, and we were but ill provided
with victuals for so long a run; and what was still worse, there
was some danger that those English and Dutch ships whose boats
pursued us, whereof some were bound that way, might have got in
before us, and if not, some other ship bound to China might have
information of us from them, and pursue us with the same
vigour.</p>

<p>I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought myself,
including the late escape from the longboats, to have been in the
most dangerous condition that ever I was in through my past life;
for whatever ill circumstances I had been in, I was never pursued
for a thief before; nor had I ever done anything that merited the
name of dishonest or fraudulent, much less thievish. I had chiefly
been my own enemy, or, as I may rightly say, I had been nobody's
enemy but my own; but now I was woefully embarrassed: for though I
was perfectly innocent, I was in no condition to make that
innocence appear; and if I had been taken, it had been under a
supposed guilt of the worst kind. This made me very anxious to make
an escape, though which way to do it I knew not, or what port or
place we could go to. My partner endeavoured to encourage me by
describing the several ports of that coast, and told me he would
put in on the coast of Cochin China, or the bay of Tonquin,
intending afterwards to go to Macao, where a great many European
families resided, and particularly the missionary priests, who
usually went thither in order to their going forward to China.</p>

<p>Hither then we resolved to go; and, accordingly, though after a
tedious course, and very much straitened for provisions, we came
within sight of the coast very early in the morning; and upon
reflection on the past circumstances of danger we were in, we
resolved to put into a small river, which, however, had depth
enough of water for us, and to see if we could, either overland or
by the ship's pinnace, come to know what ships were in any port
thereabouts. This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance: for
though we did not immediately see any European ships in the bay of
Tonquin, yet the next morning there came into the bay two Dutch
ships; and a third without any colours spread out, but which we
believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two leagues'
distance, steering for the coast of China; and in the afternoon
went by two English ships steering the same course; and thus we
thought we saw ourselves beset with enemies both one way and the
other. The place we were in was wild and barbarous, the people
thieves by occupation; and though it is true we had not much to
seek of them, and, except getting a few provisions, cared not how
little we had to do with them, yet it was with much difficulty that
we kept ourselves from being insulted by them several ways. We were
in a small river of this country, within a few leagues of its
utmost limits northward; and by our boat we coasted north-east to
the point of land which opens the great bay of Tonquin; and it was
in this beating up along the shore that we discovered we were
surrounded with enemies. The people we were among were the most
barbarous of all the inhabitants of the coast; and among other
customs they have this one: that if any vessel has the misfortune
to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they make the men all prisoners
or slaves; and it was not long before we found a spice of their
kindness this way, on the occasion following.</p>

<p>I have observed above that our ship sprung a leak at sea, and
that we could not find it out; and it happened that, as I have
said, it was stopped unexpectedly, on the eve of our being pursued
by the Dutch and English ships in the bay of Siam; yet, as we did
not find the ship so perfectly tight and sound as we desired, we
resolved while we were at this place to lay her on shore, and clean
her bottom, and, if possible, to find out where the leaks were.
Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought all our guns
and other movables to one side, we tried to bring her down, that we
might come at her bottom; but, on second thoughts, we did not care
to lay her on dry ground, neither could we find out a proper place
for it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE CARPENTER'S WHIMSICAL CONTRIVANCE</h3>

<p>The inhabitants came wondering down the shore to look at us; and
seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a manner, and heeling
in towards the shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work on
her bottom with stages, and with their boats on the off-side, they
presently concluded that the ship was cast away, and lay fast on
the ground. On this supposition they came about us in two or three
hours' time with ten or twelve large boats, having some of them
eight, some ten men in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on
board and plundered the ship, and if they found us there, to have
carried us away for slaves.</p>

<p>When they came up to the ship, and began to row round her, they
discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the ship's bottom
and side, washing, and graving, and stopping, as every seafaring
man knows how. They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who
were a little surprised, could not imagine what their design was;
but being willing to be sure, we took this opportunity to get some
of us into the ship, and others to hand down arms and ammunition to
those that were at work, to defend themselves with if there should
be occasion. And it was no more than need: for in less than a
quarter of an hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the
ship was really a wreck, and that we were all at work endeavouring
to save her, or to save our lives by the help of our boats; and
when we handed our arms into the boat, they concluded, by that act,
that we were endeavouring to save some of our goods. Upon this,
they took it for granted we all belonged to them, and away they
came directly upon our men, as if it had been in a
line-of-battle.</p>

<p>Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened, for we
lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to know
what they should do. I immediately called to the men that worked
upon the stages to slip them down, and get up the side into the
ship, and bade those in the boat to row round and come on board.
The few who were on board worked with all the strength and hands we
had to bring the ship to rights; however, neither the men upon the
stages nor those in the boats could do as they were ordered before
the Cochin Chinese were upon them, when two of their boats boarded
our longboat, and began to lay hold of the men as their
prisoners.</p>

<p>The first man they laid hold of was an English seaman, a stout,
strong fellow, who having a musket in his hand, never offered to
fire it, but laid it down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought;
but he understood his business better than I could teach him, for
he grappled the Pagan, and dragged him by main force out of their
boat into ours, where, taking him by the ears, he beat his head so
against the boat's gunnel that the fellow died in his hands. In the
meantime, a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the musket, and with
the butt-end of it so laid about him, that he knocked down five of
them who attempted to enter the boat. But this was doing little
towards resisting thirty or forty men, who, fearless because
ignorant of their danger, began to throw themselves into the
longboat, where we had but five men in all to defend it; but the
following accident, which deserved our laughter, gave our men a
complete victory.</p>

<p>Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the ship,
as well as to pay the seams where he had caulked her to stop the
leaks, had got two kettles just let down into the boat, one filled
with boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and oil, and
such stuff as the shipwrights use for that work; and the man that
attended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand, with
which he supplied the men that were at work with the hot stuff. Two
of the enemy's men entered the boat just where this fellow stood in
the foresheets; he immediately saluted them with a ladle full of
the stuff, boiling hot which so burned and scalded them, being
half-naked that they roared out like bulls, and, enraged with the
fire, leaped both into the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried
out, "Well done, Jack! give them some more of it!" and stepping
forward himself, takes one of the mops, and dipping it in the
pitch-pot, he and his man threw it among them so plentifully that,
in short, of all the men in the three boats, there was not one that
escaped being scalded in a most frightful manner, and made such a
howling and crying that I never heard a worse noise.</p>

<p>I was never better pleased with a victory in my life; not only
as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger was
imminent before, but as we got this victory without any bloodshed,
except of that man the seaman killed with his naked hands, and
which I was very much concerned at. Although it maybe a just thing,
because necessary (for there is no necessary wickedness in nature),
yet I thought it was a sad sort of life, when we must be always
obliged to be killing our fellow-creatures to preserve ourselves;
and, indeed, I think so still; and I would even now suffer a great
deal rather than I would take away the life even of the worst
person injuring me; and I believe all considering people, who know
the value of life, would be of my opinion, if they entered
seriously into the consideration of it.</p>

<p>All the while this was doing, my partner and I, who managed the
rest of the men on board, had with great dexterity brought the ship
almost to rights, and having got the guns into their places again,
the gunner called to me to bid our boat get out of the way, for he
would let fly among them. I called back again to him, and bid him
not offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the work without him;
but bid him heat another pitch-kettle, which our cook, who was on
broad, took care of. However, the enemy was so terrified with what
they had met with in their first attack, that they would not come
on again; and some of them who were farthest off, seeing the ship
swim, as it were, upright, began, as we suppose, to see their
mistake, and gave over the enterprise, finding it was not as they
expected. Thus we got clear of this merry fight; and having got
some rice and some roots and bread, with about sixteen hogs, on
board two days before, we resolved to stay here no longer, but go
forward, whatever came of it; for we made no doubt but we should be
surrounded the next day with rogues enough, perhaps more than our
pitch-kettle would dispose of for us. We therefore got all our
things on board the same evening, and the next morning were ready
to sail: in the meantime, lying at anchor at some distance from the
shore, we were not so much concerned, being now in a fighting
posture, as well as in a sailing posture, if any enemy had
presented. The next day, having finished our work within board, and
finding our ship was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set
sail. We would have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to
inform ourselves of what was to be known concerning the Dutch ships
that had been there; but we durst not stand in there, because we
had seen several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little before;
so we kept on NE. towards the island of Formosa, as much afraid of
being seen by a Dutch or English merchant ship as a Dutch or
English merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine
man-of-war.</p>

<p>When we were thus got to sea, we kept on NE., as if we would go
to the Manillas or the Philippine Islands; and this we did that we
might not fall into the way of any of the European ships; and then
we steered north, till we came to the latitude of 22 degrees 30
seconds, by which means we made the island of Formosa directly,
where we came to an anchor, in order to get water and fresh
provisions, which the people there, who are very courteous in their
manners, supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly and
punctually with us in all their agreements and bargains. This is
what we did not find among other people, and may be owing to the
remains of Christianity which was once planted here by a Dutch
missionary of Protestants, and it is a testimony of what I have
often observed, viz. that the Christian religion always civilises
the people, and reforms their manners, where it is received,
whether it works saving effects upon them or no.</p>

<p>From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China at
an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all the ports of
China where our European ships usually come; being resolved, if
possible, not to fall into any of their hands, especially in this
country, where, as our circumstances were, we could not fail of
being entirely ruined. Being now come to the latitude of 30
degrees, we resolved to put into the first trading port we should
come at; and standing in for the shore, a boat came of two leagues
to us with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who, knowing us to be
an European ship, came to offer his service, which, indeed, we were
glad of and took him on board; upon which, without asking us
whither we would go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and sent it
back. I thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old
man carry us whither we would, that I began to talk to him about
carrying us to the Gulf of Nankin, which is the most northern part
of the coast of China. The old man said he knew the Gulf of Nankin
very well; but smiling, asked us what we would do there? I told him
we would sell our cargo and purchase China wares, calicoes, raw
silks, tea, wrought silks, &amp;c.; and so we would return by the
same course we came. He told us our best port would have been to
put in at Macao, where we could not have failed of a market for our
opium to our satisfaction, and might for our money have purchased
all sorts of China goods as cheap as we could at Nankin.</p>

<p>Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which he
was very opinionated or conceited, I told him we were gentlemen as
well as merchants, and that we had a mind to go and see the great
city of Pekin, and the famous court of the monarch of China. "Why,
then," says the old man, "you should go to Ningpo, where, by the
river which runs into the sea there, you may go up within five
leagues of the great canal. This canal is a navigable stream, which
goes through the heart of that vast empire of China, crosses all
the rivers, passes some considerable hills by the help of sluices
and gates, and goes up to the city of Pekin, being in length near
two hundred and seventy leagues."&mdash;"Well," said I, "Seignior
Portuguese, but that is not our business now; the great question
is, if you can carry us up to the city of Nankin, from whence we
can travel to Pekin afterwards?" He said he could do so very well,
and that there was a great Dutch ship gone up that way just before.
This gave me a little shock, for a Dutch ship was now our terror,
and we had much rather have met the devil, at least if he had not
come in too frightful a figure; and we depended upon it that a
Dutch ship would be our destruction, for we were in no condition to
fight them; all the ships they trade with into those parts being of
great burden, and of much greater force than we were.</p>

<p>The old man found me a little confused, and under some concern
when he named a Dutch ship, and said to me, "Sir, you need be under
no apprehensions of the Dutch; I suppose they are not now at war
with your nation?"&mdash;"No," said I, "that's true; but I know not
what liberties men may take when they are out of the reach of the
laws of their own country."&mdash;"Why," says he, "you are no
pirates; what need you fear? They will not meddle with peaceable
merchants, sure." These words put me into the greatest disorder and
confusion imaginable; nor was it possible for me to conceal it so,
but the old man easily perceived it.</p>

<p>"Sir," says he, "I find you are in some disorder in your
thoughts at my talk: pray be pleased to go which way you think fit,
and depend upon it, I'll do you all the service I can." Upon this
we fell into further discourse, in which, to my alarm and
amazement, he spoke of the villainous doings of a certain pirate
ship that had long been the talk of mariners in those seas; no
other, in a word, than the very ship he was now on board of, and
which we had so unluckily purchased. I presently saw there was no
help for it but to tell him the plain truth, and explain all the
danger and trouble we had suffered through this misadventure, and,
in particular, our earnest wish to be speedily quit of the ship
altogether; for which reason we had resolved to carry her up to
Nankin.</p>

<p>The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we were in
the right to go away to the north; and that, if he might advise us,
it should be to sell the ship in China, which we might well do, and
buy, or build another in the country; adding that I should meet
with customers enough for the ship at Nankin, that a Chinese junk
would serve me very well to go back again, and that he would
procure me people both to buy one and sell the other. "Well, but,
seignior," said I, "as you say they know the ship so well, I may,
perhaps, if I follow your measures, be instrumental to bring some
honest, innocent men into a terrible broil; for wherever they find
the ship they will prove the guilt upon the men, by proving this
was the ship."&mdash;"Why," says the old man, "I'll find out a way
to prevent that; for as I know all those commanders you speak of
very well, and shall see them all as they pass by, I will be sure
to set them to rights in the thing, and let them know that they had
been so much in the wrong; that though the people who were on board
at first might run away with the ship, yet it was not true that
they had turned pirates; and that, in particular, these were not
the men that first went off with the ship, but innocently bought
her for their trade; and I am persuaded they will so far believe me
as at least to act more cautiously for the time to come."</p>

<p>In about thirteen days' sail we came to an anchor, at the
south-west point of the great Gulf of Nankin; where I learned by
accident that two Dutch ships were gone the length before me, and
that I should certainly fall into their hands. I consulted my
partner again in this exigency, and he was as much at a loss as I
was. I then asked the old pilot if there was no creek or harbour
which I might put into and pursue my business with the Chinese
privately, and be in no danger of the enemy. He told me if I would
sail to the southward about forty-two leagues, there was a little
port called Quinchang, where the fathers of the mission usually
landed from Macao, on their progress to teach the Christian
religion to the Chinese, and where no European ships ever put in;
and if I thought to put in there, I might consider what further
course to take when I was on shore. He confessed, he said, it was
not a place for merchants, except that at some certain times they
had a kind of a fair there, when the merchants from Japan came over
thither to buy Chinese merchandises. The name of the port I may
perhaps spell wrong, having lost this, together with the names of
many other places set down in a little pocket-book, which was
spoiled by the water by an accident; but this I remember, that the
Chinese merchants we corresponded with called it by a different
name from that which our Portuguese pilot gave it, who pronounced
it Quinchang. As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this
place, we weighed the next day, having only gone twice on shore
where we were, to get fresh water; on both which occasions the
people of the country were very civil, and brought abundance of
provisions to sell to us; but nothing without money.</p>

<p>We did not come to the other port (the wind being contrary) for
five days; but it was very much to our satisfaction, and I was
thankful when I set my foot on shore, resolving, and my partner
too, that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and effects
any other way, though not profitably, we would never more set foot
on board that unhappy vessel. Indeed, I must acknowledge, that of
all the circumstances of life that ever I had any experience of,
nothing makes mankind so completely miserable as that of being in
constant fear. Well does the Scripture say, "The fear of man brings
a snare"; it is a life of death, and the mind is so entirely
oppressed by it, that it is capable of no relief.</p>

<p>Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, by
heightening every danger; representing the English and Dutch
captains to be men incapable of hearing reason, or of
distinguishing between honest men and rogues; or between a story
calculated for our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to
deceive, and a true, genuine account of our whole voyage, progress,
and design; for we might many ways have convinced any reasonable
creatures that we were not pirates; the goods we had on board, the
course we steered, our frankly showing ourselves, and entering into
such and such ports; and even our very manner, the force we had,
the number of men, the few arms, the little ammunition, short
provisions; all these would have served to convince any men that we
were no pirates. The opium and other goods we had on board would
make it appear the ship had been at Bengal. The Dutchmen, who, it
was said, had the names of all the men that were in the ship, might
easily see that we were a mixture of English, Portuguese, and
Indians, and but two Dutchmen on board. These, and many other
particular circumstances, might have made it evident to the
understanding of any commander, whose hands we might fall into,
that we were no pirates.</p>

<p>But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked another way, and
threw us into the vapours; it bewildered our understandings, and
set the imagination at work to form a thousand terrible things that
perhaps might never happen. We first supposed, as indeed everybody
had related to us, that the seamen on board the English and Dutch
ships, but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at the name of a
pirate, and especially at our beating off their boats and escaping,
that they would not give themselves leave to inquire whether we
were pirates or no, but would execute us off-hand, without giving
us any room for a defence. We reflected that there really was so
much apparent evidence before them, that they would scarce inquire
after any more; as, first, that the ship was certainly the same,
and that some of the seamen among them knew her, and had been on
board her; and, secondly, that when we had intelligence at the
river of Cambodia that they were coming down to examine us, we
fought their boats and fled. Therefore we made no doubt but they
were as fully satisfied of our being pirates as we were satisfied
of the contrary; and, as I often said, I know not but I should have
been apt to have taken those circumstances for evidence, if the
tables were turned, and my case was theirs; and have made no
scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces, without believing, or
perhaps considering, what they might have to offer in their
defence.</p>

<p>But let that be how it will, these were our apprehensions; and
both my partner and I scarce slept a night without dreaming of
halters and yard-arms; of fighting, and being taken; of killing,
and being killed: and one night I was in such a fury in my dream,
fancying the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I was knocking one of
their seamen down, that I struck my doubled fist against the side
of the cabin I lay in with such a force as wounded my hand
grievously, broke my knuckles, and cut and bruised the flesh, so
that it awaked me out of my sleep. Another apprehension I had was,
the cruel usage we might meet with from them if we fell into their
hands; then the story of Amboyna came into my head, and how the
Dutch might perhaps torture us, as they did our countrymen there,
and make some of our men, by extremity of torture, confess to
crimes they never were guilty of, or own themselves and all of us
to be pirates, and so they would put us to death with a formal
appearance of justice; and that they might be tempted to do this
for the gain of our ship and cargo, worth altogether four or five
thousand pounds. We did not consider that the captains of ships
have no authority to act thus; and if we had surrendered prisoners
to them, they could not answer the destroying us, or torturing us,
but would be accountable for it when they came to their country.
However, if they were to act thus with us, what advantage would it
be to us that they should be called to an account for it?&mdash;or
if we were first to be murdered, what satisfaction would it be to
us to have them punished when they came home?</p>

<p>I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections I now had
upon the vast variety of my particular circumstances; how hard I
thought it that I, who had spent forty years in a life of continual
difficulties, and was at last come, as it were, to the port or
haven which all men drive at, viz. to have rest and plenty, should
be a volunteer in new sorrows by my own unhappy choice, and that I,
who had escaped so many dangers in my youth, should now come to be
hanged in my old age, and in so remote a place, for a crime which I
was not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of. After these
thoughts something of religion would come in; and I would be
considering that this seemed to me to be a disposition of immediate
Providence, and I ought to look upon it and submit to it as such.
For, although I was innocent as to men, I was far from being
innocent as to my Maker; and I ought to look in and examine what
other crimes in my life were most obvious to me, and for which
Providence might justly inflict this punishment as a retribution;
and thus I ought to submit to this, just as I would to a shipwreck,
if it had pleased God to have brought such a disaster upon me.</p>

<p>In its turn natural courage would sometimes take its place, and
then I would be talking myself up to vigorous resolutions; that I
would not be taken to be barbarously used by a parcel of merciless
wretches in cold blood; that it were much better to have fallen
into the hands of the savages, though I were sure they would feast
upon me when they had taken me, than those who would perhaps glut
their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and barbarities; that in the
case of the savages, I always resolved to die fighting to the last
gasp, and why should I not do so now? Whenever these thoughts
prevailed, I was sure to put myself into a kind of fever with the
agitation of a supposed fight; my blood would boil, and my eyes
sparkle, as if I was engaged, and I always resolved to take no
quarter at their hands; but even at last, if I could resist no
longer, I would blow up the ship and all that was in her, and leave
them but little booty to boast of.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;ARRIVAL IN CHINA</h3>

<p>The greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of these
things were to our thoughts while we were at sea, the greater was
our satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore; and my partner
told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy load upon his back,
which he was to carry up a hill, and found that he was not able to
stand longer under it; but that the Portuguese pilot came and took
it off his back, and the hill disappeared, the ground before him
appearing all smooth and plain: and truly it was so; they were all
like men who had a load taken off their backs. For my part I had a
weight taken off from my heart that it was not able any longer to
bear; and as I said above we resolved to go no more to sea in that
ship. When we came on shore, the old pilot, who was now our friend,
got us a lodging, together with a warehouse for our goods; it was a
little hut, with a larger house adjoining to it, built and also
palisadoed round with canes, to keep out pilferers, of which there
were not a few in that country: however, the magistrates allowed us
a little guard, and we had a soldier with a kind of half-pike, who
stood sentinel at our door, to whom we allowed a pint of rice and a
piece of money about the value of three-pence per day, so that our
goods were kept very safe.</p>

<p>The fair or mart usually kept at this place had been over some
time; however, we found that there were three or four junks in the
river, and two ships from Japan, with goods which they had bought
in China, and were not gone away, having some Japanese merchants on
shore.</p>

<p>The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was to get
us acquainted with three missionary Romish priests who were in the
town, and who had been there some time converting the people to
Christianity; but we thought they made but poor work of it, and
made them but sorry Christians when they had done. One of these was
a Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon; another was a
Portuguese; and a third a Genoese. Father Simon was courteous, and
very agreeable company; but the other two were more reserved,
seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously to the work they
came about, viz. to talk with and insinuate themselves among the
inhabitants wherever they had opportunity. We often ate and drank
with those men; and though I must confess the conversion, as they
call it, of the Chinese to Christianity is so far from the true
conversion required to bring heathen people to the faith of Christ,
that it seems to amount to little more than letting them know the
name of Christ, and say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her
Son, in a tongue which they understood not, and to cross
themselves, and the like; yet it must be confessed that the
religionists, whom we call missionaries, have a firm belief that
these people will be saved, and that they are the instruments of
it; and on this account they undergo not only the fatigue of the
voyage, and the hazards of living in such places, but oftentimes
death itself, and the most violent tortures, for the sake of this
work.</p>

<p>Father Simon was appointed, it seems, by order of the chief of
the mission, to go up to Pekin, and waited only for another priest,
who was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go along with him. We
scarce ever met together but he was inviting me to go that journey;
telling me how he would show me all the glorious things of that
mighty empire, and, among the rest, Pekin, the greatest city in the
world: "A city," said he, "that your London and our Paris put
together cannot be equal to." But as I looked on those things with
different eyes from other men, so I shall give my opinion of them
in a few words, when I come in the course of my travels to speak
more particularly of them.</p>

<p>Dining with Father Simon one day, and being very merry together,
I showed some little inclination to go with him; and he pressed me
and my partner very hard to consent. "Why, father," says my
partner, "should you desire our company so much? you know we are
heretics, and you do not love us, nor cannot keep us company with
any pleasure."&mdash;"Oh," says he, "you may perhaps be good
Catholics in time; my business here is to convert heathens, and who
knows but I may convert you too?"&mdash;"Very well, father," said
I, "so you will preach to us all the way?"&mdash;"I will not be
troublesome to you," says he; "our religion does not divest us of
good manners; besides, we are here like countrymen; and so we are,
compared to the place we are in; and if you are Huguenots, and I a
Catholic, we may all be Christians at last; at least, we are all
gentlemen, and we may converse so, without being uneasy to one
another." I liked this part of his discourse very well, and it
began to put me in mind of my priest that I had left in the
Brazils; but Father Simon did not come up to his character by a
great deal; for though this friar had no appearance of a criminal
levity in him, yet he had not that fund of Christian zeal, strict
piety, and sincere affection to religion that my other good
ecclesiastic had.</p>

<p>But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor
solicited us to go with him; we had something else before us at
first, for we had all this while our ship and our merchandise to
dispose of, and we began to be very doubtful what we should do, for
we were now in a place of very little business. Once I was about to
venture to sail for the river of Kilam, and the city of Nankin; but
Providence seemed now more visibly, as I thought, than ever to
concern itself in our affairs; and I was encouraged, from this very
time, to think I should, one way or other, get out of this
entangled circumstance, and be brought home to my own country
again, though I had not the least view of the manner. Providence, I
say, began here to clear up our way a little; and the first thing
that offered was, that our old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan
merchant to us, who inquired what goods we had: and, in the first
place, he bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price for
it, paying us in gold by weight, some in small pieces of their own
coin, and some in small wedges, of about ten or twelves ounces
each. While we were dealing with him for our opium, it came into my
head that he might perhaps deal for the ship too, and I ordered the
interpreter to propose it to him. He shrunk up his shoulders at it
when it was first proposed to him; but in a few days after he came
to me, with one of the missionary priests for his interpreter, and
told me he had a proposal to make to me, which was this: he had
bought a great quantity of our goods, when he had no thoughts of
proposals made to him of buying the ship; and that, therefore, he
had not money to pay for the ship: but if I would let the same men
who were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the ship to go to
Japan; and would send them from thence to the Philippine Islands
with another loading, which he would pay the freight of before they
went from Japan: and that at their return he would buy the ship. I
began to listen to his proposal, and so eager did my head still run
upon rambling, that I could not but begin to entertain a notion of
going myself with him, and so to set sail from the Philippine
Islands away to the South Seas; accordingly, I asked the Japanese
merchant if he would not hire us to the Philippine Islands and
discharge us there. He said No, he could not do that, for then he
could not have the return of his cargo; but he would discharge us
in Japan, at the ship's return. Well, still I was for taking him at
that proposal, and going myself; but my partner, wiser than myself,
persuaded me from it, representing the dangers, as well of the seas
as of the Japanese, who are a false, cruel, and treacherous people;
likewise those of the Spaniards at the Philippines, more false,
cruel, and treacherous than they.</p>

<p>But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion; the
first thing we had to do was to consult with the captain of the
ship, and with his men, and know if they were willing to go to
Japan. While I was doing this, the young man whom my nephew had
left with me as my companion came up, and told me that he thought
that voyage promised very fair, and that there was a great prospect
of advantage, and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but that
if I would not, and would give him leave, he would go as a
merchant, or as I pleased to order him; that if ever he came to
England, and I was there and alive, he would render me a faithful
account of his success, which should be as much mine as I pleased.
I was loath to part with him; but considering the prospect of
advantage, which really was considerable, and that he was a young
fellow likely to do well in it, I inclined to let him go; but I
told him I would consult my partner, and give him an answer the
next day. I discoursed about it with my partner, who thereupon made
a most generous offer: "You know it has been an unlucky ship," said
he, "and we both resolve not to go to sea in it again; if your
steward" (so he called my man) "will venture the voyage, I will
leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him make the best of
it; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets with success
abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits of the ship's
freight to us; the other shall be his own."</p>

<p>If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young man, made
him such an offer, I could not do less than offer him the same; and
all the ship's company being willing to go with him, we made over
half the ship to him in property, and took a writing from him,
obliging him to account for the other, and away he went to Japan.
The Japan merchant proved a very punctual, honest man to him:
protected him at Japan, and got him a licence to come on shore,
which the Europeans in general have not lately obtained. He paid
him his freight very punctually; sent him to the Philippines loaded
with Japan and China wares, and a supercargo of their own, who,
trafficking with the Spaniards, brought back European goods again,
and a great quantity of spices; and there he was not only paid his
freight very well, and at a very good price, but not being willing
to sell the ship, then the merchant furnished him goods on his own
account; and with some money, and some spices of his own which he
brought with him, he went back to the Manillas, where he sold his
cargo very well. Here, having made a good acquaintance at Manilla,
he got his ship made a free ship, and the governor of Manilla hired
him to go to Acapulco, on the coast of America, and gave him a
licence to land there, and to travel to Mexico, and to pass in any
Spanish ship to Europe with all his men. He made the voyage to
Acapulco very happily, and there he sold his ship: and having there
also obtained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he found
means to get to Jamaica, with all his treasure, and about eight
years after came to England exceeding rich.</p>

<p>But to return to our particular affairs, being now to part with
the ship and ship's company, it came before us, of course, to
consider what recompense we should give to the two men that gave us
such timely notice of the design against us in the river Cambodia.
The truth was, they had done us a very considerable service, and
deserved well at our hands; though, by the way, they were a couple
of rogues, too; for, as they believed the story of our being
pirates, and that we had really run away with the ship, they came
down to us, not only to betray the design that was formed against
us, but to go to sea with us as pirates. One of them confessed
afterwards that nothing else but the hopes of going a-roguing
brought him to do it: however, the service they did us was not the
less, and therefore, as I had promised to be grateful to them, I
first ordered the money to be paid them which they said was due to
them on board their respective ships: over and above that, I gave
each of them a small sum of money in gold, which contented them
very well. I then made the Englishman gunner in the ship, the
gunner being now made second mate and purser; the Dutchman I made
boatswain; so they were both very well pleased, and proved very
serviceable, being both able seamen, and very stout fellows.</p>

<p>We were now on shore in China; if I thought myself banished, and
remote from my own country at Bengal, where I had many ways to get
home for my money, what could I think of myself now, when I was
about a thousand leagues farther off from home, and destitute of
all manner of prospect of return? All we had for it was this: that
in about four months' time there was to be another fair at the
place where we were, and then we might be able to purchase various
manufactures of the country, and withal might possibly find some
Chinese junks from Tonquin for sail, that would carry us and our
goods whither we pleased. This I liked very well, and resolved to
wait; besides, as our particular persons were not obnoxious, so if
any English or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps we might have an
opportunity to load our goods, and get passage to some other place
in India nearer home. Upon these hopes we resolved to continue
here; but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three journeys into
the country.</p>

<p>First, we went ten days' journey to Nankin, a city well worth
seeing; they say it has a million of people in it: it is regularly
built, and the streets are all straight, and cross one another in
direct lines. But when I come to compare the miserable people of
these countries with ours, their fabrics, their manner of living,
their government, their religion, their wealth, and their glory, as
some call it, I must confess that I scarcely think it worth my
while to mention them here. We wonder at the grandeur, the riches,
the pomp, the ceremonies, the government, the manufactures, the
commerce, and conduct of these people; not that there is really any
matter for wonder, but because, having a true notion of the
barbarity of those countries, the rudeness and the ignorance that
prevail there, we do not expect to find any such thing so far off.
Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces and royal
buildings of Europe? What their trade to the universal commerce of
England, Holland, France, and Spain? What are their cities to ours,
for wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and
infinite variety? What are their ports, supplied with a few junks
and barks, to our navigation, our merchant fleets, our large and
powerful navies? Our city of London has more trade than half their
mighty empire: one English, Dutch, or French man-of-war of eighty
guns would be able to fight almost all the shipping belonging to
China: but the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the power of
their government, and the strength of their armies, may be a little
surprising to us, because, as I have said, considering them as a
barbarous nation of pagans, little better than savages, we did not
expect such things among them. But all the forces of their empire,
though they were to bring two millions of men into the field
together, would be able to do nothing but ruin the country and
starve themselves; a million of their foot could not stand before
one embattled body of our infantry, posted so as not to be
surrounded, though they were not to be one to twenty in number;
nay, I do not boast if I say that thirty thousand German or English
foot, and ten thousand horse, well managed, could defeat all the
forces of China. Nor is there a fortified town in China that could
hold out one month against the batteries and attacks of an European
army. They have firearms, it is true, but they are awkward and
uncertain in their going off; and their powder has but little
strength. Their armies are badly disciplined, and want skill to
attack, or temper to retreat; and therefore, I must confess, it
seemed strange to me, when I came home, and heard our people say
such fine things of the power, glory, magnificence, and trade of
the Chinese; because, as far as I saw, they appeared to be a
contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to
a government qualified only to rule such a people; and were not its
distance inconceivably, great from Muscovy, and that empire in a
manner as rude, impotent, and ill governed as they, the Czar of
Muscovy might with ease drive them all out of their country, and
conquer them in one campaign; and had the Czar (who is now a
growing prince) fallen this way, instead of attacking the warlike
Swedes, and equally improved himself in the art of war, as they say
he has done; and if none of the powers of Europe had envied or
interrupted him, he might by this time have been Emperor of China,
instead of being beaten by the King of Sweden at Narva, when the
latter was not one to six in number.</p>

<p>As their strength and their grandeur, so their navigation,
commerce, and husbandry are very imperfect, compared to the same
things in Europe; also, in their knowledge, their learning, and in
their skill in the sciences, they are either very awkward or
defective, though they have globes or spheres, and a smattering of
the mathematics, and think they know more than all the world
besides. But they know little of the motions of the heavenly
bodies; and so grossly and absurdly ignorant are their common
people, that when the sun is eclipsed, they think a great dragon
has assaulted it, and is going to run away with it; and they fall a
clattering with all the drums and kettles in the country, to fright
the monster away, just as we do to hive a swarm of bees!</p>

<p>As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have made in
all the accounts I have given of my travels, so I shall make no
more such. It is none of my business, nor any part of my design;
but to give an account of my own adventures through a life of
inimitable wanderings, and a long variety of changes, which,
perhaps, few that come after me will have heard the like of: I
shall, therefore, say very little of all the mighty places, desert
countries, and numerous people I have yet to pass through, more
than relates to my own story, and which my concern among them will
make necessary.</p>

<p>I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of China,
about thirty degrees north of the line, for we were returned from
Nankin. I had indeed a mind to see the city of Pekin, which I had
heard so much of, and Father Simon importuned me daily to do it. At
length his time of going away being set, and the other missionary
who was to go with him being arrived from Macao, it was necessary
that we should resolve either to go or not; so I referred it to my
partner, and left it wholly to his choice, who at length resolved
it in the affirmative, and we prepared for our journey. We set out
with very good advantage as to finding the way; for we got leave to
travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins, a kind of viceroy
or principal magistrate in the province where they reside, and who
take great state upon them, travelling with great attendance, and
great homage from the people, who are sometimes greatly
impoverished by them, being obliged to furnish provisions for them
and all their attendants in their journeys. I particularly observed
in our travelling with his baggage, that though we received
sufficient provisions both for ourselves and our horses from the
country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet we were obliged to pay
for everything we had, after the market price of the country, and
the mandarin's steward collected it duly from us. Thus our
travelling in the retinue of the mandarin, though it was a great
act of kindness, was not such a mighty favour to us, but was a
great advantage to him, considering there were above thirty other
people travelled in the same manner besides us, under the
protection of his retinue; for the country furnished all the
provisions for nothing to him, and yet he took our money for
them.</p>

<p>We were twenty-five days travelling to Pekin, through a country
exceeding populous, but I think badly cultivated; the husbandry,
the economy, and the way of living miserable, though they boast so
much of the industry of the people: I say miserable, if compared
with our own, but not so to these poor wretches, who know no other.
The pride of the poor people is infinitely great, and exceeded by
nothing but their poverty, in some parts, which adds to that which
I call their misery; and I must needs think the savages of America
live much more happy than the poorer sort of these, because as they
have nothing, so they desire nothing; whereas these are proud and
insolent and in the main are in many parts mere beggars and
drudges. Their ostentation is inexpressible; and, if they can, they
love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves, which is to the last
degree ridiculous, as well as their contempt of all the world but
themselves.</p>

<p>I must confess I travelled more pleasantly afterwards in the
deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary than here, and yet
the roads here are well paved and well kept, and very convenient
for travellers; but nothing was more awkward to me than to see such
a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the midst of the grossest
simplicity and ignorance; and my friend Father Simon and I used to
be very merry upon these occasions, to see their beggarly pride.
For example, coming by the house of a country gentleman, as Father
Simon called him, about ten leagues off the city of Nankin, we had
first of all the honour to ride with the master of the house about
two miles; the state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being
a mixture of pomp and poverty. His habit was very proper for a
merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with hanging sleeves, tassels,
and cuts and slashes almost on every side: it covered a taffety
vest, so greasy as to testify that his honour must be a most
exquisite sloven. His horse was a poor, starved, hobbling creature,
and two slaves followed him on foot to drive the poor creature
along; he had a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the beast as
fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail; and thus he
rode by us, with about ten or twelve servants, going from the city
to his country seat, about half a league before us. We travelled on
gently, but this figure of a gentleman rode away before us; and as
we stopped at a village about an hour to refresh us, when we came
by the country seat of this great man, we saw him in a little place
before his door, eating a repast. It was a kind of garden, but he
was easy to be seen; and we were given to understand that the more
we looked at him the better he would be pleased. He sat under a
tree, something like the palmetto, which effectually shaded him
over the head, and on the south side; but under the tree was placed
a large umbrella, which made that part look well enough. He sat
lolling back in a great elbow-chair, being a heavy corpulent man,
and had his meat brought him by two women slaves. He had two more,
one of whom fed the squire with a spoon, and the other held the
dish with one hand, and scraped off what he let fall upon his
worship's beard and taffety vest.</p>

<p>Leaving the poor wretch to please himself with our looking at
him, as if we admired his idle pomp, we pursued our journey. Father
Simon had the curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the
country justice had to feed on in all his state, which he had the
honour to taste of, and which was, I think, a mess of boiled rice,
with a great piece of garlic in it, and a little bag filled with
green pepper, and another plant which they have there, something
like our ginger, but smelling like musk, and tasting like mustard;
all this was put together, and a small piece of lean mutton boiled
in it, and this was his worship's repast. Four or five servants
more attended at a distance, who we supposed were to eat of the
same after their master. As for our mandarin with whom we
travelled, he was respected as a king, surrounded always with his
gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances with such pomp, that
I saw little of him but at a distance. I observed that there was
not a horse in his retinue but that our carrier's packhorses in
England seemed to me to look much better; though it was hard to
judge rightly, for they were so covered with equipage, mantles,
trappings, &amp;c., that we could scarce see anything but their
feet and their heads as they went along.</p>

<p>I was now light-hearted, and all my late trouble and perplexity
being over, I had no anxious thoughts about me, which made this
journey the pleasanter to me; in which no ill accident attended me,
only in passing or fording a small river, my horse fell and made me
free of the country, as they call it&mdash;that is to say, threw me
in. The place was not deep, but it wetted me all over. I mention it
because it spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names
of several people and places which I had occasion to remember, and
which not taking due care of, the leaves rotted, and the words were
never after to be read.</p>

<p>At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody with me but the
youth whom my nephew had given me to attend me as a servant and who
proved very trusty and diligent; and my partner had nobody with him
but one servant, who was a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he
being desirous to see the court, we bore his charges for his
company, and for our use of him as an interpreter, for he
understood the language of the country, and spoke good French and a
little English. Indeed, this old man was most useful to us
everywhere; for we had not been above a week at Pekin, when he came
laughing. "Ah, Seignior Inglese," says he, "I have something to
tell will make your heart glad."&mdash;"My heart glad," says I;
"what can that be? I don't know anything in this country can either
give me joy or grief to any great degree."&mdash;"Yes, yes," said
the old man, in broken English, "make you glad, me
sorry."&mdash;"Why," said I, "will it make you
sorry?"&mdash;"Because," said he, "you have brought me here
twenty-five days' journey, and will leave me to go back alone; and
which way shall I get to my port afterwards, without a ship,
without a horse, without <i>pecune</i>?" so he called money, being
his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make us merry with.
In short, he told us there was a great caravan of Muscovite and
Polish merchants in the city, preparing to set out on their journey
by land to Muscovy, within four or five weeks; and he was sure we
would take the opportunity to go with them, and leave him behind,
to go back alone.</p>

<p>I confess I was greatly surprised with this good news, and had
scarce power to speak to him for some time; but at last I said to
him, "How do you know this? are you sure it is true?"&mdash;"Yes,"
says he; "I met this morning in the street an old acquaintance of
mine, an Armenian, who is among them. He came last from Astrakhan,
and was designed to go to Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, but
has altered his mind, and is now resolved to go with the caravan to
Moscow, and so down the river Volga to Astrakhan."&mdash;"Well,
Seignior," says I, "do not be uneasy about being left to go back
alone; if this be a method for my return to England, it shall be
your fault if you go back to Macao at all." We then went to consult
together what was to be done; and I asked my partner what he
thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would suit with his
affairs? He told me he would do just as I would; for he had settled
all his affairs so well at Bengal, and left his effects in such
good hands, that as we had made a good voyage, if he could invest
it in China silks, wrought and raw, he would be content to go to
England, and then make a voyage back to Bengal by the Company's
ships.</p>

<p>Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portuguese
pilot would go with us, we would bear his charges to Moscow, or to
England, if he pleased; nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed
over-generous in that either, if we had not rewarded him further,
the service he had done us being really worth more than that; for
he had not only been a pilot to us at sea, but he had been like a
broker for us on shore; and his procuring for us a Japan merchant
was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets. So, being willing to
gratify him, which was but doing him justice, and very willing also
to have him with us besides, for he was a most necessary man on all
occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold, which,
as I computed it, was worth one hundred and seventy-five pounds
sterling, between us, and to bear all his charges, both for himself
and horse, except only a horse to carry his goods. Having settled
this between ourselves, we called him to let him know what we had
resolved. I told him he had complained of our being willing to let
him go back alone, and I was now about to tell him we designed he
should not go back at all. That as we had resolved to go to Europe
with the caravan, we were very willing he should go with us; and
that we called him to know his mind. He shook his head and said it
was a long journey, and that he had no <i>pecune</i> to carry him
thither, or to subsist himself when he came there. We told him we
believed it was so, and therefore we had resolved to do something
for him that should let him see how sensible we were of the service
he had done us, and also how agreeable he was to us: and then I
told him what we had resolved to give him here, which he might lay
out as we would do our own; and that as for his charges, if he
would go with us we would set him safe on shore (life and
casualties excepted), either in Muscovy or England, as he would
choose, at our own charge, except only the carriage of his goods.
He received the proposal like a man transported, and told us he
would go with us over all the whole world; and so we all prepared
for our journey. However, as it was with us, so it was with the
other merchants: they had many things to do, and instead of being
ready in five weeks, it was four months and some days before all
things were got together.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;ATTACKED BY TARTARS</h3>

<p>It was the beginning of February, new style, when we set out
from Pekin. My partner and the old pilot had gone express back to
the port where we had first put in, to dispose of some goods which
we had left there; and I, with a Chinese merchant whom I had some
knowledge of at Nankin, and who came to Pekin on his own affairs,
went to Nankin, where I bought ninety pieces of fine damasks, with
about two hundred pieces of other very fine silk of several sorts,
some mixed with gold, and had all these brought to Pekin against my
partner's return. Besides this, we bought a large quantity of raw
silk, and some other goods, our cargo amounting, in these goods
only, to about three thousand five hundred pounds sterling; which,
together with tea and some fine calicoes, and three camels' loads
of nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels for our share,
besides those we rode upon; these, with two or three spare horses,
and two horses loaded with provisions, made together twenty-six
camels and horses in our retinue.</p>

<p>The company was very great, and, as near as I can remember, made
between three and four hundred horses, and upwards of one hundred
and twenty men, very well armed and provided for all events; for as
the Eastern caravans are subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so
are these by the Tartars. The company consisted of people of
several nations, but there were above sixty of them merchants or
inhabitants of Moscow, though of them some were Livonians; and to
our particular satisfaction, five of them were Scots, who appeared
also to be men of great experience in business, and of very good
substance.</p>

<p>When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides, who were
five in number, called all the passengers, except the servants, to
a great council, as they called it. At this council every one
deposited a certain quantity of money to a common stock, for the
necessary expense of buying forage on the way, where it was not
otherwise to be had, and for satisfying the guides, getting horses,
and the like. Here, too, they constituted the journey, as they call
it, viz. they named captains and officers to draw us all up, and
give the word of command, in case of an attack, and give every one
their turn of command; nor was this forming us into order any more
than what we afterwards found needful on the way.</p>

<p>The road all on this side of the country is very populous, and
is full of potters and earth-makers&mdash;that is to say, people,
that temper the earth for the China ware. As I was coming along,
our Portuguese pilot, who had always something or other to say to
make us merry, told me he would show me the greatest rarity in all
the country, and that I should have this to say of China, after all
the ill-humoured things that I had said of it, that I had seen one
thing which was not to be seen in all the world beside. I was very
importunate to know what it was; at last he told me it was a
gentleman's house built with China ware. "Well," says I, "are not
the materials of their buildings the products of their own country,
and so it is all China ware, is it not?"&mdash;"No, no," says he,
"I mean it is a house all made of China ware, such as you call it
in England, or as it is called in our country,
porcelain."&mdash;"Well," says I, "such a thing may be; how big is
it? Can we carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can we will buy
it."&mdash;"Upon a camel!" says the old pilot, holding up both his
hands; "why, there is a family of thirty people lives in it."</p>

<p>I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I came to it, it
was nothing but this: it was a timber house, or a house built, as
we call it in England, with lath and plaster, but all this
plastering was really China ware&mdash;that is to say, it was
plastered with the earth that makes China ware. The outside, which
the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and looked very well, perfectly
white, and painted with blue figures, as the large China ware in
England is painted, and hard as if it had been burnt. As to the
inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot, were lined with
hardened and painted tiles, like the little square tiles we call
galley-tiles in England, all made of the finest china, and the
figures exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of
colours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one figure, but
joined so artificially, the mortar being made of the same earth,
that it was very hard to see where the tiles met. The floors of the
rooms were of the same composition, and as hard as the earthen
floors we have in use in several parts of England; as hard as
stone, and smooth, but not burnt and painted, except some smaller
rooms, like closets, which were all, as it were, paved with the
same tile; the ceiling and all the plastering work in the whole
house were of the same earth; and, after all, the roof was covered
with tiles of the same, but of a deep shining black. This was a
China warehouse indeed, truly and literally to be called so, and
had I not been upon the journey, I could have stayed some days to
see and examine the particulars of it. They told me there were
fountains and fishponds in the garden, all paved on the bottom and
sides with the same; and fine statues set up in rows on the walks,
entirely formed of the porcelain earth, burnt whole.</p>

<p>As this is one of the singularities of China, so they may be
allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure they excel in their
accounts of it; for they told me such incredible things of their
performance in crockery-ware, for such it is, that I care not to
relate, as knowing it could not be true. They told me, in
particular, of one workman that made a ship with all its tackle and
masts and sails in earthenware, big enough to carry fifty men. If
they had told me he launched it, and made a voyage to Japan in it,
I might have said something to it indeed; but as it was, I knew the
whole of the story, which was, in short, that the fellow lied: so I
smiled, and said nothing to it. This odd sight kept me two hours
behind the caravan, for which the leader of it for the day fined me
about the value of three shillings; and told me if it had been
three days' journey without the wall, as it was three days' within,
he must have fined me four times as much, and made me ask pardon
the next council-day. I promised to be more orderly; and, indeed, I
found afterwards the orders made for keeping all together were
absolutely necessary for our common safety.</p>

<p>In two days more we passed the great China wall, made for a
fortification against the Tartars: and a very great work it is,
going over hills and mountains in an endless track, where the rocks
are impassable, and the precipices such as no enemy could possibly
enter, or indeed climb up, or where, if they did, no wall could
hinder them. They tell us its length is near a thousand English
miles, but that the country is five hundred in a straight measured
line, which the wall bounds without measuring the windings and
turnings it takes; it is about four fathoms high, and as many thick
in some places.</p>

<p>I stood still an hour or thereabouts without trespassing on our
orders (for so long the caravan was in passing the gate), to look
at it on every side, near and far off; I mean what was within my
view: and the guide, who had been extolling it for the wonder of
the world, was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. I told him it
was a most excellent thing to keep out the Tartars; which he
happened not to understand as I meant it and so took it for a
compliment; but the old pilot laughed! "Oh, Seignior Inglese," says
he, "you speak in colours."&mdash;"In colours!" said I; "what do
you mean by that?"&mdash;"Why, you speak what looks white this way
and black that way&mdash;gay one way and dull another. You tell him
it is a good wall to keep out Tartars; you tell me by that it is
good for nothing but to keep out Tartars. I understand you,
Seignior Inglese, I understand you; but Seignior Chinese understood
you his own way."&mdash;"Well," says I, "do you think it would
stand out an army of our country people, with a good train of
artillery; or our engineers, with two companies of miners? Would
not they batter it down in ten days, that an army might enter in
battalia; or blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that there
should be no sign of it left?"&mdash;"Ay, ay," says he, "I know
that." The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I said to the
pilot, and I gave him leave to tell him a few days after, for we
were then almost out of their country, and he was to leave us a
little time after this; but when he knew what I said, he was dumb
all the rest of the way, and we heard no more of his fine story of
the Chinese power and greatness while he stayed.</p>

<p>After we passed this mighty nothing, called a wall, something
like the Picts' walls so famous in Northumberland, built by the
Romans, we began to find the country thinly inhabited, and the
people rather confined to live in fortified towns, as being subject
to the inroads and depredations of the Tartars, who rob in great
armies, and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked
inhabitants of an open country. And here I began to find the
necessity of keeping together in a caravan as we travelled, for we
saw several troops of Tartars roving about; but when I came to see
them distinctly, I wondered more that the Chinese empire could be
conquered by such contemptible fellows; for they are a mere horde
of wild fellows, keeping no order and understanding no discipline
or manner of it. Their horses are poor lean creatures, taught
nothing, and fit for nothing; and this we found the first day we
saw them, which was after we entered the wilder part of the
country. Our leader for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us
to go a hunting as they call it; and what was this but a hunting of
sheep!&mdash;however, it may be called hunting too, for these
creatures are the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever I saw of
their kind! only they will not run a great way, and you are sure of
sport when you begin the chase, for they appear generally thirty or
forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, always keep together when
they fly.</p>

<p>In pursuit of this odd sort of game it was our hap to meet with
about forty Tartars: whether they were hunting mutton, as we were,
or whether they looked for another kind of prey, we know not; but
as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a hideous blast on a kind
of horn. This was to call their friends about them, and in less
than ten minutes a troop of forty or fifty more appeared, at about
a mile distance; but our work was over first, as it happened.</p>

<p>One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be amongst us;
and as soon as he heard the horn, he told us that we had nothing to
do but to charge them without loss of time; and drawing us up in a
line, he asked if we were resolved. We told him we were ready to
follow him; so he rode directly towards them. They stood gazing at
us like a mere crowd, drawn up in no sort of order at all; but as
soon as they saw us advance, they let fly their arrows, which
missed us, very happily. Not that they mistook their aim, but their
distance; for their arrows all fell a little short of us, but with
so true an aim, that had we been about twenty yards nearer we must
have had several men wounded, if not killed.</p>

<p>Immediately we halted, and though it was at a great distance, we
fired, and sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows, following
our shot full gallop, to fall in among them sword in hand&mdash;for
so our bold Scot that led us directed. He was, indeed, but a
merchant, but he behaved with such vigour and bravery on this
occasion, and yet with such cool courage too, that I never saw any
man in action fitter for command. As soon as we came up to them we
fired our pistols in their faces and then drew; but they fled in
the greatest confusion imaginable. The only stand any of them made
was on our right, where three of them stood, and, by signs, called
the rest to come back to them, having a kind of scimitar in their
hands, and their bows hanging to their backs. Our brave commander,
without asking anybody to follow him, gallops up close to them, and
with his fusee knocks one of them off his horse, killed the second
with his pistol, and the third ran away. Thus ended our fight; but
we had this misfortune attending it, that all our mutton we had in
chase got away. We had not a man killed or hurt; as for the
Tartars, there were about five of them killed&mdash;how many were
wounded we knew not; but this we knew, that the other party were so
frightened with the noise of our guns that they fled, and never
made any attempt upon us.</p>

<p>We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and therefore
the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards; but in about five days
we entered a vast wild desert, which held us three days' and
nights' march; and we were obliged to carry our water with us in
great leathern bottles, and to encamp all night, just as I have
heard they do in the desert of Arabia. I asked our guides whose
dominion this was in, and they told me this was a kind of border
that might be called no man's land, being a part of Great
Karakathy, or Grand Tartary: that, however, it was all reckoned as
belonging to China, but that there was no care taken here to
preserve it from the inroads of thieves, and therefore it was
reckoned the worst desert in the whole march, though we were to go
over some much larger.</p>

<p>In passing this frightful wilderness we saw, two or three times,
little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to be upon their own
affairs, and to have no design upon us; and so, like the man who
met the devil, if they had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to
say to them: we let them go. Once, however, a party of them came so
near as to stand and gaze at us. Whether it was to consider if they
should attack us or not, we knew not; but when we had passed at
some distance by them, we made a rear-guard of forty men, and stood
ready for them, letting the caravan pass half a mile or thereabouts
before us. After a while they marched off, but they saluted us with
five arrows at their parting, which wounded a horse so that it
disabled him, and we left him the next day, poor creature, in great
need of a good farrier. We saw no more arrows or Tartars that
time.</p>

<p>We travelled near a month after this, the ways not being so good
as at first, though still in the dominions of the Emperor of China,
but lay for the most part in the villages, some of which were
fortified, because of the incursions of the Tartars. When we were
come to one of these towns (about two days and a half's journey
before we came to the city of Naum), I wanted to buy a camel, of
which there are plenty to be sold all the way upon that road, and
horses also, such as they are, because, so many caravans coming
that way, they are often wanted. The person that I spoke to to get
me a camel would have gone and fetched one for me; but I, like a
fool, must be officious, and go myself along with him; the place
was about two miles out of the village, where it seems they kept
the camels and horses feeding under a guard.</p>

<p>I walked it on foot, with my old pilot and a Chinese, being very
desirous of a little variety. When we came to the place it was a
low, marshy ground, walled round with stones, piled up dry, without
mortar or earth among them, like a park, with a little guard of
Chinese soldiers at the door. Having bought a camel, and agreed for
the price, I came away, and the Chinese that went with me led the
camel, when on a sudden came up five Tartars on horseback. Two of
them seized the fellow and took the camel from him, while the other
three stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing us, as it were,
unarmed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword, which could but
ill defend me against three horsemen. The first that came up
stopped short upon my drawing my sword, for they are arrant
cowards; but a second, coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the
head, which I never felt till afterwards, and wondered, when I came
to myself, what was the matter, and where I was, for he laid me
flat on the ground; but my never-failing old pilot, the Portuguese,
had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the
Tartars either: if they had, I suppose they would not have attacked
us, for cowards are always boldest when there is no danger. The old
man seeing me down, with a bold heart stepped up to the fellow that
had struck me, and laying hold of his arm with one hand, and
pulling him down by main force a little towards him, with the other
shot him into the head, and laid him dead upon the spot. He then
immediately stepped up to him who had stopped us, as I said, and
before he could come forward again, made a blow at him with a
scimitar, which he always wore, but missing the man, struck his
horse in the side of his head, cut one of the ears off by the root,
and a great slice down by the side of his face. The poor beast,
enraged with the wound, was no more to be governed by his rider,
though the fellow sat well enough too, but away he flew, and
carried him quite out of the pilot's reach; and at some distance,
rising upon his hind legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell upon
him.</p>

<p>In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had lost the
camel, but he had no weapon; however, seeing the Tartar down, and
his horse fallen upon him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon an
ugly weapon he had by his side, something like a pole-axe, he
wrenched it from him, and made shift to knock his Tartarian brains
out with it. But my old man had the third Tartar to deal with
still; and seeing he did not fly, as he expected, nor come on to
fight him, as he apprehended, but stood stock still, the old man
stood still too, and fell to work with his tackle to charge his
pistol again: but as soon as the Tartar saw the pistol away he
scoured, and left my pilot, my champion I called him afterwards, a
complete victory.</p>

<p>By this time I was a little recovered. I thought, when I first
began to wake, that I had been in a sweet sleep; but, as I said
above, I wondered where I was, how I came upon the ground, and what
was the matter. A few moments after, as sense returned, I felt
pain, though I did not know where; so I clapped my hand to my head,
and took it away bloody; then I felt my head ache: and in a moment
memory returned, and everything was present to me again. I jumped
upon my feet instantly, and got hold of my sword, but no enemies
were in view: I found a Tartar lying dead, and his horse standing
very quietly by him; and, looking further, I saw my deliverer, who
had been to see what the Chinese had done, coming back with his
hanger in his hand. The old man, seeing me on my feet, came running
to me, and joyfully embraced me, being afraid before that I had
been killed. Seeing me bloody, he would see how I was hurt; but it
was not much, only what we call a broken head; neither did I
afterwards find any great inconvenience from the blow, for it was
well again in two or three days.</p>

<p>We made no great gain, however, by this victory, for we lost a
camel and gained a horse. I paid for the lost camel, and sent for
another; but I did not go to fetch it myself: I had had enough of
that.</p>

<p>The city of Naum, which we were approaching, is a frontier of
the Chinese empire, and is fortified in their fashion. We wanted,
as I have said, above two days' journey of this city when
messengers were sent express to every part of the road to tell all
travellers and caravans to halt till they had a guard sent for
them; for that an unusual body of Tartars, making ten thousand in
all, had appeared in the way, about thirty miles beyond the
city.</p>

<p>This was very bad news to travellers: however, it was carefully
done of the governor, and we were very glad to hear we should have
a guard. Accordingly, two days after, we had two hundred soldiers
sent us from a garrison of the Chinese on our left, and three
hundred more from the city of Naum, and with these we advanced
boldly. The three hundred soldiers from Naum marched in our front,
the two hundred in our rear, and our men on each side of our
camels, with our baggage and the whole caravan in the centre; in
this order, and well prepared for battle, we thought ourselves a
match for the whole ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had
appeared; but the next day, when they did appear, it was quite
another thing.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV&mdash;DESCRIPTION OF AN IDOL, WHICH THEY
DESTROY</h3>

<p>Early in the morning, when marching from a little town called
Changu, we had a river to pass, which we were obliged to ferry;
and, had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been the time
to have attacked us, when the caravan being over, the rear-guard
was behind; but they did not appear there. About three hours after,
when we were entered upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen
miles over, we knew by a cloud of dust they raised, that the enemy
was at hand, and presently they came on upon the spur.</p>

<p>Our Chinese guards in the front, who had talked so big the day
before, began to stagger; and the soldiers frequently looked behind
them, a certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to run
away. My old pilot was of my mind; and being near me, called out,
"Seignior Inglese, these fellows must be encouraged, or they will
ruin us all; for if the Tartars come on they will never stand
it."&mdash;"If am of your mind," said I; "but what must be
done?"&mdash;"Done?" says he, "let fifty of our men advance, and
flank them on each wing, and encourage them. They will fight like
brave fellows in brave company; but without this they will every
man turn his back." Immediately I rode up to our leader and told
him, who was exactly of our mind; accordingly, fifty of us marched
to the right wing, and fifty to the left, and the rest made a line
of rescue; and so we marched, leaving the last two hundred men to
make a body of themselves, and to guard the camels; only that, if
need were, they should send a hundred men to assist the last
fifty.</p>

<p>At last the Tartars came on, and an innumerable company they
were; how many we could not tell, but ten thousand, we thought, at
the least. A party of them came on first, and viewed our posture,
traversing the ground in the front of our line; and, as we found
them within gunshot, our leader ordered the two wings to advance
swiftly, and give them a salvo on each wing with their shot, which
was done. They then went off, I suppose to give an account of the
reception they were like to meet with; indeed, that salute cloyed
their stomachs, for they immediately halted, stood a while to
consider of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over their
design for that time, which was very agreeable to our
circumstances.</p>

<p>Two days after we came to the city of Naun, or Naum; we thanked
the governor for his care of us, and collected to the value of a
hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent
to guard us; and here we rested one day. This is a garrison indeed,
and there were nine hundred soldiers kept here; but the reason of
it was, that formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them
than they now do, the Muscovites having abandoned that part of the
country, which lies from this city west for about two hundred
miles, as desolate and unfit for use; and more especially being so
very remote, and so difficult to send troops thither for its
defence; for we were yet above two thousand miles from Muscovy
properly so called. After this we passed several great rivers, and
two dreadful deserts; one of which we were sixteen days passing
over; and on the 13th of April we came to the frontiers of the
Muscovite dominions. I think the first town or fortress, whichever
it may he called, that belonged to the Czar, was called Arguna,
being on the west side of the river Arguna.</p>

<p>I could not but feel great satisfaction that I was arrived in a
country governed by Christians; for though the Muscovites do, in my
opinion, but just deserve the name of Christians, yet such they
pretend to be, and are very devout in their way. It would certainly
occur to any reflecting man who travels the world as I have done,
what a blessing it is to be brought into the world where the name
of God and a Redeemer is known, adored, and worshipped; and not
where the people, given up to strong delusions, worship the devil,
and prostrate themselves to monsters, elements, horrid-shaped
animals, and monstrous images. Not a town or city we passed through
but had their pagodas, their idols, and their temples, and ignorant
people worshipping even the works of their own hands. Now we came
where, at least, a face of the Christian worship appeared; where
the knee was bowed to Jesus: and whether ignorantly or not, yet the
Christian religion was owned, and the name of the true God was
called upon and adored; and it made my soul rejoice to see it. I
saluted the brave Scots merchant with my first acknowledgment of
this; and taking him by the hand, I said to him, "Blessed be God,
we are once again amongst Christians." He smiled, and answered, "Do
not rejoice too soon, countryman; these Muscovites are but an odd
sort of Christians; and but for the name of it you may see very
little of the substance for some months further of our
journey."&mdash;"Well," says I, "but still it is better than
paganism, and worshipping of devils."&mdash;"Why, I will tell you,"
says he; "except the Russian soldiers in the garrisons, and a few
of the inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the rest of
this country, for above a thousand miles farther, is inhabited by
the worst and most ignorant of pagans." And so, indeed, we found
it.</p>

<p>We now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth that is
to be found in any part of the world; we had, at least, twelve
thousand miles to the sea eastward; two thousand to the bottom of
the Baltic Sea westward; and above three thousand, if we left that
sea, and went on west, to the British and French channels: we had
full five thousand miles to the Indian or Persian Sea south; and
about eight hundred to the Frozen Sea north.</p>

<p>We advanced from the river Arguna by easy and moderate journeys,
and were very visibly obliged to the care the Czar has taken to
have cities and towns built in as many places as it is possible to
place them, where his soldiers keep garrison, something like the
stationary soldiers placed by the Romans in the remotest countries
of their empire; some of which I had read of were placed in
Britain, for the security of commerce, and for the lodging of
travellers. Thus it was here; for wherever we came, though at these
towns and stations the garrisons and governors were Russians, and
professed Christians, yet the inhabitants were mere pagans,
sacrificing to idols, and worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or
all the host of heaven; and not only so, but were, of all the
heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the most barbarous,
except only that they did not eat men's flesh.</p>

<p>Some instances of this we met with in the country between
Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite dominions, and a city of
Tartars and Russians together, called Nortziousky, in which is a
continued desert or forest, which cost us twenty days to travel
over. In a village near the last of these places I had the
curiosity to go and see their way of living, which is most brutish
and unsufferable. They had, I suppose, a great sacrifice that day;
for there stood out, upon an old stump of a tree, a diabolical kind
of idol made of wood; it was dressed up, too, in the most filthy
manner; its upper garment was of sheepskins, with the wool outward;
a great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two horns growing through
it; it was about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, nor any
other proportion of parts.</p>

<p>This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village; and
when I came near to it there were sixteen or seventeen creatures
all lying flat upon the ground round this hideous block of wood; I
saw no motion among them, any more than if they had been all logs,
like the idol, and at first I really thought they had been so; but,
when I came a little nearer, they started up upon their feet, and
raised a howl, as if it had been so many deep-mouthed hounds, and
walked away, as if they were displeased at our disturbing them. A
little way off from the idol, and at the door of a hut, made of
sheep and cow skins dried, stood three men with long knives in
their hands; and in the middle of the tent appeared three sheep
killed, and one young bullock. These, it seems, were sacrifices to
that senseless log of an idol; the three men were priests belonging
to it, and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the people who
brought the offering, and were offering their prayers to that
stock.</p>

<p>I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish
worship of a hobgoblin than ever I was at anything in my life, and,
overcome with rage, I rode up to the hideous idol, and with my
sword made a stroke at the bonnet that was on its head, and cut it
in two; and one of our men that was with me, taking hold of the
sheepskin that covered it, pulled at it, when, behold, a most
hideous outcry ran through the village, and two or three hundred
people came about my ears, so that I was glad to scour for it, for
some had bows and arrows; but I resolved from that moment to visit
them again. Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was
about four miles off, in order to provide some horses which they
wanted, several of the horses having been lamed and jaded with the
long march over the last desert; so we had some leisure here to put
my design in execution. I communicated it to the Scots merchant, of
whose courage I had sufficient testimony; I told him what I had
seen, and with what indignation I had since thought that human
nature could be so degenerate; I told him if I could get but four
or five men well armed to go with me, I was resolved to go and
destroy that vile, abominable idol, and let them see that it had no
power to help itself, and consequently could not be an object of
worship, or to be prayed to, much less help them that offered
sacrifices to it.</p>

<p>He at first objected to my plan as useless, seeing that, owing
to the gross ignorance of the people, they could not be brought to
profit by the lesson I meant to teach them; and added that, from
his knowledge of the country and its customs, he feared we should
fall into great peril by giving offence to these brutal idol
worshippers. This somewhat stayed my purpose, but I was still
uneasy all that day to put my project in execution; and that
evening, meeting the Scots merchant in our walk about the town, I
again called upon him to aid me in it. When he found me resolute he
said that, on further thoughts, he could not but applaud the
design, and told me I should not go alone, but he would go with me;
but he would go first and bring a stout fellow, one of his
countrymen, to go also with us; "and one," said he, "as famous for
his zeal as you can desire any one to be against such devilish
things as these." So we agreed to go, only we three and my
man-servant, and resolved to put it in execution the following
night about midnight, with all possible secrecy.</p>

<p>We thought it better to delay it till the next night, because
the caravan being to set forward in the morning, we suppose the
governor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction upon us
when we were out of his power. The Scots merchant, as steady in his
resolution for the enterprise as bold in executing, brought me a
Tartar's robe or gown of sheepskins, and a bonnet, with a bow and
arrows, and had provided the same for himself and his countryman,
that the people, if they saw us, should not determine who we were.
All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter,
with aqua vitae, gunpowder, and such other materials as we could
get; and having a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an
hour after night we set out upon our expedition.</p>

<p>We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and found
that the people had not the least suspicion of danger attending
their idol. The night was cloudy: yet the moon gave us light enough
to see that the idol stood just in the same posture and place that
it did before. The people seemed to be all at their rest; only that
in the great hut, where we saw the three priests, we saw a light,
and going up close to the door, we heard people talking as if there
were five or six of them; we concluded, therefore, that if we set
wildfire to the idol, those men would come out immediately, and run
up to the place to rescue it from destruction; and what to do with
them we knew not. Once we thought of carrying it away, and setting
fire to it at a distance; but when we came to handle it, we found
it too bulky for our carriage, so we were at a loss again. The
second Scotsman was for setting fire to the hut, and knocking the
creatures that were there on the head when they came out; but I
could not join with that; I was against killing them, if it were
possible to avoid it. "Well, then," said the Scots merchant, "I
will tell you what we will do: we will try to make them prisoners,
tie their hands, and make them stand and see their idol
destroyed."</p>

<p>As it happened, we had twine or packthread enough about us,
which we used to tie our firelocks together with; so we resolved to
attack these people first, and with as little noise as we could.
The first thing we did, we knocked at the door, when one of the
priests coming to it, we immediately seized upon him, stopped his
mouth, and tied his hands behind him, and led him to the idol,
where we gagged him that he might not make a noise, tied his feet
also together, and left him on the ground.</p>

<p>Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another would
come out to see what the matter was; but we waited so long till the
third man came back to us; and then nobody coming out, we knocked
again gently, and immediately out came two more, and we served them
just in the same manner, but were obliged to go all with them, and
lay them down by the idol some distance from one another; when,
going back, we found two more were come out of the door, and a
third stood behind them within the door. We seized the two, and
immediately tied them, when the third, stepping back and crying
out, my Scots merchant went in after them, and taking out a
composition we had made that would only smoke and stink, he set
fire to it, and threw it in among them. By that time the other
Scotsman and my man, taking charge of the two men already bound,
and tied together also by the arm, led them away to the idol, and
left them there, to see if their idol would relieve them, making
haste back to us.</p>

<p>When the fuze we had thrown in had filled the hut with so much
smoke that they were almost suffocated, we threw in a small leather
bag of another kind, which flamed like a candle, and, following it
in, we found there were but four people, who, as we supposed, had
been about some of their diabolical sacrifices. They appeared, in
short, frightened to death, at least so as to sit trembling and
stupid, and not able to speak either, for the smoke.</p>

<p>We quickly took them from the hut, where the smoke soon drove us
out, bound them as we had done the other, and all without any
noise. Then we carried them all together to the idol; when we came
there, we fell to work with him. First, we daubed him all over, and
his robes also, with tar, and tallow mixed with brimstone; then we
stopped his eyes and ears and mouth full of gunpowder, and wrapped
up a great piece of wildfire in his bonnet; then sticking all the
combustibles we had brought with us upon him, we looked about to
see if we could find anything else to help to burn him; when my
Scotsman remembered that by the hut, where the men were, there lay
a heap of dry forage; away he and the other Scotsman ran and
fetched their arms full of that. When we had done this, we took all
our prisoners, and brought them, having untied their feet and
ungagged their mouths, and made them stand up, and set them before
their monstrous idol, and then set fire to the whole.</p>

<p>We stayed by it a quarter of an hour or thereabouts, till the
powder in the eyes and mouth and ears of the idol blew up, and, as
we could perceive, had split altogether; and in a word, till we saw
it burned so that it would soon be quite consumed. We then began to
think of going away; but the Scotsman said, "No, we must not go,
for these poor deluded wretches will all throw themselves into the
fire, and burn themselves with the idol." So we resolved to stay
till the forage has burned down too, and then came away and left
them. After the feat was performed, we appeared in the morning
among our fellow-travellers, exceedingly busy in getting ready for
our journey; nor could any man suppose that we had been anywhere
but in our beds.</p>

<p>But the affair did not end so; the next day came a great number
of the country people to the town gates, and in a most outrageous
manner demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor for the
insulting their priests and burning their great Cham Chi-Thaungu.
The people of Nertsinkay were at first in a great consternation,
for they said the Tartars were already no less than thirty thousand
strong. The Russian governor sent out messengers to appease them,
assuring them that he knew nothing of it, and that there had not a
soul in his garrison been abroad, so that it could not be from
anybody there: but if they could let him know who did it, they
should be exemplarily punished. They returned haughtily, that all
the country reverenced the great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the
sun, and no mortal would have dared to offer violence to his image
but some Christian miscreant; and they therefore resolved to
denounce war against him and all the Russians, who, they said, were
miscreants and Christians.</p>

<p>The governor, unwilling to make a breach, or to have any cause
of war alleged to be given by him, the Czar having strictly charged
him to treat the conquered country with gentleness, gave them all
the good words he could. At last he told them there was a caravan
gone towards Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some of them
who had done them this injury; and that if they would be satisfied
with that, he would send after them to inquire into it. This seemed
to appease them a little; and accordingly the governor sent after
us, and gave us a particular account how the thing was; intimating
withal, that if any in our caravan had done it they should make
their escape; but that whether we had done it or no, we should make
all the haste forward that was possible: and that, in the meantime,
he would keep them in play as long as he could.</p>

<p>This was very friendly in the governor; however, when it came to
the caravan, there was nobody knew anything of the matter; and as
for us that were guilty, we were least of all suspected. However,
the captain of the caravan for the time took the hint that the
governor gave us, and we travelled two days and two nights without
any considerable stop, and then we lay at a village called Plothus:
nor did we make any long stop here, but hastened on towards
Jarawena, another Muscovite colony, and where we expected we should
be safe. But upon the second day's march from Plothus, by the
clouds of dust behind us at a great distance, it was plain we were
pursued. We had entered a vast desert, and had passed by a great
lake called Schanks Oser, when we perceived a large body of horse
appear on the other side of the lake, to the north, we travelling
west. We observed they went away west, as we did, but had supposed
we would have taken that side of the lake, whereas we very happily
took the south side; and in two days more they disappeared again:
for they, believing we were still before them, pushed on till they
came to the Udda, a very great river when it passes farther north,
but when we came to it we found it narrow and fordable.</p>

<p>The third day they had either found their mistake, or had
intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us towards dusk. We
had, to our great satisfaction, just pitched upon a convenient
place for our camp; for as we had just entered upon a desert above
five hundred miles over, where we had no towns to lodge at, and,
indeed, expected none but the city Jarawena, which we had yet two
days' march to; the desert, however, had some few woods in it on
this side, and little rivers, which ran all into the great river
Udda; it was in a narrow strait, between little but very thick
woods, that we pitched our camp that night, expecting to be
attacked before morning. As it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to
go about in troops in that desert, so the caravans always fortify
themselves every night against them, as against armies of robbers;
and it was, therefore, no new thing to be pursued. But we had this
night a most advantageous camp: for as we lay between two woods,
with a little rivulet running just before our front, we could not
be surrounded, or attacked any way but in our front or rear. We
took care also to make our front as strong as we could, by placing
our packs, with the camels and horses, all in a line, on the inside
of the river, and felling some trees in our rear.</p>

<p>In this posture we encamped for the night; but the enemy was
upon us before we had finished. They did not come on like thieves,
as we expected, but sent three messengers to us, to demand the men
to be delivered to them that had abused their priests and burned
their idol, that they might burn them with fire; and upon this,
they said, they would go away, and do us no further harm, otherwise
they would destroy us all. Our men looked very blank at this
message, and began to stare at one another to see who looked with
the most guilt in their faces; but nobody was the word&mdash;nobody
did it. The leader of the caravan sent word he was well assured
that it was not done by any of our camp; that we were peaceful
merchants, travelling on our business; that we had done no harm to
them or to any one else; and that, therefore, they must look
further for the enemies who had injured them, for we were not the
people; so they desired them not to disturb us, for if they did we
should defend ourselves.</p>

<p>They were far from being satisfied with this for an answer: and
a great crowd of them came running down in the morning, by break of
day, to our camp; but seeing us so well posted, they durst come no
farther than the brook in our front, where they stood in such
number as to terrify us very much; indeed, some spoke of ten
thousand. Here they stood and looked at us a while, and then,
setting up a great howl, let fly a crowd of arrows among us; but we
were well enough sheltered under our baggage, and I do not remember
that one of us was hurt.</p>

<p>Some time after this we saw them move a little to our right, and
expected them on the rear: when a cunning fellow, a Cossack of
Jarawena, calling to the leader of the caravan, said to him, "I
will send all these people away to Sibeilka." This was a city four
or five days' journey at least to the right, and rather behind us.
So he takes his bow and arrows, and getting on horseback, he rides
away from our rear directly, as it were back to Nertsinskay; after
this he takes a great circuit about, and comes directly on the army
of the Tartars as if he had been sent express to tell them a long
story that the people who had burned the Cham Chi-Thaungu were gone
to Sibeilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he called
them&mdash;that is to say, Christians; and that they had resolved
to burn the god Scal-Isar, belonging to the Tonguses. As this
fellow was himself a Tartar, and perfectly spoke their language, he
counterfeited so well that they all believed him, and away they
drove in a violent hurry to Sibeilka. In less than three hours they
were entirely out of our sight, and we never heard any more of
them, nor whether they went to Sibeilka or no. So we passed away
safely on to Jarawena, where there was a Russian garrison, and
there we rested five days.</p>

<p>From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us
twenty-three days' march. We furnished ourselves with some tents
here, for the better accommodating ourselves in the night; and the
leader of the caravan procured sixteen waggons of the country, for
carrying our water or provisions, and these carriages were our
defence every night round our little camp; so that had the Tartars
appeared, unless they had been very numerous indeed, they would not
have been able to hurt us. We may well be supposed to have wanted
rest again after this long journey; for in this desert we neither
saw house nor tree, and scarce a bush; though we saw abundance of
the sable-hunters, who are all Tartars of Mogul Tartary; of which
this country is a part; and they frequently attack small caravans,
but we saw no numbers of them together.</p>

<p>After we had passed this desert we came into a country pretty
well inhabited&mdash;that is to say, we found towns and castles,
settled by the Czar with garrisons of stationary soldiers, to
protect the caravans and defend the country against the Tartars,
who would otherwise make it very dangerous travelling; and his
czarish majesty has given such strict orders for the well guarding
the caravans, that, if there are any Tartars heard of in the
country, detachments of the garrison are always sent to see the
travellers safe from station to station. Thus the governor of
Adinskoy, whom I had an opportunity to make a visit to, by means of
the Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, offered us a guard
of fifty men, if we thought there was any danger, to the next
station.</p>

<p>I thought, long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe we
should find the country better inhabited, and the people more
civilised; but I found myself mistaken in both: for we had yet the
nation of the Tonguses to pass through, where we saw the same
tokens of paganism and barbarity as before; only, as they were
conquered by the Muscovites, they were not so dangerous, but for
rudeness of manners and idolatry no people in the world ever went
beyond them. They are all clothed in skins of beasts, and their
houses are built of the same; you know not a man from a woman,
neither by the ruggedness of their countenances nor their clothes;
and in the winter, when the ground is covered with snow, they live
underground in vaults, which have cavities going from one to
another. If the Tartars had their Cham Chi-Thaungu for a whole
village or country, these had idols in every hut and every cave.
This country, I reckon, was, from the desert I spoke of last, at
least four hundred miles, half of it being another desert, which
took us up twelve days' severe travelling, without house or tree;
and we were obliged again to carry our own provisions, as well
water as bread. After we were out of this desert and had travelled
two days, we came to Janezay, a Muscovite city or station, on the
great river Janezay, which, they told us there, parted Europe from
Asia.</p>

<p>All the country between the river Oby and the river Janezay is
as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, as the remotest of
the Tartars. I also found, which I observed to the Muscovite
governors whom I had an opportunity to converse with, that the poor
pagans are not much wiser, or nearer Christianity, for being under
the Muscovite government, which they acknowledged was true
enough&mdash;but that, as they said, was none of their business;
that if the Czar expected to convert his Siberian, Tonguse, or
Tartar subjects, it should be done by sending clergymen among them,
not soldiers; and they added, with more sincerity than I expected,
that it was not so much the concern of their monarch to make the
people Christians as to make them subjects.</p>

<p>From this river to the Oby we crossed a wild uncultivated
country, barren of people and good management, otherwise it is in
itself a pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What
inhabitants we found in it are all pagans, except such as are sent
among them from Russia; for this is the country&mdash;I mean on
both sides the river Oby&mdash;whither the Muscovite criminals that
are not put to death are banished, and from whence it is next to
impossible they should ever get away. I have nothing material to
say of my particular affairs till I came to Tobolski, the capital
city of Siberia, where I continued some time on the following
account.</p>

<p>We had now been almost seven months on our journey, and winter
began to come on apace; whereupon my partner and I called a council
about our particular affairs, in which we found it proper, as we
were bound for England, to consider how to dispose of ourselves.
They told us of sledges and reindeer to carry us over the snow in
the winter time, by which means, indeed, the Russians travel more
in winter than they can in summer, as in these sledges they are
able to run night and day: the snow, being frozen, is one universal
covering to nature, by which the hills, vales, rivers, and lakes
are all smooth and hard is a stone, and they run upon the surface,
without any regard to what is underneath.</p>

<p>But I had no occasion to urge a winter journey of this kind. I
was bound to England, not to Moscow, and my route lay two ways:
either I must go on as the caravan went, till I came to Jarislaw,
and then go off west for Narva and the Gulf of Finland, and so on
to Dantzic, where I might possibly sell my China cargo to good
advantage; or I must leave the caravan at a little town on the
Dwina, from whence I had but six days by water to Archangel, and
from thence might be sure of shipping either to England, Holland,
or Hamburg.</p>

<p>Now, to go any one of these journeys in the winter would have
been preposterous; for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would have been
frozen up and I could not get passage; and to go by land in those
countries was far less safe than among the Mogul Tartars; likewise,
as to Archangel in October, all the ships would be gone from
thence, and even the merchants who dwell there in summer retire
south to Moscow in the winter, when the ships are gone; so that I
could have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, with a
scarcity of provisions, and must lie in an empty town all the
winter. Therefore, upon the whole, I thought it much my better way
to let the caravan go, and make provision to winter where I was, at
Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude of about sixty degrees, where
I was sure of three things to wear out a cold winter with, viz.
plenty of provisions, such as the country afforded, a warm house,
with fuel enough, and excellent company.</p>

<p>I was now in quite a different climate from my beloved island,
where I never felt cold, except when I had my ague; on the
contrary, I had much to do to bear any clothes on my back, and
never made any fire but without doors, which was necessary for
dressing my food, &amp;c. Now I had three good vests, with large
robes or gowns over them, to hang down to the feet, and button
close to the wrists; and all these lined with furs, to make them
sufficiently warm. As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly
dislike our way in England of making fires in every room of the
house in open chimneys, which, when the fire is out, always keeps
the air in the room cold as the climate. So I took an apartment in
a good house in the town, and ordered a chimney to be built like a
furnace, in the centre of six several rooms, like a stove; the
funnel to carry the smoke went up one way, the door to come at the
fire went in another, and all the rooms were kept equally warm, but
no fire seen, just as they heat baths in England. By this means we
had always the same climate in all the rooms, and an equal heat was
preserved, and yet we saw no fire, nor were ever incommoded with
smoke.</p>

<p>The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible
to meet with good company here, in a country so barbarous as
this&mdash;one of the most northerly parts of Europe. But this
being the country where the state criminals of Muscovy, as I
observed before, are all banished, the city was full of Russian
noblemen, gentlemen, soldiers, and courtiers. Here was the famous
Prince Galitzin, the old German Robostiski, and several other
persons of note, and some ladies. By means of my Scotch merchant,
whom, nevertheless, I parted with here, I made an acquaintance with
several of these gentlemen; and from these, in the long winter
nights in which I stayed here, I received several very agreeable
visits.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;SAFE ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND</h3>

<p>It was talking one night with a certain prince, one of the
banished ministers of state belonging to the Czar, that the
discourse of my particular case began. He had been telling me
abundance of fine things of the greatness, the magnificence, the
dominions, and the absolute power of the Emperor of the Russians: I
interrupted him, and told him I was a greater and more powerful
prince than ever the Czar was, though my dominion were not so
large, or my people so many. The Russian grandee looked a little
surprised, and, fixing his eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder
what I meant. I said his wonder would cease when I had explained
myself, and told him the story at large of my living in the island;
and then how I managed both myself and the people that were under
me, just as I have since minuted it down. They were exceedingly
taken with the story, and especially the prince, who told me, with
a sigh, that the true greatness of life was to be masters of
ourselves; that he would not have exchanged such a state of life as
mine to be Czar of Muscovy; and that he found more felicity in the
retirement he seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found in
the highest authority he enjoyed in the court of his master the
Czar; that the height of human wisdom was to bring our tempers down
to our circumstances, and to make a calm within, under the weight
of the greatest storms without. When he came first hither, he said,
he used to tear the hair from his head, and the clothes from his
back, as others had done before him; but a little time and
consideration had made him look into himself, as well as round him
to things without; that he found the mind of man, if it was but
once brought to reflect upon the state of universal life, and how
little this world was concerned in its true felicity, was perfectly
capable of making a felicity for itself, fully satisfying to
itself, and suitable to its own best ends and desires, with but
very little assistance from the world. That being now deprived of
all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed in the full exercise of
worldly pleasures, he said he was at leisure to look upon the dark
side of them, where he found all manner of deformity; and was now
convinced that virtue only makes a man truly wise, rich, and great,
and preserves him in the way to a superior happiness in a future
state; and in this, he said, they were more happy in their
banishment than all their enemies were, who had the full possession
of all the wealth and power they had left behind them. "Nor, sir,"
says he, "do I bring my mind to this politically, from the
necessity of my circumstances, which some call miserable; but, if I
know anything of myself, I would not now go back, though the Czar
my master should call me, and reinstate me in all my former
grandeur."</p>

<p>He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much
earnestness and motion of his spirits, that it was evident it was
the true sense of his soul; there was no room to doubt his
sincerity. I told him I once thought myself a kind of monarch in my
old station, of which I had given him an account; but that I
thought he was not only a monarch, but a great conqueror; for he
that had got a victory over his own exorbitant desires, and the
absolute dominion over himself, he whose reason entirely governs
his will, is certainly greater than he that conquers a city.</p>

<p>I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter I
thought it; the cold so intense that I could not so much as look
abroad without being wrapped in furs, and a kind of mask of fur
before my face, with only a hole for breath, and two for sight: the
little daylight we had was for three months not above five hours a
day, and six at most; only that the snow lying on the ground
continually, and the weather being clear, it was never quite dark.
Our horses were kept, or rather starved, underground; and as for
our servants, whom we hired here to look after ourselves and
horses, we had, every now and then, their fingers and toes to thaw
and take care of, lest they should mortify and fall off.</p>

<p>It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being close,
the walls thick, the windows small, and the glass all double. Our
food was chiefly the flesh of deer, dried and cured in the season;
bread good enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish of several
sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of buffaloes, which is pretty
good meat. All the stores of provisions for the winter are laid up
in the summer, and well cured: our drink was water, mixed with aqua
vitae instead of brandy; and for a treat, mead instead of wine,
which, however, they have very good. The hunters, who venture
abroad all weathers, frequently brought us in fine venison, and
sometimes bear's flesh, but we did not much care for the last. We
had a good stock of tea, with which we treated our friends, and we
lived cheerfully and well, all things considered.</p>

<p>It was now March, the days grown considerably longer, and the
weather at least tolerable; so the other travellers began to
prepare sledges to carry them over the snow, and to get things
ready to be going; but my measures being fixed, as I have said, for
Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no motion;
knowing very well that the ships from the south do not set out for
that part of the world till May or June, and that if I was there by
the beginning of August, it would be as soon as any ships would be
ready to sail. Therefore I made no haste to be gone, as others did:
in a word, I saw a great many people, nay, all the travellers, go
away before me. It seems every year they go from thence to Muscovy,
for trade, to carry furs, and buy necessaries, which they bring
back with them to furnish their shops: also others went on the same
errand to Archangel.</p>

<p>In the month of May I began to make all ready to pack up; and,
as I was doing this, it occurred to me that, seeing all these
people were banished by the Czar to Siberia, and yet, when they
came there, were left at liberty to go whither they would, why they
did not then go away to any part of the world, wherever they
thought fit: and I began to examine what should hinder them from
making such an attempt. But my wonder was over when I entered upon
that subject with the person I have mentioned, who answered me
thus: "Consider, first, sir," said he, "the place where we are;
and, secondly, the condition we are in; especially the generality
of the people who are banished thither. We are surrounded with
stronger things than bars or bolts; on the north side, an
unnavigable ocean, where ship never sailed, and boat never swam;
every other way we have above a thousand miles to pass through the
Czar's own dominion, and by ways utterly impassable, except by the
roads made by the government, and through the towns garrisoned by
his troops; in short, we could neither pass undiscovered by the
road, nor subsist any other way, so that it is in vain to attempt
it."</p>

<p>I was silenced at once, and found that they were in a prison
every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the castle at
Moscow: however, it came into my thoughts that I might certainly be
made an instrument to procure the escape of this excellent person;
and that, whatever hazard I ran, I would certainly try if I could
carry him off. Upon this, I took an occasion one evening to tell
him my thoughts. I represented to him that it was very easy for me
to carry him away, there being no guard over him in the country;
and as I was not going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went
in the retinue of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in
the stationary towns in the desert, but could encamp every night
where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to Archangel,
where I would immediately secure him on board an English ship, and
carry him safe along with me; and as to his subsistence and other
particulars, it should be my care till he could better supply
himself.</p>

<p>He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me all the
while I spoke; nay, I could see in his very face that what I said
put his spirits into an exceeding ferment; his colour frequently
changed, his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, till it
might be even perceived in his countenance; nor could he
immediately answer me when I had done, and, as it were, hesitated
what he would say to it; but after he had paused a little, he
embraced me, and said, "How unhappy are we, unguarded creatures as
we are, that even our greatest acts of friendship are made snares
unto us, and we are made tempters of one another!" He then heartily
thanked me for my offers of service, but withstood resolutely the
arguments I used to urge him to set himself free. He declared, in
earnest terms, that he was fully bent on remaining where he was
rather than seek to return to his former miserable greatness, as he
called it: where the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury
might revive, take root, and again overwhelm him. "Let me remain,
dear sir," he said, in conclusion&mdash;"let me remain in this
blessed confinement, banished from the crimes of life, rather than
purchase a show of freedom at the expense of the liberty of my
reason, and at the future happiness which I now have in my view,
but should then, I fear, quickly lose sight of; for I am but flesh;
a man, a mere man; and have passions and affections as likely to
possess and overthrow me as any man: Oh, be not my friend and
tempter both together!"</p>

<p>If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood
silent, looking at him, and, indeed, admiring what I saw. The
struggle in his soul was so great that, though the weather was
extremely cold, it put him into a most violent heat; so I said a
word or two, that I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on
him again, and then I withdrew to my own apartment.</p>

<p>About two hours after I heard somebody at or near the door of my
room, and I was going to open the door, but he had opened it and
come in. "My dear friend," says he, "you had almost overset me, but
I am recovered. Do not take it ill that I do not close with your
offer. I assure you it is not for want of sense of the kindness of
it in you; and I came to make the most sincere acknowledgment of it
to you; but I hope I have got the victory over myself."&mdash;"My
lord," said I, "I hope you are fully satisfied that you do not
resist the call of Heaven."&mdash;"Sir," said he, "if it had been
from Heaven, the same power would have influenced me to have
accepted it; but I hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from
Heaven that I decline it, and I have infinite satisfaction in the
parting, that you shall leave me an honest man still, though not a
free man."</p>

<p>I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make professions to
him of my having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve him. He
embraced me very passionately, and assured me he was sensible of
that, and should always acknowledge it; and with that he offered me
a very fine present of sables&mdash;too much, indeed, for me to
accept from a man in his circumstances, and I would have avoided
them, but he would not be refused. The next morning I sent my
servant to his lordship with a small present of tea, and two pieces
of China damask, and four little wedges of Japan gold, which did
not all weigh above six ounces or thereabouts, but were far short
of the value of his sables, which, when I came to England, I found
worth near two hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and one piece
of the damask, and one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine
stamp upon it, of the Japan coinage, which I found he took for the
rarity of it, but would not take any more: and he sent word by my
servant that he desired to speak with me.</p>

<p>When I came to him he told me I knew what had passed between us,
and hoped I would not move him any more in that affair; but that,
since I had made such a generous offer to him, he asked me if I had
kindness enough to offer the same to another person that he would
name to me, in whom he had a great share of concern. In a word, he
told me it was his only son; who, though I had not seen him, was in
the same condition with himself, and above two hundred miles from
him, on the other side of the Oby; but that, if I consented, he
would send for him.</p>

<p>I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I made some
ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on his
account; and that, seeing I could not prevail on him, I would show
my respect to him by my concern for his son. He sent the next day
for his son; and in about twenty days he came back with the
messenger, bringing six or seven horses, loaded with very rich
furs, which, in the whole, amounted to a very great value. His
servants brought the horses into the town, but left the young lord
at a distance till night, when he came incognito into our
apartment, and his father presented him to me; and, in short, we
concerted the manner of our travelling, and everything proper for
the journey.</p>

<p>I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black fox-skins,
fine ermines, and such other furs as are very rich in that city, in
exchange for some of the goods I had brought from China; in
particular for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest
part here, and the rest afterwards at Archangel, for a much better
price than I could have got at London; and my partner, who was
sensible of the profit, and whose business, more particularly than
mine, was merchandise, was mightily pleased with our stay, on
account of the traffic we made here.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place. We
were now reduced to a very small caravan, having only thirty-two
horses and camels in all, which passed for mine, though my new
guest was proprietor of eleven of them. It was natural also that I
should take more servants with me than I had before; and the young
lord passed for my steward; what great man I passed for myself I
know not, neither did it concern me to inquire. We had here the
worst and the largest desert to pass over that we met with in our
whole journey; I call it the worst, because the way was very deep
in some places, and very uneven in others; the best we had to say
for it was, that we thought we had no troops of Tartars or robbers
to fear, as they never came on this side of the river Oby, or at
least very seldom; but we found it otherwise.</p>

<p>My young lord had a faithful Siberian servant, who was perfectly
acquainted with the country, and led us by private roads, so that
we avoided coming into the principal towns and cities upon the
great road, such as Tumen, Soloy Kamaskoy, and several others;
because the Muscovite garrisons which are kept there are very
curious and strict in their observation upon travellers, and
searching lest any of the banished persons of note should make
their escape that way into Muscovy; but, by this means, as we were
kept out of the cities, so our whole journey was a desert, and we
were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, when we might have had
very good accommodation in the cities on the way; this the young
lord was so sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad
when we came to several cities on the way, but lay abroad himself,
with his servant, in the woods, and met us always at the appointed
places.</p>

<p>We had just entered Europe, having passed the river Kama, which
in these parts is the boundary between Europe and Asia, and the
first city on the European side was called Soloy Kamaskoy, that is,
the great city on the river Kama. And here we thought to see some
evident alteration in the people; but we were mistaken, for as we
had a vast desert to pass, which is near seven hundred miles long
in some places, but not above two hundred miles over where we
passed it, so, till we came past that horrible place, we found very
little difference between that country and Mogul Tartary. The
people are mostly pagans; their houses and towns full of idols; and
their way of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities and
villages near them, where they are Christians, as they call
themselves, of the Greek Church: but have their religion mingled
with so many relics of superstition, that it is scarce to be known
in some places from mere sorcery and witchcraft.</p>

<p>In passing this forest (after all our dangers were, to our
imagination, escaped), I thought, indeed, we must have been
plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered, by a troop of thieves:
of what country they were I am yet at a loss to know; but they were
all on horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were at first about
forty-five in number. They came so near to us as to be within two
musket-shot, and, asking no questions, surrounded us with their
horses, and looked very earnestly upon us twice; at length, they
placed themselves just in our way; upon which we drew up in a
little line, before our camels, being not above sixteen men in all.
Thus drawn up, we halted, and sent out the Siberian servant, who
attended his lord, to see who they were; his master was the more
willing to let him go, because he was not a little apprehensive
that they were a Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came up
near them with a flag of truce, and called to them; but though he
spoke several of their languages, or dialects of languages rather,
he could not understand a word they said; however, after some signs
to him not to come near them at his peril, the fellow came back no
wiser than he went; only that by their dress, he said, he believed
them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hordes,
and that there must be more of them upon the great desert, though
he never heard that any of them were seen so far north before.</p>

<p>This was small comfort to us; however, we had no remedy: there
was on our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile distance, a
little grove, and very near the road. I immediately resolved we
should advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we
could there; for, first, I considered that the trees would in a
great measure cover us from their arrows; and, in the next place,
they could not come to charge us in a body: it was, indeed, my old
Portuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had this excellency
attending him, that he was always readiest and most apt to direct
and encourage us in cases of the most danger. We advanced
immediately, with what speed we could, and gained that little wood;
the Tartars, or thieves, for we knew not what to call them, keeping
their stand, and not attempting to hinder us. When we came thither,
we found, to our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy piece of
ground, and on the one side a very great spring of water, which,
running out in a little brook, was a little farther joined by
another of the like size; and was, in short, the source of a
considerable river, called afterwards the Wirtska; the trees which
grew about this spring were not above two hundred, but very large,
and stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we got in, we saw
ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy unless they attacked us on
foot.</p>

<p>While we stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy some hours,
without perceiving that they made any movement, our Portuguese,
with some help, cut several arms of trees half off, and laid them
hanging across from one tree to another, and in a manner fenced us
in. About two hours before night they came down directly upon us;
and though we had not perceived it, we found they had been joined
by some more, so that they were near fourscore horse; whereof,
however, we fancied some were women. They came on till they were
within half-shot of our little wood, when we fired one musket
without ball, and called to them in the Russian tongue to know what
they wanted, and bade them keep off; but they came on with a double
fury up to the wood-side, not imagining we were so barricaded that
they could not easily break in. Our old pilot was our captain as
well as our engineer, and desired us not to fire upon them till
they came within pistol-shot, that we might be sure to kill, and
that when we did fire we should be sure to take good aim; we bade
him give the word of command, which he delayed so long that they
were some of them within two pikes' length of us when we let fly.
We aimed so true that we killed fourteen of them, and wounded
several others, as also several of their horses; for we had all of
us loaded our pieces with two or three bullets apiece at least.</p>

<p>They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated
immediately about one hundred rods from us; in which time we loaded
our pieces again, and seeing them keep that distance, we sallied
out, and caught four or five of their horses, whose riders we
supposed were killed; and coming up to the dead, we judged they
were Tartars, but knew not how they came to make an excursion such
an unusual length.</p>

<p>About an hour after they again made a motion to attack us, and
rode round our little wood to see where they might break in; but
finding us always ready to face them, they went off again; and we
resolved not to stir for that night.</p>

<p>We slept little, but spent the most part of the night in
strengthening our situation, and barricading the entrances into the
wood, and keeping a strict watch. We waited for daylight, and when
it came, it gave us a very unwelcome discovery indeed; for the
enemy, who we thought were discouraged with the reception they met
with, were now greatly increased, and had set up eleven or twelve
huts or tents, as if they were resolved to besiege us; and this
little camp they had pitched upon the open plain, about
three-quarters of a mile from us. I confess I now gave myself over
for lost, and all that I had; the loss of my effects did not lie so
near me, though very considerable, as the thoughts of falling into
the hands of such barbarians at the latter end of my journey, after
so many difficulties and hazards as I had gone through, and even in
sight of our port, where we expected safety and deliverance. As to
my partner, he was raging, and declared that to lose his goods
would be his ruin, and that he would rather die than be starved,
and he was for fighting to the last drop.</p>

<p>The young lord, a most gallant youth, was for fighting to the
last also; and my old pilot was of opinion that we were able to
resist them all in the situation we were then in. Thus we spent the
day in debates of what we should do; but towards evening we found
that the number of our enemies still increased, and we did not know
but by the morning they might still be a greater number: so I began
to inquire of those people we had brought from Tobolski if there
were no private ways by which we might avoid them in the night, and
perhaps retreat to some town, or get help to guard us over the
desert. The young lord's Siberian servant told us, if we designed
to avoid them, and not fight, he would engage to carry us off in
the night, to a way that went north, towards the river Petruz, by
which he made no question but we might get away, and the Tartars
never discover it; but, he said, his lord had told him he would not
retreat, but would rather choose to fight. I told him he mistook
his lord: for that he was too wise a man to love fighting for the
sake of it; that I knew he was brave enough by what he had showed
already; but that he knew better than to desire seventeen or
eighteen men to fight five hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity
forced them to it; and that if he thought it possible for us to
escape in the night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt it.
He answered, if his lordship gave him such orders, he would lose
his life if he did not perform it; we soon brought his lord to give
that order, though privately, and we immediately prepared for
putting it in practice.</p>

<p>And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a fire in
our little camp, which we kept burning, and prepared so as to make
it burn all night, that the Tartars might conclude we were still
there; but as soon as it was dark, and we could see the stars (for
our guide would not stir before), having all our horses and camels
ready loaded, we followed our new guide, who I soon found steered
himself by the north star, the country being level for a long
way.</p>

<p>After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began to be
lighter still; not that it was dark all night, but the moon began
to rise, so that, in short, it was rather lighter than we wished it
to be; but by six o'clock the next morning we had got above thirty
miles, having almost spoiled our horses. Here we found a Russian
village, named Kermazinskoy, where we rested, and heard nothing of
the Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two hours before night we set
out again, and travelled till eight the next morning, though not
quite so hard as before; and about seven o'clock we passed a little
river, called Kirtza, and came to a good large town inhabited by
Russians, called Ozomys; there we heard that several troops of
Kalmucks had been abroad upon the desert, but that we were now
completely out of danger of them, which was to our great
satisfaction. Here we were obliged to get some fresh horses, and
having need enough of rest, we stayed five days; and my partner and
I agreed to give the honest Siberian who conducted us thither the
value of ten pistoles.</p>

<p>In five days more we came to Veussima, upon the river Witzogda,
and running into the Dwina: we were there, very happily, near the
end of our travels by land, that river being navigable, in seven
days' passage, to Archangel. From hence we came to Lawremskoy, the
3rd of July; and providing ourselves with two luggage boats, and a
barge for our own convenience, we embarked the 7th, and arrived all
safe at Archangel the 18th; having been a year, five months, and
three days on the journey, including our stay of about eight months
at Tobolski.</p>

<p>We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival
of the ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Hamburgher
come in above a month sooner than any of the English ships; when,
after some consideration that the city of Hamburgh might happen to
be as good a market for our goods as London, we all took freight
with him; and, having put our goods on board, it was most natural
for me to put my steward on board to take care of them; by which
means my young lord had a sufficient opportunity to conceal
himself, never coming on shore again all the time we stayed there;
and this he did that he might not be seen in the city, where some
of the Moscow merchants would certainly have seen and discovered
him.</p>

<p>We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the same
year; and, after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived safe in the
Elbe the 18th of September. Here my partner and I found a very good
sale for our goods, as well those of China as the sables, &amp;c.,
of Siberia: and, dividing the produce, my share amounted to 3475
pounds, 17s 3d., including about six hundred pounds' worth of
diamonds, which I purchased at Bengal.</p>

<p>Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up the Elbe,
in order to go to the court of Vienna, where he resolved to seek
protection and could correspond with those of his father's friends
who were left alive. He did not part without testimonials of
gratitude for the service I had done him, and for my kindness to
the prince, his father.</p>

<p>To conclude: having stayed near four months in Hamburgh, I came
from thence by land to the Hague, where I embarked in the packet,
and arrived in London the 10th of January 1705, having been absent
from England ten years and nine months. And here, resolving to
harass myself no more, I am preparing for a longer journey than all
these, having lived seventy-two years a life of infinite variety,
and learned sufficiently to know the value of retirement, and the
blessing of ending our days in peace.</p>
