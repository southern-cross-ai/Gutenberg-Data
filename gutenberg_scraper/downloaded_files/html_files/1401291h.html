  <h2><a id="part1"
     name="part1">PART THE FIRST</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap01"
     name="chap01"></a>I. &mdash; &ldquo;THE RELIGION OF NUMA&rdquo;</h2>

  <p class="first">[3] AS, in the triumph of Christianity, the old religion
  lingered latest in the country, and died out at last as but
  paganism&mdash;the religion of the villagers, before the advance of the
  Christian Church; so, in an earlier century, it was in places remote from
  town-life that the older and purer forms of paganism itself had survived the
  longest. While, in Rome, new religions had arisen with bewildering complexity
  around the dying old one, the earlier and simpler patriarchal religion,
  &ldquo;the religion of Numa,&rdquo; as people loved to fancy, lingered on
  with little change amid the pastoral life, out of the habits and sentiment of
  which so much of it had grown. Glimpses of such a survival we may catch below
  the merely artificial attitudes of Latin pastoral poetry; in Tibullus
  especially, who has preserved for us many poetic details of old Roman
  religious usage.</p>

  <p class="poem">At mihi contingat patrios celebrare Penates,<br>
  Reddereque antiquo menstrua thura Lari:</p>

  <p>[4]&mdash;he prays, with unaffected seriousness. Something liturgical,
  with repetitions of a consecrated form of words, is traceable in one of his
  elegies, as part of the order of a birthday sacrifice. The hearth, from a
  spark of which, as one form of old legend related, the child Romulus had been
  miraculously born, was still indeed an altar; and the worthiest sacrifice to
  the gods the perfect physical sanity of the young men and women, which the
  scrupulous ways of that religion of the hearth had tended to maintain. A
  religion of usages and sentiment rather than of facts and belief, and
  attached to very definite things and places&mdash;the oak of immemorial age,
  the rock on the heath fashioned by weather as if by some dim human art, the
  shadowy grove of ilex, passing into which one exclaimed involuntarily, in
  consecrated phrase, Deity is in this Place! Numen Inest!&mdash;it was in
  natural harmony with the temper of a quiet people amid the spectacle of rural
  life, like that simpler faith between man and man, which Tibullus expressly
  connects with the period when, with an inexpensive worship, the old wooden
  gods had been still pressed for room in their homely little shrines.</p>

  <p>And about the time when the dying Antoninus Pius ordered his golden image
  of Fortune to be carried into the chamber of his successor (now about to test
  the truth of the old Platonic contention, that the world would at last find
  itself [5] happy, could it detach some reluctant philosophic student from the
  more desirable life of celestial contemplation, and compel him to rule it),
  there was a boy living in an old country-house, half farm, half villa, who,
  for himself, recruited that body of antique traditions by a spontaneous force
  of religious veneration such as had originally called them into being. More
  than a century and a half had past since Tibullus had written; but the
  restoration of religious usages, and their retention where they still
  survived, was meantime come to be the fashion through the influence of
  imperial example; and what had been in the main a matter of family pride with
  his father, was sustained by a native instinct of devotion in the young
  Marius. A sense of conscious powers external to ourselves, pleased or
  displeased by the right or wrong conduct of every circumstance of daily
  life&mdash;that conscience, of which the old Roman religion was a formal,
  habitual recognition, was become in him a powerful current of feeling and
  observance. The old-fashioned, partly puritanic awe, the power of which
  Wordsworth noted and valued so highly in a northern peasantry, had its
  counterpart in the feeling of the Roman lad, as he passed the spot,
  &ldquo;touched of heaven,&rdquo; where the lightning had struck dead an aged
  labourer in the field: an upright stone, still with mouldering garlands about
  it, marked the place. He brought to that system of symbolic [6] usages, and
  they in turn developed in him further, a great seriousness&mdash;an
  impressibility to the sacredness of time, of life and its events, and the
  circumstances of family fellowship; of such gifts to men as fire, water, the
  earth, from labour on which they live, really understood by him as
  gifts&mdash;a sense of religious responsibility in the reception of them. It
  was a religion for the most part of fear, of multitudinous scruples, of a
  year-long burden of forms; yet rarely (on clear summer mornings, for
  instance) the thought of those heavenly powers afforded a welcome channel for
  the almost stifling sense of health and delight in him, and relieved it as
  gratitude to the gods.</p>

  <p>The day of the &ldquo;little&rdquo; or private Ambarvalia was come, to be
  celebrated by a single family for the welfare of all belonging to it, as the
  great college of the Arval Brothers officiated at Rome in the interest of the
  whole state. At the appointed time all work ceases; the instruments of labour
  lie untouched, hung with wreaths of flowers, while masters and servants
  together go in solemn procession along the dry paths of vineyard and
  cornfield, conducting the victims whose blood is presently to be shed for the
  purification from all natural or supernatural taint of the lands they have
  &ldquo;gone about.&rdquo; The old Latin words of the liturgy, to be said as
  the procession moved on its way, though their precise meaning was long [7]
  since become unintelligible, were recited from an ancient illuminated roll,
  kept in the painted chest in the hall, together with the family records.
  Early on that day the girls of the farm had been busy in the great portico,
  filling large baskets with flowers plucked short from branches of apple and
  cherry, then in spacious bloom, to strew before the quaint images of the
  gods&mdash;Ceres and Bacchus and the yet more mysterious Dea Dia&mdash;as
  they passed through the fields, carried in their little houses on the
  shoulders of white-clad youths, who were understood to proceed to this office
  in perfect temperance, as pure in soul and body as the air they breathed in
  the firm weather of that early summer-time. The clean lustral water and the
  full incense-box were carried after them. The altars were gay with garlands
  of wool and the more sumptuous sort of blossom and green herbs to be thrown
  into the sacrificial fire, fresh-gathered this morning from a particular plot
  in the old garden, set apart for the purpose. Just then the young leaves were
  almost as fragrant as flowers, and the scent of the bean-fields mingled
  pleasantly with the cloud of incense. But for the monotonous intonation of
  the liturgy by the priests, clad in their strange, stiff, antique vestments,
  and bearing ears of green corn upon their heads, secured by flowing bands of
  white, the procession moved in absolute stillness, all persons, even the
  children, abstaining from [8] speech after the utterance of the pontifical
  formula, Favete linguis!&mdash;Silence! Propitious Silence!&mdash;lest any
  words save those proper to the occasion should hinder the religious efficacy
  of the rite.</p>

  <p>With the lad Marius, who, as the head of his house, took a leading part in
  the ceremonies of the day, there was a devout effort to complete this
  impressive outward silence by that inward tacitness of mind, esteemed so
  important by religious Romans in the performance of these sacred functions.
  To him the sustained stillness without seemed really but to be waiting upon
  that interior, mental condition of preparation or expectancy, for which he
  was just then intently striving. The persons about him, certainly, had never
  been challenged by those prayers and ceremonies to any ponderings on the
  divine nature: they conceived them rather to be the appointed means of
  setting such troublesome movements at rest. By them, &ldquo;the religion of
  Numa,&rdquo; so staid, ideal and comely, the object of so much jealous
  conservatism, though of direct service as lending sanction to a sort of high
  scrupulosity, especially in the chief points of domestic conduct, was mainly
  prized as being, through its hereditary character, something like a personal
  distinction&mdash;as contributing, among the other accessories of an ancient
  house, to the production of that aristocratic atmosphere which separated them
  from newly-made people. But [9] in the young Marius, the very absence from
  those venerable usages of all definite history and dogmatic interpretation,
  had already awakened much speculative activity; and to-day, starting from the
  actual details of the divine service, some very lively surmises, though
  scarcely distinct enough to be thoughts, were moving backwards and forwards
  in his mind, as the stirring wind had done all day among the trees, and were
  like the passing of some mysterious influence over all the elements of his
  nature and experience. One thing only distracted him&mdash;a certain pity at
  the bottom of his heart, and almost on his lips, for the sacrificial victims
  and their looks of terror, rising almost to disgust at the central act of the
  sacrifice itself, a piece of everyday butcher&rsquo;s work, such as we
  decorously hide out of sight; though some then present certainly displayed a
  frank curiosity in the spectacle thus permitted them on a religious pretext.
  The old sculptors of the great procession on the frieze of the Parthenon at
  Athens, have delineated the placid heads of the victims led in it to
  sacrifice, with a perfect feeling for animals in forcible contrast with any
  indifference as to their sufferings. It was this contrast that distracted
  Marius now in the blessing of his fields, and qualified his devout absorption
  upon the scrupulous fulfilment of all the details of the ceremonial, as the
  procession approached the altars.</p>

  <p>[10] The names of that great populace of &ldquo;little gods,&rdquo; dear
  to the Roman home, which the pontiffs had placed on the sacred list of the
  Indigitamenta, to be invoked, because they can help, on special occasions,
  were not forgotten in the long litany&mdash;Vatican who causes the infant to
  utter his first cry, Fabulinus who prompts his first word, Cuba who keeps him
  quiet in his cot, Domiduca especially, for whom Marius had through life a
  particular memory and devotion, the goddess who watches over one&rsquo;s safe
  coming home. The urns of the dead in the family chapel received their due
  service. They also were now become something divine, a goodly company of
  friendly and protecting spirits, encamped about the place of their former
  abode&mdash;above all others, the father, dead ten years before, of whom,
  remembering but a tall, grave figure above him in early childhood, Marius
  habitually thought as a genius a little cold and severe.</p>

  <p class="poem">Candidus insuetum miratur limen Olympi,<br>
  Sub pedibusque videt nubes et sidera.&mdash;</p>

  <p>Perhaps!&mdash;but certainly needs his altar here below, and garlands
  to-day upon his urn. But the dead genii were satisfied with little&mdash;a
  few violets, a cake dipped in wine, or a morsel of honeycomb. Daily, from the
  time when his childish footsteps were still uncertain, had Marius taken them
  their portion of the family meal, at the second course, amidst the silence
  [11] of the company. They loved those who brought them their sustenance; but,
  deprived of these services, would be heard wandering through the house,
  crying sorrowfully in the stillness of the night.</p>

  <p>And those simple gifts, like other objects as trivial&mdash;bread, oil,
  wine, milk&mdash;had regained for him, by their use in such religious
  service, that poetic and as it were moral significance, which surely belongs
  to all the means of daily life, could we but break through the veil of our
  familiarity with things by no means vulgar in themselves. A hymn followed,
  while the whole assembly stood with veiled faces. The fire rose up readily
  from the altars, in clean, bright flame&mdash;a favourable omen, making it a
  duty to render the mirth of the evening complete. Old wine was poured out
  freely for the servants at supper in the great kitchen, where they had worked
  in the imperfect light through the long evenings of winter. The young Marius
  himself took but a very sober part in the noisy feasting. A devout, regretful
  after-taste of what had been really beautiful in the ritual he had
  accomplished took him early away, that he might the better recall in reverie
  all the circumstances of the celebration of the day. As he sank into a sleep,
  pleasant with all the influences of long hours in the open air, he seemed
  still to be moving in procession through the fields, with a kind of
  pleasurable awe. That feeling was still upon him as he [12] awoke amid the
  beating of violent rain on the shutters, in the first storm of the season.
  The thunder which startled him from sleep seemed to make the solitude of his
  chamber almost painfully complete, as if the nearness of those angry clouds
  shut him up in a close place alone in the world. Then he thought of the sort
  of protection which that day&rsquo;s ceremonies assured. To procure an
  agreement with the gods&mdash;Pacem deorum exposcere: that was the meaning of
  what they had all day been busy upon. In a faith, sincere but
  half-suspicious, he would fain have those Powers at least not against him.
  His own nearer household gods were all around his bed. The spell of his
  religion as a part of the very essence of home, its intimacy, its dignity and
  security, was forcible at that moment; only, it seemed to involve certain
  heavy demands upon him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap02"
     name="chap02"></a>II. &mdash; WHITE-NIGHTS</h2>

  <p class="first">[13] TO an instinctive seriousness, the material abode in
  which the childhood of Marius was passed had largely added. Nothing, you
  felt, as you first caught sight of that coy, retired place,&mdash;surely
  nothing could happen there, without its full accompaniment of thought or
  reverie. White- nights! so you might interpret its old Latin name (<i>ad
  vigilias albas</i>). &ldquo;The red rose came first,&rdquo; says a quaint
  German mystic, speaking of &ldquo;the mystery of so- called white
  things,&rdquo; as being &ldquo;ever an after-thought&mdash;the doubles, or
  seconds, of real things, and themselves but half-real,
  half-material&mdash;the white queen, the white witch, the white mass, which,
  as the black mass is a travesty of the true mass turned to evil by horrible
  old witches, is celebrated by young candidates for the priesthood with an
  unconsecrated host, by way of rehearsal.&rdquo; So, white-nights, I suppose,
  after something like the same analogy, should be [14] nights not of quite
  blank forgetfulness, but passed in continuous dreaming, only half veiled by
  sleep. Certainly the place was, in such case, true to its fanciful name in
  this, that you might very well conceive, in face of it, that dreaming even in
  the daytime might come to much there.</p>

  <p>The young Marius represented an ancient family whose estate had come down
  to him much curtailed through the extravagance of a certain Marcellus two
  generations before, a favourite in his day of the fashionable world at Rome,
  where he had at least spent his substance with a correctness of taste Marius
  might seem to have inherited from him; as he was believed also to resemble
  him in a singularly pleasant smile, consistent however, in the younger face,
  with some degree of sombre expression when the mind within was but slightly
  moved.</p>

  <p>As the means of life decreased, the farm had crept nearer and nearer to
  the dwelling-house, about which there was therefore a trace of workday
  negligence or homeliness, not without its picturesque charm for some, for the
  young master himself among them. The more observant passer-by would note,
  curious as to the inmates, a certain amount of dainty care amid that neglect,
  as if it came in part, perhaps, from a reluctance to disturb old
  associations. It was significant of the national character, that a sort of
  elegant gentleman farming, as we say, had been much affected by some of the
  most cultivated [15] Romans. But it became something more than an elegant
  diversion, something of a serious business, with the household of Marius; and
  his actual interest in the cultivation of the earth and the care of flocks
  had brought him, at least, intimately near to those elementary conditions of
  life, a reverence for which, the great Roman poet, as he has shown by his own
  half-mystic pre-occupation with them, held to be the ground of primitive
  Roman religion, as of primitive morals. But then, farm-life in Italy,
  including the culture of the olive and the vine, has a grace of its own, and
  might well contribute to the production of an ideal dignity of character,
  like that of nature itself in this gifted region. Vulgarity seemed
  impossible. The place, though impoverished, was still deservedly dear, full
  of venerable memories, and with a living sweetness of its own for to-day.</p>

  <p>To hold by such ceremonial traditions had been a part of the struggling
  family pride of the lad&rsquo;s father, to which the example of the head of
  the state, old Antoninus Pius&mdash;an example to be still further enforced
  by his successor&mdash;had given a fresh though perhaps somewhat artificial
  popularity. It had been consistent with many another homely and old-fashioned
  trait in him, not to undervalue the charm of exclusiveness and immemorial
  authority, which membership in a local priestly college, hereditary in his
  house, conferred upon him. To set a real value on [16] these things was but
  one element in that pious concern for his home and all that belonged to it,
  which, as Marius afterwards discovered, had been a strong motive with his
  father. The ancient hymn&mdash;Fana Novella!&mdash;was still sung by his
  people, as the new moon grew bright in the west, and even their wild custom
  of leaping through heaps of blazing straw on a certain night in summer was
  not discouraged. The privilege of augury itself, according to tradition, had
  at one time belonged to his race; and if you can imagine how, once in a way,
  an impressible boy might have an inkling, an inward mystic intimation, of the
  meaning and consequences of all that, what was implied in it becoming
  explicit for him, you conceive aright the mind of Marius, in whose house the
  auspices were still carefully consulted before every undertaking of
  moment.</p>

  <p>The devotion of the father then had handed on loyally&mdash;and that is
  all many not unimportant persons ever find to do&mdash;a certain tradition of
  life, which came to mean much for the young Marius. The feeling with which he
  thought of his dead father was almost exclusively that of awe; though crossed
  at times by a not unpleasant sense of liberty, as he could but confess to
  himself, pondering, in the actual absence of so weighty and continual a
  restraint, upon the arbitrary power which Roman religion and Roman law gave
  to the parent over the son. [17] On the part of his mother, on the other
  hand, entertaining the husband&rsquo;s memory, there was a sustained
  freshness of regret, together with the recognition, as Marius fancied, of
  some costly self-sacrifice to be credited to the dead. The life of the widow,
  languid and shadowy enough but for the poignancy of that regret, was like one
  long service to the departed soul; its many annual observances centering
  about the funeral urn&mdash;a tiny, delicately carved marble house, still
  white and fair, in the family-chapel, wreathed always with the richest
  flowers from the garden. To the dead, in fact, was conceded in such places a
  somewhat closer neighbourhood to the old homes they were thought still to
  protect, than is usual with us, or was usual in Rome itself&mdash;a closeness
  which the living welcomed, so diverse are the ways of our human sentiment,
  and in which the more wealthy, at least in the country, might indulge
  themselves. All this Marius followed with a devout interest, sincerely
  touched and awed by his mother&rsquo;s sorrow. After the deification of the
  emperors, we are told, it was considered impious so much as to use any coarse
  expression in the presence of their images. To Marius the whole of life
  seemed full of sacred presences, demanding of him a similar collectedness.
  The severe and archaic religion of the villa, as he conceived it, begot in
  him a sort of devout circumspection lest he should fall short at any point of
  the demand upon him of anything [18] in which deity was concerned. He must
  satisfy with a kind of sacred equity, he must be very cautious lest he be
  found wanting to, the claims of others, in their joys and
  calamities&mdash;the happiness which deity sanctioned, or the blows in which
  it made itself felt. And from habit, this feeling of a responsibility towards
  the world of men and things, towards a claim for due sentiment concerning
  them on his side, came to be a part of his nature not to be put off. It kept
  him serious and dignified amid the Epicurean speculations which in after
  years much engrossed him, and when he had learned to think of all religions
  as indifferent, serious amid many fopperies and through many languid days,
  and made him anticipate all his life long as a thing towards which he must
  carefully train himself, some great occasion of self-devotion, such as really
  came, that should consecrate his life, and, it might be, its memory with
  others, as the early Christian looked forward to martyrdom at the end of his
  course, as a seal of worth upon it.</p>

  <p>The traveller, descending from the slopes of Luna, even as he got his
  first view of the Port-of-Venus, would pause by the way, to read the face, as
  it were, of so beautiful a dwelling-place, lying away from the white road, at
  the point where it began to decline somewhat steeply to the marsh-land below.
  The building of pale red and yellow marble, mellowed by age, which he saw
  beyond the gates, was indeed but the exquisite [19] fragment of a once large
  and sumptuous villa. Two centuries of the play of the sea-wind were in the
  velvet of the mosses which lay along its inaccessible ledges and angles. Here
  and there the marble plates had slipped from their places, where the delicate
  weeds had forced their way. The graceful wildness which prevailed in garden
  and farm gave place to a singular nicety about the actual habitation, and a
  still more scrupulous sweetness and order reigned within. The old Roman
  architects seem to have well understood the decorative value of the
  floor&mdash;the real economy there was, in the production of rich interior
  effect, of a somewhat lavish expenditure upon the surface they trod on. The
  pavement of the hall had lost something of its evenness; but, though a little
  rough to the foot, polished and cared for like a piece of silver, looked, as
  mosaic-work is apt to do, its best in old age. Most noticeable among the
  ancestral masks, each in its little cedarn chest below the cornice, was that
  of the wasteful but elegant Marcellus, with the quaint resemblance in its
  yellow waxen features to Marius, just then so full of animation and country
  colour. A chamber, curved ingeniously into oval form, which he had added to
  the mansion, still contained his collection of works of art; above all, that
  head of Medusa, for which the villa was famous. The spoilers of one of the
  old Greek towns on the coast had flung away or lost the [20] thing, as it
  seemed, in some rapid flight across the river below, from the sands of which
  it was drawn up in a fisherman&rsquo;s net, with the fine golden laminae
  still clinging here and there to the bronze. It was Marcellus also who had
  contrived the prospect-tower of two storeys with the white pigeon-house
  above, so characteristic of the place. The little glazed windows in the
  uppermost chamber framed each its dainty landscape&mdash;the pallid crags of
  Carrara, like wildly twisted snow- drifts above the purple heath; the distant
  harbour with its freight of white marble going to sea; the lighthouse temple
  of Venus Speciosa on its dark headland, amid the long-drawn curves of white
  breakers. Even on summer nights the air there had always a motion in it, and
  drove the scent of the new-mown hay along all the passages of the house.</p>

  <p>Something pensive, spell-bound, and but half real, something cloistral or
  monastic, as we should say, united to this exquisite order, made the whole
  place seem to Marius, as it were, sacellum, the peculiar sanctuary, of his
  mother, who, still in real widowhood, provided the deceased Marius the elder
  with that secondary sort of life which we can give to the dead, in our
  intensely realised memory of them&mdash;the &ldquo;subjective
  immortality,&rdquo; to use a modern phrase, for which many a Roman epitaph
  cries out plaintively to widow or sister or daughter, still in the land of
  the living. Certainly, if any [21] such considerations regarding them do
  reach the shadowy people, he enjoyed that secondary existence, that warm
  place still left, in thought at least, beside the living, the desire for
  which is actually, in various forms, so great a motive with most of us. And
  Marius the younger, even thus early, came to think of women&rsquo;s tears, of
  women&rsquo;s hands to lay one to rest, in death as in the sleep of
  childhood, as a sort of natural want. The soft lines of the white hands and
  face, set among the many folds of the veil and stole of the Roman widow, busy
  upon her needlework, or with music sometimes, defined themselves for him as
  the typical expression of maternity. Helping her with her white and purple
  wools, and caring for her musical instruments, he won, as if from the
  handling of such things, an urbane and feminine refinement, qualifying duly
  his country-grown habits&mdash;the sense of a certain delicate blandness,
  which he relished, above all, on returning to the &ldquo;chapel&rdquo; of his
  mother, after long days of open- air exercise, in winter or stormy summer.
  For poetic souls in old Italy felt, hardly less strongly than the English,
  the pleasures of winter, of the hearth, with the very dead warm in its
  generous heat, keeping the young myrtles in flower, though the hail is
  beating hard without. One important principle, of fruit afterwards in his
  Roman life, that relish for the country fixed deeply in him; in the winters
  especially, when the sufferings of [22] the animal world became so palpable
  even to the least observant. It fixed in him a sympathy for all creatures,
  for the almost human troubles and sicknesses of the flocks, for instance. It
  was a feeling which had in it something of religious veneration for life as
  such&mdash;for that mysterious essence which man is powerless to create in
  even the feeblest degree. One by one, at the desire of his mother, the lad
  broke down his cherished traps and springes for the hungry wild birds on the
  salt marsh. A white bird, she told him once, looking at him gravely, a bird
  which he must carry in his bosom across a crowded public place&mdash;his own
  soul was like that! Would it reach the hands of his good genius on the
  opposite side, unruffled and unsoiled? And as his mother became to him the
  very type of maternity in things, its unfailing pity and protectiveness, and
  maternity itself the central type of all love;&mdash;so, that beautiful
  dwelling-place lent the reality of concrete outline to a peculiar ideal of
  home, which throughout the rest of his life he seemed, amid many distractions
  of spirit, to be ever seeking to regain.</p>

  <p>And a certain vague fear of evil, constitutional in him, enhanced still
  further this sentiment of home as a place of tried security. His religion,
  that old Italian religion, in contrast with the really light-hearted religion
  of Greece, had its deep undercurrent of gloom, its sad, haunting imageries,
  not exclusively confined to the walls [23] of Etruscan tombs. The function of
  the conscience, not always as the prompter of gratitude for benefits
  received, but oftenest as his accuser before those angry heavenly masters,
  had a large part in it; and the sense of some unexplored evil, ever dogging
  his footsteps, made him oddly suspicious of particular places and persons.
  Though his liking for animals was so strong, yet one fierce day in early
  summer, as he walked along a narrow road, he had seen the snakes breeding,
  and ever afterwards avoided that place and its ugly associations, for there
  was something in the incident which made food distasteful and his sleep
  uneasy for many days afterwards. The memory of it however had almost passed
  away, when at the corner of a street in Pisa, he came upon an African showman
  exhibiting a great serpent: once more, as the reptile writhed, the former
  painful impression revived: it was like a peep into the lower side of the
  real world, and again for many days took all sweetness from food and sleep.
  He wondered at himself indeed, trying to puzzle out the secret of that
  repugnance, having no particular dread of a snake&rsquo;s bite, like one of
  his companions, who had put his hand into the mouth of an old garden-god and
  roused there a sluggish viper. A kind of pity even mingled with his aversion,
  and he could hardly have killed or injured the animals, which seemed already
  to suffer by the very circumstance of their life, being what they [24] were.
  It was something like a fear of the supernatural, or perhaps rather a moral
  feeling, for the face of a great serpent, with no grace of fur or feathers,
  so different from quadruped or bird, has a sort of humanity of aspect in its
  spotted and clouded nakedness. There was a humanity, dusty and sordid and as
  if far gone in corruption, in the sluggish coil, as it awoke suddenly into
  one metallic spring of pure enmity against him. Long afterwards, when it
  happened that at Rome he saw, a second time, a showman with his serpents, he
  remembered the night which had then followed, thinking, in Saint
  Augustine&rsquo;s vein, on the real greatness of those little troubles of
  children, of which older people make light; but with a sudden gratitude also,
  as he reflected how richly possessed his life had actually been by beautiful
  aspects and imageries, seeing how greatly what was repugnant to the eye
  disturbed his peace.</p>

  <p>Thus the boyhood of Marius passed; on the whole, more given to
  contemplation than to action. Less prosperous in fortune than at an earlier
  day there had been reason to expect, and animating his solitude, as he read
  eagerly and intelligently, with the traditions of the past, already he lived
  much in the realm of the imagination, and became betimes, as he was to
  continue all through life, something of an idealist, constructing the world
  for himself in great measure from within, by the exercise [25] of meditative
  power. A vein of subjective philosophy, with the individual for its standard
  of all things, there would be always in his intellectual scheme of the world
  and of conduct, with a certain incapacity wholly to accept other men&rsquo;s
  valuations. And the generation of this peculiar element in his temper he
  could trace up to the days when his life had been so like the reading of a
  romance to him. Had the Romans a word for unworldly? The beautiful word
  umbratilis perhaps comes nearest to it; and, with that precise sense, might
  describe the spirit in which he prepared himself for the sacerdotal function
  hereditary in his family&mdash;the sort of mystic enjoyment he had in the
  abstinence, the strenuous self-control and ascesis, which such preparation
  involved. Like the young Ion in the beautiful opening of the play of
  Euripides, who every morning sweeps the temple floor with such a fund of
  cheerfulness in his service, he was apt to be happy in sacred places, with a
  susceptibility to their peculiar influences which he never outgrew; so that
  often in after-times, quite unexpectedly, this feeling would revive in him
  with undiminished freshness. That first, early, boyish ideal of priesthood,
  the sense of dedication, survived through all the distractions of the world,
  and when all thought of such vocation had finally passed from him, as a
  ministry, in spirit at least, towards a sort of hieratic beauty and order in
  the conduct of life.</p>

  <p>[26] And now what relieved in part this over-tension of soul was the
  lad&rsquo;s pleasure in the country and the open air; above all, the ramble
  to the coast, over the marsh with its dwarf roses and wild lavender, and
  delightful signs, one after another&mdash;the abandoned boat, the ruined
  flood-gates, the flock of wild birds&mdash;that one was approaching the sea;
  the long summer-day of idleness among its vague scents and sounds. And it was
  characteristic of him that he relished especially the grave, subdued,
  northern notes in all that&mdash;the charm of the French or English notes, as
  we might term them&mdash;in the luxuriant Italian landscape.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap03"
     name="chap03"></a>III. &mdash; CHANGE OF AIR</h2>

  <p class="cp"><i>Dilexi decorem domus tuae.</i></p>

  <p class="first">[27] THAT almost morbid religious idealism, and his
  healthful love of the country, were both alike developed by the circumstances
  of a journey, which happened about this time, when Marius was taken to a
  certain temple of Aesculapius, among the hills of Etruria, as was then usual
  in such cases, for the cure of some boyish sickness. The religion of
  Aesculapius, though borrowed from Greece, had been naturalised in Rome in the
  old republican times; but had reached under the Antonines the height of its
  popularity throughout the Roman world. That was an age of valetudinarians, in
  many instances of imaginary ones; but below its various crazes concerning
  health and disease, largely multiplied a few years after the time of which I
  am speaking by the miseries of a great pestilence, lay a valuable, because
  partly practicable, belief that all the maladies of the soul might be reached
  through the subtle gateways of the body.</p>

  <p>[28] Salus, salvation, for the Romans, had come to mean bodily sanity. The
  religion of the god of bodily health, Salvator, as they called him
  absolutely, had a chance just then of becoming the one religion; that mild
  and philanthropic son of Apollo surviving, or absorbing, all other pagan
  godhead. The apparatus of the medical art, the salutary mineral or herb, diet
  or abstinence, and all the varieties of the bath, came to have a kind of
  sacramental character, so deep was the feeling, in more serious minds, of a
  moral or spiritual profit in physical health, beyond the obvious bodily
  advantages one had of it; the body becoming truly, in that case, but a quiet
  handmaid of the soul. The priesthood or &ldquo;family&rdquo; of Aesculapius,
  a vast college, believed to be in possession of certain precious medical
  secrets, came nearest perhaps, of all the institutions of the pagan world, to
  the Christian priesthood; the temples of the god, rich in some instances with
  the accumulated thank-offerings of centuries of a tasteful devotion, being
  really also a kind of hospitals for the sick, administered in a full
  conviction of the religiousness, the refined and sacred happiness, of a life
  spent in the relieving of pain.</p>

  <p>Elements of a really experimental and progressive knowledge there were
  doubtless amid this devout enthusiasm, bent so faithfully on the reception of
  health as a direct gift from God; but for the most part his care was held to
  take [29] effect through a machinery easily capable of misuse for purposes of
  religious fraud. Through dreams, above all, inspired by Aesculapius himself,
  information as to the cause and cure of a malady was supposed to come to the
  sufferer, in a belief based on the truth that dreams do sometimes, for those
  who watch them carefully, give many hints concerning the conditions of the
  body&mdash;those latent weak points at which disease or death may most easily
  break into it. In the time of Marcus Aurelius these medical dreams had become
  more than ever a fashionable caprice. Aristeides, the &ldquo;Orator,&rdquo; a
  man of undoubted intellectual power, has devoted six discourses to their
  interpretation; the really scientific Galen has recorded how beneficently
  they had intervened in his own case, at certain turning-points of life; and a
  belief in them was one of the frailties of the wise emperor himself. Partly
  for the sake of these dreams, living ministers of the god, more likely to
  come to one in his actual dwelling-place than elsewhere, it was almost a
  necessity that the patient should sleep one or more nights within the
  precincts of a temple consecrated to his service, during which time he must
  observe certain rules prescribed by the priests.</p>

  <p>For this purpose, after devoutly saluting the Lares, as was customary
  before starting on a journey, Marius set forth one summer morning on his way
  to the famous temple which lay [30] among the hills beyond the valley of the
  Arnus. It was his greatest adventure hitherto; and he had much pleasure in
  all its details, in spite of his feverishness. Starting early, under the
  guidance of an old serving-man who drove the mules, with his wife who took
  all that was needful for their refreshment on the way and for the offering at
  the shrine, they went, under the genial heat, halting now and then to pluck
  certain flowers seen for the first time on these high places, upwards,
  through a long day of sunshine, while cliffs and woods sank gradually below
  their path. The evening came as they passed along a steep white road with
  many windings among the pines, and it was night when they reached the temple,
  the lights of which shone out upon them pausing before the gates of the
  sacred enclosure, while Marius became alive to a singular purity in the air.
  A rippling of water about the place was the only thing audible, as they
  waited till two priestly figures, speaking Greek to one another, admitted
  them into a large, white-walled and clearly lighted guest-chamber, in which,
  while he partook of a simple but wholesomely prepared supper, Marius still
  seemed to feel pleasantly the height they had attained to among the
  hills.</p>

  <p>The agreeable sense of all this was spoiled by one thing only, his old
  fear of serpents; for it was under the form of a serpent that Aesculapius
  [31] had come to Rome, and the last definite thought of his weary head before
  he fell asleep had been a dread either that the god might appear, as he was
  said sometimes to do, under this hideous aspect, or perhaps one of those
  great sallow-hued snakes themselves, kept in the sacred place, as he had also
  heard was usual.</p>

  <p>And after an hour&rsquo;s feverish dreaming he awoke&mdash;with a cry, it
  would seem, for some one had entered the room bearing a light. The footsteps
  of the youthful figure which approached and sat by his bedside were certainly
  real. Ever afterwards, when the thought arose in his mind of some unhoped-for
  but entire relief from distress, like blue sky in a storm at sea, would come
  back the memory of that gracious countenance which, amid all the kindness of
  its gaze, had yet a certain air of predominance over him, so that he seemed
  now for the first time to have found the master of his spirit. It would have
  been sweet to be the servant of him who now sat beside him speaking.</p>

  <p>He caught a lesson from what was then said, still somewhat beyond his
  years, a lesson in the skilled cultivation of life, of experience, of
  opportunity, which seemed to be the aim of the young priest&rsquo;s
  recommendations. The sum of them, through various forgotten intervals of
  argument, as might really have happened in a [32] dream, was the precept,
  repeated many times under slightly varied aspects, of a diligent promotion of
  the capacity of the eye, inasmuch as in the eye would lie for him the
  determining influence of life: he was of the number of those who, in the
  words of a poet who came long after, must be &ldquo;made perfect by the love
  of visible beauty.&rdquo; The discourse was conceived from the point of view
  of a theory Marius found afterwards in Plato&rsquo;s Phaedrus, which supposes
  men&rsquo;s spirits susceptible to certain influences, diffused, after the
  manner of streams or currents, by fair things or persons visibly
  present&mdash;green fields, for instance, or children&rsquo;s
  faces&mdash;into the air around them, acting, in the case of some peculiar
  natures, like potent material essences, and conforming the seer to themselves
  as with some cunning physical necessity. This theory,* in itself so
  fantastic, had however determined in a range of methodical suggestions,
  altogether quaint here and there from their circumstantial minuteness. And
  throughout, the possibility of some vision, as of a new city coming down
  &ldquo;like a bride out of heaven,&rdquo; a vision still indeed, it might
  seem, a long way off, but to be granted perhaps one day to the eyes thus
  trained, was presented as the motive of this laboriously practical
  direction.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>E aporroe tou kallous</i> (Emanation from a thing
  of beauty).]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If thou wouldst have all about thee like the colours of some fresh
  picture, in a clear [33] light,&rdquo; so the discourse recommenced after a
  pause, &ldquo;be temperate in thy religious notions, in love, in wine, in all
  things, and of a peaceful heart with thy fellows.&rdquo; To keep the eye
  clear by a sort of exquisite personal alacrity and cleanliness, extending
  even to his dwelling-place; to discriminate, ever more and more fastidiously,
  select form and colour in things from what was less select; to meditate much
  on beautiful visible objects, on objects, more especially, connected with the
  period of youth&mdash;on children at play in the morning, the trees in early
  spring, on young animals, on the fashions and amusements of young men; to
  keep ever by him if it were but a single choice flower, a graceful animal or
  sea-shell, as a token and representative of the whole kingdom of such things;
  to avoid jealously, in his way through the world, everything repugnant to
  sight; and, should any circumstance tempt him to a general converse in the
  range of such objects, to disentangle himself from that circumstance at any
  cost of place, money, or opportunity; such were in brief outline the duties
  recognised, the rights demanded, in this new formula of life. And it was
  delivered with conviction; as if the speaker verily saw into the recesses of
  the mental and physical being of the listener, while his own expression of
  perfect temperance had in it a fascinating power&mdash;the merely negative
  element of purity, the mere freedom from taint or flaw, in exercise [34] as a
  positive influence. Long afterwards, when Marius read the
  Charmides&mdash;that other dialogue of Plato, into which he seems to have
  expressed the very genius of old Greek temperance&mdash;the image of this
  speaker came back vividly before him, to take the chief part in the
  conversation.</p>

  <p>It was as a weighty sanction of such temperance, in almost visible
  symbolism (an outward imagery identifying itself with unseen moralities) that
  the memory of that night&rsquo;s double experience, the dream of the great
  sallow snake and the utterance of the young priest, always returned to him,
  and the contrast therein involved made him revolt with unfaltering instinct
  from the bare thought of an excess in sleep, or diet, or even in matters of
  taste, still more from any excess of a coarser kind.</p>

  <p>When he awoke again, still in the exceeding freshness he had felt on his
  arrival, and now in full sunlight, it was as if his sickness had really
  departed with the terror of the night: a confusion had passed from the brain,
  a painful dryness from his hands. Simply to be alive and there was a delight;
  and as he bathed in the fresh water set ready for his use, the air of the
  room about him seemed like pure gold, the very shadows rich with colour.
  Summoned at length by one of the white-robed brethren, he went out to walk in
  the temple garden. At a distance, on either side, his guide pointed out to
  him the Houses of Birth and Death, erected for the reception [35]
  respectively of women about to become mothers, and of persons about to die;
  neither of those incidents being allowed to defile, as was thought, the
  actual precincts of the shrine. His visitor of the previous night he saw
  nowhere again. But among the official ministers of the place there was one,
  already marked as of great celebrity, whom Marius saw often in later days at
  Rome, the physician Galen, now about thirty years old. He was standing, the
  hood partly drawn over his face, beside the holy well, as Marius and his
  guide approached it.</p>

  <p>This famous well or conduit, primary cause of the temple and its
  surrounding institutions, was supplied by the water of a spring flowing
  directly out of the rocky foundations of the shrine. From the rim of its
  basin rose a circle of trim columns to support a cupola of singular lightness
  and grace, itself full of reflected light from the rippling surface, through
  which might be traced the wavy figure-work of the marble lining below as the
  stream of water rushed in. Legend told of a visit of Aesculapius to this
  place, earlier and happier than his first coming to Rome: an inscription
  around the cupola recorded it in letters of gold. &ldquo;Being come unto this
  place the son of God loved it exceedingly:&rdquo;&mdash;Huc profectus filius
  Dei maxime amavit hunc locum;&mdash;and it was then that that most intimately
  human of the gods had given men the well, with all its salutary properties.
  The [36] element itself when received into the mouth, in consequence of its
  entire freedom from adhering organic matter, was more like a draught of
  wonderfully pure air than water; and after tasting, Marius was told many
  mysterious circumstances concerning it, by one and another of the
  bystanders:&mdash;he who drank often thereof might well think he had tasted
  of the Homeric lotus, so great became his desire to remain always on that
  spot: carried to other places, it was almost indefinitely conservative of its
  fine qualities: nay! a few drops of it would amend other water; and it flowed
  not only with unvarying abundance but with a volume so oddly rhythmical that
  the well stood always full to the brim, whatever quantity might be drawn from
  it, seeming to answer with strange alacrity of service to human needs, like a
  true creature and pupil of the philanthropic god. Certainly the little crowd
  around seemed to find singular refreshment in gazing on it. The whole place
  appeared sensibly influenced by the amiable and healthful spirit of the
  thing. All the objects of the country were there at their freshest. In the
  great park-like enclosure for the maintenance of the sacred animals offered
  by the convalescent, grass and trees were allowed to grow with a kind of
  graceful wildness; otherwise, all was wonderfully nice. And that freshness
  seemed to have something moral in its influence, as if it acted upon the body
  and the merely bodily [37] powers of apprehension, through the intelligence;
  and to the end of his visit Marius saw no more serpents.</p>

  <p>A lad was just then drawing water for ritual uses, and Marius followed him
  as he returned from the well, more and more impressed by the religiousness of
  all he saw, on his way through a long cloister or corridor, the walls well-
  nigh hidden under votive inscriptions recording favours from the son of
  Apollo, and with a distant fragrance of incense in the air, explained when he
  turned aside through an open doorway into the temple itself. His heart
  bounded as the refined and dainty magnificence of the place came upon him
  suddenly, in the flood of early sunshine, with the ceremonial lights burning
  here and there, and withal a singular expression of sacred order, a
  surprising cleanliness and simplicity. Certain priests, men whose
  countenances bore a deep impression of cultivated mind, each with his little
  group of assistants, were gliding round silently to perform their morning
  salutation to the god, raising the closed thumb and finger of the right hand
  with a kiss in the air, as they came and went on their sacred business,
  bearing their frankincense and lustral water. Around the walls, at such a
  level that the worshippers might read, as in a book, the story of the god and
  his sons, the brotherhood of the Asclepiadae, ran a series of imageries, in
  low relief, their delicate light and shade being [38] heightened, here and
  there, with gold. Fullest of inspired and sacred expression, as if in this
  place the chisel of the artist had indeed dealt not with marble but with the
  very breath of feeling and thought, was the scene in which the earliest
  generation of the sons of Aesculapius were transformed into healing dreams;
  for &ldquo;grown now too glorious to abide longer among men, by the aid of
  their sire they put away their mortal bodies, and came into another country,
  yet not indeed into Elysium nor into the Islands of the Blest. But being made
  like to the immortal gods, they began to pass about through the world,
  changed thus far from their first form that they appear eternally young, as
  many persons have seen them in many places&mdash;ministers and heralds of
  their father, passing to and fro over the earth, like gliding stars. Which
  thing is, indeed, the most wonderful concerning them!&rdquo; And in this
  scene, as throughout the series, with all its crowded personages, Marius
  noted on the carved faces the same peculiar union of unction, almost of
  hilarity, with a certain self-possession and reserve, which was conspicuous
  in the living ministrants around him.</p>

  <p>In the central space, upon a pillar or pedestal, hung, ex voto, with the
  richest personal ornaments, stood the image of Aesculapius himself,
  surrounded by choice flowering plants. It presented the type, still with
  something of the [39] severity of the earlier art of Greece about it, not of
  an aged and crafty physician, but of a youth, earnest and strong of aspect,
  carrying an ampulla or bottle in one hand, and in the other a
  traveller&rsquo;s staff, a pilgrim among his pilgrim worshippers; and one of
  the ministers explained to Marius this pilgrim guise.&mdash;One chief source
  of the master&rsquo;s knowledge of healing had been observation of the
  remedies resorted to by animals labouring under disease or pain&mdash;what
  leaf or berry the lizard or dormouse lay upon its wounded fellow; to which
  purpose for long years he had led the life of a wanderer, in wild places. The
  boy took his place as the last comer, a little way behind the group of
  worshippers who stood in front of the image. There, with uplifted face, the
  palms of his two hands raised and open before him, and taught by the priest,
  he said his collect of thanksgiving and prayer (Aristeides has recorded it at
  the end of his Asclepiadae) to the Inspired Dreams:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O ye children of Apollo! who in time past have stilled the waves of
  sorrow for many people, lighting up a lamp of safety before those who travel
  by sea and land, be pleased, in your great condescension, though ye be equal
  in glory with your elder brethren the Dioscuri, and your lot in immortal
  youth be as theirs, to accept this prayer, which in sleep and vision ye have
  inspired. Order it aright, I pray you, according to your loving-kindness to
  men. Preserve me [40] from sickness; and endue my body with such a measure of
  health as may suffice it for the obeying of the spirit, that I may pass my
  days unhindered and in quietness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the last morning of his visit Marius entered the shrine again, and just
  before his departure the priest, who had been his special director during his
  stay at the place, lifting a cunningly contrived panel, which formed the back
  of one of the carved seats, bade him look through. What he saw was like the
  vision of a new world, by the opening of some unsuspected window in a
  familiar dwelling-place. He looked out upon a long-drawn valley of singularly
  cheerful aspect, hidden, by the peculiar conformation of the locality, from
  all points of observation but this. In a green meadow at the foot of the
  steep olive-clad rocks below, the novices were taking their exercise. The
  softly sloping sides of the vale lay alike in full sunlight; and its distant
  opening was closed by a beautifully formed mountain, from which the last
  wreaths of morning mist were rising under the heat. It might have seemed the
  very presentment of a land of hope, its hollows brimful of a shadow of blue
  flowers; and lo! on the one level space of the horizon, in a long dark line,
  were towers and a dome: and that was Pisa.&mdash;Or Rome, was it? asked
  Marius, ready to believe the utmost, in his excitement.</p>

  <p>All this served, as he understood afterwards [41] in retrospect, at once
  to strengthen and to purify a certain vein of character in him. Developing
  the ideal, pre-existent there, of a religious beauty, associated for the
  future with the exquisite splendour of the temple of Aesculapius, as it
  dawned upon him on that morning of his first visit&mdash;it developed that
  ideal in connexion with a vivid sense of the value of mental and bodily
  sanity. And this recognition of the beauty, even for the aesthetic sense, of
  mere bodily health, now acquired, operated afterwards as an influence morally
  salutary, counteracting the less desirable or hazardous tendencies of some
  phases of thought, through which he was to pass.</p>

  <p>He came home brown with health to find the health of his mother failing;
  and about her death, which occurred not long afterwards, there was a
  circumstance which rested with him as the cruellest touch of all, in an event
  which for a time seemed to have taken the light out of the sunshine. She died
  away from home, but sent for him at the last, with a painful effort on her
  part, but to his great gratitude, pondering, as he always believed, that he
  might chance otherwise to look back all his life long upon a single fault
  with something like remorse, and find the burden a great one. For it happened
  that, through some sudden, incomprehensible petulance there had been an angry
  childish gesture, and a slighting word, at the very moment of her departure,
  actually for the last time. Remembering this [42] he would ever afterwards
  pray to be saved from offences against his own affections; the thought of
  that marred parting having peculiar bitterness for one, who set so much
  store, both by principle and habit, on the sentiment of home.</p>

     name="chap04"></a>IV. &mdash; THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>O mare! O littus! verum secretumque Mouseion, quam multa
  invenitis, quam multa dictatis!</i>&mdash;Pliny, Letters, Book I, ix<br>
  [O sea! O shore! my own Helicon, how many things have you uncovered to me,
  how many things suggested!]</p>

  <p class="first">[43] IT would hardly have been possible to feel more
  seriously than did Marius in those grave years of his early life. But the
  death of his mother turned seriousness of feeling into a matter of the
  intelligence: it made him a questioner; and, by bringing into full evidence
  to him the force of his affections and the probable importance of their place
  in his future, developed in him generally the more human and earthly elements
  of character. A singularly virile consciousness of the realities of life
  pronounced itself in him; still however as in the main a poetic apprehension,
  though united already with something of personal ambition and the instinct of
  self-assertion. There were days when he could suspect, though it was a
  suspicion he was careful at first to put from him, that that early, much [44]
  cherished religion of the villa might come to count with him as but one form
  of poetic beauty, or of the ideal, in things; as but one voice, in a world
  where there were many voices it would be a moral weakness not to listen to.
  And yet this voice, through its forcible pre-occupation of his childish
  conscience, still seemed to make a claim of a quite exclusive character,
  defining itself as essentially one of but two possible leaders of his spirit,
  the other proposing to him unlimited self- expansion in a world of various
  sunshine. The contrast was so pronounced as to make the easy, light-hearted,
  unsuspecting exercise of himself, among the temptations of the new phase of
  life which had now begun, seem nothing less than a rival religion, a rival
  religious service. The temptations, the various sunshine, were those of the
  old town of Pisa, where Marius was now a tall schoolboy. Pisa was a place
  lying just far enough from home to make his rare visits to it in childhood
  seem like adventures, such as had never failed to supply new and refreshing
  impulses to the imagination. The partly decayed pensive town, which still had
  its commerce by sea, and its fashion at the bathing-season, had lent, at one
  time the vivid memory of its fair streets of marble, at another the solemn
  outline of the dark hills of Luna on its background, at another the living
  glances of its men and women, to the thickly gathering crowd [45] of
  impressions, out of which his notion of the world was then forming. And while
  he learned that the object, the experience, as it will be known to memory, is
  really from first to last the chief point for consideration in the conduct of
  life, these things were feeding also the idealism constitutional with
  him&mdash;his innate and habitual longing for a world altogether fairer than
  that he saw. The child could find his way in thought along those streets of
  the old town, expecting duly the shrines at their corners, and their
  recurrent intervals of garden-courts, or side-views of distant sea. The great
  temple of the place, as he could remember it, on turning back once for a last
  look from an angle of his homeward road, counting its tall gray columns
  between the blue of the bay and the blue fields of blossoming flax beyond;
  the harbour and its lights; the foreign ships lying there; the sailors&rsquo;
  chapel of Venus, and her gilded image, hung with votive gifts; the seamen
  themselves, their women and children, who had a whole peculiar colour-world
  of their own&mdash;the boy&rsquo;s superficial delight in the broad light and
  shadow of all that was mingled with the sense of power, of unknown distance,
  of the danger of storm and possible death.</p>

  <p>To this place, then, Marius came down now from White-nights, to live in
  the house of his guardian or tutor, that he might attend the school of a
  famous rhetorician, and learn, among [46] other things, Greek. The school,
  one of many imitations of Plato&rsquo;s Academy in the old Athenian garden,
  lay in a quiet suburb of Pisa, and had its grove of cypresses, its porticoes,
  a house for the master, its chapel and images. For the memory of Marius in
  after-days, a clear morning sunlight seemed to lie perpetually on that severe
  picture in old gray and green. The lad went to this school daily betimes, in
  state at first, with a young slave to carry the books, and certainly with no
  reluctance, for the sight of his fellow-scholars, and their petulant
  activity, coming upon the sadder sentimental moods of his childhood, awoke at
  once that instinct of emulation which is but the other side of sympathy; and
  he was not aware, of course, how completely the difference of his previous
  training had made him, even in his most enthusiastic participation in the
  ways of that little world, still essentially but a spectator. While all their
  heart was in their limited boyish race, and its transitory prizes, he was
  already entertaining himself, very pleasurably meditative, with the tiny
  drama in action before him, as but the mimic, preliminary exercise for a
  larger contest, and already with an implicit epicureanism. Watching all the
  gallant effects of their small rivalries&mdash;a scene in the main of fresh
  delightful sunshine&mdash;he entered at once into the sensations of a rivalry
  beyond them, into the passion of men, and had already recognised a certain
  [47] appetite for fame, for distinction among his fellows, as his dominant
  motive to be.</p>

  <p>The fame he conceived for himself at this time was, as the reader will
  have anticipated, of the intellectual order, that of a poet perhaps. And as,
  in that gray monastic tranquillity of the villa, inward voices from the
  reality of unseen things had come abundantly; so here, with the sounds and
  aspects of the shore, and amid the urbanities, the graceful follies, of a
  bathing-place, it was the reality, the tyrannous reality, of things visible
  that was borne in upon him. The real world around&mdash;a present humanity
  not less comely, it might seem, than that of the old heroic
  days&mdash;endowing everything it touched upon, however remotely, down to its
  little passing tricks of fashion even, with a kind of fleeting beauty,
  exercised over him just then a great fascination.</p>

  <p>That sense had come upon him in all its power one exceptionally fine
  summer, the summer when, at a somewhat earlier age than was usual, he had
  formally assumed the dress of manhood, going into the Forum for that purpose,
  accompanied by his friends in festal array. At night, after the full measure
  of those cloudless days, he would feel well-nigh wearied out, as if with a
  long succession of pictures and music. As he wandered through the gay streets
  or on the sea-shore, the real world seemed indeed boundless, and himself
  almost absolutely free in it, with a boundless [48] appetite for experience,
  for adventure, whether physical or of the spirit. His entire rearing hitherto
  had lent itself to an imaginative exaltation of the past; but now the
  spectacle actually afforded to his untired and freely open senses, suggested
  the reflection that the present had, it might be, really advanced beyond the
  past, and he was ready to boast in the very fact that it was modern. If, in a
  voluntary archaism, the polite world of that day went back to a choicer
  generation, as it fancied, for the purpose of a fastidious self-correction,
  in matters of art, of literature, and even, as we have seen, of religion, at
  least it improved, by a shade or two of more scrupulous finish, on the old
  pattern; and the new era, like the Neu-zeit of the German enthusiasts at the
  beginning of our own century, might perhaps be discerned, awaiting one just a
  single step onward&mdash;the perfected new manner, in the consummation of
  time, alike as regards the things of the imagination and the actual conduct
  of life. Only, while the pursuit of an ideal like this demanded entire
  liberty of heart and brain, that old, staid, conservative religion of his
  childhood certainly had its being in a world of somewhat narrow restrictions.
  But then, the one was absolutely real, with nothing less than the reality of
  seeing and hearing&mdash;the other, how vague, shadowy, problematical! Could
  its so limited probabilities be worth taking into account in any practical
  question as to the rejecting or receiving [49] of what was indeed so real,
  and, on the face of it, so desirable?</p>

  <p>And, dating from the time of his first coming to school, a great
  friendship had grown up for him, in that life of so few attachments&mdash;
  the pure and disinterested friendship of schoolmates. He had seen Flavian for
  the first time the day on which he had come to Pisa, at the moment when his
  mind was full of wistful thoughts regarding the new life to begin for him to-
  morrow, and he gazed curiously at the crowd of bustling scholars as they came
  from their classes. There was something in Flavian a shade disdainful, as he
  stood isolated from the others for a moment, explained in part by his stature
  and the distinction of the low, broad forehead; though there was pleasantness
  also for the newcomer in the roving blue eyes which seemed somehow to take a
  fuller hold upon things around than is usual with boys. Marius knew that
  those proud glances made kindly note of him for a moment, and felt something
  like friendship at first sight. There was a tone of reserve or gravity there,
  amid perfectly disciplined health, which, to his fancy, seemed to carry
  forward the expression of the austere sky and the clear song of the blackbird
  on that gray March evening. Flavian indeed was a creature who changed much
  with the changes of the passing light and shade about him, and was brilliant
  enough under the early sunshine in [50] school next morning. Of all that
  little world of more or less gifted youth, surely the centre was this lad of
  servile birth. Prince of the school, he had gained an easy dominion over the
  old Greek master by the fascination of his parts, and over his
  fellow-scholars by the figure he bore. He wore already the manly dress; and
  standing there in class, as he displayed his wonderful quickness in
  reckoning, or his taste in declaiming Homer, he was like a carved figure in
  motion, thought Marius, but with that indescribable gleam upon it which the
  words of Homer actually suggested, as perceptible on the visible forms of the
  gods&mdash;<i>hoia theous epenenothen aien eontas</i> (such as the gods are
  endowed with&mdash;Homer, Odyssey, 8.365).</p>

  <p>A story hung by him, a story which his comrades acutely connected with his
  habitual air of somewhat peevish pride. Two points were held to be clear amid
  its general vagueness&mdash;a rich stranger paid his schooling, and he was
  himself very poor, though there was an attractive piquancy in the poverty of
  Flavian which in a scholar of another figure might have been despised. Over
  Marius too his dominion was entire. Three years older than he, Flavian was
  appointed to help the younger boy in his studies, and Marius thus became
  virtually his servant in many things, taking his humours with a sort of
  grateful pride in being noticed at all, and, thinking over all this
  afterwards, found that the [51] fascination experienced by him had been a
  sentimental one, dependent on the concession to himself of an intimacy, a
  certain tolerance of his company, granted to none beside.</p>

  <p>That was in the earliest days; and then, as their intimacy grew, the
  genius, the intellectual power of Flavian began its sway over him. The
  brilliant youth who loved dress, and dainty food, and flowers, and seemed to
  have a natural alliance with, and claim upon, everything else which was
  physically select and bright, cultivated also that foppery of words, of
  choice diction which was common among the elite spirits of that day; and
  Marius, early an expert and elegant penman, transcribed his verses (the
  euphuism of which, amid a genuine original power, was then so delightful to
  him) in beautiful ink, receiving in return the profit of Flavian&rsquo;s
  really great intellectual capacities, developed and accomplished under the
  ambitious desire to make his way effectively in life. Among other things he
  introduced him to the writings of a sprightly wit, then very busy with the
  pen, one Lucian&mdash;writings seeming to overflow with that intellectual
  light turned upon dim places, which, at least in seasons of mental fair
  weather, can make people laugh where they have been wont, perhaps, to pray.
  And, surely, the sunlight which filled those well-remembered early mornings
  in school, had had more than the usual measure of gold in it! [52] Marius, at
  least, would lie awake before the time, thinking with delight of the long
  coming hours of hard work in the presence of Flavian, as other boys dream of
  a holiday.</p>

  <p>It was almost by accident at last, so wayward and capricious was he, that
  reserve gave way, and Flavian told the story of his father&mdash;a freedman,
  presented late in life, and almost against his will, with the liberty so
  fondly desired in youth, but on condition of the sacrifice of part of his
  peculium&mdash;the slave&rsquo;s diminutive hoard&mdash;amassed by many a
  self-denial, in an existence necessarily hard. The rich man, interested in
  the promise of the fair child born on his estate, had sent him to school. The
  meanness and dejection, nevertheless, of that unoccupied old age defined the
  leading memory of Flavian, revived sometimes, after this first confidence,
  with a burst of angry tears amid the sunshine. But nature had had her economy
  in nursing the strength of that one natural affection; for, save his half-
  selfish care for Marius, it was the single, really generous part, the one
  piety, in the lad&rsquo;s character. In him Marius saw the spirit of
  unbelief, achieved as if at one step. The much-admired freedman&rsquo;s son,
  as with the privilege of a natural aristocracy, believed only in himself, in
  the brilliant, and mainly sensuous gifts, he had, or meant to acquire.</p>

  <p>And then, he had certainly yielded himself, [53] though still with
  untouched health, in a world where manhood comes early, to the seductions of
  that luxurious town, and Marius wondered sometimes, in the freer revelation
  of himself by conversation, at the extent of his early corruption. How often,
  afterwards, did evil things present themselves in malign association with the
  memory of that beautiful head, and with a kind of borrowed sanction and charm
  in its natural grace! To Marius, at a later time, he counted for as it were
  an epitome of the whole pagan world, the depth of its corruption, and its
  perfection of form. And still, in his mobility, his animation, in his eager
  capacity for various life, he was so real an object, after that visionary
  idealism of the villa. His voice, his glance, were like the breaking in of
  the solid world upon one, amid the flimsy fictions of a dream. A shadow,
  handling all things as shadows, had felt a sudden real and poignant heat in
  them.</p>

  <p>Meantime, under his guidance, Marius was learning quickly and abundantly,
  because with a good will. There was that in the actual effectiveness of his
  figure which stimulated the younger lad to make the most of opportunity; and
  he had experience already that education largely increased one&rsquo;s
  capacity for enjoyment. He was acquiring what it is the chief function of all
  higher education to impart, the art, namely, of so relieving the ideal or
  poetic traits, [54] the elements of distinction, in our everyday
  life&mdash;of so exclusively living in them&mdash;that the unadorned
  remainder of it, the mere drift or debris of our days, comes to be as though
  it were not. And the consciousness of this aim came with the reading of one
  particular book, then fresh in the world, with which he fell in about this
  time--a book which awakened the poetic or romantic capacity as perhaps some
  other book might have done, but was peculiar in giving it a direction
  emphatically sensuous. It made him, in that visionary reception of every-day
  life, the seer, more especially, of a revelation in colour and form. If our
  modern education, in its better efforts, really conveys to any of us that
  kind of idealising power, it does so (though dealing mainly, as its professed
  instruments, with the most select and ideal remains of ancient literature)
  oftenest by truant reading; and thus it happened also, long ago, with Marius
  and his friend.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap05"
     name="chap05"></a>V. &mdash; THE GOLDEN BOOK</h2>

  <p class="first">[55] THE two lads were lounging together over a book, half-
  buried in a heap of dry corn, in an old granary&mdash;the quiet corner to
  which they had climbed out of the way of their noisier companions on one of
  their blandest holiday afternoons. They looked round: the western sun smote
  through the broad chinks of the shutters. How like a picture! and it was
  precisely the scene described in what they were reading, with just that added
  poetic touch in the book which made it delightful and select, and, in the
  actual place, the ray of sunlight transforming the rough grain among the cool
  brown shadows into heaps of gold. What they were intent on was, indeed, the
  book of books, the &ldquo;golden&rdquo; book of that day, a gift to Flavian,
  as was shown by the purple writing on the handsome yellow wrapper, following
  the title Flaviane!&mdash;it said,</p>

  <p class="poem">Flaviane! lege Felicitur!<br>
  Flaviane! Vivas! Floreas!<br>
  Flaviane! Vivas! Gaudeas!</p>

  <p>[56] It was perfumed with oil of sandal-wood, and decorated with carved
  and gilt ivory bosses at the ends of the roller.</p>

  <p>And the inside was something not less dainty and fine, full of the
  archaisms and curious felicities in which that generation delighted, quaint
  terms and images picked fresh from the early dramatists, the lifelike phrases
  of some lost poet preserved by an old grammarian, racy morsels of the
  vernacular and studied prettinesses:&mdash;all alike, mere playthings for the
  genuine power and natural eloquence of the erudite artist, unsuppressed by
  his erudition, which, however, made some people angry, chiefly less well
  &ldquo;got-up&rdquo; people, and especially those who were untidy from
  indolence.</p>

  <p>No! it was certainly not that old-fashioned, unconscious ease of the early
  literature, which could never come again; which, after all, had had more in
  common with the &ldquo;infinite patience&rdquo; of Apuleius than with the
  hack-work readiness of his detractors, who might so well have been
  &ldquo;self- conscious&rdquo; of going slip-shod. And at least his success
  was unmistakable as to the precise literary effect he had intended, including
  a certain tincture of &ldquo;neology&rdquo; in expression&mdash;nonnihil
  interdum elocutione novella parum signatum&mdash;in the language of Cornelius
  Fronto, the contemporary prince of rhetoricians. What words he had found for
  conveying, with a single touch, the sense of textures, colours, [57]
  incidents! &ldquo;Like jewellers&rsquo; work! Like a myrrhine
  vase!&rdquo;&mdash;admirers said of his writing. &ldquo;The golden fibre in
  the hair, the gold thread-work in the gown marked her as the
  mistress&rdquo;&mdash;aurum in comis et in tunicis, ibi inflexum hic
  intextum, matronam profecto confitebatur&mdash;he writes, with his
  &ldquo;curious felicity,&rdquo; of one of his heroines. Aurum intextum: gold
  fibre:&mdash;well! there was something of that kind in his own work. And
  then, in an age when people, from the emperor Aurelius downwards, prided
  themselves unwisely on writing in Greek, he had written for Latin people in
  their own tongue; though still, in truth, with all the care of a learned
  language. Not less happily inventive were the incidents recorded&mdash;story
  within story&mdash;stories with the sudden, unlooked-for changes of dreams.
  He had his humorous touches also. And what went to the ordinary boyish taste,
  in those somewhat peculiar readers, what would have charmed boys more purely
  boyish, was the adventure:&mdash;the bear loose in the house at night, the
  wolves storming the farms in winter, the exploits of the robbers, their
  charming caves, the delightful thrill one had at the
  question&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that these roads are infested by
  robbers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The scene of the romance was laid in Thessaly, the original land of
  witchcraft, and took one up and down its mountains, and into its old weird
  towns, haunts of magic and [58] incantation, where all the more genuine
  appliances of the black art, left behind her by Medea when she fled through
  that country, were still in use. In the city of Hypata, indeed, nothing
  seemed to be its true self&mdash;&ldquo;You might think that through the
  murmuring of some cadaverous spell, all things had been changed into forms
  not their own; that there was humanity in the hardness of the stones you
  stumbled on; that the birds you heard singing were feathered men; that the
  trees around the walls drew their leaves from a like source. The statues
  seemed about to move, the walls to speak, the dumb cattle to break out in
  prophecy; nay! the very sky and the sunbeams, as if they might suddenly cry
  out.&rdquo; Witches are there who can draw down the moon, or at least the
  lunar virus&mdash;that white fluid she sheds, to be found, so rarely,
  &ldquo;on high, heathy places: which is a poison. A touch of it will drive
  men mad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And in one very remote village lives the sorceress Pamphile, who turns her
  neighbours into various animals. What true humour in the scene where, after
  mounting the rickety stairs, Lucius, peeping curiously through a chink in the
  door, is a spectator of the transformation of the old witch herself into a
  bird, that she may take flight to the object of her affections&mdash;into an
  owl! &ldquo;First she stripped off every rag she had. Then opening a certain
  chest she took from it many small boxes, and removing the lid [59] of one of
  them, rubbed herself over for a long time, from head to foot, with an
  ointment it contained, and after much low muttering to her lamp, began to
  jerk at last and shake her limbs. And as her limbs moved to and fro, out
  burst the soft feathers: stout wings came forth to view: the nose grew hard
  and hooked: her nails were crooked into claws; and Pamphile was an owl. She
  uttered a queasy screech; and, leaping little by little from the ground,
  making trial of herself, fled presently, on full wing, out of
  doors.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>By clumsy imitation of this process, Lucius, the hero of the romance,
  transforms himself, not as he had intended into a showy winged creature, but
  into the animal which has given name to the book; for throughout it there
  runs a vein of racy, homely satire on the love of magic then prevalent,
  curiosity concerning which had led Lucius to meddle with the old
  woman&rsquo;s appliances. &ldquo;Be you my Venus,&rdquo; he says to the
  pretty maid-servant who has introduced him to the view of Pamphile,
  &ldquo;and let me stand by you a winged Cupid!&rdquo; and, freely applying
  the magic ointment, sees himself transformed, &ldquo;not into a bird, but
  into an ass!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Well! the proper remedy for his distress is a supper of roses, could such
  be found, and many are his quaintly picturesque attempts to come by them at
  that adverse season; as he contrives to do at last, when, the grotesque
  procession of Isis [60] passing by with a bear and other strange animals in
  its train, the ass following along with the rest suddenly crunches the
  chaplet of roses carried in the High-priest&rsquo;s hand.</p>

  <p>Meantime, however, he must wait for the spring, with more than the outside
  of an ass; &ldquo;though I was not so much a fool, nor so truly an
  ass,&rdquo; he tells us, when he happens to be left alone with a daintily
  spread table, &ldquo;as to neglect this most delicious fare, and feed upon
  coarse hay.&rdquo; For, in truth, all through the book, there is an
  unmistakably real feeling for asses, with bold touches like Swift&rsquo;s,
  and a genuine animal breadth. Lucius was the original ass, who peeping slily
  from the window of his hiding-place forgot all about the big shade he cast
  just above him, and gave occasion to the joke or proverb about &ldquo;the
  peeping ass and his shadow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the marvellous, delight in which is one of the really serious elements
  in most boys, passed at times, those young readers still feeling its
  fascination, into what French writers call the macabre&mdash;that species of
  almost insane pre-occupation with the materialities of our mouldering flesh,
  that luxury of disgust in gazing on corruption, which was connected, in this
  writer at least, with not a little obvious coarseness. It was a strange
  notion of the gross lust of the actual world, that Marius took from some of
  these episodes. &ldquo;I am told,&rdquo; they read, &ldquo;that [61] when
  foreigners are interred, the old witches are in the habit of out-racing the
  funeral procession, to ravage the corpse&rdquo;&mdash;in order to obtain
  certain cuttings and remnants from it, with which to injure the
  living&mdash;&ldquo;especially if the witch has happened to cast her eye upon
  some goodly young man.&rdquo; And the scene of the night-watching of a dead
  body lest the witches should come to tear off the flesh with their teeth, is
  worthy of Theophile Gautier.</p>

  <p>But set as one of the episodes in the main narrative, a true gem amid its
  mockeries, its coarse though genuine humanity, its burlesque horrors, came
  the tale of Cupid and Psyche, full of brilliant, life-like situations,
  speciosa locis, and abounding in lovely visible imagery (one seemed to see
  and handle the golden hair, the fresh flowers, the precious works of art in
  it!) yet full also of a gentle idealism, so that you might take it, if you
  chose, for an allegory. With a concentration of all his finer literary gifts,
  Apuleius had gathered into it the floating star-matter of many a delightful
  old story.&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Story of Cupid and Psyche.</p>

  <p>In a certain city lived a king and queen who had three daughters exceeding
  fair. But the beauty of the elder sisters, though pleasant to behold, yet
  passed not the measure of human praise, while such was the loveliness of the
  [62] youngest that men&rsquo;s speech was too poor to commend it worthily and
  could express it not at all. Many of the citizens and of strangers, whom the
  fame of this excellent vision had gathered thither, confounded by that
  matchless beauty, could but kiss the finger-tips of their right hands at
  sight of her, as in adoration to the goddess Venus herself. And soon a rumour
  passed through the country that she whom the blue deep had borne, forbearing
  her divine dignity, was even then moving among men, or that by some fresh
  germination from the stars, not the sea now, but the earth, had put forth a
  new Venus, endued with the flower of virginity.</p>

  <p>This belief, with the fame of the maiden&rsquo;s loveliness, went daily
  further into distant lands, so that many people were drawn together to behold
  that glorious model of the age. Men sailed no longer to Paphos, to Cnidus or
  Cythera, to the presence of the goddess Venus: her sacred rites were
  neglected, her images stood uncrowned, the cold ashes were left to disfigure
  her forsaken altars. It was to a maiden that men&rsquo;s prayers were
  offered, to a human countenance they looked, in propitiating so great a
  godhead: when the girl went forth in the morning they strewed flowers on her
  way, and the victims proper to that unseen goddess were presented as she
  passed along. This conveyance of divine worship to a mortal kindled meantime
  the anger of the true Venus. &ldquo;Lo! now, the ancient [63] parent of
  nature,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the fountain of all elements! Behold me,
  Venus, benign mother of the world, sharing my honours with a mortal maiden,
  while my name, built up in heaven, is profaned by the mean things of earth!
  Shall a perishable woman bear my image about with her? In vain did the
  shepherd of Ida prefer me! Yet shall she have little joy, whosoever she be,
  of her usurped and unlawful loveliness!&rdquo; Thereupon she called to her
  that winged, bold boy, of evil ways, who wanders armed by night through
  men&rsquo;s houses, spoiling their marriages; and stirring yet more by her
  speech his inborn wantonness, she led him to the city, and showed him Psyche
  as she walked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I pray thee,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;give thy mother a full
  revenge. Let this maid become the slave of an unworthy love.&rdquo; Then,
  embracing him closely, she departed to the shore and took her throne upon the
  crest of the wave. And lo! at her unuttered will, her ocean-servants are in
  waiting: the daughters of Nereus are there singing their song, and Portunus,
  and Salacia, and the tiny charioteer of the dolphin, with a host of Tritons
  leaping through the billows. And one blows softly through his sounding sea-
  shell, another spreads a silken web against the sun, a third presents the
  mirror to the eyes of his mistress, while the others swim side by side below,
  drawing her chariot. Such was the escort of Venus as she went upon the
  sea.</p>

  <p>[64] Psyche meantime, aware of her loveliness, had no fruit thereof. All
  people regarded and admired, but none sought her in marriage. It was but as
  on the finished work of the craftsman that they gazed upon that divine
  likeness. Her sisters, less fair than she, were happily wedded. She, even as
  a widow, sitting at home, wept over her desolation, hating in her heart the
  beauty in which all men were pleased.</p>

  <p>And the king, supposing the gods were angry, inquired of the oracle of
  Apollo, and Apollo answered him thus: &ldquo;Let the damsel be placed on the
  top of a certain mountain, adorned as for the bed of marriage and of death.
  Look not for a son-in-law of mortal birth; but for that evil serpent-thing,
  by reason of whom even the gods tremble and the shadows of Styx are
  afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So the king returned home and made known the oracle to his wife. For many
  days she lamented, but at last the fulfilment of the divine precept is urgent
  upon her, and the company make ready to conduct the maiden to her deadly
  bridal. And now the nuptial torch gathers dark smoke and ashes: the pleasant
  sound of the pipe is changed into a cry: the marriage hymn concludes in a
  sorrowful wailing: below her yellow wedding-veil the bride shook away her
  tears; insomuch that the whole city was afflicted together at the ill-luck of
  the stricken house.</p>

  <p>But the mandate of the god impelled the hapless Psyche to her fate, and,
  these solemnities [65] being ended, the funeral of the living soul goes
  forth, all the people following. Psyche, bitterly weeping, assists not at her
  marriage but at her own obsequies, and while the parents hesitate to
  accomplish a thing so unholy the daughter cries to them: &ldquo;Wherefore
  torment your luckless age by long weeping? This was the prize of my
  extraordinary beauty! When all people celebrated us with divine honours, and
  in one voice named the New Venus, it was then ye should have wept for me as
  one dead. Now at last I understand that that one name of Venus has been my
  ruin. Lead me and set me upon the appointed place. I am in haste to submit to
  that well-omened marriage, to behold that goodly spouse. Why delay the coming
  of him who was born for the destruction of the whole world?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was silent, and with firm step went on the way. And they proceeded to
  the appointed place on a steep mountain, and left there the maiden alone, and
  took their way homewards dejectedly. The wretched parents, in their
  close-shut house, yielded themselves to perpetual night; while to Psyche,
  fearful and trembling and weeping sore upon the mountain-top, comes the
  gentle Zephyrus. He lifts her mildly, and, with vesture afloat on either
  side, bears her by his own soft breathing over the windings of the hills, and
  sets her lightly among the flowers in the bosom of a valley below.</p>

  <p>Psyche, in those delicate grassy places, lying [66] sweetly on her dewy
  bed, rested from the agitation of her soul and arose in peace. And lo! a
  grove of mighty trees, with a fount of water, clear as glass, in the midst;
  and hard by the water, a dwelling-place, built not by human hands but by some
  divine cunning. One recognised, even at the entering, the delightful hostelry
  of a god. Golden pillars sustained the roof, arched most curiously in
  cedar-wood and ivory. The walls were hidden under wrought silver:&mdash;all
  tame and woodland creatures leaping forward to the visitor&rsquo;s gaze.
  Wonderful indeed was the craftsman, divine or half-divine, who by the
  subtlety of his art had breathed so wild a soul into the silver! The very
  pavement was distinct with pictures in goodly stones. In the glow of its
  precious metal the house is its own daylight, having no need of the sun. Well
  might it seem a place fashioned for the conversation of gods with men!</p>

  <p>Psyche, drawn forward by the delight of it, came near, and, her courage
  growing, stood within the doorway. One by one, she admired the beautiful
  things she saw; and, most wonderful of all! no lock, no chain, nor living
  guardian protected that great treasure house. But as she gazed there came a
  voice&mdash;a voice, as it were unclothed of bodily
  vesture&mdash;&ldquo;Mistress!&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;all these things are
  thine. Lie down, and relieve thy weariness, and rise again for the bath when
  thou wilt. We thy servants, whose [67] voice thou hearest, will be beforehand
  with our service, and a royal feast shall be ready.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Psyche understood that some divine care was providing, and, refreshed
  with sleep and the Bath, sat down to the feast. Still she saw no one: only
  she heard words falling here and there, and had voices alone to serve her.
  And the feast being ended, one entered the chamber and sang to her unseen,
  while another struck the chords of a harp, invisible with him who played on
  it. Afterwards the sound of a company singing together came to her, but still
  so that none were present to sight; yet it appeared that a great multitude of
  singers was there.</p>

  <p>And the hour of evening inviting her, she climbed into the bed; and as the
  night was far advanced, behold a sound of a certain clemency approaches her.
  Then, fearing for her maidenhood in so great solitude, she trembled, and more
  than any evil she knew dreaded that she knew not. And now the husband, that
  unknown husband, drew near, and ascended the couch, and made her his wife;
  and lo! before the rise of dawn he had departed hastily. And the attendant
  voices ministered to the needs of the newly married. And so it happened with
  her for a long season. And as nature has willed, this new thing, by continual
  use, became a delight to her: the sound of the voice grew to be her solace in
  that condition of loneliness and uncertainty.</p>

  <p>[68] One night the bridegroom spoke thus to his beloved, &ldquo;O Psyche,
  most pleasant bride! Fortune is grown stern with us, and threatens thee with
  mortal peril. Thy sisters, troubled at the report of thy death and seeking
  some trace of thee, will come to the mountain&rsquo;s top. But if by chance
  their cries reach thee, answer not, neither look forth at all, lest thou
  bring sorrow upon me and destruction upon thyself.&rdquo; Then Psyche
  promised that she would do according to his will. But the bridegroom was fled
  away again with the night. And all that day she spent in tears, repeating
  that she was now dead indeed, shut up in that golden prison, powerless to
  console her sisters sorrowing after her, or to see their faces; and so went
  to rest weeping.</p>

  <p>And after a while came the bridegroom again, and lay down beside her, and
  embracing her as she wept, complained, &ldquo;Was this thy promise, my
  Psyche? What have I to hope from thee? Even in the arms of thy husband thou
  ceasest not from pain. Do now as thou wilt. Indulge thine own desire, though
  it seeks what will ruin thee. Yet wilt thou remember my warning, repentant
  too late.&rdquo; Then, protesting that she is like to die, she obtains from
  him that he suffer her to see her sisters, and present to them moreover what
  gifts she would of golden ornaments; but therewith he ofttimes advised her
  never at any time, yielding to pernicious counsel, to enquire concerning his
  bodily form, lest she fall, [69] through unholy curiosity, from so great a
  height of fortune, nor feel ever his embrace again. &ldquo;I would die a
  hundred times,&rdquo; she said, cheerful at last, &ldquo;rather than be
  deprived of thy most sweet usage. I love thee as my own soul, beyond
  comparison even with Love himself. Only bid thy servant Zephyrus bring hither
  my sisters, as he brought me. My honeycomb! My husband! Thy Psyche&rsquo;s
  breath of life!&rdquo; So he promised; and after the embraces of the night,
  ere the light appeared, vanished from the hands of his bride.</p>

  <p>And the sisters, coming to the place where Psyche was abandoned, wept
  loudly among the rocks, and called upon her by name, so that the sound came
  down to her, and running out of the palace distraught, she cried,
  &ldquo;Wherefore afflict your souls with lamentation? I whom you mourn am
  here.&rdquo; Then, summoning Zephyrus, she reminded him of her
  husband&rsquo;s bidding; and he bare them down with a gentle blast.
  &ldquo;Enter now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;into my house, and relieve your
  sorrow in the company of Psyche your sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Psyche displayed to them all the treasures of the golden house, and
  its great family of ministering voices, nursing in them the malice which was
  already at their hearts. And at last one of them asks curiously who the lord
  of that celestial array may be, and what manner of man her husband? And
  Psyche [70] answered dissemblingly, &ldquo;A young man, handsome and
  mannerly, with a goodly beard. For the most part he hunts upon the
  mountains.&rdquo; And lest the secret should slip from her in the way of
  further speech, loading her sisters with gold and gems, she commanded
  Zephyrus to bear them away.</p>

  <p>And they returned home, on fire with envy. &ldquo;See now the injustice of
  fortune!&rdquo; cried one. &ldquo;We, the elder children, are given like
  servants to be the wives of strangers, while the youngest is possessed of so
  great riches, who scarcely knows how to use them. You saw, Sister! what a
  hoard of wealth lies in the house; what glittering gowns; what splendour of
  precious gems, besides all that gold trodden under foot. If she indeed hath,
  as she said, a bridegroom so goodly, then no one in all the world is happier.
  And it may be that this husband, being of divine nature, will make her too a
  goddess. Nay! so in truth it is. It was even thus she bore herself. Already
  she looks aloft and breathes divinity, who, though but a woman, has voices
  for her handmaidens, and can command the winds.&rdquo; &ldquo;Think,&rdquo;
  answered the other, &ldquo;how arrogantly she dealt with us, grudging us
  these trifling gifts out of all that store, and when our company became a
  burden, causing us to be hissed and driven away from her through the air! But
  I am no woman if she keep her hold on this great fortune; and if the insult
  done us has touched [71] thee too, take we counsel together. Meanwhile let us
  hold our peace, and know naught of her, alive or dead. For they are not truly
  happy of whose happiness other folk are unaware.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And the bridegroom, whom still she knows not, warns her thus a second
  time, as he talks with her by night: &ldquo;Seest thou what peril besets
  thee? Those cunning wolves have made ready for thee their snares, of which
  the sum is that they persuade thee to search into the fashion of my
  countenance, the seeing of which, as I have told thee often, will be the
  seeing of it no more for ever. But do thou neither listen nor make answer to
  aught regarding thy husband. Besides, we have sown also the seed of our race.
  Even now this bosom grows with a child to be born to us, a child, if thou but
  keep our secret, of divine quality; if thou profane it, subject to
  death.&rdquo; And Psyche was glad at the tidings, rejoicing in that solace of
  a divine seed, and in the glory of that pledge of love to be, and the dignity
  of the name of mother. Anxiously she notes the increase of the days, the
  waning months. And again, as he tarries briefly beside her, the bridegroom
  repeats his warning:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Even now the sword is drawn with which thy sisters seek thy life.
  Have pity on thyself, sweet wife, and upon our child, and see not those evil
  women again.&rdquo; But the sisters make their way into the palace once more,
  crying to her in [72] wily tones, &ldquo;O Psyche! and thou too wilt be a
  mother! How great will be the joy at home! Happy indeed shall we be to have
  the nursing of the golden child. Truly if he be answerable to the beauty of
  his parents, it will be a birth of Cupid himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So, little by little, they stole upon the heart of their sister. She,
  meanwhile, bids the lyre to sound for their delight, and the playing is
  heard: she bids the pipes to move, the quire to sing, and the music and the
  singing come invisibly, soothing the mind of the listener with sweetest
  modulation. Yet not even thereby was their malice put to sleep: once more
  they seek to know what manner of husband she has, and whence that seed. And
  Psyche, simple over- much, forgetful of her first story, answers, &ldquo;My
  husband comes from a far country, trading for great sums. He is already of
  middle age, with whitening locks.&rdquo; And therewith she dismisses them
  again.</p>

  <p>And returning home upon the soft breath of Zephyrus one cried to the
  other, &ldquo;What shall be said of so ugly a lie? He who was a young man
  with goodly beard is now in middle life. It must be that she told a false
  tale: else is she in very truth ignorant what manner of man he is. Howsoever
  it be, let us destroy her quickly. For if she indeed knows not, be sure that
  her bridegroom is one of the gods: it is a god she bears in her womb. And let
  [73] that be far from us! If she be called mother of a god, then will life be
  more than I can bear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So, full of rage against her, they returned to Psyche, and said to her
  craftily, &ldquo;Thou livest in an ignorant bliss, all incurious of thy real
  danger. It is a deadly serpent, as we certainly know, that comes to sleep at
  thy side. Remember the words of the oracle, which declared thee destined to a
  cruel beast. There are those who have seen it at nightfall, coming back from
  its feeding. In no long time, they say, it will end its blandishments. It but
  waits for the babe to be formed in thee, that it may devour thee by so much
  the richer. If indeed the solitude of this musical place, or it may be the
  loathsome commerce of a hidden love, delight thee, we at least in sisterly
  piety have done our part.&rdquo; And at last the unhappy Psyche, simple and
  frail of soul, carried away by the terror of their words, losing memory of
  her husband&rsquo;s precepts and her own promise, brought upon herself a
  great calamity. Trembling and turning pale, she answers them, &ldquo;And they
  who tell those things, it may be, speak the truth. For in very deed never
  have I seen the face of my husband, nor know I at all what manner of man he
  is. Always he frights me diligently from the sight of him, threatening some
  great evil should I too curiously look upon his face. Do ye, if ye can help
  your sister in her great peril, stand by her now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>[74] Her sisters answered her, &ldquo;The way of safety we have well
  considered, and will teach thee. Take a sharp knife, and hide it in that part
  of the couch where thou art wont to lie: take also a lamp filled with oil,
  and set it Privily behind the curtain. And when he shall have drawn up his
  coils into the accustomed place, and thou hearest him breathe in sleep, slip
  then from his side and discover the lamp, and, knife in hand, put forth thy
  strength, and strike off the serpent&rsquo;s head.&rdquo; And so they
  departed in haste.</p>

  <p>And Psyche left alone (alone but for the furies which beset her) is tossed
  up and down in her distress, like a wave of the sea; and though her will is
  firm, yet, in the moment of putting hand to the deed, she falters, and is
  torn asunder by various apprehension of the great calamity upon her. She
  hastens and anon delays, now full of distrust, and now of angry courage:
  under one bodily form she loathes the monster and loves the bridegroom. But
  twilight ushers in the night; and at length in haste she makes ready for the
  terrible deed. Darkness came, and the bridegroom; and he first, after some
  faint essay of love, falls into a deep sleep.</p>

  <p>And she, erewhile of no strength, the hard purpose of destiny assisting
  her, is confirmed in force. With lamp plucked forth, knife in hand, she put
  by her sex; and lo! as the secrets of the bed became manifest, the sweetest
  and most gentle of all creatures, Love himself, reclined [75] there, in his
  own proper loveliness! At sight of him the very flame of the lamp kindled
  more gladly! But Psyche was afraid at the vision, and, faint of soul,
  trembled back upon her knees, and would have hidden the steel in her own
  bosom. But the knife slipped from her hand; and now, undone, yet ofttimes
  looking upon the beauty of that divine countenance, she lives again. She sees
  the locks of that golden head, pleasant with the unction of the gods, shed
  down in graceful entanglement behind and before, about the ruddy cheeks and
  white throat. The pinions of the winged god, yet fresh with the dew, are
  spotless upon his shoulders, the delicate plumage wavering over them as they
  lie at rest. Smooth he was, and, touched with light, worthy of Venus his
  mother. At the foot of the couch lay his bow and arrows, the instruments of
  his power, propitious to men.</p>

  <p>And Psyche, gazing hungrily thereon, draws an arrow from the quiver, and
  trying the point upon her thumb, tremulous still, drave in the barb, so that
  a drop of blood came forth. Thus fell she, by her own act, and unaware, into
  the love of Love. Falling upon the bridegroom, with indrawn breath, in a
  hurry of kisses from eager and open lips, she shuddered as she thought how
  brief that sleep might be. And it chanced that a drop of burning oil fell
  from the lamp upon the god&rsquo;s shoulder. Ah! maladroit minister of love,
  thus to wound him from whom [76] all fire comes; though &rsquo;twas a lover,
  I trow, first devised thee, to have the fruit of his desire even in the
  darkness! At the touch of the fire the god started up, and beholding the
  overthrow of her faith, quietly took flight from her embraces.</p>

  <p>And Psyche, as he rose upon the wing, laid hold on him with her two hands,
  hanging upon him in his passage through the air, till she sinks to the earth
  through weariness. And as she lay there, the divine lover, tarrying still,
  lighted upon a cypress tree which grew near, and, from the top of it, spake
  thus to her, in great emotion. &ldquo;Foolish one! unmindful of the command
  of Venus, my mother, who had devoted thee to one of base degree, I fled to
  thee in his stead. Now know I that this was vainly done. Into mine own flesh
  pierced mine arrow, and I made thee my wife, only that I might seem a monster
  beside thee&mdash;that thou shouldst seek to wound the head wherein lay the
  eyes so full of love to thee! Again and again, I thought to put thee on thy
  guard concerning these things, and warned thee in loving-kindness. Now I
  would but punish thee by my flight hence.&rdquo; And therewith he winged his
  way into the deep sky.</p>

  <p>Psyche, prostrate upon the earth, and following far as sight might reach
  the flight of the bridegroom, wept and lamented; and when the breadth of
  space had parted him wholly from her, cast herself down from the bank of a
  river [77] which was nigh. But the stream, turning gentle in honour of the
  god, put her forth again unhurt upon its margin. And as it happened, Pan, the
  rustic god, was sitting just then by the waterside, embracing, in the body of
  a reed, the goddess Canna; teaching her to respond to him in all varieties of
  slender sound. Hard by, his flock of goats browsed at will. And the shaggy
  god called her, wounded and outworn, kindly to him and said, &ldquo;I am but
  a rustic herdsman, pretty maiden, yet wise, by favour of my great age and
  long experience; and if I guess truly by those faltering steps, by thy
  sorrowful eyes and continual sighing, thou labourest with excess of love.
  Listen then to me, and seek not death again, in the stream or otherwise. Put
  aside thy woe, and turn thy prayers to Cupid. He is in truth a delicate
  youth: win him by the delicacy of thy service.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So the shepherd-god spoke, and Psyche, answering nothing, but with a
  reverence to his serviceable deity, went on her way. And while she, in her
  search after Cupid, wandered through many lands, he was lying in the chamber
  of his mother, heart-sick. And the white bird which floats over the waves
  plunged in haste into the sea, and approaching Venus, as she bathed, made
  known to her that her son lies afflicted with some grievous hurt, doubtful of
  life. And Venus cried, angrily, &ldquo;My son, then, has a mistress! And it
  is Psyche, who witched away [78] my beauty and was the rival of my godhead,
  whom he loves!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Therewith she issued from the sea, and returning to her golden chamber,
  found there the lad, sick, as she had heard, and cried from the doorway,
  &ldquo;Well done, truly! to trample thy mother&rsquo;s precepts under foot,
  to spare my enemy that cross of an unworthy love; nay, unite her to thyself,
  child as thou art, that I might have a daughter-in-law who hates me! I will
  make thee repent of thy sport, and the savour of thy marriage bitter. There
  is one who shall chasten this body of thine, put out thy torch and unstring
  thy bow. Not till she has plucked forth that hair, into which so oft these
  hands have smoothed the golden light, and sheared away thy wings, shall I
  feel the injury done me avenged.&rdquo; And with this she hastened in anger
  from the doors.</p>

  <p>And Ceres and Juno met her, and sought to know the meaning of her troubled
  countenance. &ldquo;Ye come in season,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I pray you,
  find for me Psyche. It must needs be that ye have heard the disgrace of my
  house.&rdquo; And they, ignorant of what was done, would have soothed her
  anger, saying, &ldquo;What fault, Mistress, hath thy son committed, that thou
  wouldst destroy the girl he loves? Knowest thou not that he is now of age?
  Because he wears his years so lightly must he seem to thee ever but a child?
  Wilt thou for ever thus pry into the [79] pastimes of thy son, always
  accusing his wantonness, and blaming in him those delicate wiles which are
  all thine own?&rdquo; Thus, in secret fear of the boy&rsquo;s bow, did they
  seek to please him with their gracious patronage. But Venus, angry at their
  light taking of her wrongs, turned her back upon them, and with hasty steps
  made her way once more to the sea.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Psyche, tost in soul, wandering hither and thither, rested not
  night or day in the pursuit of her husband, desiring, if she might not sooth
  his anger by the endearments of a wife, at the least to propitiate him with
  the prayers of a handmaid. And seeing a certain temple on the top of a high
  mountain, she said, &ldquo;Who knows whether yonder place be not the abode of
  my lord?&rdquo; Thither, therefore, she turned her steps, hastening now the
  more because desire and hope pressed her on, weary as she was with the
  labours of the way, and so, painfully measuring out the highest ridges of the
  mountain, drew near to the sacred couches. She sees ears of wheat, in heaps
  or twisted into chaplets; ears of barley also, with sickles and all the
  instruments of harvest, lying there in disorder, thrown at random from the
  hands of the labourers in the great heat. These she curiously sets apart, one
  by one, duly ordering them; for she said within herself, &ldquo;I may not
  neglect the shrines, nor the holy service, of any god there be, but must
  rather [80] win by supplication the kindly mercy of them all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Ceres found her bending sadly upon her task, and cried aloud,
  &ldquo;Alas, Psyche! Venus, in the furiousness of her anger, tracks thy
  footsteps through the world, seeking for thee to pay her the utmost penalty;
  and thou, thinking of anything rather than thine own safety, hast taken on
  thee the care of what belongs to me!&rdquo; Then Psyche fell down at her
  feet, and sweeping the floor with her hair, washing the footsteps of the
  goddess in her tears, besought her mercy, with many prayers:&mdash;&ldquo;By
  the gladdening rites of harvest, by the lighted lamps and mystic marches of
  the Marriage and mysterious Invention of thy daughter Proserpine, and by all
  beside that the holy place of Attica veils in silence, minister, I pray thee,
  to the sorrowful heart of Psyche! Suffer me to hide myself but for a few days
  among the heaps of corn, till time have softened the anger of the goddess,
  and my strength, out-worn in my long travail, be recovered by a little
  rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Ceres answered her, &ldquo;Truly thy tears move me, and I would fain
  help thee; only I dare not incur the ill-will of my kinswoman. Depart hence
  as quickly as may be.&rdquo; And Psyche, repelled against hope, afflicted now
  with twofold sorrow, making her way back again, beheld among the half-lighted
  woods of the valley below a sanctuary builded with cunning [81] art. And that
  she might lose no way of hope, howsoever doubtful, she drew near to the
  sacred doors. She sees there gifts of price, and garments fixed upon the
  door-posts and to the branches of the trees, wrought with letters of gold
  which told the name of the goddess to whom they were dedicated, with
  thanksgiving for that she had done. So, with bent knee and hands laid about
  the glowing altar, she prayed saying, &ldquo;Sister and spouse of Jupiter! be
  thou to these my desperate fortune&rsquo;s Juno the Auspicious! I know that
  thou dost willingly help those in travail with child; deliver me from the
  peril that is upon me.&rdquo; And as she prayed thus, Juno in the majesty of
  her godhead, was straightway present, and answered, &ldquo;Would that I might
  incline favourably to thee; but against the will of Venus, whom I have ever
  loved as a daughter, I may not, for very shame, grant thy prayer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Psyche, dismayed by this new shipwreck of her hope, communed thus with
  herself, &ldquo;Whither, from the midst of the snares that beset me, shall I
  take my way once more? In what dark solitude shall I hide me from the all-
  seeing eye of Venus? What if I put on at length a man&rsquo;s courage, and
  yielding myself unto her as my mistress, soften by a humility not yet too
  late the fierceness of her purpose? Who knows but that I may find him also
  whom my soul seeketh after, in the abode of his mother?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>[82] And Venus, renouncing all earthly aid in her search, prepared to
  return to heaven. She ordered the chariot to be made ready, wrought for her
  by Vulcan as a marriage-gift, with a cunning of hand which had left his work
  so much the richer by the weight of gold it lost under his tool. From the
  multitude which housed about the bed-chamber of their mistress, white doves
  came forth, and with joyful motions bent their painted necks beneath the
  yoke. Behind it, with playful riot, the sparrows sped onward, and other birds
  sweet of song, making known by their soft notes the approach of the goddess.
  Eagle and cruel hawk alarmed not the quireful family of Venus. And the clouds
  broke away, as the uttermost ether opened to receive her, daughter and
  goddess, with great joy.</p>

  <p>And Venus passed straightway to the house of Jupiter to beg from him the
  service of Mercury, the god of speech. And Jupiter refused not her prayer.
  And Venus and Mercury descended from heaven together; and as they went, the
  former said to the latter, &ldquo;Thou knowest, my brother of Arcady, that
  never at any time have I done anything without thy help; for how long time,
  moreover, I have sought a certain maiden in vain. And now naught remains but
  that, by thy heraldry, I proclaim a reward for whomsoever shall find her. Do
  thou my bidding quickly.&rdquo; And therewith [83] she conveyed to him a
  little scrip, in the which was written the name of Psyche, with other things;
  and so returned home.</p>

  <p>And Mercury failed not in his office; but departing into all lands,
  proclaimed that whosoever delivered up to Venus the fugitive girl, should
  receive from herself seven kisses&mdash;one thereof full of the inmost honey
  of her throat. With that the doubt of Psyche was ended. And now, as she came
  near to the doors of Venus, one of the household, whose name was Use-and-
  Wont, ran out to her, crying, &ldquo;Hast thou learned, Wicked Maid! now at
  last! that thou hast a mistress?&rdquo; And seizing her roughly by the hair,
  drew her into the presence of Venus. And when Venus saw her, she cried out,
  saying, &ldquo;Thou hast deigned then to make thy salutations to thy
  mother-in- law. Now will I in turn treat thee as becometh a dutiful
  daughter-in- law!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And she took barley and millet and poppy-seed, every kind of grain and
  seed, and mixed them together, and laughed, and said to her: &ldquo;Methinks
  so plain a maiden can earn lovers only by industrious ministry: now will I
  also make trial of thy service. Sort me this heap of seed, the one kind from
  the others, grain by grain; and get thy task done before the evening.&rdquo;
  And Psyche, stunned by the cruelty of her bidding, was silent, and moved not
  her hand to the inextricable heap. And there came [84] forth a little ant,
  which had understanding of the difficulty of her task, and took pity upon the
  consort of the god of Love; and he ran deftly hither and thither, and called
  together the whole army of his fellows. &ldquo;Have pity,&rdquo; he cried,
  &ldquo;nimble scholars of the Earth, Mother of all things!&mdash;have pity
  upon the wife of Love, and hasten to help her in her perilous effort.&rdquo;
  Then, one upon the other, the hosts of the insect people hurried together;
  and they sorted asunder the whole heap of seed, separating every grain after
  its kind, and so departed quickly out of sight.</p>

  <p>And at nightfall Venus returned, and seeing that task finished with so
  wonderful diligence, she cried, &ldquo;The work is not thine, thou naughty
  maid, but his in whose eyes thou hast found favour.&rdquo; And calling her
  again in the morning, &ldquo;See now the grove,&rdquo; she said,
  &ldquo;beyond yonder torrent. Certain sheep feed there, whose fleeces shine
  with gold. Fetch me straightway a lock of that precious stuff, having gotten
  it as thou mayst.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Psyche went forth willingly, not to obey the command of Venus, but
  even to seek a rest from her labour in the depths of the river. But from the
  river, the green reed, lowly mother of music, spake to her: &ldquo;O Psyche!
  pollute not these waters by self-destruction, nor approach that terrible
  flock; for, as the heat groweth, they wax fierce. Lie down under yon
  plane-tree, till the [85] quiet of the river&rsquo;s breath have soothed
  them. Thereafter thou mayst shake down the fleecy gold from the trees of the
  grove, for it holdeth by the leaves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Psyche, instructed thus by the simple reed, in the humanity of its
  heart, filled her bosom with the soft golden stuff, and returned to Venus.
  But the goddess smiled bitterly, and said to her, &ldquo;Well know I who was
  the author of this thing also. I will make further trial of thy discretion,
  and the boldness of thy heart. Seest thou the utmost peak of yonder steep
  mountain? The dark stream which flows down thence waters the Stygian fields,
  and swells the flood of Cocytus. Bring me now, in this little urn, a draught
  from its innermost source.&rdquo; And therewith she put into her hands a
  vessel of wrought crystal.</p>

  <p>And Psyche set forth in haste on her way to the mountain, looking there at
  last to find the end of her hapless life. But when she came to the region
  which borders on the cliff that was showed to her, she understood the deadly
  nature of her task. From a great rock, steep and slippery, a horrible river
  of water poured forth, falling straightway by a channel exceeding narrow into
  the unseen gulf below. And lo! creeping from the rocks on either hand, angry
  serpents, with their long necks and sleepless eyes. The very waters found a
  voice and bade her depart, in smothered cries of, Depart hence! and [86] What
  doest thou here? Look around thee! and Destruction is upon thee! And then
  sense left her, in the immensity of her peril, as one changed to stone.</p>

  <p>Yet not even then did the distress of this innocent soul escape the steady
  eye of a gentle providence. For the bird of Jupiter spread his wings and took
  flight to her, and asked her, &ldquo;Didst thou think, simple one, even thou!
  that thou couldst steal one drop of that relentless stream, the holy river of
  Styx, terrible even to the gods? But give me thine urn.&rdquo; And the bird
  took the urn, and filled it at the source, and returned to her quickly from
  among the teeth of the serpents, bringing with him of the waters, all
  unwilling&mdash;nay! warning him to depart away and not molest them.</p>

  <p>And she, receiving the urn with great joy, ran back quickly that she might
  deliver it to Venus, and yet again satisfied not the angry goddess. &ldquo;My
  child!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in this one thing further must thou serve me.
  Take now this tiny casket, and get thee down even unto hell, and deliver it
  to Proserpine. Tell her that Venus would have of her beauty so much at least
  as may suffice for but one day&rsquo;s use, that beauty she possessed
  erewhile being foreworn and spoiled, through her tendance upon the sick-bed
  of her son; and be not slow in returning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Psyche perceived there the last ebbing of her fortune&mdash;that she
  was now thrust openly [87] upon death, who must go down, of her own motion,
  to Hades and the Shades. And straightway she climbed to the top of an
  exceeding high tower, thinking within herself, &ldquo;I will cast myself down
  thence: so shall I descend most quickly into the kingdom of the dead.&rdquo;
  And the tower again, broke forth into speech: &ldquo;Wretched Maid! Wretched
  Maid! Wilt thou destroy thyself? If the breath quit thy body, then wilt thou
  indeed go down into Hades, but by no means return hither. Listen to me. Among
  the pathless wilds not far from this place lies a certain mountain, and
  therein one of hell&rsquo;s vent-holes. Through the breach a rough way lies
  open, following which thou wilt come, by straight course, to the castle of
  Orcus. And thou must not go empty-handed. Take in each hand a morsel of
  barley-bread, soaked in hydromel; and in thy mouth two pieces of money. And
  when thou shalt be now well onward in the way of death, then wilt thou
  overtake a lame ass laden with wood, and a lame driver, who will pray thee
  reach him certain cords to fasten the burden which is falling from the ass:
  but be thou cautious to pass on in silence. And soon as thou comest to the
  river of the dead, Charon, in that crazy bark he hath, will put thee over
  upon the further side. There is greed even among the dead: and thou shalt
  deliver to him, for the ferrying, one of those two pieces of money, in such
  wise that he take [88] it with his hand from between thy lips. And as thou
  passest over the stream, a dead old man, rising on the water, will put up to
  thee his mouldering hands, and pray thee draw him into the ferry-boat. But
  beware thou yield not to unlawful pity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When thou shalt be come over, and art upon the causeway, certain
  aged women, spinning, will cry to thee to lend thy hand to their work; and
  beware again that thou take no part therein; for this also is the snare of
  Venus, whereby she would cause thee to cast away one at least of those cakes
  thou bearest in thy hands. And think not that a slight matter; for the loss
  of either one of them will be to thee the losing of the light of day. For a
  watch- dog exceeding fierce lies ever before the threshold of that lonely
  house of Proserpine. Close his mouth with one of thy cakes; so shalt thou
  pass by him, and enter straightway into the presence of Proserpine herself.
  Then do thou deliver thy message, and taking what she shall give thee, return
  back again; offering to the watch-dog the other cake, and to the ferryman
  that other piece of money thou hast in thy mouth. After this manner mayst
  thou return again beneath the stars. But withal, I charge thee, think not to
  look into, nor open, the casket thou bearest, with that treasure of the
  beauty of the divine countenance hidden therein.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So spake the stones of the tower; and Psyche [89] delayed not, but
  proceeding diligently after the manner enjoined, entered into the house of
  Proserpine, at whose feet she sat down humbly, and would neither the delicate
  couch nor that divine food the goddess offered her, but did straightway the
  business of Venus. And Proserpine filled the casket secretly and shut the
  lid, and delivered it to Psyche, who fled therewith from Hades with new
  strength. But coming back into the light of day, even as she hasted now to
  the ending of her service, she was seized by a rash curiosity. &ldquo;Lo!
  now,&rdquo; she said within herself, &ldquo;my simpleness! who bearing in my
  hands the divine loveliness, heed not to touch myself with a particle at
  least therefrom, that I may please the more, by the favour of it, my fair
  one, my beloved.&rdquo; Even as she spoke, she lifted the lid; and behold!
  within, neither beauty, nor anything beside, save sleep only, the sleep of
  the dead, which took hold upon her, filling all her members with its drowsy
  vapour, so that she lay down in the way and moved not, as in the slumber of
  death.</p>

  <p>And Cupid being healed of his wound, because he would endure no longer the
  absence of her he loved, gliding through the narrow window of the chamber
  wherein he was holden, his pinions being now repaired by a little rest, fled
  forth swiftly upon them, and coming to the place where Psyche was, shook that
  sleep away from her, and set him in his prison again, awaking her with the
  [90] innocent point of his arrow. &ldquo;Lo! thine old error again,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;which had like once more to have destroyed thee! But do thou now
  what is lacking of the command of my mother: the rest shall be my
  care.&rdquo; With these words, the lover rose upon the air; and being
  consumed inwardly with the greatness of his love, penetrated with vehement
  wing into the highest place of heaven, to lay his cause before the father of
  the gods. And the father of gods took his hand in his, and kissed his face
  and said to him, &ldquo;At no time, my son, hast thou regarded me with due
  honour. Often hast thou vexed my bosom, wherein lies the disposition of the
  stars, with those busy darts of thine. Nevertheless, because thou hast grown
  up between these mine hands, I will accomplish thy desire.&rdquo; And
  straightway he bade Mercury call the gods together; and, the council-chamber
  being filled, sitting upon a high throne, &ldquo;Ye gods,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;all ye whose names are in the white book of the Muses, ye know yonder
  lad. It seems good to me that his youthful heats should by some means be
  restrained. And that all occasion may be taken from him, I would even confine
  him in the bonds of marriage. He has chosen and embraced a mortal maiden. Let
  him have fruit of his love, and possess her for ever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thereupon he bade Mercury produce Psyche in heaven; and holding out to her
  his ambrosial cup, &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and live for ever;
  [91] nor shall Cupid ever depart from thee.&rdquo; And the gods sat down
  together to the marriage-feast.</p>

  <p>On the first couch lay the bridegroom, and Psyche in his bosom. His rustic
  serving-boy bare the wine to Jupiter; and Bacchus to the rest. The Seasons
  crimsoned all things with their roses. Apollo sang to the lyre, while a
  little Pan prattled on his reeds, and Venus danced very sweetly to the soft
  music. Thus, with due rites, did Psyche pass into the power of Cupid; and
  from them was born the daughter whom men call Voluptas.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap06"
     name="chap06"></a>VI. &mdash; EUPHUISM</h2>

  <p class="first">[92] SO the famous story composed itself in the memory of
  Marius, with an expression changed in some ways from the original and on the
  whole graver. The petulant, boyish Cupid of Apuleius was become more like
  that &ldquo;Lord, of terrible aspect,&rdquo; who stood at Dante&rsquo;s
  bedside and wept, or had at least grown to the manly earnestness of the Eros
  of Praxiteles. Set in relief amid the coarser matter of the book, this
  episode of Cupid and Psyche served to combine many lines of meditation,
  already familiar to Marius, into the ideal of a perfect imaginative love,
  centered upon a type of beauty entirely flawless and clean&mdash;an ideal
  which never wholly faded from his thoughts, though he valued it at various
  times in different degrees. The human body in its beauty, as the highest
  potency of all the beauty of material objects, seemed to him just then to be
  matter no longer, but, having taken celestial fire, to assert itself as
  indeed the true, though visible, [93] soul or spirit in things. In contrast
  with that ideal, in all the pure brilliancy, and as it were in the happy
  light, of youth and morning and the springtide, men&rsquo;s actual loves,
  with which at many points the book brings one into close contact, might
  appear to him, like the general tenor of their lives, to be somewhat mean and
  sordid. The hiddenness of perfect things: a shrinking mysticism, a sentiment
  of diffidence like that expressed in Psyche&rsquo;s so tremulous hope
  concerning the child to be born of the husband she had never yet
  seen&mdash;&ldquo;in the face of this little child, at the least, shall I
  apprehend thine&rdquo;&mdash;in hoc saltem parvulo cognoscam faciem tuam: the
  fatality which seems to haunt any signal beauty, whether moral or physical,
  as if it were in itself something illicit and isolating: the suspicion and
  hatred it so often excites in the vulgar:&mdash;these were some of the
  impressions, forming, as they do, a constant tradition of somewhat cynical
  pagan experience, from Medusa and Helen downwards, which the old story
  enforced on him. A book, like a person, has its fortunes with one; is lucky
  or unlucky in the precise moment of its falling in our way, and often by some
  happy accident counts with us for something more than its independent value.
  The Metamorphoses of Apuleius, coming to Marius just then, figured for him as
  indeed The Golden Book: he felt a sort of personal gratitude to its writer,
  and saw in it doubtless [94] far more than was really there for any other
  reader. It occupied always a peculiar place in his remembrance, never quite
  losing its power in frequent return to it for the revival of that first
  glowing impression.</p>

  <p>Its effect upon the elder youth was a more practical one: it stimulated
  the literary ambition, already so strong a motive with him, by a signal
  example of success, and made him more than ever an ardent, indefatigable
  student of words, of the means or instrument of the literary art. The secrets
  of utterance, of expression itself, of that through which alone any
  intellectual or spiritual power within one can actually take effect upon
  others, to over-awe or charm them to one&rsquo;s side, presented themselves
  to this ambitious lad in immediate connexion with that desire for
  predominance, for the satisfaction of which another might have relied on the
  acquisition and display of brilliant military qualities. In him, a fine
  instinctive sentiment of the exact value and power of words was connate with
  the eager longing for sway over his fellows. He saw himself already a gallant
  and effective leader, innovating or conservative as occasion might require,
  in the rehabilitation of the mother-tongue, then fallen so tarnished and
  languid; yet the sole object, as he mused within himself, of the only sort of
  patriotic feeling proper, or possible, for one born of slaves. The popular
  speech was gradually departing from the form [95] and rule of literary
  language, a language always and increasingly artificial. While the learned
  dialect was yearly becoming more and more barbarously pedantic, the
  colloquial idiom, on the other hand, offered a thousand chance- tost gems of
  racy or picturesque expression, rejected or at least ungathered by what
  claimed to be classical Latin. The time was coming when neither the pedants
  nor the people would really understand Cicero; though there were some indeed,
  like this new writer, Apuleius, who, departing from the custom of writing in
  Greek, which had been a fashionable affectation among the sprightlier wits
  since the days of Hadrian, had written in the vernacular.</p>

  <p>The literary programme which Flavian had already designed for himself
  would be a work, then, partly conservative or reactionary, in its dealing
  with the instrument of the literary art; partly popular and revolutionary,
  asserting, so to term them, the rights of the proletariate of speech. More
  than fifty years before, the younger Pliny, himself an effective witness for
  the delicate power of the Latin tongue, had said,&mdash;&ldquo;I am one of
  those who admire the ancients, yet I do not, like some others, underrate
  certain instances of genius which our own times afford. For it is not true
  that nature, as if weary and effete, no longer produces what is
  admirable.&rdquo; And he, Flavian, would prove himself the true master of the
  opportunity thus indicated. In [96] his eagerness for a not too distant fame,
  he dreamed over all that, as the young Caesar may have dreamed of campaigns.
  Others might brutalise or neglect the native speech, that true &ldquo;open
  field&rdquo; for charm and sway over men. He would make of it a serious
  study, weighing the precise power of every phrase and word, as though it were
  precious metal, disentangling the later associations and going back to the
  original and native sense of each,&mdash;restoring to full significance all
  its wealth of latent figurative expression, reviving or replacing its outworn
  or tarnished images. Latin literature and the Latin tongue were dying of
  routine and languor; and what was necessary, first of all, was to
  re-establish the natural and direct relationship between thought and
  expression, between the sensation and the term, and restore to words their
  primitive power.</p>

  <p>For words, after all, words manipulated with all his delicate force, were
  to be the apparatus of a war for himself. To be forcibly impressed, in the
  first place; and in the next, to find the means of making visible to others
  that which was vividly apparent, delightful, of lively interest to himself,
  to the exclusion of all that was but middling, tame, or only half-true even
  to him&mdash;this scrupulousness of literary art actually awoke in Flavian,
  for the first time, a sort of chivalrous conscience. What care for style!
  what patience of execution! what research for the significant [97] tones of
  ancient idiom&mdash;sonantia verba et antiqua! What stately and regular word-
  building&mdash;gravis et decora constructio! He felt the whole meaning of the
  sceptical Pliny&rsquo;s somewhat melancholy advice to one of his friends,
  that he should seek in literature deliverance from mortality&mdash;ut studiis
  se literarum a mortalitate vindicet. And there was everything in the nature
  and the training of Marius to make him a full participator in the hopes of
  such a new literary school, with Flavian for its leader. In the refinements
  of that curious spirit, in its horror of profanities, its fastidious sense of
  a correctness in external form, there was something which ministered to the
  old ritual interest, still surviving in him; as if here indeed were involved
  a kind of sacred service to the mother-tongue.</p>

  <p>Here, then, was the theory of Euphuism, as manifested in every age in
  which the literary conscience has been awakened to forgotten duties towards
  language, towards the instrument of expression: in fact it does but modify a
  little the principles of all effective expression at all times. &rsquo;Tis
  art&rsquo;s function to conceal itself: ars est celare artem:&mdash;is a
  saying, which, exaggerated by inexact quotation, has perhaps been oftenest
  and most confidently quoted by those who have had little literary or other
  art to conceal; and from the very beginning of professional literature, the
  &ldquo;labour of the file&rdquo;&mdash;a labour in the case of Plato, for
  instance, or Virgil, like [98] that of the oldest of goldsmiths as described
  by Apuleius, enriching the work by far more than the weight of precious metal
  it removed&mdash;has always had its function. Sometimes, doubtless, as in
  later examples of it, this Roman Euphuism, determined at any cost to attain
  beauty in writing&mdash;<i>es kallos graphein</i> (to write
  beautifull&gt;)&mdash;might lapse into its characteristic fopperies or
  mannerisms, into the &ldquo;defects of its qualities,&rdquo; in truth, not
  wholly unpleasing perhaps, or at least excusable, when looked at as but the
  toys (so Cicero calls them), the strictly congenial and appropriate toys, of
  an assiduously cultivated age, which could not help being polite, critical,
  self-conscious. The mere love of novelty also had, of course, its part there:
  as with the Euphuism of the Elizabethan age, and of the modern French
  romanticists, its neologies were the ground of one of the favourite charges
  against it; though indeed, as regards these tricks of taste also, there is
  nothing new, but a quaint family likeness rather, between the Euphuists of
  successive ages. Here, as elsewhere, the power of &ldquo;fashion,&rdquo; as
  it is called, is but one minor form, slight enough, it may be, yet distinctly
  symptomatic, of that deeper yearning of human nature towards ideal
  perfection, which is a continuous force in it; and since in this direction
  too human nature is limited, such fashions must necessarily reproduce
  themselves. Among other resemblances to later growths of Euphuism, its
  archaisms on the one hand, and [99] its neologies on the other, the Euphuism
  of the days of Marcus Aurelius had, in the composition of verse, its fancy
  for the refrain. It was a snatch from a popular chorus, something he had
  heard sounding all over the town of Pisa one April night, one of the first
  bland and summer- like nights of the year, that Flavian had chosen for the
  refrain of a poem he was then pondering&mdash;the Pervigilium
  Veneris&mdash;the vigil, or &ldquo;nocturn,&rdquo; of Venus.</p>

  <p>Certain elderly counsellors, filling what may be thought a constant part
  in the little tragi-comedy which literature and its votaries are playing in
  all ages, would ask, suspecting some affectation or unreality in that minute
  culture of form:&mdash;Cannot those who have a thing to say, say it directly?
  Why not be simple and broad, like the old writers of Greece? And this
  challenge had at least the effect of setting his thoughts at work on the
  intellectual situation as it lay between the children of the present and
  those earliest masters. Certainly, the most wonderful, the unique, point,
  about the Greek genius, in literature as in everything else, was the entire
  absence of imitation in its productions. How had the burden of precedent,
  laid upon every artist, increased since then! It was all around
  one:&mdash;that smoothly built world of old classical taste, an accomplished
  fact, with overwhelming authority on every detail of the conduct of
  one&rsquo;s [100] work. With no fardel on its own back, yet so imperious
  towards those who came labouring after it, Hellas, in its early freshness,
  looked as distant from him even then as it does from ourselves. There might
  seem to be no place left for novelty or originality,&mdash;place only for a
  patient, an infinite, faultlessness. On this question too Flavian passed
  through a world of curious art-casuistries, of self-tormenting, at the
  threshold of his work. Was poetic beauty a thing ever one and the same, a
  type absolute; or, changing always with the soul of time itself, did it
  depend upon the taste, the peculiar trick of apprehension, the fashion, as we
  say, of each successive age? Might one recover that old, earlier sense of it,
  that earlier manner, in a masterly effort to recall all the complexities of
  the life, moral and intellectual, of the earlier age to which it had
  belonged? Had there been really bad ages in art or literature? Were all ages,
  even those earliest, adventurous, matutinal days, in themselves equally
  poetical or unpoetical; and poetry, the literary beauty, the poetic ideal,
  always but a borrowed light upon men&rsquo;s actual life?</p>

  <p>Homer had said&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">Hoi d&rsquo; hote de limenos polybentheos entos hikonto,<br>
  Histia men steilanto, thesan d&rsquo; en nei melaine...<br>
  Ek de kai autoi bainon epi phegmini thalasses.</p>

  <p class="poem">[When they had safely made deep harbor<br>
  They took in the sail, laid it in their black ship...<br>
  And went ashore just past the breakers.<br>
  &mdash;Iliad 1.432-33, 437.]</p>

  <p>And how poetic the simple incident seemed, told just thus! Homer was
  always telling [101] things after this manner. And one might think there had
  been no effort in it: that here was but the almost mechanical transcript of a
  time, naturally, intrinsically, poetic, a time in which one could hardly have
  spoken at all without ideal effect, or, the sailors pulled down their boat
  without making a picture in &ldquo;the great style,&rdquo; against a sky
  charged with marvels. Must not the mere prose of an age, itself thus ideal,
  have counted for more than half of Homer&rsquo;s poetry? Or might the closer
  student discover even here, even in Homer, the really mediatorial function of
  the poet, as between the reader and the actual matter of his experience; the
  poet waiting, so to speak, in an age which had felt itself trite and
  commonplace enough, on his opportunity for the touch of &ldquo;golden
  alchemy,&rdquo; or at least for the pleasantly lighted side of things
  themselves? Might not another, in one&rsquo;s own prosaic and used-up time,
  so uneventful as it had been through the long reign of these quiet Antonines,
  in like manner, discover his ideal, by a due waiting upon it? Would not a
  future generation, looking back upon this, under the power of the
  enchanted-distance fallacy, find it ideal to view, in contrast with its own
  languor&mdash;the languor that for some reason (concerning which Augustine
  will one day have his view) seemed to haunt men always? Had Homer, even,
  appeared unreal and affected in his poetic flight, to some of the people of
  his own age, [l02] as seemed to happen with every new literature in turn? In
  any case, the intellectual conditions of early Greece had been&mdash;how
  different from these! And a true literary tact would accept that difference
  in forming the primary conception of the literary function at a later time.
  Perhaps the utmost one could get by conscious effort, in the way of a
  reaction or return to the conditions of an earlier and fresher age, would be
  but novitas, artificial artlessness, naivete; and this quality too might have
  its measure of euphuistic charm, direct and sensible enough, though it must
  count, in comparison with that genuine early Greek newness at the beginning,
  not as the freshness of the open fields, but only of a bunch of field-flowers
  in a heated room.</p>

  <p>There was, meantime, all this:&mdash;on one side, the old pagan culture,
  for us but a fragment, for him an accomplished yet present fact, still a
  living, united, organic whole, in the entirety of its art, its thought, its
  religions, its sagacious forms of polity, that so weighty authority it
  exercised on every point, being in reality only the measure of its charm for
  every one: on the other side, the actual world in all its eager
  self-assertion, with Flavian himself, in his boundless animation, there, at
  the centre of the situation. From the natural defects, from the pettiness, of
  his euphuism, his assiduous cultivation of manner, he was saved by the
  consciousness that he had a matter to present, very real, [103] at least to
  him. That preoccupation of the dilettante with what might seem mere details
  of form, after all, did but serve the purpose of bringing to the surface,
  sincerely and in their integrity, certain strong personal intuitions, a
  certain vision or apprehension of things as really being, with important
  results, thus, rather than thus,&mdash;intuitions which the artistic or
  literary faculty was called upon to follow, with the exactness of wax or
  clay, clothing the model within. Flavian too, with his fine clear mastery of
  the practically effective, had early laid hold of the principle, as axiomatic
  in literature: that to know when one&rsquo;s self is interested, is the first
  condition of interesting other people. It was a principle, the forcible
  apprehension of which made him jealous and fastidious in the selection of his
  intellectual food; often listless while others read or gazed diligently;
  never pretending to be moved out of mere complaisance to people&rsquo;s
  emotions: it served to foster in him a very scrupulous literary sincerity
  with himself. And it was this uncompromising demand for a matter, in all art,
  derived immediately from lively personal intuition, this constant appeal to
  individual judgment, which saved his euphuism, even at its weakest, from
  lapsing into mere artifice.</p>

  <p>Was the magnificent exordium of Lucretius, addressed to the goddess Venus,
  the work of [104] his earlier manhood, and designed originally to open an
  argument less persistently sombre than that protest against the whole pagan
  heaven which actually follows it? It is certainly the most typical expression
  of a mood, still incident to the young poet, as a thing peculiar to his
  youth, when he feels the sentimental current setting forcibly along his
  veins, and so much as a matter of purely physical excitement, that he can
  hardly distinguish it from the animation of external nature, the upswelling
  of the seed in the earth, and of the sap through the trees. Flavian, to whom,
  again, as to his later euphuistic kinsmen, old mythology seemed as full of
  untried, unexpressed motives and interest as human life itself, had long been
  occupied with a kind of mystic hymn to the vernal principle of life in
  things; a composition shaping itself, little by little, out of a thousand dim
  perceptions, into singularly definite form (definite and firm as fine-art in
  metal, thought Marius) for which, as I said, he had caught his
  &ldquo;refrain,&rdquo; from the lips of the young men, singing because they
  could not help it, in the streets of Pisa. And as oftenest happens also, with
  natures of genuinely poetic quality, those piecemeal beginnings came suddenly
  to harmonious completeness among the fortunate incidents, the physical heat
  and light, of one singularly happy day.</p>

  <p>It was one of the first hot days of March&mdash;&ldquo;the sacred
  day&rdquo;&mdash;on which, from Pisa, as from [105] many another harbour on
  the Mediterranean, the Ship of Isis went to sea, and every one walked down to
  the shore-side to witness the freighting of the vessel, its launching and
  final abandonment among the waves, as an object really devoted to the Great
  Goddess, that new rival, or &ldquo;double,&rdquo; of ancient Venus, and like
  her a favourite patroness of sailors. On the evening next before, all the
  world had been abroad to view the illumination of the river; the stately
  lines of building being wreathed with hundreds of many-coloured lamps. The
  young men had poured forth their chorus&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">Cras amet qui nunquam amavit,<br>
  Quique amavit cras amet&mdash;</p>

  <p>as they bore their torches through the yielding crowd, or rowed their
  lanterned boats up and down the stream, till far into the night, when heavy
  rain-drops had driven the last lingerers home. Morning broke, however,
  smiling and serene; and the long procession started betimes. The river,
  curving slightly, with the smoothly paved streets on either side, between its
  low marble parapet and the fair dwelling-houses, formed the main highway of
  the city; and the pageant, accompanied throughout by innumerable lanterns and
  wax tapers, took its course up one of these streets, crossing the water by a
  bridge up-stream, and down the other, to the haven, every possible
  standing-place, out of doors [106] and within, being crowded with
  sight-seers, of whom Marius was one of the most eager, deeply interested in
  finding the spectacle much as Apuleius had described it in his famous
  book.</p>

  <p>At the head of the procession, the master of ceremonies, quietly waving
  back the assistants, made way for a number of women, scattering perfumes.
  They were succeeded by a company of musicians, piping and twanging, on
  instruments the strangest Marius had ever beheld, the notes of a hymn,
  narrating the first origin of this votive rite to a choir of youths, who
  marched behind them singing it. The tire-women and other personal attendants
  of the great goddess came next, bearing the instruments of their ministry,
  and various articles from the sacred wardrobe, wrought of the most precious
  material; some of them with long ivory combs, plying their hands in wild yet
  graceful concert of movement as they went, in devout mimicry of the toilet.
  Placed in their rear were the mirror-bearers of the goddess, carrying large
  mirrors of beaten brass or silver, turned in such a way as to reflect to the
  great body of worshippers who followed, the face of the mysterious image, as
  it moved on its way, and their faces to it, as though they were in fact
  advancing to meet the heavenly visitor. They comprehended a multitude of both
  sexes and of all ages, already initiated into the divine secret, clad in fair
  linen, the females veiled, the males with shining [107] tonsures, and every
  one carrying a sistrum&mdash;the richer sort of silver, a few very dainty
  persons of fine gold&mdash;rattling the reeds, with a noise like the jargon
  of innumerable birds and insects awakened from torpor and abroad in the
  spring sun. Then, borne upon a kind of platform, came the goddess herself,
  undulating above the heads of the multitude as the bearers walked, in mystic
  robe embroidered with the moon and stars, bordered gracefully with a fringe
  of real fruit and flowers, and with a glittering crown upon the head. The
  train of the procession consisted of the priests in long white vestments,
  close from head to foot, distributed into various groups, each bearing,
  exposed aloft, one of the sacred symbols of Isis&mdash;the corn-fan, the
  golden asp, the ivory hand of equity, and among them the votive ship itself,
  carved and gilt, and adorned bravely with flags flying. Last of all walked
  the high priest; the people kneeling as he passed to kiss his hand, in which
  were those well-remembered roses.</p>

  <p>Marius followed with the rest to the harbour, where the mystic ship,
  lowered from the shoulders of the priests, was loaded with as much as it
  could carry of the rich spices and other costly gifts, offered in great
  profusion by the worshippers, and thus, launched at last upon the water, left
  the shore, crossing the harbour-bar in the wake of a much stouter vessel than
  itself with a crew of white-robed mariners, whose [108] function it was, at
  the appointed moment, finally to desert it on the open sea.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the day was spent by most in parties on the water.
  Flavian and Marius sailed further than they had ever done before to a wild
  spot on the bay, the traditional site of a little Greek colony, which, having
  had its eager, stirring life at the time when Etruria was still a power in
  Italy, had perished in the age of the civil wars. In the absolute
  transparency of the air on this gracious day, an infinitude of detail from
  sea and shore reached the eye with sparkling clearness, as the two lads sped
  rapidly over the waves&mdash;Flavian at work suddenly, from time to time,
  with his tablets. They reached land at last. The coral fishers had spread
  their nets on the sands, with a tumble-down of quaint, many-hued treasures,
  below a little shrine of Venus, fluttering and gay with the scarves and
  napkins and gilded shells which these people had offered to the image.
  Flavian and Marius sat down under the shadow of a mass of gray rock or ruin,
  where the sea-gate of the Greek town had been, and talked of life in those
  old Greek colonies. Of this place, all that remained, besides those rude
  stones, was&mdash;a handful of silver coins, each with a head of pure and
  archaic beauty, though a little cruel perhaps, supposed to represent the
  Siren Ligeia, whose tomb was formerly shown here&mdash;only these, and an
  ancient song, the very strain which Flavian [109] had recovered in those last
  months. They were records which spoke, certainly, of the charm of life within
  those walls. How strong must have been the tide of men&rsquo;s existence in
  that little republican town, so small that this circle of gray stones, of
  service now only by the moisture they gathered for the blue-flowering
  gentians among them, had been the line of its rampart! An epitome of all that
  was liveliest, most animated and adventurous, in the old Greek people of
  which it was an offshoot, it had enhanced the effect of these gifts by
  concentration within narrow limits. The band of &ldquo;devoted
  youth,&rdquo;&mdash;<i>hiera neotes</i>&mdash;of the younger brothers,
  devoted to the gods and whatever luck the gods might afford, because there
  was no room for them at home&mdash;went forth, bearing the sacred flame from
  the mother hearth; itself a flame, of power to consume the whole material of
  existence in clear light and heat, with no smouldering residue. The life of
  those vanished townsmen, so brilliant and revolutionary, applying so
  abundantly the personal qualities which alone just then Marius seemed to
  value, associated itself with the actual figure of his companion, standing
  there before him, his face enthusiastic with the sudden thought of all that;
  and struck him vividly as precisely the fitting opportunity for a nature like
  his, so hungry for control, for ascendency over men.</p>

  <p>Marius noticed also, however, as high spirits [110] flagged at last, on
  the way home through the heavy dew of the evening, more than physical fatigue
  in Flavian, who seemed to find no refreshment in the coolness. There had been
  something feverish, perhaps, and like the beginning of sickness, about his
  almost forced gaiety, in this sudden spasm of spring; and by the evening of
  the next day he was lying with a burning spot on his forehead, stricken, as
  was thought from the first, by the terrible new disease.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap07"
     name="chap07"></a>VII. &mdash; A PAGAN END</h2>

  <p class="first">[111] FOR the fantastical colleague of the philosophic
  emperor Marcus Aurelius, returning in triumph from the East, had brought in
  his train, among the enemies of Rome, one by no means a captive. People
  actually sickened at a sudden touch of the unsuspected foe, as they watched
  in dense crowds the pathetic or grotesque imagery of failure or success in
  the triumphal procession. And, as usual, the plague brought with it a power
  to develop all pre-existent germs of superstition. It was by dishonour done
  to Apollo himself, said popular rumour&mdash;to Apollo, the old titular
  divinity of pestilence, that the poisonous thing had come abroad. Pent up in
  a golden coffer consecrated to the god, it had escaped in the sacrilegious
  plundering of his temple at Seleucia by the soldiers of Lucius Verus, after a
  traitorous surprise of that town and a cruel massacre. Certainly there was
  something which baffled all imaginable precautions and all medical science,
  in the suddenness [112] with which the disease broke out simultaneously, here
  and there, among both soldiers and citizens, even in places far remote from
  the main line of its march in the rear of the victorious army. It seemed to
  have invaded the whole empire, and some have even thought that, in a
  mitigated form, it permanently remained there. In Rome itself many thousands
  perished; and old authorities tell of farmsteads, whole towns, and even
  entire neighbourhoods, which from that time continued without inhabitants and
  lapsed into wildness or ruin.</p>

  <p>Flavian lay at the open window of his lodging, with a fiery pang in the
  brain, fancying no covering thin or light enough to be applied to his body.
  His head being relieved after a while, there was distress at the chest. It
  was but the fatal course of the strange new sickness, under many disguises;
  travelling from the brain to the feet, like a material resident, weakening
  one after another of the organic centres; often, when it did not kill,
  depositing various degrees of lifelong infirmity in this member or that; and
  after such descent, returning upwards again, now as a mortal coldness,
  leaving the entrenchments of the fortress of life overturned, one by one,
  behind it.</p>

  <p>Flavian lay there, with the enemy at his breast now in a painful cough,
  but relieved from that burning fever in the head, amid the rich-scented
  flowers&mdash;rare Paestum roses, and the like [113]&mdash;procured by Marius
  for his solace, in a fancied convalescence; and would, at intervals, return
  to labour at his verses, with a great eagerness to complete and transcribe
  the work, while Marius sat and wrote at his dictation, one of the latest but
  not the poorest specimens of genuine Latin poetry.</p>

  <p>It was in fact a kind of nuptial hymn, which, taking its start from the
  thought of nature as the universal mother, celebrated the preliminary pairing
  and mating together of all fresh things, in the hot and genial spring-
  time&mdash;the immemorial nuptials of the soul of spring itself and the brown
  earth; and was full of a delighted, mystic sense of what passed between them
  in that fantastic marriage. That mystic burden was relieved, at intervals, by
  the familiar playfulness of the Latin verse-writer in dealing with mythology,
  which, though coming at so late a day, had still a wonderful freshness in its
  old age.&mdash;&ldquo;Amor has put his weapons by and will keep holiday. He
  was bidden go without apparel, that none might be wounded by his bow and
  arrows. But take care! In truth he is none the less armed than usual, though
  he be all unclad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the expression of all this Flavian seemed, while making it his chief
  aim to retain the opulent, many-syllabled vocabulary of the Latin genius, at
  some points even to have advanced beyond it, in anticipation of wholly new
  laws of [114] taste as regards sound, a new range of sound itself. The
  peculiar resultant note, associating itself with certain other experiences of
  his, was to Marius like the foretaste of an entirely novel world of poetic
  beauty to come. Flavian had caught, indeed, something of the rhyming cadence,
  the sonorous organ-music of the medieval Latin, and therewithal something of
  its unction and mysticity of spirit. There was in his work, along with the
  last splendour of the classical language, a touch, almost prophetic, of that
  transformed life it was to have in the rhyming middle age, just about to
  dawn. The impression thus forced upon Marius connected itself with a feeling,
  the exact inverse of that, known to every one, which seems to say, You have
  been just here, just thus, before!&mdash;a feeling, in his case, not
  reminiscent but prescient of the future, which passed over him afterwards
  many times, as he came across certain places and people. It was as if he
  detected there the process of actual change to a wholly undreamed-of and
  renewed condition of human body and soul: as if he saw the heavy yet decrepit
  old Roman architecture about him, rebuilding on an intrinsically better
  pattern. Could it have been actually on a new musical instrument that Flavian
  had first heard the novel accents of his verse? And still Marius noticed
  there, amid all its richness of expression and imagery, that firmness of
  outline he had always relished so much in the composition of [115] Flavian.
  Yes! a firmness like that of some master of noble metal-work, manipulating
  tenacious bronze or gold. Even now that haunting refrain, with its impromptu
  variations, from the throats of those strong young men, came floating through
  the window.</p>

  <p class="poem">Cras amet qui nunquam amavit,<br>
  Quique amavit cras amet!</p>

  <p>&mdash;repeated Flavian, tremulously, dictating yet one stanza more.</p>

  <p>What he was losing, his freehold of a soul and body so fortunately
  endowed, the mere liberty of life above-ground, &ldquo;those sunny mornings
  in the cornfields by the sea,&rdquo; as he recollected them one day, when the
  window was thrown open upon the early freshness&mdash;his sense of all this,
  was from the first singularly near and distinct, yet rather as of something
  he was but debarred the use of for a time than finally bidding farewell to.
  That was while he was still with no very grave misgivings as to the issue of
  his sickness, and felt the sources of life still springing essentially
  unadulterate within him. From time to time, indeed, Marius, labouring eagerly
  at the poem from his dictation, was haunted by a feeling of the triviality of
  such work just then. The recurrent sense of some obscure danger beyond the
  mere danger of death, vaguer than that and by so much the more terrible, like
  the menace of some shadowy [116] adversary in the dark with whose mode of
  attack they had no acquaintance, disturbed him now and again through those
  hours of excited attention to his manuscript, and to the purely physical
  wants of Flavian. Still, during these three days there was much hope and
  cheerfulness, and even jesting. Half-consciously Marius tried to prolong one
  or another relieving circumstance of the day, the preparations for rest and
  morning refreshment, for instance; sadly making the most of the little luxury
  of this or that, with something of the feigned cheer of the mother who sets
  her last morsels before her famished child as for a feast, but really that he
  &ldquo;may eat it and die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the afternoon of the seventh day he allowed Marius finally to put aside
  the unfinished manuscript. For the enemy, leaving the chest quiet at length
  though much exhausted, had made itself felt with full power again in a
  painful vomiting, which seemed to shake his body asunder, with great
  consequent prostration. From that time the distress increased rapidly
  downwards. <i>Omnia tum vero vitai claustra lababant</i> (Lucretius, Book
  VI.1153); and soon the cold was mounting with sure pace from the dead feet to
  the head.</p>

  <p>And now Marius began more than to suspect what the issue must be, and
  henceforward could but watch with a sort of agonised fascination the rapid
  but systematic work of the destroyer, [117] faintly relieving a little the
  mere accidents of the sharper forms of suffering. Flavian himself appeared,
  in full consciousness at last&mdash;in clear-sighted, deliberate estimate of
  the actual crisis&mdash;to be doing battle with his adversary. His mind
  surveyed, with great distinctness, the various suggested modes of relief. He
  must without fail get better, he would fancy, might he be removed to a
  certain place on the hills where as a child he had once recovered from
  sickness, but found that he could scarcely raise his head from the pillow
  without giddiness. As if now surely foreseeing the end, he would set himself,
  with an eager effort, and with that eager and angry look, which is noted as
  one of the premonitions of death in this disease, to fashion out, without
  formal dictation, still a few more broken verses of his unfinished work, in
  hard-set determination, defiant of pain, to arrest this or that little drop
  at least from the river of sensuous imagery rushing so quickly past him.</p>

  <p>But at length delirium&mdash;symptom that the work of the plague was done,
  and the last resort of life yielding to the enemy&mdash;broke the coherent
  order of words and thoughts; and Marius, intent on the coming agony, found
  his best hope in the increasing dimness of the patient&rsquo;s mind. In
  intervals of clearer consciousness the visible signs of cold, of sorrow and
  desolation, were very painful. No longer battling with the disease, he seemed
  as it were to place himself [118] at the disposal of the victorious foe,
  dying passively, like some dumb creature, in hopeless acquiescence at last.
  That old, half-pleading petulance, unamiable, yet, as it might seem, only
  needing conditions of life a little happier than they had actually been, to
  become refinement of affection, a delicate grace in its demand on the
  sympathy of others, had changed in those moments of full intelligence to a
  clinging and tremulous gentleness, as he lay&mdash;&ldquo;on the very
  threshold of death&rdquo;&mdash;with a sharply contracted hand in the hand of
  Marius, to his almost surprised joy, winning him now to an absolutely
  self-forgetful devotion. There was a new sort of pleading in the misty eyes,
  just because they took such unsteady note of him, which made Marius feel as
  if guilty; anticipating thus a form of self-reproach with which even the
  tenderest ministrant may be sometimes surprised, when, at death, affectionate
  labour suddenly ceasing leaves room for the suspicion of some failure of love
  perhaps, at one or another minute point in it. Marius almost longed to take
  his share in the suffering, that he might understand so the better how to
  relieve it.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the light of the lamp distressed the patient, and Marius
  extinguished it. The thunder which had sounded all day among the hills, with
  a heat not unwelcome to Flavian, had given way at nightfall to steady rain;
  and [119] in the darkness Marius lay down beside him, faintly shivering now
  in the sudden cold, to lend him his own warmth, undeterred by the fear of
  contagion which had kept other people from passing near the house. At length
  about day- break he perceived that the last effort had come with a revival of
  mental clearness, as Marius understood by the contact, light as it was, in
  recognition of him there. &ldquo;Is it a comfort,&rdquo; he whispered then,
  &ldquo;that I shall often come and weep over you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not
  unless I be aware, and hear you weeping!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sun shone out on the people going to work for a long hot day, and
  Marius was standing by the dead, watching, with deliberate purpose to fix in
  his memory every detail, that he might have this picture in reserve, should
  any hour of forgetfulness hereafter come to him with the temptation to feel
  completely happy again. A feeling of outrage, of resentment against nature
  itself, mingled with an agony of pity, as he noted on the now placid features
  a certain look of humility, almost abject, like the expression of a smitten
  child or animal, as of one, fallen at last, after bewildering struggle,
  wholly under the power of a merciless adversary. From mere tenderness of soul
  he would not forget one circumstance in all that; as a man might piously
  stamp on his memory the death-scene of a brother wrongfully condemned to die,
  against a time that may come.</p>

  <p>[120] The fear of the corpse, which surprised him in his effort to watch
  by it through the darkness, was a hint of his own failing strength, just in
  time. The first night after the washing of the body, he bore stoutly enough
  the tax which affection seemed to demand, throwing the incense from time to
  time on the little altar placed beside the bier. It was the recurrence of the
  thing&mdash;that unchanged outline below the coverlet, amid a silence in
  which the faintest rustle seemed to speak&mdash;that finally overcame his
  determination. Surely, here, in this alienation, this sense of distance
  between them, which had come over him before though in minor degree when the
  mind of Flavian had wandered in his sickness, was another of the pains of
  death. Yet he was able to make all due preparations, and go through the
  ceremonies, shortened a little because of the infection, when, on a cloudless
  evening, the funeral procession went forth; himself, the flames of the pyre
  having done their work, carrying away the urn of the deceased, in the folds
  of his toga, to its last resting-place in the cemetery beside the highway,
  and so turning home to sleep in his own desolate lodging.</p>

  <p class="cp">The Emperor Hadrian to his Soul</p>

  <p class="first">[123] FLAVIAN was no more. The little marble chest with its
  dust and tears lay cold among the faded flowers. For most people the actual
  spectacle of death brings out into greater reality, at least for the
  imagination, whatever confidence they may entertain of the soul&rsquo;s
  survival in another life. To Marius, greatly agitated by that event, the
  earthly end of Flavian came like a final revelation of nothing less than the
  soul&rsquo;s extinction. Flavian had gone out as utterly as the fire among
  those still beloved ashes. Even that wistful suspense of judgment expressed
  by the dying Hadrian, regarding further stages of being still possible for
  the soul in some dim journey hence, seemed wholly untenable, and, with it,
  almost all that remained of the religion of his childhood. Future extinction
  seemed just then [124] to be what the unforced witness of his own nature
  pointed to. On the other hand, there came a novel curiosity as to what the
  various schools of ancient philosophy had had to say concerning that strange,
  fluttering creature; and that curiosity impelled him to certain severe
  studies, in which his earlier religious conscience seemed still to survive,
  as a principle of hieratic scrupulousness or integrity of thought, regarding
  this new service to intellectual light.</p>

  <p>At this time, by his poetic and inward temper, he might have fallen a prey
  to the enervating mysticism, then in wait for ardent souls in many a
  melodramatic revival of old religion or theosophy. From all this, fascinating
  as it might actually be to one side of his character, he was kept by a
  genuine virility there, effective in him, among other results, as a hatred of
  what was theatrical, and the instinctive recognition that in vigorous
  intelligence, after all, divinity was most likely to be found a resident.
  With this was connected the feeling, increasing with his advance to manhood,
  of a poetic beauty in mere clearness of thought, the actually aesthetic charm
  of a cold austerity of mind; as if the kinship of that to the clearness of
  physical light were something more than a figure of speech. Of all those
  various religious fantasies, as so many forms of enthusiasm, he could well
  appreciate the picturesque; that was made easy by his natural Epicureanism,
  already prompting [125] him to conceive of himself as but the passive
  spectator of the world around him. But it was to the severer reasoning, of
  which such matters as Epicurean theory are born, that, in effect, he now
  betook himself. Instinctively suspicious of those mechanical arcana, those
  pretended &ldquo;secrets unveiled&rdquo; of the professional mystic, which
  really bring great and little souls to one level, for Marius the only
  possible dilemma lay between that old, ancestral Roman religion, now become
  so incredible to him and the honest action of his own untroubled, unassisted
  intelligence. Even the Arcana Celestia of Platonism&mdash;what the sons of
  Plato had had to say regarding the essential indifference of pure soul to its
  bodily house and merely occasional dwelling-place&mdash;seemed to him while
  his heart was there in the urn with the material ashes of Flavian, or still
  lingering in memory over his last agony, wholly inhuman or morose, as tending
  to alleviate his resentment at nature&rsquo;s wrong. It was to the sentiment
  of the body, and the affections it defined&mdash;the flesh, of whose force
  and colour that wandering Platonic soul was but so frail a residue or
  abstract&mdash;he must cling. The various pathetic traits of the beloved,
  suffering, perished body of Flavian, so deeply pondered, had made him a
  materialist, but with something of the temper of a devotee.</p>

  <p>As a consequence it might have seemed at first that his care for poetry
  had passed away, [126] to be replaced by the literature of thought. His much-
  pondered manuscript verses were laid aside; and what happened now to one, who
  was certainly to be something of a poet from first to last, looked at the
  moment like a change from poetry to prose. He came of age about this time,
  his own master though with beardless face; and at eighteen, an age at which,
  then as now, many youths of capacity, who fancied themselves poets, secluded
  themselves from others chiefly in affectation and vague dreaming, he secluded
  himself indeed from others, but in a severe intellectual meditation, that
  salt of poetry, without which all the more serious charm is lacking to the
  imaginative world. Still with something of the old religious earnestness of
  his childhood, he set himself&mdash;Sich im Denken zu orientiren&mdash;to
  determine his bearings, as by compass, in the world of thought&mdash;to get
  that precise acquaintance with the creative intelligence itself, its
  structure and capacities, its relation to other parts of himself and to other
  things, without which, certainly, no poetry can be masterly. Like a young man
  rich in this world&rsquo;s goods coming of age, he must go into affairs, and
  ascertain his outlook. There must be no disguises. An exact estimate of
  realities, as towards himself, he must have&mdash;a delicately measured
  gradation of certainty in things&mdash;from the distant, haunted horizon of
  mere surmise or imagination, to the actual [127] feeling of sorrow in his
  heart, as he reclined one morning, alone instead of in pleasant company, to
  ponder the hard sayings of an imperfect old Greek manuscript, unrolled beside
  him. His former gay companions, meeting him in the streets of the old Italian
  town, and noting the graver lines coming into the face of the sombre but
  enthusiastic student of intellectual structure, who could hold his own so
  well in the society of accomplished older men, were half afraid of him,
  though proud to have him of their company. Why this reserve?&mdash;they
  asked, concerning the orderly, self-possessed youth, whose speech and
  carriage seemed so carefully measured, who was surely no poet like the rapt,
  dishevelled Lupus. Was he secretly in love, perhaps, whose toga was so
  daintily folded, and who was always as fresh as the flowers he wore; or bent
  on his own line of ambition: or even on riches?</p>

  <p>Marius, meantime, was reading freely, in early morning for the most part,
  those writers chiefly who had made it their business to know what might be
  thought concerning that strange, enigmatic, personal essence, which had
  seemed to go out altogether, along with the funeral fires. And the old Greek
  who more than any other was now giving form to his thoughts was a very hard
  master. From Epicurus, from the thunder and lightning of Lucretius&mdash;like
  thunder and lightning some distance off, one might recline to enjoy, in a
  garden of roses&mdash;he had gone back to [128] the writer who was in a
  certain sense the teacher of both, Heraclitus of Ionia. His difficult book
  &ldquo;Concerning Nature&rdquo; was even then rare, for people had long since
  satisfied themselves by the quotation of certain brilliant, isolated, oracles
  only, out of what was at best a taxing kind of lore. But the difficulty of
  the early Greek prose did but spur the curiosity of Marius; the writer, the
  superior clearness of whose intellectual view had so sequestered him from
  other men, who had had so little joy of that superiority, being avowedly
  exacting as to the amount of devout attention he required from the student.
  &ldquo;The many,&rdquo; he said, always thus emphasising the difference
  between the many and the few, are &ldquo;like people heavy with wine,&rdquo;
  &ldquo;led by children,&rdquo; &ldquo;knowing not whither they go;&rdquo; and
  yet, &ldquo;much learning doth not make wise;&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;the
  ass, after all, would have his thistles rather than fine gold.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Heraclitus, indeed, had not under-rated the difficulty for &ldquo;the
  many&rdquo; of the paradox with which his doctrine begins, and the due
  reception of which must involve a denial of habitual impressions, as the
  necessary first step in the way of truth. His philosophy had been developed
  in conscious, outspoken opposition to the current mode of thought, as a
  matter requiring some exceptional loyalty to pure reason and its &ldquo;dry
  light.&rdquo; Men are subject to an illusion, he protests, regarding matters
  apparent to sense. [129] What the uncorrected sense gives was a false
  impression of permanence or fixity in things, which have really changed their
  nature in the very moment in which we see and touch them. And the radical
  flaw in the current mode of thinking would lie herein: that, reflecting this
  false or uncorrected sensation, it attributes to the phenomena of experience
  a durability which does not really belong to them. Imaging forth from those
  fluid impressions a world of firmly out-lined objects, it leads one to regard
  as a thing stark and dead what is in reality full of animation, of vigour, of
  the fire of life&mdash;that eternal process of nature, of which at a later
  time Goethe spoke as the &ldquo;Living Garment,&rdquo; whereby God is seen of
  us, ever in weaving at the &ldquo;Loom of Time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And the appeal which the old Greek thinker made was, in the first
  instance, from confused to unconfused sensation; with a sort of prophetic
  seriousness, a great claim and assumption, such as we may understand, if we
  anticipate in this preliminary scepticism the ulterior scope of his
  speculation, according to which the universal movement of all natural things
  is but one particular stage, or measure, of that ceaseless activity wherein
  the divine reason consists. The one true being&mdash;that constant subject of
  all early thought&mdash;it was his merit to have conceived, not as sterile
  and stagnant inaction, but as a perpetual energy, from the restless stream of
  which, [130] at certain points, some elements detach themselves, and harden
  into non-entity and death, corresponding, as outward objects, to man&rsquo;s
  inward condition of ignorance: that is, to the slowness of his faculties. It
  is with this paradox of a subtle, perpetual change in all visible things,
  that the high speculation of Heraclitus begins. Hence the scorn he expresses
  for anything like a careless, half-conscious, &ldquo;use-and-wont&rdquo;
  reception of our experience, which took so strong a hold on men&rsquo;s
  memories! Hence those many precepts towards a strenuous self-consciousness in
  all we think and do, that loyalty to cool and candid reason, which makes
  strict attentiveness of mind a kind of religious duty and service.</p>

  <p>The negative doctrine, then, that the objects of our ordinary experience,
  fixed as they seem, are really in perpetual change, had been, as originally
  conceived, but the preliminary step towards a large positive system of almost
  religious philosophy. Then as now, the illuminated philosophic mind might
  apprehend, in what seemed a mass of lifeless matter, the movement of that
  universal life, in which things, and men&rsquo;s impressions of them, were
  ever &ldquo;coming to be,&rdquo; alternately consumed and renewed. That
  continual change, to be discovered by the attentive understanding where
  common opinion found fixed objects, was but the indicator of a subtler but
  all-pervading motion&mdash;the sleepless, ever-sustained, inexhaustible
  energy of the divine [131] reason itself, proceeding always by its own
  rhythmical logic, and lending to all mind and matter, in turn, what life they
  had. In this &ldquo;perpetual flux&rdquo; of things and of souls, there was,
  as Heraclitus conceived, a continuance, if not of their material or spiritual
  elements, yet of orderly intelligible relationships, like the harmony of
  musical notes, wrought out in and through the series of their
  mutations&mdash;ordinances of the divine reason, maintained throughout the
  changes of the phenomenal world; and this harmony in their mutation and
  opposition, was, after all, a principle of sanity, of reality, there. But it
  happened, that, of all this, the first, merely sceptical or negative step,
  that easiest step on the threshold, had alone remained in general memory; and
  the &ldquo;doctrine of motion&rdquo; seemed to those who had felt its
  seduction to make all fixed knowledge impossible. The swift passage of
  things, the still swifter passage of those modes of our conscious being which
  seemed to reflect them, might indeed be the burning of the divine fire: but
  what was ascertained was that they did pass away like a devouring flame, or
  like the race of water in the mid- stream&mdash;too swiftly for any real
  knowledge of them to be attainable. Heracliteanism had grown to be almost
  identical with the famous doctrine of the sophist Protagoras, that the
  momentary, sensible apprehension of the individual was the only standard of
  what is or is [132] not, and each one the measure of all things to himself.
  The impressive name of Heraclitus had become but an authority for a
  philosophy of the despair of knowledge.</p>

  <p>And as it had been with his original followers in Greece, so it happened
  now with the later Roman disciple. He, too, paused at the apprehension of
  that constant motion of things&mdash;the drift of flowers, of little or great
  souls, of ambitious systems, in the stream around him, the first source, the
  ultimate issue, of which, in regions out of sight, must count with him as but
  a dim problem. The bold mental flight of the old Greek master from the
  fleeting, competing objects of experience to that one universal life, in
  which the whole sphere of physical change might be reckoned as but a single
  pulsation, remained by him as hypothesis only&mdash;the hypothesis he
  actually preferred, as in itself most credible, however scantily realisable
  even by the imagination&mdash;yet still as but one unverified hypothesis,
  among many others, concerning the first principle of things. He might reserve
  it as a fine, high, visionary consideration, very remote upon the
  intellectual ladder, just at the point, indeed, where that ladder seemed to
  pass into the clouds, but for which there was certainly no time left just now
  by his eager interest in the real objects so close to him, on the lowlier
  earthy steps nearest the ground. And those childish days of reverie, [133]
  when he played at priests, played in many another day-dream, working his way
  from the actual present, as far as he might, with a delightful sense of
  escape in replacing the outer world of other people by an inward world as
  himself really cared to have it, had made him a kind of
  &ldquo;idealist.&rdquo; He was become aware of the possibility of a large
  dissidence between an inward and somewhat exclusive world of vivid personal
  apprehension, and the unimproved, unheightened reality of the life of those
  about him. As a consequence, he was ready now to concede, somewhat more
  easily than others, the first point of his new lesson, that the individual is
  to himself the measure of all things, and to rely on the exclusive certainty
  to himself of his own impressions. To move afterwards in that outer world of
  other people, as though taking it at their estimate, would be possible
  henceforth only as a kind of irony. And as with the Vicaire Savoyard, after
  reflecting on the variations of philosophy, &ldquo;the first fruit he drew
  from that reflection was the lesson of a limitation of his researches to what
  immediately interested him; to rest peacefully in a profound ignorance as to
  all beside; to disquiet himself only concerning those things which it was of
  import for him to know.&rdquo; At least he would entertain no theory of
  conduct which did not allow its due weight to this primary element of
  incertitude or negation, in the conditions of man&rsquo;s life. [134] Just
  here he joined company, retracing in his individual mental pilgrimage the
  historic order of human thought, with another wayfarer on the journey,
  another ancient Greek master, the founder of the Cyrenaic philosophy, whose
  weighty traditional utterances (for he had left no writing) served in turn to
  give effective outline to the contemplations of Marius. There was something
  in the doctrine itself congruous with the place wherein it had its birth; and
  for a time Marius lived much, mentally, in the brilliant Greek colony which
  had given a dubious name to the philosophy of pleasure. It hung, for his
  fancy, between the mountains and the sea, among richer than Italian gardens,
  on a certain breezy table-land projecting from the African coast, some
  hundreds of miles southward from Greece. There, in a delightful climate, with
  something of transalpine temperance amid its luxury, and withal in an inward
  atmosphere of temperance which did but further enhance the brilliancy of
  human life, the school of Cyrene had maintained itself as almost one with the
  family of its founder; certainly as nothing coarse or unclean, and under the
  influence of accomplished women.</p>

  <p>Aristippus of Cyrene too had left off in suspense of judgment as to what
  might really lie behind&mdash;flammantia moenia mundi: the flaming ramparts
  of the world. Those strange, bold, sceptical surmises, which had haunted the
  minds [135] of the first Greek enquirers as merely abstract doubt, which had
  been present to the mind of Heraclitus as one element only in a system of
  abstract philosophy, became with Aristippus a very subtly practical
  worldly-wisdom. The difference between him and those obscure earlier thinkers
  is almost like that between an ancient thinker generally, and a modern man of
  the world: it was the difference between the mystic in his cell, or the
  prophet in the desert, and the expert, cosmopolitan, administrator of his
  dark sayings, translating the abstract thoughts of the master into terms,
  first of all, of sentiment. It has been sometimes seen, in the history of the
  human mind, that when thus translated into terms of sentiment&mdash;of
  sentiment, as lying already half-way towards practice&mdash;the abstract
  ideas of metaphysics for the first time reveal their true significance. The
  metaphysical principle, in itself, as it were, without hands or feet, becomes
  impressive, fascinating, of effect, when translated into a precept as to how
  it were best to feel and act; in other words, under its sentimental or
  ethical equivalent. The leading idea of the great master of Cyrene, his
  theory that things are but shadows, and that we, even as they, never continue
  in one stay, might indeed have taken effect as a languid, enervating,
  consumptive nihilism, as a precept of &ldquo;renunciation,&rdquo; which would
  touch and handle and busy itself with nothing. But in the reception of [136]
  metaphysical formulae, all depends, as regards their actual and ulterior
  result, on the pre-existent qualities of that soil of human nature into which
  they fall--the company they find already present there, on their admission
  into the house of thought; there being at least so much truth as this
  involves in the theological maxim, that the reception of this or that
  speculative conclusion is really a matter of will. The persuasion that all is
  vanity, with this happily constituted Greek, who had been a genuine disciple
  of Socrates and reflected, presumably, something of his blitheness in the
  face of the world, his happy way of taking all chances, generated neither
  frivolity nor sourness, but induced, rather, an impression, just serious
  enough, of the call upon men&rsquo;s attention of the crisis in which they
  find themselves. It became the stimulus towards every kind of activity, and
  prompted a perpetual, inextinguishable thirst after experience.</p>

  <p>With Marius, then, the influence of the philosopher of pleasure depended
  on this, that in him an abstract doctrine, originally somewhat acrid, had
  fallen upon a rich and genial nature, well fitted to transform it into a
  theory of practice, of considerable stimulative power towards a fair life.
  What Marius saw in him was the spectacle of one of the happiest temperaments
  coming, so to speak, to an understanding with the most depressing of
  theories; accepting the [137] results of a metaphysical system which seemed
  to concentrate into itself all the weakening trains of thought in earlier
  Greek speculation, and making the best of it; turning its hard, bare truths,
  with wonderful tact, into precepts of grace, and delicate wisdom, and a
  delicate sense of honour. Given the hardest terms, supposing our days are
  indeed but a shadow, even so, we may well adorn and beautify, in scrupulous
  self-respect, our souls, and whatever our souls touch upon&mdash;these
  wonderful bodies, these material dwelling- places through which the shadows
  pass together for a while, the very raiment we wear, our very pastimes and
  the intercourse of society. The most discerning judges saw in him something
  like the graceful &ldquo;humanities&rdquo; of the later Roman, and our modern
  &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; as it is termed; while Horace recalled his sayings as
  expressing best his own consummate amenity in the reception of life.</p>

  <p>In this way, for Marius, under the guidance of that old master of decorous
  living, those eternal doubts as to the criteria of truth reduced themselves
  to a scepticism almost drily practical, a scepticism which developed the
  opposition between things as they are and our impressions and thoughts
  concerning them&mdash;the possibility, if an outward world does really exist,
  of some faultiness in our apprehension of it&mdash;the doctrine, in short, of
  what is termed &ldquo;the subjectivity of knowledge.&rdquo; That is a
  consideration, indeed, [138] which lies as an element of weakness, like some
  admitted fault or flaw, at the very foundation of every philosophical account
  of the universe; which confronts all philosophies at their starting, but with
  which none have really dealt conclusively, some perhaps not quite sincerely;
  which those who are not philosophers dissipate by &ldquo;common,&rdquo; but
  unphilosophical, sense, or by religious faith. The peculiar strength of
  Marius was, to have apprehended this weakness on the threshold of human
  knowledge, in the whole range of its consequences. Our knowledge is limited
  to what we feel, he reflected: we need no proof that we feel. But can we be
  sure that things are at all like our feelings? Mere peculiarities in the
  instruments of our cognition, like the little knots and waves on the surface
  of a mirror, may distort the matter they seem but to represent. Of other
  people we cannot truly know even the feelings, nor how far they would
  indicate the same modifications, each one of a personality really unique, in
  using the same terms as ourselves; that &ldquo;common experience,&rdquo;
  which is sometimes proposed as a satisfactory basis of certainty, being after
  all only a fixity of language. But our own impressions!&mdash;The light and
  heat of that blue veil over our heads, the heavens spread out, perhaps not
  like a curtain over anything!&mdash;How reassuring, after so long a debate
  about the rival criteria of truth, to fall back upon direct sensation, to
  limit one&rsquo;s [139] aspirations after knowledge to that! In an age still
  materially so brilliant, so expert in the artistic handling of material
  things, with sensible capacities still in undiminished vigour, with the whole
  world of classic art and poetry outspread before it, and where there was more
  than eye or ear could well take in&mdash;how natural the determination to
  rely exclusively upon the phenomena of the senses, which certainly never
  deceive us about themselves, about which alone we can never deceive
  ourselves!</p>

  <p>And so the abstract apprehension that the little point of this present
  moment alone really is, between a past which has just ceased to be and a
  future which may never come, became practical with Marius, under the form of
  a resolve, as far as possible, to exclude regret and desire, and yield
  himself to the improvement of the present with an absolutely disengaged mind.
  America is here and now--here, or nowhere: as Wilhelm Meister finds out one
  day, just not too late, after so long looking vaguely across the ocean for
  the opportunity of the development of his capacities. It was as if,
  recognising in perpetual motion the law of nature, Marius identified his own
  way of life cordially with it, &ldquo;throwing himself into the
  stream,&rdquo; so to speak. He too must maintain a harmony with that soul of
  motion in things, by constantly renewed mobility of character.</p>

  <p>Omnis Aristippum decuit color et status et res.&mdash;</p>

  <p>[140] Thus Horace had summed up that perfect manner in the reception of
  life attained by his old Cyrenaic master; and the first practical consequence
  of the metaphysic which lay behind that perfect manner, had been a strict
  limitation, almost the renunciation, of metaphysical enquiry itself.
  Metaphysic&mdash;that art, as it has so often proved, in the words of
  Michelet, de s&rsquo;egarer avec methode, of bewildering oneself
  methodically:&mdash;one must spend little time upon that! In the school of
  Cyrene, great as was its mental incisiveness, logical and physical
  speculation, theoretic interests generally, had been valued only so far as
  they served to give a groundwork, an intellectual justification, to that
  exclusive concern with practical ethics which was a note of the Cyrenaic
  philosophy. How earnest and enthusiastic, how true to itself, under how many
  varieties of character, had been the effort of the Greeks after
  Theory&mdash;Theoria&mdash;that vision of a wholly reasonable world, which,
  according to the greatest of them, literally makes man like God: how loyally
  they had still persisted in the quest after that, in spite of how many
  disappointments! In the Gospel of Saint John, perhaps, some of them might
  have found the kind of vision they were seeking for; but not in
  &ldquo;doubtful disputations&rdquo; concerning &ldquo;being&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;not being,&rdquo; knowledge and appearance. Men&rsquo;s minds, even
  young men&rsquo;s minds, at that late day, might well seem oppressed by the
  weariness of systems which [141] had so far outrun positive knowledge; and in
  the mind of Marius, as in that old school of Cyrene, this sense of ennui,
  combined with appetites so youthfully vigorous, brought about reaction, a
  sort of suicide (instances of the like have been seen since) by which a great
  metaphysical acumen was devoted to the function of proving metaphysical
  speculation impossible, or useless. Abstract theory was to be valued only
  just so far as it might serve to clear the tablet of the mind from
  suppositions no more than half realisable, or wholly visionary, leaving it in
  flawless evenness of surface to the impressions of an experience, concrete
  and direct.</p>

  <p>To be absolutely virgin towards such experience, by ridding ourselves of
  such abstractions as are but the ghosts of bygone impressions&mdash;to be rid
  of the notions we have made for ourselves, and that so often only
  misrepresent the experience of which they profess to be the
  representation&mdash;idola, idols, false appearances, as Bacon calls them
  later&mdash;to neutralise the distorting influence of metaphysical system by
  an all-accomplished metaphysic skill: it is this bold, hard, sober
  recognition, under a very &ldquo;dry light,&rdquo; of its own proper aim, in
  union with a habit of feeling which on the practical side may perhaps open a
  wide doorway to human weakness, that gives to the Cyrenaic doctrine, to
  reproductions of this doctrine in the time of Marius or in our own, their
  gravity and importance. It was a [142] school to which the young man might
  come, eager for truth, expecting much from philosophy, in no ignoble
  curiosity, aspiring after nothing less than an &ldquo;initiation.&rdquo; He
  would be sent back, sooner or later, to experience, to the world of concrete
  impressions, to things as they may be seen, heard, felt by him; but with a
  wonderful machinery of observation, and free from the tyranny of mere
  theories.</p>

  <p>So, in intervals of repose, after the agitation which followed the death
  of Flavian, the thoughts of Marius ran, while he felt himself as if returned
  to the fine, clear, peaceful light of that pleasant school of healthfully
  sensuous wisdom, in the brilliant old Greek colony, on its fresh upland by
  the sea. Not pleasure, but a general completeness of life, was the practical
  ideal to which this anti-metaphysical metaphysic really pointed. And towards
  such a full or complete life, a life of various yet select sensation, the
  most direct and effective auxiliary must be, in a word, Insight. Liberty of
  soul, freedom from all partial and misrepresentative doctrine which does but
  relieve one element in our experience at the cost of another, freedom from
  all embarrassment alike of regret for the past and of calculation on the
  future: this would be but preliminary to the real business of
  education&mdash;insight, insight through culture, into all that the present
  moment holds in trust for us, as we stand so briefly in its presence. From
  that maxim of [143] Life as the end of life, followed, as a practical
  consequence, the desirableness of refining all the instruments of inward and
  outward intuition, of developing all their capacities, of testing and
  exercising one&rsquo;s self in them, till one&rsquo;s whole nature became one
  complex medium of reception, towards the vision&mdash;the &ldquo;beatific
  vision,&rdquo; if we really cared to make it such&mdash;of our actual
  experience in the world. Not the conveyance of an abstract body of truths or
  principles, would be the aim of the right education of one&rsquo;s self, or
  of another, but the conveyance of an art&mdash;an art in some degree peculiar
  to each individual character; with the modifications, that is, due to its
  special constitution, and the peculiar circumstances of its growth, inasmuch
  as no one of us is &ldquo;like another, all in all.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap09"
     name="chap09"></a>IX. &mdash; NEW CYRENAICISM</h2>

  <p class="first">[144] SUCH were the practical conclusions drawn for himself
  by Marius, when somewhat later he had outgrown the mastery of others, from
  the principle that &ldquo;all is vanity.&rdquo; If he could but count upon
  the present, if a life brief at best could not certainly be shown to conduct
  one anywhere beyond itself, if men&rsquo;s highest curiosity was indeed so
  persistently baffled&mdash;then, with the Cyrenaics of all ages, he would at
  least fill up the measure of that present with vivid sensations, and such
  intellectual apprehensions, as, in strength and directness and their
  immediately realised values at the bar of an actual experience, are most like
  sensations. So some have spoken in every age; for, like all theories which
  really express a strong natural tendency of the human mind or even one of its
  characteristic modes of weakness, this vein of reflection is a constant
  tradition in philosophy. Every age of European thought has had its Cyrenaics
  or Epicureans, under many disguises: even under the hood of the monk.</p>

  <p>[145] But&mdash;Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die!&mdash;is a
  proposal, the real import of which differs immensely, according to the
  natural taste, and the acquired judgment, of the guests who sit at the table.
  It may express nothing better than the instinct of Dante&rsquo;s Ciacco, the
  accomplished glutton, in the mud of the Inferno; or, since on no hypothesis
  does man &ldquo;live by bread alone,&rdquo; may come to be identical
  with&mdash;&ldquo;My meat is to do what is just and kind;&rdquo; while the
  soul, which can make no sincere claim to have apprehended anything beyond the
  veil of immediate experience, yet never loses a sense of happiness in
  conforming to the highest moral ideal it can clearly define for itself; and
  actually, though but with so faint hope, does the &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s
  business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In that age of Marcus Aurelius, so completely disabused of the
  metaphysical ambition to pass beyond &ldquo;the flaming ramparts of the
  world,&rdquo; but, on the other hand, possessed of so vast an accumulation of
  intellectual treasure, with so wide a view before it over all varieties of
  what is powerful or attractive in man and his works, the thoughts of Marius
  did but follow the line taken by the majority of educated persons, though to
  a different issue. Pitched to a really high and serious key, the
  precept&mdash;Be perfect in regard to what is here and now: the precept of
  &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; as it is called, or of a complete
  education&mdash;might at least save him from the vulgarity and heaviness
  [146] of a generation, certainly of no general fineness of temper, though
  with a material well-being abundant enough. Conceded that what is secure in
  our existence is but the sharp apex of the present moment between two
  hypothetical eternities, and all that is real in our experience but a series
  of fleeting impressions:&mdash;so Marius continued the sceptical argument he
  had condensed, as the matter to hold by, from his various philosophical
  reading:&mdash;given, that we are never to get beyond the walls of the
  closely shut cell of one&rsquo;s own personality; that the ideas we are
  somehow impelled to form of an outer world, and of other minds akin to our
  own, are, it may be, but a day-dream, and the thought of any world beyond, a
  day-dream perhaps idler still: then, he, at least, in whom those fleeting
  impressions&mdash;faces, voices, material sunshine&mdash;were very real and
  imperious, might well set himself to the consideration, how such actual
  moments as they passed might be made to yield their utmost, by the most
  dexterous training of capacity. Amid abstract metaphysical doubts, as to what
  might lie one step only beyond that experience, reinforcing the deep original
  materialism or earthliness of human nature itself, bound so intimately to the
  sensuous world, let him at least make the most of what was &ldquo;here and
  now.&rdquo; In the actual dimness of ways from means to ends&mdash;ends in
  themselves desirable, yet for the most part distant and for him, certainly,
  below the [147] visible horizon&mdash;he would at all events be sure that the
  means, to use the well-worn terminology, should have something of finality or
  perfection about them, and themselves partake, in a measure, of the more
  excellent nature of ends&mdash;that the means should justify the end.</p>

  <p>With this view he would demand culture, <i>paideia</i>, (upbringing,
  education), as the Cyrenaics said, or, in other words, a wide, a complete,
  education&mdash;an education partly negative, as ascertaining the true limits
  of man&rsquo;s capacities, but for the most part positive, and directed
  especially to the expansion and refinement of the power of reception; of
  those powers, above all, which are immediately relative to fleeting
  phenomena, the powers of emotion and sense. In such an education, an
  &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; education, as it might now be termed, and certainly
  occupied very largely with those aspects of things which affect us
  pleasurably through sensation, art, of course, including all the finer sorts
  of literature, would have a great part to play. The study of music, in that
  wider Platonic sense, according to which, music comprehends all those matters
  over which the Muses of Greek mythology preside, would conduct one to an
  exquisite appreciation of all the finer traits of nature and of man. Nay! the
  products of the imagination must themselves be held to present the most
  perfect forms of life&mdash;spirit and matter alike under their purest and
  most perfect conditions&mdash;the most strictly appropriate [148] objects of
  that impassioned contemplation, which, in the world of intellectual
  discipline, as in the highest forms of morality and religion, must be held to
  be the essential function of the &ldquo;perfect.&rdquo; Such manner of life
  might come even to seem a kind of religion&mdash;an inward, visionary, mystic
  piety, or religion, by virtue of its effort to live days &ldquo;lovely and
  pleasant&rdquo; in themselves, here and now, and with an all-sufficiency of
  well-being in the immediate sense of the object contemplated, independently
  of any faith, or hope that might be entertained as to their ulterior
  tendency. In this way, the true aesthetic culture would be realisable as a
  new form of the contemplative life, founding its claim on the intrinsic
  &ldquo;blessedness&rdquo; of &ldquo;vision&rdquo;&mdash;the vision of perfect
  men and things. One&rsquo;s human nature, indeed, would fain reckon on an
  assured and endless future, pleasing itself with the dream of a final home,
  to be attained at some still remote date, yet with a conscious, delightful
  home- coming at last, as depicted in many an old poetic Elysium. On the other
  hand, the world of perfected sensation, intelligence, emotion, is so close to
  us, and so attractive, that the most visionary of spirits must needs
  represent the world unseen in colours, and under a form really borrowed from
  it. Let me be sure then&mdash;might he not plausibly say?&mdash;that I miss
  no detail of this life of realised consciousness in the present! Here at
  least is a vision, a theory, [149] <i>theoria</i>, which reposes on no basis
  of unverified hypothesis, which makes no call upon a future after all
  somewhat problematic; as it would be unaffected by any discovery of an
  Empedocles (improving on the old story of Prometheus) as to what had really
  been the origin, and course of development, of man&rsquo;s actually attained
  faculties and that seemingly divine particle of reason or spirit in him. Such
  a doctrine, at more leisurable moments, would of course have its precepts to
  deliver on the embellishment, generally, of what is near at hand, on the
  adornment of life, till, in a not impracticable rule of conduct, one&rsquo;s
  existence, from day to day, came to be like a well-executed piece of music;
  that &ldquo;perpetual motion&rdquo; in things (so Marius figured the matter
  to himself, under the old Greek imageries) according itself to a kind of
  cadence or harmony.</p>

  <p>It was intelligible that this &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; philosophy might
  find itself (theoretically, at least, and by way of a curious question in
  casuistry, legitimate from its own point of view) weighing the claims of that
  eager, concentrated, impassioned realisation of experience, against those of
  the received morality. Conceiving its own function in a somewhat desperate
  temper, and becoming, as every high-strung form of sentiment, as the
  religious sentiment itself, may become, somewhat antinomian, when, in its
  effort towards the order of experiences it prefers, it is confronted with the
  traditional and popular [150] morality, at points where that morality may
  look very like a convention, or a mere stage-property of the world, it would
  be found, from time to time, breaking beyond the limits of the actual moral
  order; perhaps not without some pleasurable excitement in so bold a
  venture.</p>

  <p>With the possibility of some such hazard as this, in thought or even in
  practice&mdash;that it might be, though refining, or tonic even, in the case
  of those strong and in health, yet, as Pascal says of the kindly and
  temperate wisdom of Montaigne, &ldquo;pernicious for those who have any
  natural tendency to impiety or vice,&rdquo; the line of reflection traced out
  above, was fairly chargeable.&mdash;Not, however, with &ldquo;hedonism&rdquo;
  and its supposed consequences. The blood, the heart, of Marius were still
  pure. He knew that his carefully considered theory of practice braced him,
  with the effect of a moral principle duly recurring to mind every morning,
  towards the work of a student, for which he might seem intended. Yet there
  were some among his acquaintance who jumped to the conclusion that, with the
  &ldquo;Epicurean stye,&rdquo; he was making pleasure&mdash;pleasure, as they
  so poorly conceived it&mdash;the sole motive of life; and they precluded any
  exacter estimate of the situation by covering it with a high-sounding general
  term, through the vagueness of which they were enabled to see the severe and
  laborious youth in the vulgar company of Lais. Words like
  &ldquo;hedonism&rdquo;&mdash;[151] terms of large and vague
  comprehension&mdash;above all when used for a purpose avowedly controversial,
  have ever been the worst examples of what are called &ldquo;question-begging
  terms;&rdquo; and in that late age in which Marius lived, amid the dust of so
  many centuries of philosophical debate, the air was full of them. Yet those
  who used that reproachful Greek term for the philosophy of pleasure, were
  hardly more likely than the old Greeks themselves (on whom regarding this
  very subject of the theory of pleasure, their masters in the art of thinking
  had so emphatically to impress the necessity of &ldquo;making
  distinctions&rdquo;) to come to any very delicately correct ethical
  conclusions by a reasoning, which began with a general term, comprehensive
  enough to cover pleasures so different in quality, in their causes and
  effects, as the pleasures of wine and love, of art and science, of religious
  enthusiasm and political enterprise, and of that taste or curiosity which
  satisfied itself with long days of serious study. Yet, in truth, each of
  those pleasurable modes of activity, may, in its turn, fairly become the
  ideal of the &ldquo;hedonistic&rdquo; doctrine. Really, to the phase of
  reflection through which Marius was then passing, the charge of
  &ldquo;hedonism,&rdquo; whatever its true weight might be, was not properly
  applicable at all. Not pleasure, but fulness of life, and
  &ldquo;insight&rdquo; as conducting to that fulness&mdash;energy, variety,
  and choice of experience, including [152] noble pain and sorrow even, loves
  such as those in the exquisite old story of Apuleius, sincere and strenuous
  forms of the moral life, such as Seneca and Epictetus&mdash;whatever form of
  human life, in short, might be heroic, impassioned, ideal: from these the
  &ldquo;new Cyrenaicism&rdquo; of Marius took its criterion of values. It was
  a theory, indeed, which might properly be regarded as in great degree
  coincident with the main principle of the Stoics themselves, and an older
  version of the precept &ldquo;Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with
  thy might&rdquo;&mdash;a doctrine so widely acceptable among the nobler
  spirits of that time. And, as with that, its mistaken tendency would lie in
  the direction of a kind of idolatry of mere life, or natural gift, or
  strength&mdash;l&rsquo;idolatrie des talents.</p>

  <p>To understand the various forms of ancient art and thought, the various
  forms of actual human feeling (the only new thing, in a world almost too
  opulent in what was old) to satisfy, with a kind of scrupulous equity, the
  claims of these concrete and actual objects on his sympathy, his
  intelligence, his senses&mdash;to &ldquo;pluck out the heart of their
  mystery,&rdquo; and in turn become the interpreter of them to others: this
  had now defined itself for Marius as a very narrowly practical design: it
  determined his choice of a vocation to live by. It was the era of the
  rhetoricians, or sophists, as they were sometimes called; of men who came in
  some instances to [153] great fame and fortune, by way of a literary
  cultivation of &ldquo;science.&rdquo; That science, it has been often said,
  must have been wholly an affair of words. But in a world, confessedly so
  opulent in what was old, the work, even of genius, must necessarily consist
  very much in criticism; and, in the case of the more excellent specimens of
  his class, the rhetorician was, after all, the eloquent and effective
  interpreter, for the delighted ears of others, of what understanding himself
  had come by, in years of travel and study, of the beautiful house of art and
  thought which was the inheritance of the age. The emperor Marcus Aurelius, to
  whose service Marius had now been called, was himself, more or less openly, a
  &ldquo;lecturer.&rdquo; That late world, amid many curiously vivid modern
  traits, had this spectacle, so familiar to ourselves, of the public lecturer
  or essayist; in some cases adding to his other gifts that of the Christian
  preacher, who knows how to touch people&rsquo;s sensibilities on behalf of
  the suffering. To follow in the way of these successes, was the natural
  instinct of youthful ambition; and it was with no vulgar egotism that Marius,
  at the age of nineteen, determined, like many another young man of parts, to
  enter as a student of rhetoric at Rome.</p>

  <p>Though the manner of his work was changed formally from poetry to prose,
  he remained, and must always be, of the poetic temper: by which, I mean,
  among other things, that quite [154] independently of the general habit of
  that pensive age he lived much, and as it were by system, in reminiscence.
  Amid his eager grasping at the sensation, the consciousness, of the present,
  he had come to see that, after all, the main point of economy in the conduct
  of the present, was the question:&mdash;How will it look to me, at what shall
  I value it, this day next year?&mdash;that in any given day or month
  one&rsquo;s main concern was its impression for the memory. A strange trick
  memory sometimes played him; for, with no natural gradation, what was of last
  month, or of yesterday, of to-day even, would seem as far off, as entirely
  detached from him, as things of ten years ago. Detached from him, yet very
  real, there lay certain spaces of his life, in delicate perspective, under a
  favourable light; and, somehow, all the less fortunate detail and
  circumstance had parted from them. Such hours were oftenest those in which he
  had been helped by work of others to the pleasurable apprehension of art, of
  nature, or of life. &ldquo;Not what I do, but what I am, under the power of
  this vision&rdquo;&mdash;he would say to himself&mdash;&ldquo;is what were
  indeed pleasing to the gods!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And yet, with a kind of inconsistency in one who had taken for his
  philosophic ideal the <i>monochronos hedone</i> of Aristippus&mdash;the
  pleasure of the ideal present, of the mystic now&mdash;there would come,
  together with that precipitate sinking of things into the past, a desire,
  after all, [155] to retain &ldquo;what was so transitive.&rdquo; Could he but
  arrest, for others also, certain clauses of experience, as the imaginative
  memory presented them to himself! In those grand, hot summers, he would have
  imprisoned the very perfume of the flowers. To create, to live, perhaps, a
  little while beyond the allotted hours, if it were but in a fragment of
  perfect expression:&mdash;it was thus his longing defined itself for
  something to hold by amid the &ldquo;perpetual flux.&rdquo; With men of his
  vocation, people were apt to say, words were things. Well! with him, words
  should be indeed things,&mdash;the word, the phrase, valuable in exact
  proportion to the transparency with which it conveyed to others the
  apprehension, the emotion, the mood, so vividly real within himself.
  <i>Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur</i> (The subject once
  foreknown, the words will follow easily&mdash;Horace, <i>Ars Poetica</i>
  311): Virile apprehension of the true nature of things, of the true nature of
  one&rsquo;s own impression, first of all!&mdash;words would follow that
  naturally, a true understanding of one&rsquo;s self being ever the first
  condition of genuine style. Language delicate and measured, the delicate
  Attic phrase, for instance, in which the eminent Aristeides could speak, was
  then a power to which people&rsquo;s hearts, and sometimes even their purses,
  readily responded. And there were many points, as Marius thought, on which
  the heart of that age greatly needed to be touched. He hardly knew how strong
  that old religious sense of responsibility, the conscience, as we call it,
  [156] still was within him&mdash;a body of inward impressions, as real as
  those so highly valued outward ones&mdash;to offend against which, brought
  with it a strange feeling of disloyalty, as to a person. And the
  determination, adhered to with no misgiving, to add nothing, not so much as a
  transient sigh, to the great total of men&rsquo;s unhappiness, in his way
  through the world:&mdash;that too was something to rest on, in the drift of
  mere &ldquo;appearances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All this would involve a life of industry, of industrious study, only
  possible through healthy rule, keeping clear the eye alike of body and soul.
  For the male element, the logical conscience asserted itself now, with
  opening manhood&mdash;asserted itself, even in his literary style, by a
  certain firmness of outline, that touch of the worker in metal, amid its
  richness. Already he blamed instinctively alike in his work and in himself,
  as youth so seldom does, all that had not passed a long and liberal process
  of erasure. The happy phrase or sentence was really modelled upon a cleanly
  finished structure of scrupulous thought. The suggestive force of the one
  master of his development, who had battled so hard with imaginative prose;
  the utterance, the golden utterance, of the other, so content with its living
  power of persuasion that he had never written at all,&mdash;in the commixture
  of these two qualities he set up his literary ideal, and this rare blending
  of grace with an intellectual [157] rigour or astringency, was the secret of
  a singular expressiveness in it.</p>

  <p>He acquired at this time a certain bookish air, the somewhat sombre
  habitude of the avowed scholar, which though it never interfered with the
  perfect tone, &ldquo;fresh and serenely disposed,&rdquo; of the Roman
  gentleman, yet qualified it as by an interesting oblique trait, and
  frightened away some of his equals in age and rank. The sober discretion of
  his thoughts, his sustained habit of meditation, the sense of those negative
  conclusions enabling him to concentrate himself, with an absorption so
  entire, upon what is immediately here and now, gave him a peculiar manner of
  intellectual confidence, as of one who had indeed been initiated into a great
  secret.&mdash;Though with an air so disengaged, he seemed to be living so
  intently in the visible world! And now, in revolt against that pre-occupation
  with other persons, which had so often perturbed his spirit, his wistful
  speculations as to what the real, the greater, experience might be,
  determined in him, not as the longing for love&mdash;to be with Cynthia, or
  Aspasia&mdash;but as a thirst for existence in exquisite places. The veil
  that was to be lifted for him lay over the works of the old masters of art,
  in places where nature also had used her mastery. And it was just at this
  moment that a summons to Rome reached him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10"></a>X. &mdash; ON THE WAY</h2>

  <p class="cp"><i>Mirum est ut animus agitatione motuque corporis
  excitetur.</i><br>
  Pliny&rsquo;s Letters.</p>

  <p class="first">[158] MANY points in that train of thought, its harder and
  more energetic practical details especially, at first surmised but vaguely in
  the intervals of his visits to the tomb of Flavian, attained the coherence of
  formal principle amid the stirring incidents of the journey, which took him,
  still in all the buoyancy of his nineteen years and greatly expectant, to
  Rome. That summons had come from one of the former friends of his father in
  the capital, who had kept himself acquainted with the lad&rsquo;s progress,
  and, assured of his parts, his courtly ways, above all of his beautiful
  penmanship, now offered him a place, virtually that of an amanuensis, near
  the person of the philosophic emperor. The old town-house of his family on
  the Caelian hill, so long neglected, might well require his personal care;
  and Marius, relieved a little by his preparations for travelling from a
  certain over-tension [159] of spirit in which he had lived of late, was
  presently on his way, to await introduction to Aurelius, on his expected
  return home, after a first success, illusive enough as it was soon to appear,
  against the invaders from beyond the Danube.</p>

  <p>The opening stage of his journey, through the firm, golden weather, for
  which he had lingered three days beyond the appointed time of
  starting&mdash;days brown with the first rains of autumn&mdash;brought him,
  by the byways among the lower slopes of the Apennines of Luna, to the town of
  Luca, a station on the Cassian Way; travelling so far mainly on foot, while
  the baggage followed under the care of his attendants. He wore a broad felt
  hat, in fashion not unlike a more modern pilgrim&rsquo;s, the neat head
  projecting from the collar of his gray paenula, or travelling mantle, sewed
  closely together over the breast, but with its two sides folded up upon the
  shoulders, to leave the arms free in walking, and was altogether so trim and
  fresh, that, as he climbed the hill from Pisa, by the long steep lane through
  the olive-yards, and turned to gaze where he could just discern the cypresses
  of the old school garden, like two black lines down the yellow walls, a
  little child took possession of his hand, and, looking up at him with entire
  confidence, paced on bravely at his side, for the mere pleasure of his
  company, to the spot where the road declined again [160] into the valley
  beyond. From this point, leaving the servants behind, he surrendered himself,
  a willing subject, as he walked, to the impressions of the road, and was
  almost surprised, both at the suddenness with which evening came on, and the
  distance from his old home at which it found him.</p>

  <p>And at the little town of Luca, he felt that indescribable sense of a
  welcoming in the mere outward appearance of things, which seems to mark out
  certain places for the special purpose of evening rest, and gives them always
  a peculiar amiability in retrospect. Under the deepening twilight, the rough-
  tiled roofs seem to huddle together side by side, like one continuous shelter
  over the whole township, spread low and broad above the snug sleeping-rooms
  within; and the place one sees for the first time, and must tarry in but for
  a night, breathes the very spirit of home. The cottagers lingered at their
  doors for a few minutes as the shadows grew larger, and went to rest early;
  though there was still a glow along the road through the shorn corn-fields,
  and the birds were still awake about the crumbling gray heights of an old
  temple. So quiet and air-swept was the place, you could hardly tell where the
  country left off in it, and the field-paths became its streets. Next morning
  he must needs change the manner of his journey. The light baggage-wagon
  returned, and he proceeded now more quickly, travelling [161] a stage or two
  by post, along the Cassian Way, where the figures and incidents of the great
  high-road seemed already to tell of the capital, the one centre to which all
  were hastening, or had lately bidden adieu. That Way lay through the heart of
  the old, mysterious and visionary country of Etruria; and what he knew of its
  strange religion of the dead, reinforced by the actual sight of the funeral
  houses scattered so plentifully among the dwelling-places of the living,
  revived in him for a while, in all its strength, his old instinctive yearning
  towards those inhabitants of the shadowy land he had known in life. It seemed
  to him that he could half divine how time passed in those painted houses on
  the hillsides, among the gold and silver ornaments, the wrought armour and
  vestments, the drowsy and dead attendants; and the close consciousness of
  that vast population gave him no fear, but rather a sense of companionship,
  as he climbed the hills on foot behind the horses, through the genial
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>The road, next day, passed below a town not less primitive, it might seem,
  than its rocky perch&mdash;white rocks, that had long been glistening before
  him in the distance. Down the dewy paths the people were descending from it,
  to keep a holiday, high and low alike in rough, white-linen smocks. A homely
  old play was just begun in an open-air theatre, with seats hollowed out of
  the turf-grown slope. Marius [162] caught the terrified expression of a child
  in its mother&rsquo;s arms, as it turned from the yawning mouth of a great
  mask, for refuge in her bosom. The way mounted, and descended again, down the
  steep street of another place, all resounding with the noise of metal under
  the hammer; for every house had its brazier&rsquo;s workshop, the bright
  objects of brass and copper gleaming, like lights in a cave, out of their
  dark roofs and corners. Around the anvils the children were watching the
  work, or ran to fetch water to the hissing, red-hot metal; and Marius too
  watched, as he took his hasty mid-day refreshment, a mess of chestnut-meal
  and cheese, while the swelling surface of a great copper water-vessel grew
  flowered all over with tiny petals under the skilful strokes. Towards dusk, a
  frantic woman at the roadside, stood and cried out the words of some philter,
  or malison, in verse, with weird motion of her hands, as the travellers
  passed, like a wild picture drawn from Virgil.</p>

  <p>But all along, accompanying the superficial grace of these incidents of
  the way, Marius noted, more and more as he drew nearer to Rome, marks of the
  great plague. Under Hadrian and his successors, there had been many
  enactments to improve the condition of the slave. The <i>ergastula</i>
  (work-prisons for slaves and debtors) and were abolished. But no system of
  free labour had as yet succeeded. A whole mendicant population, artfully
  exaggerating every symptom and circumstance of misery, still hung [163]
  around, or sheltered themselves within, the vast walls of their old, half-
  ruined task-houses. And for the most part they had been variously stricken by
  the pestilence. For once, the heroic level had been reached in rags, squints,
  scars&mdash;every caricature of the human type&mdash;ravaged beyond what
  could have been thought possible if it were to survive at all. Meantime, the
  farms were less carefully tended than of old: here and there they were
  lapsing into their natural wildness: some villas also were partly fallen into
  ruin. The picturesque, romantic Italy of a later time&mdash;the Italy of
  Claude and Salvator Rosa&mdash;was already forming, for the delight of the
  modern romantic traveller.</p>

  <p>And again Marius was aware of a real change in things, on crossing the
  Tiber, as if some magic effect lay in that; though here, in truth, the Tiber
  was but a modest enough stream of turbid water. Nature, under the richer sky,
  seemed readier and more affluent, and man fitter to the conditions around
  him: even in people hard at work there appeared to be a less burdensome sense
  of the mere business of life. How dreamily the women were passing up through
  the broad light and shadow of the steep streets with the great water-pots
  resting on their heads, like women of Caryae, set free from slavery in old
  Greek temples. With what a fresh, primeval poetry was daily existence here
  impressed&mdash;all the details of the threshing-floor and the vineyard;
  [164] the common farm-life even; the great bakers&rsquo; fires aglow upon the
  road in the evening. In the presence of all this Marius felt for a moment
  like those old, early, unconscious poets, who created the famous Greek myths
  of Dionysus, and the Great Mother, out of the imagery of the wine-press and
  the ploughshare. And still the motion of the journey was bringing his
  thoughts to systematic form. He seemed to have grown to the fulness of
  intellectual manhood, on his way hither. The formative and literary stimulus,
  so to call it, of peaceful exercise which he had always observed in himself,
  doing its utmost now, the form and the matter of thought alike detached
  themselves clearly and with readiness from the healthfully excited
  brain.&mdash;&ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; says Pliny, &ldquo;how the mind
  is stirred to activity by brisk bodily exercise.&rdquo; The presentable
  aspects of inmost thought and feeling became evident to him: the structure of
  all he meant, its order and outline, defined itself: his general sense of a
  fitness and beauty in words became effective in daintily pliant sentences,
  with all sorts of felicitous linking of figure to abstraction. It seemed just
  then as if the desire of the artist in him&mdash;that old longing to
  produce&mdash;might be satisfied by the exact and literal transcript of what
  was then passing around him, in simple prose, arresting the desirable moment
  as it passed, and prolonging its life a little.&mdash;To live in the
  concrete! To be sure, at least, of [165] one&rsquo;s hold upon
  that!&mdash;Again, his philosophic scheme was but the reflection of the data
  of sense, and chiefly of sight, a reduction to the abstract, of the brilliant
  road he travelled on, through the sunshine.</p>

  <p>But on the seventh evening there came a reaction in the cheerful flow of
  our traveller&rsquo;s thoughts, a reaction with which mere bodily fatigue,
  asserting itself at last over his curiosity, had much to do; and he fell into
  a mood, known to all passably sentimental wayfarers, as night deepens again
  and again over their path, in which all journeying, from the known to the
  unknown, comes suddenly to figure as a mere foolish truancy&mdash;like a
  child&rsquo;s running away from home&mdash;with the feeling that one had best
  return at once, even through the darkness. He had chosen to climb on foot, at
  his leisure, the long windings by which the road ascended to the place where
  that day&rsquo;s stage was to end, and found himself alone in the twilight,
  far behind the rest of his travelling-companions. Would the last zigzag,
  round and round those dark masses, half natural rock, half artificial
  substructure, ever bring him within the circuit of the walls above? It was
  now that a startling incident turned those misgivings almost into actual
  fear. From the steep slope a heavy mass of stone was detached, after some
  whisperings among the trees above his head, and rushing down through the
  stillness fell to pieces in a [166] cloud of dust across the road just behind
  him, so that he felt the touch upon his heel. That was sufficient, just then,
  to rouse out of its hiding-place his old vague fear of evil&mdash;of
  one&rsquo;s &ldquo;enemies&rdquo;&mdash;a distress, so much a matter of
  constitution with him, that at times it would seem that the best pleasures of
  life could but be snatched, as it were hastily, in one moment&rsquo;s
  forgetfulness of its dark, besetting influence. A sudden suspicion of hatred
  against him, of the nearness of &ldquo;enemies,&rdquo; seemed all at once to
  alter the visible form of things, as with the child&rsquo;s hero, when he
  found the footprint on the sand of his peaceful, dreamy island. His elaborate
  philosophy had not put beneath his feet the terror of mere bodily evil; much
  less of &ldquo;inexorable fate, and the noise of greedy Acheron.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The resting-place to which he presently came, in the keen, wholesome air
  of the market-place of the little hill-town, was a pleasant contrast to that
  last effort of his journey. The room in which he sat down to supper, unlike
  the ordinary Roman inns at that day, was trim and sweet. The firelight danced
  cheerfully upon the polished, three-wicked lucernae burning cleanly with the
  best oil, upon the white-washed walls, and the bunches of scarlet carnations
  set in glass goblets. The white wine of the place put before him, of the true
  colour and flavour of the grape, and with a ring of delicate foam as it
  mounted in the cup, had a reviving edge or freshness he had [167] found in no
  other wine. These things had relieved a little the melancholy of the hour
  before; and it was just then that he heard the voice of one, newly arrived at
  the inn, making his way to the upper floor&mdash;a youthful voice, with a
  reassuring clearness of note, which completed his cure.</p>

  <p>He seemed to hear that voice again in dreams, uttering his name: then,
  awake in the full morning light and gazing from the window, saw the guest of
  the night before, a very honourable-looking youth, in the rich habit of a
  military knight, standing beside his horse, and already making preparations
  to depart. It happened that Marius, too, was to take that day&rsquo;s journey
  on horseback. Riding presently from the inn, he overtook Cornelius&mdash;of
  the Twelfth Legion&mdash;advancing carefully down the steep street; and
  before they had issued from the gates of Urbs-vetus, the two young men had
  broken into talk together. They were passing along the street of the
  goldsmiths; and Cornelius must needs enter one of the workshops for the
  repair of some button or link of his knightly trappings. Standing in the
  doorway, Marius watched the work, as he had watched the brazier&rsquo;s
  business a few days before, wondering most at the simplicity of its
  processes, a simplicity, however, on which only genius in that craft could
  have lighted.&mdash;By what unguessed-at stroke of hand, for instance, had
  the grains of precious metal associated themselves [168] with so daintily
  regular a roughness, over the surface of the little casket yonder? And the
  conversation which followed, hence arising, left the two travellers with
  sufficient interest in each other to insure an easy companionship for the
  remainder of their journey. In time to come, Marius was to depend very much
  on the preferences, the personal judgments, of the comrade who now laid his
  hand so brotherly on his shoulder, as they left the workshop.</p>

  <p><i>Itineris matutini gratiam capimus</i>,+&mdash;observes one of our
  scholarly travellers (Apuleius, <i>The Golden Ass</i>, I.17.); and their road
  that day lay through a country, well- fitted, by the peculiarity of its
  landscape, to ripen a first acquaintance into intimacy; its superficial
  ugliness throwing the wayfarers back upon each other&rsquo;s entertainment in
  a real exchange of ideas, the tension of which, however, it would relieve,
  ever and anon, by the unexpected assertion of something singularly
  attractive. The immediate aspect of the land was, indeed, in spite of
  abundant olive and ilex, unpleasing enough. A river of clay seemed, &ldquo;in
  some old night of time,&rdquo; to have burst up over valley and hill, and
  hardened there into fantastic shelves and slides and angles of cadaverous
  rock, up and down among the contorted vegetation; the hoary roots and trunks
  seeming to confess some weird kinship with them. But that was long ago; and
  these pallid hillsides needed only the declining sun, touching the rock with
  purple, and throwing deeper shadow into [169] the immemorial foliage, to put
  on a peculiar, because a very grave and austere, kind of beauty; while the
  graceful outlines common to volcanic hills asserted themselves in the broader
  prospect. And, for sentimental Marius, all this was associated, by some
  perhaps fantastic affinity, with a peculiar trait of severity, beyond his
  guesses as to the secret of it, which mingled with the blitheness of his new
  companion. Concurring, indeed, with the condition of a Roman soldier, it was
  certainly something far more than the expression of military hardness, or
  ascesis; and what was earnest, or even austere, in the landscape they had
  traversed together, seemed to have been waiting for the passage of this
  figure to interpret or inform it. Again, as in his early days with Flavian, a
  vivid personal presence broke through the dreamy idealism, which had almost
  come to doubt of other men&rsquo;s reality: reassuringly, indeed, yet not
  without some sense of a constraining tyranny over him from without.</p>

  <p>For Cornelius, returning from the campaign, to take up his quarters on the
  Palatine, in the imperial guard, seemed to carry about with him, in that
  privileged world of comely usage to which he belonged, the atmosphere of some
  still more jealously exclusive circle. They halted on the morrow at noon, not
  at an inn, but at the house of one of the young soldier&rsquo;s friends, whom
  they found absent, indeed, in consequence of the [170] plague in those parts,
  so that after a mid-day rest only, they proceeded again on their journey. The
  great room of the villa, to which they were admitted, had lain long
  untouched; and the dust rose, as they entered, into the slanting bars of
  sunlight, that fell through the half-closed shutters. It was here, to while
  away the time, that Cornelius bethought himself of displaying to his new
  friend the various articles and ornaments of his knightly array&mdash;the
  breastplate, the sandals and cuirass, lacing them on, one by one, with the
  assistance of Marius, and finally the great golden bracelet on the right arm,
  conferred on him by his general for an act of valour. And as he gleamed
  there, amid that odd interchange of light and shade, with the staff of a
  silken standard firm in his hand, Marius felt as if he were face to face, for
  the first time, with some new knighthood or chivalry, just then coming into
  the world.</p>

  <p>It was soon after they left this place, journeying now by carriage, that
  Rome was seen at last, with much excitement on the part of our travellers;
  Cornelius, and some others of whom the party then consisted, agreeing,
  chiefly for the sake of Marius, to hasten forward, that it might be reached
  by daylight, with a cheerful noise of rapid wheels as they passed over the
  flagstones. But the highest light upon the mausoleum of Hadrian was quite
  gone out, and it was dark, before they reached the Flaminian Gate. The [171]
  abundant sound of water was the one thing that impressed Marius, as they
  passed down a long street, with many open spaces on either hand: Cornelius to
  his military quarters, and Marius to the old dwelling-place of his
  fathers.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11"></a>XI. &mdash; &ldquo;THE MOST RELIGIOUS CITY IN THE
     WORLD&rdquo;</h2>

  <p class="first">[172] MARIUS awoke early and passed curiously from room to
  room, noting for more careful inspection by and by the rolls of manuscripts.
  Even greater than his curiosity in gazing for the first time on this ancient
  possession, was his eagerness to look out upon Rome itself, as he pushed back
  curtain and shutter, and stepped forth in the fresh morning upon one of the
  many balconies, with an oft-repeated dream realised at last. He was certainly
  fortunate in the time of his coming to Rome. That old pagan world, of which
  Rome was the flower, had reached its perfection in the things of poetry and
  art&mdash;a perfection which indicated only too surely the eve of decline. As
  in some vast intellectual museum, all its manifold products were intact and
  in their places, and with custodians also still extant, duly qualified to
  appreciate and explain them. And at no period of history had the material
  Rome itself been better worth seeing&mdash;lying there not less consummate
  than that world of [173] pagan intellect which it represented in every phase
  of its darkness and light. The various work of many ages fell here
  harmoniously together, as yet untouched save by time, adding the final grace
  of a rich softness to its complex expression. Much which spoke of ages
  earlier than Nero, the great re-builder, lingered on, antique, quaint,
  immeasurably venerable, like the relics of the medieval city in the Paris of
  Lewis the Fourteenth: the work of Nero&rsquo;s own time had come to have that
  sort of old world and picturesque interest which the work of Lewis has for
  ourselves; while without stretching a parallel too far we might perhaps liken
  the architectural finesses of the archaic Hadrian to the more excellent
  products of our own Gothic revival. The temple of Antoninus and Faustina was
  still fresh in all the majesty of its closely arrayed columns of cipollino;
  but, on the whole, little had been added under the late and present emperors,
  and during fifty years of public quiet, a sober brown and gray had grown
  apace on things. The gilding on the roof of many a temple had lost its
  garishness: cornice and capital of polished marble shone out with all the
  crisp freshness of real flowers, amid the already mouldering travertine and
  brickwork, though the birds had built freely among them. What Marius then saw
  was in many respects, after all deduction of difference, more like the modern
  Rome than the enumeration of particular losses [174] might lead us to
  suppose; the Renaissance, in its most ambitious mood and with amplest
  resources, having resumed the ancient classical tradition there, with no
  break or obstruction, as it had happened, in any very considerable work of
  the middle age. Immediately before him, on the square, steep height, where
  the earliest little old Rome had huddled itself together, arose the palace of
  the Caesars. Half-veiling the vast substruction of rough, brown
  stone&mdash;line upon line of successive ages of builders&mdash;the trim,
  old-fashioned garden walks, under their closely- woven walls of dark glossy
  foliage, test of long and careful cultivation, wound gradually, among choice
  trees, statues and fountains, distinct and sparkling in the full morning
  sunlight, to the richly tinted mass of pavilions and corridors above,
  centering in the lofty, white-marble dwelling-place of Apollo himself.</p>

  <p>How often had Marius looked forward to that first, free wandering through
  Rome, to which he now went forth with a heat in the town sunshine (like a
  mist of fine gold-dust spread through the air) to the height of his desire,
  making the dun coolness of the narrow streets welcome enough at intervals. He
  almost feared, descending the stair hastily, lest some unforeseen accident
  should snatch the little cup of enjoyment from him ere he passed the door. In
  such morning rambles in places new to him, [175] life had always seemed to
  come at its fullest: it was then he could feel his youth, that youth the days
  of which he had already begun to count jealously, in entire possession. So
  the grave, pensive figure, a figure, be it said nevertheless, fresher far
  than often came across it now, moved through the old city towards the
  lodgings of Cornelius, certainly not by the most direct course, however eager
  to rejoin the friend of yesterday.</p>

  <p>Bent as keenly on seeing as if his first day in Rome were to be also his
  last, the two friends descended along the Vicus Tuscus, with its rows of
  incense-stalls, into the Via Nova, where the fashionable people were busy
  shopping; and Marius saw with much amusement the frizzled heads, then a la
  mode. A glimpse of the Marmorata, the haven at the river-side, where
  specimens of all the precious marbles of the world were lying amid great
  white blocks from the quarries of Luna, took his thoughts for a moment to his
  distant home. They visited the flower-market, lingering where the coronarii
  pressed on them the newest species, and purchased zinias, now in blossom
  (like painted flowers, thought Marius), to decorate the folds of their togas.
  Loitering to the other side of the Forum, past the great Galen&rsquo;s
  drug-shop, after a glance at the announcements of new poems on sale attached
  to the doorpost of a famous bookseller, they entered the curious [176]
  library of the Temple of Peace, then a favourite resort of literary men, and
  read, fixed there for all to see, the Diurnal or Gazette of the day, which
  announced, together with births and deaths, prodigies and accidents, and much
  mere matter of business, the date and manner of the philosophic
  emperor&rsquo;s joyful return to his people; and, thereafter, with eminent
  names faintly disguised, what would carry that day&rsquo;s news, in many
  copies, over the provinces&mdash;a certain matter concerning the great lady,
  known to be dear to him, whom he had left at home. It was a story, with the
  development of which &ldquo;society&rdquo; had indeed for some time past
  edified or amused itself, rallying sufficiently from the panic of a year ago,
  not only to welcome back its ruler, but also to relish a chronique
  scandaleuse; and thus, when soon after Marius saw the world&rsquo;s wonder,
  he was already acquainted with the suspicions which have ever since hung
  about her name. Twelve o&rsquo;clock was come before they left the Forum,
  waiting in a little crowd to hear the Accensus, according to old custom,
  proclaim the hour of noonday, at the moment when, from the steps of the
  Senate- house, the sun could be seen standing between the Rostra and the
  Graecostasis. He exerted for this function a strength of voice, which
  confirmed in Marius a judgment the modern visitor may share with him, that
  Roman throats and Roman chests, namely, must, in some peculiar way, be
  differently [177] constructed from those of other people. Such judgment
  indeed he had formed in part the evening before, noting, as a religious
  procession passed him, how much noise a man and a boy could make, though not
  without a great deal of real music, of which in truth the Romans were then as
  ever passionately fond.</p>

  <p>Hence the two friends took their way through the Via Flaminia, almost
  along the line of the modern Corso, already bordered with handsome villas,
  turning presently to the left, into the Field-of-Mars, still the playground
  of Rome. But the vast public edifices were grown to be almost continuous over
  the grassy expanse, represented now only by occasional open spaces of verdure
  and wild-flowers. In one of these a crowd was standing, to watch a party of
  athletes stripped for exercise. Marius had been surprised at the luxurious
  variety of the litters borne through Rome, where no carriage horses were
  allowed; and just then one far more sumptuous than the rest, with dainty
  appointments of ivory and gold, was carried by, all the town pressing with
  eagerness to get a glimpse of its most beautiful woman, as she passed
  rapidly. Yes! there, was the wonder of the world&mdash;the empress Faustina
  herself: Marius could distinguish, could distinguish clearly, the well-known
  profile, between the floating purple curtains.</p>

  <p>For indeed all Rome was ready to burst into gaiety again, as it awaited
  with much real [178] affection, hopeful and animated, the return of its
  emperor, for whose ovation various adornments were preparing along the
  streets through which the imperial procession would pass. He had left Rome
  just twelve months before, amid immense gloom. The alarm of a barbarian
  insurrection along the whole line of the Danube had happened at the moment
  when Rome was panic- stricken by the great pestilence.</p>

  <p>In fifty years of peace, broken only by that conflict in the East from
  which Lucius Verus, among other curiosities, brought back the plague, war had
  come to seem a merely romantic, superannuated incident of bygone history. And
  now it was almost upon Italian soil. Terrible were the reports of the numbers
  and audacity of the assailants. Aurelius, as yet untried in war, and
  understood by a few only in the whole scope of a really great character, was
  known to the majority of his subjects as but a careful administrator, though
  a student of philosophy, perhaps, as we say, a dilettante. But he was also
  the visible centre of government, towards whom the hearts of a whole people
  turned, grateful for fifty years of public happiness&mdash;its good genius,
  its &ldquo;Antonine&rdquo;&mdash;whose fragile person might be foreseen
  speedily giving way under the trials of military life, with a disaster like
  that of the slaughter of the legions by Arminius. Prophecies of the
  world&rsquo;s impending conflagration were easily credited: &ldquo;the
  secular fire&rdquo; would descend from [179] heaven: superstitious fear had
  even demanded the sacrifice of a human victim.</p>

  <p>Marcus Aurelius, always philosophically considerate of the humours of
  other people, exercising also that devout appreciation of every religious
  claim which was one of his characteristic habits, had invoked, in aid of the
  commonwealth, not only all native gods, but all foreign deities as well,
  however strange.&mdash;&ldquo;Help! Help! in the ocean space!&rdquo; A
  multitude of foreign priests had been welcomed to Rome, with their various
  peculiar religious rites. The sacrifices made on this occasion were
  remembered for centuries; and the starving poor, at least, found some
  satisfaction in the flesh of those herds of &ldquo;white bulls,&rdquo; which
  came into the city, day after day, to yield the savour of their blood to the
  gods.</p>

  <p>In spite of all this, the legions had but followed their standards
  despondently. But prestige, personal prestige, the name of
  &ldquo;Emperor,&rdquo; still had its magic power over the nations. The mere
  approach of the Roman army made an impression on the barbarians. Aurelius and
  his colleague had scarcely reached Aquileia when a deputation arrived to ask
  for peace. And now the two imperial &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; were returning
  home at leisure; were waiting, indeed, at a villa outside the walls, till the
  capital had made ready to receive them. But although Rome was thus in genial
  reaction, with much relief, [180] and hopefulness against the winter, facing
  itself industriously in damask of red and gold, those two enemies were still
  unmistakably extant: the barbarian army of the Danube was but over-awed for a
  season; and the plague, as we saw when Marius was on his way to Rome, was not
  to depart till it had done a large part in the formation of the melancholy
  picturesque of modern Italy&mdash;till it had made, or prepared for the
  making of the Roman Campagna. The old, unaffected, really pagan, peace or
  gaiety, of Antoninus Pius&mdash;that genuine though unconscious
  humanist&mdash;was gone for ever. And again and again, throughout this day of
  varied observation, Marius had been reminded, above all else, that he was not
  merely in &ldquo;the most religious city of the world,&rdquo; as one had
  said, but that Rome was become the romantic home of the wildest superstition.
  Such superstition presented itself almost as religious mania in many an
  incident of his long ramble,&mdash;incidents to which he gave his full
  attention, though contending in some measure with a reluctance on the part of
  his companion, the motive of which he did not understand till long
  afterwards. Marius certainly did not allow this reluctance to deter his own
  curiosity. Had he not come to Rome partly under poetic vocation, to receive
  all those things, the very impress of life itself, upon the visual, the
  imaginative, organ, as upon a mirror; to reflect them; to transmute them
  [181] into golden words? He must observe that strange medley of superstition,
  that centuries&rsquo; growth, layer upon layer, of the curiosities of
  religion (one faith jostling another out of place) at least for its
  picturesque interest, and as an indifferent outsider might, not too deeply
  concerned in the question which, if any of them, was to be the survivor.</p>

  <p>Superficially, at least, the Roman religion, allying itself with much
  diplomatic economy to possible rivals, was in possession, as a vast and
  complex system of usage, intertwining itself with every detail of public and
  private life, attractively enough for those who had but &ldquo;the historic
  temper,&rdquo; and a taste for the past, however much a Lucian might
  depreciate it. Roman religion, as Marius knew, had, indeed, been always
  something to be done, rather than something to be thought, or believed, or
  loved; something to be done in minutely detailed manner, at a particular time
  and place, correctness in which had long been a matter of laborious learning
  with a whole school of ritualists&mdash;as also, now and again, a matter of
  heroic sacrifice with certain exceptionally devout souls, as when Caius
  Fabius Dorso, with his life in his hand, succeeded in passing the sentinels
  of the invading Gauls to perform a sacrifice on the Quirinal, and, thanks to
  the divine protection, had returned in safety. So jealous was the distinction
  between sacred and profane, that, in the matter [182] of the &ldquo;regarding
  of days,&rdquo; it had made more than half the year a holiday. Aurelius had,
  indeed, ordained that there should be no more than a hundred and thirty-five
  festival days in the year; but in other respects he had followed in the steps
  of his predecessor, Antoninus Pius&mdash;commended especially for his
  &ldquo;religion,&rdquo; his conspicuous devotion to its public
  ceremonies&mdash;and whose coins are remarkable for their reference to the
  oldest and most hieratic types of Roman mythology. Aurelius had succeeded in
  more than healing the old feud between philosophy and religion, displaying
  himself, in singular combination, as at once the most zealous of philosophers
  and the most devout of polytheists, and lending himself, with an air of
  conviction, to all the pageantries of public worship. To his pious
  recognition of that one orderly spirit, which, according to the doctrine of
  the Stoics, diffuses itself through the world, and animates it&mdash;a
  recognition taking the form, with him, of a constant effort towards inward
  likeness thereto, in the harmonious order of his own soul&mdash;he had added
  a warm personal devotion towards the whole multitude of the old national
  gods, and a great many new foreign ones besides, by him, at least, not
  ignobly conceived. If the comparison may be reverently made, there was
  something here of the method by which the catholic church has added the
  cultus of the saints to its worship of the one Divine Being.</p>

  <p>[183] And to the view of the majority, though the emperor, as the personal
  centre of religion, entertained the hope of converting his people to
  philosophic faith, and had even pronounced certain public discourses for
  their instruction in it, that polytheistic devotion was his most striking
  feature. Philosophers, indeed, had, for the most part, thought with Seneca,
  &ldquo;that a man need not lift his hands to heaven, nor ask the
  sacristan&rsquo;s leave to put his mouth to the ear of an image, that his
  prayers might be heard the better.&rdquo;&mdash;Marcus Aurelius, &ldquo;a
  master in Israel,&rdquo; knew all that well enough. Yet his outward devotion
  was much more than a concession to popular sentiment, or a mere result of
  that sense of fellow- citizenship with others, which had made him again and
  again, under most difficult circumstances, an excellent comrade. Those
  others, too!&mdash;amid all their ignorances, what were they but instruments
  in the administration of the Divine Reason, &ldquo;from end to end sweetly
  and strongly disposing all things&rdquo;? Meantime &ldquo;Philosophy&rdquo;
  itself had assumed much of what we conceive to be the religious character. It
  had even cultivated the habit, the power, of &ldquo;spiritual
  direction&rdquo;; the troubled soul making recourse in its hour of
  destitution, or amid the distractions of the world, to this or that
  director&mdash;philosopho suo&mdash;who could really best understand it.</p>

  <p>And it had been in vain that the old, grave [184] and discreet religion of
  Rome had set itself, according to its proper genius, to prevent or subdue all
  trouble and disturbance in men&rsquo;s souls. In religion, as in other
  matters, plebeians, as such, had a taste for movement, for revolution; and it
  had been ever in the most populous quarters that religious changes began. To
  the apparatus of foreign religion, above all, recourse had been made in times
  of public disquietude or sudden terror; and in those great religious
  celebrations, before his proceeding against the barbarians, Aurelius had even
  restored the solemnities of Isis, prohibited in the capital since the time of
  Augustus, making no secret of his worship of that goddess, though her temple
  had been actually destroyed by authority in the reign of Tiberius. Her
  singular and in many ways beautiful ritual was now popular in Rome. And
  then&mdash;what the enthusiasm of the swarming plebeian quarters had
  initiated, was sure to be adopted, sooner or later, by women of fashion. A
  blending of all the religions of the ancient world had been accomplished. The
  new gods had arrived, had been welcomed, and found their places; though,
  certainly, with no real security, in any adequate ideal of the divine nature
  itself in the background of men&rsquo;s minds, that the presence of the new-
  comer should be edifying, or even refining. High and low addressed themselves
  to all deities alike without scruple; confusing them together when they
  prayed, and in the old, [185] authorised, threefold veneration of their
  visible images, by flowers, incense, and ceremonial lights&mdash;those
  beautiful usages, which the church, in her way through the world, ever making
  spoil of the world&rsquo;s goods for the better uses of the human spirit,
  took up and sanctified in her service.</p>

  <p>And certainly &ldquo;the most religious city in the world&rdquo; took no
  care to veil its devotion, however fantastic. The humblest house had its
  little chapel or shrine, its image and lamp; while almost every one seemed to
  exercise some religious function and responsibility. Colleges, composed for
  the most part of slaves and of the poor, provided for the service of the
  Compitalian Lares&mdash;the gods who presided, respectively, over the several
  quarters of the city. In one street, Marius witnessed an incident of the
  festival of the patron deity of that neighbourhood, the way being strewn with
  box, the houses tricked out gaily in such poor finery as they possessed,
  while the ancient idol was borne through it in procession, arrayed in gaudy
  attire the worse for wear. Numerous religious clubs had their stated
  anniversaries, on which the members issued with much ceremony from their
  guild-hall, or schola, and traversed the thoroughfares of Rome, preceded,
  like the confraternities of the present day, by their sacred banners, to
  offer sacrifice before some famous image. Black with the perpetual smoke of
  lamps and incense, oftenest old and [186] ugly, perhaps on that account the
  more likely to listen to the desires of the suffering&mdash;had not those
  sacred effigies sometimes given sensible tokens that they were aware? The
  image of the Fortune of Women&mdash;Fortuna Muliebris, in the Latin Way, had
  spoken (not once only) and declared; Bene me, Matronae! vidistis riteque
  dedicastis! The Apollo of Cumae had wept during three whole nights and days.
  The images in the temple of Juno Sospita had been seen to sweat. Nay! there
  was blood&mdash;divine blood&mdash;in the hearts of some of them: the images
  in the Grove of Feronia had sweated blood!</p>

  <p>From one and all Cornelius had turned away: like the &ldquo;atheist&rdquo;
  of whom Apuleius tells he had never once raised hand to lip in passing image
  or sanctuary, and had parted from Marius finally when the latter determined
  to enter the crowded doorway of a temple, on their return into the Forum,
  below the Palatine hill, where the mothers were pressing in, with a multitude
  of every sort of children, to touch the lightning-struck image of the
  wolf-nurse of Romulus&mdash;so tender to little ones!&mdash;just discernible
  in its dark shrine, amid a blaze of lights. Marius gazed after his companion
  of the day, as he mounted the steps to his lodging, singing to himself, as it
  seemed. Marius failed precisely to catch the words.</p>

  <p>And, as the rich, fresh evening came on, there was heard all over Rome,
  far above a whisper, [187] the whole town seeming hushed to catch it
  distinctly, the lively, reckless call to &ldquo;play,&rdquo; from the sons
  and daughters of foolishness, to those in whom their life was still
  green&mdash;<i>Donec virenti canities abest!&mdash;Donec virenti canities
  abest!</i> (So long as youth is fresh and age is far away! Horace,
  <i>Odes</i> I.ix.17.)</p>

  <p>Marius could hardly doubt how Cornelius would have taken the call. And as
  for himself, slight as was the burden of positive moral obligation with which
  he had entered Rome, it was to no wasteful and vagrant affections, such as
  these, that his Epicureanism had committed him.</p>

     style="margin-left:35%">&mdash;Spenser, <i>Shepheardes Calendar</i>,
     October, 61-66</p>

  <p class="first">[188] MARCUS AURELIUS who, though he had little relish for
  them himself, had ever been willing to humour the taste of his people for
  magnificent spectacles, was received back to Rome with the lesser honours of
  the Ovation, conceded by the Senate (so great was the public sense of
  deliverance) with even more than the laxity which had become its habit under
  imperial rule, for there had been no actual bloodshed in the late
  achievement. Clad in the civic dress of the chief Roman magistrate, and with
  a crown of myrtle upon his head, his colleague similarly attired walking
  beside him, he passed up to the Capitol on foot, though in solemn procession
  along the Sacred Way, to offer sacrifice to the national gods. The victim, a
  goodly sheep, whose image we may still see between the pig and the ox of the
  [189] Suovetaurilia, filleted and stoled almost like some ancient canon of
  the church, on a sculptured fragment in the Forum, was conducted by the
  priests, clad in rich white vestments, and bearing their sacred utensils of
  massive gold, immediately behind a company of flute- players, led by the
  great choir-master, or conductor, of the day, visibly tetchy or delighted,
  according as the instruments he ruled with his tuning-rod, rose, more or less
  adequately amid the difficulties of the way, to the dream of perfect music in
  the soul within him. The vast crowd, including the soldiers of the triumphant
  army, now restored to wives and children, all alike in holiday whiteness, had
  left their houses early in the fine, dry morning, in a real affection for
  &ldquo;the father of his country,&rdquo; to await the procession, the two
  princes having spent the preceding night outside the walls, at the old Villa
  of the Republic. Marius, full of curiosity, had taken his position with much
  care; and stood to see the world&rsquo;s masters pass by, at an angle from
  which he could command the view of a great part of the processional route,
  sprinkled with fine yellow sand, and punctiliously guarded from profane
  footsteps.</p>

  <p>The coming of the pageant was announced by the clear sound of the flutes,
  heard at length above the acclamations of the people&mdash;Salve
  Imperator!&mdash;Dii te servent!&mdash;shouted in regular time, over the
  hills. It was on the central [190] figure, of course, that the whole
  attention of Marius was fixed from the moment when the procession came in
  sight, preceded by the lictors with gilded fasces, the imperial
  image-bearers, and the pages carrying lighted torches; a band of knights,
  among whom was Cornelius in complete military, array, following. Amply
  swathed about in the folds of a richly worked toga, after a manner now long
  since become obsolete with meaner persons, Marius beheld a man of about
  five-and-forty years of age, with prominent eyes&mdash;eyes, which although
  demurely downcast during this essentially religious ceremony, were by nature
  broadly and benignantly observant. He was still, in the main, as we see him
  in the busts which represent his gracious and courtly youth, when Hadrian had
  playfully called him, not Verus, after the name of his father, but
  Verissimus, for his candour of gaze, and the bland capacity of the brow,
  which, below the brown hair, clustering thickly as of old, shone out low,
  broad, and clear, and still without a trace of the trouble of his lips. You
  saw the brow of one who, amid the blindness or perplexity of the people about
  him, understood all things clearly; the dilemma, to which his experience so
  far had brought him, between Chance with meek resignation, and a Providence
  with boundless possibilities and hope, being for him at least distinctly
  defined.</p>

  <p>That outward serenity, which he valued so [191] highly as a point of
  manner or expression not unworthy the care of a public minister&mdash;
  outward symbol, it might be thought, of the inward religious serenity it had
  been his constant purpose to maintain&mdash;was increased to-day by his sense
  of the gratitude of his people; that his life had been one of such gifts and
  blessings as made his person seem in very deed divine to them. Yet the cloud
  of some reserved internal sorrow, passing from time to time into an
  expression of fatigue and effort, of loneliness amid the shouting multitude,
  might have been detected there by the more observant&mdash;as if the
  sagacious hint of one of his officers, &ldquo;The soldiers can&rsquo;t
  understand you, they don&rsquo;t know Greek,&rdquo; were applicable always to
  his relationships with other people. The nostrils and mouth seemed capable
  almost of peevishness; and Marius noted in them, as in the hands, and in the
  spare body generally, what was new to his experience&mdash;something of
  asceticism, as we say, of a bodily gymnastic, by which, although it told
  pleasantly in the clear blue humours of the eye, the flesh had scarcely been
  an equal gainer with the spirit. It was hardly the expression of &ldquo;the
  healthy mind in the healthy body,&rdquo; but rather of a sacrifice of the
  body to the soul, its needs and aspirations, that Marius seemed to divine in
  this assiduous student of the Greek sages&mdash;a sacrifice, in truth, far
  beyond the demands of their very saddest philosophy of life.</p>

  <p>[192] Dignify thyself with modesty and simplicity for thine
  ornaments!&mdash;had been ever a maxim with this dainty and high-bred Stoic,
  who still thought manners a true part of morals, according to the old sense
  of the term, and who regrets now and again that he cannot control his
  thoughts equally well with his countenance. That outward composure was
  deepened during the solemnities of this day by an air of pontifical
  abstraction; which, though very far from being pride&mdash;nay, a sort of
  humility rather&mdash;yet gave, to himself, an air of unapproachableness, and
  to his whole proceeding, in which every minutest act was considered, the
  character of a ritual. Certainly, there was no haughtiness, social, moral, or
  even philosophic, in Aurelius, who had realised, under more trying conditions
  perhaps than any one before, that no element of humanity could be alien from
  him. Yet, as he walked to-day, the centre of ten thousand observers, with
  eyes discreetly fixed on the ground, veiling his head at times and muttering
  very rapidly the words of the &ldquo;supplications,&rdquo; there was
  something many spectators may have noted as a thing new in their experience,
  for Aurelius, unlike his predecessors, took all this with absolute
  seriousness. The doctrine of the sanctity of kings, that, in the words of
  Tacitus, Princes are as Gods&mdash;Principes instar deorum esse&mdash;seemed
  to have taken a novel, because a literal, sense. For Aurelius, indeed, the
  old legend of his descent from Numa, from [193] Numa who had talked with the
  gods, meant much. Attached in very early years to the service of the altars,
  like many another noble youth, he was &ldquo;observed to perform all his
  sacerdotal functions with a constancy and exactness unusual at that age; was
  soon a master of the sacred music; and had all the forms and ceremonies by
  heart.&rdquo; And now, as the emperor, who had not only a vague divinity
  about his person, but was actually the chief religious functionary of the
  state, recited from time to time the forms of invocation, he needed not the
  help of the prompter, or ceremoniarius, who then approached, to assist him by
  whispering the appointed words in his ear. It was that pontifical abstraction
  which then impressed itself on Marius as the leading outward characteristic
  of Aurelius; though to him alone, perhaps, in that vast crowd of observers,
  it was no strange thing, but a matter he had understood from of old.</p>

  <p>Some fanciful writers have assigned the origin of these triumphal
  processions to the mythic pomps of Dionysus, after his conquests in the East;
  the very word Triumph being, according to this supposition, only
  Thriambos-the Dionysiac Hymn. And certainly the younger of the two imperial
  &ldquo;brothers,&rdquo; who, with the effect of a strong contrast, walked
  beside Aurelius, and shared the honours of the day, might well have reminded
  people of the delicate Greek god of flowers and wine. This [194] new
  conqueror of the East was now about thirty-six years old, but with his
  scrupulous care for all the advantages of his person, and a soft curling
  beard powdered with gold, looked many years younger. One result of the more
  genial element in the wisdom of Aurelius had been that, amid most difficult
  circumstances, he had known throughout life how to act in union with persons
  of character very alien from his own; to be more than loyal to the colleague,
  the younger brother in empire, he had too lightly taken to himself, five
  years before, then an uncorrupt youth, &ldquo;skilled in manly exercises and
  fitted for war.&rdquo; When Aurelius thanks the gods that a brother had
  fallen to his lot, whose character was a stimulus to the proper care of his
  own, one sees that this could only have happened in the way of an example,
  putting him on his guard against insidious faults. But it is with sincere
  amiability that the imperial writer, who was indeed little used to be
  ironical, adds that the lively respect and affection of the junior had often
  &ldquo;gladdened&rdquo; him. To be able to make his use of the flower, when
  the fruit perhaps was useless or poisonous:&mdash;that was one of the
  practical successes of his philosophy; and his people noted, with a blessing,
  &ldquo;the concord of the two Augusti.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The younger, certainly, possessed in full measure that charm of a
  constitutional freshness of aspect which may defy for a long time extravagant
  or erring habits of life; a physiognomy, [195] healthy-looking, cleanly, and
  firm, which seemed unassociable with any form of self-torment, and made one
  think of the muzzle of some young hound or roe, such as human beings
  invariably like to stroke&mdash;a physiognomy, in effect, with all the
  goodliness of animalism of the finer sort, though still wholly animal. The
  charm was that of the blond head, the unshrinking gaze, the warm tints:
  neither more nor less than one may see every English summer, in youth, manly
  enough, and with the stuff which makes brave soldiers, in spite of the
  natural kinship it seems to have with playthings and gay flowers. But innate
  in Lucius Verus there was that more than womanly fondness for fond things,
  which had made the atmosphere of the old city of Antioch, heavy with
  centuries of voluptuousness, a poison to him: he had come to love his
  delicacies best out of season, and would have gilded the very flowers. But
  with a wonderful power of self-obliteration, the elder brother at the capital
  had directed his procedure successfully, and allowed him, become now also the
  husband of his daughter Lucilla, the credit of a &ldquo;Conquest,&rdquo;
  though Verus had certainly not returned a conqueror over himself. He had
  returned, as we know, with the plague in his company, along with many another
  strange creature of his folly; and when the people saw him publicly feeding
  his favourite horse Fleet with almonds and sweet grapes, wearing the
  animal&rsquo;s image in gold, and [196] finally building it a tomb, they
  felt, with some un-sentimental misgiving, that he might revive the manners of
  Nero.&mdash;What if, in the chances of war, he should survive the protecting
  genius of that elder brother?</p>

  <p>He was all himself to-day: and it was with much wistful curiosity that
  Marius regarded him. For Lucius Verus was, indeed, but the highly expressive
  type of a class,&mdash;the true son of his father, adopted by Hadrian. Lucius
  Verus the elder, also, had had the like strange capacity for misusing the
  adornments of life, with a masterly grace; as if such misusing were, in
  truth, the quite adequate occupation of an intelligence, powerful, but
  distorted by cynical philosophy or some disappointment of the heart. It was
  almost a sort of genius, of which there had been instances in the imperial
  purple: it was to ascend the throne, a few years later, in the person of one,
  now a hopeful little lad at home in the palace; and it had its following, of
  course, among the wealthy youth at Rome, who concentrated no inconsiderable
  force of shrewdness and tact upon minute details of attire and manner, as
  upon the one thing needful. Certainly, flowers were pleasant to the eye. Such
  things had even their sober use, as making the outside of human life
  superficially attractive, and thereby promoting the first steps towards
  friendship and social amity. But what precise place could there be for Verus
  and his peculiar charm, [197] in that Wisdom, that Order of divine Reason
  &ldquo;reaching from end to end, strongly and sweetly disposing all
  things,&rdquo; from the vision of which Aurelius came down, so tolerant of
  persons like him? Into such vision Marius too was certainly well-fitted to
  enter, yet, noting the actual perfection of Lucius Verus after his kind, his
  undeniable achievement of the select, in all minor things, felt, though with
  some suspicion of himself, that he entered into, and could understand, this
  other so dubious sort of character also. There was a voice in the theory he
  had brought to Rome with him which whispered &ldquo;nothing is either great
  nor small;&rdquo; as there were times when he could have thought that, as the
  &ldquo;grammarian&rsquo;s&rdquo; or the artist&rsquo;s ardour of soul may be
  satisfied by the perfecting of the theory of a sentence, or the adjustment of
  two colours, so his own life also might have been fulfilled by an
  enthusiastic quest after perfection&mdash;say, in the flowering and folding
  of a toga.</p>

  <p>The emperors had burned incense before the image of Jupiter, arrayed in
  its most gorgeous apparel, amid sudden shouts from the people of Salve
  Imperator! turned now from the living princes to the deity, as they discerned
  his countenance through the great open doors. The imperial brothers had
  deposited their crowns of myrtle on the richly embroidered lapcloth of the
  god; and, with their chosen guests, sat down to a public feast in the temple
  [198] itself. There followed what was, after all, the great event of the
  day:&mdash;an appropriate discourse, a discourse almost wholly de contemptu
  mundi, delivered in the presence of the assembled Senate, by the emperor
  Aurelius, who had thus, on certain rare occasions, condescended to instruct
  his people, with the double authority of a chief pontiff and a laborious
  student of philosophy. In those lesser honours of the ovation, there had been
  no attendant slave behind the emperors, to make mock of their effulgence as
  they went; and it was as if with the discretion proper to a philosopher, and
  in fear of a jealous Nemesis, he had determined himself to protest in time
  against the vanity of all outward success.</p>

  <p>The Senate was assembled to hear the emperor&rsquo;s discourse in the vast
  hall of the Curia Julia. A crowd of high-bred youths idled around, or on the
  steps before the doors, with the marvellous toilets Marius had noticed in the
  Via Nova; in attendance, as usual, to learn by observation the minute points
  of senatorial procedure. Marius had already some acquaintance with them, and
  passing on found himself suddenly in the presence of what was still the most
  august assembly the world had seen. Under Aurelius, ever full of veneration
  for this ancient traditional guardian of public religion, the Senate had
  recovered all its old dignity and independence. Among its members many [199]
  hundreds in number, visibly the most distinguished of them all, Marius noted
  the great sophists or rhetoricians of the day, in all their magnificence. The
  antique character of their attire, and the ancient mode of wearing it, still
  surviving with them, added to the imposing character of their persons, while
  they sat, with their staves of ivory in their hands, on their curule
  chairs&mdash;almost the exact pattern of the chair still in use in the Roman
  church when a Bishop pontificates at the divine offices&mdash;&ldquo;tranquil
  and unmoved, with a majesty that seemed divine,&rdquo; as Marius thought,
  like the old Gaul of the Invasion. The rays of the early November sunset
  slanted full upon the audience, and made it necessary for the officers of the
  Court to draw the purple curtains over the windows, adding to the solemnity
  of the scene. In the depth of those warm shadows, surrounded by her ladies,
  the empress Faustina was seated to listen. The beautiful Greek statue of
  Victory, which since the days of Augustus had presided over the assemblies of
  the Senate, had been brought into the hall, and placed near the chair of the
  emperor; who, after rising to perform a brief sacrificial service in its
  honour, bowing reverently to the assembled fathers left and right, took his
  seat and began to speak.</p>

  <p>There was a certain melancholy grandeur in the very simplicity or
  triteness of the theme: as it were the very quintessence of all the old [200]
  Roman epitaphs, of all that was monumental in that city of tombs, layer upon
  layer of dead things and people. As if in the very fervour of disillusion, he
  seemed to be composing&mdash;Hosper epigraphas chronon kai holon
  ethnon+&mdash;the sepulchral titles of ages and whole peoples; nay! the very
  epitaph of the living Rome itself. The grandeur of the ruins of
  Rome,&mdash;heroism in ruin: it was under the influence of an imaginative
  anticipation of this, that he appeared to be speaking. And though the
  impression of the actual greatness of Rome on that day was but enhanced by
  the strain of contempt, falling with an accent of pathetic conviction from
  the emperor himself, and gaining from his pontifical pretensions the
  authority of a religious intimation, yet the curious interest of the
  discourse lay in this, that Marius, for one, as he listened, seemed to forsee
  a grass-grown Forum, the broken ways of the Capitol, and the Palatine hill
  itself in humble occupation. That impression connected itself with what he
  had already noted of an actual change even then coming over Italian scenery.
  Throughout, he could trace something of a humour into which Stoicism at all
  times tends to fall, the tendency to cry, Abase yourselves! There was here
  the almost inhuman impassibility of one who had thought too closely on the
  paradoxical aspect of the love of posthumous fame. With the ascetic pride
  which lurks under all Platonism, [201] resultant from its opposition of the
  seen to the unseen, as falsehood to truth&mdash;the imperial Stoic, like his
  true descendant, the hermit of the middle age, was ready, in no friendly
  humour, to mock, there in its narrow bed, the corpse which had made so much
  of itself in life. Marius could but contrast all that with his own Cyrenaic
  eagerness, just then, to taste and see and touch; reflecting on the opposite
  issues deducible from the same text. &ldquo;The world, within me and without,
  flows away like a river,&rdquo; he had said; &ldquo;therefore let me make the
  most of what is here and now.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The world and the thinker
  upon it, are consumed like a flame,&rdquo; said Aurelius, &ldquo;therefore
  will I turn away my eyes from vanity: renounce: withdraw myself alike from
  all affections.&rdquo; He seemed tacitly to claim as a sort of personal
  dignity, that he was very familiarly versed in this view of things, and could
  discern a death&rsquo;s-head everywhere. Now and again Marius was reminded of
  the saying that &ldquo;with the Stoics all people are the vulgar save
  themselves;&rdquo; and at times the orator seemed to have forgotten his
  audience, and to be speaking only to himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Art thou in love with men&rsquo;s praises, get thee into the very
  soul of them, and see!&mdash;see what judges they be, even in those matters
  which concern themselves. Wouldst thou have their praise after death, bethink
  thee, that they who shall come hereafter, and with whom thou [202] wouldst
  survive by thy great name, will be but as these, whom here thou hast found so
  hard to live with. For of a truth, the soul of him who is aflutter upon
  renown after death, presents not this aright to itself, that of all whose
  memory he would have each one will likewise very quickly depart, until memory
  herself be put out, as she journeys on by means of such as are themselves on
  the wing but for a while, and are extinguished in their turn.&mdash;Making so
  much of those thou wilt never see! It is as if thou wouldst have had those
  who were before thee discourse fair things concerning thee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To him, indeed, whose wit hath been whetted by true doctrine, that
  well-worn sentence of Homer (<i>Iliad</i> VI.146-48) sufficeth, to guard him
  against regret and fear.&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">Like the race of leaves<br>
  The race of man is:&mdash;<br>
  The wind in autumn strows<br>
  The earth with old leaves: then the spring<br>
  the woods with new endows.</p>

  <p>Leaves! little leaves!&mdash;thy children, thy flatterers, thine enemies!
  Leaves in the wind, those who would devote thee to darkness, who scorn or
  miscall thee here, even as they also whose great fame shall outlast them. For
  all these, and the like of them, are born indeed in the spring
  season&mdash;<i>Earos epigignetai hore</i> (Born in springtime, Homer, Iliad
  VI.147): and soon a wind hath scattered them, and thereafter the [203] wood
  peopleth itself again with another generation of leaves. And what is common
  to all of them is but the littleness of their lives: and yet wouldst thou
  love and hate, as if these things should continue for ever. In a little while
  thine eyes also will be closed, and he on whom thou perchance hast leaned
  thyself be himself a burden upon another.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bethink thee often of the swiftness with which the things that are,
  or are even now coming to be, are swept past thee: that the very substance of
  them is but the perpetual motion of water: that there is almost nothing which
  continueth: of that bottomless depth of time, so close at thy side. Folly! to
  be lifted up, or sorrowful, or anxious, by reason of things like these! Think
  of infinite matter, and thy portion&mdash;how tiny a particle, of it! of
  infinite time, and thine own brief point there; of destiny, and the jot thou
  art in it; and yield thyself readily to the wheel of Clotho, to spin of thee
  what web she will.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As one casting a ball from his hand, the nature of things hath had
  its aim with every man, not as to the ending only, but the first beginning of
  his course, and passage thither. And hath the ball any profit of its rising,
  or loss as it descendeth again, or in its fall? or the bubble, as it groweth
  or breaketh on the air? or the flame of the lamp, from the beginning to the
  end of its brief story?</p>

  <p>[204] &ldquo;All but at this present that future is, in which nature, who
  disposeth all things in order, will transform whatsoever thou now seest,
  fashioning from its substance somewhat else, and therefrom somewhat else in
  its turn, lest the world grow old. We are such stuff as dreams are made
  of&mdash;disturbing dreams. Awake, then! and see thy dream as it is, in
  comparison with that erewhile it seemed to thee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And for me, especially, it were well to mind those many mutations
  of empire in time past; therein peeping also upon the future, which must
  needs be of like species with what hath been, continuing ever within the
  rhythm and number of things which really are; so that in forty years one may
  note of man and of his ways little less than in a thousand. Ah! from this
  higher place, look we down upon the ship-wrecks and the calm! Consider, for
  example, how the world went, under the emperor Vespasian. They are married
  and given in marriage, they breed children; love hath its way with them; they
  heap up riches for others or for themselves; they are murmuring at things as
  then they are; they are seeking for great place; crafty, flattering,
  suspicious, waiting upon the death of others:&mdash;festivals, business, war,
  sickness, dissolution: and now their whole life is no longer anywhere at all.
  Pass on to the reign of Trajan: all things continue the same: and that life
  also is no longer anywhere at all. [205] Ah! but look again, and consider,
  one after another, as it were the sepulchral inscriptions of all peoples and
  times, according to one pattern.&mdash;What multitudes, after their utmost
  striving&mdash;a little afterwards! were dissolved again into their dust.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Think again of life as it was far off in the ancient world; as it
  must be when we shall be gone; as it is now among the wild heathen. How many
  have never heard your names and mine, or will soon forget them! How soon may
  those who shout my name to-day begin to revile it, because glory, and the
  memory of men, and all things beside, are but vanity&mdash;a sand-heap under
  the senseless wind, the barking of dogs, the quarrelling of children, weeping
  incontinently upon their laughter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This hasteth to be; that other to have been: of that which now
  cometh to be, even now somewhat hath been extinguished. And wilt thou make
  thy treasure of any one of these things? It were as if one set his love upon
  the swallow, as it passeth out of sight through the air!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bethink thee often, in all contentions public and private, of those
  whom men have remembered by reason of their anger and vehement
  spirit&mdash;those famous rages, and the occasions of them&mdash;the great
  fortunes, and misfortunes, of men&rsquo;s strife of old. What are they all
  now, and the dust of their battles? Dust [206] and ashes indeed; a fable, a
  mythus, or not so much as that. Yes! keep those before thine eyes who took
  this or that, the like of which happeneth to thee, so hardly; were so
  querulous, so agitated. And where again are they? Wouldst thou have it not
  otherwise with thee?</p>

  <p>Consider how quickly all things vanish away&mdash;their bodily structure
  into the general substance; the very memory of them into that great gulf and
  abysm of past thoughts. Ah! &rsquo;tis on a tiny space of earth thou art
  creeping through life&mdash;a pigmy soul carrying a dead body to its
  grave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let death put thee upon the consideration both of thy body and thy
  soul: what an atom of all matter hath been distributed to thee; what a little
  particle of the universal mind. Turn thy body about, and consider what thing
  it is, and that which old age, and lust, and the languor of disease can make
  of it. Or come to its substantial and causal qualities, its very type:
  contemplate that in itself, apart from the accidents of matter, and then
  measure also the span of time for which the nature of things, at the longest,
  will maintain that special type. Nay! in the very principles and first
  constituents of things corruption hath its part&mdash;so much dust, humour,
  stench, and scraps of bone! Consider that thy marbles are but the
  earth&rsquo;s callosities, thy gold and silver its faeces; this silken robe
  but a worm&rsquo;s bedding, and thy [207] purple an unclean fish. Ah! and thy
  life&rsquo;s breath is not otherwise, as it passeth out of matters like
  these, into the like of them again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For the one soul in things, taking matter like wax in the hands,
  moulds and remoulds&mdash;how hastily!&mdash;beast, and plant, and the babe,
  in turn: and that which dieth hath not slipped out of the order of nature,
  but, remaining therein, hath also its changes there, disparting into those
  elements of which nature herself, and thou too, art compacted. She changes
  without murmuring. The oaken chest falls to pieces with no more complaining
  than when the carpenter fitted it together. If one told thee certainly that
  on the morrow thou shouldst die, or at the furthest on the day after, it
  would be no great matter to thee to die on the day after to-morrow, rather
  than to-morrow. Strive to think it a thing no greater that thou wilt die-
  -not to-morrow, but a year, or two years, or ten years from to-day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I find that all things are now as they were in the days of our
  buried ancestors&mdash;all things sordid in their elements, trite by long
  usage, and yet ephemeral. How ridiculous, then, how like a countryman in
  town, is he, who wonders at aught. Doth the sameness, the repetition of the
  public shows, weary thee? Even so doth that likeness of events in the
  spectacle of the world. And so must it be with thee to the end. For the wheel
  of the world hath ever the same [208] motion, upward and downward, from
  generation to generation. When, when, shall time give place to eternity?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If there be things which trouble thee thou canst put them away,
  inasmuch as they have their being but in thine own notion concerning them.
  Consider what death is, and how, if one does but detach from it the
  appearances, the notions, that hang about it, resting the eye upon it as in
  itself it really is, it must be thought of but as an effect of nature, and
  that man but a child whom an effect of nature shall affright. Nay! not
  function and effect of nature, only; but a thing profitable also to
  herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To cease from action&mdash;the ending of thine effort to think and
  do: there is no evil in that. Turn thy thought to the ages of man&rsquo;s
  life, boyhood, youth, maturity, old age: the change in every one of these
  also is a dying, but evil nowhere. Thou climbedst into the ship, thou hast
  made thy voyage and touched the shore. Go forth now! Be it into some other
  life: the divine breath is everywhere, even there. Be it into forgetfulness
  for ever; at least thou wilt rest from the beating of sensible images upon
  thee, from the passions which pluck thee this way and that like an unfeeling
  toy, from those long marches of the intellect, from thy toilsome ministry to
  the flesh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Art thou yet more than dust and ashes and bare bone&mdash;a name
  only, or not so much as [209] that, which, also, is but whispering and a
  resonance, kept alive from mouth to mouth of dying abjects who have hardly
  known themselves; how much less thee, dead so long ago!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When thou lookest upon a wise man, a lawyer, a captain of war,
  think upon another gone. When thou seest thine own face in the glass, call up
  there before thee one of thine ancestors&mdash;one of those old Caesars. Lo!
  everywhere, thy double before thee! Thereon, let the thought occur to thee:
  And where are they? anywhere at all, for ever? And thou, thyself&mdash;how
  long? Art thou blind to that thou art&mdash;thy matter, how temporal; and thy
  function, the nature of thy business? Yet tarry, at least, till thou hast
  assimilated even these things to thine own proper essence, as a quick fire
  turneth into heat and light whatsoever be cast upon it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As words once in use are antiquated to us, so is it with the names
  that were once on all men&rsquo;s lips: Camillus, Volesus, Leonnatus: then,
  in a little while, Scipio and Cato, and then Augustus, and then Hadrian, and
  then Antoninus Pius. How many great physicians who lifted wise brows at other
  men&rsquo;s sick-beds, have sickened and died! Those wise Chaldeans, who
  foretold, as a great matter, another man&rsquo;s last hour, have themselves
  been taken by surprise. Ay! and all those others, in their pleasant places:
  those who doated on a Capreae like [210] Tiberius, on their gardens, on the
  baths: Pythagoras and Socrates, who reasoned so closely upon immortality:
  Alexander, who used the lives of others as though his own should last for
  ever&mdash;he and his mule-driver alike now!&mdash;one upon another.
  Well-nigh the whole court of Antoninus is extinct. Panthea and Pergamus sit
  no longer beside the sepulchre of their lord. The watchers over
  Hadrian&rsquo;s dust have slipped from his sepulchre.&mdash;It were jesting
  to stay longer. Did they sit there still, would the dead feel it? or feeling
  it, be glad? or glad, hold those watchers for ever? The time must come when
  they too shall be aged men and aged women, and decease, and fail from their
  places; and what shift were there then for imperial service? This too is but
  the breath of the tomb, and a skinful of dead men&rsquo;s blood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Think again of those inscriptions, which belong not to one soul
  only, but to whole families: <i>Eschatos tou idiou genous</i>: He was the
  last of his race. Nay! of the burial of whole cities: Helice, Pompeii: of
  others, whose very burial place is unknown.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast been a citizen in this wide city. Count not for how long,
  nor repine; since that which sends thee hence is no unrighteous judge, no
  tyrant, but Nature, who brought thee hither; as when a player leaves the
  stage at the bidding of the conductor who hired him. Sayest thou, &lsquo;I
  have not played five acts&rsquo;? True! but in [211] human life, three acts
  only make sometimes an entire play. That is the composer&rsquo;s business,
  not thine. Withdraw thyself with a good will; for that too hath, perchance, a
  good will which dismisseth thee from thy part.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The discourse ended almost in darkness, the evening having set in somewhat
  suddenly, with a heavy fall of snow. The torches, made ready to do him a
  useless honour, were of real service now, as the emperor was solemnly
  conducted home; one man rapidly catching light from another&mdash;a long
  stream of moving lights across the white Forum, up the great stairs, to the
  palace. And, in effect, that night winter began, the hardest that had been
  known for a lifetime. The wolves came from the mountains; and, led by the
  carrion scent, devoured the dead bodies which had been hastily buried during
  the plague, and, emboldened by their meal, crept, before the short day was
  well past, over the walls of the farmyards of the Campagna. The eagles were
  seen driving the flocks of smaller birds across the dusky sky. Only, in the
  city itself the winter was all the brighter for the contrast, among those who
  could pay for light and warmth. The habit-makers made a great sale of the
  spoil of all such furry creatures as had escaped wolves and eagles, for
  presents at the Saturnalia; and at no time had the winter roses from Carthage
  seemed more lustrously yellow and red.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE &ldquo;MISTRESS AND MOTHER&rdquo; OF
     PALACES</h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER that sharp, brief winter, the sun was already at work,
  softening leaf and bud, as you might feel by a faint sweetness in the air;
  but he did his work behind an evenly white sky, against which the abode of
  the Caesars, its cypresses and bronze roofs, seemed like a picture in
  beautiful but melancholy colour, as Marius climbed the long flights of steps
  to be introduced to the emperor Aurelius. Attired in the newest mode, his
  legs wound in dainty fasciae of white leather, with the heavy gold ring of
  the ingenuus, and in his toga of ceremony, he still retained all his country
  freshness of complexion. The eyes of the &ldquo;golden youth&rdquo; of Rome
  were upon him as the chosen friend of Cornelius, and the destined servant of
  the emperor; but not jealously. In spite of, perhaps partly because of, his
  habitual reserve of manner, he had become &ldquo;the fashion,&rdquo; even
  among those who felt instinctively the irony which lay beneath that
  remarkable self-possession, as of one taking all things with a [213]
  difference from other people, perceptible in voice, in expression, and even
  in his dress. It was, in truth, the air of one who, entering vividly into
  life, and relishing to the full the delicacies of its intercourse, yet feels
  all the while, from the point of view of an ideal philosophy, that he is but
  conceding reality to suppositions, choosing of his own will to walk in a
  day-dream, of the illusiveness of which he at least is aware.</p>

  <p>In the house of the chief chamberlain Marius waited for the due moment of
  admission to the emperor&rsquo;s presence. He was admiring the peculiar
  decoration of the walls, coloured like rich old red leather. In the midst of
  one of them was depicted, under a trellis of fruit you might have gathered,
  the figure of a woman knocking at a door with wonderful reality of
  perspective. Then the summons came; and in a few minutes, the etiquette of
  the imperial household being still a simple matter, he had passed the
  curtains which divided the central hall of the palace into three
  parts&mdash;three degrees of approach to the sacred person&mdash;and was
  speaking to Aurelius himself; not in Greek, in which the emperor oftenest
  conversed with the learned, but, more familiarly, in Latin, adorned however,
  or disfigured, by many a Greek phrase, as now and again French phrases have
  made the adornment of fashionable English. It was with real kindliness that
  Marcus Aurelius looked upon Marius, as [214] a youth of great attainments in
  Greek letters and philosophy; and he liked also his serious expression,
  being, as we know, a believer in the doctrine of physiognomy&mdash;that, as
  he puts it, not love only, but every other affection of man&rsquo;s soul,
  looks out very plainly from the window of the eyes.</p>

  <p>The apartment in which Marius found himself was of ancient aspect, and
  richly decorated with the favourite toys of two or three generations of
  imperial collectors, now finally revised by the high connoisseurship of the
  Stoic emperor himself, though destined not much longer to remain together
  there. It is the repeated boast of Aurelius that he had learned from old
  Antoninus Pius to maintain authority without the constant use of guards, in a
  robe woven by the handmaids of his own consort, with no processional lights
  or images, and &ldquo;that a prince may shrink himself almost into the figure
  of a private gentleman.&rdquo; And yet, again as at his first sight of him,
  Marius was struck by the profound religiousness of the surroundings of the
  imperial presence. The effect might have been due in part to the very
  simplicity, the discreet and scrupulous simplicity, of the central figure in
  this splendid abode; but Marius could not forget that he saw before him not
  only the head of the Roman religion, but one who might actually have claimed
  something like divine worship, had he cared to do so. Though the fantastic
  pretensions of Caligula had brought some contempt [215] on that claim, which
  had become almost a jest under the ungainly Claudius, yet, from Augustus
  downwards, a vague divinity had seemed to surround the Caesars even in this
  life; and the peculiar character of Aurelius, at once a ceremonious
  polytheist never forgetful of his pontifical calling, and a philosopher whose
  mystic speculation encircled him with a sort of saintly halo, had restored to
  his person, without his intending it, something of that divine prerogative,
  or prestige. Though he would never allow the immediate dedication of altars
  to himself, yet the image of his Genius&mdash;his spirituality or celestial
  counterpart&mdash;was placed among those of the deified princes of the past;
  and his family, including Faustina and the young Commodus, was spoken of as
  the &ldquo;holy&rdquo; or &ldquo;divine&rdquo; house. Many a Roman courtier
  agreed with the barbarian chief, who, after contemplating a predecessor of
  Aurelius, withdrew from his presence with the exclamation:&mdash;&ldquo;I
  have seen a god to-day!&rdquo; The very roof of his house, rising into a
  pediment or gable, like that of the sanctuary of a god, the laurels on either
  side its doorway, the chaplet of oak-leaves above, seemed to designate the
  place for religious veneration. And notwithstanding all this, the household
  of Aurelius was singularly modest, with none of the wasteful expense of
  palaces after the fashion of Lewis the Fourteenth; the palatial dignity being
  felt only in a peculiar sense of order, the absence [216] of all that was
  casual, of vulgarity and discomfort. A merely official residence of his
  predecessors, the Palatine had become the favourite dwelling-place of
  Aurelius; its many-coloured memories suiting, perhaps, his pensive character,
  and the crude splendours of Nero and Hadrian being now subdued by time. The
  window-less Roman abode must have had much of what to a modern would be
  gloom. How did the children, one wonders, endure houses with so little escape
  for the eye into the world outside? Aurelius, who had altered little else,
  choosing to live there, in a genuine homeliness, had shifted and made the
  most of the level lights, and broken out a quite medieval window here and
  there, and the clear daylight, fully appreciated by his youthful visitor,
  made pleasant shadows among the objects of the imperial collection. Some of
  these, indeed, by reason of their Greek simplicity and grace, themselves
  shone out like spaces of a purer, early light, amid the splendours of the
  Roman manufacture.</p>

  <p>Though he looked, thought Marius, like a man who did not sleep enough, he
  was abounding and bright to-day, after one of those pitiless headaches, which
  since boyhood had been the &ldquo;thorn in his side,&rdquo; challenging the
  pretensions of his philosophy to fortify one in humble endurances. At the
  first moment, to Marius, remembering the spectacle of the emperor in
  ceremony, it was almost bewildering to be in [217] private conversation with
  him. There was much in the philosophy of Aurelius&mdash;much consideration of
  mankind at large, of great bodies, aggregates and generalities, after the
  Stoic manner&mdash;which, on a nature less rich than his, might have acted as
  an inducement to care for people in inverse proportion to their nearness to
  him. That has sometimes been the result of the Stoic cosmopolitanism.
  Aurelius, however, determined to beautify by all means, great or little, a
  doctrine which had in it some potential sourness, had brought all the
  quickness of his intelligence, and long years of observation, to bear on the
  conditions of social intercourse. He had early determined &ldquo;not to make
  business an excuse to decline the offices of humanity&mdash;not to pretend to
  be too much occupied with important affairs to concede what life with others
  may hourly demand;&rdquo; and with such success, that, in an age which made
  much of the finer points of that intercourse, it was felt that the mere
  honesty of his conversation was more pleasing than other men&rsquo;s
  flattery. His agreeableness to his young visitor to-day was, in truth, a
  blossom of the same wisdom which had made of Lucius Verus really a
  brother&mdash;the wisdom of not being exigent with men, any more than with
  fruit-trees (it is his own favourite figure) beyond their nature. And there
  was another person, still nearer to him, regarding whom this wisdom became a
  marvel, of equity&mdash;of charity.</p>

  <p>[218] The centre of a group of princely children, in the same apartment
  with Aurelius, amid all the refined intimacies of a modern home, sat the
  empress Faustina, warming her hands over a fire. With her long fingers
  lighted up red by the glowing coals of the brazier Marius looked close upon
  the most beautiful woman in the world, who was also the great paradox of the
  age, among her boys and girls. As has been truly said of the numerous
  representations of her in art, so in life, she had the air of one curious,
  restless, to enter into conversation with the first comer. She had certainly
  the power of stimulating a very ambiguous sort of curiosity about herself.
  And Marius found this enigmatic point in her expression, that even after
  seeing her many times he could never precisely recall her features in
  absence. The lad of six years, looking older, who stood beside her,
  impatiently plucking a rose to pieces over the hearth, was, in outward
  appearance, his father&mdash;the young Verissimus&mdash;over again; but with
  a certain feminine length of feature, and with all his mother&rsquo;s
  alertness, or license, of gaze.</p>

  <p>Yet rumour knocked at every door and window of the imperial house
  regarding the adulterers who knocked at them, or quietly left their
  lovers&rsquo; garlands there. Was not that likeness of the husband, in the
  boy beside her, really the effect of a shameful magic, in which the blood of
  the murdered gladiator, his true father, had been an ingredient? Were the
  tricks for [219] deceiving husbands which the Roman poet describes, really
  hers, and her household an efficient school of all the arts of furtive love?
  Or, was the husband too aware, like every one beside? Were certain sudden
  deaths which happened there, really the work of apoplexy, or the plague?</p>

  <p>The man whose ears, whose soul, those rumours were meant to penetrate,
  was, however, faithful to his sanguine and optimist philosophy, to his
  determination that the world should be to him simply what the higher reason
  preferred to conceive it; and the life&rsquo;s journey Aurelius had made so
  far, though involving much moral and intellectual loneliness, had been ever
  in affectionate and helpful contact with other wayfarers, very unlike
  himself. Since his days of earliest childhood in the Lateran gardens, he
  seemed to himself, blessing the gods for it after deliberate survey, to have
  been always surrounded by kinsmen, friends, servants, of exceptional virtue.
  From the great Stoic idea, that we are all fellow-citizens of one city, he
  had derived a tenderer, a more equitable estimate than was common among
  Stoics, of the eternal shortcomings of men and women. Considerations that
  might tend to the sweetening of his temper it was his daily care to store
  away, with a kind of philosophic pride in the thought that no one took more
  good-naturedly than he the &ldquo;oversights&rdquo; of his neighbours. For
  had not Plato taught (it was not [220] paradox, but simple truth of
  experience) that if people sin, it is because they know no better, and are
  &ldquo;under the necessity of their own ignorance&rdquo;? Hard to himself, he
  seemed at times, doubtless, to decline too softly upon unworthy persons.
  Actually, he came thereby upon many a useful instrument. The empress Faustina
  he would seem at least to have kept, by a constraining affection, from
  becoming altogether what most people have believed her, and won in her (we
  must take him at his word in the &ldquo;Thoughts,&rdquo; abundantly confirmed
  by letters, on both sides, in his correspondence with Cornelius Fronto) a
  consolation, the more secure, perhaps, because misknown of others. Was the
  secret of her actual blamelessness, after all, with him who has at least
  screened her name? At all events, the one thing quite certain about her,
  besides her extraordinary beauty, is her sweetness to himself.</p>

  <p>No! The wise, who had made due observation on the trees of the garden,
  would not expect to gather grapes of thorns or fig-trees: and he was the
  vine, putting forth his genial fruit, by natural law, again and again, after
  his kind, whatever use people might make of it. Certainly, his actual
  presence never lost its power, and Faustina was glad in it to-day, the
  birthday of one of her children, a boy who stood at her knee holding in his
  fingers tenderly a tiny silver trumpet, one of his birthday
  gifts.&mdash;&ldquo;For my [221] part, unless I conceive my hurt to be such,
  I have no hurt at all,&rdquo;&mdash;boasts the would-be apathetic
  emperor:&mdash;&ldquo;and how I care to conceive of the thing rests with
  me.&rdquo; Yet when his children fall sick or die, this pretence breaks down,
  and he is broken-hearted: and one of the charms of certain of his letters
  still extant, is his reference to those childish sicknesses.&mdash;&ldquo;On
  my return to Lorium,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I found my little
  lady&mdash;domnulam meam&mdash;in a fever;&rdquo; and again, in a letter to
  one of the most serious of men, &ldquo;You will be glad to hear that our
  little one is better, and running about the room&mdash;parvolam nostram
  melius valere et intra cubiculum discurrere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young Commodus had departed from the chamber, anxious to witness the
  exercises of certain gladiators, having a native taste for such company,
  inherited, according to popular rumour, from his true father&mdash;anxious
  also to escape from the too impressive company of the gravest and sweetest
  specimen of old age Marius had ever seen, the tutor of the imperial children,
  who had arrived to offer his birthday congratulations, and now, very
  familiarly and affectionately, made a part of the group, falling on the
  shoulders of the emperor, kissing the empress Faustina on the face, the
  little ones on the face and hands. Marcus Cornelius Fronto, the
  &ldquo;Orator,&rdquo; favourite teacher of the emperor&rsquo;s youth,
  afterwards his most trusted counsellor, and now the undisputed occupant of
  the sophistic throne, whose equipage, [222] elegantly mounted with silver,
  Marius had seen in the streets of Rome, had certainly turned his many
  personal gifts to account with a good fortune, remarkable even in that age,
  so indulgent to professors or rhetoricians. The gratitude of the emperor
  Aurelius, always generous to his teachers, arranging their very quarrels
  sometimes, for they were not always fair to one another, had helped him to a
  really great place in the world. But his sumptuous appendages, including the
  villa and gardens of Maecenas, had been borne with an air perfectly becoming,
  by the professor of a philosophy which, even in its most accomplished and
  elegant phase, presupposed a gentle contempt for such things. With an
  intimate practical knowledge of manners, physiognomies, smiles, disguises,
  flatteries, and courtly tricks of every kind&mdash;a whole accomplished
  rhetoric of daily life&mdash;he applied them all to the promotion of
  humanity, and especially of men&rsquo;s family affection. Through a long life
  of now eighty years, he had been, as it were, surrounded by the gracious and
  soothing air of his own eloquence&mdash;the fame, the echoes, of
  it&mdash;like warbling birds, or murmuring bees. Setting forth in that fine
  medium the best ideas of matured pagan philosophy, he had become the
  favourite &ldquo;director&rdquo; of noble youth</p>

  <p>Yes! it was the one instance Marius, always eagerly on the look-out for
  such, had yet seen of [223] a perfectly tolerable, perfectly beautiful, old
  age&mdash;an old age in which there seemed, to one who perhaps habitually
  over-valued the expression of youth, nothing to be regretted, nothing really
  lost, in what years had taken away. The wise old man, whose blue eyes and
  fair skin were so delicate, uncontaminate and clear, would seem to have
  replaced carefully and consciously each natural trait of youth, as it
  departed from him, by an equivalent grace of culture; and had the blitheness,
  the placid cheerfulness, as he had also the infirmity, the claim on stronger
  people, of a delightful child. And yet he seemed to be but awaiting his exit
  from life&mdash;that moment with which the Stoics were almost as much
  preoccupied as the Christians, however differently&mdash;and set Marius
  pondering on the contrast between a placidity like this, at eighty years, and
  the sort of desperateness he was aware of in his own manner of entertaining
  that thought. His infirmities nevertheless had been painful and
  long-continued, with losses of children, of pet grandchildren. What with the
  crowd, and the wretched streets, it was a sign of affection which had cost
  him something, for the old man to leave his own house at all that day; and he
  was glad of the emperor&rsquo;s support, as he moved from place to place
  among the children he protests so often to have loved as his own.</p>

  <p>For a strange piece of literary good fortune, at the beginning of the
  present century, has set [224] free the long-buried fragrance of this famous
  friendship of the old world, from below a valueless later manuscript, in a
  series of letters, wherein the two writers exchange, for the most part their
  evening thoughts, especially at family anniversaries, and with entire
  intimacy, on their children, on the art of speech, on all the various
  subtleties of the &ldquo;science of images&rdquo;&mdash;rhetorical
  images&mdash;above all, of course, on sleep and matters of health. They are
  full of mutual admiration of each other&rsquo;s eloquence, restless in
  absence till they see one another again, noting, characteristically, their
  very dreams of each other, expecting the day which will terminate the office,
  the business or duty, which separates them&mdash;&ldquo;as superstitious
  people watch for the star, at the rising of which they may break their
  fast.&rdquo; To one of the writers, to Aurelius, the correspondence was
  sincerely of value. We see him once reading his letters with genuine delight
  on going to rest. Fronto seeks to deter his pupil from writing in
  Greek.&mdash;Why buy, at great cost, a foreign wine, inferior to that from
  one&rsquo;s own vineyard? Aurelius, on the other hand, with an extraordinary
  innate susceptibility to words&mdash;la parole pour la parole, as the French
  say--despairs, in presence of Fronto&rsquo;s rhetorical perfection.</p>

  <p>Like the modern visitor to the Capitoline and some other museums, Fronto
  had been struck, pleasantly struck, by the family likeness [225] among the
  Antonines; and it was part of his friendship to make much of it, in the case
  of the children of Faustina. &ldquo;Well! I have seen the little ones,&rdquo;
  he writes to Aurelius, then, apparently, absent from them: &ldquo;I have seen
  the little ones&mdash;the pleasantest sight of my life; for they are as like
  yourself as could possibly be. It has well repaid me for my journey over that
  slippery road, and up those steep rocks; for I beheld you, not simply face to
  face before me, but, more generously, whichever way I turned, to my right and
  my left. For the rest, I found them, Heaven be thanked! with healthy cheeks
  and lusty voices. One was holding a slice of white bread, like a king&rsquo;s
  son; the other a crust of brown bread, as becomes the offspring of a
  philosopher. I pray the gods to have both the sower and the seed in their
  keeping; to watch over this field wherein the ears of corn are so kindly
  alike. Ah! I heard too their pretty voices, so sweet that in the childish
  prattle of one and the other I seemed somehow to be listening&mdash;yes! in
  that chirping of your pretty chickens&mdash;to the limpid and harmonious
  notes of your own oratory. Take care! you will find me growing independent,
  having those I could love in your place:&mdash;love, on the surety of my eyes
  and ears.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Magistro meo salutem!&rdquo; replies the Emperor, &ldquo;I too have
  seen my little ones in your sight of them; as, also, I saw yourself in
  reading your [226] letter. It is that charming letter forces me to write
  thus:&rdquo; with reiterations of affection, that is, which are continual in
  these letters, on both sides, and which may strike a modern reader perhaps as
  fulsome; or, again, as having something in common with the old Judaic unction
  of friendship. They were certainly sincere.</p>

  <p>To one of those children Fronto had now brought the birthday gift of the
  silver trumpet, upon which he ventured to blow softly now and again, turning
  away with eyes delighted at the sound, when he thought the old man was not
  listening. It was the well-worn, valetudinarian subject of sleep, on which
  Fronto and Aurelius were talking together; Aurelius always feeling it a
  burden, Fronto a thing of magic capacities, so that he had written an
  encomium in its praise, and often by ingenious arguments recommends his
  imperial pupil not to be sparing of it. To-day, with his younger listeners in
  mind, he had a story to tell about it:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They say that our father Jupiter, when he ordered the world at the
  beginning, divided time into two parts exactly equal: the one part he clothed
  with light, the other with darkness: he called them Day and Night; and he
  assigned rest to the night and to day the work of life. At that time Sleep
  was not yet born and men passed the whole of their lives awake: only, the
  quiet of the night was ordained for them, instead of sleep. But it came to
  pass, little by little, [227] being that the minds of men are restless, that
  they carried on their business alike by night as by day, and gave no part at
  all to repose. And Jupiter, when he perceived that even in the night-time
  they ceased not from trouble and disputation, and that even the courts of law
  remained open (it was the pride of Aurelius, as Fronto knew, to be assiduous
  in those courts till far into the night) resolved to appoint one of his
  brothers to be the overseer of the night and have authority over man&rsquo;s
  rest. But Neptune pleaded in excuse the gravity of his constant charge of the
  seas, and Father Dis the difficulty of keeping in subjection the spirits
  below; and Jupiter, having taken counsel with the other gods, perceived that
  the practice of nightly vigils was somewhat in favour. It was then, for the
  most part, that Juno gave birth to her children: Minerva, the mistress of all
  art and craft, loved the midnight lamp: Mars delighted in the darkness for
  his plots and sallies; and the favour of Venus and Bacchus was with those who
  roused by night. Then it was that Jupiter formed the design of creating
  Sleep; and he added him to the number of the gods, and gave him the charge
  over night and rest, putting into his hands the keys of human eyes. With his
  own hands he mingled the juices wherewith Sleep should soothe the hearts of
  mortals&mdash;herb of Enjoyment and herb of Safety, gathered from a grove in
  Heaven; and, from the meadows of [228] Acheron, the herb of Death; expressing
  from it one single drop only, no bigger than a tear one might hide.
  &rsquo;With this juice,&rsquo; he said, &rsquo;pour slumber upon the eyelids
  of mortals. So soon as it hath touched them they will lay themselves down
  motionless, under thy power. But be not afraid: they shall revive, and in a
  while stand up again upon their feet.&rsquo; Thereafter, Jupiter gave wings
  to Sleep, attached, not, like Mercury&rsquo;s, to his heels, but to his
  shoulders, like the wings of Love. For he said, &rsquo;It becomes thee not to
  approach men&rsquo;s eyes as with the noise of chariots, and the rushing of a
  swift courser, but in placid and merciful flight, as upon the wings of a
  swallow&mdash;nay! with not so much as the flutter of the dove.&rsquo;
  Besides all this, that he might be yet pleasanter to men, he committed to him
  also a multitude of blissful dreams, according to every man&rsquo;s desire.
  One watched his favourite actor; another listened to the flute, or guided a
  charioteer in the race: in his dream, the soldier was victorious, the general
  was borne in triumph, the wanderer returned home. Yes!&mdash;and sometimes
  those dreams come true!</p>

  <p>Just then Aurelius was summoned to make the birthday offerings to his
  household gods. A heavy curtain of tapestry was drawn back; and beyond it
  Marius gazed for a few moments into the Lararium, or imperial chapel. A
  patrician youth, in white habit, was in waiting, with a little chest in his
  hand containing incense for the [229] use of the altar. On richly carved
  consoles, or side boards, around this narrow chamber, were arranged the rich
  apparatus of worship and the golden or gilded images, adorned to-day with
  fresh flowers, among them that image of Fortune from the apartment of
  Antoninus Pius, and such of the emperor&rsquo;s own teachers as were gone to
  their rest. A dim fresco on the wall commemorated the ancient piety of Lucius
  Albinius, who in flight from Rome on the morrow of a great disaster,
  overtaking certain priests on foot with their sacred utensils, descended from
  the wagon in which he rode and yielded it to the ministers of the gods. As he
  ascended into the chapel the emperor paused, and with a grave but friendly
  look at his young visitor, delivered a parting sentence, audible to him
  alone: Imitation is the most acceptable&mdash;Make sure that those to whom
  you come nearest be the happier by yours.</p>

  <p>It was the very spirit of the scene and the hour&mdash;the hour Marius had
  spent in the imperial house. How temperate, how tranquillising! what
  humanity! Yet, as he left the eminent company concerning whose ways of life
  at home he had been so youthfully curious, and sought, after his manner, to
  determine the main trait in all this, he had to confess that it was a
  sentiment of mediocrity, though of a mediocrity for once really golden.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14"></a>XIV. &mdash; MANLY AMUSEMENT</h2>

  <p class="first">DURING the Eastern war there came a moment when schism in
  the empire had seemed possible through the defection of Lucius Verus; when to
  Aurelius it had also seemed possible to confirm his allegiance by no less a
  gift than his beautiful daughter Lucilla, the eldest of his
  children&mdash;the domnula, probably, of those letters. The little lady,
  grown now to strong and stately maidenhood, had been ever something of the
  good genius, the better soul, to Lucius Verus, by the law of contraries, her
  somewhat cold and apathetic modesty acting as counterfoil to the young
  man&rsquo;s tigrish fervour. Conducted to Ephesus, she had become his wife by
  form of civil marriage, the more solemn wedding rites being deferred till
  their return to Rome.</p>

  <p>The ceremony of the Confarreation, or religious marriage, in which bride
  and bridegroom partook together of a certain mystic bread, was celebrated
  accordingly, with due pomp, early in the spring; Aurelius himself [231]
  assisting, with much domestic feeling. A crowd of fashionable people filled
  the space before the entrance to the apartments of Lucius on the Palatine
  hill, richly decorated for the occasion, commenting, not always quite
  delicately, on the various details of the rite, which only a favoured few
  succeeded in actually witnessing. &ldquo;She comes!&rdquo; Marius could hear
  them say, &ldquo;escorted by her young brothers: it is the young Commodus who
  carries the torch of white-thornwood, the little basket of work-things, the
  toys for the children:&rdquo;&mdash;and then, after a watchful pause,
  &ldquo;she is winding the woollen thread round the doorposts. Ah! I see the
  marriage-cake: the bridegroom presents the fire and water.&rdquo; Then, in a
  longer pause, was heard the chorus, Thalassie! Thalassie! and for just a few
  moments, in the strange light of many wax tapers at noonday, Marius could see
  them both, side by side, while the bride was lifted over the doorstep: Lucius
  Verus heated and handsome&mdash;the pale, impassive Lucilla looking very long
  and slender, in her closely folded yellow veil, and high nuptial crown.</p>

  <p>As Marius turned away, glad to escape from the pressure of the crowd, he
  found himself face to face with Cornelius, an infrequent spectator on
  occasions such as this. It was a relief to depart with him&mdash;so fresh and
  quiet he looked, though in all his splendid equestrian array in honour of the
  ceremony&mdash;from the garish heat [232] of the marriage scene. The reserve
  which had puzzled Marius so much on his first day in Rome, was but an
  instance of many, to him wholly unaccountable, avoidances alike of things and
  persons, which must certainly mean that an intimate companionship would cost
  him something in the way of seemingly indifferent amusements. Some inward
  standard Marius seemed to detect there (though wholly unable to estimate its
  nature) of distinction, selection, refusal, amid the various elements of the
  fervid and corrupt life across which they were moving together:&mdash;some
  secret, constraining motive, ever on the alert at eye and ear, which carried
  him through Rome as under a charm, so that Marius could not but think of that
  figure of the white bird in the market-place as undoubtedly made true of him.
  And Marius was still full of admiration for this companion, who had known how
  to make himself very pleasant to him. Here was the clear, cold corrective,
  which the fever of his present life demanded. Without it, he would have felt
  alternately suffocated and exhausted by an existence, at once so gaudy and
  overdone, and yet so intolerably empty; in which people, even at their best,
  seemed only to be brooding, like the wise emperor himself, over a
  world&rsquo;s disillusion. For with all the severity of Cornelius, there was
  such a breeze of hopefulness&mdash;freshness and hopefulness, as of new
  morning, about him. [233] For the most part, as I said, those refusals, that
  reserve of his, seemed unaccountable. But there were cases where the unknown
  monitor acted in a direction with which the judgment, or instinct, of Marius
  himself wholly concurred; the effective decision of Cornelius strengthening
  him further therein, as by a kind of outwardly embodied conscience. And the
  entire drift of his education determined him, on one point at least, to be
  wholly of the same mind with this peculiar friend (they two, it might be,
  together, against the world!) when, alone of a whole company of brilliant
  youth, he had withdrawn from his appointed place in the amphitheatre, at a
  grand public show, which after an interval of many months, was presented
  there, in honour of the nuptials of Lucius Verus and Lucilla.</p>

  <p>And it was still to the eye, through visible movement and aspect, that the
  character, or genius of Cornelius made itself felt by Marius; even as on that
  afternoon when he had girt on his armour, among the expressive lights and
  shades of the dim old villa at the roadside, and every object of his knightly
  array had seemed to be but sign or symbol of some other thing far beyond it.
  For, consistently with his really poetic temper, all influence reached
  Marius, even more exclusively than he was aware, through the medium of sense.
  From Flavian in that brief early summer of his existence, he had derived a
  powerful impression of the [234] &ldquo;perpetual flux&rdquo;: he had caught
  there, as in cipher or symbol, or low whispers more effective than any
  definite language, his own Cyrenaic philosophy, presented thus, for the first
  time, in an image or person, with much attractiveness, touched also,
  consequently, with a pathetic sense of personal sorrow:&mdash;a concrete
  image, the abstract equivalent of which he could recognise afterwards, when
  the agitating personal influence had settled down for him, clearly enough,
  into a theory of practice. But of what possible intellectual formula could
  this mystic Cornelius be the sensible exponent; seeming, as he did, to live
  ever in close relationship with, and recognition of, a mental view, a source
  of discernment, a light upon his way, which had certainly not yet sprung up
  for Marius? Meantime, the discretion of Cornelius, his energetic clearness
  and purity, were a charm, rather physical than moral: his exquisite
  correctness of spirit, at all events, accorded so perfectly with the regular
  beauty of his person, as to seem to depend upon it. And wholly different as
  was this later friendship, with its exigency, its warnings, its restraints,
  from the feverish attachment to Flavian, which had made him at times like an
  uneasy slave, still, like that, it was a reconciliation to the world of
  sense, the visible world. From the hopefulness of this gracious presence, all
  visible things around him, even the commonest objects of everyday
  life&mdash;if they but [235] stood together to warm their hands at the same
  fire&mdash;took for him a new poetry, a delicate fresh bloom, and interest.
  It was as if his bodily eyes had been indeed mystically washed, renewed,
  strengthened.</p>

  <p>And how eagerly, with what a light heart, would Flavian have taken his
  place in the amphitheatre, among the youth of his own age! with what an
  appetite for every detail of the entertainment, and its various
  accessories:&mdash;the sunshine, filtered into soft gold by the vela, with
  their serpentine patterning, spread over the more select part of the company;
  the Vestal virgins, taking their privilege of seats near the empress
  Faustina, who sat there in a maze of double-coloured gems, changing, as she
  moved, like the waves of the sea; the cool circle of shadow, in which the
  wonderful toilets of the fashionable told so effectively around the blazing
  arena, covered again and again during the many hours&rsquo; show, with clean
  sand for the absorption of certain great red patches there, by troops of
  white-shirted boys, for whom the good-natured audience provided a scramble of
  nuts and small coin, flung to them over a trellis-work of silver-gilt and
  amber, precious gift of Nero, while a rain of flowers and perfume fell over
  themselves, as they paused between the parts of their long feast upon the
  spectacle of animal suffering.</p>

  <p>During his sojourn at Ephesus, Lucius Verus had readily become a patron,
  patron or protege, [236] of the great goddess of Ephesus, the goddess of
  hunters; and the show, celebrated by way of a compliment to him to-day, was
  to present some incidents of her story, where she figures almost as the
  genius of madness, in animals, or in the humanity which comes in contact with
  them. The entertainment would have an element of old Greek revival in it,
  welcome to the taste of a learned and Hellenising society; and, as Lucius
  Verus was in some sense a lover of animals, was to be a display of animals
  mainly. There would be real wild and domestic creatures, all of rare species;
  and a real slaughter. On so happy an occasion, it was hoped, the elder
  emperor might even concede a point, and a living criminal fall into the jaws
  of the wild beasts. And the spectacle was, certainly, to end in the
  destruction, by one mighty shower of arrows, of a hundred lions,
  &ldquo;nobly&rdquo; provided by Aurelius himself for the amusement of his
  people.&mdash;Tam magnanimus fuit!</p>

  <p>The arena, decked and in order for the first scene, looked delightfully
  fresh, re-inforcing on the spirits of the audience the actual freshness of
  the morning, which at this season still brought the dew. Along the
  subterranean ways that led up to it, the sound of an advancing chorus was
  heard at last, chanting the words of a sacred song, or hymn to Diana; for the
  spectacle of the amphitheatre was, after all, a [237] religious occasion. To
  its grim acts of blood-shedding a kind of sacrificial character still
  belonged in the view of certain religious casuists, tending conveniently to
  soothe the humane sensibilities of so pious an emperor as Aurelius, who, in
  his fraternal complacency, had consented to preside over the shows.</p>

  <p>Artemis or Diana, as she may be understood in the actual development of
  her worship, was, indeed, the symbolical expression of two allied yet
  contrasted elements of human temper and experience&mdash;man&rsquo;s amity,
  and also his enmity, towards the wild creatures, when they were still, in a
  certain sense, his brothers. She is the complete, and therefore highly
  complex, representative of a state, in which man was still much occupied with
  animals, not as his flock, or as his servants after the pastoral relationship
  of our later, orderly world, but rather as his equals, on friendly terms or
  the reverse,&mdash;a state full of primeval sympathies and antipathies, of
  rivalries and common wants&mdash;while he watched, and could enter into, the
  humours of those &ldquo;younger brothers,&rdquo; with an intimacy, the
  &ldquo;survivals&rdquo; of which in a later age seem often to have had a kind
  of madness about them. Diana represents alike the bright and the dark side of
  such relationship. But the humanities of that relationship were all forgotten
  to-day in the excitement of a show, in which mere cruelty to animals, their
  useless suffering and death, formed [238] the main point of interest. People
  watched their destruction, batch after batch, in a not particularly inventive
  fashion; though it was expected that the animals themselves, as living
  creatures are apt to do when hard put to it, would become inventive, and make
  up, by the fantastic accidents of their agony, for the deficiencies of an age
  fallen behind in this matter of manly amusement. It was as a Deity of
  Slaughter&mdash;the Taurian goddess who demands the sacrifice of the
  shipwrecked sailors thrown on her coasts&mdash;the cruel, moonstruck
  huntress, who brings not only sudden death, but rabies, among the wild
  creatures that Diana was to be presented, in the person of a famous
  courtesan. The aim at an actual theatrical illusion, after the first
  introductory scene, was frankly surrendered to the display of the animals,
  artificially stimulated and maddened to attack each other. And as Diana was
  also a special protectress of new-born creatures, there would be a certain
  curious interest in the dexterously contrived escape of the young from their
  mother&rsquo;s torn bosoms; as many pregnant animals as possible being
  carefully selected for the purpose.</p>

  <p>The time had been, and was to come again, when the pleasures of the
  amphitheatre centered in a similar practical joking upon human beings. What
  more ingenious diversion had stage manager ever contrived than that incident,
  itself a practical epigram never to be forgottten, [239] when a criminal,
  who, like slaves and animals, had no rights, was compelled to present the
  part of Icarus; and, the wings failing him in due course, had fallen into a
  pack of hungry bears? For the long shows of the amphitheatre were, so to
  speak, the novel-reading of that age&mdash;a current help provided for
  sluggish imaginations, in regard, for instance, to grisly accidents, such as
  might happen to one&rsquo;s self; but with every facility for comfortable
  inspection. Scaevola might watch his own hand, consuming, crackling, in the
  fire, in the person of a culprit, willing to redeem his life by an act so
  delightful to the eyes, the very ears, of a curious public. If the part of
  Marsyas was called for, there was a criminal condemned to lose his skin. It
  might be almost edifying to study minutely the expression of his face, while
  the assistants corded and pegged him to the bench, cunningly; the servant of
  the law waiting by, who, after one short cut with his knife, would slip the
  man&rsquo;s leg from his skin, as neatly as if it were a stocking&mdash;a
  finesse in providing the due amount of suffering for wrong-doers only brought
  to its height in Nero&rsquo;s living bonfires. But then, by making his
  suffering ridiculous, you enlist against the sufferer, some real, and all
  would-be manliness, and do much to stifle any false sentiment of compassion.
  The philosophic emperor, having no great taste for sport, and asserting here
  a personal scruple, had greatly changed all [240] that; had provided that
  nets should be spread under the dancers on the tight-rope, and buttons for
  the swords of the gladiators. But the gladiators were still there. Their
  bloody contests had, under the form of a popular amusement, the efficacy of a
  human sacrifice; as, indeed, the whole system of the public shows was
  understood to possess a religious import. Just at this point, certainly, the
  judgment of Lucretius on pagan religion is without reproach&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum.</p>

  <p>And Marius, weary and indignant, feeling isolated in the great slaughter-
  house, could not but observe that, in his habitual complaisance to Lucius
  Verus, who, with loud shouts of applause from time to time, lounged beside
  him, Aurelius had sat impassibly through all the hours Marius himself had
  remained there. For the most part indeed, the emperor had actually averted
  his eyes from the show, reading, or writing on matters of public business,
  but had seemed, after all, indifferent. He was revolving, perhaps, that old
  Stoic paradox of the Imperceptibility of pain; which might serve as an
  excuse, should those savage popular humours ever again turn against men and
  women. Marius remembered well his very attitude and expression on this day,
  when, a few years later, certain things came to pass in Gaul, under his full
  authority; and that attitude and expression [241] defined already, even thus
  early in their so friendly intercourse, and though he was still full of
  gratitude for his interest, a permanent point of difference between the
  emperor and himself&mdash;between himself, with all the convictions of his
  life taking centre to-day in his merciful, angry heart, and Aurelius, as
  representing all the light, all the apprehensive power there might be in
  pagan intellect. There was something in a tolerance such as this, in the bare
  fact that he could sit patiently through a scene like this, which seemed to
  Marius to mark Aurelius as his inferior now and for ever on the question of
  righteousness; to set them on opposite sides, in some great conflict, of
  which that difference was but a single presentment. Due, in whatever
  proportions, to the abstract principles he had formulated for himself, or in
  spite of them, there was the loyal conscience within him, deciding, judging
  himself and every one else, with a wonderful sort of authority:&mdash;You
  ought, methinks, to be something quite different from what you are; here! and
  here! Surely Aurelius must be lacking in that decisive conscience at first
  sight, of the intimations of which Marius could entertain no
  doubt&mdash;which he looked for in others. He at least, the humble follower
  of the bodily eye, was aware of a crisis in life, in this brief, obscure
  existence, a fierce opposition of real good and real evil around him, the
  issues of which he must by no [242] means compromise or confuse; of the
  antagonisms of which the &ldquo;wise&rdquo; Marcus Aurelius was unaware.</p>

  <p>That long chapter of the cruelty of the Roman public shows may, perhaps,
  leave with the children of the modern world a feeling of self-complacency.
  Yet it might seem well to ask ourselves&mdash;it is always well to do so,
  when we read of the slave-trade, for instance, or of great religious
  persecutions on this side or on that, or of anything else which raises in us
  the question, &ldquo;Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this
  thing?&rdquo;&mdash;not merely, what germs of feeling we may entertain which,
  under fitting circumstances, would induce us to the like; but, even more
  practically, what thoughts, what sort of considerations, may be actually
  present to our minds such as might have furnished us, living in another age,
  and in the midst of those legal crimes, with plausible excuses for them: each
  age in turn, perhaps, having its own peculiar point of blindness, with its
  consequent peculiar sin&mdash;the touch-stone of an unfailing conscience in
  the select few.</p>

  <p>Those cruel amusements were, certainly, the sin of blindness, of deadness
  and stupidity, in the age of Marius; and his light had not failed him
  regarding it. Yes! what was needed was the heart that would make it
  impossible to witness all this; and the future would be with the forces that
  could beget a heart like that. [243] His chosen philosophy had
  said,&mdash;Trust the eye: Strive to be right always in regard to the
  concrete experience: Beware of falsifying your impressions. And its sanction
  had at least been effective here, in protesting&mdash;&ldquo;This, and this,
  is what you may not look upon!&rdquo; Surely evil was a real thing, and the
  wise man wanting in the sense of it, where, not to have been, by instinctive
  election, on the right side, was to have failed in life.</p>
