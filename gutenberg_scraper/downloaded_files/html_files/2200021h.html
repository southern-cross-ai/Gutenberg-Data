<h2><a name="advert" id="advert"></a> ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

<p>IT has been thought that the Public would benefit in more ways
than one, by the publication of a work, in which the philosopher
may read the workings of an unprincipled conscience, the legislator
be let into the operations of the laws upon the criminal's mind,
and the citizen derive a key to the frauds by which he is so easily
and constantly beset; and it is not often that thieves are
possessed of sufficient truth, memory, vanity, and literature, to
tell the story of their own lives. It will be seen that Mr. Vaux,
together with an excellent memory, possesses a good share of
vanity, and sufficient literature. In the following pages, the
former (I think) often magnifies the latter, particularly in the
account of the author's readership at the printing-office; but it
is only justice to him to say, that I have found occasion to make
very few alterations in his manuscript, which came to my hands
ready prefaced and dedicated, and chaptered, as if ripe for his old
master's printing-office&mdash;that it was exceedingly well and
fairly transcribed; and, (with one or two exceptions) correctly
spelled and punctuated.</p>

<p>When Mr. Vaux's predilection for low company comes to be
observed, the reader will justly doubt the great liberality of
education and taste for reading, upon which he so often vaunts
himself. The quotations in his narrative are all common-place; and
I have struck out a few as profaned by misapplication.</p>

<p>As for the truth of the following tale&mdash;nobody can vouch
for it. I am afraid it is occasionally sacrificed at the shrine of
Vanity, who seems to be the author's patron-saint. He is fonder of
confessing himself guilty of frauds, from the punishment of which
he escaped, than of those in which he was found out; detection (he
thinks) impeaches his cunning; and though he recounts with
exultation the theft for which he is now transported for life, that
is, because he knows it was committed under protection of, perhaps,
the most consummate address and assurance ever exhibited by
man&mdash;it amounted to the sublime of impudence&mdash;and, after
all, he was only betrayed into the hands of justice, who, if she
had a hundred eyes, would not (it should seem) have enough to
detect the dissimulations of James Hardy Vaux. The reader will
observe, that he denies his guilt of the crime for which he was
before transported, because it was a common, clumsy partnership
picking a handkerchief out of the pocket; and so, too, he denies
any confederacy with the Judge Advocate's servant, in robbing his
master's writing-desk, for which offence he was further transported
to Newcastle, in this territory, whither he now again is sent for
life, for an attempt to escape from the country altogether. The
reader must, therefore, believe as much or as little as he pleases
of the following story.</p>

<p>Of him who confesses himself a liar, the voice must necessarily
be listened to with distrust.</p>

<p class="poem">"Look to him well; have a quick eye to see;<br>
He has deceiv'd another, and may thee."</p>

<p>By the laws of all nations, he who is once detected in perjury,
is not allowed to bear further witness&mdash;the testimony of a
king's evidence must be corroborated&mdash;and the confession of a
felon is never allowed to prove any thing against another
person.</p>

<p>With this <i>caveat lector</i>, I dismiss this entertaining and
instructive narrative; for so I will call it, thinking it as full
of cunning and adventure as "The Life of Guzman de
Alfarache&mdash;the Spanish Rogue," if not so profoundly moralized.
The religion, indeed, (if it can be so called) of Mr. Vaux is, like
that of most convicts, a low sort of fatalism, which may be called
<i>a fatalism after the fact</i>. The followers of this sect do not
connect predestination with "foreknowledge absolute," but merely
comfort themselves with the truism, that when their
<i>misfortunes</i> have happened, nothing can prevent them from
having happened. Of "free will," they first suffer the time for the
exercise to go by, and then complain of the
impotency,&mdash;abandoning themselves with an insensibility, which
they mistake for resignation, to what they call the predestined and
inevitable decrees of "fixed fate[*]." Some of this false
complaining has been expunged from the following work; but enough
(I am afraid) is left to shew the delusion.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "Le bien, nous le faisons; le mal, c'est le
sort;<br>
"On a toujours raison, le destin toujours tort."<br>
&mdash;La Fontaine.]</p>

<p>It remains only to be added, that the pecuniary profits of this
publication will be applied to the relief of the author, in his
perpetual banishment.</p>

<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>BEFORE I commence this narrative of a life marked with more than
common vicissitudes I beg to bespeak the reader's attention to a
few cursory remarks. I must first promise that I have undertaken
the task, in obedience to the commands of a gentleman, who is
pleased to anticipate a sufficient fund of entertainment in the
perusal, to compensate for the honour he confers in noticing an
outcast of Fortune like myself; who, partly from my own vicious
conduct, and partly (perhaps,) from the malignity of my fate, have
forfeited all hope of attaining that respectable rank in society,
to which, in the happy days of youthful innocence, I had every
reason to look forward with confidence.</p>

<p>But now, alas! although I have too late seen my errors, and my
intentions are strictly virtuous, I have nothing to expect, but to
continue through the remainder of this transitory life, such as I
am at the present moment,&mdash;an unhappy exile, for ever banished
from my country and relations, and rendered incapable of making the
smallest reparation to the community I have injured, by the
exercise of those talents which nature has bestowed, and the best
of friends have so liberally cultivated. Nor do I fear being
accused of vanity, in asserting, that they are above mediocrity,
since it is not to myself I am indebted for them; and the greater
infamy attaches to me for their perversion,&mdash;for where much is
given much is required.</p>

<p>To return to the remark I set out with: these sheets not being
intended at first for the press, or to meet the public eye, I have
not laboured their composition. Indeed, the work being executed in
haste, and under many local disadvantages, I have had little time
for study, and can only boast of a scrupulous attention to truth,
to which I have been enjoined by my employer.</p>

<p>Where my conduct has been such as I now blush at, I have
"nothing extenuated;" nor have I, on the other hand, used the
smallest embellishments to advance myself in the good opinion of my
readers. With me, in all human probability, the die is cast; and as
the prejudices of those persons, who alone can extricate me from
misery, are not likely to be removed by any professions of
amendment I can make, my only hopes of happiness are centred in a
better world, where we are instructed that there is much joy over
one single repentant sinner.</p>

<h2><a name="dedication" id="dedication"></a>DEDICATION.</h2>

<h3>To THOMAS THOMPSON, Esq.,<br>
<br>
(Captain in His Majesty's 46th regiment), Commandant of Newcastle,
in the Colony of New South Wales, and one of His Majesty's Justices
of the Peace for that Territory.)</h3>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Having, in obedience to your commands, completed the following
narrative of my adventures I should deem myself wanting in
gratitude, were I to omit offering, at the same time that I
respectfully submit my production to your perusal, the humble
tribute of my thanks, for the many favours I have received at your
hands; for the indulgent treatment I have generally experienced;
and more particularly for the distinguished honour you have
conferred on so unworthy an object as myself, in condescending to
feel an interest in the occurrences of my former life, and in
permitting me to inscribe to you, the following Memoirs of it.</p>

<p>I beg to assure you, Sir, that, however Fate or Fortune may
hereafter dispose of me, the remembrance of your goodness will
never be effaced from my mind; and that in the event of my past
sufferings inducing you to use your bountiful influence in my
behalf, and to procure me once more the probable means of attaining
a respectable rank in society, my future conduct shall be such, as
to prove that you have not erred in believing me radically
reformed, and deserving the honour of your patronage.</p>

<p>In the sincere hope that these sheets will contribute to your
entertainment, and that of such friends as you may be pleased to
communicate them to,</p>

<p>I have the honour to subscribe myself,<br>
with the most dutiful respect,<br>
Sir,<br>
your obliged and grateful<br>
humble servant,<br>

<h2><a name="ch101" id="ch101"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p><i>Some Account of my Family.&mdash;My Birth and subsequent
Adventures until I attained my ninth Year.</i>
</p>

<p>IT may be expected that, like other biographers, I should give
some account of my ancestors. This I can but imperfectly do; for
the volatility of my disposition, and the early age at which I left
my friends, prevented me from ever making pointed inquiries on the
subject. Family pride I have ever considered as the most ridiculous
of all human weaknesses. However, as I am writing facts, be it
known, that my progenitors, by the mother's side, were of no mean
rank; my great-great-grandmother, Dorothy, the daughter of Sir
Thomas Hartopp, Bart. of Ragby, or Ragley Castle, in
&mdash;&mdash;shire, was united, after a long and romantic
courtship, to a gentleman named Yonge, and from this union sprang a
very respectable family, the Yonges of &mdash;&mdash;shire, who are
still of some consequence in that county.</p>

<p class="a">page 2</p>

<p>This scrap of genealogy I should probably have been unacquainted
with, but for the circumstance of two original love-letters,
interchanged between the parties above-mentioned, during the period
of their courtship, and still preserved in the family as antiques.
These epistles are written in the most pathetic strain, and,
allowing for the age in which they were composed, abound in elegant
diction. My grandmother, Dorothy Yonge, married Mr. Lowe, a
respectable attorney of the court of King's-Bench, who for many
years filled the office of clerk to the warden of the Fleet, and
had, besides, a very extensive private practice. The only issue of
this marriage was my mother, who was brought up with the most
affectionate tenderness, and well educated. By what means she
became acquainted with my father, who was from a very distant
county, I never learnt; but she was united to him in the year 1781,
and, as I have reason to think, against the advice and will of her
parents, my father being of a family much less respectable, and, at
the time of his marriage, in no higher situation than that of
butler and house-steward to Mr. Sumner, a member of parliament,
whose estate was situated near Guilford, in Surrey; where my
mother, it appears, went to reside after her union, of which I was
the first fruits, being born at</p>

<p>page 3</p>

<p>the village of East Clandon, on the 20th of May, 1782. My father
shortly afterwards quitted the family of Mr. Sumner, and obtained a
similar post in the service of Sir Richard Hill, Bart., with whom
he continued several years.</p>

<p>In the year 1785, my grandfather, being advanced in life and
naturally fond of domestic retirement, quitted the profession to
which, by his integrity and honour, he had long been an ornament;
and prevailing on my parents to commit me to his care, removed with
my grandmother to S&mdash;&mdash; in S&mdash;&mdash;shire, I being
then about three years of age. In this neat little town, surrounded
by the relatives of my grandmother, and many friends of his own, my
grandfather having served his clerkship in the county, this worthy
and truly virtuous couple enjoyed, for several years, uninterrupted
happiness, their only care being centred in the education and
indulgence of their grandson, of whom they every day became more
extravagantly fond.</p>

<p>As my years increased, I was transferred from the preparatory
school, at which I had been first placed, to a respectable seminary
in the town, one of the best the county afforded, where I received
the rudiments of a general education, and my capacity for learning
endeared me still more to my indulgent friends. The imprudence of
my mother's conduct had much lessened her in the affectionate
esteem of her parents; nor did her subsequent behaviour, I believe,
tend to restore her or recommend my father to their good opinion;
so that their correspondence grew every year less frequent, and at
length settled in a formal coldness on both sides. What may appear
more unnatural, though not uncommon, is, that in proportion as the
kindness and liberality of my grand-parents towards me increased,
the affection of my father and mother diminished; and, as they had
several children afterwards, I soon became an object, if not of
aversion, at least of indifference. Of these children, two brothers
and a sister died in their infancy, and two sisters younger than
myself are still living.</p>

<p>Nothing worth record occurred during my continuance in
S&mdash;&mdash;shire. I passed my hours of relaxation, like other
children, in harmless sports, but attended with avidity to my
lessons when at school; and indeed as soon as I was capable of
understanding, my chief delight was in reading books of an
entertaining nature, from all of which I derived more or less
instruction. I even preferred this rational amusement to the
childish games of my young companions, from which my good friends
prognosticated that I should become a great man. I must confess
that I was already a spoiled child; but I did not abuse the
indulgence I met with, by any irregular or vicious conduct, nor did
I betray any symptoms of latent depravity, or indicate any wicked
propensities. I hope my readers will believe this assertion when I
relate by what gradations I fell from the path of rectitude, and
when I account for the causes which actuated me to pursue a course
of dishonesty. My principal delight, when very young, was to
frequent the only bookseller's shop our little town afforded, where
I would stand for hours reading, or rather devouring, whatever
books, or, as my dear grandfather termed it, mental food, I could
lay hold of. There was also an old woman who had a circulating
library, consisting of about a hundred volumes, chiefly novels, to
whom I disbursed every sixpence and shilling I received for pocket
money. My parents, indeed (for by this term I shall in future, for
brevity's sake, call my grandfather and grandmother, as it is from
them only I ever experienced parental affection; they, I say) did
not wholly approve of this indiscriminate passion for reading;
fearing, and indeed with reason, as I am now convinced, that I
should meet with matter tending to vitiate a young mind (which has
been justly compared to a sheet of white paper, open to receive and
retain the first impressions), and to inculcate romantic notions of
men and manners. Though I subscribe to the justice of this idea in
general, yet I firmly believe it was owing to this course of
reading that I very early acquired a knowledge of the world,
surprising in one so young; and that when I soon after launched
into the ocean of life, I was on my guard against many of the
deceptions of the designing part of mankind and enabled to avoid or
defeat them. My beloved parents, indeed, suspected not the errors
to which I was becoming daily a stronger proselyte. My grandfather,
whom I believe to have been as perfect a character and as good a
christian as nature ever formed, inculcated both by precept and
example, the love and practice of piety and virtue; and, above all,
an inflexible adherence to honesty. He possessed many peculiarities
of habit as well as principle, several of which I inherit from
him;&mdash;would to Heaven I inherited his virtues!</p>

<p>My volatile disposition was early manifested by my want of
stability or steady application to any particular employment or
pursuit. Like Robinson Crusoe, I felt a strong predilection for
rambling into foreign countries, and had a longing desire to go to
sea. This Arose from perusing the Voyages of Cooke, Anson, and
other circumnavigators; so enraptured was I with their profession,
that before I was twelve years old I had a pretty just notion of
nautical manoeuvres, without having ever seen a ship, and had most
sea-terms at my tongue's end. This rising inclination was, however,
checked for a time by the dissuasions of my friends, who were
alarmed at the bare thought of it, and by the inland situation of
the county we resided in. Among my domestic amusements I practised
drawing, for which I had a good natural genius; but happening to be
furnished with some prints of running horses for imitation, and
being a great admirer of that noble animal, I suddenly turned my
whole attention to this subject, in which I soon became a pretty
good proficient, considering my youth and that I never had any
master, and it appears to have been my <i>forte</i>. These prints
having always the pedigree and performances of the animal
subjoined, insensibly gave me a passion for racing, which became my
next hobby-horse. I tow eagerly perused the <i>Racing Calendar</i>,
took in the <i>Sporting Magazine</i>, purchased a
<i>Stud-Book</i>[*]; and was so indefatigable in my researches,
that, before I was fourteen, I could repeat the pedigree of any
celebrated horse, and could discourse of handicaps, and
give-and-take plates, of the <i>Beacon Course</i>, and the
<i>Devil's Ditch</i>[**], with the fluency of a veteran
jockey&mdash;and I actually stole a march from London to Newmarket
in hopes of obtaining a situation in the racing stables; flattering
myself that I might, like the great Dennis O'Kelly[***], whose life
I had read, become in time a shining character on the turf; but I
failed in this attempt to disgrace my friends, and degrade myself,
as my youth and genteel appearance deterred the persons to whom I
applied from listening to my request.</p>

<p class="footnote">[*** Proprietor of the celebrated horse
<i>Eclipse</i>.]</p>

<p>I shall now resume the thread of my narrative.</p>

<p>After six years' residence at S&mdash;&mdash;, my grandfather
was prevailed on, by the solicitations of my father and mother, to
return to London, and reside with them. My father, from whom I
probably derived my disposition to instability, had by this time
quitted the service of Sir Richard Hill, and established himself in
the hat and hosiery business in Great Turnstile, Holborn. How this
chimerical project occurred to him, I know not, as he certainly had
been bred to no trade; however, he was sanguine in his hopes of
success. He had taken a good house and shop, and on our arrival in
town, we found the family very comfortably established. I was
introduced to my two surviving sisters, who were pretty, lively
girls, and my father and mother received me with a shew of great
affection.</p>

<p>I was now turned of nine years old, and shortly after our
arrival, was placed by my grandfather at a respectable
boarding-school at Stockwell,in Surrey, and my sisters were soon
afterwards settled by their father at one equally genteel at
Oakingham, in Berkshire. As I shall not have occasion to say much
more of these girls, I shall now briefly observe that they received
a good female education, learning French and the other fashionable
accomplishments of the age. Their capacities were good; they were
both more than agreeable in their persons, and their dispositions
uncommonly sweet.</p>

S&mdash;&mdash;shire.&mdash;Different Plans proposed for my

</p>

<p>I CONTINUED at Stockwell nearly three years, during which time I
acquired a tolerable knowledge of the classics, and became as
perfect in the French language as I could do without residing in
France. It was a custom at this school to allow of no English being
spoken, except in the hours devoted to instruction, by which means
our progress in French was much facilitated'. The scholars had free
access to a well-selected library, by which means I gratified my
passion for reading, which increased with my years. I was
particularly fond of plays, and fancying I possessed some talents
for the stage, I actually formed the design, in conjunction with a
youth of good family, to elope from the school and join a company
of strollers, with the manager of whom he had formed an
acquaintance in London; but this hopeful scheme was frustrated by
the young gentleman's sudden removal to the University. I was now
taken from school, the excessive fondness of my dear parents not
being able to brook a longer separation from me. I found these kind
benefactors in private lodgings, they having quitted my father's
house on account of family disagreements. The latter had
relinquished the hat business, by which he was <i>minus</i> some
hundreds of pounds; and after a short lapse of time, he embarked in
a very different trade, that of a tallow-chandler, of which he had
conceived favourable ideas: in this too, he failed of success, and
was equally unfortunate in several subsequent speculations, by
which means he considerably impoverished himself; however he
continued to maintain appearances with tolerable credit until his
decease. I shall now take leave of my father, mother, and sisters,
for the present, their history having no further connexion with my
own life, as I never again became an inmate of their family.</p>

<p>After a short residence in &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Square, my
grandfather, on account of his wife's declining health, and with a
view to economy in house-keeping, that he might be more liberal in
his bounty to myself, thought fit to remove to Wisbeach in
Cambridgeshire, where an old schoolfellow of his resided, who had
strongly pressed this measure. Here he took a neat little house
ready furnished, and placed me under the tuition of a clergyman in
the town, whose school I attended daily.</p>

<p>At the end of twelve months, we again returned to London, and
soon afterwards removed once more to S&mdash;&mdash;shire, in the
14th year of my age.</p>

<p>I was most affectionately received by all my relations, and it
was now considered time to consult upon my future disposal. My kind
grandfather, who had been at so much care and expense in my
education, had always intended me for one of the liberal
professions, and, as was most natural, he would have preferred his
own. I had a great uncle who had been a very eminent surgeon and
apothecary, in which business he was succeeded by his son, who is
still living in credit at S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. It was in
contemplation to have me articled to this gentleman, but I wished
for a more active employment, and should have preferred the army or
navy. The dangers attending these honourable professions, were
however insuperable bars to the consent of my fond parents.</p>

<p>At this juncture a most advantageous and unexpected offer of
patronage was extended in my behalf, which but for my unaccountable
obstinacy, would have been thankfully embraced; but my evil genius
rendered abortive a design, which bade fair to procure me an
honourable rank in society. The case was as follows: Within a mile
of our little town resided John Moultrie, Esq., whose father was
governor of a British Settlement in North America, and of whose
name frequent mention is made in the history of the ill-fated war
with that country. By his attachment to the cause of loyalty, this
gentleman, as well as his son, suffered considerable losses in
their private property, for which in common with many others,
Governor Moultrie, on his return to England, received a liberal
pecuniary compensation from ministers. The old gentleman was at
this period lately deceased, and his son John succeeded to a large
fortune, and a fine estate and mansion-house called Aston, which
his father had purchased in the situation above described. He had
married a very beautiful and accomplished woman, born in America,
by whom he had an only son about my own age, who was like myself
the darling of his parents. This youth (named Austin) had been my
early schoolfellow and playmate; and the Moultrie family being in
the habit of exchanging visits with most of the respectable
inhabitants of S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, among which class my
relations were numbered, I became known to them. As they perceived
a growing attachment between myself and the young Austin, and my
manners pleased them, my visits were encouraged, and I was almost a
constant guest at Aston Hall. By the circle of genteel persons of
both sexes with whom I there associated, my address was improved as
well as my understanding. Young Moultrie and myself became
inseparable; we were constant companions in the chase and other
rural sports; and when the weather was unfavourable, Mrs. Moultrie
took delight in hearing me read her favourite authors, to which she
obliged her son to attend; and as I had rather the advantage in
mental acquirements, she was pleased to say that I contributed to
his improvement. In a word, I may truly assert that the happiest
moments of my life were spent in this amiable family.</p>

<p>At the period of which I am now writing, the parents of my young
friend had determined on settling him at the University of Oxford,
in order to complete his education: and the regret they felt at
parting with their beloved child, was scarcely more poignant than
that of the latter, at his approaching separation from me, so
ardent was our juvenile friendship. In this state of affairs, his
father knowing my situation, and the circumstances of my
grandfather, who by his liberality towards me, had much impaired
his private fortune, which consisted at his retirement, of but a
few thousand pounds stock in the 3 per cent consols, a considerable
part of which he had sold out at a very disadvantageous rate, by
reason of the great depression in stocks at the commencement of the
French war: knowing all this, and that my settlement in life was at
this moment the subject of much perplexity, Mr. Moultrie, with a
most unparalleled generosity, offered to place me at college on the
same terms with his son, and at the end of three years, if he then
withdrew the latter, to take upon himself the charge of my future
fortune. Here was an offer from a gentleman of £2,000 a year!</p>

<p>I have always been of Shakspeare's opinion, that "There is a
tide in the affairs of men," &amp;c., and that most men have not
only one, but several opportunities of attaining honour and
prosperity. I know this has been my own case, but my ill destiny
has hitherto rendered such chances unavailing. I have unhappily
neglected to "take die current while it served." So, in the present
instance, having foolishly conceived, that to be immured within the
walls of a college for several years, would deprive me for so long
a time of the gratifications I expected, both of mind and body, on
making my débût on the stage of life, when I should be released
from the constraint of parental authority; the idea of losing so
much valuable time, which I fancied I could employ to much more
advantage, induced me to protest in strong terms against the
measure proposed; and my too indulgent parents at last gave way to
my puerile remonstrances, and declined with the best grace they
could the kindness intended me. This impolitic step was much
censured by my other relations, particularly two maiden aunts, from
whom I had great pecuniary expectations; however it was soon after,
consented to by all parties, that I should be sent on trial, or as
it is called, on liking, to a respectable mercantile concern at
Liverpool. The parties were Messrs. Swan and Parker, very eminent
linen-drapers, who besides an extensive retail trade, exported very
largely to the East and West Indies, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A cousin of mine had been placed with these gentlemen a few
years before, but from ill health was obliged to return to his
friends at S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. His father, the junior Mr. Yonge
I have before mentioned, had paid one hundred guineas with him as a
premium; and as the young man's indisposition prevented him from
reaping the benefit of his engagement, Messrs. Swan and Parker very
handsomely consented to take me as an apprentice without any fee,
by way of remuneration to the family. My grandfather indeed did not
much relish the idea of a yard and a pair of scissors; he had
fondly hoped to see me profit by the education I had received, in a
very different line of life; but as I seconded the general wish of
my friends on this occasion, and much time had been already lost in
deliberation, all opposition ceased; and I accordingly set out well
equipped with all necessaries, by the stage coach for Liverpool,
where, on my arrival, I was kindly received by my new masters: and
the next day instructed in the nature of my duty, and the economy
and rules of the house. Having now brought the reader to an epoch
in my life, which promised considerable advantage to my future
prospects, I shall put an end to the second Chapter.</p>

</p>

<p>I WAS, now turned of fourteen; my health and constitution good,
my spirits elevated, and I felt all those pleasing sensations,
which naturally arise in a youthful mind, happy in conscious
innocence, and flattered by the prospect of rising to honourable
independence. The gaiety and bustle of this beautiful and improving
borough at once charmed and amused me; I spent a week in viewing
the public buildings, the environs, &amp;c.; but above all, my
admiration was excited by the numerous and capacious docks, by
which ships of large burden are admitted, as it were, into the
heart of the town, and discharge their rich and varied cargoes with
surprising facility, which are deposited in spacious warehouses, of
amazing extent, and from twelve to fourteen stories high, with
which these noble docks are nearly surrounded.</p>

<p>The opportunities I had, during my residence in Liverpool, of
viewing the daily arrivals and sailings of merchant-ships to and
from all parts of the world, particularly the Guineamen, which
formed a remarkably fine class of vessels[*], revived the latent
desire I had for a sea-faring life; and I wanted but little
incitement, had the smallest opportunity offered, to take French
leave of my masters, and gratify my rambling propensity. However,
the bustle in which I was continually involved, and the new scones
of amusement which every succeeding day presented, suppressed the
inclination for a time; but that it was not totally subdued, will
be seen hereafter.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* This was prior to the abolition of the Slave
Trade.]</p>

<p>The establishment and economy of our house were upon the most
regular plan; the former consisted of six apprentices, (including
myself,) and four assistants at very liberal stipends, besides a
nephew of the elder partner who superintended the whole, and
officiated in the compting-house: there were also several porters,
and other subordinates, for all of whom full employment was found.
Being the junior apprentice, it was my province to polish the
counters, trim the lamps, carry out small parcels, and-to perform
other inferior duties; when disengaged from which, I assisted in
waiting on the retail customers, and making myself otherwise useful
behind the counter. We had a plentiful table appropriated for us,
to which we retired in turn during the hours of business;
commodious and airy chambers; and, in short, enjoyed every comfort
we could desire.</p>

<p>For the first month of my probation, I behaved extremely well,
and by my quickness and assiduity, gained the good opinion of my
employers, who wrote of me in the most favourable terms to my
friends in S&mdash;&mdash;shire; nor did my expenses exceed my
allowance for pocket-money, which was fully adequate to every
rational enjoyment.</p>

<p>Among my fellow apprentices, was a young man named King, some
years older than myself, with whom, from a similarity of
sentiments, I formed a close intimacy. He was of an excellent
disposition, but a great lover of pleasure; and as his servitude
was far advanced, and his prospects peculiarly flattering, he was
under very little restraint, but gave the rein to his passion for
dissipation. His expenses were profuse, but whether he indulged in
them at the expense of his probity, I could never ascertain. He
soon introduced me to several young men of his own stamp, and I
became in a short time as great a rake as the best of them: nor was
our conversation confined to our own sex; scarcely a night passing
without our visiting one or other of those houses consecrated to
the Cyprian goddess, with which the town of Liverpool abounds.</p>

<p>In such a coarse of life, it is not likely that I could submit
to limited hours; my companion and I seldom returned home before
midnight, and sometimes not till the ensuing morning. Though we
took measures to keep this from the ears of our employers, it could
not fail to be known in time; and the consequence was, a strong but
tender remonstrance on my impudence, which much affected me at the
moment; but the impression was transitory, and soon effaced. I
plunged deeper and deeper in the vortex of folly and dissipation,
until I Was obliged to have recourse for advice to the Aesculapius
of Gilead-house.</p>

<p>This irregular mode of life had borne hard on my finances, but I
had not, as yet, had recourse to fraud or peculation. I was
liberally supplied by my relations, on leaving S&mdash;&mdash;, and
had received my first quarterly allowance; but an event, which soon
followed, tempted me to the first breach of confidence and
integrity.</p>

<p>I had in my youth been passionately fond of Cocking, a sport for
which the county of S&mdash;&mdash; has been always famed; and
though so young, I had constantly kept several cocks at walk,
unknown to my parents; so that I had acquired a considerable share
of experience and knowledge on the subject. One day, when I was
sent with some muslins to wait on a lady in the environs of
Liverpool, near the Canal, I accidentally passed a cock-pit, where
a great crowd was assembled; and I understood that a grand Main was
about to commence. Elated at this pleasing intelligence, I hastened
to execute my commission; and returning to the house, entered it,
and leaving my wrapper of goods in care of the landlady, I ascended
to the pit, and took my seat. The company was, as usual, of a
motley description, but there were many genteel persons. I ventured
a few trifling bets at first with various success; but at length an
opportunity offering, which I considered as next to a certainty, I
laid the odds to a large amount, flattering myself that by this
stroke of judgment, I should be enabled to figure away with
increased eclat among my gay companions.</p>

<p>After I had so done, greater odds were still vociferated, but in
a moment the scene was changed! the fallen cock, in the ironies of
death, made a desperate effort, and rising for a moment, cut the
throat of his antagonist, who was standing over him, in the act of
crowing with exultation on his victory! The latter immediately
fell, choked with the effusion of blood, nor did the victor survive
him many moments. The whole pit resounded with acclamations, and
the discord which ensued beggars description. I was not the only
sufferer by this revolution of fortune; many others had laid higher
odds than myself, and to a much greater amount, I was soon
surrounded by my creditors, to whom I disbursed every shilling I
had about me, among which were some pounds I had just received from
the lady for goods, and for which I had given her a receipt, I was
still something deficient, for which I pledged my honour to one of
the parties, giving my address, and promising payment on an early
day.</p>

<p>I now returned home, filled with remorse and shame; but as the
first false step of a young person insensibly leads to another, I
added to my guilt by concealing the affair from my employers, and
directed them to book the articles the lady had selected. I had a
degree of false shame about me, which rendered me incapable of
confessing the truth and promising amendment, or all might still
have been well. In the evening I had recourse to the bottle to
drown my chagrin; and I determined to purloin a certain sum every
day, in the course of my attendance on retail customers until I had
liquidated my debt of honour! Then, I vowed to stop and reform.
Delusive idea! how little did I then know my own weakness, or the
futility of such resolutions in a young mind! And who, that once
begins a career of vice, can say to himself, "Thus far will I go,
and no farther?" After I had discharged my engagement, I found a
small sum must be raised for pocket-money, and other exigencies, as
it would be above two months before I could expect a
remittance.</p>

<p>I therefore continued my peculation, and at length my evil
genius suggested to me, that I might, by venturing a small sum,
become more fortunate at the cockpit, and repair the loss I had
sustained; as miracles don't happen every day, and the odds must
win in the long run. Thus I argued with myself; and, fatally for
me, I tried the experiment.</p>

<p>From this moment I never missed a day's fighting at the
cock-pit; and when sent on business which required my speedy
return, I could not tear myself from the spot, but frequently staid
out several hours, and afterwards forged a lie to account for my
delay. I sometimes came off a winner, but as I was not then
acquainted with the art of hedging, by which the knowing ones
commonly save themselves, I was sure to be a loser at every week's
end.</p>

<p>I managed matters so well, indeed, that my frequent secretions
from the till, were not discovered, however they might be
suspected. The extensive trade of the shop rendered it next to
impossible; and what I abstracted, was a trifle compared to the
gross receipts of the day.</p>

<p>My continued misconduct became now the subject of frequent
remonstrances on the part of Mr. Parker the resident partner; which
not having the desired effect, that gentleman wrote to my friends,
informing them in general terms, that I had unhappily formed
improper connexions, and that my late levity of conduct rendered me
unfit to be received into their house; therefore, desiring I might
be recalled without delay. Mr. Parker concluded with a remark,
which I shall never forget, and which was peculiarly gratifying to
my grandfather's (perhaps too partial) feelings: after expatiating
on my general capacity for business, he added "his smartness and
activity are really wonderful."</p>

<p>This letter produced a speedy answer, in consequence of which, I
was directed to hasten my departure, which took place in a few
days, Mr. Parker giving me a great deal of wholesome advice at
parting; observing that although it was not in his power to charge
me with any direct criminality, my inconsiderate behaviour, and the
continued excesses of my conduct, left but too much room for
unfavourable conjectures.</p>

<p>Behold me now returned to my grandfather, after an absence of
nearly five months; and this excursion may be called my first
entrance into life. I could not help blushing at the consciousness
of my own unworthiness; but the blind partiality of my dear
parents, induced them to believe me less culpable than I really
was; and to listen readily to any thing I had to offer in
palliation of my errors.</p>

</p>

<p>SHORTLY after my return from Liverpool, finding the narrow
limits of a small market-town too circumscribed for my active
disposition; and nothing having been determined on, as to my future
disposal, I entreated my parents to let me go to London, which I
had always considered as the grand field for talents of every
description; and where I doubted not of forwarding myself, by the
exercise of those I possessed. They at length consented, and after
the necessary preparations, I set out, receiving the blessings and
prayers of these indulgent benefactors, and moderately supplied
with money for my reasonable necessities.</p>

<p>My grandfather had of course many acquaintances in London, of
his own profession, to several of whom he furnished me with letters
of recommendation; it being his wish, that I should by a few
months' practice in a law office, ascertain how far I was disposed
to be articled for the usual period, necessary to procure my
admission. I had always been prepossessed in favour of this
profession, which I knew from my reading and experience, to abound
in variety, and, if I may be allowed the phrase, in pleasing
perplexity.</p>

<p>On my arrival in town, I waited first on a relation of our
family, Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, a young man lately established in the
profession, and received as a partner by Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;, a
gentleman of large fortune, and extensive practice, who would, it
was probable, in a few years' time, retire from business in favour
of my cousin.</p>

<p>The latter received me very kindly, and without hesitation,
offered to employ me (with his partner's concurrence) as copying
clerk, at a weekly salary, which to a youth like me, was of course
but small.</p>

<p>As I conceived this offer too advantageous to be rejected, I
thankfully embraced it, and immediately entered on my function in
Lincoln's-Inn New Square.</p>

<p>As I had no motives of affection to attract me to my father's
house, I determined on becoming master of my own conduct; and
accordingly took a neat private lodging, and regulated my mode of
life conformably to the state of my finances. I breakfasted at
home, dined at a tavern or genteel eating-house, and in the evening
took my tea and read the papers at a coffee-house: after which I
sometimes passed the night in reading at home, but most commonly
went to one of the theatres at half-price, where I gratified my
violent passion for the drama, which at once improved my
understanding and amused my mind.</p>

<p>This course of life, though it rapidly weakened my purse, was
rational, compared to that which I soon after led, and I might have
supported it with credit, by the indulgence of my friends, for a
considerable time. As the business of our office was of a various
nature, I soon gained great experience in the different branches of
common law, and conveyancing: I became by practice, an expert and
correct copyist; and I delighted much in studying the most approved
law books, reading reports of cases,&amp;c. I became familiar with
<i>Burn's Justice</i>, and soon gained a pretty correct knowledge
of the criminal law, and of those minute points, of which an able
counsel or attorney can avail himself, in order to rescue a client
from the claws of justice, howsoever glaring and palpable his guilt
may be. Such is the glorious uncertainty of the English law! Little
did I then conceive how useful this knowledge might one day prove
to myself; of which more hereafter. I merely pursued this intricate
study by way of exercising my ingenuity and gratifying my
curiosity.</p>

<p>I must here inform the reader, that these various pursuits and
studies were not confined to the short term of my continuance in
the employ of which I am now writing. After I quitted the office of
Messrs. M&mdash;&mdash; and P&mdash;&mdash;, and during the course
of a wild and dissipated life, they formed one of my favourite
domestic amusements; as did in fact reading in general: and
throughout the most profligate stages of my future career, which I
shall hereafter narrate, a portion of my time was always devoted to
the perusal of books, and a part of my money, however hardly or
dishonestly obtained, to the purchase of them: and to this moment I
still consider them the most valuable property a man of my
disposition can possess.</p>

<p>About three months after my arrival in town, I began to grow
less regular in my manner of life; my expenses increased; and I
became negligent of the office hours. I had contracted an intimacy
with several young persons of both sexes, which unavoidably engaged
me in a course of expensive dissipation, to which my means were
inadequate. Though I occasionally derived small supplies from my
grandfather, yet as he had no idea of the extent of my expenditure,
they were comparatively trifling. Mr. P&mdash;&mdash; finding I was
not to be reclaimed by advice, and having no authority to use any
other means, at length for the credit of his office, and for fear I
should contaminate the other clerks, gave me a formal, though civil
dismissal, which I received without surprise, as I knew I had long
deserved it.</p>

<p>I was now tired of the law, or rather of the restraint I was
under, in an office of that description; but still I found
necessary to have some employment, as well to amuse me, as to
contribute to my support.</p>

<p>I therefore engaged myself as assistant in the warehouse of
Messrs. Key and Sons, wholesale stationers in Abchurch-lane,
Lombard-street, at a weekly salary of one guinea; which was more by
half than I had received from my last employers, and equal to the
pay of an experienced clerk in an attorney's office at that time of
day. This situation I obtained through the interest of one of my
fellow-rakes, the son of a substantial citizen, who roundly vouched
for my integrity and diligent conduct. My employment here was to
superintend the packing of goods for exportation and home
consumption; to write invoices; copy letters; ship goods at the
Custom-house,&amp;c. I continued, however, but a short time in this
situation; confinement to the east end of the town prevented my
associating with my old acquaintances, who chiefly dwelt in the
environs of Covent-garden, or the purlieus of Drury-lane.</p>

<p>During an abode of ten months in London, as I was frequently
pushed for money, I availed myself of a genteel appearance, and
pretty good address, and taking advantage of the credulity of
several tradesmen in the neighbourhood, I ordered wearing apparel
of various kinds, and sometimes other goods, upon credit, without
much concern about the day of payment; however I always took care
to procure a bill of parcels with the articles, which precluded any
charge of fraud, and left the matter at the worst but a debt
contracted; for which, being a minor, I knew I could not be
arrested. This was my first deviation from honesty, since I left
Liverpool. I was also frequently obliged to change my lodgings;
and, as payment of my rent would have required ready money, for
which I had so many other uses, I commonly decamped under favour of
the night, having previously removed my effects by various
stratagems. As I was ashamed to let my grand-father know the true
state of my affairs, and as I really grieved at the expenses I had
already caused him, which I knew had much inconvenienced him, I
forbore at last, to trouble him for remittances; but falsely
assured him that I was doing well, and enabled to live upon the
profits of my industry. I desired he would abandon the idea of
articling me to the law, as the expenses attending admission had of
late years been so much increased by stamp duties; and as I could,
if I continued the study, at a future period, practise under the
sanction of another person's name; a custom then very prevalent,
though irregular.</p>

<p>By these assurances I quieted the good old man, and silenced any
inquiries my friends might have instituted respecting me; as I now
really wished to continue free from all restraint upon my person or
actions, and foolishly flattered myself that I should by some lucky
event, ultimately secure the means of independence. These
conjectures were, however, perfectly vague, and proceeding from no
fixed idea whatever.</p>

<p>On quitting my city employment, I returned to the law, for which
I still retained a partiality; and obtained a more liberal salary
than before in an office equally respectable. Indeed I was now
become more useful, and had improved much both in person and
address since my arrival in town.</p>

<p>I was still frequently reduced to pecuniary straits, and obliged
to have recourse to various expedients, known only to men of the
town, for my support: some of them indeed were bordering on
dishonesty, and none of them very honourable. But to describe them
individually, is impossible, and a man <i>who lives by his
wits</i>, as the phrase is, will assure you, if called to account,
that he really could not for his life, tell by what distinct means
he makes out a living.</p>

<p>As I now wrote uncommonly fast, I quitted the station of a
weekly clerk, and obtained writings to copy by the sheet, from the
law stationers, by which I could earn considerably more money; and
in this employment I continued to labour diligently for several
hours every day, and sometimes half the night.</p>

<p>When I had a mind to relax from this occupation, and
particularly if my finances were at a low ebb, I frequently
resorted to the Blue Lion, in Gray's-Inn-Lane, a house noted for
selling fine ale, and crowded every night with a motley assemblage
of visiters, among whom were many thieves, sharpers and other
desperate characters, with their doxies. I was introduced to this
house (from which hundreds of young persons may date their ruin) by
a fellow-clerk, who appeared to have a personal intimacy with most
of these obnoxious persons; however, though I listened eagerly to
their conversation, (part of which was then unintelligible to me),
and fancied them people of uncommon spirit, I was not yet
sufficiently depraved to cultivate their acquaintance; but sat with
a pipe in my mouth, enveloped in smoke, ruminating like a
philosopher on the various characters who tread the great stage of
life, and felt a sort of secret presentiment, that I was myself
born to undergo a more than common share of vicissitudes and
disappointments. How far these ideas were well grounded, the reader
will judge when he has perused this narrative, of which I shall
here close the fourth Chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="ch105" id="ch105"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p><i>The Trip to Portsmouth.</i>
</p>

<p>DURING my nightly resorts to the Blue Lion, in Gray's-Inn-Lane,
I one evening fell into conversation, at that house, with a young
man of decent appearance, a few years older than myself. We were so
mutually pleased with each other, that at parting, an appointment
to breakfast together the next morning was the consequence, and on
this second meeting, our intimacy so far increased, that we began
to explain our respective situations in life to each other. My new
acquaintance, whose name was D&mdash;&mdash;, informed me that he
had lately quitted His Majesty's Ship Montague, of 74 guns, on
board of which he had served as Steward to the Commander, Captain
Patterson. That having lived freely for some months on shore, he
had now spent all his money, and was so much reduced, that he
really knew not how to subsist any longer, and concluded with
expressing his intention to proceed immediately to Portsmouth, in
the hope of obtaining a similar birth to his former one. I assured
him that I was, like himself, so much reduced, as to find the
utmost difficulty in existing at all, and that if he would permit
me to join my fortune to his, I should without hesitation feel
happy in the opportunity of accompanying him to Portsmouth in quest
of some employment. He declared that nothing would afford him
greater pleasure, and it was agreed that we should, each of us
without delay, convert our spare apparel,&amp;c., into cash, and
set out the very next day. I accordingly lost no time in the
needful preparations, and having bilked my landlord, with whom I
was some few weeks in arrears, I met D&mdash;&mdash;, the same
evening, and after indulging in a farewell cruize, which sensibly
diminished our slender finances, we took a few hours' repose, and
at eight o'clock the next morning, commenced our peregrination.</p>

<p>On a comparison of our personal effects, it appeared that we
possessed between us about twenty shillings in money, and had each
a spare shirt, neck-cloth and hose, in a bundle, which
(traveller-like) we carried across our shoulders on a good
oak-stick. We were both decently clad, in good health, and in high
spirits notwithstanding our poverty. We agreed that to save
expenses, we should perform the journey on foot, (being seventy-two
miles) and we calculated that with frugality, we should be enabled
to defray the contingent charges for diet and lodging on the road.
It soon appeared, however, that though good economists in theory,
we were not so in practice; for as we both loved good cheer, and
the severity of the weather required a suitable fortification, we
had expended half our stock by the time we got to Kingston, our
first stage, and only twelve miles from town. Here we put up at a
public-house, called The Eight Bells, and having enjoyed a good
dinner, which was succeeded by some excellent mulled elder wine of
the landlady's own composition, and which was peculiarly adapted to
the season of the year, we liked our quarters so well that we spent
not only the night, but half the next day in the enjoyments of
repose, eating, drinking, and smoking, before it occurred to either
of us that every item of those said enjoyments was recorded in
chalk by the hostess, and would inevitably be consolidated in the
shape of a bill, which we must discharge before a clearance could
be obtained for the next port.</p>

<p>Having at length recollected ourselves, and called "to pay," our
reckoning amounted to three or four shillings more than we
possessed in our common purse. As it was impossible to think of
proceeding any further without recruiting, we were now in no small
consternation. Bilking the landlady was out of the question, for we
had given our bundles into her charge on first entering the house,
and their contents were not only indispensably necessary to us, but
also worth more than the sum required to release them. In this
dilemma, a sudden thought struck me. Calling for pen, ink, and
paper, I told my companion I had a scheme in my head for raising a
supply, but would not impart it until I had tried its success. I
then drew up a sort of Memorial to the following effect:</p>

<p class="letter">"To the Ladies and Gentlemen of
Kingston.&mdash;The writer hereof, a young man of respectable
family, and good education, having by a series of misfortunes, been
reduced to the greatest distress, is now on his way to Portsmouth,
in hopes of procuring a situation in the navy; but being destitute
of money for his present support, humbly solicits your charitable
assistance towards enabling him to pursue his journey. To a noble
mind, the pleasure of doing a good action is its own reward. The
smallest donations will be gratefully received, and any lady or
gentleman inclined to relieve the writer is earnestly requested to
subscribe his or her name hereto."</p>

<p>Having completed this production, I desired my friend to wait
patiently for my return, and assured him I doubted not of bringing
speedy relief. I now set out on my expedition, and immediately
waited on Mr. Mayor, who was a grocer, but in this first essay I
was unsuccessful. His worship declared he never encouraged
applications of this sort from strangers; and desired me to go
about my business. I, however, took the liberty of subscribing his
name to my memorial, by way of sanction, and gave his charity
credit for a donation of five shillings. Young as I was at that
time, I well knew that example, in matters of this kind, goes a
great way; and that many persons, without a grain of christian
benevolence in their composition, will give liberally from motives
of ostentation, when they see that their neighbours have already
contributed, and that their own names and donations will also be
made public.</p>

<p>I experienced the truth of this notion, for I was successful in
almost every application I afterwards made. Having visited a number
of genteel houses, with various success, I was on the point of
returning, to impart my good luck to my companion, when coming to a
very handsome mansion-house in the suburbs of the town, I thought I
ought not to omit calling, and a person at that moment passing by,
I inquired whose residence it was, and which was the entrance to
the premises; for the house was situated in the midst of a spacious
pleasure-ground, remote from the high road, and it being quite
dusk, I had not observed any avenue by which I could gain access to
it. I was informed that it was the residence of Lady
W&mdash;&mdash;, that a little further on, I should perceive a door
in the brick wall, which extended along the road-side, and that if
I entered at that door, and proceeded in a strait direction, I
should arrive at the servants' hall; but my informer cautioned me
to keep close to another wall on my left hand, which divided this
avenue from the lawn in front of the mansion, because there was a
very large and fierce dog at the upper end, but which, being
chained up, could not reach me, if I followed the above directions.
I thanked this obliging person, and immediately proceeded to the
door described, which I entered, and walked cautiously, and not
without some fear, by the wall-side, till I perceived by the lights
in the kitchen, and out-offices, that I was near the premises.</p>

<p>It was now very dark, and I was carefully exploring my way, my
mind full of apprehensions at the thought of this terrible dog;
when lo! at that instant, to my inexpressible consternation, the
ferocious animal made a spring at me, and I gave myself up for
dead. However, though he was certainly within a yard of me, he did
me no mischief, but my alarm was so great, that without knowing
how, or where to fly for refuge, I ran precipitately from the spot,
and when I recovered from the fright, found myself in the
pleasure-ground in front of the mansion-house. It appeared that I
had, without knowing, escaped through a door in the wall, which was
open on my left hand at the moment I was alarmed by the dog. I was
now more at a loss than ever, for I knew of no way to get out of
the pleasure-ground, except by the aforesaid door, and fear of the
dog prevented my attempting that passage. After wandering about for
a few minutes, I approached the mansion, and going up to one of the
parlour windows, which were very large, and on a level with the
terrace before the house, I applied my eye to the glass, and
discovered through an aperture in the inside shutters, a numerous
and splendid party of ladies and gentlemen at dinner. Having
considered a moment, I determined on a very bold step, as I saw no
alternative but remaining all night in the open air, exposed to the
inclemency of the weather. Taking advantage of a pause in the
company's conversation, I tapped with my finger at the window, and
immediately the whole party were struck with wonder. In the midst
of their surprise I repeated my knock, and then, after several
voices exclaiming, "Good God! there is certainly somebody at the
window,"&amp;c., a gentleman rose from the table, and advancing
towards me, opened first the shutters, and then the window itself,
which might, in fact, be called a pair of folding doors, and these
being thrown back, I walked in with the most respectful air I could
assume, and presented myself to the astonished company. Having
bowed twice or thrice, and given time for their alarm to subside, I
began to make my speech.</p>

<p>Apologizing for my presumptuous intrusion, I stated in a concise
manner, the fright I had endured, from the dog, my embarrassment at
not being able to find means of egress from the pleasure-ground,
and my having consequently taken the liberty of knocking at the
window. I then presented my memorial, which was read in turn by
most of the company, each of whom surveyed me with evident
surprise. Having answered such queries as they thought proper to
put to me, I was desired by the lady of the house to withdraw to
the kitchen for a short time, and a servant was ordered to attend
me thither. Here I had my story to repeat for the information of
the domestics, who laughed heartily at the adventure of the dog,
but afterwards seriously assured me, that had the animal not been
chained, or had I approached within his reach, he would inevitably
have torn me to pieces. The parlour dinner being over, and the
dishes brought out, I was desired to fall to, and being really
hungry I wanted no pressing, but selected from the variety of good
things on the table a very fine buttock of beef, on which
substantial fare I made a sumptuous meal. There was no scarcity of
good malt liquor, and Lady W&mdash;&mdash; very kindly sent me out
a pint of Ted port, with a particular injunction (which by-the-by
was unnecessary,) that I should eat and drink heartily.</p>

<p>At length I was summoned to attend the company in the parlour,
and her ladyship then expressing her concern for my misfortunes,
and her anxious hope that I should speedily find an end to them,
presented me with half-a-guinea. The rest of the party also said
many handsome things, and the majority of them contributed to my
relief. In addition to these favours, one of the gentlemen, at the
particular request of Lady W&mdash;&mdash;, took the trouble to
write a letter in my behalf to the captain of a man-of-war,
supposed to be then lying at Portsmouth, entreating him to give me
an appointment under him. Her Ladyship, after obliging me to take
another glass of wine, and repeating her sorrow for my distress,
advised me to lose no time in prosecuting my journey, ordered a
servant to conduct me to the door at which I had first entered her
premises, and I took a respectful leave of this truly benevolent
party.</p>

<p>Returning to the Eight Bells, I imparted my adventures to my
friend, who was, of course, much pleased at my success, for I had
realized between four and five pounds. I found this begging scheme
so productive, that I was in no hurry to pursue the Portsmouth
speculation, and as we were both satisfied with our present
quarters, it was agreed that we should continue a few days longer
in Kingston, in which time I proposed to follow up my success by
making a regular circuit among the inhabitants; and I, in fact,
determined to levy similar contributions in every town which lay in
our route.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, that this idea of raising money was
perfectly original in me, for at that time I had never heard of
such a practice, but have since discovered that it is a very common
expedient, and is called by those persons who live by such
impositions, "<i>the Letter Racket.</i>"</p>

<p>The following day I again sallied forth, and met with equal
success, visiting not only the houses of private persons, but even
the respectable shop-keepers,&amp;c.; and I may here state, once
for all, that in the course of this, as well as my subsequent
speculations of the same nature, I met with various receptions,
according to the charitable or churlish dispositions of the people
to whom I applied. Many pitied my case and cheerfully relieved me.
Others expressed equal commiseration, but declined giving any
thing, either because "they never encouraged beggars," or "they had
poor enough of their own to maintain." Some invited me into their
parlours, treated me with excessive politeness, and obliged me to
take refreshment at their own tables; and where there were any
young ladies in the family, I was an object of particular
solicitude, and the recital of my misfortunes drew many a sigh from
their tender bosoms. Others desired me, like the Mayor of Kingston,
to go about my business, and hinted that I ought to be sent to the
house of correction as a vagrant. Sometimes the servants who
admitted me refused to present my memorial, declaring they had
strict orders from their masters or mistresses never to trouble
them on such an occasion.</p>

<p>The donations I commonly received, were from one shilling to
five; sometimes, but rarely, I was presented with gold,
particularly at the seats of the nobility and gentry, all which,
laying within a short distance of the road I travelled, I made a
point of calling at; and for my information on this subject, I
provided myself with a comprehensive book of roads, in which those
objects are correctly laid down. Some truly charitable persons, but
whose means were limited, relieved me with sixpence, and of course
I was bound to accept such a trifle with as much appearance of
thankfulness, as I would a larger sum; and frequently when I called
at a farm house by the roadside, I have been compelled to take some
cold meat, or other eatables, which I afterwards bestowed upon the
first more needy beggar I met on my way. It was my custom in
general, to travel on foot, making short stages, and putting up at
a good inn in every town I entered, where I lived upon the best
during my stay, and associated with London riders, and other
respectable guests. When tired of walking, I availed myself of a
passing stage-coach, or return post-chaise, and my only equipage
was a, spare shirt, handkerchief,&amp;c., which, with my book of
roads, I carried in a small bundle under my arm.</p>

<p>To resume my narrative, I returned from my second day's
excursion about dusk in the evening, and entering the Eight Bells,
was surprised at not finding my companion within. On inquiring of
the landlady, the good woman informed me, with some degree of
terror, that two of the town constables had been in search of me;
and kindly exhorted me, if I was conscious of having done wrong, to
make the best of my way from Kingston, as she expected them to call
again every minute, adding that she believed my friend was gone out
in quest of me. I smiled at the landlady's fears, and thanking her
for her friendly advice, assured her I was unconscious of any
crime, and should willingly face the officers, come when they
might. I then desired to have some tea, which she set about
preparing, during which interval my fellow-traveller came in. I
briefly concerted with him the part we should respectively act, in
case of our being called upon to give an account of ourselves,
though I had no conception on what grounds I was to be apprehended.
We now proceeded to take our tea, but before we had half finished
it, the constables entered the room, and informed me they had
orders to carry me before the magistrates, who were then assembled
in the town-hall; and that the young man, who they understood to be
my comrade, must also accompany me.</p>

<p>I answered, I would with pleasure attend them, but requested
time to finish our repast, which they consented to allow us; and we
then proceeded all together to the town-hall, the officers carrying
our two bundles, which they had obtained from the landlady by order
of the justices. Being brought before the bench, I immediately
recognised among the persons in attendance, one of the gentlemen I
had seen at Lady W&mdash;&mdash;'s dinner party, and the very same
who had written the letter of recommendation to Captain
&mdash;&mdash;. This gentleman now stated to the magistrates the
circumstance of my coming to Lady W&mdash;&mdash;'s house the
preceding evenings the extraordinary manner in which I had made my
appearance, and the reception I met with; and farther stated, that
the ensuing morning it was discovered that a part of the fence
enclosing the pleasure-ground had been broken, and other damage
done on the premises, which led to a suspicion that I might be an
impostor, who had a design to rob the house, or do some other
mischief, and that he, therefore, on the part of Lady
W&mdash;&mdash;, wished me to be examined by their worships, and
obliged to give some further account of myself.</p>

<p>Though the suspicions of Lady W. and her friends appeared to
have been very weakly founded, and their idea to be utterly
extravagant, the justices entered seriously into the spirit of the
business, and ordering us to be set apart from each other,
proceeded to interrogate us strictly as to our professions,
business in Kingston, the objects of our journey,&amp;c. I, for my
part, adhered to the story I had before framed, which it is
needless to repeat to the reader, being devoid of interest, and as
it was for the most part utterly false, I cannot now minutely
recollect it. My companion's account of himself was nearer the
truth. He stated that he had been an officer's servant in the navy,
and was now on his way to Portsmouth in quest of a similar
situation, but denied any further knowledge of me than joining me
by accident on the road, and as I was bound to the same place, we
had agreed to keep each other company. Our bundles being next
inspected, were found to contain nothing of a suspicious nature,
except a number of pawnbrokers' duplicates, and these we
respectively accounted for as relating to wearing apparel,&amp;c.,
which our pecuniary distress had obliged us to pledge. This part of
the story was indeed strictly true, and in any case corroborated,
and gave an air of probability to my account. Nothing appearing to
warrant the detention of my companion, he was discharged, but with
a positive order to quit the town instantly. As to myself, having
mentioned in answer to a query from one of the magistrates, the
name of a certain gentleman, in London, who knew me and my family,
his worship declared he was himself intimately acquainted with that
gentleman, and as he was going to town the next day, he should make
a point of referring to him as to the truth of my assertion. He
therefore ordered a constable to detain me in custody until his
return from London. I was accordingly confined in the officer's
house, where I had every necessary accommodation, for the expense
of which the magistrate himself very kindly became accountable. My
companion visited me the same evening, prior to his departure, and
I divided with him the money I had acquired. It was his intention
to proceed direct to Portsmouth, and I promised, as soon as I was
liberated to follow him, taking a direction whereby to find him on
my arrival.</p>

<p>The ensuing evening the magistrate returned from town, and
immediately sent for me to his own house. Being brought before his
worship, who was a brewer, named Sidebottom, I found him seated,
not on the chair of justice, but on a stool in his
accompting-house. The old gentleman began by remarking with some
severity, on the impropriety and turpitude of my conduct, in
withdrawing myself from the protection of my respectable friends,
and traversing the country under such debasing circumstances. He
said he had understood from his friend Mr. Howell, that my
relations were both able and willing to take care of my fortunes.
After a long expostulation to the same effect, his worship
continued: "Perhaps you are not aware that it is in my power to
commit you to bridewell for a month for begging without a pass."
Then raising his voice and brandishing his pen, he exclaimed with a
very pompous air, "Young man, I shall certainly discharge you." The
two latter words relieved me from a momentary anxiety; for when his
worship paused, I certainly expected he would add "commit you." He
proceeded, "but, on the express condition that you immediately quit
this town, and return to your friends. If you are found hereabouts
after this night, expect to be severely dealt with." I gladly
accepted these terms, and assuring the old gentleman of my
compliance, took a respectful leave, his worship giving me a little
more wholesome advice, and generously presenting me with
half-a-crown, as he said, to carry me to London.</p>

<p>Being now discharged, I repaired to the Eight Bells, where I
settled with my landlady, and learnt from her that my companion had
left Kingston the preceding night at a late hour, by the Portsmouth
coach. I slept this night at the Eight Bells, and the next morning
returned to London, where on my arrival I found myself in
possession of above five pounds, after all the impediments I had
met with.</p>

<p>As I made a point of keeping my word with my late
fellow-traveller, I determined on having one jovial evening in
town, and resuming my journey the next day, by the same route as
before, notwithstanding Justice Sidebottom's prohibition. As to
presenting myself to Mr. Howell, or going near any of my friends,
nothing was more foreign to my thoughts.</p>

<p>The following morning, I accordingly set out on my second
expedition by the Kingston stage, and arriving at that town, took
up my lodging at a public-house in the suburbs. Notwithstanding the
check I had before met with, I was so hardy as to stop three days
in Kingston, during which I levied contributions on most of the
inhabitants, taking care to avoid that part of the town I had
before visited, and I was so lucky as to meet with no interruption
to my success. From Kingston I proceeded to Guildford, taking in my
way, Cobham, Ripley, and the intervening villages; from Guildford
to Godalming, thence to Liphook, where I altered my course, and
took a circuitous route by the way of Chichester, to
Portsmouth.</p>

<p>This journey occupied about a fortnight, and arriving at
Portsmouth, I soon found my late companion, D&mdash;&mdash;, who
was lodged at the house of an acquaintance, and not having yet
obtained a birth on ship-board, had engaged himself as an
occasional clerk and assistant to a tradesman in the town. I myself
hired a small apartment in St. Mary's street, intending to remain a
week or two in Portsmouth, where I had never before been, and to
enjoy such amusements as the place afforded, as long as my money
lasted. As my friend D&mdash;&mdash; appeared to have dropped the
idea of going on ship-board, I became also careless on that
subject, particularly as the motive which gave rise to that design
(namely, poverty) no longer existed, for I was now possessed, after
all the expenses of travelling,&amp;c., of about fifteen
pounds.</p>

<p>I spent several days in viewing the town, dockyard,
fleet,&amp;c., and in the evening generally visited the theatre,
which was then open. About a week after my arrival, reading the
Portsmouth weekly paper, I saw an advertisement for a clerk; and as
I found that some means of subsistence would soon become necessary,
and it was indifferent to me in what part of the kingdom I
sojourned, I determined to offer myself. Inquiring, as directed, of
Mottley, the bookseller, on the Parade, I was referred to Moses
Greetham, Esq., judge-advocate, also an attorney of the first
eminence. That gentleman, without hesitation, engaged me at a
guinea a week, and I next morning commenced my attendance at his
office in High-streets About the same time, my companion
D&mdash;&mdash; suddenly quitted the town, without acquainting me
of his intention; and I was informed, on inquiry, that he had gone
to Southampton, but on what speculation I never learnt, nor did I
ever afterwards see or hear more of him.</p>

<p>The nature of my new employment was very agreeable and full of
variety. Besides Mr. Greetham's public duties on courts-martial,
and his general practice as a solicitor, he had a great deal of
business relating to prizes, their condemnation, sale,
proceeds,&amp;c.; and on these occasions all the parties concerned
met in a spacious room at the Crown inn, where an elegant dinner,
with wines in abundance, was invariably provided at the expense of
the clients. These dinners occurred three or four times every week,
and as they were afterwards succeeded by coffee,&amp;c., the
expenses of living, to myself and the other clerk of Mr. Greetham,
who (as well as the latter gentleman), always partook of the
entertainment, were considerably diminished. During intervals,
between dinner, tea,&amp;c., we retired to an adjoining room, where
an hour or two was devoted to writing depositions, examining ships'
papers, and other matters relative to the cause in question. This
was, in fact, one of the best situations I ever met with, and, from
its respectability, would, no doubt, had I continued steady, have
ultimately led to prosperity and independence; but my evil genius
interposed to ruin this, as well as all my former hopes of
happiness.</p>

<p>The circumstance which occasioned my losing this place was
indeed very trivial, and hardly amounted to a crime. Among the
number of persons with whom we transacted business, was a native of
Holland, who acted in many cases as an interpreter to Mr. Greetham,
on the part of those concerned in prize causes. This man being an
original, both in person and manners, was an inexhaustible subject
of laughter to myself and fellow-clerk, who was much older than me,
and we omitted no opportunity of indulging in mirth at his expense.
As he was not possessed of much penetration and was of a very
placid disposition, he was commonly insensibly of our jokes, or, at
least, took them in good part; but one afternoon, when we were all
three taking coffee together, the Dutchman rising from his seat on
some occasion, with a cup of boiling hot coffee in his hand, my
brother-clerk, who was just then in a merry vein, winked at me to
withdraw this interpreter's chair. I obeyed the signal with
alacrity, and the poor fellow, attempting to resume his seat, was
in a moment thrown keel upwards, and, as he fell, received the
boiling fluid full in his face.</p>

<p>I was so unfeelingly mischievous as to laugh immoderately at the
pain and embarrassment of the poor Dutchman, who certainly cut a
most ridiculous figure; but my fellow-clerk, who possessed more
prudence than myself, restrained his mirth, and, with a serious
air, affected to condole with the sufferer on his misfortune. He
even carried his hypocrisy so far as to express displeasure at the
mischievous trick I had played. I felt much indignation at his
duplicity of conduct, and regretted, when too late, that I had
suffered myself to be made the dupe of his treachery; for <i>I</i>
was afterwards convinced that he was jealous of my abilities, and
feared I should supplant him in the favour of Mr. Greetham. The
consequence of this injudicious frolic was, that the interpreter
complained to my employer, who the next morning rebuked me severely
for behaving with such unbecoming freedom towards a respectable man
in his immediate service; and, observing that such levity of
conduct rendered me unfit for his office, Mr. Greetham presented me
with a guinea, although this was only the second day of the week,
and declared he had no further occasion for me.</p>

<p>Being now once more disengaged, I began to think of returning to
London; but, having still a little money left, I continued about a
week longer in Portsmouth, during which time I took up my lodging
at the Blue Posts' tavern, in Point-street, where I lived in the
most sumptuous manner, drinking my wine freely, and pretending that
I was waiting for the departure of the East India fleet, in which I
was going out a passenger, and that I expected my baggage from town
in a few days. I had, while in the service of Mr. Greetham, made
several efforts to obtain clothes,&amp;c., upon the credit of my
living with that gentleman; but I found the Portsmouth tradesmen
too wary to be imposed upon, and only succeeded to a very trifling
amount. I had, however, bilked my late lodging in St. Mary's
street, and intended playing the same trick at the Blue Posts.
Finding, at length, that the landlord and waiters viewed me with
scrutinizing eyes, and appeared tacitly to ask for payment of my
reckoning, I left the coffee-room one evening after dinner, on
pretence of going to the play, and immediately quitted the town,
taking the road to Petersfield on foot.</p>

<p>On arriving at the latter place, which I had omitted in my
journey downwards, by striking into the Chichester road at Liphook,
I levied a small contribution, under the old pretext of going to
Portsmouth,&amp;c., and then pursued my course to London, where I
arrived in good spirits, after an absence of eight weeks, with
about ten pounds in my pocket, having lived well during my
expedition, and enjoyed a variety of pleasant entertainment.</p>

</p>

<p>I HAD continued some months in this course of life, and was
frequently reduced to very great shifts; on these occasions I had
recourse to those accommodating persons, called pawnbrokers, who
obligingly lend money at die moderate interest of seventy-three
hundred per cent.! as has been clearly proved in a late
publication. I sometimes raised the wind by my old expedient of
obtaining goods on credit called in the cant language
<i>maceing</i>: these I converted into ready money for immediate
purposes. By such artifices I contrived to support a genteel
appearance, though sometimes bordering on the shabby. My principal
enjoyments, indeed, were not of the most extravagant nature, with
the exception of theatrical amusements. I commonly spent my
evenings (if not at the Blue Lion), at some genteel porter or
chop-house, frequented chiefly by attornies' clerks and the
neighbouring tradesmen; where I enjoyed a pipe and an evening
paper, and at the same time listened to the conversation of the
surrounding guests, amusing myself with their various characters
and peculiarities. I frequently dined, from the same motives, at
different ordinaries, particularly one at the Saracen's-Head,
Snow-Hill.</p>

<p>One day, after dining at this house, I adjourned to the
coffee-room, and, seating myself in a box, called for a glass of
negus, and a daily paper. I was soon joined by a gentleman of a
very prepossessing aspect, who I perceived, by the buttons on his
coat, to be a warrant officer in the navy. After the customary
compliments, we entered into conversation; and he soon let me
understand that he was surgeon of a frigate called the
<i>Astraea</i>.</p>

<p>Delighted with an opportunity of expatiating on my favourite
topic, I asked many questions concerning the service; and the
eagerness of my manner convinced this gentleman that I had a strong
inclination to enter into it. He appeared pleased with my vivacity
of manner, and the pertinence of my remarks; and having extracted
from me a confession of my inclinations, and a brief account of my
family and expectancies, he, with the greatest kindness, undertook
to write in my favour to Captain Dacres, his commander, who was
then at his seat in Devonshire, the frigate being in dock at
Sheerness; assuring me there was little doubt of my obtaining a
midshipman's birth, provided my friends would consent to it, and
lit me out in a suitable manner for the occasion. I was in raptures
at the result of this fortunate meeting; and expressing the warmest
gratitude for such friendship shewn to an utter stranger, assured
Mr. Kennedy (for this was the surgeon's name), of my choice being
approved by my grandfather, who anxiously wished me to fix on some
profession, which might afford a prospect of future
independence.</p>

<p>It was therefore settled that Mr. Kennedy should write to the
Captain without delay, and that I should immediately entreat my
grandfather to sanction my views, and to write also to Capt.
Dacres, requesting his approbation and commands respecting me. Mr.
Kennedy further recommended that I should, in the interim, take a
trip to Sheerness, and wait on the commanding-officer, Mr. Rowley,
who was then, with the <i>Astraea</i>'s crew, on board the Carolina
hulk, during the frigate's repair. For this end he furnished me
with a line of introduction to Lieut. Rowley, and added that he
should himself be at Sheerness, where his family resided, in a few
days. He observed that I should be much amused with the excursion,
as I had never been on board a king's ship, and that I should also
open an acquaintance with the young gentlemen who, in all
probability, were to be my future messmates and companions.</p>

<p>I immediately wrote in the most pressing terms to my
grandfather, assuring him that his refusal to ratify my choice
would render me completely miserable; but that if I was indulged in
my desire, I would never again become troublesome to any of my
friends, or betray any future signs of inconstancy or caprice. I
concluded with expressing my hopes of his receiving a favourable
answer from the captain, and that I should in a few days have this
intimation communicated in a letter from himself, approving of the
steps I had taken.</p>

<p>Having so done, I equipped myself as handsomely as my means
would admit, and the next day set out for Sheerness, where I
arrived in high spirits, and proceeded on board the Carolina. On
presenting my credentials to the first lieutenant, I was very
politely received, and invited to the ward-room, where I was
introduced to several other officers, who, on learning my
intentions, and that I was recommended by the doctor, welcomed me
in the kindest terms, and highly commended my spirit. After
refreshing myself, Mr. Rowley sent for a midshipman, whom he
requested to shew me every attention, and to introduce me to his
messmates as a person likely soon to become a brother Mid. This
young man obeyed, with the greatest pleasure, and I soon became
perfectly at home.</p>

<p>My conductor next took me through every part of the hulk, and I
was both pleased and astonished at the novelty of the objects I met
with. The hulk had been a line-of-battle ship, and her interior
was, of course, extensive and capacious. The decks were crowded
with hucksters, who exposed provisions, fruits, and other articles
for sale. Groups of sailors with their girls were seen dancing to
the music of a fiddle or a fife; others were engaged at cards,
draughts,&amp;c. Grog was every where the order of the day; but
still the most perfect regularity and cleanliness pervaded every
part of this wooden world. Having satisfied my curiosity, I
returned to the midshipmen's birth, which was merely a large space
in the after-part of the orlop deck, enclosed with canvass, to
render it warm and private. I obtained from these young gentlemen a
list of such clothes, books, instruments,&amp;c., as were requisite
to form a genteel out-fit; and an estimate of the probable cost of
the whole, which I found to be at least 80<i>l</i>. I now received,
by the ward-room steward, an invitation to dine with the
lieutenants,&amp;c. The party was increased by the company of some
ladies from the shore, and the repast was excellent. Wit, wine, and
grog, abounded, and I now conceived I had found the sphere of life
in which I could enjoy unalloyed happiness.</p>

<p>After sitting a reasonable time, I expressed a wish to view the
town of Sheerness, the dock-yard,&amp;c., and requested Mr. Rowley
to permit the midshipman before-mentioned to go on shore with me.
To this he kindly assented, and ordered a boat to be manned on
purpose; stipulating, however, that we should return at a
reasonable hour, and that I would make use of a spare cot, in the
cabin of die third lieutenant, who was absent on leave. My kind
young friend shewed me the objects most worthy of remark; aud we
then adjourned to the Marlborough-head inn, where we took some
coffee, and about eight o'clock returned to the hulk. My conductor,
having reported his return to the first lieutenant, wished me good
night, and I took a seat at the ward-room table, where the party
was now reduced to the first and second lieutenants, the master,
purser, and lieutenant of marines.</p>

<p>I now found that grog was to be the order of the night also; but
as I had never been accustomed to that beverage, in the way they
drank it, I could not help betraying my dislike; on which Mr.
Rowley, in a good-humoured way, assured me that I should never make
a sailor without I could learn to drink grog. I was therefore
constrained to make a glass, which I did pretty stiff, as the
sailors term it; and its inspiring qualities soon caused me to
banish all reserve. Mr. Rowley conversed with great appearance of
regard on my future prospects; gave me a most amiable character of
the captain; and instructed me in the outlines of my duty, as well
as in the conduct I ought to pursue for my own advantage. He
informed me, the <i>Astraea</i> would be undocked in about three
weeks, and that I had therefore no time to lose in equipping
myself.</p>

<p>After as pleasant and rational an evening as I ever remember to
have spent, I retired to rest in the neat little cabin, I have
before mentioned; and slept for the first time in my life on
salt-water. The next morning, after breakfast, I had the pleasure
of seeing my worthy friend, the surgeon, who had just arrived from
town. He insisted on my dining with himself and family ashore; I
therefore took a respectful leave of Mr. Rowley, and the other
gentlemen in the ward-room; a most cordial farewell of my brother
Mids, as I was proud to call them; and, receiving the wishes of all
parties for my speedy return to join the ship, I accompanied Mr.
Kennedy on shore. I spent a pleasant day at his lodgings, and in
the evening set out on my return to London, highly pleased with my
excursion, and indulging the most pleasing hopes of future
happiness.</p>

<p>In a week's time, I had the pleasure of receiving a letter from
my grandfather, wherein he informed me that my entreaties were
granted, though with much reluctance on the part of most of my
friends; and enclosing a handsome letter from Captain Dacres, who
expressed his willingness to receive me as a midshipman on board
His Majesty's ship <i>Astraea</i>, out of respect to the
recommendation of his surgeon, and because he would not defeat the
hopes of a young man who might one day prove an ornament to the
service. My grandfather concluded with desiring I would immediately
come down to S&mdash;&mdash;shire, for the purpose of taking leave
of my friends and receiving the necessary sum to defray the
expenses of my equipment.</p>

<p>I obeyed this welcome summons without delay, and, after a stay
of several days at S&mdash;&mdash;, I took an affectionate leave of
all my relatives, who could not divest themselves of anxiety on my
account; and returned to town with nearly £100. in my pocket, my
other friends having contributed liberally to assist my grandfather
in this emergency.</p>

<p>On arriving in town, I took lodgings in the New Exchange
Coffee-house in the Strand, being a house frequented by naval
officers, and to which Lieutenant Rowley had recommended me. My
first care was to purchase a large and strong chest, which having
sent to my lodgings, I proceeded to buy linen, bedding, uniforms,
books,&amp;c.&amp;c.; and of course, did not forget an elegant
hanger, a dirk, and a cocked-hat, richly bound with gold lace.</p>

<p>I was so diligent in this affair, that in ten days I had every
thing ready; and, embarking with my luggage on board a Sheerness
packet, the same day sailed down the river Thames. After a
favourable passage, we arrived at Sheerness; and, as we passed
through the fleet, I had the pleasure of seeing my ship lashed
alongside the Carolina, having the preceding day come out of dock.
As soon as the sloop anchored, I went on board the hulk, and was
received with kind encouragement by my superior officers, and with
the most lively pleasure by my future messmates. Mr. Rowley very
kindly sent the cutter to bring my chest,&amp;c., from the packet;
and I was then formally introduced by that gentleman to the
midshipmen's birth. After a jovial evening, spent in festivity and
merriment, I retired to my hammock, in which I slept well,
notwithstanding the novelty of my situation. The next day was spent
in overhauling my chest, as the young, tars termed an inspection of
its contents; and I had the pleasure to. find, that my judgment and
taste in the purchases I had made, were universally approved of.
Day after day increased the happiness I felt in my novel and
respectable situation; and my gratitude to those who were, under
Providence, the promoters of my good fortune.</p>

<p>The mess, of which I was become a member, consisted of eleven
persons; namely, nine midshipmen of different ages, the captain's
clerk, and surgeon's mate: the latter was a most curious character,
a Welshman named Jones; and reminded me, on a very short
acquaintance, of Morgan in <i>Roderic Random</i>, whom he resembled
in many particulars: and I soon found that he was, like, him, a
kind of butt for the others to exercise their waggery upon; but in
the main he was a good-hearted, inoffensive young man. The
captain's clerk was a genteel youth, who had served under his
present commander several years, and was in expectation of being
soon promoted to the rank of purser, through his interest. Of the
rest, two or three were midshipmen who had also served nearly the
limited term; one a toaster's mate, and the rest youngsters of
different ages. The whole were of good families, and liberally
supported by their friends; I was called upon to subscribe my
monthly quota towards the mess, which was received by one of the
senior members, acting as caterer; and a plentiful sea-stock of all
necessary comforts was daily accumulating, preparatory to our
approaching cruise in the North-sea, to which station the
<i>Astraea</i> belonged.</p>

<p>About a week after my joining the ship, the captain came on
board, received me very politely, and gave vote the best advice as
to my future conduct. He was an old officer who had been at sea
from his youth, possessed an excellent heart, and a most
conciliating address, blended with the bluffness and unaffected
good humour peculiar to seamen. He was advanced in years at the
time I served under him; and I perceive by a late <i>Navy List</i>
that his long and meritorious services have been rewarded with the
post of Governor of the Naval Asylum, an institution which does
honour to the country and the government that established it.</p>

</p>

<p>IN a few days, the frigate being completely equipped, was cast
off from alongside the Carolina, and all hands being on board, we
dropped down to the Nore, from whence we sailed for Yarmouth Roads,
where the admiral of the North Sea fleet was then lying; soon after
which we put to sea, on a cruise off the coast of Holland. I
immediately applied myself assiduously to the study of navigation,
in which I was so successful, that I was in a few weeks capable of
keeping a dead reckoning. It was required of the midshipmen to
deliver in daily at noon, an account of the ships course,
distance,&amp;c., performed in the last 24 hours. These different
calculations, deduced from the remarks on the log-board, were
presented to the captain, who, on a comparison of the whole, formed
his opinion of the several operators' ingenuity, and praised or
censured accordingly.</p>

<p>I had the satisfaction to find that my performances were
generally approved of, and gained me much applause from their
correctness. This success was probably owing to the advantages I
possessed over most of my companions, in point of education,
improved by extensive practice in figures, and to a closeness of
application arising from my experience in the world, of which they
(whose acquirements were merely scholastic) were incapable. I was
remarked also for the neatness and perspicuity with which I kept my
log-book and journal, which I never suffered, like many others, to
be in arrears. I was not quite so happy in my efforts to become a
good practical sailor. I learnt indeed, with great facility, the
names and uses of every rope in the ship, and could apply to them
without hesitation on all occasions, and I had a correct idea of
the manoeuvres necessary in tacking, wearing, reefing,&amp;c., as
far as theory extended; but unhappily my constitution being
naturally delicate, and my nerves uncommonly weak, I found myself
much embarrassed, when duty or inclination prompted me to go aloft,
on which occasions I was subject to a giddiness in my head, which
rendered my situation extremely perilous, and though I endeavoured
by perseverance to overcome this weakness, I could never totally
banish the timidity with which I was affected.</p>

<p>On this account, though I continued indefatigable in every other
point of my duty, I desisted, particularly in blowing weather, from
ascending "the high and giddy mast;" and I am firmly persuaded that
it is only by going to sea at a very tender age, that youth in
general are rendered callous to danger, and insensible of those
fears, to which I was at all times more or less subject. It is also
probable that the various excesses in which I had indulged since I
first quitted my friends, had contributed to impair a constitution
naturally fragile, and to relax still more the nervous system. Our
first cruise produced no incident worth notice. We maintained our
station, when the weather would permit, off the Texel, and were
frequently so near the land, that we could distinguish and count
the Dutch fleet, lying at anchor in that harbour, from our
mast-head: but Mynheer was not disposed to put to sea, of which
event we were ordered to convey immediate intelligence to the
admiral. The winter was now approaching, and there was every
appearance of its proving unusually inclement.</p>

<p>During this cruise, we lay-to for twenty-one successive days, in
a tremendous gale from the N. E., with only a storm jib, and
fly-sail set; and although we were in no immediate danger, having
good sea-room, and a tight ship, I found my ardour for a sea-faring
life considerably abated. I was obliged to turn out of a warm bed
at 12 or 4 o'clock in each night, to take my watch, the hardship of
which duty was a severe penance upon me. The excessive cold, added
to loss of rest, produced a drowsiness which rendered me incapable
of resisting the inclination I felt to sleep, whenever I could
retire to a private spot unobserved; which was generally in the
long-boat, under a gun carriage, or some such hiding place. I was,
however, frequently discovered in my retreat, by accident, or by
the mischievous information of some watch-mate, whose hardy frame
was proof against fatigue. On those occasions the lieutenant of the
watch would order the rest of the midshipmen to throw a
horse-bucket of salt-water over me, which did not fail to awaken me
quickly: but on starting up, shivering and amazed, I could never
ascertain the perpetrators of this ablution, who having
disappeared, would come up to me, very gravely condoling on my
misfortune, which they stated to proceed from a grampus having
blown over me from alongside. This piece of sea wit, which I soon
understood, produced a general laugh at my expense; however I was
as ready at other times to practise the same exploit upon some
other unlucky sleeper; and my chief consolation was, that the farce
always ended with the sufferer being ordered to take off his wet
clothes, and turn in to his hammock, which sometimes saved two or
three hours on deck.</p>

<p>At other times, sleeping on our watch, or other instanced of
remissness in duty, were not so slightly passed over; we were
sometimes sentenced to sit on top the main-top-mast head, for two,
four, and sometimes eight hours; at other times to sit on the
weather cat-head, exposed to a cutting wind; and other similar
punishments, depending on the humour or severity of the officer of
the watch. In addition to the hardships and fatigues of duty, I
began to find my situation in the mess grow daily more irksome. I
soon perceived that a midshipman's birth (or mess-room) is an
epitome of the world at large, the weaker party goes to the wall,
and is subject to many insults and impositions from those who are
his superiors in seniority, strength, or interest. There were also
frequent instances of intrigue and treachery; and as among so many
persons there must be various dispositions, there were not wanting
envious and malicious minds, whose delight was in fomenting
mischief and detraction. Being naturally of a peaceable turn,
hating nothing so much as a life of dissension, and abhorring
tyranny of every description, I now wished myself emancipated from
this state of bondage, as to me it seemed; and I discovered, when
too late, that "all is not gold that glitters," and that the
situation of a midshipman (which I had once considered the
<i>summum bonum</i> of honour and happiness) was not, any more than
others, wholly free from care and inquietude. However I continued
to weather the gale, as well as I could; and conscious of the
rectitude of my intentions, suffered patiently those little
mortifications I had not power to avert.</p>

<p>After a cruise of two months, we returned to port, when I had
the pleasure of hearing from my respected friends in
S&mdash;&mdash;shire. Our stay in Yarmouth roads was short; we put
to sea again in company with several smaller vessels, of which our
captain was commodore. A violent storm, however, soon dispersed our
little squadron, and we at length with much difficulty gained the
river Humber, from whence we returned to Yarmouth. During this
winter we were continually at sea, except for very short intervals;
and the oldest seaman in the ship declared they had never known a
more tempestuous season. Several fine frigates, sloops, brigs,
&amp;c., were lost in the North Sea, and on the northern coasts of
England.</p>

<p>My hardships, of course, rather increased than diminished, and I
heartily repented the step I had taken; not that I disliked the
service, or the mode of living on ship-board; but I found myself
unequal to the duty of watching, &amp;c., and was also
uncomfortably situated with respect to my messmates, whose manners
and ideas of enjoyment did not coincide with mine. The notion of
finding pleasure in books was ridiculed by them; and I was
sometimes told that I ought to have been a parson; but it was
agreed on all sides, that I was better adapted for a clerk than a
sailor. These hints and suggestions were not thrown away upon me; I
felt the force of their justice, and longed for an opportunity of
ameliorating my situation which at length, to my great joy,
unexpectedly occurred.</p>

<p>The captain's clerk I have before mentioned was, by the interest
of Captain Dacres, promoted to the rank of purser; and as soon as
this was known, my brother Mids unanimously advised me, in the sea
phrase, to "bear up" for a scribe; meaning to quit my present
station, and petition the captain to receive me as his clerk. I
took this advice, and was happy enough to succeed. As I had spent
much of my time with my predecessor, and took pleasure in observing
his various public accompts, in the execution of which I had often
assisted him, I required but little instruction to enable me to
undertake this office.</p>

<p>I must not omit to notice here, a laughable incident, consequent
on my dereliction. The midshipmen in general, on the day of my
appointment, surrounded me in our cabin, and with great ceremony,
proceeded to cut off the <i>weekly accompts</i>[*] from the coat I
had on; proclaiming, at the same time, that I had now assumed a
different character, and had no further right to the honourable
uniform of a Mid. I was obliged, therefore, to have this appendage
taken from every coat and jacket I possessed.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The small square white patches on each side
the collar of a midshipman's coat, having an anchor button in the
middle of it are facetiously called <i>Weekly Accompts</i>, from
their resemblance to a flag hoisted by the port admiral, requiring
from the ships in harbour a weekly return of their state and
condition. This flag is blue, with a white field in the middle.</p>
]

<p>Behold me now once more, in my own sphere! Though I had
relinquished the hope of ever becoming an admiral, yet here was
another field for promotion opened for me. After a service of two
years, I might obtain a purser's warrant, which, though a less
honourable station than the former, is perhaps more lucrative, and
certainly less exposed to danger.</p>

<p>I had now a commodious cabin to myself, in which I was free from
interruption, only frequenting the mess cabin at meal times, or
when I was inclined for company. I slept peaceably in my cot, while
my former companions were exposed to the wind and weather upon
deck. As to the duties of my office, they were merely a source of
pleasing amusement to, me: I soon became expert in their
performance; and my attention gained me the esteem of both captain
and purser.</p>

<p>It is needless to trouble the reader with a journal of the
ship's proceedings, during the remainder of the time I continued in
her; it may suffice to state briefly, that we took many cruises in
the North Sea, in the course of which we visited the Orkney Isles,
Leith Roads, the River Humber, Osely Bay, Robin Hood's Bay, Harwich
Harbour, and other anchorages on the coasts of England and
Scotland, to which we were driven by stress of weather, or other
causes. In one of our cruises, we captured a beautiful French
lugger privateer, of fourteen guns, and fifty-eight men, belonging
to Dunkirk, after a chase of three hours, in a gale of wind, in
which, we went at the rate of thirteen and a half knots per hour,
under a fore-sail and close reefed main top-sail only. During the
ensuing summer, being appointed to convoy above three hundred sail
of merchantmen to the Baltic Sea, we lay for several weeks, at
Elsineur, in Denmark; at which place I went on shore, and had some
pleasant rambles into the, adjacent country, visiting Copenhagen
which is twenty miles distant. I also viewed the interior of that
ancient castle, celebrated by Shakspeare in the tragedy of
<i>Hamlet</i>, and many other local curiosities.</p>

<p>The following spring, the <i>Astraea</i> was ordered up the
river Thames, for the purpose of receiving on board two hundred
thousand pounds in specie, which she was to convey to Cuxhaven, for
the use of the Hamburgh merchants. We accordingly came to an anchor
at Greenhithe, sixteen miles from London; and while the ship was
undergoing some little repairs, I obtained leave of absence for
three days, of which I availed myself to visit London, with the
view of having a short cruise in that region of pleasure. As I had
lately received both pay and prize-money, and had also been
economical of what my relations had occasionally remitted me, I was
well provided for the purpose.</p>

<p>On the first night of my arrival in town, I went, of course, to
the play, where I was struck with the appearance of a very
interesting young Cyprian, whom I immediately accosted, and after
the performance, attended to her apartments in Bury-Street, St.
James's. Here every thing was upon the most elegant scale, and I
was so well pleased with my quarters as well as with the lady, that
I did not stir tack or sheet (except on short excursions of
pleasure in which she accompanied me) until the expiration of my
liberty, and then it was with much reluctance, I could tear myself
from this fascinating fair one. I was the more charmed with her, as
she exhibited a generosity of mind, seldom met with in females of
her description: and though she might have extracted from me my
last shilling, yet she was so far from being mercenary, that my
expenses, considering the enjoyments I had experienced, were
comparatively trifling. I returned, then, to my ship in due time,
but still the thoughts of the lovely Miss K&mdash;&mdash;e
incessantly recurred, and prevented my enjoying a moment's peace.
My anxiety was increased by receiving a most affectionate letter
from her, within three days, according to a promise she had given
me at parting, in which she earnestly requested my leave to visit
me on board prior to our sailing. To this I would not, however,
consent, but gave a sort of conditional promise, almost indeed
amounting to a positive one, that I would see her again in
town.</p>

<p>About a week after my return from London, I resolved to pay a
second visit to my inamorata; but as we were now ready for sea, and
expected the specie on board every hour, it was in vain to solicit
leave. I therefore determined to go ashore early as if to spend the
day, which, the whole of the petty officers were allowed to do in
turn. My intention was to go post to London, and after a day and a
night's pleasure, to return on board early the next morning, as I
could easily frame some excuse for staying ashore all night.</p>

<p>From some secret presentiment, however, which I conceived at the
moment I was about to step in the jolly-boat, I hurried down to my
chest, and hastily filling a clothes-bag with linen, gave it to one
of the boys, as if to take to the washerwoman, and immediately
quitted His Majesty's ship <i>Astraea</i> (as the event proved)
never more to return. I procured a man to carry my bag to Dartford,
a post town three miles from Greenhithe, and fifteen from London;
from whence I took a chaise, and in less than two hours found
myself in the arms of my fair enslaver. In order to give the reader
leisure to reflect on the blindness of mankind to their own
welfare, and to revile me in particular, as I deserve, for this mad
and unjustifiable conduct, I shall put an end to this Chapter.</p>

</p>

<p>THE reader will here observe that I had left behind me, on my
desertion, a valuable chest of clothes, books, <i>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</i>, the purchase of which, but sixteen mouths before, had
cost my affectionate friends a large sum; and I had now, by this
rash act, defeated their fondest hopes, and brought disgrace as
well on them as on the worthy officer who procured me the
appointment. It is impossible, however, for my reader to condemn my
folly, or rather wickedness, in stronger terms than my own
conscience has ever since done. Surely there must, let moralists
argue as they will, be something like a fatality which governs the
fortunes of some, if not all, men; and which impels them headlong
to their ruin, against the voice of reason and of conscience, and
the dictates of common sense. But the retrospect affects me too
much: I must not aggravate my present sufferings by dwelling longer
on what will not bear reflection. All I can now do is to repent of
all my errors; and I trust that Divine Power will accept my
repentance who best knows its sincerity.</p>

<p>Before I resume the thread of my narrative, I will just venture
to give the reader a few lines, descriptive of a midshipman's life,
which will require, I trusty no apology, when I state that they
were the production of some of the junior members of our mess, and
composed in die space of a very few hours.&mdash;Of the correctness
of the picture therein drawn, I can truly say, <i>probatum

<p>After the first transports of our meeting had subsided, it was
mutually agreed that I should reside altogether with Miss
K&mdash;&mdash;e, who, being ignorant of my real circumstances,
imagined I was capable of maintaining her and myself, if not in the
most splendid, at least in a comfortable manner. I should have
stated, however, that the pleasure I felt at being once more free
from control, and on my near approach to my favourite spot, London,
added to the passion I had conceived for this young lady, had
completely banished every idea of returning to my ship, long before
I was set down at the obelisk in St. George's Fields, where I had
exchanged my chaise for a hackney coach, to prevent my being
traced.</p>

<p>The following morning I examined into the state of my personal
effects; which I found to consist of a dozen fine shirts, about the
same number of neck-cloths, hose, and waistcoats, a few odd
articles of other apparel, and twenty-one pounds in money, together
with an old family gold watch, and the suit of blue I had on my
back.</p>

<p>My fair acquaintance evinced some concern at the rash step I had
taken; which, imputing wholly to my affection for herself, drew
from her professions of gratitude and constancy, which I believe
(from her youth and ingenuous mind) to have been sincere. I
determined now to domesticate myself with this charming woman for a
few weeks; as well to make up for the privations I had suffered for
the last sixteen months, by enjoying every comfort money could
procure, as to preclude any risk of being apprehended for desertion
before the ship's departure.</p>

<p>During this retirement, which I might justly call a honeymoon,
from the happiness I experienced, I obtained from Miss
K&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;e some account of herself, and the
misfortunes which had reduced her to the disgraceful situation in
which I found her. The following are the particulars:&mdash;</p>

<p>She was the second daughter of a respectable tradesman in the
city, who had placed her, with her elder sister, at a boarding
school in Queen-square, where she had become perfectly
accomplished, About a year before our acquaintance began, she had
been accidentally seen walking in the garden of the square, to
which the young ladies had access, by an officer of dragoons, who,
being struck with her beauty, had employed every art of bribery and
intrigue, first to open a correspondence by letter, and afterwards
to obtain a personal interview, of which opportunity he made such
good use that he succeeded in seducing this amiable child, then
just fifteen years of age, to elope from her school, to sacrifice
to him, honour, fortune, and parental affection, and entail on
herself ruin, remorse, and endless shame!</p>

<p>This gallant hero treated her with the fondest attention, and
spared no expense to gratify her every wish, and, by a continual
round of splendid dissipation, to banish any reflections which
might otherwise obtrude themselves; and in this (owing to her youth
land the natural levity of her sex,) he so far succeeded that she
felt not, for the first six months, those compunctions which,
sooner or later, must attend conscious guilt. At the end of that
time, however, her protector, being ordered abroad with his
regiment, left her with a slender, provision in possession; but for
which he made up with most liberal promises of future bounty. It is
probable he had by this time gratified a passion which was at first
but of a sensual nature; and I am led to think his going abroad was
only a fiction, the better to cover his base design of deserting
her: be this as it mighty she had never since heard from him; and,
as her little money was soon exhausted, she found herself alone and
friendless, and now first began to reflect on the consequences of
her imprudence. She had, on quitting the school, assumed the name
of K&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;e, which I have recorded her by, in order
to avoid the inquiries of her family; to whom shame and (perhaps
false) delicacy, now deterred her from a thought of returning. In
the late scenes of her guilty prosperity she had formed an
acquaintance with several kept women who were living, like herself,
in elegant infamy. She now had recourse to some of these friends
for temporary assistance; but alas! they soon convinced her how
little is to be expected from such friendship, when adversity
renders it most essential.</p>

<p>In a fatal moment she took the usual course of persons similarly
situated; she procured a suitable lodging where her misfortunes,
were not known, and frequented the theatres and other public
places; at which (being a new face on the town), she was successful
above all her competitors in attracting the notice of the male sex.
The pecuniary emoluments she thence derived had enabled her to live
elegantly; and her person and carriage were so much above the
common class of Cyprians that she was still, at the time I first
saw her, an object of general admiration. Fortunately also her
health was yet untainted, so that, could I have found means for our
mutual support, this connexion promised to be a source of happiness
to us both. She felt happy at the opportunity of quitting a course
of life which had always disgusted her and little regret for the
past (being ignorant of the true state of my finances) save when a
melancholy thought of her disconsolate family caused a temporary
effusion of grief.</p>

<p>The first month or honey-moon of our connexion being expired,
and the Astraea long departed from the river, I began to revolve in
my mind the means of future subsistence. As I had spared no expense
to render our retirement pleasing, and had purchased for myself a
suit of plain clothes, I now found myself reduced to my last
guinea, and I knew that unless I hit upon some mode of speedily
recruiting, I must have recourse to the pawnbroker for another.
These unpleasing reflections gave me much uneasiness; but I
carefully concealed it from my partner, and preserved the same air
of cheerfulness as before. At length came "th' inevitable hour."
Money was wanting for household purposes, and I was obliged to
raise a few pounds, by depositing my watch in the usual place of
security. I accounted for the absence of this article by a pretence
that it wanted repair. This small supply lasted but a fortnight, as
we retrenched nothing of our mode of living; and I had lately
accompanied my dear Sarah to the theatres, and other places of
diversion, for which amusement she had as violent a passion as
myself. But I have now to relate an event, which no less afflicted
than surprised me, and of which I had not the most distant
apprehension.</p>

<p>One night, towards the close of the last mentioned period, we
had returned late from the opera, and, being in high spirits though
low in pocket, I proposed to send for a small collation from the
neighbouring tavern, and to indulge in a little extra festivity:
this was approved of by my charmer, who indeed had no will but
mine; and, our little maid having procured the necessary
requisites, we enjoyed a most comfortable supper; after which we
circulated the cheering glass, the wine receiving an additional
zest from the wit and enlivening conversation of my fair companion.
But mark the uncertainty of human happiness!</p>

<p>About two o'clock, as we were on the point of retiring to rest,
we were surprised by a sudden and loud knock at the street door,
which being unusual at so late an hour, caused a momentary alarm to
us both. Before we had time to form any idea of the cause, the door
of our apartment was burst rudely open, and three persons entered,
at the sight of whom, my unfortunate girl fainted in my arms, on
the sofa whereon we sat. One of the three persons, a respectable
looking elderly gentleman, from his tender anxiety, but mixed with
some degree of severity, I soon conjectured to be her unhappy
father; in which I was not mistaken. The other two immediately
called the landlady of the house, by whose assistance they
recovered the poor girl from her swoon; which having accomplished,
they instantly hurried her down stairs, the old gentleman darting
an angry look at me, and left me so stupified with grief and
surprise, that I had not power to follow, or notice their
proceedings. I soon afterwards heard a coach drive from the door,
on which the latter was immediately shut, and the landlady coming
up, informed me of what she had gathered during a short
conversation from the parties. It appeared that the young lady had
been seen with me the preceding night at the opera-house, by a
friend of her family, who knowing of her elopement, had officiously
followed US home, and then immediately given information to her
father, who applying instantly to Sir William Ford, the Bow-Street
magistrate, that gentleman had detached Messrs. Townshend and
Carpmeal (two of his principal officers) to assist him in the
recovery of his lost child. This they had effected as I have
described; the anxiety of her parent not suffering him to defer the
business even till the ensuing day. The woman added that on
learning from her, the life his daughter had led for some months
prior to her acquaintance with me, and that I was not her original
seducer, he had declined the idea of apprehending me, which the
officers were otherwise empowered to do.</p>

<p>This melancholy event was a grievous affliction to me, who had
relinquished an honourable situation, purely on her account; and
was now not only deprived of a beloved object, but reduced to a
state of utter poverty. Notwithstanding every inquiry I could
institute, I could never obtain any further information as to the
fate of Miss K&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;e , than what I extracted by a
bribe from one of the officers, who assured me that it was her
father's intention to send her to a remote part of the kingdom,
where she had a female relation who had undertaken the care of her:
but this man declared that the name of her parents was known only
to the magistrate, which was perhaps true: and the dear girl had
never even disclosed her real name to myself, but had almost
promised so to do on a little longer acquaintance.</p>

<p>I now quitted this lodging, the wearing apparel of my late
companion being claimed by the landlady for some arrears of rent,
as the father had refused to take any thing from the house, and
never approached it more, I engaged a small apartment for myself in
a more centrical situation; and, to supply my immediate wants,
deposited one article after another at the pawnbroker's, till I had
no longer any thing left to deposit.</p>

<p>It was necessary, however, before my appearance became too
shabby, to find some means of support. As to my friends, I had
given up every idea of returning to them, nor did I, for some
months after this, acquaint them of the rash step I had taken: and
when I afterwards did so, I amused my poor grandfather with a
fictitious account of my having returned to the law, and assured
him that I was doing well; for as I have before hinted, I was so
sensible of the inconvenience which that worthy man must
unavoidably suffer in his old age, from his too great liberality to
me, that I determined to submit to any hardships rather than be a
further incumbrance upon him.</p>

<p>I had, during my former residence in London, taken great delight
in billiards, and, by a frequent attendance at public tables, had
become a tolerably good player. I had renewed my acquaintance with
this game, since my last arrival in town; and, urged by necessity,
I now deemed it possible to pick up a little money at one of these
<i>boards of green cloth</i>. For this purpose I attended daily at
the rooms in Bow-Street, Covent Garden, where, by a few days play
with the marker, I gained a knowledge of the tables; and, as
nothing contributes like practice to improve one at this scientific
game, I was soon enabled to engage with such gentlemen as
accidentally dropped in for an hour's amusement, which I obligingly
afforded them at the expense of a few shillings.</p>

<p>These opportunities, however, only occurred in the early part of
the day; for in the evenings, the tables, as well as the spoil,
were engrossed by a combination of five or six sharpers, who
regularly attended for the same purpose as myself; but their
operations were upon a more extensive scale: by forming sham
matches among themselves, engaging by-standers to bet on either
side, and then playing booty, and by various other expedients, they
frequently obtained large sums, and were enabled to appear
genteelly about town. These gentry soon viewed me with a jealous
eye; regarding me, I suppose, as an interloper, who encroached upon
their rights of plunder. I therefore found it would be necessary to
have an understanding with their party, by which means I should
reap a much better harvest than I could do by a mere course of fair
play, in which I was sometimes unavoidably beat. I at length,
effected my object, by means of an elderly man, whose goodnatured
countenance encouraged me to introduce a conversation on the
subject. This person, who was a veteran in the arts of play, and of
some consequence in the gang, seemed flattered by the respectful
manner in which I addressed him, and, complimenting me on the
talents I possessed, assured me I should receive from himself every
advice requisite to render me useful; and that I might depend on
the most equitable treatment in the division of any money I might
be accessary to obtaining.</p>

<p>I was the same evening formally accepted as a member of this
sharping fraternity; and after a libation at the Piazzza
coffee-house, they repaired to the scene of action, where I soon
afterwards dropped in, as if by accident; and, having played a few
games with the marker, in which I betrayed great want of skill, I
was at length challenged by one of our party, who had been seen at
other times to play well. Of course, bets in plenty were offered
against me; and in the middle of the game, pretending to be
irritated at the general discouragement of the by-standers, I
affected to grow warm, and took odds of several gentlemen, that I
won the game (which was now six to four against me); my antagonist
also backed himself by laying the same odds with some of our
confederates, after which, no more bets being offered, he relaxed a
little in his play, I improved in proportion, and having, for
form's sake, suffered the game to arrive at twenty all, the flats
(or strangers) began to look foolish, and endeavoured to hedge off,
as the phrase is, but without effect. I therefore made a successful
hazard, and decided the game, to the great chagrin of those who had
so warmly opposed me. The person who played with me, declared I had
won by mere luck, and random play, and, throwing down his bets with
a passionate air, swore he would play me the following day for a
larger sum, and give me five points. This finesse prevented any
suspicion in the minds of the losers, whom it was our interest to
keep ignorant of the combination existing. The room soon after
getting thin, we departed one at a time, and meeting at the usual
place, apportioned the division of the evening's profit, which
amounted to about thirty pounds.</p>

<p>I continued to associate with this knot of gamblers for several
weeks; but I soon found that our success was very uncertain,
depending upon the number of strangers who happened to visit the
rooms; as those who had once been duped by us, were always cautious
in future, and would neither play nor bet with us. It was only,
therefore, from gentlemen who were not in the habit of frequenting
this house, that we had a chance of gaining any thing worth notice:
so that upon the whole, what I acquired was barely sufficient to
keep me above want. The summer too, having now commenced, at which
season there is but little company at the billiard rooms, the
confederates to whom I had attached myself, left town upon a tour
to the different races, some with an E O table, others trusting to
their general abilities at hazard playing, cocking, &amp;c. As I
had neither found the pleasure or profit which I derived from a
connexion with them to afford that satisfaction I expected, I was
not concerned at a separation from them. I therefore rubbed on as
well as I could by myself, spending my leisure time much in my
usual manner, but always taking care to preserve a genteel
appearance, on which I knew every success depended.</p>

<p>As I was one morning reading the papers at the coffee-house
where I commonly breakfasted, I met with an advertisement for a
clerk to an attorney in the country. As this was a situation I had
never held, and the season of the year was favourable to an
excursion, I determined to offer my services, promising myself, at
least, to derive some benefit to my health, and amusement from
changing the scene; but I had always a partiality for London, and
could never wholly reconcile myself to a country life, since I
first tasted of the various pleasures with which the metropolis
abounds.</p>

<p>I immediately applied to the advertising parties, Messrs. Dalton
and Edwards, in King's Bench Walk, Temple, and was introduced to
the latter gentleman, who informed me it was a Mr. Dalton of Bury
St. Edmunds, who wanted a clerk capable of conducting his business.
As I had acquired a greater share of experience, and a better
insight of the different branches of the profession, than many
others would do in a much longer course of service, I hesitated not
to undertake the duties required; and as expedition was necessary,
Mr. Edwards, after some few inquiries, engaged me immediately at a
weekly salary of one pound, which in so cheap a part of the
country, he observed, was equal to twice the sum in London. He
desired me if possible, to set out that very day, and writing a
short letter of introduction to Mr. Dalton, gave it me, together
with a small sum to bear my expenses to Bury. I then took my leave,
and having gained the street, I was curious to know in what terms
my credentials ran. The wafer being still wet, I opened the letter,
in which Mr. Edwards; had briefly stated the agreement he had made
with me, and concluded in these words: "I have every reason to
believe him an expert clerk, and do not doubt but he will prove an
acquisition." How far this good gentleman's prediction was
verified, the next Chapter will disclose. I lost no time in
preparing for my journey, and having bat few clothes to pack up, I
took my departure from the Blue Boar in Bishopsgate-street, at
seven o'clock, P. M., and the next morning arrived at St.
Edmundsbury.</p>

</p>

<p>I FOUND Mr. Dalton to be a gentleman of high respectability in
his profession, and of the most prepossessing manners. He gave me a
very kind and polite reception, and after some conversation,
conducted me himself to the best inn in the town, where he ordered
that I should be entertained at his expense, until I could provide
myself a convenient residence. Mr Dalton had a very handsome house,
and kept several servants, but, being a bachelor and a good deal
from home, it was not convenient for me to reside with him. The day
after my arrival, he, therefore, advised me to make inquiry for
board and lodging in some regular and decent family, and to consult
him on the eligibility before I made any engagement. I accordingly
began my inquiries, and at length found accommodation in the family
of a tradesman of whom Mr. Dalton approved. Here I was to be lodged
and boarded very comfortably at nine shillings per week! This
charge, to me, who had been accustomed to the expenses of London,
appeared moderate in the extreme: however, being willing to make
the best bargain I could, I informed the good woman, that as I
should receive my salary quarterly from Mr. Dalton, I could only
undertake to pay her at the like period, to which proposal she
therefore readily consented. My motive in this proceeding was, that
in case I quitted Bury before the end of the first quarter, I might
decamp without coming to a settlement, and by this means have my
weekly pay of twenty shillings entire for other purposes.</p>

<p>Having removed from the inn to my new abode, I was instructed by
Mr. Dalton in the nature of my employment, which was chiefly to
copy or engross deeds in conveyancing, and other similar documents,
peculiar to country practitioners. In a few days I had a correct
idea of what was necessary to be done, and Mr. Dalton perceiving I
required no instruction from him, gave me sole charge of the
office, which was detached from his house, and left it to my
discretion as to the hours or duration of my attendance. This
liberty I did not abuse, but kept every thing in such exact order
that I had soon the pleasure of giving him entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>Mr. Dalton kept a gig, and two blood-horses: as he had a good
deal of public business, relating to county matters, and was one of
the commissioners for the redemption of the land-tax, which
sometimes obliged him to attend meetings at the several
market-towns round about Bury, he often took me with him in his
gig, attended by his servant on horseback. On these occasions there
were usually public dinners at the principal inns, provided at the
expense of the county, or the persons interested. The fare was
always sumptuous, and there was no stint of the best wines. At
other times I was detached on horseback, accompanied by the servant
as a guide, to transact business with different clients, in various
parts of the county. I was not limited in my expenses, and the
account I presented on my return, was freely liquidated by Mr.
Dalton.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, this was one of the most agreeable employments I
ever engaged in, and had I prudently retained it for a few years,
there is no doubt but I should have met with the most liberal
encouragement from my employer. But my natural inconstancy still
prevailed; and I had been but a few weeks at Bury, before I grew
tired of the country, and thought of nothing but returning to
London, with such spoil as I could obtain from the credulity of the
tradesmen in the town. With this view, I bespoke clothes, boots,
linen, and other articles at various shops, informing the parties
that I should expect credit till the expiration of my quarter, to
which, on account of the respectable gentleman I served, they
readily consented. As soon as any of these goods were brought home,
I immediately packed them up in small portable parcels, which I
sent up to London by the coach, consigned to a pawn-broker with
whom I was on intimate terms; desiring him to receive and keep them
safe, until he saw me. I also coached off in the same clandestine
manner, such of my own apparel, &amp;c., as I had in my trunk, in
which, to prevent discovery, I deposited stones or bricks to
preserve its gravity. By these means I had nothing to impede my
sudden departure, when rendered necessary by the arrival of the
expected quarter-day.</p>

<p>I must here observe, to meet any surprise the reader might feel
on the subject, that as I had never at this time been connected
with downright thieves, so I had never yet committed an actual
theft, save the embezzlement of money at Liverpool; (which indeed
the law has lately made a felonious taking;) though I therefore
scrupled not at practising a fraud; I was not yet sufficiently
depraved to commit a robbery. This will account for my not robbing
the premises of Mr. Dalton, which at a subsequent period of my
life, would have been my primary object, as I had access to every
part of the house, and have frequently viewed with longing eyes,
the servant cleaning a handsome service of plate in the pantry.</p>

<p>I had now been about two months at Bury, and had no intention of
absconding till the expiration of the third; when an accidental
event induced me to hasten my departure. One afternoon Mr. Dalton
had written several letters in the office, and the footman being
elsewhere engaged, he requested me to drop them in the post-office,
in my way home. I accordingly brought them out in my hand, and
happening inadvertently to cast my eye on the superscriptions, I
perceived that one was addressed to Mr. Lyne, tailor, Cecil-street,
Strand, London. Being curious to know what correspondence Mr.
Dalton could have with a tailor, I opened this letter, and found
the contents to the following effect:</p>

<p class="letter">"Mr. Lyne,&mdash;By the waggon which goes from
hence on Monday next, and arrives at the Blue Boar in
Bishopsgate-street on Wednesday night, I shall send you a
portmanteau corded and sealed, but not locked, containing two
coats, sixteen waistcoats, fourteen pair of breeches, and a suit of
uniform of the city Light Horse[*]. Most of these articles are
nearly as good as new, but as they have now become unfashionable, I
desire you will dispose of them to the best advantage, on my
account, and send me down by the same conveyance, two suits made in
the present taste," &amp;c.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It appears from this that Mr, Dalton had
formerly resided in London, and been a member of that respectable
corps.</p>
]

<p>It immediately struck me, that if I took measures accordingly, I
might arrive in town time enough to intercept and obtain this trunk
from the inn; for which purpose I put this letter in my pocket, and
the others in the post-office. The next day, happening to go into
Mr. Dalton's kitchen, I there saw the portmanteau corded up, and
directed; and on questioning the servant in a careless manner about
it, he informed me that he was going to carry it to the
&mdash;&mdash; inn, the following evening, in readiness for the
departure of the waggon. The same afternoon it happened, (which was
a most fortunate circumstance for me,) that Mr. Dalton again begged
of me to put some letters in the post-office, which he had not done
above twice or thrice since I came into his service. Looking at
these letters, I saw to my surprise, another addressed to Mr. Lyne
as before, which, eagerly opening, I found was to mention something
Mr. Dalton said he had forgot in his letter of the preceding day. I
immediately destroyed this second letter, which (had it come to
hand) might have frustrated my design.</p>

<p>I now prepared matters for eloping, and sent off the remainder
of my effects by the coach as before: but my good fortune produced
another windfall of which I had no expectation. The day before my
intended departure, I was walking in the market-place with a young
man, who was clerk to another attorney in the town, and the
conversation turning upon watches, my companion observed that if I
wished to purchase one, he would introduce me to a maker of his
acquaintance, who would use me well on his account. I took him at
his word, and begged he would immediately do so. We were then
within a few doors of the shop, into which we entered; and I
perceived over the window in large characters, "Lumley and
<i>Gudgeon</i>, Watchmakers." I laughed inwardly at the singularity
of the latter name, which I considered ominous of my success in the
imposition I meant to put upon him.</p>

<p>After a short preliminary conversation, my acquaintance having
business to do, took his leave, and Mr. Gudgeon himself proceeded
to shew me several watches. I informed him that I wished to have a
good one, but my circumstances would not allow me to go to a high
price. Mr. Gudgeon assured me it was better to have a good one at
once, and recommended me a very handsome gilt watch, capped and
jewelled, and his own make, which he said he could warrant to
perform well, and for which he asked me eight guineas. I replied
that as my weekly salary from Mr. Dalton was but one pound, I could
not afford to give so much, and began to examine others of a
cheaper kind, but still letting him see that I had a strong
inclination for the one he had recommended. This induced him to
repeat his praises of the latter, and to press me with greater
energy, to fix upon it. I at length (with a shew of much
reluctance) suffered myself to be persuaded; but I begged leave to
observe, that as I was influenced in every thing by the advice of
my good master, Mr. Dalton, I would not venture to make so
expensive a purchase without his approbation; that if he would
therefore intrust me with the watch, I would consult Mr. Dalton and
give him (Mr. Gudgeon) a decisive answer the next morning: this he
declared himself willing to do, on which I took both the watch and
my leave together, and returned home.</p>

<p>The next morning I attended the office as usual, but of course
took no notice to Mr. Dalton of the affair in hand. During the
space of time I allotted myself for dinner, I again called on Mr.
Gudgeon, and told him that I should keep the watch, provided he
would receive the payment by instalments, as I could not afford to
pay the whole price at once. I therefore proposed to give him the
ensuing Saturday, one or two guineas, as I should find most
convenient, and to pay him half-a-guinea a week afterwards, until
the whole was liquidated. To this he readily agreed, and having
fitted a key to the watch, he begged, leave to shew me some chains
and seals. Of the former he had none but gilt ones: I selected one
of the neatest, and a handsome gold seal. I then desired to have a
bill of parcels of the whole observing that whenever I paid a sum
upon account, Mr. Gudgeon could make a memorandum of it at the
bottom by way of receipt. Having obtained this, I departed,
promising to be punctual in paying my first instalment on the day
appointed. This took place on Tuesday, the portmanteau being now on
its way to London; and the same evening I quitted my lodgings
privately, leaving nothing behind but a trunk, containing
brick-bats and stones, and walked by moonlight to a village four
miles distant, through which the stage-coach was to pass the next
morning at 7 o'clock. I procured some supper at a decent
public-house, and retired to rest, desiring to be called in time
for the coach. At the expected hour the stage made its appearance,
in which I seated myself, and about eight the same evening, arrived
at the Blue Boar, just two hours after the waggon, which I
perceived standing in the yard.</p>

<p>As soon as I descended from the coach, I walked into the
coach-office, and inquired of the book-keeper, if the Bury waggon
was arrived; he replying that it was, I told him that I expected a
trunk, and on my describing the direction, he looked over the
way-bill, and informed me there was such an article, but the waggon
would not be unladen till the next morning, when I might obtain it
by application. I now retired to the Cross Keys in
Gracechurch-street, where I procured a bed; the the next morning,
having breakfasted, I repaired to the Blue Boar, where I had the
pleasure of finding the waggon unloaded; and boldly entering the
office I inquire if I could have the trunk I had applied for the
night before. The clerk recollecting me, search for and found it
immediately; and placing it on the counter, demanded a trifling sum
for carriage. While I was joyfully opening my purse to pay this
demand, the book-keeper, seeming to recollect himself, after a
short apology, told me it was not customary with him to deliver
goods to a stranger, without he was shewn a letter or other
authority to warrant such delivery, as so many frauds had been
practised upon inn keepers of late.</p>

<p>I affected to be a little displeased at his suspicion, but
acknowledging the justice of such precautions, I assured him I had
received a letter of advice from Bury, but I doubted whether I had
it about me, then pulling out my pocket-book, hastily turned over a
number of papers, and pretending to be a little concerned at my
want of thought, informed the clerk that I had left the letter at
home, and must therefore suffer him to send the trunk to
Cecil-street, although it would occasion an expense for porterage
which I intended to have saved; then repeating my vexation, and
carelessly arranging the pocket-book, I luckily found the identical
letter, which I had (as I pretended) overlooked in my haste. I now
drew it forth in triumph, and obliquely hinting how incapable I was
of a fraudulent action was opening the letter to shew him the
contents; but this cautious person took me aback a second time, by
observing that it was unnecessary to peruse the letter, all that he
required was to see the post-mark!</p>

<p>This was a difficulty of which I had not the least idea, and was
therefore unprepared to meet it, and I have often since wondered
that my confusion did not betray me; but I had sufficient presence
of mind to answer with a smile, that I could account for the
absence of a post-mark, by informing him that I received this
letter enclosed in a frank or envelope, which I had destroyed. This
satisfied him, and having read a few lines of the letter, he
delivered the trunk, which I brought away from the inn, and having
called a coach was driven to Aldersgate-street, where I was set
down at the end of a narrow court or passage, leading to
West-Smithfield; through this court I proceeded on foot to prevent
my being traced, as no person could follow me without my perceiving
it. Being now out of danger I took another coach in Smithfield, and
was carried to my friend the pawnbroker's, to whom I had consigned
my effects from Bury; but on my way, I purchased a handsome large
trunk, capable of containing the whole of my property, including
the contents of Mr. Dalton's portmanteau. The latter (on arriving
at the pawnbroker's) I removed into my new trunk, and presented my
friend with the portmanteau; then arranging also the contents of my
various parcels, and paying him for the carriage, &amp;c., I left
my trunk in his care, until I had procured a lodging, which was the
next object I had in view.</p>

<p>I could not help applauding myself on the dexterity with which I
had accomplished this latter adventure, as well as on the general
success of my expedition to Suffolk, on which I had been absent
from London exactly nine weeks. And when it is considered that I
was then but just turned of seventeen years old, the reader must
allow that I displayed a genius and abilities which, had they been
devoted to more honourable purposes, would have done me no small
credit. But I am now writing my "Confessions," and shall therefore
not attempt to palliate my faults at the expense of my
veracity.</p>

Excursion.&mdash;Again obliged to seek Employment.&mdash;Engage

</p>

<p>I WENT immediately in quest of a lodging, and found one to my
mind in Roll's Buildings, Fetter-Lane; but as this was a
respectable house, the landlady required a reference to character,
before she would admit me as a lodger. I therefore gave her the
address of my friend and relation Mr. Presland, whom I formerly
served in Lincoln's Inn. That gentleman having satisfied her
inquiries, I removed my baggage from the pawnbroker's, and took
possession of my new apartment.</p>

<p>The next day I examined the contents of Mr. Dalton's
portmanteau, and found the whole of the articles to be as he had
described them, nearly new, and all excellent in their kind. As I
was not at this time acquainted with a <i>Fence</i>[*], to whom I
could dispose of this property, I had no other means of turning
them into money, than by pledging them at different pawnbrokers,
which I did, one or two at a time, for as much as I could get,
taking out with me every morning three or four articles in a
bundle, so that in a few days I had obtained money for the
whole.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Receiver of stolen goods.
(<i>Cant.</i>)]</p>

<p>I had now a good stock of clothes of my own, a handsome watch in
my pocket, and some pounds in money, exclusive of the daily
supplies I derived from pledging Mr. Dalton's apparel: I therefore
began to enjoy myself in the course of life in which I always found
the greatest satisfaction; breakfasting at a coffee-house, dining
at a tavern, and taking my tea in the neighbourhood of the
theatres, to one of which I went almost every night. In the
intervals of these occupations, I amused myself in walking about
town, or viewing public exhibitions, but chiefly in reading books
of entertainment and instruction, to the purchase of which,
especially periodical works, I every day devoted a small sum: so
that upon the whole, though. I obtained my money by dishonourable
means, yet the manner in which I spent my life was harmless to
myself; nor did I ever, in the most vicious part of my subsequent
career, give myself up to debauchery or intoxication, the idea of
which always disgusted me.</p>

<p>In this manner I lived happily for about five or six weeks, when
finding my ready money nearly exhausted, I judged it expedient to
look out for some employment which might contribute to my support.
I therefore made inquiry among the law offices, and was referred to
Mr. Preston, an eminent conveyancer in King's Bench Walk, who
engaged me as a transcribing clerk at a guinea a week. I attended
die office from ten till five daily, and spent my evenings in
rational recreation. I must here observe that the office of Mr.
Preston was within two doors of the chambers of Messrs. Dalton and
Edwards, the latter of whom had engaged me for the Bury expedition;
and it was certainly an act of impolicy in me to accept a situation
so immediately contiguous, after the manner in which I had behaved
to Mr. Dalton, as it was highly probable the latter would write to
Mr. Edwards, and desire him to use means for my apprehension.
However this never once struck me, or if it did, I thought it
possible that I might, in a place so constantly thronged with
passengers, go and come unobserved by him a thousand times. In
addition to this, I had never been seen by Mr. Edwards but in that
one interview, which lasted but half an hour; and I had assumed on
that occasion, the name of Smith, whereas I had now resumed my own.
But fate had decreed that I should suffer for my want of caution,
and thus it happened.</p>

<p>In going to and from the office of Mr. Preston, I passed
commonly four times a day by the chambers of Dalton and Edwards,
but the avenue in front of the latter being very extensive, I
always contrived to give them a wide-birth, as the sailors term it,
and their chambers being on the first floor, it was not likely that
I should be observed, who was so much below them, and surrounded by
numbers of persons continually passing. It happened, however, that
my way to and from the office, lay through a narrow passage called
Mitre Court, leading into Fleet Street. In this passage I
frequently encountered a young man having the appearance of a
lawyer's clerk, whose face I thought I was familiar with; and he,
on his part, always looked earnestly at me. As this was by no means
uncommon amongst young men similarly employed, I concluded he had
known me by sight, during my service, in a former office, and
therefore paid no attention to the circumstance.</p>

<p>One morning, about nine weeks after my return from Bury, I
entered the office at the usual hour, and I had scarcely taken my
seat at the desk, when Mr. Preston opening the door of His own
apartment, which was immediately adjoining that in which the clerks
wrote, desired me to step into his room, which I should not have
thought extraordinary, had not he at the same moment placed himself
between me and the outer door leading to the street, and made a
motion with his hand for me to walk in first: I had, therefore, no
alternative, but entered the room. Mr. Preston followed, and,
immediately shutting; the door, locked it after him; upon which I
turned my head, and saw, to my no small surprise and confusion, Mr.
Dalton himself from Bury St. Edmund's. That gentleman advanced
towards me, and began to reproach me in strong terms for my
misconduct; then seeing the chain of my watch hanging out, he
immediately drew it from my fob, saying that he should restore it
to the person whom I had defrauded of it. He next desired to know
what I had done with his trunk of clothes: at first I maintained a
sullen silence, and then denied any knowledge of his meaning: upon
which he assured me that he had strong proofs; that if I did not
restore them he would prosecute, and transport me at the least; but
that it was probable I should be hanged for forging a post-mark to
the letter; for that the book-keeper at the Blue Boar would swear
to my person, and that I had shewn him a post-mark which induced
him to deliver the portmanteau. I smiled at the latter part of this
threat, knowing the law too well to be intimidated by it; but upon
Mr. Dalton observing that he knew where I lodged, and doubted not
of finding traces of the property, on searching my apartment, I
gave myself up for lost, as I had imprudently preserved all the
duplicates of the articles pledged, which were now deposited in my
bureau. I, however, continued mute, and Mr. Dalton requested Mr.
Preston to send one of his clerks for a constable; on the arrival
of whom, he gave me in charge, and, accompanied by both gentlemen,
I walked to my lodgings, the young man I formerly mentioned (who
proved to be a clerk to Messrs. Dalton and Edwards, and who, as
well as Mr. Edwards, were also sent for by Mr. Preston,) leading
the way.</p>

<p>I afterwards ascertained that Mr. Dalton having, on my
elopement, come to a knowledge of the frauds I had practised on the
Bury tradesmen, and by some accident found out that his trunk had
not been received by Mr. Lyne, had written to Mr. Edwards an
account of the whole, and that his clerk having recollected my
person, had watched me home a few days before; and Mr. Dalton
having then been summoned to town, had arrived that very morning,
and proceeded to apprehend me.</p>

<p>Having entered my apartment, Mr. Dalton demanded my keys, which,
as I found it useless longer to dissimulate, I gave up, and my
drawers being searched, the unlucky duplicates were immediately
found, and in my trunk two or three articles of apparel, which I
had intended to have had altered for my own wear, and which Mr.
Dalton identified. I therefore confessed the truth, and that those
duplicates would lead to the recovery of all the property, except
the uniform, which I had sold to a Jew, (in the street I said, but
this was because I would not implicate the man, who kept a
respectable sale-shop near Covent-garden,) and the portmanteau
itself, which I told him I had destroyed. Mr. Dalton had now some
conversation with the constable apart, the result of which was,
that the latter was ordered to retain me in custody; and this
officer pretending to pity my youth, and to wish, if possible, that
the affair might be compromised without public disgrace, offered to
confine me in his own house, which was in Chancery-lane, till Mr.
Dalton had considered further on the subject. This having been
agreed to, I accompanied the constable to his house, where I had an
apartment assigned me, and was left (like Captain Macheath,) to my
private meditations: these, it may be conjectured, were not the
most agreeable, as this was the first time of my ever being "in
durance vile."</p>

<p>I heard no more of Mr. Dalton till the next morning, when I was
not a little surprised to see him accompanied by my friend Mr.
Presland. It seems that the former, prior to his apprehending me,
had an interview with my landlady in Roll's buildings, and had
learnt from her, that she had obtained a character of me from the
latter gentleman, on my taking her apartments. Mr. Dalton in
consequence, after consigning me to the constable's care, had
waited on Mr. Presland, and informed him of the disgraceful
situation in which I was then placed. The result of their interview
was the visit I am now going to describe. Mr. Presland, after
expressing his concern at the state in which he saw me, and his
anxious wish to save me from the disgrace of a public prosecution,
inquired if I could undertake to recover the whole of Mr. Dalton's
property, in case I was furnished with pecuniary means; on my
answering in the affirmative, (with the exceptions before
mentioned,) this truly generous friend told me that Mr. Dalton had
consented to forego a prosecution, provided he had his property
restored, and was reimbursed the expenses of his journey to London
and back again; and that, from motives of regard for the credit of
our family, he, Mr. Presland, had agreed to disburse a sum of money
adequate to the occasion, and would trust to the chance of being
repaid by my relations at some future period, when he had broke the
matter to them in as delicate a manner as possible.</p>

<p>He added, that he trusted my future conduct would never again
place me in so perilous and dishonourable a situation. I, of
course, expressed the most heartfelt gratitude for such an act of
unmerited generosity, and it was settled that the constable should
immediately attend me to the different pawnbrokers' at which the
articles were pledged, for the purpose of redeeming them. I was
accordingly supplied with money by Mr. Presland, and having
received the duplicates, we set out on our expedition. As I had
pledged the property in various parts of the town, and some of them
very remote, this task occupied three whole days, during which time
I dieted and lodged at the constable's house, my kind relation
having become responsible for every expense. The whole of the
articles pledged having been redeemed, were restored to Mr. Dalton,
and Mr. Presland indemnified that gentleman for those which were
irrecoverable. The aggregate of the expense incurred on this
occasion, including principal and interest to the pawnbrokers,
expenses to Mr. Dalton, and compensation to the constable for his
attendance, amounted to upwards of thirty pounds. Every thing being
finally settled, I was seriously admonished by Mr. Presland, who,
on my enlargement from custody, presented me with five guineas, and
made me promise that I would immediately set out for
S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;shire, and endeavour to obtain an appointment
in the country; being much afraid, he said, that if I continued in
town, my total ruin would be the inevitable consequence.</p>

<p><i>Obtain an Employment as Clerk and Shopman.&mdash;Rob my

Service, and am soon after taken in custody, and committed to the
Bastille</i>[*].</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The cant name for the House of Correction,
in Cold-bath-fields.]</p>

<p>NOTWITHSTANDING the promise I had given Mr. Presland, I could
not reconcile myself to the S&mdash;&mdash;shire journey; the shame
I felt at having quitted my honourable station in the navy, as well
as some other reasons, and perhaps, above all, the unavoidable
destiny which awaited me, concurred to prevent my taking the
salutary advice of my worthy and respected friend. Having,
therefore, privately changed my place of abode, I began to consider
how I should procure another employment in town, and for this
purpose I carefully examined the advertisements in the daily
papers, my intention being now to enter into a mercantile
clerkship, or to engage as assistant in a retail shop, hoping
thereby (with shame I confess it,) to have a better opportunity of
realizing money by fraud or robbery, than I could expect in the
restricted capacity of an attorney's clerk.</p>

<p>At length I met with an advertisement, stating that a young man
who had a general knowledge of business, was wanted in a retail
shop, but particularly requiring an undeniable character for
honesty, &amp;c. This latter clause seemed to promise some
difficulty, as I knew not where to give a reference, except among
the lawyers, and I was fearful that I should not be approved of, if
it was known that I had been chiefly employed in that profession.
However, as I knew myself to have a talent for business, and that I
should soon acquire an insight, let the branch be what it would, I
determined to have recourse to stratagem, to surmount the obstacle
of a recommendation.</p>

<p>I therefore obtained a reference to the advertiser Mr. Giffard,
who kept a large masquerade and habit warehouse in
Tavistock-street. This person, who was a grave elderly man,
inquired in what capacity, and with whom I had been last employed;
being prepared for this question, I answered that I had lived for
the last two years with Mr. Drake, a general shopkeeper in
High-street, Portsmouth; and that, in consequence of a family
misfortune, my late master had declined business, and retired upon
his means: that this was the only cause of my being out of
employment, and that Mr. Drake had promised to answer any gentleman
who might refer to him as to my abilities and moral character. I
added, that having formerly lived in London with my parents, I had
still a sufficient knowledge of the town, to render myself useful
to my employer. After a few more questions, which I answered with
becoming modesty and propriety, Mr. Giffard told me he liked my
appearance well, that he would write that evening to Mr. Drake, and
ordered that I should call again in two days' time, when, if he
approved of the answer he received, he would immediately engage
me.</p>

<p>Having proceded thus far before the wind, I had now to take
measures for bringing my plot to a happy conclusion. My next object
was to obtain possession of Mr. Giffard's letter, in order that I
might answer it myself, Mr. Drake being a person who existed only
in my inventive brain: this I accomplished in the following manner.
I found out the guard of the Portsmouth mail-coach, who was to quit
London that evening, and return to town the next day but one. I
obtained the ear of this man, by inviting him to partake of some
brandy and water, and then introduced my business by acquainting
him that my name was Drake, that I had lately resided in
Portsmouth, and that I had reason to suppose there was one or more
letters lying at the post-office in that town for me, as I knew no
such person was now to be found in High-street; I therefore
requested that he would, on his arrival, make inquiry for such
letters, and bring any he might find safe to me on his return,
promising a gratification for his trouble: this commission he
readily undertook, and we then separated.</p>

<p>On the day appointed, I met my trusty agent who delivered me the
expected letter, for which I amply rewarded him. On perusing this
epistle, it was such as might be expected on the like occasion, Mr.
Giffard concluding his inquiries with wishing to know, if the
applicant John Smith (which name I had now assumed,) was in every
respect fit to be received into a respectable house. I had now half
accomplished the business, and it only remained, to return a
suitable answer through the regular channel; but to save
appearances, and gain time, I waited immediately on Mr. Giffard
desiring to know if he had received a reply from Mr. Drake. On his
answering in the negative, I expressed much surprise, but accounted
for it, by informing him that Mr. Drake was probably absent from
home, on a visit to some relations a few miles distant, and that on
his return, he would not fail to transmit an answer. Having thus
satisfied Mr. Giffard, I departed, promising to wait on him every
day until the expected letter arrived.</p>

<p>I now applied myself to frame an answer, which I at length
completed to my satisfaction, having disguised my hand-writing as
much as possible. In this letter, I made Mr. Drake apologize for
his delay, by stating that he was from home when Mr. Giffard's
favour arrived, and had taken up his pen the moment it came to
hand, to answer his inquiries; that he felt happy at hearing the
young man was likely to obtain so respectable a situation, and it
gave him the highest gratification to bear testimony to his
exemplary conduct on all occasions, while he had been in his
service; that his abilities were such as could not fail to render
him an acquisition, and that he should not himself have parted with
him on any account, had he not, for private reasons, declined
business. Finally, Mr. Drake declared himself glad that I had so
soon met with a situation, as London was a bad place for a young
person to be long out of employment, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Having finished this epistle, and directed it in due form, I
hastened to find out the driver of the mail-coach, as I did not
choose to employ the guard on the occasion. I requested the
coachman to take this letter to Portsmouth, and on his arrival to
drop it in the post-office, giving some fictitious reason, which
fully satisfied him, when backed by a small compliment in
silver.</p>

<p>I continued to call every morning on Mr. Giffard, and expressed
such well-feigned sorrow at Mr. Drake's delay, that I really
believe the former would in a few days more have taken me without
the required testimonials. However, the long expected answer at
length arrived; and on my calling as usual, Mr. Giffard told me
with great marks of pleasure, that he had just received a letter
from Mr. Drake, who gave me so excellent a character, that I might
come that very day if I was prepared. Mr. Giffard further informed
me that he was on the point himself of leaving the business to the
management of his two partners, (Fisher and Pettit) and should
retire to a country-house he possessed at Hammersmith: that as one
of these partners only resided in the house, and he was a bachelor,
it would be necessary that I should board myself, for which expense
I should be allowed fifteen shillings a week, and for my services
twelve more. Though this allowance was comparatively trifling, I
agreed to the terms, as my only intention was to purloin all I
could lay my Hands on, and in two or three months to abscond, and
change the scene of action. As to my duty, it was to attend the
shop, to make out bills of parcels, keep a set of books, and
occasionally to carry out light packages.</p>

<p>I immediately brought my trunk of clothes, &amp;c., to the
house, and had a small bureau bedstead assigned me in a little room
behind the shop; in which room during the day, a number of young
women were employed in making up fancy-habits, character-dresses,
dominos, &amp;c. In a few days Mr. Giffard, with his family, left
the house, and there only remained Mr. Pettit, the junior partner,
myself, and a woman servant. The second partner (Fisher,) was a
tailor, who superintended thirty or forty men, constantly employed
in a large workshop on the attic story, in making gentlemen's
clothes, and ladies' riding-habits. The stair-case to the upper
apartments communicated with the shop, and had a door at the
bottom, which when Mr. Pettit and the servant were gone to bed, I
could fasten with a bolt so as to leave me at liberty to range the
shop, and examine every part of its contents. Of this opportunity I
soon availed myself, and the keys of the various drawers, &amp;c.,
being left below, I proceeded to reconnoitre the different articles
they contained.</p>

<p>I found these to consist of black and white lace, of various
breadths and descriptions; ribands, silk, and other haberdashery; a
large quantify of mode, Persians, gauze, muslin, <i>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</i> There were also masks and dominos of every kind for the
purpose of hire on masquerade nights, but these articles were of no
value to me. As to the cloths, and other materials for gentlemen's
clothes, these were always sent for, together with the requisite
trimmings, from various shops in the neighbourhood, at which
tailors are supplied with such goods, as they have need of them;
and it frequently fell to my lot to fetch these articles, on which
occasion I had only to take the pattern-books, and point out the
quantities of each kind wanted, when (after it was known that I
lived with Giffard and Co.) the same was immediately measured,
booked, and given to me.</p>

<p>Having found out a Jew salesman resident in the Neighbourhood,
who agreed to purchase whatever goods I brought to him, I began my
depredations by taking a piece of elegant black mode, and several
cards of lace, which articles I concealed in my bedstead, until I
went out to breakfast the ensuing morning, when (this being the
winter season,) I buttoned them up under my great-coat so as not to
be perceived. On going to the Jew receiver, this conscientious
Israelite, who no doubt suspected how I had obtained these
articles, and my ignorance of their real value, offered me a guinea
for each card of lace, (containing above twenty yards,) which was
probably about the selling price of a single yard; and an equally
equitable price for the mode; protesting "as he was an honest man,
<i>and hoped for salvation</i>," that he could not afford sixpence
more. As I had no alternative, I was obliged to accept the
proffered sum, and promised to let him have more goods of the same
kind, at every opportunity. I continued this course of pillage for
several weeks, taking care, however, not to meddle too freely with
any one species of property, so as to cause a discovery. As to
money, I had not the means of getting any, for there was very
little retail trade in this shop; and that little was confined to a
few persons of fashion, who came in their carriages, and were
always waited on by Mr. Pettit; besides this class of persons
seldom pay ready money for the articles they select, but have them
booked. The various goods I have mentioned, were chiefly kept for
the purpose of making up, and ornamenting the masquerade and
fancy-dresses, which were from time to time bespoke for
extraordinary occasions.</p>

<p>I was frequently sent home with a suit of clothes, a
lady's-habit, and other articles, to the houses of regular
customers; most of whom kept an accompt, which was settled once a
year: but on many occasions I was desired by the parties to give a
receipt and take the amount of the goods delivered. After being
about two months with Messrs. Griffard and Co., I began to form the
design of quitting their service, and from that moment I suppressed
all such sums as I received, booking the articles on my return, for
the satisfaction of Mr. Pettit, who conducted this department. I
now bespoke a very large chest of a neighbouring carpenter, for the
purpose of depositing my own clothes and other effects, which I
knew must be removed by degrees from the house; and that whenever I
absconded, I must leave my trunk behind me. I therefore had
recourse to the old stratagem of substituting brickbats for the
articles I took away, to prevent any suspicion from its lightness.
When my chest was completed, I ordered it to be sent home to a
lodging I had provided in a distant part of the town, of which I
had obtained the key, and paid rent in advance. I removed my
effects at every opportunity from Tavistock-street, to this new
receptacle. Every thing being in readiness for an elopement, I
prepared to execute my last design upon my present employers. I
have before observed that I kept a set of books, in which were the
accounts of many persons of fashion for clothes, &amp;c. My
intention was to transcribe from the ledger a number of these
accounts upon the copper-plate bills of parcels, which I had in my
desk, belonging to the firm, and to present these bills for
payment, immediately after I quitted the house; not doubting but
many of the parties would pay them on the first application, by
which I hoped to realize a good round sum. But circumstances not
favouring this part of my design, I had only an opportunity of
transcribing five or six persons' bills before Saturday night, at
which period the books were delivered up to Mr. Pettit, who
uniformly retained them until Monday morning; and, as I had reason
to fear my repeated depredations on the shop would soon excite
suspicion, I had pre-determined to quit on the day last
mentioned.</p>

<p>The last commission I received on the Saturday was to take a
parcel, containing a riding-habit, to the Bell and Crown inn,
Holborn, where I was to see it booked for the Clapham stage, at
which place the lady resided, for whom it was made. As I was going
along, it occurred to me that I might as well embezzle this
article, the price of which to the lady was 5<i>l</i>. 15<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. Instead, therefore, of going to the Bell and Crown, I
took it to my old acquaintance the Jew, who, I expected, would give
me at least two guineas for it; but he had the conscience, to offer
me one pound which I considered so unfair a price that I refused to
let him have it, and, leaving his shop, I proceeded to a
pawn-broker's a few doors further, where I requited two guineas
upon it; but the shopman assured me these articles were so liable
to the caprice of the fashion, that it might scarce be saleable at
all in a years time, except to convert to some other use; he
therefore offered to lend me thirty shillings, which I accepted, to
save further trouble. This was the most impudent act I could have
been guilty of, as this pawnbroker's was in Drury-lane, and within
a minute's walk of my employer's; and I had better have taken ten
shillings from the Jew, where it would have been placed beyond the
reach of discovery, than have pledged it for five times the sum.
The consequence of this imprudence will be seen by-and-by.</p>

<p>On my return to Tavistock-street, I informed Mr. Pettit that I
had seen the parcel safely booked. The same night after he had
retired to bed, I selected a few of the most eligible articles in
the shop as my farewell adventure, which I concealed in my bed till
the next morning, Sunday, when I conveyed them to the usual place
of disposal.</p>

<p>Monday being come, I attended in the shop till the hour of
breakfast, when I went out as usual, but with no intention of
returning. I had previously procured several patterns of fancy
quilting for waistcoats, and of the most fashionable articles for
breeches; with these I immediately went to the houses, at which we
were usually furnished with such goods, and shewing my patterns,
(my person being well known,) I was immediately supplied with what
I asked for, and the articles booked to Messrs. Giffard and Co. I
proceeded in like manner to a woollen-draper's, where I obtained a
few yards of superfine cloth; and afterwards to a trimming and
button warehouse, at which I procured suitable materials for making
up the whole as I intended these articles for my own wear. All this
was executed within the hour I usually allotted for breakfast.</p>

<p>I next visited my lodging, and, depositing my newly-acquired
property in my chest, informed the landlady I should come to sleep
in the apartment that night. Having taken some breakfast, I
hastened to present my bills at the West end of the town and was so
fortunate as to receive about twenty pounds, besides an order at
another house to call again the next day, which, as I had no
immediate danger to apprehend, I, in fact, did, and received a few
pounds more. For the whole of these sums, I gave receipts on
account of Messrs. Giffard and Co.</p>

<p>Thus ended my engagement with Mr. Giffard, after a duration of
about ten weeks. I was now possessed of a pretty good stock of
clothes, and about sixty pounds in money. I had lived well during
the whole period of my service; and I now determined to enjoy every
amusement die town afforded, as I had lately been debarred from
attending the theatres, &amp;c., on account of my being restricted
to early hours.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after my quitting Tavistock-street, I called
at the pawnbroker's, at which I had pledged the riding-habit, for
the purpose of buying some fancy silk-handkerchiefs, of which they
had a very extensive assortment, being unredeemed pledges. On
entering the shop, I found it very full of people, (this being
Saturday evening,) and the shopman desired I would wait a short
time, and he would then attend to me. In a few minutes I heard the
latter desire an apprentice to take a bag and go to a neighbouring
liquor-shop, for the purpose of procuring ten pounds worth of
silver. I thought I perceived something significant in the
shopman's manner of giving these directions, but as nothing is more
common than such a proceeding on a Saturday night, when the
pawn-brokers have need of a great deal of change, I had no
apprehension of any deceit. When I began to grow impatient, the
young man at length sent a boy up stairs to bring down the
handkerchiefs, for my inspection; finding, however, that he was in
no hurry to descend with them, and conceiving at last, that I was
only kept in suspense for some sinister purpose, I declared that I
would wait no longer, but call again another time. Turning about to
leave the shop, who should I encounter at the door, to my great
confusion, but my late master, Mr. Pettit, accompanied by a
Bow-street officer, and the boy who had pretended to go out for the
silver. I attempted to rush by them, but was overpowered and
secured. The officer immediately proceeded to search me, but found
nothing of a suspicious nature: he took, however, some loose money,
and every other article I had about me; luckily I had some money
(the bulk of my fortune,) in a private pocket, which he did not
discover. Mr. Pettit then asked the pawnbroker if I was the person
who had pledged the habit, and on his answering in the affirmative,
I was given in charge to the officer, who conducted me to
Covent-garden watch-house, where I was to remain locked up until
the magistrate sat in the evening, at the public-office,
Bow-Street.</p>

<p>Shortly after my confinement, I received a visit from Mr.
Pettit, who, after expatiating on the enormity of my conduct, told
me he had detected the frauds I had practised at the neighbouring
shops, and demanded what I had done with the property so obtained.
This, however, I refused to tell, not supposing that he had any
idea of my place of abode: but in this I found myself unhappily
mistaken, for he informed me that he had discovered it by means of
the porter employed to carry home my chest, who, it seems, was well
acquainted with Mr. Pettit, and had seen me frequently in his shop.
On receiving this unwelcome information, I told Mr. Pettit to take
what steps he pleased; and refused to answer any interrogatories,
which I knew would avail me nothing, without a full restitution,
which I was unable to make.</p>

<p>About six o'clock I was taken before the sitting magistrate, and
Mr. Pettit, being duly sworn, related the whole story of the
riding-habit, and stated that a few days after my elopement, he was
surprised at receiving a message from the lady, respecting the
delay in sending it home; and having inquired at the office of the
inn, he was assured that no such parcel had been booked or brought
there; that having reason, from my sudden disappearance, to suspect
my honesty, he had made inquiry at the surrounding pawnbrokers, and
had found the habit pledged at the shop of Mr. Lane, in Drury-lane,
who, on his application, had immediately restored it. The shopman
of Mr. Lane deposed, that he had taken in the article of me, and
the magistrate observed that the evidence was so clear, that
nothing now remained but for Mr. Pettit to produce and identify the
property. The latter replied that he had it not in his possession,
having sent it home to the lady, who was urgent to receive it. At
this the magistrate expressed great displeasure, informing the
prosecutor that all he had said was to no purpose, without the
property being produced, and that he was therefore not warranted in
committing me. Then turning to me, he said,</p>

<p>"Young man, you have had a very narrow escape; I hope this will
be a warning to you in future. Officer, let the prisoner be
discharged."</p>

<p>My joy at this deliverance was but momentary, for before I could
reach the door of the office, Mr. Pettit acquainted the magistrate,
that he had several other charges of fraud against me, but the
parties were not then in attendance; upon which his worship ordered
me to be detained, and directing that the witnesses should attend
on that day week, ordered my mittimus to be made out, and committed
me to the house of correction for another examination.</p>

</p>

<p>On entering the gates of the gloomy receptacle to which I was
now consigned, and which on many accounts has not been unaptly
named the Bastille, the sensations I felt may be more easily
conceived than described. Besides that this was the first prison I
had ever entered, every thing around me had an air of unspeakable
horror. After being viewed and reviewed by the surly Cerberuses of
this earthly hell, I was conducted up some stairs to a long
gallery, or passage, six feet wide, having on either side a number
of dismal cells, each about six feet by nine, formed entirely of
stone, but having a small grated window near the roof, at the
further end, which admitted a gloomy light, and overlooked a yard,
in which other prisoners were confined; there was also a similar
grate over the door; but, owing to their height, both these
apertures were very difficult of access. The cells on the other
side the passage, were exactly similar, but overlooking another
yard, and the doors were immediately opposite each other. The only
furniture of these dreary apartments was an iron bedstead, on which
were a bed, blanket, and rug, but all of the coarsest kind.</p>

<p>I afterwards found, that by paying an extravagant price, I might
have had better accommodation; but as I had then only a few days to
stop, and I found no want of cleanliness in my present lodging, I
declined the favour. My conductor having given me a pitcher of
water, without vouchsafing a word, locked the door, and left me in
utter darkness. I retired to my homely couch, and having well
refreshed myself before I left the Brown Bear[*], I soon forgot my
misfortunes in the arms of Morpheus, and did not awake till I was
roused by the turnkey, at a late, hour in the morning. This
personage now behaved with some little civility, and let me know
that if I had any money I might be supplied with a good breakfast;
at the same time tossing upon my bed a small loaf (about fourteen
ounces,) of bread, which he told me was the daily allowance of the
prison. I gladly accepted his offer, and desired to have some tea,
which was presently sent up to me; and I continued to have three
tolerable good meals, (at least in quantity,) every day during my
stay here; but I paid for each on delivery, and through the
nose.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A public-house near the police-office, where
prisoners are confined until their removal to prison by the
officers, who seldom hurry a <i>gentleman, if he behaves like
one</i>, as their phrase is.]</p>

<p>In order to amuse my mind during this solitary week, I climbed
up to the grated aperture over the door of my cell, and listened to
the conversation of the neighbouring prisoners, who were also
confined for re-examination; and from their discourse I acquired a
more extensive knowledge of the various modes of fraud and robbery,
which I now found were reduced to a regular system, than I should
have done in seven years, had I continued at large, I was indeed
astonished at what I heard, and I clearly perceived that instead of
expressing contrition for their offence, their only consideration
was how to proceed with more safety, but increased vigour, in their
future depredations. And here I was struck with the fallacious
notions entertained by the projectors of this prison, which was
reputed to be upon the plan of the benevolent and immortal Howard,
who had recommended the confinement of offenders in separate cells;
in order to prevent the effects of evil communication among persons
who had not all attained an equal degree of depravity. This object,
however, was not effected here, for being within hearing of each
other, they could, by sitting up over the door as I have described,
converse each with his opposite neighbour, and even form a line of
communication, where the discourse became general, from one end of
the gallery to the other. As a proof of what I have advanced, I
knew several of the prisoners then confined with me in this
passage, who were at that time but striplings, and novices in
villany, and who after several years' continuance in their evil
courses, at length became notorious offenders, and having narrowly
escaped a shameful death, are now prisoners for life in this
colony.</p>

<p>On the morning of the appointed day, I was again taken to
Bow-Street, where I found in attendance Mr. Pettit, and the three
shop-keepers from whom I had obtained the goods. I also saw to my
mortification, that they had searched my lodging, and had actually
the various articles so obtained in their custody, ready to
produce. The first person who came forward, was the
woollen-draper's shopman, who, producing some yards of cloth and
kerseymere, deposed that I had implied for such articles' in the
name of Messrs. Gifiard and Co., and that having frequently served
me with the like goods, he delivered them to me without hesitation.
Mr. Pettit then denying that I had been deputed by him, or his
partner, and the property being sworn to, the magistrate observed
that here was sufficient matter to convict me, and it was therefore
unnecessary to bind over the other tradesmen, who were ordered to
retain their goods. Having nothing to offer in my defence, his
worship ordered the clerk to commit me for trial, on which I
earnestly begged the magistrate to send me to some other prison,
where my friends might have access to me, (this being denied at the
Bastille à la mode de Paris,) and in compliance with my request, I
was ordered to New Prison, Clerkenwell; at which I was much
rejoiced.</p>

<p>On arriving at this prison, of the rules of which I had acquired
some idea, from the information of my late fellow prisoners, who
had indeed advised me to petition as I did, I desired to have the
best accommodation I could, and was therefore called upon, to pay
fees, garnish, &amp;c., together with, two shillings for a bed the
first night, but after that, one shilling only. Having complied
with every demand, I was introduced to a little room adjoining the
turnkey's lodge, where I found several persons, in my own
predicament, and some others who were confined for certain periods.
We spent the day together in this part of the prison having also
free access to the lodge, in which we walked for air, and at night
were locked up in different rooms above stairs, each containing two
or three tolerable beds; so that having society both night and day,
I felt less melancholy than I had done in the house of correction.
My first care was to send for a young man, who, being reputed
honest by the world, I thought I could intrust to arrange matters
at my lodgings, and take care of the effects I left in my
apartment. I requested him to pay the rent due, and remove my chest
to his own residence, supplying me occasionally with such articles
as I might need. On his return, he informed me that he had done
every thing for the best; but, from his report, I found that twenty
guineas in money, and many of my best clothes, had taken flight.
This he attributed to the officers, who, he said, had paid several
visits to the chest, on pretence of searching by authority. As I
knew how fruitless any complaint would be, I was obliged to submit
to these losses, and thought myself very fortunate in having thirty
pounds about me on my apprehension, which escaped the fangs of the
officer who searched me.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of April when I was taken up, and this
being what is termed long vacation, I had nearly seven weeks to lie
in jail, before the sessions came on. This time I passed in the
most agreeable manner I could, reading sometimes books and
newspapers, at others, smoking, drinking, and conversing with my
fellow-prisoners; having all plenty of money, we formed a pretty
respectable mess, and lived on the most sociable terms. Our society
was increased by several new chums before the sessions, and as
these persons were some degrees above the common class of thieves,
I found much satisfaction in their conversation. There were indeed
among them some of the first characters upon the town, leading men
in the various branches of prigging[*] they professed; both
toby-gills[**], buz-gloaks[***]; cracksmen[****], &amp;c., but from
their good address and respectable appearance, nobody would suspect
their real vocation. As for the unfortunate prisoners, who had no
money to pay for indulgence, they were confined in a large yard,
called the common side, where they were indeed exposed to "variety
of wretchedness." The part I inhabited was termed "between gates,"
being that space which is between the outer-gate of the prison, and
the gate leading to the common-side.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Thieving.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Pickpockets.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Housebreakers.]</p>

<p>My knowledge of life, as it is termed by the knavish part of
mankind, and my acquaintance with family people[*], every day
increased; but, as all who heard my case concurred with myself in
opinion that I had no chance of escaping conviction, I did not form
any intimacy, or devise, any plans beyond the present moment,
concluding that I should, at least, be confined for two years, if
not transported for seven.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Persons living by fraud and
depredation.]</p>

<p>A week before, the Old Bailey sessions, the prisoners were as
usual removed to Newgate; but to my surprise, I was not included in
their number; and I found that my offence being considered a
misdemeanour, I was to be tried at the Quarter sessions held at
Hicks's-hall. For the reason before-mentioned, I had been advised
not to employ a counsel, which indeed I conceived, would be only
money thrown away, as the case was too clear against me. I
therefore patiently awaited the issue, and the day of trial being
come, I was taken, with many other prisoners of both sexes, from
the prison to the sessions-house on Clerkenwell-street, at which
Mr, Mainwaring, the member for Middlesex, has for many years,
presided as chairman.</p>

<p>Being put to the bar, I stood indicted for knowingly and
designedly, and by false pretences, obtaining from Joseph
Addington, five yards of superfine blue cloth, and three yards of
black kerseymere, &amp;c. Having pleaded "Not guilty," the first
witness called, was Henry York, shopman to the prosecutor, who
deposed, that on the 7th of April, I came to his master's shop, and
said I wanted the articles mentioned in the indictment; and that
he, the witness, knowing me well by sight, as the servant of
Messrs. Giffard and Co., and taking for granted that I was still in
their service, immediately cut off, and delivered the same to me.
Here the chairman preyed the witness repeatedly, to state the exact
words that I used; but the man was so evidently embarrassed, (I
suppose from his never being before in a court of justice,) that
nothing more could be extracted from him; he would persist in
speaking only in the third person, "He said he wanted, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Indeed, to the best of my recollection, he had sworn exactly the
truth; but the reader will soon see the chairman's motive for
wishing his evidence to be more pointed. I now felt my hopes
revive, and Mr. Pettit being sworn to depose that he had not
empowered me to demand the said goods, which were now produced and
identified, I was put upon my defence, upon which I addressed the
court to the following effect:</p>

<p>"May it please your worship, and gentlemen of the jury, I am
here indicted for obtaining goods under false pretences. From the
evidence of the witness York, you hear of no pretences whatever
which I used; he merely swears that I said I wanted such and such
articles, and that he delivered them to me without scruple.
However, I may have been morally culpable, I hope, gentlemen, you
will only be guided in your verdict by the evidence before you, and
I humbly submit that the charge against me has not been formally
substantiated. Gentlemen, I leave my case in your hands, and the
question of law to the learned chairman, who, I am persuaded, will
impartially decide thereon."</p>

<p>The chairman now addressing the jury, spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I am sorry, for the ends of public justice, that
there is but too much reason in what the prisoner has advanced; but
he is a very young man, and I sincerely hope that if he this day
escapes the correction of the law, he will never again transgress
in a similar way. Gentlemen, the prisoner is charged in the
indictment with falsely obtaining these goods in the names of
William Giffard, Christopher Fisher, and James Orrell Pettit. Now
in the evidence of York, the shopman, we hear not a syllable of
such pretence, or of the prisoner using either of those names,
consequently, the case is not made out, and you must acquit the
prisoner."</p>

<p>This they immediately did, and after an admonition from the
chairman, I was discharged, having first applied for the money,
&amp;c., taken from me on my apprehension, which the court ordered
to be restored. Mr. Pettit seemed much chagrined at my escape, and
I was in some fear that he would endeavour to have me detained; but
it is probable that he thought it not worth his while, as he could
not hope to obtain any restitution from me; however, he suffered me
to depart in peace, to my great joy. I have reason to believe, that
he had not discovered the full extent of my depredations on his
property at this time, and that he had not yet come to a knowledge
of the money I received in payment of bills at the West end of the
town.</p>

<p>On regaining my liberty, my first step was to go in quest of the
person to whose care I had consigned my effects; and who, on
pretence of much business, had abstained for a fortnight past, from
visiting me in the prison. Inquiring at his usual place of abode, I
found that he had quitted his lodging a few days after, the period
of my apprehension, and the people of the house knew not where he
was gone. I then called at the printing-office in which he was
employed when I first knew him, and there learnt that he had
suddenly absented himself, and was reported to have engaged with
some person of that profession in the country. Every inquiry I
could make was equally fruitless, and I had the mortification to
find that this supposed friend had treacherously converted all my
little property to his own use, without regard to the helpless
situation in which he left me. I had no longer any doubts about the
fate of my twenty guineas, and articles of apparel, which he had
persuaded me the officers must have purloined.</p>

<p>My situation was now deplorable enough; I possessed only the
clothes on my back, and about five pounds in money, the expenses of
living, &amp;c., during my confinement, having consumed the rest of
my stock. However, I had regained my freedom, which I little
expected, and I consoled myself with the reflection that I might
have been still worse off than I really was. I engaged a cheap but
decent lodging, and furnished myself with such necessaries as were
indispensable for my present comfort, and external appearance; and
I next began to muse upon the course now to be adopted for my
future subsistence.</p>

<p>A few days after my acquittal, I was accosted one afternoon, at
Fleet-street, by a young man, whose face I had some faint
recollection of; while I was considering where I had seen him, he
anticipated me, by asking if I did not remember him in New-prison,
where he was confined on the common side, and had frequently
conversed with me through the gate of the lodge, at which I
sometimes amused myself with viewing the proceedings in the yard
below me. This young man was then only confined till the sessions
on a charge of assault, but, being poor in circumstances, was
unable to pay the expenses of admission "between gates." I
immediately recognised him, and he gave me joy on my deliverance.
He was now very well attired, and invited me to drink a glass; to
which, as I had always found much pleasure in his conversation, I
willingly consented, and accompanied him to a house, called the
White Swan, near Temple-bar. Here my inviter seemed quite at home;
he introduced me to a neat little parlour, in which were a number
of persons smoking their pipes, and drinking wine, punch, &amp;c. I
observed that my conductor, whom I shall in future call Bromley,
appeared to know and be known by them all, and that they regarded
me with an inquiring eye.</p>

<p>Having taken our seats in a vacant part of the room, our
conversation was at first upon general topics; at length Bromley
inquired in a friendly manner, how I employed myself, and on my
answering candidly, that I really was destitute of employment, and
almost of money, he observed that I was to blame if I wanted money
while any body else had any; that for his part he never would; and
that if I would take a walk with him, I should be welcome; he added
that he had that day turned out three readers[*], but without
finding a shilling in either of them; however, said he, we cannot
expect to be always equally lucky. I confess I was ashamed to own
that I had never practised thieving, for (thanks to my late seven
weeks' education,) I understood his meaning well. I therefore told
him that I had not been accustomed to buzzing, and should be unable
to do my part. On this, Bromley replied that we should have at
least one other person with us, and that he himself would work,
while he only required me and the third man to cover[**] him.
Having thus answered my objection, as I had no scruples of
conscience to overcome, I agreed to accompany him. Shortly
afterwards a genteel looking man, advancing to our table, from
among the other company, asked Bromley if he was inclined for a
walk; at the same time looking significantly first at me, then at
my companion. The latter answered, "Yes, sir, with all my heart;
this gentleman is a friend of mine, he'll take a turn with us: it's
all right: he's one of us."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Pocket-books.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* To stand or walk in such a situation, close
to the person robbed, as to prevent passengers from noticing the
depredation.]</p>

<p>Bromley having discharged our reckoning, we then set out, and
proceeded up Fleet-street, till we observed a crowd of gazers at
the windows of Messrs. Laurie and Whittle, print-sellers. Bromley
immediately joined the throng, we keeping close behind him,
wherever he moved; at length he gave us a sign to cover, and we had
scarcely taken our stations, before Bromley drew back, and pulling
the skirt of my coat, left the crowd, and crossing the way, turned
up a court which led into another street. We followed him close,
till he entered a public house, and we were no sooner in a private
room, than Bromley drew from under his coat a large green
pocket-book, which, it seems, he had, unobserved by me, extracted
from the pocket of a gentleman by whose side he stood, when we
advanced, to cover him. The book, being opened, was found to
contain a complete set of valuable surgeon's instruments, some
private letters, and other papers, and in one of the pockets eleven
pounds in bank notes; the money was immediately divided in equal
shares, and the stranger observing that he knew where to fence[*]
the book, allowed Bromley and myself five shillings each on that
account.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Sell.]</p>

<p>The papers, &amp;c., having been committed to the flames, we
then left the house; but my two companions having observed some
police-officers in Fleet-street, deemed it imprudent to prolong our
stay in that quarter, and it being now nearly dusk, at my request,
we all three returned to the White Swan, as I was curious to know
more of the various characters I had seen assembled there.</p>

<p>The seasonable relief my finances had experienced by this
adventure, without any exertion or risk on my part, gave me much
satisfaction; and I thought, to use the words of Mrs. Peachum, in
the Beggar's Opera, that this was "pretty encouragement for a young
beginner."</p>

<p>It was no sooner dark and the candles lighted, than the room
began to fill apace, and my friend Bromley gave me a description of
each person as he entered, explaining the various branches of
sprigging, &amp;c., in which they excelled, as well as their good
or bad dispositions towards each other. I recognised among them
several faces which I remembered to have seen at different public
places, and even at coffee-houses and ordinaries, where they
intermixed with the best company, and were treated with every
respect.</p>

<p>From this time Bromley and myself became inseparable. This young
man was the son of a respectable master-tailor, and was himself
bred to the same trade. Having formed bad connexions, (the usual
root of all evil,) he had quitted his father's house about a year
before I first knew him, and associating with "family people" had
since supported himself by depredation; he was two years older than
myself, and his father considering him irreclaimable, had long
since given him up.</p>

<p>For a few weeks we continued to go out[*] with one or other of
the gentlemen frequenting the Swan; and after I had made the first
essay, I became pretty expert in the art of buzzing. Our success
was various, but we managed to live well, and I for my part soon
acquired a good stock of clothes, books, and other comforts, as
they were considered by me. As for Bromley, he was not so good a
manager, and when absent from me, he led a very irregular life,
lavishing his money without discrimination on the most unworthy
objects, without taking any thought for the morrow, so that though
our gains were equal, I became every day richer, while he was
seldom master of a guinea beforehand. By degrees we detached
ourselves from the society of those veteran prigs[**], with whom we
had first associated, and not confining our operations to one
branch of depredation, we had recourse to various methods of
getting money.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* To go a thieving.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[** Thieves.]</p>

<p>It would be tedious to particularise every species of fraud and
robbery, which we practised in the short space of three months, at
the end of which period, it will be seen that the hand of justice
arrested our further progress; and it is hardly credible, (but such
is the fact,) that during this our limited career, we exercised
alternately the following numerous modes of depredation; which,
least the reader should be unprovided with a cant dictionary, I
shall briefly explain in succession: <i>viz.</i>, buzzing[1],
dragging[2], sneaking[3], hoisting[4], pinching[5], smashing[6]
jumping[7], spanking[8], and starring[9]; together with the
kidrig[10], the letter-racket [11], the order-racket[12], and the
snuff-racket[13].</p>

<p class="footnote">[1. Buzzing: Picking pockets in general.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[2. Dragging: Robbing carts, or carriages, of
bales, trunks, &amp;c.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[3. Sneaking: Entering a house or shop,
unobserved, and stealing whatever is most come-at-able.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[4. Hoisting: Shop-lifting.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[5. Pinching: Secreting small trinkets of value
in a shop, while pretending to select and purchase something.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[6. Smashing: Uttering counterfeit money, or
forged bank-notes.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[7. Jumping: Getting in at the lower windows of
private houses, and robbing the apartments of plate or other
portable goods.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[8. Spanking: Breaking a shop-window at night,
having first tied the door to prevent a pursuit, then snatching at
any articles of value within reach.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[9. Starring: Cutting a hole in a pane of
glass, without noise, in order to rob the window of something
before determined on.]</p>

<p class="footnote">[10. The Kidrig: Defrauding errand boys, or

<p class="footnote">[11. The Letter-Racket: Obtaining money from

<p class="footnote">[12. The Order-Racket: Obtaining goods from a

<p class="footnote">[13. The Snuff-Racket: Throwing snuff in the
eyes of a shop-keeper, and then running off with such money or
valuable property as may lay within reach.]</p>

<p>In these various exploits, we were sometimes assisted by a third
person; and at others, though very rarely, we formed part of a
numerous gang; but in general we acted by ourselves, and,
considering our youth and inexperience, evinced a good deal of
dexterity.</p>

<p>In the month of July, 1800, finding myself inclined for a summer
excursion into the country, I determined on a trip to Plymouth,
having never been in the West of England, and invited my friend
Bromley to accompany me. As we, neither of us, possessed much
money, I proposed to travel in the same manner as I had formerly
done, in my Portsmouth expedition, and to defray our expenses by
practising the same imposition, which I now well knew to be a
systematic fraud, known among "family people" by the title of "the
letter-racket."</p>

<p>We accordingly left town together, equipped with a few
indispensables, contained in a small bundle which we carried
alternately, and provided with a new edition of "Carey's
Itinerary." Our first resting-place was Hammersmith, where, in the
course of four hours, I realized as many pounds; my companion in
the mean time lying dormant in a public-house, for in this practice
he was not qualified to bear a part; but we intended to omit no
opportunity which might offer of obtaining money by any other
means.</p>

<p>Quitting Hammersmith, we proceeded to Hounslow, where we arrived
the same evening, and reposed for the night. The following day was
spent in collecting from the well-disposed inhabitants of the town,
and on the ensuing morning, we walked to Staines a distance of
seven miles. Arriving at the latter place about one o'clock, we put
up at a genteel public-house, and regaled ourselves with a good
dinner. We had just dined, and were enjoying a pipe, and a bowl of
punch, when a respectable looking old gentleman entered the room,
and begged, if it was agreeable, to take a pipe with us. This being
a sort of public parlour, of course we could have no objection, and
we soon entered into familiar chat, the stranger proving a very
pleasant companion. Having passed about an hour in conversation, I
rose, and, apologizing to the old gentleman, told Bromley I would
step out and transact a little business, desiring him to entertain
the stranger until my return. My intention was to visit some of the
most respectable inhabitants with my petition, and Bromley, of
course, well understood my meaning.</p>

<p>On quitting the inn, which was situated in the principal street,
and about the centre of the town, I turned to my right band,
towards London, proposing to take the houses and shops on that side
the street, until I came to the extremity or entrance of the town,
and then to return on the other side, until I arrived opposite our
inn; calculating that this task would occupy the remainder of that
day, and meaning on the next to make a circuit of the other half of
the town.</p>

<p>My first essay was at a watch-maker's, about six doors from the
house at which we put up. Entering the shop with my letter in my
hand, I was rather surprised at finding no person in attendance,
and still more so, when upon knocking on the counter, not a soul
appeared to answer me. Casting my eyes round, I perceived a door of
communication with a back-room, in which I distinctly heard a child
crying, and the voice of a woman soothing it. There were a number
of watches hanging in the window, and conceiving I ought to profit
by this opportunity, I determined without hesitation to do so.
Having, therefore, first slightly repeated my knock, and then
looked up and down the street, in which (as frequently happens in
country towns,) not a creature appeared, I commenced my
depredations. The window, as is usual with watch-makers, was
enclosed with a kind of lattice-work, and there was no means of
access to the watches, but by a small gate, which opened behind the
counter. The attempt was rather hazardous, but the temptation
predominated, and over the counter I jumped. Having entered the
little enclosure, I took down the watch nearest to me, which was a
silver one, and put it in my pocket, then another, also silver, and
had just extended my hand towards a third, which from the colour I
supposed to be gold, when lo! to my utter confusion, the very same
old gentleman I had left in the company of Bromley, advanced to the
window, as if passing by; but stopping short, and looking earnestly
towards me for a moment, he suddenly turned round, and appearing
much agitated, retraced his steps as fast as his age would permit
him towards the inn. This transaction was of course momentary, and
I had no time for reflection; but the terror and alarm always
consequent on conscious guilt, operated so strongly upon my mind,
that it instantly struck me the old man had been aware of my
depredations, and had hurried away to give an alarm, and cause my
apprehension. My fears were so great that I had not even power to
take down the third watch, but hastened out of the shop, and on
gaining the street, turned to my right hand, (not daring to return
to the inn,) and putting the best foot foremost, I found myself in
a few minutes at the end of the town, and the London road lying
before me. However, as I every moment expected to be pursued and
overtaken, I was afraid to continue in that road; but, availing
myself of the first turning I came to, which was a narrow lane on
my right, I quitted the turnpike road, intending to take a
circuitous course, in order to avoid a pursuit.</p>

<p>It was now about five o'clock, and although I much regretted the
situation in which I had left poor Bromley, who had no money about
him, as I was always purse-bearer, yet I conceived it would be
madness in me to return to Staines, convinced as I was of the
danger to which I had exposed myself. I therefore determined to
proceed direct to town, not doubting that Bromley would find means
to extricate himself, and speedily follow me. I was for some time
at a loss to find my way, but meeting a countryman, he directed me;
and after crossing a number of fields, and scrambling over hedges
and ditches, I gained the high road once more, and pushing forward,
stopped at length to refresh myself at a public-house about five
miles from Staines.</p>

<p>It was by this time dusk, and, while I was baiting at this
house, one of the Bath stages luckily stopping at the door, I
applied to the coachman for a passage, and ascending the vehicle,
arrived safe at Hyde-park corner, about nine o'clock the same
night.</p>

<p>The following day I was, of course, anxiously solicitous about
poor Bromley. I made inquiry for him at every place he was
accustomed to frequent, but without success, during the whole
morning. At length, about four in the afternoon, as I was walking
through Leicester-fields, I unexpectedly met him, to my great
satisfaction. Mutual inquiries immediately took place; and I was
surprised to hear him express the greatest astonishment at my
sudden departure from Staines, for which he told me he was unable
to account. This of course produced an explanation, when it
appeared that nothing whatever had transpired respecting the
robbery I had committed, nor had Bromley seen or heard any more of
the old gentleman after the latter quitted his company, which he
did a few minutes after myself. I must, therefore, have been
mistaken in my notion that he had observed my actions through the
watch-maker's window, of which, at the moment, I entertained no
doubt; so true it is, that a guilty conscience needs no accuser.
What could have occasioned his sudden retreat, is therefore still a
mystery to me.</p>

<p>Bromley then proceeded to inform me, that on finding I did not
return about my usual hour to tea, he began to fear something
unpleasant had happened, and had accordingly taken a walk through
the town, in quest of me; but not succeeding in his object, his
astonishment and fears increased, and both were heightened when
bed-time approached without my appearance. That being willing,
however, to hope for the best, he had supped by himself, and
telling the landlady, that he supposed his friend was detained on
business which prevented his return, he had at length retired to
bed. The following morning he renewed his search, and meeting with
no better success, he took French leave of the landlady, suffering
her to retain our common bundle of necessaries, which, indeed, were
of more value than our reckoning could amount to; and quitting
Staines about eight o'clock, the poor fellow had travelled on foot
to town, (a distance of sixteen miles,) having accidentally one
shilling in his pocket, which procured him a breakfast, at the same
public-house at which I took the Bath stage.</p>

<p>Thus ended our projected expedition to Plymouth; for having been
so disappointed in the outset, we had no inclination to make a
second attempt. I sold the two watches for five pounds, and
dividing that sum, as well as the residue of what I had acquired by
the "Letter racket," with Bromley, we turned our thoughts to other
modes of obtaining money.</p>

<p>Soon after my return to London, from Staines, I was one day
passing through Newgate-street, immediately opposite the walls of
Newgate, when observing a grave-looking elderly gentleman, who was
walking just before me, to have a pocket-book in his outside
coat-pocket, I made an attempt to ease him of it; but it being of
an unusual size, and rather ponderous, it slipped from my fingers,
and alarmed the gentleman; who, turning round sharply, and seeing
me close behind him, clapped his hand upon my shoulder, saying very
drily, "Holloa! young man, when did you come to town?" I of course
affected to be much surprised, and with a look of displeasure at
his freedom, begged he would explain his meaning. The stranger
staring me full in the face, and smiling sarcastically, pointed
with his finger to the opposite walls; and, in a low voice, said,
"You see that stone building, my pretty youth; mark my words, that
will be your resting-place very soon."&mdash;Then, without
suffering me to reply, he crossed hastily towards Snow-hili,
leaving me to reflect at leisure upon his words, and wonder at the
strangeness of this adventure!</p>

<p>This gentleman, one would think, possessed the gift of prophecy;
for, as he had foretold, in less than six weeks after, I actually
became an inmate of Newgate!</p>

<p>On Sunday the 17th of August, 1800, Bromley and myself, after
breakfasting together, agreed to walk into the city; our business
there, being to purchase some base half-guineas and seven-shilling
pieces, of a Jew in Petticoat-lane, Whitechapel. We accordingly set
out, and about one o'clock entered Cheapside, when we observed a
great concourse of people, assembled round the door and windows of
a draper's shop. As is natural to persons in London, we entered the
crowd out of curiosity; at least that was my sole motive, for I
always opposed robbing on the Sabbath-day: (at which the reader may
perhaps smile.)&mdash;My partner Bromley, however, had an eye to
business, and I soon perceived by his motions, that he was
scrutinizing the pockets of the spectators. I was, however, at some
distance from him, and signified my dissent by a look; in fact, I
had no sooner ascertained the object of the people's curiosity,
which was an attempt made in the preceding night, to break the shop
open, of which the shutters bore evident marks, than I beckoned to
Bromley, and made the best of my way out of the crowd.</p>

<p>I had no doubt but he would immediately follow me, and having
got clear of the mob, and proceeded slowly about thirty yards from
the spot, on my way towards Whitechapel, I made a stand, and turned
round to see if Bromley was coming. The reader, (<i>unless he
doubts my veracity</i>) will judge of my surprise, when I saw my
poor companion, struggling with a man who held him at arm's length
with one hand, and had in the other a silk handkerchief; at the
same time calling after a person who had also left the crowd, and
was proceeding the contrary way, (towards Saint Paul's,) "Stop Sir,
come back, you're robb'd." The person called to, immediately turned
back, and at the same moment, the fellow who held Bromley, seeing
me looking earnestly at the transaction, exclaimed, pointing at me,
"Stop him in the blue coat! that's the other." Knowing my
innocence, I did not attempt to escape; and a man now advancing to
the spot where I stood, seized me by the collar, and dragged me
back to the crowd. The person said to be robbed, had by this time
returned, and being desired to search if he had lost any thing, did
so, and missed his handkerchief. The man who had apprehended
Bromley, proved to be a turnkey at the Poultry-Compter, and a city
constable; the other, who seized me, was brother to the former, and
also a peace officer, their name, Alderman.</p>

<p>These two having now taken the address of the stranger, who
identified the handkerchief, and having desired him to attend the
next day at the Mansion-House, they proceeded to escort Bromley and
myself to the Compter. On arriving at this prison, they immediately
searched us, and took from each of us a silk handkerchief, a
pocket-book, and other articles, all our own property; but
unluckily Bromley had a second handkerchief about him, (I believe a
white muslin one,) which he had worn round his neck the preceding
day.&mdash;Being now locked up by ourselves, we had leisure to talk
over this unfortunate affair, and I could not help censuring
Bromley for the imprudent act he had committed, especially where
the object was so insignificant. Indeed, I had frequently, since
our connexion, had occasion to blame him for taking so petty an
article as a handkerchief, which, notwithstanding, he persisted in
doing, particularly if it was of a fancy pattern. However, as there
was no recalling the event, it was agreed that he should make the
best defence he could for himself, and deny any knowledge of me,
which, as I was not near him, when he was detected, I conceived
would effectually procure my liberation.</p>

<p>Thus, after committing numerous acts of robbery with impunity, I
was at last apprehended for what I had no more actual concern in,
than the reader of the page I am now writing.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch113" id="ch113"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p><i>Examined before the Lord Mayor.&mdash;Fully committed, tried,
and cast.&mdash;My Father's Faith and Assurances.&mdash;My
Disappointment on being transported for Seven Years.&mdash;Contract
the Gaol Distemper, and am reduced to the point of

</p>

<p>The next day, Monday, we were taken to the Mansion-House for
examination, before the Lord Mayor. The owner of the handkerchief
being in attendance, one of the officers acquainted his lordship,
that observing both Bromley and myself to be very busy in the crowd
assembled in Cheapside, the preceding day, and suspecting our
designs, he had watched us narrowly, and at length observed Bromley
to take a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, which he
immediately endeavoured to convey to me; but before he could do so,
he, the witness, laid hold of him, and took the handkerchief from
his hand; on which (he stated) I endeavoured to escape, but that he
pointed me out to his brother, who happened to be with him, and
desired him to secure me, while he himself called back the
gentleman who had been robbed, and informed him of the
circumstance. (So much for the veracity of this deponent's
evidence, to which he afterwards deliberately swore!)</p>

<p>His brother corroborated the foregoing account, which he was
well enabled to do, having heard the whole of it; and with this
addition, that in the course of his duty as a city constable, he
had seen us daily perambulating the streets, during the busy hours,
and knew us both to be notorious pick-pockets. (This was more
wickedly false than all the rest, for we had never given one of the
city officers the least opportunity to suspect or notice us, but it
had the effect they intended; that of inducing the magistrate and
prosecutor to deal more rigidly with us.) They further swore, that
on searching us, they found two pocket-books, several
handkerchiefs, and other suspicious articles, (meaning by these
last, I suppose a small knife, and a pair of scissors, which we
each carried about us,) all which they doubted not to be
stolen!</p>

<p>Mr. Dowell, the person they had invited to prosecute us, now
deposed that he was a tradesman living in Chancery-lane; that he
knew nothing of the robbery, but being called back by the first
witness, he missed his pocket-handkerchief, and that the one
produced by the officer, he believed to be his, as it was of the
same pattern, but had no mark by which he could identify it. His
lordship then calling upon us for our defence, Bromley declared
that he had picked the handkerchief up in the crowd; and at the
same moment the officer seized him, and charged him with stealing
it; that he was going on his own business at the time of this
affair happening, and that so far from my being in his company, he
never saw me before in his life.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor appearing to have some pity on our youth, asked
Mr. Dowell if he was determined to prosecute us, hinting at the
same time, that he, (his Lordship) did not wish to urge him to that
measure, provided we were willing to enter into His Majesty's
service, but that he was at liberty to act as he thought fit. I was
in great hopes that Mr. Dowell would incline to lenity, but the
officers took him on one side, and found means to persuade him that
he ought, for the sake of the public, to let the law take its
course. He was thereupon bound over to prosecute, and we were
committed to take our trial at the next Old Bailey Sessions,
commencing the 17th of September. For the present, we were remanded
to the Poultry Compter; there to remain until moving day, that is,
the Thursday before sessions.</p>

<p>As I conceived myself in some danger from the inveterate malice
of the two brothers, I deemed it advisable to take all possible
measures for my deliverance; and it occurred to me, that as I knew
no person in London whom I could depend on as a real friend, I
should do well to inform my father of my situation, and request the
aid of his experience, and personal mediation, in my
behalf.&mdash;It was now upwards of five years since I had any
intercourse with my parents, further than twice or thrice calling
at their residence, with a formal inquiry after their health, and
sometimes a cold salutation when my father and I met in the
streets: at which times I always avoided any explanation as to my
circumstances, or the mode of life I led; and since my quitting the
navy, I had never exchanged a word with them. I now therefore wrote
to my father, acquainting him with my distress, and begging to see
him without delay. He very soon complied with my request, and I
informed him, (with as much adherence to truth as I thought
necessary,) of the cause of my confinement.</p>

<p>My father, who I have before mentioned to have been unfortunate
in his speculations, had been for several years declining in the
world, and notwithstanding his want of affection towards me, I felt
much concern at his decayed appearance. He promised me every
assistance he could render by his personal exertions, but declared
his inability to extend pecuniary aid, the times being at this
crisis peculiarly hard, and every necessary of life daily advancing
in price. Fortunately I had some good clothes, &amp;c., and a few
pounds in money by me; and my father, being directed by me,
repaired to my lodgings, and secured all my effects, which he
removed to his own house, supplying me occasionally with such
articles or money, as I found myself in need of. My father, at this
period, resided in St. George's Fields, where he had taken and
furnished a small house, the major part of which he let out in
lodgings. By this expedient, and I believe (under the rose,) a
little dabbling in the lottery, he made a shift to keep the wolf
(or rather the bailiff) from the door. My mother also visited me in
the Compter, accompanied by my two sisters, and shewed me every
attention in her power.</p>

<p>Being removed on the usual day to Newgate, I applied myself to
draw up a brief, for the purpose of employing a counsel in behalf
of my unfortunate companion, who had not himself the means of
obtaining legal assistance. As to myself, I conceived nothing but
the grossest perjury could induce a jury to convict me, under the
circumstances of my apprehension; knowing as I do, that in no court
in Europe, has a prisoner so much justice shewn him, or such lenity
in a doubtful case, as at the Old Bailey: besides, my father
believing my protestations of innocence, (I mean of all connexion
with Bromley,) would not for a moment entertain a doubt of my
acquittal, and therefore opposed the unnecessary expense of feeing
counsel. Having completed the brief to my satisfaction, I sent it
(unknown to my father) with the usual fee, to Mr. Alley.</p>

<p>Every thing being thus arranged, and a true bill returned by the
grand jury upon the evidence of the officers to the same effect as
before, I was on the 23d of September put to the bar, together with
Bromley; and, as I have so frequently read the printed report of
our trial, that it will never be erased from my memory, I shall
give the reader the substance of the proceedings, which I can do
nearly verbatim: and, I believe upon the whole, a more
extraordinary trial has been seldom found upon record.</p>

<hr>

<p class="cp">TRIAL, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Alexander Bromley and James Vaux, were indicted for feloniously
stealing on the 17th of August, a handkerchief, value two
shillings, the goods of William Dowel), privily from his
person.</p>

<p>To this indictment the prisoners pleaded "Not guilty."</p>

<p>Mr. Alley, counsel for Bromley, desired that the witnesses might
be examined apart, with which request the court complied.</p>

<p>William Alderman sworn.&mdash;"I am a city constable, and
turnkey of the Poultry Compter. On Sunday the 17th of August, I was
passing through Cheapside, when observing a crowd of persons
collected together, I went up to inquire the cause; I there saw the
two prisoners, and knowing them to be suspicious characters, I
watched their motions, and presently saw Bromley take a
handkerchief from the pocket of the prosecutor, which he attempted
to give to Vaux, but before Vaux could take it from him, I seized
Bromley with the handkerchief in his hand." (Here witness went on
to describe our apprehension, in the same terms as he had done
before the Lord Mayor). "I can produce the handkerchief; I have had
it ever since.&mdash;On searching the prisoners, we found upon them
two pocket-books, and several handkerchiefs, with other suspicious
articles; but the Lord Mayor ordered them to be returned, when he
committed the prisoners for trial."</p>

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.&mdash;<i>Q.</i> Which of the
prisoners took the handkerchief?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> They both had hold of it: the biggest, Vaux, let go
immediately.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then you mean to swear they both took it?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Which pocket was it taken from?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The left-hand coat-pocket.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> You know there is a reward, if these two poor boys are
convicted. Was it you that advised the prosecutor to lay this
indictment capital?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The grand jury found the bill. (<i>Witness ordered to
withdraw.</i>)</p>

<p>Thomas Aldermaqn sworn,&mdash;"I was with my brother. I saw both
the prisoners very busy, lifting up the lids of people's pockets.
Bromley took a gentleman's handkerchief, on which my brother seized
him. I apprehended Vaux. He had got away to some distance from the
crowd."</p>

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.&mdash;<i>Q.</i> What are you.
Sir?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I am a tailor, and a constable of the city.</p>

<p>Q. So you thought you could get more by prosecuting these two
poor young lads, than by sitting on your shop-board at work?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I did my duty.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Who took the handkerchief?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Bromley took it out, and Vaux laid hold of the corner,
to take it from Bromley.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Which pocket was it in, the right or the left?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The right-hand pocket[1].</p>

<p class="footnote">[* See the evidence of William Alderman.]</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Now, Sir, you know these poor lads are trying for an
offence, for which they are liable to be hanged, if they are
convicted: I ask you, upon the oath you have taken, whether you
ever heard of two persons putting their hands in a man's pocket at
once?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I never did.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then if your brother has said so, he has told a
lie?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That he certainly has. (<i>A general laugh in the
court.</i>)</p>

<p>[<i>The handkerchief produced and identified by the prosecutor,
from its similitude to the one he lost.</i>]</p>

<p>Bromley called four witnesses, and Vaux two witnesses, who gave
them a good character.</p>

<p>Bromley's defence.&mdash;"I picked the handkerchief up in the
crowd."</p>

<p>Vaux's defence.&mdash;"I am innocent."</p>

<p>Bromley, <i>Guilty</i> (aged 20,)</p>

<p>Vaux, <i>Guilty</i> (aged 18,)</p>

<p><i>Of stealing the handkerchief value eleven pence.</i>
</p>

<p>Thus ended this curious trial, to the general dissatisfaction of
a crowded audience, who expressed their sentiments by loud and
distinct murmurs. The jury returned the above verdict, in order to
reduce the offence to a simple felony, by finding the value of the
property under one shilling, stealing from the person to which
amount is death. My father, together with Mr. Kirby, the keeper of
Newgate, stood at my elbow during the whole trial, and both advised
me to make the laconic defence I did. It was their firm belief,
that I should be acquitted, and the result surprised them much. The
witnesses to Bromley's character were tailors, with whom he had
formerly worked; those in my favour, were very respectable
tradesmen, adduced by my father. On leaving the bar, the latter, as
well as Mr. Kirby, comforted me with the assurance, that the court
would only impose a small fine[*] upon us; and my father promised
to use all his interest, and that of his friends with the Recorder,
previous to the latter passing sentence, for which end Mr. Kirby
advised a petition to be immediately prepared. This task I
accomplished the next day, and delivered it to my father for
presentation.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A short confinement is here meant.</p>
]

<p>Both Bromley and myself (buoyed up by the assurances
above-mentioned,) entertained the fullest hopes that our sentence
would be lenient. On the last day of the session, according to
custom, all the prisoners convicted, were brought into court, to
receive judgment. Those capitally convicted were first put to the
bar, and received the awful sentence of death; after which, a few
were ordered to be transported for fourteen years; and then forty
persons were called in succession, (among whom were myself and
Bromley,) and being placed at the bar, the whole forty were
collectively sentenced to seven years transportation, beyond the
high seas! This severe doom affected us both in a very great
degree. I, for my part, was inconsolable, and shed tears in
abundance. My father, on visiting me the next day, professed much
concern, and would have still flattered me with hopes of a reverse;
but I have since had good reason to believe, that instead of using
his influence in my favour, he secretly approved of the event,
conceiving, I suppose, that sending me out of the country, might
save me from a still worse fate; and, that this was therefore, (to
use the common phrase of parents on such occasions,) the best thing
that could have happened for me.</p>

<p>After the first effects of our grief had subsided, the society
of our fellow-prisoners, and the bustle constantly prevailing in
the prison, soon banished every trace of sorrow, and we became as
cheerful as the best. My father and mother paid me every attention,
and the produce of my own effects was fully adequate to my support
for several months: when that resource failed, my father
contributed his mite; and with the help of another friend or two, I
was comparatively comfortable during my continuance in Newgate. As
for Bromley, his father, on hearing his sad fate, had allotted him
a weekly pittance, sufficient, with care, to keep him above
want.</p>

<p>About a month after the close of the session, the gaol being
unusually crowded with prisoners, a most dreadful contagion, called
the gaol fever, made its appearance, and spread so universally,
throughout every ward and division of the prison, that very few
escaped its attack. I was one of the first to contract it, and was
immediately carried to the infirmary, or sick-ward of the prison,
where I only remember having my irons taken off, and being put to
bed; for the same night, I became delirious, and was so dreadfully
affected, as to continue insensible for three weeks, during which
time, I had no knowledge of my parents, or of any other person who
approached me; and the fever raged to such a degree, that I was
obliged to be bound in my bed, in order to restrain me from acts of
mischief. My poor companion, Bromley, was attacked about the same
time as myself; and, on recovering my reason, I found him laid in
the adjacent bed to my own, and was informed his sufferings had
been equally grievous with mine. It pleased God, however, to
restore us both to perfect health; but numerous were the unhappy
persons who fell victims to this dire disease.</p>

<p>It is usual to make occasional draughts, of convicts under
sentence of transportation, from Newgate to the Hulks at Woolwich,
Portsmouth, &amp;c., on board of which receptacles they continue
until a ship is in readiness, to convey them to New South Wales.
Few prisoners are suffered to remain above three months in the
prison, after their conviction. A longer continuance is effected
either by bribery or interest. My father, having heard a shocking
account of the Hulks, had waited on Mr. Kirby, the gaoler, soon
after my receiving sentence, and obtained a promise that I should
remain in Newgate, until a ship was on the point of sailing for
this colony; and herein, he was as good as his word.&mdash;My
father, at length received a private invitation from Mr. Kirby,
that he had no time to lose in arranging matters for my departure:
accordingly, with the assistance of two or three other friends, my
father contrived to pack up a few of the most necessary comforts
for my use on the passage, which he afterwards sent to Portsmouth
by the coach.</p>

<p>On the 15th of May, 1801, my father, mother, and sisters, came
to take a final leave of me; there was something solemn in this
scene, which affected me much, though our mutual regard was not of
the most violent nature. I also took leave of my companion in
adversity, who, by what means I know not, still remained in
Newgate, but was shortly after my departure, removed to the hulks
at Portsmouth.&mdash;The next morning (May 16th,) at four o'clock,
myself, and thirteen others, who had been all kept back for this
opportunity, were attached together by a strong chain, and escorted
by the keeper and his subordinates to Blackfriars-bridge, where a
lighter was in readiness to receive us, in which we proceeded down
the river Thames to Gravesend, and about noon arrived alongside the
Minorca transport. Captain Leith, bound for Port-Jackson, in
company with the Canada and Nile, which ships were also lying at
this anchorage, for the purpose of receiving their prisoners on
board.</p>

</p>

<p>HAVING entered the ship, we were all indiscriminately stripped,
(according to indispensable custom) and were saluted with several
buckets of salt-water, thrown over our heads by a boatswain's mate.
After undergoing this watery ordeal, we were compelled to put on a
suit of slop-clothing. Our own apparel, though good in kind, being
thrown overboard. We were then double-ironed, and put
between-decks, where we selected such births, for sleeping,
&amp;c., as each thought most eligible. The next day, we received
on board forty-six more prisoners, from the Hulks at Woolwich, and
the Canada fifty. The Nile also took on board one hundred women,
from the different gaols in Great Britain. The three ships then
sailed for Spithead, where, on our arrival, the Minorca and Canada
had their numbers augmented, from the Hulks at Portsmouth, to one
hundred men each. Every thing being now in readiness, we only
waited for the convoy to assemble, with which we were to proceed to
a certain latitude.</p>

<p>During this interval, I wrote the first intimation of my unhappy
state, to my dear and honoured grandfather, palliating the facts as
much as possible, and positively denying any criminal connexion
between myself and Bromley. This I did, in order to save those
heart-rending pangs, which I knew my venerable and virtuous
benefactors would suffer, if they had been acquainted with the
dissolute life I had for some time led. In a few days, I received a
long and most affectionate letter from my grandfather, in which he
deplored the harshness of my destiny; but far from aggravating my
sufferings by reflections on my manifold indiscretions, this good
old man laboured only to press my resignation to the dispensations
of Providence, and to exhort me, by my future conduct, to make
atonement for the past. He added a great deal of good advice, as to
my behaviour in the degraded state to which I was reduced,
concluding with his blessing, and that of my grandmother, and a
most pathetic and tender farewell.&mdash;I had assured my
grandfather in my letter, that no extension of pecuniary aid could
at all ameliorate my situation, as I had a sufficient store of
necessary comforts for my voyage: my motive for this assurance,
was, to prevent him from distressing himself still further in his
old age on an object so worthless as myself, by whose expensive
adoption and education, he and the partner of his griefs were
already reduced to a state bordering on indigence, aggravated by
mental anxiety and sorrow for me, the unworthy cause.</p>

<p>On the 21st. of June, we sailed from Spithead, in company with
about three hundred sail of merchantmen, bound to various ports,
under convoy of a frigate and a sloop of war. The convoy parted
from us soon after we passed the Canary Islands, and our three
ships proceeded in company. A few days after we put to sea, I was
noticed by Captain Leith, to whom I had (as my grandfather advised
me) offered the services of my pen, &amp;c. The captain, in
consequence, employed me during the voyage in writing his Log,
Journal, and other accompts, and extended to me all the indulgence
my situation would admit of. The latter end of August we arrived at
Rio de Janeiro, where we had every refreshment the place afforded,
and, after a continuance of thirty days, we resumed our voyage.
Nothing worthy of notice occurred therein; our little squadron kept
company until we made the Harbour of Port Jackson, which we did on
the 14th of December, and the same day came to an anchor in
Sydney-cove.</p>

<p>Among my fellow-prisoners, was a young man named Calvert, with
whom I had become very intimate. In the course of our passage, this
person had shewn me an open letter of recommendation to John
Palmer, Esq., then Commissary of New South Wales, which was from a
particular friend of the latter gentleman, and pleaded strongly in
favour of the bearer. A few days before our arrival, it occurred to
me, that a humble application in my own behalf to Mr. Palmer might
have the effect of obtaining for me some little distinction, as I
heard a most amiable character of him, and conceived my services
might not be unacceptable in his public department. I therefore
wrote a respectful letter, which I consigned to the care of Captain
Leith, who promised not only to deliver it himself, but to speak in
my favour, both to Mr. Palmer and his Excellency the governor.</p>

<p>The second day after our arrival, several gentlemen came on
board, to muster and inspect the prisoners: among the number was
Mr. Palmer himself, who, having received my letter, was pleased to
tell me, in the kindest manner, that he had mentioned me to the
Governor, and that I might accordingly expect a favourable
appointment on my landing. The majority of the prisoners were sent
up the country, the day after the muster, to various kinds of
labour, but myself and a few others, were detained on board until
the 29th, on which day we landed at Sydney, and were immediately
conducted to Government-House, in order to be severally examined
and disposed of by Governor King. We were called in succession for
our audience; and, when it came to my turn, I entered the room with
a respectful bow to the gentlemen assembled; for there were seated
at a table, several officers of the colony, besides his Excellency.
The latter, however, I soon distinguished by his manner of
addressing me, and as the particulars of this interview may afford
some entertainment to those who were not acquainted with the
eccentric character of Governor King, I shall give the reader our
conversation in dialogue, as near as my memory will permit.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> (Regarding me from head to foot, with a most
inquisitive eye, or rather four eyes, for he wore spectacles, and,
with a manner, the very reverse to encouraging) "Well, Mr. Vaux,
what were you sent here for?"</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> (Of course a little embarrassed at this unexpected
question, so abruptly put,) "Sir, I had the misfortune to be
acquainted with a person of bad character, who in my company
committed"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> (Interrupting me impatiently) "But Mr. Vaux,
come to the point at once. I don't want you to come round here, and
then back again, and round the other way, (drawing circles on the
table with his finger, and all the while staring at me, which
indeed he continued to do as long as I remained in the room, as if
determined to put me out of countenance); recollect, Mr. Vaux, you
are not at the bar of the Old Bailey now. Come to the point, Sir,
come to the point. I ask you what you were sent here for?"</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> "Sir, I was charged with picking a gentleman's
pocket, but, though your Excellency may doubt my assertion, I
solemnly assure you, I was innocent of that fact."</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> (with a most satirical smile, and throwing
himself back in his chair) "O, I dare say, Mr. Vaux, very innocent
no doubt. Quite innocent, I dare say. So the long and the short of
it is, you were sent here for picking pockets."</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> "I confess, Sir, that was the charge."</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> "What have you been brought up to, Mr.
Vaux?"</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> "Sir, I have been chiefly employed in the law; but
I profess to be a clerk in general."</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> "Pray, Sir, what office were you in last?"</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> "Sir, the last gentleman I served was Mr. Preston,
in King's Bench Walk.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> (With a frown) "That I very much doubt, Sir;
that I very much doubt. Sir; that I very much doubt, Mr, Vaux."</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> I am sorry your Excellency has so bad an opinion of
me; I assure you, Sir, it is the fact."</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> Well, Mr. Vaux, I shall send you to a place,
where your roguery will very soon be found out."</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> "I hope not, your Excellency; I trust you will
have"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> (Interrupting) "Well, I hope so too, Mr. Vaux;
I hope so too, I hope so too, Sir; but mind&mdash;I only give you a
caution; take care of yourself."</p>

<p>Then hastily scribbling a few words on a scrap of paper, he
handed it to me, and ordering a light-horseman to attend me, made a
motion for me to withdraw, which I was glad enough to do, in order
to be relieved from this embarrassing examination.&mdash;On going
out, the horseman informed me he had orders to see myself and
baggage on board the Paramatta passage-boat; the paper I had
received proved to be an order to the boatman to that effect, and
on the reverse was a memorandum, purporting that I was appointed
clerk to Mr. Baker, Storekeeper at Hawkesbury. Both these documents
were signed P. G. K., as was his usual custom; but the whole so
unintelligibly written, that it cost me much pains and some inquiry
to decipher them.&mdash;I now took up my little box, and my bed,
and was conducted to the wharf, where I found the boat on the point
of departure. After a pleasant passage, we arrived at Parramatta,
at which place I rested the ensuing day, and, on Monday the 21st,
continued my journey by land to Hawkesbury, a distance of
twenty-six miles. On this occasion I joined a party of travellers,
accompanied by a cart in which I had deposited my luggage; these
persons formed a sort of caravan, and were all well-armed, the
natives being at this time in a state of warfare, and the roads
thereby rendered dangerous. Late in the evening we arrived at
Hawkesbury, and being directed to Mr. Baker's house, I immediately
presented myself and my credentials to that gentleman.</p>

</p>

<p>MR. BAKER received me with kindness, and great pleasure, as, my
predecessor having quitted him some weeks before, he was at a loss
for a proper assistant. In a few days I had a comfortable residence
assigned me by the commanding officer of the settlement, and my
duty being exempted from all hard labour, and of such a nature as I
found pleasure in performing, I soon felt myself comparatively
happy.&mdash;With retrospective satisfaction, I can truly say, that
I behaved in this situation with so much propriety as to obtain the
favour of my principal, and the good opinion of the resident
magisstrate, Dr. Arndell, whose four children I attended at my
leisure hours, in the quality of preceptor. Both the gentleman and
Mr. Baker vied with each other, in shewing me every mark of
kindness in their power.&mdash;Mr. Baker informed me that Governor
King made frequent and particular inquiries of him respecting my
conduct, and I felt the highest gratification from the reflection
that I had happily falsified his Excellency's uncharitable
prediction as to my real character. Mr. Palmer also, who had been
the first kind promoter of my good fortune, made similar inquiries
of Mr. Baker, and from the report he received of my talents,
expressed a desire to transfer me from Hawkesbury to the
Commissary's Office at Sydney, in which department there was then a
great press of business, and expert clerks were not, at that
period, so numerous as at present. Mr. Baker, however, being
unwilling to part with me, paid no attention to the wish of Mr.
Palmer, until the latter gentleman at length ordered in direct
terms, by an official letter, that I should be immediately sent to
Sydney. The Governor coming up to Hawkesbury a day or two
afterwards, Mr. Baker represented to his Excellency, the
inconvenience he should suffer, if he was deprived of my
assistance, and obtained an order from him to retain me in his
service. This arrangement was not at all satisfactory to me, for I
had long felt an earnest desire to be employed in the commissariat,
as the public accompts therein kept, were of such a description as
I always took delight in, and I still flatter myself that from my
quickness in figures, I should be perfectly at home in such a
situation. However I was not to be gratified on that occasion, and
I continued in the service of Mr. Baker about three years. I had,
in fact, reconciled myself to the idea of serving out my full term
of banishment with this worthy man; but on a sudden, a letter was
received by Mr. Arndell from Governor King, ordering my instant
removal to Sydney, for the purpose of assisting ms a clerk in the
Secretary's Office, which, as it was then established might be, and
was generally, called the Governor's Office, being attached to
Government House, and under the immediate personal direction of the
Governor himself. Though this preferment seemed to hold out a
prospect of future advantage, and to confer increased
respectability, it was with some regret I quitted my comfortable
little house and garden at "The Green Hills[*]," where I had led a
life of innocence and peaceful retirement; whereas I was now about
to enter a vortex of dissipation, folly and wickedness, for such
was Sydney compared to my late place of abode.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The settlement or camp at Hawkesbury, now
called, the town of Windsor.</p>
]

<p>The Governor received me very graciously, allotted me a neat
brick-house in the vicinity of the office, and a government-man,
victualled from the King's-stores, as a servant. For two or three
months I continued very steady, and formed but few acquaintances.
The Governor behaved to me with great liberality, and refused me no
reasonable request. By degrees, however, I began to degenerate. I
increased my acquaintance among the Commissary's and some other
clerks, most of whom lived an expensive and dissipated life. All I
can say in my own favour, is that I continued to be regular in my
attendance at the office, and was never found defective, or
incapable of my duty; but no sooner was I at my own disposal than I
eagerly sought my dissipated companions, and spent the rest of the
day in drinking, and other irregularities, sometimes at public or
disorderly houses, and frequently at my own, where I had often the
expensive pleasure of entertaining a large party of my
fellow-scribes at my own cost. This course of life unavoidably drew
me into great expenses, and I contracted several debts. Governor
King, whose vigilant observation nothing of this sort could escape,
gave me frequent and serious admonitions for my good; but I was so
infatuated as to disregard all advice, and only thought of devising
pecuniary means to continue my licentious career. This was no easy
task, as the nature of business in the Secretary's Office afforded
few opportunities of realising money by fraud, at least without
the, assistance of one or more confederates in a neighbouring
department. The expensive rate at which the Commissary's clerks
constantly lived, had become matter of surprise to the Governor as
well as the magistrates, and was the theme of much conjecture among
the inhabitants of Sydney. Still, though it was palpable they had
recourse to fraud, they managed matters so adroitly that no
irregularity could be detected; and the efforts of the executive
authority, to develope their system, continued unavailing.</p>

<p>It was the custom of Governor King, as I have before observed,
to use only his initials as a signature on common occasions, and by
application and practice I acquired a knack of imitating this
sign-manual with sufficient accuracy to impose upon the parties to
whom the superscription was addressed. Finding these three letters
to have the magical effect of procuring for me whatever articles I
required, from the King's-stores, I availed myself of their
talismanic power, and converting the goods so obtained into money,
I discharged my debts, and figured away with increased
<i>eclat</i>, among my fellow-clerks. As it was, however, both
impolitic and dangerous to carry this branch, of fraud too far, or
practice it too frequently, I at length found means to form a
connexion with two or three of my most experienced friends, and we
concerted such a system of ways and means as promised liberally to
supply our wants, and, while we continued true to each other,
seemed to preclude a possibility of detection.</p>

<p>As I do not conceive myself justified in exposing either the
parties who were my colleagues, or the particular nature of our
artifices, let it suffice to inform the reader, that (as is indeed
usually and deservedly the fate of all sinister practices) a mere
and most unexpected accident, and for which none of us could attach
blame to ourselves, discovered to the Governor a principal branch
of that prolific tree of fraud and imposition, from whose
productive fruitfulness we had so abundantly derived the means of
gratifying our folly and intemperance, which we at that time
miscalled a love of pleasure; but (to continue the metaphor) the
root and body of this tree, still remained hidden from the strict
and rigid search set on foot by the Governor, and after this
transitory alarm had subsided, proved to its remaining adherents, a
source of supply for a considerable time. It so happened that I was
the ostensible party in the particular affair which led to this
discovery; and Governor King immediately took the most active
measures to effect a full developement of that system which he well
knew to be the ground-work of mal-practices to a considerable
extent.</p>

<p>With this view I underwent several private examinations before
his Excellency and some of the principal officers, and great
promises were held out to extract information from me, but without
effect, as I was determined not to betray my friends, whose ruin
could not at all palliate my guilty or, as I conceived, render me a
whit more deserving of mercy. I therefore persisted in asserting my
innocence of the present charge, and disclaimed all knowledge of
fraud in any other person.</p>

<p>The Governor was so much exasperated at my obstinacy, that he at
length had recourse (as a <i>dernier resort</i>,) to the expedient
of flogging to extort confession. I must, however, (for justice
sake,) acknowledge that such cruelty was rarely exercised by
Governor King, who in his cooler moments was a most humane
character. To the honour of our present governor (Macquarie,) be it
recorded, that not only this inhuman practice is exploded, but
corporal punishment is seldom inflicted at all, and when rendered
necessary, it is used with moderation.</p>

<p>To resume, the Governor finding me firm in my resolution to give
him no satisfaction, ordered Dr. Harris, who was present, to take
me to the jail-yard, send for the public executioner, and there to
give me five-and-twenties, (this was his phrase,) till I confessed
the whole truth. Pursuant to this order I accompanied Mr. Harris to
the appointed spot, and while the finisher of the law was arranging
matters for the approaching ceremony, the Doctor used all his art
of persuasion to induce me for my own sake, to avoid the disgrace
and pain of a correction, which he must, if I continued obstinate,
inflict in its fullest extent.</p>

<p>There was certainly much justice in this gentleman's arguments,
and, although I am confident I could have summoned up resolution to
have continued silent under the threatened chastisement, yet, on
mature reflection, I was convinced of the folly of such a conduct,
as there was already sufficient and incontrovertible proof of guilt
against me. I, therefore, determined to acknowledge my errors, and
submit my fate to the Governor's pleasure. Of this intention I
acquainted Mr. Harris, who immediately stayed the proceedings about
to take place, and supplying me with pen and paper, desired me to
write my declaration, which he would himself convey to the
Governor. In the letter I hastily composed, I informed his
Excellency, that feelings of remorse and regret for my ill conduct,
rather than a fear of punishment, had induced me to confess to him
that I was guilty of the charge brought against me on the present
occasion, and with shame I acknowledged having repeatedly
transgressed in a similar manner, in order to defray the expenses
of the unbecoming course of life I had imprudently fallen into. But
I positively declared that no other person whatever was privy to my
numerous acts of fraud, as those counterfeit documents framed by
me, had passed through the usual official channels as genuine; and,
consequently, the parties who had admitted and sanctioned them,
were utterly guiltless of connivance, and had done no more than
their duty. I added, that I knew how justly I deserved to suffer
for my faults; but I also knew that mercy was the predominant
sentiment in His Excellency's bosom, and on that mercy I therefore
most humbly threw myself.</p>

<p>Doctor Harris immediately proceeded to Government-house with my
letter, and I was soon afterwards summoned to follow in person. His
Excellency seemed not displeased at the course I had adopted, and
he was now in a very mild and placid mood. After expatiating at
some length, and in a serio-comic strain, with his usual
eccentricity, on the ill return I had made for his favours, and so
forth, he was pleased to order me back to the jail, but in a tone
that indicated no severity of intention. It gave me much concern,
however, that notwithstanding all I had before said, or could now
protest on the subject, the Governor ordered a young man in a
confidential situation under government, to be dismissed from his
office, under an impression that he was privy to the fraud in
question. It is true indeed, this person, by the injudicious
defence he made, was the cause of his own misfortune, and had very
nearly, from his statement being at variance with mine, contributed
to ruin all my hopes of belief. But the Governor, who though shrewd
at times, was not at all times a Solomon, thought proper to credit
my assertion, and reject the evidence of the other party, as too
improbable to be received.</p>

<p>The next morning early, an order came to the prison from his
Excellency; that I was to be double-ironed, and put to the hardest
labour, in common with those incorrigible characters composing what
is called the jail-gang: I was in consequence set to work at
mending the public-roads, &amp;c. &amp;c., and as I had never
before used a heavier tool than a goose-quill, I found this penance
to bear hard upon me, and repented me of the evil which had brought
me to this woeful condition.</p>

</p>

<p>I CONTINUED to labour in double-irons, (locked up every night in
the jail,) for about a month, when a draught of men being ordered
to the public agricultural settlement of Castle-hill, twenty-four
miles from Sydney, I was included in the number, and about twenty
of us were immediately sent up, escorted by constables.
Notwithstanding my condition in the jail-gang was deplorable
enough, I felt a greater depression at the thoughts of going to
this settlement, a place of which, from every account, I had
conceived the most unfavourable idea. Though I suffered much in
Sydney, by being obliged to work till three o'clock in so
disgraceful a situation, yet when that hour released me from the
restraint of the overseer, I was enabled to visit my friends and
acquaintances, with whom I enjoyed myself till sunset, when I was
obliged to return to the jail, and was locked up for the night. On
the contrary, Castle-hill being considered a place of punishment,
the prisoners there, who were sent up under circumstances like
mine, were not allowed to quit the settlement at all. On arriving
at Castle-hill, I was first employed at the hoe, which severe
labour was so fatiguing to me, that it had nearly the effect of
breaking my heart. How ever, I contrived at times to obtain a
lighter employment: and during the term of my remaining at this
settlement, I had a spell at almost every kind of work peculiar to
the place.</p>

<p>After a few weeks had elapsed, I prevailed on the superintendent
(Mr. Knight,) who had conceived a partiality for me, to grant me a
pass to Parramatta, eight miles distant, and sixteen from Sydney. I
had an anxious wish to visit the latter place, but Mr. Knight had
no power to extend his permission so far, and I knew that
application to the magistrates at Parramatta would be fruitless. I,
therefore, determined to hazard a flogging, which would be the
consequence of my detection, and to take the wished-for trip
without leave or license. This being Friday, and my week's work
done, I accordingly set off, accompanied by two or three others,
similarly circumstanced, and after six hours' walking arrived at
Sydney. Here I lay concealed in the house of a friend till Sunday
noon, when I again set out proceeding with the utmost caution, and
arrived at Castle-hill the same night, conformable to the tenor of
my pass. As I expererienced nothing but misery and privation during
five days in each week, and found such enjoyments in Sydney, I
repeated my excursion almost every succeeding Friday, but was not
always equally fortunate in my proceedings. The police in Sydney
having some information of my visits, were constantly on the
look-out for me, and I was at last apprehended, punished with fifty
lashes, and sent back in custody of a constable. This did not deter
me, however, from running the same risk at several subsequent
periods, only redoubling my precautions, and travelling in the
night.</p>

<p>I had been about ten months at Castle-hill, when the person who
had officiated as clerk of the camp, (that is, clerk to the
superintendent,) becoming a free man, quitted the settlement, and I
being the only one qualified for such an office, and in some favour
with Mr. Knight, was promoted to the situation. I now found myself
perfectly at ease, and the more so from having been so long kept at
hard labour, for which I was but ill adapted. My duty consisted in
measuring the daily portion of ground to the different gangs who
were breaking up, chipping, &amp;c., keeping a daily account of the
various works carried on, mustering the prisoners every Monday
morning, writing passes at the week's end, assisting in the issue
of provisions from the store, <i>&amp;c. &amp;c.</i>; and as these
duties were all perfectly familiar to me I acquitted myself with
credit, and, by observing a proper conduct, gained the good will of
all parties.</p>

<p>Governor King was frequently in the habit of visiting the
settlement, for the purpose of personally inspecting the state of
things, and as he had received favourable accounts of my general
conduct, he began about this time to notice me in a manner that
shewed (I thought,) an inclination to restore me to his wonted
favour. But as I had now little more than a year of my time
unexpired, and was tolerably comfortable in my new situation, I had
so far reconciled myself, that I was but little anxious about a
removal, until the hour of my freedom arrived. However, it was
destined otherwise, and I underwent another very unexpected change
of fortune. In the beginning of August 1806, I was suddenly
summoned by a special messenger, to attend on the Reverend Mr.
Marsden, the chief magistrate of Parramatta. I immediately obeyed
this summons, of the cause of which I could form no conjecture. On
my arrival at the court-house, Mr. Marsden informed me, that he had
sent for me to assist him in taking a muster of the inhabitants of
Parramatta, and the surrounding districts, which was to commence
that very day, and to form part of a general muster throughout the
colony, at this period in progress. I felt myself a little
flattered by this distinction, as Mr. Marsden had already a cleric,
but it seems he was not sufficiently quick, and it was known that I
had before frequently officiated on similar occasions. I assured
Mr. Marsden that I would with pleasure undertake the task, and at
the appointed hour we proceeded to business. The muster occupied
two whole days, and, being ended, Mr. Marsden told me that his
clerk, having received a free pardon from Governor King, was about
to quit the colony in a few days, and that it was his intention to
appoint me his successor, promising, if I behaved well, to shew me
every indulgence in his power. He then desired I would go back to
Castle-hill, for the purpose of arranging my affairs, and return as
soon as possible to Parramatta. I lost no time in obeying these
orders, and the following day again presented myself to Mr.
Marsden. I was immediately put in possession of the court-house, a
comfortable brick building, surrounded by a good garden, which was
to be my place of residence. I was allowed a government servant,
and also on old man as house-keeper: the latter being equal to any
little services I wanted, I was enabled to permit the former to
work for his own living, allowing me a weekly sum for the
indulgence, according to the custom of the colony, and as he had
hitherto done to my predecessor. In addition to this privilege, I
was allowed various fees in the course of my public duties,
agreeably to a code or table sanctioned by the magistrates, so that
upon the whole my income was sufficient to support me in a manner
becoming the respectability of my appointment. Mr. Marsden and his
colleague in the commission. Captain Abbot, were accustomed to
preside as a bench of magistrates every Saturday, and sometimes
alternately on other days in each week. On these occasions it was
my duty to take depositions, write out warrants, commitments,
<i>&amp;c. &amp;c.</i> I had besides to keep a general account of
all public work in Parramatta, compiled from the reports of the
different overseers, &amp;c. In this situation, my knowledge of the
law, and my acquaintance with Burn's Justice proved of the utmost
advantage, as there were many cases constantly occurring, in which
certain formalities (dispensed with before my appointment) gave an
official aspect to the proceedings of the court, and added a
solemnity productive of the best effects. Upon the whole I found
myself very comfortably situated, and I had the pleasure to observe
that my exertions to acquit myself in the most becoming manner,
procured me the consideration such a conduct merited, from the
gentlemen under whom I acted.</p>

<p>In the month of October following my removal to Parramatta, the
departure of Governor King for England; in His Majesty's Ship
<i>Buffalo</i>, was publicly announced to take place in the ensuing
month, his Excellency's successor, Governor Bligh, having arrived
in the preceding August, on the 13th of which month the latter
assumed the supreme command. Since the period of his supersession,
Governor King had principally resided at Parramatta, and I was
frequently employed by him in arranging his private accounts,
transcribing directions to his agents respecting his farms,
live-stock, &amp;c., and various other matters. On these occasions
he treated me with the greatest politeness, and appeared to have
quite forgot my former delinquencies. One day Mr. Marsden
questioned me as to the length of time I had to serve, and on my
answering eleven months, he distantly hinted that if he could
depend on my future good conduct, he was not without hopes of
prevailing on Governor King to procure a remission of my remaining
term, and allow me a passage to England in his own ship; adding,
that himself and family were about proceeding to Europe by the same
opportunity. This being an event of which I had never entertained
the slightest hope, my joyful emotions at the bare idea, could only
be equalled by my surprise at such an intimation. It immediately
struck me that the latter was the result of preconcertion between
Governor King and Mr. Marsden, and that it was at the bottom, his
Excellency's wish to render me this essential service.</p>

<p>The sequel proved that my conjectures were not unfounded, for it
afterwards appeared that Governor King having an incredible number
of public documents lying in a state of great confusion, and most
of which he wanted copied prior to delivering them up, it was
indispensably necessary that he should have an expeditious and
experienced clerk, to transcribe and arrange such papers, during
his voyage home; and it seems he knew of no person more eligible
for such an employment than myself. I replied to Mr. Marsden, with
a warmth and earnestness which convinced him how happy such an
arrangement would make me, and assured him of my everlasting
gratitude towards himself and the late Governor for their
consideration; earnestly pressing Mr. Marsden to a speedy
"consummation" of what I so "devoutly wished." The anxiety of mind
produced in me by this conversation may be conceived by the reader,
if he reflects upon the situation in which I was then placed; for,
though it was my chief and ardent wish to return to my native land
as soon as I became free, yet as I had no apparent prospect of
realizing money enough to pay my passage, and the hardships
incidental to working for it, would expose me to the most trying
severities, such an opportunity as the one I now contemplated,
could not be too highly appreciated, or too eagerly embraced.</p>

<h2><a name="ch117" id="ch117"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p><i>The "Buffalo" being ready for Sea, I receive an Intimation
from Mr. Marsden, that the late Governor has obtained a Remission
of my unexpired Time, and consents to take me home as his
Clerk.&mdash;I wait on his Excellency accordingly, and receive
orders to go on board.&mdash;We set sail.</i>
</p>

<p>THE process of fitting out and victualling the <i>Buffalo</i>,
with other causes, delayed the Governor's departure for some weeks
after the appointed time. At length I received, about the first of
February, in a note from Mr. Marsden, (who with his family, had
removed to Sydney, in readiness for embarkation,) the agreeable
tidings that Governor King had consented to take me on board the
<i>Buffalo</i>, in the capacity of his private clerk, and had
obtained the sanction of Governor Bligh for my departure from the
colony. Mr. Marsden concluded with advising me to wait on Governor
King without delay, for the purpose of receiving his commands. I
immediately hastened to Sydney, and waited on his Excellency, who
after some conversation, told me that the <i>Buffalo's</i>
complement being already full, it was not in his power to put me on
the ship's books[*], but that he would give me a passage, and
himself supply me with provisions. He then inquired if I was
incumbered with any debts; and, on my answering that I owed to
individuals about twenty pounds, and to Government, for various
articles from the stores, about fifteen pounds, his Excellency
advised me to take measures for settling these accompts, and,
having so done, to repair on board with the least possible
delay.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Governor King was a post-captain in the
navy, and principal commander of the <i>Buffalo</i>, having a
second (acting) captain under him. The <i>Buffalo</i> had been
stationed in N.S.W. ever since the year 1803, and was now relieved
by the <i>Porpoise</i>, in which ship Governor Bligh arrived.]</p>
]

<p>I now returned to Parramatta, (having first given the usual
notice of my departure for publication in the Sydney Gazette,) and
applied with diligence to the settlement of my affairs. I was not
displeased at the Governor's intimation respecting not putting me
on the <i>Buffalo's</i> books, because, had he so done, it being
war time, I might have found a difficulty in getting clear of her
on our arrival in England: on the other hand, by going home as a
passenger, although I should forego the advantage of pay, for the
time occupied in our voyage, yet I should be at liberty to quit the
ship the moment we anchored. I was not altogether so easy with
respect to my debts, as I feared my utmost means, were inadequate
to their liquidation. 'Tis true, I had a watch, some good clothes,
and other effects, which altogether might suffice to discharge my
private debts, but then I should much distress myself by the
deprival of these useful articles. As to my Government debt, I had
a secret hope that the generosity of Governor King (which was often
conspicuous when his privy purse was not encroached upon,) would
induce him to assist me in surmounting that difficulty.</p>

<p>I lost not a moment in settling my business at Parramatta, and
returning to Sydney with all my worldly goods, I waited on my
principal creditor, with whom I managed to square the yards on
tolerably easy terms. I was obliged, however, to dispose of nearly
all my personal effects, before I could satisfy the private demands
upon me, retaining only a very limited stock of indispensable
articles for my voyage, and one genteel suit of clothes for the
purpose of attiring myself on quitting the ship, together with an
English half-guinea to bear my expenses from Portsmouth to London.
Having taken these measures, I embarked with my chest and bedding
on the 5th of February, Governor King and Mr. Marsden with their
respective families, being already on board. His Excellency hearing
of my arrival, sent for me to his cabin, and questioned me on the
subject of my debts. I informed him, that I had discharged every
claim upon me, except the sum I owed to the Crown, and confessed my
inability to liquidate that account, without some extension of his
Excellency's kind assistance. The Governor after some moments'
reflection, wrote a short memorandum, which he ordered me to take
to Mr. Commissary Palmer, to whom it was addressed. I accordingly
went on shore, and proceeding to the Commissary's office, delivered
the note, which Mr. Palmer having read, handed to one of his
clerks, directing him to comply with the tenor of it, which was to
the following effect:&mdash;"James Vaux (the bearer) having behaved
well in the different situations of store-keeper's, secretary's,
and magistrate's clerk, I think the small sum he stands indebted to
Government ought to be remitted him." (Signed) "P.G.K." The clerk
having turned to my account in the ledger, gave me credit therein,
to the amount of my debt, by an item worded as follows:&mdash;"By
remuneration for services as clerk, &amp;c." This point being
adjusted, I now found myself perfectly disembarrassed, and free to
depart the country. With a joyful heart, I took leave of my old
acquaintances and fellow-clerks, with some of whom I spent a
convivial evening, and the next day I finally embarked, all things
being now in readiness, and the ship only waiting the auspicious
breeze. On the 10th of February, 1807, was the happy day. At an
early hour the ship was crowded with visiters, comprising most of
the principal officers of the colony, with their ladies and
friends, as well as many respectable inhabitants, all anxious to
testify their heartfelt respect towards a departing Governor, whose
general conduct had gained him universal esteem, and who had,
during a government of six years, united the tenderness of a parent
with the authority of a chief. The vessel was surrounded with
boats, some of which brought various friends of the ship's company,
passengers, &amp;c., who came to take a last farewell; others
contained spectators of both sexes, attracted by curiosity to
witness the interesting scene, as well as to shew their loyalty and
good wishes by joining in the parting cheers; with which the air
rebounded as we cleared the heads of the harbour, to which distance
most of the boats accompanied us. About three o'clock P. M. the
breeze freshening, we quickly gained a good offing, and by half
past four a sudden squall, attended with rain and mist, obscured
from us all view of the land, which we beheld no more.</p>

</p>

<p>THE morning after our sailing, Captain King, (as I shall in
future style him,) called me into his cabin, and presented me with
a free pardon, which, as he rightly observed, was merely a matter
of form, as it was probable we should not arrive in England before
the expiration of my time. This instrument, though only made out a
few days before, was antedated the 12th of August, 1806, being the
day before Governor Bligh assumed the command, and was consequently
the last official document, to which Governor King had affixed his
signature, and the last public act of his government.</p>

<p>In about a week, we made the island of New Zealand, at which it
was captain King's intention to have touched, having some live
pigs, brought from Port Jackson, for the purpose of presenting to
the native chiefs, two of whom had lately visited, and resided for
some months in New South Wales; but this kind idea was frustrated
by a squall of wind, which took us aback while in sight of the
island, and night coming on, it was not considered prudent to
approach the land; we therefore hauled our wind, and shaped our
course to the southward.</p>

<p>Captain King had given orders to the ship's steward, that I
should receive his (Captain King's) own ration of provisions, on
which I was to subsist as well as I could. This quota (according to
the usual allowance of the navy,) would, have been amply
sufficient, but by some unaccountable want of management, the
<i>Buffalo</i>, notwithstanding the length of time occupied in
preparation, was at last sent to sea with a very limited supply of
provisions; nor was what she really had of the kind or quality
invariably allowed in the King's service; the consequence was, that
on the very day of our sailing, all hands were put upon
half-allowance of bread, (that is, half a pound per day,) and the
other half of rice: this latter grain was also substituted on
banyan days for pease and for oatmeal: of cheese and butter we were
also destitute; so that we had not a prospect of much good living
before us. Of the rice, the crew soon became so much tired, that
they ceased to draw any from the purser, leaving it in his hands,
to be compensated for at the end of our voyage. The salt-meat was
also barely adequate to the computed length of our passage to Rio
de Janeiro, the first port at which we could hope for a further
supply. The reader will allow that half a pound of bread was little
enough for a man's daily ration, (being just two biscuits) but ere
we had been six weeks at sea, it was found necessary to reduce the
allowance to one-third of a pound; and, in a few weeks more, it was
lowered to one quarter, that is, a biscuit a day! The necessity of
these reductions arose from a discovery that the rats, cockroaches,
and other vermin, with which the ship was infested, had made a most
destructive devastation in the bread-room, besides which, a leak in
the side had admitted so much salt-water, that a great many bags of
biscuit were totally spoiled, thereby adding to our distress, which
was before sufficiently great. Even the small portion of bread we
did receive, was scarcely eatable, most of it being very old
stores, and full of maggots, and what was baked in the colony being
of a very coarse quality, and every biscuit more or less excavated
by the vermin before-mentioned. The <i>Buffalo</i>, as I have
before shewn, was detained several months, for the purpose of being
properly victualled, and after all, the purser had been obliged to
take a quantity of wheat in casks, for consumption in some shape or
other, as it was found inexpedient to wait longer for a further
supply of biscuit. This wheat, when the crew were tired of rice,
was boiled in lieu of pease, and served out at dinner-time, but it
was so unpalatable a mess, that I, among many others, could never
stomach it, being thrown into the coppers, dust and all, boiled in
stinking water, and when taken up, it was nearly as hard as when
first put in, and much inferior to the food of pigs in England. The
ship's company at length were convinced of their folly, in
suffering such a mode of cookery, or rather waste, for very few
could eat it; and, there being luckily a steel-mill on board, it
was ordered to be put up in the after gun-room, and every mess in
the ship, in its turn, ground the next day's portion of wheat over
night, and sifting the meal, produced a bag of tolerable flour, of
which the cook composed a certain food for breakfast, known among
sailors by the name of <i>skilligolee</i>, being, in plain English,
paste, similar to that used by the sons of Crispins only not quite
of so thick a consistence: however, it was much preferable to the
hog-wash before-mentioned, and, with a little sugar, served as an
apology for a meal.</p>

<p>I have before observed, that I drew Captain King's ration of
provisions, but he withheld the daily allowance of spirits, forming
part of the said ration, which he himself received, and deposited
in his private liquor-case. It is, however, probable that his lady,
who was a rigid economist, was the suggester of this practice. By
way of composition, this good lady gave directions that I should
receive a dram every day from her own steward. This trifling
indulgence by the by, was not ordered me, until the severity of the
climate compelled me to give a hint on the subject, and after about
three week's continuance it was put a stop to, on pretence of the
stock becoming low. Upon the whole, I suffered a great deal from
the scantiness, as well as the quality of my allowance, and the
want of certain comforts to which I had been accustomed,
particularly during the severe weather which we encountered in our
voyage round Cape Horn. It soon appeared that I was not to eat the
bread of idleness; I was employed from morning till night in
copying and arranging Captain King's papers, of which he had
several large trunks full. I had also the tuition of his daughter
Miss King, who was about twelve years of age, and performed the
same duty towards Mr. Marsden's two children, as well as a native
boy about fourteen, who had been brought up in the family of Mr.
Marsden. This youth had received the rudiments of a good education,
and discovered a most susceptible genius. He could read and write
tolerably well, was perfectly docile, and well behaved, and would
doubtless have been an object of general admiration, and reflected
the highest credit on his humane benefactors had he ever reached
England, but unhappily during our stay at Rio Janeiro, he absconded
from the house of his protectors, in consequence of some
chastisement for misconduct, and, notwithstanding every exertion
was used, he could not be recovered before the ship's
departure.</p>

<p>To add to our sufferings from the dearth of provisions, we had
not been a month at sea, before the ship was discovered to be in a
very leaky state, and these leaks increased so rapidly, that she at
length made above five feet water in the well, every four
hours.</p>

<p>As we approached the higher latitudes, the climate, became every
day more intensely cold, and we had continual tempestuous gales for
several weeks, but fortunately they were from the right quarter, so
that we were in general before the wind, and, considering that our
ship was a very heavy sailer, made a pretty rapid progress.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March, having reached a certain degree of
longitude, I witnessed the remarkable circumstance of gaining a
day, the consequence of circumnavigating the globe. The effect was,
that the following day, as well as this, was called in the ship's
log, the 10th of March, so that we had actually two Tuesdays in one
week! This was a favourable circumstance in one respect to myself
and the ship's company, for as Tuesday is a sumptuous day in point
of allowance in the navy, beef and pudding being the prescribed
fare for dinner, we by this accident feasted two days together;
whereas had it occurred on a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, two
successive banyan (or starvation) days would have been our dismal
portion. On our arrival in England our account of time after this
alteration, corresponded exactly with the almanack for the
year.</p>

<p>On the 15th of March, we rounded Cape Horn, passing within five
miles of that inhospitable shore. This point of the American
continent, is situated in fifty-six degrees of south latitude, and
had we passed it in the winter season, instead of the autumn, the
cold would have been hardly bearable; as it was, it had the effect
of destroying almost every natural production of New South Wales,
with some very fine specimens of which our ship was at first
literally crowded, so as to resemble Noah's Ark. There were
kangaroos, black swans, a noble emu, and cockatoos, parrots, and
smaller birds without number; all of which, except one cockatoo,
which was carefully nursed by its mistress, and half a dozen swans,
fell victims to the severity of the weather. The latter birds,
indeed, being natives of Van Diemen's Land, which is a colder
climate than Port Jackson, were of a hardy nature, and survived our
long and tedious voyage. On their arrival in England, they were
sent by Captain King as a present to the Royal Menagerie in
Kew-gardens.</p>

<p>In our passage round Cape Horn, we had frequent storms of snow;
a native of New Zealand, who had been for some time on board the
<i>Buffalo</i>, and was a very active intelligent fellow, expressed
the utmost surprise on observing a phenomenon, which in the happy
clime of his nativity is never experienced, and in the first
emotions of his admiration, exclaimed, "Look, look, white rain,
white rain!" This man would have been an object of curiosity in
England, for he had a very handsome person, and was punctured or
tattooed in a most fanciful and extraordinary manner from head to
foot, including his face, which was covered with ornamental
devices; but unhappily he contracted the small-pox, which,
notwithstanding all possible attention, carried him off before we
arrived at the Brazils.</p>

<p>I must not omit a remarkable and awful phenomenon, which
occurred during this part of our passage. In the middle of a
tempestuous night, a sudden concussion was heard, resembling the
report of a cannon close to us; it alarmed three parts of the
people who were below asleep, as well as the watch on deck; and the
general opinion was at first, that a ship was close aboard us.
Every one hurried upon deck, when the cause was found to have been,
what is called a Fire-ball, which had been probably attracted by
the spindle at the mast-head, for it made a rapid descent down the
main-mast, exploded at the break of the quarter-deck; the
concussion had knocked down a qnarter-master who stood near the
binnacle, and two men who were at the wheel. The former was for
some minutes insensible, but happily they were no further injured
than by the fright. Captain King was instantly on deck with his
usual promptness, and fearing the effects of the fire, gave orders
to cover the magazine-scuttle with wet-swabs; then to sound the
pump-well for some were in dread of the ball having gone through
the ship's bottom; however, it appeared the ship made only the
usual quantity of water, and that no real injury was sustained.
Another night, as we were scudding before a heavy gale of wind, and
a tremendous sea rolling after us, we had the misfortune to be
pooped, as the phrase is, by a wave or sea striking our stern,
which stove in the cabin-windows, and rushing impetuously through
the cabin, and along the main-deck, bore down all before it.
Luckily no further damage was done than breaking the windows, which
rendered it necessary to put up the dead-lights during the
remainder of the passage.</p>

<p>When within a day or two's sail of the River Plate, as we were
running down the coast of Brazil, we fell in with a frigate, which,
on hailing, we found to be His Majesty's ship Thisbe, bound to
Buenos Ayres, having on board, General Whitelocke and his staff.
This officer was going to conduct the attack upon the city above
mentioned, as well as upon Monte Video, both belonging to the
Spaniards. A formidable expedition had been fitted out in England
for the service, and a numerous army was already collected in the
River Plate, waiting the arrival of General Whitelocke. Captain
King complimented this officer with a visit on board the Thisbe,
which the latter returned. On arriving abreast of the River Plate,
the Thisbe parted from us, steering for the entrance of that river,
and we continued our course along-shore. In a few days we came in
sight of Rio de Janeiro, but were becalmed for two days in sight of
the port. At length, on the 22d of May, we entered that beautiful
harbour, after a most hazardous and blowing passage of fifteen
weeks. It was remarkable that on the day before we got in, the last
biscuit was issued to the ship's company, and the last cask of
salt-meat we possessed, was broached; so that had our passage been
longer protracted, we must have endured still greater
privations.</p>

acquaintance with a Portuguese Family.&mdash;Their Affection for
me.&mdash;Overtures made to induce my Stay in South
America:&mdash;The Ship being repaired and victualled, we re-embark
and sail for Europe.</i>
</p>

<p>ON coming to an anchor in the usual situation, we were boarded
by several persons of distinction, accompanied by an intelligent
gentleman as interpreter; after a conference between whom and
Captain King, it was determined that the latter should without
delay address an official letter to the Viceroy, stating the causes
of his putting into that port, the nature of his wants, and other
particulars. Captain King accordingly sketched a draught, which I
was employed to transcribe. This letter explained to his Excellency
(the Viceroy) the leaky and disabled state of His Majesty's ship;
her want of provisions and water, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and concluded
with expressing Captain King's willingness to compliment the
Portuguese flag, by firing a salute of fifteen guns, provided the
Viceroy would pledge himself to return an equal number. It is to be
observed, that among the Portuguese, every thing is conducted with
the utmost formality; and as they are highly jealous of foreigners,
Captain King (whose experience was very great in such matters) was
particularly cautious not to give any cause of offence, or to fail
in due respect; at the same time that he was determined to support
the honour of his own nation, by stipulating for an equal
interchange of ceremony, conformable to the etiquette of the
service. No foreign vessels are suffered to proceed beyond a
certain distance within the harbour, without special permission.
One object of request in the letter was therefore, that the
<i>Buffalo</i> might be allowed to anchor above the Island of
Cobres, (or Snake Island) where she could have the benefit of
smooth water to undergo the necessary repairs. Other objects were,
to be furnished with shipwrights, caulkers, &amp;c., to have a new
rudder (our own being sprung) prepared in the dock-yard, as also a
new boltsprit from the same cause, permission to land and house the
rigging and other stores in convenient receptacles; a daily supply
of fresh meat, vegetables, &amp;c., and several other similar
demands. To this letter a most gracious answer was returned,
assuring Captain King of the fullest compliance with his
requisitions, and expressing every sentiment of friendship for the
English nation, and of respect for his person. His Excellency's
letter concluded with the usual compliment of the Portuguese "God
preserve your Excellency many years." At the same time was
transmitted a long table of rules and ceremonies, to be observed by
our ship's company, &amp;c. These rules were promulgated by Captain
King, who ordered the strictest attention to be paid thereto. They
related to the times and places of landing from boats; the
behaviour of the English when on shore; respect to be paid to the
Catholic religion and its ministers, &amp;c. &amp;c. Among other
injunctions it was expected that every Englishman on passing a
church should move his hat, and pay the same compliment to the
Image of the Virgin Mary, which you encounter at the corner of
every principal street, enclosed in a sort of cupboard with a
glass-door, and silk-curtains drawn open on each side. These
cupboards are affixed to the wall, on a level with the first-floor
windows of the house, and at night a lamp is kept burning over
them, which has a very pretty effect. It was also required that
every person, on meeting the Host (which is a grand procession of
priests, friars, &amp;c., followed by an immense rabble) should
bend on one knee, and so remain till the procession was past. The
priests, on this occasion, carry gold or silver images of our
Saviour and the saints, accompanied with musical instruments,
flags, numerous lighted flambeaus, and every other device to render
the scene at once grand, solemn, and impressive. In fact, I
witnessed various processions of a religious nature during my stay
here, scarcely a night passing without one or more; but it is
foreign to my purpose, to enter into more minute details. It being
the first Catholic country I was ever in, I was struck with
admiration at the grandeur of the churches, the nightly exhibitions
of fire-works, illuminations, ringing of bells, and other
demonstrations of religious respect, or what we should call
superstition. But I am of opinion there is much policy in carrying
these rites to such an extravagant pitch, for the population of
this city being composed of negroes, in the proportion, I take it,
of at least nineteen to one white, and the majority of the former
being slaves, the splendour and enchanting effects of music,
paintings, fire-works, processions, and other devices, together
with the implicit devotion in which they are brought up to the
Catholic religion, keep their minds in a continual state of
resigned subjection, amuse their senses, and leave neither time,
nor inducement to attempt, by acts of rebellion, a release from
their habitual bondage.</p>

<p>To resume my narrative: all preliminaries being settled to the
satisfaction of both. parties. Captain King, a few days after our
arrival, hired a commodious and handsome house, ready-furnished, in
a pleasant part of the town, to which he with his whole family
removed. I, of course, accompanied them, highly delighted at the
prospect of viewing this beautiful city, and observing the manners
and customs of its inhabitants, from which I anticipated the
greatest gratification. Mr. Marsden and his family, also occupied a
genteel house, and in fact, all the passengers (of whom we had a
good number) quitted the ship, which was intended to undergo a
thorough repair.</p>

<p>During our residence ashore, I had much leisure time, which I
employed in walking throughout the city and suburbs, viewing the
churches, convents, and other objects deserving of notice ; and I
endeavoured to acquire, by every means opportunity offered, some
little knowledge of the Portuguese language. As the latter bears a
great affinity to the Latin and French, I succeeded beyond my hopes
in this object, by virtue of which I was enabled to extend my
inquiries, and to interchange personal civilities with many of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the street in which we resided, I had frequently observed an
old lady, together with three young ones, sitting at the door of a
genteel-looking house, employed, according to their custom, in
weaving lace, with a number of bobbins, and a cushion placed before
them. This employment serves both as an amusement, and a source of
profit to the younger branches of families.&mdash;They were seated
cross-legged on the floor of the parlour, the door of which,
(composed of lattice-work) was open for the benefit of air. In the
evenings I generally, saw them seated in the same manner, in
conversation, the old lady turning over her beads, of which a
string, or rosary, with a cross suspended to the end of it, was
hung upon her wrist, and appeared to receive her devout attention.
Having repeatedly passed this interesting group, and fancying that
they noticed me with some emotion, I ventured to compliment them
<i>en pasant</i>, which courtesy they returned with evident
pleasure; and every succeeding salutation produced a longer
dialogue than the preceding; till at length the old lady one
evening invited me to eater, and sit down; but not on the floor,
for they had chairs, as well as other furniture, of an elegant but
simple kind. These good ladies put several questions to me
respecting the English Governor (as they styled him) my situation
in his family, name, &amp;c. I informed them, as fully as I could
find words for; and telling them my name in Portuguese, they ever
afterwards called me Senor Jacobe, it not being their custom to use
surnames. I had the pleasure to find that we understood each other
tolerably well, and gathered from them, that the old lady was
called Senora Donna Joaquima Roza de Lacè; (as the Vicar of
Wakefield says, I love to give the name at full length;) she was
the widow of a military officer in the Portuguese service, and
enjoyed a pension from the government, upon which, and the earnings
of her accomplished daughters, she lived in a private, but genteel
manner: the latter were named Donna Anna Precioza, Donna Joaquima,
and Donna Joanina. The mother was a most agreeable woman, courteous
and affable to a degree, but seemingly a strong devotee to her
religion. The daughters were beautiful girls, evidently of a
susceptible disposition; but, like the Portugueze in general, very
reserved, and tenacious of their sex's dignity. They pressed me to
partake of some coffee, which was served in with much ceremony by a
female negro; and after two or three hours most agreeably spent, I
took leave, with an earnest injunction to repeat my visit.</p>

<p>From this time hardly a day passed without my calling on this
worthy family, and at every visit we parted with a stronger regard
for each other. I felt a growing sentiment in favour of the eldest
daughter (Anna,) and I ingratiated myself with the mother, by
warmly praising the Catholic religion, shewing my respect by
kissing the cross attached to her beads, and every other means in
my power. In a few days I became, as it were, one of the family,
visiting them at all hours, and experiencing the kindest welcome.
The ladies took a pleasure in improving my knowledge in their
language, and in return requested me to teach them my own. At this
period there were very few English persons in the Brazils; but the
inhabitants, in general, evinced the greatest fondness for our
nation; so that not the meanest of our ship's company could walk
the streets without being gratified with hearing the exclamation of
"Sta bon Inglise," (very good Englishman,) from the mouths of
passengers, both men, women, and children. Myself and other
persons, whose appearance was at all respectable, were also very
courteously saluted by the females, who stand for hours peeping
through the lattice-windows of the houses, which are half opened,
so as to give them a view, and although most of these diffident
ladies close the lattice and retire with precipitation, on the
approach of a male stranger, yet many of them suffered me to hold a
conversation for a few minutes; and I sometimes prevailed so far as
to obtain one of their fair hands to kiss, a mark of great favour
and condescension, even to their common acquaintances.</p>

<p>Captain King received every possible mark of respect both public
and private, during his residence in this city. Whenever he
appeared abroad in an open chaise, (which he hired by the month,)
or on horseback, the military-guard at every public post which he
passed, were turned out to pay him the same honours as are usually
rendered to the viceroy himself. The latter officer also shewed him
every attention, frequently exchanging visits with him, lending him
his own horses for a ride, &amp;c. Most of the principal
inhabitants paid their respects to Mrs. King, and invited her to
various public and private entertainments. The Portuguese excel in
music, particularly the violin and bass-viol; and there were
frequently large parties of amateurs at our house, who formed a
most delightful evening concert. This is, in fact, the custom of
all people of fashion there, who, instead of meeting for the
purpose of gaming as in London, adopt this much more laudable and
rational mode of amusement.</p>

<p>I observed, as I traversed the city, that a number of bonfires
were lighted in various streets, as soon as it grew dusk, almost
every evening, which were surrounded by children, negroes, and
others, rejoicing until a late hour. As these fires were never
twice in the same spot, I was at a loss to understand their
meaning, until I at length ascertained that they were in
celebration of the birth-days of children. The custom of observing
such days differs, however, from our own country; for instead of
taking place on the anniversary of the child's nativity, the
observation is confined to the festival of that particular Saint
after whom the child is named; for instance, on St. Anna's day, all
persons who have a daughter called Anna, celebrate the same by
regaling their friends, and having a bonfire before their door. As
almost every day in the year is dedicated to a male or female
saint, whose name is borne by some hundreds of children, these
bonfires are, of course, frequent and numerous. The effect of them
is both lively and gratifying, especially to those who know their
cause; but many of the streets being extremely narrow, and some of
the fires very large, I have been frequently much embarrassed to
effect a passage, in which attempt I was sometimes in danger of
being scorched by the intense heat reflected from the stone walls
of which the houses, are composed.</p>

<p>Another object of my attention was the slave-market, which is
held on the arrival of a Guinea ship, in the suburbs of the city.
These unfortunate beings are chained together, and driven to the
scene of this disgraceful traffic, where they are sold like cattle
or sheep in Smithfield. A healthy youth of about fifteen will
produce from about thirty to fifty pounds, this being considered
the most advantageous age at which a slave can be purchased. The
condition of this unhappy class of persons is, however, much more
tolerable in this city than a stranger would suppose. Most of the
inhabitants possess a male or female, (some several,) exclusive of
those employed in household affairs. These superfluous slaves are
sent out in a morning to ply for hire on their owner's account, and
obtain as much as they can by their labour; the majority of the
women confine themselves to carrying water from the fountains,
which they cry as the venders of milk do in London; and on being
hailed, they stop and empty their vessel, for which they receive a
vintain, (about three halfpence;) they then return to the nearest
fountain to replenish. I could not help being surprised at the
large size of the vessels in which they carry this water on their
beads; they are a kind of wooden casks, some of them holding at
least ten gallons.</p>

<p>Having mentioned the public fountains, (with which this city
abounds,) it may not be amiss to describe them. There being but few
springs in the town, water is conveyed by means of a noble brick
aqueduct (communicating with others,) from a distance of several
miles through the interior, over the summits of many high hills,
and being distributed throughout the city, it supplies a fountain
in most of the principal streets. These fountains are handsomely
constructed of stone, having a large cistern into which the purest
water is constantly running from the beaks of several ducks, geese,
or other birds, which are of cast metal, and well executed. As the
trade of water-carrying furnishes employment for many hundreds of
negro women, and their continual resort to the fountains would
occasion much confusion and quarrelling, a soldier is placed in
attendance to preserve order, and the women seat themselves in a
row on a long bench fixed on purpose, where they are obliged to
wait for their turn to fill. It is a curious and interesting sight
to observe these harmless and industrious creatures conversing with
each other, and smoking their pipes, while they patiently await the
sentinel's intimation to approach. The incessant prattle of their
tongues may be heard by a passenger long before he reaches the
spot, and adds to the novelty of the scene.</p>

<p>The negroes I saw here, the majority of whom are natives, born
of those imported from Africa, or of their descendants, are upon
the whole the most comely race of blacks I ever met with. The men
wear coarse jackets and trowsers, the women a sort of gown of blue
cloth; but their linen is always remarkably white, of a fine
texture, and beautifully wrought with ornamental work about the
sleeves and bosom. They have also bracelets both on the wrists and
ancles, and ear-rings, all of the purest gold. Both sexes are very
cleanly in their persons, and of a most docile and gentle
disposition.</p>

<p>By the kindness of my worthy friends, the ladies, I obtained
frequent admission to the Opera, (as it is called, though the
pieces I saw appeared to be principally comedies and farces, with
scarcely any vocal music.) As I could not understand the plot, or
dialogue, my chief satisfaction was in contemplating the <i>coup
d'oeil</i>, which was very striking. The house is about the size of
our little theatre in the Haymarket; the pit is solely occupied by
the male sex, but the boxes are filled with beautiful women,
dressed in the most elegant and bewitching manner, and adorned with
brilliant ear-rings, bracelets, &amp;c. The viceroy has an elegant
box in the centre of the front tiers, so as to be immediately
facing the stage, and to be seen by the whole audience. The
performance is never suffered to commence till his arrival, which
is sometimes protracted; and on his Excellency's entrance, the
whole of the spectators rise to testify their respect for his
person. The admission to the pit is only a petack (two shillings.)
The boxes are engaged by parties, at the expense of about twelve
shillings each, whether the party is large or small; and there is
no gallery. The music is excellent and the band numerous.</p>

<p>Were I to attempt a minute description of the magnificent
churches, convents, and other buildings, the numerous processions,
public rejoicings, &amp;c.; the beautiful gardens, romantic walks,
and other objects worthy of the most scrupulous attention, which I
met with in this rich and flourishing city, as well as the various
customs and manners peculiar to its inhabitants, I should swell
this work much beyond the limits I have prescribed; but as I am
inadequate to the task, I shall leave such a subject to some abler
pen; and as I only profess to write an account of my own
adventures, shall resume the thread of my narrative.</p>

<p>I was so much delighted with all I saw, and found the climate so
congenial to my constitution, that I could have been content to
have spent the rest of my life in South America; and hinting as
much to my kind friends, the old lady seriously pressed me to that
measure, assuring me of her protection and interest, together with
that of her friends, who were numerous and respectable. She even
pledged herself to procure me a salary of one doubloon (about
£3.12s.) per month, at the first onset, as clerk in a mercantile
house, which would be increased as I acquired the Portugueze
language. But that longing desire to revisit my native country,
which is predominant in the breast of every Englishman, together
with a wish to see once more my beloved relations to whom I owed so
much, prevailed over every other consideration; and I declined, but
with a proper sense of gratitude, these flattering offers of favour
and service.</p>

<p>Since my departure from Portsmouth, in 1801, I had not heard a
syllable of or from any of my friends in England, and though it was
probable that my dear benefactors in S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; had ere
this period paid the debt of nature, I felt a secret hope that they
might still survive, and that from the favourable situation in
which I stood with Captain King I might, at no very distant period,
find myself enabled to contribute some little assistance towards
rendering the evening of their lives happy. It was my firm
determination never again to swerve from a course of rectitude; and
I had the fullest confidence that the late governor, my patron,
would procure me the means of adhering to so laudable a resolution.
How fatally I was mistaken, how uncertain are the favours of the
great, will be seen in a future chapter.</p>

<p>The <i>Buffalo</i> having been as effectually repaired as
circumstances would admit, and a tolerable supply of provisions
received on board, every preparation was made for prosecuting our
voyage, and a day appointed for skiing. As the latter period
approached, I redoubled my respectful attentions to the worthy
family in the Strada de los Mongares, (or Monkey-street,) and they
every day gave stronger proofs of their concern at my approaching
departure. The day at length arrived, and I waited on them to take
a final leave. On this occasion many tears were shed on their part,
and I confess my sensibility was such that I involuntarily caught
the soft infection. I obtained thee favour of a warm embrace from
them all, and the young ladies condescended to deviate from their
usual strict decorum by suffering me to imprint some ardent kisses
on their charming lips. The mother appeared a little disconcerted
at this indulgence, but her affection for me prevented any
expressions of displeasure; she herself presented me her cheek with
a very good grace. I must here observe, that the Portugueze ladies
do not allow even their lovers, before marriage, a greater license
than kissing the hand; this intimation was given me on my first
acquaintance with Donna Joaquima, by that worthy matron herself,
with a very serious air, as she discovered, I suppose, that I
evinced too much warmth in my attention to her lovely daughters.
After numerous repetitions of "Adieu" on my side, and of "Dios
guarda, mio Amigo," (God preserve you, my friend,) on that of these
amiable females, I was obliged to tear myself abruptly from them;
and with a heart overcharged with grief and tenderness, I hastened
to the boat, which conveyed myself and the few other persons
remaining on shore, to the ship, which was then under weigh, and,
the breeze freshening, we with difficulty got alongside her, when
abreast of Fort Santa Cruz, (near the entrance of the Rio de
Janeiro, and just as the <i>Buffalo</i> was saluting that battery.
In about an hour afterwards, we cleared the Heads; the same evening
(August the 12th 1807,) we lost sight of the coast of Brazil, and
proceeded on our course for Europe.</p>

</p>

<p>HAVING resumed our voyage with a favouring breeze, and the ship
being, to all appearance, tight and sea-worthy, with a pretty ample
supply of wet and dry provisions, our prospects were now a little
more cheering; and I looked forward with innate satisfaction to the
moment when I should set my foot on English ground, free from the
horrors attending a state of bondage, and at liberty to realize the
ideas I had formed of atoning to society, and to my own conscience
for the manifold errors of my past life.</p>

<p>We had, however, the mortification to find that the repairs the
ship had undergone at Rio de Janiero, had only produced a temporary
effect; for shortly after leaving that port, the ship again began
to leak, and in a few days made as much water as before. The
consequence was that all hands, except officers, were obliged to
take their turn at the pumps, and it was only by pumping her out
every watch that she could be kept free. I, of course, took my
spell at this this necessary but fatiguing labour during the day,
without murmuring; but I was not disturbed in the night, which,
indeed, I considered would have been unfair, as I was on duty all
day. The carpenter found, on inspection, that the principal leak
was occasioned by some part of the stem being loose, where there
was a large aperture some feet under water. Every exertion was
made, by lightening her forwards, and applying what is termed a
fothering mat to her bows, to remedy this evil, but without effect;
for the working of the ship occasioned every particle of the
stuffing used on such occasions to wash out immediately. This
expedient, indeed, at first, promised to succeed to admiration, for
it decreased the leak from sixteen to ten inches an hour; but the
experiment was made in a calm, and the first rough weather undid
all that had been done. It was now discovered that certain parts of
the stem, called the fore-hoods, were loose, which occasioned the
principal leak; and this was so far under water, that it was
impossible to repair the defect while the ship was afloat. In fact,
she was altogether in a very decayed state, being an old ship, and
having endured much severe service; so that having now a voyage of
three months before us, and reason to expect bad weather, as we
should approach the English channel in the winter season, those who
were best able to form an opinion entertained serious doubts of the
ship's capability to perform the voyage; however, these doubts were
not suffered to transpire publicly, and every precaution, which the
experience of Captain King and his officers could dictate, was made
use of. The stem, of the vessel, being the most defective part, was
first secured, by passing very strong ropes over her bows, and
under her keel, which were then boused taut athwart the
fore-castle, and there made fast, in order to lash her bows
together; for some fears existed that by the violent working of the
ship in a head sea, her bows would absolutely part asunder! That
she might be strained as little as possible, it was also determined
not to carry a press of sail on the boltsprit when sailing on a
wind. In this manner we continued our course for several weeks,
without any incident worthy of notice; we had upon the whole pretty
favourable winds, but as we approached the equator they were
interrupted by occasional calms.</p>

<p>On the 17th of September, we crossed the equinoctial line, with
the usual ceremonies, in which every officer and passenger
cordially joined, and not a single person (the ladies and Captain
King excepted,) escaped a complete ducking. The weather being
delightfully fine, with a light and favourable breeze, every one
was in high spirits, and the rites of Neptune having been
celebrated in due form, a plentiful allowance of grog succeeded,
which, by wetting the inside, made ample amends for the salt-water
baptism, which all hands had mutually and liberally bestowed on
each other without respect to rank or persons. This was a
remarkable day with me, for on this day my original term of
transportation expired. This event naturally produced a train of
reflections in my mind. I took a retrospect of the miseries and
vicissitudes I had undergone within the last seven years, and I
returned fervent thanks to Heaven for my deliverance from exile,
and for the unlimited freedom which I expected shortly to regain.
But, alas! I was soon to experience another reverse, which, as it
was both unexpected and unmerited, fell with the greater weight
upon me: and thus it happened.</p>

<p>Hitherto, as I have before observed, I was not called upon in
the night to take my spell at the pumps, but a few days after our
crossing the line, by what accident I knew not, I was desired by
the boatswain's mate of the watch, to turn out in the middle of a
wet and windy night, and pump ship. As remonstrance with such a
fellow as this would have availed nothing, I complied; but the next
day took an opportunity of acquainting Captain King, and requested
he would give directions that I should not be disturbed in future.
To my great surprise, however, he informed me, that I had been
called upon by his express orders, and that he was ignorant till
that very night of my being excused from the duty of pumping, but
had taken for granted that I always took my spell. I replied to
this by submitting in the most respectful terms, that as I was
employed in writing, &amp;c., from morning till night, and also
assisted in pumping the ship every watch, it was but fair that I
should sleep every night, as all persons under the denomination of
"Idlers" invariably do in king's ships. Captain King rejoined that
the emergency of the case required every one to assist; that he had
given orders to have no idler or other person excused, and that he
should therefore insist on my compliance. I observed that he grew
warm towards the end of this conference, though I had preserved the
respect due to him, in all I had said; however, as I was conscious
of being in the right, I ventured to hint that the situation in
which I stood, being only a passenger not belonging to the ship,
receiving neither pay nor even the allowance of spirits common to
the meanest cabin-boy in the service, and which was essentially
necessary to support the united hardships of labour and inclement
weather; that all these considerations might, I submitted, entitle
me to some distinction from the class of persons called idlers, who
actually belonged to the ship; and I concluded with an intimation
that the emergency of the case could not be so great as that my
feeble assistance could not be dispensed with, as the ship was
always freed from water with ease in half an hour, and not one of
his (Captain King's,) domestic servants, who were stout able men,
(five or six in number,) and all receiving pay from the ship, were
ever called upon at all in the night, and but rarely in the day.
The justice of my remonstrances appeared to have exasperated
Captain King, who was of a very irascible temper, and he at length
worked himself up into a violent rage, the consequence of which was
(as usual with him,) a torrent of abuse; and as I knew by
experience that it was in vain to attempt pacifying him, when in
this mood, I quitted the cabin, and retired to my birth between
decks. About an hour after, as I was sitting on my chest ruminating
on the unpleasant situation in which I was placed, and heartily
wishing for the moment which was to free me from a state of
dependence, I was accosted by a master's mate, who informed me it
was Captain King's orders that I should do my duty in the larboard
watch of the after-guard, and that I was to be mustered with the
watch at eight o'clock the same night. I now clearly saw the
malevolence of Captain King's designs, and the illiberal advantage
he was about to take of my helpless and dependent situation. I
nevertheless cheerfully obeyed his orders, and that night kept what
is termed the first watch, (from eight to twelve,) two hours of
which I was stationed at the lee-wheel. At twelve o'clock I retired
to my hammock, and was no more interrupted till eight the next
morning, soon after which I was summoned to the cabin of Captain
Houston, the acting commander of the <i>Buffalo</i> under Captain
King, who, on my appearing before him, inquired abruptly, "if I
chose to enter?" I was not surprised at this question, as I had
foreseen in what manner Captain King intended to act, in order to
place me more immediately in his power, and to give him an
authority over me, which as I was before situated he did not
possess. Beings therefore, prepared for such a question, and
knowing the nature of the service, I answered Captain Houston in
the affirmative. The latter then ordered me to attend the captain's
clerk, and get myself duly entered on the ship's books. This I
accordingly did, and now found myself suddenly placed in the
capacity of a common sailor on board a king's ship; and it being
war time, I had before me the disheartening prospect of being
drafted, on our arrival in England, on board some other ship,
(without a probable chance of once setting my foot on shore,) and
of being perhaps immediately ordered abroad to some foreign station
from which I might not return for several years. My motive for
voluntarily entering was this: I was aware that had I refused to do
so it was in the power of Captain King to press me against my will,
and I doubt not but such was his intention. In the latter case I
should have been entered as a pressed man, which might have
operated at a future day against my obtaining leave to go ashore,
and by that means effect my escape; whereas I was now entered as a
volunteer, and became entitled to a small bounty. I am persuaded
the reader will view this conduct of Captain King's in a very
unfavourable light; as I had really been guilty of no crime, it was
taking a most cruel and illiberal advantage of the power he had
over me. Having released me from a state of banishment, and taken
me into his service on the terms he did, without any immediate
compensation, he had of course left me every reason to expect, not
only my liberty at the end of the voyage, but also his future
countenance and protection. Besides, the reader will remember that
he had declined putting me on the ship's books when I first joined
her at Port Jackson, in which case I should have had nine months'
pay to receive on my subsequent arrival in England, and should have
also had a daily allowance of spirits during the passage, for want
of which I had suffered much in the cold climate and severe weather
we encountered; instead of which, and after I had actually become a
freeman by servitude, he had forced me into what may be termed a
second bondage, almost equally irksome with the first, and that too
when within six weeks of the end of our voyage. However, as I am of
opinion with Shakspeare, that</p>

<p class="letter">"Things without remedy should be without
regard."</p>

<p>I bore up with fortitude against this unexpected reverse of
fortune; and, conscious of its feeing unmerited, made no attempt to
avert the blow by mean submission, to which I could not stoop. I
therefore cheerfully took my watch on deck, and, when not so
engaged, amused myself below with a book, or in ruminating (as
usual with me,) on the instability of human affairs, and the
vicissitudes of my own life in particular. It was not the least of
my consolations in this distress, that I received every day at noon
half a pint of excellent rum, with a dram of which I fortified
myself occasionally during the night watches, for as we approached
the channel of Old England, we once more experienced a sudden
change of climate, and the weather became intensely cold.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after the event I have just related. Captain
King, finding I was perfectly reconciled to my new duty, and that I
offered no apology, as he perhaps expected I would, sent for me one
morning, and ordered me to attend in the cabin every day at nine
o'clock, for the purpose of writing as usual. As I did not conceive
myself justified in refusing, I complied, and paid every attention
to his commands. The boatswain's mates, understanding how I was
again employed, desisted from calling me up to pump ship for
several nights; when by some means Captain King hearing of this
fact, actually gave orders that I should regularly turn out as well
as the other idlers. This I considered such a proof of his
determined wish to oppress and harass me, that I ventured a second
remonstrance on the subject; when he again fell into a violent
rage, and cautioned me not to offend him by a repetition of (what
he termed,) my insolence, reminding me that it was now in his power
to flog me, though it was not before!</p>

<p>He concluded with saying, that he left it to my choice either to
write for him during the day, and take my turn at pumping in the
night, or to do my duty before the mast entirely, and keep my watch
in common with the rest of the crew. I made no hesitation in
replying, that, with his permission, I should prefer doing my duty
on deck. To this he assenting, I made my bow and withdrew. Here
ended my functions in the clerical capacity with Captain King. From
this day I never wrote a line for him; and thus was I rewarded for
my past services. To shew the inconsistency of this treatment, I
will just quote a line from the pardon granted me by himself, when
Governor of New South Wales. In documents of this description, it
is indispensably required to state the grounds, or motives, which
induce the Governor to exercise the power vested in him by His
Majesty's instructions. The blank left for that purpose, was thus
filled up, "I, Philip Gidley King, Esquire, Captain general,
<i>&amp;c. &amp;c.</i>, taking into consideration the good conduct
of James Vaux, and to enable him to serve as my clerk on board His
Majesty's ship <i>Buffalo</i>, Do hereby absolutely remit,
&amp;c."</p>

<p>Just before we entered the channel, we had the singular fortune
to fall in a Second time with the Thisbe frigate, in company with
three sail of transports. On speaking, we ascertained that the
latter vessels had on board a part of the army, lately under the
command of General Whitelocke in the Rio de la Plata, and who had
survived the ill-managed and fatal attack upon Buenos Ayres. We
also learnt that the general himself had been put under arrest for
his deficiency and misconduct on that occasion, and was now on his
voyage home to answer for the same. Captain King now represented to
the agent on board one of these transports, the distressed state of
the <i>Buffalo</i>, and requested the aid of some soldiers to
assist in pumping her, as the leaks daily grew more alarming. Forty
privates were accordingly put on board us, and we continued our
voyage in company with the transports, the Thisbe having outsailed
us. About the 5th of November we made the land, which proved the
coast of Cornwall, near Falmouth. We proceeded along shore to the
eastward, and on the 8th came to an anchor at Spithead, (after a
passage of nine months from port Jackson,) in company with two of
the transports, but the third was missing. We had afterwards the
melancholy information that this vessel (the <i>John and
Elizabeth</i>;) had been wrecked during the preceding night, having
struck upon some rocks in consequence of her keeping too near the
shore; and it blowing a fresh gale, she went to pieces, when
upwards of three hundred persons unhappily perished.</p>

</p>

<p>THE anchor was no sooner down, than the cutter was hoisted out,
in which Captain King went ashore and immediately proceeded post to
London. The following day the <i>Buffalo</i> weighed, and sailed
into Portsmouth harbour, where she was lashed alongside a hulk near
the shore, and preparations instantly made for clearing and
dismantling her, preparatory to her survey and expected
condemnation. Those persons who had obtained a passage on various
acounts, and were not on the ship's books, were now permitted to
dis-embark, and depart to their respective homes. I now felt the
full weight of the misery in which I was involved. After an absence
of nearly seven years from my native land, to enjoy once more the
sight of that much-loved spot, and when within a hundred yards of
the shore, to be debarred from a nearer approach, was mortifying in
the extreme, and my situation could only be compared to that of
Tantalus in the Heathen mythology. The purser was now busily intent
Upon making up the <i>Buffalo's</i> books, to be transmitted to the
Navy-office, previous to her being paid, and her crew drafted into
other ships. As these accounts were extensive, and required both
care and expedition; Mr. Sherard, the purser, requested that I
would assist the captain's clerk of the ship in their arrangement,
for which he obtained the sanction of Captain Houston, promising to
reward me for my trouble. I was now excused from all other duty,
and immediately set about the required task with alacrity,
conceiving hopes that I might by this compliance facilitate my
grand object of escaping from the ship. By dint of unremitting
assiduity we completed the whole of the accounts in about a
fortnight, to the satisfaction of the purser, and I had no sooner
acquitted myself of this duty than Captain Houston requested I
would bring up his journal, which was many months in arrear. I
gladly undertook this service, from the same motives as before, and
now wrote from morning till night in the cabin, Captain King and
his family having totally quitted the ship, and taken lodgings in
Portsmouth, as had also Captain Houston and his lady. The latter
officer came on board daily, and was highly pleased at the progress
I made in his journal. Captain King also came on board
occasionally, but did not deign to notice me, and I preserved the
same strangeness towards him.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival, I had written to an aunt in London, for
information respecting my father, and other relations. About this
time I received, in consequence, a letter from my mother, informing
me that my father and grandmother had been deceased about two
years, and that my venerable grandfather was still living at
S&mdash;&mdash; in health and spirits; she added that herself and
my two sisters were residing in Middle-row, Holborn, and should
feel inexpressibly happy at seeing me again. My whole thoughts were
now turned to the object of getting ashore, but the <i>quo modo</i>
was to be considered, and of this I could form no idea. I could not
swim; I had no money to bribe a waterman to fetch me away; and of
gaining my liberty I had little or no hopes. I still continued
assiduous in writing the journal for Captain Houston and I had
reason to build upon some indulgence from the first lieutenant Mr.
Oxley[*], should it rest with him to grant leave of absence, as I
had occasionally written his log, during the voyage, and he had
been pleased to shew me many marks of kindness.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Now Surveyor-General of New South
Wales.]</p>

<p>After the pay-books were completed and sent up to London, I one
day had some conversation with a respectable looking woman, who
attended the ship with a bum-boat, and supplied the sailors with
necessaries on the credit of their approaching pay, which was
considerable, the ship having been six years stationed in New South
Wales. As this woman appeared to possess some sensibility, I
ventured to represent to her the distress I was in at my
confinement to the service, and particularly my fears that I should
not obtain leave to visit my friends before I was sent to sea
again. The good woman, whose name was B&mdash;&mdash;y, had
sufficient penetration to perceive my drift, and that I wanted to
take French leave of an English man-of-war. After expatiating on
the risk she should incur in case of a discovery, and many
injunctions of secrecy, she declared her willingness to assist me
as far as lay in her power, as she had, she said, children of her
own and pitied my situation. She. then advised me to pack up a suit
of clothes, (which I informed her I had by me,) and commit them to
her care, saying, that she would take them privately to her
lodgings, to which she directed me, and that I must next contrive
to get ashore on duty, or by any other means, when I should
immediately come to her, and she would assist me in my further
proceedings.</p>

<p>Having treated this worthy creature with a glass of grog, and
overwhelmed her with thanks for her disinterested kindness, (for
such it certainly was,) I hastened to put up my clothes, consisting
of a genteel black coat, boots, &amp;c., which I had preserved for
the purpose, and on her quitting the ship she concealed these
articles among her merchandise without observation. This took place
on a Thursday, and my only concern now, was to make good my landing
On the following Sunday it was promulgated throughout the ship,
that a certain number of the crew were to be allowed leave to go on
shore in the afternoon. I determined, therefore, to make an effort
and the dinner hour being over, I heard orders given to man the
cutter for the liberty-men. The latter were in the mean time busily
employed in rigging themselves for the occasion, in their best
togs. I, of course, intended to go in my working dress, consisting
of a red flannel shirt, blue jacket, and tarry trowsers, as I
thought the officers would less suspect me of a design to run away.
Full of anxiety but not without hope, I entered the gun-room, in
which were Mr. Oxley, then commanding. officer of the ship, and Mr.
Sherard the purser.</p>

<p>The former inquiring my business, I answered, that I wished,
with his permission, to go on shore for two or three hours, having
a friend in Portsmouth, who I was in hopes would supply me with
some necessaries I stood in need of. Mr. Oxley smiled and
hesitated, remarking the shabbiness of my appearance; at length on
my urging my suit, with a trembling voice, (for no one who has not
been similarly situated, can conceive what I then felt,) he
inquired if he might depend on my returning on board at sun-set in
the ship's boat? I assured him that he might, and he then consented
to my going. Having thanked him from the bottom of my heart, I
quitted the gun-room, but had no sooner closed the door than I was
recalled by Mr. Oxley. Somewhat alarmed lest he should be about to
retract, I returned, and found I was called at the instance of Mr.
Sherard, who, drawing out his purse, presented me with
half-a-guinea! saying, he had promised me something for my late
assistance. I thanked him and again withdrew. I had scarcely shut
the door a second time, when I was again recalled, which still more
surprised and alarmed me. On re-entering, Mr. Oxley said, (but in
what I thought a good-natured way,) "Mind, Mr. Vaux, if you're not
on board by six o'clock, I shall send the marines after you." I
again promised obedience, and once more retired. I then hastened to
inform a friend of my good fortune, and gave him the key of my
chest, desiring him, in case I did not return in the evening, to
take out such articles as he chose, as well as my bedding, &amp;c.,
before they were seized by order of the captain.</p>

<p>On ascending the deck I was again alarmed. The acting master,
who was on the quarter-deck, seeing me about to enter the boat,
called me aft, and inquired where I was going? I answered that Mr.
Oxley had given me leave to go ashore. He replied, "Mr. Oxley, I am
sure, would never give you leave to go ashore in that dirty dress,"
and absolutely forbad my going. It was in vain that I remonstrated,
and referred him to Mr. Oxley; and during the delay occasioned by
this conversation the boat was on the point of departure; when,
luckily, the master turning his back to give some orders, I hastily
descended to the Waist, and leaping through. one of the midship
ports, found myself happily in the cutter, at the moment when the
coxswain gave the word to shove off. I concealed myself in the
foresheets until out of danger, and in bout ten minutes was landed
at Common-Hard. I need not labour to paint the joy I felt at that
moment, though it was certainly mixed with anxiety as to my further
success. I immediately left the other liberty-men, who pressed me
in vain to drink with them; and pleading urgent business, ran with
the utmost expedition along the streets, inquiring for the Point,
where having arrived, I found several ferry-boats ready to cross
over to Gosport. A fellow calling out "over. Sir?" I jumped into
his boat, and in a few minutes found myself on Gosport-beach. Thus
far, I sailed before the wind; I walked up the beach, and the first
object that presented itself was the London stage-coach, standing
at the door of the Red Lion Inn. This novel sight which I had not
beheld for so many years, wad so gratifying that I admired and
examined it for some minutes, as minutely as a countryman would do
the King's state-coach. I soon found on inquiry, the lodgings of
Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;y which were at a public-house near the Red
Lion.</p>

<p>On asking for her of the landlady, I had the mortification to
learn that she was out on board of some ship, and that her return
was uncertain. It was now near four o'clock, and the days being
short, my term of leave would soon expire. However, as there was no
remedy but patience, I entered the tap-room, and calling for a pint
of ale and a pipe, sat down to wait the arrival of my worthy
friend. I had scarcely taken a dozen whiffs when I heard a footstep
in the passage of the house; and my landlady putting out her head,
inquired "Is that you, Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;y?" I had the pleasure
to hear that good woman answer, "Yes." On the landlady informing
her there was a young man waiting for her, she opened the door; and
seeing me, said with a significant look, and evidently much
pleased, "O, is that you, William, step up stairs with me, and I'll
give you those things." I paid for my ale, and followed Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash;, who was accompanied by her husband, and both of
them loaded with goods they had brought from their boat. On
entering their apartment, they expressed much pleasure at my good
luck in getting ashore, and gave me the most cordial welcome. The
old woman put on the tea-kettle, and while it was boiling, she
looked out my clothes, which she set about airing by the fire.
Having obliged me to take a dram, they began to consult on the
measures to be adopted in my favour.</p>

<p>Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y informed me that the coach I had seen would
set out at six o'clock; that the inside fare to London was
twenty-four shillings, and the outside seventeen shillings,
inquiring, which I would prefer, and how I stood for cash. I
answered that I had about twenty-four shillings, (namely the half
guinea I had brought from New South Wales, another which I had
received from the purser, and three or four shillings I had
acquired since our arrival,) but that an outside place would answer
my purpose, and I should then have a trifle for expenses. This
worthy couple assured me I should not be lost for a few shillings,
if I found myself at all deficient; but I declined this favour,
knowing I could make shift with what I had. Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;y
then offered to go himself to the coach-office, and secure me a
place. I accordingly gave him the required sum, and he hastened to
the Red Lion. During his absence Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;y gave me some
warm water to wash myself, which having done, she desired me to put
on all my clothes but my coat; she then put an apron over my
shoulders, and proceeded to dress my hair as well as she could,
and, for want of powder, made use of some flour, with which she
plentifully whitened my head. Having put on my coat, she next threw
some flour over my back, and taking a view of me, me, declared she
never saw so great an alteration in a man. She complimented me upon
my genteel appearance, and added, that she was sure if I was met by
any of my own officers, they would not know me in this garb.</p>

<p>Her husband now returning, informed me that he had taken a place
for me in the name of Lowe, as I directed, and had told the
coachman to take me up at the Dolphin Inn, near the extremity of
the town. Every thing being now arranged, I anxiously wished for
the hour of six; and though I had not the least grounds for fear,
yet I could not wholly divest myself of it. It is true, as I had
landed at Portsmouth, it was not likely, in case there was any
suspicion, that a search would be set afoot in Gosport, which is on
the opposite side of the harbour; besides, no inquiry was likely to
be made for me, till after six o'clock, at which hour the coach
would set off. Having taken a dish of tea, and the time
approaching, I took an affectionate leave of the good woman,
promising to write to her on my arrival in town, and at a future
day to reward her kindness. The old man insisted on accompanying me
to the Dolphin, and seeing me safe off.</p>

<p>The weather being intensely cold, they would have pressed me to
accept a greatcoat, but I refused to trespass further on their
goodness. At length we departed, and walked without interruption to
the Dolphin; but I trembled at the approach of every officer or
genteel person we met, so great was my fear of miscarriage on this
important occasion. Having some minutes to wait for the coach, Mr.
B&mdash;&mdash; insisted on my drinking a parting glass at the bar
of an adjacent public-house, which having done, we heard the joyful
sound of the horn, and the rattling of the coach-wheels. In a few
minutes I ascended the vehicle, and as it drove off, I saw my
worthy old friend waving his hand at the corner of the street,
apparently as much affected as myself on the occasion. Having thus
described my escape from a state of thraldom, in which I might
otherwise have suffered much vexation and hardship, I shall here
conclude the twenty-first chapter of my Memoirs.</p>

</p>

<p>ABOUT four miles from Gosport, is a place called Fareham, where
is a gate, through which on the coach passing, I had always
understood that the passengers were subject to an overhaul, as the
sailors term it. I was, therefore, somewhat alarmed during this
part of my journey. I felt confident, however that I could give a
good account of myself, had I been questioned; but to my great joy,
on our approach, the gate was thrown open, and the coach passed
without stopping. I now felt extremely cold, and my dress being
thin, I suffered much during the night. In order to counteract the
effects of the frost, I fortified myself with a good dram of brandy
at every stage, and the ensuing morning proving delightfully fine,
I at length found both my animal and mental spirits revive, and my
heart beat high with expectation of the happiness I anticipated.
About eight o'clock I was gratified with a sight of Hyde Park
Corner; and I leave the reader to imagine what transports I felt at
the difference between my then situation and that from which I had
so recently and happily emerged. On my ascending the coach at
Gosport, I had placed myself on the roof between two men who had
the appearance of country farmers, and I maintained that situation
throughout the night, by which indeed I was something benefited,
for they had both good great-coats, and we sitting rather crowded,
I was warmer than I should otherwise have been. On the coach
stopping at the Gloucester Coffee-house, Piccadilly, I expressed my
intention to alight and walk; the two farmers had the same
inclination, and I observed, that if they were going my way, I
should be glad of their company. They answered they were strangers
in town, and their only object was to find out the inn from which
the Yorkshire coach set out, as they were proceeding to that county
immediately. I replied, I was myself almost a stranger to those
matters, but I fancied the inn lay in the way I was going, and that
I would with pleasure conduct them to it. We accordingly set
forwards, and walked through Piccadilly, the Haymarket, Strand,
&amp;c., until we came to Fetter-Lane; and arriving at the White
Horse, I was, I found, right in my conjecture, for the York coach
was among the number of those advertised in large characters on
each side the gateway of the inn. I introduced them to the
coach-office, where they took places for die ensuing evening; and,
as my night's ride had brought me to an appetite, I proposed
(before going to my mother's, whose lodgings were close at hand,)
that we should breakfast together; to which they assenting, I
conducted them to the coffee-room, and calling the waiter, ordered
tea, coffee, and plenty of muffins with all possible speed. We had
nearly concluded our meal, and I had just bespoke a morning paper
from the waiter, when the room beginning to fill, several gentlemen
entered, and passed the table at which we sat, proceeding to the
upper end of the room. At that moment a voice struck my ear, which
almost petrified me with fear and astonishment, for I felt
persuaded at the time that it was that of Mr. Oxley himself,
exclaiming, "Waiter, see that portmanteau of mine brought in." On
hearing these words, I almost dropped the tea-cup from my hand, and
on the impulse of the moment, quitted my seat, and hastily left the
room; nor did I stop for a moment's reflection until I had crossed
Holborn, and found myself at the corner of Gray's-Inn-Lane. Then,
however, conceiving I was out of danger, I endeavoured to rally my
spirits, and to persuade myself that I must have been mistaken, as
it was highly improbable that Mr. Oxley, whom I had left on board
the Buffalo, should so suddenly have arrived in town, and
particularly at the White Horse, no Portsmouth or Gosport coach
setting up there. However, Mr. Oxley's voice and manner of speaking
being a little remarkable, I was so far in doubt that I determined
not to return. What opinion the countryman must form of me, I know
not; it is likely they would impute my unmannerly departure to a
design of avoiding payment of the reckoning. I have since
ascertained that I was mistaken in my conjecture, for Mr.Oxley did
not quit the ship until several days afterwards.</p>

<p>I now repaired to Middle-Row, and inquiring for my mother, was
ushered up stairs, where I found her and my two sisters pretty
comfortably situated in a genteel first floor, which they hired
ready furnished. They all expressed great joy at seeing me. My
mother appeared to be in a declining state, but my sisters were
much improved, and really very fine girls. I understood that the
whole family were supported by the industry of the latter, who
worked incessantly at their needle, being excellent proficients in
fancy-work, which they obtained from various shops. Having
explained to my mother the particulars of my situation, and the
risk I had incurred by my desertion; and recollecting that I had
inconsiderately suffered her letter, in which was her address, to
be seen by several persons on board the Buffalo, it occurred to me
that Captain Houston might possibly come to the knowledge of that
particular, the consequence of which might be fatal to me. It was
the opinion of my mother, that I should on that account, absent
myself from town for a few weeks, until the affair was blown over,
and my mother advised that I should go down to my relations in
S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;shire. I accordingly the next day set out by
the coach, an aunt of mine who was in good circumstances, supplying
me with the needful. On arriving at S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; I went
to a public-house, which was still kept by a woman who had known me
from my infancy; as I feared to break abruptly on my aged
grandfather, who might be too much affected to sustain the
surprise, I, therefore, got the landlady to send word that a
stranger had arrived, who brought news from his grandson: having
thus prepared the way, I followed in person, and was received with
transport by my dear and venerable benefactor. On inquiring into
his circumstances, I was grieved to learn that he had been for
several years obliged to subsist upon the charity of his friends,
and particularly the worthy family of the Moultries, of whom I have
made honourable mention in the second chapter of these Memoirs. I
was also concerned to find that the dear old man's faculties were
much impaired, and my grief was heightened by the reflection that
my misconduct and consequent misfortunes had been the primary cause
of his mental as well as pecuniary distress. My other relatives in
S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; treated me with every mark of attention, and
I was hospitably entertained by them all during my stay in that
town. It is to be observed, that only two or three of my nearest
relations were acquainted with the events of my life for the last
seven years. It was given out that I had been abroad, but it was
understood in a respectable capacity. About a fortnight after, my
arrival in S&mdash;&mdash;shire, I received a letter from my
mother, informing me that no inquiry whatever had been made
respecting me, and concluding from thence that I might with safety
return when I thought proper. As no prospect of employment
presented itself in the country, it was the opinion of my friends
that I should again try my fortune in London; for which purpose
they jointly supplied me with money to defray my present expenses,
and contributed among them a few necessaries I was most in need of.
I was persuaded, that my dear grandfather would not experience the
want of any reasonable comforts during the short remaining term of
his life, which could not in all probability be long protracted. I
was, therefore, less solicitous about continuing on the spot, as my
presence in fact only tended to recall to his half-distracted mind
the remembrance of former and better days. My grandfather gave me
letters of recommendation to several of his old law acquaintances,
particularly one to a Mr. Belt, who held a superior situation in
the crown-office, and who had formerly been articled to himself
when resident in London.</p>

<p>All things being arranged, I once more took leave of my friends,
and set off by the coach for London, on the 1st of January, 1808.
Having occasion to take a fresh coach at Birmingham, and wishing to
take a little recreation, which the restraint I was under at
S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and the nature of the place had hitherto
precluded me from, and having the pecuniary means of so doing in my
power, I determined on devoting a few days to that object, before I
resumed my journey to London. After three days' amusement I again
took coach, and having travelled all night, we stopped about seven
in the morning at Henley-upon-Thames to breakfast. I had been so
free in my expenses at Birmingham, that I had at this time but four
shillings left in my purse I therefore declined alighting, in order
to have the cost of a breakfast, as I had had a snack at the last
stage, and felt no inclination to eat. The other passengers having
entered the house, I remained alone in the coach, the horses being
taken out and the coachman and guard having also quitted it. After
sitting a few minutes, it occurred to me that I had seen a number,
of small parcels put into the seats of the coach, previous to our
departure from Birmingham; and, having frequently, heard of large
sums in bank-notes being transmitted by this mode of conveyance to
London, I was tempted to purloin one of them, which it appeared I
should run no risk in doing, as the coast was clear, and I had a
large bundle of linen, &amp;c., deposited in one of the seats. I
solemnly declare that until this moment, no idea of depredation had
entered my head since my arrival in England; the act was,
therefore, perfectly unpremeditated. Without hesitation then, I
opened the seat, and taking out my bundle, untied it, in case of a
surprise. As I had not time to examine the contents of the various
parcels, I determined to trust to fortune, and therefore took out
the first which came to hand. It was enclosed in. brown paper, tied
with packthread, about twelve inches by eight in size, and from its
weight and hardness, I supposed it to contain some kind of cutlery
or other hardware; but as such goods were commonly packed up with
bank-notes, to prevent a suspicion of money being, enclosed, the
apparent contents were a matter of indifference to me. The parcel
was directed to "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, Goodge-street,
Tottenham-court-road." This circumstance convinced me there could
be no discovery of the robbery until after I was far enough from
the coach, which I intended to quit on arriving at the, Gloucester
Coffee-house, as, in case I had gone on to the George and Blue-boar
in Holborn, the parcel might possibly have been searched for, on
our passing the end of Tottenham-court-road. Having concealed my
prize in my own bundle, which I replaced in the seat, I judged it
best to alight and partake of breakfast with the other passengers.
I was also in better spirits on account of the confidence I felt
that I should find something in the parcel to recruit my slender
finances; as let the contents be what they might, it was probable
they would produce me at least a guinea or two, which would supply
my immediate exigencies. I accordingly entered the parlour, and
took a cup of coffee with the company. The bill being called,
amounted to two shillings and three pence per head; I put down
half-a-crown which left me in possession of eighteen pence. We then
re-ascended the coach; and resumed our journey. At three in the
afternoon we entered London, and stopping as usual at the
Gloucester Coffee-house, I told the coachman I should then leave
him, as I resided in the neighbourhood. He inquired if I had any
luggage; and on my saying I had a bundle in the seat, he opened the
door and handed it to me. I gratified him with a shilling out of my
small stock, and made the best of my way. Having suffered the coach
to pass on, I followed slowly until I arrived in Holborn; but
previous to visiting my mother, I entered a public-house, being
anxious to examine my newly-acquired prize. Retiring to a private
room, I cut the string with a trembling hand, and opening the
outside paper, found three several parcels (also in brown paper,)
lying one upon another. Developing the first of these, I found it
to contain, to my no small surprise and chagrin, a quantity of
fine, new &mdash;&mdash; twelvepenny nails! about a hundred in
number. My hopes now fell to the ground. I was determined, however,
to see the whole; and lo! the second paper contained &mdash;&mdash;
the same quantity of tenpenny nails !! The third and last, which I
carelessly unfolded, expecting nothing better, presented a number
of small plated articles, apparently designed for fixing on
harness, being hooks, rings, &amp;c., of various shapes, and every
one separately wrapped in fine silver paper. As these latter
articles were of no more real value to me than the nails, I was
much mortified at my ill luck, and was on the point of tying up the
whole parcel in order to throw it away as soon as I gained the
street, when it fortunately struck me that there must be somewhere,
a letter or note accompanying these goods. I, therefore, once more
overhauled the packages, and lifting up the bottom one, found under
it a letter, which on taking up, I perceived to contain an
enclosure, and I plainly felt several pieces of loose money. Now
again my spirits rose&mdash;all that I had read and heard of large
sums in bank-notes being artfully transmitted in this manner,
recurred to my mind, and I eagerly drew the candle towards me, half
afraid, and yet impatient to see the event. The letter was
superscribed in the same manner as the parcel; and opening it, I
could scarce believe my eyes, when I discovered some bank-paper
carefully folded, and through which the black marks of the sum
weret plainly discernible! Before I ascertained the amount however,
I proceeded to peruse the letter, and found it to the following
effect:&mdash;"Sir, I have sent you herewith specimens of the nails
and other articles; the order shall be completed as speedily as
possible. I have also enclosed you £47 9s. which you will find to
be the present balance between us. I am, &amp;c."&mdash;Here was an
unexpected windfall! The reader will conceive my joy, and with what
satisfaction I replaced the parcel in my bundle, in order to quit
the public-house. The notes proved to be two twenty pounds each an
a Birmingham bank but payable also at Forster, Lubbbock, and Co's.
in London, a bank of England five pound note, and another of two
pounds, also a bank dollar, and four shillings. I now repaired with
a light heart to my mother's lodgings, where I met with a cordial
welcome. Having spent the evening with my mother, I walked into the
city and procured a bed at an inn. The next morning I sent one of
my twenty pound notes by a porter to the banking-house, where he
procured small notes of the Bank of England in exchange; I soon
afterwards called myself with the second, and did the like. Being
now possessed of near fifty pounds by this lucky hit, I determined
to furnish myself with a stock of genteel clothes, a watch, and
other appendages, prior to my obtaining some employment, as I
always considered an outward appearance essential to success in
every pursuit; but I was firmly resolved never again to hazard my
liberty by a second act or attempt of a similar nature.</p>

<p>In a few days. I had purchased such articles as were most
requisite, at the expense of about forty pounds, and I then turned
my attention to procuring a genteel situation. I accordingly waited
on Mr. Belt, the gentleman I mentioned of the Crown-office; who, on
perusal of the letter I presented, testified his respect for my
grandfather's recommendation, and very obligingly offered to take
me as an assistant clerk under his own direction in the above
office, if I thought fit to accept of a guinea a week, which was
all he could promise to allow me at first, but might be afterwards
increased. I thought this too favourable an offer to be rejected.
I, therefore, thankfully closed with it, and prepared immediately,
to attend assiduously to the duties of my office.</p>

<p><i>Quit the Crown Office, and engage as Reader in a Printing
Office.&mdash;Determine to live a strictly honest life.&mdash;Meet
with an old Acquaintance who laughs me out of my
Resolution.&mdash;Give up all thoughts of Servitude and become a

</p>

<p>I HAD, on my second arrival in London, engaged a small apartment
in a creditable house, and regulated my expenses upon principles of
the strictest economy; but notwithstanding every possible effort, I
soon found it impossible to subsist within my income; consequently,
in a few weeks I had sensibly decreased my little capital. I,
therefore, began to consider how I might obtain a more productive
situation, as I saw no prospect of my present salary being
augmented. At this juncture I met with an advertisement for a
person of good education, to act as Reader in a Printing Office.
Though this was an employment of which I had not the least idea, I
determined to offer myself, conceiving there could be nothing very
difficult in its duties. Having, therefore, first inquired into the
nature of the latter I boldly applied to the advertiser Mr.
Barnard, on Snow-hill; and in answer to his queries, replied that I
had lately left the service of a country printer, whom I named, and
was well acquainted with the business of a printing office in
general; adding, that if he pleased to make trial of me, I doubted
not of proving well qualified for the situation in question. Mr.
Barnard consented to do so; and informing me that the salary he had
given my predecessor was two guineas a week, expressed his
willingness to allow me the same. I was so much pleased with this
increase of wages, as well as with the nature of the employment
when explained to me, that I immediately quitted Mr. Belt, and
began my attendance at the office of Mr. Barnard. My business here
was to read over or examine the proofs (sheet by sheet, as they
were struck off by the pressmen) of every new work printed by my
employer. These proofs or first impressions, having been first
compared with the copy or manuscript, the errors so discovered
being noted by me, were corrected by the compositor, and a second
impression produced, which was then carefully examined, and the few
errors yet remaining were rectified as before. A third sheet was
then revised by me, which in most cases proved perfectly correct;
and this being ascertained, the required number of copies were
struck off, whilst a succeeding sheet was in the hands of the
compositors, in a state of progress for the like operation. In a
few days I had a perfect knowledge of the business confided to me;
and here I found the advantages of a good education, and of my
extensive reading, which enabled me at first sight to detect many
errors that an experienced "Reader," with a common education would
have passed over, particularly where Latin or French phrases,
quotations, &amp;c., were introduced. This soon became obvious to
my employer, who expressed his satisfaction, and paid me more than
common respect. On my part I was equally pleased with my new
situation. The business of Mr. Barnard's office was very extensive.
It employed from forty to fifty workmen in various capacities, and
he had generally ten or more different works (periodical as well as
others) in the press, among these were some of an entertaining
kind; so that while I was performing my duty, I gratified my
passion for reading, and anticipated the public in the perusal of
many curious and interesting new publications.</p>

<p>I still adhered closely to my system of economy and took care to
expend something less than my income. It was my fixed determination
to abstain from every kind of dishonesty; and for about three weeks
I met with no temptation to an opposite conduct: but one day as I
entered the eating-house at which I commonly dined, I was accosted
by a young man who had come home with me from New South Wales, in
the Buffalo, having been for several years in the service of
Governor King. This was, in fact, the very person to whom I had
confided my intention of deserting, and bequeathed my effects
previous to my going ashore. Our joy at meeting was reciprocal, and
before we parted an appointment to sup together the same evening
was the consequence. My old friend informed me that the Buffalo was
paid in about five days after I quitted her, and that the crew were
immediately drafted into various ships: he himself was put on board
the Diomede of 50, and having at last, with much difficulty,
obtained a liberty-ticket for eight days, he had been about a week
in town. It is needless to add, that nothing was further from his
thoughts than returning. From him I also learnt that a diligent
search was instituted for me in Portsmouth the day after my
absconding, and that Captain King, as well as his subordinate
Captain Houston, were much exasperated on the occasion. On meeting
my shipmate at the appointed place (which by-the-by, proved to be a
house of ill repute) he introduced me to several other old
acquaintances, who had also come home with us, and to a few of the
same stamp, who had been a longer time returned, from New South
Wales. I soon discovered that they had all resumed the same
depredatory course of life which had caused their former
sufferings, and must inevitably entail upon them future misery and
disgrace. However, as I knew how fruitless it would be to advise or
remonstrate, I contented myself with letting them know that I had
met with a tolerable situation which enabled me to live <i>upon the
square</i>, and that I had "<i>tied up prigging,</i>" as I was
determined never to be "<i>lagged</i>" again[*].</p>

<p class="footnote">[* See Cant Dictionary.]</p>

<p>By this communication I only incurred at the moment, a few dry
jokes on my pretended honesty, and a hint or two that I should soon
become tired of servitude, and be easily brought over to get an
easy guinea. Upon the whole, I spent a very agreeable evening, but
to prevent a relapse, I determined to avoid the company of these
misguided persons in future, notwithstanding they extracted a
promise at partings that I would meet them again next day. This
promise I scrupled not to break, and how long I might have
refrained from their society I know not; but a day or two
afterwards, as I was descending Holborn-hill in my way to the
office, I unexpectedly met my old partner and fellow-sufferer,
Alexander Bromley, whom I had left in Newgate in 1801. Having in
vain made inquiry as to his fate, since my return to England, I was
truly glad to see him, for he looked well and was genteelly
dressed. I was so much altered, that when I first accosted him, he
had no immediate recollection of me, but on making myself known,
nothing could exceed the joy he evinced at our meeting. Before we
parted it was indispensable that we should drink together, and he
hastily informed me that he had served his seven years on board the
Hulks, at Portsmouth, from whence he returned to London the 17th of
September 1807, and that he was now once more under the protection
of his father, who had received him with great kindness, and was
inclined, if he continued honest, to take care of his future
fortune; but added, with a shrewd shake of the head, that he could
never reconcile himself to confinement on a shop-board, and feared
he should very speedily make a push at some higher enjoyments.
Having agreed to dine together, and by mere accident named the
house at which I had lately supped as the place of meeting, we
parted with some little regret.</p>

<p>Bromley was punctual to his time, and during the two hours I
allowed for dinner, we became more fully informed of each other's
circumstances. When I was on the point of leaving him to return to
my duty, two or three of my Botany-bay acquaintances dropping in,
forcibly detained me; urging that I might for once stretch a point,
and spend the afternoon with them, ridiculing with too much effect,
the idea of a man like myself being confined to certain hours like
a schoolboy, &amp;c. As I was somewhat elevated with the liquor I
had drank, and had really no business at the office which could not
be easily deferred, I consented in an evil moment, to join the
party which was forming, consisting of nearly a dozen persons, most
of them recently returned either from the Hulks, or New South
Wales. It is needless to describe the nature of our conversation,
or the various characters of which the party was composed; let it
suffice to state (with sorrow and shame I confess it) that I was
effectually laughed out of my late good intentions; and before we
parted, had joined with the loudest of them in decrying and
contemning every species of servitude or confinement; and cordially
agreed in a resolution to live independent while I could, and to
make up by every means in my power for the privations and
sufferings I had endured for the last seven years.</p>

<p>From this moment I returned no more to the printing-office, but
joined myself with Bromley, and a few others, who regularly walked
out every evening in quest of money, without confining our pursuits
to any particular branch, but embracing every opportunity which
offered. These were indeed but few, and far from productive, so
that I soon grew heartily tired of the set I was associated with,
and determined to withdraw myself from them the first opportunity,
and to live by the exercise of my own ingenuity. Indeed my
appearance was so much above, and of so different a stamp from
their's, that this circumstance alone was enough to excite
suspicion, and on many accounts rendered them unsuitable companions
for me. I determined, however, not to discard poor Bromley, for
whom I felt a real friendship, on account of our former intimacy
and joint misfortunes.</p>

Life when disengaged from my vicious Companions.&mdash;Meet with an
amiable girl, like myself, the Child of Misfortune.&mdash;We

</p>

<p>HAVING withdrawn myself from my late companions, I now became
very circumspect in my proceedings; and as Bromley had neither the
appearance nor the manners of a gentleman, I only made use of him
occasionally in the course of my practice, keeping him in the back
ground to receive and carry any articles which I purloined, and
never suffering him to converse with, or approach me except in
private. I generally spent the mornings, that is, from about one
o'clock to five P. M. (which are the fashionable hours for
shopping) in visiting the shops of Jewellers, Watchmakers,
Pawnbrokers, &amp;c. Having conceived hopes that this species of
robbery would turn to a good account, and depending upon my own
address and appearance, I determined to make a circuit of the town,
and not to omit a single shop in either of those branches: and this
scheme I actually executed so fully, that I believe I did not leave
ten untried in all London, for I made a point of commencing every
day in a certain street and went regularly through it on both sides
the way. My practice was to enter a shop and request to look at
gold seals, chains, broaches, rings, or any other small articles of
value; and while examining them, and looking the shopkeeper in the
face, I contrived by slight of hand to conceal two or three
(sometimes more) in the sleeve of my coat, which was purposely made
wide. On some occasions I purchased a trifling article to save
appearances; at other times I took a card of the shop, promising to
call again; and as I generally saw the remaining goods returned to
the window, or place from whence they were taken, before I left the
shop, there was hardly a probability of my being suspected, or of
the property being missed. In the course of my career I was never
once detected in the fact, though on two or three occasions, so
much suspicion arose, that I was obliged to exert all my
effrontery, and to use very high language, in order, as the cant
phrase is, to <i>bounce</i> the tradesman <i>out of it;</i> and my
fashionable appearance, and affected anger at his insinuations, had
always the effect of convincing him that he was mistaken, and
inducing him to apologize for the affront put upon me. I have even
sometimes carried away the spoil notwithstanding what had passed,
and I have often gone a second and third time to the same shop,
with as good success as at the first. To prevent accidents however,
I made it a rule never to enter a second shop with any stolen
property about me; for as soon as I quitted the first, I privately
conveyed my booty to Bromley, who was attending my motions in the
street, and herein I found him eminently useful. By this course of
depredation I acquired on the average about ten pounds a week,
though I sometimes neglected shopping for several days together.
This was not, indeed, the only pursuit I followed, but was my
principal morning's occupation; though if a favourable opportunity
offered of getting a guinea by any other means, I never let it
slip. In the evenings I generally attended one of the theatres,
where I mixed with the best company in the boxes, and at the same
time that I enjoyed the amusements of the place, I frequently
conveyed pocket-books, snuff-boxes, and other portable articles,
from the pockets of their proprietors into my own. Here I found the
inconvenience of wanting a suitable companion, who might have
received the articles I made prize of, in the same manner as
Bromley did in the streets; but though I knew many of the
light-fingered gentry, whose appearance fitted them for any
company, yet, their faces being well known to the police-officers,
who attend the Theatres, they would not have been suffered to enter
the house: and herein I possessed an advantage which many of these
gentry envied me; for being just arrived in England, and a new face
upon the town, I carried on my depredations under the very noses of
the officers, without suspicion. Having therefore, at first no
associate, I was obliged to quit the Theatre and conceal my first
booty in some private spot before I could make (with prudence) a
second attempt. Upon the whole I was very successful in this
pursuit also, at least as to the <i>number</i> of articles I
filched, and had their <i>value</i> been reasonably proportionate
to what I expected, I need not long have followed so hazardous an
employment. I have very frequently obtained nine or ten
pocket-books, besides other articles, in an evening; and these
being taken from gentlemen evidently of fortune and fashion, I had
reason to expect I should sometime meet with a handsome sum in
Bank-notes; but fortune did not favour me therein, for during near
twelve months almost nightly attendance at one or other of the
public places, I never found more than twenty pounds in a book, and
that only on one occasion. I several times got five, ten, or eleven
pounds, but commonly one, two, or three pounds, and most generally
four books out of five contained nothing but letters, memorandums,
and other papers, useless to me. At the same time I knew frequent
instances of the common street pick-pockets getting booty of fifty,
one hundred and sometimes three or four hundred pounds. However, I
never failed to pay the expenses of the night, and if I gained
nothing, I enjoyed at least a fund of amusement, which was to me
the highest gratification. It sometimes happened that the articles
I got (particularly pocket-books) were advertised by the losers,
within a few days, as "Lost" and a reward offered for their
restoration: where this reward was worth notice, I frequently
restored the property by means of a third person whom I could
confide in, and whom I previously tutored for the purpose.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the manner in which I spent my life,
abstracted from the disgraceful means by which I supported myself,
was (as I have formerly hinted,) perfectly regular and inoffensive.
Though I lived by depredation, yet I did not like the abandoned
class of common thieves, waste my money, and leisure time in
profligate debauchery, but applied myself to the perusal of
instructive and amusing books, my stock of which I daily increased.
I occupied genteel apartments in a creditable house, the landlord
of which understood me to hold a situation under Government, and
every part of my conduct at home tended to confirm his opinion of
my respectability. I was scrupulously exact in paying my rent, as
well as the different tradesmen in the neighbourhood, with whom I
had occasion to deal; nor did I ever suffer any person of loose
character to visit me, but studiously concealed from those of my
acquaintance my place of residence. I was sometimes, indeed, so
imprudent as to resort, for company's sake, to some of those
public-houses frequented by thieves and other dissolute characters,
the landlord of which is himself commonly an experienced thief, or
returned transport. When I had a mind to relax a little, or grew
tired of domestication, I disguised my appearance as much as I
could and repaired to a house of this description, sometimes taking
my Dulcinea with me, whom I shall shortly introduce to the reader,
and whose person and dress I was not a little proud of exhibiting
in public. This fondness for flash-houses, as they are termed, is
the rock on which most persons who live by depredation unhappily
split, and will be found in the sequel to have brought me to my
present deplorable condition; for the police officers, or traps,
are in the daily habit of visiting these houses, where they drink
with the thieves, &amp;c., in the most familiar manner; and, I
believe, often obtain secret information by various means from some
parties respecting the names, characters, pursuits, &amp;c., of
others. By this imprudent conduct I also became personally known to
many of the officers, which was productive of great danger to me in
the exercise of my vocation; whereas, had I avoided such houses, I
might have remained unknown and unsuspected by them for a series of
years. I ought not to omit what may perhaps gratify the reader, as
much as the act did myself, namely, that as soon as I became
possessed of a moderate sum, I remembered the kindness shewn me by
the good woman at Gosport, and wrote her a letter of thanks,
enclosing a five-pound bank-note, which, no doubt, proved highly
acceptable. I also from time to time assisted my aged mother, whose
circumstances were extremely narrow, and her support derived solely
from the earnings of my two sisters, whose success depending on the
caprice of fashion and of milliners, both alike inconstant, was but
precarious. They, as well as my other relations in
S&mdash;&mdash;shire, were indeed totally ignorant of my unhappy
relapse into a life of infamy, but believed my assertion, that I
had a liberal salary from Mr. Belt, and was still employed under
that gentleman in the Crown-office.</p>

<p>About three months after my return to London, and whilst in the
zenith of my success, I was introduced by one of my former
dissolute companions to the acquaintance of a young woman, who,
like myself, had been well and tenderly brought up, but having been
seduced by a young man equally inexperienced with herself, to quit
her friends and cohabit with him as his wife, she had thereby
forfeited the countenance of her family, and her paramour having
died after a year's cohabitation, she had been driven to the usual
refuge in such cases, a life of prostitution. At the period of my
introduction, however, she had been only a few months upon the
town, and I clearly perceived that her mind was yet but very
slightly contaminated. As there were many reasons which rendered a
female companion in whom I could place confidence, desirable, and
in fact necessary to me; and as this young woman's misfortunes had
placed her in such circumstances, that I had no obstacles to
surmount on the score of delicacy, I proposed to her, after a few
days' acquaintance, that we should live together; to which, as she
was heartily tired of her present course of life, she willingly
consented. She knew enough of the world from her late experience,
to surmise in what manner I obtained my living, of which, however,
to avoid all duplicity, I fully possessed her. Having informed my
landlord, that my wife, whom I had not before mentioned to him, was
arrived in town from a visit she had been paying in the country, I
accordingly took her home; and in a very few days we had arranged a
pretty snug system of domestic economy, and provided every
requisite for the family life I meant in future to live. My
companion was the daughter of an industrious mechanic, who, having
a numerous offspring, had only been enabled to give her a common
education; but her mother had instructed her in the duties of
housekeeping, and she was perfectly conversant in all the qualities
requisite to form a good wife. She was about nineteen years of age,
agreeable in her person, and of the sweetest disposition
imaginable; and what was most gratifying, the company she had
latterly mixed with, and the disgusting examples before her eyes,
had not been able to eradicate an innate modesty which she
naturally possessed; so that her manners and conversation were such
as fitted her for any company to which I might be inclined to
introduce her. I informed my mother and sisters that I was on the
point of contracting a union with this young woman, and having made
them personally acquainted, the three young ladies soon became very
intimate. As my mother and sisters but rarely called at my
lodgings, and then merely <i>en passant</i>, I had no difficulty in
concealing the connexion from them until I could with propriety
declare my marriage to have taken place. We had the happiness of
finding ourselves mutually pleased with each other, and I
considered my meeting with so amiable a friend as one of the
greatest blessings of my life. In a few weeks after our junction,
my partner discovered evident symptoms of pregnancy, which with her
affectionate behaviour, and real attachment to my interest,
endeared her still more to me. In a word, I now felt myself as
happy as any man daily risking his liberty and life, and exposed to
the reproaches of his own conscience, could possibly be.</p>

<p><i>Adventures in the course of my profligate
Career.&mdash;Motives which induce me to marry my
Companion.&mdash;Her exemplary Behaviour.&mdash;A family
Misfortune.</i>
</p>

<p>HAVING now settled myself in a manner much to my satisfaction,
and happily met with a faithful friend, to whom I might confide my
most secret thoughts, who would sincerely participate my joy, when
success crowned my pursuits; and who, in the hour of adversity,
would condole with, and cherish me, I applied myself with redoubled
assiduity to the acquirement of money, with a full resolution in
the event of my meeting with one good booty, or realizing by
degrees a sufficient sum to quit the hazardous course of life I had
embarked in, to establish myself in some honest line of business.
To this prudent measure I was also strongly prompted by my
companion, who could not hide her fears and anxiety on my account,
and was never easy during my absence from home on a depredatory
excursion. I continued to visit the shops as usual in the morning,
and the theatres in the evening with tolerable success; and my
partner having expressed a desire to accompany me, in the hope of
rendering me service, I was induced to gratify her. As her figure
and address were both extremely prepossessing, and her air
perfectly genteel, I soon found her eminently useful; for she not
only received from me the property I purloined, but with much
ingenuity would contrive to engross the attention of the
shop-keeper while I robbed his counter, or by artful gallanting
with a gentleman at a public place, facilitate my design upon his
pockets. At all times, when disengaged from these hazardous
practices, we lived a life of perfect domestic happiness, our
chiefest pleasure being centred in each other's company.</p>

<p>As our mutual affection increased, my companion, whom I had
informed of the outlines of my past life, and who was aware of the
dangers to which I was daily exposed, being filled with tender
fears of losing me for ever, and prompted by sincere affection,
suggested the idea of uniting ourselves indissolubly by marriage;
in the hope that should I unhappily experience a reverse of
fortune, and be again banished from my native country, she might
obtain permission to share my misery, and contribute, by her
society, to lessen my sufferings. This proposal so fully convinced
me of her undisguised attachment, and had so much reason on its
side, that I gave into it with ardent pleasure; and the necessary
preliminaries being adjusted, we were accordingly married at St.
Paul's, Covent-Garden, on the 21st of July, 1808, her mother, to
whom, she had become reconciled, and who (judging by appearances,)
had a favourable opinion of the match, assisting at the
ceremony.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, I communicated the event to my mother,
informing her that weighty reasons had rendered it necessary to
observe privacy on the occasion; and hinting to the unsuspecting
old woman, that I had acquired by this marriage, a considerable
pecuniary advantage. This intimation gave my mother great pleasure,
and I took care by increased liberality towards her and my sisters,
to confirm them in the opinion of my veracity. The behaviour of my
wife became every day more exemplary; and had I been free from that
remorse which must ever accompany a guilty life, and enabled to
procure those necessary comforts which I knew so well how to enjoy,
by upright means, I should have considered myself supremely happy.
In the beginning of the month of October, my wife, who was far
advanced in her pregnancy, accompanied me one evening to Drury-lane
theatre; and the performance being over, we were descending the
stair-case from the box-lobby, when I attempted to possess myself
of a gentleman's pocket-book; but by some accident he suspected my
design, and publicly accused me therewith. Unfortunately several
other gentlemen, who had been robbed in the course of the evening,
being on the spot, and beginning to compare notes, agreed
unanimously that they recollected my person as being near them
about the time they were robbed, and did not scruple to insinuate
that I ought to be detained and searched. This conversation
naturally attracted the attention of the company immediately round
us; but while it took place, all the parties were obliged by the
pressure of the throng behind to continue descending, and we in
fact quitted the theatre all together. Being arrived in Little
Russell-street, the gentlemen surrounded me to the number of about
a score, and our altercation became loud and vehement. Fortunately
for me no police-officers happened to be near the spot; for
although I had nothing to fear from a search, yet the circumstance
would have made me personally known to the latter, and would of
course operate to my disadvantage on my future appearance at the
theatre. I exerted every art of expostulation, and finally had
recourse, on my part, to threats, affecting to feel highly insulted
by their insolent insinuations; declared myself a gentleman of
character, which I would prove to their cost; offered to give my
card of address, or to retire to a coffee-house, and send for
respectable persons who knew me, but all my rhetoric proved
ineffectual; some were for giving me in charge to an officer;
others still more violent were for having me pumped. At this moment
a person named G&mdash;ge W&mdash;k&mdash;n, now in this colony,
who had been himself exercising his vocation in the pit of the
theatre, happened fortunately to come up, and seeing a crowd
collected, stopped to ascertain the cause. He immediately perceived
the critical situation in which I stood, and having the appearance
of a man of fashion, he stepped forward, and hearing the various
motions of my persecutors, strongly advised them to forbearance,
and caution how they treated a gentleman, as I evidently appeared
to be; urging that they must certainly be mistaken in their
conjectures, that my proposal of giving my address, or a reference,
ought to be sufficient, and particularly dwelt on the impropriety
of taking the law into their own hands. These arguments of my
friend W&mdash;k&mdash;n carried so much weight, that the gentlemen
began to waver and grow less clamorous; till at length they dropped
off one by one; and W&mdash;k&mdash;n, assuming a haughty tone,
said, taking me by the arm, "Come, Sir, you have been sufficiently
exposed, and long enough detained on a charge which I am confident
there is no foundation for; allow me to conduct you from this spot;
if you are going towards St. James's, I shall be glad of your
company, and let me see (raising his voice and cane together,) who
will dare to insult you further." So saying, he led me away in
triumph, tipping the wink to my poor wife, who had stood all the
while at a small distance, much terrified and agitated by various
emotions, which so much affected her, that though we lived within
two hundred yards of the theatre, she had scarcely power to walk
home; and we had no sooner quitted our kind conductor, who attended
us to the door, than she fainted away, and was for sometime
insensible. The consequences of this untoward event were still more
seriously afflicting, for her tender constitution was not proof
against the shock, and she was the next day prematurely delivered
of a male child, which, however, only lived eight hours, and was a
subject of infinite regret to us both.</p>

<h2><a name="ch205" id="ch205"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p><i>Adventure of the Silver Snuff-box.&mdash;Its
Consequences.&mdash;My narrow Escape from Transportation, which I
have since had reason to regret.</i>
</p>

<p>HAPPENING soon after the adventure at Drury-lane, to read an
advertisement, stating that a meeting of the freeholders of the
county of Middlesex would be convened on the 11th of November, at
the Mermaid Tavern, Hackney, to consider of the expediency of
petitioning the Throne on the subject of parliamentary reform, it
struck me that I might find it worth while to attend this meeting,
as it would probably attract a large concourse of people, and, as
at such assemblies riots and much confusion frequently occurred,
which afforded a favourable opportunity for plundering the pockets
of the company. On the day appointed, I accordingly left town in
one of the Hackney stages, and arriving at the Mermaid about one
o'clock, found the sheriffs had just opened the business of the
meeting, which was held in a large room commonly used as an
assembly-room for dancing, and detached from the tavern itself. To
my disappointment, however, there were not above three hundred
persons collected, and the building being very spacious, there was
not the least prospect of any violent pressure taking place. Before
I commenced my operations, I entered a small house called "The
Tap," immediately contiguous to, but distinct from, the Mermaid;
and going into a parlour, called to the landlady, a decent looking
elderly woman, for a glass of brandy and water, and a pipe. Having
taken and paid for this refreshment, I proceeded to the meeting;
and found, so far from any tumult or uproar, that the whole company
were collected at one end of the room, and listening in profound
silence to the speech of some popular and patriotic orator, who was
warmly censuring the conduct of ministers, and advocating the cause
of liberty. I now entered the thickest part of the crowd, and
having tried the pockets of a great many persons without feeling a
single pocket-book, I at length extracted successively two
snuff-boxes from different gentlemen; but their coats being
buttoned up, and the pockets inside, I was obliged to use my
scissors in cutting the bottom of each pocket, before I could
obtain the desired prizes. This trouble and risk I should not have
incurred had not I assured myself that the boxes from their shape,
&amp;c.; were both silver; but to my mortification, they proved on
inspection, the one wood, and the other a sort of japanned leather,
though both perfectly genteel, and mounted with silver: however, as
they were of no intrinsic value to me, I threw them away; and,
although it was rather imprudent I entered the room a third time,
in hopes of better success. I soon found myself standing behind a
well-dressed man, who was wrapped in deep attention to the speaker,
and perceived to my great joy that he had a small leather
pocket-book in his inside coat-pocket, and also a very fine large
snuff-box, evidently silver, from its shape and weight. I had again
recourse to my scissors, and having made an incision, extracted the
contents of the pocket, with which I hastily retired: but I was
again partially disappointed, for I found that what I had taken for
a pocket-book, was in fact merely a pen and ink-case: the box,
however, was a very elegant one, and quite new. Although it
appeared that I was not destined to be very fortunate in this day's
adventure, I determined to make one other trial; but as it would be
dangerous to keep the stolen box about me, and I saw no convenient
spot in which to conceal it, I adopted the following method to
dispose of it, while I made my final attempt in the assembly-room.
Going into the little tap-house before described, I addressed the
landlady, inquiring if she sold any snuff, or could without
inconvenience, procure me a little. She answered that she had none,
but would get me some in a very short time. I thanked her, and
replied that as I was anxious to hear the debates in the
assembly-room, she would oblige me by procuring an ounce of rappee,
for which purpose I handed her the box I had just obtained, saying
I would call for it in a quarter of an hour. Having now, as I
conceived, effectually and safely deposited my prize, I left the
Tap with an intention of re-entering the meeting-room; but suddenly
changing my mind, I determined to desist, having by the box alone
secured the expenses of my journey, and to return immediately home.
However, as I felt hungry, and saw no signs of accommodation for
eating in the Tap, I proceeded a little way up the street, till I
came to a sort of cook's-shop, where I procured a lunch, and then
returned to reclaim my snuff-box from my obliging old landlady,
having been absent from her barely a quarter of an hour. Going
boldly up to the little bar in which she sat, I inquired if she had
procured me the snuff; she replied that she had, and turning round
to a cup-board behind her, produced the box, which I held out my
hand to receive; but, to my utter confusion, I was prevented by the
gentleman himself, from whom I had stolen it, who, starting from a
dark corner of the passage close to my elbow, where he had been
concealed, received the box in his hand, and turning to me,
inquired in a peremptory tone, if that was my snuff-box? I answered
with a smile, "No, Sir, it is a box that I found&mdash;if you have
any claim to it, it is much at your service." He then inquired
where I had found it; I replied, that going to make water in a
corner of the stable-yard, I perceived something shine amongst some
rubbish, which taking up, I found to be the box in question; that I
was myself in the habit of taking snuff, and having that day left
my own box at home, I thought it a good opportunity of getting a
supply; that I had therefore commissioned the landlady to procure
me some snuff, and left her this box for that purpose. The
gentleman rejoined, that he had been robbed of the box in the
assembly-room, and that having found it in my possession, he felt
it incumbent to detain me, on strong suspicion of being the thief.
All I could urge, and every art I tried, were ineffectual to
convince this rigid gentleman of my innocence, and several others
joining him, one of them asked my name and situation in life. I
answered, that when charged with so disgraceful an act as that of
picking pockets, I should certainly decline giving such
explanation; but that I should at a proper season, be enabled to
refute the accusation, and prove my respectability. To this the
inquirer replied, that although himself a justice of peace, he
certainly had no wish to extort, nor was I obliged to give any
answers against my inclination, and that upon the whole, he could
not censure me for preserving silence; however, as the property
stolen had been traced to me, it became his duty and that of the
owner, to have me detained till I gave an account of myself. A
constable being called in, was now desired to search me, which he
proceeded to do, and the first thing he found was a pair of small
scissors without a sheath, in my breeches-pocket, where I had in my
hurry deposited them after cutting out my last booty. The constable
exhibited these with an air of triumph, exclaiming to the
by-standers, "See, gentlemen, here are the tools the pocket was cut
with!" He also took from me about fifty shillings in loose money, a
pocket-bock, card-case, pair of silver spectacles, a two-bladed
knife, silver pencil-case, tobacco-box, handkerchief, gloves,
&amp;c., all my own property, and such as I usually carried about
me. I had left my watch at home, which, it being a valuable one, I
was frequently persuaded by my wife to do when I went upon such
excursions as the present. The meeting being by this time
dissolved, the loser of the box set off on his return to town, and
I was left in charge of two constables who were to follow with me.
In about an hour, a coach being obtained, I was conveyed to
Worship-street office for examination, where I arrived at six in
the evening, just as the magistrate had taken the chair. This
worshipful justice was Joseph Moser, esq., a gentleman of an
eccentric character, and the same, if I mistake not, whose name I
have frequently met with in print, as the author of many
well-written and humorous essays, &amp;c., in periodical works.
Being placed at the bar, the prosecutor, who proved to be a Mr.
Imeson, tobacconist, in Hollywell-lane, Shoreditch, made his
appearance in the same coat he had on in the morning, and
exhibiting his pocket, through the bottom of which he thrust his
hand by way of demonstration. He stated, that he was that day
attending the meeting of freeholders at Hackney, and while
listening to the debates in the assembly, room, he had occasion to
take snuff; when putting his hand in his pocket, he found the
bottom of it cut, apparently with a sharp scissors, and not only
his snuff-box, but every other article taken out; that he was sure
the depredation was recent, as he had taken snuff but a few minutes
before, and had not since changed his position: that he staid to
hear the conclusion of the business, and on leaving the room, was
relating his loss to some gentlemen in the inn-yard, and that a
little boy happening to overhear him, stepped up and said, "Sir, my
mother has got a pretty snuff-box, that a gentleman gave her to put
some snuff in;" on which he was induced to accompany the child to
its parents, where, requesting to see the box, he found it to be
his own; that he had then taken the measures for my detection,
which I have above related. The landlady, Mrs. Andrews, was then
sworn, and stated my coming to her house, taking some refreshment,
and afterwards returning to inquire for snuff, leaving her the box,
&amp;c., all which, she said was transacted in the most public
manner; and, the good woman voluntarily added, that she could never
suppose I should have acted as I had done, had I been the person
who stole the box. The officer who had searched me, now produced
the articles taken from my person, not forgetting to dwell upon the
circumstance of the open scissors, the sheath of which he found in
another pocket. The magistrate viewing these articles with
attention, observed, that he had no doubt of their being all
stolen, and ordered them to be advertised in the daily papers, and
that I should be brought up again on that day week, when it was
probable the persons who had lost such articles, would attend to
identify them. As to the present charge, he said the case was clear
enough, and he would, to save further trouble, bind over the
parties to prosecute at once. Then addressing me, his worship
inquired my name, place of abode, &amp;c. I answered, that my name
was James Hardy, but I must beg to decline giving any further
account of myself, as it appeared his worship was determined to
commit me for trial, and I should therefore not trouble my friends
until a future day. Mr. Moser now remarked on some of the articles
found upon me, inquiring with a sarcastic grin, how long I had worn
barnacles? As to the knife, he said it was evidently a thief's
knife; and turning to Armstrong, one of his officers, he asked him,
if that was not such a blade as they used for <i>starring a
glaze?</i> The knife and scissors, his worship called my working
tools. It was in vain I assured this facetious justice that these
things were my own lawful property, and offered to prove where I
had purchased them all: he insisted on detaining them, and was
hardly persuaded to return the money taken from me. I was then
committed to New Prison, Clerkenwell, to which I was conveyed about
nine o'clock at night. Arriving there, I desired to be accommodated
between-gates, and after paying the usual fees, &amp;c., I was
conducted to a bed in the same room I had occupied on a like
occasion, in the year 1800. Having now leisure to reflect on the
occurrences of the day, I began to consider my situation hopeless
enough; the snuff-box having been traced to me, the circumstance of
the pocket being cut, the scissors found, &amp;c., altogether
furnished a chain of evidence, too strong, I feared, to be
overruled by my bare assertion, that I had found the property; a
defence the most flimsy, but the most commonly resorted to. I,
therefore, laid my account with being transported at least. What
heightened my present distress was, that my poor wife would be
grievously alarmed at my not returning home this night; and it
would be a difficult matter, even the next day, to inform her of my
situation, as I knew the officers were intent upon discovering, if
possible, my place of abode, in order to ascertain my character,
and mode of life. The morning being come, I was fortunate enough to
meet with an intimate acquaintance, by whom I despatched a message
to my wife, requiring her to visit me immediately, and in an hour's
time, I had the pleasure of seeing her appear. Her distress may be
easily conceived. I comforted and encouraged her as well as I
could; and giving her a strict caution not to suffer herself to be
followed or watched in her return, desired she would wait with
patience, and hope for the approach of the session, which would
decide my fate. During the interval of my second examination, I
read the following advertisement inserted by the officers of
Worship-street:&mdash;"Stopped upon a suspicious person now in
custody, the undermentioned articles, supposed to be stolen; [here
they were all minutely described.] Any persons having lost such
goods, are desired to attend at this office on Friday next, when
the said person will be brought up for re-examination, &amp;c.." On
the 18th of November, I was accordingly re-conducted to
Worship-street, my wife being permitted to accompany me in the
coach. Being again brought before Mr. Moser, that gentleman
inquired if any body was in attendance to claim the property found
on me; and being answered in the negative, he expressed himself
confident that claimants would appear, but said he would, however,
finally commit me to Newgate, and, that the articles in question
should be detained until the day of my trial; when, if not owned
before, the court would no doubt restore them on my application;
nor could all my asseverations or arguments convince him of the
property being my own, or induce him to alter his decree respecting
them. I was accordingly conducted to Newgate, accompanied by my
wife, whose uniform attention to me in this and every other
distress, proved the sincerity of her attachment.</p>

<p>As the session was to commence on the 30th, I had no time to
lose in preparing for my trial. I, therefore, drew up a brief for
counsel, in which I dwelt strongly on the open and public manner in
which I had acted with Mrs. Andrews; the improbability that I
should have taken so much trouble, had I been the thief who stole
the box, full of snuff, as the prosecutor described it to have
been, and on every other point which I thought might prove of
moment, or afford the counsel an opportunity of shewing his wit or
ingenuity, but still deceiving even him, by stoutly adhering to my
first story of finding the property. This brief I sent by my wife,
with the usual fee, to Mr. Knapp, a gentleman, of whose abilities I
entertained a high opinion. Notwithstanding all this, I had at the
bottom, very little hopes of escaping conviction; and persons best
experienced in such matters, who heard the circumstances, declared
nothing but a miracle could save me. I, however, concealed these
unpleasing ideas from my wife, and assured her that I felt
confident of being acquitted. The grand jury being met, I soon
heard that a true bill had been returned by them; and, on the
following Wednesday, the court opening, I was taken down for trial,
but was not put to the bar until Friday the 2d of December.
Previous to my leaving the ward of the prison in which I lodged, a
fellow-prisoner, with whom I had become intimate, knowing the
circumstances of my case, and the nature of my intended defence,
had in a half-jocular manner, offered to lend me his snuff-box,
which he advised me to display to the court, and occasionally to
take a pinch from it during my trial; this he observed, would
strengthen my assertion that I was in the habit of using snuff, and
give a colour to my defence; and, he good-naturedly added, that he
hoped it would prove lucky to me. I thankfully accepted the
proffered favour, of which I did not fail to make use at the proper
season. Being arraigned at the bar, I stood capitally indicted for
stealing a silver snuff-box, value two pounds, the property of
Thomas Imeson, privily from his person. Mr. Imeson having given his
evidence, my counsel in cross-examining him said,</p>

<p>"I take for granted, Sir, you can't take upon yourself to swear,
whether you were robbed of your snuff-box, or whether it fell
through the hole in your pocket; all you know is, that you found
your pocket torn, and the box among other articles missing?"</p>

<p>Answer, "Certainly I cannot."</p>

<p>The landlady then stated in a faltering voice, and evidently
much embarrassed at being examined before so large an assembly, the
manner in which I had applied to her, &amp;c., and in answer to a
question from Mr. Knapp, said, that she could never suppose I
should have acted in the open manner I did, if I had stolen the
box. The constable who searched me was the next witness; and he
having described that proceeding, and produced the articles found
upon me, the Recorder, who presided on the bench, said, "I suppose,
Mr. Bell, there were a great variety of characters attending this
meeting, which was held for the purpose of obtaining parliamentary
reform?"</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> "Certainly, my lord."</p>

<p><i>Recorder.</i> "No doubt there were many persons, freeholders
as well as not freeholders?"</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> "Yes, my lord."</p>

<p><i>Recorder.</i> "I dare say people of all descriptions,
tag-rag, and bobtail?"</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> "There might, my lord."</p>

<p>I now began to entertain strong hopes, perceiving that the tide
of prejudice ran in my favour. I was dressed in a very genteel but
becoming manner, and had not the least appearance of a thief. I had
put on the most modest air and countenance I could assume, and I
thought the court and jury appeared to view me with favourable
eyes. I, therefore, took another pinch from my friend's box, and
waited the event with patience, being prepared with a good defence,
when called upon to make it. But I was not put to that trouble; for
the Recorder addressing the jury, said,</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I must in this stage of the trial, deliver it as my
opinion, that I cannot see any grounds for charging the prisoner
with felony. Gentlemen, the accident of finding a snuff-box might
have happened to one of yourselves, to me, or to any other honest
man; and, it would be hard indeed if such an accident should
subject the finder to a prosecution for felony. If you are of my
opinion, it will be unnecessary to recapitulate the evidence, or
put the prisoner upon his defence."</p>

<p>His Lordship then paused, and I leave the reader to imagine the
state of suspense I was for some moments in. The jury having
whispered together, one of them stood up and said,</p>

<p>"My lord, we wish to ask a question of Mrs. Andrews, namely,
whether at the time the prisoner brought her the box, he delivered
it as his own, or said he had found it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Knapp eagerly catching at this question, desired Mrs.
Andrews to stand up, and said to her,</p>

<p>"Mrs. Andrews, the jury wish to ask you whether the young man at
the bar told you it was his own snuff-box, or whether he said he
had found it it."</p>

<p>The poor simple woman, confused and trembling, and not
comprehending the drift or importance of the question, answered in
a low voice,</p>

<p>"He said he had found it, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Mr. Knapp having obtained this answer, with a smile, or rather
laugh of satisfaction, turned to the jury, repeating her words,</p>

<p>"He said, he had found it. I hope, Gentleman, you are now
satisfied."</p>

<p>He then folded up my brief, and handed it to an officer of the
court, to whom he made a motion with his hand to return it to me. I
received it with a respectful bow of acknowledgment, and Mr. Knapp
threw himself back in his seat, and began playing with his
watch-chain, as much as to say, "the business is settled, I have
successfully done my duty, and saved my client;" and, so indeed he
had, for the foreman immediately pronounced the welcome verdict of
"Not Guilty." There is one circumstance to which my acquittal on
this occasion may be in a great measure imputed; namely, that I was
fortunately not known by any of the turnkeys or officers of the
court, who never fail when an old face appears, to give a private
intimation to the judge, if (which is very rare) he should not
himself recognise the party. I now applied to the court for the
articles taken from me, which the Recorder ordered to be restored;
but first expressed a wish to view them, saying to the
constable,</p>

<p>"Let me look at those articles, Mr. Bell, there is nothing
remarkable in them I suppose."</p>

<p>The malicious constable answered, "No, my lord, without it is
the scissors."</p>

<p>The Recorder, having minutely examined them, replied,</p>

<p>"I see nothing extraordinary in <i>them</i> neither, Mr. Bell,
except that they appear to be remarkable good ones&mdash;poo, poo,
let the young man have his property by all means:" on which the
fellow, evidently chagrined, delivered the whole into my hands.</p>

<p>As to the snuff-box, his Lordship observed, there could be no
doubt but it was the same which Mr. Imeson had lost, though he
could only speak to its identity, as being of the same pattern,
having bought it but a few days before the accident, and there
being no mark which he could know it by: he was, therefore, ordered
to retain it. I then bowed with gratitude to the court and jury,
and with respect to the auditors, and quitting the bar, had my
irons knocked off, and was received with open arms by my dear wife,
who had been waiting the issue in anxious suspense, accompanied by
my friend Bromley.</p>

<p>We all three returned to the prison, where I had left some
little matters, and every one was astonished at my acquittal. I
restored the borrowed snuff-box to my kind friend, not forgetting
to acknowledge its beneficial effects by a present to himself, and
a liberal treat to the whole ward. I afterwards sent for a coach,
in which myself, my wife, and old companion, were driven to my
lodgings in Duke's-court, Drury-lane; and, I need not add, that we
spent the remainder of the day in festivity, and heartfelt
satisfaction.</p>

<p>To account for my absence from home, my wife had informed the
landlord, that I had met with an accident while at a friend's house
a few miles from town, and could not be removed until I was
perfectly recovered. Notwithstanding I blessed Heaven for this
fortunate escape, which I had so little reason to expect, and
thought myself supremely happy in recovering my liberty; yet I have
ever since regretted that I was not then convicted, as there is
little doubt but the capital part of the charge would have been
done away with, and I should only have been transported for seven
years, consequently, at the period of my writing these Memoirs, I
should have had only a few months to serve before I became a
free-man; whereas the sequel will shew that I was in a short time
afterwards cast for death, and now find myself in the hopeless and
deplorable situation of a prisoner for life!</p>

<h2><a name="ch206" id="ch206"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p><i>Visit Mr. Bilger, an eminent Jeweller.&mdash;His Politeness,
and the Return I made for it.&mdash;Perfidy of a
Pawnbroker.&mdash;Obliged to decamp with Precipitation.</i>
</p>

<p>THE next adventure I shall have occasion to relate, more fully
confirms the justice of the remark, that the connexions formed by
persons during temporary confinement in a jail, commonly lead to
further acts of wickedness, and frequently entail on the parties a
more severe punishment than that which they have just escaped. This
was exactly my unhappy case and I now come to the most fatal era of
my eventful life.</p>

<p>In the same ward with myself were confined two brothers, very
genteel young men, who had been recently cast for death for
privately stealing some valuable rings, &amp;c., from the shop of a
Jeweller in Leadenhall-street. As a conformity of character, or
similarity of pursuits, is the strongest source of friendship, so
these persons and myself had become very intimately acquainted. In
the course of our frequent conversations on the subject with which
we were all three alike most conversant, the brothers informed me
that they had, like myself, made a successful tour of the
jewellers' shops in London; and on our comparing notes as to the
particular persons we had robbed, or attempted to rob, they pointed
out about half a dozen shops, which, it appeared, I had omitted to
visit, arising either from their making no display of their goods,
or from their being situated in private streets, where I had no
idea of finding any such trades. Though at that time neither they
nor myself entertained much hope of my acquittal, it was agreed
that in the event of my being so fortunate as to recover my
freedom, I should pay my respects to the several tradesmen I had so
overlooked; and I promised, in case I was successful, to make them
a pecuniary acknowledgment in return for their information. At the
moment of my joyful departure from Newgate, they accordingly
furnished me with a list of the shops in question, and gave me full
instructions and useful hints for my guidance therein. They
particularly pointed out Mr. Bilger, a goldsmith and jeweller of
the first eminence in Piccadilly. This gentleman, they assured me,
I should find, in the technical phrase, a <i>good flat</i>. They
advised me to bespeak a diamond ring, or similar article, and to
request a sight of some loose diamonds for the purpose of selecting
such stones as I might wish to have set, informing me that he was
generally provided with a large quantity, which he would not fail
to shew me, and that I might with ease purloin a good number of
them.</p>

<p>A day or two after my release, I made the prescribed
experiments, and was fortunate enough to succeed pretty well at
nearly every shop, but I reserved Mr. Bilger for my final essay, as
he was the principal object of consideration, and from whom I
expected to obtain the most valuable booty. On the day se'ennight
after my trial at the Old Bailey, I prepared in due form to pay him
a visit. About five o'clock in the evening, I entered his shop,
dressed in the most elegant style, having a valuable gold watch and
appendages, a gold eye-glass, &amp;c. I had posted my old friend
and aid-de-camp, Bromley, at the door, in order to be in readiness
to net as circumstances might require, and particularly to watch
the motions of Mr. Bilger and his assistants on my quitting the
premises. On my entrance Mrs. Bilger issued from a back-parlour
behind the shop, and politely inquiring my business, I told her I
wished to see Mr. Bilger; she immediately rang a bell, which
brought down her husband from the upper apartments. He saluted me
with a low bow, and handed me a seat. I was glad to find no other
person in the shop, Mrs. Bilger having again retired. I now assumed
the air of a Bond-street lounger, and informed Mr. Bilger that I
had been recommended by a gentleman of my acquaintance to deal with
him, having occasion for a very elegant diamond ring, and requested
to see his assortment. Mr. Bilger expressed his concern that he
happened not to have a single article of that description by him,
but if I could without inconvenience call again, he would undertake
in one hour to procure me a selection from his working-jeweller, to
whom he would immediately despatch a messenger. I affected to feel
somewhat disappointed, but looking at my watch, after a moment's
reflection, I said, "Well, Mr. Bilger, I have an appointment at the
Canon coffee-house, which requires my attendance, and if you will
without fail have the articles ready, I may probably look in a
little after six." This he promised faithfully to do, declaring how
much he felt obliged by my condescension; and I sauntered out of
the shop, Mr. Bilger attending me in the most obsequious manner to
the outer door. After walking a short distance, Bromley tapped me
on the shoulder, and inquired what conduct I meant next to pursue;
for he had viewed my proceedings through a glass-door in the shop,
and saw that I had not executed my grand design. I related to
Bromley the result of my conversation with Mr. Bilger, and added
that I meant to retire to the nearest public-house, where we could
enjoy a pipe and a glass of negus until the expiration of the hour
to which I had limited myself. We accordingly regaled ourselves at
a very snug house, nearly opposite Bilger's, until about half after
six, when I again repaired to the scene of action, leaving Bromley,
as at first, posted at the door. Mr. Bilger received me with
increased respect, and producing a small card box, expressed his
sorrow that his workman had only been enabled to send three rings
for my inspection, but that if they were not to my taste he should
feel honoured and obliged in taking my directions for having one
made, and flattered himself he should execute the order to my
satisfaction. I proceeded to examine the rings he produced, one of
which was marked sixteen guineas, another nine guineas, and the
third six guineas. They were all extremely beautiful, but I
affected to consider them as too paltry, telling Mr. Bilger that I
wanted one to present to a lady, and that I wished to have a ring
of greater value than the whole three put together, as a few
guineas would not be an object in the price. Mr. Bilger's son, who
was also his partner, now joined us, and was desired by his father
to sketch a draught in pencil of some fancy rings, agreeable to the
directions I should give him. The three rings I had viewed, were
now removed to the end of the counter next the window, and I
informed the young man that I wished to have something of a
cluster, a large brilliant in the centre, surrounded with smaller
ones; but repeated my desire that no expense might be spared to
render the article strictly elegant, and worthy a lady's
acceptance. The son having sketched a design of several rings on a
card, I examined them with attention, and appeared in doubt which
to prefer, but desired to see some loose diamonds, in order to form
a better idea of the size, &amp;c., of each ring described in the
drawing. Mr. Bilger, however, declared he had not any by him. It is
probable he spoke truth: or he might have lost such numbers by
shewing them, as to deter him from exhibiting them in future.
Without having made up my mind on the subject, I now requested to
see some of his most fashionable broaches or shirt-pins. Mr. Bilger
produced a shew-glass, containing a great variety of articles in
pearl, but he had nothing of the kind in diamonds. I took up two or
three of the broaches and immediately sunk a very handsome one
marked three guineas, in my coat sleeve. I next purloined a
beautiful clasp for a lady's waist, consisting of stones set in
gold, which had the brilliancy and appearance of real diamonds, but
marked only four guineas. I should probably have gone still deeper,
but at this moment a lady coming in, desired to look at some
ear-rings, and the younger Mr. Bilger immediately quitted his
father to attend upon her at the other end of the shop. It struck
me that now was my time for a decisive stroke. The card containing
the diamond rings, procured from the maker, lying very near the
shew-glass I was viewing, and many small articles irregularly
placed round about them, the candles not throwing much light upon
that particular spot, and Mr. Bilger's attention being divided
between myself and the lady, to whom he frequently addressed
himself, I suddenly took the three rings from the card, and
committed them to my sleeve to join the broach and lady's clasp;
but had them so situated that I could in a moment have released and
replaced them on the counter, had an inquiry been made for them. I
then looked at my watch, and observing that I was going to the
theatre, told Mr. Bilger that I would not trouble him any further,
as the articles before me were too tawdry and common to please me,
but that I would put the card of draughts in my pocket-book, and if
I did not meet with a ring of the kind I wanted before Monday or
Tuesday, I would certainly call again and give him final
directions. I was then drawing on my gloves, being anxious to quit
the shop while I was well; but Mr. Bilger, who seemed delighted
with the prospect of my custom, begged so earnestly that I would
allow him to shew me his brilliant assortment of gold watches that
I could not refuse to gratify him, though I certainly incurred a
great risk by my compliance. I, therefore, answered, "Really, Mr.
Bilger, I am loth to give you that unnecessary trouble, as I have,
you may perceive, a very good watch already, in point of
performance; though it cost me a mere trifle, only twenty guineas;
but it answers my purpose as well as a more valuable one. However,
as I may probably, before long, want an elegant watch for a lady, I
don't care if I just run my eye over them." Mr. Bilger replied,
that the greater part of his stock were fancy watches adapted for
ladies, and he defied all London united to exhibit a finer
collection. He then took from his window a shew-glass, containing
about thirty most beautiful watches, some ornamented with pearls or
diamonds, others elegantly enamelled, or chased in the most
delicate style. They were of various prices, from thirty to one
hundred guineas, and the old gentleman rubbing his hands with an
air of rapture, exclaimed, "There they are, Sir; a most fashionable
assortment of goods; allow me to recommend them; they're all
a-going, Sir&mdash;all a-going." I smiled inwardly at the latter
part of this speech, and thought to myself, "I wish they were
going, with all my heart, along with the diamond rings." I
answered, they were certainly very handsome, but I would defer a
minute inspection of them till my next visit, when I should have
more time to spare. These watches were ranged in exact order, in
five parallel lines, and between each watch was placed a gold seal
or other trinket appertaining to a lady's watch. It was no easy
matter, therefore, to take away a single article without its being
instantly missed, unless the economy of the whole had been
previously deranged. I contrived, however, to displace a few of the
trinkets, on pretence of admiring them, and ventured to secrete one
very rich gold seal marked six guineas. I then declared I could
stay no longer, as I had appointed to meet a party at the theatre;
but that I would certainly call again in a few days, and lay out
some money in return for the trouble I had given.</p>

<p>Mr. Bilger expressed his thanks in the most respectful terms,
and waited upon me to the door, where he took leave of me with a
very low <i>congé, à la mode de France</i>, of which country he was
a native. I now put the best foot foremost, and having gained a
remote street, turned my head, and perceived Bromley at my heels,
who seized my hand, congratulating me on my success, and
complimenting me on the address I had shewn in this exploit; for he
had witnessed all that passed, and knew that I had succeeded in my
object, by the manner in which I quitted the shop. He informed me
that Mr. Bilger, had returned to his counter, and without attending
to the arrangement of the articles thereon, had joined his son who
was still waiting upon the lady, and that he, Bromley, had finally
left them both engaged with her.</p>

<p>Having thus happily achieved this adventure we returned to my
lodgings, where I displayed the booty I had made, and gratified
Bromley with a couple of guineas for his trouble, which fully
satisfied him, as I did not take him with me on terms of equal
partnership. The next morning, Saturday, on reviewing the articles,
my wife was so much pleased with one of the rings, (a beautiful
ruby, surrounded with rose-diamonds, price six guineas,) which
exactly fitted her fore-finger, that I suffered her to retain it
for wearing on extraordinary occasions; and I myself determined to
keep the one marked sixteen guineas, (which was a double rowed
brilliant half hoop,) for my little finger. As to the nine-guinea
ring, (which was composed of brilliants, having a space for hair in
the centre,) I sold it immediately, together with the gold seal, to
a Jew-receiver, with whom I had frequent dealings. The broach I
also took a fancy to for my own wear, and the gold clasp I
presented to my wife. In the evening of this day I visited my
friends in Newgate, (the two brothers,) and acknowledged the
service they had rendered me by a suitable present, besides
regaling the whole ward with a treat of ale and porter.</p>

<p>In the interval between my discharge from confinement, and my
visit to Mr. Bilger, I one day went to the shop of a pawn-broker,
in Brydges-street, Covent-garden, for the purpose of pledging some
seals, rings, and other trinkets, which I had purloined at the
several shops to which the brothers had recommended me. I had
frequently pledged similar articles at this shop, as well as many
others, because I could get nearly fifty per cent more by that
means than a common receiver would give for the same goods, and I
afterwards sold the duplicates among my acquaintances, or to the
Jews, by which I gained a still further advance. I entered a
private box, as is usual with persons who wish to observe secrecy;
and the pawn-broker, whose name was Turner, coming himself to wait
on me, I produced my goods, demanding a certain sum upon them.</p>

<p>Mr. Turner having looked over the articles, pulled out the
sliding shutter which extends across the counter, so as to obscure
the customer from the view even of a person in the adjoining box,
and having taken this precaution, he spoke to me, in a very
respectful manner, to the following effect: "Sir, I hope you will
excuse what I am going to say; but having observed that you
frequently pledge similar goods to these at our shop, which are
afterwards taken out by other persons, I take for granted you are
in the habit of selling the duplicates; it is not my wish to be
impertinently curious, but my reason for asking, is, that if I am
right in my conjecture, I conceive you might as well give me the
opportunity of purchasing them as a stranger. I am ready to give
you a fair price, as I have opportunities of disposing of such
goods in the way of trade, and without putting them in the window,
or exposing them at all. Or if you prefer selling them at once, I
will offer you the utmost farthing I can give, at a word, and save
both you and myself the trouble of a duplicate." All this he
uttered in a low but earnest voice, and with every appearance of
sincerity. Perceiving me to hesitate, he added with increased
emphasis, "Depend on it, Sir, I'll deal upon the square with you; I
don't mean to take the smallest advantage, I assure you." These
last words determined me. I thought it improbable that he could
have any motive for deceiving me, and knowing that many of the
pawnbrokers in London are men of the world, who, while they
preserve outwardly a fair reputation, are at the bottom arrant
receivers of stolen goods, I supposed this man to be one of them; I
therefore answered that he was not mistaken in his opinion; that I
was myself in the habit of dealing in such goods, and being
sometimes pressed for money, I was then obliged to pledge or sell a
few articles, to relieve a temporary inconvenience; and that,
relying upon his promises of fair dealing, I had no objection, when
such was the case, to give him an opportunity of becoming a
purchaser.</p>

<p>He thanked me for the favour, and desired I would set a price
upon the articles I had now brought. I did so, and he offered me at
once a sum equal to what I expected, though somewhat less than I
asked him. Having received the money agreed for, I departed, well
pleased with having formed so good a connexion. I only describe
this interview as explanatory of a circumstance I shall by and by
have occasion to relate.</p>

<p>Any body would suppose that I might have been satisfied with my
late success at Bilger and Son's, and it will hardly be credited
that I should have the temerity to pay them a second visit,
agreeably to the promise I gave Mr. Bilger at parting: but, such
was nevertheless the fact. On the Monday following the Friday on
which I robbed them, having occasion for a little ready money to
pay an instalment to my tailor, with whom I kept a running account,
I requested my wife to take the diamond-ring I had kept for my own
wear, and pledge it at Turner's for five guineas, while I myself
went with her ring to another shop, and borrowed three guineas on
it. I conceived there could be no danger attending this proceeding,
as there was nothing remarkable in either of the rings, and I had
the fullest conviction that the pawnbroker to whom I applied, was
actually such a character as from the conversation of Turner, I
doubted not the latter to be: besides, it was in my power at a
minute's warning to have redeemed both, and I intended so to do in
a few days. The next day (Tuesday,) I determined to re-visit Mr.
Bilger, against the advice both of my wife and Bromley, who
censured such a step as an act of downright madness, which indeed
it certainly was: but I was so infatuated as to think it possible
that as there was another party in the shop as well as myself, the
suspicion might have attached to her; or, that my appearance and
address would so far operate in my favour, as at least to leave
Bilger in doubt who to suspect: in which case, my calling again
exactly at the time I had promised, would certainly remove every
shadow of such doubt, and I might perhaps be enabled to obtain one
or more of the valuable watches Mr. Bilger had shewn me.</p>

<p>To make every thing secure I intended to take Bromley with me,
who could observe the reception I met with, and in the event of my
being detained on suspicion, I directed him to hasten to my wife
with the information, who was instantly to redeem the two rings we
had pledged, and then effectually conceal the whole of the stolen
articles beyond the reach of discovery; so that no property being
found on, or traced to me, I must inevitably have been discharged.
These precautions were certainly sufficient to prevent any ill
consequences, but still I shall ever condemn myself for so rash an
act. About six o'clock in the evening, myself and Bromley set out
on this ill-fated expedition. Arriving at Bilger's, I entered with
an air of confidence, and finding the son only in the shop, I
addressed him with a good-natured smile in these words: "Well, Sir,
you see I'm punctual to my promise: is your father within?" He
answered in the affirmative, with a mixture of surprise and doubt
in his countenance; then stepping backwards, he called Mr. Bilger,
saying in a significant tone, "Father, here is the gentleman come
about the diamond ring." Mr. Bilger then advancing, saluted me with
a formal coldness, which convinced me that I was suspected.
However, it was then too late to recede, so laying my hat upon the
counter, and drawing a stool, I said, with a familiar air, "Well,
Mr. Bilger, I have called to give you directions for making this
ring, but I must beg that you will spare no pains in the execution,
as I repeat that the price will not be an object; only tell me
candidly at what time you will undertake to have it ready, as I am
going out of town in a few days." He replied, that I might depend
on it by Saturday evening. "Very well," said I, "that will be time
enough." Mr. Bilger then desired his son to take down my
instructions, for which purpose the latter opened his day-book, and
I took from my pocket the card of draughts, in which I pointed out
the one I had determined on. Then describing minutely the various
particulars, the kind of shank, &amp;c.; the young man wrote what
he thought necessary, appearing to pay the strictest attention to
my directions, and concluded with requesting my name and address. I
answered (what first came into my head, as my only object now was
to get decently clear of the shop,) "Mr. Deakin, 13, Curzon-street,
May-fair." I next desired Mr. Bilger to shew me again his
assortment of lady's watches, as I intended to purchase one when
the ring was completed; but, the old gentleman replied with evident
embarrassment, that he really had none in the house, but that his
son should wait upon me with a selection, when the ring was
finished! I answered carelessly, "that will do very well, Mr.
Bilger. I hope, Sir, you will not fail to be punctual; let it be an
elegant article, and don't neglect to send the watches. I shall now
bid you good evening."</p>

<p>Then buttoning my coat, &amp;c., I advanced toward the door,
expecting every moment to be detained, or at least questioned about
the three diamond rings. Nothing of the sort, however, occurred.
Mr. Bilger attended me to the door with as much politeness, though
not quite the same warmth as at my first visit; and I was not at
all sorry when I found myself at a distance from the shop. My
watchful friend Bromley soon joined me, with the information that
Bilger had stood above a minute gazing after me before he closed
the door, and that he clearly perceived I had had a narrow escape.
Having satisfied myself by making the experiment, I now hastened
home to relieve the anxiety of my wife; and concluding I should
neither see or hear any more of Messrs. Bilger and Son, turned my
attention to new projects for "raising the wind."</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, calling at Turner's, the pawnbroker, to
dispose of some trifling articles, that person, after apologizing
for the liberty he was about to take, begged leave to ask if my
"good lady" had not pledged a diamond-ring with him a few days
before, for five guineas? Surprised at this question, I hesitated;
on which he continued, "I assure you, Sir, I have no impertinent
motive for the question, but a lady of my acquaintance having seen
the article, is very much in love with it; and, if it should be
yours, and that you are inclined hereafter to sell it, I should be
happy to purchase it for her. The lady who pledged it having
frequently come to redeem articles left by you, I concluded from
thence that she was your wife." As I was willing to be upon my
guard, I answered, that my wife had indeed several rings, and it
was possible he might be right in his conjecture, but I was
ignorant of her having pledged such an article; that I would,
however, make inquiry on the subject, and let him know the next
time I saw him. Having communicated this conversation to my wife,
she saw nothing extraordinary in it, as the ring was a very elegant
trinket, and would naturally excite the admiration of any lady. The
next day, I again called upon Turner, and told him that the ring he
mentioned was the property of my wife, but at present she had no
mind to part with it, and here the matter dropped.</p>

<p>Three or four days after this last interview, having been
successful at the theatres, and my purse being replenished, I
determined to redeem the ring pledged at Turner's, and taking the
duplicate with me, I entered one of the private boxes as usual,
from a back door in Russell-court, and calling to the shopman,
produced my ticket, and desired to have the ring. The lad took the
former out of my hand, and laid it on a shelf; then proceeded with
the business he was before engaged in, without offering to attend
to me. I thought this very odd, and seeing Turner himself at the
far end of the counter, writing duplicates for some women, and
pretending to be so much engaged as not to notice me, though I was
sensible he must, I began, as the phrase is, to <i>smell a rat</i>.
I then repeated my request to the boy, with some impatience, and a
louder voice, on which the latter went up to his master, and I
heard him whisper, "Sir, here's the gentleman come for the
diamond-ring." His master, without turning his head, or looking off
his book, (though he always used to pay the most eager attention to
me,) said something I could not hear; and the lad approaching the
box in which I stood, told me his master would be glad if I would
step round to the front door, (meaning the door of the public shop,
which opened into Brydges-street.) I was now more than ever
surprised, and convinced that mischief was intended me. However, as
in such cases, I was often too rash, and despised fear as
unbecoming an adventurer of my address and appearance, I answered,
"O by all means, my man, I'll go round;" which I immediately did;
but on entering the shop, I was surprised to find that Mr. Turner
had vanished. I then said to the boy, with a smile of gaiety, "Why,
my good lad, I don't see your master, now I've taken the trouble to
come here." The boy replied, "Sir, my master will wait upon you
directly; he's only gone backwards to speak to the servant."</p>

<p>This was enough for me. I no longer doubted that he was gone to
send for an officer; and that it was, therefore, high time for me
to make sail while I was well. I, therefore, appeared for a moment
satisfied with the boy's answer, but seeming suddenly to recollect
myself, I said to him, "My wife is at the door; I believe I may as
well ask her to step in." Then immediately opening the door, which
fell to with a pulley, I quitted the shop and turning the corner,
got into Russell-court, through which I ran with all my speed, nor
stopped till I found myself at a considerable distance, and out of
all danger. I then walked home by a circuitous route, and related
the adventure to my wife, who was, of course, seriously alarmed,
and joined with me in reprobating the treachery of the pawnbroker,
for whose perfidious conduct, after the assurances he had given me,
we were at a loss to account.</p>

</p>

<p>AS my person was well known to all the surrounding pawnbrokers,
and my real abode to many of them, myself and wife were under
considerable alarm at every knock we heard at the house-door that
even- ning; and it was my wife's earnest entreaty that I should the
next morning look out for a lodging in a remote part of the town,
where I might lie concealed for awhile until the affair had cooled.
Accordingly I went out with that intention at an early hour, and
engaged a first floor very neatly furnished, in Webber-row, St.
George's Fields; to which we removed with our effects, in the most
private manner, the very next day. As I had taken care that we were
not watched in our removal, we found ourselves freed from any
immediate anxiety in our new abode; but I was afraid to shew myself
at all in the neighbourhood of our late residence, nor could I
venture even to the theatres in quest of money. We, therefore,
continued domesticated until after Christmas; but finding the rent
we paid (fourteen shillings per week,) to come rather heavy upon
us, as I was getting nothing, but living on the little I had by me,
I determined to hire a small house in one of the new streets near
the Obelisk, and to purchase such articles of furniture as were
indispensable, whatever sacrifices I might make to enable me to do
so. I very soon met with a neat little house, in Gun-street, at the
low rent of five shillings a week. It consisted indeed of only two
rooms, one over the other, with a small kitchen behind, but was
sufficiently large for our purpose. I was so assiduous in this
undertaking, that in a few days I had purchased every necessary
article for our use, and we immediately entered on the premises. It
is true, having but little ready money, I was compelled on this
occasion to pledge my watch, chain, and seals, together with
several trinkets of my own and my wife's, and many articles of our
wearing apparel, but of the latter we had both a pretty ample
stock. We were then obliged to live as frugally as possible, and
during the whole month of January I never once stirred out of the
street we resided in, except on the following occasion. Being
anxious to see poor Bromley, whom I had not had an opportunity of
apprizing of our removal from Drury-lane, I determined to venture
out, and endeavour to find him at one of the houses I knew he
frequented in that neighbourhood: for this purpose I disguised
myself as much as I could, and going late in the evening to a
public-house in Parker's lane, I found a number of dissolute
characters of the lowest class, assembled there, but on looking
round saw no appearance of Bromley. Having drank a glass at the
bar, I was on the point of quitting the house to seek further, when
a girl of the town, of whom there were a number present, tapped me
on the shoulder, and, taking me aside, observed that she was
astonished at my madness in venturing to that quarter of the town,
considering the situation in which I stood, and the consequent risk
I incurred. This girl had formerly cohabited with Bromley, and had
by that means known me for some time. As I knew her to be incapable
of any bad design, I requested her to explain herself more fully.
She then said, that she had gone a few days before this to the shop
of Lane, a pawnbroker in Drury-lane, on some business of her own,
and that one of the shopmen inquired if she had lately seen Vaux?
desiring her, if she met with me, to caution me to keep out of the
way, as I was advertised, and very fully described in printed
hand-bills, circulated among the pawnbrokers, in which I stood
charged with robbing a jeweller's shop in Piccadilly; that being on
intimate terms with this shopman, she had obtained a sight of the
hand-bill in question, and had read with her own eyes a
confirmation of what the young man had told her.</p>

<p>She now repeated to me the tenor of the same, stating that a
reward of ten guineas was offered for my apprehension, and ten
guineas more on my conviction; that the articles stolen, consisting
of diamond-rings, &amp;c., were described, as was also my dress,
and person, in the minutest manner, not excepting even my whiskers,
eyes, and teeth, the watch and appendages I wore, the mourning-ring
on my finger, eye-glass, &amp;c. She, therefore, strongly exhorted
me to avoid this part of the town, in which I was so well known;
and promised if she saw Bromley, to direct him to a place I named,
at which he would hear of me. Having gratified this well-meaning
woman with a small present, I returned home with all the speed I
could; and ruminating in my way on what I had heard, I was now
convinced beyond a doubt, that Bilger junior, at the time he
pretended to be taking directions of me for the ring I bespoke, was
actually intent upon taking a description of my person, &amp;c.,
which he wrote down in the book before him, in order that, should
his father's suspicions prove well founded, a proper search might
be made after me. This news was not likely to alleviate the anxiety
of my wife for my safety, or to encourage me in sallying forth with
the view of recruiting my finances, which were now at a very low
ebb.</p>

<p>At length, however, necessity compelled me to wave every
consideration, for every thing we could conveniently spare was in
pawn, including even my books, some of which were valuable. I,
therefore, dressed myself in my usual manner, and, on Tuesday
evening, the 31st of January 1809, left my home, with an intention
of trying my luck at one of the Theatres; but in my way thither, I
was induced to enter a shop, (namely, Sharp's, the razor-maker,
corner of Ludgate-hill,) of which I had conceived some hopes; and
fortune favoured me so far, that I obtained a booty of silver
fruit-knives, pencil-cases, pocket-books with instruments, &amp;c.,
which I estimated at four or five guineas. I was so pleased with
this success that I returned home, satisfied with my night's gain,
and gave up my former design of going to the Theatre. My wife was
agreeably surprised at my premature return; and, as it was then but
seven o'clock, I proposed to her that we should take a walk as far
as Blackfriars'-bridge, as she had of late been closely confined to
the house, and I conceived her health required air and exercise.
She immediately assented, and having locked up the house, we
proceeded towards the bridge; on arriving at which she would have
turned back, but I persuaded her to cross the water, and go as far
as the end of Fleet-street. We there entered a liquor-shop, and
took some refreshment; and my wife then earnestly pressed me to
return, for fear of meeting with some of the officers who might
know me; but I now entreated her to walk as far as Claremarket, as
I wished to see a young man who had promised to meet me, or to
leave a note for me at a certain public-house, which I had
sometimes frequented when I lived in that neighbourhood. I had, in
fact, intended to call there in my way to or from the theatre, in
order to settle a plan for accompanying this person and several
others, to a grand fight, which was to have taken place the next
day at Moulsey-hurst, between two celebrated pugilists, and at
which we expected to reap a plentiful harvest. The going to this
house was the maddest act I could possibly have committed, for the
Bow-street officers were in the habit of visiting it at all hours;
and several of them had seen me there at various times, dressed
exactly in the manner described in the hand-bills I have mentioned.
My wife, who appears to have had too sure a presentiment of what
the consequence would be, used every art to dissuade me from my
purpose, but in vain. I assured her that I would not stop five
minutes; and that to prevent danger, she herself should first enter
the house, and observe whether there were any officers in it, in
which event I could but retire without going in, and immediately
return home. Finding I was obstinately determined on this rash
step, she accompanied me, and, on arriving near the house, I sent
her in to make observations. The landlord (who had himself been an
old thief), received her very courteously; and inquiring for me,
she privately asked him if there was any danger of the officers
coming there? To which he answered in the negative, and assured her
I might with safety make my appearance. She accordingly gave me the
signal, and I entered the public tap-room, in which I found about
twenty notorious characters, assembled at different tables, some
drinking and smoking, others employed in gambling with cards,
&amp;c. The young man above-mentioned had left a short note, which
the landlord now put into my hand; in which I was requested to meet
him the next morning at a certain time and place, adding that he
had engaged a chaise, and that a seat was reserved for me. My wife
now again pressed me to return after taking a glass at the bar; but
my evil genius prevailed, and I stipulated that I should smoke one
pipe of tobacco, and would then willingly retire. I accordingly
took a seat, placing my wife between myself and my old acquaintance
George W&mdash;k&mdash;n, who invited us to join him. I was
situated with my back to the door of the room, which opened into a
passage leading to the street. I occupied the very end of the seat
or bench, which had an elbow, on which I rested my right arm, and
there were at the same table three or four other persons besides
our party. I had scarcely lighted my pipe when I observed two men,
(strangers to me), enter the room, and whisper with the landlord;
and I thought I perceived the landlord while answering them, to
glance his eye upon me; but I only mention this by-the-by, as I had
the fullest conviction of the landlord's integrity, and the
strangers had not the least appearance of officers; consequently,
the circumstance did not at all alarm me. I had been about half an
hour in the house, and was on the point of taking my leave, when I
heard the room-door pushed open, and, as is natural in such cases,
I involuntarily turned my head; when, to my utter confusion and
alarm, I perceived two officers enter the room. As I thought it
possible I might escape their notice, I pulled my hat over my eyes,
and turning my head towards my wife and friend, on my left-hand,
pretended to be in earnest conversation with them; but how can I
express my feelings, when the officers walked immediately up to me,
as naturally as if they had been sitting in my company the whole
evening; and one of them looking me full in the face, said, "Mr.
Vaux, we want you!" With as much composure as I could assume, I
answered that he was mistaken in addressing me, for that was not my
name. The fellow replied that he was certainly right, but begged
that I would step out with him into the passage, and he would
explain himself more fully. I was so weak (or rather so confounded
with surprise) as to comply with this request; and I was no sooner
in the passage, and the tap-room door closed, than the two ruffians
laid hold of me, one on each side, and hurried me away with the
greatest impetuosity.</p>

<p>Having got a few yards from the house, they stopped to view me
by the light of a lamp, and one of them having attentively surveyed
my features (probably to compare them with the advertisement) said
to his fellow, "I'm sure we are right, Jack; he answers the
description; come along." As they were conducting me to St.
Martin's Watch-house, they put several questions to me, respecting
my knowledge of a jeweller's shop in Piccadilly, my being tried at
the Old Bailey, in November sessions, &amp;c.; all which were of
course unavailing, as I denied any knowledge of their meaning, but
which too well convinced me that they had a thorough knowledge of
my person and character, acquired no doubt from the treacherous
information of some of my dissolute acquaintances. One of them
observed, that if they had not met with me this night, they should
have done so the next day at the fight, so that it had only
prevented them from seeing the battle: perhaps, they only surmised
that I should have gone there, it being the custom for most of the
London thieves to attend such spectacles; but I have sometimes
thought my intention of going was communicated to them, either by
the person I was to have accompanied, or by the landlord who
delivered me his open note on the subject. The other observed, that
I had made a good thing of it at the Haymarket the preceding
summer; adding, "We wondered who the devil it was, that was so busy
there; we did not know you so well then as we do now, or we should
have spoiled your sport."&mdash;The fact was, that these two
vagabonds were on constant duty every night, inside of that
theatre; and I, consequently, knew them well, long before this
fatal rencontre; but I always took care to shun them, and had never
excited their suspicion, as I was not once during the whole season,
detected in the course of my operations at that house.</p>

<p>We now arrived at the watch-house, where they proceeded to
search me closely, but found nothing that had any relation to the
present charge; and I must not omit that their first attention was
directed to my little finger, no doubt in search of the mourning
ring, mentioned in the hand-bills; but the said ring was at this
time deposited as a pledge for the loan of one pound at a certain
pawnbroker's, and I had on, in lieu thereof, a plain gold ring of
trifling value; this they examined, and finding (to use their
words) that there were "no letters on it," they suffered me to
retain it. I happened unluckily to have on, this night, the very
same dress I wore when I visited Mr. Bilger, namely, a black coat
and waistcoat, blue pantaloons, Hessian boots, and the same hat,
which was remarkable, being in the extreme of the newest fashion.
The only variation was, that I had neither the gold watch,
eye-glass, or mourning ring, about me, nor had I any powder in my
hair; and I had on over my other clothes a brown great-coat.</p>

<p>After searching me, they gave me in charge to the
watch-house-keeper, and desiring to know what name I chose to give
in, as I denied being called Vaux, I assured them my name was James
Lowe, this being the name of my much-loved grandfather, and the
first that occurred to me. In this name I was therefore entered in
the charge-book, and, having told the keeper that they should call
for me in the morning, they departed. When left to ruminate on my
now hopeless condition, nothing affected me so much as the distress
my poor wife must suffer, on my being thus torn from her, and what
heightened my affliction, was, the consciousness, that had I
listened to her affectionate advice, I should probably have avoided
this misfortune, and been at that moment happy in her society, by
my own fire-side: but mature reflection convinced me, that, my time
being come, it was impossible to escape the fate to which I was
born, and destined from the moment of that birth.&mdash;I,
therefore, bowed with resignation to a fate, which by my vicious
conduct I had certainly merited; and applied for consolation to a
pipe and a jug of ale, which I was permitted to send for, and which
indulgence I compensated by liberally treating the keeper and his
wife, according to the established usage of such places.</p>

<p>I afterwards learnt that my wife had fainted immediately on my
apprehension, and continued for some minutes in violent hysterics,
on recovering from which our friend W&mdash;k&mdash;n had kindly
conducted her home, and consoled her at parting with the assurance
that he would not sleep till he had found out to what place I was
conveyed, and done all in his power to render my condition as
tolerable as circumstances would admit. But his inquiries were
ineffectual, and it was not till the following day, that he could
obtain an interview with me.</p>

<p><i>Discover that I have been betrayed.&mdash;Examined at
Bow-street, and committed for Trial.&mdash;Sent to
Newgate.&mdash;Prepare for my Defence.&mdash;My Trial and
Conviction.</i>
</p>

<p>ABOUT an hour after the officers had left me, they returned to
the watch-house, bringing in prisoner, a well-dressed gentleman in
a state of ebriety, accompanied by several of his friends, who it
seemed, had been taken in custody for riotous conduct at the
Haymarket theatre. As soon as they had given charge of this person,
and again withdrawn, the gentleman, whose friends had also taken
their leave, seated himself near the fire, and entered into
conversation with me on the subject of his apprehension. He
informed me, that having in the beginning of the evening had a
quarrel with another gentleman in the boxes, and their altercation
disturbing the audience, he had been taken into custody by these
officers as the aggressor; but that having apologized for his
conduct, and made his peace with his opponent, he had been
liberated, and the officers had suddenly quitted him; that about
ten o'clock, however, to his great surprise, the two rascally
constables (as he termed them,) had again apprehended him, under
colour of the original charge, and conveyed him to the watch-house;
and that in their way, they stated that they should have done so on
his first apprehension, but that they were suddenly sent for to the
other end of the town, for the express purpose of taking a
notorious thief, of whom they had received information!</p>

<p>The gentleman here continued, (little supposing he was speaking
to the identical person,) "some d&mdash;&mdash;d house-breaker, or
highwayman, I suppose. I don't know who the rascal was." The reader
may be sure I took no pains to inform him; but commiserating his
case, and condemning the base conduct of the officers, we conversed
together on indifferent subjects for about an hour, and were then
shewn to separate beds in the same room, where we were locked up
till morning. It now appeared evident that I had been betrayed; but
by whom, I am to this day ignorant; sometimes suspecting the
landlord; at others the young man I have before mentioned; and
sometimes, one of the company who sat at table with me; as I was
afterwards informed that the whole room being much alarmed at my
sudden apprehension, and the manner in which it took place, some
one remarked that I must certainly have been villanously betrayed.
Upon which this man (whose name was Bill White, otherwise,
Conky-beau,) immediately changed colour, and said, "I hope nobody
suspects me, I certainly did leave the room, but it was only for a
few minutes, in order to get a little tobacco at the next shop." At
all events, there must have been much expedition used, for I was
not above half an hour in the house, and the distance from thence
to the Haymarket theatre is at least a mile. Indeed the officers
confessed to me afterwards, that I had been <i>sold</i>, (as the
phrase is,) but declared that no bribe should induce them to
disclose the party.</p>

<p>The ensuing morning, about ten, the officers conducted me to
Bow-street, where Mr. Justice Graham presided. On being put to the
bar, I observed Mr. Bilger, senior, and the perfidious pawnbroker,
in waiting; the former viewed me with attention, and seemed
immediately convinced of my identity, of which he informed the
magistrate. Having then stated the particulars of his charge,
against me, (which I need not here repeat,) the pawnbroker produced
the fatal ring, stating that he received it from a woman, whom I
afterwards acknowledged to be my wife; he also produced a pearl and
amethyst broach, set in gold, which he deposed to purchasing from
me among some other articles of the like nature. Mr. Bilger swore
that he believed the former to be his property, and the working
jeweller, who had supplied the three rings for my inspection, swore
positively to its being one of them; as to the broach, Mr. Bilger
would not positively swear, but fully believed it to be the one he
lost.</p>

<p>In this, however, he was mistaken; for I have already stated
that I kept that broach for my own wear, and it was at this moment
in pledge for one pound in the Borough; but I had, a few days
previous to my robbing Mr. Bilger, purloined, among other trinkets,
from a shop in the city, a broach so exactly similar, that on
comparing the two together, I was in doubt which to retain; but the
pearls, in Bilger's, being rather larger, I preferred the latter,
and disposed of the other to Turner, as he had truly said. When
asked if I had any defence to offer, I merely answered that I was
not the person, having never seen Mr. Bilger or his shop in my
life. Mr. Graham observed, the case was so clear that he should
immediately commit me; but having understood that many jewellers,
&amp;c., who had been robbed, were in attendance to identify me, he
inquired for them; the officers, however, stated that none were
present, except a shopman of Mr. Chandler in Leicester-fields, who
had been a considerable sufferer; but on this young man viewing me,
he declared I was not the person who had been at his master's shop;
in which, by-the-by, he was egregiously mistaken. The magistrate
then committed me for trial, on Mr. Bilger's charge; and ordered
that I should be brought up again on that day se'ennight, (the 8th
of February,) in order that the different shop-keepers might have
notice to attend. I was now conveyed to Tothill-fields Bridewell,
where I continued a week. My first object was to establish a
communication with my wife; but I was afraid of suffering her to
visit me, lest she might have been detained as an accomplice. She,
however, sent her sister to me daily, who brought me every needful
requisite for my use and comfort in the prison; and among the rest,
a change of apparel of a very different kind from that in which I
was apprehended. Having put on these clothes, I sent the others
back by the bearer; and the same day, a barber attending, whom I
had sent for to shave me, I requested him to cut off my whiskers,
and to crop my hair close. He did so, and I now cut so different a
figure, that no person could possibly identify me, unless
intimately acquainted with my features. Had I been enabled to take
these measures before I appeared at Bow-street, it is probable Mr.
Bilger would not have ventured to swear to me; but unfortunately
they were adopted too late to render me any essential service. When
the officers came to the prison, and saw the metamorphose I had
undergone, they were, however, highly enraged; charged the turnkeys
with gross neglect of duty, and want of vigilance in suffering the
means to be admitted, and threatened to represent the circumstances
to the magistrate. I laughed heartily at their chagrin, and said
all I could to heighten their vexation. On the day appointed, I was
brought up for re-examination; but it seemed the tradesmen who were
expected, had not thought it worth their while to attend, for none
made their appearance.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham viewed me with evident surprise, demanding why I was
so differently dressed, and what I had done with my whiskers[*]. I
answered, that I wore whatever I found most convenient to myself,
and as to whiskers, I never had any. His Worship stared at this
assertion, and declared, that when he first examined me, I had very
large whiskers, and my hair dressed in the fashionable mode.
"However," added he, "I see through your design; but it has been
executed too late, and this stratagem will not now serve your
turn." I was then finally committed to Newgate, as the Session was
to commence on that day week (the 15th). My unhappy wife was
waiting the issue of my examination, in the neighbourhood of the
public office, and on learning the result, took coach, and was at
the door of Newgate as soon as myself. The officers who escorted me
having retired, both my wife and I were very kindly received by the
principal turnkey, who instantly recognised us as Mr. and Mrs.
Hardy, and expressed his concern at my so soon becoming again an
inmate of Newgate.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The public papers, in describing my second
examination, had the following paragraph. "The prisoner, on his
first examination, was dressed in the most fashionable style; but
he was now completely metamorphosed, being dressed in a drab
great-coat, jockey-boots, and a Belcher handkerchief, so as to have
the appearance of a stage-coachman!"</p>
]

<p>He then ordered me to have a light iron put on; and requesting
to know what ward I wished to go into, I chose the same I had
before been a member of, and to this room my wife accompanied me.
After receiving the compliments of such of the prisoners as were
before my fellow-lodgers, (among whom were the two brothers,) all
of whom vied with each other in contributing to our accommodation,
we partook of some tea; and having been a fortnight separated from
my beloved wife, I would not suffer her to quit me until the next
morning.</p>

<p>I had now but a few days to prepare for my approaching trial;
and though I entertained no hopes of escaping conviction, I
determined to employ a counsel; and who so proper (thought I,) as
my good friend Mr. Knapp, who had so adroitly brought me off on a
late occasion. I, therefore, drew a brief, in which I dwelt
strongly on some particular points both of law and fact, and
enclosed it, with the customary fee, in a letter to that gentleman,
reminding him of my being his client in November session, and
trusting he would do all in his power to extricate me from my
present embarrassment. Mr. Knapp assured my wife that I might
depend on his best exertions, and I now waited with patience for
the event. My affectionate partner was unremitting in her attention
to me, being never absent but when she had occasion to look into
our affairs at home, and her sister having undertaken the care of
our house till my fate was determined, she slept with me every
night, as I had reason to fear I should soon be removed to a place
where I could not have this indulgence. It was something singular
that my poor friend Bromley, whom I had not seen for two months
before, was brought into Newgate the very day after myself, being
committed on a capital charge of house-breaking. Being, however,
unable to pay the fees required on the master's side, where I was
situated, he was obliged to put up with the common side, as it is
termed; but the two yards being contiguous, I had an opportunity of
seeing him every day.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the 15th of February, 1809, I was taken down to the
sessions-house for trial; and four persons having been successively
tried for capital offences, all of whom were convicted, I was next
put to the bar, and stood indicted "for feloniously stealing, on
the 9th of December, &amp;c., a double-rowed brilliant half-hoop
ring, value £16.16s.; a diamond ring for hair, value £9.9s.; a rose
diamond and ruby ring, with serpent-chased shank, value £6.6s.; and
a pearl and amethyst broach, value £2.2s., the goods of Matthias
Bilger the elder, and Matthias Bilger the younger, privately in
their shop." The reader will observe that I was here indicted upon
a certain act of parliament, which makes it a capital offence to
steal "goods, wares, or merchandise, to the value of five
shillings, privately in a shop." My indictment having been read
over, I looked round for Mr. Knapp, whom I expected to have found
prepared with his brief; but not observing him among the other
counsellors, I inquired of the turnkeys near me, who informed me
that he was not in court. I then requested of the judge that my
trial might be deferred, on account of the absence of my counsel.
The court inquiring who was my counsel, I answered, Mr. Knapp; upon
which Mr. Gurney, another counsellor, rising from his seat, said,
"My lord, I am authorized to plead for Mr. Knapp." This satisfied
me, not doubting but Mr. Gurney had my brief, and would do all in
his power; and I suffered the trial to proceed. The indictment
having been read as I have before described, to my no small
surprise, Mr. Raine, the counsellor who had been retained by my
prosecutors, rose, and proceeded to state the case to the jury; in
doing which, according to custom, he gave so clear a view of the
facts attending my offence, and so artfully and eloquently coloured
the whole, that I saw the jury had more than half convicted me
already, and would only listen to the subsequent evidence as a
requisite matter of form. The counsel concluded his statement with
this observation; "If, gentlemen, these facts are clearly proved to
you in evidence, (as I persuade myself they will be,) no doubt can
remain in your minds as to the verdict you will give."</p>

<p>He then proceeded to examine the witnesses. Mr. Bilger, senior,
deposed what the reader is already in possession of, with these
additions; that, a few minutes after my quitting the shop, he
missed the articles named in the indictment; and that having, on my
second visit, received my final instructions for a ring, and the
address I have before mentioned, he went himself next day to
Curzon-street, and found No. 13 to be an empty house! Mr. Bilger
having concluded, and Mr. Gurney not offering to cross-examine him,
conformable to the suggestions in my brief, and as I fully expected
he would, I was extremely surprised, and was soon afterwards
convinced that he had not received any brief at all, or had any
grounds to plead upon. I, therefore, requested to ask Mr. Bilger a
question, namely, "Why he did not apprehend me on the Tuesday
night, on which he swears I came the second time to his shop, after
having missed the property on the preceding Friday, and suspected
me for it?" <i>Ans.</i> "My lord, he had so much the appearance of
a gentleman that I thought I might be mistaken. He was very
differently dressed then from what he is now. He wore whiskers, and
an eye-glass, and was very nicely powdered[*]. My son went to the
door in order to get a constable, but he observed an accomplice."
(What Mr. Bilger meant by this last assertion, or what he would
deduce from it, I have no idea.)</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Subjoined to the report of my trial, in the
public prints, was this remark. "The prisoner, on his trial, had
left off his false whiskers, his powdered head-dress, and his
eye-glass, and appeared in a loose great-coat and silk
handkerchief!!" Indeed there were many similar pieces of wit at my
expense, and some compliments paid me on the dexterity with which I
exercised my vocation.]</p>

<p>The next evidence was that of Turner the pawnbroker; and I had
in my brief given such hints, that I hoped Mr. Knapp would have
effectually put this fellow out of countenance, by making him
confess that he had, at his own request, repeatedly bought such
things of me. But here Mr. Gurney was still silent, and I saw that
it would be useless for me to ask Turner any questions. The
working-jeweller was then called to depose to the ring, which he
did in the strongest terms. Mr. Gurney barely asked him, if he
could undertake to swear that he had not made rings exactly similar
for other shops? He replied, that he was positive it was one of the
three which he sent to Mr. Bilger on the 9th of December. Next came
the scoundrel who took me, George Donaldson, a constable of St.
Martin's parish; who stated that himself and Smith, one of the
Bow-street patrole, from information they had received, apprehended
me at the Butchers' Arms in Clare-market, in company with a great
many notorious thieves.</p>

<p>The evidence for the prosecution being now closed, Mr. Gurney
inquired of Mr. Bilger, senior, how many partners he had; who
answered none but his son. Then, what other persons were in the
shop, (meaning assistants,) besides his son and himself, when he
lost his property? <i>Ans.</i> "Only a porter, who was cleaning
some plate at the further end of the counter, at some distance from
where the prisoner stood." All that Mr. Gurney, therefore, said or
asked, any other person might have said without reference to a
brief; and having put these simple questions, or at least put them
in a simple and careless manner, Mr. Gurney sat himself down. The
last question, indeed, was of a most important nature, and if
properly handled, and enforced with becoming spirit, would, I have
little doubt, have rendered me the most essential service. To
explain my meaning, I must briefly expound a point of law, with
which nine readers out of ten may be unacquainted.</p>

<p>The Act, under which I was indicted, provides, or is interpreted
to mean, that where there are two or more persons employed as
shopmen, &amp;c., it is not sufficient for one alone to attend upon
the prisoner's trial; but that every one, if there was a dozen,
must personally appear, to swear that he or she did not see or
suspect the prisoner to commit the act of robbery; because the law
(always favourable to the culprit,) presumes, that if one person
out of the whole number is absent, that very person might possibly
have suspected the prisoner; and then such suspicion, however
slight, if confessed, proves that the robbery was not effected so
privately as to come within the meaning of the Act; consequently,
there is an end of the capital part of the charge, and the prisoner
can only be transported for seven years.</p>

<p>The reader will see, in the next Chapter, my reason for being
thus particular in this explanation. The judge now summed up the
evidence, and what was most extraordinary, I was not even called on
for my defence; so much were the court prejudiced against me, from
the eloquent opening of the learned counsel, the clear and decisive
evidence of the witnesses; and, perhaps, (above all,) from some
little private intimation they had received of my real character
and past life. However, as I felt that no defence I could make, was
likely to prevent my conviction, I was not much concerned on the
occasion; and the jury after two minutes' consideration returned
the fatal verdict of "Guilty." This verdict was no sooner
pronounced, than the villain Donaldson, standing up in the
witness-box, said, "My lord, I think it my duty to inform the court
what I know of the prisoner at the bar. I have been given to
understand that he is a very old offender, and that he has been but
a few months returned from Botany-Bay!" At this malicious address,
there was a general murmur of indignation throughout the whole
court; and Mr. Gurney (to do him justice,) rose with much warmth,
saying, "Mr. Donaldson, you ought to be ashamed of yourself for
having made such a disclosure; you acknowledge you only have this
circumstance from hearsay, and had you known it to be true, after
the prisoner being capitally convicted, it is most shameful and
unmanly conduct of you to mention it." The malicious rascal was
justly confounded at this rebuff, and sneaked away amidst the
execrations of the auditors.</p>

<p>After my conviction I was double-ironed, and detained in the
dock until the evening, my trial having occupied about two hours;
and at eight o'clock, I was escorted to the press-yard, and locked
up in one of the condemned cells. My poor wife remained in the ward
of the prison, to which I belonged, until she saw me pass by, and I
had only time to console her in a few words through the bars of the
window, and take leave of her till the morning.</p>

<p><i>Account of my Companion and Fellow-sufferer in the condemned
Cells.&mdash;His unhappy Fate.&mdash;I receive Sentence of
Death.&mdash;Am reprieved, and soon afterwards sent on board the
Hulks.&mdash;Some Account of those Receptacles of human Misery.</i>
</p>

<p>BESIDES the four men convicted the same day as myself, there
were in the cells several others who had been cast for death the
preceding session; and, the recorder's report not having yet been
made, they still remained under sentence, ignorant of the fate
which awaited them, but they were in expectation of its being
decided every succeeding levee-day. It is customary to confine two
condemned prisoners in each cell, and I was destined to be the
companion of a man named Nicholls, his former bed-fellow having
suffered about a week previous to my conviction. On the turnkeys,
who attended me, opening the door of his cell, the unhappy man
(Nicholls,) was discovered on his knees, with a book in his hand,
and evidently a prey to doubt and terror My conductors apologized
for disturbing him, saying, they had only brought him a companion,
and hoped he would find consolation in my society. Poor Nicholls
answered in broken accents, "My God! I was a little
alarmed,&mdash;I heard the keys coming,&mdash;I thought it was the
report.&mdash;What?&mdash;do you expect it to-night?" The turnkeys
replied, that from the lateness of the hour, it was not probable;
but begged him to compose himself, and hope for the best. They then
re-locked the doors, and left us. This unfortunate person had been
convicted of selling forged bank-notes, through the treachery of a
man, who, to save himself, had given information, and betrayed him
by a signal to the police-officers, at the moment of the
negotiation taking place. As he was known to have carried on this
illegal and dangerous traffic to a great extent in the town of
Birmingham, where he resided, the Bank were determined to make an
example of him; particularly as he had obstinately refused to save
his own life by disclosing, as he could have done, most important
information on the subject, so as to lead to the detection of the
fabricators. This being the case of Nicholls, he had no hope of
mercy being extended to him; and was consequently in hourly dread
of the awful fiat which was to seal his doom, and consign him to a
shameful and premature death. On being left alone with him, I
forgot for a moment my own situation, and feeling for that of my
ill-fated companion, whose case I already knew, I exerted myself to
console and sooth him; not by raising in him hopes for which I knew
there was no foundation, but by exhorting him to look forward to
"another and a better world;" to comfort himself with the
reflection that his crime, (though punished with death on account
of its injurious tendency in a commercial country,) was not in a
moral sense, or in the eye of God, of so black a nature as to
preclude him from the hope of mercy at that awful tribunal "before
which the judges of this world must themselves be tried." By these
and the like suggestions, I so far succeeded as to compose him
pretty much; and having undressed ourselves, we went to bed. He
then requested me to read a few chapters to him, and earnestly
asked my opinion on some particular passages in the New Testament,
which applied to his situation, and of the real meaning of which he
anxiously wished to be resolved. We had read and reasoned on these
topics until St. Paul's clock struck ten, and were on the point of
composing ourselves to sleep, that "balm of hurt minds," when we
were alarmed by the rattling of keys, and the sound of voices. I
endeavoured to calm the agitation of Mr. Nicholls, by supposing
that another unhappy man had been convicted, and was about to be
introduced to the cells; but he declared it must be the report, and
fell on his knees before the cell-door. The footsteps approaching,
our door was slowly unlocked, and the distressing agony of my
companion was now indescribable. Mr. Newman, the jailor, entered as
quietly as possible, and taking Nicholls by the hand, while he
himself was evidently affected, he said,</p>

<p>"Mr. Nicholls,&mdash;the report has been made, and&mdash;(here
he would fain have paused,) I am sorry to inform you it has been
unfavourable." <i>Nicholls.</i> "Lord, have mercy on me! God's will
be done! I expected it, Mr. Newman,&mdash;it is no more than I
expected.&mdash;When is it,&mdash;to suffer, Mr. Newman?"</p>

<p>The latter replied, "on Wednesday next." <i>Nicholls.</i> "I
could have wished, Mr. Newman, for a little longer time,&mdash;I'm
not prepared to die,&mdash;I have some worldly affairs to
settle,&mdash;but,&mdash;God help me!&mdash;I hope for more mercy
from Him than the gentlemen of the bank have shewn me."</p>

<p>Mr. Newman then assuring him of every attention in his power,
commended him to my care, and took a tender leave of us both,
promising to see Nicholls again in the morning. The reader will
easily perceive I had not the prospect of a very agreeable night
before me; my own situation was deplorable enough, but the distress
of my unfortunate bed-fellow overpowered every other consideration
but that of pity and grief for him. I had now my task to go through
again, and to enforce all I repeated with greater energy and
stronger assurances. At length, exhausted by contending passions,
poor Nicholls fell asleep, and I had then recourse to my philosophy
for self-consolation.</p>

<p>The next day, Mr. Newman requested, as a favour, that I would
continue to bear the unfortunate Nicholls company during the week
he had to live, and in this request the latter also joined; so that
I could not without inhumanity refuse to comply, and in this
melancholy interval I omitted no opportunity of contributing to his
comfort. The night before his execution, I also, by his own desire,
sat up with him: a very worthy and devout man, of his acquaintance,
accompanied by two other friends, also attended him; and the
greater part of the night was passed in reading, exhortation, and
singing hymns. Poor Nicholls was, however, in a very low and
desponding state, and evidently dreaded the approach of death.
About three o'clock he was advised to lie down, and sunk into a
slumber from which he did not wake till summoned by the keeper
about six to descend to the press-yard, the sheriffs, &amp;c.,
being shortly expected. I now took a solemn farewell of him, and
was removed to another cell. At eight o'clock the doleful sound of
the tolling bell announced the awful ceremony, and he was a few
minutes afterwards launched into eternity; a woman named Margaret
Barrington, for forging and uttering a seaman's will, suffering
with him. The fate of this unhappy man, who was of a most
inoffensive and gentle disposition, and left a numerous family to
bewail his loss, affected me much.</p>

<p>I had now a new companion assigned me, a young man about my own
age, who was convicted the day after myself, under what is called
"Lord Ellenborough's Act." His crime was shooting at a person who
had attempted to apprehend him in the act of robbery; but his
pistol flashed in the pan, and no injury whatever had taken place.
However, the nature of the offence excluded him also from any hopes
of mercy, so that I had the fortune to be placed in a second
unpleasant situation, and probably for a number of weeks. As to
myself, I had no reason to doubt of being reprieved, very few
persons suffering death at that time of day, except for most
heinous crimes, or robbery attended with acts of violence. This
young man, 'tis true, was a much more tolerable companion than his
predecessor; he was always chearful and easy; declaring (although
he expected to suffer,) that, as he had never seriously injured
man, woman, or child, he was not afraid to die; but rather happy at
the prospect of being released from a troublesome world. He had
formerly been transported, but made his escape from the hulks; and
the miseries he had witnessed and endured on board those horrid
receptacles, he asserted to be such that he preferred death to a
reprieve, which might subject him to years of similar
suffering.</p>

<p>About eight days after my conviction, I was surprised at being
summoned to the main-gate of the prison, to attend a gentleman who
inquired for me. This person proved to be an attorney named
Humphries, who, addressing me, stated that he called by desire of
counsellor Knapp, to inform me that he (Mr. Knapp,) was sorry he
had not been present at my trial, and that he had discovered a
point of law, of which he hoped to avail himself so far as to
obtain a revocation of my sentence; that he intended to submit this
point to the judge who tried me, and had instructed him (Mr.
Humphries,) to prepare a petition for the purpose, as it was Mr.
Knapp's opinion that I ought not to have been capitally convicted;
but that nothing could be done till after the close of the session,
and I must receive the sentence of death as a matter of form;
adding, that I might make myself perfectly easy, as there was no
danger of my suffering. I now inquired of Mr. Humphries, of what
nature was the point or objection in question; but this limb of the
law, assuming an air of importance, answered that it would be
useless to explain it to me, as, if he did, I should not comprehend
it! I was, however, convinced it related to the absence of the
porter who was present in Bilger's shop, and who ought to have
attended my trial, for the reasons assigned in the preceding
Chapter. I, therefore, smiled at the mean opinion he entertained of
my understanding, but replied, that it was very well; I should
depend on Mr. Knapp and on his (Mr. Humphries',) good offices: and
here ended our interview. For brevity's sake, I shall inform the
reader at once, that I never derived any benefit from the
intimation conveyed to me by Humphries, although I several times
wrote both to him and Mr. Knapp. But I rather think it was a trick
of the former, (who is a designing artful pettifogger,) with a view
of extorting money from me, on pretence of drawing up petitions or
other documents in my behalf. I had, however, seen too much of the
world to be the dupe of an Old Bailey solicitor. Two or three days
after this event, the session being concluded, the whole of the
prisoners convicted during their progress, were as usual taken down
to the court to receive sentence. Myself and the other five men,
together with two women, were first put to the bar. When asked, in
my turn, what I had to say, "why judgment of death should not pass
upon me?" I answered, that my counsel Mr. Knapp having intimated
that he had discovered a legal objection to my conviction, I humbly
hoped his Lordship would be pleased to respite the judgment. The
recorder replied, "Prisoner, your request cannot be complied with;
if your counsel had any thing to offer in arrest of judgment, he
should have done so previous to the close of the session. I must,
therefore, pass sentence upon you." In this observation, I knew the
recorder to be perfectly right; and though I was induced to make
the trial, I had no hopes of gaining any thing by my motion; and I
was now more fully convinced that either Mr. Knapp, or Mr.
Humphries, or both, had deceived me, and that I had been altogether
very shamefully neglected. His Lordship then proceeded to pass the
awful sentence in the usual form, which he prefaced with a very
pathetic aad impressive address, that drew tears from the
surrounding auditors. The other prisoners were then put to the bar
in rotation, and variously sentenced; and among those transported
for seven years, was poor Bromley, who, though capitally indicted,
had the good fortune to be convicted of simple felony only. Thus we
were both a second time convicted the same session, as if his fate
was involved in mine. He was, a few weeks afterwards, sent on board
the same hulk at Portsmouth, in which he had before served seven
years; and as he never came to this colony, he will, (if he
survives,) in a few months be discharged, and once more return to
the scene of our former exploits. I sincerely hope that his past
sufferings will, however, warn him to avoid a continuance of his
guilty courses, and to amend his life.</p>

<p>The recorder's report to the King being, on some accounts,
delayed, I continued eleven weeks in the cells, in which time the
number of condemned persons had increased to eighteen! At length,
the report was made. About eight o'clock on Friday night, the 3d of
May, Mr. Newman entered the press-yard; and, as myself and
companion listened with palpitating hearts on their approach, we
heard one of the turnkeys utter the words "Cook and Lowe." I
confess that at the moment, I was under considerable alarm; which
the reader will allow to be natural, when he considers that my fate
was still doubtful, and that my life or death depended on a single
word from the keeper, who came to announce it. Hearing our two
names particularly mentioned, as he advanced towards our cell, was
also a circumstance calculated to increase our mutual terror. At
length the door was unlocked; and by this I knew that one of us, at
least, was doomed to suffer, because they always visit first those
who are ordered for execution. Mr. Newman entering with a grave
countenance, addressed poor Cook in nearly the same terms he had
done Nicholls on a former occasion; then turning to me, he said,
"Lowe is respited." My unhappy companion received the melancholy
news, as he had always declared he should, with a cheerful aspect,
nor appeared in the least dismayed. The jailer having withdrawn,
Cook, after an inward struggle, assured me he felt perfectly
reconciled; and after I had read to and consoled him for a short
time, retired to bed, and slept apparently with more composure than
usual. The next morning myself and the four others who had been
reprieved, (poor Cook being the only one to suffer,) were, as
usual, ordered to return to our respective wards; but Cook begged
so earnestly that I would not quit him till the fatal day, that I
could not avoid complying. In this period, his courage and
resignation never once failed him. The same worthy man who had
attended Nicholls, passed the last night with him, and I felt a
melancholy pleasure in bearing them company. Cook, however, was so
cheerful and well-prepared, that he slept profoundly the greatest
part of the night, and, on being awaked at the usual hour, appeared
equally serene and happy. I obtained leave to descend with him to
the press-yard, where he washed himself, brushed his coat, and
seemed pleased at his approaching release (as he termed it). I
then, at his earnest request, accompanied him to the chapel, where
he received the sacrament, of which I partook. Some breakfast
having been prepared for him, he ate and drank with every
appearance of a good appetite; after which, his irons being knocked
off, and the hour approaching, I took an affectionate farewell of
the poor fellow, who declared to me at parting, that he should go
out with as much pleasure as if he was going to a fair or a race,
and that he had rather die than live. I then left him, and repaired
to my own ward, through the windows of which I saw him pass by to
execution; and he really appeared to verify the promise he had made
me; nodding, as he passed, to his fellow-prisoners, and having as
fine a colour in his cheeks as ever I saw a man. I was informed
that he preserved this disposition to the last moment, and died
regretted by all who witnessed his deportment. As I now knew the
consequence of my being respited, namely, that I was to be
transported for life, I became anxious to leave England by the
first ship for this colony, as I was not in circumstances to
subsist for any length of time in a prison; and I wished, if
possible, to avoid going to the hulks, as I had been fortunate
enough to do on my first transportation. My wife, also, who had
paid me the most dutiful attention since my confinement, was
earnestly desirous to accompany me in my exile; and, with that
view, she waited on a gentleman to whom I referred her, soliciting
his interest to obtain that favour; but, although he used every
effort, the application was refused, she having no family, and the
secretary of state having set his face against such an indulgence,
on account of the bad reports received of those women who had
already been suffered to go out free with their husbands. I was
equally unsuccessful in my application to be sent out by the ship
Anne, which was on the point of sailing. At length my wife received
a private intimation that I should be removed to the hulks the next
morning; in consequence of which, my mother and sisters, whom I
immediately summoned, came to take leave of me. I had only
acquainted them with my misfortune since my being respited, and
they were of course equally astonished and grieved at the news. My
wife remained with me that night, and at four o'clock in the
morning, myself and eleven others were conveyed by water on board
the Retribution hulk at Woolwich.</p>

<p>I had now a new scene of misery to contemplate; and, of all the
shocking scenes I had ever beheld, this was the most distressing.
There were confined in this floating dungeon nearly six hundred
men, most of them double-ironed; and the reader may conceive the
horrible effects arising from the continual rattling of chains, the
filth and vermin naturally produced by such a crowd of miserable
inhabitants, the oaths and execrations constantly heard among them;
and above all, from the shocking necessity of associating and
communicating more or less with so depraved a set of beings. On
arriving on board, we were all immediately stripped, and washed in
large tubs of water, then, after putting on each a suit of coarse
slop-clothing, we were ironed, and sent below, our own clothes
being taken from us, and detained till we could sell or otherwise
dispose of them, as no person is exempted from the obligation to
wear the ship-dress. On descending the hatch-way, no conception can
be formed of the scene which presented itself. I shall not attempt
to describe it; but nothing short of a descent to the infernal
regions can be at all worthy of a comparison with it. I soon met
with many of my old Botany Bay acquaintances, who were all eager to
offer me their friendship and services,&mdash;that is, with a view
to rob me of what little I had; for in this place there is no other
motive or subject for ingenuity. All former friendships or
connexions are dissolved, and a man here will rob his best
benefactor, or even mess-mate, of an article worth one halfpenny.
Every morning, at seven o'clock, all the convicts capable of work,
or, in fact, all who are capable of getting into the boats, are
taken ashore to the Warren, in which the royal arsenal and other
public buildings are situated, and are there employed at various
kinds of labour, some of them very fatiguing; and while so
employed, each gang of sixteen, or twenty men, is watched and
directed by a fellow called a guard. These guards are most commonly
of the lowest class of human beings; wretches devoid of all
feeling; ignorant in the extreme, brutal by nature, and rendered
tyrannical and cruel by the consciousness of the power they
possess; no others, but such as I have described, would hold the
situation, their wages being not more than a day-labourer would
earn in London. They invariably carry a large and ponderous stick,
with which, without the smallest provocation, they will fell an
unfortunate convict to the ground, and frequently repeat their
blows long after the poor sufferer is insensible. At noon the
working party return on board to dinner, and at one again go on
shore, where they labour till near sun-set. On returning on board
in the evening, all hands are mustered by a roll, and the whole
being turned down below, the hatches are put over them, and secured
for the night.</p>

<p>As to the food, the stipulated ration is very scanty, but of
even part of that they are defrauded. Their provisions being
supplied by contractors, and not by Government, are of the worst
kind, such as would not be considered eatable or wholesome
elsewhere; and both the weight and measure are always deficient.
The allowance of bread is said to be about twenty ounces per day.
Three days in the week they have about four ounces of cheese for
dinner, and the other four days a pound of beef. The breakfast is
invariably boiled barley, of the coarsest kind imaginable; and of
this the pigs of the hulk come in for a third part, because it is
so nauseous that nothing but downright hunger will enable a man to
eat it. For supper, they have, on banyan days, burgoo, of as good a
quality as the barley, and which is similarly disposed of; and on
meat days, the water in which the beef was boiled, is thickened
with barley, and forms a mess called "Smiggins," of a more
detestable nature than either of the two former! The reader may
conceive that I do not exaggerate, when I state, that among the
convicts the common price of these several eatables, is,&mdash;for
a day's allowance of beef, one halfpenny;&mdash;ditto, of cheese,
one halfpenny;&mdash;ditto, of bread, three-halfpence; but the
cheese is most commonly so bad, that they throw it away. It is
manufactured, I believe, of skimmed milk for this particular
contract. The beef generally consists of old bulls, or cows who
have died of age or famine; the least trace of fat is considered a
phenomenon, and it is far inferior upon the whole to good
horse-flesh. I once saw the prisoners throw the whole day's supply
overboard the moment it was hoisted out of the boat, and for this
offence they were severely flogged. The friends of these unhappy
persons are not allowed to come on board, but must remain alongside
during their visit; the prisoners are, it is true, suffered to go
into their boat, but a guard is placed within hearing of their
conversation, and if a friend or parent has come one hundred miles,
they are not allowed above ten minutes' interview; so that instead
of consolation, the visit only excites regret at the parties being
so suddenly torn asunder. All letters, too, written by prisoners,
must be delivered unsealed to the chief mate for his inspection,
before they are sent ashore; and such as he thinks obnoxious, are
of course suppressed. In like manner, all letters received from the
post-office are opened and scrutinized. If I were to attempt a full
description of the miseries endured in these ships, I could fill a
volume; but I shall sum up all by stating, that besides robbery
from each other, which is as common as cursing and swearing, I
witnessed among the prisoners themselves, during the twelvemonth I
remained with them, one deliberate murder, for which the
perpetrator was executed at Maidstone, and one suicide; and that
unnatural crimes are openly committed.</p>

</p>

<p>FROM the description I have briefly given of the hulks, the
reader will easily believe I ardently longed for the moment which
was to release me from so miserable an existence. That happy day at
length arrived. On the 15th of June, 1810, I was removed from the
Retribution, in company with fifty-four others, to Long-reach, a
few miles below Woolwich, where we were put on board the Indian,
which ship had recently been fitted at Deptford for the reception
of two hundred prisoners. The next day we sailed for Gravesend, and
at this place I anxiously hoped for a farewell visit from my wife,
to whom I had written from Woolwich on the morning of my
embarkation, acquainting her with my approaching departure. She had
attended me at least once a month, during my stay at Woolwich, and
supported me as well as her circumstances would permit. We remained
at Gravesend three days, but she did not appear; and in our
progress from thence to Spithead, we took on board at the Nore
forty-five more convicts from the Zealand hulk at Sheerness. In a
few days we arrived at Spithead, where we received one hundred
prisoners from the hulks at Portsmouth, and Langston harbour; soon
after which I had a letter from my wife, stating that she had
arrived at Gravesend on the evening of the day our ship departed,
and brought with her a supply of the most necessary articles for my
comfort; that on finding, to her grief, that she was too late, she
had been advised to follow the ship to Sheerness; which she, in
fact, did, and arrived at that place on the very day after we had
taken in the prisoners, and immediately proceeded on our voyage,
without even coming to an anchor. Thus she was again fatally
disappointed; and having incurred this expense, and endured much
fatigue, she had been obliged to return to town; but added, that if
possible, she would see me before we sailed from Portsmouth. This,
however, she was not enabled to accomplish, her health and
circumstances being both unfavourable to the undertaking. But I
received, on the 18th of July, when we were quite ready for, and in
hourly expectation of, sailing, a letter from her, in which she
expressed her concern at not being in a condition to visit me; but
gave me advice that she had packed up some clothes and other
necessaries, of which she enclosed a list; and that the trunk
containing them would arrive by the Gosport coach at a certain time
and place. I had not received this letter from the hands of our
captain above half an hour, when the Lion of 64 made the signal to
weigh; and from that moment no boat was permitted to leave the
ship, so that I went to sea without the smallest comfort for the
voyage, or any wearing apparel except the suit of slops I had on.
We accordingly got under weigh immediately, and sailed, in company
with the Lion, and the Chichester store-ship. The former had on
board the Persian ambassador and suite, and was bound for Bombay.
The latter was destined for St. Helena, and we were to accompany
them (under convoy,) as far as the latitude of the Cape of Good
Hope. We were no sooner at sea, than Captain Barclay, who had been
induced to notice me from the recommendation of a female passenger
who was going out to New South Wales, and who (singular to relate,)
had actually come home with me in H. M. Ship Buffalo; the Captain,
I say, from her representation of my abilities, and from an
application I made to him by letter, treated me with peculiar
kindness. I was released from irons, and appointed to assist the
steward in the issue of provisions, &amp;c., both to the prisoners,
the ship's company, and the troops.</p>

<p>As the steward himself was not very expert, and an indifferent
scholar, I had the chief management of the whole business, and the
arrangement of all the victualling accounts. From the experience I
had formerly gained, I was perfectly at home in this situation, and
gave satisfaction to all parties. I also wrote the ship's log-book,
and executed many services with my pen for Captain Barclay himself.
The effects of this favourable distinction and confidence were,
that I had every personal comfort the ship afforded during our
passage, lived tolerably well, and accumulated a decent change of
clothing to equip myself on our arrival at Port-Jackson. Nothing
but the usual routine of occurrences befel us in this voyage. We
touched first at Madeira, and afterwards at Rio-de-Janeiro, but our
stay at both places was short. The day after we quitted the latter,
in company with our Commodore and the store-ship; both these
vessels so far out-sailed us, that we lost sight of them and
separated, continuing our course alone without interruption, and,
with tolerable expedition, to the end of our voyage. On the 16th of
December, we anchored in Sydney-cove, from which place I had been
absent nearly four years.</p>

<p>I soon learnt that the news of my second transportation, and in
fact of my principal adventures in London, had preceded my own
arrival; and that, consequently, no surprise was excited by my
appearance. I also heard, to my mortification, that from the
changes which had taken place in public affairs since my departure
from the colony, most of the departments were filled by strangers,
from whom I could expect no indulgence; and that not only these
officers, but the Governor himself, had conceived a violent
prejudice against those unfortunate and misguided persons, who by a
renewal of their vicious courses on returning to their native
country, subject themselves to a second disgraceful banishment, and
seem thereby to indicate that they are incapable of reformation,
and systematically depraved. From this intimation I had reason to
expect a cool reception; whereas, during my former residence in the
colony, I witnessed many instances of persons who returned under
the sentence of the law, being most cordially received, and
preferred to any vacant appointment much sooner than a stranger. On
the 24th of December, I was landed with the rest of the prisoners,
and the whole of us were drawn up in the jail-yard for the
Governor's inspection. It seems I had been particularly pointed out
to his Excellency; for on approaching me, he asked me several
questions respecting my employment under Governor King, and
concluded with desiring Mr. Nicholls, the superintendent, to
dispose of me at present to the Hawkesbury.</p>

<p>His Excellency, however, paused a few moments before coming to
this decision, and I was in hopes he had an idea of giving me a
clerical employment. The Governor then added, that if I behaved
well, something might in time be done for me, or to that effect. I
was much disappointed on this occasion, as I too well knew the
hardships I should have to encounter, if sent up the country and
assigned to a settler. However, it was in vain to murmur, and about
fifty of us were immediately conveyed by water to Parramatta, from
whence we walked next day to Hawkesbury. On arriving at the town of
Windsor, the settlers having been summoned by the magistrates, and
there being a greater number of applicants for men servants than
there were prisoners to dispose of, our names were written on
tickets, and intermixed with a sufficient number of blanks, (we
being the prizes at the disposal of Dame Fortune,) and then each
settler in turn drew a ticket, which on being opened, published the
good or ill luck of the drawer. It was my fate to be drawn by a
settler called "Big Ben," and with him I quitted the scene of
action, and prepared to remove my little baggage to the farm of my
new master. As I had been intimately acquainted with this man, and
in fact with every inhabitant of Hawkesbury, when I formerly
officiated as clerk to Mr. Baker, the store-keeper, I flattered
myself that he would treat me with more kindness, or at least with
less severity than a total stranger; and every one who recollected
me, declared I had been fortunate in getting such a master; and
that Ben, on the other hand, could not have drawn a man more
eminently qualified to render him essential service; as, although
his agricultural and commercial speculations were both extensive,
he was himself perfectly illiterate, and obliged to hire a free man
to attend him at stated times, and arrange his books. But I soon
found, to my sorrow, that I had little reason for
self-congratulation. 'Tis true, this ignorant and good-for-nothing
fellow was glad to avail himself of my talents, and thereby save
the expense he had before incurred; but he thought it too much to
support me in a ration of provisions in return for my services,
though I should have been satisfied therewith. His avarice was
such, that he expected me to act in the double capacity of his
clerk and labourer; and he accordingly measured out the prescribed
portion of ground which he required me to break up with the hoe,
well knowing I had not been accustomed to hard labour, and that I
was in fact incapable of the task. My remonstrances produced the
most unfeeling replies on his part, accompanied with threats of
getting me flogged, and every other species of tyrannical
persecution. This wretch, though now possessed of thousands, was a
few years ago one of the poorest objects in the colony, and as
defective in bodily as in mental endowments; nor was his present
opulence so much the effect of laudable industry, as of a natural
low cunning he possessed, which qualified him to take advantage of
floods, temporary scarcities, and other casual events; and becoming
an adept in the arts of monopoly and extortion, he by degrees
attained the rank of a first-rate settler, and, in the opinion of
his dependants, but much more so in his own, is a man of
consequence. His late prosperity has rendered him over-bearing and
cruel to his inferiors (I mean in fortune,) while he is meanly
servile to his superiors. In fact, the old proverb "Set a beggar on
horseback," &amp;c., was never more aptly applied than to "Big
Ben." According to the lately-established custom, I had been
assigned to this brute, by indenture, for three years; but the
misery of my situation daily increasing, I determined to try every
method of obtaining my deliverance from his power. After struggling
with many hardships for about five weeks, during which I was
generally employed at some laborious work in the field, or in
drudgery about the house, from morning till evening, and sleeping
in a barn over-run with vermin at night, I at length found means,
through the friendly aid of an acquaintance, to escape from the
hands of my persecutor, though much against his will; and the
reader may judge of the malignity of his disposition by the
following circumstance.</p>

<p>I must premise that I could get away by no other means than
counterfeiting sickness; in consequence of which I was ordered (by
the humanity of the resident surgeon,) to the general hospital at
Sydney. It would appear that Benn[*] suspected this stratagem, for,
after trying all he could to obstruct my success, he used these
remarkable words at parting:</p>

<p>"Aye, you may go;&mdash;but if you are six months in the
hospital, I'll have you again when you come out. I know you're of
no use to me, but I'll keep you, if it's only to torment you."</p>

<p>However, as his avarice would not allow him to send a
fortnight's ration with me to the hospital, (in which case he might
have reclaimed me had I been then discharged,) I knew myself to be
effectually free from his further persecution; and I had soon
afterwards the pleasure to hear that he had applied for, and
obtained, another man in my room. Indeed, so great was my aversion
to this unfeeling monster, that I was determined to endure corporal
or other punishment rather than have returned to him: but surely,
the threat he used on my leaving him, ought, when made known, to
have precluded him from ever having it in his power to realize so
hellish an idea!</p>

</p>

<p>After a month's confinement in the hospital I was discharged and
transferred to the town-gang, in which, however, I laboured but a
few weeks; for a deputy Overseer of the jail-gang being wanted, Mr.
Nicholls, the superintendent, requested me to undertake the office,
which, he observed, would be an introduction to something better,
if I behaved with propriety. I, therefore, gladly accepted the
offer, although neither the situation was lucrative, nor its duties
agreeable. I had, on landing from the Indian, made a firm and
solemn resolution never again to deviate from the strictest
probity, or to subject myself any more to a repetition of those
sufferings which are the inevitable consequence of irregular
conduct. Knowing, by fatal experience, the value of a good, or even
an easy, employment, I determined if I should ever again obtain an
eligible situation, to take proper care of it; and, l as solemnly
declare, notwithstanding my present condition, and the punishment I
have since endured, that I have uniformly adhered to those
resolutions; nor does my conscience upbraid me with one single act
at which I ought to blush, since my arrival in the colony. But the
subject of the present Chapter will prove that the best intentions
of mankind are sometimes thwarted and rendered abortive: and that a
person who is destined to be unfortunate, will be so, <i>maugre</i>
every exertion, and let him be never so circumspect.</p>

<p>Soon after my return to Sydney, I met with a youth named
Edwards, who had been my messmate and bed-fellow on board the
Indian, and for whom I had conceived a particular regard. He
informed me that he lived as servant in the family of Mr. Bent, the
judge-advocate, where he had an excellent place, and invited me to
call and see him. As I had rendered him many acta of service on the
voyage, he now wished, (he said,) having it in his power to shew
his gratitude for my kindness. Accordingly, I called upon him
twice, and saw him in his master's kitchen, (which was detached
from the dwelling-house,) in the presence of several other
servants. I told him I lived in the house of Mr. Colles, in
Philip-street, and should be happy to see him when his leisure
would permit. He soon afterwards visited me, and treated me with
some rum, Colles being a publican. Observing him to have a
considerable sum of money about him for a youth in his situation,
and knowing him to have been utterly destitute on his landing, I
expressed my surprise, and earnestly cautioned him against any acts
of dishonesty which might endanger his losing so good a place, and
must, I assured him, inevitably bring him to disgrace and ruin. He
positively declared that he had done no wrong; but that his
mistress, who was very partial to him, frequently gave him a small
sum for pocket-money, and that the gentry who visited at his
master's, made him numerous and handsome presents. I knew all this
to be possible, and I was the more inclined to believe him, because
(as he himself rightly observed,) he had no occasion to use deceit
with me, in whom he might safely have reposed the fullest
confidence. I, however, repeated my cautions and advice, and we
soon afterwards parted. A few days having elapsed, he paid me a
second visit, and proposed that we should take a walk together,
which we accordingly did; and having taken some refreshment, and
amused ourselves for a couple of hours, he quitted me and returned
home. I saw no more of Edwards for about a week; when one day, as I
sat at dinner with Mr. Colles and his family, he came in rather
abruptly, and requested to speak with me. I rose from the table,
and taking him into an adjoining room, he there took from his
pocket several colonial bills, and begged I would take care of them
for an hour or two, as something had occurred at his master's
house, and he did not wish it to be known that he possessed so much
money. He also delivered his watch into my care, and taking off one
of his shoes, produced from it another paper, which he told me, in
rather a significant manner, his mistress had that morning given
him. I saw something so mysterious in this conduct, and my former
doubts were so far revived, that I hesitated, and begged earnestly
that he would not deceive me, but confess if he had done any thing
wrong; adding that if I was fully apprized of the case, I should be
the better enabled to render him this service, and to conceal the
money more effectually, without risking my own safety. This,
indeed, I only said with a view to come at the truth; for, had he
confessed to me what I suspected, though I certainly should not
have betrayed him, I was so firmly resolved to avoid all improper
connexions, that I should have declined taking charge of the money,
and from that moment have dropped all intercourse with him. He,
however, so vehemently protested his innocence, and urged me to
oblige him, repeating that he could have no motive for deceiving
me, that I suffered him to depart, which he did as abruptly as he
had entered. In fact, the whole transaction did not occupy above
five minutes; and was so sudden and unexpected that I had no time
for reflection, and scarce knew what I did. On his departure, I put
the papers carelessly in my waistcoat-pocket, and the watch in my
fob, from which the riband hung conspicuous. As to the latter
article, I knew it to be his own property, having seen him wear it
publicly for several weeks. I now rejoined the family, and sat down
to finish my dinner. The cloth being drawn, I communicated the
particulars of my interview with Edwards to my friend Colles, of
whose experience and integrity I had the highest opinion. I
produced the papers Edwards bad given me, declaring that I felt
uneasy on the occasion, and wished him (Mr. Colles,) to advise me
how I should act. On looking over the papers, we found about
£5.10s. in small colonial bills, and the paper which Edwards took
from his shoe, proved to be a store-receipt for £8.15s.! Colles
expressed his concern that I had suffered Edwards to leave them at
all, saying that he saw clearly through the whole business; and
earnestly advised me, for my own security, to go immediately to the
judge-advocate's: and, let who would be present, to return the
whole to Edwards in the most public manner, with a declaration that
I would have nothing to do with them. This friendly advice I so far
approved, that I determined to follow it implicitly; but,
unfortunately for me, I proposed to smoke half a pipe first, and
declared I would then immediately go. I had just lighted my pipe,
and taken a seat near the door, which was open, when I heard
somebody approach, and turning my head, saw two constables at the
gate, who directly entered the house, and one of them addressing
me, said, he came with an order to search my box. I, of course,
felt a little confused, but, conscious off my innocence, I boldly
answered that my box was at hand, and they were welcome to search
it; but requested to know what they were seeking for, adding, that
if I knew, I might perhaps save them that trouble. One of them
replied, "It is something about the judge-advocate's servant." I
now instantly perceived that I had but one part to act for my own
preservation, and in which I considered myself justified by the
palpable deceit Edwards had used towards me. I, therefore, said
that the young man they mentioned, had just been with me, and left
some property in my care, which I would deliver up to them; and
accordingly produced the bills and the watch. Immediately on seeing
the store-receipt, they exclaimed, "This is what we wanted." They
declared that I had acted perfectly right in giving up the
property; but desired I would accompany them to Mr. Redman, the
chief-constable; and assured me that my open conduct would
undoubtedly acquit me of any blame in the transaction. I willingly
attended them, and learnt by the way, that Edwards was lodged in
jail, on suspicion of robbing his master. On arriving at Mr.
Redman's, the latter, being informed of what had passed, desired I
would wait in his house until be bad reported the whole to Mr.
Bent, and received that gentleman's further commands. In half an
hour Mr. Redman returned, and informed me that Mr. Bent fully
approved of my conduct, that I was at liberty to depart, and if
again wanted, I should be sent for. My friend Colles expressed his
approbation also, of the step I had taken; but was sorry I had not
anticipated the constables, by going myself to the judge's house
the moment he had so advised me; and for that omission I certainly
was highly blameable, and have since severely suffered. The
transaction above described took place on a Friday, and I heard no
more on the subject till the following Monday, when going to the
jail at two o'clock to take out the working party, I was met at the
jail-door by Mr. Redman, who informed me he was ordered by the
Governor to confine me in a cell. I was of course thunderstruck at
this intimation; but as the order was peremptory, I submitted, and
was immediately locked up, after sending notice of my situation to
Mr. Colles. I remained in close confinement during the whole week,
in the course of which I learnt that Edwards, who was lodged in
another cell, had undergone a private examination before his master
on the preceding Saturday, and it was supposed he had (God knows
falsely,) implicated he as an accomplice in his guilt.</p>

<p>The ensuing Saturday, I was taken before a bench of magistrates,
where I also met Edwards, but had no communication with him. The
latter was then called for, and now appeared in the court, to my
surprise, as an approver, or evidence, against a woman known by the
name of Peggy the Miller, from her former husband having been of
that profession. This woman had, unknown to me, been also confined
the whole week on Edwards's accusation. I remained among the crowd
at the door of the court-house, where I was enabled to hear the
proceedings I am now going to describe. Edwards deposed that the
said Margaret had lately quitted the service of Mr. Bent, but had
lived some time in the family as his fellow-servant. That soon
after deponent's coming to the house, she one day proposed to him
to take some money from his master's writing desk, and offered to
procure him the keys for that purpose; that he accordingly did so,
and divided the spoil (about £5.,) with her. Being desired to
proceed, he continued, "A few days afterwards, she again proposed
to me to take some more money and I took about the same sum as
before." These depositions being committed to writing, by the
court, and being extracted with some difficulty from the witness,
and attended with many questions and remarks from the magistrates
present[*], of course occupied some time.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The judge-advocate himself did not
attend.]</p>

<p>On the court desiring Edwards to go on, he was about to proceed
in the same words, "A few days after" &amp;c.; but the court, I
suppose, conceiving him capable of saying any thing in order to
save himself, and, as he could neither particularize any of the
money or bills, said to be so taken, trace their disposal, or
produce one single circumstance to corroborate his assertions, they
declined hearing any more, and put the woman on her defence; who
stated generally; that every syllable of Edwards's evidence was
false and malicious; that during her residence in the family, she
had such frequent opportunities of observing the conduct of
Edwards, and so much reason to believe he was in the constant habit
of pilfering, that, out of regard to her own safely, being a free
woman, and to prevent her being unjustly suspected, she one day
requested her mistress to discharge her, and on being questioned as
to her motives for such a wish, and pressed to continue in her
place, she evaded a full explanation, but consented to continue on
condition of Mrs. Bent herself keeping the keys of the various
drawers, &amp;c., and not suffering them to lie about as they had
hitherto done. That she had reason to believe this conversation had
come to the knowledge of Edwards; for the latter soon afterwards
grossly abusedher, and threatened to stab her with a knife, if ever
he found that she told any tales of him, or pryed into bis
proceedings. That supposing her mistress, from this circumstance,
to be too much prepossessed in his favour, and fearing the
consequences of Edwards's wicked disposition, she had accordingly
persisted in requesting, and finally obtained, her discharge; since
which she had married an industrious mechanic, and lived in good
repute. The court was now cleared, and after some deliberation
re-opened, when the bench informed her, that the evidence of
Edwards being unsupported by any other testimony, the court were of
opinion the charge had not been substantiated, and she was
therefore discharged from custody. During the preceding
examination, Edwards bad never once mentioned my name, but accused
this woman as his sole accomplice, and every person present, as
well as myself, concluded I should be immediately liberated; but
the woman had no sooner retired, than I was called to the bar, and
stood charged, together with Edwards, "with breaking open the
writing-desk of Ellis Bent, Esquire, and stealing thereout several
sums of money!" To this charge, Edwards, who appeared do longer
capable of dissimulation, pleaded "Guilty." I, of course, solemnly
denied any knowledge of, or participation in, his guilt; and
briefly stated the part I had acted, calling upon Mr. Colles, Mr.
Redman, and the two constables, to corroborate my account, which
they did in every particular I have before recited. The court then
appearing to hesitate, Mr. Cubitt, the jailer, with an
over-officious zeal to shew himself assiduous, produced a written
paper, which he stated to be the declaration or confession of
Edwards, when taken before the judge, his late master, on the day
after his apprehension; adding, that the court might perhaps wish
to hear it. To this, the members assenting, one of them accordingly
read to the following effect; "That Edwards confessed having
repeatedly robbed his master's desk of money, in which practice he
had been solely aided, abetted, and encouraged by Vaux! That Vaux
had contrived ah instrument in order to pick the lock of the
writing-desk; and that on one occasion, Vaux happening to come
without his instrument, had made use of a fork, one prong of which
he bent for the purpose! That another time he had made use of a
large nail! and that the nail now produced, which had been found on
Mr. Bent's premises, was the identical nail so used! [This nail
Cubitt exhibited to the court; it was a common nail with a brass
head, about four inches long, and the point appeared to have been
turned by driving it in a stone or brick wall.] That Edwards and
Vaux had jointly taken by these means at various times about sixty
pounds, which had been equally shared between them." This
improbable account, one would suppose, could have excited no other
sensation than that of laughter; for, could it be seriously
entertained for a moment, that with such instruments as those he
described, a man could possibly open so minute a lock as that of a
writing desk, and afterwards re-lock it so securely as to escape,
detection? The fact, doubtless, was, that Edwards, who had access
to his master's keys, had himself committed the depredation without
the aid of any other person or instrument. All this I submitted to
the court, and further desired them to consider the situation in
which I stood, being merely accused by a very wicked youth, who had
already confessed his own guilt, and had laboured to implicate an
innocent woman, as the court had declared her to be. I then dwelt
on the candour and openness of my conduct respecting the money he
had left with me, which I could have effectually concealed, had I
been at all privy to the guilt of Edwards; and I called Mr. Colles,
who swore, "That I had resided in his house since the day of my
discharge, from the hospital; that during that period (about six
weeks,) I had lived a most orderly and regular life; and that he
had never seen me possessed of any money except a half-crown bill,
which he himself gave me to pay for my washing." I concluded with
observing, that Edwards himself, having confessed his crime, could,
if he thought proper to tell the truth, at once acquit me of any
share in his guilt. The court then asked me, "If I was willing to
trust myself to Edwards's answer, if they questioned him on the
subject?"</p>

<p>I answered, that bad as be had proved himself, I could not
believe him so totally depraved as to persist in the wicked story
he had before told, now that he was standing at my elbow, and could
no longer hope to extricate himself at my expense; and I,
therefore, begged he might be questioned. The bench then asked
Edwards, "If there was any truth in the story he had told his
master about Vaux?" when, to my surprise and unspeakable horror, he
answered, (hanging down his head,) "Yes, Gentlemen, it is, every
word of it, true!"</p>

<p>Mr. Redman now stated to the court, that on Mr. Bent missing
this store-receipt from his desk, he had sent for him; and
informing him that he suspected his servant Edwards to have been in
the habit of robbing him, as he had frequently missed small bills
which he could not identify, requested he, Mr. Redman, would
endeavour to find out what connexions the youth had formed, with a
view to the detection of his guilt, and, if possible to trace the
receipt in question, which he had but that morning deposited in his
desk, and should be enabled to recognise by the number and other
particulars. Upon which Mr. Redman answered, that he recollected
seeing Edwards pass by his house one evening in company with me,
and supposed we might be intimate; that Mr. Bent then desired he
would have my lodgings searched, which (after consigning Edwards to
custody,) he had proceeded to do in the manner I have above
related. The court was now a second time cleared, and nearly an
hour occupied in consultation; when Edwards and myself were again
called in, and the bench informed Edwards, that he, having
confessed his guilt, the court had sentenced him to receive one
hundred lashes at the cart's tail, in the streets of Sydney, and to
be kept to bard labour in the jail-gang for twelve months. Then,
addressing me, the bench observed that the evidence of Edwards not
appearing to the court entitled to much credit, and being
unsupported by other testimony, the court acquitted me of any share
in the actual robbery of Mr. Bent; but were of opinion that I had
been privy to the guilt of Edwards, and had received the money from
him, knowing it to be stolen! and they had therefore sentenced me
also to twelve months labour in the jail-gang. Thus ended an
examination, which I believe is scarcely to be paralleled in the
records of a court, either as to its foundation, progress, or
result; and I now found to my cost, that I was in this instance
also, the victim of an unjust prejudice, for one of the members
(who shall be nameless,) said to me, in the course of the
proceedings, "Recollect, Mr. Vaux, this is the second time of your
being sent to this colony; we know you well." I answered, with
secret, and, I hope justifiable indignation, "Surely, Sir, that
ought not to operate against me, if my conduct has been uniformly
good since my late arrival, and I trust that will bear the test of
inquiry."</p>

<p>I have since learned that Edwards, after his being committed to
jail, having heard that I had given up the money he left with me,
conceived I had acted treacherously towards him; and, therefore,
with the double motive of injuring me, and palliating his own
guilt, had the next day requested to be taken before his master,
and feigning contrition, had then fabricated the vile and
improbable story recited by Cubitt to the court; artfully judging
that I being much older than himself, should be considered the most
culpable, and he as an innocent youth, led astray by my
machinations.</p>

<p>After receiving our sentence, the corporal part of which was
severely inflicted on Edwards. I continued to labour in the
jail-gang for about three weeks, when, by an order from the
Governor, as I understood, both myself and Edwards were
double-ironed, put on board a government vessel, with several other
prisoners, and transported to Newcastle, commonly called the "Coal
river," without any definite term being fixed for our exile; and as
we were both prisoners for life, it was uncertain how long our
banishment might be protracted.</p>

the Attempt.&mdash;Its Failure, and the consequent Punishment

</p>

<p>On arriving at Newcastle, I was first employed in wheeling coals
out of the mines, a most laborious occupation indeed; but during my
continuance at that settlement, I was put to all descriptions of
work, and for the last three months, performed the duty, of a
constable, or watchman. Since the day on which the transaction at
Colles's took place, I never exchanged a word with the villain
Edwards. He had been but a few weeks at Newcastle, before he
committed a robbery, and absconded to the woods, from which he was
brought back by some natives a naked and miserable object. His
subsequent conduct at the coal river exhibited nothing but a
succession of robberies, and every species of depravity; when
detected in which, on several occasions, he betrayed his
accomplices, and proved as perfidious as he was dishonest. He
frequently escaped by land, amidst innumerable hard ships, to
Sydney; where, after the commission of some robbery, he was
uniformly apprehended, and sent back to Newcastle. In fact, though
scarce twenty years of age, nothing was wanting to fill up the
measure of his wickedness, but the blackest of all crimes,&mdash;an
act of murder! and, as if he laboured to attain the summit of human
depravity, that act he soon afterwards virtually committed; for
being at length, on one of his elopements from the coal river,
apprehended and lodged in Sydney Jail, at a period when many
prisoners, of bad character, were about being embarked for the
settlements on Van Dieman's land, Edwards was included in the
number. He there renewed his iniquitous courses; associating with a
band of ruffians, who escaped to the woods, and there subsisted by
plundering the settlers, robbing on the high-way, &amp;c. A party
of these miscreants (eight in number,) were one day attacked by
some armed persons, who had assembled together, and gone in pursuit
of them; a serious conflict ensued, the marauders, also, being well
armed; and after several shots had been exchanged, the settlers
were obliged to retreat, several of their number being severely
wounded, and one killed on the spot by the fire of the
free-booters. The consequence of this outrage was, that the whole
of the latter were immediately declared by proclamation to be in a
state of outlawry, and a large reward offered for the apprehension
of all or either of them.</p>

<p>As parties of military, as well as the inhabitants, were
detached in all directions, there is no doubt but the whole of
these desperadoes have long since received the the reward of their
villany. This account I read in a Sydney Gazette a few months ago,
and among the names of the bush-rangers, (as they are termed,) who
jointly committed the above outrage and murder, I was shocked,
though not surprised, to see that of the young, but depraved,
Edwards!</p>

<p>Having continued nearly two years at the coal-fiver, the
commanding officer was induced, in consideration of my uniform good
behaviour, to permit my return to Sydney, on my arrival at which
place, I was once more disposed of in the town-gang. Being advised
to solicit the Governor for an appointment to some less laborious
employment, I waited on His Excellency with a petition, in which I
urged my exemplary behaviour for the last two years at Newcastle;
as a proof that whatever my former conduct might have been, I was
now disposed to reform; and entreating His Excellency to divest
himself of that prejudice which I feared had already operated
against me too severely, humbly prayed that he would make trial of
me in the only capacity in which I was capable of being useful,
namely, that of a clerk in one of the public-offices. Unhappily for
me, the cloud was not yet dispelled, but threatened to obscure,
still longer, the prospect of advancement and prosperity which I
had in vain sighed for, and fondly pictured to myself as the
certain consequence of a thorough reformation in principle. The
Governor very coolly answered that it was not merely my having
behaved well for two years at the coal-river, but I must conduct
myself with propriety for a series of years, before I could expect,
or ought to apply for, any mark of indulgence. This answer was
certainly disheartening in the extreme; and I was equally
unsuccessful in an application to the then acting commissary,
William Broughton, Esq., who, although he never saw me until my
arrival in the Indian, not being in the colony during my former
term of exile, yet this gentleman, from hearing only of my repeated
frauds while employed in the office of Governor King, (and which no
doubt were much exaggerated by report and repetition after my
departure, for Europe,) had conceived so violent a dislike to me,
that he gave me a decisive, though civil, denial; and I have since
heard, that he declared I should not hold a situation in the
commissariat, if there was not another clerk in the colony. God
grant that some well-disposed christian, who reads these Memoirs of
my unhappy Life, may induce this gentleman, for whose shining
talents and excellent qualities I have the highest respect, to
retract his discouraging declaration, and to admit me to an
employment, however subordinate, in his department, which, as I am
now situated, forms the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of my ambition.</p>

<p>To resume my narrative: finding from these disheartening
failures, that I had nothing to hope for but a continuance of
suffering and, bodily fatigue, far above my strength, for many
succeeding years, perhaps for the remainder of my life; surely no
dispassionate reader will pronounce me culpable, or consider that I
deviated from the resolutions I had formed, to act correctly while
I lived, if I listened with eagerness to an offer of assistance in
effecting my escape from a state of bondage which became every day
more irksome and galling, in proportion as I reflected that my
inoffensive conduct fairly entitled me to a share of that favour
and indulgence I every day saw extended to objects I knew less
worthy than myself. In fact, a person belonging to the Earl
Spencer, Indiaman, then on the point of sailing for Ceylon and
Bombay, did, in the month of January, 1814, from motives of pure
and disinterested compassion, propose that I should conceal myself,
with his assistance, on board that ship, and promised me every
support in his power. I accepted with joy and gratitude this
unexpected offer, and, without any difficulty, got on board, and,
as I thought, effectually concealed, on the night of the Queen's
birth-day. I lay close and undiscovered, for four days, and on the
fifth had the pleasure to hear that the ship would that day finally
sail, she having already dropped down the harbour. But, how often
is the cup of happiness dashed from the lips of mortals! On the 23d
of January, about ten o'clock in the forenoon, my friend came to me
in my place of concealment, and informed me that upwards of thirty
constables were come on board to search the ship, for that so many
prisoners were missing from their respective employments, that the
Governor would not suffer the ship to depart until they were found.
He, however, assured me it was very unlikely any search would take
place in the spot I was in, and, indeed, I considered it next to
impossible that I could be discovered, unless I was betrayed. I
remained in a state of the utmost anxiety for three hours, during
which a vigilant search was making in every other part of the ship;
not by the constables, fow they would have been unequal to the
task, but by a mate of the vessel, assisted by several sailors. At
length, I heard voices approaching, and eagerly listening, I was
convinced by the discourse which passed between the parties, that
they knew exactly where I was concealed, and that I really had
been, by somebody, most villanously betrayed. In a moment the mate
advanced, as it were mechanically, towards me, and thrusting his
candle into the entrance of my hiding-place, desired me, in a
peremptory tone, to come out. Thus were my fond hopes of liberty
and happiness effectually destroyed. I had become a second time the
victim of treachery; but as more than one person, besides my
principal abettor, knew of my concealment, I was at a loss whom to
suspect as the informer. I was now ordered into a boat alongside,
in which were about a dozen other men and several women who had
been found concealed in various situations. The search being not
yet over, I remained alongside the ship above an hour, in which
time the number of ill-fated persons collected in the boat had
increased to twenty-seven men and four women. The ship having now
been thoroughly ransacked, the search was given up, and the persons
taken out were brought ashore, attended by the constables. We were
all immediately lodged in gaol; and the next day, a report having
been made to the Governor, His Excellency was pleased to order each
man to be punished with fifty lashes in the public lumber yard.
This sentence was certainly as lenient as could be expected for
such an attempt (I do not say offence) as we had been guilty of,
bad the punishment stopped there; but, extraordinary to relate,
although we had been all equally culpable and were found under the
same circumstances a distinction was subsequently made which I
cannot help still considering unfair and unmerited. The day after
the corporal punishment bad been inflicted, twenty-three of our
number were ordered to return to the respective employments in
Sydney, from which they had severally absconded, and myself and
three others were sentenced by the Governor to be sent to the
coal-river for one year; for this distinction, there appears to
have been no other reason, but because we had each of us before
suffered a similar banishment, and had been but a few months
returned from thence to Sydney!</p>

<p>In a few days, I was accordingly embarked with eleven other
prisoners, and a second time landed at Newcastle, from whence I had
been absent nearly twelve months. On my arrival, it happened that
the store-keeper of that settlement was in want of a clerk, and he,
applying to the commandant for me, I was appointed to that
situation, in which I still continue; and having scrupulously
adhered to my former vows of rectitude, and used every exertion to
render myself serviceable to my employer, and to merit his good
opinion, as well as that of the commandant, I have had the
satisfaction to succeed in these objects; and I am not without
hope, that when I am permitted to quit my present service and
return to Sydney, my good conduct will be rewarded with a more
desirable situation. I have now been upwards of seven years a
prisoner, and knowing the hopeless sentence under which I labour,
shall, I trust, studiously avoid in future every act which may
subject me to the censure of my superiors, or entail upon me a
repetition of those sufferings I have already too severely
experienced. I have thus described (perhaps too minutely for the
reader's patience) the various vicissitudes of my past life.
Whether the future will be so far diversified as to afford matter
worthy of being committed to paper, either to amuse a vacant hour,
or to serve as a beacon which may warn others to avoid the rocks on
which I have unhappily split, is only known to the great Disposer
of events.</p>
