  <p class="note"><i>In our May number we published an article entitled "A
  Follow-My-Leader Picture," and in the following pages the same method is
  applied to the writing of a story, with an extremely interesting result. The
  story was opened by Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim, who alone of the contributors
  was not required to have a complete story outlined in his mind. This opening
  was then sent to Mr. Pett Ridge, who wrote the next chapter, and also sent a
  brief statement of the manner in which he thought the whole story might have
  been completed. These two chapters were then sent on to Mr. Arthur Morrison,
  who, in the fame manner, added his instalment and his idea of the whole
  story: and so on, chapter by chapter, till the whole was completed. lt
  should, of course, be remembered that each writer had before him merely the
  preceding chapters of the story, and knew nothing whatever of his
  predecessors' proposed methods of ending it. These explanations are given as
  footnotes to each chapter, and will be found most interesting as throwing
  light upon the methods of work of the various eminent fiction-writers, and
  the way in which a story evolves itself in such widely divergent manners in
  different minds.</i></p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">By E. Phillips Oppenheim</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE two young men, complete strangers to one another,
  exchanged during those few moments a gaze whose intentness seemed to possess
  some hidden and mysterious quality. Spencer, in flannels and canvas shoes,
  bare-headed, his sunburnt face streaming with perspiration, paused for a
  moment, still gripping the pole with which he was propelling his somewhat
  clumsy craft. The man, a few yards away, who had attracted his attention
  seemed to have very different ideas of pleasure. Dressed in a spotless suit
  of white flannels, he was lounging in a wicker chair on the smooth-shaven
  lawn of a bungalow hung with flowers, whose garden, with its little stone
  terrace, fronted the stream. He, too, was young and good-looking, but of
  another type. His lips parted in a faint, good-humoured smile, as Spencer
  once more raised his pole.</p>

  <p>"Hot work, isn't it?" he remarked, lazily.</p>

  <p>"Beastly," Spencer replied.</p>

  <p>The young man on the lawn touched a glass jug by his side, a jug whose
  frozen sides suggested ice, and in which green leaves were floating
  about.</p>

  <p>"Care for a drink?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Spencer shook his head. "We've sworn off, my pal and I, till we get her
  into the broad," he answered. "You haven't a cigarette to spare, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>The young man rose from his seat and strolled gracefully down the lawn to
  the river's edge.</p>

  <p>"Catch," he said, and threw the box which had been standing by his side
  into Spencer's outstretched hands.</p>

  <p>"Awfully good of you," the latter declared. "Sure you can spare them?"</p>

  <p>The young man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Plenty more here," he said. "Good day."</p>

  <p>Spencer sighed a little enviously as he settled down once more to his
  task.</p>

  <p>"I never, in the whole of my existence," he exclaimed, "saw a fellow who
  seemed so jolly well satisfied with life!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Across the cowslip and buttercup-starred meadows, now
  knee-deep in the mowing grass, now forcing his reckless way through a clump
  of bushes, a man was running as one might run behind whom came hot-footed all
  the strange and terrible shapes begotten of a Dantesque nightmare. Terror,
  livid and appalling, was in his face. Not all the burning heat could bring a
  spot of colour to his cheeks. Even his parted lips, through which his breath
  came in gasps and groans, were white. Once he fell, but rose without pausing,
  heedless of the blood which dripped from his hand and knee. Spencer paused
  once more with the pole in his hand.</p>

  <p>"What, in Heaven's name, is this coming across the coming across the
  meadow?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"It's a madman!" his companion cried. "Look! look!"</p>

  <p>The man who approached was running now in circles. His hands were raised
  to the skies, his head thrust forward. Once more he fell, but picked himself
  up without a moment's hesitation. Nearer and nearer he came to the river
  bank.</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"

  <p>"My God!" Spencer faltered. "It's the man from the bungalow&mdash;the man
  who gave us our cigarettes!"</p>

  <p>The yawl was on the far side of the stream. Between it and the opposite
  bank the stream, which had widened considerably, was now about fifteen yards
  wide. The man who had been running paused for the first time as he reached
  the brink, but only for a second. Without any attempt at diving he simply
  threw himself in, face downwards. With a dull splash he disappeared under the
  green weeds. Spencer, who had been stupefied with amazement, hauled up his
  pole and stepped on to the side of the boat, prepared to dive. His companion
  stopped him.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Spencer!" he cried. "He's here."</p>

  <p>They dragged him on board&mdash;a dripping, wild-looking object. They
  thrust him into their only seat. He cowered there, gripping its sides, and in
  his face were the unutterable things. Spencer and his companion, who stood
  staring at him, felt suddenly that the sun had left the heavens. The pleasant
  warmth was gone, the humming of insects and the singing of birds had ceased.
  It was another world from which this creature had come. They both
  shivered.</p>

  <p>"What, in Heaven's name, has happened?" Spencer demanded. "What is the
  matter with you, man?" There was no answer. Spencer caught up his pole.</p>

  <p>"Let`s have her round," he cried. "We'll get back to the bungalow."</p>

  <p>Then the stranger broke his silence. He shrank back in his place like some
  stricken animal. In his eyes the terror blazed forth, a live and awful
  thing.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">By W. Pette Ridge</p><br>

  <p class="first">"VERY well, then; we'll take you in to the bank."</p>

  <p>"Not there!" he screamed, piteously. "Anywhere else, but not there." He
  seemed to make a determined effort to pull himself together."Give me
  something to smoke. It will compose what I call my brain."</p>

  <p>"One of your own cigarettes?"</p>

  <p>He seized the box eagerly, and, turning aside, made a scoop through the
  contents.</p>

  <p>They lound a clumsy suit of overalls and, landing farther down, he changed
  rapidly, throwing the damp suit of flannels into the hollow of an old
  tree.</p>

  <p>"Fix up here," he urged, "and let's stroll across to the town, and you
  give me an opportunity of repaying your kindness by standing you both tea. My
  story is in many respects a strange one."</p>

  <p>They exchanged a perplexed look as he washed his hands in the stream. The
  three strolled along the path, that went by the side of a field.</p>

  <p>"You think I'm a gentleman, he went on, volubly, and, of course, I want
  people to think so. I dress well, and I aspirate my aitches to such an extent
  that I deceive a lot of people. As a matter of fact, before I came into my
  fortune I was a clerk. That was why,"&mdash; he beamed,
  excusingly,"&mdash;why I was so upset when you talked about taking me in to
  bank."</p>

  <p>"How did you come by your money?" inquired Spencer, interestedly.</p>

  <p>"It was at Folkestone I met her," he went on, mopping his forehead,
  "whilst I was on my holidays."</p>

  <p>"Met who?"</p>

  <p>"House property she'd got, so far as I could gather, Brondesbury way. The
  agent was making up to her, but she said she believed in love at first sight,
  or else not at all. The next morning I had the letter from the lawyers, and,
  believe me or believe me not&mdash;" he raised his bandaged hand
  impressively&mdash;"but since that time she'd gone clean out of my head,
  until a chance remark of yours brought her back again. 'Awfully good of you,'
  you said to me, and those were the very words she passed when I paid for her
  to go down the lift. And now," he shouldered open a gate for them," now I'd
  give every shilling of my twenty thousand pounds to see her again. Every
  penny."</p>

  <p>"Braddell," remarked Spencer, excitedly, to his friend, "this is something
  in your line."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," said Braddell, "do you know her name and address?"</p>

  <p>"You're cold."</p>

  <p>"Do you know the agent's name and address?"</p>

  <p>"Very warm," he commented, approvingly. "I made a note of that at the
  time, and placed it in the cigarette-box I gave you. Having secured
  possession of it, our task now is an easy one."</p>

  <p>"Your task, you mean.""You can understand my excitement, at any rate. If
  I'd lost sight of you, my last chance of finding her would have gone. And if
  you've suffered, as I have, from mothers with daughters who only want a chap
  because he's come in for a bit of cash, you'll realize, first, why I came
  down here for quiet; second, why I'm so anxious to find her. If she did love
  me, undoubtedly she loved me for myself alone. I'll make it worth your while
  to assist me," he promised. "I sha'n't begrudge a thousand or two."</p>

  <p>The two gave a gasp in duet.</p>

  <p>"Here we are!" as a lane took them into the main street. "You go on to the
  Unicorn and order tea and toast for three, whilst I pop in here and buy a
  hat."</p>

  <p>Spencer and Braddell obeyed, consulting eagerly as they went. Coming a few
  minutes later from the outf1tter's shop in a sou'-wester that went well with
  his suit, the tenant of the bungalow crossed to the clematis-covered house
  which bore the words: "POLICE-STATION." He spoke sharply.</p>

  <p>"We've met before, perhaps. I am Inspector Wilmerson, of the C.I.D. Very
  well, then!" without waiting for an answer. "Two sunburnt young men in
  flannels and canvas shoes are wanted for the Moorgate Street bank robbery.
  They're about here somewhere. Keep a sharp look-out for them. Good day !
  "</p>

  <p>"Why," cried the young constable, "dang my eyes if I ain't just seen two
  answering to that yer description making their way 'long to the hotel. And
  ain't yours a clever disguise too, sir? I reckon I sh'd do pretty well at the
  Yard myself."</p>

  <p>"Go and arrest them," he ordered, "and bring them here. Take
  handcuffs!"*</p><br>

  <p class="footnote">* The man of the bungalow kept a small map in the
  cigarete-case, giving the exact place of the buried money belonging to the
  Moorgate Street bank. The local police lock up the two young men, and their
  efforts, when released. to secure the vanished bungalow man are alded by a
  renewed acquaintance, in strange surroundings, with the
  cigarette-case.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><small>W. Pette

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">By Arthur Morrison</p><br>

  <p class="first">MEANTIME, left together, Braddell stared at Spencer, and
  Spencer lifted his eyebrows and laughed.</p>

  <p>"What have we found now?" Spencer remarked. "A madman, an actor, or what?
  First, on the lawn by his bungalow, a particularly easy-going man of good
  manners&mdash; a gentleman, in two words; then a wild, dancing dervish; and
  now a very common sort of bounder, who talks about 'repaying' us for hauling
  him out of the water and putting him into dry clothes by 'standing' us
  tea&mdash;like a beanfeaster!"</p>

  <p>"Odd enough," replied Braddell; "but, actor or lunatic, I should say he
  was a pretty genuinely frightened man when he came bolting across the field.
  Why, he might have been bitten by the what d'ye call&mdash;the Italian
  spider."</p>

  <p>"Tarantula?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It?s a nuisance to be stuck here like this, but I'm rather
  interested, and there may be fun in seeing it through. We must, in fact, if
  we want those overalls back&mdash;he?s pitched his flannels away!"</p>

  <p>The coffee-room of the Unicorn had a small window looking over a corner of
  garden, and a bagatelle-table stood in the light of this window. Spencer took
  a cue and drove a ball or two idly up the board, while Braddell watched
  him.</p>

  <p>"He?s slow in his choice of a hat," said Braddell, presently. "I'll stroll
  out and look for him."</p>

  <p>By the door of the tap-room the landlord stood in whispered consultation
  with a policeman. Braddell unsuspectingly sought to pass between them, and
  instantly felt himself seized from both sides&mdash;and handcuffed!</p>

  <p>"What's the meaning of this?" he demanded, with some difficulty, in his
  blank astonishment.</p>

  <p>"All right, all right," replied the young policeman, grinning and winking;
  "sort of thing they allus say. You ain't obliged to say nothin', but what you
  do say'll be took down an' used in evidence. Come along!"</p>

  <p>By the time that Braddell had gathered his faculties he was alone in a
  converted scullery of the little clematis-covered police-station, with bars
  across the window and a locked door. But in five minutes more the door opened
  before him and revealed his friend Spencer, handcuffed as he had been and
  accompanied by the Unicorn landlord and the same constable, reinforced now by
  a flustered sergeant, with crumbs on his whiskers, relics of a
  rudely-disturbed meal. It took a full half-hour or vehement protest ere the
  sergeant was persuaded to seek confirmation of the prisoners' <i>bona
  fides</i> in the search of the yawl; and it took a little longer still, and
  it needed telegrams, before the sergeant grew possessed of a suspicion that
  his subordinate had made the biggest blunder of a somewhat blundersome
  career. The official information as to the Moorgate Street bank robbery, too,
  could not, however stretched, be made wholly to agree with the appearance of
  the young men in custody; while the utter disappearance of the alleged
  Inspector Wilmerson lent a certain weight to one angry protest of
  Braddell.</p>

  <p>"If there's a man wanted about here," Braddell had repeated again and
  again, "it is that man in the overalls. Go and get his flannels out of the
  hollow tree half-way along to the bungalow; and, above all, go to the
  bungalow itself, man, and don't waste more time. It may be the Moorgate
  Street robbery, or it may be something else; but, whatever it is, get there
  quick and find out!"</p>

  <p>The sergeant was something less of a fool than his man. He hedged and made
  apologies. Of course, if his man had been misled, it was only from an excess
  of zeal; and in any case the gentlemen would understand that he, the
  sergeant, must keep them in sight till the matter had been cleared up. Had
  they any objection to going with him and the constable as far as the bungalow
  they spoke of?</p>

  <p>"Objection? Certainly not! We want to go. Let's get along at once. There's
  an hour gone, and nobody can tell what you've missed. Come along at once.
  You've seen our letters and card-cases and the things in the yawl&mdash;you
  know we sha'n't run away. Come along, and we'll see it through with you."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the two friends, with the sergeant, his helmet in
  place and the crumbs gone from his whiskers, and the young constable, his
  hopes of promotion gone by the board, were hurrying across the meadows toward
  the bungalow that had seemed so peaceful and innocent a retreat when they had
  last seen it. They came in view of the place from the back, and they spread
  wide as they approached, the better to intercept any retreat. Not a sound
  came from the bungalow, and nobody was in sight. They drew nearer, passed the
  flower-beds, and emerged on the sloping lawn. There stood the small
  garden-table, with the glass jug still on it, the wicker chair overturned by
  its side. The white-painted door of the bungalow was open wide, and as they
  approached the porch something on that white-painted door caused Spencer, who
  was ahead, to stop and point, turning with wide eyes to the others, There, in
  the middle of the upper panel, was the print of a human hand&mdash;in
  blood!*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The two perpetrators of the bank robbery have been
  lying in retreat at the bungalow. The chase is hot, and the cleverer thief,
  never yet convicted and wholly unsuspected, fears detection through his
  companion, an old convict. He resolves to murder him, and thus to get rid of
  an inconvenient and dangerous partner and monopolize the plunder. Having
  attacked him from behind in the bungalow and left him for dead, he is
  disturbed by the approach of the boat. Fearing someone may land, he stations
  himself on the lawn and behaves as calmly as is described in the opening. The
  boat passes on. The man in the house revives, seizes a poker, and, covered
  with blood, staggers out, leaving the print of his hand on the door as he
  passes. He strikes the cool thief on the head, and the latter, suddenly
  confronted with the ghastly figure of his associate&mdash;a bigger man and a
  far more desperate character than himself&mdash;runs wildly and erratically
  (because of the blow on the head). The other fellow, badly hurt and seeing
  strangers, fears to follow far. The thief given refuge in the boat invents a
  muddled yarn, and realizing that it is muddled plays up to the character of a
  Crazy Cockney, and gets the two witneeses in the boat held up by the police
  while he bolts. After this, the story may take any one of a dozen courses, or
  more.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><small>Arthur Morrison.</small></span></p>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">By Horace Annesley Vachell</p><br>

  <p class="cp">SPENCER exclaimed loudly: "I can swear that wasn't there when
  he gave me the cigarettes."</p>

  <p>Braddell laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, the door was open. The hand is painted on it, excellently
  painted too, and recognizable from the river."</p>

  <p>"Things seem quiet enough here," growled the sergeant, as he entered the
  bungalow. Braddell glanced for a moment at the iced drink on the wicker
  table, the overturned chair, and a newspaper lying upon the grass. He picked
  up the newspaper and followed the others into the bungalow. Two rooms in
  perfect order met his eyes. Behind these was a cooking-shed containing a
  gasolene stove. Everything inside the bungalow and the shed indicated
  exquisite neatness and cleanliness, not merely the neatness of the bachelor
  accustomed to camping-out, but the meticulous daintiness which expresses
  subtly a woman's love of her habitat.</p>

  <p>"Nothing here," said the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Nobody," amended Braddell. "Did you expect to find somebody,
  sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"I thought it possible."</p>

  <p>"Consider the facts. Hardly had my friend and I come to the conclusion
  that the tenant of this bungalow was seemingly the happiest and most
  contented of mortals, when we see him tearing across that field like a
  dervish."</p>

  <p>"Genuinely frightened, too." added Spencer.</p>

  <p>"He'd turned from a pretty shade of pink to the colour of skilly!"</p>

  <p>"Exactly. What could have frightened him so badly? He was not acting then,
  although he acted afterwards, and badly, too. His cock-and-bull story about
  heing a clerk and in love with a nameless woman was quite unconvincing. We
  left him sitting in front of an iced drink, which I notice to be
  untouched&mdash;odd that!&mdash;and reading this paper."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the sergeant. "You mean, sir, that something he read in the
  paper must have scared him."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> have found the item, I think." said Braddell, as he handed the
  paper to the professional.</p>

  <p>Spencer said with pride:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My friend, Mr. Braddell, is not altogether an amateur. He belongs to the
  <i>Criminologists</i>, a dining-club made up of men interested in crime.
  Several K.C.'s are members."</p>

  <p>"There's a Column about the Moorgate Street bank robbery," said thc
  sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Which accounts for his mentioning it later. Look through the 'Agony'
  column, sergeant."</p>

  <p>"I have it, sir." He read aloud: "'Red Hand. Your hiding-place is
  discovered. Bolt at once.'"</p>

  <p>"By Jove, he did!" exclaimed Spencer.</p>

  <p>"We are wasting our time here," said the sergeant, irritably.</p>

  <p>"Not altogether," replied Braddell. "May I suggest that you leave your man
  here to see if anybody comes, rather thirsty, to enjoy that drink?"</p>

  <p>"Remain here," said the sergeant, addressing the constable.</p>

  <p>"Before we leave," murmured Braddell, suavely, "I should like to open that
  trunk, which I perceive to be locked. No doubt, sergeant, it has not escaped
  your eye that there is neither shaving-brush nor shaving-soap on the
  washing-stand."</p>

  <p>The sergeant coloured.</p>

  <p>"I don't mention all I see." he remarked, in an injured tone. He bent down
  and wrenched open the trunk. Spencer, peeping over his shoulder, whistled.
  The trunk was full of a woman's clothing.</p>

  <p>"I thought there was a woman in this," said the sergeant. "The sooner we
  lay hands on the man the better."</p>

  <p>"A bungalow built for two," murmured Braddell, absently.</p>

  <p>Leaving the constable in charge, the three men hastened back to the town,
  taking the tow-path as being the shortest way. At the first bend in the river
  Braddell halted and laughed.</p>

  <p>"We now know," he affirmed, with conviction, "where the young gentleman
  really is." He smiled genially at the sergeant and pointed down the long
  reach ahead.</p>

  <p>"Where?" asked the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"On board our yawl."</p>

  <p>Spencer laughed also.</p>

  <p>"I don't see the joke," said the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"I don't see the yawl," added Spencer.</p>

  <p>"The yawl," replied Braddell, " is running down the estuary on an ebb
  tide, and the joke is on&mdash;us."</p>

  <p>"The beggar got us arrested so as to commandeer our boat," said Spencer.
  "Clever chap, eh, sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"Tub like that can't have gone far," said the sergeant, hopefully.
  Obviously, the young gentleman was no ordinary criminal.</p>

  <p>"Tub yourself!" thought Spencer, with a scornful glance at the sergeant's
  rotundities. Then he heard Braddell's pleasant voice saying:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I suggest, sergeant, that we examine the young gentleman's flannels. They
  may be marked."</p>

  <p>"He changed behind those willows," said Spencer, "and stuffed the wet
  clothes into that old pollard."</p>

  <p>A moment later Braddell was thrusting his hand into the hollow of the
  tree. He flung upon the grass the sodden fiannels and a bundle of wet linen.
  With a smile he held up an unmistakable garment.</p>

  <p>"I am sure, sergeant, that this is no surprise for you. The young
  gentleman who was too modest to change before us is a young&mdash;lady!"
  *</p><br>

  <p class="footnote">* The young woman is not a criminal of sanguine hue, but
  a modern miss who has bolted from an irascible guardian to escape a marriage
  of convenience, and has donned trousers so as to avoid attracting attention
  as a pretty girl alone in a bungalow. Upon the morning when the story opens
  she is expecting her lover, who will recognize the bungalow as he punts down
  the river by the red hand painted on the door, a happy symbol, inasmuch as
  the lover is a bnronet, albeit rather impecunious. They have
  corresponded&mdash;since the young lady left hom&mdash;-by means of the Agony
  column in the <i>Daily Mail</i>. The young lady, not quite of age, is a ward
  in Chancery, and the moment she is of age she hopes to marry her baronet,
  enjoying the while a quiet life in the bungalow, punctuated by visits from
  her beloved. The constable left in charge arrests the guardian and
  complications follow, including the capture of the runaway, who finds herself
  at the mercy of wind and tide. Braddell plays the familiar part of <i>Deus ex
  machina</i>, and true love triumphs.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><small>H. A.

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">By Barry Pain.</p><br>

  <p class="first">"THIS," said the sergeant, frankly, "is getting a bit beyond
  me."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean to do?" asked Spencer.</p>

  <p>"Get back to the station and get on the 'phone. I can have our men on the
  look-out for that yawl all the way along. By the time we get the yawl we get
  the young lady, don?t we, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I presume so," said Spencer.</p>

  <p>"I don't," said Braddell. "Well, get on to the station, sergeant, and
  we'll go back to the bungalow. What about your man there?"</p>

  <p>The sergeant caressed his whiskers thoughtfully. "Well," he said, "we're
  short-handed."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Braddell. "We'll send him back and remain there
  ourselves until this evening. Did you say that you meant to have a constable
  sleeping at the bungalow to-night?"</p>

  <p>"If I did not, it was in my mind."</p>

  <p>"Good. You might engage bedrooms for us to-night at the Unicorn. It will
  be all on your way."</p>

  <p>They went back to the bungalow and dimissed the constable, who was rapidly
  developing into a young man with a grievance. Spencer stretched himself at
  full length on the lawn. "And what do we do now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"l`m going to feed the dicky-birds," said Braddell.</p>

  <p>Spencer sat up. "Have you gone mad?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Wait and see, as they say in another place."</p>

  <p>Braddell went laughing into the house. and returned with a piece of bread
  in his hand. He picked up the glass jug.</p>

  <p>"Smell that," he said to Spencer, "and tell me what you make of it."</p>

  <p>Spencer smelt it diligently.</p>

  <p>"Cup of sorts, I suppose, and the young lady's rather overdone the
  Kirschwasser. The thing reeks of it. I'll just taste it and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Braddell took the jug out of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Half a minute," he said. He poured some of the contents of the jug on to
  the piece of bread and then broke it up and scattered it at the far end of
  the lawn.</p>

  <p>"Bet you the birds don't touch it," said Spencer. "They've plenty of
  better grub this weather."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you can depend on the sparrows," said Braddell.</p>

  <p>And presently a couple of sparrows fluttered down on to the lawn and
  tackled the crumbs vigorouslyn. In a few seconds they rolled over dead.</p>

  <p>"Great Scot!" said Spencer. "And that was the stuff the young lady wanted
  me to drink!"</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Braddell. "Prussic acid smells very much like
  Kirschwasser. The addition of the borage and ice was quite a happy thought. I
  don`t think our friend is a very moral young lady. but I`m absolutely
  convinced she's a very clever young lady."</p>

  <p>"Well, now, Braddell," said Spencer, "what do you make of it so far?"</p>

  <p>"I can only see what is perfectly obvious. She was in hiding&mdash;from
  whom I do not know. She wanted her hiding-place to be easily distinguished by
  someone coming up the water. For whom she was waiting I do not know. There
  you have it. There was some person from whom she wished to hide, and there
  was some person by whom she wished to be found&mdash;hence the red hand
  painted on the door. But there is a further complication that I have not yet
  reached. When we saw her running across the meadow she was mad with terror.
  There is no doubt about it. Why? And what was it she took out from that box
  of cigarettes she had given us? The game of hide-and-seek is obvious, but
  there must be a second complication. It is quite possible, by the way. that
  when she offered you that drink she mistook you for somebody else."</p>

  <p>"But what's the key to the second complication?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say. But this is the key to the bureau in the drawing-room. At any
  rate, it fits it. Quite a common lock. I tried it when I went in for the
  bread. Come and investigate."</p>

  <p>"I say," said Spencer, "what business have we got with her bureau?"</p>

  <p>"Hang it all " said Braddell. What business has she got with our boat?</p>

  <p>"By the way," went on Braddell, as they walked back into the house
  together, "she did not fling herself into the water because she was terrified
  nor because she wished to commit suicide. People who want to drown themselves
  don't do it where there are two lusty young men waiting to fish them out
  again. She wanted to be fished out. You can bet on that,at any rate. I wish I
  had her lightning rapidity in plan and execution. I should be a great man,
  Spencer." *</p><br>

  <p class="footnote">* The lady on the lawn was the head and brains of a gang
  of thieves. The bungalow in which she was taking refuge was haunted. Her
  terror was in consequence of this and genuine. Others of her gang were to
  have joined her at the bungalow, and she was waiting for them when she
  received the warning that the detectives were on her track. The poisoned
  drink was intended for the detectives.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><small>Barry

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">By Charles Garvice</p><br>

  <p class="first">WITH not unreasonable nervousness Braddell unlocked the
  bureau, Spencer looking over his shoulder with feverish curiosity. The thing
  unlocked quite easily. Braddell threw up the lid, and Spencer exclaimed with
  amazement, for, quite, uncovered, were a number of bags such as are used by
  banks for gold. There could be no doubt about the contents, for one of the
  bags was open, revealing a mass of sovereigns. Beside the bags was a quantity
  of bank-notes, and tucked away in the corner was an old stable cap, with one
  end of a crèpe mask still attached to it.</p>

  <p>The two men fell back and stared at each other.</p>

  <p>"Great heavens!" gasped Spencer. "There must be thousands of pounds there!
  We've come upon the loot of a gang of thieves."</p>

  <p>He looked round the neatly-furnished room, through the door at the
  beautiful and peaceful scene. The whole place in its loveliness and serenity
  was absolutely incongruous with so mean and sordid a crime as
  bank-cribbing.</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;it's a mystery!" exclaimed Spencer, dropping on to a chair and
  wiping his brow.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind," said Braddell, quietly. "It's all perfectly plain
  and simple. Some of the gang, two of them, perhaps&mdash; the clever young
  lady and a man, probably &mdash;have been using this bungalow as a kind of
  screen and blind. No doubt they've been living here for months, leading the
  kind of simple life which would mislead anyone. For who would suspect a young
  girl&mdash;and her husband, probably&mdash;dawdling through existence in such
  circumstances as these, of being concerned in a conspiracy to rob a bank?
  And, still more, who would think of searching for the stolen money in such a
  place as this? It was a very pretty plant, and I can't for the life of me
  understand why it failed. One would have thought it would have been the
  easiest thing in the world to have got the loot away by boat. I think I could
  have done it."</p>

  <p>"Something must have disturbed them," said Spencer. "Something evidently
  did upset <i>her</i>, for she was mad with terror when we saw her tearing
  down the lawn. What was it?"</p>

  <p>"Something she saw, something she heard," said Braddell. "It may have been
  the red hand on the door. It may have been a warning signal, the imitated
  note of a bird, a faint cooee, which we didn't notice, but which she heard
  immediately after we had gone."</p>

  <p>"What's to be done?" asked Spencer, staring at the precious contents of
  the bureau.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and fetch the police to take this stuff away. You stay here and
  mount guard over it," said Braddell.</p>

  <p>"No; I'll go," said Spencer, a little paler than he had been before, "and
  you mount guard. No; you sha'n't run any risk, old man. We'll both go. No one
  is likely to interfere with this stuff for the short time we shall be absent.
  To be quite frank, I couldn't leave you alone here. This place, the whole
  thing, is getting on my nerves."</p>

  <p>Braddell re-locked the bureau, and they set out at a sharp trot for the
  station.</p>

  <p>"What I can't understand," said Spencer, "is that poisoned cup. Whom was
  it meant for, and why did she offer it to us? No object in killing a couple
  of chaps she'd never seen before."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Braddell, musingly. "If she'd done for both of us it
  would have been easy to have pushed us overboard, seized the yawl, and
  escaped."</p>

  <p>"Ingenious, but a trifle risky," commented Spencer, with a shake of the
  head. "One may go in for bank-cribbing, but draw the line at murder. Here we
  are. They seem in a state of excitement. I'll bet they'll lose their heads
  altogether when we show them what we've found."</p>

  <p>The sergeant stared when Braddell curtly requested him to accompany them
  back to the bungalow and to bring a small sack; but Braddell refused any
  explanation, and the sergeant and a constable&mdash;the latter with the sack
  over his arm&mdash;returned with the two young men to the bungalow. With a
  gesture that was instinctively dramatic Braddell unlocked the bureau, threw
  up the lid, and, with his eyes fixed on the sergeant, said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Put it in the sack."</p>

  <p>"Put what, sir?" demanded the sergeant, staring amazedly.</p>

  <p>Braddell tumed his eyes swiftly to the open bureau and saw that it was
  empty. He was too thunderstruck to utter a word, and it was Spencer who
  gasped out:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"That thing was full of notes and gold when we left a quarter of an hour
  ago."</p>

  <p>The sergeant looked from Braddell to Spencer with a surprise which
  gradually gave place to a mixture of suspicion and pity.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing there now, sir," he said, as he swept his hand round the
  inside of the bureau. "It's quite empty; not even a scrap of paper or
  a&mdash;hairpin. Sure you saw it, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!" exclaimed Spencer, indignantly. "Do you think we've taken leave of
  our senses?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, you've 'ad an upsetting time," responded the sergeant,
  apologetically.</p>

  <p>"Someone has been here," said Braddell, suddenly; "someone strong enough
  to carry off the money. They can't have gone far; there must be some
  traces."</p>

  <p>He sprang to the door and, bending down, examined the gravel path; but it
  had been closely rolled and neatly swept, and there were no traces of
  footsteps. But a little farther on he found, on the edge of the grass, the
  impress of a man's shoe, a boating shoe which had been recently whitened, for
  there was a speck or two of pipeclay on the edge of the footprint.</p>

  <p>"Come along." he cried, in a voice trembling with excitement.</p>

  <p>They followed him as he tracked the footprints. They went straight for the
  shrubbery at a little distance from the bungalow. Braddell stopped here and
  pointed to the bush in front of him. Some of the twigs had been broken, as if
  a person had rushed through the bush, heedless of where he was going.</p>

  <p>"Better go round," he said. "We won't disturb this."</p>

  <p>They found an opening a little lower down in the shrubbery, and Braddell
  cautiously entered, signing to the others to keep back. They waited almost
  breathlessly; then suddenly they heard a sharp, low cry from Braddell, and
  the next moment he came out, clutching the branches on each side of him as if
  for support. His face was deathly white, and he gazed over their heads as if
  he were obsessed by some horrible sight.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The girl, a member of a good family, had fallen into
  the hands of a professional thief, at handsome, fascinating scoundrel. The
  two had been concerned in the bank robbery, the proceeds of which the had
  secreted in the bungalow, where they had been living for some time. They had
  arranged to meet at the bungalow, whence they were to escape in disguise. The
  girl had put on a man's flannel boating suit and was awaiting her accomplice
  when Spencer and Braddell's yawl came up. After they had gone she went to the
  house, and saw the red hand, a warning sign, on the door. She was about to
  take flight when she came upon the body of her accomplice lying in the
  shrubbery behind the bungalow. He had committed suicide by drinking the cup,
  which she did not know contained poison when she offered it to Spencer. A
  third accomplice who had been watching had made off with the contents of the
  bureau while Spencer and Braddell had gone for the police. The girl and the
  rest of the gang were captured and sent to penal
  servitude.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><small>Charles

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">By Richard Marsh</p>

  <p class="first">"PARDON me." A man had stepped out from among the bushes who
  was regarding them with a smile. "Excuse me, gentlemen, this is all right as
  far as it goes, but the point is how far does it go? That's the point."</p>

  <p>"There's a dead body lying on the ground where that man?s just come from,"
  Braddell stammered to the sergeant. "I saw it with my own eyes."</p>

  <p>"Of course you did, and a very nice one it is."</p>

  <p>"What fiend in human shape," cried Braddell, facing the grinning stranger,
  "have we got here?"</p>

  <p>"That's the point, as I was about to remark. "How far have we got? I
  killed him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You killed him? You killed the man who is lying there? You admit it?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I killed him; that's the idea. I gave him five blows with a
  hatchet. While he was struggling for life he caught hold of whatever he
  could, and that's his bloody hand which you see upon the door-post. She saw
  it, the young lady who was dressed as a gent, and she did a bunk. Half-mad
  with tenor she was: we'd got her just right&mdash;we wanted to get her like
  that, you know; into the water she goes, then you come on the scene, and
  that's as far as we've got."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that you've got some distance." Spencer was surveying the
  stranger with a glance which, perhaps, insufticiently showed, his
  bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Are you a murderer, or merely a criminal lunatic, or what are you,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, what am I? That's another point. We haven't got so far as that."</p>

  <p>Taking off his straw hat, the stranger passed a hlue silk handkerchief
  across his brow. "Of course, the idea was that I was to cut her throat, drag
  her out of the water by the hair of her head, and, as she lay gasping for
  breath on the bank, slit it from ear to ear; but, as I was about to remark,
  1hat's what we haven't quite got to."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you? You may thank your lucky stars that your carnival of crime
  was not played out." Spencer`s tones were portentous. "Sergeant, do you
  happen to have a pair of handcuffs in your pocket? If ever there was an
  occasion on which they were required, surely this is one."</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking l've met this chap before," the sergeant remarked.</p>

  <p>"You have, sergeant, when I gave you half a crown to smash my friend's
  head open with your truncheon; then we had a hand-to-hand fight, after I'd
  thrown my wife out of the window."</p>

  <p>"I remember," agreed the constable; "I remember very well. You made that
  half a crown five shillings."</p>

  <p>"It was worth it; you put up something like a iight; you'd have killed me
  if my friend hadn't thrown you out of the window after my wife. Excuse me,
  gentlemen, but it occurs to me"&mdash;the stranger turned to Braddell and
  Spencer with the friendliest possible gesture&mdash;"that this may require a
  little explanation; something in your attitude suggests it. Perhaps you will
  find it here."</p>

  <p>From a letter-case he took two cards, presenting one to each gentleman.
  They were inscribed:-</p><br>

  were rehearsing a little idea in which the intention was to cram more
  varieties of bloodshed and crime than have ever been crammed into twelve
  hundred feet before&mdash;a film full of human interest, with a
  heart-to-heart ending. And when you came upon the scene that was as far as
  we`d got."</p>

  <p>"And why," exclaimed a voice behind them, "you wish to waste good
  Kirschwasser on making two sparrows dead drunk is beyond me altogether."</p>

  <p>The speaker picked up two sparrows which were making some rather singular
  attempts to walk across the lawn.</p>

  <p>"Drunk?" murmured spencer. "I thougnt they were dead."</p>

  <p>"Of course you did; you'd think anything&mdash;you're such a nice young
  man." The speaker plunged a pair of hands into his two trouser pockets. "You
  thought I was a man. Well, I'm not, I'm a girl; and that's as far as I've
  got."</p>
