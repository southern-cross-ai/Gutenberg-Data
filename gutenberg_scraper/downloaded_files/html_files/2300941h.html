<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>FOREWORD.</h2>

<p class="first">
IT would be merely impertinent to endeavour to explain or
apologize for an attempt to tell the story of John Wesley once
again. This great man's part in the development of the
English-speaking people is now clearly defined by historians. When
he died he left at least 135,000 followers out of a population of
6,000,000. Nothing quite like his organization had been seen in
England before, and his ideas were copied both by the Dissenters,
roused by his example to missionary efforts and asceticism, and by
the Evangelists who worked within the Church itself, led by those
wealthy public men, like William Wilberforce, who emphasized
philanthropy and personal religion. John Wesley thus stimulated in
many points the Church to which he declared to the last his
loyalty&mdash;that Church which when he was ordained was not
searching for men who had a vocation or even theological knowledge.
The early eighteenth-century Church of England employed nobles,
polished speakers, or mere drudges, and it was only by lucky chance
that it enrolled among its bishops men like Butler and Berkeley, so
that the religion of the country became drowsy and sank into an
arid materialism. John Wesley altered all that; he got away from
formalism and appealed to individual experience. His own work,
which he loved so dearly, which he had created out of his own flesh
and blood, his own brain and energy, was to a large extent bound to
fade with his own death; he had been autocratic, and with the
closing of his eyes and the folding of his hands the fire died
down. He himself had seen that it would. But it left these great
effects behind; even the Radicals who differed so widely from his
views copied his methods. The horrors in the prisons and the slums
that he had helped to point out did begin from that moment to
attract the attention of men like John Howard and Samuel Romilly
and women like Elizabeth Fry; thus John Wesley influenced the
national life at many points.</p>

<p>It is now also accepted that the influence of Methodism helped
to steady the country during the French Revolution and prevented a
similar upheaval from taking place in England; all Wesley's vast
influence and powerful organizations were on the side of law and
order; had it not been so our history might have taken a different
turn. Besides thus helping the stability of English
society&mdash;by touching a huge population ignored by the Church,
which had not provided for the new potential congregations of the
industrial north&mdash;he deeply affected the social life of the
times. It has been estimated that in the period during which John
Wesley worked nearly half the population were paupers; it was these
unemployed, outcasts, and criminals to whom the great evangelist
appealed, giving them religion as a drug and a comfort; he is now
placed with J.-J. Rousseau and Samuel Richardson as one of the
great forces that moved the emphasis from the head to the heart,
from Rationalism to emotionalism. Whether it was for good or evil
that John Wesley so drugged and stunned the illiterate poor with
his preaching of Hell-fire, a sentimental "love of God," and his
doctrine of a life lived according to rigid rules as the only means
of salvation, may be a matter of dispute.</p>

<p>Whether he wrought harmfully or beneficially in fastening the
clamps of a terrible superstition on the minds of ignorant and
impressionable people, whether his emphasis on self-denial, on
austerity, on gloom, on an absorption in the idea of a vengeful
God, was to the good or not of the national character must be left
in open debate, or referred to the historians who have so carefully
and lucidly examined and expounded these matters.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>
THE OLD PARSONAGE.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE watchful mother rested her back against the dingy wall and
folded her gaunt hands over the open Bible on her knee; seven
children sat on stools before small home-made desks that supported
lesson books; a wan and wizened infant lay in the wattle cradle.
Small windows let in a watery light that cast deep shadows behind
the silent pupils and their stern instructress; the furniture was
scanty and worn; a spinning-wheel stood by the hearth with the
carefully raked ashes; in a basket near-by were hanks of hemp and a
roll of canvas. The quills scratched laboriously on the coarse
paper as the words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp"><i>In the beginning God created the heaven and
the earth...</i></p>

<p class="first">were traced out by the careful, nervous fingers
of the youngest child, John Benjamin. Susanna Wesley's keen
eyes glanced from one to another of the bent bright heads of
red-gold or red-brown hair, then at the serious, intent faces.
Even John's, who was but five years old and had just begun
lessons, was serious, almost sad in expression, and Hetty's,
often gay and wilful, was grave and composed. Mrs. Wesley was
satisfied with the heavy decorum that hung over her little
school; her children were well trained, she had mastered
them&mdash;"conquered their wills," as she termed it; if any of
them went astray it would not be her fault, or so she tried to
think.</p>

<p>But the weight of her double burden was almost too much even for
her strong courage; her fingers trembled on her Bible as she
pondered over what she had to do&mdash;to find bread to nourish
these poor bodies, to find grace to save these poor souls.</p>

<p>In the year 1696 Samuel Wesley, his wife and four children had
crossed to Axholme from South Ormsby, in another part of
Lincolnshire, where, on fifty pounds a year, the poor clergyman had
contrived a decent existence in what he termed himself "a mean cot,
composed of reeds and clay," with a child every year and no outside
resources, though he struggled to write what might be acceptable
both to God and to the paying public.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley recalled with grim irony the pleasure with which
they had left South Ormsby for the Island; the rectorship of this
parish was worth two hundred pounds, less thirty pounds charges,
and there was good glebe land as well. Epworth was in the gift of
the Crown, and Samuel Wesley had obtained it through his laborious
pen; not only had he written in support of the revolution of 1688,
but he had composed a heroic poem dedicated to the gentle,
melancholy Queen, and, having been chaplain in a great lord's
house, he had had sufficient influence to get it presented to Mary
II, who was always touched by loyalty to her husband and the
affirmation of Anglican views.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley differed on this point, as on almost every other,
from her husband; she believed in the divine right of kings and
could not, therefore, admit the Prince and Princess of Orange to be
Sovereigns of Great Britain, but she had been glad to accept the
posthumous bounty of the Queen, though she sternly refused to say
"Amen" to the prayers for the King. It had been with some hope in
her breast that she had come to Epworth&mdash;a hope bitterly
disappointed&mdash;she admitted this to herself as she looked
across the marsh land to where the waning light spread faintly in
the cloudy sky; landscape and heavens alike the colour of vinegar
and ashes.</p>

<p>She had never left the Island, save for the briefest visit to
relatives, since she had come there, and those twelve years had
been spent in a fierce grind of poverty and a harsh struggle with
the wild Fen people, who were certainly in grave peril of
damnation, if they were not actually allies of Satan. The
inhabitants of Axholme Island had lived in half-barbaric state,
contented enough among themselves, until Charles I had given
Cornelius Vermuyden a charter for draining the ague-infested swamps
of the island. This attempt at progress had resulted in a grim feud
between the brutal Fen men and the newcomers, and only after
furious disputes and bloody incidents were the "low levels" turned
into rich arable lands. The character of the natives had little
changed, however, and they had taken very ill the stern and sour
attempts of the Rev. Samuel Wesley to reform their manners, point
out their sins, and set them on the path to Heaven. His
congregations had always been small, though Epworth was entirely
Anglican, save for one Papist and one Presbyterian, and every
Church matter had always been in dispute between the pastor and his
scanty flock, even to the choice of the version of the psalms. Mr.
Wesley's favourite was Brady and Tate; the people preferred
"Grandsire Sternhold." Among these rude Fen dwellers the gifts, the
learning, the refinement of the intelligent and highly educated
clergyman were causes of offence. These unpopular merits were,
however, not so distasteful to the townspeople of Epworth as the
intense seriousness with which Mr. Wesley took his duties. He
rounded up the straying sheep with the persistency of a nervous
collie, and neither delicacy nor fear kept him from a continual
goading of his parishioners, not only with regard to their Church
observances but also as to the details of their daily lives. He
tried to introduce into his parish the rigid discipline that his
wife maintained in her household, and, as Susanna Wesley often
thought grimly, he was not so successful as she was; for lately the
sullen hostility of the Fenlanders to their harsh parson had taken
on a desperate form. Mrs. Wesley gazed now at glebe lands where
scorched stalks were all that was left of a promising crop of flax,
at barns where maimed cattle were being tended, at a kennel where a
watch-dog lay with a bandaged leg; that very morning she had heard
a lout shout over the garden paling at her children: "Little
devils, we will turn you all out a-begging shortly!"</p>

<p>The man of God was housed, like his kine and his pigeons, in a
structure of plaster and timber, covered with straw thatch. The
Rectory consisted of five bays, divided into three storeys, seven
rooms, and some closets. On the ground floor were the kitchen, the
hall, the parlour study; above, the three bedrooms; five years
before a third of the Rectory had been burnt down, and not, the
Wesleys believed, accidentally; the expenses of restoring the
building had been another drain on the miserable resources of the
Rector, who had written at the time of the disaster: "I find that
'tis some happiness to have been miserable; for my mind has been so
blunted with former misfortunes that this scarce made any
impression on me."</p>

<p>Samuel Wesley came of a family that justified his claim that it
was ancient and respectable; he was the fourth of a line of
clergymen, two of them Dissenters, who had been educated at Oxford.
Those sturdy, learned men, remarkable for plain living, religious
zeal, and "a peculiar plainness of speech," had bequeathed so scant
a supply of worldly goods to young Samuel that he had to look to
the generosity of relatives to pay his expenses at Dorchester
Grammar School, at Stepney Nonconformist Academy, and to obtain his
University education by entering himself, one August morning when
he had walked from London to Oxford, "as a servitor of Exeter
College." He was then possessed of a keen narrow mind, a vindictive
tongue, a revengeful temper, a sincere fear of God, and forty-five
shillings. By acting as body-servant and messenger to the other
students, with "his work as all his wages," Wesley obtained as good
a classical education as the reign of Charles II afforded, while
his deep sense of religion and his personal pride were both
gratified by visits to the local prison. In Exeter College he was a
menial, at the service of every idler who wanted grease on his
riding-boots, or a parcel carried; in Oxford Castle he was the
mouthpiece of God, preaching a sparkle of icy hope to condemned
wretches shivering in the dark. When he left Oxford he left all
fellowship with the Dissenters, and in the year of the Glorious
Revolution, 1688, he was ordained a deacon of the Anglican Church
at St. Andrew's, Holborn, London, and became what was termed a High
Churchman.</p>

<p>Ambition tugged at the narrow spirit of the young curate; he
wrote many pieces in prose and verse, waited on the young, harassed
Queen, with the plan of a Life of Christ, of which she sweetly
accepted the dedication. Wesley dared to hope that the royal favour
would stretch to an Irish bishopric. But Mary's influence procured
for the earnest youth only a chaplaincy in a man-of-war. While in
this rough and dangerous employment&mdash;for England was at war
with France, and naval engagements were frequent&mdash;Samuel
Wesley found time to hammer out his Life of Christ in eleven
thousand lines of heroic poetry, with notes, preface, and the
directions for sixty copper plates. Neither this effort of
misguided industry nor any other of his literary works&mdash;not
even his <i>Panegyric on Marlborough</i>&mdash;had brought fame or
more than a very little money to Samuel Wesley, and there he sat
now, a soured disappointed man, nearly fifty years old, with an
ageing wife, nine children, a heap of debts, and a mountain of
ill-will on his shoulders&mdash;forgotten, unnoticed, a learned man
drudging among boors.</p>

<p>Such was the situation and such the surroundings of the Rev.
Samuel Wesley and his wife on this autumn evening when they were
together in the gloom of Epworth parsonage; about them were
cruelty, ignorance, bestiality, poverty, malice, a base
materialism, people as coarse as the rough canvas they wore and
bartered; and the Wesleys' inward, spiritual life was harsh and
dark, illuminated only by the horrid glare of Hell-fire. The
countenances of both man and wife bore severe traces of their
misfortunes; Samuel Wesley was a little man, with pale flesh,
withering and crinkling on to the small facial bones, with
shrunken, snuff-coloured eyes and lavender-hued lips, restless
movements, a perpetual frown, and a brow deeply creased with lines
of anxiety; nothing was in harmony in either the spiritual or
material life of this embittered man, bowed before his implacable
God, defeated by a harsh world where he had never received, he was
sure, a fair reward for his gifts and his labours.</p>

<p>Susanna Wesley showed something of the grace and poise of
breeding; she was a gentlewoman and conscious of the fact; there
were aristocrats among her relations; she was also, for a female,
very well educated, and to her husband's chagrin, conscious of that
too. Except for one unhappy episode, when Samuel had been under a
tutor, John Holland, who had proved to be a drunkard and had to be
taken away mad in a cart, Mrs. Wesley had been the sole
instructress of her children, to whom she allowed one day in which
to learn the alphabet and proportionate periods for the acquisition
of other knowledge.</p>

<p>The lighter side of existence had always been avoided with
horror by Mrs. Wesley; as a young girl she had made the resolution
never to spend more time in amusement than in prayer, and by
"amusement" Susanna Annesley meant the decorous distractions
afforded by conversation in her father's house or the reading of
George Herbert's poems.</p>

<p>A few conventional words were exchanged between husband and
wife, and Mrs. Wesley returned to the hall where the children had
finished their tedious lessons; here was beauty, though the worn
mother did not see it, beauty in the small, delicate faces of the
children, in Hetty's red-gold hair, in deformed Molly's "inky locks
and taintless skin," in Sukey's brilliant sparkle of colour and
light, in the tiny, peaked, resolute face of John, exquisitely
neat, precise, and firm, with auburn hair rippling, framing cheeks
tinted like a wild rose, in the earnest face of Patty, so like her
brother's that, dressed similarly, they might have been taken for
two little boys or two little girls.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Wesley lit the rushlights that the children were to take
upstairs she glanced aside at her second son; he was very close in
her affections; she had named him after two dead children, John
Benjamin, and she thought that a peculiar sanctity dwelt on his
pure brow; he was an apt pupil, too, and she admired his powers of
argument that irritated and confounded his father. Partly because
of that, "Jacky will do nothing until he gives a reason for it!"
exclaimed the Reverend Samuel peevishly when John on being offered
a piece of bread replied demurely: "I will think of it." Thus to
reason out all articles of faith and all points of doctrine was
Mrs. Wesley's lifelong habit, and so she persuaded herself that she
approved John, because he was early on the right path; but, in
reality she favoured the boy, because he resembled herself in
character, and she knew that she could mould him into a masculine
version of herself, and that, through him, all that she had had to
suppress and subdue in her personality could be expressed.</p>

<p>The children dropped their curtsies and went upstairs with the
stolid maid to the truckle beds under the thatch, where the absent
swallows had left their tattered nests and the mice scampered
through the straw. Mrs. Wesley seated herself wearily and assumed
her usual smile, that was of so mechanical a tenderness that it
approached hypocrisy, as she called Hetty to her knee and began to
reason with her on her attitude towards her personal
religion&mdash;her doubts, her perplexities, her temptations. Hetty
was nearly eleven years old, brilliant, lovely, and gay; her mother
greatly feared for her, even now while she sat meekly, her hands
folded in her coarse apron, her eyes downcast, listening to the
exposition of the doctrines of death and damnation.</p>

<p>There was a little gentle laughter overhead, and Hetty glanced
up with a vivid smile; Mrs. Wesley rose and called up the stairs
for silence. "The time will come when you will no longer laugh,"
she added grimly, looking over her shoulder at Hetty, for she
suspected the girl of being sly&mdash;that is, of leading some
secret life of her own, which she never showed to God or to her
mother.</p>

<p>The discourse was over. Hetty crept up to bed, and the maid came
down to prepare the house for the morrow; Mrs. Wesley went into the
kitchen to inspect the store of food. How long would the bread
last? How many ash-heap cakes could be made from the flour left in
the bin? The side of bacon had been cut away almost to the bone;
the salt-box was nearly empty, the bunch of herbs pulled almost
bare. How could they exist through the winter with the crops burnt,
the cattle maimed, and what money was coming in to meet the
interest on debts?</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley covered the embers, sent the yawning maid to her bed
in the closet near by the children's bedroom, and taking up a
rushlight went to the study.</p>

<p>The weary Rector had gone to bed; sheets of manuscript were
piled on his desk, books of reference stacked either side of them;
the quills lay in the standish, the ink horn was trim and clean;
Mrs. Wesley set down her humble light and drew a scrap of paper
towards her; she too would indulge in the relief of
self-expression, she would write to Samuel, her once afflicted
eldest son, dedicated by her to God, who had been for nearly five
years at the ancient and celebrated school of Westminster, Saint
Peter's College, by the Abbey on Thorny Island, near London. She
would, for once, give up the last evening hours usually allotted to
communion with God to this letter to Samuel the younger.</p>

<p>"I am concerned for you, who were, even before your birth,
dedicated to the service of the sanctuary, that you may be an
ornament of that Church of which you are a member, and be
instrumental, if God shall spare your life, in bringing many souls
to Heaven. Take heed, therefore, in the first place, of your own
soul, lest you yourself should be a castaway."</p>

<p>The quill shook in her own hand as she thought of the terrible
God whom she served.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that <i>you</i> should be damned? O that it were
<i>impossible!</i> Indeed, I think I could almost wish myself
accursed, so I were sure of your salvation. But still I hope, still
I would fain persuade myself that a child, for whom so many prayers
have been offered to Heaven, will not, at last, miscarry. To the
protection of the ever-blessed God I commit you, humbly beseeching
Him to conduct you by His Grace to His Eternal Glory."</p>

<p>She sealed, addressed her letter, and rose, taking up carefully
her lit reed, floating in the hoarded oil; she was cold, stiff, and
weary, burdened by the child she carried. "His Eternal
Glory"&mdash;what did that mean? Absence of darkness and cold,
relief from child-bearing, enough to eat and rest&mdash;rest?</p>

<p>She went heavily upstairs, the scrapings and rumblings in the
old house with her, step by step.</p>

<p>Her husband was asleep in the bed curtained with patched serge;
she heard his breathing, coming like the sighs of an exhausted
beast, as she went on her knees on the hard boards to pray.</p>

<p>Wizened Charles was asleep in his cradle&mdash;another body to
be fed, another soul to be saved.</p>

<p>Susanna Wesley pulled back the poor blankets and lay down beside
her husband; method&mdash;it could all be accomplished by method;
by the rigid keeping of rules they might yet all attain Heaven;
method&mdash;the repeated word lulled her into an uneasy sleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>
THE NEW PARSONAGE.</h2>

<p class="first">
ONE sordid misfortune after another fell on the Rector of
Epworth; the enemies whom he had made by his pronounced religious
views contrived to deprive him of a chaplaincy that he had
succeeded, with toil and expense, in obtaining from His Grace of
Marlborough, after he had flattered the Commander-in-Chief with a
heroic poem; this further diminished Samuel Wesley's miserable
resources, and it was impossible for him either to pay the interest
due on his large loans or to satisfy small creditors. One of these
was a man named Pinder, a relative of Whichcott's, and he, egged on
by a violent opponent of the Rector, one Robert Harvey, had the
pastor arrested on the steps of his church as he was leaving a
baptismal service. The sum owing was thirty pounds, and it could
have been raised by the sale of furniture and stock, but the harsh
creditor refused even a few hours' grace, and the prisoner was
taken, with brutal haste, to Lincoln Castle.</p>

<p>The Rector of Epworth was lodged in a filthy cell, and met in
the dismal common yard other unhappy debtors, whom he ironically
termed "fellow gaolbirds." These unfortunates soon provided him
with an occupation, with an interest in life; two days after his
arrival in the Castle the energetic little man in his rusty cassock
was catechizing and preaching to the prisoners, besides writing to
the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge for tracts to
distribute among them. This opportunity of showing his zeal almost
compensated the Rector for his lack of liberty; for if he had no
freedom, neither had his congregation; they were forced to listen,
even to appear attentive, lest punishment should fall on them from
the warders; never had Wesley expounded to a larger gathering than
that which he found in Lincoln Castle.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley, tight-lipped, patient, supported her family on the
farm produce, offerings from humane neighbours, and the few pounds
that there were in her husband's chest; her wedding-ring, a brooch,
and a chain she sent to him to buy food with. "'Tis only what I
expected of her," commented her husband. "'Tis not everyone could
bear these things, but, I bless God my wife is less concerned with
suffering them than I in writing them."</p>

<p>This accumulation of disaster, however, did not long endure;
Samuel Wesley's plight was due, at least in the opinion of many, to
his stern opposition to men whom he supposed to be enemies of the
Church and friends of the Dissenters, and the Church came to the
aid of her distressed champion. John Sharp, the Archbishop of York
and a Privy Councillor, had his attention directed to the piteous
case, and interrupted his studies of his ancient see and the
English coinage to inquire into the means of helping the
over-zealous priest.</p>

<p>Money, it appeared, was all that was required; Wesley gave a
frank account of his debts, which amounted to about three hundred
pounds; His Grace of York arranged for the payment of half these
and the liquidation of the rest. The good Archbishop even journeyed
to Epworth to judge for himself the straits to which the Wesleys
were reduced; he was ashamed to see the stark evidences of poverty
in the well-kept home.</p>

<p>"Pray, Mrs. Wesley," he asked, "have you ever really wanted for
<i>bread</i>?"</p>

<p>With harsh irony the worn matron replied: "Truly, my lord, I
cannot say that I have ever been without bread, strictly speaking,
but I had so much care to get it, and so much trouble to pay for
it, as made it taste very unpleasant to me. I think that to have
bread on these terms is the next degree of wretchedness to having
no bread at all."</p>

<p>Moved by this from a woman of good birth, who numbered knights
and nobles among her relations, His Grace placed a handsome present
of money on the bare table; Mrs. Wesley's thanks were stately; she
considered that "the comfortable reflections" that the Archbishop
must have received from his good deed were sufficient
repayment.</p>

<p>A hundred and eighty-four pounds was subscribed for the
Wesleys&mdash;the Queen gave forty-three pounds&mdash;"a frightful
sum, if one saw it all together," wrote the Rector, who had
"thanked God upon his knees" for this bounty. He was fulsome in his
gratitude, and assured Dr. Sharp that if he reached Heaven first
"none shall go before me in welcoming Your Lordship into
everlasting habitations where you will be tried no more with my
misfortunes and follies."</p>

<p>After three months of not unexciting sojourn in Lincoln Castle
the Rector was released, freed at last from the burden of debt,
grimly self-righteous, eager to print a "vindication" and to
triumph over his enemies in the Fens. So unforgiving was his
attitude on his return to Epworth that his well-wishers advised him
to leave a parish where he aroused so dangerous a hostility. Even
Archbishop Sharp thought that it would be wiser to place this
fierce flock in the charge of a more discreet shepherd, but Samuel
Wesley replied: "I confess I am not of that mind, because I may yet
do some good here; and 'tis like a coward to desert my post when
the enemy fire is thick upon me. They have only wounded me yet,
and, I believe, can't kill me."</p>

<p>And, truly, there occurred an event not long after the Rector's
return from prison that seemed as if God at last was taking some
part in avenging His faithful servant.</p>

<p>One of the more genial faults of the Fen men was intemperance,
and Robert Darwin, returning from Bawtry Fair in a state of
intoxication, fell from his horse and was kicked to death. His neck
was dislocated, but his friends "pulled it in again" and he lived
"till the next day, but he never spoke more." This disaster, clear
evidence of the avenging hand of the Lord, raised Mrs. Wesley's
spirits considerably. She wrote thus of the dead man to young
Samuel: "he was one of the most implacable enemies your father had
among his parishioners; one that insulted him most basely in his
troubles; one that was ready to do him all the mischief he could,
not to mention his affronts to me and the children and how heartily
he wished our ruin, which God permitted him not to see." With
lively satisfaction Susanna Wesley dwelt on the miserable end of
one who had mocked the Lord's anointed: "His face was torn all to
pieces, one of his eyes beat out, his under-lip cut off, his nose
broken down; and in short, he was one of the dreadfullest examples
of the severe justice of God that I have ever known. This man and
one more have been cut off in the midst of their sins since your
father's confinement."</p>

<p>The malice of the Evil One had, however, by no means finished
with the Wesleys. On a February night, in the year 1709, Hetty was
awakened by a bright glow in the bedroom, and, rousing, felt a
warmth at her feet that gave her a horrid foretaste of Hell; the
thatched roof was on fire and blazing fragments were falling on the
bed. Hetty's cry of "Fire! Fire!" was echoed by similar shouts from
the street; the Rector was roused, and leaping to his door pulled
it open on flames; telling his wife and Emilia, who was sleeping in
the closet near-by, to shift for themselves, he rushed to the
bedroom where five children slept with the maid; clad in scanty
night garments the family fled to the hall that gave on to the
street; the front door was locked, and the keys forgotten upstairs;
the Rector dashed back for them and rejoined the others as the
staircase caught fire. The door was now unlocked, but the
north-east wind drove the flames from the outside of the house
inwards through the opening, so that it appeared impossible to pass
them; some of the children climbed through the windows, others, the
maid and the infant Charles, escaped through a side door, but Mrs.
Wesley, far gone in pregnancy, could neither scramble up to the
window nor get to the garden exit; thrice she tried to battle
through the flames to the street door, but was as often driven
back. The fourth time she took the name of God on her lips and
waded through the fire to the street, where she arrived naked, her
shift burnt from her back, but unharmed save for a few
scorches...</p>

<p>The little street was crowded with people staring at the blazing
Rectory; the sparks from the flaming thatch and timber were flying
up brilliantly into the winter night, and it was impossible to save
the old building, filled with wooden furniture, even had anyone
been minded to do so, and no one had brought as much as a pail of
water to the rescue. The Rector, his gaunt figure in the torn
night-shirt, illuminated by the flames, now counted heads; one was
missing, one child had been left behind in the nursery; Samuel
Wesley rushed back into the burning house; he thought that he heard
a cry from the nursery, and tried in vain to pass up the blazing
staircase; but this crashed in before him, and he retired to that
portion of the hall not yet flaming and, sinking on his naked
knees, commended the lost child's soul to God.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the watchers in the street saw a small linen-clad
figure and a delicate child's face peering from an upper window;
the little fellow was standing on a chest, against a background of
flames.</p>

<p>There were brave and humane men among the fierce Fen people; one
now cried out: "Fetch a ladder!" Another answered: "There is no
time! I will stand against the wall, set a light man on my
shoulders and so we will hand the child down!"</p>

<p>This was done and the boy passed down, as the roof sank in where
he had been sleeping; as he came to the ground he ran to his
mother, now wrapped in a neighbour's blanket, and explained with
much composure that the light in the room had awakened him; he had
thought that it was day-time and had called out to the maid to take
him from the bed; on receiving no reply, he had peered through the
curtains, for he had now a full-sized bed to himself, and had seen
streaks of fire running along the ceiling; hurrying to the door he
had opened on a wall of flames; he had then climbed on to the chest
to gaze from the window at the friendly, excited faces, picked out
from the shadow below by the glow of the fire. He was not
frightened, and his mother, exultant with a sense of high destiny,
clasped him to her heart. "Is not this," she cried, "a brand
plucked from the burning?"</p>

<p>Overawed by her sibyl-like aspect and the seeming miracle of the
salvation of the Rector's brood, the boldest of the crowd followed
curiously, half timidly, to the house where Samuel Wesley had taken
refuge from the bitter night air: "John!" exclaimed the rapt
father. "John is saved! Come, neighbours, let us give thanks to
God, let us kneel down! All my eight children are safe, and I care
not for the house!"</p>

<p>The Rector of Epworth found this heroic mood hard to sustain the
next day when he walked amid the black ruins of his home and
furniture, and the bitter thought would obtrude itself: "If God had
saved the children from the flames, who had ignited the thatch at
dead of night, when all lights were out, all embers covered?" His
enemies, of course, and he feared, for all the noble intervention
of Archbishop Sharp, that he was a ruined man again.</p>

<p>Nothing could be salvaged from this heap of ruins save some old
iron that had once formed household utensils; all linen, clothes,
furniture, and household stuff, a sum of money sufficient to
provide for the rest of the winter, the precious books and
manuscripts&mdash;all&mdash;all gone, even the notes for the
Rector's projected work on the Book of Job. Samuel Wesley,
shivering in his borrowed coat, saw a patch of white among the
charred embers&mdash;a portion of a leaf of his treasured, costly
polyglot Bible&mdash;"<i>Vade; vende omnia quae habes, et attolle
crucem, et sequere Me."</i> The first part of this exhortation
seemed ironic&mdash;how could Samuel Wesley sell all he had, when
he had just been stripped of everything? But "take up thy cross and
follow Me" might be regarded as a grim command to endure this
calamity with fortitude.</p>

<p>Fortitude was indeed required; the Rector certainly had now
sufficient credit to enter upon the building of another house and
the stocking of another farm, but while this work was being done
the family had to scatter, far from the vigilant eye of the mother,
lodged in the houses of friends or boarded in those of
strangers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley bitterly lamented this trial from which many evils
resulted; the children, who had been so pious, so perfectly in
subjection to their parents, came into contact with libertine
natures, were allowed to learn profane songs, to indulge in games
and romps "and other bad things," as the anxious mother complained,
that they had not known before. A "clownish accent and rude ways"
were also acquired that further depressed the precise gentlewoman,
and it was with a deep sense of the time and labour required to
reform these bad habits that she once more gathered round her in
the new Rectory the brood that had been increased by the birth of
the delicate Keziah, the nineteenth and last child of Samuel Wesley
and his wife. The new building was a considerable improvement upon
the old, and Mrs. Wesley looked round at her home with rare
satisfaction, while the children, despite her stern checkings, ran
about excitedly inspecting the imposing domain. Soon after they
were installed in the new parsonage a keen excitement entered the
lives of husband and wife. Mr. Wesley naturally took a personal
interest in the trial of Dr. Henry Sacheverell, Chaplain of St.
Saviour's, Southwark, that took place in 1710. This divine had
advocated in sermons, preached at St. Paul's, London, and at Derby,
the Tory, High Church cause so dear to the heart of Samuel Wesley,
and he hastened up to London to assist the persecuted champion of
the Church of England, who was declared by the House of Commons to
be guilty of seditious libels and by the excited people to be a
martyr. Samuel Wesley threw himself with much feeling into the case
and helped Simon Harcourt, Sacheverell's advocate, to compose the
speech for the defence.</p>

<p>While, however, he was engaged in this congenial occupation, his
own parish was suffering from the lack of his zeal, the
curate-in-charge was indifferent to the welfare of the souls of the
people of Epworth, and the scanty congregations further dwindled.
Mrs. Wesley felt, as she wrote to her husband, that during the
Rector's absence it was her duty to look after the souls placed in
his care, and she did not consider that mere Sunday attendance at
church was sufficient by way of showing religious zeal. She
therefore began to hold services for herself, her children, and the
servants in the parlour of the Rectory; prayers were read, psalms
sung, and when the three boys came home for the holidays their fine
voices and ready turn for singing added beauty and grace to these
services; Susanna Wesley felt much diffidence at preaching a little
sermon. "I never durst positively to hope," she said, "that God
would make use of me in doing good. But with God all things are
possible&mdash;or, as George Herbert better expresses
it:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Only&mdash;since God doth often vessels make<br>
Of lowly matter, for high uses meet&mdash;<br>
I throw myself at his feet.<br>
There will I lie, until my Maker seek<br>
For some mean stuff, thereon to show his skill;<br>
Then is my time."</p>


<p><br>
Mrs. Wesley was further encouraged by a book that Emilia had
found in her father's desk, which gave an account of the labours of
two Danish missionaries who had gone out to convert the heathen at
Tranequebar; for several days Susanna Wesley could think of little
else, and such a zeal was stirred in her that she conceived the
idea of trying to convert the heathen near at hand, the brutish
peasants of the Isle of Axholme. She therefore threw open the
parsonage services to all, and as many as two hundred crowded to
hear the Rector's wife preach zealously and the Rector's children
sing sweetly in the side parlour of the new parsonage. This novelty
was much liked; those who had not been to church for years attended
Mrs. Wesley's services, and many people had to be turned away. The
curate, however, and some of the parishioners sent strong protests
to the Rector, and he was inclined to agree; stung by the
strong-minded woman's encroachment upon his domain, he wrote to her
that her proceeding was "very singular," and suggested that a
member of the congregation might read the prayers.</p>

<p>An acrimonious correspondence ensued between husband and wife;
Mrs. Wesley held her ground with spirit; the complaining curate
could bring but twenty-five people to the church, she could bring
between two and three hundred to the parsonage, and she marvelled
how her husband "could be prevailed upon by the senseless clamours
of two or three of the worst of your parish" to try to stop the
successful meetings that were bringing so many lost souls to God.
Thus faced, Samuel Wesley gave way, and the meetings continued
until he returned from London, soured both by the failure of Dr.
Sacheverell to secure an acquittal and by the striking evidence
that his wife was more capable of doing his work than he was
himself. Thus thwarted in two directions, Samuel Wesley turned to
the subject that had lately excited his family&mdash;missionary
labours in the benighted East; he interrupted his studies on the
Book of Job to draw up a scheme "for enquiring into the state of
Christianity in all our factories and settlements from St. Helena
to the farthest Eastern countries." He particularly wished to visit
Abyssinia, China, and India, and he thought that some economy of
time and money might be made by seizing on "the half converts," the
heathen who had come under the influence of the Jesuits, and who
might be really induced to accept "the one true faith, that of the
Church of England."</p>

<p>The energetic Rector was prepared to risk health and life in
this great enterprise, if in the East India Company "or other
where" might be found the means of providing a hundred pounds a
year salary for himself, forty pounds a year for a curate for
Epworth and some provision for his family in case he fell a martyr
to his zeal.</p>

<p>But no one was prepared to send Mr. Wesley on these arduous
travels, and he had to turn his energies again to the elucidation
of the obscurities of the Book of Job, to vigorous attempts to make
the farm pay, to supervising his family and his flock, who now
showed very little of their ancient hostility towards the Wesleys,
partly because of the effect produced by Mrs. Wesley's preaching,
and partly because of the fire that had so nearly consumed so many
innocent human beings and that had shocked the better feelings of
most of the Fenlanders; the people of Epworth had, besides, been
impressed by the salvation of the Rector's family in a manner that
seemed almost miraculous and by the stern fortitude with which the
Rector and his wife had borne their disaster; in consequence active
torment of the Wesleys had ceased and the parishioners had shown
some interest in, and good will towards, the new parsonage.</p>

<p>At first, peace and hope seemed to reign in the family after all
their trials; Mrs. Wesley began another plan of education, sternly
insisted on a rigid discipline for every moment of the day, and set
herself to reform whatever faults her children had acquired while
out of her charge. She had now more energy for these tasks, since
she had no more children after the birth of Kezzy in 1710, and was
therefore no longer "laid by" for several months of the year
through sickness; materially, too, she was more at ease: the farm
produced food and fuel, linen and wool, labour was cheap and good,
at first at least, the different harvests showed profits, and the
Rector was able now and then to take one of the horses and to amble
up to London, either to attend a conference&mdash;thrice he was
elected to represent the Diocese in Convocation&mdash;or to argue
with the booksellers about some of his own works. Young Samuel,
too, pious, gifted, hard-working, had become after two years at
Christ Church an usher at Westminster School and could keep himself
while he studied for his degree and to enter holy orders. John at
the age of ten years had gone to Charterhouse School on the
foundation, through the favour of his father's one-time patron, the
Marquess of Normanby, now Duke of Buckingham. Charles had outgrown
his early delicacy, he was pretty and intelligent, with an
exquisite ear for music, and showed a great zest in the singing of
songs and hymns; so Mrs. Wesley might have considered herself
blessed as regards worldly matters and able to turn her full
attention to the terrible task of saving her own soul and those of
her children. She had now lost nine of them and ten survived, seven
being at home in Epworth Rectory; of these the three eldest girls,
Emilia, Susanna, and Mary, were grown women, and the first two were
well-trained, capable housewives, able to help their mother with
the younger children, while the saintly piety and facial loveliness
of the deformed Mary balanced the too high spirits and daring
sallies of the charming Hetty, then a maiden growing daily in
beauty. Three little girls, Anne, Martha, and Keziah, shared the
nursery and the schoolroom with Charles, who was being taught Latin
by his father in preparation for his entry into Westminster
School.</p>

<p>The household was completed by servants who drudged patiently,
if sullenly, under the stern rule of Susanna Wesley, and by the
"docile hind" who looked after the farm.</p>

<p>So the family fortunes were at pause; there was that lull in the
home life which comes after the last child is born, until the first
child goes out into the world; most of the boys and girls were past
the most tedious part of their education, and had not yet
disappointed any of the hopes formed from their early promise; only
the merry natures of Sukey and Hetty caused their mother some
anxiety. Mrs. Wesley approved of John especially, who grew more and
more in her likeness, and who had distinguished himself at
Charterhouse by his intelligence, his aptitude for learning, the
spirit with which he held his own among the younger boys, and the
courage with which he challenged the elder boys, who tried to filch
the meat allotted to the juniors; in this they were often
successful, and John for all his courage lived at school, as he had
lived at home, mainly on bread. He was, however, one of the
healthiest of the Wesley children, not afflicted with the poor
eyesight of Samuel and Charles nor with the constant illnesses that
made life miserable for Mary and Keziah. And Mrs. Wesley, when he
came home for the holidays, rejoiced in his confident air, his
bright glance, his personal neatness, his delicate, firm
countenance, the cheerful eagnerness with which he sang hymns
constantly in his true, pleasant voice.</p>

<p>Susanna Wesley now gave herself more earnestly to communion with
God; morning, evening, and during the afternoon she put on her
well-kept, better clothes, and thus spotlessly attired she shut
herself in her chamber, closed her mind to all worldly thoughts and
desires, and endeavoured to get into touch with her God. As she was
no mystic, but a very practical woman, the result of this effort
was merely a forcing inwards of her mind on to abstractions that
were to her only formulae; the love of God, the sacrifice of
Christ, the sinfulness of humanity, the prospects of Heaven and
Hell.</p>

<p>Once it seemed to her that she had obtained the grace of God or
provoked the malice of the Devil, for while praying alone in her
room she heard three loud knocks on the door that could be by no
means accounted for, since that portion of the house was then
empty. Nor was this disturbance the only manifestation of the
supernatural noticed in Epworth parsonage; the scratchings and
rustlings, so common and so easily accounted for in the old
thatched, plaster house, continued in the modern brick building
where it was difficult even for the practical-minded to find an
explanation of them.</p>

<p>These strange happenings came to a climax in the winter of 1716.
On a December night when the Rector was in his study, the girls in
the parlour, and the children in bed, a maid who had newly entered
the Wesleys' service rushed into the sitting-room and told the
girls, whispering over their own affairs by the firelight, that she
had heard "a terrible and astonishing noise," which she thought was
the outcry of "one in extremis, about to die," in the hall, near
the dining-room door; on hurrying to this spot, however, she had
found no one. The girls laughed the tale aside, but during the next
fortnight they themselves continually heard these groans and cries,
and hollow knocking in three times three, much like the Rector's
own well-known signal, but by no means to be taken for it, so loud,
dismal and unearthly did it sound, and in such lonely places, where
there was no human agency to account for it, did it occur. A
curious noise that was compared by those who heard it to the rattle
of a meat-jack on being wound up or to the clatter of a windmill
when it reverses owing to a changed wind preceded the disturbances
that were noticed by all the children and servants, though the
Rector and his wife appeared to be unaware of what was taking place
in the parsonage. After a fortnight of wonder and alarm, Emilia and
Sukey put the matter before their mother; Mrs. Wesley's orderly
mind detested the unaccountable, yet, as an earnest Christian, she
was forced to believe in miracles, in a supernatural world, and in
the possibility of God's permitting many mysteries and wonders,
without vouchsafing any explanation whatsoever. However, natural
common sense prevailed so far over superstition as to make Mrs.
Wesley declare that she believed the commotion was caused by rats.
She pointed out the long, unused garret that ran over the whole
length of the house and that was certainly infested with these
vermin, the size and number of the rooms, most of them half empty,
and the winter darkness which was only scattered by scarce fires,
poor lamps, and tapers or rushlights.</p>

<p>Emilia thought that this incredulity smacked of blasphemy, and
Mrs. Wesley had an uneasy feeling that she might be right, when the
knocks were repeated violently in her presence, and she recalled
similar blows on her own door several years before.</p>

<p>With mingled awe and horror she suspected that this might be the
ghost of her son Samuel, who had not written from Westminster for
some time, but before accepting this terrible idea she resolved to
put it to the test by trying to discover if, after all, the noises
were not caused by rats, or some small field animals that might
have come into the house. She therefore summoned Robin Brown, the
farm hand who helped in the kitchen, and bade him blow a horn on
the staircase in order to frighten any living creatures away. The
contrary effect to that hoped for was obtained; as if infuriated by
a challenge, the invisible power now began to set up a din by day
as well as by night, and Mrs. Wesley, as well as the children and
servants, was tormented by different noises interspersed with
continual knocking; sounds, as if a heavy chain had been dashed
down, of breaking pots, of jingled coins, of the breaking of coals
or stones, the gobbling of a turkey cock, and the drag of drapery
across the floor, were now continuous.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley was most vexed at this upset in her orderly
establishment, at the gradual spread of hysteria in the inmates of
the Rectory, and yet tortured by the suspicion that this might be
Samuel trying to tell her that he was dead&mdash;and perhaps
damned.</p>

<p>At last she went to her husband, who so far had heard nothing,
and put the case before him. Samuel Wesley also had a strong,
native common sense. He looked up from poring over the legendary
marvels of the Book of Job that it would have been infidelity to
discredit and said instinctively, angry at being disturbed: "Sukey,
I am ashamed of you. Those boys and girls frighten one another, but
you are a woman of sense and should know better. Let me hear no
more of it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley, however, persisted in her view that as the noises
had continued for eight weeks and as he, the Rector, had been the
only one that had not heard them, they might portend his own
approaching decease or else the death of Samuel in London.</p>

<p>But the Rector returned wrathfully from the wonders in his own
house to the wonders in the Old Testament and sent Mrs. Wesley back
to the girls.</p>

<p>These were now in a state of violent agitation, alternately
laughing and crying, clinging together as they passed from one room
to another, and refusing to settle to work on duties; the children
Anne, Patty, and Kezzy were alarmed and nervous, the invalid Mary
cast herself into a religious ecstasy, continually singing hymns
and praying, while Charles, who was absorbed in his studies and his
religious duties, kept a cooler head and considered the
disturbances with intense curiosity.</p>

<p>These marvels then took on an even stranger aspect; the very
night after the Rector had rebuked his wife for her credulity, he
was roused by the hollow three-times-three knocks that sounded as if
a heavy stick had been struck on a chest; Samuel Wesley was soon
out of bed and pulling on his breeches; he was still not persuaded
that some trick was not being played on him; the girls were far too
wilful, and Hetty, at least, he did not trust; he lit his candle
and armed with his pistol went through the Rectory, room by room,
searching in every cupboard and corner and even inspecting the dark
and dismal garrets.</p>

<p>The elder daughters soon understood his suspicions; he thought
that they were working up a panic to cover up some intrigues of
their own&mdash;possibly even the presence of a lover in the
house.</p>

<p>No stranger was found, however, lurking in the Rectory that cold
winter night, and from then on the invisible creature, as if angry
at having its supernatural origin doubted, began to display some of
its powers to the Rector; all the warming-pans, saucepans, and
kitchen utensils began to clang and rattle on the walls in
unearthly discords; doors opened and banged when no one was near
them; latches moved up and down by themselves; lumps of coal leaped
from the hods to dash on the floor; boots and shoes danced in their
places, and the pride of Mrs. Wesley's housewifery, a pewter
tea-set, jumped off the shelf.</p>

<p>Soon the whole family was caught up into an atmosphere of awe
and wonder; each member of the household infected and reinfected
the others with dread and amazement; marvel on marvel was passed
from lip to lip and implicitly believed; some said they felt
themselves pushed by an invisible object as they passed from one
room to another; Robin saw the empty corn-mill grind round and
round and wished it had been full; the girls heard "the rapid steps
of a man in jack-boots on the stairs&mdash;he was trailing a
nightgown after him." A storm rose over the island, and the
inhabitants of the parsonage were sure that it shook their house
with peculiar violence; the wind seemed to take up residence in the
new brick building, which "shook from top to bottom," and howled in
the long garret already full of dismal rumblings.</p>

<p>The nursemaid reported that the little ones moaned and sweated
in their sleep, Robin declared that the watch-dog howled in
continuous dread and refused to leave his side; levitation began;
Mary's bed was hoisted up "several times to a considerable
height"; when she swept out a room, the sounds of an invisible
broom followed her; one of her sisters reported that some
silver coins had fallen out of the wall into her lap.</p>

<p>Samuel Wesley kept his head in this fantastic atmosphere, where
everything seemed possible; he could no longer doubt that some
visitor from the invisible world was in his house; he had been
himself so rudely jostled that the powder flew from his wig, and at
one Sunday dinner his trencher had risen on end and executed a jig
until "an adventurous wretch took it up and spoiled the sport, for
it remained still ever afterwards." Then, a peculiar affront had
been put upon the Rector's political views; whenever, during family
prayers, he put up a petition for the King or the Prince of Wales,
angry and mocking noises were heard, showing that the spirit, like
Mrs. Wesley, was Jacobite at heart. Stung on a tender point, the
dauntless Rector prayed twice over for His Majesty, thus provoking
a double disturbance from the outraged spirit, to which Mr. Wesley
replied&mdash;"that no doubt His Majesty had no wish to be popular
with the Devil." The Rector's study was, however, for a long time
respected, until he defied the ghost "as a deaf-and-dumb devil" to
visit him and settle the matter (whatever it might be) man to
man.</p>

<p>This challenge was accepted with a violent knock that nearly
shattered the wall boards, and henceforth the Rector had his full
share of the disturbances.</p>

<p>The great question now arose: Who&mdash;or what&mdash;was the
ghost?</p>

<p>The memory of a former inhabitant of the Rectory hung about the
place; this character had been sufficiently strange for the
suspicion of his survival after death to be easily believed, and
the odd noises in the ancient parsonage had been put down to "old
Jeffrey." This name, therefore, was readily given to the disturber
of the peace in the new parsonage, and the servants and children
referred familiarly to "old Jeffrey" as if to another inhabitant of
the household.</p>

<p>Mr. Wesley, however, remained far from convinced of the identity
of the ghost, and decided to take sterner measures than he had
hitherto used, especially as the waggons jolting from Lincoln with
the London mail brought no letter from Samuel. A relation, Dr.
Matthew Wesley, sent at this juncture an invitation to Sukey to
join him in London, and she was sent off with warm injunctions to
enquire after the welfare of her brother. Shortly before her
departure Sukey was writing a letter, when an infernal noise was
made all about her, and the night after she had left "old Jeffrey"
"knocked till morning with scarce any intermission."</p>

<p>Mr. Wesley now invited Mr. Hoole, a neighbouring clergyman of
considerable reputation as an exorcist, to visit the parsonage;
when he arrived the situation was gravely and fully explained to
him, and he agreed to do his best to discover the nature of the
visitant&mdash;of his identity Mr. Hoole was more than suspicious,
and he and Mr. Wesley agreed, not without relish, that they were
probably faced with some activity of the prime enemy of man, Satan
himself. "But two good Christians should be a match for him,"
declared the Rector.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley triumphantly related that she had commanded the
spirit to leave her in peace when she was engaged in her private
devotions, and that these sacred hours had not been disturbed; this
seemed like a reproach to the Rector, whose study was so frequently
invaded, and he urged Mr. Hoole to spare no efforts to rout the
intruder.</p>

<p>The day passed quietly, however, and it was not until after ten
at night that the maidservant came into the parlour to gasp out
that the ghost had arrived; the two clergymen, formidable in black
habits, bands, powdered wigs, Wesley grasping a pistol, ran up to
the nursery. There, by the light of a lamp, the exorcist beheld the
manifestations of "old Jeffrey"; the children gasped, shuddered,
and became covered with sweat in their sleep, the beds were heaved
up, the clothes tugged off; there was the usual violent knocking on
the wall, three times three; Mr. Wesley became so exasperated at
this that he pointed his pistol at the panelling and would have
fired had not Mr. Hoole restrained him by saying: "Sir, you are
convinced that this is something preternatural; if so, your attack
cannot hurt it, and may give it power to hurt you."</p>

<p>Thereupon the Rector put up his pistol and the company went to
the girls' room, where Emilia and Hetty, laughing with excitement,
were seated on a bed that was being pushed up into the air. The
exorcist had to confess himself baffled, and the visitations
continued, nor was there any answer to the dauntless Rector's
solemn command: "If you are the ghost of my son Samuel, give one
knock only!"</p>

<p>This doubt was soon removed, however, by a letter from the young
usher, who was alive and well. Minute accounts of the hauntings
from various members of the family were sent to both the brothers;
Samuel and John were intensely interested in the phenomena; the
elder son asked: "Have you dug on the spot where the silver pieces
fell out?" in the hope that the spirit was a kindly one that had
come to point out the existence of buried treasure; while John was
inclined to think that "old Jeffrey" was an imp of Satan, sent to
torment his father because of his quarrel with his wife over the
prayers for King William. The hauntings had long died away when
John came home from Charterhouse School to prepare for his entrance
into Oxford, but he at once eagerly questioned all the witnesses to
"old Jeffrey's" activities; by then the ghost had become so
familiar in the parsonage that the girls jested about it, and
little Kezzy declared that it was great sport to chase "old
Jeffrey" from room to room, though Emilia confessed that the noises
had strengthened her belief in the spiritual world that she had
found waning. The spirit had, as Samuel noted, attached itself with
peculiar persistency to Hetty and made some of its more violent
manifestations when she was alone with her father in the Rectory,
and her suspicious parent was still not without occasional twinges
of doubt whether the lively girl, sentimental and sly, was not
playing tricks with the help of a lover. But nothing whatever to
support this theory could be discovered, and even Mr. Wesley was
forced to believe in the supernatural origin of "old Jeffrey,"
although quite in the dark whether the spirit came from Heaven or
Hell and what its message might be.</p>

<p>John witnessed none of the phenomena himself, but he accepted
without question and drew up an account of the whole business,
adding, unconsciously, several embellishments of his own to the
strange story. So "old Jeffrey" left Epworth parsonage, but he was
never forgotten by any member of the Wesley family; on some of the
young people he made a deep impression; this absolute proof of the
existence of an invisible world was more effective in inducing a
blind belief in God than all Mr. Wesley's carefully prepared
sermons and all Mrs. Wesley's dismal exhortations.</p>

<p>Where had the creature come from, if not from Heaven or Hell?
Such places, then, existed, and as "old Jeffrey" was possible,
anything else might be. The mind of John, unimaginative, intensely
curious, was most profoundly impressed by the sworn testimony of so
many people to the existence of this supernatural creature. He was
a pious boy, so exact in his religious observances that he had been
admitted to the Communion table when eight years old, and in his
case faith in Christianity as taught by the Church of England and
credulity blended into one strong belief. He was not troubled by
any doubts or questioning on the subject; he logically argued that,
if one was to accept the Anglican doctrine, one might as well
accept "old Jeffrey."</p>

<p>John was ambitious as well as pious and quite resolute, and at
present his ambitions were centred on being a good
Christian&mdash;thus evading Hell fire&mdash;and a well-educated
man, thus evading a life of penury. In order to gain the former end
he had drawn up a set of rules, following his mother's principle of
"method," and the means whereby he now "hoped to be saved"
were:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">1. Not being as bad as other people.<br>
2. Having still a kindness for religion, and<br>
3. reading the Bible, going to church, and saying my prayers.</p>

<br>

<p>These rules were easily kept by one trained from infancy to do
so, and John felt no inclination for the coarse vices, the
laziness, and the corruption that he saw about him in London; used
to order and the strict observance of strict rules, and with these
two definite objects before him&mdash;to save his soul and to
secure a good worldly position&mdash;he found no more difficulty in
keeping up regular observances of religion than he did in obeying
his father's injunction to run thrice round the school yard every
morning in order to preserve his health.</p>

<p>But the Epworth ghost was outside these cut-and-dried rules;
here was something unaccountable that had to be taken on
faith&mdash;that was, as it were, an instance of all the
unexplainable matters that God had not deigned to make clear to
mankind. In this mood John interviewed his sisters and the servants
and transcribed all the entries in his father's diary that referred
to "old Jeffrey."</p>

<p>What neither he nor anyone else did was to make a full, cool
investigation of these marvels, so that "old Jeffrey's" claim to be
a supernatural creature rests on a jumble of evidence taken down at
random from a number of witnesses, some peasants, some children,
some young girls who may well, as the Rector himself first
suggested, "have frightened one another" into collective hysteria,
or been the willing victims of some trickster with mediumistic
powers.</p>

<p>No one seemed to notice that the noises and sights were of a
very homely nature, such as it was in the power of any country
household to provide&mdash;the sound of a jack being wound up,
coals being smashed, crockery dashed down, and so on; there would
have been no difficulty in a clever, artful person's making,
especially in the night and by artificial light, these noises with
domestic utensils; doors are easily unlatched and pushed open by a
light-footed person who is quick and cunning in such a way as to
seem supernatural, and once a thrilling atmosphere of ghostly
adventure is abroad in a household and every inmate infected with a
delicious excitement, the most ordinary occurrences will take on an
unearthly air.</p>

<p>As for the rappings, the levitations, the dancing of the
trenchers and the pewter services, and the agitation of the
sleeping children: these are common features of all such
manifestations, always admitting that they took place, and must
remain among other unsolved mysteries of this type. Many of them
were present in the "Cock Lane ghost" case that stirred all London
in 1760, and was finally discovered to be an imposture. If
Elizabeth Parsons, "a little artful girl about eleven years of
age," could trick the sharpest minds in the capital for a long
period, it is not difficult to credit that one of the children in
Epworth parsonage could have imposed on an enclosed household of
excited young people long enough for the harder heads of Samuel and
Susanna Wesley to be made giddy and confused. Besides, these two
staunch Christians were bound to allow themselves to be deceived,
for to doubt "savoured of infidelity," as Emilia sharply reminded
her mother.</p>

<p>Nor was the evidence, vague and untrustworthy as it was, fully
tested. It is unfortunate that neither Samuel nor John thought of
putting a few straight questions to their sisters and the servants,
such as: "Of what coinage were the silver pieces that fell from the
wall? Who had loose money in the house, was any missed, was this
hoard part of it? How could the girls tell that the sound of
dragging drapery was that of a <i>nightgown?</i> Of what nature
were these storms that shook a new solid-brick building 'from top
to bottom'? Did the other houses in Epworth suffer in the same way?
Moreover, and most important of all, was constant watch kept over
the long, disused garret that ran the whole length of the house and
might easily have hidden someone who was making the knocks and the
other noises?"</p>

<p>No attempt at this kind of investigation was made, so "old
Jeffrey" must remain a tantalizing mystery.</p>

<p>After the commotion caused by the ghost had died away and as
there was no return of his tricks, the Wesleys settled down to a
humdrum way of life. Charles was sent to Westminster, partly at the
charges of his brother Samuel, who was now mingling with
distinguished company in London. Alexander Pope, Francis Atterbury,
and Robert Harley were among the associates of the young
schoolmaster, who was much liked for his amiable character and
warmly admired for his gifts; in 1718 he obtained his degree and
fulfilled the vow that his mother had made before his birth by
taking Holy Orders.</p>

<p>The remaining cost of his third son's schooling did not fall on
Mr. Wesley; this was defrayed by a Mr. Garrett Wesley, who had some
claim to belong to another branch of the same family. Other burdens
were lifted from the ageing Rector's shoulders, but not altogether
to his satisfaction, though he was delighted when John obtained an
exhibition of forty pounds per annum from Charterhouse and entered
Christ Church, Oxford, June 24, 1720; he had previously waited on
Dr. Sacheverell with a letter of introduction from his father, and
found the famous divine "as tall as a Maypole, as proud as an
archbishop," and disgustingly discouraging&mdash;as successful age
is inclined to be to aspiring youth.</p>

<p>John was "a very little fellow," who looked younger than his
years, and the haughty and fashionable clergyman told him to return
to school and learn more Latin and Greek before he thought of the
University. This tone was unendurable to John, who "despised" his
mentor "in his heart," and thought that he knew far more of the
classics than did Sacheverell, and "looking at him as David did
Goliath" resolved that no commands nor entreaties would make him
return to seek patronage in this quarter, and so, dauntless and
iron-willed, John went to Oxford to live on his forty pounds and
any help his father could squeeze from the glebe lands or his
pastoral dues.</p>

<p>Other children left the Rectory, and under less happy
circumstances. After dangling high hopes in front of the eager
girl, an uncle in India decided not to leave Sukey any money, and
not to return to England, and Dr. Matthew Wesley could no longer
keep her in his London house. She returned home in despair to face
a life of drudgery, rural seclusion, and the iron piety of her
father and mother, who were straining along the road to Heaven with
a bitter fervour that grew sharper with their increasing fatigue.
In order to escape this rigid home poor Sukey made a hasty marriage
with a neighbouring gentleman of means and position, one Richard
Ellison, who was so disliked by the Wesleys that the Rector called
him "a wen on the family," and Mrs. Wesley wrote of him in these
terms to her brother, whom she blamed for the match: "My second
daughter, Sukey, a pretty woman and worthy of a better fate, when
by your unkind letters she perceived that all her hopes in you were
frustrated, rashly threw herself upon a man, if man he may be
called, that is little inferior to the apostate angels in
wickedness, that is not only her plague but a constant affliction
to the family."</p>

<p>Emilia, who for many years had faithfully toiled beside her
mother in running the thrifty, pinched household, had at last
broken away from home to teach in a boarding-school for girls in
Lincoln; she was handsome, spirited, sharp-tempered, and had been
unlucky in an affection for a man who had not wanted her. She had
also had considerable differences with her parents and "wished to
be out of their sight." In Lincoln she was comparatively happy; the
school, though strict, seemed freedom compared to her mother's
rule, and her salary was wealth when compared to her father's
penury.</p>

<p>Four daughters remained at home; the youngest, Keziah, was ten
years old when John entered Christ Church, and she, like her
sisters, was completing her education under her mother's eye. The
girls were all equally well-trained in religious and domestic
duties, and all were gifted; Emilia was eloquent and dramatic, a
superb reader of the magnificent lines of Milton; Hetty was a
brilliant versifier, a good Greek scholar as well as a wit and a
beauty; all had musical talent, and Mary, who had, as she said,
"lived in a state of affliction ever since I was born, being the
ridicule of mankind and the reproach of my family," had a gift for
piety that rendered her "half angelic" and an object of adoration
to her family.</p>

<p>The years with their burden of disappointment and monotony had
not softened the stern spirit of Samuel Wesley; his strength of
character, the unyielding fortitude of his wife, and the
fascination of his gifted family had gradually worn away most of
the fierce opposition with which he had once had to contend; the
Fenlanders had become used to this grim vicegerent of God, even
fond of him and disposed to regard with pride his bold severity and
the harshness with which he upheld Church discipline. His vigilance
against the wiles and lures of Satan was still unremitting; lax
morality and breaches of Church rule were sternly noted and quickly
brought to book by the indefatigable Rector.</p>

<p>"I ever thought it my duty," he declared, "to prevent those
persons who were obnoxious to it [the Church]...unless the criminal
was so sturdy and so wealthy, as that I was morally certain I could
not do it without my own inconvenience or ruin, in which case God
does not require it of me."</p>

<p>This seems like an admission of the superior power of Satan,
since God did not even expect a tussle with infernal powers if they
were backed by wealth, but it left the Rector with a number of
lesser victims on whom to vent his punishments, and not
infrequently the gaping congregation would see some backslider
publicly refused the Lord's cup, or&mdash;an even more zestful
spectacle&mdash;standing barefoot on the mud floor of the church,
pinched with cold and shame, wrapped in a white sheet, for three
successive Sundays. No one felt more gratified by these displays of
penitence than Mrs. Wesley, whose absorption in the problem of
salvation had become more acute as her span on earth shortened. For
herself she dared now to hope that she was saved; addressing
herself she argued thus: "If He had been willing that you should
perish. He might have let you perish without the expense of so many
miracles to save you. Why did He give you birth in a Christian
country, of religious parents, by whom you were early instructed in
the principles of religion?"</p>

<p>There was comfort in this reflection, but when Mrs. Wesley
recalled those two dreadful years before her marriage, when she had
been tempted by the heresy of Socinianism, she trembled again.
Would God ever forgive her for considering for twenty-four months
the doctrines of Faustus Socinus, who had denied the existence of
the Holy Trinity, taught that Jesus Christ was a divine teacher
only, and that the Bible was to be interpreted by the light of
reason? Mrs. Wesley had long weaned herself from any desire for
what the world calls pleasure, though she was distressed to find
that she did not yearn for death with the fervency proper to a
Christian, for she could not stifle her affection for her children,
though she sternly discouraged any enthusiastic expression of
regard, even from her favourite John. Socinianism might be cast out
of her religious life, but it was by the rules of reason that she
governed her worldly affairs&mdash;reason by which she endeavoured
to guide and control her emotions.</p>

<p>So the years came and went in Axholme with little to mark them
but the changes of the seasons; the crucified trees on the
red-brick "fronts" of the Rectory were whitened by blossom,
enriched by fruit; the Rector tended his plums and mulberries, his
apples and cherries, pleased with the agreeable labour, vexed at
the lack of profit the quarterly accounts showed; the meadows
ripened for the scythe, the pastures were green and lush where the
cattle grazed, and the saddle horses were put out to grass; in the
dairy the maids worked with pail and churn; in the hall the
servants sat, between harder labours, at spinning-wheel and
weaving-frame; in the parlour the girls wrote verses, sang, read,
sewed, and discussed their modest fortunes. Their graceful figures
in full skirts, tight bodices, with fine muslin kerchiefs knotted
over slender bosoms gave touches of brilliancy to the dark, sombre
house; their eager faces, bright beneath the glossy ringlets and
prim caps, were like glimpses of earthly pleasure and hope in this
atmosphere heavy with dull resignation, and anxious striving for a
Heaven neither properly understood nor clearly visualized.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>
OXFORD.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE old University city was a stately and pleasant place when
John Wesley was entered at Christ Church, and even he, who had no
aesthetic sense, who was insensitive to beauty and ugliness, who
required nothing save order and neatness to satisfy him in his
surroundings, was agreeably impressed by the rich, elegant
buildings of mellow-coloured stone, and their enclosed secluded
quadrangles and flowery gardens, their spires and towers that rose
impressively from the lush riverside meadows. These shady walks by
cloister or Thames-side, these halls, chapels, and rooms, venerable
and admirable by association and dignified by painting, sculpture,
carving, and coloured glass, seemed suitable indeed for laborious,
earnest study, tranquil contemplation, and polished academic
discussion.</p>

<p>In truth, however, the great University, as John Wesley soon
discovered, was in a miserable condition, and those who left its
colleges as learned, cultured, or able men were reaping the reward
of their own labours, not the merits of the University system or
the efforts of their tutors. It might with justice be said that
during the greater part of the eighteenth century the lax
discipline, the ignorance, laziness, and venality of professors and
tutors, and a debased standard of public morals had reduced the
University, founded for the encouragement of learning and culture,
to a forcing-house for vice, folly, and extravagance, where the
sons of the wealthy paid for leave to stay away from lectures that
the tutors never delivered, bought their degrees, and laughed at
work, and where the sons of the poor, like the Rector of Epworth,
polished boots and swept floors in return for what education their
industry could wrest from teachers idle, cynical, and
dissipated.</p>

<p>The University was, however, exceedingly rich in what was then
termed "the mechanical apparatus of learning"&mdash;that is to say,
there were fine libraries, well-endowed professorships, handsome
scholarships, and many generous prizes, and it was possible for one
endowed with an iron will, a constitution impervious to hardship,
and a mind and heart fortified against an enervating atmosphere,
sensual temptation, and the jeers of fools, to obtain what the
period considered a brilliant education.</p>

<p>Such people are rare in any time and in any place, and John
Wesley, looking about him when he first took up residence in the
beautiful College, found himself surrounded by idlers and ignorant
wastrels, such people as his parents had always taught him
represented those that garrisoned the outposts of Hell. The young
man felt a conscious superiority that intensified his natural
arrogance; it was hardly possible for him to feel humble in the
company of people so lost that they did not even know that they
were in danger of damnation.</p>

<p>That, indeed, John Wesley soon perceived, was the fatal lethargy
from which England was suffering; the country did not know that it
was in pitiful peril of Hell fire.</p>

<p>Even an observer more impartial than the young man from Epworth
Rectory would have found the age degenerate, lawless, lukewarm,
without spirituality or enthusiasm, corrupt, and cynic. The nominal
Christianity of the Church of England was vague, disheartened, and
careless; at Oxford the Thirty-nine Articles were subscribed to by
each student at his matriculation, but no one was expected to read
the document that he had signed, and this was typical of the
attitude of the Church as a whole; as long as the forms were
allowed, the substance might be ignored. Christian ethics were
outwardly accepted and privately defied; morality in State and
family alike was at a low ebb, and crude, cruel, and disgusting
vices disfigured every aspect of life. Deism, so much dreaded by
earnest Christians, was popular and served often as a mask for
Atheism or vague, comfortable disbelief, not only in revealed
religion, but in a personal God.</p>

<p>Most people, either out of apathy or out of fear, acquiesced in
the Church of England, but few gave the institution more than lip
service; a brutal intolerance was shown towards Roman Catholics; a
lukewarm friendship to the Dissenters, whose services in 1688 could
scarcely be overlooked, and in whose thin and sombre ranks nearly
all the sincere religious feeling of the country lay. But though
there might be the strength of conviction and much loyalty to
ideals of orderly conduct and what can only be termed
"respectability" among the Puritans of various denominations, they
were too narrow, too joyless, too absorbed in money-making and
censorious watchfulness over one another to contribute to a rich
spiritual national life.</p>

<p>The fundamental vice of the country was corruption; the
extensive and skilful use of bribery had long before this period
made the much-vaunted Constitution of England, her laws, and the
liberties of Englishmen, a mere formula. The power exercised by
birth, position, money, was enormous; to be born a "lord" was to be
born to a position with only a few vague responsibilities and
limitless opportunities of self-indulgence and aggrandizement; to
be born outside the privileged classes was to be born to an
existence of poverty, struggle, neglect, and frustration. The
social services were scanty, badly administered; corruption ruled
the little official as completely as it ruled the big official,
and, worst of all, ignorance joined carelessness in a veritable
dance of death. All the diseases due to filth, debauchery, and
drink were endemic; lack of sanitation, indifference to personal
cleanliness, absence of knowledge of the danger of dirty food, of
contagion or infection, gross self-indulgence, caused an
appallingly high rate of mortality and produced maladies that
darkened the lives of the majority of the population. The story of
the eighteenth century in England is a story of disease; few indeed
were those who escaped some searing affliction of nerves, body, or
brain, and the gloom induced by a loosely held religion, vague and
cheerless, was intensified by constant physical suffering. The
worst aspect of the age showed in the unspeakable condition of the
prisons, in the treatment of the poor and infirm, in the hideous
severity of the punishments meted out to criminals, in "pressing"
and "crimping," in the treatment of soldiers and sailors, of
children and animals&mdash;in brief, in injustice, brutality, and
greed. The best aspect of the age showed in the efforts, feeble and
spasmodic but sincere, of the minority to mitigate these horrors,
and in the widening trickle of the humanitarian movement that had
begun under William and Mary and been warmly fostered by the
latter. The peasantry were in a state of ignorance and poverty; the
unparalleled beauty of the English landscape was heightened by the
cosy prettiness of farm, cottage, and hovel, but these were
insanitary, inconvenient, and often in disrepair; farming was
backward. But what hampered progress more than anything else was
the extreme difficulty of transport. There were no canals, and the
roads were of the most primitive description; old Roman highways
mended by the casting down of unbroken stone, or winding
cart-tracks divided by deep ruts; poor and sparse inns, robbers,
and the danger of being lost or stranded in some wild place, made
all travel dangerous and in some parts of the country impossible.
There was no properly organized public travel service; the brief
reign of the stage coach had not begun; those who had not their own
carriages or horses had to use the rude carriers' waggons that
jolted from town to town, conveying passengers as well as
merchandise. Badly administered laws that should have been admitted
to be obsolete (the severity of the penalty for crimes causing a
corresponding laxity in their execution) resulted in the country's
being practically unpoliced and therefore either in the hands of
those wealthy or socially powerful enough to enforce their own way,
or in the hands of those wretched, desperate, and bold enough to
defy the law. The noble and the criminal, the duke and the footpad:
these, in their different spheres, enjoyed the greatest measure of
freedom; in the lordly mansion enclosed in the sumptuous park, in
the thieves' kitchen hidden in the impenetrable city slum, men and
women lived according to their own desires.</p>

<p>The classes in between these extremes, tyrannized by one and
terrorized by the other, lived as best they could, paying lip
service to the State that could not protect them and bowing the
knee in the Church that offered no spiritual food, while the innate
good qualities of the race were working, often unconsciously,
towards finer ideals than these and better social conditions in
which to exploit them.</p>

<p>Such was, in rough outline, the world on which John Wesley
looked out from Epworth Rectory, from Charterhouse, from Oxford
University. It is impossible to understand John Wesley and what he
did unless his background is known and understood, since even the
greatest of men must be in some degree a product of his times. The
earliest of his many remarkable qualities to develop was his
courage; this was of the temper that may truly be termed dauntless;
it brought with it the serenity associated with fatalism; the young
man rightly felt that everything was possible to one who was never
afraid.</p>

<p>At home he had held his own against his formidable father and
his lively brothers and sisters, and had identified himself with
his stern mother, not from fear but from respect and admiration; at
school he had not abated a jot his principles or his pretensions,
he had calmly faced the brutality of the elder boys and established
a leadership among the younger ones; now, at Oxford, he pitted
himself against the whole corrupt, decaying institution, was not
shifted by a hair's breadth from the convictions that he had held
during his infancy nor from his determination to rise high above
this crowd of dissolute idlers with their wenches, their gambling,
their cock-fighting, swearing, and drinking.</p>

<p>As he had no money, he had to work, and this suited his
disposition; he become an excellent classic scholar, studying
Hebrew as well as Greek and Latin, according to the standards of
his day; he possessed many of the qualities useful for any kind of
success&mdash;industry, the power of concentration, joy in mental
exercise for its own sake, self-confidence, and a cool
imperviousness to the temptations of idleness, pleasure, or
vice.</p>

<p>He was a careful manager of his small means, but even so was
often in financial embarrassments bravely borne; he spent his
holidays at Epworth, with occasional visits to Samuel at
Westminster or to Emilia at Lincoln, and he kept in touch with the
various members of his family by means of a frequent and lengthy
correspondence.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was intensely curious about and interested in the
supernatural; "old Jeffrey" had convinced him for ever of the
existence of an invisible world, and he looked out eagerly for
other evidences of the strange dealings of God and Satan with
mankind; this trait has been termed "a wonder-loving credulity,"
but how is credulity to be distinguished from faith? Wesley had
either to doubt like the sinners or to believe like the saints, and
to one brought up in the Epworth tradition of Christianity all
things must be possible.</p>

<p>John Wesley was possessed of a fine brain, a strong common
sense, a lively intelligence, and his fascinated probings into the
supernatural were really prompted rather by efforts to convince
himself, against himself, of the reality of the miracles inherent
in Christianity, than by any pleasure in fantasy; this indeed was
far from his practical, unimaginative nature.</p>

<p>Several little incidents came to support the authenticity of
"old Jeffrey"; John Wesley, walking along the Oxfordshire roads,
saw a deserted house with a neglected garden; he was told that it
was haunted by ghosts, and at once he planned to spend the night
there in order to test the truth of this assertion. He was also
much impressed by the tale that he had heard of a boy in Ireland
who had a habit of flying through the clouds and supping with
"demigods" in the heavens. Into what portion of Wesley's rigid
theology did these deities fit? Another matter came nearer home;
three Christ Church men, wandering in the river fields, had seen "a
ghost"&mdash;of what appearance or nature we are not told, and it
was afterwards known that the mother of one of the students, a Mr.
Barnesley, had died in Ireland at the exact moment that her son and
his friends had glimpsed the apparition.</p>

<p>John put these strange cases before his mother; Susanna Wesley
still unconsciously retained a good deal of her dangerous
Socinianism; though growing daily in faith as far as it meant
belief in her chosen God, these senseless spectres irritated her
common sense, and in her reply to "dear Jacky" she sifted the
mystery through the sieve of reason, and found it reduced to
rubbish.</p>

<p>"I do not doubt the fact," she wrote (this was probably not
true), "but I cannot understand why these apparitions are
permitted. If they were allowed to speak to us, and we had strength
to bear such converse&mdash;if they had commission to inform us of
anything relating to their invisible world that would be of any use
to us in this&mdash;if they would instruct us how to avoid danger,
or put us in a way of being wiser and better, there would be sense
in it; but to appear for no end that we know of, unless to frighten
people almost out of their wits, seems altogether
unreasonable."</p>

<p>Her acid comments left John where he was; he had to continue in
blind belief in all the ghosts, goblins, and imps of Christendom,
for to reject the least of them was to reject the God who permitted
their vagaries.</p>

<p>His immediate goal soon became Ordination with a living obtained
through the influence of his father's friends or through his old
school; to this end he read "good books," wrote theses, and studied
dead languages; he was a cheerful companion, much liked for his
even temper and air of breeding; neat and exquisitely clean in his
person, he could never have been taken for anything but a
gentleman; his features never lost their infantile delicacy; they
were precisely shaped and freshly coloured; to save the expenses of
a barber and a peruke he wore his own hair long; it was of an
auburn-brown colour, parted in the middle, smoothly brushed and
curling at the ends; nor was John insensible to the charm and
distinction that these profuse bright locks gave him among so many
wigs and floured heads. His dark habits were always well-brushed
and well-fitting; his plain linen spotless, his nicely-kept hands
had a feminine grace and slightness; his expression was cheerful,
even gay, though his constant smile had a fixity that savoured of
hypocrisy and that was contradicted by his eyes, singularly bright,
of that quality known as "piercing," because they seemed to give
out rays to dart into those they looked at. He was short, of no
more inches than the little Rector of Epworth, but he dominated
every company he was in, and his good proportions prevented him
from appearing dwarfish.</p>

<p>His uncultivated gift for music found vent in a spontaneous
singing; not only at the set times, in chapel and church, at
festival and in choir, but in his rooms, during his walks and his
meditations John Wesley sang the hymns and psalms of the Church of
England that he had learned in Epworth Rectory. He wrote verses,
too, more than mere exercises; some a translation from the Latin
about Chloe's favourite flea, some original couplets, some
hymns.</p>

<p>His diet was spare, he neither drank nor smoked, and his health
remained, for that period, exceptionally good; but he was troubled
with bleeding from the nose and mouth that sometimes "almost
choked" him; one such attack was cured only by his throwing off his
clothes and leaping into the river; he thought, evidently
mistakenly, that he was threatened with "consumption"; the trouble
was probably not tubercular but due to congestion and catarrh.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley blamed the long locks for these bleedings, and urged
Jacky to crop them and buy a wig, but the young student, who, as he
said to his sister, "could scarce afford the postage for his
letters home," could not undertake the expense. Much to his
distaste and in spite of the low fees that his tutor, Mr. Sherman,
accepted, John was sometimes forced to borrow money, and his mother
wrote in concern about the "good, generous man that lent you ten
pounds," and of whom she was forced to beg a further period of
grace.</p>

<p>Mr. Annesley had not arrived from India, but his sister had been
"amused" by tales of his possible return; she could not help
thinking longingly of this rich brother who might yet be the means
of her being able to provide for her children. Without this hope
the worldly prospect seemed dark; "a few crumbs" were to be
garnered out of Epworth for the scholar at Christ Church, and the
anxious harassed mother could only urge Jacky: "I only wish you
were in Orders and could come and serve as one of your father's
curates. Then I should see you often and be more useful to you than
it is possible to be at a distance."</p>

<p>But her warmest consolation could stretch no farther than: "Dear
Jack, be not discouraged; do your duty; keep close to your studies
and hope for better days."</p>

<p>When John had been two years at Oxford, his father also
"pressed" him to take Holy Orders, though he reminded him that it
must not be "to eat a piece of bread, but for the glory of God and
the good of men."</p>

<p>The "piece of bread" was there in the shape of any of the
livings at the disposal of the Governors of Charterhouse, one of
his father's curacies, or Wroote, the second Wesley living, "the
hovel" on the flats. Nor did there seem to be any other worldly
prospect before the young man, unless he, like his brother Samuel,
were to take up teaching.</p>

<p>John was, however, convinced, on other than worldly grounds, of
the expediency of entering the Church. He chanced to read <i>The
Christian Pattern</i> by Thomas  Kempis and <i>Holy Living and
Dying</i> by Jeremy Taylor, and was deeply impressed; though his
life had always been exemplary, he now began to think of himself as
a sinner, lost in sensual indulgences, and to experience a fervent
desire for what he considered true holiness; the emotionalism of
his developing manhood had to find some vent.</p>

<p>His letters home had hitherto been filled with such matters as
the surprising escape of Jack Sheppard from Newgate, the frosty
weather, the cheapness of apples, the theft of a cap and wig
snatched from the head of an acquaintance, a cut thumb, papers of
his own verses, and commentaries on such books as De Cheyne's
<i>Book of Health and Long Life;</i> now they posed religious
questions and asked the opinions of his parents on his proposed
entry into the ministry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley was pleased but not enthusiastic; she wished her
son, she wrote, to examine himself seriously, whether he felt he
had "a reasonable hope of salvation." If Jacky felt that he was in
a proper state of faith and repentance, well and good; "if not, you
will find a more reasonable occasion for tears than can be met with
in a tragedy." A tragedy such a state of mind would be indeed, for
it would mean that John, who had never done a wrong action and had
scarcely had a wrong thought in his life, would feel certain of
eternal damnation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley added tartly: "it is an unhappiness almost peculiar
to our family that your father and I seldom think alike," and in
this case the Rev. Samuel was inclined to urge John to "critical
studies" in preference to striving to discover if or no his soul
was saved.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the money for John's ordination fees was hard to come
by. Mrs. Wesley had read in the <i>Gazette</i> that her brother was
due to arrive from India in a certain ship, by a certain date, and
she took the desperate step of coming to London to meet him. Mr.
Annesley was not, however, in the ship, and Mrs. Wesley had no
other satisfaction from her tedious journey than a sight of Samuel,
then laid up with a broken leg. Despite this disappointment and
debts to the amount of three hundred and fifty pounds, the Rector
of Epworth grimly resolved to scrape together the amount necessary
to pay John's fees. He urged the candidate, still fascinated by a
Kempis and Jeremy Taylor, to read Saint Chrysostom and a manuscript
of his own entitled <i>Letter to a Curate,</i> while he tried to
interest the Bishop of Lincoln in the young student.</p>

<p>For her part Mrs. Wesley sent John <i>a</i> coolly-reasoned
letter on repentance, by which she seemed to mean regeneration, and
stated she faced "a heavy financial reckoning for you and
Charles."</p>

<p>The family fortunes were now at a low ebb; Emilia during a visit
to London had fallen passionately in love with a certain Mr.
Leybourne, who became a dear friend and companion to the handsome
intelligent woman. She declared that "his love was sufficient
recompense for the loss or absence of all other worldly comforts."
Neither Mrs. Wesley nor the younger Samuel approved, however, of
the proposed match, and interfered "to break the correspondence,"
to the bitter heartache of Emilia. Added to this trouble was the
increasing misery of Sukey's marriage and the wilfulness of Hetty,
fast passing, in her parents' opinion, maidenly discretion and
decency. Anne had left home to marry John Lambert, a local
land-surveyor, a dull fellow given to intemperance and no proper
match for a daughter of the Wesleys.</p>

<p>Over all these people, over the wretched marriages, the thwarted
love affair, the invalids, and the frustrated women, over the
toiling mother and the three industrious sons, hung the unrelenting
threat of poverty; all were inclined to blame the father for
ill-management: he could not make the farm pay, his absorption in
the Book of Job preventing him from earning any money with his pen,
and he seemed to be ever deeper and deeper in debt, for no good
reason.</p>

<p>In September, 1725, John Wesley took Holy Orders. His state of
mind at this period is not clear to us and perhaps was not to
himself; he had undertaken serious self-examination; he had kept a
book in which he noted how he spent his time; he lived so piously
as to be jeered at by "gentlemen candidates," whereby his father
was provoked to exclaim: "Does anyone think that the devil is dead
or asleep or that he has no agents left?" and he had argued with
his mother about predestination, in which he could not
believe&mdash;all on the surface at least was piously orthodox and,
if the level-headed young man who never did anything without a
reason entered the Church with secret, perhaps unconscious, hopes
of gratifying, not only ambition but arrogance, no one could know
as much.</p>

<p>The prelate who ordained John Wesley was John Potter, then
Bishop of Oxford, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. He had been
secretary to Archbishop Tenison and Regius Professor of Divinity at
Oxford; a self-made man, a skilful theologian, and a fine classical
scholar, he showed a kindly interest in the young candidate whose
subsequent achievements were to be his own most tenable claim to
remembrance.</p>

<p>A few months later (March, 1726) John Wesley was elected Fellow
of Lincoln, that "little college of theologians" founded by Richard
Fleming, Bishop of Lincoln, in 1427. The Fellows, who were bound to
be in Holy Orders, were obliged to take an oath against heresy, for
Fleming had been suspected of Lollardry and wished to efface this
taint. "Whatever I am, my Jack is Fellow of Lincoln," rejoiced the
stout old Rector of Epworth, who had but five pounds to keep his
family on until harvest time, but who now felt well repaid for the
effort it had cost to send his son to Oxford University.</p>

<p>John Wesley was thus relieved from the worst pinch of squalid
poverty; his Fellowship carried with it rooms and a salary, and he
soon obtained the appointments of Greek Lecturer and Moderator of
the Classes. The latter position meant that he took the chair at
the daily debates that were a prominent feature of the academic
life in Bishop Fleming's College, where logic was developed into a
whip for the Devil. John Wesley's ambition was also gratified; his
industry had been rewarded, his gifts recognized; he began to have
a shining reputation in Oxford; with zest he set himself to fulfil
his new duties. Greek and Latin on the first two days of the week,
Logic and Ethics on Wednesdays, Hebrew and Arabic next, Metaphysics
and Natural Philosophy on Fridays, Oratory and Poetry on Saturdays,
Divinity on Sundays: a triumph of method as inculcated by Susanna
Wesley.</p>

<p>In the same orderly fashion he set himself to continue the
struggle for salvation; he carefully followed out the rules of the
Church, lived according to rote, and even carried his priggishness
to such a pitch that he avoided the acquaintance of all not likely
to help him on his "way to Heaven." But his natural pleasantness of
disposition and his easy courtesy made him liked, if not popular,
and he could not fail to be respected.</p>

<p>John Wesley's worldly position might then be considered
fortunate and very suitable to his character and attainments, and
there seemed no reason why he should not remain for the rest of his
days a prudish smug Don, with a mind as narrow as the path he was
so daintily pursuing to eternal bliss.</p>

<p>He was now pledged not only to believe in but to teach the
doctrines of and to uphold the Church of England. His mother's
strong views on this subject were shown in her letter to Samuel,
the son she had dedicated to God. She thought that to be a
clergyman required an almost impossible standard of
conduct&mdash;"what separation from the world, what purity, what
devotion, what exemplary virtue are required in those who are to
guide others to glory! I say <i>exemplary,</i> for low, common
degrees of piety are not sufficient for those of the sacred
function."</p>

<p>The anxious mother could scarcely have supposed that Jacky was
showing more than "low, common degrees of piety" by living
comfortably in Lincoln College, engaged in those "critical studies"
that she thought so lightly of. She considered that he should be in
active control of a flock of sinners, and for this and some more
worldly reasons she urged John to leave the cloistered ease of
Oxford for Axholme, where he might struggle to save the souls of
the unregenerate Fen men, of whom Hetty Wesley wrote:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
High birth and virtue equally they scorn<br>
As asses dull, on dunghills born.</p>

<br>

<p>The Rector of Epworth also urged his son to come and undertake
the Wroote curacy, and there John Wesley repaired in August,
1727, and took up "residence in the thatched-roofed parsonage
amid the swamps where 'pigs and porkets,' 'kittens and whelps,'
'quacking ducks and fluttering hens' made a lively din about the
sodden glebe land. For some months of the year Wroote was
accessible only by boat; the parishioners numbered two hundred,
their heads being 'as impervious as stones' and their hearts
little better." It was no wonder, then, that Wesley afterwards
admitted of his Wroote curacy: "I preached much, but saw no fruit
of my labour."</p>

<p>During his residence at Wroote John wrote to Samuel an account
of the various members of the family still at home, and the elder
brother found these not to need "further explanation." But
tragedies were taking place under the eyes of the prim young
curate, and some of them were due to his meddling. Emilia had again
gone to Lincoln as a schoolmistress and was thinking of investing
her savings in a little school in Gainsborough; she was past
thirty-five years of age, handsome and vivacious, and had fallen
deeply in love with a doctor of medicine&mdash;"an excellent
physician, a companion, and a friend to whom I could speak freely
at all times the most passionate lover," as she lamented. But this
suitor was a Quaker, and therefore repugnant to the Wesleys; John,
in particular, urged his sister "as a strict duty" to part with
"this faithful friend, this delightful companion," and Emilia
looked upon John with "the tenderest regard" and would never
"wilfully disobey or grieve him "; so her dilemma was cruel, and
the unfortunate woman saw her life's happiness sacrificed to a
cruel intolerance and a spiteful fanaticism that she was misled
into thinking was the Divine will. She resigned herself to her
dreadful God&mdash;"my Creator seems to have decreed me to a life
of suffering here, and always deprives me of what I love, or
embitters it to me. Who can contend with omnipotence?"</p>

<p>But what mattered his sister's broken heart to John Wesley? He
felt that he had helped his own salvation by preventing a Quaker
from entering the family, and continued to live by the rules that
he had written in the front of the book in which he kept his
Journal.</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">

<br>

<p>As yet no severe temptation had come his way; even the dull life
at Wroote was not disagreeable to one absorbed in self-improvement.
John Wesley had gained much applause with the three set pieces that
he had delivered when he received his Master of Arts degree
(February, 1727), <i>De Anima Brutorum, De Julio Caesare, De Amore
Dei,</i> and it was with an eye to future academic distinction that
the diligent young man sat over his books under the rotting thatch
of the parsonage, a mud floor beneath his feet, and bogs beyond the
farmyard without his window. His calm self-absorption not touched
by Emilia's sorrow was, however, a little ruffled by the more
poignant tragedy of the brilliant Hetty.</p>

<p>This is obscure, and so hushed up and evaded even by the family
itself that it is difficult to know the details of what was a
hideous disaster in the opinion of the Wesleys&mdash;the
backsliding of the one, as the mother put it, that outweighed the
virtues of the other living children, more bitter than the loss of
the nine dead children. The lovely, graceful Hetty was now past her
first youth, and her beauty, charm, gifts, and learning had not
enabled her to leave the parsonage, where she drudged alike for
mother and father, for more than an occasional visit to London to
Uncle Matthew Wesley, who was very fond of her. She had had several
suitors, but these being of the "airy and thoughtless class," were
sternly dismissed by the parents. Soon after John came to Wroote,
however, Hetty was sought after by a young gentleman of the
neighbourhood who seemed a brilliant match for the portionless
young woman. The Rector, however, quarrelled with him on the score
of his supposed ungodliness and forbade him the Rectory; but Hetty,
in love, frustrated for years in all natural desires, escaped from
the house and eloped with her lover. Tragedy quickly overtook her.
Whether the man refused to marry her, or she realized the enormity
of her offence and left him in horror; whether he seduced her or
attempted to do so, or they quarrelled on some point of pride or
delicacy, certain it is that the miserable woman, formerly so gay
and wilful, crept home humbled and broken, was received like an
outcast, reproached as a lost soul, and regarded as dishonoured and
utterly degraded. The most pitiful part of her tragedy was that she
acquiesced in the condemnation and accepted the imposition of a
lifelong penance for her fault&mdash;in "expiation of her sin," as
she allowed it to be called.</p>

<p>This, the Rector decreed, should be marriage with the first
"honest" man who asked for her soiled person and tainted
affections; Hetty vowed to obey, and a suitable candidate appeared
in the person of an uneducated artisan, one Wright, who was a
worker in white lead&mdash;plumber&mdash;a journeyman who travelled
from place to place mending pipes and metal-work; in other words, a
travelling tinker.</p>

<p>To this husband the fair, sensitive, and gifted Hetty was given
in (probably) 1729; John disapproved of the grotesque match,
thought his father was harsh, and said so, even hinting at paternal
severity in a sermon he preached at Wroote; but he could not save
his sister, whose bitter lot was only slightly sweetened by her
Uncle Matthew's giving her five hundred pounds as a marriage
portion.</p>

<p>The husband took this as a matter of course, and decided to
purchase a business of his own in London; so Hetty, dimmed and
stricken, left the parsonage to take her place beside the rude mate
chosen for her as "expiation for her sin" in the rude waggon
jolting to the capital.</p>

<p>Samuel the younger was Head Usher of Westminster School, and
thus was able to visit the Wrights when they set up business in
Frith Street, Soho; Charles, after being Captain at Westminster,
had entered Christ Church, Oxford, where he was doing brilliantly;
Sukey's marriage continued in a state of wretchedness; Emilia, torn
between love and duty, opened her little school at Gainsborough;
and at home in the parsonage, now too large for the smaller family,
were the old parents and the unmarried daughters, invalid Mary,
nearly thirty-five years old, Martha, a year younger than John, and
Kezzy, a sickly girl of nineteen years.</p>

<p>Over this diminished flock the aged mother still sternly
presided. She was, as she had said of herself in the year of John's
ordination, "infirm, slow of understanding, full of unpleasant
business," besides being embittered by Hetty's dreadful sin; but
she continued to wrestle with God for the souls of her children in
the desperate hope that even the lost one, if she suffered enough
on earth, might at last be admitted into Heaven.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>
VARANESE AND ASPASIA.</h2>

<p class="first">
IN October, 1729, Dr. John Morley, the Rector of Lincoln
College, wrote to John Wesley, desiring him to return to Oxford to
fulfil his duties as Fellow and Moderator, as was required by the
Statutes. Dr. Morley had been a useful friend to the Wesleys and,
besides the dislike of disobliging him, there was the fear of
losing the valuable Fellowship, so John, by no means reluctantly,
left the blockish congregation on whom his scholarly sermons had
had no effect, mounted his neat nag, and rode back to Oxford, where
his fellow-dons gave him a courteous welcome, and where he was
stimulated by reading the Vice-Chancellor's edict, posted in the
college halls. This was against the Deists and urged all professors
and tutors to keep their pupils in the way of orthodoxy.</p>

<p>John Wesley was in Oxford for another five years. During that
time his fortunes were static; he remained a prim High Church
parson, remarkable only for his association with the religious
movement started by his brother Charles and some
fellow-enthusiasts, and interested only in the preservation of his
own soul and the vicissitudes of the Epworth establishment. These
remained uncertain; many hopes were centred in "Job" at which the
Rector still toiled; influential friends continued to solicit
subscribers for this monumental work; the Rector of Epworth was
described to Dean Swift by Lord Oxford as "a man in years, yet
hearty and able to study many hours a day; in short this is the
labour of an honest, poor, worthy clergyman, and I hope that you
will take him under your protection."</p>

<p>In 1731 the wealthy brother Matthew visited Epworth, and was
shocked at the evidence of stark poverty&mdash;after all his
generous help, too! The visit of the London doctor caused a great
stir at Epworth&mdash;"all the town," wrote Mrs. Wesley, "took the
alarm and were on the gaze, as if some great prince had been about
to make an entry."</p>

<p>The Nonconformist Dr. Wesley was quiet and reserved, though
amiable and courteous, "behaved himself very decently at family
prayers," and, when the Rector was absent, said grace before and
after meat.</p>

<p>When the rich brother left he took Martha with him to stay in
London; he had been very fond of and kind to all the girls; he
loved Hetty and was grieved at her wretched marriage. When he
returned home he addressed a stern letter to his brother, whom he
reminded of "a plentiful estate" and "great and generous
benefactions," adding that he thought it "a black account" that
Samuel had not provided for his unhappy family better; in short, he
thought the poverty of Epworth a disgrace "which shocks me to think
of." He had also evidently been exasperated by Samuel's and piety,
for he added sharply: "I must advise you to be frequent in your
perusal of Father Beveridge on Repentance and Doctor Tillotson on
Restitution, for it is not saying, 'Lord! Lord!' that will bring us
to the Kingdom of Heaven, but doing justice to all our
fellow-creatures." Thus the Nonconformist to the High Churchman;
Samuel was not impressed though doubtless stung by receiving some
of the admonitions he gave out so liberally to others; he still
quoted his large family, his two fires and his initial debts as
excuses for his poverty, but his wife tartly agreed with her
brother about the Rector's mismanagement of his affairs.</p>

<p>These became worse; unhappiness hung more darkly over all the
Wesleys; Sukey left her husband, who lost all his land in the
floods that drowned all his cows and horses "save one." Hetty's
boorish husband drank away all her marriage portion and taught his
own vices to his brother-in-law Lambert, who had moved to London,
and Kezzy had to leave the school at Lincoln, because she had not a
sufficiency of decent clothes. Mary, at thirty-seven years of age,
married John Whitelambe, who had taken Holy Orders; this was the
one happy marriage of the Wesley sisters. Whitelambe was penniless;
John and Charles had to make up between them the thirty shillings
that was the price of his clerical gown, but his father-in-law
requested the Lord Chancellor to transfer Wroote to him, and there
he took his wife in tender joy and deep affection. "They love the
place, though I can get no one else to reside at it," wrote the
Rev. Samuel, and to these two meek, simple people the little
thatched house amid the swamps was home indeed; they felt
themselves very near Heaven on the Lincolnshire fens that they
glorified with mutual love and modest hopes.</p>

<p>Within a year Mary was dead in childbirth, and John Whitelambe,
almost frantic with grief, followed the coffin of his wife and
child into the little brick church; John hurried to Wroote to
preach the funeral sermon; poor Hetty, who had lost her own infant
through lead poisoning, wrote an epitaph, and Samuel an elegy on
the lost sister.</p>

<p>Martha's story promised to be the happier; Charles visited her
when she was staying with her Uncle Matthew, and brought with him a
brilliant young man who was one of his own students, Westley Hall,
who was of seductive manner, handsome, of unexceptional character
and good prospects. He paid secret court to Patty, entering into an
engagement to marry her without letting her brothers know of it,
his excuse for this lack of candour being his youth and state of
pupilage; he was well off and appeared orthodox in his beliefs (he
was studying for Holy Orders), so Patty felt that she might count
on a stable, serene life. When John and Charles visited Epworth in
the summer they took Westley Hall with them; he saw the delicate
and pining Keziah and immediately offered his hand, a proposal that
her brothers urged on her acceptance.</p>

<p>Keziah was indifferent even to the charms of the lively young
man; she was too deeply sunk in melancholy to be easily roused; she
thought her suitor "worthy of love" but could not draw her mind
from contemplation of death; she wished to disengage herself from
the world and thought "the single state the most excellent way."
However, the advice of her relations prevailed, and Kezzy accepted
Mr. Hall, and even allowed her gentle and timid affections to
centre on him, only for him to return to London, renew his
engagement to Martha, whom he soon married.</p>

<p>This cruel desertion finally turned Keziah's mind towards
Heaven, and accepting the wrong with fortitude, she forgave Westley
Hall and set herself to await an early death.</p>

<p>Martha's husband obtained a cure at Wootton, and for a while
this marriage seemed to be at least not as tragic as those of Hetty
and Sukey, but the deception of Keziah darkened Martha's life, even
though the meek woman came to stay with her sister in token of full
forgiveness and Hall glossed over his conduct by declaring it had
been the result of a revelation of the Divine Will, an argument
that the Wesleys were chary of refuting.</p>

<p>John Wesley had had his full share in all these turns of fortune
that concerned him deeply, for he was very fond of his family; he
was also anxious about his brother Charles, who had, on first
coming to Oxford, shown himself spritely and lively, even tainted
with worldliness, and who when rebuked for his levity exclaimed:
"What, would you have me a saint all at once!" Samuel was now
married, interested in his own home and had accepted a mastership
at Blundell's School, Tiverton, so that the responsibility for
Charles fell solely on John, who regarded his younger brother with
grave uneasiness.</p>

<p>Charles was a far more attractive personality than John; short,
thick-set, with weak eyes and a poor constitution, he possessed a
rich, warm, affectionate nature, the lovely gifts of poetry and
music, a generous vivacity, a lively enthusiasm that graced all he
undertook; though allured for a while by the pleasures natural to
his youth, early training soon asserted itself and Charles
seriously turned his mind to the subject&mdash;religion&mdash;that
was an obsession with his family. Far more original and gifted than
John, he at once began to create something definite of the faith
that the elder brother was content to leave a matter of orthodox
keeping of rule.</p>

<p>Like all people of genius, Charles had followers, and he found
no difficulty in moulding these weaker characters; when John
returned from one of his Lincolnshire visits, he found that Charles
had formed a "Holy Club" or little band, consisting of himself, a
sickly youth named William Morgan, and Robert Kirkham, long a
friend of John's, who much admired his sister Betty.</p>

<p>John approved of the little community and at once assumed the
leadership of it, while adding to its ranks several of his own
divinity students. He had lately been deeply impressed by
<i>Christian Perfection</i> and <i>Serious Call,</i> by William
Law, the elder Edward Gibbon's tutor, a curate who had left the
Church on refusing to take the oath to George I, and whose books
had impressed a wide public. While attending to the painful affairs
of his family, John had pondered much over these two books, with
the result that he determined "to be all devoted to God, to give
Him all my soul, my body, and my substance."</p>

<p>It seemed that all John's yearnings after holiness, salvation,
authority, and leadership were to be fused in the organization of
this Holy Club, which Charles, who greatly loved and admired him,
willingly put into his hands.</p>

<p>Here was a chance to put into practice that love of method which
he had inherited from his mother and which-he had seen her so
firmly practise; he had, too, already experienced the thrill of
meddling with souls. At the funeral of a young woman he had met a
friend to whom he had spoken so forcibly of death and damnation
that the other declared himself "converted," a state that endured
until his death of consumption, a fortnight later, and the prospect
of renewing this experience was tempting to the young don. At first
the Holy Club met to read the Greek Testament together, then they
began to discuss what the actions of the day had been, to pray and
sup together, to draw up rules; it was the strict observance of
these that gained them, among other nicknames, that of
"Methodists."</p>

<p>This was not a new term; Wesley himself declared that it was
given to some Roman physicians who advocated the strict regulation
of diet and exercise, and it had certainly been used in Church
disputes as early as 1639. At Oxford, however, it appeared "new and
quaint" and clung to the little band of dons and undergraduates
whose behaviour attracted a good deal of attention in the
University. They were called also "enthusiastics," "Bible bigots,"
and excited an equal amount of derision and sympathy. There were
even complaints to the Bishop of Oxford about the new club, but he
could find no fault with the little fellowship, and the old Rector
sent encouraging letters from Epworth: how could either he or his
wife disapprove of anything so methodical as these "Bible
moths"?</p>

<p>The name, though given in derision, was not inapt; these
diligent students were almost wearing away the pages of the Holy
Book by study, searching for guidance, precedents, inspiration;
they tried to get back to the rules of the Primitive Church, to
find out what really was the Divine Will; they communicated
regularly in the Cathedral, they prayed, fasted, meditated, even
"let blood" to cool their bodies, and began to visit the sick, the
poor, and the infidel.</p>

<p>From the first John Wesley's leadership of this group of Oxford
Methodists was never disputed, and the conception of Christianity
that he then so enthusiastically embraced was one to which in the
main (his opinion was modified on many side-issues) he remained
faithful. His mental position was a curious one; he had given up
the intellectual pursuits that had fascinated him&mdash;his Euclid,
his Newton, his probings into ancient philosophies and
speculations&mdash;lest his faith should become unsettled; he
declared himself that, if he had continued these investigations, he
must have become a Deist, if not an Atheist&mdash;or at least have
reached that state of mind which says: "There must be something
somewhere, let us call it God."</p>

<p>John Wesley was then afraid of knowledge and the reasoning
arising from knowledge; he wished to force himself into a blind
faith in the religion into which he had been born and bred; yet he
was equally afraid of mysticism. This was against his nature and he
persuaded himself that it was against his convictions; he dallied
with it for a while, for it offered an easy way out of many
difficulties, but he soon found it impossible to tolerate anything
vague, without rules, inexplicable, unreasonable, anything that
obviated, too, the necessity for a Saviour, for if man could get
into direct touch with God, what need of a mediator, a sacrifice,
or any of the elaborate machinery of sin and redemption to which
John Wesley was pledged? So the mystics went with the scientists
and philosophers, and the desperate seeker after salvation was left
with only faith on which to fall back; he could not, however,
relinquish his intellectual birthright, or wholly stop his mind
until it was like a run-down clock, even though he had denied it
food and freedom, and so, forced into one narrow channel, his
intellect tried to reason itself into faith, thus turning an
emotional into an intellectual process.</p>

<p>John Wesley still wanted everything <i>proved</i> as keenly as
he had wanted it in his nursery days, but he now shut out of his
consciousness everything but Anglican Christianity, refused all
side-issues as temptations or sin, and thus forced an energetic,
brilliant mind into a strait jacket.</p>

<p>At first this attitude seemed simple; keeping the rules held him
up like an iron prop. How could one anger God if one implicitly
obeyed Him?</p>

<p>A strong will and great moral courage found no difficulty,
either, in overcoming carnal weaknesses; coarse sensual temptations
had never been a danger, for they had never appealed to a delicate
ascetic nature, but John enjoyed his sleep, secular conversation,
the company of witty, clever people; he was excited by profane
books, like <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and <i>Gulliver's Travels;</i>
he had an intense intellectual curiosity; every new invention,
every discovery, all the fresh movements in science, art, and
letters delighted him exceedingly&mdash;but all these things could
be, and were, resigned; he rose earlier and earlier, he ate less
and less, his reading was sternly confined to "good" books, he
avoided the company of all who were likely to waste his time. At
Wroote and Epworth he had sometimes taken his sisters to fairs,
shot plover on the marshes, danced at village festivals, taken his
wine and beer with the rest.</p>

<p>No more of any of that; the harmless merry-making, the
stimulating conversation, went the way of optics and mathematics;
he could, and did, live strictly, sublimating mind, emotions, and
spirit into one channel. It was an extraordinary intellectual feat,
such as only a great man could be capable of&mdash;this forcing of
the reason to believe what the reason rejected; this mental search
for, and acceptance of, what has usually been tolerable only when
approached through heart or spirit. John Wesley tried to reach the
spiritual condition of the mystics and the saints by the way of
pragmatism.</p>

<p>He was not altogether satisfied that everything was well with
this system; his note-books show a torturing self-analysis;
feelings, doubts, instincts, arose in him of which he was deeply
ashamed; neither human nature nor common sense could be totally
extinguished, since there was no triumphant blaze of spirituality
to quench their small but steady flames.</p>

<p>Still all the rules were so well kept that John Wesley could
feel at least outwardly confident, and he was much upheld by the
applause of his followers and much gratified by the exercise of his
innate qualities for leadership and organization.</p>

<p>These impressed William Law, who had written the two books that
had so moved Wesley, and who had formed a close acquaintanceship
with his admirer: "You will want to convert the whole world," was
Law's tribute to Wesley's burning energy and rare singleness of
purpose.</p>

<p>Two dear pleasures John did not resign, but this was because he
incorporated them in his main purpose; his love of music and poetry
was used for the continual singing of hymns, often of his own
composition, to the glory of God, and his delicate friendship with
Betty Kirkham was refined into a tender care for her soul.</p>

<p>Since 1725 Wesley had been intimate with, and paid frequent
visits to, the Kirkham family at Staunton, Gloucestershire, where
the father was Rector, and Robert, the cheerful young theological
student, who was one of the first Methodists, wished and expected
to greet Wesley as his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>But the young don shrank from marriage, and not altogether for
financial reasons; he was inclined to agree with Keziah that a
single life was the "better way" and a wife would mean not only the
end of the bachelor life in Lincoln that suited him so well, but
the loss of the monetary dues from his Fellowship, his main source
of livelihood. Not in the least sensual, John Wesley liked the
companionship of women, in whose delicacy, submissiveness, and
elegance he found a great attraction, while the refinement of his
own nature was gratified by feminine sensitiveness. Few religious
leaders have been able to resist the seductive flattery offered by
the female disciple, and John Wesley enjoyed to the full this
delicious homage.</p>

<p>All his romantic needs were satisfied by the fair Betty Kirkham,
"so known, so loved," as Martha said of her, and affectionately
termed "dear Varanese." It was a rectory lawn, tea-cup, and a
Sunday parlour flirtation, frail and a little unctuous; Varanese
was perhaps "the religious friend" who had first urged Wesley to
take his faith seriously, and now it was his turn to instruct her
in holy practices. He spent some delightful holidays in Staunton,
where he was much admired not only for his holiness but for his
breeding, his elegance, his appearance of almost porcelain neatness
that was made peculiarly attractive by the unusual auburn curls and
the brilliant eyes that weeping over his sins with his
fellow-Methodists had not dimmed.</p>

<p>Martha thought that Varanese was "so dear" to John that she well
might make him forget his family, but the delightful friendship was
dissolving without rancour or regret; Betty Kirkham was being wooed
according to the fashion of the world by a man she afterwards
married, a Mr. Wilson, and in the discreet glades of Staunton
Wesley had met the proper heroine for a moonshine idyll.</p>

<p>The Kirkhams were well connected, and among their guests were
frequently the two nieces of the first Lord Lansdowne, who had been
imprisoned in the Tower for Jacobitism after the "Fifteen," but who
had been released to become the friend of Addison and Pope; these
two ladies were Miss Ann Granville and Mrs. Mary Pendarves, a young
widow. Lovely, fashionable, artificial, and cultured, they
represented all that was most superficially attractive in the
aristocracy of the time and were far more cool, brilliant, and
seductive than any other women whom Wesley had ever met. He made no
attempt to resist their polished charms, and a little Arcadia was
formed at Staunton that was the feminine counterpart to the Holy
Club of Oxford. The ladies lent a lighter air to the strenuous aims
of the Methodists; gravely interested, the sisters hovered, like
butterflies, on the edge of conversion, listening with deference
when Mr. Wesley urged that they should rise early and set aside
various hours in the day for public and private prayers, avoid
concerts on Sunday evenings, read "good" books, while they on their
side undertook to refine those manners undoubtedly well-bred but
marred by those little "improprieties" that came from the lack of
knowledge of the world where the sisters belonged.</p>

<p>John Wesley had never met ladies like these before; his own
mother was a well-born woman, nicely trained, but her gentility had
somewhat rusted at Epworth and she had never scintillated as did
the Granville ladies. Wesley was delighted with their misleading
humility that he believed to be sincere and that he prayed that he
might be enabled to imitate, for he still felt that he had too much
pride; the little coterie indulged in the fashionable game of
pseudo-classical nicknames. Charles and John were Araspes and
Cyrus, Ann was Selima, and Aspasia was the title under which John
Wesley sighed for the fascinating widow. He was really dazzled; the
fair women seemed to him "the image of God" and he fell in love not
so much with Mary Pendarves (whom he hardly knew) but with gossamer
Aspasia, who turned to him for religious instruction, who declared
that she saw "the beauty of holiness" in his precise countenance,
and who corresponded with him in languishing, provocative,
fastidious letters.</p>

<p>They did not meet very often; he had to return to his duties at
Lincoln College, she withdrew into the great world of London or
Dublin, which Wesley visualized as full of sparkling temptations
against which he anxiously warned her; but he held her in his
heart. He was afraid of avowed love and he had learned from
Varanese's example that these dainty ladies kept too long in airy
coquetry turned gradually to more downright suitors, so he kept a
little on guard.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the progress of the Holy Club continued, the members
became more active in practical good work; missioners among the
poor and outcast can hardly be long indifferent to the state of the
bodies of those whose souls they are trying to save. The
enthusiastic Morgan, who was hastening by fasts the tuberculosis
from which he was suffering, penetrated to the horrid darkness of
the Castle where the prisoners were confined in stench and filth,
was stricken by the misery he saw and cheered by a spiritual
success with one dying wretch; henceforth the Methodists undertook
regular visits to the Castle and the other city prison. Whether
these were in the nature of consolation to the victims of
eighteenth-century ideas of justice or merely added torments may be
questioned. The reading of Scripture in the chapel, the
dissertations on such books as the <i>Christian Monitor</i> or
<i>Country Parson's Advice to His Parishioners</i> may have been
soothing to these unfortunates, but one can hardly suppose that
anyone who found himself faced with the horrors of a gaol at the
period when the prison system was at its worst was much cheered by
being seized upon by an earnest young Methodist and subjected to a
"searching examination" as to the state of his soul, whether he
repented of his sins, whether he cherished vindictiveness towards
whoever had caused his misfortune, and whether he regularly partook
of the Sacraments and used prayer, private and public.</p>

<p>John Wesley and his followers were, indeed, doing what the
Rector of Epworth had done in Oxford Castle many years before:
using the helpless prisoners as raw material on which to practise
the zeal that was, they hoped, to save their own souls.</p>

<p>They, however, endeavoured to be of some practical good to their
victims and subscribed among themselves money to buy medicines and
books for the "gaolbirds"; yet, as the first were compounded by
ignorance and the second dictated by superstition, they might both,
perhaps, have been dispensed with, but the ready cash with which
these young men paid the debts of those who owed but little must
have been very acceptable, and it is possible that to those
confined in the misery of the Castle the Methodist prayers on
Wednesdays and Fridays, the sermon every Sunday, and the Sacrament
once a month, were a welcome break in the monotony of their
suffering.</p>

<p>Another helpless portion of the population attracted the
attention of the amateur evangelists; pauper children were herded
in little schools, where in return for some clothing and perhaps
food they were forced to listen to exhortations, lectures, and
prayers. Some good was undoubtedly done, some acute distress
relieved, some order, some rules of conduct, some idealism
inculcated, but the young zealots were mostly using these outcasts
and waifs to demonstrate their own powers, as a sculptor may use
stone or clay, and to sharpen their own souls to the fineness
necessary to pass through the needle's eye. Wesley noted of himself
that when he had thirty pounds a year he gave away forty shillings
annually; when sixty pounds, he still contrived on twenty-eight and
gave away thirty-two, and so on; the emphasis being not on the good
he did to others with the money given away but on the benefit to
himself of the sacrifice. Money was no temptation to one who had
resolved to set aside almost all that money can buy, and John
Wesley had far more pleasure in using his income thus than he would
have had in spending it on himself. Once when a poor child waited
on him at his rooms, he found that the wretched gown that she wore
was all her clothing; he had no money with which to relieve her and
looked with disgust at the pictures in his room&mdash;"Thou hast
adorned thy walls with money that might have screened this poor
creature from the cold!"</p>

<p>His usually acute sense of logic failed him here; if no one
bought pictures the painters also would become shivering objects of
charity. These zealous administrations among the prisoners and the
poor encouraged one of the worst vices of the Methodists: that of
meddling. It is, no doubt, difficult, if not impossible, to be a
missioner without being also an interfering busybody; obviously if
a man thinks that he holds a divine commission he must feel
justified in pestering everyone to listen to him, but "humanly
speaking," as pious Mary Stuart was often saying, he becomes an
intolerable nuisance, and when the Methodists began to attack
people of their own rank, intelligence, or education, they usually
met with a hostile reception. Students did not wish to be led away
from the enjoyable debauchery, or tutors from profane but congenial
occupations, and the outcry against the Methodists became loud in
Oxford.</p>

<p>Some gentlemen restrained their sons or wards from joining the
Methodists by threat of disinheritance, and when in 1732 William
Morgan died of a wasting disease, his father roundly declared that
the Methodists had starved him to death, and John Wesley was moved
to a public defence of himself and his followers. Charles Kinchin
soon, as his colleagues put it, followed Morgan through "the pearly
gates "; it is probable that he died of gaol-fever; Charles Wesley
wrote in his honour one of the noblest of the lovely hymns that
streamed from the pen of this fervid and graceful poet.</p>

<p>It is a touching tribute both to the sincere piety of Charles
and to the deep affection and respect that he bore John, that he
submitted to the rigid laws required by the Methodists, for he
himself, despite his mother's training, was by no means a
disciplinarian; impetuous, erratic, with warm feelings and the
restlessness of creative genius, he found it difficult to live by
rule; he was also often harsh and censorious, but the passion of
his humanity, his tender pity, and ready sympathy softened much
that was cold and humourless in many of the Methodist rules. What,
for instance, could be more tedious than the resolve to plan in
advance any conversation to be held in any gathering and to decide
how to make it edifying? Another custom was likely to lead to
difficulties and blunders; in 1729 John Wesley had resolved to
accept "the Bible as the one, the only standard of truth, and the
only model of pure religion." So far, well and good, since the
Bible was broad enough to have already comfortably accommodated a
multitude of diverse thinkers, but the Methodists went farther:
they decided to use the Holy Book as a kind of oracle; by opening
the volume and reading the sentence on which a finger was placed at
random, they believed that they discovered the direct will of God
in some doubt or dilemma. This kind of spiritual sortilege was an
ancient method of divination that had often been used by those whom
John Wesley would have roundly denounced as children of Satan, but
he firmly believed in the method and employed it all his life with
varying degrees of success.</p>

<p>In the 1730's Wesley's life hurried to a climax; his father was
ailing and urging him to apply for the Epworth living, and the
friendship with Aspasia was dissolving like a rainbow. She was not
a woman to marry for mere worldly reasons, since she had refused
Frederick Calvert, the Earl of Baltimore, heir of the wealth of
Maryland, and afterwards gave her hand to Patrick Delany, who had
no great position, and she might have married the fascinating
Wesley had he dared to ask her; but he did not.</p>

<p>The elder and the younger Samuel both strongly urged John to
apply for the Epworth cure of souls; they put forward many good
reasons&mdash;there was a patch of human wheat, "white for the
harvest," that might never be garnered if a gross, fox-hunting
parson were sent to replace the Rev. Samuel&mdash;thus nearly forty
years of labour would be lost and Epworth fall back into its former
state of semi-barbarism; there were, too, more intimate
considerations. Toil had been put into the glebe land, the Rectory
had been furnished, trees planted, gardens laid out, the stables
and sties stocked; the thrifty course was to use the fruits of so
many long efforts for the family benefit. Samuel, cosy at
Blundell's, thought that John should go to Epworth to make a home
for the mother, for Keziah and Emilia, the two unmarried daughters,
a holiday place for Charles, and possibly for Sukey and Hetty,
whose marriages had been so unhappy, but John also was cosy at
Oxford and sent twenty-six closely argued reasons to his father to
prove that he was doing more spiritual good where he was than he
could possibly do at Epworth, and the Bishop of Oxford supported
him in this opinion. John had a small curacy outside Oxford and
this, he argued, fulfilled the promises that he had made at
Ordination; it was, besides, a good excuse for keeping a horse,
which would in other circumstances have been an inexcusable luxury.
Among the Oxford Methodists, after the deaths of Morgan and
Kinchin, after Whitelambe had retired to Epworth and the despair
that finally brought him to Deism, after the marriage of Westley
Hall, there were: Robert Kirkham, John Gambold (who had more of the
visionary in him than pleased his fellow-Methodists), James Harvey
(afterwards famous as the author of <i>Meditations Among the
Tombs,</i> one of the many lugubrious efforts inspired by Edward
Young's <i>Night Thoughts),</i> Benjamin Ingham (of Queen's
College, a handsome Yorkshireman), John Clayton (of Brasenose
College, Jacobite and humanitarian), and several other men of
singleness of purpose and clear-cut views, though these afterwards
became very divergent.</p>

<p>The Holy Club was bound very tightly together by rules; the
members conversed in Latin (the Wesley brothers sometimes in
Greek); they observed the same hours for the same duties and were
pledged to follow strictly the ritual of the Primitive Church, as
far as this could be ascertained, while their habits were of
monastic simplicity; every hour was planned out so as not to waste
time in the great task of achieving salvation. John and Charles
found that they could read and converse while walking from Oxford
to Epworth and that their health was thereby improved. There was,
besides, the chance of arguing with and perhaps converting some
fellow-traveller; they marched to the rhythm of the hymns that they
sang and felt the exaltation of a co-ordination of mind and body in
one purpose.</p>

<p>The Rector of Epworth was fast approaching the awful moment when
he would be, he hoped, assured of the reward of his long service to
his God; he had been, some time before John was advised to ask for
Epworth, thrown out of a waggon when the horses took fright and had
severely injured his head; "the blackness in his face" and the fact
that he looked "prodigious wild" showed the severity of his injury.
Mrs. Wesley had seen the Lord's hand in the road accident that had
disposed of her enemy, Robert Darwin, but she made no comment on
the fact that the same method was followed to remove a saint. The
Rector never recovered from this fall, though he lived to endure a
long illness, afflicted with palsy and gout. He still retained,
however, enough energy to grapple with the six hundred Latin pages
that went to form his <i>Dissertationes in Librum Jobi</i> and to
argue with John about his refusal to apply for the Epworth living;
the old man thought that John's insistence on remaining in Oxford
was selfishness, not holiness, and said so tartly.</p>

<p>Westley Hall was then distracting the Wesleys with his double
courtship of the two sisters, and family affairs were not
prosperous; overcome by the arguments of his brother Samuel, John
at last took steps to obtain the Epworth living, using what
influence he had to get it. A friend of his, then curate at the
Tower Chapel, London, solicited Henry St. John, Lord Bolingbroke,
and Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London, on his behalf; but John Wesley
did not seem to be popular with either of these powerful gentlemen,
who did not admire his "strictness of views," and the other
candidate, bitterly termed by the dying Rector "a mighty Nimrod,"
got the living.</p>

<p>Broughton, the interceding friend, had suggested that <i>Job</i>
should be dedicated and presented to Queen Caroline: "it might do
good. The King is not so difficult (I hope) if one could get a
hearty friend to espouse you." So <i>Job</i> was urged towards its
finish by the palsied hand of old Samuel Wesley and the dedication
to the German Queen written out, in the eager hope that she might
prove as gracious as Mary Stuart, who so many years ago had given
Epworth to the curate of Ormsby. The plates were a matter of grave
trouble; the author was obliged to pay for them himself, and Mr.
Virtue, the engraver, was "dunning pretty hard" for payment; John
was the intermediary in this question of the engravings that
touched the old man very nearly. He wanted "Leviathan's rival, that
is, the whale," introduced into one composition, as well as the
crocodile, but thought the "tombs" in another illustration needed
no more retouching.</p>

<p>The letter on this business was the last that he wrote to John.
"Time has shaken me by the hand and death is but a little way
behind him," he declared, while Mrs. Wesley wrote: "Your father is
in a very bad state of health. He sleeps little and eats less. He
seems not to have any apprehension of his approaching exit; but I
fear he has but a short time to live.. everyone observes his decay
but himself and people really seem very much concerned for him and
his family."</p>

<p>The fierce and lawless Fen folk were indeed much kinder than
formerly to the old man, wasted and changed by age and sickness,
who still sometimes stiffly climbed into the pulpit at the services
held in his church by John Whitelambe, and who was, they knew,
toiling so doggedly at the book that he hoped would make some
provision for his family. The thought of his worldly affairs
troubled the Rector deeply, but he left the whole matter "with Him
to whom I committed all my concerns, without exception and without
reserve, for soul and body, estate and family, time and eternity."
These were solemn words, and the hour now approached in which the
weary old man was to put their truth to the test. Charles, in
declining his brother's invitation to Tiverton, wrote that their
father was almost at his journey's end, adding: "My mother seems
more cast down at the prospect of his death than I thought that she
could have been; and, what is more, he seems so too."</p>

<p>The two brothers went from Oxford to Epworth in the spring of
1735, to be present at the end of his long, hard, cheerless
journey. To the Wesleys, death had even more than the common
awfulness; it was to them, as indeed to so many of the serious
Christians of their day, of ritualistic importance. They believed
that a death-bed conversion or repentance could efface a lifetime
of fault or error, and that in the case of one who had always
walked in the right way it should be the seal on a bond
triumphantly kept, a glorious affirmation of faith. One of the most
popular of books was Jeremy Taylor's <i>Holy Living and Holy
Dying,</i> and those who could not attain the first were often
surprisingly successful in achieving the last. These Christian
death-beds were of the eldest son, who had already been liberal,
was now the main hope of the Wesleys, though a small pittance might
be secured from a Benevolent Society for Mrs. Wesley, who was
destitute; the brother in India on whom so many hopes had rested
had not been heard of for long, Matthew Wesley had done much and
could do no more, and every member of the Rev. Samuel's family was
poor, save only the harassed master at Blundell's, to whom his
mother must now "be burdensome." Truly the patience of that Job on
whom the Rector had dwelt so long was now required by the Wesleys,
and they needed to think and talk hard of Heaven, as he had
advised, in order that they might forget their grim lot on earth.
There was no will, as the old man had nothing to leave; a hundred
pounds of debt remained, and all the improvements in the house,
glebe farm, and garden, due to the care and effort of the Wesley
family, must now pass to a stranger. Mrs. Wesley did not murmur;
the indomitable woman packed up her few and modest belongings and
left the home of her long married life to journey to the little
school that sad Emilia, still grieving for her Quaker lover, kept
in Gainsborough. The stock and furniture at Epworth were sold to
pay the creditors, and the two brothers travelled back to Oxford,
John with a copy of <i>Job</i> in his bundle; he had sufficient
influence to be able to obtain an audience of the Queen and hoped
something from her recognition of his father's great work, even
though he had missed the Epworth living.</p>

<p>Soon after his return to Oxford, John preached before the
University (June 11, 1734) a sermon that was supposed to have a
strong Jacobite tinge, for which he was "much mauled and
threatened," and also wrote the three books that were issued in
1735; they were not the first of his very numerous publications,
<i>Forms of Prayer</i> being published in 1733. One of the later
books was a translation of Thomas  Kempis, the second a sermon, the
third advice to a young clergyman.</p>

<p>The Wesleys were now scattered: the married sisters in their
different homes, all of them more or less poor and unhappy; Keziah,
supported by doles from her brothers, staying here and there with
friends, or with Martha at Wootton, her face turned, after the loss
of her father, even more resolutely towards her own early death;
Emilia was drudging in her school; Hetty and Sukey enduring the
brutality of their drunken husbands, the former, who had lost all
her infants, sinking into a deep melancholy, the latter now flying
from, now brought back to, her worthless partner. John Lambert,
Anne's husband, was weak and intemperate, and across the early
married life of Martha was the shadow of the increasing instability
and eccentricity of Westley Hall and the plaintive resignation of
Keziah; the harsh training, the grim piety meted out by Samuel
Wesley and his wife towards their children may have caused two of
the sons to become great men, but they certainly had not resulted
in making happy women of the daughters.</p>

<p>John Wesley was discouraged to find that, whenever he returned
to Oxford after an absence, the members of the Holy Club had fallen
away, and the enthusiasm of the Methodists dwindled to vanishing
point. Many of his followers were earnest, sincere men, but when
not galvanized by their leader's fierce energy they relapsed, not
into indifference, Deism, or Atheism, for many of them remained
ardent evangelists all their lives, but into their own way of
thinking and into laxity regarding those rules by which John set
such store. He could, however, congratulate himself on one convert
who was inclined even to surpass himself in enthusiasm and who
promised to be a very remarkable man; this ardent disciple whom
John looked on with guarded approval and Charles with affection was
a poor servitor of Pembroke College, who had brought himself to the
notice of the Methodists shortly before the death of the Rector of
Epworth. An apple-seller whose stall was outside Pembroke College
came to Charles Wesley at Christ Church and told him that she had
been sent by a Mr. Whitefield, who desired to make known the case
of a woman in the Workhouse who had tried to cut her throat; the
Wesleys were interested in the personality of the servitor of
Pembroke, invited him to breakfast at Christ Church, and heard his
story that was told in a gush of warm and dramatic eloquence quite
new to these sternly-trained men, many of whom were restrained by
dry complacency and formal self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>George Whitefield was not a gentleman by breeding, though he
came of respectable people, and, though he had been three years at
Pembroke, he was not a scholar and scarcely an educated man in the
sense in which the others were; he was eleven years younger than
John Wesley, and therefore little more than a youth, and the son of
the woman who kept the Bell Inn at Gloucester, where he had been
born and where for a while he had acted as pot-boy. Sent to the
school of St. Mary le Crypt in his native town, he had easily
developed a gift for acting and had attracted much attention in the
parts&mdash;often female&mdash;that he undertook in the plays the
boys gave on festivals before the Corporation of Gloucester. This
early life had been, as he saw it now, extremely sinful. Not only
had he been the companion of "loose livers," but he had pilfered
coppers from his mother to give to the poor and to purchase the
holy books, among which was that author&mdash;known as Thomas a
Kempis&mdash;who had so influenced John Wesley. His schoolmaster
liked him and obtained for him the position of servitor at Pembroke
College&mdash;similar to that filled by the elder Samuel at Exeter
College&mdash;whereby he could obtain a degree by doing menial work
in return for his education. He had proved cheerful, quick, and
diligent in this ambiguous situation and had pleased the young
gentlemen on whom he waited, although he was not of a prepossessing
appearance; flabby and pallid, he had a weak, timid look, his
features were plump and insignificant, and the sole fascination of
his face lay in the violent squint&mdash;the result of
measles&mdash;that sent one of his eyes into the base of his
nose.</p>

<p>Attracted by the gossip he heard about the Holy Club, he had
watched eagerly and timidly the activities of the Methodists, often
being among the crowd of idlers who gathered to stare and perhaps
to jeer at the Wesleys and their followers going to the cathedral,
the prison, or on some charitable errand, with pious books in their
hands and prayers upon their lips. He now begged with passion and
humility that he might be allowed to join the men whom he had so
long and so profoundly admired. Charles, kind and friendly as
always, agreed to accept this new member, and George Whitefield at
once threw himself with dramatic extravagance into the spirit of
the Holy Club. He surpassed all the other members in asceticism;
prayed, fasted on dry bread and sage tea, wore a patched gown,
dirty shoes, and woollen gloves, and cast himself prostrate,
groaning for his sins, in Christ Church Walk, for two hours
together in the rain. The normal undergraduates of Pembroke found,
naturally enough, matter for amusement in these antics of the poor
servitor, and the Master rebuked Whitefield as a crack-brained
enthusiast and threatened to expel him. The abashed penitent then
promised to abate some of his extravagances, but far from doing so
starved himself into a severe illness during the coming Lent.
Charles Wesley, alarmed at Whitefield's state, asked John to visit
him with a view to reasoning with him, for the fanatical young man
had now brought himself to such a pitch that he believed he ought
to deny himself even the comfort of church-going and spiritual
communion with friends. Wesley advised the agonizing convert to
indulge in his former consolations, though not to rely on them, but
to await peace as a direct bounty from God. Whitefield remained,
however, dangerously ill, and was only saved by the practical help
of his tutor, who sent a doctor to him, paid his bills, and lent
him books that helped to restore his mental balance. Whitefield
came out of this ordeal, which seems to have been mainly physical,
with a feeling that the "day star" was rising in his heart, and
returned passionately to his religious life. He had attached
closely to him one already drawn to the Methodists, the
melancholic, sickly, and sentimental James Harvey, whom Whitefield
thought "a heavenly-minded creature." Both these young men thought
much of death and damnation, but Whitefield in a zestful way that
was almost cheerful. These were two brilliant converts, and John
Wesley was proud of them, though sometimes a little dubious as to
their ideas; he was also concerned about another Methodist, the
gentle and tolerant John Gambold, who began to devote himself to
that solitary study which was ill-suited to the aggressive
missionary zeal favoured by the Wesleys, and resulted in that frame
of mind which found a refuge and an outlet in the Moravian Church.
These three men represented the three branches of religious thought
that sprang from the Holy Club&mdash;John Wesley, the original
Oxford Methodists; George Whitefield, the Calvinist Methodists;
John Gambold, the English Moravians&mdash;but all seemed, in 1735,
to be united in a common cause.</p>

<p>In this year John went to London, used his influence to obtain
the Queen's permission to wait on her with a copy of <i>Job,</i>
the result of so many years of intense labour on the part of Samuel
Wesley and Johnny Whitelambe. While waiting for his audience John
met the energetic Dr. Burton of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, who
presented him to Colonel James Oglethorpe, a soldier who had gained
distinction under Prince Eugene, and whose philanthropic interests
had secured him the honour of two odes from the elder Samuel
Wesley. Oglethorpe was about to make a second visit to a colony
that he had been instrumental in founding in 1732; the Wesleys were
known to him not only through their poems but through the
enthusiastic encouragement and some donations given by them to his
humanitarian and patriotic scheme, and he offered John and his
brother the opportunity of sailing with him to America. Here was an
opening so unexpected that it seemed as if acceptance must be the
Divine wish; but not being quite sure of God, John, after much
debate among his friends, went to consult the infallible Susanna
Wesley, determined to abide by her decision. Her judgment could
scarcely be brought to bear on the matter, since she knew nothing
either of Georgia or of the settlers or of James Oglethorpe, nor,
indeed, whether her own sons were suited to such work as was
proposed for them&mdash;a secretaryship for Charles, a chaplaincy
for John, and for both the task of converting the American savages
to Christianity of the type taught in Epworth Rectory.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>
GEORGIA.</h2>

<p class="first">
BEFORE John Wesley took his problem to his mother in
Gainsborough, he put it before several of the original members of
the Holy Club now installed in various parishes throughout England.
John had also asked the advice of his brother Samuel and of William
Law, and discussed the strange, attractive prospect with his
brother's friend James Hutton, whose father kept a boarding-school
in Westminster, and who was afterwards one of the founders of the
Moravian Church in England. Meanwhile, Dr. Burton urged acceptance
of the offer on John; it was very difficult to get clergymen for
the new colony. America seemed, indeed, to offer rich opportunities
of good works, and the idea instantly appealed to Mrs. Wesley, who
with the brevity and the decision of a Roman matron said: "Had I
twenty sons I should rejoice if they were all so employed."</p>

<p>In the little parlour of the modest school in Gains-borough,
Susanna Wesley, her daughter Emilia, and John bravely and
enthusiastically discussed the prospects of evangelical work in the
New World, while the two women remembered the day fifteen years ago
when Emilia had found the book on the Danish Missionaries on her
father's desk. A desire to travel among and to convert the heathen
had always been strong in this family, and, only a short time
before, the Rector of Epworth had written to Colonel Oglethorpe
warmly congratulating him on the founding of Georgia and wishing
that he were young enough to offer his services to convert the
Indians. Even then, palsied and infirm as he was, the gallant old
man was not in the least daunted by the prospect of learning the
uncouth language of these heathens. Yes, it was a wonderful task
that was offered to the young Oxford don, and though at first he
had been doubtful, indeed had almost refused Oglethorpe, he began
to grow enthusiastic under his mother's encouragement. What, after
all, could better forward his dearest project, the salvation of his
own soul, than the conversion of the heathen? He began to see the
Redskins under the most seductive light. Here was virgin soil
indeed, unless some of them had been tampered with by French or
Spanish priests from Louisiana or Florida; but he had been assured
that most of these savages had never even heard of Christianity.
What different material was there, from the brutal, debased Fenman
or the sophisticated intellectuals of Oxford!</p>

<p>What different material even from the sullen wretches in the
prisons, and the whining paupers, half stupefied from want and
misery, to whom John Wesley had been used to preach! Besides, his
work at Oxford seemed to have come to an end.</p>

<p>The first band of the Enthusiasts had scattered, John Gambold
had gone to Stanton Harcourt, Clayton and Byrom were in Manchester,
Ingham was in Essex, and Wesley could not see in the Oxford of 1735
any promising recruits to fill up these gaps in the Holy Club;
then, when Dr. Burton wrote urging Wesley to accept this offer, his
exhortations were mingled with flatteries of a type peculiarly
agreeable to the young clergyman. "Plausible and popular Doctors of
Divinity are not the men wanted for Georgia, for the ease, luxury,
and levity in which they are accustomed to indulge disqualify them
for such a work." In brief, "the Trustees of the new colony were
looking for men who were inured to contempt of the ornaments and
conveniences of life, to bodily austerities, and to serious
thought."</p>

<p>These qualities John felt he could justly claim, and on
September 18 he wrote accepting the position of chaplain for
Georgia, at a salary of fifty pounds a year. Dr. Burton sent an
encouraging reply, which still further stimulated Wesley's ardour
by informing him that he would have many chances of being useful
during the long voyage, and added, what was even more to the young
man's mind, that when he arrived in the new colony he was to visit
from house to house and preach everywhere, "for some of the
colonists are ignorant, and most of them are disposed to
licentiousness."</p>

<p>Georgia owed its foundation to the energetic methods of a small
body of humanitarians and Imperialistic patriots. The most active
of these were James Edward Oglethorpe, descended, as his Christian
names show, from a family of Jacobite sympathizers, and Lord
Perceval, an Irish peer who afterwards became Lord Egmont. James
Oglethorpe was a man of strong character, of much influence, and
with an assured position; he had been the Member of Parliament for
Haslemere in Surrey since he had left the Army, and always been
zealous in good causes. Once, visiting a friend confined for debt,
he was appalled by the hideous state of the prison, and was
instrumental in getting together a committee to enquire into this,
particularly into the atrocities committed by one of the warders of
the Fleet Prison, Thomas Bainbridge. Though in the end Bainbridge
and a colleague were acquitted, Oglethorpe's Committee was the
means of revealing at least a large number of terrible abuses, and
his conscientious and laborious report called attention to, if it
did not end, many of the worst horrors of the eighteenth-century
prison system.</p>

<p>This large-minded man had also worked in the interest of the
small investor and of the negro slaves. He was, in politics, a
liberal Tory, opposed to any illegal pretensions and extravagances
on the part of the Court, but a loyal supporter of the House of
Hanover.</p>

<p>The scheme for founding a new colony occurred to Oglethorpe out
of the Commission to inquire into the state of prisons. His
exertions in favour of poor debtors had resulted in the passing of
an Act which allowed those who owed only small sums to be released
from prison; these freed prisoners now formed a body of useless
pauper unemployed, and Oglethorpe's scheme was to send them
overseas, where they might begin a new life in the New World. The
scheme was from the first popular, and there was a general desire
to see it enlarged to include all vagrants and beggars under
sixteen years of age, who were to be sent out of the country that
they were supposed to encumber. The House of Commons would not,
however, agree to this, but there was no lack of material to send
overseas. The Trustees for the funds and property took offices in
Palace Yard, not far from Westminster and near Millbank Ferry. Many
public-spirited and generous men offered them their services; among
these was the secretary, Mr. Benjamin Martin, and the accountant,
Mr. Harman Verelst. Lord Peter, the Duke of Richmond, and Sir Hans
Sloane offered to subscribe funds to enable the Trustees to send
out an ingenious person to the new colony to discover any medicinal
herbs, plants, and roots, and to instruct the colonists in
agriculture.</p>

<p>A Civil Government was to be established in Georgia, as the new
province was to be named, out of compliment to the King, a town
laid out to be called Savannah after the great river that flowed
into the Atlantic, and the first settlers were to go out with a
surgeon, an apothecary, and a voluntary chaplain. Lord Perceval was
appointed the President of the Trustees, among whom were five
clergymen. Oglethorpe, a liberal-minded man, tried for religious
toleration, and every kind of Christian was to be acceptable in the
new colony, except of course Papists, who were then scarcely
considered Christians in England, and who might be dangerous as
spies or mischief-makers with the Spanish on the one side and the
French on the other. For the scheme, as the King well knew, was not
altogether philanthropic: the interest of the Empire, as well as
the interests of the paupers, was to be served, and Oglethorpe's
idea, warmly approved of by the energetic and sensible Guelph, was
to erect out of this kind of no-man's-land a buffer state, one to
extend gradually and unostentatiously, and protect them against the
French and Spanish settlements.</p>

<p>On November 16, 1732, Mr. Oglethorpe had sailed from Gravesend
in the ship <i>Anne,</i> with 114 settlers "40 able, sensible men,
the rest women and children"&mdash;for the lands in North America
that were described in the Charter as "seven undivided parts of all
those Lands, Countries and Territories situate, lying, and being in
that part of South Carolina in America which lies in the most
Northern stream of a river there commonly called the Savannah, all
along the Sea coast to the Southward unto the most Southern stream
of the said other great Water or River called the Alatamaha and
Westward from the heads of the said rivers respectively in direct
line to the South Seas."</p>

<p>James Oglethorpe was glad to have the services of men like the
Wesleys, of whom he had heard nothing but good reports. He and John
admired each other and got on well together; the soldier was a man
of exceptional force and depth of character, magnanimous, brave,
unusually humane, though autocratic and sometimes arrogant. He was
what was then known as a God-fearing man, and if his private life
was not spotless, it was decent; but he made little parade of
religion, nor could John's anxious persistency bring him to any
open enthusiasm on this point. This Imperial idealist was, besides,
a well-bred gentleman of distinguished manners, then thirty-eight
years of age, full of fiery energy somewhat impatiently controlled,
his graceful person set off by the formal apparel of an English
aristocrat. His severe aquiline face, lit by large flashing eyes,
was framed in the powdered curled peruke then fashionable.</p>

<p>Though the founder of Georgia and the Wesleys agreed in so much,
he was not as single-minded as they; earnest Christian as he was,
Oglethorpe's main concern was not the salvation of the souls of the
colonists and Indians, but the material success of the laborious
and doubtful enterprise. Georgia, besides forming a barrier against
the Spaniards, was to grow flax and vines and to manufacture silk.
In the last venture lay Oglethorpe's main hope of making the money
needed for Imperial defence, and on the seal used by the Trustees
were cut the figures of spinning-worms; but his prospects of
creating a flourishing colony were much jeopardized by his own
principles and ideas; he had forbidden the introduction of rum into
Georgia and refused to allow the colonists to employ slaves. This
last prohibition was a serious handicap to the progress of Georgia
from the material point of view; the neighbouring province of
Carolina employed 30,000 negro slaves "to work six days in the week
without pay."</p>

<p>There were other objections than those on humanitarian grounds
to the employment of slaves; an able-bodied negro cost thirty
pounds; the same amount of money would transport a settler from
England to Georgia, provide his tools, and keep him for a year.</p>

<p>The Trustees argued, too, that the Spaniards at St.</p>

<p>Augustine would entice away the negroes, who might also possibly
rise and murder the white men, unused to control them. Besides, the
use of slaves would encourage laziness in the colonists, who were
by no means as energetic as Oglethorpe wished to see them; to
thrift, prudence and humanity joined nicely in forbidding slavery;
but the position was almost as bitterly resented by the English as
was the lack of rum; hard work, plain living, and self-denial were
not likely to appeal to people who had been unable to cope with
easier conditions in their native land.</p>

<p>None of these problems that burdened Oglethorpe troubled John
Wesley; his reasons for going to America were clear-cut: he wrote
in his Journal:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="quote">My chief motive is the hope of saving my soul.
I hope to learn the true sense of the Gospel of Christ by teaching
it to the heathen. They have no comments to construe away the text,
no vain philosophies to corrupt it, no luxurious, sensual,
covetous, and vicious expounders to soften unpleasing truths. They
have no party, no interest to serve and are, therefore, fit to
receive the Gospel in its simplicity. They are as little children,
humble, willing to learn, and eager to do the will of God.</p>

<br>

<p>He rejoiced to think that the Indians had not been interfered
with by Papists, Atheists, or the hundred and one varieties of
Protestants that had sprung up, to the confusion of the faithful
since the Reformation. It was a magnificent opportunity for
personal salvation. John Wesley declared: "I cannot hope to attain
the same degree of holiness here that I may there."</p>

<p>Two days before he sailed John was allowed to wait on the Queen
and to present to Her Majesty the <i>Job.</i></p>

<p>Caroline of Anspach, clever, plain, and alert, was gracious to
the neat little clergyman with the well-brushed auburn hair and
speckless hands. "It is a handsome binding," she smiled and laid
the volume aside, without as much as glancing at those laborious
pages or those keenly-discussed engravings. Nor is it likely that
she ever opened the covers of the book that she had so kindly
accepted; she was a busy woman and she had her own troubles, nor
was John any longer greatly concerned for the fate of the massive
tome, for he was absorbed in preparations&mdash;almost entirely
spiritual&mdash;for the American adventure, which he intended to
begin by making converts of the medley of adventurers whom
Oglethorpe was taking out on the <i>Simmonds</i>, as his second
consignment of colonists. There were pleasant farewells from the
Trustees, who were so delighted with the two eager, learned young
men that they thought God must be favouring Georgia by sending two
such model clergymen there. There were family partings, a letter
from John to Samuel, and on October 14, 1735, the Methodists
embarked on board the <i>Simmonds</i>, then lying off
Gravesend.</p>

<p>John and Charles had a cabin in the forecastle of the timbered
sailing-ship. As soon as they reached it John, full of great zest
for this new spiritual venture, began to draw up yet another set of
the rules by which he lived&mdash;self-discipline, to begin with,
semi-starvation (only rice and biscuits), the smallest allowance of
sleep, and the days minutely parcelled out.... At five in the
morning they must rise and pray for an hour, until seven they must
read the Bible together, then the meagre breakfast, at eight public
prayers, and an exposition of the lesson. Then for three hours the
four men must separate, John to learn German, in order that he
might converse with the Moravians, Delamotte to study Greek and
Navigation, Charles to write his sermons or his hymns, and Ingham
to give religious instruction to such children as were on board and
not too sea-sick. At midday more prayers, at one o'clock more
water, rice, and biscuits; after this the four men must go about
the ship, preaching to or cross-examining the passengers. At four,
evening prayers and more sermons; children instructed in the
presence of the congregation. From five to six, private prayers.
Then for the next hour, each in his own cabin to read devotional
works to selected numbers of the passengers. At seven, two more
services, one in which Wesley joined the Moravians, and another
that Ingham held between the decks. At eight o'clock the Methodists
retired, but not to rest. There was an hour of instruction and
exhortation, then to bed, mats and blankets being disdained. Such
was the method with which John divided the hours, and at first it
was strictly followed.</p>

<p>There was no more escape for the passengers from these zealous
ministrations than there had been for the prisoners in the gaols or
the paupers in the slums at Oxford, and John, for the first part of
the voyage, completely enjoyed himself; he succeeded in getting a
drunken woman of bad character put ashore before the ship sailed
and in inducing Oglethorpe to dismiss the second mate, who was "an
unrighteous and wicked man."</p>

<p>Storms held up the ship at Cowes, and there John had the intense
satisfaction of baptizing four Quakers and of driving from the ship
probably the only man among the passengers with a balanced mind,
who objected to the use of the one public cabin for religious
services, and went ashore in disgust. John was a little sea-sick
from the tossing of the ship (as the sea rolled higher) and Mr.
Delamotte was exceedingly ill for several days, but John continued
an activity that seemed indeed superhuman; he was everywhere,
watching, praying, sitting by the sick, struggling with them for
repentance, distributing his booklets, taking his neat, smiling
face, his auburn curls, his compact, black-robed figure from one
part to another of the tossing ship with tireless alacrity. At
first the ardent evangelist had every reason to be pleased at the
success of his ministrations. Terrified by the tempestuous waves
and exhausted by illness, many passengers confessed themselves
converted, but the voyage of fifty-seven days was a strain on
everyone's nerves, and Wesley began to find unconsciously many of
his own faults in Oglethorpe, a man who resembled him, in that the
soldier, like the preacher, was by nature proud, arrogant,
independent, even exasperating; he would neither endure much
interference nor abate the fiery hauteur of the manner that glossed
his deep humanity, nor be induced to make an emotional display of
religion; he supported John, but not very zealously; he was not
present at many of the services.</p>

<p>There was much illness on the <i>Simmonds,</i> caused not only
by the tossing of the vessel in the Bay of Biscay but also by the
coarse salt provisions, the unequal distribution of water, the
unhealthy accommodation, and the foul air of the cabins. James
Oglethorpe, magnanimous as usual, gave up his cabin and all his
comforts to the prostrate women, the Wesleys surrendered theirs to
him and triumphantly endured privation and physical misery. There
soon began to be&mdash;inevitably among so many people of different
types, ages, and temperaments, shut up together in fear and
discomfort&mdash;whispering, back-biting, quarrellings, and nervous
storms. The worst trouble, of course, was with the women, and the
worst of the women was a certain Mrs. Beata Hawkins, the surgeon's
wife, who, at first frivolous, gay, and even lewd, suddenly plucked
John Wesley by the neat cassock and asked him to instruct her in
the nature of the Lord's Supper. With becoming tears in her
handsome eyes she declared her contrition for her sins and begged
to be shown the way to salvation.</p>

<p>Deeply gratified, John read to Beata Hawkins his friend William
Law's leaflet on Christian Perfection, and was so impressed by her
reverent reception of this work that he admitted her to the
Communion table, set up in the public cabin. The other women had,
however, no faith in the repentance of the frivolous charmer, and
there was at once a shrill outcry at what seemed to the respectable
females an impudent piece of hypocrisy on the part of a slut.
Charles Wesley, Ingham, and Delamotte agreed with this opinion, and
Oglethorpe, weary of all of them, would not listen to John Wesley's
point of view, which was that Mrs. Hawkins really had been
converted. While this undignified quarrel was at its highest pitch
a dangerous storm broke over the <i>Simmonds,</i> silencing the
dispute. John Wesley had a new experience: he found that he was
afraid, and his fear had a double edge; it showed him he was not
fit to die. This was a horrible realization. After so much toil, so
much self-denial, after such stern adherence to rule and Method, to
feel unwilling to face eternity, to doubt the goodness of
God&mdash;what could this mean?</p>

<p>John forgot the arts of Beata Hawkins, the clamours of the other
women, the trying aloofness of Oglethorpe, the disloyalty of
Charles and the other Methodists, while he sat lonely, his head in
his hands, speculating with alarmed curiosity on this new
emotion&mdash;fear of sudden death.</p>

<p>While he was debating this problem&mdash;if he was afraid to
die, could he be sure of salvation?&mdash;the <i>Simmonds</i> ran
into calm weather and the bored, exasperated passengers broke into
fresh bickerings over Mrs. Hawkins. Then another violent wind
arose; John noted in the Journal that he now kept carefully every
day:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">About nine the sea broke over us from stem to
stern, burst through the windows of the state-cabin, where three or
four of us were sheltered, and covered us all over, though a bureau
sheltered me from the main shock. About eleven I lay down in the
great cabin, and in a short time fell asleep, though very uncertain
whether I should wake alive, much ashamed of my unwillingness to
die.</p>

<br>

<p>He had never been at sea before, and to cross the Atlantic in an
eighteenth-century sailing ship in the autumn under every
circumstance of nervous strain and physical discomfort was a trying
experience for any landsman; but John was only shaken, not
overthrown; he kept on his feet and stuck to his prayers. After the
third and worst tempest, when he had finished with his own
congregation, whom he kept two or three hours swaying on their
knees, reciting the psalm suitable to the occasion, he surrendered
to his intense natural curiosity and staggered along the tossing
ship to where the Moravians huddled round their drenched Bishop.
John had long observed their calm behaviour, which was as puzzling
to him as it was disconcerting. These meek, laborious Germans were
the best behaved among the passengers; they had even cheerfully
performed the most disgusting menial task, which the English had
refused, saying it was good for their proud hearts, and John noted,
with wondering admiration, behaviour as much to their credit as it
was to the shame of the English passengers:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">And every day had given them occasion of
showing a meekness which no injury could move. If they were pushed,
struck, or thrown down, they rose again and went away. No complaint
was found in their mouths.</p>

<br>

<p>There was now an opportunity of discovering whether the Germans
were delivered from the sin of fear as well as from those of pride,
anger, and revenge; John had noticed, in the midst of the psalm
that began their service, how the sea had broken over them, split
the mainsail to pieces, covered the ship, and poured in between the
decks, as if the great deep had already swallowed up the shuddering
vessel, and a terrible screaming began among the English, while the
Germans calmly sang on, their deep, steady voices rising above the
noise of the crashing waves. It was this behaviour that John now
investigated as he walked among the still-drenched Germans.</p>

<p>"Were you not afraid?" he asked one of the Moravians.</p>

<p>"I thank God, no."</p>

<p>"Were not your women and children afraid?"</p>

<p>"No, our women and children are not afraid to die."</p>

<p>John Wesley felt a little rebuked as well as bewildered, but he
at once drew a moral to his trembling confusion; here was "the
difference between him that feareth God and him that feareth Him
not."</p>

<p>The Moravians, then, had something that he lacked; he returned
abashed and thoughtful to his own cowardly flock.</p>

<p>That interval of calm was succeeded by another hurricane, while
quarrel and mutterings in the ship kept pace with the preachings
and prayings. The question of Mrs. Hawkins continued to exasperate
the passengers and divide the Methodists, and John Wesley alone
believed in her; but even he became harassed, and uncertain in his
own mind whether he was really performing the Lord's will. He got,
however, much satisfaction out of finding that he could sleep not
only without a mat and blanket but on the wet planks drenched with
water, and he noted triumphantly in his Journal: "I believe I shall
never need to use a bed again."</p>

<p>On February 5 the battered ship, with tattered canvas and mended
masts, was steered into the wide Savannah river and anchored near
little Tybee Island. John Wesley was too preoccupied to note
anything in this novel prospect except that the grove of pines
"running along the shore made an agreeable prospect, showing, as it
were, the bloom of spring in the depths of winter."</p>

<p>The following day, the weary Oglethorpe and his companions
landed on this island, where there was a thanksgiving, and when
John was again excited by the lesson, in particular by the lines
"It is I, be not afraid."</p>

<p>Oglethorpe then took a boat to Savannah, leaving the others to
return on board the <i>Simmonds</i> anchored in the river, and
returning the next day with a Moravian parson, Spangenberg, a new
personality for John Wesley to investigate.</p>

<p>He at once accosted the German, who looked very
impressive&mdash;asking, as a formality, however, advice about his
own conduct.</p>

<p>The Moravian replied: "My brother, I must first ask you one or
two questions. Have you the witness within yourself? Does the
spirit of God bear witness in your spirit that you are a child of
God?"</p>

<p>The "inward witness": those were the words the dying Rector of
Epworth had used. John Wesley was taken aback; he was so used to
questioning others that he knew not what to say when others
questioned him.</p>

<p>Observing his amazement, the Moravian asked: "Do you know Jesus
Christ?"</p>

<p>Again Wesley was at a loss, but at last replied: "I know He is
the Saviour of the world."</p>

<p>The Moravian insisted: "But do <i>you</i> know He has saved
<i>you?"</i></p>

<p>John replied: "I hope He died to save me."</p>

<p>The Moravian, evidently not satisfied, asked: "Do you know
<i>yourself?"</i></p>

<p>John Wesley said: "I do." But he felt in his heart that these
were but vain words, revealing as it were the darkness of his own
uncertainty and bewilderment.</p>

<p>What! Was he not yet on the right path? Did all his zeal, all
his methods, all his purging himself of pride and philosophy not
suffice? He began to carry the warfare into the enemy's camp, and
he attacked the Moravian with questions about his own spiritual
state and the settlement at Herrnhut.</p>

<p>In return for this questioning, Mr. Spangenberg gave his own
history, from the time that he had learned at the University of
Jena the philosophy that he was now trying to forget, till the
moment he came to Georgia; John was still not satisfied and asked
curiously: "Where will you go next?"</p>

<p>The Moravian said he thought about going to Pennsylvania, but
added some words the spirit of which the Englishman did not
understand: "But what God will do with me, I know not. I am blind;
I am a child; my Father knows that I am ready to go whenever He
calls."</p>

<p>A few days later there was an even more exciting encounter. Old
Tomochichi, with his nephew and some women and children, came on
board the <i>Simmonds</i> accompanied by a Mrs. Musgrove, the
half-caste wife of a trader, who acted as an interpreter. The
Indians were all comely, gentle, well-behaved people, and John's
keen eyes lit with joy at the prospect of converting them; he began
at once on this tremendous topic.</p>

<p>The old chief was, as ever, tactful: he was glad that the
missionaries had arrived; he would speak to them about the wise men
of his nation; he wanted to be taught Christianity, not merely to
be baptized as the Spaniards did when they converted people,
without any explanation of what the rite meant.</p>

<p>John assumed a tone of forced humility; he did not know if it
was God's wish that the Indians should be converted through him, he
said, but in his heart he knew that he meant to make the attempt;
the interview ended by the Indian women's presenting the
missionaries with a jar of milk and a jar of honey, symbolic of
what they hoped would be pleasant dealing between them.</p>

<p>Soon after the four Methodists took boat to Savannah, where they
were cheered by hearing Oglethorpe give directions to build a
church immediately; they found that this little town consisted of
log buildings, the most important of which were a court-house, a
prison, a store-house, a public mill for grinding corn, and a
residence for the governor; round this were grouped log huts all of
the same size, a parcel of land for a house and garden within the
township, and some acres of land outside for farming, being
allotted to each settler. Living was on a humble, even a rude
scale&mdash;a coat, a musket, some tools and kitchen utensils had
been given by the Trustees to each emigrant, while they were
clearing and breaking the land and beginning their farming
experiments; they were allowed annually liberal rations of beef,
pork, Indian porn or peas, meal, coffee, cheese, butter, spice,
sugar, vinegar, salt, a pint of beer a day, cotton, thread, and
soap.</p>

<p>The forty huts in Savannah formed the largest settlement; a
hundred miles away was Frederica; eighty miles away the Scottish
Highlanders had settled at Darien, while there were small groups of
huts near to the capital, New Ebenezer, nineteen miles away,
Highgate and Hampstead four or five miles southwards, and
Thunderbolt six miles southwards; the last consisted of only three
families, the others of fourteen or ten. In between these white
settlements the majestic country, inhabited only by wandering
tribes of Choctaws, Chicataws, and Cherokees, lay luxuriant and
sumptuous in its primeval beauty; the Indians dwelt in what they
termed wigwams. The warriors lived in idleness and the women did
the necessary work, John was told; they were very docile save when
they got too much rum; but he had other work at hand for them. The
English colony consisted of seven hundred souls, and John Wesley
considered himself the pastor of all these people, not merely of
the inhabitants of Savannah.</p>

<p>The previous clergyman, a Mr. Quincy, had now gone to Carolina,
and the four Methodists were the only spiritual teachers the
English had. Mr. Quincy's wooden hut served them as a residence and
guesthouse, and they were soon installed.</p>

<p>In the court-house John began on March 7 his ministry by
preaching a sermon in which he gave a lively picture of his
father's death-bed; his spirits had soon recovered from the
exasperating troubles of the voyage, and he wrote to his
mother:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">We are like to stay here for some months, the
place is pleasant beyond imagination, exceedingly healthful. I have
not had a moment's illness of any kind since I set my foot upon the
continent. Many of them are, I believe, very angry already, for a
gentleman no longer than last night made a ball to begin about the
same time (March 17), but the public prayers happening the church
was full and the ballroom so empty that the entertainment could not
go forward.</p>

<p><br>
This drawing of people away from another person's show to his
own was, however, John hoped, but the beginning of his achievement,
and he petitioned Oglethorpe to allow him to travel at once into
the wild Indian country to attempt to convert the savages. This,
after all, was his main object in coming to America; the white
people's salvation was merely but by the way.</p>

<p>But the Governor refused; he wished, above all things, to keep
on good terms with the Indians, and he feared that any meddling
might antagonize them. He had made them promises that they should
not be molested, and he did not know in what spirit they might take
the ministrations of the Methodists, since they had already shown
themselves extremely hostile to the Spanish and French priests,
many of whom they had beaten, tortured, and burnt.</p>

<p>On May 7, 1736, John Wesley opened his ministry in Savannah with
the unalterable intention of putting into practice all the
unfaltering obedience to the Rubrics and Canon law he had employed
in Epworth and Oxford; if he could not immediately reach the
Indians he could, at least, he believed, found in the new colony a
replica of the Church of the Primitive Christians; surely that
would please God and bring a blessing on himself?</p>

<p>He resolved to achieve his end by means of the rules and methods
he had learned from Susanna Wesley when he was a child, then to be
put into practice without mercy on himself or others. The greatest
attention was to be paid to the letter of the law. None was to be
admitted to the Lord's table without previous notice, trine
immersion was to be used for such infants as could endure it.
Nonconformists and Quakers&mdash;of whom there were several among
the settlers&mdash;who desired to use the Church were to be
rebaptized into the Anglican faith; the morning service was divided
into two parts. There were house-to-house visits, prayers,
exhortation, and chastisements on the model of the late Rector of
Epworth's ministry. In brief, the medley of colonists, none of
them, save the Moravians, of the best material, were exposed to a
spiritual drive from the Wesleys that they soon found as galling as
the sharp restrictions laid on them by the Trustees and the
stinging disappointments that most of them had experienced in
Georgia.</p>

<p>There were soon many protests, but John Wesley was unremitting
in his zeal; more than ever before he exaggerated his virtues into
vices. Living on bread and water, sleeping on the ground, toiling
from morning to night, cutting his rest down to the minimum, he
lost all sense of proportion and even of human values; he was
absorbed in discipline, self-sufficiency, self-complacency, and a
censorious interference with the affairs of others. Priding himself
on his candour, he not only rebuked his parishioners from the
pulpit and openly to their faces, but told them frankly what each
had said of the other&mdash;a method of sincerity that led to
incalculable mischief.</p>

<p>The circumstances in which the young don found himself in
Georgia were very strange; he could not adapt himself to them, and
perhaps, for all his levelheadedness, they somewhat affected him.
There was a strange quality in the atmosphere of the New World and
a tinge of hysteria or even lunacy seemed to mark the acts of many
of those who found themselves in these odd situations in this alien
country. To begin with, there were very material grievances on the
part of the colonists. Pioneer work had proved heavy, discomforts
extreme, and milk and honey had not yet flowed in this promised
land. Many of the English paupers were town men and could not
endure a life of husbandry. Many were idle, worthless, or even
criminal; there were soon stocks and whipping-posts outside the
little court-house in Savannah. Some settlers made off to Carolina,
where 5,000 white men employed 30,000 or 40,000 black slaves, and
rum was to be had. It was complained that Mr. Causton,
unaccountably the friend and even favourite of Oglethorpe, who had
appointed him chief magistrate of Savannah, was a corrupt tyrant,
who meted out injustice with an arrogance and an insolence worthy
of Lord Jeffreys. Then the climate was not what it had been
represented to be in the well-written pamphlets that the Trustees
had distributed so freely in England; the winter cold was longer,
the summer heat fiercer than the emigrants had expected. Nor was it
as easy to make the desert blossom like the rose as it had seemed
to these poor wretches when dreaming of Utopia in a London slum.
They declared that it was impossible for a family to get a living
out of the allotment of fifty acres of fertile land; besides, much
of the land was not fertile but "pine-barren." They did not like
living in the palmetto huts or log houses, and they greatly
resented Oglethorpe's tactics towards the Indians, who, the English
declared, were a set of lazy vagabonds, living in idleness on the
bounty of the Trustees, and doing nothing in return. The colonists
suspected, and it seemed with some reason, that the Redskins with
whom Oglethorpe had made the treaty were not responsible
chieftains, representing the powerful tribes who had their
settlements and villages inland, but a mere band of wandering
outlawed vagrants, and the English much resented gifts of rum made
to the savages while they were forced to remain permanently
sober.</p>

<p>The Indians had, despite their indifferent courtesy, an equally
poor opinion of the settlers. They told John when, arrayed in full
canonicals, he tried to preach Christianity to them during their
cadging visits to Savannah, that the Christians were no better than
themselves as far as stealing, quarrelling, and drunkenness went,
and they outlined, with good-humoured contempt for the white man's
earnestness, their own easy faith in the Supreme Being who dwelt
above and rewarded men according to their merits.</p>

<p>John could not be satisfied with this vague theology, and called
a conference of such of the Indian chiefs as could be got hold of.
Through an interpreter, and after dinner with the harassed
Oglethorpe, John keenly questioned the savages, asking them what
they thought they were made for, and giving them priceless truths
in simple infantile language such as: "If red men will read the
good book, they may know as much as white men."</p>

<p>It was a long and rather tedious parley, and the Indians, drowsy
with Oglethorpe's drink and tobacco, could be got to say little
more than: "We do not know, we cannot tell."</p>

<p>Theirs was a simple religion indeed, and could be improved upon
by few and refuted by none; they believed that there were four
Beloved Entities above&mdash;the clouds, the sun, the clear sky,
and He that lived in the clear sky. When in battle with the French
or in other trouble, they heard these Beloved Ones, like the noise
of drums and guns and shouting and encouraging them, frightening
their foes away. They thought of these Beloved Ones always,
wherever they were. They talked of them and to them at home and
abroad, in peace, in war, before and after they fought, whenever
they met together. They believed in spirits, they believed that the
spectres of the departed walked up and down near the place where
they died, or where their bodies lay. John also believed in ghosts,
but he drew a nice distinction. "Our belief is that the souls of
bad men only walk up and down; those of good men go up." There the
matter had to be left. John Wesley was disappointed and rather
confused; he began to be disillusioned with the savages; he could
not credit that their mythology was as harmless as they made it
sound; a Frenchman from New Orleans had some horrible stories of
the Redskins' methods of torturing and slaying their enemies that
made John think that the Beloved Ones were in reality Devils. He
forgot that in Christian England men were pressed to death, women
burnt alive, and children hanged, and that the shocking orgies held
by the Indians&mdash;in one village all the warriors were said to
have perished of rum-drinking owed their inspiration to the fiery
poison introduced by people whose drunkenness was notorious in
Europe. The lively young evangelist soon regained his high spirits;
after all, he was not really interested in the Indians, but only in
his own soul, and it was refreshing to turn to those of his
parishioners on whom he was having a powerful effect&mdash;for
instance, those who were very ill, like the younger Miss Bovey, who
was converted while suffering from the prickly heat, and who, "just
after they had done drinking tea," was "bled about an ounce, leaned
back and died." John would hardly believe that the girl was dead,
she looked so radiant; he had never seen "so beautiful a corpse,"
but this, he reflected, was "poor comfort to the late
inhabitant."</p>

<p>This sudden death of the young maiden filled him with disturbing
thoughts; that night a storm broke out over Savannah such as John
had never known before even in Georgia, and while the thunder
rolled among the hills and the lightning was incessant above the
palmetto huts, John knew fear again, and realized that he had no
real wish "to be dissolved and to be with Christ."</p>

<p>He was humbled and distressed, especially as further interviews
with the Indians proved fruitless, but his courage revived and he
turned vigorously to more malleable material, suggesting that the
more serious of his little flock should form themselves into a sort
of society and meet once or twice a week in order to reprove,
instruct, and report to one another. But he met with unexpected
opposition; some people would not, for one thing, consent to have
their children dipped at baptism; then there were the public
prayers arranged according to the original appointments of the
Church, at five and eleven in the morning, at three in the
afternoon, with evening prayer, the whole linked together by
house-to-house visits; this was, the colonists thought, far too
much piety for the working day. These High Church practices, too,
were taken for popery by many of the people, and the murmurs
against the Wesleys began to swell; but Oglethorpe remained their
friend, and so did his lieutenant, Thomas Causton. It was largely
through class feeling that the aristocratic soldier stood by the
four Methodists. James Oglethorpe knew John Wesley to be a
gentleman, a scholar, and a Christian priest, and therefore
considered that he ought to know what to do and left him,
unfortunately, to do it. With even more disastrous results he did
not interfere with Thomas Causton, the storekeeper, who had, oddly
enough, obtained his complete confidence; Spangenberg went to
Pennsylvania; his cool, disinterested advice might have saved the
Wesleys from some of the troubles that now involved them, but it is
unlikely that the Englishmen would have taken warning even from the
impressive Moravian.</p>

<p>Within a few months the personal relations of all these people
who had landed from the <i>Simmonds</i> had become embittered,
entangled, and hysterical. To begin with, the four missionaries
were divided among themselves. Charles was continually ill, first
of a fever, now of malaria, had proved an inefficient secretary,
detesting his work, making no secret of an almost frantic
disappointment, and desiring to return home. Benjamin Ingham was
faithful but not ardent, and disagreed with John on many points.
Charles Delamotte was heartbroken at not being allowed to journey
into the wilds to convert the Indians, and confined himself to
acting as John's lieutenant. John had fallen readily into the traps
set for him by idle, malicious, and sensual young women. Mrs.
Hawkins, the pretty wife of the surgeon, had marked him down on the
voyage, when she had squeezed his hand, cast up her eyes, and
declared that she had found the spiritual friend she had been
looking for since childhood. He had been warned against her by
everyone, including Charles, but he refused to listen. How indeed
could he listen? His work, his most urgent work, was to save souls.
Hell's flames crackled as fiercely under the earth's surface in the
New World as they had done in the Old, and how should John Wesley
rescue either his own soul or those of others from them if he paid
any attention to warnings against voluptuous young women, who might
be hypocritical? So he refused to listen to a word against either
Mrs. Hawkins or her equally frivolous friend, Mrs. Welsh, or any of
the other women who made up the female gentility of Savannah, and
encouraged their flamboyant displays of piety.</p>

<p>James Oglethorpe&mdash;a handsome prize for any woman&mdash;and
the four Methodists were the only attractive and important men in
the colony; Benjamin Ingham was remarkably handsome, John
fascinating, Charles Delamotte emotional, young, and soft; the
women, headed by Mrs. Hawkins, bored by the savage country and the
rude life, determined to make havoc with soldier, priest, disciple
alike.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>
SOPHIE HOPKEY.</h2>

<p class="first">
FROM the moment that the four young and unmarried gentlemen had
arrived in Savannah they had been the objects of petty, sordid
gossip; the respectable people were censorious and the disreputable
ready to think the worst. Too many thunderstorms and too much
religion had brought everyone into a state of high nervous tension;
the women were maddened by John's pose of stiff, smiling
saintliness, the peevish virtue of Charles, who was ill and
unhappy, the aloofness of Ingham, who knew his value, and the lofty
indifference of Oglethorpe, who seemed to think of nothing but his
maps and his fort at Frederica, which was quite professional, with
its earthen ramparts, palisaded ditches, mounted with cannon that
commanded the river.</p>

<p>Beata Hawkins was a wanton and a virago and, well supported by
her friend Mrs. Welsh, resolved to ensnare Oglethorpe, known not to
be entirely impervious to feminine charms, and to involve the
exasperating young clergymen as well as in some amorous drama.</p>

<p>As they laid their plans they fluttered closely round the
Wesleys, with cries of contrition, with sobs of repentance, with
moist looks of sisterly love; their billowing muslins and palm-leaf
hats tied coquettishly with coloured ribbons filled the courthouse
when John preached, and they gracefully invaded the minister's
house, to make and drink tea, to borrow books, to tell tales of
backsliders, to ask for spiritual advice&mdash;Mr. Wesley was so
clever, he could even interpret dreams, and very curious dreams
visited some of these ladies.</p>

<p>Ingham was too blinded by self-complacency and Oglethorpe too
disdainful to see the emotional tangle they were all becoming
involved in, so the warnings of Charles and Delamotte were
unheeded; the more so as John, indeed, rather enjoyed his delicate
relations with these charming young women, who groaned over their
sins at his feet, pressed his hand while he read holy books to
them, and in their most becoming gowns and caps were punctual at
the Communion table.</p>

<p>Among these dangerous women was one who disturbed him with a
peculiar and painful pleasure: Sophie Hopkey, the niece of Thomas
Causton's wife, who resided with the unpopular couple in the
principal house of Savannah. She was young, charming, simple, and
pious, much perturbed by a thwarted love affair with one of her
uncle's clerks, a man named Thomas Mellichamp, who threatened
violence if she gave her hand to anyone else, and kept her in a
state of delicious agitation. Causton and his wife, seeing that the
girl, indeed, did not know her own mind, and wishing to fortify her
against this undesirable suitor, put her in the spiritual charge of
John, who besides gave her lessons in French. Soon she came every
day to the minister's house, her books under her arm, her face
composed to gravity. She was submissive, amiable, and used many
subtle forms of flattery; she had asked James Oglethorpe how John
Wesley liked to see women dressed, and when the soldier replied:
"In white dresses," Sophie Hopkey began to appear for her daily
instruction in flowing gowns of spotless muslin that gave her fair,
fragile look an angelic appearance.</p>

<p>The restless girl had told her teacher that she was not happy
with the Caustons, that she did not want to marry Mellichamp, and
that she was not at all sure of her eternal salvation, and he tried
to help her with all these problems, fascinated himself by the
delicious and delicate relationship&mdash;the religious teacher and
the seductive female disciple.</p>

<p>Sophie Hopkey was not, however, an easy pupil; she hesitated in
her confessions, sometimes she retracted them. She wept for no
reason at all; her precise feelings as regards Mellichamp could not
be ascertained.</p>

<p>John patiently read to her the book that was his favourite
panacea for most human woes&mdash;William Law's <i>Christian
Perfection</i>&mdash;but Sophie was not con soled. John was
perilously interested in and ingeniously baffled by her state of
mind and encouraged her daily visits, took the greatest interest in
her welfare and was perfectly oblivious of the watchful eyes upon
them in their walks together, of the smirks and winks of some of
the most ill-conditioned of his parishioners, when the fair Sophie
glided to the foremost pew in the new-built church, where the young
priest, with his precise neat figure, smoothly curled auburn locks
and upcast eyes, spoke of the horrors of Hell-fire in his moving
and penetrating tones.</p>

<p>This enticing and difficult intimacy with Sophie Hopkey that
gave a touch of brilliant hallucination to the hot days so often
broken by thunderstorms was cut across by a most unexpected
misfortune.</p>

<p>There was a desperate summons from Charles in Frederica; not
only was he ill and unpopular, and not only had he quarrelled with
almost everybody in the little township, but he had become the
central figure of a shocking scandal that had cost him the
friendship and even the respect of James Oglethorpe. It was the
handsome Ingham, travelling hastily and perilously, who had brought
this bad news, and he added details to Charles's letters that
decided John to start at once to his brother's rescue.</p>

<p>There were discomforts and perils on the voyage; a plague of
sand-flies covered the flat-bottomed
barge&mdash;periagua&mdash;that conveyed John and the faithful
Delamotte up the river, and then a violent storm and contrary winds
sent the water over the boat and nearly drowned the harassed
missionary. True to his custom, however, he opened his Bible and
read "If God be for us, who can be against us?" and felt greatly
cheered even amid the blue chain-lightning that flashed out of the
darkness and the thunder. When John reached Frederica he found
Charles prostrate with shock and a flux. Undaunted by the hostile
atmosphere in the little town, John, the first Sunday after his
arrival, preached on the challenging text: "Which of you convinceth
me of sin? And if I say truth, why do ye not believe me?" There was
a large but inimical congregation; John listened to Charles's
story, stayed six days, then returned to Savannah to think over the
strange tale; Charles, barely recovered, followed him; as
Frederica, that godless place, was yet without a pastor, John and
Ingham decided to undertake that difficult cure, and John went
first, again being nearly drowned on the way; matters looked black
for the brothers; Oglethorpe was at the fort, in a furious temper,
report said, seeing no one but the engineer, while it seemed that
John was to receive the same brutal treatment as had nearly cost
Charles his life.</p>

<p>Only five people came to the first service that John held and
only twenty-five to the second, and only one family came to Holy
Communion. Wesley noted in his Journal:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">One reason why there were no more was that a
few words which a woman had inadvertently spoken had almost sent
all the town in a flame. Alas! how should a city stand that is thus
divided against itself; where there is no brotherly love, no
meekness, no forbearing or forgiving one another, but envy, malice,
revenge, suspicion, anger, clamour, bitterness, evil speaking
without end?</p>

<br>

<p>Savannah was indeed in a flame, and the situation was one to
confound even the bold energy, the clear-cut resolution of John
Wesley.</p>

<p>Charles had from the first made mistakes; his zeal had offended
the people of Frederica, as much as John's zeal had offended the
people of Savannah; his severe discipline had kept people away from
church, and he had deeply offended Mrs. Hawkins's husband by
protesting against his shooting on Sunday. Charles had, too, almost
at once fallen ill, and again had neglected his secretarial duties
with the harassed and overworked Oglethorpe; but all this was as
nothing compared with the scandal that Mrs. Hawkins and Mrs. Welsh
had contrived to arouse by a stupid piece of malice, with the sole
purpose of creating a sensational drama in which they would be the
chief actresses; this was the tangle that John, armed with his
usual self-sufficient optimism, was called upon to set right.</p>

<p>Mrs. Welsh and Mrs. Hawkins had gone together in what seemed a
mood of emotional penitence to Charles Wesley and declared that
they had both been seduced by James Oglethorpe. Before Charles had
recovered from the shock of this astounding revelation, the two
hysterical women had fluttered off to the Colonel, then absorbed in
strengthening the fort that was to protect this farthest outpost of
the Empire, and told the infuriated soldier that Charles Wesley had
succeeded in making each of them, successively, his mistress. Mrs.
Hawkins, whose husband was still in prison for shooting on a
Sunday, added the touch that Charles had accused her of being
Oglethorpe's secret lover and had spread this slander over the
town.</p>

<p>Oglethorpe had some difficulty in informing John's puritanical
modesty of the real nature of the charges and counter-charges. When
he finally, in the deepest anguish, understood these, he still
refused to believe that the two women were wholly bad; there was
some mystery&mdash;perhaps someone was possessed of devils. "God
will reveal all," he noted; but Mrs. Hawkins would not; she stormed
and Mrs. Welsh fainted, nor could John trace the slanders to their
source, or even be quite sure in his ingenuous bewilderment that
they were slanders at all. Mrs. Hawkins and Oglethorpe "seemed
innocent. Amen," he wrote in his diary.</p>

<p>It was all very difficult. One moment the distracted Oglethorpe
was civil, even friendly and soft, at another moment angry;
sometimes he seemed quite open, sometimes in a suspicious temper;
Mrs. Hawkins blustered and Mrs. Welsh fell in swoons; then the two
women would pray and promise penitence.</p>

<p>What had really happened? Was Charles guilty of some terrible
sin? Had Oglethorpe, annoyed at his prudery, put on these two
Delilahs to tempt him? John could do nothing with these feverish
complications. He had to fall back on ejaculations like: "Lord,
open my eyes!"</p>

<p>Charles recovered a measure of health and returned to Frederica,
and the two brothers stole into the virgin woods to discuss these
horrors, talking together, even there, in Greek. They believed that
their lives were not safe, that Frederica was an evil place, and
John took Charles back with him to Savannah, leaving the two female
mischief-makers to face the storm they had brewed themselves and
the angry soldier to his interrupted Empire-building. He was still
not on speaking terms with the younger brother, whom he now
believed to be a smug hypocrite.</p>

<p>John and Charles took up their work in Savannah, where they
soothed their outraged feelings by strict discipline, harassing
their rebellious congregation, hymn-writing and hymn-singing, and
attendance at several edifying death-beds; but Charles was still
far from well and John far from satisfied. The younger brother had
been deeply grieved and shocked by the scandal in Frederica; John
had been scandalized too, so much that Oglethorpe had scarcely been
able to discuss the matter with him. At the same time he was
fascinated by the sordid drama, his intense curiosity played in
lively fashion round these strange aspects of human nature, and he
still hoped to make an attempt to convert those two disturbing
women, Mrs. Welsh and Mrs. Hawkins.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was Sophie close at hand, tripping in her
flowing white muslin every day to the minister's house, to sit with
her head drooping over holy books, to listen attentively to
lectures and prayers, to smile a little, and to weep a little as
she discussed her troubles, domestic and spiritual. Then in the
blazing full heat of the summer Charles felt it his duty to go to
Frederica again, and to see if he could make his peace with
Oglethorpe; but it was hopeless. Charles was too shaken&mdash;mind,
body, and soul&mdash;to plead his own cause, and again John had to
go to the southern outpost, this time to arrange for Charles's
departure to England and to take over his secretarial duties.
Moreover, still tormented with a desire to force these strange
people into his way of thinking, he tried once more to straighten
out the tangle caused by these two incomprehensible women. He was
met by a fresh scandal. In a letter to John, Charles had described
the two ladies in two forcible Greek words, and Mr. Hawkins had
stolen the letter from the post-bag and showed it to his wife, whom
he somewhat oddly championed.</p>

<p>No one in Frederica knew Greek, but there was a strong suspicion
that though John had been so chaste as scarcely to understand this
lewd story, which Beata Hawkins had spread, Charles was
worldly-wise enough to have accurately described the character of
the two ladies, who, though they had passionately accused
themselves of adultery, were still very nice about their
reputations.</p>

<p>It was clear to John that Charles must be got to England, for
little help was forthcoming from Oglethorpe, but, while Charles was
being packed off, John might investigate the exciting affair of the
wretched Mrs. Hawkins; therefore, under the excuse of fetching a
concoction of bark for his brother and quite eager for the battle,
John visited the surgeon's house.</p>

<p>The angry Beata flounced at once into the parlour and demanded
what the two Greek words meant, declaring that all the women of
Frederica felt themselves insulted thereby, for a very shrewd guess
at their significance seems to have got abroad.</p>

<p>With his usual devastating candour, John replied mildly that the
ladies of Frederica need not feel offended, since the two words
applied only to Mrs. Welsh and Mrs. Hawkins; he added that he was
not responsible for his brother's opinion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hawkins was not in a mood to hear this reasonable protest,
and she threw herself into one of her vigorous tantrums, screaming
out that the clergyman was "a villain, a scoundrel, and a pitiful
rascal." Her voice roused her bully of a husband, who, perhaps on a
preconcerted signal, came in, and he too began to abuse John
Wesley, who had to endure as best he could the reward of the
meddling would-be peacemaker.</p>

<p>"I suppose that Charles Wesley meant me by those damned words,"
shouted the enraged lady, while her husband supported her with:
"Did he indeed! We will unfrock the pair of them!"</p>

<p>John left the house of Beata Hawkins without, it may be
supposed, his concoction of bark; he was deeply disturbed, for
never before had this dainty and fastidious-minded man had personal
contact with a vulgar virago. He hastened to Oglethorpe, but was
coldly received; the soldier's temper was tending to become
uncertain under the harassing strains of his position. It seemed at
this time as if the scheme, in both its patriotic and philanthropic
aspect, was likely to be a failure. Apart from the tiresome scandal
raised by Mrs. Hawkins, Causton was causing great trouble in
Savannah; Oglethorpe found him useful and continued to support him,
but his insolence and tyrannies were rapidly becoming unsupportable
to the other colonists. This man had left England because of some
fraud on the Revenue, and was not unreasonably termed a renegade
from justice. He had, however, sufficient address to impose himself
on Oglethorpe, and to display himself with his guard of six
freeholders armed with bayonets, as the little tyrant of the
"molehill empire"; the governor, gloomy and lonely in his outpost
fort, had other troubles besides complaints about Causton and the
pesterings of Beata Hawkins. The enterprise had inevitably cost
more than was expected, and he had, as Governor of Georgia, drawn
large drafts for money that the Trustees had honoured only with
alarm and protest. Indignant letters from London accused him of
something like maladministration and misappropriation of funds, and
he was now debating whether he should go to England to put these
matters right and also to try to persuade the King to give him some
regiments with which to protect his naked frontiers. The fort of
Frederica was in reality on Spanish territory, and the Spanish
colonists were not only complaining but arming. James Oglethorpe,
in these circumstances, had very little time for Mrs. Hawkins.</p>

<p>Oglethorpe therefore tried to smooth over the tiresome, petty
affair by suggesting to John that he leave the Hawkinses entirely
alone. But Beata Hawkins did not intend to be left alone; somehow
or other, after the manner of her kind, she intended to involve all
those men in emotional relations to herself.</p>

<p>The next day she sent for John Wesley, and as she was one of his
communicants he felt it his duty to go, for was she not a lamb of
his flock, even though her fleece was soiled and caught in a
thicket of briar? Besides, he had his keen nosing curiosity to goad
him on. So he walked under the blue Georgian sky between the
palmetto huts to the apothecary's residence, and ventured into the
presence of the termagant, hoping to find her in that mood of
melting penitence which she had often treated him to before. She
sent out a message to him by a servant declaring that she was ill,
and so he was bidden up into her bedroom. He found her standing
with her hands behind her; white with malicious rage she cried out:
"Sir, you have wronged me, and I will shoot you through the head at
this moment with a brace of balls."</p>

<p>She then presented a pistol at the clergyman's head and with the
other hand brandished a pair of large scissors. John boldly threw
himself upon her, grasping her by the two wrists. A scene as
disgraceful as ludicrous then followed; Wesley, though in good
condition and wiry, was a small man, and he was not able to disarm
immediately the hysterical woman. They fell on to the bed embraced
in a struggle together, while Beata was cursing and swearing and
screaming out: "Villain, dog, let go my hands!"</p>

<p>She declared that she would either cut off his long auburn locks
or have his heart's blood. Not wishing this disgraceful scene to be
noised abroad, Wesley tried to master the woman, but in vain. Even
the entry of an alarmed servant did not quiet the mistress, who
commanded the girl, on pain of death, to bring her a knife that she
might make an end of the hypocritical parson. The maid's clamour,
however, brought not only Mr. Hawkins but a passing constable into
the house. The scene then became one of confused violence in which
Wesley was overwhelmed. Hawkins wanted to know what the scoundrel
Wesley was doing in his house, and vehemently supported his wife.
He commanded the bewildered constable not to touch Beata, who had
now lost grip of the pistol and was still trying to snip the sleek
hair off John's head.</p>

<p>On her husband's managing to overpower her and to drag her off,
she set her teeth into the clergyman's cassock and tore the sleeves
of the garment to pieces. Exhausted and humiliated, Wesley went
again to Oglethorpe, who wearily advised him to pass over the
outrage, dwelling on such truisms as the necessity of some
appearance of concord among the colonists, the troubles and
vexatious scandals that had already split Frederica, and that
satisfaction would be given to the enemies of both Wesley and
Oglethorpe if this trouble were made public. So John, for the
soldier's sake, and perhaps a little for his own, agreed to a
truce, the main article of which was that he and the Hawkins couple
should never speak to each other again, and Wesley at last agreed
to obey the Governor of the colony and have no more to do with the
dangerous Beata. Charles Wesley, half-disillusioned and broken in
health, sailed for England under the excuse of taking a report to
the Trustees, but really because he could no longer endure America
and because he had made a failure of the work he had undertaken,
while John promised to divide his time between Oglethorpe at
Frederica and his flock at Savannah, regardless, as always, of
fatigue and toil and the perilous hundred-mile journey between the
two places.</p>

<p>When he returned to Savannah he had an unpleasant shock; the
Nonconformist minister who had taken his place had lapsed from all
the practices that Wesley had established; the congregations were
full of backsliders, and Wesley found himself even more unpopular
than he had been before, and yet Savannah was a godly place
compared to Frederica, where one of his congregation, expressing
the feelings of the majority, had said to him: "I like nothing you
do. All your sermons are satires on particular persons. Besides, we
are Protestants, and as for you, we cannot tell which religion you
are of. We have never heard of such a religion before, and we know
not what to make of it. And then your private behaviour, all the
quarrels that have been here since your arrival have been because
of you, and there is neither man nor woman in the town who minds a
word you say."</p>

<p>John Wesley, however, doggedly went his way; he and Delamotte
read together, discussed Dr. Beveridge's works on Church
government, John began a library, continued expounding and praying,
singing and writing, French lessons with Sophie Hopkey.</p>

<p>John now found himself deeply involved with her, and all his
other troubles were as nothing compared to this&mdash;he had fallen
in love with her, as far as it was in his nature to fall in love
with anyone. But he had long since determined to remain
celibate&mdash;"to go naked to Christ," as he termed it&mdash;and
he dreaded the snare that might lie in a warm pleasant domestic
life, the cosy fireside, the loving wife, and affectionate
children.</p>

<p>He was pledged to one master, God; to one task, to save his own
soul and those of other people. He would long since have entirely
disengaged himself from Sophie, but she had assured him that she
had no wish to marry, that she too considered a single life the
better part, and he was simple enough to believe this, or
disingenuous enough to pretend that he believed it.</p>

<p>When he was on one of his visits to Savannah she was sent after
him by Causton, who hoped that Oglethorpe, then at the Fort, would
be able to persuade this reluctant lover to come to a decision.
Sophie stayed with a friend in Frederica and told John that she had
left Savannah because she was miserable with the
Caustons&mdash;almost, in fact, homeless; the French lessons were
resumed, and John's love for the gentle creature increased to an
alarming extent; he tore himself away and returned to Savannah,
trying to come to a decision himself by sounding Causton, who said
pointedly: "The girl will never be easy till she is married."</p>

<p>John was shocked by this downright and true statement, and
replied that Sophie was far too afflicted, as to both her worldly
position and the state of her soul, to think of marriage. Causton
replied: "I give her up to you; do what you will with her, take her
into your own hands, promise her what you will, and I will make it
good."</p>

<p>Wesley now had a free hand to put himself forward as a husband
for the girl. Causton's "I will make it good" meant that Sophie's
husband would be received into the house and farm, one of the
finest in the colony, to which Sophie was heiress. John said
nothing, but returned to Frederica, where he was amazed to find
everyone, including Sophie, had relapsed; evening and morning
prayer had been discontinued, and the young lady's good resolutions
had vanished away: she was languid, distracted, and talked vaguely
of returning to England.</p>

<p>John was agitated and alarmed into saying a great deal, but not
what the girl was hoping for&mdash;a proposal of marriage; he read
to her what he thought the most affecting part of some serious
books, but Sophie did not seem to listen. The harassed young woman
wanted to marry John; she believed that he loved her and she knew
that everyone was expecting this marriage, and there was no
obstacle to it. She had almost proposed to him herself, going as
far as the limits of her modesty and her inexperience allowed. But
still he would not declare himself, though she could not admit that
she had made a mistake about his feelings. Her amorous manner
surprised and discouraged Wesley, who noted in his Journal: "I soon
re-collected my spirits and remembered my calling."</p>

<p>Oglethorpe returned to Frederica from the Fort, when Wesley
thought him cold, and said somewhat petulantly to Miss Hopkey:
"Now, Miss Sophie, you may go to England, for I can assist you no
longer; my interest is gone."</p>

<p>The young lady declared that she would not stir a foot. What,
then, was to become of her? The Governor appealed to John on this
point and, as tired of the parson as of the girl, said "She had
better go home," and added that she could go in "no one's charge
but yours, for indeed there is none so proper."</p>

<p>Still Wesley did not declare himself, and Sophie, pressed almost
beyond endurance, burst into tears and declared that she would not
return to the Caustons at Savannah. John then repeated her
guardian's words: "You have only to make your own terms. Your uncle
engaged himself to make good whatever I should promise you."</p>

<p>He committed himself no further; he was still, out of either
hypocrisy or stupidity, relying on her declaration that she wished
to die an old maid, yet he saw the snare: the long voyage together
on the boat and they the only passengers:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">I had a good hope that I would be delivered
out of the danger, because it was not my choice which brought me
into it, because I still felt in myself the same desire and design
to live a single life, because I was persuaded should my desire and
design be changed, yet her resolution to live single would
continue.</p>

<br>

<p>Yet this cool resolve flickered and almost wavered, his selfish
complacency was almost burnt away, for he was in love, and far more
deeply disturbed than he had been by either Varanese or Aspasia;
besides, with those delicate and difficult ladies he had always
been kept at arm's length, now he and this simple and loving girl
were thrown into each other's intimate company. John had lately
been reading the mystics; he had decided to reject them utterly,
yet they had a little confused and unsettled him, and proved in
their way a spiritual temptation, as Sophie Hopkey was proving a
fleshly one; so all his being was excited and disturbed, as he took
the dainty creature in his charge on the slow-moving, flat-bottomed
barge.</p>

<p>He was face to face with what he had never experienced before, a
definite temptation, and one that seemed to him almost gross,
almost of the Devil, though he was chaste and high-minded; though
he loved her with his spirit and his heart and his mind, he did
love her also "after the flesh." Before he had sailed for Georgia
he had written a letter to his brother Samuel bidding him banish
all the classics from his school and introduce in their place
Christian authors. The boys at Blundell's, as he remarked
pertinently, were as much heathens as the Indians whom he himself
hoped to convert, and he warned Samuel, already sufficiently
priggish, against "the classics usually read in great schools, many
of them tending to inflame the lusts of the flesh, and more to feed
the lusts of the eye and the pride of life."</p>

<p>He was in danger of these temptations himself as the
flat-bottomed barge moved slowly down the wide river between the
banks luxuriant with the flaming foliage of strange gold, crimson,
scarlet leaves and fruits, the brilliant hues of sour apples and
harsh damsons, the dusky bloom of the wild grape festooned about
the stem of pine and cypress that rose dark against the azure sky.
Sophie was so docile, so delicate in her white muslin frock beneath
the wayfarer's cloak, with her charming enticing face, daintily
banded hair, childish profile and exquisite folded hands, that
almost she succeeded in making him forget his
obsessions&mdash;Hell, damnation, his own soul; almost the bitter
teachings of Epworth passed out of his agitated mind and he became,
not a fanatic but a normal young man. He tried to fortify himself
behind holy books. He read aloud Fleury's <i>History of the
Church,</i> and expounded to the anxious Sophie, as they sat on the
deck together, the glorious examples of truth and patience in the
suffering of the ancient saints, "who resisted unto blood striving
against sin."</p>

<p>At night the boat was moored. Crew and passengers landed and
slept on patches of open ground, between the pungently fragrant
shrubs, their only mattress a sail pegged over the coarse grass.
The wind was keen and sharp from the east, but the patient girl
complained of nothing, as wrapped in her cloak she lay down between
the clergyman and the servants and slept, or seemed to sleep,
beneath the stars, "as if on a bed of down." One windy, starlit
night when they were lying on the sail cloth, the sleeping servant
between them, he could not close his eyes. Raising himself on his
elbow, he looked at the pale girl, also wide awake, who lay
pillowed on her folded shawl, the glow of the light from the camp
fire flickering over her childish face; he had meant to resist her,
but now the words that she wanted him to speak broke from him: "I
should think myself very happy if I were to spend my life with
you."</p>

<p>Sophie sobbed with relief, hoping to hear more, longing for some
lover-like endearment. If she had been a more experienced woman she
would have responded to his timid overture passionately, and might
have swept him out of his icy inhibitions. But being a nervous,
overwrought, simple girl, she began to weep and muttered something
about Tom Mellichamp, who had threatened any man who tried to marry
her, and foolishly begged John to speak no more of the matter,
hoping all the while that he would do so and with increased ardour,
but again and fatally John took her at her word: he became silent,
a little relieved that his temptations had been snatched away.</p>

<p>But John Wesley had not escaped entirely from the effects of the
enchanted voyage. He was still tormentingly in love with Sophie;
nor had she lost all hope. She came daily to the minister's house
for the French lessons and the devotional reading, and the little
town gossiped, winked, and nodded, while John Wesley, as he
admitted, began to be much afraid of the girl, for his desire and
design were still to live single, but how long he could resist he
did not know.</p>

<p>For several months the agonizing relationship continued, until
the young man could no longer control himself, and let slip, on an
impulse, another halfhearted proposal. The girl, wishing to urge
him into a more direct disclosure, replied that she thought it was
best for clergymen not to be cumbered with worldly cares, and it
was best for her, too, to remain single, and that accordingly she
had resolved never to marry. The protestations that she had hoped
for did not come; John was silent. Upon reflection he again thought
this a very narrow escape, but he asked the advice of a Moravian
pastor, Mr. Tltschig.</p>

<p>John Wesley's dilemma was that if he forsook Sophie he thought
that her soul would be lost, and if he remained friendly with her
he feared he would marry her. The Moravian could not see the
difficulty, and John was utterly amazed when he advised him to
marry Sophie Hopkey and have done with it; Delamotte's influence
was on the other side. He was all for celibacy, for keeping the
vows of the Holy Club, for being rid of the dangerous interruptions
of love and women. Benjamin Ingham, too, before he left for
England, had warned John against Sophie. While studying the Indian
language by means of Dr. Byron's shorthand, Ingham had come over
from his hut near the savage settlement to warn John of the danger
of these fleshly enticements, and John had been much impressed by
the admonitions of his two disciples.</p>

<p>His distress had subtle undertones. It was not merely a question
of a choice between God and Sophie Hopkey; there was his own
personal difficulty, one that he could not discuss with others or,
even, face himself; this was the shrinking of the born celibate
from marriage. All his relations with women had been delicate,
fine-spun, tinged with sentimentality, refined with religious
feeling. He liked these indefinite courtships, these tender
dallyings with submissive women who looked up to him as a holy
teacher, as a great scholar, but he did not want marriage. He
shrank from the thought of a wife as he shrank from the thought of
a mistress; he thought that for a priest marriage would be "a taint
upon the mind "&mdash;meaning, perhaps, that he considered that it
would be an indulgence of the flesh. But this aversion from the
intimacy of marriage, this wish to enjoy the company and admiration
of women while keeping them at arm's length, was not a matter of
conviction but of personal predilection.</p>

<p>His pattern of womanhood was his mother, and she had had
nineteen children; his model parish priest had been his father, and
John could never have thought that this numerous brood had
interfered with the Rector of Epworth's attention to his duties.
No; it was his own reluctance to leave a way of life that suited
him, his own dread of finding either an enervating pleasure or a
depressing disgust in this new relationship, that held him back,
even though Sophie had troubled his temperamental coldness, which
he thought a virtue too precious to be lost even in the bonds of
lawful matrimony. What he liked was the fastidious, dainty
pleasure, with a harsh relish of pain, of his present situation:
the girl dangling after him, listening to him, obeying him, nursing
him when he was ill, discussing saintly celibacy with him,
everything on the surface, all words at their face value. John
Wesley had always been willing to accept this kind of friendship
with women; it was always the women who became impatient,
irritated, and troublesome.</p>

<p>Charles Delamotte, young, hard, and narrow, taking pitiless
advantage of his friend's agitation and confusion, urged him to
decide the matter by sortilege. On three pieces of paper were
written: <i>Marry; Think not of it this year; Think of it no more.
It</i> was the last that Delamotte drew, fairly, it is to be hoped,
from the bowl. John was agonized but relieved. God had spoken.
Another lot was cast. Should John ever see Sophie again? The paper
that was drawn had written on it, "<i>only in the presence of Mr.
Delamotte."</i></p>

<p>John then resolved to give up the woman with whose affections he
had so cruelly played, whose innocent love he had so ruthlessly
sacrificed. Once when she came to see him, he was out, with a note
left for her; he had gone to wander in the woods. "I find, Miss
Sophie, I can't take fire in my bosom and not be burned."</p>

<p>The forsaken girl tried to save the scattered remnants of her
pride. One of Thomas Causton's clerks, an adventuring colonist who
had come out soon after the Wesleys, one William Williamson, was
also her suitor and not in the least afraid of either the hesitant
parson or the violent Mellichamp. To his intense astonishment and
dismay, John heard that the woman to whom he had proposed marriage
twice had accepted this young man, who in John's opinion was plain,
stupid, and irreligious. Agonized with new emotions John went to
the Caustons and found Sophie there with the new lover, who said at
once: "I suppose, sir, you know what was agreed on last night
between Miss Sophie and me?"</p>

<p>Assuming the stern air of a priest, John Wesley replied that he
could not believe this news unless he heard it from the girl
herself.</p>

<p>Then once again poor Sophie gave the man she preferred his
chance.</p>

<p>"Sir, I have given Mr. Williamson my consent unless you have
anything to object to."</p>

<p>The meaning was so plain that even Wesley saw it, but he still
hesitated, excusing himself with the reflection that if she meant,
"unless you will marry me," she would say so, she was so
sincere.</p>

<p>But all was not quite over. Desperate Sophie came once more to
the minister's house to read her devotional books, but Mr.
Williamson was walking up and down outside, and Delamotte, in
obedience to the oracle, sat in the parlour watching the frustrated
lovers, John with much agitation protesting against the proposed
match. Had not Sophie promised to ask his advice before she did
anything important?</p>

<p>The next day young Williamson met the prim clergyman on his
rounds and said to him bluntly: "Sir, you shall speak with Miss
Sophie no more until we are married. You can persuade her to
anything. After you went from the lot yesterday, she would neither
eat nor drink for two hours, but was crying continually in such an
agony she was fit for nothing."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, sir, you may be her director, but today she is to
direct herself," flashed John with intolerant scorn for a rival and
an inferior.</p>

<p>Still he would neither let the girl go nor offer for her
himself. He went to her once more, and asked her "if she were fully
determined to put the marriage through?" When she said "yes," he
told her that she was not acting upon a right motive, but was
trying to avoid her cross, and that "it would follow and overtake
her," a curious image showing distress of mind. Williamson cut
through the agonizing hesitancy, delays, and neurotic entanglements
by marrying the girl out of hand; it was exactly a year since she
had first met the four young Methodists.</p>

<p>For the first and last time John Wesley lost his head. His
slowly roused desires and passions were too powerful for his keen
intellect, his intense self-discipline; he was in love, and the
thought of the girl in the possession of another man was torment.
He raged past all control, and Delamotte, alarmed at his state,
could scarcely bring him to calm, even by reminding him that the
Voice of God had spoken by means of the bit of paper that he had
drawn out of the bowl.</p>

<p>Yes, John believed that he had obeyed the Lord, that he had done
the right thing, that he was intended for celibacy, but the anguish
was almost unendurable. Meeting Sophie out once with her husband he
could not control himself, but began to abuse her
violently&mdash;he had heard that she was still in love with Tom
Mellichamp: what right had she to play with two men? Her husband,
furious, drew Sophie away; John Wesley went home and poured out his
feelings on paper; he would show, he wrote, his friendship by
telling her painful truths:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Would you know what I dislike in your past or
present behaviour? You have always heard my thoughts as freely as
you asked them. Nay, much more freely; you know it well, and so you
shall do as long as I can speak or write. In your present behaviour
I dislike (1) your neglect of half the public service, which no man
living can compel you to; (2) your neglect of fastings, which you
once knew to be a help to the mind, without any prejudice to the
body; (3) your neglect almost of half the opportunity of
communicating which you have late had. But these things are small
in comparison with what I dislike in your past behaviour. For (1)
you told me over and over again that you had entirely conquered
your inclination to Mr. Mellichamp, yet at that very time you had
not conquered it. (2) You told me frequently you had no desire to
marry Mr. Williamson, but at the very time you spoke you had the
design. (3) In order to conceal both these things from me you went
through a course of deliberate dissimulation. Oh, how fallen! how
changed! Surely there was a time when in Miss Sophie's life there
was no guile. Own these acts and own your fault and you will be in
my thoughts as if they have never been. If you were
otherwise-minded, I should still be your friend, though I cannot
expect you should be mine.</p>

<br>

<p>The unhappy, distracted man had nothing against the woman, whom
he had lost entirely by his own fault, but such trivialities as
"neglect" in matters of public worship. But his jealousy and his
disappointment ran so high that he seized upon one of
these&mdash;her omission to say that she was coming to partake of
Holy Communion on a certain day&mdash;to refuse her admission to
the Communion table, a cruel action inspired by blind jealousy that
he endeavoured to justify by writing her a harsh letter, saying
that not only had she not told him that she wished to come to the
table, but that she was in no fit state to do so, since she had not
repented the wrongs she had done. The scandal in Savannah over this
action was as great as the scandal had been in Frederica over Mrs.
Hawkins, and in both, as his many enemies noted, John Wesley was
entangled. There was an eager outcry against John, as a tiresome
man of whom the colonists wished to be rid. Oglethorpe had left for
England to report to the Trustees (Charles Wesley had not yet done
so) and to ask Parliament for money for Georgia; so the young
clergyman had no friends save the loyal but indiscreet
Delamotte.</p>

<p>Mr. Williamson, who, whatever his rival's opinion of him,
appears to have been a resolute man of action, at once issued a
writ for slander against Wesley. The angry husband was supported
warmly by the powerful and tyrannical Causton, who had deserted
Wesley, once his friend, and was beside himself with rage at the
public insult to his niece; a thousand pounds damages for
defamation of character was demanded.</p>

<p>John Wesley was arrested and brought before the court on August
9; bail was demanded, but the clerk declared that "Mr. Wesley's
word was sufficient "; so the indomitable young clergyman went
again about his work, studying his languages, writing his hymns,
going from house to house, though many doors were shut in his face;
preaching in the little wooden and plastered church, though his
congregation had dwindled to but a few of the faithful or the
curious. Almost the entire male population of Savannah was on the
Grand Jury of forty-four people; these included a Roman Catholic, a
Frenchman, an Atheist, and nineteen Dissenters. Besides Sophie
Williamson's indictment, there were many charges against John
Wesley, most of them ecclesiastical; his extreme unpopularity and
the deep offence he had given to the colonists were shown by the
charges that they now brought against him. The trine baptism, his
attempts to inflict penance and to extort confessions, the improper
ways in which he had interfered with the usual forms in conducting
services, and above all the exasperation of the men at his
interference with the women in house-to-house visiting, his
attempts to teach wives and servants "to fast, to mortify the
flesh, to pray in a manner that interfered with their husbands'
interests and the conduct of their households." These indictments
were finally reduced to ten; John Wesley, secure in his
scholarship, pointed out coolly that this was not an ecclesiastical
court, and had no jurisdiction in ecclesiastical matters. The
secular charge, the alleged defamation of the character of Mrs.
Williamson, he was willing to answer.</p>

<p>Though the Grand Jury sat several times, they could not agree
about the procedure to be adopted, and a minority of the Jury,
getting away from the main issue, pledged themselves to investigate
the behaviour of the detested Causton and ended by declaring him to
be the author of all the trouble, setting on foot proceedings
against him that eventually led to his downfall for falsifying his
accounts as public storekeeper. But John, though a free man, felt
that he could no longer endure to remain in Georgia, a land to him
of the acutest disillusionment, the bitterest disappointment; he
could not live in a town where he was the centre of so much
dissension and scandal; he could not be the pastor of a flock that
openly defied him; above all, he could not live near to Sophie, his
lost love, the wife of another man.</p>

<p>John put a notice outside his church in the great Square that he
proposed to leave Georgia; whereupon Causton sent for him, and told
him that he would have to give bail before he was permitted to
depart from Savannah; John retorted that he would explain himself
to the Trustees in London and there was no man there of sufficient
standing, education, or personality to deal with one of his
quality, and he was neither well guarded nor efficiently watched;
after all, they wanted to be rid of him. After praying with a few
friends he went secretly from Georgia with four men who also had
good reason for wishing to escape from the colony. They were not
without adventures, notably lack of water on the way, and several
times missed the road. For many men such a failure after such high
hopes, such a departure after such a triumphant arrival, would have
been the depths of humiliation, and pride and courage would alike
have been broken during his ignominious flight, stumbling in the
dark in company with fugitives across a strange country; but John
Wesley had abated nothing of his pretensions or of his arrogance.
When Causton had told him that he should sign bonds to the amount
of fifty pounds, to appear before the Savannah Court when summoned
to do so, John answered him plainly: "Sir, you use me very ill, and
so do the Trustees. I will give neither any bond nor any bail at
all. You know your business and I know mine." In this mood he
"shook the dust" off his feet and resolutely turned his back on
failure, disappointment, and humiliation, and, neither faint nor
weary, tramped through virgin forests and large swamps, trying to
find the way from Parrysburg to Port Royal. The four wayfarers
lived on water found by thrusting a stick into the ground and on a
gingerbread cake that John had in his pocket, and supported, as he
believed, by God, arrived at Beaufort, where the English minister
offered them "old English hospitality "; here Charles Delamotte
joined them, and a cold perilous journey was taken to
Charlestown.</p>

<p>There John preached and visited a dying man; he was also taken
ill with a flux; he was well received, and instantly began to
torment himself for fear this "respect and attendance" as much as
Sophie Hopkey should undermine his determination to dedicate
himself to spiritual things; he took leave of Charles Delamotte,
"the last of the friends who came with me to America," and who had
never been away from him for more than a few days since they had
landed in October, 1735.</p>

<p>On November 24 John Wesley left America on the <i>Samuel,</i>
having made a clean cut of the missionary effort that was to have
meant salvation. Instead of meeting and converting Indians he had
met and lost a loved woman, glimpsed and resisted temptation
stronger than he had believed temptation could be. He had brought
little good to anyone and he had made himself cordially disliked by
most of his flock; he knew that when he returned to England he
would have to go before the Trustees to explain his conduct and to
meet the charges that had been made against him.</p>

<p>He felt lost, ruined, and wretched as, with failure behind him,
uncertainty ahead, his heart broken, his spirit disturbed, and
friends scattered, he lay in the cabin of the ship that was taking
him back to his England after an absence of more than two
years.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>
OUT OF THE DEEP.</h2>

<p class="first">
JOHN WESLEY parted with the faithful Charles Delamotte on the
American shores and sailed among strangers for England, on the
<i>Samuel.</i> He felt, for the first time in his life, shaken in
his soul, nervous, and depressed; he was sea-sick, too, and though
this passed after he had ceased "to live delicately," and though he
obtained some peace of mind by trying to convert a negro,
instructing the cabin-boy, and reading the Bible with one of his
fellow-fugitives, a poor Frenchman who had escaped "by the skin of
his teeth" from Parrysburg, he was a distracted and an unhappy man.
Touched with despair he wrote a paper&mdash;still all must be done
by rule&mdash;in which he accused himself of unbelief, of pride, of
levity and luxuriancy of spirit, of lack of humility in speaking of
his enemies, and so on. By using his reason he tried, hopelessly,
to argue away his lack of faith; the more logic he applied to his
problem, the more insolvable it appeared.</p>

<p>John Wesley's love for Sophie Hopkey had melted much of the icy
dogma, the withering superstition that had hitherto frozen and
stunted his nature and his intelligence. Enclosed in solitude, on
the labouring ship between the vast clouded sky and the unfathomed
ocean, he saw his creed for what it was, and realized the folly and
the wrong that he had done a dear and loving woman by sacrificing
her to a tangle of superstitions that had held mankind in
subjection for too long. The intelligence that he had deliberately
suppressed, when he had turned from mathematics and speculative
philosophy, now asserted itself. He had often longed for solitude
in order that he might ponder over how he was to be a perfect
Christian; here he was caged in loneliness amid the elements, and
his thoughts flew wide. As the tempest beat overhead and the ship
rocked in the deep trough of the waves, the pale sick young man in
the closed cabin was released from the heavy domination of all the
falsehoods that had been taught him by the sour fanatics who had
brought him up, who had impressed his mind, when it was like wax,
with dismal cruel superstitions more degrading and terrible than
any cherished by the savages whom he had sought to save from
damnation. He thought of the punning hymn of the great poet who had
been so rapturously torn between the ecstasies of the flesh and
those of the spirit; he was haunted by two of the lines:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
I have a sinne of feare, that when I have spunne<br>
My last thread, I shall perish on the shore.</p>

<br>

<p>What could be more awful than this fear! To labour to save his
soul, with all his forces, and then, exhausted as the spider that
has spun his final thread, to perish on the shores of Hell. Yet,
when every other sin was combated and subdued, there still remained
that "sin of fear," a lack of faith in salvation. But suppose that
fear was right? Suppose that it was not fear at all, but an effort
of human intelligence to rise above the dismal slough of human
superstition? John Wesley wrote in his Journal:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">But in a storm I think, "What if the Gospel be
not true? Then thou art of all men the most foolish. For what hast
thou given thy goods, thy care, thy friends, thy reputation, thy
country, thy life? For what art thou wandering over the face of the
earth?&mdash;a dream, a cunningly devised fable?"</p>

<p><br>
It was the turning-point of his life; the truth flickered before
him in the wind and rain and almost he grasped it and was
delivered. "A dream," and "a cunningly devised fable"&mdash;shocked
by the agony of love forgone, by the pain of human instincts
violently frustrated, by the stab of self-knowledge, the young man
saw his creed for what it was. Here, in mid-ocean, the stern face
of Susanna Wesley was dim in the memory, the harsh voice of Samuel
Wesley sunk in a deeper silence than that of the grave, the long
penance that was Epworth, Charterhouse, Oxford, Georgia was rolled
up&mdash;pages blotted with follies, with excesses, with errors,
with dark and dank superstitions&mdash;and the young man's soul
soared free&mdash;let the whole thing go, picking from it only
those grains of truth that it shared with all other creeds!</p>

<p>Unite love of humanity, high ideals, a lofty standard of
personal conduct with a mind at liberty, a heart satisfied, a soul
at peace, with freedom to search for knowledge, to investigate all
avenues to wisdom and truth, with a wide toleration and an
indifference to all superstition! For a while this seemed possible,
but custom, "heavy as frost, deep as life itself," renewed its grip
on the tormented young man, and what had seemed the serene face of
truth became the leering mask of the Devil. These doubts were the
foul temptations of Satan, this unbelief would lead him to Hell.
"Mine is a fair summer religion!" he cried bitterly, and forced
himself back into his fetters, which were never to release him
again. He remembered the Moravian's counsel of "stillness" and
subdued himself into acquiescence with a creed in which he had not
that faith which was, he knew, essential to salvation.</p>

<p>The <i>Samuel</i> weathered the storms and sailed into the Downs
before a strong north wind. A passing outward-bound ship bore,
though Wesley did not know it, the newly ordained George
Whitefield, full of enthusiasm for the project that John Wesley had
just abandoned, that of converting the Indians of Georgia. If he
had been aware of this zealous new missionary, it would not have
much consoled him; the clamping of himself down anew into his
ancient chains was causing him great agony. He accepted it
all&mdash;God, Christ, the Gospels, original sin, the Redemption,
Heaven, Hell, salvation through faith&mdash;but only with an
exhausted; unwilling mind, and with his spirit not at all.
Terrified at his own inner and obstinate disbelief, he felt that he
was damned, "never converted to God "; of what use his studies, his
charities, his labours, his perils, his self-denials, his
relinquishments of earthly pleasures? He had not faith, therefore
he was "altogether corrupted and abominable, a child of wrath, an
heir of Hell."</p>

<p>In a mood of deep depression he landed at Deal on the cold
February morning and started on the rough tedious journey to
London, preaching by the way. It was two years and nearly four
months since he had left Gravesend in the <i>Simmonds,</i> and what
had he learned? The strength and pain of human love and human
desires and the impossibility of reaching faith through reason or
salvation through routine. More was needed: what was it? where
should he find it?</p>

<p>He was still tormented by the most poignant of human
pains&mdash;regret; he might have married that sweet companion,
that tender lover; he might have remained in Georgia, the
right-hand man of James Oglethorpe, using his gifts of leadership,
his energy, his zeal, his training, to build up a new nation. In
that task worldly happiness and worldly ambition would have been
achieved, and great qualities would have found a worthy scope. But
as the familiar, misty, grey atmosphere of his native country
closed around him, these regrets were softened into the
self-righteous pangs of martyrdom. It no longer seemed unreasonable
that celibacy was required of him, nor that God had spoken by means
of a scrap of paper drawn out of a bowl by Charles Delamotte;
Wesley's realization of "the dream and the fable" seemed now a
hideous temptation valiantly overcome.</p>

<p>The shadow of Epworth parsonage was over him again; after all,
the New World had offered a heady draught to the prim Oxford
don&mdash;nothing had been quite in focus, under those azure skies,
crowned with the purple storm-clouds, shot with gigantic
lightnings, broken by the distant violet mountains. Life had gone
differently in the palmetto huts, adorned with the brilliant
flowers, the metallic foliage of strange plants, surrounded with
those lush meadows and swamps, those forests of blue-black pines
beaten on by that blazing sun. Looked back upon from the Dover
shore, Georgia seemed to glitter with the rainbow hues of an
hallucination, the central point of which was that flash of
deluding brightness, Sophie Christiana Hopkey in her fresh muslin
gown. Undoubtedly even he, John Wesley, had been affected, even
intoxicated, with so much that was new, strange, and
beautiful&mdash;and all so different from what he had thought it
would be&mdash;aye, different indeed from the cynic Indians who
came to cadge rum and scarlet cloth and countered Wesley in his
full canonicals with talk of "the Beloved Ones"; to vulgar
coquettes like Beata Hawkins, idle, overblown, and resolved to
introduce sexual disturbance wherever they went; to Thomas Causton
with his gaol and whipping-post, his falsified accounts, his
mole-heap tyranny. Even James Oglethorpe had become different in
the New World. Wesley had hardly recognized the correct member for
Haslemere, the earnest humanitarian, the gracious gentleman, in the
lean weather-beaten figure, absorbed in schemes of British
aggrandizement, bent over his maps, watching the buildings of the
fort at Frederica, harsh and angry when any attempt was made to
draw him from his task&mdash;yes, no doubt, in Georgia, they had
all been touched with lunacy.</p>

<p>But it was over now, and John Wesley was on his native shore.
Those daring disbeliefs that had seemed possible on board the
little ship, labouring with wind and water, now appeared
blasphemous in this country, where nominal service was paid to
nominal Christianity and a formula, devised by a Swiss professor of
moral philosophy, whereby the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth were
co-ordinated with modern ideas of law and order, had been adopted
with cosy satisfaction by the ruling classes, who found in
Erastianism a convenient compromise between an exacting but
respected theology and the realities of government. In this
atmosphere, the revered (if "empty save on Sundays ") churches on
every hand, in a country where students tainted with Deism were
sent down from Oxford University or confined for months to their
room to translate orthodox writers from Latin into English, where
the peculiar religion that the national temperament had made of
Protestantism was stamped like a sign-manual over the
land&mdash;how was it possible to dare to regard the Gospels as "a
dream," "a fable"?</p>

<p>John Wesley shuddered with relief at his escape from this
terrible temptation and went to Oxford, where he found Charles ill
and irritable and the members of the Holy Club scattered. It was a
drab, depressing period; the only satisfaction that Wesley could
find was that the Lord "had humbled and proved him and shown him
what he was." There was gratification, no doubt, in hearing of the
great success achieved by George Whitefield, but there was
amazement too; the raw, squinty lad from the pot-house had done
more in a few years than the Wesleys had been able to do in a
lifetime of effort, and without influence, training, or background.
During Wesley's fruitless absence in Georgia "the worm from a
public-house" had become one of the most-talked-of men in England;
he filled the churches everywhere he went; journalists hurried
after him, crowds pressed about him on his travels; Dissenters,
Quakers, the gentry, and the outcasts all were eager to run after
the former poor servitor of Pembroke College.</p>

<p>Yet, when John had sent a call for help from America, Whitefield
had left all this excitement to hasten out, only to miss his friend
and elder by the length of the voyage. He returned in November
after a lightning visit and a golden harvest; in Savannah, in
Thunderbolt, in Ebenezer, in Frederica he had been received with
open arms, as much run after as Wesley had been avoided; he had had
the honour of guiding Heavenwards the soul of Tomochichi, who had
not been much impressed by Wesley and who, now nearly a
centenarian, was perhaps past being impressed by anyone. Then
Whitefield had founded a girls' school, an orphanage, after the
German model, and had preached under a tree, because the churches
were not large enough. On his return he landed in Ireland, where
"mayors and bishops" were at his feet, and where he visited a
family of "wild Irish," five people, two pigs, two dogs, and some
geese being housed in a small log cabin. Whitefield then hurried
back to London, where he had a loving reunion with his dear
fellow-labourers, the Wesleys.</p>

<p>For John the year had been uneventfully filled with rather
humdrum preaching; his energy had never relaxed; he had preached in
the inn at Deal, when he had landed, and at every stage on the way
to London, and he had never ceased since to preach at least on
Sundays. His most important experience had been meeting with a
young Moravian from Jena University, Peter Bhler, who taught him
"to purge away philosophy" and the necessity of justification by
faith. Implicit in this was the belief that everyone, even the most
pious and moral, is damned unless he passes through the process
known as "conversion "; an experience like that which cast Paul
prostrate at the Damascus Gate, a conviction coming in an instant's
flash&mdash;saving Faith&mdash;that through Christ the sinner has
conquered sin and is saved.</p>

<p>Bhler was careful to explain that this emotional "conversion"
had nothing to do with reason, but Wesley thought himself bound to
bring reason to bear on it and to search the Thirty-nine Articles
for a confirmation of the theory, and thought that he had found it
in Article XII; but, whether or no, he had not experienced it, and
was inclined to give up preaching, but Bhler advised: "Preach
Faith till you have it, and then because you have Faith you will
preach it," a piece of sophistry that was really an invitation to
induce self-hypnotism. But Wesley acted on it, and in the interim
of waiting on the Georgia Trustees, interviewing James Oglethorpe,
who returned to Georgia with men and money, and giving an eye to
his family affairs, he preached by rote, and when the churches were
gradually closed to him under the excuse that it was not the Church
of England that he was serving, he preached before the societies he
and Charles had formed, on the model of the Holy Club; the most
important being at Fetter Lane, London. George Whitefield, on his
return, joined with zest in those schemes and preached as often as
twenty-seven times a week, drawing thousands where the Wesleys drew
hundreds.</p>

<p>In the London of 1738-9 there was a good deal to preach about,
even on the lines of elementary morality. John Wesley, always on
the side of law and order, accepted the ethical and legal codes of
the day. His views of crime and criminals were those of the
lawmakers and those who enforced the law, those of the magistrates
and the constables, only he conceded that these wretches at
Faversham, where he had found people "more savage than the wild
Indians," had souls that might even at the last minute be saved by
faith. The logical outcome of this point of view was, first, an
attempt to reform morals and manners, to threaten with Hell and
bribe with Heaven the gross, the ignorant, and the vile; then, if
this failed, to snatch their souls, justly the prey of Satan, with
a "brink-of-eternity" conversion.</p>

<p>John Wesley began to visit prisons and saw some instances of
this faith that he had not got himself, and that Peter Bhler said
it was essential he should have, among condemned criminals. These
excited him so much that he again consulted the young Moravian;
Peter Bhler, who possessed to the full that serenity which Wesley
always found so fascinating among the Moravians, not only pointed
to the Bible, which was full of instances of sudden conversions,
but produced several people of his own acquaintance who had had
this remarkable experience.</p>

<p>This young German was an attractive and dominating character; it
was he who had been instrumental in founding the little society in
Fetter Lane, and it was he who brought round Charles&mdash;who at
first had been shocked by John's statement that "he was not a
Christian, because he had not faith"&mdash;to see that without this
belief salvation was not possible. Charles was ill of pleurisy when
Peter Bhler went to his bedside to argue with him on this most
important point. Soon after, the young German returned to his own
country, leaving the two brothers, Charles still weak from illness,
convinced that they were no better than the most depraved criminals
to whom they ministered in the fever-ridden gaols, until they found
this saving grace of faith.</p>

<p>While they were waiting for this miracle to occur, there was
plenty of practical work for them to do, and the two earnest young
men&mdash;Charles still weak from his sickness&mdash;set about
doing what they could to reform London. There was every kind of
evil with which to contend, and drunkenness was one of them. The
struggle to prohibit rum in Georgia was as child's play to the
struggle to bring gin-drinking within limits in London. There was a
nominal duty of fifty pounds a year to be paid for selling this
intoxicant, but about six thousand people were convicted annually
for evading this law, and they were probably but a small proportion
of those who contrived and smuggled sales of gin. The lower classes
poisoned themselves with Madam Geneva in an effort to forget their
wretchedness. This was one cause of the many crimes of violence in
the capital, though juries were notoriously lenient, because of the
severity of the law. No week went by without a hanging at Tyburn,
with its attendant scenes of cruelty, debauchery, and
degradation.</p>

<p>The Wesleys were faced with many other distressing breaches of
the moral and social laws; for instance, those mentioned by a
Committee of the House of Lords appointed to examine "the causes of
the present notorious immorality and profanity." To begin with,
Sunday was not observed as a holy day, and in vain constables and
beadles were told to arrest shoeblacks, barbers, alehouse and hot
coffee-house keepers who persisted in trying to ply their trades on
the Lord's Day.</p>

<p>Then there was the neglect of Divine Worship, the shocked
Committee reporting that this was "greater than had ever been known
in England before." There was, besides, a want of reverence for the
law and the magistrates, and "undue" insubordination in several
ranks and degrees of the community. The British public were also
accused by their Lordships "of abusing liberty, neglecting
education, a want of care in training children and keeping servants
in good order," while "idleness, luxury, gambling, and extensive
use of spirits or intoxicating liquor had grown to an alarming
magnitude." Worst of all, there were terrible rumours of a club of
loose and disorderly persons calling themselves "Blasters," who
worshipped the Devil in secret, tried to obtain fresh disciples for
him, and uttered the "most daring and execrable blasphemies against
the sacred name and majesty of God, which were so obscene and
unheard-of" that the Noble Committee could not even mention
them.</p>

<p>This painful state of public immorality and distress touched
even the Wesley family. John could not congratulate himself on his
brothers-in-law. Sukey's "bad" husband was ruined by the Fen
floods, and John had to try to obtain charitable grants for him.
Lambert and Wright both drank to excess, and the latter had become
a dissolute ruffian, who physically maltreated the once-brilliant
Hetty, now a hysterical drudge trying to keep together a miserable
home and relieve a broken heart by writing touching verses to her
dead children. The Rev. Westley Hall, though he had met the
approval of Mrs. Wesley when she had taken refuge with him and
Martha, his wife, was fast becoming alarmingly eccentric, and
Emilia, who had given up love and happiness in deference to her
brother's superstitious intolerance, was hardening into a stiff
spinster, grimly keeping together the little school in
Gainsborough. Keziah, drugged with religious melancholia, was
living on the few pounds given her by her brothers, staying with
relations and friends, and directing all her intelligence and all
her emotions towards the thought of Heaven. Poverty stung and
hampered all these people.</p>

<p>Samuel was, however, comfortable enough at Blundell's; he had
become a careful, dull, family man, cosily in a groove, avoiding
the temptations, trials, and excitement of the outer world, easily
alarmed by any hint of heresy in others, quick to moralize and
preach from his own safe niche.</p>

<p>Matthew Wesley, the liberal-minded physician, had died after a
long illness which his art had been able neither to cure nor to
alleviate; his death-bed had been, Charles hoped, "that of a saved
Christian." He had at least been kindly towards his brother's
family to the last, but he had not left them a fortune, and
oblivion had finally closed over Mr. Annesley, the Indian merchant.
No one now expected him to return to England to provide for his
nieces, now ageing women, with all their expectancy chilled into
resignation.</p>

<p>Susanna Wesley bore all with icy calm; to shoulder all these
inexplicable burdens in the hope that some day their meaning would
be explained to her was all that she could do. Like all those who
are not mystic, yet follow a religion not commendable to common
sense, she could only talk about "the mysterious ways of God."
Relieved from forty years of childbearing, house-keeping, educating
sons and daughters, she now passed from one to another of her
children's modest homes reading, meditating, and talking, and
preparing herself for the great day when she would meet her lost
Samuel, her nine infants, and poor Mary Whitelambe before the
throne of the Most High. Spending eternity with a man of whom she
had said: "I agree with him in nothing," was perhaps not a very
cheerful prospect, but she might confidently expect that the former
Rector of Epworth would be less talkative and dictatorial in
Heaven, where he would be overawed both with a sense of the
presence of the Almighty and by discovering that his wife Sukey had
been right after all, for she was sure that if the pious but
misguided Samuel reached Heaven it would be through her
prayers.</p>

<p>John continued to look towards this valiant old woman as censor
and guide. Anxious for her sympathy and approval, he told her the
strange story of his Georgian adventure, and for her dim eyes he
wrote down an account of his pitiful love story, putting it all
carefully and neatly on paper in his beautiful, clear handwriting,
which was, like everything about him, precise and careful.</p>

<p>He wrote this account of Sophie while in his rooms in Lincoln
College; his text was: "Oh! give me not up to my own heart's lusts,
neither let me follow my own imagination." "Lusts" in the sense
that John Wesley meant seemed a hard word to express his need for
the delicate submissiveness, feminine modesty, and docile grace of
poor Sophie Hopkey, at eighteen years of age, but the young man now
plainly saw the hand of God in his escape from the seductive
maiden.</p>

<p>But now he was not any longer afraid either of Sophie or of
philosophy, or of any physical or intellectual distractions; he had
returned for ever to the path on which his mother had set his
infant feet; for the moment all was dark about him. He was
proceeding like a blind man with neither guide nor staff, merely
remembering a set of rules, and proceeding on a given way without
asking either whither or why, and the ecstatic baffled mood into
which his Georgian experiences and the influence of Peter Bhler
had thrown him was such as to cause consternation to his friends.
Charles soon understood his brother, but the parents of Charles
Delamotte were shocked when John said he was not a Christian,
because he had not faith, and Mrs. Hutton, another old friend,
declared roundly: "If you have not been a Christian, you must have
been a great hypocrite."</p>

<p>But John held firmly to the young Moravian's teachings. "There
is such a thing, though I have not got it," he declared, and he
waited, not without misery and anguish, but with grim patience, for
the miracle to take place, wrestling with God for salvation and
blessedness.</p>

<p>He had lost worldly love and worldly ambition; he must have
something to put in their place, some means of self-expression,
some vent for his frustrated emotionalism; the routine piety that
had sufficed his father and drudges like Johnny Whitelambe was not
enough for him; method, yes, but there must be something more. He
felt that God owed him something more; he clamoured for faith, to
be made use of as he trudged about the filthy ways of the city,
through the dust of the high-roads, as he descended into the muck
and stench of the prisons, as he sat in neat parlours or in his
tidy college rooms.</p>

<p>He looked with compassion upon the sick, the vicious, the
lonely, the outcast, but with no great moral indignation. These
people were not beloved kin to him, as they were to George
Whitefield, but the raw material of his life-work, the lumps of
moist clay that the sculptor does not quite know how to use.
Besides, his own feet had to be firm on a rock before he could
reach out a hand to pull others out of a quagmire.</p>

<p>As he took part in the four feasts, the singing and praying, his
disciples felt that he was apart from them, a tormented doubting
man. His friends received him with alarm, wondering what heresy or
lunacy he was going to develop; only Charles understood; he had
been wretched since he had landed in Georgia, hating the
secretarial work, the climate, his stubborn rude flock, overwhelmed
by the horror of the Beata Hawkins slander. Continually ill, under
the strangely soothing influence of Peter Bhler he had begun to
find peace; and his relief and exultation expressed themselves in
the leaping rhythms of his hymns "that danced the soul on a light
jig to Heaven." Charles had a beautiful gift of rhythmic melody
that broke into expression when he was deeply moved, as he was now,
recovering from pleurisy, perhaps by a miracle, and waiting for the
blinding flash of instantaneous conversion. But John could not
emulate his brother's warm humanity, his eager, possibly rash,
acceptance of Bhler's teachings, his lively enthusiasm; the elder,
John, must reason, must convince or stultify his mind, already
subdued but not completely in subjection. When Charles informed him
joyfully that he&mdash;Charles Wesley&mdash;felt sudden and full
assurance of a miraculous change in himself that could only be
termed conversion, John could only whisper in miserable humility:
"Lord, help thou my unbelief!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>
"GREAT AND PRECIOUS PROMISES."</h2>

<p class="first">
AS he went about his good works in a gloomy mood very foreign to
his natural cheerful nature, Wesley declared in bitter
self-abasement: "I am not a Christian, I do not love either the
Father or the Son."</p>

<p>He was torturing himself with self-analysis; so much was wrong,
what could be right? So much had been cast away, what could replace
it? There remained only the monotony of a dry routine. John lost
his beautiful gift of singing. When he tried to meditate he fell
into dismal forebodings, when he tried to pray it was no more than
the reading of formulae. Desperately he turned on the man who had,
he thought, been a false guide, and wrote somewhat bitterly to
William Law, the author of <i>Serious Call</i> and <i>Christian
Perfection,</i> which Wesley had followed so implicitly for so many
years. Why had not Law told him what Bhler had? Why had he, Law,
misled him for so long? Bailer had been to see John Gambold and
William Law; though he had found the former almost a saint, he had
thought the latter in "a dangerous state," and had told Wesley so.
Wesley thereupon vented his own misery and uneasiness in an attack
on the man whom he had once so much admired. "Once more, sir, let
me beg you to consider whether your extreme roughness, morose and
sour behaviour, at least on many occasions, can possibly be the
fruit of a living faith in Christ?"</p>

<p>William Law answered with equal harshness and discourtesy, and a
sarcastic correspondence took place between the two men, little
conducive to the peace of mind of either. Law, by far the older,
ended the correspondence by asking flatly:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Who made me your teacher? or can make me out
answerable for any defects in your knowledge? You sought my
acquaintance, you came to me as you pleased, on what occasion you
pleased and to say to me what you pleased. If it was my business to
put this question to you, and if you have a right to charge me with
guilt for the neglect of it, may you much more reasonably accuse
them who have authoritatively charge of you? Did the Church in
which you were educated put the question to you? Did the Bishop who
ordained you either deacon or priest do this to you? Did the Bishop
who sent you a missionary to Georgia require this of you? Pray,
Sir, be at peace with me.</p>

<p><br>
John Wesley had indeed harassed himself into a state of mind in
which his common sense was in abeyance. Otherwise he would have
seen the injustice and absurdity of charging the teacher whom he
had selected himself for his own lack of that lovely peace that
could come only, Peter Bttler said, with a sense of dominion over
sin and a conviction of the love of God. Yet it is easy to
understand John's bitterness, for he felt that he had wasted years
of effort in barren labours, and now, doubtless was in as much
danger of Hell as any poor wretch to whom he preached.</p>

<p>Why was the precious gift denied him?</p>

<p>Charles had it, and Gambold and Whitefield&mdash;all declared
that they had passed from darkness to light, but John could not
find the one thing needful.</p>

<p>His intense excitement and distress began to affect with
collective hysteria those with whom he came in contact. Most of
them were simple, ignorant people, starved of spiritual experience,
like those who gathered in the Fetter Lane room, or people whose
minds were already absorbed with religion like the Huttons, with
whom the Wesleys lodged, and all those watching John, listening to
him, fascinated by his latent power, his ascetic life, his dainty
yet formidable personality that had the delicacy, force, and grace
of a beautiful, deadly rapier of proven steel, began to catch
sparks from the concentrated flame of his emotionalism. In trying
to hypnotize himself, he hypnotized others. Wherever he went there
was agitation, disturbance; the times were fat and drowsy, brutal
and dull; there had been no spiritual excitement for more than a
hundred years; it was a long time since anyone had seen visions in
England. The Moravians and their native followers began to attract
attention. As church after church was closed to the Wesleys, more
and more crowded to hear them at the meetinghouse; this notice
helped the excitement. As the audience swelled, the actors became
more extravagant. What the country had long lacked and what it
condemned heartily&mdash;John himself disliked it&mdash;enthusiasm,
began to charge the air as electricity fills the atmosphere before
a storm. Nobody knew what to believe, nor what to think; the
tension caused in Epworth Rectory by "old Jeffrey" was reproduced
in London. One of the friends of the Wesleys was summoned by a
knock on her door in the middle of the night; on opening it she was
confronted by a dazzling figure, who declared: "I am Jesus Christ."
In consequence she became filled with the faith that John was
seeking in vain, and went off to Charles, who was ill again,
telling him that Christ had assured her he would recover body and
soul. There were painfully hysterical scenes in the meetinghouse in
Fetter Lane; one man fell down trembling and in a cold sweat after
seeing, as he declared, a vision of a crowd of spectres bearing
through the air the bleeding body of Christ; another who had come
under the influence of the Wesleys' teaching went into St.
Dunstan's Church and met Christ carrying His cross on the
threshold; a third follower found salvation through the bursting of
a ball of fire at her feet.</p>

<p>The Huttons, plain sensible people conventionally pious, were
thoroughly alarmed, and wrote to Samuel, as the head of the family,
about all these extravagances. The prosy schoolmaster was startled
and vexed. He thought these evidences of enthusiasm "downright
madness," and that the Moravians were "canting fellows"; he
despised these "indwellings, experiences, getting into Christ," and
wished that the Germans had remained in their own country. He was
horrified, too, to think that John had become, as the Huttons
declared, a wild enthusiast and was saying: "When we renounce
everything but faith in getting to Christ, then, and not till then,
have we reason to believe that we are Christians." Samuel agreed
with Mrs. Hutton that, though his brothers were men of great parts
and learning, they were certainly under a strange delusion, and
declared that he would, if he could, "stop this wildfire."</p>

<p>What could Jack mean by saying that he was not a Christian? No
wonder the Huttons were alarmed for the spiritual safety of their
two children. This expecting to obtain salvation in an instant was
a rank piece of extravagance, and not Samuel's idea of
Christianity. He considered that if Jack's and Charles's wild talk
meant what he thought it did, it was "wretchedly wicked." He hoped
God would stop the progress of this lunacy and that Jack, until he
had changed his mind, would not visit him to disturb the orthodoxy
of Blundell's.</p>

<p>But the collective excitement increased, until the inevitable
happened. John Wesley so worked on himself and so allowed others to
work upon him that he passed into that state towards which he was
striving and which he termed "conversion "; not that it was
lasting, and that he did not blow hot and cold several times
afterwards, but it was a vivid, definite experience that influenced
him for the rest of his life and, exaggerated and embellished in
the memory or in the telling, formed a kind of focus from which he
believed he could date a new and vital spiritual experience.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the little society in Fetter Lane was such
that it was bound, sooner or later, to result in extravagant
emotionalism; indeed, this was deliberately evoked.</p>

<p>The members would meet once a week to confess faults, to pray,
and for discussion; they were divided into several bands, of no
fewer than five or more than ten persons, and these talked together
on one subject only: religion, and its different aspects of
temptations, redemptions, Heaven, and Hell. There was a conference
every Wednesday evening at which there was singing and prayer,
every fourth Sunday was a day of intercession, and on every fifth
Sunday a general love-feast was held which lasted from seven in the
morning until ten at night. Two weekly fasts, Wednesday and Friday,
"as observed in the ancient Church," were undertaken.</p>

<p>Besides this morbid preoccupation with one subject&mdash;and
that both exasperating and exciting, since it dealt with the
largest, most unsubstantial hopes known to humanity&mdash;morbid
introspection was encouraged by mutual confession, and unbalanced
egotism developed by continual dwelling on personal emotions. The
members were in particular admonished to relate and to analyse
their feelings about, and their experience in, "love and
courtship," an unhealthy emphasis thus being placed on what was
termed carnal sin, and honest, natural desires being diverted into
religious mania. Natures incapable of spirituality, caught up in
enthusiasm, believed that a confusion of sensual images, perfected
from their own frustrate humanity, were angelic visions. There were
cries, groans, faintings, embraces, sobbings, self-abasement; the
atmosphere was that of any religious orgy, and had little to
distinguish it from pagan saturnalia, primitive worship of
fertility-gods, or the rites in honour of Satan, that John Wesley
had been so horrified to hear took place in London. There is much
monotony in the manifestations of fanaticism. But the leaders of
this society, even educated men like Bttler and the Wesleys, could
not or would not see what they were doing to their followers, nor
did they even distrust the disgusting symbolism that so perturbed
Samuel Wesley, this luscious dwelling on blood, and torture,
"getting into" the wounds of Christ, relishing the mangled
sacrifice, "the broken body," dwelling on pain, agony, visualizing
the gross horrors of Hell, flaming like a pit of brimstone and
sulphur, or the amorous delights of union with the melting
sweetness of the Saviour.</p>

<p>Now none of these men saw what enthusiasm really was, or read
beneath the gloss on the surface. This was labelled Christianity
and that was sufficient; it would have been rank blasphemy to
suggest that the Fetter Lane love-feasts had evolved from ancient
customs arising from primitive instincts, and that their
counterparts could be found all over the world. As surely as the
Tibetan monk, meditating in darkness and solitude, begins at length
to see buds of fire and flaming lotus blossom in the blackness of
his cave, so these United Brethren began to see their own
creations. One after another beheld the pallid, bleeding body of
Christ, either borne rushing through the air or standing by their
sides. The fine constitution and cool intelligence of John Wesley,
the well-bred, well-educated man of thirty-five years, continued to
resist these hallucinations in which, however, he forced himself to
believe; but his common sense&mdash;what he called his
unbelief&mdash;began to be sapped. He was leading a most unnatural
life; he had, since Peter Bhler had told him "he was not really a
Christian," forgone all manner of distraction, even his music, even
his singing. With little food and little sleep he was consumed by a
restless energy; besides belonging to the Fetter Lane society and
rigidly following its rules, he was preaching, visiting the
loathsome prisons, visiting the paupers and the sick in vile
slums&mdash;"doing what other good I could, with my presence or my
little fortune, on the bodies and souls of all men. To this end I
abridged myself of all superfluities and many that are called
necessaries of life. I soon became a byword for so doing and I
rejoiced that 'my name was cast out as evil...'</p>

<p>And now I knew not how to go any farther. I diligently strove
against all sin. I omitted no sort of self-denial which I thought
lawful. I carefully used both in public and in private all the
means of grace at all opportunities. I omitted no occasion of doing
good. I for that reason suffered evil. And all this I knew to be
nothing, unless as it was directed towards inner holiness." "The
inward witness"&mdash;that sense of being at one with God; faith,
not works.</p>

<p>But John still felt in a "vile abject state of bondage to sin,"
and as he noted in his Journal: "I continued to seek Christ though
with strange indifference, dullness and coldness, and frequent
lapses into sin till Wednesday, May 24, 1738."</p>

<p>This was the date at which he placed his conversion; his
suffering on that morning was intense, and hardly eased by opening
his Greek Bible and reading: "Thou art not far from the Kingdom of
God."</p>

<p>Neatly dressed in his clerical black, with shining hair and
haggard face, he wandered out through the narrow and dark streets,
the huddle of merchants' houses and booksellers' shops round the
great baroque Cathedral, formidable without and gloomy within, and,
creeping into the dun shadows and leaning close by the massive
walls hung with overwhelming emblems of mortality, he listened to
the music of Henry Purcell's <i>De Profundis.</i> This anthem
fitted exactly into his emotional state; he was overwhelmed,
wretched, frightened, yet trembling, as he believed, on the verge
of ineffable joy. The words "And he shall redeem Israel from all
her sins" lingered in his ears. He had engaged that evening to go
to the meeting of a Dissenters' society in Aldersgate Street; he
went very unwillingly, feeling uneasy, nervous, as he sat on the
hard bench in the plain meetinghouse while a layman read Martin
Luther's preface to the Epistle to the Romans, but soon the
agitated young man began to listen eagerly. Surely there was
something supernatural here! In the Cathedral he had heard the
<i>De Profundis;</i> here there was an account of the change that
God works in the hearts of those who have faith in Christ. John
felt warmed, consoled; he began to pray for his enemies. This,
assuredly, was conversion. "I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ
alone, for salvation, and an assurance was given me that He had
taken away my sins, even <i>mine,</i> and saved <i>me</i> from the
law of sin and death." What a burden was lifted from his spirit! He
was not to burn in Hell, he was <i>saved.</i> He went away exalted
and told everyone he met that he had experienced faith...by faith
he was saved. Yet he felt no more than peace and the enemy
suggested: "This cannot be faith, for where is thy joy?" He was
"much buffeted with temptations" that returned again and again, but
he cried out and they fled.</p>

<p>He ran to Charles, who rose up in his bed-gown to listen as John
said: "I believe," and spoke of his conversion; yes, the blinding
flash had darted into the drab little Cockney meetinghouse, even as
it had flashed by the Damascus Gate!</p>

<p>The brothers embraced, the members of the little household came
running in to see these two strange young men with their brilliant
eyes and shining faces singing to the tune of the Twenty-third
Psalm some verses that Charles had composed in flaming
excitement:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
O how shall I the goodness tell,<br>
Father, which Thou to <u>me</u> hast showed?<br>
That I, a child of wrath and Hell,<br>
I should be called a child of God,<br>
Should know, should feel my sins forgiven,<br>
Blest with this antepast of Heaven.</p>

<br>

<p>John had recovered his lovely gift of music. Clear, true, and
piercing his voice rose as it had risen in Epworth, in Oxford, in
Georgia; all his inhibitions were swept away, all his pent-up
emotion released. Here was his life-work, his vent for all his
energies, talents, desire; he had wrested the blessing from God.
The material before him was inexhaustible: he thought of the
inhabitants of the prisons and the slums, who looked up to him with
awe and gratitude "outcasts, publicans, thieves"; he thought of
Beata Hawkins and her kind; easy to deal with them too. God spread
His arms to embrace the harlots; never therefore could John Wesley
be baffled or vexed by a light woman. From an angelic height he
could beam on all with angelic love. Yet, when he had left the warm
presence of Charles, the cold fit touched him again.</p>

<p>"When I was striving, yea fighting, with all my might under the
Law as well as under grace, then I was sometimes, if not often,
conquered. Now I can always conquer."</p>

<p>The next day he awoke with the words "Jesus Master" in his heart
and in his mouth, and, deliberately stimulating and forcing his
mood, went again to St. Paul's and heard the anthem, "My song shall
be always of the loving kindness of the Lord," rising up through
the shadowed dome. Yet still there was a little creeping doubt, the
last struggle of the stunned, drugged mind for freedom. "If thou
dost believe, why is there not a more sensible change?"</p>

<p>Could these last flutterings of temptation be stilled? Mr.
Tltschig, the Moravian, told him not to fight but to flee and take
shelter in "the wounds of Jesus." In other words, not to use his
intelligence but to rely upon his excited, emotions. Still, he had
"peace but not joy," though he was exciting and disturbing his
friends, acquaintances, and followers by his insistence on his
conversion. By everyday folk he was called an enthusiast, a
seducer, a setter forth of new doctrines, and he was delighted to
find that he was not moved to anger by these attacks, but was able
to reply calmly and shortly. Yet there was a relapse; he once spoke
with sharpness instead of tender love to an opponent; then there
was a day of despair when he had scarcely strength to open his lips
or even look up for help, but by Sunday, June 4, a feast-day in the
chapel in Fetter Lane, he was praying, reading the Scriptures,
singing praise, or calling sinners to repentance from the time of
his rising till past one in the afternoon, and every time he opened
the Bible there was some great and precious promise under his
eyes.</p>

<p>He was fully convinced now of his state of grace, but there was
a certain soreness in his heart, and he prayed God to save him from
doubtful disputations. Not without a long, painful, and devastating
struggle did John Wesley succeed in subjugating a clear brilliant
mind, great faculties, and profound gifts into that state of blind
emotional credulity termed faith. Yet he and Charles had achieved
something finer than they knew; something as far above the crude
fanaticism of the Fetter Lane brothers as they were themselves
above their ignorant followers. Behind the experience that they
termed their conversion, and that Charles celebrated with an
outburst of sincere and noble song, was something much higher than
their narrow and repulsive creed. They did really feel
conscious&mdash;if only briefly and intermittently&mdash;of that
other self that is one with truth, beauty, and joy; they glimpsed
the immortal light that burns behind and illuminates the thin and
gaudy drop-cloth of material existence. They felt, not, as they
said and thought, at one with Christ, but in harmony with the
universe, aware of immortal aspirations and of fellowship with the
great and the good.</p>

<p>John was particularly fortunate; he was able to pour all his
hopes and desires into one satisfying labour, to armour himself
against all trials and pains. What could touch a man chosen by his
God to hold a divine commission on earth and to be rewarded for it
in Heaven? Arrogance and love of power were satisfied as well as
spiritual yearnings; the personal emphasis was justified: my sins
are forgiven, I am saved; to which was soon to be added&mdash;"God
has revealed His mind to <i>me."</i></p>

<p>Wishing to talk of his wonderful experience to the one person
above all others whom he trusted and believed, he went to see his
mother. She had been distressed by the tales of Jack's extravagant
behaviour in London, but she listened to him with an open mind, and
was readily convinced that her son was in the right. It was a deep
relief, like that of having an abscess lanced, to know that Charles
and Jacky were not damned. The tired old woman could relax; her
wits were not as sharp as they had been, and all the sorrow, grief,
and humiliations attendant on the miserable marriages of her
daughters had shaken her, so she was ready to give up the last
doubts inspired by her deeply regretted Socinianism and to listen
to her son. He was so changed&mdash;animated instead of prim, bold
instead of cautious, he seemed to flame and sparkle! Susanna Wesley
could believe that God had touched her best-beloved son, and she
felt a rapturous glow of self-righteousness&mdash;her teaching,
<i>her</i> training! John left his mother, refreshed by contact
with this formidable personality whose strong will had made him
what he was, but excited and baffled. What was he to do with his
new-found knowledge and power? How to get at the vast hordes of
sinners wallowing in darkness and peril? Nearly all the churches
were closed to him, the Bishops were hostile, the Fetter Lane
Society was a poor, small affair; he had had enough of trying to
preach to the heathen. What, then, was he to do? He might be
appointed by God to do His work on earth, but, humanly speaking, he
was a poor clergyman without a parish, a chaplaincy, or any
appointment, and with no means beyond the salary of his Lincoln
College Fellowship.</p>

<p>He could, and did, write. He knew the power of the printing
press, the effect of a shower of cheap pamphlets; he saw the vast
popularity there would be for the fervent, melodious hymns that
Charles was pouring out, but how was all this to be gathered
together? under what name was it to go forward?</p>

<p>Faith was obviously not enough; his original plan, method, must
be used too. A blinding, blazing belief in God must be taught and
expressed by method; but he was no revolutionary, not even a
Dissenter. He detested those practical mystics, the Quakers; he was
an Anglican, in love with the Primitive Church. There remained only
his friends the Moravians; it seemed as if he must merge himself
with them, as Gambold, Delamotte, and James Hutton were doing.
Besides, John Wesley was not altogether at peace with his
experiences of the last three years, which still tore and harassed
him. He kept telling himself that he was converted, that he was
saved, that he really believed, but there were still intervals of
depression, and that mental uneasiness which results in doubt or
gloom. He had always found serenity and support with the Moravians,
and he now proposed to go to Germany to visit their settlements
under Count Zinzendorf at Herrnhut; one of his companions was the
tranquil and soothing Tltschig, and he persuaded the handsome
Benjamin Ingham to accompany him.</p>

<p>The little party of earnest clergymen left Gravesend on June 13,
1738. The journey was fatiguing and tedious, and Wesley was so ill
when he arrived at Marienborn, the Moravian colony, about
twenty-five miles from Frankfort, that even his energy was not
equal to interviewing Count Zinzendorf, who was living in a decayed
castle there, without an interval for repose.</p>

<p>The colony consisted of about ninety persons gathered up from
many nations, who were being trained as preachers and missionaries.
They lived together in a large house hired by the Count, who
conducted services and delivered sermons there. John was taken to
visit the Count, who with his son and daughter were dressed in
plain cloth and linen, a seemingly remarkable contrast to the
ostentation of the English aristocracy, though it was really
another and less honest kind of pride. John Wesley was soothed and
pleased with everything he saw here, as he had been soothed and
pleased with the Moravian settlements in Georgia. He wrote to
Samuel that at Marienborn he had found the desire of his
heart:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Here I continually met what I sought for; 'tis
living proofs of the power of faith; persons saved from inward as
well as outward sin by "the love of God shed abroad in their
hearts," and from all doubt and fear, by abiding witness of the
Holy Ghost given unto them.</p>

<br>

<p>Courteous and friendly as were the Moravians&mdash;most of them
students from Jena University&mdash;they did not think so highly of
John as he thought of them. He was not permitted to partake of the
Communion to which Ingham was admitted. The shrewd Germans saw that
he was a man in a state of agitation <i>(homo perturbatus)</i> and
that his head still governed his heart; this even after the
tremendous emotionalism of the conversion.</p>

<p>Zinzendorf drove the Englishman's hardly acquired humility
almost to breaking point; John was ordered to dig in the garden,
then, when in a sweat, directed in dirt-begrimed shirt and with
soiled hands to jump in a carriage and visit a neighbouring
potentate with the cry: "You must be simple, my brother."</p>

<p>John was outwardly submissive and listened to the Count's
flamboyant sermons, and took a keen interest in every aspect of the
little colony that was carefully organized in a manner most
attractive to a Methodist. John examined the school, the chapel,
the cemetery, and the Count took him to visit this as a diversion.
John listened to all the rules for living, for marrying, for
bringing up children. Was this it? Ought he to throw in his lot
with the Moravians? Could he decide? First he must investigate
farther. With Ingham he went on his way, stopping at Jena
University, where they were pleasantly received, brought before the
Duke of Weimar, who asked why the Englishmen wanted to go to
Herrnhut, and who gave them "a hard look" when John blandly
replied, "To see where the Christians live," but allowed them to
proceed.</p>

<p>On August 1 the two men came to Herrnhut, about thirty English
miles from Dresden, on the borders of Bohemia. There Wesley met
some Moravians he had known in Georgia, who showed him over the
settlement, which had one long street of about a hundred houses.
Standing in the middle of this was the orphanage, in the lower part
the apothecary's shop, in the upper the chapel capable of
containing six to seven hundred people; beyond the town was a
rising ground where the Moravians prayed, kneeling in a circle.</p>

<p>There was a guest-house where John and Ingham stayed, and were
hospitably entertained. John admired everything here as he had
admired it at Marienborn: the services, the love-feast for the
married men, Bible conferences, the sermons of Christian David, the
bush preacher, who had been shepherd, soldier, papist, and
Greenland missionary, a procession of unmarried men singing praise
to instruments of music, and prayer meetings in the great square;
the eager sightseers also went to a Lutheran service at a
neighbouring village, where the minister had on "a sort of
pudding-sleeve gown which covered him all round." There were two
large candles on the altar, the Last Supper was painted behind it,
the pulpit placed over it, and a large brass image of Christ on the
Cross.</p>

<p>John Wesley's admiration of the Moravians was entirely detached;
he had no wish to incorporate himself with them, nor to enrol
himself under the leadership of Count Zinzendorf. Indeed, he eyed
with some distrust the odd eccentric, perhaps insane nobleman who
had been able to impress his personality on so many people; but
John Wesley had no intention of putting himself under any man. He
knew he was as gifted, dominant, and resolute as the German; he
found, too, that when he had left Herrnhut and the novelty and
excitement of the visit had worn off, that he even disagreed with
the saintly preacher Zinzendorf on several points, and he wrote,
though he did not send, a censorious questionnaire in
which&mdash;of course in a spirit of purely Christian
brotherhood&mdash;he pointed out many defects in the Moravian
system. Why were there not joint fasts held at Marienborn and
Herrnhut? Did the Moravians work hard enough? He believed they were
not quite innocent of either guile or levity and that they talked
too much of their own church. He was sure, too, that the Count "was
all in all, the rest mere shadows."</p>

<p>Besides, were they not of "a close, dark reserved temper and
behaviour?"</p>

<p>In brief, he would not lose himself in Moravianism, another
man's creation. After all, even the statements of these holy men,
Christian David, Michael Linner, Augustine Neusser, and others,
about their spiritual experiences were baffling. John began to feel
confused himself, exasperated, as when he had tackled the mystics.
The thing must be clear-cut, precise, or he could not endure it. He
wrote warm letters of thanks to the Germans for their fortnight's
hospitality and looked round his own country, his own field of
action.</p>

<p>He was now certain that he would not join the Moravians. Still,
they had had their part in this great wrestling with God; they had
helped him through his fierce emotional state; they had eased the
strain of his intense fatigue; they had helped him to recapture the
brilliant light of that flame of ecstasy that he had received first
in the Aldersgate Meeting that was still there, though it sometimes
fluttered and sank almost to extinction.</p>

<p>Indeed, John returned to London refreshed, full of zeal and
vigour, in a state of extravagant excitement, and again joined
Charles in preaching, in visiting the prisons (where the younger
brother was very successful), and in singing the hymns that the two
brothers had written for publication together with pamphlets,
editions of pious books, and translations from the German; the
first bombardment of the outposts of Satan.</p>

<p>Charles Delamotte, however, met the man whom he had once offered
to wait on as a body servant with a rebuke. "You are better than
you were at Savannah, but you are not right yet. You have
simplicity, but it is a simplicity of your own, not the simplicity
of Christ. You think you do not trust in your own work, but you do
trust in your own work, you do not believe in Christ."</p>

<p>Was this true? Had the "conversion" been a deception?</p>

<p>John again consulted the Bible, and found assuring texts, but he
abased himself. At the beginning of the New Year, 1739, he wrote:
"I affirm I am not a Christian now, I have not the peace of God."
Yet he instantly noted: "I have health, strength, friends, a
competent fortune, and a composed cheerful temper; who would not
have a sort of peace under these circumstances?" As for that other:
"That passeth all understanding, he would attain it&mdash;God
should not again escape him."</p>

<p>In a worldly sense he was successful, noticed, envied, followed;
he could not be wholly downcast.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>
THE POWER OF GOD.</h2>

<p class="first">
IN the winter of 1739 there was a joyous reunion; Charles, John,
Ingham, Westley Hall (drawing away from evil), Kinchin, and
Whitefield, recently arrived from Georgia, met at a love-feast in
Fetter Lane. Charles was wrought up by his startling success with
condemned criminals, Whitefield by his spectacular accomplishments
in Georgia, John had been preaching to thousands, in every church
still open to him, at St. Swithin's, at St. George's, Spitalfields,
at St. Bartholomew's, at Islington, in Whitechapel, at different
societies and meeting-houses, and the rapture of last May was
returning. He still could not quite divorce himself from earthly
affections and desires, "a thousand little designs" crept between
him and the great "design of my life," but almost he felt himself
merged into his God.</p>

<p>After hours of prayer, groans, cries, and sobs in the stale air
of the gloomy meeting-room&mdash;there were sixty brethren besides
the leaders present&mdash;a wave of hysteria swept over the
gathering&mdash;the half-crazed men turned to one another with
shouts and cries, many fell in convulsions to the dusty floor; the
coarse yellow lamplight shone on contorted faces and foaming lips.
John, unaffected himself, stared in awe and amazement, then
exclaimed in words that all repeated: "We praise Thee, O God; we
acknowledge Thee to be the Lord."</p>

<p>Wherever John went such scenes occurred; a "middle-aged,
well-dressed woman suddenly cried out, as in the agonies of death"
while he was preaching in the Minories; in Oxford, where he found
the Holy Club scattered, there were other like instances; "the
power of God" John called it; at Reading, at Dunmer, in the prison,
in the parlour, "more and more rejoiced in God."</p>

<p>John was now so occupied that he had hardly time to wonder if
his own conversion was complete. When Whitefield, who had gone to
Bristol, wrote to beg him to come to help deal with the hitherto
wild and lost Kingswood colliers, John did not want to go; he was
doing glorious work where he was; God's blessing was becoming daily
more manifest; one woman had drunk of the Holy Blood, another
washed in it; his teachings of a new birth, a direct emotional
experience, as distinct from ritual, dogma, or good works, was
wildly popular among the weak, the ignorant, the passion-stained,
and, as they were the great majority, John was increasing his
followers every day.</p>

<p>However, Whitefield had been appointed Vicar of Savannah, and
must soon sail for America, so perhaps John ought to gather in that
heavy harvest at Kingswood, though it meant, what shocked the
orderly part of his nature, field-preaching. Using the <i>Sortes
Biblicae,</i> John found the text: "Get thee up into the mountain
and die in the mount."</p>

<p>Martyrdom was clearly indicated; the Society was doubtful; "the
oracles of God" were consulted again and yet again; the answers
were always plain; John was to die in Bristol. He resolved,
however, to go, though his sense "of order and decency" was shocked
at first at being asked to preach in a field instead of a church,
but the idea was stimulating too, and so was Whitefield's account
of the Kingswood colliers, a wild and hitherto neglected community,
who crowded in their thousands to hear the wonderful orator preach,
and listen to him with the tears making channels down the coal
grime on their faces. This unorthodox way of preaching had seemed
strange at first even to Whitefield, who wrote to Wesley that he
had "...begun to play the madman by preaching on a table," but
Wesley was soon caught up in the same enthusiasm, especially as he
had had several exhilarating experiences at Bristol, beginning by
preaching on the highway outside the city to about three thousand
people&mdash;on his own estimation. This was the sequence of a
whirlwind campaign; he held meeting after meeting in the West, in
house, meeting-hall, in the field, by the roadside. Dissenters,
Quakers were converted, as well as the debased colliers. John
Wesley, outwardly cool, neat, inwardly full of energy and passion,
began to affect his motley congregation in a way that could not but
be gratifying to one of his power and ambition. He was persuaded to
visit a lunatic who was continually beating and tearing himself,
thrusting his hand into the fire, and putting pins into his flesh,
and John had succeeded in restoring this wretch to a little calm.
Soon after, another woman who had been accounted mad fell into
convulsions in the preacher's presence, and after prayer was almost
immediately restored to sanity. Then there was the case of another
woman, a violent opponent of Methodism, who cursed and swore
through John's prayers until she fell into extreme agony both of
body and soul, and then, declaring, "Now I know I am forgiven for
Christ's sake," became a zealous convert.</p>

<p>At Bristol, where Whitefield had prepared such a luxuriant
harvest, and at Bath John not only made many converts, but became
fascinated with the freedom of the open-air services; there was no
need to ask permission of vicar or Bishop for the use of church;
besides, it attracted him owing to the large numbers it allowed him
to address. He preached always the same theme, often in the same
words and with the same manner. He knew that he was saved himself,
and he wished to tell fellow-sinners how they might get into the
same blessed condition. He did not deal in polemics, in learned
expositions, in arguments about points of doctrine. He went
straight to the heart of the uneducated people who listened to him
on his tremendous theme: the reality of God's love and of Hell, and
how to escape from it, not merely in externals, by doing good or
using the means of grace in works of piety or of charity, but
through repentance and through faith&mdash;sudden faith, like a
sword in the heart, casting the body to the ground, casting the
Devil out.</p>

<p>The success of the field-preaching finally determined him on his
lifework; there was to be no more hesitation, no turning back. To a
friend who suggested to him that he should take up his work as a
Fellow of Lincoln College he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">I have no business in College, having now no
office and no pupils, and it will be time enough to consider
whether I ought to accept the cure of souls when one is offered to
me. On Scriptural grounds I do not think it hard to justify what I
am doing. God in Scripture commands me according to my power to
instruct the ignorant, reform the wicked, confirm the virtuous. I
look upon all the world as my parish; thus far I mean that in
whatever part of it I am I judge it meet, right and my bounden duty
to declare unto all that are willing to hear the glad tidings of
salvation.</p>

<p><br>
John Wesley's method of performing this duty and of impressing
the huge congregations who jostled in the meadows and fields to
hear him was entirely different from that of George Whitefield, who
possessed the most fascinating personality, able to impress and
seduce even those who did not believe in what he said or indeed did
not listen to the words he uttered. The ex-pot-boy from Gloucester
was a born actor, as persuasive and as well worth hearing as David
Garrick, Dr. Johnson declared. He was neither learned nor
brilliant, nor even intellectual, and apart from his wonderful
histrionic gift he had little talent; his nature was simple,
intensely emotional, vain, theatrical, and soft; he appeared to be
overflowing with "honeyed love" for his fellow-creatures. This
affection was the grateful emotion that the sculptor feels for the
block of marble, the painter for the canvas and the colours, the
embroiderers for the lengths of silk and the gold and silver
thread; the rude, sentimental multitude was George White-field's
material; that enabled him to gratify and to fulfil his entire
nature.</p>

<p>Though, however, George Whitefield could thus sway vast
congregations from one end of the country to the other, although
his influence was equally powerful on the aristocrat and the
peasant, though he could reduce people by hundreds to tears,
repentance, though he could induce a sobbing humility, even among
such grim ruffians as the Kingswood colliers, he never produced
those startling manifestations of hysteria that John Wesley soon
found he could arouse among those to whom he preached the "power of
God." John was not as eloquent as Whitefield&mdash;he never forgot
the restraints imposed on him as a gentleman and a scholar, his
sermons were apt to be monotonous; how could they be otherwise when
he had but one thing to say and said it so many times? His voice,
like his person, was precise. He gave educated listeners the
impression that he had learnt all he said by rote, and was
repeating it almost mechanically, yet he was able to hypnotize
people in a way that George Whitefield never could. When the
delicately-made little clergyman mounted the platform, the chair,
or the hillock; when he began, with his usual gesture, to speak,
casting back the auburn locks with a well-kept hand and fixing his
clear brilliant eyes on the faces before him; when he talked of
Hell-fire and of the means of escaping it, the most extraordinary
hysterical manifestations began to take place. These alarmed and
disgusted all the opponents of the Methodists and were disliked
even by Charles, who thought them largely impostures, though he had
had some such experience when the brothers, praying together, had
suddenly begun to laugh immoderately. The excitement became
intense; John Wesley himself noted with complacency:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">We were treated everywhere as mad dogs. We
were stoned in the streets and several times narrowly escaped with
our lives. In sermons, illustrations, and pamphlets of all kinds we
were painted as unheard-of monsters. This moved us not. We went on
testifying salvation by faith to both great and small, not counting
our lives dear unto ourselves so we might finish our course with
joy.</p>

<br>

<p>Paper warfare against the Methodists grew, and the attacks
became more pointed. "The Wesleys," said one newspaper, "are more
guilty than White-field because they are men of more learning,
better judgment, and cooler heads "; and the enthusiasts were
bidden to join the Dissenters, the Quakers, or the Calvinists and
to leave the Church of England alone. They were reproved in the
papers as "bold movers of sedition and ringleaders of the rabble,
restless deceivers of the people, who made it their daily business
to fill the heads of the ignorant and unwary with wild perplexing
notions," while from the London pulpits they were rebuked as
"deceivers, babblers, insolent pretenders, novices in divinity, and
newfangled teachers."</p>

<p>If the complaints of the clergy were bitter, ordinary people
resented the tumultuous assemblies that blocked streets and commons
and the disturbance of the public peace, "with the intruding into
other men's labours, encouraging fasting, prayer, and other
religious exercises to the neglect of the duties of the State."
There was a war of pamphlets against the Methodists, one of which,
by Dr. Joseph Trapp, had the pertinent title of <i>The Nature,
Folly, Sin, and Danger of being Righteous overmuch, with a
particular view to the Doctrine and Practices of certain Foreign
Modern Enthusiasts.</i></p>

<p>The novelty of field-preaching was much disliked by the Church
of England, for obvious reasons, since the orthodox clergy had no
longer any power or hold over a man who did not require a church in
which to expound; while Whitefield, whose enormous success was
particularly exasperating to those who had been content with the
lukewarm Christianity of the first half of the century, and who was
looked upon as the leader of the movement, was attacked with
especial vehemence; and one writer came pretty near the truth when
he declared that the young preacher "sinks the House of God into a
playhouse and turns religion into a farce; prostitutes swarm at his
meetings, and thus make merchandise as at a country fair; his
congregations are such as crowd to a Smithfield show" and that
Whitefield himself was "an enthusiast, a blasphemer, and wavering,
wandering preacher of no establishment, blending his sermons with
the spice of the Papist and the Mohammedan."</p>

<p>The charge was continually brought against him and the Wesleys
that they did drive people mad; Dr. Gibson, Bishop of London,
published a letter warning the people of his diocese against
lukewarmness and enthusiasm, both of his arguments being against
the Methodists. George Whitefield answered this attack, while John
Wesley was summoned to see the famous Dr. Butler, Bishop of
Bristol, who told him that he thought "to pretend to extraordinary
revelations from the Holy Ghost was a horrid thing, a very horrid
thing "; neither did the Bishop like the tales of the people who
fell in fits in the societies while John Wesley prayed over them.
His Grace concluded by saying that Wesley had no business in his
diocese, and advised him "to go hence." John, of course, had a long
answer to this, saying that being ordained a priest, he was "a
priest of the Church Universal and not limited to any particular
cure. I have an indeterminate commission to preach the Word of God
in any part of the Church of England."</p>

<p>The entire country now became interested in a controversy that
covered almost the entire ground of human interest, for there was
hardly any subject, either of this world or of the next, that was
not included in the furious debates that now took place between the
Methodists and their opponents. Methodism, so novel, so suddenly
sprung on a country sunk in indifferentism, had taken the Church by
surprise; the Wesleys and Whitefield had proved that there was a
vast human material that neither Anglicanism nor Dissent had
touched, nor did they need the consent or protection of the Bishops
in their campaign against Satan. They could do without parishes,
without churches; they could go straight to the wretched pariah and
the cynical aristocrat, and yet keep so well within Church rules
that they could be neither restrained nor cast out. Besides,
cutting through all the confusion of polemics, was this glittering
truth: the Methodists were practising Christianity; they were doing
exactly what St. Paul had done; nay, even as the Master Himself,
before there were either churches or Bishops or any organization at
all. Had there not been field-preaching by the shores of the very
Sea of Galilee as well as on Kennington Common? Had those who
accused Whitefield of drawing off "tradesmen to ramble after him
while their families starved" forgotten Matthew, who left the
receipt of custom to follow Another? When Paul expounded to the
heathen, were there not much groaning, falling down, and wild
babble of talk among his listeners, even as there were at the
love-feasts in Fetter Lane? Mary Magdalene had met her Lord in one
garden: could not another sinner meet Him in another garden?</p>

<p>There was no answer to these questions; if England was a
Christian country, there could be no objections to the Methodists,
who were "casting aside all human glories," as John Wesley said,
preaching and teaching pure Christianity, a torment, a splendour, a
constant goad, promise, and bewilderment. How could it be
otherwise? If the thing was true, here was the way to take it; if
it was not true, then it was mere lazy opportunism to acquiesce in
it, as most of the clergy and their parishioners did. Taking his
stand on these arguments, John Wesley's position was really
unassailable; he had, besides, vast advantages over most of his
opponents: great talents, a private life that commanded deep
respect, enough learning to meet scholars on their own ground, a
fascinating personality, an immovable arrogance. Before almost
either the Church or the public knew what he was doing, he had
forged a weapon of inestimable power; like a blade of fire encased
in steel was his doctrine of faith, salvation, the passionate
emotional appeal to the unseen, protected, as the sword by the
scabbard, by a superb organization; the finest resources of
materialism preserving a fiery emotionalism. He could afford to
smile at the scurrilous doggerel the ballad-mongers
hawked:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">All men of thought with laughter view<br>
Or pity the mistaken crew,<br>
Who, mad with Scripture, void of sense<br>
And thoughtless, novelists commence,<br>
Swerve from the rules of Mother Church<br>
And leave her basely in the lurch;<br>
Next round the gaols they hovering fly<br>
To plague the wretches ere they die&mdash;</p>

<p><br>
He could, indeed, afford to be magnanimous to his opponents and
to turn on them his cool smile and his brilliant eyes in a gentle
pity more exasperating than any rude retort. More than this, he was
equal to the discussions that were arising amid the chosen flock;
Charles was not wholly with his brother, and Whitefield, though out
of the way in Georgia, was encouraging Calvinism among his
followers; a form of quietism, savouring of the passivity of the
mystics, was creeping into the Fetter Lane meetings, and John,
naturally fastidious and chaste, was beginning to dislike the
luscious tone of the Moravians, the mingling of the sexes at the
meetings, the emphasis on confession of sexual sins and
yearnings.</p>

<p>The pamphleteers had, of course, seized on this aspect of
Methodism; in a scurrilous <i>Life</i> of White-field published
anonymously there was printed a method of confession drawn up for
the use of the women Methodists, in which the Brethren of Fetter
Lane were accused of catechizing their Sisters in these terms: "Are
you in love?" "Whom do you love just now better than any other
person in the world?" "Is not the person an idol? Does he court
you? How do you like him? How do you feel when he comes, when he
stays, when he goes away?" And there had been the obvious coarse
jests about the mutual "love confessions" and the means whereby a
supply of future Methodists was assured.</p>

<p>As the atmosphere in Fetter Lane became more charged with
disputes and sullen resentments, John looked about him for some
place of his own where he might be entirely master; he had already
begun to build a meeting-house in Bristol, trusting to God to find
the purchase money, but he wanted a headquarters in London. His
choice fell on the King's Foundry, near Moorfields; he bought this
for 115, raising the money and some of that required to put the
building in repair from his friends. This amounted to 800; nearly
half remained as John's personal debt. The old Foundry stood on
Wind-Mill Hill in the North-west corner of Finsbury Square; the
frontage was about forty yards, and it was about thirty-three yards
in depth. The Government had used it for casting cannon. Soon after
the Treaty of Utrecht, while some old guns captured from the French
were being recast, a severe explosion partly demolished the
building and killed several of the workmen. The place was then
abandoned, and the royal foundry established at Woolwich. In the
reconstruction of this ruined shell of decayed timbers and a
pantile covering John Wesley indulged many of his own preferences
and, as near as he was able, he arranged the Foundry in the
likeness of the old Primitive Church, as he conceived it; the
building was divided into a chapel, a house for the preacher, and a
bandroom or schoolroom. There was a plain belfry for a bell that
summoned Methodists to daily services, which began at five o'clock
in the morning and ended at nine o'clock in the evening. There were
no pews in the chapel, which could accommodate some fifteen hundred
people, but there were galleries with seats, women being in the
front, and the sides were reserved for men. For infirm and aged
women there were a few seats on the ground floor immediately before
the pulpit. What was termed "the band-room" was the school-house
behind the chapel, and large enough to hold three hundred people.
Classes were held here. A portion of it was provided with desks for
children, and attached to it was a small room, where John Wesley
sold his publications, the profits of which were devoted to the
upkeep of the establishment.</p>

<p>Above this schoolroom were the modest apartments in which John
Wesley lived when in London, and there his mother was soon
installed, to preside with the serene detachment of one already
half-translated to Heaven over this unexpected outcome of her
Epworth Methodism. The small house for the accommodation of
parsons, and with room for visiting preachers, a stable and
coach-house, necessary when horses provided the only means of
travel, completed these austere, grim buildings, that were
literally the cradle of Methodism, for soon after acquiring and
repairing the Foundry John Wesley broke with the Fetter Lane
Brethren, who were tedious, on the wrong path, and wasting his time
in petty disputes. In the summer of 1740 he read to the meeting a
refutation of Quietism; then, with his piercing, steadfast glance
travelling from one to another of the confused and downcast faces
before him, gave the Brethren the choice of renouncing the false
doctrine or of losing him. There were nearly seventy people
present; twenty rose at once and followed the masterful man out of
the silent room, but while, with his usual method, he was searching
for his hat, deliberately hidden under a pile of others, the
Moravians had had time to rally, one of the leaders appealed to the
congregation, and it was only with this minority that John passed
into the London street. At the next meeting at the Foundry,
however, there was a manifestation of his peculiar power; a crowd
of women had come over from Fetter Lane to join. Soon some more of
the men had swelled the ranks of Methodism. John Wesley had
separated himself from the Moravians, whom he had so much admired,
and whose leaders had been such an inspiration to him. Now he
needed them no more, could not endure being merged in them or
submitting to their authority. He had his own society, of which he
would be undisputed head, and if he had thus definitely cut himself
off from Moravianism, he had decided no less firmly to cut himself
off from George Whitefield, whose early Calvinistic tinge had been
confirmed, he declared, when writing from America, by divine
revelation. As the Georgian Trustees had seen some years before,
this question of divine revelation was a very embarrassing one. If
John Wesley declared that God had revealed one thing to him, George
Whitefield might declare that he had received another Heaven-sent
message, and who was to decide between the two? A split was
inevitable; Whitefield did not claim to be a theologian or to know
anything of the teachings of Jean Calvin. He tartly reminded Wesley
of what he had admitted in the days of his humility&mdash;that he
had not the witness of the Spirit within him, whereas he, George
Whitefield, felt the divine command inspiring him with every breath
he drew and every step he took. God had spoken to him, poor worm
that he was, and therefore he knew that predestination was right,
but John Wesley could not admit this; he had to cling to his own
divine revelations, and on no grounds would he admit predestination
to be true. A long correspondence dragged out the issues.</p>

<p>Whitefield had been received with rapturous acclaim in Georgia.
Less rigorous than the Wesleys, he had not set his face against rum
or the introduction of slavery. This was a sad falling-off from the
ideals of James Oglethorpe and John Wesley, but it was a wise
concession to human weaknesses, and Whitefield, born himself in
grinding poverty, and of the poorest of the poor until his
Ordination, may have justified himself by thinking that the lot of
the negroes working in the vineyards and silk-factories of Georgia
was no worse than that of the agricultural labourers and artisans
at home; besides, there was, he declared, authority for slavery in
the Bible.</p>

<p>From the vantage point of this continued and spectacular success
the one-time pot-boy took upon himself to rebuke John Wesley for
trying to discover God's Will by drawing lots. Sometimes the
answers given by the oracle invoked by these means would be wrong,
as in the prediction of martyrdom at Bristol, and Whitefield
pointed out to Wesley that, since the fault could not lie with the
Almighty, it must be in the method chosen. John took no heed of
these rebukes, was not even deeply interested in the controversy.
George Whitefield was in Georgia, and he in England, with his
exciting, absorbing work to do.</p>

<p>He finished the meeting-house at Bristol and founded there a
school for the Kingswood colliers, taking all these expenses on his
own shoulders, and trusting in the Lord to provide the means for
his own work. The Wesleys now had a certain modest income from the
sale of their books and pamphlets, and there was John's Lincoln
College Fellowship; they gave away, however, almost all their
monies, leaving nothing but what was sufficient for their modest
necessities. Charles, a simple and humble man, as the highly-gifted
so often are, made no further trouble nor offered any more
opposition to his imperious brother's will, and John went ahead on
his campaign against Satan. One of the outposts against the Devil
was the Kingswood school, the idea of which had been begun by
Whitefield, who had collected forty pounds towards it, the colliers
themselves giving upwards of twenty pounds. For the rest of the
money John made himself responsible&mdash;a heavy burden for one
already laden with the debts for the Foundry&mdash;but he had that
happy combination of daring in design and prudence in execution
that makes for steady success; his ideas were large and boldly
undertaken, but to the smallest detail of his schemes he gave exact
care; his accounts were precisely kept, and every halfpenny was
entered.</p>

<p>He had passed through his storm and darkness, the future lay
serene before him. He had his work in his own hands. Sophie Hopkey
was forgotten, the memory of the Georgia humiliations had vanished;
he had obtained faith and discovered how to inspire that intangible
quality by method; he was free from the Church, from the
Calvinists, from the Moravians; Charles, who had been rebellious,
was subdued; Whitefield could go his own way in peace; John had
found himself, his power over men, his
self-sufficiency&mdash;henceforth the issue was clear between God
and John Wesley.</p>

<p>He was now set upon a path chosen deliberately and with much
agony. It was thorny enough and full of pitfalls, snares, and
stumbling-stones to satisfy even one who thirsted after martyrdom.
Not only were there the attacks from the unbelievers, Atheists, and
libertines with which English society was riddled; not only were
the orthodox clergy arrayed against this man, who in their opinion
had no right to preach without a parish, but there were dissensions
among the brethren themselves, and the love-feasts in the Fetter
Lane Society, founded by Peter Baler, sometimes belied their name;
but John Wesley threw himself into his work with an excess of
energy that can only be described as fury. He had subdued his body
to his wish, making it a perfect instrument that was able to endure
discomfort, excess of heat and cold, semi-starvation, a modicum of
sleep, and a perpetual activity. His spirit, too, had been subdued,
and all his deep emotionalism, thwarted in seeking a natural
outlet, canalized into this one wrestle with God for the souls of
his fellow-me&mdash;his own, as he now tried to force himself to
believe, being safe.</p>

<p>His attitude was, indeed, the only logical one that a Christian
priest could assume. It was beautifully and touchingly expressed by
the blessed John Southworth, when he stood, on that stormy and
rainy day, on the scaffold at Tyburn, explaining to that awed and
reverent multitude about the gallows how he, a man of stainless
life and known piety, came to die publicly and
violently:&mdash;</p>

<p>I was sent by my lawful superiors to teach Christ's
faith&mdash;not to meddle among any temporal affairs. Christ sent
His apostles, His disciples, their successor&mdash;and their
successors me. I did what I was commanded by them who had power to
command me, being ever taught that I ought to obey them in matters
ecclesiastical. I had permission to do it from him to whom our
Saviour, his predecessor St. Peter, gave power to send others to
propagate his faith. Christ Himself said: "He that will be My
disciple let him take up his cross and follow Me." My faith is my
crime, the performance of my duty the occasion of my
condemnation.</p>

<p>This was, in the main, also the apologia of John Wesley. He
could not conscientiously do otherwise than he did, once convinced
that he had the divine command to go abroad and propagate the
Gospel, or, as he would put it, "to save souls." By intense labours
of body, mind, and spirit he had, as it were, at last wrested from
God this permission to act as His messenger, and his
self-assurance, his self-complacency, swelled with his conviction.
His genius for government and organization, equal, as Lord Macaulay
said, to that of Cardinal Richelieu, found its development, though
gradually, in the service of his newly-grasped faith. Once he was
sure he was divinely inspired, he could feel no shame or timidity
in forcing his ideas on other people.</p>

<p>Under this disguise of divine inspiration his human wish to rule
and govern was indulged; he overbore, alarmed, intimidated by his
intense energy and his strong mental powers. For the Society in
Fetter Lane he drew up rules that probed with merciless precision
into the souls of the brothers and sisters, and those who hoped to
join them. These questions were asked at the weekly
meetings:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">What sin have you committed since our last
meeting? What temptation have you met with? How were you delivered?
What have you thought, said, or done, of which you doubt whether it
be sin or not? Have you nothing you desire to keep secret?</p>

<p><br>
The Anglican Bishops could not remain indifferent to this new
force within the Church, or, as the alarmed Samuel Wesley soon
thought, this new force without the Church, for the orthodox
schoolmaster feared that if his brothers were not excommunicated,
they would excommunicate themselves from the Anglican fold.</p>

<p>Summoned before Dr. Edmund Gibson, the Bishop of London, a man
not without intolerance, whom Sir Robert Walpole had allowed, it
was complained, "the authority of a Pope," Charles and John Wesley
endeavoured to explain their convictions and why they preached
justification by faith only. The brothers silenced the Bishop with:
"Can anyone preach otherwise who agrees to the Scriptures?" and the
interview ended with Dr. Gibson's telling them, with an air of
armed neutrality, that "he could not decide if religious societies
were conventicler, that they had better examine the law of the
subject for themselves."</p>

<p>The Bishop of London took no action against the Methodists, but
there was a growing storm against them, and they were attacked in
several well-known pulpits by many of the foremost preachers of the
day. Their claim to be in a state of spiritual salvation through
conversion was much disliked, one preacher saying that: "To make
such a profession savours of spiritual pride and must produce evil
results."</p>

<p>Strange tales of the Wesleys' behaviour in Georgia began to blow
abroad. "These fanatics," as they were roundly called, used, it was
said, to sleep under trees, and feed on boiled maize salted with
the ashes of oak leaves, and run about in dried skins like the
savages; while the lurid rumours that their bedchambers might be
found garnished with bowls of blood drawn from their own veins to
cool themselves gained credence. None of this in the least
disturbed the hardness that concealed the emotionalism of John
Wesley, who was not even moved by the extreme agitation of Samuel,
and his continual letters of protest about this "extravagance" from
Blundell's.</p>

<p>But John Wesley had accepted slander and persecution as part of
his lifework; he even rejoiced in them. Whoever heard of an
Evangelist or Saint who made his way without opposition? His
intense mental and physical activity as well as his pride was
pleased and excited by the powerful opposition he was arousing; if
he had had none, he would have felt like a general who goes to
battle and finds no foe.</p>

<p>At the end of 1739, Samuel, the master of Blundell's, died,
still harshly estranged from his brothers, whose extraordinary
behaviour he viewed with suspicion and disgust, and making himself
a laudable Christian death-bed. John and Charles had no time to
spare lamenting one who they believed was waiting for them in the
heavenly city, and continued on their way with the momentum of
stones hurled from slings. John Wesley had long ceased to regret
Sophie Hopkey, to recall the temptations that had come to him under
the hot, stormy skies of Georgia, even to remember the sharp
unbelief that had come to him on board the <i>Samuel</i> in the
Atlantic tempest. All his gifts, his emotions, his ambitions were
now fused. He was at one with himself, therefore in harmony with
everything about him. With a firm hand he began to purge the little
society in Fetter Lane that he visited during the intervals of his
whirlwind revivalist campaign. He was afraid of no one. His native
courage had returned in full force, sharpened and purified by the
fire of suffering through which he had passed. His mother continued
his guide and counsellor. She declared that during a communion
service she too had felt the delicious pangs of conversion, and
that, until she was seventy years old, she had never been a true
Christian. She encouraged him in all he did, and it was the only
feminine encouragement he had ever required. There began to be
differences with Charles; but John was equal to that too. Charles
was not ambitious. He regretted the quieter days of the Holy Club,
and the elaborate if obsolete ritual in which the members had
indulged. He did not like the noisy preaching, the hysterical
conversions, and he began to advocate that quietism that the
Moravians had long before suggested to John. He agreed that "Be
still and know that I am God" was an admirable text, but did not
wish it to be applied to his followers, whom he desired to be up
and doing in the Lord's sight.</p>

<p>Charles would not submit; there was a touch of the mystic in his
poetic temperament that was not in the least understood by his
elder brother, and that urged Charles away from public
extravagances into the inner sanctuary of soul, but John was not
going to be hampered by this heresy; he loved Charles and would
always love him, but Methodism belonged to him and he could rule
the thing that he had made.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>
DEMONOLOGY.</h2>

<p class="first">
SAMUEL WESLEY died as John was entering his kingdom, and Keziah
was miserably ailing, while Mrs. Wesley weakened daily in her
London rooms; but John had deliberately loosened his human
affections. A thin love like winter sunshine he shed over all the
world, but there was no warm, coloured love for his family or
friends. His egotism was intact, at one with the God he had
created; why should he mourn those who were safe in Heaven? His
work became more and more delightful and absorbing; the Foundry to
him was more than a church; it was a fort, a palace, as much the
sign and symbol of his authority as the Vatican is that of the Pope
of Rome; the possession of it increased his moral and mental
stature.</p>

<p>He began to preach in the rough, half-ruined place to the
poorest type of congregation, before it was put into repair; while
these startling innovations, which seemed like preparations to
found another Church, attracted widespread and alarmed attention;
but John Wesley serenely wrote after the break with the
Moravians&mdash;"the people deeply convinced of sin and earnestly
groaning for redemption gathered together to help each other to
work out their own salvation," and steadily completed his immense
organization. When the Foundry was firmly established, he returned
to travelling up and down the country, the preaching in field and
meeting-house that he was to continue for the rest of his life, and
directed the publication of his own writings, those of Charles and
others, with steady industry, thus mercilessly bombarding the enemy
with the spoken and the written word.</p>

<p>John Wesley had now his theatre and his audience, but somewhat
lacked, however, actors to entertain these. He was himself cast for
the principal role, but, as there was a natural limit even to his
energy and even to his power of hastening from place to place, he
needed assistance. Anglican clergy were difficult to procure, and
he had cut himself off from the Moravians. The expedient of lay
preachers soon presented itself; the first of these was a pious
Quaker, by name of John Cennick; idle, eccentric, and emotional,
this man underwent an experience similar to that gone through by
John Bunyan. Walking once in Cheapside, he felt such a sudden
conviction of the reality of Hell that he gave up most of the
ordinary human comforts in order to try to save his soul; rejecting
dry bread as too luxurious, he tried to feed on husks and grass.
This mode of life soon produced the desired result; Cennick
underwent a conversion and became a travelling preacher. He also
wrote a number of hymns that he sent to Charles Wesley to correct
for the press. John Wesley heard of the activity and piety of
Cennick, saw him at Reading, and made him master of the school just
then opened in Kingswood; Wesley met both Cennick and the other
famous lay preacher, Howel Harris, in Bristol, and there was a
moving prayer-meeting with the three evangelists on their knees in
spiritual communion.</p>

<p>Harris returned to Wales, and Cennick continued to preach in
Bristol; soon after, another young man, Thomas Maxfield, began
reading sermons to the colliers, and coming to London soon after,
asked Wesley's permission to preach. At first this was refused, for
Wesley felt that lay preachers were a startling innovation, but old
Mrs. Wesley with the icy tones of a sibyl declared that "the divine
spirit was moving in Thomas Maxfield, and that he was not to be
silenced." Two other lay preachers, Richards and Westall, were then
added to Wesley's lieutenants. By this means he again showed
himself independent of the Church of England; not only could he do
without her pulpits, he could contrive without her preachers. He
did not need ordained clergy trained in colleges. If he had waited
for these, and if he had waited for a hearing in the Anglican
churches, the whole movement must have fallen to the ground, but
having obtained a large meeting-house in London, and a smaller
meeting-house in Bristol, having inaugurated field-preaching, and
having engaged the services of all the enthusiastic, pious, and
eloquent men who liked to submit themselves to his rule, Wesley had
laid the foundation-stone of the success of his movement.
Naturally, the clergy, and even a large number of the lay public,
were shocked and horrified at these innovations; the Bishop of
Armagh told Charles Wesley that the most amazing thing in the
amazing conduct of the brothers was their employing laymen, but
Charles countered: "My Lord, that fault is yours, because you hold
your peace, and the stones cry out." The Bishop then objected that
these preachers were unlearned men. "Some are," said Charles, "but
the dumb ass rebukes the prophet."</p>

<p>Ministrations in the gaol and to the most wretched and outcast
were the noblest of the works the Wesleys undertook; the purest and
most beautiful aspect of their religion and the most touching
functions of the priesthood were displayed in the piety and courage
with which these two gently-bred men, both refined, one with a
poetical temperament, the other fastidiously dainty, descended into
the unspeakable filth and the incredible misery that were an
eighteenth-century gaol. Amid darkness, filth, contagion,
surrounded with shocking and degrading sights, John and Charles
preached a God of love and ultimate salvation, through belief, to
the victims of a brutal social system and a ferocious law.</p>

<p>Both these they accepted: although the Wesleys had warmly
seconded Oglethorpe's attempts to reform the prisons, they were not
themselves reformers; they did not inquire into the justice or
injustice of the sentences under which these wretches lay; their
duty was to try to save their souls and to send them into eternity,
into which they were hurled at a rope's end, with the hope of
Paradise before their eyes.</p>

<p>Charles could say "that hour under the gallows was the most
blessed hour of my life," and mark that of one batch of condemned
men "none skewed any natural terror of death; no fear, no crying,
no tears."</p>

<p>Touching and dreadful scenes of hysteria often followed these
ministrations to condemned prisoners; they who had spent their
lives in vice and crime were deeply moved at this loving attention
voluntarily given by men so much their superiors. The Wesleys did
not hesitate to accompany the condemned men in the cart to Tyburn,
to pray and sing with them to the end, to stand under the gallows
uttering words of hope and consolation to the last or to sit on the
rude coffins that were to hold the broken remains of a thief or a
murderer, or to press to their bosoms the ragged and despairing
figures of those who at the end of misspent lives were suddenly
convinced of a glorious world to come. Charles in particular often
exhausted himself on these terrible journeys, but felt
overwhelmingly rewarded by the ecstasy of happiness that he was
usually able to bring to those to whom everyone else meted out
punishments and insults.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Methodists at the foot of the gallows did
not, however, attract so much popular attention as the phenomena
that took place at their meetings, and that gave them all the name
of enthusiasts and caused them to be associated with credulity,
superstition, and many subjects very odious in the popular mind,
all manner of witchcraft, sorcery, satanic possession, all the
phantasmagoria that arises from the dark recesses of the mind and
trespasses on the borderland of religion. These scenes, then
inexplicable, gave rise, in the opinion of many, to the grave
suspicion that Methodism was not of God but of the Devil. It was
well known that John Wesley believed in witchcraft, and some of his
lay preachers, notably Cennick, lived in perpetual fear of ghosts
and were ready to credit any wild tale of the supernatural. Charles
from the first set his face against all these extravagances, and
continued to doubt the genuineness and to suspect the divine origin
of the displays that accompanied his brother's preachings, but John
noted them down coolly and even with relish. The mind that had
resolved, so many years ago, to accept "old Jeffrey" and the ghost
in the meadows outside Oxford was not going to question the
supernatural origin of the extraordinary displays he was able to
provoke. He could not, indeed, consistently do so, for such things
were mentioned as worthy of all credence in the Bible, and John
Wesley could feel nothing but pride and an assurance of his divine
commission when he saw he could arouse the same state in his
congregation as St. Paul had been able to arouse when preaching in
Greece of the wrath of God, the mighty angels, and the flaming
fire, that would destroy and burn the unbeliever. Why should not
the citizens of London and Bristol, the artisans of the villages,
the workers of the field, of eighteenth-century England respond to
Wesley as the Thessalonians had responded to St. Paul with agonies
of hope and terror? Nay, had not the preachings of Christ Himself
been interrupted by the shouts and cries of unclean spirits
struggling within a body that had come within reach of divine
healing power?</p>

<p>What so impressed and encouraged John Wesley and his followers,
what so shocked, startled, and bewildered his contemporaries, is no
mystery to the modern psychologist, to whom it is known as
glossolalia, or "speaking with tongues," for long supposed to
represent divine inspiration or satanic possession. This phenomenon
is far older than Christianity; instances are to be found in all
primitive religions where ritualistic orgies in honour of some
deity inevitably conclude with the display of incoherent babblings,
trances, convulsive fits, or other strange and startling
manifestations of subconscious tension. Priests, sibyls,
prophetesses of all ancient faiths, had this power of working
themselves up into these ecstatic displays and often of producing
them among their congregations, while there were seldom lacking
shrewd and intelligent people standing by who were able to
interpret the incoherent mumblings uttered by priests or prophets
into some message useful to themselves or to their belief.</p>

<p>After Paul laid his hands upon them "they spoke with tongues and
prophesied," and such displays of voluble ecstasy, so impressive to
the credulous and the ignorant, and such a marked feature of early
Christianity, had accompanied all the revivals of the faith and all
the persecution of its martyrs. It was no wonder, then, that John
Wesley refused to listen to the scepticism of Charles or to the
reproaches of his opponents, and continued to note down with
interest and gusto the extraordinary effects that he was able to
produce in those who came to listen to him preach, effects that
were more pronounced inasmuch as his congregation was almost
entirely illiterate, a mass of people that had hardly been touched
by the Church and that had hardly heard of spiritual matters until
they had listened to the level, convincing accents of the Methodist
preachers. The luscious emotionalism of the Moravians Wesley had
himself condemned; their revelling in physical images of blood and
wounds and tears, their prolonged love-scenes, in which they swayed
together in transports of affection and religious ecstasy, were as
nothing compared to the scenes that Wesley now encountered. These
had begun as early as 1739, continued for some years while
Methodism was a novelty, and gradually died away as it became a
settled institution, though instances of them re-occurred during
the whole of Wesley's lifetime. Not only was his spiritual pride
flattered by these displays, but that intense curiosity that he had
so firmly diverted from science and philosophy was gratified, and
his own hungry and thwarted emotionalism, which had been kept so
well under control, vicariously sated by his observation, which
seemed so cool and detached, of these extraordinary scenes of
hysteria. In calm, almost in dry language, he described some of
these scenes:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">At Baldwin Street we called upon God to
confirm His Word. Immediately, one who stood by cried out loud with
the utmost vehemence, even as in the agonies of death. We continued
in prayer, till a new song was put into her mouth of thanksgiving
unto our God. Soon after two other persons were seized with a
strong pain, and were constrained to roar for the disquiet of their
hearts, but it was not long before they likewise burst forth into
praise of God their Saviour. The last to call upon God as out of
the belly of Hell was a stranger in Bristol, and in a short space
he also was overwhelmed with joy and love, knowing that God had
healed his backsliding, and at Weaver Fall a young man was suddenly
seized with a violent trembling all over, and in a few minutes sunk
to the ground. We ceased not calling upon God till he raised him up
full of peace and joy and the Holy Ghost. At Baldwin Street, a
young man, after a sharp though short agony, both of mind and body,
found himself so filled with peace, knowing in whom he had
believed.</p>

<p><br>
Even more terrible scenes took place when Wesley and his brother
were preaching in Newgate, when, casting back the auburn locks from
his brow, John Wesley fixed his gleaming eyes on the rows of
prisoners and called to God to "bear witness to his Word."
Immediately one, then another, and another sank to the earth. They
dropped on every side as thunderstruck. One of them cried aloud:
"He besought God in her behalf and he turned her heaviness into
joy." A second being in the same agony, he called upon God for her
also. He brought peace unto her soul. "All Newgate rang with the
cries of those whom the Word of God cut to the heart." Two of them
were in a moment filled with joy, to the astonishment of those that
beheld them. A woman broke out with strong cries and tears, great
drops of sweat ran down her face and all her bones shook; both her
body and soul were healed in a moment.</p>

<p>Wesley noted that at some of the meetings his voice could
scarcely be heard amid the groanings and the cries. A Quaker who
had looked contemptuously at the display dropped down as if
thunderstruck, and the agony he was in was terrible to behold. Once
John Wesley noted "three persons almost at once sunk down as dead
having all their sins set in array before them. Women, boys, and
middle-aged men began beating their breasts, crying about their
sins and falling down in convulsions; the preacher was vexed with
those people who, though they had seen signs and wonders, would not
believe." They could not, indeed, deny the sights, but they could
explain them away. Some said these were purely natural effects,
that people fainted only from the heat and the closeness of the
room. Others said the hysteria was all a cheat; they might help it
if they would. These disbelievers were confounded, to Wesley's
triumphant satisfaction, when the phenomena began to take place at
the open-air meetings, when the Lord began to make bare His arm,
not in a close room, neither in private, but in the open air, and
before more than twenty thousand witnesses. One, then another and
another were struck to the earth and seized with trembling in the
presence of His power. One cried, with a loud and bitter cry: "'
What must we do to be saved?' And in less than an hour seven
persons wholly unknown to me till that time were rejoicing and
singing with all their might, and giving thanks to the God of their
salvation. Others dropped down as dead. Thomas Maxfield began to
roar out, beat himself against the ground, so that six men could
scarcely hold him." John had seen both hysteria and
epilepsy&mdash;these convulsions were, he said, different.</p>

<p>George Whitefield, disappointed, perhaps, that no such effects
were produced by his magnificent preaching, although he was able to
coax the money out of the pocket of the unbeliever and tears out of
the eyes of the unrepentant, wrote to Wesley:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Honoured Sir, I cannot take it right in you to
give so much encouragement to these convulsions which people have
been thrown into under your ministry...<br>
<br>
I think it is tempting God to require such signs. That there is
something of God in it I doubt not, but the Devil I believe
interposes.</p>

<p><br>
John Wesley had a meeting with Whitefield on this subject when
he returned from Georgia, and was able partly to convince him,
largely because, for the first and it would seem the last time, the
sermon that Whitefield delivered immediately afterwards was
accompanied by the sight of four persons sinking down, trembling
violently in convulsions and groanings. It is probable that Wesley
was present; Whitefield was silenced by this display and by
Wesley's argument that God might be left to carry on His own work
in the way that pleased Him.</p>

<p>The great attraction of Methodism was that it brought
companionship, hope, and comfort to the outcast and to the
wretched. Those people&mdash;with whom none had ever concerned
themselves before and who found unexpected delight in gathering
together, in attracting the interested attention of preachers and
teachers, in discussing with one another their hopes and fears and
the state of their souls&mdash;found themselves for the first time
important, in their own eyes and in those of other people.
Thousands joined the Methodists, not because of sincere religious
conviction but through loneliness, misery, and that desire to be in
intimacy with one another which causes people so readily to form
societies and clubs.</p>

<p>John Wesley was so powerful an organizer, White-field so
seductive a preacher, and Charles Wesley so sincere a lover of his
kind, and had so many willing and talented helpers, that the
structure they formed was a solid one, and Methodism was
established to endure probably as long as Protestantism. It may be
questioned, however, whether more than the formula remained after
the direct influence of the Wesleys and Whitefield was withdrawn.
The set of rules was there; those who wished to might follow it.
Earnest and talented men might now and then interpret them again
with force and persuasion, and cause a revival among those who
founded themselves on revivalism, but what could Methodism be but
another freshet to the stream of Protestant sectarianism? But were
these followers of John Wesley, in the main, better citizens, more
worthy human beings than those who had escaped enthusiasm? The
virtues of Methodism, which were the virtues of its creator, soon
sharpened into vices. Conviction became intolerance, the sense of
divine guidance became arrogance, simplicity became ignorance,
austerity became fanaticism, living by rule meant a severe and
merciless system to enforce those rules, sometimes espionage,
sometimes tyranny.</p>

<p>While the narrowing down of life to a preparation for Heaven,
and the putting aside of every interest and energy save those that
would conduce towards eternal salvation, were a logical outcome of
Christianity, they led to a narrow, joyless, repellent creed, which
deliberately closed the eyes of its followers, and not only their
eyes, but their hearts and spirits, against almost everything that
made for human satisfaction, happiness, and nobility. It was,
indeed, difficult for even a man of the power of John Wesley to
induce anybody but the illiterate and the wretched to embrace such
beliefs, and those who were fairly comfortable in their fortunes
and fairly easy in their minds preferred the vague emotionalism of
George Whitefield, who belonged to no definite sect, who founded no
society, and who did not require the observance of any rigorous
rules from his adherents.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm touched the members of the Wesley family. John and
Charles did their best to convert their unhappy brother-in-law,
who, alternating between the intoxication of alcohol and that of
Methodism, passed his time between bouts of drunkenness and bouts
of repentance. Westley Hall, however, escaped the influence of the
brothers, and went farther and farther into that eccentricity that
was to end in the acceptance of a doctrine of all others horrible
to Christians&mdash;polygamy. His wife Martha, Emilia, the decaying
schoolmistress, Keziah, who had always felt she was marked for an
early death, all became obsessed by religious enthusiasm and
melancholia and were entirely under the influence of their powerful
brothers, while Hetty, who had been delivered by the fanaticism of
her father to the power of a brutal sot, found dismal consolation
in Methodism.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1741 Kezzy died of a wasting disease brought on
by melancholia and an unhealthy life; the influence of her powerful
brothers had easily swayed her to their convictions; Charles
especially laboured for her salvation, causing her "floods of
tears" and earnest hopes of God's "personal acceptance." In the
poor room where the charity of the family kept her, Kezzy threw
herself, weeping, upon her brother's shoulder, or knelt beside him
while he prayed for her; it was not, however, until after some
weeks of these dreadful scenes of terror and distress that Charles
himself became converted, and thus was able to speak with
conviction to the dying girl of trust in the atonement of Christ;
for a while Kezzy still shuddered before the horror of Hell,
muttering: "I am weak, I am exceedingly weak." William Law's
<i>Redemption</i> and Pascal's prayer for conversion were listened
to eagerly by Kezzy, but only increased her hysteria; she even
argued against conversion by faith only. "In the next world," cried
the tormented woman, "you will know if I have faith!" At last her
feebleness of body clouded her mind, and, half-delirious, she
declared that she felt a spiritual quickening, and died in a state
of excitement that was supposed to prove that she was saved from
Hell; her physical sufferings were so obvious that even Charles
wrote that the Lord Jesus "had cut short His work in mercy."</p>

<p>A few months after the death of Kezzy, the surviving children of
Susanna Wesley were called to the Foundry to attend the death-bed
of their mother. Susanna Wesley had been for some time failing; she
"was like a child," she said, with regard to her own infirmities,
but her keen mind and dominant will had remained unaltered. As her
illness increased she had endured a "few mental conflicts," but
John hurried back from Bristol, after being told that she was on
"the brink of eternity"; he found her sweetly resigned and that the
enemy had no more power to hurt her.</p>

<p>John and the daughters, Anne, Emilia, Hetty, Patty, and Sukey,
sat round the modest bed in the bare room above the school-house in
the Foundry, and sang hymns as the stalwart old woman fixed her
clouding mind on that reward for which she had so long laboured.
John Wesley thus describes the death-bed of the human being who had
influenced him more than any other:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">She continued in just the same way as my
father was, struggling and gasping for life, though, if I could
judge by several signs, perfectly sensible until near four o'clock.
I was then going to drink a dish of tea, being faint and weary,
when one called me again to the bedside. It was just four o'clock;
she opened her eyes wide, fixed them upwards for a moment, then the
lids dropped, the soul was set at liberty without one struggle or
groan or sigh. We stood around the bed to fulfil her last request,
uttered a little before she lost her speech: "Children, as soon as
I am released, sing a song of praise to God."</p>

<p><br>
Her children had never disobeyed Susanna Wesley. Dark-faced,
haggard men and women of middle age, they stood round her still,
shrunken body in the gloomy, serge-curtained bed and sang, as she
had commanded them, as meekly as they stood round her knee in
Epworth parsonage to recite their prayers. Praise to God! For what?
The answer is to be fund in the hymns that Charles wrote in memory
or his mother and her last request; the drab gloom of their creed
is shown in the pitiful emphasis on the word release:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">Lo! the prisoner is released,<br>
Lightened of her fleshly load.<br>
Where the weary are at rest<br>
She is gathered unto God!</p>

<p><br>
Fifteen years before the death of Susanna Wesley, her son John
had expressed a fear that she would die before him. She had replied
in a tone of rebuke: "You did well to correct that fond desire of
dying before me, since you do not know what work God may have for
you ere you do leave the world."</p>

<p>Now he could remember those words and think of her as a
prophetess; there was work for him to do, and he was capable of
doing it; it was not a sad or downcast man that turned from the
death-bed of his beloved mother.</p>

<p>A week after her death she was buried in Bunhill-Fields
Burying-ground, where John Bunyan and Daniel Defoe already lay, and
John Wesley preached over her open grave, on the splendid terrors
of the resurrection day. A plain stone with: "Here lies the body of
Mrs. Susanna Wesley, youngest and last surviving daughter of Dr.
Samuel Annesley," was set above her grave. But some verses were
written in her honour:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">In sure and steadfast hope to rise,<br>
And claim her mansion in the skies,<br>
A Christian here her Cross laid down,<br>
The Cross exchanging for a crown.<br>
<br>
The daughter of affliction, she,<br>
Inur'd to pain and misery,<br>
Mourn'd a long life of grief and tears,<br>
A legal night of seventy years.<br>
<br>
The Father then revealed his Son,<br>
Him in the broken bread made known,<br>
She knew and felt her sins forgiven,<br>
And found the earnest of her Heaven.<br>
<br>
Meet for the fellowship above,<br>
She heard the call&mdash;"Arise, my love!"<br>
"I come," her dying looks replied,<br>
And lamblike, as her Lord, she died.</p>

<br>

<p>This revolting doggerel, quoted with approval by John in his
Journal, shows that the pride of the evangelist had overruled the
affection of the son, for it puts on record the darkness and
potential damnation of the pious matron, until Methodism rescued
her at the age of seventy years.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>
SELINA HASTINGS,COUNTESS OF HUNTINGDON.</h2>

<p class="first">
WHILE John Wesley, the self-controlled, self-disciplined man,
was taking such practical and active steps to organize Methodism,
George Whitefield, returning triumphant from Georgia, was arousing
the people to furies of emotionalism, as disgusting to one half of
the nation as it was attractive to the other half; nor was he
inactive in the vigorous paper warfare that Methodism had aroused.
He published his autobiography under the title of <i>A Short
Account of God's Dealings with the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield,
B.A., late of Pembroke College, Oxford, from his infancy to the
time of his entering into Holy Orders.</i> This was one of the
first of those confessions in which the author claims to strip
himself of all pretence, and even of all decency, for the
edification of his readers, but in reality qualifies a morbid
egotism. Whitefield in his desire to glorify his God could not
debase himself sufficiently, and he revelled in describing what he
termed with relish "the sins of his youth and childhood," and he
pointed out triumphantly those "early stirrings of corruption" in
him that were quite sufficient proof that he was conceived and born
in sin. With gusto, too, he related the temptations, by no means
always resisted, of his life as a tapster in Gloucester, his
struggles as a servitor in Pembroke College, and finally his
conversion with the subsequent salvation. This book did not do the
Methodist cause much good among the fastidious and sober-minded;
indeed, the Bishop of Exeter went so far as to call it "a perfect
Jakes of uncleanness, boyish, ludicrous, filthy, nasty, and
shameless a quite defiled the paper, and shocking to decency and
modesty."</p>

<p>But George Whitefield cared nothing for criticisms such as this.
Completely convinced of his own divine mission, enervated by the
excitement he roused wherever he went, flattered by those who did
not guess at or care about his essential ignorance or
superficiality, he began to draw the aristocracy more and more into
his congregation, as effectually as he had drawn the Kingswood
colliers, and to become as popular in the London drawing-rooms as
the Wesleys were in Newgate or the Fleet. Samuel Johnson wrote of
him that he would be followed by crowds were he "to wear a
night-cap in the pulpit or were he to preach from a tree," and this
acute critic added that Whitefield's popularity was due to "his
peculiarity of manner"; in other words, the fascination of his
personality. On his return from his second visit to America he
began to preach in a temporary tabernacle in Moorfields, at first
no more than a shed, afterwards converted into a substantial brick
building, and there he gave new vitality to a movement that had
seemed spent in England&mdash;Calvinism. He was easily the most
popular preacher in England, and his fame overshadowed that of John
Wesley, whose more substantial, quieter qualities had not such a
universal appeal and did not, oddly enough, attract those members
of the aristocracy who went in coach and sedan to Moorfields
Tabernacle to listen enthralled to the squint-eyed preacher's
dramatic declamations on the themes of death and damnation, life
and salvation. Whitefield had a peculiarly rich and fascinating
voice, which had the power of carrying to a great distance; he
concentrated on his gifts of oratory, concerning himself with
little else; his writings, prose and verse, were poor, and he did
not put nearly so much energy into either polemics or
humanitarianism as did the Wesleys, though his Georgian Orphanage
was very successful; he also permitted himself some human comforts
that the Wesleys denied themselves, indulged in cow-heel, liked his
meals served punctually, and was easily irritated though easily
soothed. In 1740 he married a strong-minded widow, Elizabeth James,
whom he had as carefully picked as Mrs. Primrose had her wedding
gown, for durable qualities; ten years her husband's senior, this
lady accompanied him on all his travels, helped to make cartridges
on one of the Georgia voyages when the ship was chased by the
enemy, and was capable of bidding the emotional, nervous George
"play the man." As he lost his first youth the plump little fellow
became corpulent and his asthma increased; it was probably
complicated, though he did not know it, with <i>angina
pectoris,</i> but Mrs. Whitefield was a good nurse, and after the
early death of her one child, devoted her not inconsiderable
energies to George. Still, though she was carefully chosen for
qualities likely to be useful to a fashionable, overworked
preacher, Whitefield was, as he precisely explained, quite free
"from that foolish passion called love," and it was enough for him
that the lady was a good nurse and a good housekeeper, and willing
not to interfere with his divine commission. She did not fit into
her difficult position with much grace or tact, and she was
regarded by Whitefield's followers as a thorn in his flesh, sent
either by the Devil to torment him or by God to keep him on the
path of duty, and one of Whitefield's disciples termed her "a
ferret," a description that brings up an unpleasant picture both of
her appearance and of her character.</p>

<p>John still set his face against marriage; in his preachings he
advocated the celibacy of the clergy, seeming to think that the
sexless or chaste priest was the ideal. He certainly did not, in
the ordinary sense of the word, require either a home or a wife. He
had settled down into that incessant travelling over England which
was to last for nearly forty years; he was indifferent to comfort,
and his body, for long hardy and wiry, seemed to become with the
passing of the years more and more immune from illness and
fatigue.</p>

<p>He did not, however, discourage female disciples, although he
was at some pains to keep their admiration within bounds. There was
no successor to Sophie Hopkey, whose name and image alike had been
erased from John Wesley's mind and heart, but there were many women
who stood to him somewhat in the relation that Varanese and Aspasia
had held so long ago on the pleasant rectory lawn, and in the
demure rectory parlour; women whose delight it was to wait on him,
to listen to him, to praise him enthusiastically, to come to him
with their troubles and perplexities. Indeed, this trembling flock
of enthusiastic female followers was one of the aspects of
Methodism that raised the most cynical smiles and the most brutal
invectives on the part of its opponents; on the part, too, of those
who were not particularly averse to Wesley and his Society, but who
delighted to think the worst of human nature. Even in the Georgia
days a charge had been brought against the brothers of having
interfered with the women, to the great disgruntling of the men,
prying too deeply for decorum and decency into feminine minds and
hearts. The same had been said of the society in Fetter Lane, and
the favourite form of caricaturing the Methodists or Enthusiasts
was to show a ranting clergyman leering at a fair and languishing
penitent.</p>

<p>If George Whitefield's marriage was not a glittering success, he
found consolation in the admiration and protection of Selina, Lady
Huntingdon, who admired him, took him under her wing, introduced
him to fashionable society, and finally made him her chaplain
(1748).</p>

<p>Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, and one of the
co-heiresses of Laurence Shirley, Earl Ferrers, had been converted
by her sister-in-law, Lady Margaret Hastings, who married Benjamin
Ingham, in the early days of the Fetter Lane Society, and she and
her husband were frequent, if not prominent, figures at their
meetings. She had for long been intimate with the Wesleys, whom she
had entertained at her seat, Donington Park, Leicestershire, but
there was no mutual fascination, although she had supported them
both in their general principles, and in such daring novelties as
employing lay preachers and field-preaching. After the split
between White-field and the Wesleys, Lady Huntingdon made a not
very vigorous attempt to heal it, but, proving unsuccessful,
identified herself passionately with the Calvinistic movement.
While the country was torn with the terrible excitement roused by
the Jacobite revolt in the north and the war abroad, while the
Wesleys and the other Methodists were being stoned and insulted as
possible followers of the Young Pretender, or stoned and abused as
possible French spies, Lady Huntingdon lost two of her sons from
small-pox and her husband, Theophilus, the ninth earl. This triple
bereavement threw her into an emotional state that found great
gratification in Whitefield's ardent outpourings; she was about
forty years of age when she was widowed, a plain woman with flabby
features, heavy-lidded eyes, an aquiline nose, and a dreamy
expression, that were no true indexes to the vigour of her
character. Even those who most admired her admitted that she was
obstinate, haughty, and dogmatic.</p>

<p>She was an ideal patroness for Whitefield; as a peeress she
claimed a right to appoint as many chaplains as she pleased, and
this enabled many Methodist clergymen to remain in the Church of
England without cures; she was a friend to the Dissenters also, and
cordially approved of Isaac Watts. When her following became too
large to be accommodated in drawing-rooms, she decided to build her
own chapel, and did so, at Brighton, paying for it by selling her
jewels. Many notable men were among her chaplains: Rowland Hill,
William Romaine, Moses Brown and the famous Swiss, Fletcher of
Madeley, who was head of the Trevecca College; Augustus Toplady,
who afterwards quarrelled so rudely with John, was among the great
lady's warmest admirers; he termed her "the most precious saint of
God he ever knew."</p>

<p>Backing her chosen cause with all her resources, Selina
gradually founded chapels in London, Brighton, Tunbridge Wells,
Bath, Bristol, Birmingham, and in several towns in the West, though
she was forced, at last, to register these under the Toleration Act
as dissenting meeting-houses, but she did not admit that she had
renounced the Church of England, though she behaved in every way as
if she were independent of that establishment, and George
Whitefield, who had been so shocked when the Wesleys appeared to be
breaking away from the Church, accepted Lady Huntingdon's
societies, colleges, ministers, and chapels.</p>

<p>While George Whitefield was being supported and encouraged by
this powerful female influence, Charles Wesley, after a good deal
of heart-searching and reluctance, decided to get married; the
proposed bride, a Miss Sally Gwynne, daughter of a well-to-do and
respected Welsh family, promised not to interfere with Charles's
preaching or habits of life. One hundred pounds a year was settled
on him out of the profits of the publications sold by the
Methodists. He on his side promised not to go again to Ireland, so
in 1749 Charles Wesley, then aged forty, married Sally Gwynne, aged
twenty-three, and set up house with her in a modest way in Bristol.
This was the one completely satisfactory marriage of the Wesley
family; Charles in late middle age found himself in a happy
domestic life. His wife was kind, affectionate, and sensible. Both
husband and wife were warm-natured, and though Sally was inevitably
pious, even fanatic, she was not dull, nor arid, nor gloomy; she
rode pillion behind her husband on his travels, and her clear, true
voice led his hymns at the meetings; she bore her husband eight
children; three survived to inherit the talents of their parents;
Charles and Samuel were infant musical prodigies, and Sarah was a
gifted example of the remarkable talent and striking characteristic
of the Wesleys.</p>

<p>Though Charles by no means slackened in his labours, this happy
marriage and absorption in the company of his wife and children
somewhat divided him from John, and accentuated the differences of
opinion between the two brothers. Charles became more and more
averse from what seemed to him a definite separation from the
Church of England, more and more doubtful of the legality of lay
preachers and field-preaching, and of the reality or usefulness of
sudden and violent conversion. What was sweet, rich, and mystical
in his nature became developed under the influence of his calm
happiness, and he approached, in the soaring enthusiasm of his
hymns and poems, to the beautiful tolerance of John Gambold, who
had become a Moravian bishop. Though he had several near escapes
from a violent death by mob violence, Charles was one of the most
respected and beloved of the Methodists; he had less of the fanatic
than either his brother or George, was more original than the
former and less theatrical than the latter; though a poet, he gave
vigorous and practical help to the humanitarian movement that was
beginning to be strengthened by the help of the various religious
societies that had existed since the days of Queen Mary II and that
revived now in the encouraging warmth and renewed an ardour that
had begun to slacken a little. Their members pressed to hear the
Wesleys when they visited their towns, and threw themselves into
good works, the most substantial of which were relieving the poor,
releasing the prison debtors, and sending poor children to
school.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br>
MARRIAGE.</h2>

<p class="first">
IN the midst of earthquake shocks that startled London in the
February of 1750 Hetty died&mdash;destroyed, like Kezzy, by
unhappiness and hardship. Her existence with her brutal husband,
who frequently dealt her blows and curses, the loss of her children
in infancy, her sordid poverty, and the frustration of her
potential gifts and capacity for happiness, had been softened only
by the blunting of her misery by the soporific of Methodism. As she
lay dying in her squalid room, watched by Charles and disturbed by
the maudlin tears of her gin-sodden tinker-husband, John was
preaching in a summer-house at Chertsey, where the beam of the
gallery cracked, without causing any hurt or confusion; three days
afterwards he returned to London for the watch night at the chapel,
and was deeply impressed by the three "distinct shakes or waverings
to and fro" of the earthquake, "attended with a hoarse rumbling
noise like thunder." The meaning of this phenomenon was clear; God
was gently warning England of her sins, and Wesley only hoped that
the nation would repent before worse followed. The shocks were
repeated for several weeks and caused a panic in London; Wesley
noticed with scorn several of the frightened rich among his
congregation and the Foundry rang with his contemptuous challenge:
"Who has warned <i>you</i> to flee from the wrath to come?" Had
London gone up in flames or been swallowed into a bottomless pit,
with only himself and the Methodists rescued, Wesley would probably
have been no more startled than when he saw a hysterical
maid-servant "roaring" at his feet, and probably the vanishing
sinners would have heard his regretful but triumphant comments in
their ears as Satan's imps seized them.</p>

<p>There was still another earthquake shock that threw down several
houses while John was preaching at the Foundry; he expected the
roof to fall, but stilled the outcry of the women and children with
an appropriate text: "Therefore will we not fear though the earth
be moved."</p>

<p>Amid these shocks and losses there was trouble with the
Moravians. Wesley read Count Zinzendorf's <i>Autobiography</i> and
did not like it. He seemed justified in his attitude towards the
Moravian leader, who, always eccentric, was now probably touched
with insanity, and whose bombastic use of his title was revolting
to the good taste and natural simplicity of the well-bred
Englishman. In the midst of this Dr. Lavington, Bishop of Exeter,
made some attacks upon the Methodists that John thought required an
answer. Whitefield, too, rushed into the fray, and the paper war
was conducted with a lack of restraint, not very creditable to any
of the combatants but very usual in this kind of polemic. John
thought that the United Brethren were allowing several
superstitious quackeries to be introduced among them, and he heard
dark stories of gross abominations practised at their services in
Leeds and Bedford.</p>

<p>Indeed, in Wesley's opinion, the Moravians were now little
better than papists, and he thought that many of Count Zinzendorf's
expressions confirmed the ugly suspicion of their sensuality; their
thoughts on marriage were "dark and mysterious," and from their own
account their hymns on this subject were not fit to be read by any
that "attach bad ideas to bad expressions."</p>

<p>In the midst of this controversy with Dr. Lavington and the
Moravians, and while he was settling the brothers and sisters in
the new church in Spitalfields, once occupied by the French
refugees, John Wesley decided upon his bride. She is an obscure
personality, and not much is known of her history before she became
Mrs. Wesley, nor is it known where her future husband met her. It
is thought that she was introduced to him by one of the Perrotts;
she was a follower of the Methodists, a merchant's widow with four
children, the youngest, Noah, only four years old, on whom her
entire fortune of 10,000 was secured. Although John was, of
course, at once accused by his enemies of marrying a wealthy widow,
he did not gain a penny piece by the marriage. The lady's name was
Mrs. Vazeille. She was middle-aged, seemed of a quiet disposition,
meek, and pious; she was neither well-educated nor intelligent and
had less than the usual share of feminine tact and duplicity;
though she was "able to accommodate herself to any company in which
she found herself."</p>

<p>Molly Vazeille was, like Pamela, a servant who had married her
master, but she had not the virtues of that fictitious heroine; her
husband had pampered her and she had been put to no test of
character. She was well off and pious, because a widow could be
little else without causing scandal, and Molly was orthodox with
the orthodoxy of the stupid female who thinks her dignity is one
with her respectability. She had joined the Methodists, as so many
women did, for the pleasure of cosy tea-drinkings with
fellow-sinners and that delightful meddling with other people's
business which is so delicious to her type when glossed over with
religion. John stayed at her house, found her easy, deferential,
ardent in good works, a not unworthy successor to his other
diaphanous loves. Molly's bland features looked out from a huge
pleated cap; she was modestly swathed to the neck in crape, with
black robes and sad-coloured shawls. In this attire, suggestive
both of the grave and of the angelic garments of the heavenly
hosts, women surely looked their best. John, who dreaded fine
ladies and painted <i>belles,</i> found these meek, drab widows the
acme of feminine perfection. Considering her coldly, he thought
that she would make a good wife, as he understood that term. He
stayed in her house, and she listened to him with the deference due
to one who held a commission from God, who was able to work
miracles and who was attended by a number of guardian angels, who
if they sometimes nodded and allowed devils to push John
downstairs, yet were quite ready to snatch him up before he bruised
himself at the bottom.</p>

<p>John, always "wondrous clean" and neat, had hardened into a
figure symbolic of godliness to the entire country and was as
familiar to the population as the weather-beaten visage and
pale-blue oyster eyes of His German Majesty. The evangelist had,
indeed, an almost heraldic significance; nothing could have been
better publicity for his cause than his appearance: the black
clerical clothes, the spotless linen bands, the serene countenance
with the smooth hair&mdash;the auburn now dashed with
grey&mdash;curling on his shoulders. His small compact figure had
remained elastic and upright, his complexion was a girlish pink and
white, and his cool, brilliant eyes retained that steady,
commanding glance so startlingly at variance with the fixed simper
on his thin, clear-cut mouth. Hundreds of prints, caricatures,
paintings on china, busts, stamps, and medallions had made this
impressive yet dainty countenance familiar all over the country,
about which John travelled incessantly&mdash;at the rate, he
reckoned, of never less than four thousand five hundred miles a
year, ambling along on a nag, guided no doubt miraculously on its
way, while he read or sang, his flat three-cornered hat pulled over
his sharp eyes, a bag of pamphlets and his travelling desk strapped
to his saddle. In the opinion of Molly Vazeille he was a great man
indeed; besides, her servant-girl's mind was impressed by his
gentility, his culture, his learning. She saw he was looking for a
wife and she resolved to have him; he, for his part, wanted to
marry and believed that Mrs. Vazeille was well fitted to be his
companion, while he certainly felt tenderness for her and she was
able to assume, when in his presence, that timid air of docile
femininity which so attracted him. That she had a bad temper, was
jealous, spiteful, and essentially vulgar, he never suspected.</p>

<p>John Wesley had no home of his own, only the bare rooms above
the schoolroom in the Foundry, and when he slipped on the ice,
crossing London Bridge, and sprained his leg, it was to Mrs.
Vazeille's home in Threadneedle Street that he was taken. For a
week he was confined to bed and she nursed him, while he occupied
himself with writing a Hebrew grammar and lessons for children. The
first Sunday after his accident he was carried to the Foundry and
preached kneeling. Before he had recovered, he had quietly married
the widow&mdash;February 18, 1751, according to <i>The Gentleman's
Magazine.</i></p>

<p>Charles had not been told of the marriage until it was
accomplished. When he did learn of it he took it very ill. Not only
did he still believe that his brother would be more useful to
Methodism as a single man, but he did not approve of Mrs. Vazeille,
who seemed to him the last woman in the world to satisfy his
brother's peculiar need. He had some acquaintance with the lady,
with whom he and his wife had stayed in London, and in his
note-book he wrote: "My brother told me he was resolved to marry. I
was thunderstruck and retired to mourn with my faithful Sally. I
groaned all the day and several following ones. Under my own and
the people's burden, I could eat no food, nor preach, nor rest,
either by night or day." John, however, was calm. He was clearly
convinced that he ought to marry, that he would be more useful to
God in a married state. Yet, a few days after his own marriage, he
called together the single brethren of the London Society to preach
to them the desirability of remaining celibate, unless there was a
special reason for marriage.</p>

<p>He continued to be crippled for some time, but as soon as he was
able to get on horseback, he set out for Bristol, with his bride on
the pillion behind him, leaving Charles to groan and the other
Methodists to think what they would of this strange, hasty
marriage. A resignation of his Fellowship of Lincoln College
followed immediately and left him so much the poorer. A few weeks
after the marriage Charles met the strange couple and found it
difficult to be civil towards his sister-in-law. However, he tried
to behave to her with Christian forbearance, and she was shallow
enough to weep and complain in front of him about her husband's
faults. Yet, shortly afterwards, they quarrelled, and John Wesley
found himself surrounded with dissension; his wife's money affairs
were also a trouble to him. There was the question of the
Threadneedle establishment and the education of the four children
to be settled, and all this business fell upon him. Still, she
remained with him, travelling with him round the Northern circuit,
then into wild Cornwall, and then with one of her daughters round
the North again. This was a strange life for the cosy wife of a
London merchant, used to all the comforts that the capital
afforded; the ways were rough, the people they met savage, there
were often scenes of violence and bloodshed, of robbery and riots,
and the horseback journey over the rude roads or cart-tracks was
exhausting and often perilous; Mrs. Wesley did not adapt herself
graciously to this kind of life. It was, perhaps, too much to
expect that a woman of her age and custom could have done so. But
she knew when she married John Wesley what was before her, and now
she did nothing but complain as if she had been deceived. Towards
the Methodists in the various schools, societies, and centres she
conducted herself peevishly and haughtily. John bore with meekness
this increasing discomfort of his wife's temper and whining by
taking up the attitude that the lady had been sent him as a cross
by the Lord. He repeatedly told his followers that he believed that
God had ordained this painful business for his own good and that,
if Mrs. Wesley had been a better wife, he might have been
unfaithful in the great work to which God had called him and might
have been too much inclined "to treat her according to her own
views."</p>

<p>As it was, he had enough on his mind to prevent him from paying
many attentions to his wife, even if she had been minded to receive
them, and in truth she offered him little comfort. And such was the
state of dissension in which John and his Molly lived that when
John, in 1753, thought himself on his deathbed from consumption,
his last wish was that Charles and his wife should become
reconciled. His brother promised this and again offered Mrs. Wesley
his service and all his heart, but how the lady received the
overture we are not told.</p>

<p>John, who had not escaped several minor illnesses, despite a
liberal use of his own medicines, of which a favourite one was
treacle and brown paper bound on the affected part, caught a
violent feverish cold, perhaps influenza, that he believed was
"consumption." A high bitter wind chilling him as he rode in an
open chaise was too much even for Dr. Fothergill's prescriptions,
and John had some ugly symptoms: a cough, pains, a temperature; he
continued preaching, however, though burnt with fever, and his
voice was so hoarse that few could hear him. Dr. Fothergill then
ordered him country air, asses' milk, and daily riding, but Wesley
had to leave London in a coach, being too ill to sit in the saddle.
He believed that he was dying and, still preoccupied with himself,
wrote his own epitaph, in order, he declared and perhaps thought,
to prevent "vile panegyric," but really because he could not endure
to be cheated out of the last word on the subject of John Wesley.
Remembering with pride the miracle that had saved him at Epworth
Rectory and his noble poverty, he wrote with a fever-shaken
hand:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">
HERE LIETH<BR>
THE BODY OF JOHN WESLEY.<br>
A BRAND PLUCKED OUT OF THE BURNING.<br>
WHO DIED OF A CONSUMPTION,<br>
IN THE FIFTY-FIRST YEAR OF HIS AGE.<br>
NOT LEAVING, AFTER HIS DEBTS WERE PAID,<br>
TEN POUNDS BEHIND HIM; PRAYING,<br>
GOD BE MERCIFUL TO ME AN UNPROFITABLE SERVANT,<br>
HE ORDERED THAT THIS, IF ANY INSCRIPTION,<br>
SHOULD BE PLACED ON HIS TOMBSTONE.</p>

<br>

<p>A concoction of powdered stone brimstone mixed with white of egg
applied to his side delayed Wesley's entry into Heaven, but the
epitaph was too good to lose, and he copied it into his Journal,
unaware how the unconscious use of the word "ordered" cancelled the
false humility of the others.</p>

<p>After this setback John was soon on the road again preaching in
"Satan's own ground," a theatre, and remarking of a
fellow-traveller to whom a large estate had fallen: "A miracle if
it does not drown her soul in everlasting perdition!" while a
perusal of <i>Mr. Baxter's History of the Councils</i> caused him
to reflect what "execrable wretches" had governed the Roman Church
and to apply to the Romanists criticisms that might have been
directed to his own sect, "trifling, false, unintelligible,
self-contradictory." His marriage was by then an open, disastrous
failure, though John, at least, maintained a show of outward
tenderness. In the first letter John had written to her after their
marriage he had addressed her as "Dear Love" and had told her that
she had "surely a right to every proof of love I can give and to
all the little help which is within my power." But this affection
had been worn thin by her raving, complaints, and general
unsuitability, and he had after addressed her in a firmer tone: "Be
content to be a private and insignificant person, known and loved
by God and me. Leave me to be governed by God and my conscience.
Then shall I govern you with gentle sway, to show that I do,
indeed, love you, even as Christ the Church."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Wesley's bitterest complaint was that he loved other
women as Christ the Church. She could have borne
everything&mdash;the tedious, tiresome, perilous journeys, the mob,
now endeavouring to attack her and her husband, now roaring in the
throes of conversion, endless prayer-meetings, sermons, perpetual
scenes of recrimination, hysteria, and noisy excitement that split
the societies and the chapels that Wesley visited, the
controversies with the Moravians, the gentle bickering with
Whitefield and the Calvinists, the attacks from members of the
Church of England. All this hurly-burly of her odd life Mrs. Wesley
could have endured and perhaps even enjoyed, and taken part in as
wife of the great leader of the Methodists, but it was the other
women that soured her beyond endurance. Molly Wesley, before her
marriage, had heard the usual gossiping and tattlings about
Wesley's relations with some of the more sentimental and amorous of
his female disciples; after marriage she had to endure, when he
preached at the various meeting-houses and schools, to see him
surrounded by a crowd of flattering, often hysterical females, and
to note the tenderness and kindness with which he received these
ecstatic praises.</p>

<p>Under this strain, poor Molly took the usual course of a
petty-minded, jealous woman, and began to steal and sometimes to
intercept his correspondence. The loving tone of the letters from
the various female workers and matrons did not please her at all,
and many a degrading scene broke the cultured leisure of John
Wesley, that little leisure which he took from his travelling and
preaching to employ in writing or editing some of the numerous
works that passed through his hands. He was thankful to beat a
retreat to the house of Ebenezer Blackwell, a wealthy banker, whose
charming house at Lewisham was always open to him when he wished to
retire awhile from the storm and stress of his chosen career, but
he never for long allowed himself the pleasures of this cultured
society and these delightful surroundings. His difficulties did not
decrease with the passing of the years.</p>

<p>John had accomplished a great work, but it required unremitting
labour to keep it together. Some Methodists went over to the
Dissenters; others, like James Harvey, returned to the bosom of the
Church of England. Then there was the Scotch experiment; Whitefield
had warned Wesley against going to Scotland, saying: "You have no
business in Scotland, for your principles are so well known that,
if you spoke like an angel, none would hear you, and if they did,
you would have nothing to do but dispute with one another from
morning to night." But with his usual self-complacency Wesley
replied: "If God sends me, people will hear." He accordingly went
to the stronghold of Calvinism and made some, though not a very
great, headway. On his return he once more visited Epworth, where
he found a "poor, dead, senseless people"; so his father's work had
been, after all, useless and forty years of toil had gone for
nothing, unless the diligent rector had thereby saved his own soul,
and of this his son had no certain assurance.</p>

<p>Then, again, there was a disappointment at Kings-wood. The
school had begun with twenty-eight scholars, six masters, and six
servants. Wesley had taken almost incredible pains with this
establishment, having many books printed for the use of the pupils,
written out numerous grammars. Human nature was, however, too much
for his high-minded intention; the servants began to quarrel, the
masters were unsatisfactory, one being coarse and rough, another a
mean creature without authority, a third so unpopular with the
children that they could do nothing with him, and the fourth
joining with the boys in horseplay. The severe discipline copied
from the Epworth model had gone to the winds, and the older boys
were wicked and wild, since all their religious impressions were
worn off. There were now but two masters, two servants, and eleven
children; John Wesley, however, refused to be daunted and began to
search round for new masters, new servants, and another matron.
While this was going on, there was yet another cloud in John's sky,
but it was one that gave some satisfaction to his wife. James
Wheatley, one of Wesley's most popular preachers, had become
tainted with Moravianism and, what was worse, had been guilty of
immoral behaviour with some of his female flock in Bradford. Seven
sisters eagerly brought charges against the backslider, and Mrs.
Wesley had the task, perhaps no uncongenial one, of examining them.
Wheatley admitted his fault, professed to be penitent, but made
matters worse by declaring that most of the field-preachers were as
guilty as himself. Wesley declared that these charges, examined in
the case of ten preachers, were true, and Wheatley was thrown out
of the fold. He, however, started on his own an evangelical mission
in Norwich, and in this city the outcast Methodist, whom sin had
not deprived of eloquence, soon gathered together two thousand
followers, who declared they were converted, and were so noisy in
their demonstrations of delight that they attracted the attention
of a Jacobite society called the Hell-Fire Club, who were suspected
of being Papists. These people broke up the chapel that Wheatley
had built, seized the preacher, and nearly drowned him in the
river; disgusting and dangerous riots followed. These disturbances,
to the scare of the magistrate, continued for several months.
Wheatley contrived to establish himself again as a preacher, and he
and his followers held their own, although he was once more accused
of immoral behaviour and of "burdening the parishes with helpless
children." He was given another chapel, where he preached with much
success, but once more being openly disgraced he was hauled before
the Ecclesiastical Court of the Bishop of Norwich and brought to
trial for adultery with his neighbours' wives&mdash;"all professing
Methodism." In the words of Messrs. Baldwin and Knapp, the prim
authors of the <i>Newgate Calendar,</i> "sufficient proof having
been adduced, the judge declared Wheatley to be a lewd, debauched,
incontinent, and adulterous man; and that he had committed the
crimes of adultery, fornication, and incontinence, to the great
scandal of good men, and pernicious to the example of others. He
was then sentenced to do public penance in a linen cloth, in the
parish church, with a paper pinned to his breast, denoting his
crime; and condemned to pay the cost of the suit."</p>

<p>This sordid scandal was a great triumph for the Devil, and made
a huge breach in the walls of the fort that Methodism was holding
for God. John was forced to consider the state of the organization
that he had built up so carefully&mdash;whether there were any
other wolves among his sheep. Charles was deeply agitated and not
altogether sympathetic if John had not moved so far from the
Church, would these horrors have occurred? George Whitefield,
snugly orthodox, despite Lady Huntingdon and Trevecca, adopted a
smug attitude&mdash;"He knew nothing of Mr. Wesley's
societies."</p>

<p>John, set back but not daunted, decided to investigate the
morals of all the preachers, originally sixty-eight in number, whom
he employed. Allowing for those who had been expelled or had left
voluntarily, who had died, who had become clergymen of the Church
of England or Dissenters, or who had given up through ill-health,
there were but twenty-five of this number left. Charles, earnest
and agitated, set out on circuit to enquire into the behaviour and
success of these; he had a bad beginning at Worcester, where the
mob threw dust and dirt over both Charles and his congregation, but
the younger Wesley proceeded on his tour, sending careful reports
back to his brother. More papers were written, more rules drawn up,
the whole movement was, as far as possible, purged and tightened;
John started again on his tours and his life settled down to a
monotonous repetition of the labours he had so cheerfully
undertaken so many years before, but his strained relations with
Charles continued. The younger brother had become intimate with the
Countess of Huntingdon and often preached in her house; he was on
more friendly terms with Whitefield than was John; Whitefield found
"poor Mr. Wesley striving against the stream," and wrote him from
Bristol an unctuous letter about the slave trade, which John still
refused to countenance. "Apart from the fact," Whitefield urged,
"that keeping slaves gave one a chance to save their souls, there
was Bible precedent for the custom.</p>

<p>"Some of them were bought with Abraham's money and some were born
in his house, and I cannot help thinking that some of those
servants mentioned by the apostles in their epistles were, or had
been, slaves." He lamented what a flourishing country Georgia might
have been had the use of them been permitted years ago! George was
employing slaves himself, and at his death there were seventy-five
working in his orphanage and plantations in America.</p>

<p>Still, despite these large and exasperating troubles, and the
continual thorn in his flesh of Molly Wesley, John had some vivid
consolations; there was a clergyman, slowly recovering from a
violent fit of palsy, with which he had been struck immediately
after he had been preaching a violent sermon against the
Methodists. There was the woman who went blind, but who, on opening
the Bible, found she could read every word. There was the large
gentlewoman who sat in front of Wesley in the coach where he and
his wife had taken refuge and so diverted the stones of the mob
from him. There was the woman healed of the Devil, who had appeared
and talked to her for some time. There was the success of all
John's publications, of his dispensary. There was the increase in
the number of the Methodists, and there was also another matter of
rejoicing; his own deepened strength of character; his continued
hardiness of body; the purging of his spirit from all pettinesses
and littleness, although George Whitefield wrote to Charles: "I
cannot help thinking that he [John] is still jealous of me and my
proceedings," adding darkly, "more might be said were we face to
face."</p>

<p>Whitefield, however, was with Wesley in his dislike of, and
attacks upon, Moravianism, and published a pamphlet in 1753 against
Zinzendorf and his followers, charging them with a "farrago of
superstition." In this pamphlet Whitefield, evidently from
firsthand knowledge, gives some curious particulars of the
practices that he and so many other English people found
objectionable. Zinzendorf burnt perfume in his room before he made
his entrance among the brethren. He was also head over heels in
debt, and in the Fetter Lane Chapel he had arranged an artificial
mountain which, upon the singing of a particular hymn, was made to
fall down, and behind it appeared a representation of a Moravian
leader and Christ embraced together, while the clouds above were
raining money. The Count was also accused of fraud, having drawn
bills, according to Whitefield, on two English Moravians to the
amount of 48,000.</p>

<p>John was extremely shocked by reported revelations, considering
these practices "amazing abominations," but the Moravians countered
that Whitefield had "more diabolical impudence than the devil," and
declared that all he had said of them was lies.</p>

<p>These quarrels were entering upon very dangerous ground; in
accusing one another of charlatanism, hypocrisy, lust, pride, and
superstition, Moravians, Calvinists, and Methodists were exposing
common faults and vices implicit in any religious enthusiasm and
explicit in all meetings and ceremonies where such emotion is
indulged in. The effect of Zinzendorf, the Wesleys, and Whitefield
on their followers was in some degree the same as that produced a
few years later by Cagliostro and Mesmer, and in some degree the
means used were similar; the German, by theatrical shows and dark
mysterious talk, was as skilful as the Sicilian in extorting money
from his supporters, though no doubt the former employed it to a
better purpose. Wesley affected people in the same way as Mesmer
did, while Whitefield could sway the ladies of St. James's as
adroitly as the Comte St. Germain did those of Versailles.</p>

<p>Where did the Kingdom of God end and that of the Devil begin?
John Wesley pretended to miracles as surely as did Cagliostro; his
prayers, the evangelist declared, could cure a rupture or still the
agonies of a raging tooth; hundreds attested that the Sicilian's
pills had done as much for them.</p>

<p>John firmly believed in all the stock-in-trade of the charlatan
and the quack; he had not seen a witch, he admitted, but then,
neither had he seen a murder, but he believed in both: "to doubt
witchcraft was to doubt the Bible." Then, some of his remedies for
sickness were as fantastic as those sponsored by Dr. "Spot" Ward,
so viciously pursued by Hogarth's pencil; John Wesley advised
thrusting one's head into a hole in the ground as a cure for
neuralgia; he thought that animal magnetism was a "satanical
delusion," and that a raw onion split in half, clapped to the
stomach of the sufferer, would cure nausea.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>
TUMULT.</h2>

<p class="first">
IN late middle age, between his fiftieth and his sixtieth year,
John Wesley had practically accomplished his work; all the
tremendous energy of the rest of his long life was given to
consolidating what he had already achieved: to purging, tightening
his organization, to extending it, and to securing its continuation
after his death.</p>

<p>His greatest difficulties were past; he had intelligent and
willing helpers, not only in his own lay field-preachers but in
such sympathetic Anglicans as Fletcher of Madeley; he had a large
number of followers, and every year saw an increase in his classes,
schools, societies, and meeting-houses. He had also official
acquiescence, if not official recognition; he had proved that his
great influence was to be used to support, not to pull down, Church
and State; he was always keenly on the side of law and order.</p>

<p>By the steady sales of his books and pamphlets&mdash;such an
important part of his campaign&mdash;he had earned enough money to
keep many of his schemes going; he also had a good system for
obtaining a steady flow of modest contributions from his followers
that were sufficient to keep the movement financially sound. There
was no muddle or confusion in his accounts, and this firm financial
basis gave the whole movement a substantial place in the national
life. In Methodism John Wesley had a powerful organization under
his sole control that he could have used for almost any purpose he
pleased.</p>

<p>He chose to use this power&mdash;greater power than a private
person had possessed in England for a long time&mdash;merely to
enforce his own opinions on an increasing number of the population.
These opinions had not changed since the days of Epworth Rectory.
Despite the great importance that he himself put on his conversion,
despite his splits with Moravian and Calvinist, he had really
altered in little since he had formed the Holy Club. He still
believed in what his mother had taught him, though he had the
arrogance to affirm that she had not been a Christian until he had
shown her the light.</p>

<p>This light he was in danger of losing himself; the agony and the
ecstasy struck out of him by his Georgia experience, and the change
wrought in him by Peter Bhler, had died away beneath the weight of
his formalism. His faith was bright and clear, but it burnt in a
small, steady flame that was in danger of being smothered by
method, by mundane detail, by unconscious self-glorification, by
the monotony of repetition. Some great benefits John Wesley offered
to those who crowded to listen to him; he appealed to every man,
woman, and child to find God for himself or herself, through direct
emotional experience and not in the dreary formalism of a creed or
within the dull limits of a drab, lifeless orthodoxy. Yet, as soon
as he had aroused their emotion, which he called faith, he drew the
converts into an organization that became, as soon as his personal
influence was removed, as chill and formal, as open to human fault
and error, to abuse and vice, as any other attempt to clamp the
things of the inward spirit into the bonds of dogma. Once, on the
<i>Samuel,</i> riding the Atlantic storms, John Wesley had had a
glimpse of that Spirituality which rises above any possible set of
rules then in conflict; afterwards while Purcell's music filled the
dark dome of St. Paul's, in joy he had realized that materialism is
but half and the lesser half of life.</p>

<p>In his belief in witchcraft and ghosts was some recognition of
the importance of the psychic world, some feeling towards the
modern attitude that acknowledges that reality does not rest alone
with materialism or Rationalism; but, lacking imagination,
mysticism, a real sense of spirituality, he missed the sensitive
and elusive truth. His cries of "God! God!" to those to whom
nothing was real save the most sordid of brutal facts, let a
brilliant light into many dark and noisome places; but Wesley at
once began to obscure the glow he had himself given, not only by
his instant ticketing and docketing of his converts, but by
offering them, in flat terms, a hideous, depressing, and degrading
creed. Accepting his "fable" and his "dream," relying on that
medley of fiction, romance, poetry, ethics, and superstition termed
the Bible, John Wesley took advantage of that religious emotion he
was able to rouse in the wretched and ignorant, to implant some
terrible falsehoods in their shivering hearts; the most dreadful of
these was Hell. His disciples were shown not only the love of God,
only to be reached by blind faith and a life devoid of all
pleasure, but also the wrath of God; he did not often use eternal
punishment as his central theme, but he hardly spoke or wrote
without glancing at the awful consequences of sin and disbelief,
and in at least one sermon he expatiated clearly enough on this
appalling subject. Taking as his text the well-known line from Mark
(ix, 46): "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not
quenched," that has been quoted with relish by so many bitter
fanatics, Wesley interpreted the Biblical references to Hell in the
most literal sense possible&mdash;"an unvaried scene of horror upon
horror"&mdash;and with regard to the problem of consuming fire's
enduring for ever he pointed to the <i>Linum Asbestum</i>
handkerchief in the British Museum that could remain in flame
without perishing. So the soul; for ever and ever it would remain
burning: "I am all over pain and I shall never be eased from it. I
lie under exquisite torment of body and horror of soul; and I shall
feel it for ever!"</p>

<p>It was no wonder that illiterate peasants and semi-idiotic
slum-dwellers fell roaring to the ground, screaming: "I will be
good," like a child threatened with a stick, and that even the
half-educated, especially if also half-drunk, should be overcome
with fear and trembling.</p>

<p>Apart from this emotional contact with God&mdash;faith&mdash;and
a lively fear of the Devil, John Wesley taught his followers some
rules of conduct excellent in themselves but embracing only one
side of existence; his code was that of the middle-class trader, so
dear to Puritanism; he inculcated industry, honesty, thrift,
sobriety, plain living, an incessant preoccupation with the next
world to which this was but a mean antechamber, a suppression of
all passions and emotions, a rigid living by rule.</p>

<p>Though he had been at first, and in a sense always remained, a
High Churchman, the result of his immense influence was to revive
Puritanism. He was blind to beauty, distrusted the arts; the
theatre was "Satan's own ground", when staying in a tavern he had
some fine pictures that showed irreligious subjects set with their
faces to the wall&mdash;but a step from this to Savonarola's
burning of the vanities&mdash;everything was to be subjugated to
the one great work&mdash;serving God. Without humour though not
without a dry wit, John Wesley discouraged joy, pleasure, all gay
and lovely things; those who could not find their happiness in
striving after Heaven might remain miserable. His school system did
not allow a second for play, and very few for exercise or repose;
there was not a child who came into contact with eighteenth-century
Methodism who must not have been the worse for it. A terrible
heritage had Mrs. Susanna Wesley left behind her; her ideas of
education were welded, in the hands of her son, into an evil thing
that did unrecorded harm to thousands of children.</p>

<p>From John Wesley's teaching, which spread from his own
organization to those of the Church of England and the Dissenting
bodies, grew that form of religion which was to overwhelm the
country for nearly a hundred years, which was to produce the
typical middle-class Victorian and the English Sunday.</p>

<p>A nobler side of Wesley's character resulted in definite
benefits to his country. As he grew old his interest in
humanitarianism became more lively and sincere; blind to the harm
he was doing in his schools and classes, he saw clearly the obvious
horrors of crime, disease, and poverty, protested and did his best
to remedy them. He was in this work the direct inspiration of
reformers like Wilberforce, Elizabeth Fry, and John Howard.</p>

<p>The immense energy of John Wesley was not exhausted either by
his incessant preaching, travelling, and writing, or by his noble
efforts on behalf of the outcast and the criminal; he continued to
take a deep interest in all scientific discoveries. His intense
curiosity and his lively intelligence were both aroused and pleased
by Benjamin Franklin's lecture on the identity of lightning and the
electric fluid, which he delivered before the Royal Society of
England. "What an amazing scene is here opened for future races to
improve on!" exclaimed Wesley, with true prophetic insight and, in
his little dispensary at the Foundry, he soon had an apparatus for
electrifying persons for the cure of various disorders; and he
declared that hundreds, perhaps thousands, had received
"unspeakable good" from the electricity which he thought of as
liquid fire.</p>

<p>Still, though outwardly successful, though laying the
foundations of several great movements and impressing himself on
the National character, John Wesley, while he was living these
strenuous middle years, found them difficult, tumultuous, and
sometimes almost overwhelming even to his iron courage and
inexhaustible energy. The period between his marriage and the death
of his wife was like a kaleidoscope in which a few odd pieces of
glass of different colour keep shifting together in random
patterns, always of limited shapes and design. Although officially
accepted and sometimes officially protected, the Methodists made
headway only by battling against the most violent opposition. Often
on his travels John was saluted with curses and hard names and
mauled by wild rioters or, worse still, "the congregation passed to
and fro, laughing and talking, as if they had been in Westminster
Abbey." He found Deists even among the ploughmen; his chapels were
pulled down and he was assailed with showers of dirt and filth.
Sometimes these orgies of brutalities changed to scenes of maudlin
ecstasy, as when a prize-fighter, who was leading a mob against
John Wesley, was so overawed by his gentle face and courageous
daring that he fell weeping and began to stroke the auburn locks,
now thickly sprinkled with grey, and, turning on his former allies,
exclaiming: "What soft hair he has!" led the preacher to safety.
The hideous scenes provoked by the Methodist preaching, the
brutality shown to their followers, went far to cancel any
elevating qualities in Methodism itself, while what was good in the
teaching was too often enervated by the ferocity and sensuality
that always lie so close to strong religious feeling. But to John
Wesley, riding up and down the country in spite of mobs, sickness,
fatigue, and dissensions among his own followers, there was only
one sharp issue: that between God and the Devil. He was often ill
with weariness, with cramp, with headache, with nausea or flux, but
he was never despondent. How could he be when he was convinced that
he was under Divine protection and that his guardian angels were
working miracles on his behalf?</p>

<p>In his voluminous Journal, which he contrived to keep amid all
his press of business, he noted hundreds of curious incidents and
remarkable happenings as he rode over the bad, broken roads, the
stony saddle-paths, the grassy tracks that connected the isolated
villages, towns, cities, and country-seats of England and Ireland.
There was the preacher who preached and conducted a service in his
sleep, and even paused to argue with a clergyman who interrupted
him; there was the consumptive Katherine Whitaker, who died
singing:</p>

<p>I cannot fear, I cannot doubt, I feel the sprinkled blood, and
exclaiming, "There are no swelled legs in Heaven!" There was Rose
Longworth, who died joyfully, crying: "See how His blood streams!"
There was the lively old soldier, ninety-two years of age, who had
served King William and Queen Anne in the wars, and now served the
Prince of Peace. There were preachings at open doors, in
ditches&mdash;at one place the soldiers cut swathes of undergrowth
out of the moat for Wesley to stand on. There were night watches,
and fervent collections of money for preaching-houses; sometimes a
hundred pounds was given in a few minutes. There were backsliders,
who returned to wallow in their sins.</p>

<p>Amid all these signs and miracles, wonders and
mysteries&mdash;and Wesley encountered enough of them to fill
volumes&mdash;practical business was not neglected. At the yearly
conference organization and finance passed under the master's eye
and were dealt with by the master's mind. England was passing
through a period of expansion in trade, in colonization; new ideas
and new inventions were changing the country in which John had
grown to manhood; the increasing industrial population turned to
Methodism far more eagerly than to any other religion offered them,
and it became almost the one creed of America. Wesley was always on
the side of the Government. He quelled the Bristol colliers when
they were rioting on account of the price of corn; he checked
smuggling in Cornwall; he exhorted all to pay taxes and to obey the
law. Through foreign wars, internal rebellions, riots, and
disorders he was a staunch friend of the Hanoverian monarchy and
its ministers.</p>

<p>But politics did not greatly interest him; he was too absorbed,
not only in his life-work, but in the struggle with the Calvinists
and the great question whether or not the Methodists should
separate from the Established Church&mdash;a problem that had been
causing a great deal of dissatisfaction and uneasiness for a good
many years among several of the Methodists and that deeply troubled
Charles, who was always a jealous son of the Church of England and
could not endure the idea of any heresy, whereas John remained
firmly of his former opinion: "We will not go out unless we are
thrust out," well adding: "We have at present no thoughts of
separation." But that did not mean that he would abate one jot of
those practices that might exasperate or alienate the orthodox
Anglican.</p>

<p>John, still struggling with a jealous wife and the Calvinists,
had a brush with Dr. Dodd&mdash;an extremely popular preacher, with
whom he had a lively but courteous correspondence, and was active
up and down the country. War with France was striking fear and
unrest into all ranks of the people, despite the bringing of three
hundred French merchant ships into English ports; it was feared
that Ireland would break into open rebellion and that the French
would descend on those coasts.</p>

<p>These national disturbances made the field-preaching and the
continual journeying more perilous than ever now there were Popish
mobs and press-gangs to contend with, and refugees from the
Palatinate, as well as the Quakers and Dissenters, but the trouble
that touched John Wesley most closely and most severely was that
caused by his unhappy marriage. This misery, that he tried to make
supportable by considering it as his cross, came to a climax that
he partly provoked by behaviour that would have exasperated a woman
of finer mettle than Molly Wesley, one quicker to distinguish
between sacred and profane love.</p>

<p>The leader's tender dallyings with the female members of his
flock had been hard enough for his wife to bear, but the case of
Sarah Ryan she felt to be unendurable. To his great relief, John
had found, when he reorganized Kingswood School, a woman eminently
suited to be the matron. She proved herself very successful in this
position, and had shown what was known at that period as "exemplary
behaviour," and John Wesley soon became on terms of affectionate
friendship with her. When he and his wife visited Kingswood, this
young matron, whose name was Sarah Ryan, sat at the head of the
table, while Mrs. Wesley had to take a lower place, and John, about
1756&mdash;or five years after his marriage&mdash;had entered into
an intimate correspondence with this young woman; she was admitted
to the conferences, and there placed above the leader's wife.</p>

<p>Sarah Ryan had begun life as a domestic servant, and was a very
ordinary young girl, vain, untruthful, fond of amusement and fine
clothes. Before she was twenty years of age she had married a man
who claimed to have a handsome income, but turned out to be a
penniless cork-cutter. After the couple had lived together in some
squalor and vice, the man ran away, and Sarah promised to marry an
Italian with the curious name of Solomon Benreken. She did not
fulfil this promise, however, but married an Irish sailor, Ryan.
After a short period of joint misery the Irishman went to sea and
Sarah married the Italian. When he, too, went to sea, she lived
again with the returned Ryan and seemed, during the next two years,
to have lived, now with this man, now with that, as her husband, as
the fancy took her. Neither of them, however, contributed to her
support, and she was obliged again to become a servant; she lived
in very poor circumstances, and had great difficulty in providing
herself and her mother with the barest necessaries of life. It was
in Spitalfields Church, where she had gone out of curiosity, that
she heard John Wesley preach, and she declared herself converted
and went to live with a Methodist, Mary Clark, in a small house in
Christopher Alley, Moorfields, where some of the London Methodists
held their meetings. Two ardent enthusiasts, Sarah Crosby and Miss
Bosanquet, also lived with Mary Clark, and John Wesley frequently
favoured these ardent women with his company and his advice. He was
much attracted by Sarah Ryan, whose conversion he believed to be
sincere and in whose talents and capabilities he had great
confidence.</p>

<p>Therefore he had made her housekeeper at Bristol and Kingswood.
There was much murmuring among the other women at this honour to
one who was, in the parlance of the time, but a converted
Magdalene, and was still, in the opinion of those who knew her
best, vain and giddy. She was accused&mdash;and this could scarcely
be denied&mdash;of being a trigamist, and at any moment one of the
men with whom she had gone through the marriage ceremony might
arrive to claim her. Sarah was indeed a foolish, completely
uneducated, eighteenth-century, low-type servant girl, touched with
religious mania. Still John Wesley respected, admired her, and kept
up a long correspondence with her, because she was a fine specimen
of conversion. Several of her letters were intercepted by Mrs.
Wesley, whose jealousy rose to such a point that at one of the
Bristol conferences with Sarah Ryan sitting at the head of the
table the wife broke in and shrieked out, no doubt to the great
disgust of the preachers present, "The harlot now serving you has
three husbands living!" John Wesley would not, however, give way.
He would have nothing to say against Sarah Ryan's piety, and, best
of all, she kept the difficult rules of Kingswood that he laid down
to her in many of his letters, while the scandal associating him
with Sarah Ryan and his wife's jealousy seemed to him as much to be
disregarded as stones and mud flung at him by the ignorant mob of
the bigoted Dissenters. To the gratified Sarah he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">On what a pinnacle do you stand! You are placed
in the eye of all the world&mdash;friends and enemies. You have no
experience of these things; no knowledge of the people; no
advantage of education; not large natural abilities but a novice,
as it were, in the ways of God! It requires all the omnipotent love
of God to preserve you in your present situation, but if you
continue teachable and advisable, I know nothing that should be
able to hurt you.</p>

<p><br>
Encouraged by letters like these, the Kingswood housekeeper took
an exasperating tone towards Mrs. Wesley, praying for her, and
"dealing faithfully with her," as she priggishly put it, adding: "I
will not despair of Mrs. Wesley."</p>

<p>That outraged lady, whose temper had become so ungovernable that
many thought she was insane, refused to accompany her husband on
his next journey to Ireland and remained with Ebenezer Blackwell,
complaining to him of her husband's behaviour.</p>

<p>This rupture was, indeed, difficult to heal, but it was not yet
final; there was some attempt at reconciliation that led to the
most degrading scenes, as when John Hampson came into the room and
found Mrs. Wesley, "foaming with fury," trailing her husband about
the floor by the hair of his head; while she showered abuse upon
him he offered no resistance. This was a dismal replica of the
Beata Hawkins assault so long ago. Incapable of subtlety of feeling
or delicacy of expression, Molly coarsely accused her husband of
adultery and, on discovering another affectionate letter to Sarah
Ryan in his pocket, she abruptly left him, an event that John
announced thus to the Kingswoodd housekeeper:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">My dear Sister, after many severe words my wife
left me, vowing she would see me no more, as I had wrote you the
same morning and began to reason with myself, that I almost doubted
whether I have done well in writing, or whether I ought to write
you at all. After prayer that doubt was taken away, yet I was
almost sorry that I had written that morning. In the evening, while
I was preaching at the Chapel, she came into the chamber where I
had left my clothes, searched my pockets and found the letter
there, which I had finished but not sealed. When she read it, God
broke her heart, and afterwards found her in such a temper than I
had not seen her in for several years. She has continued the same
ever since, so I think God has given a sufficient answer in regard
to writing to each other.</p>

<p><br>
Sarah replied in general terms that probably all was for the
best and that Wesley must not put too much trust in any human
being. To which Wesley replied:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">My dear Sister, your last letter was seasonable
indeed, I was growing faint in my mind. The being continually
watched over for evil, the having every word I spoke, every action
I did, great and small, watched over with no friendly eye, the
hearing a thousand little tart, unkind reflections in return for
the kindest words I could devise:<br>
<br>
Like "drops of eating water on the marble<br>
At length have worn my sinking spirit down."<br>
<br>
Yet I could not say "Take thy plague away from me" but only "Let me
be purified, not consumed."</p>

<p><br>
Freed, if only temporarily, from what he justly termed "a
plague," John Wesley went his way, doubtless "purified" by the
experience, the cessation of which was, humanly speaking, such a
relief. He had not, he noted dryly, sent her away and he would not
call her back.</p>

<p>Molly Wesley, who had disappeared into humdrum obscurity,
returned reluctantly to her husband, to renew her scoldings and
whinings, her sighings and complaints. Her husband endured her with
that cold magnanimity so exasperating to a vulgar nature and
continued to employ Sarah Ryan at Kingswood. In 1768 this woman
died&mdash;in the odour of sanctity, Wesley thought&mdash;and he
preserved some of her letters for publication. This question of
sanctity was one that much agitated the Methodists. Was it possible
to be, in a second, entirely sanctified by the possession of faith?
John Wesley admitted that he had never received this supreme
blessing completely. "My peace is more solid than it was at first,
and my soul seems more centred in God. But what I judge more by is
the change I feel, and my one desire to do His will, and I feel
nothing but love to every creature, let them use me ill or well."
This seemed a personal matter that each person could solve
according to his own experience and his own desire, but it split
and agitated the Methodists to an extraordinary degree.</p>

<p>John Wesley, like so many great men, was without imagination and
a sense of humour, or he might have foreseen what his teachings
were certain to produce. How is it possible to begin a religious
revival, to endeavour to touch people through emotionalism, to
appeal to the heart instead of the head, to tolerate talk of
visions and hysterical displays, to believe that the will of God
may be found through sortilege, to allow yourself to say that you
feel you "have the divine commission" for what you preach, and yet
to hold in check your followers? Who could be the arbiter in this
dispute? Who could decide that what Wesley said came from God and
what George Bell or Maxfield said came either from the Devil or
from the ravings of lunatics? The whole subject was one of extreme
difficulty and likely to end in distressing confusion, and it seems
doubtful whether the good that Wesley's movement had done in the
country balanced the evil caused by the wave of mingled hysteria
and imposture. Wesley had not foreseen that his own success would
provoke ignoble imitators, and that many a man, either of unsettled
wits or of unlimited impudence, with a certain amount of theatrical
talent, would try to copy Whitefield, who had been able to draw
large enough audiences and to receive enough praise and flattery to
satisfy the vainest and weakest of men. The good qualities of the
Wesleys, their work among the poor, their sincere piety, their
self-denial, their law and order, were not imitated, but these good
qualities hardly sufficed for them to hold their own against the
storm they had aroused.</p>

<p>When John Wesley went to Wales he was shocked to find a sect
entitled "The Welsh Jumpers," who called themselves Methodists.
Here was a survival of primitive rites; the Welsh peasants danced
in religious ecstasy, declaring that they were imitating David
dancing before the Ark. They tore off their clothes and committed
other extravagances, and whenever anyone tried to reprove them they
said: "You have the mark of the enemy in your forehead."</p>

<p>John Wesley commented: "Such are the delusions and
uncharitableness of these people!" But he, himself, had said that
those who disagreed with him were inspired by Satan, and his
reproof made no impression on the Welsh Jumpers, who continued to
intoxicate themselves with dancing and hymn-singing. Wesley was
told: "They sing the verse of a hymn over and over with all their
might, sometimes about thirty or forty times; meanwhile the bodies
of two or three, sometimes ten and twelve, are violently agitated,
and they leap up and down in all manner of postures, frequently for
hours together." John Wesley thought they were simple, God-fearing
men, misled by the Devil; yet, when somewhat similar scenes had
occurred in the early days of his own preaching, he had thought the
hand of God was in them.</p>

<p>At sixty years of age, his health still unimpaired, he continued
his travelling, with an eye for the largest as well as the smallest
thing, making notes by the way; many of his congregation "were dry
and dead as stone, having been harried by disputers of every kind."
Others were composed of "roaring, drunken miners"; some of the
societies were all in confusion because one woman had scolded her
neighbour and another had stolen a crusty loaf. John Wesley found
that the want of field-preaching was "the great cause of deadness,"
but still he rode over the rough roads, through sun and rain,
alert, eager, and cheerful, always spotlessly clean, the long hair
that had always attracted such attention now snow-white, his
small-featured face refined by age and stamped with that peculiar
smile, at once complacent and tolerant, but that smacked of
hypocrisy and maddened his opponents.</p>

<p>Excitement over Christian perfectibility had scarcely died away
when another problem arose&mdash;the Millennium, brought forward by
a Mr. Hartley, who had published a defence of John Wesley against
the Bishop of Gloucester's attacks. Hartley professed to be a
mystic, and John Wesley was now, as always, stoutly against
mysticism, but, with his usual consistency, declared that he must
believe in the Millennium, since he believed in the Bible. He took
a literal and practical view of this event&mdash;"a comfortable
doctrine," as he termed it. Christ would come again, the martyrs
would be raised, for a thousand years Christ would reign in
Jerusalem, which would be rebuilt, enlarged, and richly
adorned&mdash;a Foundry on a large scale, with, doubtless, John
near the Lamb he had so faithfully served. But John would not
commit himself to Hartley's theory that the Millennium was near,
and he had done his utmost to check the wild excitement and panic
that broke out among those who were convinced that the day of
Judgment was at hand, when a scare had been raised by Bell and
Maxfield in 1763, when the first had been arrested because his
rantings disturbed the public peace. John Wesley had preached
against these mad prophets, though he declared "that prison was a
poor cure for enthusiasm."</p>

<p>But while he remained firmly against these deluded mystics and
insane fanatics, he always maintained his belief in the
supernatural, though he had no experience of this himself. He
wrote: "With my latest breath will I bear my testimony against
giving up to infidels one great proof of the invisible world; I
mean that of witchcraft and apparitions, confirmed by the testimony
of all ages."</p>

<p>He was always collecting ghost stories, most of which he
believed, though he usually wrote them without more than a few
non-committal comments. As he justly said, the fact that he could
not understand many details of these phenomena was no proof that
they were not true. "For what is that I do comprehend, even of the
things I see daily? Truly not: 'The smallest grain of sand, or
spine of grass.' I know not how the one grows, or how the particles
of the other cohere together."</p>

<p>Science would now enlighten John Wesley as to the growth of the
plant and the cohesion of the sand, but there is as yet no
satisfactory solution to such a problem as that offered by the
story of Elizabeth Hobson, which John Wesley heard from the woman
herself in 1768 and which he related at great length. Elizabeth
Hobson had been surrounded with spirits of the dead and phantoms of
the living since she was a child; the ghost of a drowned sailor
haunted her for weeks, holding converse with her and dropping
seawater on her breast; she saw the apparition of her brother who
died in Jamaica; she was tormented by the spirit of her
grandfather, who appeared to her in a brimstone flame, accompanied
by a smell of burning that was noticed by the girl's companions.
Dr. Johnson heard of this story and sent Boswell to discuss it with
Wesley. On the surface the case of Betsy Hobson seems one of
ordinary religious hysteria, but there were evidently circumstances
about it that deeply impressed all who heard it or knew the
girl.</p>

<p>The hand of God was again as plainly visible to John Wesley in
the sad end of the buffoon who reviled Methodism in Sheffield as in
the ghosts that crowded round Betsy Hobson; this wretch used to
mock John Wesley and interrupt his sermons by letting loose cocks,
hens, and cats into the meetinghouse; bathing in the Don, he stuck
in the mud and was drowned.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>
OLD AGE.</h2>

<p class="first">
WHEN John Wesley attained his seventieth year, which was then
considered "man's allotted span," he found his family, his friends,
and his followers much thinned about him. In the midst of the
bitter but restrained controversies between the Methodists and the
Calvinists, George Whitefield died in America in 1770, and left
Lady Huntingdon his American responsibilities in Bethesda College
as well as a medley of congregations, schools, and preachers now
without a head. He died of a heart attack, worn out, as he had
wished to be, in the service of his God; his life had been, for
some time, a misery by reason of asthma and gout. But his success,
both in Lady Huntingdon's drawing-room and in other fashionable
parlours of Mayfair, as well as in the various meeting-houses that
his patroness had built, remained undiminished, and even when his
physical powers were failing he was always able to draw a large
audience by his honey-sweet eloquence, his fascinating gestures,
his seductive manner, and that dramatic power whereby he was able
to persuade people that angels and devils were actually about him.
John Gambold, who had been one of the Oxford Methodists, then a
Moravian bishop, the most tolerant and liberal-minded of Wesley's
early followers, died about the same time; so did Emilia, who,
after her disappointed youth and a frustrated middle age, had
married Mr. Harper, an apothecary at Epworth, when she was fifty
years of age; soon afterwards she was left a widow, and as an old
woman had come to London and taken up her lodgings in the rooms
above the Foundry. There she resided in religious retirement,
giving what was left of her once fine intelligence and generous
nature to prayer and mediation. When too infirm to leave her room,
she was able to open the window and thus to hear and so to join in
the services taking place in the chapel below. Her faith had
sometimes wavered, but she declared that it had always been
restored when she thought of "the thing we called 'old Jeffrey'" at
Epworth; those unexplained phenomena convinced her of the existence
of an invisible world, and that once accepted&mdash;why, all else
might be. Her death left only Martha, who was separated from
Westley Hall, the man who had practised and preached polygamy,
caused great scandal by his career in Salisbury, and died in 1776.
Patty remained a close friend to her brother, but does not seem to
have officially joined the Methodists; she moved in intellectual
society and was a friend of Dr. Johnson's. She was the last
survivor of the Epworth sisters, once so brilliant, so charming,
and so hopeful a group. The brothers-in-law were dead too, and all
had made those telling death-bed repentances that helped to put
both John and Charles so triumphantly in the right. Dick Ellison,
who had been Sukey's husband, had died, bitterly repentant, but
hoping for pardon, in 1760. Nine years later, John Whitelambe,
still curate of Wroote and still mourning his gentle Mary, was
buried near her in his own parish church; he had lost his early
religious zeal and had become, as was noted in alarm by his
brother-in-law, almost a Deist. He was, in the opinions of some, a
saint; in the opinions of others, a mere parish drudge. Wright the
plumber, too, the blackguard husband of poor Hetty, had passed
away, in terrors of contrition and penitence, wishing only that his
useless career might be described and published for the benefit of
other weak-minded sinners.</p>

<p>Charles had aged more than his elder brother, had led a much
more retired life, happy in his happy family. He was constantly
ill, and though he became irritable, especially on the question of
separation from the Church, he preserved the fire and sweetness of
his nature, and continued to write and to edit magnificent hymns.
The superb health of John began to suffer, though he made the very
least of his ailments and by sheer vigour of will almost cured
them. He suffered, however, from a definite and exasperating
complaint, a form of dropsy, the result of a riding accident, which
soon necessitated an operation every five or six weeks.</p>

<p>This did not prevent him from continuing his journeys in all
weathers, his preachings, his praying, his plans for a new chapel
in the City Road, his bold front to the virulent Calvinist attacks
now furiously launched, when the influence of Whitefield, his
friend, was removed.</p>

<p>Fanned by Lady Huntingdon and her "connection," the furious
controversy broke out into a blaze, and among others Augustus
Toplady, a consumptive young clergyman, who had written one famous
hymn&mdash;"Rock of Ales"&mdash;attacked Wesley in pamphlets so
scurrilous that the Methodist leader at last found it beneath him
to answer them. Toplady was particularly inflamed by Wesley's
defence of the Government on the question of the American War. This
political question, which neither properly understood, complicated
the polemics of the two divines; Toplady, who had a good backing of
Calvinists, pursued Wesley with a venom that had no regard for
either truth or decency. One of John's most popular
pamphlets&mdash;</p>

<p>"A Calm Address to the American People "&mdash;helped to rouse
the Calvinists to these crude libels; they and other sympathizers
with the revolting colonists were so bitter that it was said that
they would have willingly burnt Wesley and his pamphlet together. A
cool letter to the press answered some of the absurd charges
brought against Wesley: that he was a Government agent, accepted
bribes, and tried for a pension. In the conclusion of this letter
Wesley wrote: "As to reviewers, news writers, London Magazines and
all that kind of gentlemen, they behave just as I thought they
would. And let them lick up Mr. Toplady's spittle still; a champion
worthy of their cause."</p>

<p>In 1778 Toplady died, aged thirty-eight, and Wesley was accused
of spreading the story that his bitterest enemy had died "in black
despair and blasphemy," and so the miserable degrading quarrels
raged, while Wesley, going deeper and deeper into party politics,
published pamphlets and preached sermons in support of the
Government. But a demand from the Excise for a list of his plate
for taxation assessment brought forth the following
reply:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Sir, I have two silver tea-spoons at London, and
two at Bristol. This is all the plate that I have at present; and I
shall not buy any more, while so many round want bread.<br>
<br>
I am, sir, your most humble servant,<br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>.</p>

<p><br>
The national distress touched him nearly. His genius for
organizing and his alert intelligence were shown in a long letter
he wrote to <i>Lloyd's Evening Post,</i> pointing out some possible
remedies for the terrible state of affairs in England. Some details
of the prevalent distress he gave at first hand; thousands of
people were starving, perishing from want in every part of
England:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">This fact I know, I have seen it with my own
eyes in every corner of the land. I have known those who could only
afford to eat a little coarse food every other day, and known one
picking up stinking sprats from a dunghill and carrying them home
for herself and children. I have known another gathering the bones
that the dogs had left and making broth of them to prolong a
wretched life.</p>

<p><br>
One of the remedies that John Wesley suggested was that
bread-corn should be used for making bread instead of for
distilling, and the whole letter shows an able grasp of the
situation and a keen application to detail. His energy and
interests were as lively as ever, but sometimes old age,
ill-health, and the confusion of the times caused a little
despondency to cloud even this clear brain and stout heart. He
wrote to Charles:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Let me be again an Oxford Methodist! I am often
in doubt whether it would not be best to resume all my Oxford
rules, great and small. I did then walk close to God and redeemed
the time, but whatever have I been doing in these present
years?</p>

<p><br>
Such moods and depression soon passed, and the vigorous old man
would not release his grasp of the thing he had made. Was not his
work itself his own justification and glorification? The buildings
in the City Road were rising; his followers were increasing, he
could afford to despise the Calvinists, who had no great man among
their ranks; Lady Huntingdon could not intimidate him, and he
thought little of her fledgling preachers, and had no reason to
restrain his opinion, since now there was no fear of wounding
George Whitefield, for whom he had always retained so tender a
regard, so high a respect. After a visit to Trevecca, when he had
been disgusted by the doctrines taught, he said: "It is no wonder
that they should preach thus. What better can be expected from raw
lads, with little understanding, little learning, and no
experience?" Continual bouts of illnesses of increasing severity
helped him to feel&mdash;often keenly&mdash;what he himself called
"the heat and the burden of the day, the insults of foes, and the
base treachery of seeming friends." But Heaven was getting nearer,
and he was no less sure of it than he had been in the days when he
had walked the cloisters of Lincoln College and meditated on how he
might save souls.</p>

<p>His intense curiosity was not abated; he read continually such
diverse books as those by Ludovico Ariosto and Francis Bacon, and
Bishop Glanville on <i>Witches and Witchcraft,</i> and other
treatises on "the wonders of the invisible world." These last books
gave him occasion to affirm in a letter to Charles yet once more
his belief in supernatural manifestations; he had been convinced
that the Fanny Parsons ghost was an imposture, but that did not
shake him. "Do you think the disturbances in my father's house a
Cock Lane story?" he asked. He went to and fro among the societies,
he noted that the reorganizing of the Kingswood schools had brought
gratifying results. While on a visit there, he was again able to
hear the cries and groans of the boys, the result of hysteria
produced by fear of Hell-fire and the stringency of the rules. The
worst aspect of John's fanaticism and ignorance showed in his
treatment of children, in whom he deliberately provoked these
painful hysterical displays, propounding to them religion, their
sins, and the life to come, till they were reduced to convulsions,
as in the case of the little girl of whom he notes with
complacency, "her breath ceased, while she listened," until she
could endure it no longer, but fell into what Wesley considered "an
ecstacy of conversion," screaming out to her grandmother: "Granny,
have you no sins to repent as I have?" Yet when he was free from
his mania he could be generous and pitiful, and the sufferings of
the poor always tormented him, as did the indifference of the rich
to the misery not many yards from their own door. He noted once
when visiting Bethnal Green: "I have not found any such
distress&mdash;no, not in the prison of Newgate. One poor man was
just creeping out of his sick-bed to his ragged wife and three
little children, who were more than half-naked, the very picture of
famine, and one bringing in a loaf of bread, they all ran and
seized it and tore it in an instant. Who would not rejoice that
there is another world?"</p>

<p>This last sentiment was one that would have irritated the
Radicals; it was one of William Cobbett's bitterest grievances
against the social system of his time that the poor were kept
quiet, drugged in their misery, by promises of what they would
enjoy in the next world.</p>

<p>In the Journal that John Wesley continued to keep regularly,
portions of which he published now and again, he still noted little
incidents that showed the powerful and sometimes dreadful effects
that his doctrine and his preaching were having upon ignorant
people. Often the Methodists rejoiced in the deaths of their little
children, because these had gone straight to Heaven; John Wesley
gives this little scene of a woman who had lost her little boy, a
child of "eminent piety, between five and six years old," who said:
"My son is gone to glory," while a consumptive youth standing up
cried out: "But I am going to Hell."</p>

<p>This lad fell into "utter despair and strong convulsions," but
died two days afterwards&mdash;in peace, or so John Wesley thought.
Then there was the man who had lost the use of his "ankles and
knees" for seven years, but who was cured by reading the Bible; the
swelling in the shoulder of one of John's horses caused him to note
that Satan had still power over his beasts but not over him. There
was the man so raving mad that he had to be chained down to the
floor, and who was yet "converted." Amid all these lively
manifestations of God's grace John was "a little surprised" to read
in Dr. Smollett's <i>History of England</i> what was a fair account
of Wesleyism:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">Imposture and fanaticism still hang on the
skirts of religion. Weak minds were seduced by the delusions of a
superstition, styled Methodism, raised upon the affection of
superior sanctity and pretensions to divine illumination. Many
thousands were infected with this enthusiasm by the endeavours of a
few obscure preachers, such as Whitefield and the two Wesleys, who
found means to lay the Kingdom under contribution.</p>

<br>

<p>"Poor Dr. Smollett!" commented John, "thus to transmit to all
succeeding generations a whole heap of notorious falsehoods!" And
after coolly refuting all that the historian said, the evangelist
asked: "Meantime, what faith can be given to his history? What
credit can any man of reason give to any fact on his authority?"
John was also shocked by reading Baron Swedenborg's <i>Heaven and
Hell;</i> he made allowances for an "overturned understanding," but
rebuked "those two pious men, Mr. Clowes and Mr. Clotworthy," for
ushering in the world this "madman's dream." What John thought
would do most harm to English people was the statement that there
was no fire in Hell, but only a bed of hot ashes, on which some of
the damned were occasionally ordered to lie down&mdash;and, worse
still, all the lost souls enjoyed their favourite pleasures. "He
that delights in filth is to have his filth; yea, and his harlot,
too! Now how dreadful a tendency must this have in such an age and
nation as this!"</p>

<p>In his seventy-third year, one of John's great humiliations fell
upon him through the Calvinists. His wife's jealousy had risen to
the point of dementia; she even accused him of being the lover of
Charles's charming and faithful Sally, herself a mother of grown-up
children. "Who will believe her now?" cried Mrs. Charles. Molly was
continually leaving her lord in fits of petulant temper and coming
back in worse fits of fury; he endured all with complete and no
doubt exasperating patience, going his own way, and still accepting
this wretched marriage as a destined cross.</p>

<p>The climax of Molly Wesley's marriage was her stealing a packet
of John's letters to his female disciples and altering them,
twisting expressions of spiritual love into those of lewd desire;
she took these documents to a gathering of members of the Calvinist
party and not only read them but allowed them to be sent to the
Calvinist press organ&mdash;The <i>Gospel Magazine&mdash;for</i>
publication. The ensuing scandal, founded on theft, forgery, and
disloyalty, somewhat overwhelmed Charles, always more warm at first
and impulsive than John. He implored his brother to defend himself
against these false charges, but Wesley calmly replied: "Brother,
when I devoted to God my ease, my time, my life, did I except my
reputation? No! Tell Sally I will take her to Canterbury
to-morrow." To Molly, then an old, unhappy woman, John wrote a
letter of dignified rebuke:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">What reparation are you willing or able to make?
Very little indeed, for the water is spilled and cannot be gathered
up. All you can do now, be you ever so willing, is to unsay what
you have said. For instance, you have said over and over again that
I have lived in adultery these twenty years. Do you believe this or
do you not? If you do, how can you live with such a monster? If you
do not, give it me under your hand.</p>

<p><br>
His conscience was clear; as formerly he had noted&mdash;he had
not left her, had not disowned her, would not recall her; she never
returned; ten years after her treachery he noted her death in his
Journal and the fact that he had not been informed of it until
after her burial. She left him a gold ring and a message, saying
that she had always loved and esteemed him. He was largely to blame
for the unhappy marriage; he should never have taken a wife, nor
expected an ignorant woman, bred a servant, to be able to make the
nice and delicate distinction between sacred and profane love.</p>

THE HOUSE IN THE CITY ROAD.</h2>

<p class="first">
ON November 1, 1778, John Wesley preached his first sermon in
the new chapel; he had laid the foundation stone a year before in a
torrent of rain; now he stood in the handsome pulpit in the
completed building, looking at the packed galleries, on the press
in the pews on which the winter light fell coldly. The site was a
hundred yards north-west from the Foundry, where he had preached
during forty years; it was opposite the jostling grave-stones of
the Dissenters' graveyard in Bunhill Fields, where Susanna Wesley
lay near the bones of Daniel Defoe, Isaac Watts, John Bunyan, Henry
Cromwell, and many another stalwart Puritan. Attached to the plain,
stout building was a house for the circuit preachers, and at the
back a large piece of ground, where John had already marked out his
grave. He was in his seventy-sixth year and still in good health,
despite his recurrent dropsy, as he noted with much praise to God;
his fine face was bleached and refined to a clear austere beauty;
the perfect proportion and shape of the skull showed through the
tightening skin, still clear, pink, and white; the saintly smile
had set, as if cut in stone, the searching eyes were still
brilliantly alive to pick out the backslider, the mocker, the
possible convert. In his black Anglican priest's garments, his
immaculate linen bands, with his delicate upraised hands, and snowy
locks, curled under at the ends, he preached rapidly in his dry,
even tones, on the old themes that repetition had turned almost
into an incantation, while the plainly-clothed Methodists swayed
together in acquiescence. When he ceased, the congregation joined
with ritualistic fervour in the dramatic rhythm of a hymn selected
from the thousands that Charles had written and John had published.
In August, 1779, John slept for the last time in the Foundry, where
his mother and Emilia had died; in the following October he took up
his residence in the new house in the City Road. "How many more
nights have I to spend here?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>It was a plain, high, gloomy house with a narrow passage and
staircase, darkly panelled, with wallpapers of dull-hued poppies
and pinks and some fine pieces of useful furniture; all was
exquisitely neat and clean, and John's few possessions were
installed here and kept in shining order. Here was his bureau and
his travelling-desk, his spurs, his hat and cloak, ready for his
innumerable journeys; his chair, shaped like a painter's "donkey,"
on which he sat astride with a lectern at the back, and drawers for
pens and paper at the side; here was the huge teapot sent by Josiah
Wedgwood, with a pleasant inscription about cosy drinking in
Paradise; here were the library, the papers, the files, the
business paraphernalia of this huge organization. John had now no
intimate relation to live with him; ailing Charles was absorbed in
his own family, Patty was an occasional visitor, Molly had gone
with her sins on her head; John had told her that he was clear of
all women save herself, and now he was clear even of her. He
settled down to the donnish, bachelor life that he really liked; he
kept the first floor for his own use; there was a parlour, a study,
a little closet for prayer, a bedroom at the back; the rest of the
house was given up to the London preachers.</p>

<p>John was now held in great respect by Church and State; since he
had proved himself, not a revolutionary but a supporter of
authority, both the temporal and the spiritual powers were eager to
honour him; he received more invitations to preach from Anglican
pulpits than he could fulfil, and he noted after he had preached in
All Hallows: "It seems, after being a scandal for fifty years, I
have at length grown into an honourable man."</p>

<p>An astonishing turn had now taken place in the fortunes of the
Wesley family. Charles and Samuel, one now a youth of twenty-one
years of age, the other thirteen years of age, had proved to be
musical geniuses, and their father allowed them to hold
subscription concerts of twelve nights' duration each year in his
house. The elder Charles was proud of his talented sons and the
sensation they caused in fashionable London, even though these
concerts were offending many of the Methodists, who contended that
though the society drawn to listen to the two boys might be
genteel, it was not religious. But the elder Charles began to rebel
against the long tyranny under which he had laboured all his life;
his rich, melodious spirit longed for some measure of freedom; he
was, perhaps, weary of writing hymns and listening to hymn tunes;
at least he defended his sons and their gifts warmly and even with
passion. There would have been a quarrel but for the imperturbable
magnanimity of John; as it was, accusations of pride and jealousy
passed between Charles Wesley and some of the other preachers, and
there was hint of trouble of this kind between the two brothers
themselves, for Charles wrote:</p>

<p>"Can you think I envy you your pre-eminence?"</p>

<p>While he vehemently declared that it was God's wish that his
sons' musical talent be cultivated, John thought the opposite; each
exasperated the other by the dead-end argument, the Divine
will.</p>

<p>John had loved singing all his life; he had often ridden over
rough and lonely roads, a book in his hand, his horse's reins slack
upon its neck, leaving the beast to find its own way, while he
raised his head and let his voice pour out praise of his Maker. But
he had no encouraging word for his nephews' gift of music. After
sitting through one of their concerts, he wrote: "I spent an
agreeable hour at a concert of my nephews, but I was a little out
of my element among lords and ladies. I love plain music and plain
company best."</p>

<p>As a contrast to this concert where he felt out of his element
were the scenes that took place shortly after at Oldham. The old
man was asked to visit a dying woman, and as soon as he entered the
room both she and her companions fell "into such emotions as is
seldom seen. Some laughed, some cried; all were so transported they
could hardly speak, for how much better it is to go to the poor
than to the rich&mdash;to the house of mourning than to the house
of feasting!" With this powerful weapon of emotionalism he
continued to keep his scattered flock together. "Spiritual gin,"
his enemies called it, when they accused John Wesley of giving his
followers the same kind of excitement as they received from
drinking, bull-baiting, the bloody heads and broken bones of street
fights. Not only had the Methodists given the lonely, the outcast,
the degraded, and the hopeless encouragement and interest, company
and an opportunity of talking about themselves to attentive
listeners, but he had given them emotional escape. Nor did John
lose his power in his old age, as he travelled from place to place:
more than one servant girl began to see visions; more than one
youth dropped in convulsions. Nor did John Wesley hesitate to claim
for himself the power of healing. A man, dying for lack of sleep,
caused by the pain produced by a poisoned toe, fell into gentle
repose after Wesley had prayed for him.</p>

<p>The energetic old man now added to his activities by publishing
<i>The Arminian Magazine</i> to rival the Calvinistic organ that
had always been a thorn in his flesh. One number of the magazine
had six original sermons by himself with grim texts such as: "Dust
thou art, unto dust thou shalt return," and a tremendous discourse
on the punishment of Hell. In an article in the same number John
Wesley went as far as he could go in the matter of tolerance when
he declared that he would not <i>kill</i> Romanists. But when one
of his nephews became a Papist John was less affected than Charles
and took a liberal view of the disaster. Among John's successes was
the case of Elizabeth Warbridge, a light-haired, ruddy-faced,
merry-hearted girl, twelve years old, a domestic servant, who
became such an ardent Methodist that her life, published under the
title of <i>The Journeyman's Daughter,</i> sold by millions of
copies, and was supposed to have been the means of converting three
hundred and fifty persons. This saintly child came from Newport,
Isle of Wight. Yet despite such instances of godliness, Wesley, in
his eightieth year, could write: "A total ignorance of God is
almost universal amongst us; the exceptions are exceedingly few,
whether among the learned or unlearned," and then proceed to lash
those vices that are always with us&mdash;luxury, lewdness,
sloth.</p>

<p>John Wesley found things pleasanter in the Netherlands, where he
went full of gracious memories of those old days when he had passed
through the Lowlands on his way to Germany. Holland was indeed a
country after his own heart, so neat, clean, pious, so orderly, and
when an English gentleman invited him to a country seat not half a
mile from Rotterdam, he noted: "I never saw so pretty a place," and
he declared that "the women and children were, in general, the most
beautiful I ever saw. They were surprisingly fair and had an
inexplicable air of innocence in their countenance." The precise
old man liked everything about the country: the churches were
"better lit than are our cathedrals"; the new workhouse outside
Amsterdam was so exceedingly neat and a model, he thought, the
English would have done we to copy.</p>

<p>Holland was indeed a country so near his own idea of perfection
that he might easily have wondered how it was that the inhabitants,
who were not Methodists, could have so much grace and
godliness.</p>

<p>When John returned he visited Kingswood School, where he found
the rules of the house faithfully observed and the children all in
good order&mdash;that is, repressed to the point of imbecility.
Still curious-minded, John was reading <i>Orlando Furioso</i>
again, and was irritated by the many improbabilities in it, such as
leaves turned into ships and stones turned into horses; "such
monstrous fictions as never appeared in the world before and, one
would hope, never will again."</p>

<p>Yet the man, so severe on a fairy tale, could note with
satisfaction that a person who was talking against "those mad
Methodists" leaned his arm on the table and died, and that, when
during one of his sermons three little children wandered out and
fell into a well, they were restored to consciousness by being
rubbed with salt and having their mouths breathed into under
Wesley's direction.</p>

<p>Sometimes the inward witness was dumb and faint, the mind
stronger than the heart. "By reason and by Scripture I see
abundantly more than I feel. I want to feel more love and zeal for
God."</p>

<p>Apart from this lack of inner warmth, a serious practical crisis
touched him nearly&mdash;that of separation from the Church; this
problem had been disturbing Anglicans and Methodists alike for
years and greatly troubling Charles, who would not see any need of
taking this terrible step&mdash;rank heresy to him&mdash;of
separating from a Church that now offered a cordial welcome to the
followers of the Wesleys.</p>

<p>But John was immovable; not in any wish to secede from the
Church, but to uphold his own rights. He believed that, as a
presbyter, he had full authority to ordain others, and though he
had nearly two hundred preachers working the sixty-nine circuits
into which the country was divided, he needed more for America and
ordained priests, not laymen, for the American Methodists, who had
greatly increased in number since the days of the Georgia
adventure, and he demanded men who could administer the
Sacraments.</p>

<p>At the same time there was a crisis in the affairs of the
Calvinist Methodists, who, interfered with in their chapels and
schools, formally seceded from the Church, put themselves under the
protection of the Toleration Act, and claimed the right to ordain
their own clergy. At Spa Fields Chapel in 1783 seven young men were
ordained by one of Lady Huntingdon's chaplains, Mr. Wills, and the
following year John Wesley, in a private room, after a religious
service, <i>set apart</i> Thomas Coke, already a deacon and priest
of the Anglican Church, for special work among the fifteen thousand
Methodists in America. "If anyone is pleased to call this a
separating from the Church, he may," said John Wesley, cool amid
the storm of excitement aroused. Charles, then a sick man, was
shocked and alarmed. "I have lived on earth a little too long, who
have lived to see this evil day." The younger brother, with his
imagination and sensitiveness, saw what John could not
see&mdash;that after the death of himself and his brother there
would be "vain janglings" among the Methodists, who would lose all
their influence and importance; "such was the case of the Moravians
when Count Zinzendorf died, so it was when Mr. Whitefield was
removed, and so it will be with the Methodists." They would be only
a new sect of Presbyterians, "settle on their knees and come to
nothing, like other Dissenters"; neither better nor worse than the
Baptist, Unitarian, or Presbyterian. It was the Church that Charles
wanted glorified, the Church to which he had given all his love,
all his labour since the days of the Holy Club; he felt a deep
personal distress at the rupture with John. "Our partnership is
ended, but not our friendship; I have taken him for better or worse
until death do us part; or rather unite us in love inseparable."
This parting was near; Charles lived four years after his brother's
first ordination, of which he wrote bitterly:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">How easy now are Bishops made,<br>
By man or woman's whim;<br>
Wesley his hands on Coke hath laid,<br>
But who laid hands on him?</p>

<p><br>
The painful quarrel dragged on with deep undercurrents of love
and admiration. John wrote: "I see no use of you and me disputing
together. You say, I separate from the Church; I say, I do not.
Then let it stand." Despite his firm, if inconsistent, attitude,
however, John Wesley was, from 1784, regarded as a Dissenter. In
this year John wrote a long letter to the young Prime Minister,
William Pitt, suggesting how money might be raised from a more
methodical way of getting in the old taxes, before new were
imposed; he ordained men for work in Scotland and for overseas. In
1785 Wesley lost two old friends, Vincent Perronet and John
Fletcher of Madeley; the following year he wrote a statement of his
own faith, feeling, though with a complete tranquillity, that he
too was nearing the end of that journey which had began
eighty-three years ago.</p>

<p>"I do not remember to have heard or read anything like my own
experience. Almost since I can remember, I have been led on in a
peculiar way. I go on in an even line, being very little raised at
one time, and depressed at another." But his placid fortitude was
greatly shaken by the separation from Charles, with whom he had
been having fresh differences over the question&mdash;who was to be
John's successor. In his last letter to his elder brother, Charles
wrote: "Stand to your own proposal; let us agree to differ; keep
your authority while you live; you cannot settle with the
succession, you cannot divine how God will settle it."</p>

<p>John, anxiously concerned for Charles, took a deep interest in
all the details of his illness, continually urging upon him daily
exercise, roasted turnips to restore his appetite, ten drops of a
mixture of vitriol in a glass of water; he also strongly advised
Charles to be electrified, "not shocked but only filled with
electric fire." John much enjoyed making up prescriptions and
giving medical advice to his friends, and eighty-five years himself
and still travelling about and preaching in all weathers, he found
time to send these minute directions to his niece, Sally Wesley,
then in charge of her father: "Boil crusts of white bread with a
few drops of lemon juice and a little sugar." He knew a lady in
Paris "who had lived several weeks without swallowing a grain, by
applying thin slices of beef to the stomach."</p>

<p>Then, too, Whitefield had been "greatly helped when attacked
with vomiting by an onion slit across and bound warm on the pit of
the stomach...But, of course, above all let prayer be made
continually."</p>

<p>While John was holding a service in Shropshire, and the
congregation were singing:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">Come let us join our friends above<br>
That have obtained the prize,<br>
And on the eager wings of love<br>
To joy celestial rise.</p>

<br>

<p>Charles died after a long decay. John, as soon as he heard the
news, sat down and wrote an affectionate letter to Sally. It was,
of course, nothing but a glorious blessing for Charles to be
translated to the heavens after which he had panted so long, but,
humanly speaking, the old man was lonely and bereaved, and a
fortnight afterwards at Bolton, when giving out his brother's hymn,
"Wrestling Jacob"&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">Come, O Thou Traveller unknown,<br>
My Company before has gone<br>
And I am left alone with Thee&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
he broke down, hid his face with his hand, sat down in the
pulpit, and wept.</p>

<p>He still had enough energy, if not enough time, to wish to write
his brother's life.</p>

<p>The entry of Charles's career was worded thus in the Conference
Minutes: "Mr. Charles Wesley, who after spending four-score years
with much pain and sorrow, quietly retired into Abraham's bosom."
He had no disease, but after a gradual decay of some months "the
weary wheels of life were still at last." He praised least his
talent for poetry, though Dr. Watts did not scruple to say that
that single poem&mdash;"Wrestling Jacob"&mdash;was worth all the
verses he himself had written.</p>

<p>John Wesley, with his usual open-handed generosity, took upon
himself the burden of his brother's widow and family, for Charles
had not left those dependent upon him well off; as John stated:
"They have said that we were well paid for our labours and indeed
so we were, but not by man."</p>

<p>It had been a painful disappointment to John that Charles,
instead of being interred in the burial-ground of his brother's
chapel in City Road, wished to be laid in the consecrated
churchyard of Marylebone. His last intelligible words had been to
the parson of the parish where he lived: "Sir, whatever the world
may have thought of me, I have lived and die a communicant of the
Church of England, and I wish to be buried in the yard of my parish
church," but this disappointment, even though he felt it as a
personal slight, did not prevent John from giving two hundred
guineas out of his own pocket to Sally Wesley and promising to help
her to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>It was near the end for him, too, now, but the last years of his
life were cheered by strange incidents that showed the emotional
value of Methodism and that the old man still possessed the
strange, magnetic power of keeping the movement alive. On one of
his visits to Bristol he enjoyed the dramatic contrast of preaching
a sermon on the fearful narrative of the rich man and Lazarus, and
afterwards dining in the Mansion House at the rich man's table.
Soon after, preaching in his own chapel on the subject of slavery,
about which he felt strongly (it was now one of the great questions
of the day), to a closely-packed congregation, a strange commotion
arose among these people, a vehement noise, that in Wesley's own
words "shot like lightning through the congregation. The terror and
confusion were inexpressible and you might have imagined the City
taken by storm. People rushed upon each other with the utmost
violence, benches were broken in pieces; nine-tenths of the
congregation seemed to be shocked with the same panic. After about
six minutes the storm ceased almost as suddenly as it rose. All
being calm, I went on without the least interruption." Wesley
believed that this disturbance was caused by Satan "fighting lest
his Kingdom should be delivered up."</p>

<p>The episode matched in strangeness that scene during his early
preaching when the floor had given way and the congregation found
themselves standing on the barrels in the cellars beneath, but,
absorbed in the specious eloquence, showed no fright and scarcely
made any movement, or that other incident when some mocking villain
having half sawn through the supports of the gallery, this
collapsed in the middle of Wesley's sermon, and though some were
killed and some injured, such was the excitement he led out the
remainder to listen to his discourse in the churchyard.</p>

<p>In 1789 he was in Scotland, announcing: "Rich and poor attended
from every quarter. Surely, the Scots were the best hearers in
Europe."</p>

<p>The old man began to be plagued with more illnesses, apart from
the serious disability from which he suffered&mdash;the dropsy; he
had cramp and little attacks of fever; he noticed the weather. "I
think it was the coldest night I ever remember. The house we were
in stood on the edge of the hill, the east wind sat full in the
window." He began to reflect upon his age. "Four years ago my sight
was as good as it was at five-and-twenty. I then began to observe
that I did not see things quite so clear with my left eye as I did
with my right. All objects appeared a little browner to that eye. I
began next to find difficulty in reading a small print by
candlelight. Thus those who 'look out of the window are
darkened'&mdash;one of the marks of old age, but I bless God that
the grasshopper is not a burden. I am still capable of travelling
and memory is much the same as ever it was, so I think in my
understanding."</p>

<p>He believed that 1789 was to be the last year of his life; he
once more sat for his picture to Romney, who much pleased him by
striking off a likeness in an hour, whereas Sir Joshua Reynolds,
the great fashionable painter of the day, had taken ten.</p>

<p>John Wesley now made definite preparations with his usual method
and order for the end. "I retired to Camberwell, and carried on my
Journal, probably as far as I shall live to write it." "I retired
to High-bury Plain, and preached to a very serious congregation,
though many of them were of the better ranks." "I left no money to
anyone in my Will because I had none, but now considering that
whenever I am removed money will soon arrive by sale of books I
added a few legacies by codicil to be paid as soon as may be."</p>

<p>His interest in worldly matters did not abate. He read the life
of Baron Trenck, and was shocked and fascinated, and wished that
none that cared for his soul would read a page of it.</p>

<p>On January 1, 1790, he noted: "I am now an old man decaying from
head to foot. My eyes are dim, my right hand shakes much, my mouth
is hot and dry every morning. I have a lingering fever almost every
day. My motion is weak and slow. However, praise to God, I do not
slack my labour. I can preach and write still." He finished his
accounts, writing at the end of them: "I can be accurate no more.
Not as I will, but as Thou wilt." With strict probity and
exactitude he had accounted for every penny that had passed through
his hands, and it was estimated that in fifty years he had given
away perhaps 40,000 in charity. He left all his property to be
divided among his schools and chapels. His gowns, cassocks, sashes,
and bands, for the use of the clergymen attending the City Road
chapel. His pelisse to the Rev. Mr. Crighton. All the rest of his
wearing apparel to four of the travelling preachers who wanted it
most, his watch to Joseph Bradford, his gold seal to Elizabeth
Ritchie, his chaise and horses to James Ward and Charles Wheeler in
trust to be sold, and the money to be divided among members of the
Select Society. Copies of his sermons to each travelling preacher
who should remain in connection six months after his decease. To
his wife's granddaughters he left all the money that might be found
in his bureau; that in his pocket to four friends. Of the first
money arising from the sale of his books after his death forty
pounds was to go to Patty, forty pounds to Mr. Crighton, sixty
pounds to Mr. Heath, and a pound each to the six poor men who
should carry his body to the grave.</p>

<p>His eye for earthly detail, even on the threshold of Heaven was
remarkable, as was notable when he rebuked one of his ministers for
wearing a ruffled shirt. Travelling up and down the country in some
places he found the societies "lessened and cold, field-preaching
discontinued, and the spirit of Methodism quite gone." Yet,
wherever he went the flame rose up again and "many souls were
greatly comforted." There were love-feasts, prayers, and emotional
scenes as in the old days. Indeed, his preaching during the whole
winter was marked by uncommon zeal. He frequently spoke, both in
his sermons and exhortations, as if each time were to be his last,
and often desired the people to receive what he announced as his
"dying charge." When he was in Yarmouth at the end of 1790, George
Crabbe was among the congregation, and heard the old man quote
Anacreon from the pulpit:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">Oft am I by women told,<br>
Poor Anacreon! thou grow'st old;<br>
See, thine hairs are falling all,<br>
Poor Anacreon! How they fall!<br>
Whether I grow old or no,<br>
By these signs I do not know;<br>
But this I need not to be told,<br>
'Tis time to <u>live</u> if I grow old&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p>He gave these lines cheerfully and with a beautiful cadence,
although so feeble that the young ministers had to assist him in
and out of the pulpit. John Wesley had almost outlived his epoch;
across the Channel were taking place events that held the germ of
extraordinary changes in thought, in politics, in the whole economy
of Europe.</p>

<p>In the back bedroom in the City Road house, all about him neat
and shining, polished furniture, clean linen, glittering china,
John Wesley awaited his end with confidence&mdash;that vast and
golden love-feast where he would meet again all those whom he had
cherished on earth. He was weakening almost daily. He allowed
himself an occasional cup of tea, and even a little claret, which
had been ordered him by his doctor.</p>

<p>The old man continued to write, not only long letters dealing
with a complication of subjects, but articles for his magazine. In
one of these he said:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">I never had any design of separating from the
Church; I have no such design now. I do not believe Methodists in
general desire it, when I am no more seen. I declare once more that
I live and die a member of the Church of England, and that none who
regard my judgment or advice can ever separate from it.</p>

<br>

<p>He saw, too, what was likely to happen to his work when he was
withdrawn from it, the creature without the creator:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">The danger of ruin to Methodism does not lie
here. It springs from quite a different quarter. Our preachers,
many of them, have fallen. They are not spiritual, they are not
alive to God. They are first enervated, fearful of shame, toil,
hardship. Give me but one hundred preachers who fear nothing but
sin, and desire nothing but God, and I care not a straw whether
they be clergymen or laymen, such alone will shake the gates of
Hell, and set up the Kingdom of Heaven upon earth.</p>

<p><br>
One of his last and most forceful sermons quoted the
lines:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">I give up every plea beside,<br>
Lord, I am damned, but Thou hast died.</p>

<p><br>
All his affairs were in exquisite order; he had done the utmost
for his creation; the Conference of 1790 had settled, as far as was
possible, the future of Methodism; he had laid down rules for the
preachers and for the building of chapels&mdash;all were to be on
the model of those in the City Road and in Bath&mdash;and there
were other regulations whereby the old man strove to leave intact
the work that he had hardly allowed another to touch.</p>

<p>In February, 1791, he wished to take his usual annual journey to
the north of Ireland, but the plans had to be postponed because of
his feebleness; yet he was able to go out to Twickenham to dine, to
Leatherhead to preach, and he found the vigour to write a warm
letter of congratulation to Wilberforce, who had brought before
Parliament the question of the abolition of slavery, which Wesley
termed "an execrable villainy to the scandal of religion, of
England, and of human nature."</p>

<p>Immediately after sending this letter&mdash;his last&mdash;his
feebleness increased, and his devoted friend, Joseph Bradford, sent
letters to the preachers asking for their prayers: "Mr. Wesley is
very ill. Pray, pray, pray."</p>

<p>The death of John Wesley could not have been other than it was;
his last thoughts were entirely occupied with the subject that had
possessed him for eighty years. How could any novelty of outlook or
expression be introduced now? The faithful friends, who gathered
round his modest, clean bed, were delighted to hear the old man's
incoherent mutterings, scraps of hymns, his wish to write down "God
is with us," his attempt to get up, and to say "Lord, Thou gayest
strength to those that can speak and to those that cannot."</p>

<p>These anxious yet exultant watchers marked that in his
wanderings he was always preaching or meeting classes. How should
he have any other hallucination? These were almost all his
experiences.</p>

<p>Propped up on the cool white pillows, he began to sing for the
last time his brother's hymns, while his sister-in-law and his
niece and other women prayed in the dark little room. He refused to
lie down, and his friends helped him to rise, putting his black
clothes on for him while he sang: "I'll praise my Maker while I've
breath." Seated in his chair he muttered: "Now we have done. Let us
all go." Waking after a sleep, he expressed his wishes to be buried
in woollens and that his body should be carried in his coffin to
the chapel.</p>

<p>He was still concerned about practical affairs, the keys of his
bureau: "I would have all things ready for my executors." He saw no
angels, he was not surrounded with visions, all was cool,
deliberate; he was not alarmed when his sight failed so that he
could not recognize anyone; his brother's hymns trickled from his
sunken mouth; Mr. Broadbent prayed that God would bless Methodism;
John was helped back to bed, and shook hands with his friends; he
muttered something that they could not understand, he repeated in a
strong, loud tone: "The best of all is, God is with us!"</p>

<p>His God would not forsake him, since He was John's own creation,
clutched like a treasure in the hand, cherished like love in the
heart. A friend put a sponge to his parched lips and he whispered:
"It will not do, we must take the consequence, never mind the poor
carcase."</p>

<p>The doctor, his sister-in-law, and his niece watched through the
night with him; scraps of prayer and praise fell from him; by the
morning there were eleven people, including a child, crowded into
the death chamber. Joseph Bradford, who had long been the old man's
loyal friend, prayed as the colourless March light fell on the dark
and spotless bed where John Wesley lay, as neat, as pale, as
serene, as if already folded in his shroud. "Farewell!" he said
suddenly, and as Bradford hushed his own voice, rose and peered, he
saw that John Wesley was dead. It was ten o'clock on Wednesday,
March 2, 1791; and John was in his eighty-ninth year.</p>

<p>Bradford gave a signal; the watchers rose with a rustling
movement like a sigh and began to sing the soothing
melody:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">Waiting to receive Thy spirit,<br>
Lo! The Saviour stands above;<br>
Shows the purchase of His merit,<br>
Reaches out the crown of love.</p>

<p><br>
John Wesley had left no trouble for anyone to take on his
behalf; the spot was ready, behind his chapel, where he wished his
frail bones to lie. March 9 was fixed for his funeral, but such a
vast crowd promised to attend that it was thought advisable to have
only a few personal friends present. He was buried at five o'clock
on a dull stormy morning, when it was scarcely light, but even so,
hundreds pressed in the burial-ground already rank with the bodies
of the saved. Each of these mourners had a curious memorial&mdash;a
wafer in an envelope, on which was impressed a likeness to John
Wesley, wearing his canonicals, adorned with a halo and a crown,
both of which he might be supposed to be now wearing. Soon after
the grave was opened to receive the body of Patty, widow of Westley
Hall, the last survivor of the family of Susanna and Samuel Wesley
of Epworth Rectory.</p>

<p>Few men had been more completely successful in what they had
undertaken than was John Wesley. To making Methodism he devoted all
his uncommon abilities, his inexhaustible physical energy, his
cheerfulness; to this he gave the great driving power of his
narrow-minded intolerance, the force of his obsession with the God
of his choice. Even his own inconsistencies, which he was probably
unaware of himself, helped him in his labours; how convenient for
Methodism that John Wesley was able, on the one hand, to believe in
such as Margaret Barlow, and, on the other, to disbelieve in the
fairy stories of Ariosto! What a power there was in a doctrine that
allowed him, on the one hand, to employ the full forces of
emotionalism, to provoke people into incoherent hysterical ravings
and lunatic action, and yet, on the other hand, to call all these
same people to answer for their smallest actions in the name of
method, reason, law, and order. With these two
weapons&mdash;emotional appeal and method&mdash;John Wesley ruled
for at least fifty years almost half the population of England, for
many fell under his influence who did not definitely enrol
themselves as his followers. This was a proud achievement for the
son of the Epworth Rectory. He might well flatter himself that he
was a brand plucked from the burning to do God's work, or rather to
do John Wesley's work, for he had truly created a God in his own
image, in much the same way as the primitive man who raises up a
roughly-hewn stone as fetish attempts to copy his own humanity.
This God was a counterpart of John Wesley himself, had all his own
virtues and all his own faults, and in serving this God John Wesley
was serving himself. His highest ideals, his worldly arrogance and
pride, his credulity, his intelligence that he tried to stifle but
that now and then broke its bonds and spoke clearly, little virtues
like neatness and large virtues like magnanimity, his great faults
like intolerance, little faults like jealousy&mdash;all these,
compounded out of his own heart and brain, made the God whom John
Wesley so dutifully served "the inward witness" who was with him to
the end. Jacob had wrestled, had prayed, and had obtained his
blessing.</p>
