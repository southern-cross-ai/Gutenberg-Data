    An Open Door</b></h2>
  <p align="left">It  was a night to drive any man indoors. Not only was the darkness impenetrable,  but the raw mist enveloping hill and valley made the open road anything but  desirable to a belated wayfarer like myself.</p>
  <p align="left">Being  young, untrammeled, and naturally indifferent to danger, I was not averse to  adventure; and having my fortune to make, was always on the lookout for El  Dorado, which, to ardent souls, lies ever beyond the next turning.  Consequently, when I saw a light shimmering through the mist at my right, I  resolved to make for it and the shelter it so opportunely offered.</p>
  <p align="left">But  I did not realize then, as I do now, that shelter does not necessarily imply  refuge, or I might not have undertaken this adventure with so light a heart.  Yet, who knows? The impulses of an unfettered spirit lean toward daring, and  youth, as I have said, seeks the strange, the unknown and, sometimes, the  terrible.</p>
  <p align="left">My  path toward this light was by no means an easy one. After confused wanderings  through tangled hedges, and a struggle with obstacles of whose nature I  received the most curious impression in the surrounding murk, I arrived in  front of a long, low building which, to my astonishment, I found standing with  doors and windows open to the pervading mist, save for one square casement  through which the light shone from a row of candles placed on a long mahogany  table.</p>
  <p align="left">The  quiet and seeming emptiness of this odd and picturesque building made me pause.  I am not much affected by visible danger, but this silent room, with its air of  sinister expectancy, struck me most unpleasantly, and I was about to reconsider  my first impulse and withdraw again to the road, when a second look, thrown  back upon the comfortable interior I was leaving, convinced me of my folly and  sent me straight toward the door which stood so invitingly open.</p>
  <p align="left">But  half-way up the path, my progress was again stayed by the sight of a man  issuing from the house I had so rashly looked upon as devoid of all human  presence. He seemed in haste and, at the moment my eye first fell on him, was  engaged in replacing his watch in his pocket.</p>
  <p align="left">But  he did not shut the door behind him, which I thought odd, especially as his  final glance had been a backward one, and seemed to take in all the  appointments of the place he was so hurriedly leaving.</p>
  <p align="left">As  we met, he raised his hat. This likewise struck me as peculiar, for the  deference he displayed was more marked than that usually bestowed on strangers,  while his lack of surprise at an encounter more or less startling in such a  mist was calculated to puzzle an ordinary man like myself. Indeed, he was so little  impressed by my presence there that he was for passing me without a word or any  other hint of good fellowship, save the bow of which I have spoken. But this  did not suit me. I was hungry, cold, and eager for creature comforts, and the  house before me gave forth not only heat, but a savory odor which in itself was  an invitation hard to ignore. I therefore accosted the man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will  bed and supper be provided me here?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I am tired out with a long tramp  over the hills, and hungry enough to pay anything in reason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  stopped, for the man had disappeared. He had not paused at my appeal and the  mist had swallowed him. But at the break in my sentence, his voice came back in  good-natured tones and I heard:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Supper  will be ready at nine, and there are beds for all. Enter, sir; you are the  first to arrive, but the others can not be far behind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  queer greeting, certainly. But when I strove to question him as to its meaning,  his voice returned to me from such a distance that I doubted if my words had  reached him with any more distinctness than his answer reached me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;  thought I, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t as if a lodging had been denied me. He invited me to  enter, and enter I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  house, to which I now naturally directed a glance of much more careful scrutiny  than before, was no ordinary farm-building, but a rambling old mansion, made  conspicuously larger here and there by jutting porches and more than one  convenient lean-to. Though furnished, warmed and lighted with candles, as I  have previously described, it had about it an air of disuse which made me feel  myself an intruder, in spite of the welcome I had received. But I was not in a  position to stand upon ceremony, and ere long I found myself inside the great  room and before the blazing logs whose glow had lighted up the doorway and  added its own attraction to the other allurements of the inviting place.</p>
  <p align="left">Though  the open door made a draft which was anything but pleasant, I did not feel like  closing it, and was astonished to observe the effect of the mist through the square  thus left open to the night. It was not an agreeable one, and, instinctively  turning my back upon that quarter of the room, I let my eyes roam over the  wainscoted walls and the odd pieces of furniture which gave such an air of  old-fashioned richness to the place. As nothing of the kind had ever fallen  under my eyes before, I should have thoroughly enjoyed this opportunity of  gratifying my taste for the curious and the beautiful, if the quaint old chairs  I saw standing about me on every side had not all been empty. But the solitude  of the place, so much more oppressive than the solitude of the road I had left,  struck cold to my heart, and I missed the cheer rightfully belonging to such  attractive surroundings. Suddenly I bethought me of the many other apartments  likely to be found in so spacious a dwelling, and, going to the nearest door, I  opened it and called out for the master of the house. But only an echo came  back, and, returning to the fire, I sat down before the cheering blaze, in  quiet acceptance of a situation too lonely for comfort, yet not without a  certain piquant interest for a man of free mind and adventurous disposition  like myself.</p>
  <p align="left">After  all, if supper was to be served at nine, someone must be expected to eat it: I  should surely not be left much longer without companions.</p>
  <p align="left">Meanwhile  ample amusement awaited me in the contemplation of a picture which, next to the  large fireplace, was the most prominent object in the room. This picture was a  portrait, and a remarkable one. The countenance it portrayed was both  characteristic and forcible, and so interested me that in studying it I quite  forgot both hunger and weariness. Indeed its effect upon me was such that,  after gazing at it uninterruptedly for a few minutes, I discovered that its  various features&mdash;the narrow eyes in which a hint of craft gave a strange gleam  to their native intelligence; the steadfast chin, strong as the rock of the  hills I had wearily tramped all day; the cunning wrinkles which yet did not  interfere with a latent great-heartedness that made the face as attractive as  it was puzzling&mdash;had so established themselves in my mind that I continued to  see them before me whichever way I turned, and found it impossible to shake off  their influence even after I had resolutely set my mind in another direction by  endeavoring to recall what I knew of the town into which I had strayed.</p>
  <p align="left">I  had come from Scranton and was now, according to my best judgment, in one of  those rural districts of western Pennsylvania which breed such strange and sturdy  characters. But of this special neighborhood, its inhabitants and its  industries, I knew nothing nor was likely to, so long as I remained in the  solitude I have endeavored to describe.</p>
  <p align="left">But  these impressions and these thoughts&mdash;if thoughts they were&mdash;presently received a  check. A loud &ldquo;Halloo&rdquo; rose from somewhere in the mist, followed by a string of  muttered imprecations, which convinced me that the person now attempting to  approach the house was encountering some of the many difficulties which had  beset me in the same undertaking a few minutes before.</p>
  <p align="left">I  therefore raised my voice and shouted out, &ldquo;Here! this way!&rdquo; after which I sat  still and awaited developments.</p>
  <p align="left">There  was a huge clock in one of the corners, whose loud tick filled up every  interval of silence. By this clock it was just ten minutes to eight when two  gentlemen (I should say men, and coarse men at that) crossed the open threshold  and entered the house.</p>
  <p align="left">Their  appearance was more or less noteworthy&mdash;unpleasantly so, I am obliged to add.  One was red-faced and obese, the other was tall, thin and wiry and showed as  many seams in his face as a blighted apple. Neither of the two had anything to  recommend him either in appearance or address, save a certain veneer of polite  assumption as transparent as it was offensive. As I listened to the forced  sallies of the one and the hollow laugh of the other, I was glad that I was  large of frame and strong of arm and used to all kinds of men and&mdash;brutes.</p>
  <p align="left">As  these two new-comers seemed no more astonished at my presence than the man I  had met at the gate, I checked the question which instinctively rose to my lips  and with a simple bow,&mdash;responded to by a more or less familiar nod from  either,&mdash;accepted the situation with all the sang-froid the occasion seemed  to demand. Perhaps this was wise, perhaps it was not; there was little  opportunity to judge, for the start they both gave as they encountered the eyes  of the picture before mentioned drew my attention to a consideration of the  different ways in which men, however similar in other respects, express sudden  and unlooked-for emotion. The big man simply allowed his astonishment, dread,  or whatever the feeling was which moved him, to ooze forth in a cold and  deathly perspiration which robbed his cheeks of color and cast a bluish shadow  over his narrow and retreating temples; while the thin and waspish man, caught  in the same trap (for trap I saw it was), shouted aloud in his ill-timed mirth,  the false and cruel character of which would have made me shudder, if all  expression of feeling on my part had not been held in check by the interest I  immediately experienced in the display of open bravado with which, in another  moment, these two tried to carry off their mutual embarrassment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good  likeness, eh?&rdquo; laughed the seamy-faced man. &ldquo;Quite an idea, that! Makes him one  of us again! Well, he&rsquo;s welcome&mdash;in oils. Can&rsquo;t say much to us from canvas, eh?&rdquo;  And the rafters above him vibrated, as his violent efforts at joviality went up  in loud and louder assertion from his thin throat.</p>
  <p align="left">A  nudge from the other&rsquo;s elbow stopped him and I saw them both cast  half-lowering, half-inquisitive glances in my direction.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One  of the Witherspoon boys?&rdquo; queried one.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  snarled the other. &ldquo;I never saw but one of them. There are five, aren&rsquo;t there?  Eustace believed in marrying off his gals young.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Damn  him, yes. And he&rsquo;d have married them off younger if he had known how numbers  were going to count some day among the Westonhaughs.&rdquo; And he laughed again in a  way I should certainly have felt it my business to resent, if my indignation as  well as the ill-timed allusions which had called it forth had not been put to  an end by a fresh arrival through the veiling mist which hung like a shroud at  the doorway.</p>
  <p align="left">This  time it was for me to experience a shock of something like fear. Yet the  personage who called up this unlooked-for sensation in my naturally hardy  nature was old and, to all appearance, harmless from disability, if not from  good will. His form was bent over upon itself like a bow; and only from the glances  he shot from his upturned eyes was the fact made evident that a redoubtable  nature, full of force and malignity, had just brought its quota of evil into a  room already overflowing with dangerous and menacing passions.</p>
  <p align="left">As  this old wretch, either from the feebleness of age or from the infirmity I have  mentioned, had great difficulty in walking, he had brought with him a small  boy, whose business it was to direct his tottering steps as best he could.</p>
  <p align="left">But  once settled in his chair, he drove away this boy with his pointed oak stick,  and with some harsh words about caring for the horse and being on time in the  morning, he sent him out into the mist. As this little shivering and pathetic  figure vanished, the old man drew, with gasp and haw, a number of deep breaths  which shook his bent back and did their share, no doubt, in restoring his own  disturbed circulation. Then, with a sinister twist which brought his pointed  chin and twinkling eyes again into view, he remarked:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t  ye a word for kinsman Luke, you two? It isn&rsquo;t often I get out among ye. Shakee,  nephew! Shakee, Hector! And now who&rsquo;s the boy in the window? My eyes aren&rsquo;t  what they used to be, but he don&rsquo;t seem to favor the Westonhaughs over-much.  One of Salmon&rsquo;s four grandchildren, think &lsquo;e? Or a shoot from Eustace&rsquo;s gnarled  old trunk? His gals all married Americans, and one of them, I&rsquo;ve been told, was  a yellow-haired giant like this fellow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As  this description pointed directly toward me, I was about to venture a response  on my own account, when my attention, as well as theirs, was freshly attracted  by a loud &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; at the gate, followed by the hasty but assured entrance of a  dapper, wizen, but perfectly preserved little old gentleman with a bag in his  hand. Looking askance with eyes that were like two beads, first at the two men  who were now elbowing each other for the best place before the fire, and then  at the revolting figure in the chair, he bestowed his greeting, which consisted  of an elaborate bow, not on them, but upon the picture hanging so conspicuously  on the open wall before him; and then, taking me within the scope of his quick,  circling glance, cried out with an assumption of great cordiality:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good  evening, gentlemen; good evening one, good evening all. Nothing like being on  the tick. I&rsquo;m sorry the night has turned out so badly. Some may find it too  thick for travel. That would be bad, eh? very bad&mdash;for them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As  none of the men he openly addressed saw fit to answer, save by the hitch of a  shoulder or a leer quickly suppressed, I kept silent also. But this reticence,  marked as it was, did not seem to offend the new-comer. Shaking the wet from  the umbrella he held, he stood the dripping article up in a corner and then  came and placed his feet on the fender. To do this he had to crowd between the  two men already occupying the best part of the hearth. But he showed no concern  at incommoding them, and bore their cross looks and threatening gestures with  professional equanimity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  know me?&rdquo; he now unexpectedly snapped, bestowing another look over his shoulder  at that oppressive figure in the chair. (Did I say that I had risen when the  latter sat?) &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no Westonhaugh, I; nor yet a Witherspoon nor a Clapsaddle. I&rsquo;m  only Smead, the lawyer. Mr. Anthony Westonhaugh&rsquo;s lawyer,&rdquo; he repeated, with  another glance of recognition in the direction of the picture. &ldquo;I drew up his  last will and testament, and, until all of his wishes have been duly carried  out, am entitled by the terms of that will to be regarded both legally and  socially as his representative. This you all know, but it is my way to make  everything clear as I proceed. A lawyer&rsquo;s trick, no doubt. I do not pretend to  be entirely exempt from such.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  grumble from the large man, who seemed to have been disturbed in some absorbing  calculation he was carrying on, mingled with a few muttered words of forced  acknowledgment from the restless old sinner in the chair, made it unnecessary  for me to reply, even if the last comer had given me the opportunity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  getting late!&rdquo; he cried, with an easy garrulity rather amusing, under the  circumstances. &ldquo;Two more trains came in as I left the depot. If old Phil was on  hand with his wagon, several more members of this interesting family may be  here before the clock strikes; if not, the assemblage is like to be small. Too  small,&rdquo; I heard him grumble a minute after, under his breath.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  wish it were a matter of one,&rdquo; spoke up the big man, striking his breast in a  way to make it perfectly apparent whom he meant by that word one. And having (if I may  judge by the mingled laugh and growl of his companions) thus shown his hand  both figuratively and literally, he relapsed into the calculation which seemed  to absorb all of his unoccupied moments.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Generous,  very!&rdquo; commented the lawyer in a murmur which was more than audible. &ldquo;Pity that  sentiments of such broad benevolence should go unrewarded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This,  because at that very instant wheels were heard in front, also a jangle of  voices, in some controversy about fares, which promised anything but a pleasing  addition to the already none too desirable company.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  suppose that&rsquo;s sister Janet,&rdquo; snarled out the one addressed as Hector. There  was no love in his voice, despite the relationship hinted at, and I awaited the  entrance of this woman with some curiosity.</p>
  <p align="left">But  her appearance, heralded by many a puff and pant which the damp air exaggerated  in a prodigious way, did not seem to warrant the interest I had shown in it. As  she stepped into the room, I saw only a big frowsy woman, who had attempted to  make a show with a new silk dress and a hat in the latest fashion, but who had  lamentably failed, owing to the slouchiness of her figure and some misadventure  by which her hat had been set awry on her head and her usual complacency  destroyed. Later, I noted that her down-looking eyes had a false twinkle in  them, and that, commonplace as she looked, she was one to steer clear of in  times of necessity and distress.</p>
  <p align="left">She,  too, evidently expected to find the door open and people assembled, but she had  not anticipated being confronted by the portrait on the wall, and cringed in an  unpleasant way as she stumbled by it into one of the ill-lighted corners.</p>
  <p align="left">The  old man, who had doubtless caught the rustle of her dress as she passed him,  emitted one short sentence.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Almost  late,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p align="left">Her  answer was a sputter of words.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the fault of that driver,&rdquo; she complained. &ldquo;If he had taken one drop more at  the half-way house, I might really not have got here at all. That would not  have inconvenienced you.  But oh! what a grudge I would have owed that skinflint brother of ours&rdquo;&mdash;here  she shook her fist at the picture&mdash;&ldquo;for making our good luck depend upon our  arrival within two short strokes of the clock!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  are several to come yet,&rdquo; blandly observed the lawyer. But before the words  were well out of his mouth, we all became aware of a new presence&mdash;a woman,  whose somber grace and quiet bearing gave distinction to her unobtrusive  entrance, and caused a feeling of something like awe to follow the first sight  of her cold features and deep, heavily-fringed eyes. But this soon passed in  the more human sentiment awakened by the soft pleading which infused her gaze  with a touching femininity. She wore a long loose garment which fell without a  fold from chin to foot, and in her arms she seemed to carry something.</p>
  <p align="left">Never  before had I seen so beautiful a woman. As I was contemplating her, with  respect but yet with a masculine intentness I could not quite suppress, two or  three other persons came in. And now I began to notice that the eyes of all  these people turned mainly one way, and that was toward the clock. Another  small circumstance likewise drew my attention. Whenever any one entered,&mdash;and  there were one or two additional arrivals during the five minutes preceding the  striking of the hour,&mdash;a frown settled for an instant on every brow, giving to  each and all a similar look, for the interpretation of which I lacked the key.  Yet not on every brow either. There was one which remained undisturbed and  showed only a grand patience.</p>
  <p align="left">As  the hands of the big clock neared the point of eight, a furtive smile appeared  on more than one face; and when the hour rang out, a sigh of satisfaction swept  through the room, to which the little old lawyer responded with a worldly-wise  grunt, as he moved from his place and proceeded to the door.</p>
  <p align="left">This  he had scarcely shut when a chorus of voices rose from without. Three or four  lingerers had pushed their way as far as the gate, only to see the door of the  house shut in their faces.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Too  late!&rdquo; growled old man Luke from between the locks of his long beard.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Too  late!&rdquo; shrieked the woman who had come so near being late herself.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Too  late!&rdquo; smoothly acquiesced the lawyer, locking and bolting the door with a deft  and assured hand.</p>
  <p align="left">But  the four or five persons who thus found themselves barred out did not accept  without a struggle the decision of the more fortunate ones assembled within.  More than one hand began pounding on the door, and we could hear cries of, &ldquo;The  train was behind time!&rdquo; &ldquo;Your clock is fast!&rdquo; &ldquo;You are cheating us; you want it  all for yourselves!&rdquo; &ldquo;We will have the law on you!&rdquo; and other bitter  adjurations unintelligible to me from my ignorance of the circumstances which  called them forth.</p>
  <p align="left">But  the wary old lawyer simply shook his head and answered nothing; whereat a  murmur of gratification rose from within, and a howl of almost frenzied dismay  from without, which latter presently received point from a startling vision  which now appeared at the casement where the lights burned. A man&rsquo;s face looked  in, and behind it, that of a woman, so wild and maddened by some sort of  heart-break that I found my sympathies aroused in spite of the glare of evil  passions which made both of these countenances something less than human.</p>
  <p align="left">But  the lawyer met the stare of these four eyes with a quiet chuckle, which found  its echo in the ill-advised mirth of those about him; and moving over to the  window where they still peered in, he drew together the two heavy shutters  which hitherto had stood back against the wall, and, fastening them with a bar,  shut out the sight of this despair, if he could not shut out the protests which  ever and anon were shouted through the key-hole.</p>
  <p align="left">Meanwhile,  one form had sat through this whole incident without a gesture; and on the  quiet brow, from which I could not keep my eyes, no shadows appeared save the  perpetual one of native melancholy, which was at once the source of its  attraction and the secret of its power.</p>
  <p align="left">Into  what sort of gathering had I stumbled? And why did I prefer to await  developments rather than ask the simplest question of any one about me?</p>
  <p align="left">Meantime  the lawyer had proceeded to make certain preparations. With the help of one or  two willing hands, he had drawn the great table into the middle of the room  and, having seen the candles restored to their places, began to open his small  bag and take from it a roll of paper and several flat documents. Laying the  latter in the center of the table and slowly unrolling the former, he  consulted, with his foxy eyes, the faces surrounding him, and smiled with  secret malevolence, as he noted that every chair and every form were turned  away from the picture before which he had bent with such obvious courtesy, on  entering. I alone stood erect, and this possibly was why a gleam of curiosity  was noticeable in his glance, as he ended his scrutiny of my countenance and  bent his gaze again upon the paper he held.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo;  thought I. &ldquo;What shall I answer this man if he asks me why I continued to  remain in a spot where I have so little business.&rdquo; The impulse came to go. But  such was the effect of this strange convocation of persons, at night and in a  mist which was itself a nightmare, that I failed to take action and remained  riveted to my place, while Mr. Smead consulted his roll and finally asked in a  business-like tone, quite unlike his previous sarcastic speech, the names of  those whom he had the pleasure of seeing before him.</p>
  <p align="left">The  old man in the chair spoke up first.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Luke  Westonhaugh,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  good!&rdquo; responded the lawyer.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hector  Westonhaugh,&rdquo; came from the thin man.</p>
  <p align="left">A  nod and a look toward the next.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;John  Westonhaugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nephew?&rdquo;  asked the lawyer.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go  on, and be quick; supper will be ready at nine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Eunice  Westonhaugh,&rdquo; spoke up a soft voice.</p>
  <p align="left">I  felt my heart bound as if some inner echo responded to that name.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Daughter  of whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hudson  Westonhaugh,&rdquo; she gently faltered. &ldquo;My father is dead&mdash;died last night;&mdash;I am his  only heir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  grumble of dissatisfaction and a glint of unrelieved hate came from the  doubled-up figure, whose malevolence had so revolted me.</p>
  <p align="left">But  the lawyer was not to be shaken.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  good! It is fortunate you trusted your feet rather than the train. And now you!  What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He  was looking, not at me as I had at first feared, but at the man next to me, a  slim but slippery youth, whose small red eyes made me shudder.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;William  Witherspoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Barbara&rsquo;s  son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where  are your brothers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One  of them, I think, is outside&rdquo;&mdash;here he laughed;&mdash;&ldquo;the other is&mdash;sick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  way he uttered this word made me set him down as one to be especially wary of  when he smiled. But then I had already passed judgment on him at my first view.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  you, madam?&rdquo;&mdash;this to the large, dowdy woman with the uncertain eye, a contrast  to the young and melancholy Eunice.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Janet  Clapsaddle,&rdquo; she replied, waddling hungrily forward and getting unpleasantly  near the speaker, for he moved off as she approached, and took his stand in the  clear place at the head of the table.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  good, Mistress Clapsaddle. You were a Westonhaugh, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  believe,  sneak-faced hypocrite that you are!&rdquo; she blurted out. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your  lawyer ways. I like plain speaking myself. Don&rsquo;t you know me, and Luke and  Hector, and&mdash;and most of us indeed, except that puny, white-faced girl yonder,  whom, having been brought up on the other side of the Ridge, we have none of us  seen since she was a screaming baby in Hildegarde&rsquo;s arms. And the young  gentleman over there,&rdquo;&mdash;here she indicated me&mdash;&ldquo;who shows so little likeness to  the rest of the family. He will have to make it pretty plain who his father was  before we shall feel like acknowledging him, either as the son of one of  Eustace&rsquo;s girls, or a chip from brother Salmon&rsquo;s hard old block.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As  this caused all eyes to turn upon me, even hers, I smiled as I stepped  forward. The lawyer did not return that smile.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  is your name?&rdquo; he asked shortly and sharply, as if he distrusted me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hugh  Austin,&rdquo; was my quiet reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no such name on the list,&rdquo; snapped old Smead, with an authoritative gesture  toward those who seemed anxious to enter a protest.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probably  not,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;for I am neither a Witherspoon, a Westonhaugh nor a  Clapsaddle. I am merely a chance wayfarer passing through the town on my way  west. I thought this house was a tavern, or at least a place I could lodge in.  The man I met in the doorway told me as much, and so I am here. If my company  is not agreeable, or if you wish this room to yourselves, let me go into the  kitchen. I promise not to meddle with the supper, hungry as I am. Or perhaps  you wish me to join the crowd outside; it seems to be increasing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; came from all parts of the room. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the door be opened. Nothing  could keep Lemuel and his crowd out if they once got foot over the threshold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  lawyer rubbed his chin. He seemed to be in some sort of quandary. First he  scrutinized me from under his shaggy brows with a sharp gleam of suspicion;  then his features softened and, with a side glance at the young woman who  called herself Eunice, (perhaps, because she was worth looking at, perhaps  because she had partly risen at my words), he slipped toward a door I had  before observed in the wainscoting on the left of the mantelpiece, and softly  opened it upon what looked like a narrow staircase.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  can not let you go out,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and we can not let you have a finger in our  viands before the hour comes for serving them; so if you will be so good as to  follow this staircase to the top, you will find it ends in a room comfortable  enough for the wayfarer you call yourself. In that room you can rest till the  way is clear for you to continue your travels. Better, we can not do for you.  This house is not a tavern, but the somewhat valuable property of&mdash;&rdquo; He turned  with a bow and smile, as every one there drew a deep breath; but no one  ventured to end that sentence.</p>
  <p align="left">I  would have given all my future prospects (which, by the way, were not very  great) to remain in that room. The oddity of the situation; the mystery of the  occurrence; the suspense I saw in every face; the eagerness of the cries I  heard redoubled from time to time outside; the malevolence but poorly disguised  in the old lawyer&rsquo;s countenance; and, above all, the presence of that  noble-looking woman, which was the one off-set to the general tone of villainy  with which the room was charged, filled me with curiosity, if I might call it  by no other name, that made my acquiescence in the demand thus made upon me  positively heroic. But there seemed no other course for me to follow, and with  a last lingering glance at the genial fire and a quick look about me, which  happily encountered hers, I stooped my head to suit the low and narrow doorway  opened for my accommodation, and instantly found myself in darkness. The door  had been immediately closed by the lawyer&rsquo;s impatient hand.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2"></a>Chapter 2</b><br>
      <b>With My Ear To The Wainscoting</b></h2>
  <p align="left">No  move more unwise could have been made by the old lawyer,&mdash;that is, if his  intention had been to rid himself of an unwelcome witness. For, finding myself  thrust thus suddenly from the scene, I naturally stood still instead of  mounting the stairs, and, by standing still, discovered that though shut from  sight I was not from sound. Distinctly through the panel of the door, which was  much thinner, no doubt, than the old fox imagined, I heard one of the men  present shout out:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  that makes the number less by one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  murmur which followed this remark came plainly to my ears, and, greatly  rejoicing over what I considered my good luck, I settled myself on the lowest  step of the stairs in the hope of catching some word which would reveal to me  the mystery of this scene.</p>
  <p align="left">It  was not long in coming. Old Smead had now his audience before him in good  shape, and his next words were of a character to make evident the purpose of  this meeting.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Heirs  of Anthony Westonhaugh, deceased,&rdquo; he began in a sing-song voice strangely  unmusical, &ldquo;I congratulate you upon your good fortune at being at this especial  moment on the inner rather than outer side of your amiable relative&rsquo;s front  door. His will, which you have assembled to hear read, is well known to you. By  it his whole property&mdash;(not so large as some of you might wish, but yet a goodly  property for farmers like yourselves)&mdash;is to be divided this night, share and  share alike, among such of his relatives as have found it convenient to be  present here between the strokes of half-past seven and eight. If some of our  friends have failed us through sloth, sickness or the misfortune of mistaking  the road, they have our sympathy, but they can not have his dollars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can  not have his dollars!&rdquo; echoed a rasping voice which, from its smothered sound,  probably came from the bearded lips of the old reprobate in the chair.</p>
  <p align="left">The  lawyer waited for one or two other repetitions of this phrase (a phrase which,  for some unimaginable reason, seemed to give him an odd sort of pleasure), then  he went on with greater distinctness and a certain sly emphasis, chilling in  effect but very professional:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ladies  and gentlemen: Shall I read this will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  no! The division! the division! Tell us what we are to have!&rdquo; rose in a shout  about him.</p>
  <p align="left">There  was a pause. I could imagine the sharp eyes of the lawyer traveling from face  to face as each thus gave voice to his cupidity, and the thin curl of his lips  as he remarked in a slow tantalizing way:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  was more in the old man&rsquo;s clutches than you think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  gasp of greed shook the partition against which my ear was pressed. Some one  must have drawn up against the wainscoting since my departure from the room. I  found myself wondering which of them it was. Meantime old Smead was having his  say, with the smoothness of a man who perfectly understands what is required of  him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Westonhaugh would not have put you to so much trouble or had you wait so long  if he had not expected to reward you amply. There are shares in this bag which  are worth thousands instead of hundreds. Now, now! stop that! hands off! hands  off! there are calculations to make first. How many of you are there? Count up,  some of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nine!&rdquo;  called out a voice with such rapacious eagerness that the word was almost  unintelligible.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nine.&rdquo;  How slowly the old knave spoke! What pleasure he seemed to take in the suspense  he purposely made as exasperating as possible!</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  if each one gets his share, he may count himself richer by two hundred thousand  dollars than when he came in here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Two  hundred thousand dollars! They had expected no more than thirty. Surprise made  them speechless,&mdash;that is, for a moment; then a pandemonium of hurrahs, shrieks  and loud-voiced enthusiasm made the room ring, till wonder seized them again,  and a sudden silence fell, through which I caught a far-off wail of grief from  the disappointed ones without, which, heard in the dark and narrow place in  which I was confined, had a peculiarly weird and desolate effect.</p>
  <p align="left">Perhaps  it likewise was heard by some of the fortunate ones within! Perhaps one head,  to mark which, in this moment of universal elation, I would have given a year  from my life, turned toward the dark without, in recognition of the despair  thus piteously voiced; but if so, no token of the same came to me, and I could  but hope that she had shown, by some such movement, the natural sympathy of her  sex.</p>
  <p align="left">Meanwhile  the lawyer was addressing the company in his smoothest and most sarcastic  tones.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Westonhaugh was a wise man, a very wise man,&rdquo; he droned. &ldquo;He foresaw what your  pleasure would be, and left a letter for you. But before I read it, before I  invite you to the board he ordered to be spread for you in honor of this happy  occasion, there is one appeal he bade me make to those I should find assembled  here. As you know, he was not personally acquainted with all the children and  grandchildren of his many brothers and sisters. Salmon&rsquo;s sons, for instance,  were perfect strangers to him, and all those boys and girls of the Evans&rsquo;  branch have never been long enough this side of the mountains for him to know  their names, much less their temper or their lives. Yet his heirs&mdash;or such was  his wish, his great wish&mdash;must be honest men, righteous in their dealings, and  of stainless lives. If therefore, any one among you feels that for reasons he  need not state, he has no right to accept his share of Anthony Westonhaugh&rsquo;s  bounty, then that person is requested to withdraw before this letter to his  heirs is read.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Withdraw?  Was the man a fool? Withdraw?&mdash;these  cormorants! these suckers of blood! these harpies and vultures! I laughed as I  imagined sneaking Hector, malicious Luke or brutal John responding to this  na&iuml;ve appeal, and then found myself wondering why no echo of my mirth came from  the men themselves. They must have seen much more plainly than I did the  ludicrousness of their weak old kinsman&rsquo;s demand; yet Luke was still; Hector  was still; and even John, and the three or four others I have mentioned gave  forth no audible token of disdain or surprise. I was asking myself what  sentiment of awe or fear restrained these selfish souls, when I became  conscious of a movement within, which presently resolved itself into a  departing foot-step.</p>
  <p align="left">Some  conscience there had been awakened. Some one was crossing the floor toward the  door. Who? I waited in anxious expectancy for the word which was to enlighten  me. Happily it came soon, and from the old lawyer&rsquo;s lips.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  do not feel yourself worthy?&rdquo; he queried, in tones I had not heard from him  before. &ldquo;Why? What have you done that you should forego an inheritance to which  these others feel themselves honestly entitled?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  voice which answered gave both my mind and heart a shock. It was she who had  risen at this call. She,  the only true-faced person there!</p>
  <p align="left">Anxiously  I listened for her reply. Alas! it was one of action rather than speech. As I  afterward heard, she simply opened her long cloak and showed a little infant  slumbering in her arms.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This  is my reason,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I have sinned in the eyes of the world, therefore I  can not take my share of Uncle Anthony&rsquo;s money. I did not know he exacted an  unblemished record from those he expected to enrich, or I would not have come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  sob which followed these last words showed at what a cost she thus renounced a  fortune of which she, of all present, perhaps, stood in the greatest need; but  there was no lingering in her step; and to me, who understood her fault only  through the faint sound of infantile wailing which accompanied her departure,  there was a nobility in her action which raised her in an instant to an almost  ideal height of unselfish virtue.</p>
  <p align="left">Perhaps  they felt this, too. Perhaps even these hardened men and the more than hardened  woman whose presence was in itself a blight, recognized heroism when they saw  it; for when the lawyer, with a certain obvious reluctance, laid his hand on  the bolts of the door with the remark: &ldquo;This is not my work, you know; I am but  following out instructions very minutely given me,&rdquo; the smothered growls and  grunts which rose in reply lacked the venom which had been infused into all their  previous comments.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think our friends out there are far enough withdrawn, by this time, for us to  hazard the opening of the door,&rdquo; the lawyer now remarked. &ldquo;Madam, I hope you  will speedily find your way to some comfortable shelter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Then  the door opened, and after a moment, closed again in a silence which at least  was respectful. Yet I warrant there was not a soul remaining who had not  already figured in his mind to what extent his own fortune had been increased  by the failure of one of their number to inherit.</p>
  <p align="left">As  for me, my whole interest in the affair was at an end, and I was only anxious  to find my way to where this desolate woman faced the mist with her unfed baby  in her arms.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3"></a>Chapter 3</b><br>
      <b>A Life Drama</b></h2>
  <p align="left">But  to reach this wanderer, it was first necessary for me to escape from the house.  This proved simple enough. The up-stairs room toward which I rushed had a  window overlooking one of the many lean-tos already mentioned. This window was  fastened, but I had no difficulty in unlocking it or in finding my way to the  ground from the top of the lean-to. But once again on terra-firma, I discovered  that the mist was now so thick that it had all the effect of a fog at sea. It  was icy cold as well, and clung about me so that I presently began to shudder  most violently, and, strong man though I was, wish myself back in the little  attic bedroom from which I had climbed in search of one in more unhappy case  than myself.</p>
  <p align="left">But  these feelings did not cause me to return. If I found the night cold, she must  find it bitter. If desolation oppressed my naturally hopeful spirit, must it  not be more overwhelming yet to one whose memories were sad and whose future  was doubtful? And the child! What infant could live in an air like this! Edging  away from the house, I called out her name, but no answer came back. The  persons whom we had heard flitting in restless longing about the house a few  moments before had left in rage and she, possibly, with them. Yet I could not  imagine her joining herself to people of their stamp. There had been a  solitariness in her aspect which seemed to forbid any such companionship.  Whatever her story, at least she had nothing in common with the two ill-favored  persons whose faces I had seen looking in at the casement. No; I should find  her alone, but where? Certainly the ring of mist, surrounding me at that  moment, offered me little prospect of finding her anywhere, either easily or  soon.</p>
  <p align="left">Again  I raised my voice, and again I failed to meet with response. Then, fearing to  leave the house lest I should be quite lost amid the fences and brush lying  between it and the road, I began to feel my way along the walls, calling softly  now, instead of loudly, so anxious was I not to miss any chance of carrying  comfort, if not succor, to the woman I was seeking. But the night gave back no  sound, and when I came to the open door of a shed, I welcomed the refuge it  offered and stepped in. I was, of course, confronted by darkness,&mdash;a different  darkness from that without, blanket-like and impenetrable. But when after a  moment of intense listening I heard a soft sound as of weariful breathing, I  was seized anew by hope, and, feeling in my pocket for my match-box, I made a  light and looked around.</p>
  <p align="left">My  intuitions had not deceived me; she was there. Sitting on the floor with her  cheek pressed against the wall, she revealed to my eager scrutiny only the  outlines of her pure, pale profile; but in those outlines and on those pure,  pale features, I saw such an abandonment of hope, mingled with such quiet  endurance, that my whole soul melted before it, and it was with difficulty I  managed to say:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pardon!  I do not wish to intrude; but I am shut out of the house also; and the night is  raw and cold. Can I do nothing for your comfort or for&mdash;for the child&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She  turned toward me and I saw a tremulous gleam of pleasure disturb the somber  stillness of her face; then the match went out in my hand, and we were again in  complete darkness. But the little wail, which at the same instant rose from  between her arms, filled up the pause, as her sweet &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; filled my heart.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am used to the cold,&rdquo; came in another moment from the place where she crouched.  &ldquo;It is the child&mdash;she is hungry; and I&mdash;I walked here&mdash;feeling, hoping that, as my  father&rsquo;s heir, I might partake in some slight measure of Uncle Anthony&rsquo;s money.  Though my father cast me out before he died, and I have neither home nor money,  I do not complain. I forfeited all when&mdash;&rdquo; another wail, another gentle &ldquo;hush!&rdquo;&mdash;then  silence.</p>
  <p align="left">I  lit another match. &ldquo;Look in my face!&rdquo; I prayed. &ldquo;I am a stranger, and you would  be showing only proper prudence not to trust me. But I overheard your words  when you withdrew from the room where your fortune lay; and I honor you, madam.  If food can be got for your little one, I will get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  caught sight of the convulsive clasp with which she drew to her breast the tiny  bundle she held, then darkness fell again.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  little bread,&rdquo; she entreated; &ldquo;a little milk&mdash;ah, baby, baby, hush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  where can I get it?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;They are at table inside. I hear them shouting  over their good cheer. But perhaps there are neighbors near by; do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  are no neighbors,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;What is got must be got here. I know a way to  the kitchen; I used to visit Uncle Anthony when a little child; if you have the  courage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  laughed. This token of confidence seemed to reassure her. I heard her move;  possibly she stood up.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  the further corner of this shed,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;there used to be a trap,  connecting this floor with an underground passage-way. A ladder stood against  the trap, and the small cellar at the foot communicated by means of an  iron-bound door with the large one under the house. Eighteen years ago the wood  of that door was old; now it should be rotten. If you have the strength&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  will make the effort and see,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But when I am in the cellar, what then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Follow  the wall to the right; you will come to a stone staircase. As this staircase  has no railing, be careful in ascending it. At the top you will find a door; it  leads into a pantry adjoining the kitchen. Some one will be in that pantry.  Some one will give you a bite for the child; and when she is quieted and the  sun has risen, I will go away. It is my duty to do so. My uncle was always  upright, if cold. He was perfectly justified in exacting rectitude in his  heirs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  might have rejoined by asking if she detected rectitude in the faces of the  greedy throng she had left behind her with the guardian of this estate; but I  did not. I was too intent upon following out her directions. Lighting another  match, I sought the trap. Alas! it was burdened with a pile of sticks and  rubbish which looked as if they had lain there for years. As these had to be  removed in total darkness, it took me some time. But once this debris had been  scattered and thrown aside, I had no difficulty in finding the trap and, as the  ladder was still there, I was soon on the cellar-bottom. When, by the  reassuring shout I gave, she knew that I had advanced thus far, she spoke, and  her voice had a soft and thrilling sound.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  not forget your own needs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We two are not so hungry that we can not  wait for you to take a mouthful. I will sing to the baby. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">These  ten minutes we had spent together had made us friends. The warmth, the strength  which this discovery brought, gave to my arm a force that made that old oak  door go down before me in three vigorous pushes.</p>
  <p align="left">Had  the eight fortunate ones above not been indulging in a noisy celebration of  their good luck, they must have heard the clatter of this door when it fell.  But good eating, good drink, and the prospect of an immediate fortune far  beyond their wildest dreams, made all ears deaf; and no pause occurred in the  shouts of laughter and the hum of good-fellowship which sifted down between the  beams supporting the house above my head. Consequently little or no courage was  required for the completion of my adventure; and before long I came upon the  staircase and the door leading from its top into the pantry. The next minute I  was in front of that door.</p>
  <p align="left">But  here a surprise awaited me. The noise which had hitherto been loud now became  deafening, and I realized that, contrary to Eunice Westonhaugh&rsquo;s expectation,  the supper had been spread in the kitchen and that I was likely to run amuck of  the whole despicable crowd in any effort I might make to get a bite for the  famished baby.</p>
  <p align="left">I  therefore naturally hesitated to push open the door, fearing to draw attention  to myself; and when I did succeed in lifting the latch and making a small  crack, I was so astonished by the sudden lull in the general babble, that I  drew hastily back and was for descending the stairs in sudden retreat.</p>
  <p align="left">But  I was prevented from carrying out this cowardly impulse, by catching the sound  of the lawyer&rsquo;s voice, addressing the assembled guests.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have eaten and you have drunk,&rdquo; he was saying; &ldquo;you are therefore ready for the  final toast. Brothers, nephews&mdash;heirs all of Anthony Westonhaugh, I rise to  propose the name of your generous benefactor, who, if spirits walk this earth,  must certainly be with us to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  grumble from more than one throat and an uneasy hitch from such shoulders as I  could see through my narrow vantage-hole testified to the rather doubtful  pleasure with which this suggestion was received. But the lawyer&rsquo;s tones lost  none of their animation as he went on to say:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  bottle, from which your glasses are to be replenished for this final draft, he  has himself provided. So anxious was he that it should be of the very best and  altogether worthy of the occasion it is to celebrate, that he gave into my  charge, almost with his dying breath, this key, telling me that it would unlock  a cupboard here in which he had placed a bottle of wine of the very rarest  vintage. This is the key, and yonder, if I do not mistake, is the cupboard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They  had already quaffed a dozen toasts. Perhaps this was why they accepted this  proposition in a sort of panting silence, which remained unbroken while the  lawyer crossed the floor, unlocked the cupboard and brought out before them a  bottle which he held up before their eyes with a simulated glee almost  saturnine.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  that a bottle to make your eyes dance? The very cobwebs on it are eloquent. And  see! look at this label. Tokay, friends, real Tokay! How many of you ever had  the opportunity of drinking real Tokay before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  long deep sigh from a half-dozen throats in which some strong but hitherto  repressed passion, totally incomprehensible to me, found sudden vent, rose in  one simultaneous sound from about that table, and I heard one jocular voice  sing out:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pass  it around, Smead. I&rsquo;ll drink to Uncle Anthony out of that bottle till there isn&rsquo;t  a drop left to tell what was in it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But  the lawyer was in no hurry.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have forgotten the letter, for the hearing of which you are called together.  Mr. Anthony Westonhaugh left behind him a letter. The time is now come for  reading it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As  I heard these words and realized that the final toast was to be delayed and  that some few moments must yet elapse before the room would be cleared and an  opportunity given me for obtaining what I needed for the famishing mother and  child, I felt such impatience with the fact and so much anxiety as to the  condition of those I had left behind me that I questioned whether it would not  be better for me to return to them empty-handed than to leave them so long  without the comfort of my presence, when the fascination of the scene again  seized me and I found myself lingering to mark its conclusion with an avidity  which can only be explained by my sudden and intense consciousness of what it  all might mean to her whose witness I had thus inadvertently become.</p>
  <p align="left">The  careful lawyer began by quoting the injunction with which this letter had been  put in his hands. &ldquo;&lsquo;When they are warm with food and wine, but not too warm,&rsquo;&mdash;thus  his adjuration ran, &lsquo;then let them hear my first and only words to them.&rsquo; I  know you are eager for these words. Folk so honest, so convinced of their own  purity and uprightness that they can stand unmoved while the youngest and most  helpless among them withdraws her claim to wealth and independence rather than  share an unmerited bounty, such folk, I say, must be eager, must be anxious to  know why they have been made the legatees of so great a fortune, under the easy  conditions and amid such slight restrictions as have been imposed upon them by  their munificent kinsman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  had rather go on drinking toasts,&rdquo; babbled one thick voice.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  had rather finish my figuring,&rdquo; growled another, in whose grating tones no echo  remained of Hector Westonhaugh&rsquo;s formerly honeyed voice. &ldquo;I am making out a  list of stock&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Blast  your stock! that is, if you mean horses and cows!&rdquo; screamed a third. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going  in for city life. With less money than we have got, Andreas Amsberger got to be  alderman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Alderman!&rdquo;  sneered the whole pack; and the tumult became general. &ldquo;If more of us had been  sick,&rdquo; called out one; &ldquo;or if Uncle Luke, say, had tripped into the ditch  instead of on the edge of it, the fellows who came safe through might have had  anything they wanted, even to the governorship of the state or&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;  came in commanding tones from the lawyer, who had begun to let his disgust  appear, perhaps because he held under his thumb the bottle upon which all eyes  were now lovingly centered; so lovingly, indeed, that I ventured to increase,  in the smallest perceptible degree, the crack by means of which I was myself an  interested, if unseen, participator in this scene.</p>
  <p align="left">A  sight of Smead, and a partial glimpse of old Luke&rsquo;s covetous profile, rewarded  this small act of daring on my part. The lawyer was standing; all the rest were  sitting. Perhaps he alone retained sufficient steadiness to stand; for I  observed by the control he exercised over this herd of self-seekers, that he  alone had not touched the cup which had so freely gone about among the others.  The woman was hidden from me, but the change in her voice, when by any chance I  heard it, convinced me that she had not disdained the toasts drunk by her  brothers and nephews.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;  the lawyer reiterated, &ldquo;or I will smash this bottle on the hearth.&rdquo; He raised  it in one threatening hand and every man there seemed to tremble, while old  Luke put out his long fingers with an entreaty that ill became them. &ldquo;You want  to hear the letter?&rdquo; old Smead called out. &ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Putting  the bottle down again, but still keeping one hand upon it, he drew a folded  paper from his breast. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;contains the final injunctions of  Anthony Westonhaugh. You will listen, all of you; listen till I am done; or I  will not only smash this bottle before your eyes, but I will keep for ever  buried in my breast the whereabouts of certain drafts and bonds in which, as  his heirs, you possess the greatest interest. Nobody but myself knows where  these papers can be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Whether  this was so, or whether the threat was an empty one thrown out by this subtile  old schemer for the purpose of safeguarding his life from their possible hate  and impatience, it answered his end with these semi-intoxicated men, and  secured him the silence he demanded. Breaking open the seal of the envelope he  held, he showed them the folded sheet which it contained, with the remark:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have had nothing to do with the writing of this letter. It is in Mr.  Westonhaugh&rsquo;s own hand, and he was not even so good as to communicate to me the  nature of its contents. I was bidden to read it to such as should be here  assembled under the provisos mentioned in his will; and as you are now in a  condition to listen, I will proceed with my task as required.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This  was my time for leaving, but a certain brooding terror, latent in the air, held  me chained to the spot, listening with my ears, but receiving the full sense of  what was read from the expression of old Luke&rsquo;s face, which was probably more  plainly visible to me than to those who sat beside him. For, being bent almost  into a bow, as I have said, his forehead came within an inch of touching his  plate, and one had to look under his arms, as I did, to catch the workings of  his evil mouth, as old Smead gave forth, in his professional sing-song, the  following words from his departed client:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Brothers,  nephews and heirs! Though the earth has lain upon my breast a month, I am with  you here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  snort from old Luke&rsquo;s snarling lips; and a stir&mdash;not a comfortable one&mdash;in the  jostling crowd, whose shaking arms and clawing hands I could see projecting  here and there over the board.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  presence at this feast&mdash;a presence which, if unseen, can not be unfelt, may  bring you more pain than pleasure. But if so, it matters little. You are my  natural heirs and I have left you my money; why, when so little love has characterized  our intercourse, must be evident to such of my brothers as can recall their  youth and the promise our father exacted from us on the day we set foot in this  new land.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  were nine of us in those days: Luke, Salmon, Barbara, Hector, Eustace, Janet,  Hudson, William and myself; and all save one were promising, in appearance at  least. But our father knew his offspring, and when we stood, an alien and  miserable band in front of Castle Garden, at the foot of the great city whose  immensity struck terror to our hearts, he drew all our hands together and made  us swear by the soul of our mother, whose body we had left in the sea, that we  would keep the bond of brotherhood intact, and share with mutual confidence  whatever good fortune this untried country might hold in store for us. You were  strong and your voices rang out loudly. Mine was faint, for I was weak&mdash;so weak  that my hand had to be held in place by my sister Barbara. But my oath has  never lost its hold upon my heart, while yours&mdash;answer how you have kept it,  Luke; or you, Janet; or you Hector, of the smooth tongue and vicious heart; or  you, or you, who, from one stock, recognize but one law: the law of  cold-blooded selfishness which seeks its own in face of all oaths and at the  cost of another man&rsquo;s heart-break.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This  I say to such as know my story. But lest there be one amongst you who has not  heard from parent or uncle the true tale of him who has brought you all under  one roof to-night, I will repeat it here in words, that no man may fail to  understand why I remembered my oath through life and beyond death, yet stand  above you an accusing spirit while you quaff me toasts and count the gains my  justice divides among you.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I,  as you all remember, was the weak one&mdash;the ne&rsquo;er-do-weel. When all of you were  grown and had homes of your own, I still remained under the family roof-tree,  fed by our father&rsquo;s bounty and looking to our father&rsquo;s justice for that share  of his savings which he had promised to all alike. When he died it came to me  as it came to you; but I had married before that day; married, not, like the  rest of you, for what a wife could bring, but for sentiment and true passion.  This, in my case, meant a loving wife, but a frail one; and while we lived a  little while on the patrimony left us, it was far too small to support us long  without some aid from our own hands; and our hands were feeble and could not  work. And so we fell into debt for rent and, ere long, for the commonest  necessities of life. In vain I struggled to redeem myself; the time of my  prosperity had not come and I only sank deeper and deeper into debt and finally  into indigence. A baby came. Our landlord was kind and allowed us to stay for  two weeks under the roof for whose protection we could not pay; but at the end  of that time we were asked to leave; and I found myself on the road with a  dying wife, a wailing infant, no money in my purse and no power in my arm to  earn any. Then when heart and hope were both failing, I recalled that ancient  oath and the six prosperous homes scattered up and down the very highway on  which I stood. I could not leave my wife; the fever was in her veins and she  could not bear me out of her sight; so I put her on a horse, which a kind old  neighbor was willing to lend me, and holding her up with one hand, guided the  horse with the other, to the home of my brother Luke. He was a straight enough  fellow in those days&mdash;physically, I mean&mdash;and he looked able and strong that  morning, as he stood in the open doorway of his house, gazing down at us as we  halted before him in the roadway. But his temper had grown greedy with the  accumulation of a few dollars, and he shook his head as he closed his door,  saying he remembered no oath and that spenders must expect to be beggars.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Struck  to the heart by a rebuff which meant prolongation of the suffering I saw in my  dear wife&rsquo;s eyes, I stretched up and kissed her where she sat half-fainting on  the horse; then I moved on. I came to Barbara&rsquo;s home next. She had been a  little mother to me once; that is, she had fed and dressed me, and doled out  blows and caresses, and taught me to read and sing. But Barbara in her father&rsquo;s  home and without fortune was not the Barbara I saw on the threshold of the  little cottage she called her own. She heard my story; looked in the face of my  wife and turned her back. She had no place for idle folk in her little house;  if we would work she would feed us; but we must earn our supper or go hungry to  bed. I felt the trembling of my wife&rsquo;s frame where she leaned against my arm,  and kissing her again, led her on to Salmon&rsquo;s. Luke, Hector, Janet, have you  heard him tell of that vision at his gateway, twenty-five years ago? He is not  amongst you. For twelve years he has lain beside our father in the churchyard,  but his sons may be here, for they were ever alert when gold was in sight or a  full glass to be drained. Ask them, ask John, whom I saw skulking behind his cousins at  the garden fence that day, what it was they saw as I drew rein under the great  tree which shadowed their father&rsquo;s doorstep.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  sunshine had been pitiless that morning, and the head, for whose rest in some  loving shelter I would have bartered soul and body, had fallen sidewise till it  lay on my arm. Pressed to her breast was our infant, whose little wail struck  in pitifully as Salmon called out: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s to do here to-day!&rsquo; Do you remember  it, lads? or how you all laughed, little and great, when I asked for a few  weeks&rsquo; stay under my brother&rsquo;s roof till we could all get well and go about our  tasks again? I  remember. I, who am writing these words from the very mouth of the tomb, I remember;  but I did not curse you. I only rode on to the next. The way ran uphill now;  and the sun which, since our last stop, had been under a cloud, came out and  blistered my wife&rsquo;s cheeks, already burning red with fever. But I pressed my  lips upon them, and led her on. With each rebuff I gave her a kiss; and her  smile, as her head pressed harder and harder upon my arm now exerting all its  strength to support her, grew almost divine. But it vanished at my nephew Lemuel&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  was shearing sheep, and could give no time to company; and when, late in the  day, I drew rein at Janet&rsquo;s, and she said she was going to have a dance and  could not look after sick folk, the pallid lips failed to return my despairing  embrace; and in the terror which this brought me I went down, in the gathering  twilight, into the deep valley where William raised his sheep and reckoned, day  by day, the increase among his pigs. Oh, the chill of that descent! Oh, the  gloom of the gathering shadows! As we neared the bottom and I heard a far-off  voice shout out a hoarse command, some instinct made me reach up for the last  time and bestow that faithful kiss, which was at once her consolation and my  prayer. My lips were cold with the terror of my soul, but they were not so cold  as the cheek they touched, and, shrieking in my misery and need, I fell before  William where he halted by the horse-trough and&mdash;He was always a hard man, was  William, and it was a shock to him, no doubt, to see us standing in our anguish  and necessity before him; but he raised the whip in his hand and, when it fell,  my arm fell with it and she slipped from my grasp to the ground, and lay in a  heap in the roadway.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  was ashamed next minute and pointed to the house near-by. But I did not carry  her in, and she died in the roadway. Do you remember it, Luke? Do you remember  it, Lemuel?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  it is not of this I complain at this hour, nor is it for this I ask you to  drink the toast I have prepared for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  looks, the writhings of old Luke and such others as I could now see through the  widening crack my hands unconsciously made in the doorway, told me that the  rack was at work in this room so lately given up to revelry. Yet the  mutterings, which from time to time came to my ears from one sullen lip or  another, did not rise into frightened imprecation or even into any assertion of  sorrow or contrition. It seemed as if some suspense, common to all, held them  speechless if not dumbly apprehensive; and while the lawyer said nothing in recognition  of this, he could not have been quite blind to it, for he bestowed one curious  glance around the table before he proceeded with old Anthony&rsquo;s words.</p>
  <p align="left">Those  words had now become short, sharp, and accusatory.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  child lived; and what remained to me of human passion and longing centered in  his frail existence. I managed to earn enough for his eating and housing, and  in time I was almost happy again. This was while our existence was a struggle;  but when, with the discovery of latent powers in my own mind, I began to find  my place in the world and to earn money, then your sudden interest in my boy  taught me a new lesson in human selfishness; but not, as yet, new fears. My  nature was not one to grasp ideas of evil, and the remembrance of that oath  still remained to make me lenient toward you.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  let him see you; not much, not often, but yet often enough for him to realize  that he had uncles and cousins, or, if you like it better, kindred. And how did  you repay this confidence on my part? What hand had ye in the removal of this  small barrier to the fortune my own poor health warranted you in looking upon,  even in those early days, as your own? To others&rsquo; eyes it may appear, none; to  mine, ye are one and all his murderers, as certainly as all of you were the murderers  of the good physician hastening to his aid. For his illness was not a mortal  one. He would have been saved if the doctor had reached him; but a precipice  swallowed that good Samaritan, and only I, of all who looked upon the  footprints which harrowed up the road at this dangerous point, knew whose shoes  would fit those marks. God&rsquo;s providence, it was called, and I let it pass for  such; but it was a providence which cost me my boy and made you my heirs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Silence  as sullen in character as the men who found themselves thus openly impeached  had, for some minutes now, replaced the muttered complaints which had  accompanied the first portion of this denunciatory letter. As the lawyer  stopped to cast them another of those strange looks, a gleam from old Luke&rsquo;s  sidewise eyes startled the man next him, who, shrugging a shoulder, passed the  underhanded look on, till it had circled the board and stopped with the man  sitting opposite the crooked sinner who had started it.</p>
  <p align="left">I  began to have a wholesome dread of them all and was astonished to see the  lawyer drop his hand from the bottle, which to some degree offered itself as a  possible weapon. But he knew his audience better than I did. Though the bottle  was now free for any man&rsquo;s taking, not a hand trembled toward it, nor was a  single glass held out.</p>
  <p align="left">The  lawyer, with an evil smile, went on with his relentless client&rsquo;s story.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ye  had killed my wife; ye had killed my son; but this was not enough. Being  lonesome in my great house, which was as much too large for me as my fortune  was, I had taken a child to replace the boy I had lost. Remembering the cold  blood running in the veins of those nearest me, I chose a boy from alien stock  and, for a while, knew contentment again. But, as he developed and my  affections strengthened, the possibility of all my money going his way roused  my brothers and sisters from the complacency they had enjoyed since their road  to fortune had been secured by my son&rsquo;s death, and one day&mdash;can you recall it,  Hudson? can you recall it, Lemuel?&mdash;the boy was brought in from the mill and  laid at my feet, dead! He had stumbled amongst the great belts, but whose was  the voice which had startled him with a sudden &lsquo;Halloo!&rsquo; Can you say, Luke? Can  you say, John? I can say in whose ear it was whispered that three, if not more  of you, were seen moving among the machinery that fatal morning.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Again,  God&rsquo;s providence was said to have visited my house; and again ye were my  heirs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stop  there!&rdquo; broke in the harsh voice of Luke, who was gradually growing livid under  his long gray locks.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lies!  lies!&rdquo; shrieked Hector, gathering courage from his brother.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Cut  it all and give us the drink!&rdquo; snarled one of the younger men, who was less  under the effect of liquor than the rest.</p>
  <p align="left">But  a trembling voice muttered &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; and the lawyer, whose eye had grown steely  under these comments, took advantage of the sudden silence which had followed  this last objurgation and went steadily on.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Some  men would have made a will and denounced you. I made a will, but did not  denounce you. I  am no breaker of oaths. More than this, I learned a new trick. I, who hated all  subtlety and looked upon craft as the favorite weapon of the devil, learned to  smile with my lips while my heart was burning with hatred. Perhaps this was why  you all began to smile too, and joke me about certain losses I had sustained,  by which you meant the gains which had come to me. That these gains were many  times greater than you realized added to the sting of this good fellowship, but  I held my peace; and you began to have confidence in a good-nature which  nothing could shake. You even gave me a supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  supper!</p>
  <p align="left">What  was there in these words to cause every man there to stop in whatever movement  he was making and stare, with wide-open eyes, intently at the reader. He had  spoken quietly; he had not even looked up, but the silence which, for some  minutes back, had begun to reign over that tumultuous gathering, now became  breathless, and the seams in Hector&rsquo;s cheeks deepened to a bluish criss-cross.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You remember  that supper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As  the words rang out again, I threw wide the door; I might have stalked openly  into their circle; not a man there would have noticed me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  was a memorable occasion,&rdquo; the lawyer read on with stoical impassiveness. &ldquo;There  was not a brother lacking. Luke and Hudson and William and Hector and Eustace&rsquo;s  boys, as well as Eustace himself; Janet too, and Salmon&rsquo;s Lemuel, and Barbara&rsquo;s  son, who, even if his mother had gone the way of all flesh, had so trained her  black brood in the love of the things of this world that I scarcely missed her  when I looked about among you all for the eight sturdy brothers and sisters who  had joined in one clasp and one oath, under the eye of the true-hearted  immigrant, our father. What I did miss was one true eye lifted to my glance; but  I did not show that I missed it; and so our peace was made and we separated,  you to wait for your inheritance, and I for the death which was to secure it to  you. For, when the cup passed round that night, you each dropped into it a tear  of repentance, and tears make bitter drinking. I sickened as I quaffed and was  never myself again, as you know. Do you understand me, you cruel, crafty ones?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Did  they not! Heads quaking, throats gasping, teeth chattering&mdash;no longer  sitting&mdash;all risen, all looking with wild eyes for the door&mdash;was it not apparent  that they understood and only waited for one more word to break away and flee  the accursed house?</p>
  <p align="left">But  that word lingered. Old Smead had now grown pale himself and read with  difficulty the lines which were to end this frightful scene. As I saw the red  gleam of terror shine out from his small eyes, I wondered if he had been but  the blind tool of his implacable client and was as ignorant as those before him  of what was to follow this heavy arraignment. The dread with which he finally  proceeded was too marked for me to doubt the truth of this surmise. This is  what he found himself forced to read:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  was a bottle reserved for me. It had a green label on it,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  shriek from every one there and a hurried look up and down at the bottles  standing on the table.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  green label,&rdquo; the lawyer repeated, &ldquo;and it made a goodly appearance as it was  set down before me. But you had no liking for wine with a green label on the  bottle. One by one you refused it, and when I rose to quaff my final glass  alone, every eye before me fell and did not lift again until the glass was  drained. I did not notice this then, but I see it all now, just as I hear again  the excuses you gave for not filling your glasses as the bottle went round. One  had drunk enough; one suffered from qualms brought on by an unaccustomed  indulgence in oysters; one felt that wine good enough for me was too good for  him, and so on and so on. Not one to show frank eyes and drink with me as I was  ready to drink with him! Why? Because one and all of you knew what was in that  cup, and would not risk an inheritance so nearly within your grasp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lies!  lies!&rdquo; again shrieked the raucous voice of Luke, smothered by terror; while  oaths, shouts, imprecations, rang out in horrid tumult from one end of the  table to the other, till the lawyer&rsquo;s face, over which a startling change was  rapidly passing, drew the whole crowd forward again in awful fascination, till  they clung, speechless, arm in arm, shoulder propping shoulder, while he gasped  out in dismay equal to their own, these last fatal words:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  was at your board, my brothers; now you are at mine. You have eaten my viands,  drunk of my cup; and now, through the mouth of the one man who has been true to  me because therein lies his advantage, I offer you a final glass. Will you  drink it? I drank yours. By that old-time oath which binds us to share each  other&rsquo;s fortune, I ask you to share this cup with me. You will not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  no, no!&rdquo; shouted one after another.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  the inexorable voice went on, a voice which to these miserable souls was no  longer that of the lawyer, but an issue from the grave they had themselves dug  for Anthony Westonhaugh, &ldquo;know that your abstinence comes too late; that you  have already drunk the toast destined to end your lives. The bottle which you  must have missed from that board of yours has been offered you again. A label  is easily changed and&mdash;Luke, John, Hector, I know you all so well&mdash;that bottle  has been greedily emptied by you; and while I, who sipped sparingly, lived  three weeks, you, who have drunk deep, have not three hours before you, possibly  not three minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">O,  the wail of those lost souls as this last sentence issued in a final pant of  horror from the lawyer&rsquo;s quaking lips! Shrieks&mdash;howls&mdash;prayers for mercy&mdash;groans  to make the hair rise&mdash;and curses, at sound of which I shut my ears in horror,  only to open them again in dread as, with one simultaneous impulse, they flung  themselves upon the lawyer who, foreseeing this rush, had backed up against the  wall.</p>
  <p align="left">He  tried to stem the tide.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  knew nothing of the poisoning,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;That was not my reason for  declining the drink. I wished to preserve my senses&mdash;to carry out my client&rsquo;s  wishes. As God lives, I did not know he meant to carry his revenge so far. Mercy!  Mer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But  the hands which clutched him were the hands of murderers, and the lawyer&rsquo;s puny  figure could not stand up against the avalanche of human terror, relentless  fury and mad vengeance which now rolled in upon it. As I bounded to his relief  he turned his ghastly face upon me. But the way between us was blocked, and I  was preparing myself to see him sink before my eyes, when an unearthly shriek  rose from behind us, and every living soul in that mass of struggling humanity  paused, set and staring, with stiffened limbs and eyes fixed, not on him, not  on me, but on one of their own number, the only woman amongst them, Janet  Clapsaddle, who, with clutching hands clawing her breast, was reeling in  solitary agony in her place beside the board. As they looked she fell, and lay  with upturned face and staring eyes, in whose glassy depths the ill-fated ones  who watched her could see mirrored their own impending doom.</p>
  <p align="left">It  was an awful moment. A groan, in which was concentrated the despair of seven  miserable souls, rose from that petrified band; then, man by man, they  separated and fell back, showing on each weak or wicked face the particular  passion which had driven them into crime and made them the victims of this  wholesale revenge. There had been some sort of bond between them till the  vision of death rose before each shrinking soul. Shoulder to shoulder in crime,  they fell apart as their doom approached; and rushing, shrieking, each man for  himself, they one and all sought to escape by doors, windows or any outlet  which promised release from this fatal spot. One rushed by me&mdash;I do not know  which one&mdash;and I felt as if a flame from hell had licked me, his breath was so  hot and the moans he uttered so like the curses we imagine to blister the lips  of the lost. None of them saw me; they did not even detect the sliding form of  the lawyer crawling away before them to some place of egress of which they had  no knowledge; and, convinced that in this scene of death I could play no part  worthy of her who awaited me, I too rushed away and, groping my way back  through the cellar, sought the side of her who still crouched in patient  waiting against the dismal wall.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter 4</b><br>
      <b>The Final Shock</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Her  baby had fallen asleep. I knew this by the faint, low sweetness of her croon;  and, shuddering with the horrors I had witnessed, horrors which acquired a  double force from the contrast presented by the peace of this quiet spot and  the hallowing influence of the sleeping infant,&mdash;I threw myself down in the  darkness at her feet, gasping out:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  thank God and your uncle&rsquo;s seeming harshness, that you have escaped the doom  which has overtaken those others! You and your babe are still alive; while  they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  of them? What has happened to them? You are breathless, trembling; you have  brought no bread&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  no. Food in this house means death. Your relatives gave food and wine to your  uncle at a supper; he, though now in his grave, has returned the same to them.  There was a bottle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  stopped, appalled. A shriek, muffled by distance but quivering with the same  note of death I had heard before, had gone up again from the other side of the  wall against which we were leaning.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  she gasped; &ldquo;and my father was at that supper! my father, who died last night  cursing the day he was born! We are an accursed race. I have known it all my  life; perhaps that was why I mistook passion for love; and my baby&mdash;O God, have  mercy! God have mercy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  plaintiveness of that cry, the awesomeness of what I had seen&mdash;of what was going  on at that moment almost within the reach of our arms&mdash;the darkness, the  desolation of our two souls, affected me as I had never been affected in my  whole life before. In the concentrated experience of the last two hours I  seemed to live years under this woman&rsquo;s eyes; to know her as I did my own  heart; to love her as I did my own soul. No growth of feeling ever brought the  ecstasy of that moment&rsquo;s inspiration. With no sense of doing anything strange,  with no fear of being misunderstood, I reached out my hand and, touching hers  where it lay clasped about her infant, I said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  are two poor wayfarers. A rough road loses half its difficulties when trodden  by two. Shall we, then, fare on together&mdash;we and the little child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She  gave a sob; there was sorrow, longing, grief, hope, in its thrilling low sound.  As I recognized the latter emotion I drew her to my breast. The child did not  separate us.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  shall be happy,&rdquo; I murmured, and her sigh seemed to answer a delicious &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  when suddenly there came a shock to the partition against which we leaned and,  starting from my clasp, she cried:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Our  duty is in there. Shall we think of ourselves or even of each other while these  men, all relatives of mine, are dying on the other side of this wall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Seizing  my hand, she dragged me to the trap; but here I took the lead, and helped her  down the ladder. When I had her safely on the floor at the foot, she passed in  front of me again; but once up the steps and in front of the kitchen door, I  thrust her behind me, for one glance into the room beyond had convinced me it  was no place for her.</p>
  <p align="left">But  she would not be held back. She crowded forward beside me, and together we  looked upon the wreck within. It was a never-to-be-forgotten scene. The demon  that was in those men had driven them to demolish furniture, dishes, everything.  In one heap lay what, an hour before, had been an inviting board surrounded by  rollicking and greedy guests. But it was not upon this overthrow we stopped to  look. It was upon something that mingled with it, dominated it and made of this  chaos only a setting to awful death. Janet&rsquo;s face, in all its natural  hideousness and depravity, looked up from the floor beside this heap; and  farther on, the twisted figure of him they called Hector, with something more  than the seams of greedy longing round his wide, staring eyes and icy temples.  Two in this room! and on the threshold of the one beyond a moaning third, who  sank into eternal silence as we approached; and before the fireplace in the  great room, a horrible crescent that had once been aged Luke, upon whom we had  no sooner turned our backs than we caught glimpses here and there of other  prostrate forms which moved once under our eyes and then moved no more.</p>
  <p align="left">One  only still stood upright, and he was the man whose obtrusive figure and sordid  expression had so revolted me in the beginning. There was no color now in his  flabby and heavily fallen cheeks. The eyes, in whose false sheen I had seen so  much of evil, were glazed now, and his big and burly frame shook the door it  pressed against. He was staring at a small slip of paper he held, and, from his  anxious looks, appeared to miss something which neither of us had power to  supply. It was a spectacle to make devils rejoice, and mortals fly aghast. But  Eunice had a spirit like an angel and drawing near him, she said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  there anything I can do for you, Cousin John?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He  started, looked at her with the same blank gaze he had hitherto cast at the  wall; then some words formed on his working lips and we heard:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  can not reckon; I was never good at figures; but if Luke is gone, and William,  and Hector, and Barbara&rsquo;s boy, and Janet,&mdash;how much does that leave for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He  was answered almost the moment he spoke; but it was by other tongues and in  another world than this. As his body fell forward, I tore open the door before  which he had been standing, and, lifting the almost fainting Eunice in my arms,  I carried her out into the night. As I did so, I caught a final glimpse of the  pictured face I had found it so hard to understand a couple of hours before. I  understood it now.</p>
  <p align="left">A  surprise awaited us as we turned toward the gate. The mist had lifted and a  keen but not unpleasant wind was driving from the north. Borne on it, we heard  voices. The village had emptied itself, probably at the alarm given by the  lawyer, and it was these good men and women whose approach we heard. As we had  nothing to fear from them, we went forward to meet them. As we did so, three  crouching figures rose from some bushes we passed and ran scurrying before us  through the gateway. They were the late comers who had shown such despair at  being shut out from this fatal house, and who probably did not yet know the  doom they had escaped.</p>
  <p align="center">*  * * * * * *</p>
  <p align="left">There  were lanterns in the hands of some of the men who now approached. As we stopped  before them, these lanterns were held up, and by the light they gave we saw,  first, the lawyer&rsquo;s frightened face, then the visages of two men who seemed to  be persons of some authority.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  news?&rdquo; faltered the lawyer, seeing by our faces that we knew the worst.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bad,&rdquo;  I returned; &ldquo;the poison had lost none of its virulence by being mixed so long  with the wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  many?&rdquo; asked the man on his right anxiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Eight,&rdquo;  was my solemn reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  were but eight,&rdquo; faltered the lawyer; &ldquo;that means, then, all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All,&rdquo;  I repeated.</p>
  <p align="left">A  murmur of horror rose, swelled, then died out in tumult as the crowd swept on  past us.</p>
  <p align="left">For  a moment we stood watching these people; saw them pause before the door we had  left open behind us, then rush in, leaving a wail of terror on the shuddering  midnight air. When all was quiet again, Eunice laid her hand upon my arm.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where  shall we go?&rdquo; she asked despairingly. &ldquo;I do not know a house that will open to  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  answer to her question came from other lips than mine.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  do not know one that will not,&rdquo; spoke up a voice behind our backs. &ldquo;Your withdrawal  from the circle of heirs did not take from you your rightful claim to an  inheritance which, according to your uncle&rsquo;s will, could be forfeited only by a  failure to arrive at the place of distribution within the hour set by the  testator. As I see the matter now, this appeal to the honesty of the persons so  collected was a test by which my unhappy client strove to save from the general  fate such members of his miserable family as fully recognized their sin and were  truly repentant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It  was Lawyer Smead. He had lingered behind the others to tell her this. She was,  then, no outcast, but rich, very rich; how rich I dared not acknowledge to  myself, lest a remembrance of the man who was the last to perish in that house  of death should return to make this calculation hateful. It was a blow which  struck deep, deeper than any either of us had sustained that night. As we came  to realize it, I stepped slowly back, leaving her standing erect and tall in  the middle of the roadway, with her baby in her arms. But not for long; soon  she was close at my side murmuring softly:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Two  wayfarers still! Only, the road will be more difficult and the need of  companionship greater. Shall we fare on together, you, I&mdash;and the little one?&rdquo;</p>
  <h1 align="center"><b><a name="ruby"></a>The Ruby And The Caldron</b></h1>
  <p align="left">As  there were two good men on duty that night, I did not see why I should remain  at my desk, even though there was an unusual stir created in our small town by  the grand ball given at The Evergreens.</p>
  <p align="left">But  just as I was preparing to start for home, an imperative ring called me to the  telephone and I heard:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Halloo!  Is this the police-station?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  then, a detective is wanted at once at The Evergreens. He can not be too clever  or too discreet. A valuable jewel has been lost, which must be found before the  guests disperse for home. Large reward if the matter ends successfully and  without too great publicity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;May  I ask who is speaking to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs.  Ashley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It  was the mistress of The Evergreens and giver of the ball.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Madam,  a man shall be sent at once. Where will you see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  the butler&rsquo;s pantry at the rear. Let him give his name as Jennings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  good. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  pretty piece of work! Should I send Hendricks or should I send Hicks? Hendricks  was clever and Hicks discreet, but neither united both qualifications in the  measure demanded by the sensible and quietly-resolved woman with whom I had  just been talking. What alternative remained? But one; I must go myself.</p>
  <p align="left">It  was not late&mdash;not for a ball night, at least&mdash;and as half the town had been  invited to the dance, the streets were alive with carriages. I was watching the  blink of their lights through the fast falling snow when my attention was drawn  to a fact which struck me as peculiar. These carriages were all coming my way  instead of rolling in the direction of The Evergreens. Had they been empty this  would have needed no explanation, but, as far as I could see, most of them were  full, and that, too, with loudly talking women and gesticulating men.</p>
  <p align="left">Something  of a serious nature must have occurred at The Evergreens. Rapidly I paced on  and soon found myself before the great gates.</p>
  <p align="left">A  crowd of vehicles of all descriptions blocked the entrance. None seemed to be  passing up the driveway; all stood clustered at the gates, and as I drew nearer  I perceived many an anxious head thrust forth from their quickly opened doors  and heard many an ejaculation of disappointment as the short interchange of  words went on between the drivers of these various turnouts and a man drawn up  in quiet resolution before the unexpectedly barred entrance.</p>
  <p align="left">Slipping  round to this man&rsquo;s side, I listened to what he was saying. It was simple but  very explicit.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs.  Ashley asks everybody&rsquo;s pardon, but the ball can&rsquo;t go on to-night. Something  has happened which makes the reception of further guests impossible. To-morrow  evening she will be happy to see you all. The dance is simply postponed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This  he had probably repeated forty times, and each time it had probably been  received with the same mixture of doubt and curiosity which now held the  lengthy procession in check.</p>
  <p align="left">Not  wishing to attract attention, yet anxious to lose no time, I pressed up still  nearer, and, bending toward him from the shadow cast by a convenient post,  uttered the one word:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Jennings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Instantly  he unlocked a small gate at his right. I passed in and, with professional sang-froid,  proceeded to take my way to the house through the double row of evergreens  bordering the semicircular approach.</p>
  <p align="left">As  these trees stood very close together and were, besides, heavily laden with  fresh-fallen snow, I failed to catch a glimpse of the building itself until I  stood in front of it. Then I saw that it was brilliantly lighted and gave  evidence here and there of some festivity; but the guests were too few for the  effect to be very exhilarating and, passing around to the rear, I sought the  special entrance to which I had been directed.</p>
  <p align="left">A  heavy-browed porch, before which stood a caterer&rsquo;s wagon, led me to a door  which had every appearance of being the one I sought. Pushing it open, I  entered without ceremony, and speedily found myself in the midst of twenty or  more colored waiters and chattering housemaids. To one of the former I  addressed the question:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where  is the butler&rsquo;s pantry? I am told that I shall find the lady of the house  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your  name?&rdquo; was the curt demand.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Jennings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Follow  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  was taken through narrow passages and across one or two store-rooms to a small  but well-lighted closet, where I was left, with the assurance that Mrs. Ashley  would presently join me. I had never seen this lady, but I had often heard her  spoken of as a woman of superior character and admirable discretion.</p>
  <p align="left">She  did not keep me waiting. In two minutes the door opened and this fine,  well-poised woman was telling her story in the straightforward manner I so much  admire and so seldom meet with.</p>
  <p align="left">The  article lost was a large ruby of singular beauty and great value&mdash;the property  of Mrs. Burton, the senator&rsquo;s wife, in whose honor this ball was given. It had  not been lost in the house nor had it been originally missed that evening. Mrs.  Burton and herself had attended the great foot-ball game in the afternoon, and  it was on the college campus that Mrs. Burton had first dropped her invaluable  jewel. But a reward of five hundred dollars having been at once offered to  whoever should find and restore it, a great search had followed, which ended in  its being picked up by one of the students and brought back as far as the great  step leading up to the front door, when it had again disappeared, and in a way  to rouse conjecture of the strangest and most puzzling character.</p>
  <p align="left">The  young man who had brought it thus far bore the name of John Deane, and was a  member of the senior class. He had been the first to detect its sparkle in the  grass, and those who were near enough to see his face at that happy moment say  that it expressed the utmost satisfaction at his good luck.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ashley, &ldquo;he has a sweetheart, and five hundred dollars looks  like a fortune to a young man just starting life. But he was weak enough to  take this girl into his confidence; and on their way here&mdash;for both were invited  to the ball&mdash;he went so far as to pull it out of his pocket and show it to her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They  were admiring it together and vaunting its beauties to the young lady friend  who had accompanied them, when their carriage turned into the driveway and they  saw the lights of the house flashing before them. Hastily restoring the jewel  to the little bag he had made for it out of the finger-end of an old glove,&mdash;a bag  in which he assured me he had been careful to keep it safely tied ever since  picking it up on the college green,&mdash;he thrust it back into his pocket and  prepared to help the ladies out. But just then a disturbance arose in front. A  horse which had been driven up was rearing in a way that threatened to overturn  the light buggy to which he was attached. As the occupants of this buggy were  ladies, and seemed to have no control over the plunging beast, young Deane  naturally sprang to the rescue. Bidding his own ladies alight and make for the  porch, he hurriedly ran forward and, pausing in front of the maddened animal,  waited for an opportunity to seize him by the rein. He says that as he stood  there facing the beast with fixed eye and raised hand, he distinctly felt  something strike or touch his breast. But the sensation conveyed no meaning to  him in his excitement, and he did not think of it again till, the horse well in  hand and the two alarmed occupants of the buggy rescued, he turned to see where  his own ladies were, and beheld them looking down at him from the midst of a  circle of young people, drawn from the house by the screaming of the women.  Instantly a thought of the treasure he carried recurred to his mind, and  dropping the rein of the now quieted horse, he put his hand to his pocket. The  jewel was gone. He declares that for a moment he felt as if he had been struck  on the head by one of the hoofs of the frantic horse he had just handled. But  immediately the importance of his loss and the necessity he felt for instant  action restored him to himself, and shouting aloud, &lsquo;I have dropped Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s  ruby!&rsquo; begged every one to stand still while he made a search for it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This  all occurred, as you must know, more than an hour and a half ago, consequently  before many of my guests had arrived. My son, who was one of the few spectators  gathered on the porch, tells me that there was only one other carriage behind  the one in which Mr. Deane had brought his ladies. Both of these had stopped  short of the stepping-stone, and as the horse and buggy which had made all this  trouble had by this time been driven to the stable, nothing stood in the way of  his search but the rapidly accumulating snow which, if you remember, was  falling very thick and fast at the time.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  son, who had rushed in for his overcoat, came running down with offers to help  him. So did some others. But, with an imploring gesture, he begged to be  allowed to conduct the search alone, the ground being in such a state that the  delicately-mounted jewel ran great risk of being trodden into the snow and thus  injured or lost. They humored him for a moment, then, seeing that his efforts  bade fair to be fruitless, my son insisted upon joining him, and the two looked  the ground over, inch by inch, from the place where Mr. Deane had set foot to  ground in alighting from his carriage to the exact spot where he had stood when  he had finally seized hold of the horse. But no ruby. Then Harrison (that is my  son&rsquo;s name) sent for a broom and went over the place again, sweeping aside the  surface snow and examining carefully the ground beneath,&mdash;but with no better  results than before. No ruby could be found. My son came to me panting. Mrs.  Burton and myself stood awaiting him in a state of suspense. Guests and f&ecirc;te  were alike forgotten. We had heard that the jewel had been found on the campus  by one of the students and had been brought back as far as the step in front  and then lost again in some unaccountable manner in the snow, and we hoped, nay  expected from moment to moment, that it would be brought in.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When  Harrison entered, then, pale, disheveled and shaking his head, Mrs. Burton  caught me by the hand, and I thought she would faint. For this jewel is of far  greater value to her than its mere worth in money, though that is by no means  small.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is a family jewel and was given to her by her husband under special  circumstances. He prizes it even more than she does, and he is not here to  counsel or assist her in this extremity. Besides, she was wearing it in direct  opposition to his expressed wishes. This I must tell you, to show how  imperative it is for us to recover it; also to account for the large reward she  is willing to pay. When he last looked at it he noticed that the fastening was  a trifle slack and, though he handed the trinket back, he told her distinctly  that she was not to wear it till it had been either to Tiffany&rsquo;s or Starr&rsquo;s.  But she considered it safe enough, and put it on to please the boys, and lost  it. Senator Burton is a hard man and,&mdash;in short, the jewel must be found. I give  you just one hour in which to do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But,  madam&mdash;&rdquo; I protested.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; she put in, with a quick nod and a glance over her shoulder to see if  the door was shut. &ldquo;I have not finished my story. Hearing what Harrison had to  say, I took action at once. I bade him call in the guests, whom curiosity or  interest still detained on the porch, and seat them in a certain room which I  designated to him. Then, after telling him to send two men to the gates with  orders to hold back all further carriages from entering, and two others to  shovel up and cart away to the stable every particle of snow for ten feet each  side of the front step, I asked to see Mr. Deane. But here my son whispered  something into my ear, which it is my duty to repeat. It was to the effect that  Mr. Deane believed that the jewel had been taken from him; that he insisted, in  fact, that he had felt a hand touch his breast while he stood awaiting an  opportunity to seize the horse. &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll remember that, too;  but first see that my orders are carried out and that all approaches to the  grounds are guarded and no one allowed to come in or go out without permission  from me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  left us, and I was turning to encourage Mrs. Burton when my attention was  caught by the eager face of a little friend of mine, who, quite unknown to me,  was sitting in one of the corners of the room. She was studying my countenance  in a sort of subdued anxiety, hardly natural in one so young, and I was about  to call her to my side and question her when she made a sudden dive and  vanished from the room. Some impulse made me follow her. She is a conscientious  little thing, but timid as a hare, and though I saw she had something to say,  it was with difficulty I could make her speak. Only after the most solemn  assurances that her name should not be mentioned in the matter, would she give  me the following bit of information, which you may possibly think throws  another light upon the affair. It seems that she was looking out of one of the  front windows when Mr. Deane&rsquo;s carriage drove up. She had been watching the  antics of the horse attached to the buggy, but as soon as she saw Mr. Deane  going to the assistance of those in danger, she let her eyes stray back to the  ladies whom he had left behind him in the carriage.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  did not know these ladies, but their looks and gestures interested her, and she  watched them quite intently as they leaped to the ground and made their way  toward the porch. One went on quickly, and without pause, to the step, but the  other,&mdash;the one who came last,&mdash;did not do this. She stopped a moment, perhaps to  watch the horse in front, perhaps to draw her cloak more closely about her, and  when she again moved on, it was with a start and a hurried glance at her feet,  terminating in a quick turn and a sudden stooping to the ground. When she again  stood upright, she had something in her hand which she thrust furtively into  her breast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  was this lady dressed?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  a white cloak, with an edging of fur. I took pains to learn that, too, and it  was with some curiosity, I assure you, that I examined the few guests who had  now been admitted to the room I had so carefully pointed out to my son. Two of  them wore white cloaks, but one of these was Mrs. Dalrymple, and I did not give  her or her cloak a second thought. The other was a tall, fine-looking girl,  with an air and bearing calculated to rouse admiration if she had not shown so  very plainly that she was in a state of inner perturbation. Though she tried to  look amiable and pleased, I saw that she had some care on her mind, which, had  she been Mr. Deane&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e,  would have needed no explanation; but as she was only Mr. Deane&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s  friend, its cause was not so apparent.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  floor of the room, as I had happily remembered, was covered with crash, and as  I lifted each garment off&mdash;I allowed no maid to assist me in this&mdash;I shook it  well; ostensibly, because of the few flakes clinging to it, really to see if  anything could be shaken out of it. Of course, I met with no success. I had not  expected to, but it is my disposition to be thorough. These wraps I saw all  hung in an adjoining closet, the door of which I locked,&mdash;here is the key,&mdash;after  which I handed my guests over to my son who led them into the drawing-room  where they joined the few others who had previously arrived, and went myself to  telephone to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  bowed and asked where the young people were now.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Still  in the drawing-room. I have ordered the musicians to play, and consequently  there is more or less dancing. But, of course, nothing can remove the wet  blanket which has fallen over us all,&mdash;nothing but the finding of this jewel. Do  you see your way to accomplishing this? We are, from this very moment, at your  disposal; only I pray that you will make no more disturbance than is necessary,  and, if possible, arouse no suspicions you can not back up by facts. I dread a  scandal almost as much as I do sickness and death, and these young people&mdash;well,  their lives are all before them, and neither Mrs. Burton nor myself would wish  to throw the shadow of a false suspicion over the least of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  assured her that I sympathized with her scruples and would do my best to  recover the ruby without inflicting undue annoyance upon the innocent. Then I  inquired whether it was known that a detective had been called in. She seemed  to think it was suspected by some, if not by all. At which my way seemed a  trifle complicated.</p>
  <p align="left">We  were about to proceed when another thought struck me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Madam,  you have not said whether the carriage itself was searched.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  forgot. Yes, the carriage was thoroughly overhauled, and before the coachman  left the box.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who  did this overhauling?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  son. He would not trust any other hand than his own in a business of this kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One  more question, madam. Was any one seen to approach Mr. Deane on the  carriage-drive prior to his assertion that the jewel was lost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. And there were  no tracks in the snow of any such person. My son looked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And  I would look, or so I decided within myself, but I said nothing; and in silence  we proceeded toward the drawing-room.</p>
  <p align="left">I  had left my overcoat behind me, and always being well-dressed, I did not  present so bad an appearance. Still I was not in party attire and naturally  could not pass for a guest if I had wanted to, which I did not. I felt that I  must rely on insight in this case and on a certain power I had always possessed  of reading faces. That the case called for just this species of intuition I was  positive. Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s ruby was within a hundred yards of us at this very  moment, probably within a hundred feet; but to lay hands on it and without  scandal&mdash;well, that was a problem calculated to rouse the interest of even an  old police-officer like myself.</p>
  <p align="left">A  strain of music, desultory, however, and spiritless, like everything else about  the place that night, greeted us as Mrs. Ashley opened the door leading  directly into the large front hall.</p>
  <p align="left">Immediately  a scene meant to be festive, but which was, in fact, desolate, burst upon us.  The lights, the flowers and the brilliant appearance of such ladies as flitted  into sight from the almost empty parlors, were all suggestive of the cheer  suitable to a great occasion; but in spite of this, the effect was altogether  melancholy, for the hundreds who should have graced this scene, and for whom  this illumination had been made and these festoons hung, had been turned away  from the gates, and the few who felt they must remain, because their hostess  showed no disposition to let them go, wore any but holiday faces, for all their  forced smiles and pitiful attempts at nonchalance and gaiety.</p>
  <p align="left">I  scrutinized these faces carefully. I detected nothing in them but annoyance at  a situation which certainly was anything but pleasant.</p>
  <p align="left">Turning  to Mrs. Ashley, I requested her to be kind enough to point out her son, adding  that I should be glad to have a moment&rsquo;s conversation with him, also with Mr.  Deane.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Deane is in one of those small rooms over there. He is quite upset. Not even  Mrs. Burton can comfort him. My son&mdash;Oh, there is Harrison!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  tall, fine-looking young man was crossing the hall. Mrs. Ashley called him to  her, and in another moment we were standing together in one of the empty  parlors.</p>
  <p align="left">I  gave him my name and told him my business. Then I said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your  mother has allotted me an hour in which to find the valuable jewel which has  just been lost on these premises.&rdquo; Here I smiled. &ldquo;She evidently has great  confidence in my ability. I must see that I do not disappoint her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">All  this time I was examining his face. It was a handsome one, as I have said, but  it had also a very candid expression; the eyes looked straight into mine, and,  while showing anxiety, betrayed no deeper emotion than the occasion naturally  called for.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have  you any suggestions to offer? I understand that you were on the ground almost  as soon as Mr. Deane discovered his loss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">His  eyes changed a trifle but did not swerve. Of course he had been informed by his  mother of the suspicious action of the young lady who had been a member of that  gentleman&rsquo;s party, and shrank, as any one in his position would, from the  responsibilities entailed by this knowledge.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;We have done all we can. The next move must come from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is one that will settle the matter in a moment,&rdquo; I assured him, still with my  eyes fixed scrutinizingly on his face,&mdash;&ldquo;a universal search, not of places, but  of persons. But it is a harsh measure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  most disagreeable one,&rdquo; he emphasized, flushing. &ldquo;Such an indignity offered to  guests would never be forgotten or forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;True,  but if they offered to submit to this themselves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They?  How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  you,  the son of the house,&mdash;their host we may say,&mdash;should call them together and, for  your own satisfaction, empty out your pockets in the sight of every one, don&rsquo;t  you think that all the men, and possibly all the women too&mdash;&rdquo; (here I let my  voice fall suggestively) &ldquo;would be glad to follow suit? It could be done in  apparent joke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He  shook his head with a straightforward air, which raised him high in my  estimation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  would call for little but effrontery on my part,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but think what it  would demand from these boys who came here for the sole purpose of enjoying  themselves. I will not so much as mention the ladies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet  one of the latter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; he quietly acknowledged, growing restless for the first time.</p>
  <p align="left">I  withdrew my eyes from his face. I had learned what I wished. Personally he did  not shrink from search, therefore the jewel was not in his pockets. This left  but two persons for suspicion to halt between. But I disclosed nothing of my  thoughts; I merely asked pardon for a suggestion that, while pardonable in a  man accustomed to handle crime with ungloved hands, could not fail to prove  offensive to a gentleman like himself.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  must move by means less open,&rdquo; I concluded. &ldquo;It adds to our difficulties, but  that can not be helped. I should now like a glimpse of Mr. Deane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you not wish to speak to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  should prefer a sight of his face first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He  led me across the hall and pointed through an open door. In the center of a  small room containing a table and some chairs, I perceived a young man sitting,  with fallen head and dejected air, staring at vacancy. By his side, with hand  laid on his, knelt a young girl, striving in this gentle but speechless way to  comfort him. It made a pathetic picture. I drew Ashley away.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am disposed to believe in that young man,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;If he still has the jewel,  he would not try to carry off the situation in just this way. He really looks  broken-hearted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  he is dreadfully cut up. If you could have seen how frantically he searched for  the stone, and the depression into which he fell when he realized that it was  not to be found, you would not doubt him for an instant. What made you think he  might still have the ruby?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  we police officers think of everything. Then the fact that he insists that  something or some one touched his breast on the driveway strikes me as a trifle  suspicious. Your mother says that no second person could have been there, or  the snow would have given evidence of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes;  I looked expressly. Of course, the drive itself was full of hoof-marks and  wheel-tracks, for several carriages had already passed over it. Then there were  all of Deane&rsquo;s footsteps, but no other man&rsquo;s, as far as I could see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet  he insists that he was touched or struck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;With  no one there to touch or strike him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mr.  Ashley was silent.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let  us step out and take a view of the place,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;I should prefer doing  this to questioning the young man in his present state of mind.&rdquo; Then, as we  turned to put on our coats, I asked with suitable precaution: &ldquo;Do you suppose  that he has the same secret suspicions as ourselves, and that it is to hide  these he insists upon the jewel&rsquo;s having been taken away from him at a point  the ladies are known not to have approached?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Young  Ashley bent somewhat startled eyes on mine.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing  has been said to him of what Miss Peters saw Miss Glover do. I could not bring  myself to mention it. I have not even allowed myself to believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Here  a fierce gust, blowing in from the door he had just opened, cut short his  words, and neither of us spoke again till we stood on the exact spot in the  driveway where the episode we were endeavoring to understand had taken place.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  I cried as soon as I could look about me; &ldquo;the mystery is explained. Look at  that bush, or perhaps you call it a shrub. If the wind were blowing as freshly  as it is now, and very probably it was, one of those slender branches might  easily be switched against his breast, especially if he stood, as you say he  did, close against this border.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;m a fool. Only the other day I told the gardener that these branches would  need trimming in the spring, and yet I never so much as thought of them when  Mr. Deane spoke of something striking his breast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As  we turned back I made this remark:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;With  this explanation of the one doubtful point in his otherwise plausible account,  we can credit his story as being in the main true, which,&rdquo; I calmly added, &ldquo;places  him above suspicion and narrows our inquiry down to one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">We  had moved quickly and were now at the threshold of the door by which we had  come out.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Ashley,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I shall have to ask you to add to your former favors  that of showing me the young lady in whom, from this moment on, we are  especially interested. If you can manage to let me see her first without her  seeing me, I shall be infinitely obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  do not know where she is. I shall have to search for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  will wait by the hall door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">In  a few minutes he returned to me. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, and led me into what I judged  to be the library.</p>
  <p align="left">With  a gesture toward one of the windows, he backed quickly out, leaving me to face  the situation alone. I was rather glad of this. Glancing in the direction he  had indicated, and perceiving the figure of a young lady standing with her back  to me on the farther side of a flowing lace curtain, I took a few steps toward  her, hoping that the movement would cause her to turn. But it entirely failed  to produce this effect, nor did she give any sign that she noted the intrusion.  This prevented me from catching the glimpse of her face which I so desired, and  obliged me to confine myself to a study of her dress and attitude.</p>
  <p align="left">The  former was very elegant, more elegant than the appearance of her two friends  had led me to expect. Though I am far from being an authority on feminine  toilets, I yet had experience enough to know that those sweeping folds of  spotless satin, with their festoons of lace and loops of shiny trimming, which  it would be folly for me to attempt to describe, represented not only the best  efforts of the dressmaker&rsquo;s art, but very considerable means on the part of the  woman wearing such a gown. This was a discovery which altered the complexion of  my thoughts for a moment; for I had presupposed her a girl of humble means,  willing to sacrifice certain scruples to obtain a little extra money. This  imposing figure might be that of a millionaire&rsquo;s daughter; how then could I  associate her, even in my own mind, with theft? I decided that I must see her  face before giving answer to these doubts.</p>
  <p align="left">She  did not seem inclined to turn. She had raised the shade from before the wintry  panes and was engaged in looking out. Her attitude was not that of one simply  enjoying a moment&rsquo;s respite from the dance. It was rather that of an absorbed  mind brooding upon what gave little or no pleasure; and as I further gazed and  noted the droop of her lovely shoulders and the languor visible in her whole  bearing, I began to regard a glimpse of her features as imperative. Moving  forward, I came upon her suddenly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Excuse  me, Miss Smith,&rdquo; I boldly exclaimed; then paused, for she had turned  instinctively and I had seen that for which I had risked this daring move. &ldquo;Your  pardon,&rdquo; I hastily apologized. &ldquo;I mistook you for another young lady,&rdquo; and drew  back with a low bow to let her pass, for I saw that she thought only of  escaping both me and the room.</p>
  <p align="left">And  I did not wonder at this, for her eyes were streaming with tears, and her face,  which was doubtless a pretty one under ordinary conditions, looked so distorted  with distracting emotions that she was no fit subject for any man&rsquo;s eye, let  alone that of a hard-hearted officer of the law on the look-out for the guilty  hand which had just appropriated a jewel worth anywhere from eight to ten  thousand dollars.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet  I was glad to see her weep, for only first offenders weep, and first offenders  are amenable to influence, especially if they have been led into wrong by  impulse and are weak rather than wicked.</p>
  <p align="left">Anxious  to make no blunder, I resolved, before proceeding further, to learn what I  could of the character and antecedents of the suspected one, and this from the  only source which offered&mdash;Mr. Deane&rsquo;s affianced.</p>
  <p align="left">This  young lady was a delicate girl, with a face like a flower. Recognizing her  sensitive nature, I approached her with the utmost gentleness. Not seeking to  disguise either the nature of my business or my reasons for being in the house,  since all this gave me authority, I modulated my tone to suit her gentle  spirit, and, above all, I showed the utmost sympathy for her lover, whose  rights in the reward had been taken from him as certainly as the jewel had been  taken from Mrs. Burton. In this way I gained her confidence, and she was quite  ready to listen when I observed:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is a young lady here who seems to be in a state of even greater trouble than  Mr. Deane. Why is this? You brought her here. Is her sympathy with Mr. Deane so  great as to cause her to weep over his loss?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Frances?  Oh, no. She likes Mr. Deane and she likes me, but not well enough to cry over  our misfortunes. I think she has some trouble of her own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One  that you can tell me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her  surprise was manifest.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  do you ask that? What interest have you (called in, as I understand, to recover  a stolen jewel) in Frances Glover&rsquo;s personal difficulties?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  saw that I must make my position perfectly plain.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only  this. She was seen to pick up something from the driveway, where no one else  had succeeded in finding anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She?  When? Who saw her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  can not answer all these questions at once,&rdquo; I smiled. &ldquo;She was seen to do  this&mdash;no matter by whom,&mdash;during your passage from the carriage to the stoop. As  you preceded her, you naturally did not observe this action, which was  fortunate, perhaps, as you would scarcely have known what to do or say about  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes  I should,&rdquo; she retorted, with a most unexpected display of spirit. &ldquo;I should  have asked her what she had found and I should have insisted upon an answer. I  love my friends, but I love the man I am to marry, better.&rdquo; Here her voice fell  and a most becoming blush suffused her cheek.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Quite  right,&rdquo; I assented. &ldquo;Now will you answer my former question? What troubles Miss  Glover? Can you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  I can not. I only know that she has been very silent ever since she left the  house. I thought her beautiful new dress would please her, but it does not seem  to. She has been unhappy and preoccupied all the evening. She only roused a bit  when Mr. Deane showed us the ruby and said&mdash;Oh, I forgot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that? What have you forgot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  you said just now. I wouldn&rsquo;t add a word&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pardon  me!&rdquo; I smilingly interrupted, looking as fatherly as I could, &ldquo;but you have added  this word and now you must tell me what it means. You were going to say she  showed interest in the extraordinary jewel which Mr. Deane took from his pocket  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  what he let fall about the expected reward. That is, she looked eagerly at the  ruby and sighed when he acknowledged that he expected it to bring him five  hundred dollars before midnight. But any girl of no more means than she might  do that. It would not be fair to lay too much stress on a sigh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  not Miss Glover wealthy? She wears a very expensive dress, I observe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know it and I have wondered a little at it, for her father is not called very  well off. But perhaps she bought it with her own money; I know she has some;  she is an artist in burnt wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  let the subject of Miss Glover&rsquo;s dress drop. I had heard enough to satisfy me  that my first theory was correct. This young woman, beautifully dressed, and  with a face from which the rounded lines of early girlhood had not yet  departed, held in her possession, probably at this very moment, Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s  magnificent jewel. But where? On her person or hidden in some of her  belongings? I remembered the cloak in the closet and thought it wise to assure  myself that the jewel was not secreted in this garment, before I proceeded to  extreme measures. Mrs. Ashley, upon being consulted, agreed with me as to the  desirability of this, and presently I had this poor girl&rsquo;s cloak in my hands.</p>
  <p align="left">Did  I find the ruby? No; but I found something else tucked away in an inner pocket  which struck me as bearing quite pointedly upon this case. It was the  bill&mdash;crumpled, soiled and tear-stained&mdash;of the dress whose elegance had so  surprised her friends and made me, for a short time, regard her as the daughter  of wealthy parents. An enormous bill, which must have struck dismay to the soul  of this self-supporting girl, who probably had no idea of how a French  dressmaker can foot up items. Four hundred and fifty dollars! and for one gown!  I declare I felt indignant myself and could quite understand why she heaved  that little sigh when Mr. Deane spoke of the five hundred dollars he expected  from Mrs. Burton, and later, how she came to succumb to the temptation of  making the effort to secure this sum for herself when, in following the latter&rsquo;s  footsteps up the driveway, she stumbled upon this same jewel fallen, as it  were, from his pocket into her very hands. The impulse of the moment was so  strong and the consequences so little anticipated!</p>
  <p align="left">It  is not at all probable that she foresaw he would shout aloud his loss and draw  the whole household out on the porch. Of course when he did this, the  feasibility of her project was gone, and I only wished that I had been present  and able to note her countenance, as, crowded in with others on that windy  porch, she watched the progress of the search, which every moment made it not  only less impossible for her to attempt the restoration upon which the reward  depended, but must have caused her to feel, if she had been as well brought up  as all indications showed, that it was a dishonest act of which she had been  guilty and that, willing or not, she must look upon herself as a thief so long  as she held the jewel back from Mr. Deane or its rightful owner. But how face  the publicity of restoring it now, after this elaborate and painful search, in  which even the son of her hostess had taken part?</p>
  <p align="left">That  would be to proclaim her guilt and thus effectually ruin her in the eyes of  everybody concerned. No, she would keep the compromising article a little  longer, in the hope of finding some opportunity of returning it without risk to  her good name. And so she allowed the search to proceed.</p>
  <p align="left">I  have entered thus elaborately into the supposed condition of this girl&rsquo;s mind  on this critical evening, that you may understand why I felt a certain sympathy  for her, which forbade harsh measures. I was sure, from the glimpse I had  caught of her face, that she longed to be relieved from the tension she was  under, and that she would gladly rid herself of this valuable jewel if she only  knew how. This opportunity I proposed to give her; and this is why, on  returning the bill to its place, I assumed such an air of relief on rejoining  Mrs. Ashley.</p>
  <p align="left">She  saw, and drew me aside.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have not found it!&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I returned, &ldquo;but I am positive where it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  where is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Over  Miss Glover&rsquo;s uneasy heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Ashley turned pale.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;  said I; &ldquo;I have a scheme for getting it hence without making her shame public.  Listen!&rdquo; and I whispered a few words in her ear.</p>
  <p align="left">She  surveyed me in amazement for a moment, then nodded, and her face lighted up.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are certainly earning your reward,&rdquo; she declared; and summoning her son, who  was never far away from her side, she whispered her wishes. He started, bowed  and hurried from the room.</p>
  <p align="left">By  this time my business in the house was well-known to all, and I could not  appear in hall or parlor without a great silence falling upon every one  present, followed by a breaking up of the only too small circle of unhappy  guests into agitated groups. But I appeared to see nothing of all this till the  proper moment, when, turning suddenly upon them all, I cried out cheerfully,  but with a certain deference I thought would please them:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ladies  and gentlemen: I have an interesting fact to announce. The snow which was taken  up from the driveway has been put to melt in the great feed caldron over the  stable fire. We expect to find the ruby at the bottom, and Mrs. Ashley invites  you to be present at its recovery. It has now stopped snowing and she thought  you might enjoy the excitement of watching the water ladled out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  dozen girls bounded forward.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  yes, what fun! where are our cloaks&mdash;our rubbers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Two  only stood hesitating. One of these was Mr. Deane&rsquo;s lady love and the other her  friend, Miss Glover. The former, perhaps, secretly wondered. The latter&mdash;but I  dared not look long enough or closely enough in her direction to judge just  what her emotions were. Presently these, too, stepped forward into the excited  circle of young people, and were met by the two maids who were bringing in  their wraps. Amid the bustle which now ensued, I caught sight of Mr. Deane&rsquo;s  face peering from an open doorway. It was all alive with hope. I also perceived  a lady looking down from the second story, who, I felt sure, was Mrs. Burton  herself. Evidently my confident tone had produced more effect than the words  themselves. Every one looked upon the jewel as already recovered and regarded  my invitation to the stable as a ruse by which I hoped to restore universal  good feeling by giving them all a share in my triumph.</p>
  <p align="left">All  but one! Nothing could make Miss Glover look otherwise than anxious, restless  and unsettled, and though she followed in the wake of the rest, it was with  hidden face and lagging step, as if she recognized the whole thing as a farce  and doubted her own power to go through it calmly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah,  ha! my lady,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;only be patient and you will see what I shall do for  you.&rdquo; And indeed I thought her eye brightened as we all drew up around the huge  caldron standing full of water over the stable stove. As pains had already been  taken to put out the fire in this stove, the ladies were not afraid of injuring  their dresses and consequently crowded as close as their numbers would permit.  Miss Glover especially stood within reach of the brim, and as soon as I noted  this, I gave the signal which had been agreed upon between Mr. Ashley and  myself. Instantly the electric lights went out, leaving the place in total  darkness.</p>
  <p align="left">A  scream from the girls, a burst of hilarious laughter from their escorts,  mingled with loud apologies from their seemingly mischievous host, filled up  the interval of darkness which I had insisted should not be too soon curtailed;  then the lights glowed as suddenly as they had gone out, and while the glare  was fresh on every face, I stole a glance at Miss Glover to see if she had made  good use of the opportunity just accorded for ridding herself of the jewel by  dropping it into the caldron. If she had, both her troubles and mine were at an  end; if she had not, then I need feel no further scruple in approaching her  with the direct question I had hitherto found it so difficult to put.</p>
  <p align="left">She  stood with both hands grasping her cloak which she had drawn tightly about the  rich folds of her new and expensive dress; but her eyes were fixed straight  before her with a soft light in their depths which made her positively  beautiful.</p>
  <p align="left">The  jewel is in the pot, I inwardly decided, and ordered the two waiting stablemen  to step forward with their ladles. Quickly those ladles went in, but before  they could be lifted out dripping, half the ladies had scurried back, afraid of  injury to their pretty dresses. But they soon sidled forward again, and watched  with beaming eyes the slow but sure emptying of the great caldron at whose  bottom they anticipated finding the lost jewel.</p>
  <p align="left">As  the ladles were plunged deeper and deeper, the heads drew closer and so great  was the interest shown, that the busiest lips forgot to chatter, and eyes,  whose only business up till now had been to follow with shy curiosity every  motion made by their handsome young host, now settled on the murky depths of  the great pot whose bottom was almost in sight.</p>
  <p align="left">As  I heard the ladles strike this bottom, I instinctively withdrew a step in  anticipation of the loud hurrah which would naturally hail the first sight of  the lost ruby. Conceive, then, my chagrin, my bitter and mortified  disappointment, when, after one look at the broad surface of the now exposed  bottom, the one shout which rose was:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">*  * * * * * *</p>
  <p align="left">I  was so thoroughly put out that I did not wait to hear the loud complaints which  burst from every lip. Drawing Mr. Ashley aside (who, by the way, seemed as much  affected as myself by the turn affairs had taken) I remarked to him that there  was only one course left open to us.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  what is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To  ask Miss Glover to show me what she picked up from your driveway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  if she refuses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To  take her quietly with me to the station, where we have women who can make sure  that the ruby is not on her person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mr.  Ashley made an involuntary gesture of strong repugnance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let  us pray that it will not come to that,&rdquo; he objected hoarsely. &ldquo;Such a fine  figure of a girl! Did you notice how bright and happy she looked when the  lights sprang up? I declare she struck me as lovely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  she did me, and caused me to draw some erroneous conclusions. I shall have to  ask you to procure me an interview with her as soon as we return to the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  shall meet you in the library.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But  when, a few minutes later, she joined me in the room just designated and I had  full opportunity for reading her countenance, I own that my task became  suddenly hateful to me. She was not far from my own daughter&rsquo;s age and, had it  not been for her furtive look of care, appeared almost as blooming and bright.  Would it ever come to pass that a harsh man of the law would feel it his duty  to speak to my Flora as I must now speak to the young girl before me? The  thought made me inwardly recoil and it was in as gentle a manner as possible  that I made my bow and began with the following remark:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  hope you will pardon me, Miss Glover&mdash;I am told that is your name. I hate to  disturb your pleasure&mdash;&rdquo; (this with the tears of alarm and grief rising in her  eyes) &ldquo;but you can tell me something which will greatly simplify my task and  possibly put matters in such shape that you and your friends can be released to  your homes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She  stood before me with amazed eyes, the color rising in her cheeks. I had to  force my next words, which, out of consideration for her, I made as direct as  possible.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  miss. What was the article you were seen to pick up from the driveway soon  after leaving your carriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She  started, then stumbled backward, tripping in her long train.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  pick up?&rdquo; she murmured. Then with a blush, whether of anger or pride I could  not tell, she coldly answered: &ldquo;Oh, that was something of my own,&mdash;something I  had just dropped. I had rather not tell you what it was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  scrutinized her closely. She met my eyes squarely, yet not with just the clear  light I should, remembering Flora, have been glad to see there.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think it would be better for you to be entirely frank,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It was the  only article known to have been picked up from the driveway after Mr. Deane&rsquo;s  loss of the ruby; and though we do not presume to say that it was the ruby, yet  the matter would look clearer to us all if you would frankly state what this  object was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her  whole body seemed to collapse and she looked as if about to sink.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  where is Minnie? Where is Mr. Deane?&rdquo; she moaned, turning and staring at the  door, as if she hoped they would fly to her aid. Then, in a burst of  indignation which I was fain to believe real, she turned on me with the cry: &ldquo;It  was a bit of paper which I had thrust into the bosom of my gown. It fell out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your  dressmaker&rsquo;s bill?&rdquo; I intimated.</p>
  <p align="left">She  stared, laughed hysterically for a moment, then sank upon a near-by sofa,  sobbing spasmodically.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she cried, after a moment; &ldquo;my dressmaker&rsquo;s bill. You seem to know all my  affairs.&rdquo; Then suddenly, and with a startling impetuosity, which drew her to  her feet: &ldquo;Are you going to tell everybody that? Are you going to state  publicly that Miss Glover brought an unpaid bill to the party and that because  Mr. Deane was unfortunate enough or careless enough to drop and lose the jewel  he was bringing to Mrs. Burton, she is to be looked upon as a thief, because  she stooped to pick up this bill which had slipped inadvertently from its  hiding-place? I shall die if you do,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I shall die if it is already  known,&rdquo; she pursued, with increasing emotion. &ldquo;Is it? Is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her  passion was so great, so much greater than any likely to rise in a breast  wholly innocent, that I began to feel very sober.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No  one but Mrs. Ashley and possibly her son know about the bill,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and no  one shall, if you will go with that lady to her room, and make plain to her, in  the only way you can, that the extremely valuable article which has been lost  to-night is not in your possession.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She  threw up her arms with a scream. &ldquo;Oh, what a horror! I can not! I can not! Oh,  I shall die of shame! My father! My mother!&rdquo; And she burst from the room like  one distraught.</p>
  <p align="left">But  in another moment she came cringing back. &ldquo;I can not face them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They  all believe it; they will always believe it unless I submit&mdash;Oh, why did I ever  come to this dreadful place? Why did I order this hateful dress which I can  never pay for and which, in spite of the misery it has caused me, has failed to  bring me the&mdash;&rdquo; She did not continue. She had caught my eye and seen there,  perhaps, some evidence of the pity I could not but experience for her. With a  sudden change of tone she advanced upon me with the appeal: &ldquo;Save me from this  humiliation. I have not seen the ruby. I am as ignorant of its whereabouts  as&mdash;as Mr. Ashley himself. Won&rsquo;t you believe me? Won&rsquo;t they be satisfied if I  swear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  was really sorry for her. I began to think too that some dreadful mistake had  been made. Her manner seemed too ingenuous for guilt. Yet where could that ruby  be, if not with this young girl? Certainly, all other possibilities had been  exhausted, and her story of the bill, even if accepted, would never quite  exonerate her from secret suspicion while that elusive jewel remained unfound.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  give me no hope,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I must go out before them all and ask to have it  proved that I am no thief. Oh, if God would have pity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Or  some one would find&mdash;Halloo! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  shout had risen from the hall beyond.</p>
  <p align="left">She  gasped and we both plunged forward. Mr. Ashley, still in his overcoat, stood at  the other end of the hall, and facing him were ranged the whole line of young  people whom I had left scattered about in the various parlors. I thought he  looked peculiar; certainly his appearance differed from that of a quarter of an  hour before, and when he glanced our way and saw who was standing with me in  the library doorway, his voice took on a tone which made me doubt whether he  was about to announce good news or bad.</p>
  <p align="left">But  his first word settled that question.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rejoice  with me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The  ruby has been found! Do you want to see the culprit?&mdash;for there is  a culprit. We have him at the door; shall we bring him in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  yes,&rdquo; cried several voices, among them that of Mr. Deane, who now strode  forward with beaming eyes and instinctively lifted hand. But some of the ladies  looked frightened, and Mr. Ashley, noting this, glanced for encouragement  toward us.</p>
  <p align="left">He  seemed to find it in Miss Glover&rsquo;s eyes. She had quivered and nearly fallen at  that word found,  but had drawn herself up by this time and was awaiting his further action in a  fever of relief and hope which perhaps no one but myself could fully  appreciate.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  vile thief! A most unconscionable rascal!&rdquo; vociferated Mr. Ashley. &ldquo;You must  see him, mother; you must see him, ladies, else you will not realize our good  fortune. Open the door there and bring in the robber!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">At  this command, uttered in ringing tones, the huge leaves of the great front door  swung slowly forward, revealing the sturdy forms of the two stablemen holding  down by main force the towering figure of&mdash;a horse!</p>
  <p align="left">The  scream of astonishment which went up from all sides, united to Mr. Ashley&rsquo;s  shout of hilarity, caused the animal, unused, no doubt, to drawing-rooms, to  rear to the length of his bridle. At which Mr. Ashley laughed again and gaily  cried:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Confound  the fellow! Look at him, mother; look at him, ladies! Do you not see guilt  written on his brow? It is he who has made us all this trouble. First, he must  needs take umbrage at the two lights with which we presumed to illuminate our  porch; then, envying Mrs. Burton her ruby and Mr. Deane his reward, seek to rob  them both by grinding his hoofs all over the snow of the driveway till he came  upon the jewel which Mr. Deane had dropped from his pocket, and taking it up in  a ball of snow, secrete it in his left hind shoe,&mdash;where it might be yet, if Mr.  Spencer&mdash;&rdquo; here he bowed to a strange gentleman who at that moment entered&mdash;&ldquo;had  not come himself for his daughters, and, going first to the stable, found his  horse so restless and seemingly lame&mdash;(there, boys, you may take the wretch away  now and harness him, but first hold up that guilty left hind hoof for the  ladies to see)&mdash;that he stooped to examine him, and so came upon this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Here  the young gentleman brought forward his hand. In it was a nondescript little  wad, well soaked and shapeless; but, once he had untied the kid, such a ray of  rosy light burst from his outstretched palm that I doubt if a single woman  there noted the clatter of the retiring beast or the heavy clang made by the two  front doors as they shut upon the robber. Eyes and tongues were too busy, and Mr. Ashley,  realizing, probably, that the interest of all present would remain, for a few  minutes at least, with this marvelous jewel so astonishingly recovered, laid  it, with many expressions of thankfulness, in Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s now eagerly  outstretched palm, and advancing toward us, paused in front of Miss Glover and  eagerly held out his hand.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Congratulate  me,&rdquo; he prayed. &ldquo;All our troubles are over&mdash;Oh, what now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  poor young thing, in trying to smile, had turned as white as a sheet. Before  either of us could interpose an arm, she had slipped to the floor in a dead  faint. With a murmur of pity and possibly of inward contrition, he stooped over  her and together we carried her into the library, where I left her in his care,  confident, from certain indications, that my presence would not be greatly  missed by either of them.</p>
  <p align="left">Whatever  hope I may have had of reaping the reward offered by Mrs. Ashley was now lost,  but, in the satisfaction I experienced at finding this young girl as innocent  as my Flora, I did not greatly care.</p>
  <p align="left">Well,  it all ended even more happily than may here appear. The horse not putting in  his claim to the reward, and Mr. Spencer repudiating all right to it, it was paid  in full to Mr. Deane, who went home in as buoyant a state of mind as was  possible to him after the great anxieties of the preceding two hours. Miss  Glover was sent back by the Ashleys in their own carriage and I was told that  Mr. Ashley declined to close the carriage door upon her till she had promised  to come again the following night.</p>
  <p align="left">Anxious  to make such amends as I personally could for my share in the mortification to  which she had been subjected, I visited her in the morning, with the intention  of offering a suggestion or two in regard to that little bill. But she met my  first advance with a radiant smile and the glad exclamation:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I have settled all that! I have just come from Madame Dupr&egrave;&rsquo;s. I told her that  I had never imagined the dress could possibly cost more than a hundred dollars,  and I offered her that sum if she would take the garment back. And she did, she  did, and I shall never have to wear that dreadful satin again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I  made a note of this dressmaker&rsquo;s name. She and I may have a bone to pick some  day. But I said nothing to Miss Glover. I merely exclaimed:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I have an old spotted muslin which, with a few natural flowers, will make me  look festive enough. One does not need fine clothes when one is&mdash;happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  dreamy far-off smile with which she finished the sentence was more eloquent  than words, and I was not surprised when some time later I read of her  engagement to Mr. Ashley.</p>
  <p align="left">But  it was not till she could sign herself with his name that she told me just what  underlay the misery of that night. She had met Harrison Ashley more than once  before, and, though she did not say so, had evidently conceived an admiration  for him which made her especially desirous of attracting and pleasing him. Not  understanding the world very well, certainly having very little knowledge of  the tastes and feelings of wealthy people, she conceived that the more  brilliantly she was attired the more likely she would be to please this rich  young man. So in a moment of weakness she decided to devote all her small  savings (a hundred dollars, as we know) to buying a gown such as she felt she  could appear in at his house without shame.</p>
  <p align="left">It  came home, as dresses from French dressmakers are very apt to do, just in time  for her to put it on for the party. The bill came with it and when she saw the  amount&mdash;it was all itemized and she could find no fault with anything but the  summing up&mdash;she was so overwhelmed that she nearly fainted. But she could not  give up her ball; so she dressed herself, and, being urged all the time to  hurry, hardly stopped to give one look at the new and splendid gown which had  cost so much. The bill&mdash;the incredible, the enormous bill&mdash;was all she could  think of, and the figures, which represented nearly her whole year&rsquo;s earnings,  danced constantly before her eyes. How to pay it&mdash;but she could not pay it, nor  could she ask her father to do so. She was ruined; but the ball, and Mr.  Ashley&mdash;these still awaited her; so presently she worked herself up to some  anticipation of enjoyment, and, having thrown on her cloak, was turning down  her light preparatory to departure, when her eye fell on the bill lying open on  her dresser.</p>
  <p align="left">It  would never do to leave it there&mdash;never do to leave it anywhere in her room.  There were prying eyes in the house, and she was as ashamed of that bill as she  might have been of a contemplated theft. So she tucked it in her corsage and  went down to join her friends in the carriage.</p>
  <p align="left">The  rest we know, all but one small detail which turned to gall whatever enjoyment  she was able to get out of the early evening. There was a young girl present,  dressed in a simple muslin gown. While looking at it and inwardly contrasting  it with her own splendor, Mr. Ashley passed by with another gentleman and she  heard him say:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  much better young girls look in simple white than in the elaborate silks only  suitable for their mothers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Thoughtless  words, possibly forgotten as soon as uttered, but they sharply pierced this  already sufficiently stricken and uneasy breast and were the cause of the tears  which had aroused my suspicion when I came upon her in the library, standing  with her face to the night.</p>
  <p align="left">But  who can say whether, if the evening had been devoid of these occurrences and no  emotions of contrition and pity had been awakened in her behalf in the breast  of her chivalrous host, she would ever have become Mrs. Ashley?</p>
