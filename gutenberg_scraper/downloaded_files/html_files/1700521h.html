    A Cry On The Hill</b></h2>
  <p>The  dance was over. From the great house on the hill the guests had all departed  and only the musicians remained. As they filed out through the ample doorway,  on their way home, the first faint streak of early dawn became visible in the  east. One of them, a lank, plain-featured young man of ungainly aspect but  penetrating eye, called the attention of the others to it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;  said he; &ldquo;there is the daylight! This has been a gay night for 
    Sutherlandtown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  gay,&rdquo; muttered another, starting aside as the slight figure of a young man  coming from the house behind them rushed hastily by. &ldquo;Why, who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  they one and all had recognised the person thus alluded to, no one answered  till he had dashed out of the gate and disappeared in the woods on the other  side of the road. Then they all spoke at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  Mr. Frederick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  seems in a desperate hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  trod on my toes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you hear the words he was muttering as he went by?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  only the last question was calculated to rouse any interest, it alone received  attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  what were they? I heard him say something, but I failed to catch the words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wasn&rsquo;t talking to you, or to me either, for that matter; but I have ears that  can hear an eye wink. He said: &lsquo;Thank God, this night of horror is over!&rsquo; Think  of that! After such a dance and such a spread, he calls the night horrible and  thanks God that it is over. I thought he was the very man to enjoy this kind of  thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  did I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so did I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  five musicians exchanged looks, then huddled in a group at the gate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has quarrelled with his sweetheart,&rdquo; suggested one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not surprised at that,&rdquo; declared another. &ldquo;I never thought it would be a match.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shame  if it were!&rdquo; muttered the ungainly youth who had spoken first.</p>
  <p>As  the subject of this comment was the son of the gentleman whose house they were  just leaving, they necessarily spoke low; but their tones were rife with  curiosity, and it was evident that the topic deeply interested them. One of the  five who had not previously spoken now put in a word:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw him when he first led out Miss Page to dance, and I saw him again when he  stood up opposite her in the last quadrille, and I tell you, boys, there was a  mighty deal of difference in the way he conducted himself toward her in the  beginning of the evening and the last. You wouldn&rsquo;t have thought him the same  man. Reckless young fellows like him are not to be caught by dimples only. They  want cash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  family, at least; and she hasn&rsquo;t either. But what a pretty girl she is! Many a  fellow as rich as he and as well connected would be satisfied with her good  looks alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  looks!&rdquo; High scorn was observable in this exclamation, which was made by the  young man whom I have before characterised as ungainly. &ldquo;I refuse to  acknowledge that she has any good looks. On the contrary, I consider her plain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  Oh!&rdquo; burst in protest from more than one mouth. &ldquo;And why does she have every  fellow in the room dangling after her, then?&rdquo; asked the player on the  flageolet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  hasn&rsquo;t a regular feature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  difference does that make when it isn&rsquo;t her features you notice, but herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  laugh followed this.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  won&rsquo;t trouble her, Sweetwater. Sutherland does, if you don&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s much  more to the point. And he&rsquo;ll marry her yet; he can&rsquo;t help it. Why, she&rsquo;d witch  the devil into leading her to the altar if she took a notion to have him for  her bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  would be consistency in that,&rdquo; muttered the fellow just addressed. &ldquo;But Mr.  Frederick&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  There&rsquo;s some one on the doorstep. Why, it&rsquo;s she!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  all glanced back. The graceful figure of a young girl dressed in white was to  be seen leaning toward them from the open doorway. Behind her shone a blaze of  light&mdash;the candles not having been yet extinguished in the hall&mdash;and against this  brilliant background her slight form, with all its bewitching outlines, stood  out in plain relief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  was that?&rdquo; she began in a high, almost strident voice, totally out of keeping  with the sensuous curves of her strange, sweet face. But the question remained  unanswered, for at that moment her attention, as well as that of the men  lingering at the gate, was attracted by the sound of hurrying feet and confused  cries coming up the hill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder!  Murder!&rdquo; was the word panted out by more than one harsh voice; and in another  instant a dozen men and boys came rushing into sight in a state of such  excitement that the five musicians recoiled from the gate, and one of them went  so far as to start back toward the house. As he did so he noticed a curious  thing. The young woman whom they had all perceived standing in the door a  moment before had vanished, yet she was known to possess the keenest curiosity  of any one in town.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder!  Murder!&rdquo; A terrible and unprecedented cry in this old, God-fearing town. Then  came in hoarse explanation from the jostling group as they stopped at the gate:  &ldquo;Mrs. Webb has been killed! Stabbed with a knife! Tell Mr. Sutherland!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Webb!</p>
  <p>As  the musicians heard this name, so honoured and so universally beloved, they to  a man uttered a cry. Mrs. Webb! Why, it was impossible. Shouting in their turn  for Mr. Sutherland, they all crowded forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  Mrs. Webb!&rdquo; they protested. &ldquo;Who could have the daring or the heart to kill <i>her</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  knows,&rdquo; answered a voice from the highway. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s dead&mdash;we&rsquo;ve just seen her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it&rsquo;s the old man&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; quavered a piping voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said he would  turn on his best friend some day. &lsquo;Sylum&rsquo;s the best place for folks as has lost  their wits. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  here a hand was put over his mouth, and the rest of the words was lost in an  inarticulate gurgle. Mr. Sutherland had just appeared on the porch.</p>
  <p>He  was a superb-looking man, with an expression of mingled kindness and dignity  that invariably awakened both awe and admiration in the spectator. No man in  the country&mdash;I was going to say no woman was more beloved, or held in higher  esteem. Yet he could not control his only son, as everyone within ten miles of  the hill well knew.</p>
  <p>At  this moment his face showed both pain and shock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  name are you shouting out there?&rdquo; he brokenly demanded. &ldquo;Agatha Webb? Is Agatha Webb hurt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; killed,&rdquo; repeated a half-dozen voices at once. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just come from the  house. All the town is up. Some say her husband did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no!&rdquo; was Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s decisive though half-inaudible response. &ldquo;Philemon  Webb might end his own life, but not Agatha&rsquo;s. It was the money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  he caught himself up, and, raising his voice, addressed the crowd of villagers  more directly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;and I will go back with you. Where is Frederick?&rdquo; he demanded of such  members of his own household as stood about him.</p>
  <p>No  one knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish some one would find my son. I want him to go into town with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  over in the woods there,&rdquo; volunteered a voice from without.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the woods!&rdquo; repeated the father, in a surprised tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; we all saw him go. Shall we sing out to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no; I will manage very well without him.&rdquo; And taking up his hat Mr. Sutherland stepped out again upon the porch.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  he stopped. A hand had been laid on his arm and an insinuating voice was  murmuring in his ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mind if I go with you? I will not make any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the same young lady we have seen before.</p>
  <p>The  old gentleman frowned&mdash;he who never frowned and remarked shortly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  scene of murder is no place for women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  face upturned to his remained unmoved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I will go,&rdquo; she quietly persisted. &ldquo;I can easily mingle with the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  said not another word against it. Miss Page was under pay in his house, but for  the last few weeks no one had undertaken to contradict her. In the interval  since her first appearance on the porch, she had exchanged the light dress in  which she had danced at the ball, for a darker and more serviceable one, and  perhaps this token of her determination may have had its influence in silencing  him. He joined the crowd, and together they moved down-hill. This was too much  for the servants of the house. One by one they too left the house till it stood  absolutely empty. Jerry snuffed out the candles and shut the front door, but  the side entrance stood wide open, and into this entrance, as the last footstep  died out on the hillside, passed a slight and resolute figure. It was that of  the musician who had questioned Miss Page&rsquo;s attractions.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
    One Night&rsquo;s Work</b></h2>
  <p>Sutherlandtown  was a seaport. The village, which was a small one, consisted of one long street  and numerous cross streets running down from the hillside and ending on the  wharves. On one of the corners thus made, stood the Webb house, with its front  door on the main street and its side door on one of the hillside lanes. As the  group of men and boys who had been in search of Mr. Sutherland entered this  last-mentioned lane, they could pick out this house from all the others, as it  was the only one in which a light was still burning. Mr. Sutherland lost no  time in entering upon the scene of tragedy. As his imposing figure emerged from  the darkness and paused on the outskirts of the crowd that was blocking up  every entrance to the house, a murmur of welcome went up, after which a way was  made for him to the front door.</p>
  <p>But  before he could enter, some one plucked him by the sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  up!&rdquo; whispered a voice into his ear.</p>
  <p>He  did so, and saw a woman&rsquo;s body hanging half out of an upper window. It hung  limp, and the sight made him sick, notwithstanding his threescore years of  experience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not Agatha Webb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  that&rsquo;s Batsy, the cook. She&rsquo;s dead as well as her mistress. We left her where  we found her for the coroner to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this is horrible,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Sutherland. &ldquo;Has there been a butcher here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he uttered these words, he felt another quick pressure on his arm. Looking  down, he saw leaning against him the form of a young woman, but before he could  address her she had started upright again and was moving on with the throng. It  was Miss Page.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was the sight of this woman hanging from the window which first drew attention  to the house,&rdquo; volunteered a man who was standing as a sort of guardian at the  main gateway. &ldquo;Some of the sailors&rsquo; wives who had been to the wharves to see  their husbands off on the ship that sailed at daybreak, saw it as they came up  the lane on their way home, and gave the alarm. Without that we might not have  known to this hour what had happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Mrs. Webb?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in and see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a board fence about the simple yard within which stood the humble house  forever after to be pointed out as the scene of Sutherlandtown&rsquo;s most  heart-rending tragedy. In this fence was a gate, and through this gate now  passed Mr. Sutherland, followed by his would-be companion, Miss Page. A path  bordered by lilac bushes led up to the house, the door of which stood wide  open. As soon as Mr. Sutherland entered upon this path a man approached him  from the doorway. It was Amos Fenton, the constable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Mr. Sutherland,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sad business, a very sad business! But what little  girl have you there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is Miss Page, my housekeeper&rsquo;s niece. She would come. 
    Inquisitiveness the cause. I do not approve of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Page must remain on the doorstep. We allow no one inside excepting yourself,&rdquo;  he said respectfully, in recognition of the fact that nothing of importance was  ever undertaken in Sutherlandtown without the presence of Mr. Sutherland.</p>
  <p>Miss  Page curtsied, looking so bewitching in the fresh morning light that the tough  old constable scratched his chin in grudging admiration. But he did not  reconsider his determination. Seeing this, she accepted her defeat gracefully,  and moved aside to where the bushes offered her more or less protection from  the curiosity of those about her. Meanwhile Mr. Sutherland had stepped into the  house.</p>
  <p>He  found himself in a small hall with a staircase in front and an open door at the  left. On the threshold of this open door a man stood, who at sight of him  doffed his hat. Passing by this man, Mr. Sutherland entered the room beyond. A  table spread with eatables met his view, beside which, in an attitude which  struck him at the moment as peculiar, sat Philemon Webb, the well-known master  of the house.</p>
  <p>Astonished  at seeing his old friend in this room and in such a position, he was about to  address him, when Mr. Fenton stopped him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;Take a look at poor Philemon before you disturb him. When we broke  into the house a half-hour ago he was sitting just as you see him now, and we  have let him be for reasons you can easily appreciate. Examine him closely, Mr.  Sutherland; he won&rsquo;t notice it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what ails him? Why does he sit crouched against the table? Is he hurt too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  look at his eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland stooped and pushed aside the long grey locks that half concealed the  countenance of his aged friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;  he cried, startled, &ldquo;they are closed! He isn&rsquo;t dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he is asleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Asleep?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  He was asleep when we came in and he is asleep yet. Some of the neighbours  wanted to wake him, but I would not let them. His wits are not strong enough to  bear a sudden shock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, poor Philemon! But that he should sit sleeping here while she&mdash;But what do  these bottles mean and this parade of supper in a room they were not accustomed  to eat in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t know. It has not been eaten, you see. He has swallowed a glass of port,  but that is all. The other glasses have had no wine in them, nor have the  victuals been touched.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seats  set for three and only one occupied,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Sutherland. &ldquo;Strange! Could he have expected guests?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  looks like it. I didn&rsquo;t know that his wife allowed him such privileges; but she  was always too good to him, and I fear has paid for it with her life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  he never killed her. Had his love been anything short of the worship it was, he  stood in too much awe of her to lift his hand against her, even in his most  demented moments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t trust men of uncertain wits,&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;You have not noticed  everything that is to be seen in this room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland, recalled to himself by these words, looked quickly about him. With  the exception of the table and what was on and by it there was nothing else in  the room. Naturally his glance returned to Philemon Webb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see anything but this poor sleeping man,&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  at his sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland, with a start, again bent down. The arm of his old friend lay  crooked upon the table, and on its blue cotton sleeve there was a smear which  might have been wine, but which was&mdash;blood.</p>
  <p>As  Mr. Sutherland became assured of this, he turned slightly pale and looked  inquiringly at the two men who were intently watching him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is bad,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Any other marks of blood below stairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  that one smear is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Philemon!&rdquo; burst from Mr. Sutherland, in deep emotion. Then, as he looked long  and shudderingly at his friend, he added slowly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has been in the room where she was killed; so much is evident. But that he  understood what was done there I cannot believe, or he would not be sleeping  here like a log. Come, let us go up-stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton,  with an admonitory gesture toward his subordinate, turned directly toward the  staircase. Mr. Sutherland followed him, and they at once proceeded to the upper  hall and into the large front room which had been the scene of the tragedy.</p>
  <p>It  was the parlour or sitting-room of this small and unpretentious house. A rag  carpet covered the floor and the furniture was of the plainest kind, but the  woman who lay outstretched on the stiff, old-fashioned lounge opposite the door  was far from being in accord with the homely type of her surroundings. Though  the victim of a violent death, her face and form, both of a beauty seldom to be  found among women of any station, were so majestic in their calm repose, that  Mr. Sutherland, accustomed as he was to her noble appearance, experienced a  shock of surprise that found vent in these words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murdered!  she? You have made some mistake, my friends. Look at her face!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  even in the act of saying this his eyes fell on the blood which had dyed her  cotton dress and he cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was she struck and where is the weapon which has made this ghastly wound?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was struck while standing or sitting at this table,&rdquo; returned the constable,  pointing to two or three drops of blood on its smooth surface. &ldquo;The weapon we  have not found, but the wound shows that it was inflicted by a three-sided  dagger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  three-sided dagger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know there was such a thing in town. Philemon could have had no dagger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does not seem so, but one can never tell. Simple cottages like these often  contain the most unlooked-for articles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot imagine a dagger being among its effects,&rdquo; declared Mr. 
    Sutherland. &ldquo;Where was the body of Mrs. Webb lying when you came in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  you see it now. Nothing has been moved or changed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was found here, on this lounge, in the same position in which we see her now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that is incredible. Look at the way she lies! Hands crossed, eyes closed, as  though made ready for her burial. Only loving hands could have done this. What  does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  means Philemon; that is what it means Philemon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland shuddered, but said nothing. He was dumbfounded by these evidences  of a crazy man&rsquo;s work. Philemon Webb always seemed so harmless, though he had  been failing in mind for the last ten years.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&rdquo;  cried Mr. Sutherland, suddenly rousing, &ldquo;there is another victim. 
    I saw old woman Batsy hanging from a window ledge, dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she is in this other room; but there is no wound on Batsy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  was she killed, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  the doctors must tell us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland, guided by Mr. Fenton&rsquo;s gesture, entered a small room opening into  the one in which they stood. His attention was at once attracted by the body of  the woman he had seen from below, lying half in and half out of the open  window. That she was dead was evident; but, as Mr. Fenton had said, no wound  was to be seen upon her, nor were there any marks of blood on or about the  place where she lay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is a dreadful business,&rdquo; groaned Mr. Sutherland, &ldquo;the worst I have ever had  anything to do with. Help me to lift the woman in; she has been long enough a  show for the people outside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a bed in this room (indeed, it was Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s bedroom), and upon this poor  Batsy was laid. As the face came uppermost both gentlemen started and looked at  each other in amazement. The expression of terror and alarm which it showed was  in striking contrast to the look of exaltation to be seen on the face of her  dead mistress.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    The Empty Drawer</b></h2>
  <p>As  they re-entered the larger room, they were astonished to come upon Miss Page  standing in the doorway. She was gazing at the recumbent figure of the dead  woman, and for a moment seemed unconscious of their presence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you get in? Which of my men was weak enough to let you pass, against my  express instructions?&rdquo; asked the constable, who was of an irritable and  suspicious nature.</p>
  <p>She  let the hood drop from her head, and, turning, surveyed him with a slow smile.  There was witchery in that smile sufficient to affect a much more cultivated  and callous nature than his, and though he had been proof against it once he  could not quite resist the effect of its repetition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  insisted upon entering,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Do not blame the men; they did not want to  use force against a woman.&rdquo; She had not a good voice and she knew it; but she  covered up this defect by a choice of intonations that carried her lightest  speech to the heart. Hard-visaged Amos Fenton gave a grunt, which was as near  an expression of approval as he ever gave to anyone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!  well!&rdquo; he growled, but not ill-naturedly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a morbid curiosity that brings  you here. Better drop it, girl; it won&rsquo;t do you any good in the eyes of  sensible people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; was her demure reply, her lips dimpling at the corners in a way to shock  the sensitive Mr. Sutherland.</p>
  <p>Glancing  from her to the still outlines of the noble figure on the couch, he remarked  with an air of mild reproof:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand you, Miss Page. If this solemn sight has no power to stop  your coquetries, nothing can. As for your curiosity, it is both ill-timed and  unwomanly. Let me see you leave this house at once, Miss Page; and if in the  few hours which must elapse before breakfast you can find time to pack your  trunks, you will still farther oblige me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t send me away, I entreat you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a cry from her inner heart, which she probably regretted, for she instantly  sought to cover up her inadvertent self-betrayal by a submissive bend of the  head and a step backward. Neither Mr. Fenton nor Mr. Sutherland seemed to hear  the one or see the other, their attention having returned to the more serious  matter in hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  dress which our poor friend wears shows her to have been struck before  retiring,&rdquo; commented Mr. Sutherland, after another short survey of Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s  figure. &ldquo;If Philemon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, sir,&rdquo; interrupted the voice of the young man who had been left in the hall,  &ldquo;the lady is listening to what you say. She is still at the head of the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is, is she!&rdquo; cried Fenton, sharply, his admiration for the fascinating stranger  having oozed out at his companion&rsquo;s rebuff. &ldquo;I will soon show her&mdash;&rdquo; But the  words melted into thin air as he reached the door. The young girl had  disappeared, and only a faint perfume remained in the place where she had  stood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  most extraordinary person,&rdquo; grumbled the constable, turning back, but stopping  again as a faint murmur came up from below.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  gentleman is waking,&rdquo; called up a voice whose lack of music was quite  perceptible at a distance.</p>
  <p>With  a bound Mr. Fenton descended the stairs, followed by Mr. 
    Sutherland.</p>
  <p>Miss  Page stood before the door of the room in which sat Philemon Webb. As they  reached her side, she made a little bow that was half mocking, half  deprecatory, and slipped from the house. An almost unbearable sensation of  incongruity vanished with her, and Mr. Sutherland, for one, breathed like a man  relieved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish the doctor would come,&rdquo; Fenton said, as they watched the slow lifting of  Philemon Webb&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Our fastest rider has gone for him, but he&rsquo;s out  Portchester way, and it may be an hour yet before he can get here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philemon!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland had advanced and was standing by his old friend&rsquo;s side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philemon,  what has become of your guests? You&rsquo;ve waited for them here until morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old man with a dazed look surveyed the two plates set on either side of him and  shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;James  and John are getting proud,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or they forget, they forget.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>James  and John. He must mean the Zabels, yet there were many others answering to  these names in town. Mr. Sutherland made another effort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philemon,  where is your wife? I do not see any place set here for her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agatha&rsquo;s  sick, Agatha&rsquo;s cross; she don&rsquo;t care for a poor old man like me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agatha&rsquo;s  dead and you know it,&rdquo; thundered back the constable, with ill-judged severity. &ldquo;Who  killed her? tell me that. Who killed her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  sudden quenching of the last spark of intelligence in the old man&rsquo;s eye was the  dreadful effect of these words. Laughing with that strange gurgle which  proclaims an utterly irresponsible mind, he cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  pussy cat! It was the pussy cat. Who&rsquo;s killed? I&rsquo;m not killed. 
    Let&rsquo;s go to Jericho.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland took him by the arm and led him up-stairs. Perhaps the sight of his  dead wife would restore him. But he looked at her with the same indifference he  showed to everything else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like her calico dresses,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She might have worn silk, but she  wouldn&rsquo;t. Agatha, will you wear silk to my funeral?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  experiment was too painful, and they drew him away. But the constable&rsquo;s  curiosity had been roused, and after they had found some one to take care of  him, he drew Mr. Sutherland aside and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did the old man mean by saying she might have worn silk? Are they better off  than they seem?&rdquo; Mr. Sutherland closed the door before replying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are rich,&rdquo; he declared, to the utter amazement of the other. &ldquo;That is, they  were; but they may have been robbed; if so, Philemon was not the wretch who  killed her. I have been told that she kept her money in an old-fashioned  cupboard. Do you suppose they alluded to that one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  pointed to a door set in the wall over the fireplace, and Mr. Fenton,  perceiving a key sticking in the lock, stepped quickly across the floor and  opened it. A row of books met his eyes, but on taking them down a couple of  drawers were seen at the back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  they locked?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sutherland.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  is and one is not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Open  the one that is unlocked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Fenton did so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is empty,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland cast a look toward the dead woman, and again the perfect serenity of  her countenance struck him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know whether to regard her as the victim of her husband&rsquo;s imbecility or  of some vile robber&rsquo;s cupidity. Can you find the key to the other drawer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will try.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  you begin, then, by looking on her person. It should be in her pocket, if no  marauder has been here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not in her pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hanging  to her neck, then, by a string?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  there is a locket here, but no key. A very handsome locket, Mr. Sutherland, with a child&rsquo;s lock of golden hair&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind, we will see that later; it is the key we want just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heavens!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is in her hand; the one that lies underneath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  A point, Fenton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  great point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand  by her, Fenton. Don&rsquo;t let anyone rob her of that key till the coroner comes,  and we are at liberty to take it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not leave her for an instant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,  I will put back these books.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had scarcely done so when a fresh arrival occurred. This time it was one of the  village clergymen.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
    The Full Drawer</b></h2>
  <p>This  gentleman had some information to give. It seems that at an early hour of this  same night he had gone by this house on his way home from the bedside of a sick  parishioner. As he was passing the gate he was run into by a man who came  rushing out of the yard, in a state of violent agitation. In this man&rsquo;s hand  was something that glittered, and though the encounter nearly upset them both,  he had not stopped to utter an apology, but stumbled away out of sight with a  hasty but infirm step, which showed he was neither young nor active. The  minister had failed to see his face, but noticed the ends of a long beard  blowing over his shoulder as he hurried away.</p>
  <p>Philemon  was a clean-shaven man.</p>
  <p>Asked  if he could give the time of this encounter, he replied that it was not far  from midnight, as he was in his own house by half-past twelve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you glance up at these windows in passing?&rdquo; asked Mr. Fenton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must have; for I now remember they were both lighted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  the shades up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think not. I would have noticed it if they had been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  were the shades when you broke into the house this morning?&rdquo; inquired Mr.  Sutherland of the constable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  as they are now; we have moved nothing. The shades were both down&mdash;one of them  over an open window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we may find this encounter of yours with this unknown man a matter of vital importance,  Mr. Crane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I had seen his face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think the object was you saw glittering in his hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should not like to say; I saw it but an instant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  it have been a knife or an old-fashioned dagger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might have been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!  poor Agatha! That she, who so despised money, should fall a victim to man&rsquo;s  cupidity! Unhappy life, unhappy death! Fenton, I shall always mourn for Agatha  Webb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  she seems to have found peace at last,&rdquo; observed the minister. &ldquo;I have never  seen her look so contented.&rdquo; And leading Mr. Sutherland aside, he whispered: &ldquo;What  is this you say about money? Had she, in spite of appearances, any considerable  amount? I ask, because in spite of her humble home and simple manner of living,  she always put more on the plate than any of her neighbours. Besides which, I  have from time to time during my pastorate received anonymously certain  contributions, which, as they were always for sick or suffering children&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; they came from her, I have no doubt of it. She was by no means poor,  though I myself never knew the extent of her means till lately. Philemon was a  good business man once; but they evidently preferred to live simply, having no  children living&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  have lost six, I have been told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  the Portchester folks say. They probably had no heart for display or for even  the simplest luxuries. At all events, they did not indulge in them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philemon  has long been past indulging in anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he likes his comfort, and he has had it too. Agatha never stinted him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why do you think her death was due to her having money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  had a large sum in the house, and there are those in town who knew this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  is it gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  we shall know later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  the coroner arrived at this moment, the minister&rsquo;s curiosity had to wait.  Fortunately for his equanimity, no one had the presumption to ask him to leave  the room.</p>
  <p>The  coroner was a man of but few words, and but little given to emotion. 
    Yet they were surprised at his first question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is the young woman standing outside there, the only one in the yard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland, moving rapidly to the window, drew aside the shade.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is Miss Page, my housekeeper&rsquo;s niece,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I do not understand her  interest in this affair. She followed me here from the house and could hardly  be got to leave this room, into which she intruded herself against my express  command.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  look at her attitude!&rdquo; It was Mr. Fenton who spoke. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s crazier than  Philemon, it seems to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was some reason for this remark. Guarded by the high fence from the gaze of the  pushing crowd without, she stood upright and immovable in the middle of the  yard, like one on watch. The hood, which she had dropped from her head when she  thought her eyes and smile might be of use to her in the furtherance of her  plans, had been drawn over it again, so that she looked more like a statue in  grey than a living, breathing woman. Yet there was menace in her attitude and a  purpose in the solitary stand she took in that circle of board-girded grass,  which caused a thrill in the breasts of those who looked at her from that  chamber of death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  mysterious young woman,&rdquo; muttered the minister.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  one that I neither countenance nor understand,&rdquo; interpolated Mr. Sutherland. &ldquo;I  have just shown my displeasure at her actions by dismissing her from my house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner gave him a quick look, seemed about to speak, but changed his mind and  turned toward the dead woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have a sad duty before us,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>The  investigations which followed elicited one or two new facts. First, that all  the doors of the house were found unlocked; and, secondly, that the constable  had been among the first to enter, so that he could vouch that no  disarrangement had been made in the rooms, with the exception of Batsy&rsquo;s  removal to the bed.</p>
  <p>Then,  his attention being drawn to the dead woman, he discovered the key in her  tightly closed hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  does this key belong?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>They  showed him the drawers in the cupboard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  is empty,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Sutherland. &ldquo;If the other is found to be in the same  condition, then her money has been taken. That key she holds should open both  these drawers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let it be made use of at once. It is important that we should know whether  theft has been committed here as well as murder.&rdquo; And drawing the key out, he  handed it to Mr. Fenton.</p>
  <p>The  constable immediately unlocked the drawer and brought it and its contents to  the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  money here,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  papers as good as money,&rdquo; announced the doctor. &ldquo;See! here are deeds and more  than one valuable bond. I judge she was a richer woman than any of us knew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland, meantime, was looking with an air of disappointment into the now  empty drawer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  as I feared,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She has been robbed of her ready money. It was  doubtless in the other drawer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  came she by the key, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is one of the mysteries of the affair; this murder is by no means a simple one.  I begin to think we shall find it full of mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Batsy&rsquo;s  death, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  yes, Batsy! I forgot that she was found dead too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  a wound, doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  had heart disease. I doctored her for it. The fright has killed her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  look of her face confirms that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me see! So it does; but we must have an autopsy to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would like to explain before any further measures are taken, how I came to know  that Agatha Webb had money in her house,&rdquo; said Mr. Sutherland, as they stepped  back into the other room. &ldquo;Two days ago, as I was sitting with my family at  table, old gossip Judy came in. Had Mrs. Sutherland been living, this old crone  would not have presumed to intrude upon us at mealtime, but as we have no one  now to uphold our dignity, this woman rushed into our presence panting with  news, and told us all in one breath how she had just come from Mrs. Webb; that  Mrs. Webb had money; that she had seen it, she herself; that, going into the  house as usual without knocking, she had heard Agatha stepping overhead and had  gone up; and finding the door of the sitting-room ajar, had looked in, and seen  Agatha crossing the room with her hands full of bills; that these bills were  big bills, for she heard Agatha cry, as she locked them up in the cupboard  behind the book-shelves, &lsquo;A thousand dollars! That is too much money to have in  one&rsquo;s house&rsquo;; that she, Judy, thought so too, and being frightened at what she  had seen, had crept away as silently as she had entered and run away to tell  the neighbours. Happily, I was the first she found up that morning, but I have  no doubt that, in spite of my express injunctions, she has since related the  news to half the people in town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the young woman down yonder present when Judy told this story?&rdquo; asked the  coroner, pointing towards the yard.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland pondered. &ldquo;Possibly; I do not remember. Frederick was seated at the  table with me, and my housekeeper was pouring out the coffee, but it was early  for Miss Page. She has been putting on great airs of late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  it be possible he is trying to blind himself to the fact that his son Frederick  wishes to marry this girl?&rdquo; muttered the clergyman into the constable&rsquo;s ear.</p>
  <p>The  constable shook his head. Mr. Sutherland was one of those <i>debonair</i> men, whose very mildness makes them impenetrable.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    A Spot On The Lawn</b></h2>
  <p>The  coroner, on leaving the house, was followed by Mr. Sutherland. As the fine  figures of the two men appeared on the doorstep, a faint cheer was heard from  the two or three favoured persons who were allowed to look through the gate.  But to this token of welcome neither gentleman responded by so much as a look,  all their attention being engrossed by the sight of the solitary figure of Miss  Page, who still held her stand upon the lawn. Motionless as a statue, but with  her eyes fixed upon their faces, she awaited their approach. When they were  near her she thrust one hand from under her cloak, and pointing to the grass at  her feet, said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  hastened towards her and bent down to examine the spot she indicated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you find there?&rdquo; cried Mr. Sutherland, whose eyesight was not good.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blood,&rdquo;  responded the coroner, plucking up a blade of grass and surveying it closely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blood,&rdquo;  echoed Miss Page, with so suggestive a glance that Mr. Sutherland stared at her  in amazement, not understanding his own emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  were you able to discern a stain so nearly imperceptible?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Imperceptible?  It is the only thing I see in the whole yard,&rdquo; she retorted, and with a slight  bow, which was not without its element of mockery, she turned toward the gate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  most unaccountable girl,&rdquo; commented the doctor. &ldquo;But she is right about these  stains. Abel,&rdquo; he called to the man at the gate, &ldquo;bring a box or barrel here  and cover up this spot. I don&rsquo;t want it disturbed by trampling feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Abel  started to obey, just as the young girl laid her hand on the gate to open it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  you help me?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;The crowd is so great they won&rsquo;t let me through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  they?&rdquo; The words came from without. &ldquo;Just slip out as I slip in, and you&rsquo;ll  find a place made for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Not  recognising the voice, she hesitated for a moment, but seeing the gate swaying,  she pushed against it just as a young man stepped through the gap. Necessarily  they came face to face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; he muttered, giving her a sharp glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know you,&rdquo; she haughtily declared, and slipped by him with such  dexterity she was out of the gate before he could respond.</p>
  <p>But  he only snapped his finger and thumb mockingly at her, and smiled knowingly at  Abel, who had lingered to watch the end of this encounter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Supple  as a willow twig, eh?&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Well, I have made whistles out of willows  before now, and hallo! where did you get that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was pointing to a rare flower that hung limp and faded from Abel&rsquo;s buttonhole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This?  Oh, I found it in the house yonder. It was lying on the floor of the inner  room, almost under Batsy&rsquo;s skirts. Curious sort of flower. I wonder where she  got it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  intruder betrayed at once an unaccountable emotion. There was a strange glitter  in his light green eyes that made Abel shift rather uneasily on his feet. &ldquo;Was  that before this pretty minx you have just let out came in here with Mr.  Sutherland?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  yes; before anyone had started for the hill at all. Why, what has this young  lady got to do with a flower dropped by Batsy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She?  Nothing. Only&mdash;and I have never given you bad advice, Abel&mdash;don&rsquo;t let that thing  hang any longer from your buttonhole. Put it into an envelope and keep it, and  if you don&rsquo;t hear from me again in regard to it, write me out a fool and forget  we were ever chums when little shavers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man called Abel smiled, took out the flower, and went to cover up the grass as  Dr. Talbot had requested. The stranger took his place at the gate, toward which  the coroner and Mr. Sutherland were now advancing, with an air that showed his  great anxiety to speak with them. He was the musician whom we saw secretly  entering the last-mentioned gentleman&rsquo;s house after the departure of the  servants.</p>
  <p>As  the coroner paused before him he spoke. &ldquo;Dr. Talbot,&rdquo; said he, dropping his  eyes, which were apt to betray his thoughts too plainly, &ldquo;you have often  promised that you would give me a job if any matter came up where any nice  detective work was wanted. Don&rsquo;t you think the time has come to remember me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,  Sweetwater? I&rsquo;m afraid the affair is too deep for an inexperienced man&rsquo;s first  effort. I shall have to send to Boston for an expert. Another time, Sweetwater,  when the complications are less serious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young fellow, with a face white as milk, was turning away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you&rsquo;ll let me stay around here?&rdquo; he pleaded, pausing and giving the other an  imploring look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  yes,&rdquo; answered the good-natured coroner. &ldquo;Fenton will have work enough for you  and half a dozen others. Go and tell him I sent you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; returned the other, his face suddenly losing its aspect of acute  disappointment. &ldquo;Now I shall see where that flower fell,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  &ldquo;Breakfast Is Served, Gentlemen!&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland returned home. As he entered the broad hall he met his son,  Frederick. There was a look on the young man&rsquo;s face such as he had not seen  there in years.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo;  faltered the youth, &ldquo;may I have a few words with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  father nodded kindly, though it is likely he would have much preferred his  breakfast; and the young man led him into a little sitting-room littered with  the faded garlands and other tokens of the preceding night&rsquo;s festivities.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have an apology to make,&rdquo; Frederick began, &ldquo;or rather, I have your forgiveness  to ask. For years&rdquo; he went on, stumbling over his words, though he gave no  evidence of a wish to restrain them&mdash;&ldquo;for years I have gone contrariwise to your  wishes and caused my mother&rsquo;s heart to ache and you to wish I had never been  born to be a curse to you and her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had emphasised the word mother, and spoke altogether with force and deep  intensity. Mr. Sutherland stood petrified; he had long ago given up this lad as  lost.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  wish to change. I wish to be as great a pride to you as I have been a shame and  a dishonour. I may not succeed at once; but I am in earnest, and if you will  give me your hand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old man&rsquo;s arms were round the young man&rsquo;s shoulders at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frederick!&rdquo;  he cried, &ldquo;my Frederick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not make me too much ashamed,&rdquo; murmured the youth, very pale and strangely  discomposed. &ldquo;With no excuse for my past, I suffer intolerable apprehension in  regard to my future, lest my good intentions should fail or my self-control not  hold out. But the knowledge that you are acquainted with my resolve, and regard  it with an undeserved sympathy, may suffice to sustain me, and I should  certainly be a base poltroon if I should disappoint you or her twice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused, drew himself from his father&rsquo;s arms, and glanced almost solemnly out of  the window. &ldquo;I swear that I will henceforth act as if she were still alive and  watching me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was strange intensity in his manner. Mr. Sutherland regarded him with  amazement. He had seen him in every mood natural to a reckless man, but never  in so serious a one, never with a look of awe or purpose in his face. It gave  him quite a new idea of Frederick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  the young man went on, raising his right hand, but not removing his eyes from  the distant prospect on which they were fixed, &ldquo;I swear that I will henceforth  do nothing to discredit her memory. Outwardly and inwardly, I will act as  though her eye were still upon me and she could again suffer grief at my  failures or thrill with pleasure at my success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  portrait of Mrs. Sutherland, painted when Frederick was a lad of ten, hung  within a few feet of him as he spoke. He did not glance at it, but Mr.  Sutherland did, and with a look as if he expected to behold a responsive light  beam from those pathetic features.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  loved you very dearly,&rdquo; was his slow and earnest comment. &ldquo;We have both loved  you much more deeply than you have ever seemed to realise, Frederick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe it,&rdquo; responded the young man, turning with an expression of calm  resolve to meet his father&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;As proof that I am no longer insensible to  your affection, I have made up my mind to forego for your sake one of the  dearest wishes of my heart. Father&rdquo; he hesitated before he spoke the word, but  he spoke it firmly at last,&mdash;&ldquo;am I right in thinking you would not like Miss  Page for a daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  my housekeeper&rsquo;s niece to take the place in this house once occupied by  Marietta Sutherland? Frederick, I have always thought too well of you to  believe you would carry your forgetfulness of me so far as that, even when I  saw that you were influenced by her attractions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did not do justice to my selfishness, father. I did mean to marry her, but I  have given up living solely for myself, and she could never help me to live for  others. Father, Amabel Page must not remain in this house to cause division  between you and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have already intimated to her the desirability of her quitting a home where she  is no longer respected,&rdquo; the old gentleman declared. &ldquo;She leaves on the 10.45  train. Her conduct this morning at the house of Mrs. Webb&mdash;who perhaps you do  not know was most cruelly and foully murdered last night&mdash;was such as to cause  comment and make her an undesirable adjunct to any gentleman&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  paled. Something in these words had caused him a great shock. Mr. Sutherland  was fond enough to believe that it was the news of this extraordinary woman&rsquo;s  death. But his son&rsquo;s words, as soon as he could find any, showed that his mind was  running on Amabel, whom he perhaps had found it difficult to connect even in  the remotest way with crime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  at this place of death? How could that be? Who would take a young girl there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  father, experiencing, perhaps, more compassion for this soon-to-be-disillusioned  lover than he thought it incumbent upon him to show, answered shortly, but  without any compromise of the unhappy truth:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  went; she was not taken. No one, not even myself, could keep her back after she  had heard that a murder had been committed in the town. She even intruded into  the house; and when ordered out of the room of death took up her stand in the  yard in front, where she remained until she had the opportunity of pointing out  to us a stain of blood on the grass, which might otherwise have escaped our  attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;  Frederick&rsquo;s eye was staring; he looked like a man struck dumb by surprise or  fear. &ldquo;Amabel do this? You are mocking me, sir, or I may be dreaming, which may  the good God grant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  father, who had not looked for so much emotion, eyed his son in surprise, which  rapidly changed to alarm as the young man faltered and fell back against the  wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are ill, Frederick; you are really ill. Let me call down Mrs. 
    Harcourt. But no, I cannot summon her. She is this girl&rsquo;s aunt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  made an effort and stood up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not call anybody,&rdquo; he entreated. &ldquo;I expect to suffer some in casting this  fascinating girl out of my heart. Ultimately I will conquer the weakness;  indeed I will. As for her interest in Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s death&rdquo;&mdash;how low his voice sank  and how he trembled! &ldquo;she may have been better friends with her than we had any  reason to suppose. I can think of no other motive for her conduct. Admiration  for Mrs. Webb and horror&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Breakfast  is served, gentlemen!&rdquo; cried a thrilling voice behind them. 
    Amabel Page stood smiling in the doorway.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  &ldquo;Marry Me&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, I must speak to you.&rdquo; It was Amabel who was holding Frederick back.  She had caught him by the arm as he was about leaving the room with his father,  and he felt himself obliged to stop and listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  start for Springfield to-day,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I have another relative there  living at the house. When shall I have the pleasure of seeing you in my new  home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;  It was said regretfully, and yet with a certain brusqueness, occasioned perhaps  by over-excited feeling. &ldquo;Hard as it is for me to say it, Amabel, it is but  just for me to tell you that after our parting here to-day we will meet only as  strangers. Friendship between us would be mockery, and any closer relationship  has become impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  had cost him an immense effort to say these words, and he expected, fondly  expected, I must admit, to see her colour change and her head droop. But  instead of this she looked at him steadily for a moment, then slipped her hand  down his arm till she reached his palm, which she pressed with sudden warmth,  drawing him into the room as she did so, and shutting the door behind them. He  was speechless, for she never had looked so handsome or so glowing. Instead of  showing depression or humiliation even, she confronted him with a smile more  dangerous than any display of grief, for it contained what it had hitherto  lacked, positive and irresistible admiration. Her words were equally dangerous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  kiss your hand, as the Spaniards say.&rdquo; And she almost did so, with a bend of  her head, which just allowed him to catch a glimpse of two startling dimples.</p>
  <p>He  was astounded. He thought he knew this woman well, but at this moment she was  as incomprehensible to him as if he had never made a study of her caprices and  sought an explanation for her ever-shifting expressions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sensible of the honour,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but hardly understand how I have earned  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still  that incomprehensible look of admiration continued to illumine her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know I could ever think so well of you,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;If you do not  take care, I shall end by loving you some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  he ejaculated, his face contracting with sudden pain; &ldquo;your love, then, is but  a potentiality. Very well, Amabel, keep it so and you will be spared much  misery. As for me, who have not been as wise as you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frederick!&rdquo;  She had come so near he did not have the strength to finish. Her face, with its  indefinable charm, was raised to his, as she dropped these words one by one  from her lips in lingering cadence: &ldquo;Frederick&mdash;do you love me, then, so very  much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was angry; possibly because he felt his resolution failing him. &ldquo;You know!&rdquo; he  hotly began, stepping back. Then with a sudden burst of feeling, that was  almost like prayer, he resumed: &ldquo;Do not tempt me, Amabel. I have trouble  enough, without lamenting the failure of my first steadfast purpose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  she said, stopping where she was, but drawing him toward her by every witchery  of which her mobile features were capable; &ldquo;your generous impulse has  strengthened into a purpose, has it? Well, I&rsquo;m not worth it, Frederick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>More  and more astounded, understanding her less than ever, but charmed by looks that  would have moved an anchorite, he turned his head away in a vain attempt to  escape an influence that was so rapidly undermining his determination.</p>
  <p>She  saw the movement, recognised the weakness it bespoke, and in the triumph of her  heart allowed a low laugh to escape her.</p>
  <p>Her  voice, as I have before said, was unmusical though effective; but her laugh was  deliciously sweet, especially when it was restrained to a mere ripple, as now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will come to Springfield soon,&rdquo; she avowed, slipping from before him so as to  leave the way to the door open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amabel!&rdquo;  His voice was strangely husky, and the involuntary opening and shutting of his  hands revealed the emotion under which he was labouring. &ldquo;Do you love me? You  have acknowledged it now and then, but always as if you did not mean it. Now  you acknowledge that you may some day, and this time as if you did mean it.  What is the truth? Tell me, without coquetry or dissembling, for I am in dead  earnest, and&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, choked, and turned toward the window where but a few  minutes before he had taken that solemn oath. The remembrance of it seemed to  come back with the movement. Flushing with a new agitation, he wheeled upon her  sharply. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he prayed, &ldquo;say nothing. If you swore you did not love me I  should not believe it, and if you swore that you did I should only find it harder  to repeat what must again be said, that a union between us can never take  place. I have given my solemn promise to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well. Why do you stop? Am I so hard to talk to that the words will not leave  your lips?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have promised my father I will never marry you. He feels that he has grounds of  complaint against you, and as I owe him everything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stopped amazed. She was looking at him intently, that same low laugh still on  her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  the truth,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I know to what extent you consider your father&rsquo;s  wishes. You think you ought not to marry me after what took place last night.  Frederick, I like you for this evidence of consideration on your part, but do  not struggle too relentlessly with your conscience. I can forgive much more in  you than you think, and if you really love me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop!  Let us understand each other.&rdquo; He had turned mortally pale, and met her eyes  with something akin to alarm. &ldquo;What do you allude to in speaking of last night?  I did not know there was anything said by us in our talk together&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not allude to our talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or&mdash;or  in the one dance we had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frederick,  a dance is innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  word seemed to strike him with the force of a blow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Innocent,&rdquo;  he repeated, &ldquo;innocent?&rdquo; becoming paler still as the full weight of her meaning  broke gradually upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  followed you into town,&rdquo; she whispered, coming closer, and breathing the words  into his ear. &ldquo;But what I saw you do there will not prevent me from obeying you  if you say: &lsquo;Follow me wherever I go, Amabel; henceforth our lives are one.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was all he said, but it seemed to create a gulf between them. In the silence  that followed, the evil spirit latent beneath her beauty began to make itself  evident even in the smile which no longer called into view the dimples which  belong to guileless mirth, while upon his face, after the first paralysing  effect of her words had passed, there appeared an expression of manly  resistance that betrayed a virtue which as yet had never appeared in his  selfish and altogether reckless life.</p>
  <p>That  this was more than a passing impulse he presently made evident by lifting his  hand and pushing her slowly back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know what you saw me do,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but whatever it was, it can make no  difference in our relations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  whisper, which had been but a breath before, became scarcely audible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not pause at the gate you entered,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I went in after you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  gasp of irresistible feeling escaped him, but he did not take his eyes from her  face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a long time before you came out,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;but previous to that time  the shade of a certain window was thrust aside, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  he commanded, in uncontrollable passion, pressing his hand with impulsive  energy against her mouth. &ldquo;Not another word of that, or I shall forget you are  a woman or that I have ever loved you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  eyes, which were all she had remaining to plead with, took on a peculiar look  of quiet satisfaction, and power. Seeing it, he let his hand fall and for the  first time began to regard her with anything but a lover&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was the only person in sight at that time,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You have nothing to  fear from the world at large.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  word made its own echo; she had no need to emphasise it even by a smile. But  she watched him as it sunk into his consciousness with an intentness it took  all his strength to sustain. Suddenly her bearing and expression changed. The  few remains of sweetness in her face vanished, and even the allurement which  often lasts when the sweetness is gone, disappeared in the energy which now  took possession of her whole threatening and inflexible personality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marry  me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;or I will proclaim you to be the murderer of 
    Agatha Webb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  had seen the death of love in his eyes.</p>

  &ldquo;A Devil That Understands Men&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Frederick  Sutherland was a man of finer mental balance than he himself, perhaps, had ever  realised. After the first few moments of stupefaction following the astounding  alternative which had been given him, he broke out with the last sentence she  probably expected to hear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you hope from a marriage with me, that to attain your wishes you thus  sacrifice every womanly instinct?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  met him on his own ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do I hope?&rdquo; She actually glowed with the force of her secret desire. &ldquo;Can you  ask a poor girl like me, born in a tenement house, but with tastes and  ambitions such as are usually only given to those who can gratify them? I want  to be the rich Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s daughter; acknowledged or unacknowledged, the  wife of one who can enter any house in Boston as an equal. With a position like  that I can rise to anything. I feel that I have the natural power and aptitude.  I have felt it since I was a small child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  for that&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  for that,&rdquo; she broke in, &ldquo;I am quite willing to overlook a blot on your record.  Confident that you will never repeat the risk of last night, I am ready to  share the burden of your secret through life. If you treat me well, I am sure I  can make that burden light for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a quick flush and an increase of self-assertion, probably not anticipated by  her, he faced the daring girl with a desperate resolution that showed how  handsome he could be if his soul once got control of his body.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo;  he cried, &ldquo;they were right; you are little less than a devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Did  she regard it as a compliment? Her smile would seem to say so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  devil that understands men,&rdquo; she answered, with that slow dip of her dimples  that made her smile so dangerous. &ldquo;You will not hesitate long over this matter;  a week, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not hesitate at all. Seeing you as you are, makes my course easy. You  will never share any burden with me as my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still  she was not abashed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a pity,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;it would have saved you such unnecessary struggle.  But a week is not long to wait. I am certain of you then. This day week at  twelve o&rsquo;clock, Frederick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  seized her by the arm, and lost to everything but his rage, shook her with a  desperate hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean it?&rdquo; he cried, a sudden horror showing itself in his face,  notwithstanding his efforts to conceal it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean it so much,&rdquo; she assured him, &ldquo;that before I came home just now I paid a  visit to the copse over the way. A certain hollow tree, where you and I have  held more than one tryst, conceals within its depths a package containing over  one thousand dollars. Frederick, I hold your life in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  grasp with which he held her relaxed; a mortal despair settled upon his  features, and recognising the impossibility of further concealing the effect of  her words upon him, he sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands.  She viewed him with an air of triumph, which brought back some of her beauty.  When she spoke it was to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you wish to join me in Springfield before the time I have set, well and good. I  am willing that the time of our separation should be shortened, but it must not  be lengthened by so much as a day. Now, if you will excuse me, I will go and  pack my trunks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  shuddered; her voice penetrated him to the quick.</p>
  <p>Drawing  herself up, she looked down on him with a strange mixture of passion and  elation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  need fear no indiscretion on my part, so long as our armistice lasts,&rdquo; said  she. &ldquo;No one can drag the truth from me while any hope remains of your doing  your duty by me in the way I have suggested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  still he did not move.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frederick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  it her voice that was thus murmuring his name? Can the tiger snarl one moment  and fawn the next?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frederick,  I have a final word to say&mdash;a last farewell. Up to this hour I have endured your  attentions, or, let us say, accepted them, for I always found you handsome and  agreeable, if not the master of my heart. But now it is love that I feel, love;  and love with me is no fancy, but a passion&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;a passion which will  make life a heaven or hell for the man who has inspired it. You should have  thought of this when you opposed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with a look in which love and hatred contended for mastery, she bent and  imprinted a kiss upon his forehead. Next moment she was gone.</p>
  <p>Or  so he thought. But when, after an interval of nameless recoil, he rose and  attempted to stagger from the place, he discovered that she had been detained  in the hall by two or three men who had just come in by the front door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this Miss Page?&rdquo; they were asking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I am Miss Page&mdash;Amabel Page&rdquo; she replied with suave politeness. &ldquo;If you have any  business with me, state it quickly, for I am about to leave town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what we wish to prevent,&rdquo; declared a tall, thin young man who seemed to take  the lead. &ldquo;Till the inquest has been held over the remains of Mrs. Webb,  Coroner Talbot wishes you to regard yourself as a possible witness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;  she cried, with an admirable gesture of surprise and a wide opening of her  brown eyes that made her look like an astonished child. &ldquo;What have I got to do  with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  pointed out a certain spot of blood on the grass, and&mdash;well, the coroner&rsquo;s  orders have to be obeyed, miss. You cannot leave the town without running the  risk of arrest&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I will stay in it,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;I have no liking for arrests,&rdquo; and the glint  of her eye rested for a moment on Frederick. &ldquo;Mr. Sutherland,&rdquo; she continued,  as that gentleman appeared at the dining-room door, &ldquo;I shall have to impose  upon your hospitality for a few days longer. These men here inform me that my  innocent interest in pointing out to you that spot of blood on Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s lawn  has awakened some curiosity, and that I am wanted as a witness by the coroner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland, with a quick stride, lessened the distance between himself and  these unwelcome intruders. &ldquo;The coroner&rsquo;s wishes are paramount just now,&rdquo; said  he, but the look he gave his son was not soon forgotten by the spectators.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    A Grand Woman</b></h2>
  <p>There  was but one topic discussed in the country-side that day, and that was the life  and character of Agatha Webb.</p>
  <p>Her  history had not been a happy one. She and Philemon had come from Portchester  some twenty or more years before to escape the sorrows associated with their  native town. They had left behind them six small graves in Portchester  churchyard; but though evidences of their affliction were always to be seen in  the countenances of either, they had entered with so much purpose into the life  of their adopted town that they had become persons of note there till Philemon&rsquo;s  health began to fail, when Agatha quit all outside work and devoted herself  exclusively to him. Of her character and winsome personality we can gather some  idea from the various conversations carried on that day from Portchester Green  to the shipyards in Sutherlandtown.</p>
  <p>In  Deacon Brainerd&rsquo;s cottage, the discussion was concerning Agatha&rsquo;s lack of  vanity; a virtue not very common at that time among the women of this busy  seaport.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  a woman so handsome,&rdquo; the good deacon was saying &ldquo;(and I think I can safely  call her the finest-featured woman who ever trod these streets), she showed as  little interest in dress as anyone I ever knew. Calico at home and calico at  church, yet she looked as much of a lady in her dark-sprigged gowns as Mrs.  Webster in her silks or Mrs. Parsons in her thousand-dollar sealskin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  this was a topic within the scope of his eldest daughter&rsquo;s intelligence she at  once spoke up: &ldquo;I never thought she needed to dress so plainly. I don&rsquo;t believe  in such a show of poverty myself. If one is too poor to go decent, all right;  but they say she had more money than most anyone in town. I wonder who is going  to get the benefit of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  Philemon, of course; that is, as long as he lives. He doubtless had the making  of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it true that he&rsquo;s gone clean out of his head since her death?&rdquo; interposed a neighbour  who had happened in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  they say. I believe widow Jones has taken him into her house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think,&rdquo; asked a second daughter with becoming hesitation, &ldquo;that he had  anything to do with her death? Some of the neighbours say he struck her while  in one of his crazy fits, while others declare she was killed by some stranger,  equally old and almost as infirm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  won&rsquo;t discuss the subject,&rdquo; objected the deacon. &ldquo;Time will show who robbed us  of the greatest-hearted and most capable woman in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  will time show who killed Batsy?&rdquo; It was a morsel of a girl who spoke; the  least one of the family, but the brightest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for Batsy; she always  gave me cookies when I went to see Mrs. Webb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Batsy  was a good girl for a Swede,&rdquo; allowed the deacon&rsquo;s wife, who had not spoken  till now. &ldquo;When she first came into town on the spars of that wrecked ship we  all remember, there was some struggle between Agatha and me as to which of us  should have her. But I didn&rsquo;t like the task of teaching her the name of every  pot and pan she had to use in the kitchen, so I gave her up to Agatha; and it  was fortunate I did, for I&rsquo;ve never been able to understand her talk to this  day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could talk with her right well,&rdquo; lisped the little one. &ldquo;She never called  things by their Swedish names unless she was worried; and I never worried her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder if she would have worshipped the ground under your feet, as she did that  under Agatha&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked the deacon, eying his wife with just the suspicion of a  malicious twinkle in his eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not the greatest-hearted and most capable woman in town,&rdquo; retorted his wife,  clicking her needles as she went on knitting.</p>
  <p>In  Mr. Sprague&rsquo;s house on the opposite side of the road, Squire Fisher was  relating some old tales of bygone Portchester days. &ldquo;I knew Agatha when she was  a girl,&rdquo; he avowed. &ldquo;She had the grandest manners and the most enchanting smile  of any rich or poor man&rsquo;s daughter between the coast and Springfield. She did  not dress in calico then. She wore the gayest clothes her father could buy her, and old Jacob was not without means to make his daughter the leading  figure in town. How we young fellows did adore her, and what lengths we went to  win one of her glorious smiles! Two of us, John and James Zabel, have lived  bachelors for her sake to this very day; but I hadn&rsquo;t courage enough for that;  I married and&rdquo;&mdash;something between a sigh and a chuckle filled out the sentence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  made Philemon carry off the prize? His good looks?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  or his good luck. It wasn&rsquo;t his snap; of that you may be sure. James Zabel had  the snap, and he was her first choice, too, but he got into some difficulty&mdash;I  never knew just what it was, but it was regarded as serious at the time&mdash;and  that match was broken off. Afterwards she married Philemon. You see, I was out  of it altogether; had never been in it, perhaps; but there were three good  years of my life in which I thought of little else than Agatha. I admired her  spirit, you see. There was something more taking in her ways than in her  beauty, wonderful as that was. She ruled us with a rod of iron, and yet we  worshipped her. I have wondered to see her so meek of late. I never thought she  would be satisfied with a brick-floored cottage and a husband of failing wits.  But no one, to my knowledge, has ever heard a complaint from her lips; and the  dignity of her afflicted wife-hood has far transcended the haughtiness of those  days when she had but to smile to have all the youth of Portchester at her  feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose it was the loss of so many children that reconciled her to a quiet  life. A woman cannot close the eyes of six children, one after the other,  without some modification taking place in her character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she and Philemon have been unfortunate; but she was a splendid looking girl,  boys. I never see such grand-looking women now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  a little one-storied cottage on the hillside a woman was nursing a baby and  talking at the same time of Agatha Webb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall never forget the night my first baby fell sick,&rdquo; she faltered; &ldquo;I was  just out of bed myself, and having no nearer neighbours then than now, I was  all alone on the hillside, Alec being away at sea. I was too young to know much  about sickness, but something told me that I must have help before morning or  my baby would die. Though I could just walk across the floor, I threw a shawl  around me, took my baby in my arms, and opened the door. A blinding gust of  rain blew in. A terrible storm was raging and I had not noticed it, I was so  taken up with the child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could not face that gale. Indeed, I was so weak I fell on my knees as it struck  me and became dripping wet before I could drag myself inside. The baby began to  moan and everything was turning dark before me, when I heard a strong, sweet  voice cry out in the roadway:</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Is  there room in this house for me till the storm has blown by? I cannot see my  way down the hillside.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  a bursting heart I looked up. A woman was standing in the doorway, with the  look of an angel in her eyes. I did not know her, but her face was one to bring  comfort to the saddest heart. Holding up my baby, I cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;My  baby is dying; I tried to go for the doctor, but my knees bent under me. Help  me, as you are a mother&mdash;I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must have fallen again, for the next thing I remember I was lying by the  hearth, looking up into her face, which was bending over me. She was white as  the rag I had tied about my baby&rsquo;s throat, and by the way her breast heaved she  was either very much frightened or very sorry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  wish you had the help of anyone else,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;Babies perish in my arms and  wither at my breast. I cannot touch it, much as I yearn to. But let me see its  face; perhaps I can tell you what is the matter with it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  showed her the baby&rsquo;s face, and she bent over it, trembling very much, almost  as much indeed as myself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It  is very sick,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but if you will use the remedies I advise, I think  you can save it.&rsquo; And she told me what to do, and helped me all she could; but  she did not lay a finger on the little darling, though from the way she watched  it I saw that her heart was set on his getting better. And he did; in an hour  he was sleeping peacefully, and the terrible weight was gone from my heart and  from hers. When the storm stopped, and she could leave the house, she gave me a  kiss; but the look she gave him meant more than kisses. God must have forgotten  her goodness to me that night when He let her die so pitiable a death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  the minister&rsquo;s house they were commenting upon the look of serenity observable  in her dead face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have known her for thirty years,&rdquo; her pastor declared, &ldquo;and never before have I  seen her wear a look of real peace. It is wonderful, considering the  circumstances. Do you think she was so weary of her life&rsquo;s long struggle that  she hailed any release from it, even that of violence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  young man, a lawyer, visiting them from New York, was the only one to answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never saw the woman you are talking about,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and know nothing of the  circumstances of her death beyond what you have told me. But from the very  incongruity between her expression and the violent nature of her death, I argue  that there are depths to this crime which have not yet been sounded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  depths? It is a simple case of murder followed by theft. To be sure we do not  yet know the criminal, but money was his motive; that is clear enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you ready to wager that that is all there is to it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was a startling proposition to the minister.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget my cloth,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>The  young man smiled. &ldquo;That is true. Pardon me. I was only anxious to show how  strong my conviction was against any such easy explanation of a crime marked by  such contradictory features.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Two  children on the Portchester road were exchanging boyish confidences.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know what I think about it?&rdquo; asked one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw!  How should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wall,  I think old Mrs. Webb got the likes of what she sent. Don&rsquo;t you know she had  six children once, and that she killed every one of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Killed &rsquo;em&mdash;she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I heard her tell granny once all about it. She said there was a blight on her  house&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what that is; but I guess it&rsquo;s something big and heavy&mdash;and  that it fell on every one of her children, as fast as they came, and killed &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;m glad I ben&rsquo;t her child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Very  different were the recollections interchanged between two middle-aged  Portchester women.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was drinking tea at my house when her sister Sairey came running in with the  news that the baby she had left at home wasn&rsquo;t quite right. That was her first  child, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, for I was with her when that baby came,&rdquo; broke in the other, &ldquo;and such joy  as she showed when they told her it was alive and well I never saw. I do not  know why she didn&rsquo;t expect it to be alive, but she didn&rsquo;t, and her happiness  was just wonderful to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she didn&rsquo;t enjoy it long. The poor little fellow died young. But I was telling  you of the night when she first heard he was ailing. Philemon had been telling  a good story, and we were all laughing, when Sairey came in. I can see Agatha  now. She always had the most brilliant eyes in the county, but that day they  were superbly dazzling. They changed, though, at the sight of Sairey&rsquo;s face,  and she jumped to meet her just as if she knew what Sairey was going to say  before ever a word left her lips. &lsquo;My baby!&rsquo; (I can hear her yet.) &lsquo;Something  is the matter with the baby!&rsquo; And though Sairey made haste to tell her that he  was only ailing and not at all ill, she turned upon Philemon with a look none  of us ever quite understood; he changed so completely under it, just as she had  under Sairey&rsquo;s; and to neither did the old happiness ever return, for the child  died within a week, and when the next came it died also, and the next, till six  small innocents lay buried in yonder old graveyard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know; and sad enough it was too, especially as she and Philemon were both fond  of children. Well, well, the ways of Providence are past finding out! And now  she is gone and Philemon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  he&rsquo;ll follow her soon; he can&rsquo;t live without Agatha.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nearer  home, the old sexton was chattering about the six gravestones raised in  Portchester churchyard to these six dead infants. He had been sent there to  choose a spot in which to lay the mother, and was full of the shock it gave him  to see that line of little stones, telling of a past with which the good people  of Sutherlandtown found it hard to associate Philemon and Agatha Webb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  a digger of graves,&rdquo; he mused, half to himself and half to his old wife  watching him from the other side of the hearthstone. &ldquo;I spend a good quarter of  my time in the churchyard; but when I saw those six little mounds, and read the  inscriptions over them, I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling queer. Think of this! On the  first tiny headstone I read these words:&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700521h-images/page059.png" width="800" height="401"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  what does that mean? Did you ever hear anyone say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  was his old wife&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;Perhaps she was one of those Calvinist folks who  believe babies go to hell if they are not baptised.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  her children were all baptised. I&rsquo;ve been told so; some of them before she was  well out of her bed. &lsquo;God be merciful to me a sinner!&rsquo; And the chick not six  weeks old! Something queer about that, dame, if it did happen more than thirty  years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you see over the grave of the child who was killed in her arms by  lightning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And  he was not, for God took him.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>Farmer  Waite had but one word to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  came to me when my Sissy had the smallpox; the only person in town who would  enter my doors. More than that; when Sissy was up and I went to pay the doctor&rsquo;s  bill I found it had been settled. I did not know then who had enough money and  compassion to do this for me; now I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Many  an act of kindness which had been secretly performed in that town during the  last twenty years came to light on that day, the most notable of which was the  sending of a certain young lad to school and his subsequent education as a  minister.</p>
  <p>But  other memories of a sweeter and more secret nature still came up likewise,  among them the following:</p>
  <p>A  young girl, who was of a very timid but deeply sensitive nature, had been urged  into an engagement with a man she did not like. Though the conflict this  occasioned her and the misery which accompanied it were apparent to everybody,  nobody stirred in her behalf but Agatha. She went to see her, and, though it  was within a fortnight of the wedding, she did not hesitate to advise the girl  to give him up, and when the poor child said she lacked the courage, Agatha  herself went to the man and urged him into a display of generosity which saved  the poor, timid thing from a life of misery. They say this was no easy task for  Agatha, and that the man was sullen for a year. But the girl&rsquo;s gratitude was  boundless.</p>
  <p>Of  her daring, which was always on the side of right and justice, the stories were  numerous; so were the accounts, mostly among the women, of her rare tenderness  and sympathy for the weak and the erring. Never was a man talked to as she  talked to Jake Cobleigh the evening after he struck his mother, and if she had  been in town on the day when Clarissa Mayhew ran away with that Philadelphia  adventurer many said it would never have happened, for no girl could stand the  admonition, or resist the pleading, of this childless mother.</p>
  <p>It  was reserved for Mr. Halliday and Mr. Sutherland to talk of her mental  qualities. Her character was so marked and her manner so simple that few gave  attention to the intellect that was the real basis of her power. The two  mentioned gentlemen, however, appreciated her to the full, and it was while  listening to their remarks that Frederick was suddenly startled by some one  saying to him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are the only person in town who have nothing to say about Agatha Webb. Didn&rsquo;t  you ever exchange any words with her?&mdash;for I can hardly believe you could have  met her eye to eye without having some remark to make about her beauty or her  influence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  speaker was Agnes Halliday, who had come in with her father for a social chat.  She was one of Frederick&rsquo;s earliest playmates, but one with whom he had never  assimilated and who did not like him. He knew this, as did everyone else in  town, and it was with some hesitation he turned to answer her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have but one recollection,&rdquo; he began, and for the moment got no farther, for in  turning his head to address his young guest he had allowed his gaze to wander  through the open window by which she sat, into the garden beyond, where Amabel  could be seen picking flowers. As he spoke, Amabel lifted her face with one of  her suggestive looks. She had doubtless heard Miss Halliday&rsquo;s remark.</p>
  <p>Recovering  himself with an effort, he repeated his words: &ldquo;I have but one recollection of  Mrs. Webb that I can give you. Years ago when I was a lad I was playing on the  green with several other boys. We had had some dispute about a lost ball, and I  was swearing angrily and loud when I suddenly perceived before me the tall form  and compassionate face of Mrs. Webb. She was dressed in her usual simple way,  and had a basket on her arm, but she looked so superior to any other woman I  had ever met that I did not know whether to hide my face in her skirts or to  follow my first impulse and run away. She saw the emotion she had aroused, and  lifting up my face by the chin, she said: &lsquo;Little boy, I have buried six  children, all of them younger than you, and now my husband and myself live  alone. Often and often have I wished that one at least of these darling infants  might have been spared us. But had God given me the choice of having them die  young and innocent, or of growing up to swear as I have heard you to-day, I  should have prayed God to take them, as He did. You have a mother. Do not break  her heart by taking in vain the name of the God she reveres.&rsquo; And with that she  kissed me, and, strange as it may seem to you, in whatever folly or wickedness  I have indulged, I have never made use of an oath from that day to this&mdash;and I  thank God for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was such unusual feeling in his voice, a feeling that none had ever suspected  him capable of before, that Miss Halliday regarded him with astonishment and  quite forgot to indulge in her usual banter. Even the gentlemen sat still, and  there was a momentary silence, through which there presently broke the  incongruous sound of a shrill and mocking laugh.</p>
  <p>It  came from Amabel, who had just finished gathering her bouquet in the garden  outside.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
    Detective Knapp Arrives</b></h2>
  <p>Meanwhile,  in a small room at the court-house, a still more serious conversation was in  progress. Dr. Talbot, Mr. Fenton, and a certain able lawyer in town by the name  of Harvey, were in close discussion. The last had broken the silence of years,  and was telling what he knew of Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s affairs.</p>
  <p>He  was a shrewd man, of unblemished reputation. When called upon to talk, he  talked well, but he much preferred listening, and was, as now appeared, the  safest repository of secrets to be found in all that region. He had been  married three times, and could still count thirteen children around his board,  one reason, perhaps, why he had learned to cultivate silence to such a degree.  Happily, the time had come for him to talk, and he talked. This is what he  said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  fifteen years ago Philemon Webb came to me with a small sum of money, which he  said he wished to have me invest for his wife. It was the fruit of a small  speculation of his and he wanted it given unconditionally to her without her  knowledge or that of the neighbours. I accordingly made out a deed of gift,  which he signed with joyful alacrity, and then after due thought and careful  investigation, I put the money into a new enterprise then being started in  Boston. It was the best stroke of business I ever did in my life. At the end of  a year it paid double, and after five had rolled away the accumulated interest  had reached such a sum that both Philemon and myself thought it wisest to let  her know what she was worth and what was being done with the money. I was in  hopes it would lead her to make some change in her mode of living, which seemed  to me out of keeping with her appearance and mental qualifications; while he, I  imagine, looked for something more important still&mdash;a smile on the face which  had somehow lost the trick of merriment, though it had never acquired that of  ill nature. But we did not know Agatha; at least I did not. When she learned  that she was rich, she looked at first awestruck and then heart-pierced.  Forgetting me, or ignoring me, it makes no matter which, she threw herself into  Philemon&rsquo;s arms and wept, while he, poor faithful fellow, looked as distressed  as if he had brought news of failure instead of triumphant success. I suppose  she thought of her buried children, and what the money would have been to her  if they had lived; but she did not speak of them, nor am I quite sure they were  in her thoughts when, after the first excitement was over, she drew back and  said quietly, but in a tone of strong feeling, to Philemon: &lsquo;You meant me a happy  surprise, and you must not be disappointed. This is heart money; we will use it  to make our townsfolk happy.&rsquo; I saw him glance at her dress, which was a purple  calico. I remember it because of that look and because of the sad smile with  which she followed his glance. &lsquo;Can we not afford now,&rsquo; he ventured, &lsquo;a little  show of luxury, or at least a ribbon or so for this beautiful throat of yours?&rsquo;  She did not answer him; but her look had a rare compassion in it, a compassion,  strange to say, that seemed to be expended upon him rather than upon herself.  Philemon swallowed his disappointment. &lsquo;Agatha is right,&rsquo; he said to me. &lsquo;We do  not need luxury. I do not know how I so far forgot myself as to mention it.&rsquo;  That was ten years ago, and every day since then her property has increased. I  did not know then, and I do not know now, why they were both so anxious that  all knowledge of their good fortune should be kept from those about them; but  that it was to be so kept was made very evident to me; and, notwithstanding all  temptations to the contrary, I have refrained from uttering a word likely to  give away their secret. The money, which to all appearance was the cause of her  tragic and untimely death, was interest money which I was delegated to deliver  her. I took it to her day before yesterday, and it was all in crisp new notes,  some of them twenties, but most of them tens and fives. I am free to say there  was not such another roll of fresh money in town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Warn  all shopkeepers to keep a sharp lookout for new bills in the money they  receive,&rdquo; was Dr. Talbot&rsquo;s comment to the constable. &ldquo;Fresh ten-and  twenty-dollar bills are none too common in this town. And now about her will.  Did you draw that up, Harvey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I did not know she had made one. I often spoke to her about the advisability of  her doing so, but she always put me off. And now it seems that she had it drawn  up in Boston. Could not trust her old friend with too many secrets, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you don&rsquo;t know how her money has been left?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  more than you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  an interruption occurred. The door opened and a slim young man, wearing  spectacles, came in. At sight of him they all rose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  eagerly inquired Dr. Talbot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  new,&rdquo; answered the young man, with a consequential air. &ldquo;The elder woman died  from loss of blood consequent upon a blow given by a small, three-sided,  slender blade; the younger from a stroke of apoplexy, induced by fright.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  I am glad to hear my instincts were not at fault. Loss of blood, eh? Death,  then, was not instantaneous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo;  fell from the lips of his two listeners. &ldquo;She lived, yet gave no alarm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  that was heard,&rdquo; suggested the young doctor, who was from another town.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or,  if heard, reached no ears but Philemon&rsquo;s,&rdquo; observed the constable. &ldquo;Something must have taken him up-stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so sure,&rdquo; said the coroner, &ldquo;that Philemon is not answerable for the  whole crime, notwithstanding our failure to find the missing money anywhere in  the house. How else account for the resignation with which she evidently met  her death? Had a stranger struck her, Agatha Webb would have struggled. There  is no sign of struggle in the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  would have struggled against Philemon had she had strength to struggle. I think  she was asleep when she was struck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  And was not standing by the table? How about the blood there, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shaken  from the murderer&rsquo;s fingers in fright or disgust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was no blood on Philemon&rsquo;s fingers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  he wiped them on his sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he was the one to use the dagger against her, where is the dagger? 
    Should we not be able to find it somewhere about the premises?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  may have buried it outside. Crazy men are supernaturally cunning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  you can produce it from any place inside that board fence, I will consider your  theory. At present I limit my suspicions of Philemon to the half-unconscious  attentions which a man of disordered intellect might give a wife bleeding and  dying under his eyes. My idea on the subject is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you be so kind as not to give utterance to your ideas until I have been able to  form some for myself?&rdquo; interrupted a voice from the doorway.</p>
  <p>As  this voice was unexpected, they all turned. A small man with sleek dark hair  and expressionless features stood before them. Behind him was Abel, carrying a  hand-bag and umbrella.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  detective from Boston,&rdquo; announced the latter. Coroner Talbot rose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are in good time,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;We have work of no ordinary nature for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man failed to look interested. But then his countenance was not one to show  emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  name is Knapp,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have had my supper, and am ready to go to work. I  have read the newspapers; all I want now is any additional facts that have come  to light since the telegraphic dispatches were sent to Boston. Facts, mind you;  not theories. I never allow myself to be hampered by other persons&rsquo; theories.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Not  liking his manner, which was brusque and too self-important for a man of such  insignificant appearance, Coroner Talbot referred him to Mr. Fenton, who  immediately proceeded to give him the result of such investigations as he and  his men had been able to make; which done, Mr. Knapp put on his hat and turned  toward the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will go to the house and see for myself what is to be learned there,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;May  I ask the privilege of going alone?&rdquo; he added, as Mr. Fenton moved. &ldquo;Abel will  see that I am given admittance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Show  me your credentials,&rdquo; said the coroner. He did so. &ldquo;They seem all right, and  you should be a man who understands his business. Go alone, if you prefer, but  bring your conclusions here. They may need some correcting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I will return,&rdquo; Knapp nonchalantly remarked, and went out, having made anything  but a favourable impression upon the assembled gentlemen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish we had shown more grit and tried to handle this thing ourselves,&rdquo; observed  Mr. Fenton. &ldquo;I cannot bear to think of that cold, bloodless creature hovering  over our beloved Agatha.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder at Carson. Why should he send us such a man? Could he not see the matter  demanded extraordinary skill and judgment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  this fellow may have skill. But he is so unpleasant. I hate to deal with folks  of such fish-like characteristics. But who is this?&rdquo; he asked as a gentle tap  was heard at the door. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Loton. What can he want here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man whose presence in the doorway had called out this exclamation started at  the sound of the doctor&rsquo;s heavy voice, and came very hesitatingly forward. He  was of a weak, irritable type, and seemed to be in a state of great excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg pardon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for showing myself. I don&rsquo;t like to intrude into such  company, but I have something to tell you which may be of use, sirs, though it  isn&rsquo;t any great thing, either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  about the murder which has taken place?&rdquo; asked the coroner, in a milder tone.  He knew Loton well, and realised the advisability of encouragement in his case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  murder! Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t presume to say anything about the murder. I&rsquo;m not the  man to stir up any such subject as that. It&rsquo;s about the money&mdash;or some  money&mdash;more money than usually falls into my till. It&mdash;it was rather queer, sirs,  and I have felt the flutter of it all day. Shall I tell you about it? It  happened last night, late last night, sirs, so late that I was in bed with my  wife, and had been snoring, she said, four hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  money? New money? Crisp, fresh bills, Loton?&rdquo; eagerly questioned 
    Mr. Fenton.</p>
  <p>Loton,  who was the keeper of a small confectionery and bakery store on one of the side  streets leading up the hill, shifted uneasily between his two interrogators,  and finally addressed himself to the coroner:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was new money. I thought it felt so at night, but I was sure of it in the  morning. A brand-new bill, sir, a&mdash;But that isn&rsquo;t the queerest thing about it. I  was asleep, sir, sound asleep, and dreaming of my courting days (for I asked  Sally at the circus, sirs, and the band playing on the hill made me think of  it), when I was suddenly shook awake by Sally herself, who says she hadn&rsquo;t  slept a wink for listening to the music and wishing she was a girl again. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s  a man at the shop door,&rsquo; cries she. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a-calling of you; go and see what he  wants.&rsquo; I was mad at being wakened. Dreaming is pleasant, specially when clowns  and kissing get mixed up in it, but duty is duty, and so into the shop I  stumbled, swearing a bit perhaps, for I hadn&rsquo;t stopped for a light and it was  as dark as double shutters could make it. The hammering had become deafening.  No let up till I reached the door, when it suddenly ceased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What  is it?&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there and what do you want?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  trembling voice answered me. &lsquo;Let me in,&rsquo; it said. &lsquo;I want to buy something to  eat. For God&rsquo;s sake, open the door!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know why I obeyed, for it was late, and I did not know the voice, but  something in the impatient rattling of the door which accompanied the words  affected me in spite of myself, and I slowly opened my shop to this midnight  customer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You  must be hungry,&rsquo; I began. But the person who had crowded in as soon as the  opening was large enough wouldn&rsquo;t let me finish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bread!  I want bread, or crackers, or anything that you can find easiest,&rsquo; he gasped,  like a man who had been running. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s money&rsquo;; and he poked into my hand a  bill so stiff that it rattled. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s more than enough,&rsquo; he hastened to say, as  I hesitated over it, &lsquo;but never mind that; I&rsquo;ll come for the change in the  morning.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who  are you? I cried. &lsquo;You are not Blind Willy, I&rsquo;m sure.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  his only answer was &lsquo;Bread!&rsquo; while he leaned so hard against the counter I felt  it shake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could not stand that cry of &lsquo;Bread!&rsquo; so I groped about in the dark, and found  him a stale loaf, which I put into his arms, with a short, &lsquo;There! Now tell me  what your name is.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  at this he seemed to shrink into himself; and muttering something that might  pass for thanks, he stumbled towards the door and rushed hastily out. Running  after him, I listened eagerly to his steps. They went up the hill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the money? What about the money?&rdquo; asked the coroner. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he come back for  the change?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I put it in the till, thinking it was a dollar bill. But when I came to look at  it in the morning, it was a twenty; yes, sirs, a twenty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was startling. The coroner and the constable looked at each other before  looking again at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  where is that bill now?&rdquo; asked the former. &ldquo;Have you brought it with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have, sir. It&rsquo;s been in and out of the till twenty times to-day. I haven&rsquo;t  known what to do with it. I don&rsquo;t like to think wrong of anybody, but when I  heard that Mrs. Webb (God bless her!) was murdered last night for money, I  couldn&rsquo;t rest for the weight of this thing on my conscience. Here&rsquo;s the bill,  sir. I wish I had let the old man rap on my door till morning before I had  taken it from him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  did not share this feeling. A distinct and valuable clew seemed to be afforded  them by the fresh, crisp bill they saw in his hand. Silently Dr. Talbot took  it, while Mr. Fenton, with a shrewd look, asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  reasons have you for calling this mysterious customer old? I thought it was so  dark you could not see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man, who looked relieved since he had rid himself of the bill, eyed the constable  in some perplexity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t see a feature of his face,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and yet I&rsquo;m sure he was old. I  never thought of him as being anything else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we will see. And is that all you have to tell us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  nod was expressive, and they let him go.</p>
  <p>An  hour or so later Detective Knapp made his reappearance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  asked the coroner, as he came quietly in and closed the door behind him, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s  your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simple  case, sir. Murdered for money. Find the man with a flowing beard.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
    The Man With A Beard</b></h2>
  <p>There  were but few men in town who wore long beards. A list was made of these and  handed to the coroner, who regarded it with a grim smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a man whose name is here would be guilty of a misdemeanour, let alone a crime.  You must look outside of our village population for the murderer of Agatha  Webb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely, but tell me something first about these persons,&rdquo; urged 
    Knapp. &ldquo;Who is Edward Hope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  watch repairer; a man of estimable character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Sylvester Chubb?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  farmer who, to support his mother, wife, and seven children, works from morning  till sundown on his farm, and from sundown till 11 o&rsquo;clock at night on little  fancy articles he cuts out from wood and sells in Boston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;John  Barker, Thomas Elder, Timothy Sinn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  good men; I can vouch for every one of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  John Zabel, James Zabel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Irreproachable,  both of them. Famous ship&mdash;builders once, but the change to iron ship-building  has thrown them out of business. Pity, too, for they were remarkable builders.  By the by, Fenton, we don&rsquo;t see them at church or on the docks any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  they keep very much to themselves; getting old, like ourselves, 
    Talbot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lively  boys once. We must hunt them up, Fenton. Can&rsquo;t bear to see old friends drop  away from good company. But this isn&rsquo;t business. You need not pause over their  names, Knapp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Knapp had slipped out.</p>
  <p>We  will follow him.</p>
  <p>Walking  briskly down the street, he went up the steps of a certain house and rang the  bell. A gentleman with a face not entirely unknown to us came to the door.</p>
  <p>The  detective did not pause for preliminaries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you Mr. Crane?&rdquo; he asked,&mdash;&ldquo;the gentleman who ran against a man coming out of  Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s house last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am Mr. Crane,&rdquo; was the slightly surprised rejoinder, &ldquo;and I was run against by  a man there, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; remarked the detective, quietly, &ldquo;my name is Knapp. I have been sent  from Boston to look into this matter, and I have an idea that you can help me  more than any other man here in Sutherlandtown. Who was this person who came in  contact with you so violently? You know, even if you have been careful not to  mention any names.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are mistaken. I don&rsquo;t know; I can&rsquo;t know. He wore a sweeping beard, and walked  and acted like a man no longer young, but beyond that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Crane, excuse me, but I know men. If you had no suspicion as to whom that  person was you would not look so embarrassed. You suspect, or, at least,  associate in your own mind a name with the man you met. Was it either of these  you see written here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Crane glanced at the card on which the other had scribbled a couple of names,  and started perceptibly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have me,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you must be a man of remarkable perspicacity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective smiled and pocketed his card. The names he thus concealed were John  Zabel, James Zabel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not said which of the two it was,&rdquo; Knapp quietly suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  returned the minister, &ldquo;and I have not even thought. Indeed, I am not sure that  I have not made a dreadful mistake in thinking it was either. A glimpse such as  I had is far from satisfactory; and they are both such excellent men&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight!  You did make a mistake, of course, I have not the least doubt of it. So don&rsquo;t  think of the matter again. I will find out who the real man was; rest easy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with the lightest of bows, Knapp drew off and passed as quickly as he could,  without attracting attention, round the corner to the confectioner&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>Here  his attack was warier. Sally Loton was behind the counter with her husband, and  they had evidently been talking the matter over very confidentially. But Knapp  was not to be awed by her small, keen eye or strident voice, and presently  succeeded in surprising a knowing look on the lady&rsquo;s face, which convinced him  that in the confidences between husband and wife a name had been used which she  appeared to be less unwilling to impart than he. Knapp, consequently, turned  his full attention towards her, using in his attack that oldest and subtlest  weapon against the sex&mdash;flattery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your good heart is apparent; your husband has confided  to you a name which you, out of fear of some mistake, hesitate to repeat. A  neighbourly spirit, ma&rsquo;am, a very neighbourly spirit; but you should not allow  your goodness to defeat the ends of justice. If you simply told us whom this  man resembled we would be able to get some idea of his appearance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t resemble anyone I know,&rdquo; growled Loton. &ldquo;It was too dark for me to see  how he looked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  voice, then? People are traced by their voices.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t recognise his voice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Knapp  smiled, his eye still on the woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you have thought of someone he reminded you of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man was silent, but the wife tossed her head ever so lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  you must have had your reasons for that. No one thinks of a good and  respectable neighbour in connection with the buying of a loaf of bread at  midnight with a twenty-dollar bill, without some positive reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man wore a beard. I felt it brush my hand as he took the loaf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  That is a point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  made me think of other men who wore beards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As,  for instance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective had taken from his pocket the card which he had used with such effect  at the minister&rsquo;s, and as he said these words twirled it so that the two names  written upon it fell under Sally Loton&rsquo;s inquisitive eyes. The look with which  she read them was enough. John Zabel, James Zabel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  told you it was either of these men?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did,&rdquo; he retorted, pocketing the card with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;La,  now! Samuel, I never spoke a word,&rdquo; she insisted, in anxious protest to her  husband, as the detective slid quietly from the store.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    Wattles Comes</b></h2>
  <p>The  Hallidays lived but a few rods from the Sutherlands. Yet as it was dusk when  Miss Halliday rose to depart, Frederick naturally offered his services as her  escort.</p>
  <p>She  accepted them with a slight blush, the first he had ever seen on her face, or  at least had ever noted there. It caused him such surprise that he forgot  Amabel&rsquo;s presence in the garden till they came upon her at the gate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  pleasant evening,&rdquo; observed that young girl in her high, unmusical voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo;  was Miss Halliday&rsquo;s short reply; and for a moment the two faces were in line as  he held open the gate before his departing guest.</p>
  <p>They  were very different faces in feature and expression, and till that night he had  never thought of comparing them. Indeed, the fascination which beamed from  Amabel Page&rsquo;s far from regular features had put all others out of his mind, but  now, as he surveyed the two girls, the candour and purity which marked Agnes&rsquo;s  countenance came out so strongly under his glance that Amabel lost all  attraction for him, and he drew his young neighbour hastily away.</p>
  <p>Amabel  noted the movement and smiled. Her contempt for Agnes Halliday&rsquo;s charms  amounted to disdain.</p>
  <p>She  might have felt less confidence in her own had she been in a position to note  the frequent glances Frederick cast at his old playmate as they proceeded  slowly up the road. Not that there was any passion in them&mdash;he was too full of  care for that; but the curiosity which could prompt him to turn his head a  dozen times in the course of so short a walk, to see why Agnes Halliday held  her face so persistently away from him, had an element of feeling in it that  was more or less significant. As for Agnes, she was so unlike her accustomed  self as to astonish even herself. Whereas she had never before walked a dozen  steps with him without indulging in some sharp saying, she found herself  disinclined to speak at all, much less to speak lightly. In mutual silence,  then, they reached the gateway leading into the Halliday grounds. But Agnes  having passed in, they both stopped and for the first time looked squarely at  each other. Her eyes fell first, perhaps because his had changed in his  contemplation of her. He smiled as he saw this, and in a half-careless, half-wistful  tone, said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes,  what would you think of a man who, after having committed little else but folly  all his life, suddenly made up his mind to turn absolutely toward the right and  to pursue it in face of every obstacle and every discouragement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think,&rdquo; she slowly replied, with one quick lift of her eyes toward his  face, &ldquo;that he had entered upon the noblest effort of which man is capable, and  the hardest. I should have great sympathy for that man, Frederick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you?&rdquo; he said, recalling Amabel&rsquo;s face with bitter aversion as he gazed into  the womanly countenance he had hitherto slighted as uninteresting. &ldquo;It is the  first kind word you have ever given me, Agnes. Possibly it is the first I have  ever deserved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  without another word he doffed his hat, saluted her, and vanished down the  hillside.</p>
  <p>She  remained; remained so long that it was nearly nine when she entered the family  parlour. As she came in her mother looked up and was startled at her  unaccustomed pallor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  Agnes,&rdquo; cried her mother, &ldquo;what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  answer was inaudible. What was the matter? She dreaded, even feared, to ask  herself.</p>
  <p>Meantime  a strange scene was taking place in the woods toward which she had seen  Frederick go. The moon, which was particularly bright that night, shone upon a  certain hollow where a huge tree lay. Around it the underbrush was thick and  the shadow dark, but in this especial place the opening was large enough for  the rays to enter freely. Into this circlet of light Frederick Sutherland had  come. Alone and without the restraint imposed upon him by watching eyes, he  showed a countenance so wan and full of trouble that it was well it could not  be seen by either of the two women whose thoughts were at that moment fixed  upon him. To Amabel it would have given a throb of selfish hope, while to Agnes  it would have brought a pang of despair which might have somewhat too suddenly  interpreted to her the mystery of her own sensations.</p>
  <p>He  had bent at once to the hollow space made by the outspreading roots just  mentioned, and was feeling with an air of confidence along the ground for  something he had every reason to expect to find, when the shock of a sudden  distrust seized him, and he flung himself down in terror, feeling and feeling  again among the fallen leaves and broken twigs, till a full realisation of his  misfortune reached him, and he was obliged to acknowledge that the place was  empty.</p>
  <p>Overwhelmed  at his loss, aghast at the consequences it must entail upon him, he rose in a  trembling sweat, crying out in his anger and dismay:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has been here! She has taken it!&rdquo; And realising for the first time the subtlety  and strength of the antagonist pitted against him, he forgot his new  resolutions and even that old promise made in his childhood to Agatha Webb, and  uttered oath after oath, cursing himself, the woman, and what she had done,  till a casual glance at the heavens overhead, in which the liquid moon hung  calm and beautiful, recalled him to himself. With a sense of shame, the keener  that it was a new sensation in his breast, he ceased his vain repinings, and  turning from the unhallowed spot, made his way with deeper and deeper  misgivings toward a home made hateful to him now by the presence of the woman  who was thus bent upon his ruin.</p>
  <p>He  understood her now. He rated at its full value both her determination and her  power, and had she been so unfortunate as to have carried her imprudence to the  point of surprising him by her presence, it would have taken more than the  memory of that day&rsquo;s solemn resolves to have kept him from using his strength  against her. But she was wise, and did not intrude upon him in his hour of  anger, though who could say she was not near enough to hear the sigh which  broke irresistibly from his lips as he emerged from the wood and approached his  father&rsquo;s house?</p>
  <p>A  lamp was still burning in Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s study over the front door, and the  sight of it seemed to change for a moment the current of Frederick&rsquo;s thoughts.  Pausing at the gate, he considered with himself, and then with a freer  countenance and a lighter step was about to proceed inward, when he heard the  sound of a heavy breather coming up the hill, and hesitated&mdash;why he hardly knew,  except that every advancing step occasioned him more or less apprehension.</p>
  <p>The  person, whoever it was, stopped before reaching the brow of the hill, and,  panting heavily, muttered an oath which Frederick heard. Though it was no more  profane than those which had just escaped his own lips in the forest, it  produced an effect upon him which was only second in intensity to the terror of  the discovery that the money he had so safely hidden was gone.</p>
  <p>Trembling  in every limb, he dashed down the hill and confronted the person standing  there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;  he cried, &ldquo;you!&rdquo; And for a moment he looked as if he would like to fell to the  ground the man before him.</p>
  <p>But  this man was a heavyweight of no ordinary physical strength and adroitness, and  only smiled at Frederick&rsquo;s heat and threatening attitude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought I would be made welcome,&rdquo; he smiled, with just the hint of sinister  meaning in his tone. Then, before Frederick could speak: &ldquo;I have merely saved  you a trip to Boston; why so much anger, friend? You have the money; of that I  am positive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  We can&rsquo;t talk here,&rdquo; whispered Frederick. &ldquo;Come into the grounds, or, what  would be better, into the woods over there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t go into any woods with you,&rdquo; laughed the other; &ldquo;not after last night, my  friend. But I will talk low; that&rsquo;s no more than fair; I don&rsquo;t want to put you  into any other man&rsquo;s power, especially if you have the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wattles,&rdquo;&mdash;Frederick&rsquo;s  tone was broken, almost unintelligible,&mdash;&ldquo;what do you mean by your allusion to  last night? Have you dared to connect me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  Pooh!&rdquo; interrupted the other, good-humouredly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us waste words over a  chance expression I may have dropped. I don&rsquo;t care anything about last night&rsquo;s  work, or who was concerned in it. That&rsquo;s nothing to me. All I want, my boy, is  the money, and that I want devilish bad, or I would not have run up here from  Boston, when I might have made half a hundred off a countryman Lewis brought in  from the Canada wilds this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wattles,  I swear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the hand he had raised was quickly drawn down by the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;  said the older man, shortly. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t pay, Sutherland. Stage-talk never passed  for anything with me. Besides, your white face tells a truer story than your  lips, and time is precious. I want to take the 11 o&rsquo;clock train back. So down  with the cash. Nine hundred and fifty-five it is, but, being friends, we will  let the odd five go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wattles,  I was to bring it to you to-morrow, or was it the next day? I do not want to  give it to you to-night; indeed, I cannot, but&mdash;Wattles, wait, stop! Where are  you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  see your father. I want to tell him that his son owes me a debt; that this debt  was incurred in a way that lays him liable to arrest for forgery; that, bad as  he thinks you, there are facts which can be picked up in Boston which would  render Frederick Sutherland&rsquo;s continued residence under the parental roof  impossible; that, in fact, you are a scamp of the first water, and that only my  friendship for you has kept you out of prison so long. Won&rsquo;t that make a nice  story for the old gentleman&rsquo;s ears!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wattles&mdash;I&mdash;oh,  my God! Wattles, stop a minute and listen to me. I have not got the money. I  had enough this morning to pay you, had it legitimately, Wattles, but it has  been stolen from me and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will also tell him,&rdquo; the other broke in, as quietly as if Frederick had not  uttered a word, &ldquo;that in a certain visit to Boston you lost five hundred  dollars on one hand; that you lost it unfairly, not having a dollar to pay  with; that to prevent scandal I became your security, with the understanding  that I was to be paid at the end of ten days from that night; that you thereupon  played again and lost four hundred and odd more, so that your debt amounted to  nine hundred and fifty-five dollars; that the ten days passed without payment;  that, wanting money, I pressed you and even resorted to a threat or two; and  that, seeing me in earnest, you swore that the dollars should be mine within  five days; that instead of remaining in Boston to get them, you came here; and  that this morning at a very early hour you telegraphed that the funds were to  hand and that you would bring them down to me to-morrow. The old gentleman may  draw conclusions from this, Sutherland, which may make his position as your  father anything but grateful to him. He may even&mdash;Ah, you would try that game,  would you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man had flung himself at the older man&rsquo;s throat as if he would choke off  the words he saw trembling on his lips. But the struggle thus begun was short.  In a moment both stood panting, and Frederick, with lowered head, was saying  humbly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg pardon, Wattles, but you drive me mad with your suggestions and  conclusions. I have not got the money, but I will try and get it. Wait here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  ten minutes, Sutherland; no longer! The moon is bright, and I can see the hands  of my watch distinctly. At a quarter to ten, you will return here with the amount  I have mentioned, or I will seek it at your father&rsquo;s hands in his own study.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  made a hurried gesture and vanished up the walk. Next moment he was at his  father&rsquo;s study door.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
    Wattles Goes</b></h2>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland was busily engaged with a law paper when his son entered his  presence, but at sight of that son&rsquo;s face, he dropped the paper with an  alacrity which Frederick was too much engaged with his own thoughts to notice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo;  he began without preamble or excuse, &ldquo;I am in serious and immediate need of  nine hundred and fifty dollars. I want it so much that I ask you to make me a  check for that amount to-night, conscious though I am that you have every right  to deny me this request, and that my debt to you already passes the bound of  presumption on my part and indulgence on yours. I cannot tell you why I want it  or for what. That belongs to my past life, the consequences of which I have not  yet escaped, but I feel bound to state that you will not be the loser by this  material proof of confidence in me, as I shall soon be in a position to repay  all my debts, among which this will necessarily stand foremost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old gentleman looked startled and nervously fingered the paper he had let fall.  &ldquo;Why do you say you will soon be in a position to repay me? What do you mean by  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  flash, which had not yet subsided from the young man&rsquo;s face, ebbed slowly away  as he encountered his father&rsquo;s eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean to work,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I mean to make a man of myself as soon as  possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  look which Mr. Sutherland gave him was more inquiring than sympathetic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you need this money for a start?&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>Frederick  bowed; he seemed to be losing the faculty of speech. The clock over the mantel  had told off five of the precious moments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will give it to you,&rdquo; said his father, and drew out his check-book. 
    But he did not hasten to open it; his eyes still rested on his son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  murmured the young man. &ldquo;There is a train leaving soon. I wish to get it away  on that train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  father frowned with natural distrust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you would confide in me,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>Frederick  did not answer. The hands of the clock were moving on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will give it to you; but I should like to know what for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is impossible for me to tell you,&rdquo; groaned the young man, starting as he heard  a step on the walk without.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  need has become strangely imperative,&rdquo; proceeded the other. &ldquo;Has 
    Miss Page&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  took a step forward and laid his hand on his father&rsquo;s arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not for her,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;It goes into other hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland, who had turned over the document as his son approached, breathed  more easily. Taking up his pen, he dipped it in the ink. Frederick watched him  with constantly whitening cheek. The step on the walk had mounted to the front  door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nine  hundred and fifty?&rdquo; inquired the father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nine  hundred and fifty,&rdquo; answered the son.</p>
  <p>The  judge, with a last look, stooped over the book. The hands of the clock pointed  to a quarter to ten.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,  I have my whole future in which to thank you,&rdquo; cried Frederick, seizing the  check his father held out to him and making rapidly for the door. &ldquo;I will be  back before midnight.&rdquo; And he flung himself down-stairs just as the front door  opened and Wattles stepped in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  exclaimed the latter, as his eye fell on the paper fluttering in the other&rsquo;s  hand, &ldquo;I expected money, not paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  paper is good,&rdquo; answered Frederick, drawing him swiftly out of the house. &ldquo;It  has my father&rsquo;s signature upon it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  father&rsquo;s signature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wattles  gave it a look, then slowly shook his head at Frederick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it as well done as the one you tried to pass off on Brady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  cringed, and for a moment looked as if the struggle was too much for him. Then  he rallied and eying Wattles firmly, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have a right to distrust me, but you are on the wrong track, Wattles. What I  did once, I can never do again; and I hope I may live to prove myself a changed  man. As for that check, I will soon prove its value in your eyes. Follow me  up-stairs to my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  energy&mdash;the energy of despair, no doubt seemed to make an impression on the  other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might as well proclaim yourself a forger outright, as to force your father to  declare this to be his signature,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; said Frederick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you will run that risk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you oblige me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wattles  shrugged his shoulders. He was a magnificent-looking man and towered in that  old colonial hall like a youthful giant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  bear you no ill will,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If this represents money, I am satisfied, and  I begin to think it does. But listen, Sutherland. Something has happened to  you. A week ago you would have put a bullet through my head before you would  have been willing to have so compromised yourself. I think I know what that  something is. To save yourself from being thought guilty of a big crime you are  willing to incur suspicion of a small one. It&rsquo;s a wise move, my boy, but look  out! No tricks with me or my friendship may not hold. Meantime, I cash this  check to-morrow.&rdquo; And he swung away through the night with a grand-opera  selection on his lips.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
    A Final Temptation</b></h2>
  <p>Frederick  looked like a man thoroughly exhausted when the final echo of this hateful  voice died away on the hillside. For the last twenty hours he had been the prey  of one harrowing emotion after another, and human nature could endure no more  without rest.</p>
  <p>But  rest would not come. The position in which he found himself, between Amabel and  the man who had just left, was of too threatening a nature for him to ignore.  But one means of escape presented itself. It was a cowardly one; but anything  was better than to make an attempt to stand his ground against two such  merciless antagonists; so he resolved upon flight.</p>
  <p>Packing  up a few necessaries and leaving a letter behind him for his father, he made  his way down the stairs of the now darkened house to a door opening upon the  garden. To his astonishment he found it unlocked, but, giving little heed to  this in his excitement, he opened it with caution, and, with a parting sigh for  the sheltering home he was about to leave forever, stepped from the house he no  longer felt worthy to inhabit.</p>
  <p>His  intention was to take the train at Portchester, and that he might reach that  place without inconvenient encounters, he decided to proceed by a short cut  through the fields. This led him north along the ridge that overlooks the road  running around the base of the hill. He did not think of this road, however, or  of anything, in fact, but the necessity of taking the very earliest train out  of Portchester. As this left at 3.30 A.M., he realised that he must hasten in  order to reach it. But he was not destined to take it or any other train out of  Portchester that night, for when he reached the fence dividing Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s  grounds from those of his adjoining neighbour, he saw, drawn up in the moonlight  just at the point where he had intended to leap the fence, the form of a woman  with one hand held out to stop him.</p>
  <p>It  was Amabel.</p>
  <p>Confounded  by this check and filled with an anger that was nigh to dangerous, he fell back  and then immediately sprang forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you doing here?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that it is eleven o&rsquo;clock and  that my father requires the house to be closed at that hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you?&rdquo; was her sole retort; &ldquo;what are you doing here? Are you searching for  flowers in the woods, and is that valise you carry the receptacle in which you  hope to put your botanical specimens?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a savage gesture he dropped the valise and took her fiercely by the shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  have you hidden my money?&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Tell me, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  what?&rdquo; she asked, smiling into his face in a way that made him lose his grip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or&mdash;or  I cannot answer for myself,&rdquo; he proceeded, stammering. &ldquo;Do you. think I can  endure everything from you because you are a woman? No; I will have those  bills, every one of them, or show myself your master. Where are they, you  incarnate fiend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was an unwise word to use, but she did not seem to heed it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  she said softly, and with a lingering accent, as if his grasp of her had been a  caress to which she was not entirely averse. &ldquo;I did not think you would  discover its loss so soon. When did you go to the woods, Frederick? And was  Miss Halliday with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had a disposition to strike her, but controlled himself. Blows would not avail  against the softness of this suave, yet merciless, being. Only a will as strong  as her own could hope to cope with this smiling fury; and this he was  determined to show, though, alas! he had everything to lose in a struggle that  robbed her of nothing but a hope which was but a baseless fabric at best; for he  was more than ever determined never to marry her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man does not need to wait long to miss his own,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And if you have  taken this money, which, you do not deny, you have shown yourself very  short-sighted, for danger lies closer to the person holding this money than to  the one you vilify by your threats. This you will find, Amabel, when you come  to make use of the weapon with which you have thought to arm yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tut,  tut!&rdquo; was her contemptuous reply. &ldquo;Do you consider me a child? Do 
    I look like a babbling infant, Frederick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  face, which had been lifted to his in saying this, was so illumined, both by  her smile, which was strangely enchanting for one so evil, and by the  moonlight, which so etherialises all that it touches, that he found himself  forced to recall that other purer, truer face he had left at the honeysuckle  porch to keep down a last wild impulse toward her, which would have been his  undoing, both in this world and the next, as he knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  do I look simply like a woman?&rdquo; she went on, seeing the impression she had  made, and playing upon it. &ldquo;A woman who understands herself and you and all the  secret perils of the game we are both playing? If I am a child, treat me as a  child; but if I am a woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand  out of my way!&rdquo; he cried, catching up his valise and striding furiously by her.  &ldquo;Woman or child, know that I will not be your plaything to be damned in this  world and in the next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you bound for the city of destruction?&rdquo; she laughed, not moving, but showing  such confidence in her power to hold him back that he stopped in spite of  himself. &ldquo;If so, you are taking the direct road there and have only to hasten.  But you had better remain in your father&rsquo;s house; even if you are something of  a prisoner there, like my very insignificant self. The outcome will be more  satisfactory, even if you have to share your future with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what course will you take,&rdquo; he asked, pausing with his hand on the fence, &ldquo;if I  decide to choose destruction without you, rather than perdition with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  course? Why, I shall tell Dr. Talbot just enough to show you to be as desirable  a witness in the impending inquest as myself. The result I leave to your  judgment. But you will not drive me to this extremity. You will come back and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Woman,  I will never come back. I shall have to dare your worst in a week and will  begin by daring you now. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  he did not leap the fence, though he made a move to do so, for at that moment a  party of men came hurrying by on the lower road, one of whom was heard to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will bet my head that we will put our hand on Agatha Webb&rsquo;s murderer to-night.  The man who shoves twenty-dollar bills around so heedlessly should not wear a  beard so long it leads to detection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the coroner, the constable, Knapp, and Abel on their way to the forest road  on which lived John and James Zabel.</p>
  <p>Frederick  and Amabel confronted each other, and after a moment&rsquo;s silence returned as if  by a common impulse towards the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  have they got in their heads?&rdquo; queried she. &ldquo;Whatever it is, it may serve to  occupy them till the week of your probation is over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not answer. A new and overwhelming complication had been added to the  difficulties of his situation.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
    The Zabels Visited</b></h2>
  <p>Let  us follow the party now winding up the hillside.</p>
  <p>In  a deeply wooded spot on a side road stood the little house to which John and  James Zabel had removed when their business on the docks had terminated. There  was no other dwelling of greater or lesser pretension on the road, which may  account for the fact that none of the persons now approaching it had been in  that neighbourhood for years, though it was by no means a long walk from the  village in which they all led such busy lives.</p>
  <p>The  heavy shadows cast by the woods through which the road meandered were not  without their effect upon the spirits of the four men passing through them, so  that long before they reached the opening in which the Zabel cottage stood,  silence had fallen upon the whole party. Dr. Talbot especially looked as if he  little relished this late visit to his old friends, and not till they caught a  glimpse of the long sloping roof and heavy chimney of the Zabel cottage did he  shake off the gloom incident to the nature of his errand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;  said he, coming to a sudden halt, &ldquo;let us understand each other. We are about  to make a call on two of our oldest and most respectable townsfolk. If in the  course of that call I choose to make mention of the twenty-dollar bill left  with Loton, well and good, but if not, you are to take my reticence as proof of  my own belief that they had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Two  of the party bowed; Knapp, only, made no sign.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no light in the window,&rdquo; observed Abel. &ldquo;What if we find them gone to bed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will wake them,&rdquo; said the constable. &ldquo;I cannot go back without being myself  assured that no more money like that given to Loton remains in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; remarked Knapp, and going up to the door before him, he struck a  resounding knock sufficiently startling in that place of silence.</p>
  <p>But  loud as the summons was it brought no answer. Not only the moon-lighted door,  but the little windows on each side of it remained shut, and there was no  evidence that the knock had been heard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Zabel!  John Zabel!&rdquo; shouted the constable, stepping around the side of the house. &ldquo;Get  up, my good friends, and let an old crony in. James! John! Late as it is, we  have business with you. Open the door; don&rsquo;t stop to dress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  this appeal received no more recognition than the first, and after rapping on  the window against which he had flung the words, he came back and looked up and  down the front of the house.</p>
  <p>It  had a solitary aspect and was much less comfortable-looking than he had  expected. Indeed, there were signs of poverty, or at least of neglect, about  the place that astonished him. Not only had the weeds been allowed to grow over  the doorstep, but from the unpainted front itself bits of boards had rotted  away, leaving great gaps about the window-ledges and at the base of the sunken  and well-nigh toppling chimney. The moon flooding the roof showed up all these  imperfections with pitiless insistence, and the torn edges of the green paper  shades that half concealed the rooms within were plainly to be seen, as well as  the dismantled knocker which hung by one nail to the old cracked door. The  vision of Knapp with his ear laid against this door added to the forlorn and  sinister aspect of the scene, and gave to the constable, who remembered the  brothers in their palmy days when they were the life and pride of the town, a by  no means agreeable sensation, as he advanced toward the detective and asked him  what they should do now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Break  down the door!&rdquo; was the uncompromising reply. &ldquo;Or, wait! The windows of country  houses are seldom fastened; let me see if I cannot enter by some one of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  not,&rdquo; said the coroner, with considerable feeling. &ldquo;Let us exhaust all other  means first.&rdquo; And he took hold of the knob of the door to shake it, when to his  surprise it turned and the door opened. It had not been locked.</p>
  <p>Rather  taken aback by this, he hesitated. But Knapp showed less scruple. Without  waiting for any man&rsquo;s permission, he glided in and stepped cautiously, but  without any delay, into a room the door of which stood wide open before him.  The constable was about to follow when he saw Knapp come stumbling back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Devilish  work,&rdquo; he muttered, and drew the others in to see.</p>
  <p>Never  will any of these men forget the sight that there met their eyes.</p>
  <p>On  the floor near the entrance lay one brother, in a streak of moonlight, which  showed every feature of his worn and lifeless face, and at a table drawn up in  the centre of the room sat the other, rigid in death, with a book clutched in  his hand.</p>
  <p>Both,  had been dead some time, and on the faces and in the aspects of both was  visible a misery that added its own gloom to the pitiable and gruesome scene,  and made the shining of the great white moon, which filled every corner of the  bare room, seem a mockery well-nigh unendurable to those who contemplated it.  John, dead in his chair! James, dead on the floor!</p>
  <p>Knapp,  who of all present was least likely to feel the awesome nature of the tragedy,  was naturally the first to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both  wear long beards,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but the one lying on the floor was doubtless Loton&rsquo;s  customer. Ah!&rdquo; he cried, pointing at the table, as he carefully crossed the  floor. &ldquo;Here is the bread, and&mdash;&rdquo; Even he had his moments of feeling. The  appearance of that loaf had stunned him; one corner of it had been gnawed off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  light! let us have a light!&rdquo; cried Mr. Fenton, speaking for the first time  since his entrance. &ldquo;These moonbeams are horrible; see how they cling to the  bodies as if they delighted in lighting up these wasted and shrunken forms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  it have been hunger?&rdquo; began Abel, tremblingly following Knapp&rsquo;s every movement  as he struck a match and lit a lantern which he had brought in his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  help us all if it was!&rdquo; said Fenton, in a secret remorse no one but 
    Dr. Talbot understood. &ldquo;But who could have believed it of men who were 
    once so prosperous? Are you sure that one of them has gnawed this bread? 
    Could it not have been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These  are the marks of human teeth,&rdquo; observed Knapp, who was examining the loaf  carefully. &ldquo;I declare, it makes me very uncomfortable, notwithstanding it&rsquo;s in  the line of regular experiences.&rdquo; And he laid the bread down hurriedly.</p>
  <p>Meantime,  Mr. Fenton, who had been bending over another portion of the table, turned and  walked away to the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad they are dead,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;They have at least shared the fate of  their victims. Take a look under that old handkerchief lying beside the  newspaper, Knapp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective did so. A three-edged dagger, with a curiously wrought handle, met  his eye. It had blood dried on its point, and was, as all could see, the weapon  with which Agatha Webb had been killed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
    Local Talent At Work</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,  we have reached the conclusion of this business sooner than I expected,&rdquo;  announced Knapp. &ldquo;If you will give me just ten minutes I will endeavour to find  that large remainder of money we have every reason to think is hidden away in  this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop  a minute,&rdquo; said the coroner. &ldquo;Let me see what book John is holding so tightly.  Why,&rdquo; he exclaimed, drawing it out and giving it one glance, &ldquo;it is a Bible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laying  it reverently down he met the detective&rsquo;s astonished glance and seriously  remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is some incongruity between the presence of this book and the deed we believe  to have been performed down yonder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  at all,&rdquo; quoth the detective. &ldquo;It was not the man in the chair, but the one on  the floor, who made use of that dagger. But I wish you had left it to me to  remove that book, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You?  and why? What difference would it have made?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would have noticed between what pages his finger was inserted. Nothing like  making yourself acquainted with every detail in a case like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Talbot gazed wistfully at the book. He would have liked to know himself on what  especial passage his friend&rsquo;s eyes had last rested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will stand aside,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and hear your report when you are done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective had already begun his investigations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  is a spot of blood,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;See! on the right trouser leg of the one you  call James. This connects him indisputably with the crime in which this dagger  was used. No signs of violence on his body. She was the only one to receive a  blow. His death is the result of God&rsquo;s providence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  man&rsquo;s neglect,&rdquo; muttered the constable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no money in any of their pockets, or on either wasted figure,&rdquo; the detective  continued, after a few minutes of silent search. &ldquo;It must be hidden in the  room, or&mdash;look through that Bible, sirs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner, glad of an opportunity to do something, took up the book, and ran  hurriedly through its leaves, then turned it and shook it out over the table.  Nothing fell out; the bills must be looked for elsewhere.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  furniture is scanty,&rdquo; Abel observed, with an inquiring look about him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,  very scanty,&rdquo; assented the constable, still with that biting remorse at his  heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is nothing in this cupboard,&rdquo; pursued the detective, swinging open a door in  the wall, &ldquo;but a set of old china more or less nicked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Abel  started. An old recollection had come up. Some weeks before, he had been  present when James had made an effort to sell this set. They were all in Warner&rsquo;s  store, and James Zabel (he could see his easy attitude yet, and hear the  off-hand tones with which he tried to carry the affair off) had said, quite as  if he had never thought of it before: &ldquo;By the by, I have a set of china at the  house which came over in the <i>Mayflower</i>.  John likes it, but it has grown to be an eyesore to me, and if you hear of  anybody who has a fancy for such things, send him up to the cottage. I will let  it go for a song.&rdquo; Nobody answered, and James disappeared. It was the last  time, Abel remembered, that he had been seen about town.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t stand it,&rdquo; cried the lad. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it. If they died of hunger I  must know it. I am going to take a look at their larder.&rdquo; And before anyone  could stop him he dashed to the rear of the house.</p>
  <p>The  constable would have liked to follow him, but he looked about the walls of the  room instead. John and James had been fond of pictures and had once indulged  their fancy to the verge of extravagance, but there were no pictures on the  walls now, nor was there so much as a candlestick on the empty and dust-covered  mantel. Only on a bracket in one corner there was a worthless trinket made out  of cloves and beads which had doubtless been given them by some country damsel  in their young bachelor days. But nothing of any value anywhere, and Mr. Fenton  felt that he now knew why they had made so many visits to Boston at one time,  and why they always returned with a thinner valise than they took away. He was  still dwelling on the thought of the depths of misery to which highly respectable  folks can sink without the knowledge of the nearest neighbours, when Abel came  back looking greatly troubled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the saddest thing I ever heard of,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;These men must have been  driven wild by misery. This room is sumptuous in comparison to the ones at the  back; and as for the pantry, there is not even a scrap there a mouse could eat.  I struck a match and glanced into the flour barrel. It looked as if it had been  licked. I declare, it makes a fellow feel sick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  constable, with a shudder, withdrew towards the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  atmosphere here is stifling,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I must have a breath of out-door air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  he was not destined to any such immediate relief. As he moved down the hall the  form of a man darkened the doorway and he heard an anxious voice exclaim:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Mr. Fenton, is that you? I have been looking for you everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Sweetwater, the young man who had previously shown so much anxiety to be of  service to the coroner.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Fenton looked displeased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how came you to find me here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  some men saw you take this road, and I guessed the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  ah, very good. And what do you want, Sweetwater?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man, who was glowing with pride and all alive with an enthusiasm which he  had kept suppressed for hours, slipped up to the constable and whispered in his  ear: &ldquo;I have made a discovery, sir. I know you will excuse the presumption, but  I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to keep quiet and follow in that other fellow&rsquo;s wake. I  had to make investigations on my own account, and&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;stammering in his  eagerness &ldquo;they have been successful, sir. I have found out who was the  murderer of Agatha Webb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  constable, compassionating the disappointment in store for him, shook his head,  with a solemn look toward the room from which he had just emerged. &ldquo;You are  late, Sweetwater,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We have found him out ourselves, and he lies  there, dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was dark where they stood and Sweetwater&rsquo;s back was to the moonlight, so that  the blank look which must have crossed his face at this announcement was lost  upon the constable. But his consternation was evident from the way he thrust  out either hand to steady himself against the walls of the narrow passageway,  and Mr. Fenton was not at all surprised to hear him stammer out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!  He! Whom do you mean by he, Mr. Fenton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man in whose house we now are,&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;Is there anyone else who  can be suspected of this crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  gave a gulp that seemed to restore him to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are two men living here, both very good men, I have heard. Which of them do you  mean, and why do you think that either John or James Zabel killed Agatha Webb?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  reply Mr. Fenton drew him toward the room in which such a great heart-tragedy  had taken place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;and see what can happen in a Christian land, in the midst of  Christian people living not fifty rods away. These men are dead, Sweetwater,  dead from hunger. The loaf of bread you see there came too late. It was bought  with a twenty-dollar bill, taken from Agatha Webb&rsquo;s cupboard drawer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  to whom the whole scene seemed like some horrible nightmare, stared at the  figure of James lying on the floor, and then at the figure of John seated at  the table, as if his mind had failed to take in the constable&rsquo;s words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;  he murmured. &ldquo;Dead! John and James Zabel. What will happen next? 
    Is the town under a curse?&rdquo; And he fell on his knees before the 
    prostrate form of James, only to start up again as he saw the eyes of 
    Knapp resting on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  he muttered, &ldquo;the detective!&rdquo; And after giving the man from Boston a close look  he turned toward Mr. Fenton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said something about this good old man having killed Agatha Webb. 
    What was it? I was too dazed to take it in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Fenton, not understanding the young man&rsquo;s eagerness, but willing enough to  enlighten him as to the situation, told him what reasons there were for  ascribing the crime in the Webb cottage to the mad need of these starving men.  Sweetwater listened with open eyes and confused bearing, only controlling  himself when his eyes by chance fell upon the quiet figure of the detective,  now moving softly to and fro through the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why murder when he could have had his loaf for the asking?&rdquo; remonstrated  Sweetwater. &ldquo;Agatha Webb would have gone without a meal any time to feed a  wandering tramp; how much more to supply the necessities of two of her oldest  and dearest friends!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  remarked Fenton, &ldquo;but you forget or perhaps never knew that the master passion  of these men was pride. James Zabel ask for bread! I can much sooner imagine him  stealing it; yes, or striking a blow for it, so that the blow shut forever the  eyes that saw him do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t believe your own words, Mr. Fenton. How can you?&rdquo; Sweetwater&rsquo;s hand was  on the breast of the accused man as he spoke, and his manner was almost solemn.  &ldquo;You must not take it for granted,&rdquo; he went on, his green eyes twinkling with a  curious light, &ldquo;that all wisdom comes from Boston. We in Sutherlandtown have  some sparks of it, if they have not yet been recognised. You are satisfied&rdquo;&mdash;here  he addressed himself to Knapp&mdash;&ldquo;that the blow which killed Agatha Webb was  struck by this respectable old man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Knapp  smiled as if a child had asked him this question; but he answered him  good-humouredly enough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see the dagger lying here with which the deed was done, and you see the bread  that was bought from Loton with a twenty-dollar bill of Agatha Webb&rsquo;s money. In  these you can read my answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  evidence,&rdquo; acknowledged Sweetwater&mdash;&ldquo;very good evidence, especially when we  remember that Mr. Crane met an old man rushing from her gateway with something  glittering in his hand. I never was so beat in my life, and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;if I  could have a few minutes of quiet thought all by myself I am certain I could  show you that there is more to this matter than you think. Indeed, I know that  there is, but I do not like to give my reasons till I have conquered the  difficulties presented by these men having had the twenty-dollar bill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  fellow is this?&rdquo; suddenly broke in Knapp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fiddler, a nobody,&rdquo; quietly whispered Mr. Fenton in his ear.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  heard him and changed in a twinkling from the uncertain, half-baffled, wholly  humble person they had just seen, to a man with a purpose strong enough to make  him hold up his head with the best.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a musician,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;and I play on the violin for money whenever the  occasion offers, something which you will yet congratulate yourselves upon if  you wish to reach the root of this mysterious and dastardly crime. But that I  am a nobody I deny, and I even dare to hope that you will agree with me in this  estimate of myself before this very night is over. Only give me an opportunity  for considering this subject, and the permission to walk for a few minutes  about this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is my prerogative,&rdquo; protested the detective firmly, but without any display of  feeling. &ldquo;I am the man employed to pick up whatever clews the place may  present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you picked up all that are to be found in this room?&rdquo; asked 
    Sweetwater calmly.</p>
  <p>Knapp  shrugged his shoulders. He was very well satisfied with himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  give me a chance,&rdquo; prayed Sweetwater. &ldquo;Mr. Fenton,&rdquo; he urged more earnestly, &ldquo;I  am not the fool you take me for. I feel, I know, I have a genius for this kind  of thing, and though I am not prepossessing to look at, and though I do play  the fiddle, I swear there are depths to this affair which none of you have as  yet sounded. Sirs, where are the nine hundred and eighty dollars in bills which  go to make up the clean thousand that was taken from the small drawer at the  back of Agatha Webb&rsquo;s cupboard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are in some secret hiding-place, no doubt, which we will presently come upon as  we go through the house,&rdquo; answered Knapp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Umph!  Then I advise you to put your hand on them as soon as possible,&rdquo; retorted  Sweetwater. &ldquo;I will confine myself to going over the ground you have already  investigated.&rdquo; And with a sudden ignoring of the others&rsquo; presence, which could  only have sprung from an intense egotism or from an overwhelming belief in his  own theory, he began an investigation of the room that threw the other&rsquo;s more  commonplace efforts entirely in the shade.</p>
  <p>Knapp,  with a slight compression of his lips, which was the sole expression of anger  he ever allowed himself, took up his hat and made his bow to Mr. Fenton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that the sympathy of those present is with local talent. Let  local talent work, then, sir, and when you feel the need of a man of training  and experience, send to the tavern on the docks, where I will be found till I  am notified that my services are no longer required.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no!&rdquo; protested Mr. Fenton. &ldquo;This boy&rsquo;s enthusiasm will soon evaporate. Let him  fuss away if he will. His petty business need not interrupt us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he understands himself,&rdquo; whispered Knapp. &ldquo;I should think he had been on our  own force for years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the more reason to see what he&rsquo;s up to. Wait, if only to satisfy your  curiosity. I shan&rsquo;t let many minutes go by before I pull him up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Knapp,  who was really of a cold and unimpressionable temperament, refrained from  further argument, and confined himself to watching the young man, whose  movements seemed to fascinate him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Astonishing!&rdquo;  Mr. Fenton heard him mutter to himself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s more like an eel than a man.&rdquo; And  indeed the way Sweetwater wound himself out and in through that room, seeing  everything that came under his eye, was a sight well worth any professional&rsquo;s  attention. Pausing before the dead man on the floor, he held the lantern close  to the white, worn face. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said he, picking something from the long beard, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s  a crumb of that same bread. Did you see that, Mr. Knapp?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  question was so sudden and so sharp that the detective came near replying to  it; but he bethought himself, and said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  settles which of the two gnawed the loaf,&rdquo; continued Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>The  next minute he was hovering over the still more pathetic figure of 
    John, sitting in the chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sad!  Sad!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  he laid his finger on a small rent in the old man&rsquo;s faded vest. &ldquo;You saw this,  of course,&rdquo; said he, with a quick glance over his shoulder at the silent  detective.</p>
  <p>No  answer, as before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a new slit,&rdquo; declared the officious youth, looking closer, &ldquo;and&mdash;yes&mdash;there&rsquo;s  blood on its edges. Here, take the lantern, Mr. Fenton, I must see how the skin  looks underneath. Oh, gentlemen, no shirt! The poorest dockhand has a shirt!  Brocaded vest and no shirt; but he&rsquo;s past our pity now. Ah, only a bruise over  the heart. Sirs, what did you make out of this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  none of them had even seen it, Knapp was not the only one to remain silent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I tell you what I make out of it?&rdquo; said the lad, rising hurriedly from the  floor, which he had as hurriedly examined. &ldquo;This old man has tried to take his  life with the dagger already wet with the blood of Agatha Webb. But his arm was  too feeble. The point only pierced the vest, wiping off a little blood in its  passage, then the weapon fell from his hand and struck the floor, as you will  see by the fresh dent in the old board I am standing on. Have you anything to  say against these simple deductions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  the detective opened his lips and might have spoken, but 
    Sweetwater gave him no chance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is the letter he was writing?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Have any of you seen any paper  lying about here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was not writing,&rdquo; objected Knapp; &ldquo;he was reading; reading in that old Bible  you see there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  caught up the book, looked it over, and laid it down, with that same curious  twinkle of his eye they had noted in him before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was writing,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;See, here is his pencil.&rdquo; And he showed them the  battered end of a small lead-pencil lying on the edge of his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Writing  at some time,&rdquo; admitted Knapp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Writing  just before the deed,&rdquo; insisted Sweetwater. &ldquo;Look at the fingers of his right  hand. They have not moved since the pencil fell out of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  letter, or whatever it was, shall be looked for,&rdquo; declared the constable.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  bowed, his eyes roving restlessly into every nook and corner of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;James  was the stronger of the two,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;yet there is no evidence that he  made any attempt at suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that it was suicide John attempted?&rdquo; asked someone. &ldquo;Why might not  the dagger have fallen from James&rsquo;s hand in an effort to kill his brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  the dent in the floor would have been to the right of the chair instead of to  the left,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Besides, James&rsquo;s hand would not have failed so  utterly, since he had strength to pick up the weapon afterward and lay it where  you found it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  we found it lying on the table,&rdquo; observed Abel, scratching his head in forced  admiration of his old schoolmate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  easy, very easy,&rdquo; Sweetwater remarked, seeing the wonder in every eye. &ldquo;Matters  like those are for a child&rsquo;s reading, but what is difficult, and what I find  hard to come by, is how the twenty-dollar bill got into the old man&rsquo;s hand. He  found it here, but how&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Found  it here? How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,  that is a point I will make clear to you later, when I have laid my hand on a  certain clew I am anxiously seeking. You know this is new work for me and I  have to advance warily. Did any of you gentlemen, when you came into this room,  detect the faintest odour of any kind of perfume?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfume?&rdquo;  echoed Abel, with a glance about the musty apartment. &ldquo;Rats, rather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  shook his head with a discouraged air, but suddenly brightened, and stepping  quickly across the floor, paused at one of the windows. It was that one in  which the shade had been drawn.</p>
  <p>Peering  at this shade he gave a grunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must excuse me for a minute,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I have not found what I wanted in this  room and now must look outside for it. Will someone bring the lantern?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will,&rdquo; volunteered Knapp, with grim good humour. Indeed, the situation was  almost ludicrous to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bring  it round the house, then, to the ground under this window,&rdquo; ordered Sweetwater,  without giving any sign that he noticed or even recognised the other&rsquo;s air of  condescension. &ldquo;And, gentlemen, please don&rsquo;t follow. It&rsquo;s footsteps I am after,  and the fewer we make ourselves, the easier will it be for me to establish the  clew I am after.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Fenton stared. What had got into the fellow?</p>
  <p>The  lantern gone, the room resumed its former appearance.</p>
  <p>Abel,  who had been much struck by Sweetwater&rsquo;s mysterious manoeuvres, drew near Dr.  Talbot and whispered in his ear: &ldquo;We might have done without that fellow from  Boston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To  which the coroner replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  so, and perhaps not. Sweetwater has not yet proved his case; let us wait till  he explains himself.&rdquo; Then, turning to the constable, he showed him an  old-fashioned miniature, which he had found lying on James&rsquo;s breast, when he  made his first examination. It was set with pearls and backed with gold and was  worth many meals, for the lack of which its devoted owner had perished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agatha  Webb&rsquo;s portrait,&rdquo; explained Talbot, &ldquo;or rather Agatha Gilchrist&rsquo;s; for I  presume this was painted when she and James were lovers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was certainly a beauty,&rdquo; commented Fenton, as he bent over the miniature in the  moonlight. &ldquo;I do not wonder she queened it over the whole country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must have worn it where I found it for the last forty years,&rdquo; mused the doctor.  &ldquo;And yet men say that love is a fleeting passion. Well, after coming upon this  proof of devotion, I find it impossible to believe James Zabel accountable for  the death of one so fondly remembered. Sweetwater&rsquo;s instinct was truer than  Knapp&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  ours,&rdquo; muttered Fenton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;  interposed Abel, pointing to a bright spot that just then made its appearance  in the dark outline of the shade before alluded to, &ldquo;do you see that hole? It  was the sight of that prick in the shade which sent Sweetwater outside looking  for footprints. See! Now his eye is to it&rdquo; (as the bright spot became suddenly  eclipsed). &ldquo;We are under examination, sirs, and the next thing we will hear is  that he&rsquo;s not the only person who&rsquo;s been peering into this room through that  hole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was so far right that the first words of Sweetwater on his re-entrance were: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all O. K., sirs. I have found my missing clew. James Zabel was not the only  person who came up here from the Webb cottage last night.&rdquo; And turning to  Knapp, who was losing some of his supercilious manner, he asked, with  significant emphasis: &ldquo;If, of the full amount stolen from Agatha Webb, you  found twenty dollars in the possession of one man and nine hundred and eighty  dollars in the possession of another, upon which of the two would you fix as  the probable murderer of the good woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon  him who held the lion&rsquo;s share, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good; then it is not in this cottage you will find the person most wanted. You  must look&mdash;But there! first let me give you a glimpse of the money. Is there  anyone here ready to accompany me in search of it? I shall have to take him a  quarter of a mile farther up-hill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have seen the money? You know where it is?&rdquo; asked Dr. Talbot and 
    Mr. Fenton in one breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,  I can put my hand on it in ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this unexpected and somewhat startling statement Knapp looked at Dr. 
    Talbot and Dr. Talbot looked at the constable, but only the last spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is saying a good deal. But no matter. I am willing to credit the assertion.  Lead on, Sweetwater; I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  seemed to grow an inch taller in his satisfied vanity. &ldquo;And 
    Dr. Talbot?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
  <p>But  the coroner&rsquo;s duty held him to the house and he decided not to accompany them.  Knapp and Abel, however, yielded to the curiosity which had been aroused by  these extraordinary promises, and presently the four men mentioned started on  their small expedition up the hill.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  headed the procession. He had admonished silence, and his wish in this regard  was so well carried out that they looked more like a group of spectres moving  up the moon-lighted road, than a party of eager and impatient men. Not till  they turned into the main thoroughfare did anyone speak. Then Abel could no  longer restrain himself and he cried out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are going to Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Sweetwater quickly undeceived him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;only into the woods opposite his house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  at this Mr. Fenton drew him back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you sure of yourself?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have you really seen this money and is it  concealed in this forest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have seen the money,&rdquo; Sweetwater solemnly declared, &ldquo;and it is hidden in these  woods.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Fenton dropped his arm, and they moved on till their way was blocked by the  huge trunk of a fallen tree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is here we are to look,&rdquo; cried Sweetwater, pausing and motioning
Knapp to turn his lantern on the spot where the shadows lay thickest. &ldquo;Now, what do you see?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  upturned roots of a great tree,&rdquo; said Mr. Fenton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  under them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  hole, or, rather, the entrance to one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good; the money is in that hole. Pull it out, Mr. Fenton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  assurance with which Sweetwater spoke was such that Mr. Fenton at once stooped  and plunged his hand into the hole. But when, after a hurried search, he drew  it out again, there was nothing in it; the place was empty. Sweetwater stared  at Mr. Fenton amazed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you find anything?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a roll of bills in that hole?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  was the gloomy answer, after a renewed attempt and a second disappointment. &ldquo;There  is nothing to be found here. You are labouring under some misapprehension,  Sweetwater.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I can&rsquo;t be. I saw the money; saw it in the hand of the person who hid it there.  Let me look for it, constable. I will not give up the search till I have turned  the place topsy-turvy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kneeling  down in Mr. Fenton&rsquo;s place, he thrust his hand into the hole. On either side of  him peered the faces of Mr. Fenton and Knapp. (Abel had slipped away at a  whisper from Sweetwater.) They were lit with a similar expression of anxious  interest and growing doubt. His own countenance was a study of conflicting and  by no means cheerful emotions. Suddenly his aspect changed. With a quick twist  of his lithe, if awkward, body, he threw himself lengthwise on the ground, and  began tearing at the earth inside the hole, like a burrowing animal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot be mistaken. Nothing will make me believe it is not here. It has simply  been buried deeper than I thought. Ah! What did I tell you? See here! And see  here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bringing  his hands into the full blaze of the light, he showed two rolls of new, crisp  bills.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were lying under half a foot of earth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but if they had been buried  as deep as Grannie Fuller&rsquo;s well, I&rsquo;d have unearthed them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meantime  Mr. Fenton was rapidly counting one roll and Knapp the other. The result was an  aggregate sum of nine hundred and eighty dollars, just the amount Sweetwater  had promised to show them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  good stroke of business,&rdquo; cried Mr. Fenton. &ldquo;And now, Sweetwater, whose is the  hand that buried this treasure? Nothing is to be gained by preserving silence  on this point any longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instantly  the young man became very grave. With a quick glance around which seemed to  embrace the secret recesses of the forest rather than the eager faces bending  towards him, he lowered his voice and quietly said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  hand that buried this money under the roots of this old tree is the same which  you saw pointing downward at the spot of blood in Agatha Webb&rsquo;s front yard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not mean Amabel Page!&rdquo; cried Mr. Fenton, with natural surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do; and I am glad it is you who have named her.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
    The Slippers, The Flower, And What Sweetwater Made Of Them</b></h2>
  <p>A  half-hour later these men were all closeted with Dr. Talbot in the Zabel  kitchen. Abel had rejoined them, and Sweetwater was telling his story with  great earnestness and no little show of pride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,  when I charge a young woman of respectable appearance and connections with such  a revolting crime as murder, I do so with good reason, as I hope presently to  make plain to you all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,  on the night and at the hour Agatha Webb was killed, I was playing with four  other musicians in Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s hallway. From the place where I sat I could  see what went on in the parlour and also have a clear view of the passageway  leading down to the garden door. As the dancing was going on in the parlour I  naturally looked that way most, and this is how I came to note the eagerness  with which, during the first part of the evening, Frederick Sutherland and  Amabel Page came together in the quadrilles and country dances. Sometimes she  spoke as she passed him, and sometimes he answered, but not always, although he  never failed to show he was pleased with her or would have been if  something&mdash;perhaps it was his lack of confidence in her, sirs&mdash;had not stood in  the way of a perfect understanding. She seemed to notice that he did not always  respond, and after a while showed less inclination to speak herself, though she  did not fail to watch him, and that intently. But she did not watch him any  more closely than I did her, though I little thought at the time what would  come of my espionage. She wore a white dress and white shoes, and was as  coquettish and seductive as the evil one makes them. Suddenly I missed her. She  was in the middle of the dance one minute and entirely out of it the next.  Naturally I supposed her to have slipped aside with Frederick Sutherland, but  he was still in sight, looking so pale and so abstracted, however, I was sure  the young miss was up to some sort of mischief. But what mischief? Watching and  waiting, but no longer confining my attention to the parlour, I presently  espied her stealing along the passageway I have mentioned, carrying a long  cloak which she rolled up and hid behind the open door. Then she came back  humming a gay little song which didn&rsquo;t deceive me for a moment. &lsquo;Good!&rsquo; thought  I, &lsquo;she and that cloak will soon join company.&rsquo; And they did. As we were  playing the Harebell mazurka I again caught sight of her stealthy white figure  in that distant doorway. Seizing the cloak, she wrapped it round her, and with  just one furtive look backwards, seen, I warrant, by no one but myself, she  vanished in the outside dark. &lsquo;Now to note who follows her!&rsquo; But nobody  followed her. This struck me as strange, and having a natural love for  detective work, in spite of my devotion to the arts, I consulted the clock at  the foot of the stairs, and noting that it was half-past eleven, scribbled the  hour on the margin of my music, with the intention of seeing how long my lady  would linger outside alone. Gentlemen, it was two hours before I saw her face  again. How she got back into the house I do not know. It was not by the garden  door, for my eye seldom left it; yet at or near half-past one I heard her voice  on the stair above me and saw her descend and melt into the crowd as if she had  not been absent from it for more than five minutes. A half-hour later I saw her  with Frederick again. They were dancing, but not with the same spirit as  before, and even while I watched them they separated. Now where was Miss Page  during those two long hours? I think I know, and it is time I unburdened myself  to the police.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  first I must inform you of a small discovery I made while the dance was still  in progress. Miss Page had descended the stairs, as I have said, from what I  now know to have been her own room. Her dress was, in all respects, the same as  before, with one exception&mdash;her white slippers had been exchanged for blue ones.  This seemed to show that they had been rendered unserviceable, or at least  unsightly, by the walk she had taken. This in itself was not remarkable nor  would her peculiar escapade have made more than a temporary impression upon my  curiosity if she had not afterward shown in my presence such an unaccountable  and extraordinary interest in the murder which had taken place in the town  below during the very hours of her absence from Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s ball. This, in  consideration of her sex, and her being a stranger to the person attacked, was  remarkable, and, though perhaps I had no business to do what I did, I no sooner  saw the house emptied of master and servants than I stole softly back, and  climbed the stairs to her room. Had no good followed this intrusion, which, I  am quite ready to acknowledge, was a trifle presumptuous, I would have held my  peace in regard to it; but as I did make a discovery there, which has, as I  believe, an important bearing on this affair, I have forced myself to mention  it. The lights in the house having been left burning, I had no difficulty in  finding her apartment. I knew it by the folderols scattered about. But I did  not stop to look at them. I was on a search for her slippers, and presently  came upon them, thrust behind an old picture in the dimmest corner of the room.  Taking them down, I examined them closely. They were not only soiled,  gentlemen, but dreadfully cut and rubbed. In short, they were ruined, and,  thinking that the young lady herself would be glad to be rid of them, I quietly  put them into my pocket, and carried them to my own home. Abel has just been  for them, so you can see them for yourselves, and if your judgment coincides  with mine, you will discover something more on them than mud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Talbot, though he stared a little at the young man&rsquo;s confessed theft, took the  slippers Abel was holding out and carefully turned them over. They were, as  Sweetwater had said, grievously torn and soiled, and showed, beside several  deep earth-stains, a mark or two of a bright red colour, quite unmistakable in  its character.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blood,&rdquo;  declared the coroner. &ldquo;There is no doubt about it. Miss Page was where blood  was spilled last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have another proof against her,&rdquo; Sweetwater went on, in full enjoyment of his  prominence amongst these men, who, up to now, had barely recognised his  existence. &ldquo;When, full of the suspicion that Miss Page had had a hand in the  theft which had taken place at Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s house, if not in the murder that  accompanied it, I hastened down to the scene of the tragedy, I met this young  woman issuing from the front gate. She had just been making herself conspicuous  by pointing out a trail of blood on the grass plot. Dr. Talbot, who was there,  will remember how she looked on that occasion; but I doubt if he noticed how  Abel here looked, or so much as remarked the faded flower the silly boy had  stuck in his buttonhole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;me  if I did!&rdquo; ejaculated the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  that flower has a very important bearing on this case. He had found it, as he  will tell you, on the floor near Batsy&rsquo;s skirts, and as soon as I saw it in his  coat, I bade him take it out and keep it, for, gentlemen, it was a very  uncommon flower, the like of which can only be found in this town in Mr.  Sutherland&rsquo;s conservatory. I remember seeing such a one in Miss Page&rsquo;s hair,  early in the evening. Have you that flower about you, Abel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Abel  had, and being filled with importance too, showed it to the doctor and to Mr.  Fenton. It was withered and faded in hue, but it was unmistakably an orchid of  the rarest description.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was lying near Batsy,&rdquo; explained Abel. &ldquo;I drew Mr. Fenton&rsquo;s attention to it at  the time, but he scarcely noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will make up for my indifference now,&rdquo; said that gentleman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should have been shown that flower,&rdquo; put in Knapp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you should,&rdquo; acknowledged Sweetwater, &ldquo;but when the detective instinct is  aroused it is hard for a man to be just to his rivals; besides, I was otherwise  occupied. I had Miss Page to watch. Happily for me, you had decided that she  should not be allowed to leave town till after the inquest, and so my task  became easy. This whole day I have spent in sight of Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s house,  and at nightfall I was rewarded by detecting her end a prolonged walk in the  garden by a hurried dash into the woods opposite. I followed her and noted  carefully all that she did. As she had just seen Frederick Sutherland and Miss  Halliday disappear up the road together, she probably felt free to do as she  liked, for she walked very directly to the old tree we have just come from, and  kneeling down beside it pulled from the hole underneath something which rattled  in her hand with that peculiar sound we associate with fresh bank-notes. I had  approached her as near as I dared, and was peering around a tree trunk, when  she stooped down again and plunged both hands into the hole. She remained in  this position so long that I did not know what to make of it. But she rose at  last and turned toward home, laughing to herself in a wicked but pleased way  that did not tend to make me think any more of her. The moon was shining very  brightly by this time and I could readily perceive every detail of her person.  She held her hands out before her and shook them more than once as she trod by  me, so I was sure there was nothing in them, and this is why I was so confident  we should find the money still in the hole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I saw her enter the house, I set out to find you, but the court-house room was  empty, and it was a long time before I learned where to look for you. But at  last a fellow at Brighton&rsquo;s corner said he saw four men go by on their way to  Zabel&rsquo;s cottage, and on the chance of finding you amongst them, I turned down  here. The shock you gave me in announcing that you had discovered the murderer  of Agatha Webb knocked me over for a moment, but now I hope you realise, as I  do, that this wretched man could never have had an active hand in her death,  notwithstanding the fact that one of the stolen bills has been found in his  possession. For, and here is my great point, the proof is not wanting that Miss  Page visited this house as well as Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s during her famous escapade; or  at least stood under the window beneath which I have just been searching. A  footprint can be seen there, sirs, a very plain footprint, and if Dr. Talbot  will take the trouble to compare it with the slipper he holds in his hand, he  will find it to have been made by the foot that wore that slipper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner, with a quick glance from the slipper in his hand up to 
    Sweetwater&rsquo;s eager face, showed a decided disposition to make the 
    experiment thus suggested. But Mr. Fenton, whose mind was full of the 
    Zabel tragedy, interrupted them with the question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how do you explain by this hypothesis the fact of James Zabel trying to pass  one of the twenty-dollar bills stolen from Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s cupboard? Do you  consider Miss Page generous enough to give him that money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ask <i>me</i> that, Mr. Fenton. Do you wish to know what <i>I</i> think of the  connection between these two great tragedies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  you have earned a voice in this matter; speak, Sweetwater.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, I think Miss Page has made an effort to throw the blame of her own  misdoing on one or both of these unfortunate old men. She is sufficiently  cold-blooded and calculating to do so; and circumstances certainly favoured  her. Shall I show how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Fenton consulted Knapp, who nodded his head. The Boston detective was not  without curiosity as to how Sweetwater would prove the case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old  James Zabel had seen his brother sinking rapidly from inanition; this their  condition amply shows. He was weak himself, but John was weaker, and in a  moment of desperation he rushed out to ask a crumb of bread from Agatha Webb,  or possibly&mdash;for I have heard some whispers of an old custom of theirs to join  Philemon at his yearly merry-making and so obtain in a natural way the bite for  himself and brother he perhaps had not the courage to ask for outright. But  death had been in the Webb cottage before him, which awful circumstance, acting  on his already weakened nerves, drove him half insane from the house and sent  him wandering blindly about the streets for a good half-hour before he  reappeared in his own house. How do I know this? From a very simple fact. Abel  here has been to inquire, among other things, if Mr. Crane remembers the tune  we were playing at the great house when he came down the main street from  visiting old widow Walker. Fortunately he does, for the trip, trip, trip in it  struck his fancy, and he has found himself humming it over more than once  since. Well, that waltz was played by us at a quarter after midnight, which  fixes the time of the encounter at Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s gateway pretty accurately. But,  as you will soon see, it was ten minutes to one before James Zabel knocked at  Loton&rsquo;s door. How do I know this? By the same method of reasoning by which I  determined the time of Mr. Crane&rsquo;s encounter. Mrs. Loton was greatly pleased  with the music played that night, and had all her windows open in order to hear  it, and she says we were playing &lsquo;Money Musk&rsquo; when that knocking came to  disturb her. Now, gentlemen, we played &lsquo;Money Musk&rsquo; just before we were called  out to supper, and as we went to supper promptly at one, you can see just how  my calculation was made. Thirty-five minutes, then, passed between the moment  James Zabel was seen rushing from Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s gateway and that in which he  appeared at Loton&rsquo;s bakery, demanding a loaf of bread, and offering in exchange  one of the bills which had been stolen from the murdered woman&rsquo;s drawer.  Thirty-five minutes! And he and his brother were starving. Does it look, then,  as if that money was in his possession when he left Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s house? Would  any man who felt the pangs of hunger as he did, or who saw a brother perishing  for food before his eyes, allow thirty-five minutes to elapse before he made  use of the money that rightfully or wrongfully had come into his hand? No; and  so I say that he did not have it when Mr. Crane met him. That, instead of  committing crime to obtain it, he found it in his own home, lying on his table,  when, after his frenzied absence, he returned to tell his dreadful news to the brother  he had left behind him. But how did it come there? you ask. Gentlemen, remember  the footprints under the window. Amabel Page brought it. Having seen or perhaps  met this old man roaming in or near the Webb cottage during the time she was  there herself, she conceived the plan of throwing upon him the onus of the  crime she had herself committed, and with a slyness to be expected from one so  crafty, stole up to his home, made a hole in the shade hanging over an open  window, looked into the room where John sat, saw that he was there alone and  asleep, and, creeping in by the front door, laid on the table beside him the  twenty-dollar bill and the bloody dagger with which she had just slain Agatha  Webb. Then she stole out again, and in twenty minutes more was leading the  dance in Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s parlour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  reasoned!&rdquo; murmured Abel, expecting the others to echo him. But, though Mr.  Fenton and Dr. Talbot looked almost convinced, they said nothing, while Knapp,  of course, was quiet as an oyster.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  with an easy smile calculated to hide his disappointment, went on as if  perfectly satisfied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile  John awakes, sees the dagger, and thinks to end his misery with it, but finds  himself too feeble. The cut in his vest, the dent in the floor, prove this, but  if you call for further proof, a little fact, which some, if not all, of you  seem to have overlooked, will amply satisfy you that this one at least of my  conclusions is correct. Open the Bible, Abel; open it, not to shake it for what  will never fall from between its leaves, but to find in the Bible itself the  lines I have declared to you he wrote as a dying legacy with that tightly  clutched pencil. Have you found them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  was Abel&rsquo;s perplexed retort; &ldquo;I cannot see any sign of writing on flyleaf or  margin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  those the only blank places in the sacred book? Search the leaves devoted to  the family record. Now! what do you find there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Knapp,  who was losing some of his indifference, drew nearer and read for himself the  scrawl which now appeared to every eye on the discoloured page which Abel here  turned uppermost.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Almost  illegible,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;one can just make out these words: &lsquo;Forgive me,  James&mdash;tried to use dagger&mdash;found lying&mdash;but hand wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;dying without&mdash;don&rsquo;t  grieve&mdash;true men&mdash;haven&rsquo;t disgraced ourselves&mdash;God bless&mdash;&rsquo; That is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  effort must have overcome him,&rdquo; resumed Sweetwater in a voice from which he  carefully excluded all signs of secret triumph, &ldquo;and when James returned, as he  did a few minutes later, he was evidently unable to ask questions, even if John  was in a condition to answer them. But the fallen dagger told its own story,  for James picked it up and put it back on the table, and it was at this minute  he saw, what John had not, the twenty-dollar bill lying there with its promise  of life and comfort. Hope revives; he catches up the bill, flies down to Loton&rsquo;s,  procures a loaf of bread, and comes frantically back, gnawing it as he runs;  for his own hunger is more than he can endure. Re-entering his brother&rsquo;s  presence, he rushes forward with the bread. But the relief has come too late;  John has died in his absence; and James, dizzy with the shock, reels back and  succumbs to his own misery. Gentlemen, have you anything to say in  contradiction to these various suppositions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  a moment Dr. Talbot, Mr. Fenton, and even Knapp stood silent; then the last  remarked, with pardonable dryness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  this is ingenious, but, unfortunately, it is up set by a little fact which you  yourself have overlooked. Have you examined attentively the dagger of which you  have so often spoken, Mr. Sweetwater?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  as I would like to, but I noticed it had blood on its edge, and was of the  shape and size necessary to inflict the wound from which Mrs. Webb died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good, but there is something else of interest to be observed on it. Fetch it,  Abel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Abel,  hurrying from the room, soon brought back the weapon in question. Sweetwater,  with a vague sense of disappointment disturbing him, took it eagerly and  studied it very closely. But he only shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bring  it nearer to the light,&rdquo; suggested Knapp, &ldquo;and examine the little scroll near  the top of the handle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  did so, and at once changed colour. In the midst of the scroll were two very  small but yet perfectly distinct letters; they were J. Z.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did Amabel Page come by a dagger marked with the Zabel initials?&rdquo; questioned  Knapp. &ldquo;Do you think her foresight went so far as to provide herself with a  dagger ostensibly belonging to one of these brothers? And then, have you  forgotten that when Mr. Crane met the old man at Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s gateway he saw in  his hand something that glistened? Now what was that, if not this dagger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  was more disturbed than he cared to acknowledge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  just shows my lack of experience,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;I thought I had turned this  subject so thoroughly over in my mind that no one could bring an objection  against it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Knapp  shook his head and smiled. &ldquo;Young enthusiasts like yourself are great at  forming theories which well-seasoned men like myself must regard as fantastical.  However,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;there is no doubt that Miss Page was a witness to, even  if she has not profited by, the murder we have been considering. But, with this  palpable proof of the Zabels&rsquo; direct connection with the affair, I would not  recommend her arrest as yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  should be under surveillance, though,&rdquo; intimated the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  certainly,&rdquo; acquiesced Knapp.</p>
  <p>As  for Sweetwater, he remained silent till the opportunity came for him to whisper  apart to Dr. Talbot, when he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  all the palpable proof of which Mr. Knapp speaks&mdash;the J. Z. on the dagger, and  the possibility of this being the object he was seen carrying out of Philemon  Webb&rsquo;s gate&mdash;I maintain that this old man in his moribund condition never struck  the blow that killed Agatha Webb. He hadn&rsquo;t strength enough, even if his  lifelong love for her had not been sufficient to prevent him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner looked thoughtful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;he hadn&rsquo;t strength enough. But don&rsquo;t expend too much  energy in talk. Wait and see what a few direct questions will elicit from Miss  Page.&rdquo;</p>

    Some Leading Questions</b></h2>
  <p>Frederick  rose early. He had slept but little. The words he had overheard at the end of  the lot the night before were still ringing in his ears. Going down the back  stairs, in his anxiety to avoid Amabel, he came upon one of the stablemen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Been  to the village this morning?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, but Lem has. There&rsquo;s great news there. I wonder if anyone has told Mr.  Sutherland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  news, Jake? I don&rsquo;t think my father is up yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  sir, there were two more deaths in town last night&mdash;the brothers 
    Zabel; and folks do say (Lem heard it a dozen times between the grocery 
    and the fish market) that it was one of these old men who killed Mrs. 
    Webb. The dagger has been found in their house, and most of the money. 
    Why, sir, what&rsquo;s the matter? Are you sick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  made an effort and stood upright. He had nearly fallen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  that is, I am not quite myself. So many horrors, Jake. What did they die of?  You say they are both dead&mdash;both?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, and it&rsquo;s dreadful to think of, but it was hunger, sir. Bread came too  late. Both men are mere skeletons to look at. They have kept themselves close  for weeks now, and nobody knew how bad off they were. I don&rsquo;t wonder it upset  you, sir. We all feel it a bit, and I just dread to tell Mr. Sutherland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  staggered away. He had never in his life been so near mental and physical  collapse. At the threshold of the sitting-room door he met his father. Mr.  Sutherland was looking both troubled and anxious; more so, Frederick thought,  than when he signed the check for him on the previous night. As their eyes met,  both showed embarrassment, but Frederick, whose nerves had been highly strung  by what he had just heard, soon controlled himself, and surveying his father  with forced calmness, began:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is dreadful news, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  his father, intent on his own thought, hurriedly interrupted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  told me yesterday that everything was broken off between you and Miss Page. Yet  I saw you reenter the house together last night a little while after I gave you  the money you asked for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, and it must have had a bad appearance. I entreat you, however, to believe  that this meeting between Miss Page and myself was against my wish, and that  the relations between us have not been affected by anything that passed between  us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to hear it, my son. You could not do worse by yourself than to return  to your old devotion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with you, sir.&rdquo; And then, because he could not help it, 
    Frederick inquired if he had heard the news.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland, evidently startled, asked what news; to which Frederick replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  news about the Zabels. They are both dead, sir,&mdash;dead from hunger. 
    Can you imagine it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was something so different from what his father had expected to hear, that he  did not take it in at first. When he did, his surprise and grief were even  greater than Frederick had anticipated. Seeing him so affected, Frederick, who  thought that the whole truth would be no harder to bear than the half, added  the suspicion which had been attached to the younger one&rsquo;s name, and then stood  back, scarcely daring to be a witness to the outraged feelings which such a  communication could not fail to awaken in one of his father&rsquo;s temperament.</p>
  <p>But  though he thus escaped the shocked look which crossed his father&rsquo;s countenance,  he could not fail to hear the indignant exclamation which burst from his lips,  nor help perceiving that it would take more than the most complete  circumstantial evidence to convince his father of the guilt of men he had known  and respected for so many years.</p>
  <p>For  some reason Frederick experienced great relief at this, and was bracing himself  to meet the fire of questions which his statement must necessarily call forth,  when the sound of approaching steps drew the attention of both towards a party  of men coming up the hillside.</p>
  <p>Among  them was Mr. Courtney, Prosecuting Attorney for the district, and as Mr.  Sutherland recognised him he sprang forward, saying, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Courtney; he will  explain this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  followed, anxious and bewildered, and soon had the doubtful pleasure of seeing  his father enter his study in company with the four men considered to be most  interested in the elucidation of the Webb mystery.</p>
  <p>As  he was lingering in an undecided mood in the small passageway leading up-stairs  he felt the pressure of a finger on his shoulder. Looking up, he met the eyes  of Amabel, who was leaning toward him over the banisters. She was smiling, and,  though her face was not without evidences of physical languor, there was a  charm about her person which would have been sufficiently enthralling to him  twenty-four hours before, but which now caused him such a physical repulsion  that he started back in the effort to rid his shoulder from her disturbing  touch.</p>
  <p>She  frowned. It was an instantaneous expression of displeasure which was soon lost  in one of her gurgling laughs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  my touch so burdensome?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;If the pressure of one finger is so  unbearable to your sensitive nerves, how will you relish the weight of my whole  hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a fierceness in her tone, a purpose in her look, that for the first time in  his struggle with her revealed the full depth of her dark nature. Shrinking  from her appalled, he put up his hand in protest, at which she changed again in  a twinkling, and with a cautious gesture toward the room into which Mr.  Sutherland and his friends had disappeared, she whispered significantly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  may not have another chance to confer together. Understand, then, that it will  not be necessary for you to tell me, in so many words, that you are ready to  link your fortunes to mine; the taking off of the ring you wear and your slow  putting of it on again, in my presence, will be understood by me as a token  that you have reconsidered your present attitude and desire my silence  and&mdash;myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  could not repress a shudder.</p>
  <p>For  an instant he was tempted to succumb on the spot and have the long agony over.  Then his horror of the woman rose to such a pitch that he uttered an  execration, and, turning away from her face, which was rapidly growing  loathsome to him, he ran out of the passageway into the garden, seeing as he  ran a persistent vision of himself pulling off the ring and putting it back  again, under the spell of a look he rebelled against even while he yielded to  its influence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not wear a ring, I will not subject myself to the possibility of obeying  her behest under a sudden stress of fear or fascination,&rdquo; he exclaimed, pausing  by the well-curb and looking over it at his reflection in the water beneath. &ldquo;If  I drop it here I at least lose the horror of doing what she suggests, under  some involuntary impulse.&rdquo; But the thought that the mere absence of the ring  from his finger would not stand in the way of his going through the motions to  which she had just given such significance, deterred him from the sacrifice of  a valuable family jewel, and he left the spot with an air of frenzy such as a  man displays when he feels himself on the verge of a doom he can neither meet  nor avert.</p>
  <p>As  he re-entered the house, he felt himself enveloped in the atmosphere of a  coming crisis. He could hear voices in the upper hall, and amongst them he  caught the accents of her he had learned so lately to fear. Impelled by  something deeper than curiosity and more potent even than dread, he hastened  toward the stairs. When half-way up, he caught sight of Amabel. She was leaning  back against the balustrade that ran across the upper hall, with her hands  gripping the rail on either side of her and her face turned toward the five men  who had evidently issued from Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s study to interview her.</p>
  <p>As  her back was to Frederick he could not judge of the expression of that face  save by the effect it had upon the different men confronting her. But to see  them was enough. From their looks he could perceive that this young girl was in  one of her baffling moods, and that from his father down, not one of the men  present knew what to make of her.</p>
  <p>At  the sound his feet made, a relaxation took place in her body and she lost  something of the defiant attitude she had before maintained. Presently he heard  her voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am willing to answer any questions you may choose to put to me here; but I  cannot consent to shut myself in with you in that small study; I should  suffocate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  could perceive the looks which passed between the five men assembled before  her, and was astonished to note that the insignificant fellow they called  Sweetwater was the first to answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;if you enjoy the publicity of the open hall, no one here will  object. Is not that so, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  two little fingers, which were turned towards Frederick, ran up and down the  rail, making a peculiar rasping noise, which for a moment was the only sound to  be heard. Then Mr. Courtney said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  came you to have the handling of the money taken from Agatha Webb&rsquo;s private  drawer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a startling question, but it seemed to affect Amabel less than it did  Frederick. It made him start, but she only turned her head a trifle aside, so  that the peculiar smile with which she prepared to answer could be seen by  anyone standing below.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  you ask something less leading than that, to begin with,&rdquo; she suggested, in her  high, unmusical voice. &ldquo;From the searching nature of this inquiry, you  evidently believe I have information of an important character to give you  concerning Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s unhappy death. Ask me about that; the other question I  will answer later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  aplomb with which this was said, mixed as it was with a feminine allurement of  more than ordinary subtlety, made Mr. Sutherland frown and Dr. Talbot look  perplexed, but it did not embarrass Mr. Courtney, who made haste to respond in  his dryest accents:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, I am not particular as to what you answer first. A flower worn by you at  the dance was found near Batsy&rsquo;s skirts, before she was lifted up that morning.  Can you explain this, or, rather, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not obliged to, you know,&rdquo; put in Mr. Sutherland, with his inexorable sense  of justice. &ldquo;Still, if you would, it might rob these gentlemen of suspicions  you certainly cannot wish them to entertain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  I say,&rdquo; she remarked slowly, &ldquo;will be as true to the facts as if I stood here  on my oath. I can explain how a flower from my hair came to be in Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s  house, but not how it came to be found under Batsy&rsquo;s feet. That someone else  must clear up.&rdquo; Her little finger, lifted from the rail, pointed toward  Frederick, but no one saw this, unless it was that gentleman himself. &ldquo;I wore a  purple orchid in my hair that night, and there would be nothing strange in its  being afterward picked up in Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s house, because I was in that house at  or near the time she was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  in that house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  as far as the ground floor; no farther.&rdquo; Here the little finger stopped  pointing. &ldquo;I am ready to tell you about it, sirs, and only regret I have  delayed doing so so long, but I wished to be sure it was necessary. Your  presence here and your first question show that it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was suavity in her tone now, not unmixed with candour. Sweetwater did not seem  to relish this, for he moved uneasily and lost a shade of his self-satisfied  attitude. He had still to be made acquainted with all the ins and outs of this  woman&rsquo;s remarkable nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are waiting,&rdquo; suggested Dr. Talbot.</p>
  <p>She  turned to face this new speaker, and Frederick was relieved from the sight of  her tantalising smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell my story simply,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;with the simple suggestion that you  believe me; otherwise you will make a mistake. While I was resting from a dance  the other night, I heard two of the young people talking about the Zabels. One  of them was laughing at the old men, and the other was trying to relate some  half-forgotten story of early love which had been the cause, she thought, of  their strange and melancholy lives. I was listening to them, but I did not take  in much of what they were saying till I heard behind me an irascible voice  exclaiming: &lsquo;You laugh, do you? I wonder if you would laugh so easily if you  knew that these two poor old men haven&rsquo;t had a decent meal in a fortnight?&rsquo; I  didn&rsquo;t know the speaker, but I was thrilled by his words. Not had a good meal,  these men, for a fortnight! I felt as if personally guilty of their suffering,  and, happening to raise my eyes at this minute and seeing through an open door  the bountiful refreshments prepared for us in the supper room, I felt guiltier  than ever. Suddenly I took a resolution. It was a queer one, and may serve to  show you some of the oddities of my nature. Though I was engaged for the next  dance, and though I was dressed in the flimsy garments suitable to the  occasion, I decided to leave the ball and carry some sandwiches down to these  old men. Procuring a bit of paper, I made up a bundle and stole out of the  house without having said a word to anybody of my intention. Not wishing to be  seen, I went out by the garden door, which is at the end of the dark hall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  as the band was playing the Harebell mazurka,&rdquo; interpolated 
    Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>Startled  for the first time from her careless composure by an interruption of which it  was impossible for her at that time to measure either the motive or the  meaning, she ceased to play with her fingers on the baluster rail and let her  eyes rest for a moment on the man who had thus spoken, as if she hesitated  between her desire to annihilate him for his impertinence and a fear of the  cold hate she saw actuating his every word and look. Then she went on, as if no  one had spoken:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ran down the hill recklessly. I was bent on my errand and not at all afraid of  the dark. When I reached that part of the road where the streets branch off, I  heard footsteps in front of me. I had overtaken someone. Slackening my pace, so  that I should not pass this person, whom I instinctively knew to be a man, I  followed him till I came to a high board fence. It was that surrounding Agatha  Webb&rsquo;s house, and when I saw it I could not help connecting the rather stealthy  gait of the man in front of me with a story I had lately heard of the large sum  of money she was known to keep in her house. Whether this was before or after  this person disappeared round the corner I cannot say, but no sooner had I  become certain that he was bent upon entering this house than my impulse to  follow him became greater than my precaution, and turning aside from the direct  path to the Zabels&rsquo;, I hurried down High Street just in time to see the man  enter Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s front gateway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a late hour for visiting, but as the house had lights in both its lower and  upper stories, I should by good rights have taken it for granted that he was an  expected guest and gone on my way to the Zabels&rsquo;. But I did not. The softness  with which this person stepped and the skulking way in which he hesitated at  the front gate aroused my worst fears, and after he had opened that gate and  slid in, I was so pursued by the idea that he was there for no good that I  stepped inside the gate myself and took my stand in the deep shadow cast by the  old pear tree on the right-hand side of the walk. Did anyone speak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a unanimous denial from the five gentlemen before her, yet she did not look  satisfied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought I heard someone make a remark,&rdquo; she repeated, and paused again for a  half-minute, during which her smile was a study, it was so cold and in such  startling contrast to the vivid glances she threw everywhere except behind her  on the landing where Frederick stood listening to her every word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are very much interested,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Courtney. &ldquo;Pray, go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Drawing  her left hand from the balustrade where it had rested, she looked at one of her  fingers with an odd backward gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will,&rdquo; she said, and her tone was hard and threatening. &ldquo;Five minutes, no  longer, passed, when I was startled by a loud and terrible cry from the house,  and looking up at the second-story window from which the sound proceeded, I saw  a woman&rsquo;s figure hanging out in a seemingly pulseless condition. Too terrified  to move, I clung trembling to the tree, hearing and not hearing the shouts and  laughter of a dozen or more men, who at that minute passed by the corner on  their way to the wharves. I was dazed, I was choking, and only came to myself  when, sooner or later, I do not know how soon or how late, a fresh horror  happened. The woman whom I had just seen fall almost from the window was a  serving woman, but when I heard another scream I knew that the mistress of the  house was being attacked, and rivetting my eyes on those windows, I beheld the  shade of one of them thrown back and a hand appear, flinging out something  which fell in the grass on the opposite side of the lawn. Then the shade fell  again, and hearing nothing further, I ran to where the object flung out had  fallen, and feeling for it, found and picked up an old-fashioned dagger,  dripping with blood. Horrified beyond all expression, I dropped the weapon and  retreated into my former place of concealment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I was not satisfied to remain there. A curiosity, a determination even, to see  the man who had committed this dastardly deed, attacked me with such force that  I was induced to leave my hiding-place and even to enter the house where in all  probability he was counting the gains he had just obtained at the price of so  much precious blood. The door, which he had not perfectly closed behind him,  seemed to invite me in, and before I had realised my own temerity, I was  standing in the hall of this ill-fated house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  interest, which up to this moment had been breathless, now expressed itself in  hurried ejaculations and broken words; and Mr. Sutherland, who had listened  like one in a dream, exclaimed eagerly, and in a tone which proved that he, for  the moment at least, believed this more than improbable tale:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you can tell us if Philemon was in the little room at the moment when you  entered the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  everyone there present realised the importance of this question, a general  movement took place and each and all drew nearer as she met their eyes and  answered placidly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  Mr. Webb was sitting in a chair asleep. He was the only person I saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know he never committed this crime,&rdquo; gasped his old friend, in a relief so great  that one and all seemed to share it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I have courage for the rest. Go on, Miss Page.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Miss Page paused again to look at her finger, and give that sideways toss to  her head that seemed so uncalled for by the situation to any who did not know of  the compact between herself and the listening man below.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hate to go back to that moment,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;for when I saw the candles burning  on the table, and the husband of the woman who at that very instant was  possibly breathing her last breath in the room overhead, sitting there in  unconscious apathy, I felt something rise in my throat that made me deathly  sick for a moment. Then I went right in where he was, and was about to shake  his arm and wake him, when I detected a spot of blood on my finger from the  dagger I had handled. That gave me another turn, and led me to wipe off my  finger on his sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a pity you did not wipe off your slippers too,&rdquo; murmured 
    Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>Again  she looked at him, again her eyes opened in terror upon the face of this man,  once so plain and insignificant in her eyes, but now so filled with menace she  inwardly quaked before it, for all her apparent scorn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Slippers,&rdquo;  she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  not your feet as well as your hands pass through the blood on the grass?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  disdained to answer him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have accounted for the blood on my hand,&rdquo; she said, not looking at him, but at  Mr. Courtney. &ldquo;If there is any on my slippers it can be accounted for in the  same way.&rdquo; And she rapidly resumed her narrative. &ldquo;I had no sooner made my  little finger clean I never thought of anyone suspecting the old gentleman when  I heard steps on the stairs and knew that the murderer was coming down, and in  another instant would pass the open door before which I stood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Though  I had been courageous enough up to that minute, I was seized by a sudden panic  at the prospect of meeting face to face one whose hands were perhaps dripping  with the blood of his victim. To confront him there and then might mean death  to me, and I did not want to die, but to live, for I am young, sirs, and not  without a prospect of happiness before me. So I sprang back, and seeing no  other place of concealment in the whole bare room, crouched down in the shadow  of the man you call Philemon. For one, two minutes, I knelt there in a state of  mortal terror, while the feet descended, paused, started to enter the room  where I was, hesitated, turned, and finally left the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Page, wait, wait,&rdquo; put in the coroner. &ldquo;You saw him; you can tell who this man  was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  eagerness of this appeal seemed to excite her. A slight colour appeared in her  cheeks and she took a step forward, but before the words for which they so  anxiously waited could leave her lips, she gave a start and drew back with, an  ejaculation which left a more or less sinister echo in the ears of all who  heard it.</p>
  <p>Frederick  had just shown himself at the top of the staircase.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-morning,  gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, advancing into their midst with an air whose unexpected  manliness disguised his inward agitation. &ldquo;The few words I have just heard Miss  Page say interest me so much, I find it impossible not to join you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Amabel,  upon whose lips a faint complacent smile had appeared as he stepped by her,  glanced up at these words in secret astonishment at the indifference they  showed, and then dropped her eyes to his hands with an intent gaze which seemed  to affect him unpleasantly, for he thrust them immediately behind him, though  he did not lower his head or lose his air of determination.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  my presence here undesirable?&rdquo; he inquired, with a glance towards his father.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  looked as if he thought it was, but he did not presume to say anything, and the  others being too interested in the developments of Miss Page&rsquo;s story to waste  any time on lesser matters, Frederick remained, greatly to Miss Page&rsquo;s evident  satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see this man&rsquo;s face?&rdquo; Mr. Courtney now broke in, in urgent inquiry.</p>
  <p>Her  answer came slowly, after another long look in Frederick&rsquo;s direction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I did not dare to make the effort. I was obliged to crouch too close to the  floor. I simply heard his footsteps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See,  now!&rdquo; muttered Sweetwater, but in so low a tone she did not hear him. &ldquo;She  condemns herself. There isn&rsquo;t a woman living who would fail to look up under  such circumstances, even at the risk of her life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Knapp  seemed to agree with him, but Mr. Courtney, following his one idea, pressed his  former question, saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it an old man&rsquo;s step?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was not an agile one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you did not catch the least glimpse of the man&rsquo;s face or figure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a glimpse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you are in no position to identify him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  by any chance I should hear those same footsteps coming down a flight of  stairs, I think I should be able to recognise them,&rdquo; she allowed, in the  sweetest tones at her command.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  knows it is too late for her to hear those of the two dead Zabels,&rdquo; growled the  man from Boston.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are no nearer the solution of this mystery than we were in the beginning,&rdquo;  remarked the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,  I have not yet finished my story,&rdquo; intimated Amabel, sweetly. &ldquo;Perhaps what I  have yet to tell may give you some clew to the identity of this man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  yes; go on, go on. You have not yet explained how you came to be in possession  of Agatha&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  so,&rdquo; she answered, with another quick look at Frederick, the last she gave him  for some time. &ldquo;As soon, then, as I dared, I ran out of the house into the  yard. The moon, which had been under a cloud, was now shining brightly, and by  its light I saw that the space before me was empty and that I might venture to  enter the street. But before doing so I looked about for the dagger I had  thrown from me before going in, but I could not find it. It had been picked up  by the fugitive and carried away. Annoyed at the cowardice which had led me to  lose such a valuable piece of evidence through a purely womanish emotion, I was  about to leave the yard, when my eyes fell on the little bundle of sandwiches  which I had brought down from the hill and which I had let fall under the pear  tree, at the first scream I had heard from the house. It had burst open and two  or three of the sandwiches lay broken on the ground. But those that were intact  I picked up, and being more than ever anxious to cover up by some ostensible  errand my absence from the party, I rushed away toward the lonely road where  these brothers lived, meaning to leave such fragments as remained on the old  doorstep, beyond which I had been told such suffering existed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was now late, very late, for a girl like myself to be out, but, under the  excitement of what I had just seen and heard, I became oblivious to fear, and  rushed into those dismal shadows as into transparent daylight. Perhaps the  shouts and stray sounds of laughter that came up from the wharves where a ship  was getting under way gave me a certain sense of companionship. Perhaps&mdash;but it  is folly for me to dilate upon my feelings; it is my errand you are interested  in, and what happened when I approached the Zabels&rsquo; dreary dwelling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  look with which she paused, ostensibly to take breath, but in reality to weigh  and criticise the looks of those about her, was one of those wholly  indescribable ones with which she was accustomed to control the judgment of men  who allowed themselves to watch too closely the ever-changing expression of her  weird yet charming face. But it fell upon men steeled against her fascinations,  and realising her inability to move them, she proceeded with her story before  even the most anxious of her hearers could request her to do so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had come along the road very quietly,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for my feet were lightly  shod, and the moonlight was too bright for me to make a misstep. But as I  cleared the trees and came into the open place where the house stands I  stumbled with surprise at seeing a figure crouching on the doorstep I had  anticipated finding as empty as the road. It was an old man&rsquo;s figure, and as I  paused in my embarrassment he slowly and with great feebleness rose to his feet  and began to grope about for the door. As he did so, I heard a sharp tinkling  sound, as of something metallic falling on the doorstone, and, taking a quick  step forward, I looked over his shoulder and espied in the moonlight at his  feet a dagger so like the one I had lately handled in Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s yard that I  was overwhelmed with astonishment, and surveyed the aged and feeble form of the  man who had dropped it with a sensation difficult to describe. The next moment  he was stooping for the weapon, with a startled air that has impressed itself  distinctly upon my memory, and when, after many feeble attempts, he succeeded  in grasping it, he vanished into the house so suddenly that I could not be sure  whether or not he had seen me standing there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  this was more than surprising to me, for I had never thought of associating an  old man with this crime. Indeed, I was so astonished to find him in possession  of this weapon that I forgot all about my errand and only wondered how I could  see and know more. Fearing detection, I slid in amongst the bushes and soon  found myself under one of the windows. The shade was down and I was about to  push it aside when I heard someone moving about inside and stopped. But I could  not restrain my curiosity, so pulling a hairpin from my hair, I worked a little  hole in the shade and through this I looked into a room brightly illumined by  the moon which shone in through an adjoining window. And what did I see there?&rdquo;  Her eye turned on Frederick. His right hand had stolen toward his left, but it  paused under her look and remained motionless. &ldquo;Only an old man sitting at a  table and&mdash;&rdquo; Why did she pause, and why did she cover up that pause with a  wholly inconsequential sentence? Perhaps Frederick could have told, Frederick,  whose hand had now fallen at his side. But Frederick volunteered nothing, and  no one, not even Sweetwater, guessed all that lay beyond that <i>and</i> which was left hovering in the air  to be finished&mdash; when? Alas! had she not set the day and the hour?</p>
  <p>What  she did say was in seeming explanation of her previous sentence. &ldquo;It was not  the same old man I had seen on the doorstep, and while I was looking at him I  became aware of someone leaving the house and passing me on the road up-hill.  Of course this ended my interest in what went on within, and turning as quickly  as I could I hurried into the road and followed the shadow I could just  perceive disappearing in the woods above me. I was bound, gentlemen, as you  see, to follow out my adventure to the end. But my task now became very  difficult, for the moon was high and shone down upon the road so distinctly  that I could not follow the person before me as closely as I wished without  running the risk of being discovered by him. I therefore trusted more to my ear  than to my eye, and as long as I could hear his steps in front of me I was  satisfied. But presently, as we turned up this very hill, I ceased to hear  these steps and so became confident that he had taken to the woods. I was so  sure of this that I did not hesitate to enter them myself, and, knowing the  paths well, as I have every opportunity of doing, living, as we do, directly  opposite this forest, I easily found my way to the little clearing that I have  reason to think you gentlemen have since become acquainted with. But though  from the sounds I heard I was assured that the person I was following was not  far in advance of me, I did not dare to enter this brilliantly illumined space,  especially as there was every indication of this person having completed  whatever task he had set for himself. Indeed, I was sure that I heard his steps  coming back. So, for the second time, I crouched down in the darkest place I  could find and let this mysterious person pass me. When he had quite  disappeared, I made my own retreat, for it was late, and I was afraid of being  missed at the ball. But later, or rather the next day, I recrossed the road and  began a search for the money which I was confident had been left in the woods  opposite, by the person I had been following. I found it, and when the man here  present who, though a mere fiddler, has presumed to take a leading part in this  interview, came upon me with the bills in my hand, I was but burying deeper the  ill-gotten gains I had come upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  and so making them your own,&rdquo; quoth Sweetwater, stung by the sarcasm in that  word fiddler.</p>
  <p>But  with a suavity against which every attack fell powerless, she met his significant  look with one fully as significant, and quietly said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I had wanted the money for myself I would not have risked leaving it where the  murderer could find it by digging up a few handfuls of mould and a bunch of  sodden leaves. No, I had another motive for my action, a motive with which few,  if any, of you will be willing to credit me. I wished to save the murderer,  whom I had some reason, as you see, for thinking I knew, from the consequences  of his own action.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Courtney, Dr. Talbot, and even Mr. Sutherland, who naturally believed she  referred to Zabel, and who, one and all, had a lingering tenderness for this  unfortunate old man, which not even this seeming act of madness on his part  could quite destroy, felt a species of reaction at this, and surveyed the  singular being before them with, perhaps, the slightest shade of relenting in  their severity. Sweetwater alone betrayed restlessness, Knapp showed no feeling  at all, while Frederick stood like one petrified, and moved neither hand nor  foot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Crime  is despicable when it results from cupidity only,&rdquo; she went on, with a  deliberateness so hard that the more susceptible of her auditors shuddered. &ldquo;But  crime that springs from some imperative and overpowering necessity of the mind  or body might well awaken sympathy, and I am not ashamed of having been sorry  for this frenzied and suffering man. Weak and impulsive as you may consider me,  I did not want him to suffer on account of a moment&rsquo;s madness, as he  undoubtedly would if he were ever found with Agatha Webb&rsquo;s money in his  possession, so I plunged it deeper into the soil and trusted to the confusion  which crime always awakens even in the strongest mind, for him not to discover  its hiding-place till the danger connected with it was over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!  wonderful! Devilish subtle, eh? Clever, too clever!&rdquo; were some of the whispered  exclamations which this curious explanation on her part brought out. Yet only  Sweetwater showed his open and entire disbelief of the story, the others  possibly remembering that for such natures as hers there is no governing law  and no commonplace interpretation.</p>
  <p>To  Sweetwater, however, this was but so much display of feminine resource and  subtlety. Though he felt he should keep still in the presence of men so greatly  his superiors, he could not resist saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Truth  is sometimes stranger than fiction. I should never have attributed any such  motive as you mention to the young girl I saw leaving this spot with many a  backward glance at the hole from which we afterwards extracted the large sum of  money in question. But say that this reburying of stolen funds was out of  consideration for the feeble old man you describe as having carried them there,  do you not see that by this act you can be held as an accessory after the fact?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  eyebrows went up and the delicate curve of her lips was not without menace as  she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  hate me, Mr. Sweetwater. Do you wish me to tell these gentlemen why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  flush which, notwithstanding this peculiar young man&rsquo;s nerve, instantly  crimsoned his features, was a surprise to Frederick. So was it to the others,  who saw in it a possible hint as to the real cause of his persistent pursuit of  this young girl, which they had hitherto ascribed entirely to his love of  justice. Slighted love makes some hearts venomous. Could this ungainly fellow  have once loved and been disdained by this bewitching piece of unreliability?</p>
  <p>It  was a very possible assumption, though Sweetwater&rsquo;s blush was the only answer  he gave to her question, which nevertheless had amply served its turn.</p>
  <p>To fill  the gap caused by his silence, Mr. Sutherland made an effort and addressed her  himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  conduct,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has not been that of a strictly honourable person. Why did  you fail to give the alarm when you re-entered my house after being witness to  this double tragedy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  serenity was not to be disturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have just explained,&rdquo; she reminded him, &ldquo;that I had sympathy for the criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  all have sympathy for James Zabel, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not believe one word of this story,&rdquo; interposed Sweetwater, in reckless  disregard of proprieties. &ldquo;A hungry, feeble old man, like Zabel, on the verge  of death, could not have found his way into these woods. You carried the money  there yourself, miss; you are the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  interposed the coroner, authoritatively; &ldquo;do not let us go too fast&mdash;yet. Miss  Page has an air of speaking the truth, strange and unaccountable as it may  seem. Zabel was an admirable man once, and if he was led into theft and murder,  it was not until his faculties had been weakened by his own suffering and that  of his much-loved brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; was her simple reply; and for the first time every man there thrilled at  her tone. Seeing it, all the dangerous fascination of her look and manner  returned upon her with double force. &ldquo;I have been unwise,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and let  my sympathy run away with my judgment. Women have impulses of this kind  sometimes, and men blame them for it, till they themselves come to the point of  feeling the need of just such blind devotion. I am sure I regret my  short-sightedness now, for I have lost esteem by it, while he&mdash;&rdquo; With a wave of  the hand she dismissed the subject, and Dr. Talbot, watching her, felt a shade  of his distrust leave him, and in its place a species of admiration for the  lithe, graceful, bewitching personality before them, with her childish impulses  and womanly wit which half mystified and half imposed upon them.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland, on the contrary, was neither charmed from his antagonism nor  convinced of her honesty. There was something in this matter that could not be  explained away by her argument, and his suspicion of that something he felt  perfectly sure was shared by his son, toward whose cold, set face he had  frequently cast the most uneasy glances. He was not ready, however, to probe  into the subject more deeply, nor could he, for the sake of Frederick, urge on  to any further confession a young woman whom his unhappy son professed to love,  and in whose discretion he had so little confidence. As for Sweetwater, he had  now fully recovered his self-possession, and bore himself with great discretion  when Dr. Talbot finally said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  gentlemen, we have got more than we expected when we came here this morning.  There remains, however, a point regarding which we have received no  explanation. Miss Page, how came that orchid, which I am told you wore in your  hair at the dance, to be found lying near the hem of Batsy&rsquo;s skirts? You  distinctly told us that you did not go up-stairs when you were in Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s  house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; acquiesced the Boston detective dryly. &ldquo;How came that flower on the  scene of the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  smiled and seemed equal to the emergency.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a mystery for us all to solve,&rdquo; she said quietly, frankly meeting the eyes  of her questioner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  mystery it is your business to solve,&rdquo; corrected the district attorney. &ldquo;Nothing  that you have told us in support of your innocence would, in the eyes of the  law, weigh for one instant against the complicity shown by that one piece of  circumstantial evidence against you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  smile carried a certain high-handed denial of this to one heart there, at  least. But her words were humble enough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am aware of that,&rdquo; said she. Then, turning to where Sweetwater stood lowering  upon her from out his half-closed eyes, she impetuously exclaimed: &ldquo;You, sir,  who, with no excuse an honourable person can recognise, have seen fit to  arrogate to yourself duties wholly out of your province, prove yourself equal  to your presumption by ferreting out, alone and unassisted, the secret of this  mystery. It can be done, for, mark, <i>I</i> did not carry that flower into the  room where it was found. This I am ready to assert before God and before man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  hand was raised, her whole attitude spoke defiance and&mdash;hard as it was for  Sweetwater to acknowledge it&mdash;truth. He felt that he had received a challenge,  and with a quick glance at Knapp, who barely responded by a shrug, he shifted  over to the side of Dr. Talbot.</p>
  <p>Amabel  at once dropped her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I go?&rdquo; she now cried appealingly to Mr. Courtney. &ldquo;I really have no more to  say, and I am tired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see the figure of the man who brushed by you in the wood? Was it that of  the old man you saw on the doorstep?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this direct question Frederick quivered in spite of his dogged self-control.  But she, with her face upturned to meet the scrutiny of the speaker, showed  only a childish kind of wonder. &ldquo;Why do you ask that? Is there any doubt about  its being the same?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  an actress she was! Frederick stood appalled. He had been amazed at the skill  with which she had manipulated her story so as to keep her promise to him, and  yet leave the way open for that further confession which would alter the whole  into a denunciation of himself which he would find it difficult, if not  impossible, to meet. But this extreme dissimulation made him lose heart. It  showed her to be an antagonist of almost illimitable resource and secret  determination.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not suppose there could be any doubt,&rdquo; she added, in such a 
    natural tone of surprise that Mr. Courtney dropped the subject, and Dr. 
    Talbot turned to Sweetwater, who for the moment seemed to have robbed 
    Knapp of his rightful place as the coroner&rsquo;s confidant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  we let her go for the present?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;She does look tired, poor girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  public challenge which Sweetwater had received made him wary, and his reply was  a guarded one:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not trust her, yet there is much to confirm her story. Those sandwiches,  now. She says she dropped them in Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s yard under the pear tree, and  that the bag that held them burst open. Gentlemen, the birds were so busy there  on the morning after the murder that I could not but notice them,  notwithstanding my absorption in greater matters. I remember wondering what  they were all pecking at so eagerly. But how about the flower whose presence on  the scene of guilt she challenges me to explain? And the money so deftly  reburied by her? Can any explanation make her other than accessory to a crime  on whose fruits she lays her hand in a way tending solely to concealment? No,  sirs; and so I shall not relax my vigilance over her, even if, in order to be  faithful to it, I have to suggest that a warrant be made out for her  imprisonment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right,&rdquo; acquiesced the coroner, and turning to Miss Page, he told her she  was too valuable a witness to be lost sight of, and requested her to prepare to  accompany him into town.</p>
  <p>She  made no objection. On the contrary her cheeks dimpled, and she turned away with  alacrity towards her room. But before the door closed on her she looked back,  and, with a persuasive smile, remarked that she had told all she knew, or  thought she knew at the time. But that perhaps, after thinking the matter  carefully over, she might remember some detail that would throw some extra  light on the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  her back!&rdquo; cried Mr. Courtney. &ldquo;She is withholding something. Let us hear it  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Sutherland, with a side look at Frederick, persuaded the district attorney  to postpone all further examination of this artful girl until they were alone.  The anxious father had noted, what the rest were too preoccupied to observe,  that Frederick had reached the limit of his strength and could not be trusted  to preserve his composure any longer in face of this searching examination into  the conduct of a woman from whom he had so lately detached himself.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
    Poor Philemon</b></h2>
  <p>The  next day was the day of Agatha&rsquo;s funeral. She was to be buried in Portchester,  by the side of her six children, and, as the day was fine, the whole town, as  by common consent, assembled in the road along which the humble cortege was to  make its way to the spot indicated.</p>
  <p>From  the windows of farmhouses, from between the trees of the few scattered thickets  along the way, saddened and curious faces looked forth till Sweetwater, who  walked as near as he dared to the immediate friends of the deceased, felt the  impossibility of remembering them all and gave up the task in despair.</p>
  <p>Before  one house, about a mile out of town, the procession paused, and at a gesture  from the minister everyone within sight took off their hats, amid a hush which  made almost painfully apparent the twittering of birds and the other sounds of  animate and inanimate nature, which are inseparable from a country road. They  had reached widow Jones&rsquo;s cottage in which Philemon was then staying.</p>
  <p>The  front door was closed, and so were the lower windows, but in one of the upper  casements a movement was perceptible, and in another instant there came into  view a woman and man, supporting between them the impassive form of Agatha&rsquo;s  husband. Holding him up in plain sight of the almost breathless throng below,  the woman pointed to where his darling lay and appeared to say something to  him.</p>
  <p>Then  there was to be seen a strange sight. The old man, with his thin white locks  fluttering in the breeze, leaned forward with a smile, and holding out his arms,  cried in a faint but joyful tone: &ldquo;Agatha!&rdquo; Then, as if realising for the first  time that it was death he looked upon, and that the crowd below was a funeral  procession, his face altered and he fell back with a low heartbroken moan into  the arms of those who supported him.</p>
  <p>As  his white head disappeared from sight, the procession moved on, and from only  one pair of lips went up that groan of sorrow with which every heart seemed  surcharged. One groan. From whose lips did it come? Sweetwater endeavoured to ascertain,  but was not able, nor could anyone inform him, unless it was Mr. Sutherland,  whom he dared not approach.</p>
  <p>This  gentleman was on foot like the rest, with his arm fast linked in that of his  son Frederick. He had meant to ride, for the distance was long for men past  sixty; but finding the latter resolved to walk, he had consented to do the same  rather than be separated from his son.</p>
  <p>He  had fears for Frederick&mdash;he could hardly have told why; and as the ceremony  proceeded and Agatha was solemnly laid away in the place prepared for her, his  sympathies grew upon him to such an extent that he found it difficult to quit  the young man for a moment, or even to turn his eyes away from the face he had  never seemed to know till now. But as friends and strangers were now leaving  the yard, he controlled himself, and assuming a more natural demeanour, asked  his son if he were now ready to ride back. But, to his astonishment, Frederick  replied that he did not intend to return to Sutherlandtown at present; that he  had business in Portchester, and that he was doubtful as to when he would be  ready to return. As the old gentleman did not wish to raise a controversy, he  said nothing, but as soon as he saw Frederick disappear up the road, he sent  back the carriage he had ordered, saying that he would return in a Portchester  gig as soon as he had settled some affairs of his own, which might and might  not detain him there till evening.</p>
  <p>Then  he proceeded to a little inn, where he hired a room with windows that looked  out on the high-road. In one of these windows he sat all day, watching for  Frederick, who had gone farther up the road.</p>
  <p>But  no Frederick appeared, and with vague misgivings, for which as yet he had no  name, he left the window and set out on foot for home.</p>
  <p>It  was now dark, but a silvery gleam on the horizon gave promise of the speedy  rising of a full moon. Otherwise he would not have attempted to walk over a  road proverbially dark and dismal.</p>
  <p>The  churchyard in which they had just laid away Agatha lay in his course. As he  approached it he felt his heart fail, and stopping a moment at the stone wall  that separated it from the high-road, he leaned against the trunk of a huge elm  that guarded the gate of entrance. As he did so he heard a sound of repressed  sobbing from some spot not very far away, and, moved by some undefinable  impulse stronger than his will, he pushed open the gate and entered the sacred  precincts.</p>
  <p>Instantly  the weirdness and desolation of the spot struck him. He wished, yet dreaded, to  advance. Something in the grief of the mourner whose sobs he had heard had  seized upon his heart-strings, and yet, as he hesitated, the sounds came again,  and forgetting that his intrusion might not prove altogether welcome, he  pressed forward, till he came within a few feet of the spot from which the sobs  issued.</p>
  <p>He  had moved quietly, feeling the awesomeness of the place, and when he paused it  was with a sensation of dread, not to be entirely explained by the sad and  dismal surroundings. Dark as it was, he discerned the outline of a form lying  stretched in speechless misery across a grave; but when, impelled by an almost  irresistible compassion, he strove to speak, his tongue clove to the roof of  his mouth and he only drew back farther into the shadow.</p>
  <p>He  had recognised the mourner and the grave. The mourner was Frederick and the  grave that of Agatha Webb.</p>
  <p>A  few minutes later Mr. Sutherland reappeared at the door of the inn, and asked  for a gig and driver to take him back to Sutherlandtown. He said, in excuse for  his indecision, that he had undertaken to walk, but had found his strength  inadequate to the exertion. He was looking very pale, and trembled so that the  landlord, who took his order, asked him if he were ill. But Mr. Sutherland  insisted that he was quite well, only in a hurry, and showed the greatest  impatience till he was again started upon the road.</p>
  <p>For  the first half-mile he sat perfectly silent. The moon was now up, and the road  stretched before them, flooded with light. As long as no one was to be seen on  this road, or on the path running beside it, Mr. Sutherland held himself erect,  his eyes fixed before him, in an attitude of anxious inquiry. But as soon as  any sound came to break the silence, or there appeared in the distance ahead of  them the least appearance of a plodding wayfarer, he drew back, and hid himself  in the recesses of the vehicle. This happened several times. Then his whole  manner changed. They had just passed Frederick, walking, with bowed head,  toward Sutherlandtown.</p>
  <p>But  he was not the only person on the road at this time. A few minutes previously  they had passed another man walking in the same direction. As Mr. Sutherland  mused over this he found himself peering through the small window at the back  of the buggy, striving to catch another glimpse of the two men plodding behind  him. He could see them both, his son&rsquo;s form throwing its long shadow over the  moonlit road, followed only too closely by the man whose ungainly shape he  feared to acknowledge to himself was growing only too familiar in his eyes.</p>
  <p>Falling  into a troubled reverie, he beheld the well-known houses, and the great trees  under whose shadow he had grown from youth to manhood, flit by him like  phantoms in a dream. But suddenly one house and one place drew his attention  with a force that startled him again into an erect attitude, and seizing with  one hand the arm of the driver, he pointed with the other at the door of the  cottage they were passing, saying in choked tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See!  see! Something dreadful has happened since we passed by here this morning. That  is crape, Samuel, crape, hanging from the doorpost yonder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it is crape,&rdquo; answered the driver, jumping out and running up the path to look.  &ldquo;Philemon must be dead; the good Philemon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  was a fresh blow. Mr. Sutherland bowed before it for a moment, then he rose  hurriedly and stepped down into the road beside the driver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  in again,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and drive on. Ride a half-mile, then come back for me. I  must see the widow Jones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  driver, awed both by the occasion and the feeling it had called up in Mr.  Sutherland, did as he was bid and drove away. Mr. Sutherland, with a glance  back at the road he had just traversed, walked painfully up the path to Mrs.  Jones&rsquo;s door.</p>
  <p>A  moment&rsquo;s conversation with the woman who answered his summons proved the driver&rsquo;s  supposition to be correct. Philemon had passed away. He had never rallied from  the shock he had received. He had joined his beloved Agatha on the day of her  burial, and the long tragedy of their mutual life was over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a mercy that no inheritor of their misfortune remains,&rdquo; quoth the good  woman, as she saw the affliction her tidings caused in this much-revered  friend.</p>
  <p>The  assent Mr. Sutherland gave was mechanical. He was anxiously studying the road  leading toward Portchester.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  he stepped hastily into the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you be so good as to let me sit down in your parlour for a few minutes?&rdquo; he  asked. &ldquo;I should like to rest there for an instant alone. This final blow has  upset me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  good woman bowed. Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s word was law in that town. She did not even  dare to protest against the <i>alone</i> which he had so pointedly emphasised, but left him after making him, as she  said, comfortable, and went back to her duties in the room above.</p>
  <p>It  was fortunate she was so amenable to his wishes, for no sooner had her steps  ceased to be heard than Mr. Sutherland rose from the easy-chair in which he had  been seated, and, putting out the lamp widow Jones had insisted on lighting,  passed directly to the window, through which he began to peer with looks of the  deepest anxiety.</p>
  <p>A  man was coming up the road, a young man, Frederick. As Mr. Sutherland  recognised him he leaned forward with increased anxiety, till at the appearance  of his son in front his scrutiny grew so strained and penetrating that it  seemed to exercise a magnetic influence upon Frederick, causing him to look up.</p>
  <p>The  glance he gave the house was but momentary, but in that glance the father saw  all that he had secretly dreaded. As his son&rsquo;s eye fell on that fluttering bit  of crape, testifying to another death in this already much-bereaved community,  he staggered wildly, then in a pause of doubt drew nearer and nearer till his  fingers grasped this symbol of mourning and clung there. Next moment he was far  down the road, plunging toward home in a state of great mental disorder.</p>
  <p>A  half-hour afterwards Mr. Sutherland reached home. He had not overtaken  Frederick again, or even his accompanying shadow. Ascertaining at his own door  that his son had not yet come in, but had been seen going farther up the hill,  he turned back again into the road and proceeded after him on foot.</p>
  <p>The  next place to his own was occupied by Mr. Halliday. As he approached it he  caught sight of a man standing half in and half out of the honeysuckle porch,  whom he at first thought to be Frederick. But he soon saw that it was the  fellow who had been following his son all the way from Portchester, and,  controlling his first movement of dislike, he stepped up to him and quietly  said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweetwater,  is this you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man fell back and showed a most extraordinary agitation, quickly  suppressed, however. &ldquo;Yes, sir, it is no one else. Do you know what I am doing  here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear I do. You have been to Portchester. You have seen my son&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  made a hurried, almost an entreating, gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind that, Mr. Sutherland. I had rather you wouldn&rsquo;t say anything about that. I  am as much broken up by what I have seen as you are. I never suspected him of  having any direct connection with this murder; only the girl to whom he has so  unfortunately attached himself. But after what I have seen, what am I to think?  what am I to do? I honour you; I would not grieve you; but&mdash;but&mdash;oh, sir, perhaps  you can help me out of the maze into which I have stumbled. Perhaps you can  assure me that Mr. Frederick did not leave the ball at the time she did. I  missed him from among the dancers. I did not see him between twelve and three,  but perhaps you did; and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  voice broke. He was almost as profoundly agitated as Mr. Sutherland. As for the  latter, who found himself unable to reassure the other on this very vital  point, having no remembrance himself of having seen Frederick among his guests  during those fatal hours, he stood speechless, lost in abysses, the depth and  horror of which only a father can appreciate. Sweetwater respected his anguish  and for a moment was silent himself. Then he burst out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had rather never lived to see this day than be the cause of shame or suffering  to you. Tell me what to do. Shall I be deaf, dumb&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  Mr. Sutherland found voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  make too much of what you saw,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My boy has faults and has lived  anything but a satisfactory life, but he is not as bad as you would intimate.  He can never have taken life. That would be incredible, monstrous, in one  brought up as he has been. Besides, if he were so far gone in evil as to be  willing to attempt crime, he had no motive to do so; Sweetwater, he had no  motive. A few hundred dollars but these he could have got from me, and did,  but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Why  did the wretched father stop? Did he recall the circumstances under which  Frederick had obtained these last hundreds from him? They were not ordinary  circumstances, and Frederick had been in no ordinary strait. Mr. Sutherland  could not but acknowledge to himself that there was something in this whole  matter which contradicted the very plea he was making, and not being able to  establish the conviction of his son&rsquo;s innocence in his own mind, he was too  honourable to try to establish it in that of another. His next words betrayed  the depth of his struggle:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is that girl who has ruined him, Sweetwater. He loves but doubts her, as who  could help doing after the story she told us day before yesterday? Indeed, he  has doubted her ever since that fatal night, and it is this which has broken  his heart, and not&mdash;not&mdash;&rdquo; Again the old gentleman paused; again he recovered  himself, this time with a touch of his usual dignity and self-command. &ldquo;Leave  me,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Nothing that you have seen has escaped me; but our  interpretations of it may differ. I will watch over my son from this hour, and  you may trust my vigilance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  bowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have a right to command me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You may have forgotten, but I have not,  that I owe my life to you. Years ago&mdash;perhaps you can recall it&mdash;it was at the Black  Pond&mdash;I was going down for the third time and my mother was screaming in terror  on the bank, when you plunged in and&mdash;Well, sir, such things are never  forgotten, and, as I said before, you have only to command me.&rdquo; He turned to  go, but suddenly came back. There were signs of mental conflict in his face and  voice. &ldquo;Mr. Sutherland, I am not a talkative man. If I trust your vigilance you  may trust my discretion. Only I must have your word that you will convey no  warning to your son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland made an indefinable gesture, and Sweetwater again disappeared, this  time not to return. As for Mr. Sutherland, he remained standing before Mr.  Halliday&rsquo;s door. What had the young man meant by this emphatic repetition of  his former suggestion? That he would be quiet, also, and not speak of what he  had seen? Why, then&mdash;But to the hope thus given, this honest-hearted gentleman  would yield no quarter, and seeing a duty before him, a duty he dare not shirk,  he brought his emotions, violent as they were, into complete and absolute  subjection, and, opening Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s door, entered the house. They were old  neighbours, and ceremony was ignored between them.</p>
  <p>Finding  the hall empty and the parlour door open he walked immediately into the latter  room. The sight that met his eyes never left his memory. Agnes, his little  Agnes, whom he had always loved and whom he had vainly longed to call by the  endearing name of daughter, sat with her face towards him, looking up at  Frederick. That young gentleman had just spoken to her, or she had just  received something from his hand for her own was held out and her expression  was one of gratitude and acceptance. She was not a beautiful girl, but she had  a beautiful look, and at this moment it was exalted by a feeling the old  gentleman had once longed, but now dreaded inexpressibly, to see there. What  could it mean? Why did she show at this unhappy crisis, interest, devotion,  passion almost, for one she had regarded with open scorn when it was the  dearest wish of his heart to see them united? It was one of the contradictions  of our mysterious human nature, and at this crisis and in this moment of secret  heart-break and miserable doubt it made the old gentleman shrink, with his  first feeling of actual despair.</p>
  <p>The  next moment Agnes had risen and they were both facing him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-evening,  Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland forced himself to speak lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Frederick, do I find you here?&rdquo; The latter question had more constraint in it.</p>
  <p>Frederick  smiled. There was an air of relief about him, almost of cheerfulness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was just leaving,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was the bearer of a message to Miss 
    Halliday.&rdquo; He had always called her Agnes before.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland, who had found his faculties confused by the expression he had  surprised on the young girl&rsquo;s face, answered with a divided attention:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I have a message to give you. Wait outside on the porch for me, 
    Frederick, till I exchange a word with our little friend here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes,  who had thrust something she held into a box that lay beside her on a table,  turned with a confused blush to listen.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland waited till Frederick had stepped into the hall. Then he drew Agnes  to one side and remorselessly, persistently, raised her face toward him till  she was forced to meet his benevolent but searching regard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know,&rdquo; he whispered, in what he endeavoured to make a bantering tone, &ldquo;how  very few days it is since that unhappy boy yonder confessed his love for a  young lady whose name I cannot bring myself to utter in your presence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  intent was kind, but the effect was unexpectedly cruel. With a droop of her  head and a hurried gasp which conveyed a mixture of entreaty and reproach,  Agnes drew back in a vague endeavour to hide her sudden uneasiness. He saw his  mistake, and let his hands drop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,  my dear,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I had no idea it would hurt you to hear this. You have  always seemed indifferent, hard even, toward my scapegrace son. And this was  right, for&mdash;for&mdash;&rdquo; What could he say, how express one-tenth of that with which  his breast was labouring! He could not, he dared not, so ended, as we have  intimated, by a confused stammering.</p>
  <p>Agnes,  who had never before seen this object of her lifelong admiration under any  serious emotion, felt an impulse of remorse, as if she herself had been guilty  of occasioning him embarrassment. Plucking up her courage, she wistfully eyed  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you imagine,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;that I needed any warning against Frederick, who  has never honoured me with his regard, as he has the young lady you cannot  mention? I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t know me, Mr. Sutherland, notwithstanding I have  sat on your knee and sometimes plucked at your beard in my infantile insistence  upon attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid I don&rsquo;t know you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I feel that I know nobody now, not  even my son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had hoped she would look up at this, but she did not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  my little girl think me very curious and very impertinent if I ask her what my  son Frederick was saying when I came into the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked up now, and with visible candour answered him immediately and to the  point:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frederick  is in trouble, Mr. Sutherland. He has felt the need of a friend who could  appreciate this, and he has asked me to be that friend. Besides, he brought me  a packet of letters which he entreated me to keep for him. I took them, Mr.  Sutherland, and I will keep them as he asked me to do, safe from everybody&rsquo;s  inspection, even my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oh!  why had he questioned her? He did not want to know of these letters; he did not  want to know that Frederick possessed anything which he was afraid to retain in  his own possession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  son did wrong,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to confide anything to your care which he did not  desire to retain in his own home. I feel that I ought to see these letters, for  if my son is in trouble, as you say, I, his father, ought to know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not sure about that,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;His trouble may be of a different nature  than you imagine. Frederick has led a life that he regrets. I think his chief  source of suffering lies in the fact that it is so hard for him to make others  believe that he means to do differently in the future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  he mean to do differently?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  flushed. &ldquo;He says so, Mr. Sutherland. And I, for one, cannot help believing  him. Don&rsquo;t you see that he begins to look like another man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland was taken aback. He had noticed this fact, and had found it a hard  one to understand. To ascertain what her explanation of it might be, he replied  at once:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is a change in him&mdash;a very evident change. What is the occasion of it? To what  do you ascribe it, Agnes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How  breathlessly he waited for her answer! Had she any suspicion of the awful  doubts which were so deeply agitating himself that night? She did not appear to  have.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hesitate,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;but not from any doubt of Frederick, to tell you just  what I think lies at the bottom of the sudden change observable in him. Miss  Page (you see, I can name her, if you cannot) has proved herself so unworthy of  his regard that the shock he has received has opened his eyes to certain  failings of his own which made his weakness in her regard possible. I do not  know of any other explanation. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this direct question, breathed though it was by tender lips, and launched in  ignorance of the barb which carried it to his heart, Mr. Sutherland recoiled  and cast an anxious look upon the door. Then with forced composure he quietly  said: &ldquo;If you who are so much nearer his age, and, let me hope, his sympathy,  do not feel sure of his real feelings, how should I, who am his father, but  have never been his confidant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  she cried, holding out her hands, &ldquo;such a good father! Some day he will  appreciate that fact as well as others. Believe it, Mr. Sutherland, believe it.&rdquo;  And then, ashamed of her glowing interest, which was a little more pronounced  than became her simple attitude of friend toward a man professedly in love with  another woman, she faltered and cast the shyest of looks upward at the face she  had never seen turned toward her with anything but kindness. &ldquo;I have confidence  in Frederick&rsquo;s good heart,&rdquo; she added, with something like dignity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  God that I could share it!&rdquo; was the only answer she received. Before she could  recover from the shock of these words, Mr. Sutherland was gone.</p>
  <p>Agnes  was more or less disconcerted by this interview. There was a lingering in her  step that night, as she trod the little white-embowered chamber sacred to her  girlish dreams, which bespake an overcharged heart; a heart that, before she  slept, found relief in these few words whispered by her into the night air,  laden with the sweetness of honeysuckles:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  it be that he is right? Did I need such a warning,&mdash;I, who have hated this man,  and who thought that it was my hatred which made it impossible for me to think  of anything or anybody else since we parted from each other last night? O me,  if it is so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  from the great, wide world without, tremulous with moonlight, the echo seemed  to come back:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Woe  to thee, Agnes Halliday, if this be so!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
    A Surprise For Mr. Sutherland</b></h2>
  <p>Meanwhile  Mr. Sutherland and Frederick stood facing each other in the former&rsquo;s library.  Nothing had been said during their walk down the hill, and nothing seemed  likely to proceed from Frederick now, though his father waited with great and  growing agitation for some explanation that would relieve the immense strain on  his heart. At last he himself spoke, dryly, as we all speak when the heart is  fullest and we fear to reveal the depth of our emotions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  papers were those you gave into Agnes Halliday&rsquo;s keeping? Anything which we  could not have more safely, not to say discreetly, harboured in our own house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick,  taken aback, for he had not realised that his father had seen these papers,  hesitated for a moment; then he boldly said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were letters&mdash;old letters&mdash;which I felt to be better out of this house than in  it. I could not destroy them, so I gave them into the guardianship of the most  conscientious person I know. I hope you won&rsquo;t demand to see those letters.  Indeed, sir, I hope you won&rsquo;t demand to see them. They were not written for  your eye, and I would rather rest under your displeasure than have them in any  way made public.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  showed such earnestness, rather than fear, that Mr. Sutherland was astonished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  were these letters written?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Lately, or before&mdash;You say they are old;  how old?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick&rsquo;s  breath came easier.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  of them were written years ago&mdash;most of them, in fact. It is a personal  matter&mdash;every man has such. I wish I could have destroyed them. You will leave  them with Agnes, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  astonish me,&rdquo; said Mr. Sutherland, relieved that he could at least hope that  these letters were in nowise connected with the subject of his own frightful  suspicions. &ldquo;A young girl, to whom you certainly were most indifferent a week  ago, is a curious guardian of letters you decline to show your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; was Frederick&rsquo;s sole reply.</p>
  <p>Somehow  the humility with which this was uttered touched Mr. Sutherland and roused  hopes he had supposed dead. He looked his son for the first time directly in  the eye, and with a beating heart said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  secrets, if you have such, might better be entrusted to your father. You have  no better friend&mdash;&rdquo; and there he stopped with a horrified, despairing feeling of  inward weakness. If Frederick had committed a crime, anything would be better  than knowing it. Turning partially aside, he fingered the papers on the desk  before which he was standing. A large envelope, containing some legal document,  lay before him. Taking it up mechanically, he opened it. Frederick as  mechanically watched him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;that I have no better friend. You have been too good,  too indulgent. What is it, father? You change colour, look ill, what is there  in that paper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland straightened himself; there was a great reserve of strength in this  broken-down man yet. Fixing Frederick with a gaze more penetrating than any he  had yet bestowed upon him, he folded his hands behind him with the document  held tightly between them, and remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  you borrowed that money from me you did it like a man who expected to repay it.  Why? Whence did you expect to receive the money with which to repay me? Answer,  Frederick; this is your hour for confession.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  turned so pale his father dropped his eyes in mercy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confess?&rdquo;  he repeated. &ldquo;What should I confess? My sins? They are too many. As for that  money, I hoped to return it as any son might hope to reimburse his father for  money advanced to pay a gambler&rsquo;s debt. I said I meant to work. My first money  earned shall be offered to you. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?  Well?&rdquo; His father was holding the document he had just read, opened out before  his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  you expect <i>this</i>?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  you know that that poor woman, that wretchedly murdered, most unhappy woman,  whose death the whole town mourns, had made you her heir? That by the terms of  this document, seen by me here and now for the first time, I am made executor  and you the inheritor of the one hundred thousand dollars or more left by  Agatha Webb?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  cried Frederick, his eyes glued to the paper, his whole face and form  expressing something more akin to terror than surprise. &ldquo;Has she done this? Why  should she? I hardly knew her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you hardly knew her. And she? She hardly knew you; if she had she would have  abhorred rather than enriched you. Frederick, I had rather see you dead than  stand before me the inheritor of Philemon and Agatha Webb&rsquo;s hard-earned  savings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right; it would be better,&rdquo; murmured Frederick, hardly heeding what he  said. Then, as he encountered his father&rsquo;s eye resting upon him with implacable  scrutiny, he added, in weak repetition: &ldquo;Why should she give her money to me?  What was I to her that she should will me her fortune?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  father&rsquo;s finger trembled to a certain line in the document, which seemed to  offer some explanation of this; but Frederick did not follow it. He had seen  that his father was expecting a reply to the question he had previously put,  and he was casting about in his mind how to answer it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  did you know of this will?&rdquo; Mr. Sutherland now repeated. &ldquo;For know of it you  did before you came to me for money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frederick  summoned up his full courage and confronted his father resolutely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;I did not know of it. It is as much of a surprise to me as it is to  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  lied. Mr. Sutherland knew that he lied and Frederick knew that he knew it. A  shadow fell between them, which the older, with that unspeakable fear upon him  roused by Sweetwater&rsquo;s whispered suspicions, dared no longer attempt to lift.</p>
  <p>After  a few minutes in which Frederick seemed to see his father age before his eyes,  Mr. Sutherland coldly remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Talbot must know of this will. It has been sent here to me from Boston by a  lawyer who drew it up two years ago. The coroner may not as yet have heard of  it. Will you accompany me to his office to-morrow? I should like to have him  see that we wish to be open with him in an affair of such importance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will accompany you gladly,&rdquo; said Frederick, and seeing that his father neither  wished nor was able to say anything further, he bowed with distant ceremony as  to a stranger and quietly withdrew. But when the door had closed between them  and only the memory of his father&rsquo;s changed countenance remained to trouble  him, he paused and laid his hand again on the knob, as if tempted to return.  But he left without doing so, only to turn again at the end of the hall and  gaze wistfully back. Yet he went on.</p>
  <p>As  he opened his own door and disappeared within, he said half audibly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easy  to destroy me now, Amabel. One word and I am lost!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
    Sweetwater Reasons</b></h2>
  <p>And  what of Sweetwater, in whose thoughts and actions the interest now centres?</p>
  <p>When  he left Mr. Sutherland it was with feelings such as few who knew him supposed  him capable of experiencing. Unattractive as he was in every way, ungainly in  figure and unprepossessing of countenance, this butt of the more favoured youth  in town had a heart whose secret fires were all the warmer for being so  persistently covered, and this heart was wrung with trouble and heavy with a  struggle that bade fair to leave him without rest that night, if not for many  nights to come. Why? One word will explain. Unknown to the world at large and  almost unknown to himself, his best affections were fixed upon the man whose  happiness he thus unexpectedly saw himself destined to destroy. He loved Mr.  Sutherland.</p>
  <p>The  suspicion which he now found transferred in his own mind from the young girl  whose blood-stained slippers he had purloined during the excitement of the  first alarm, to the unprincipled but only son of his one benefactor, had not  been lightly embraced or thoughtlessly expressed. He had had time to think it  out in all its bearings. During that long walk from Portchester churchyard to  Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s door, he had been turning over in his mind everything that he  had heard and seen in connection with this matter, till the dim vision of  Frederick&rsquo;s figure going on before him was not more apparent to his sight than  was the guilt he so deplored to his inward understanding.</p>
  <p>He  could not help but recognise him as the active party in the crime he had  hitherto charged Amabel with. With the clew offered by Frederick&rsquo;s secret  anguish at the grave of Agatha, he could read the whole story of this  detestable crime as plainly as if it had been written in letters of fire on the  circle of the surrounding darkness. Such anguish under such circumstances on  the part of such a man could mean but one thing&mdash;remorse; and remorse in the  breast of one so proverbially careless and corrupt, over the death of a woman  who was neither relative nor friend, could have but one interpretation, and  that was guilt.</p>
  <p>No  other explanation was possible. Could one be given, or if any evidence could be  adduced in contradiction of this assumption, he would have dismissed his new  suspicion with more heartiness even than he had embraced his former one. He did  not wish to believe Frederick guilty. He would have purchased an inner  conviction of his innocence almost at the price of his own life, not because of  any latent interest in the young man himself, but because he was Charles  Sutherland&rsquo;s son, and the dear, if unworthy, centre of all that noble man&rsquo;s  hopes, aims, and happiness. But he could come upon no fact capable of shaking  his present belief. Taking for truth Amabel&rsquo;s account of what she had seen and  done on that fatal night&mdash;something which he had hesitated over the previous  day, but which he now found himself forced to accept or do violence to his own  secret convictions&mdash;and adding to it such facts as had come to his own knowledge  in his self-imposed role of detective, he had but to test the events of that  night by his present theory of Frederick&rsquo;s guilt, to find them hang together in  a way too complete for mistake.</p>
  <p>For  what had been his reasons for charging Amabel herself with the guilt of a crime  she only professed to have been a partial witness to?</p>
  <p>They  were many.</p>
  <p>First&mdash;The  forced nature of her explanations in regard to her motive for leaving a merry  ball and betaking herself to the midnight road in her party dress and slippers.  A woman of her well-known unsympathetic nature might use the misery of the  Zabels as a pretext for slipping into town at night, but never would be  influenced by it as a motive.</p>
  <p>Second&mdash;The  equally unsatisfactory nature of the reasons she gave for leaving the course  she had marked out for herself and entering upon the pursuit of an unknown man  into a house in which she had no personal interest and from which she had just  seen a bloody dagger thrown out. The most callous of women would have shrunk  from letting her curiosity carry her thus far.</p>
  <p>Third&mdash;The  poverty of her plea that, after having braved so much in her desire to identify  this criminal, she was so frightened at his near approach as to fail to lift  her head when the opportunity was given her to recognise him.</p>
  <p>Fourth&mdash;Her  professed inability to account for the presence of the orchid from her hair  being found in the room with Batsy.</p>
  <p>Fifth&mdash;Her  evident attempt to throw the onus of the crime on an old man manifestly  incapable from physical causes of committing it.</p>
  <p>Sixth&mdash;The  improbability, which she herself should have recognised, of this old man, in  his extremely weak condition, ignoring the hiding-places offered by the woods  back of his own house, for the sake of one not only involving a long walk, but  situated close to a much-frequented road, and almost in view of the Sutherland  mansion.</p>
  <p>Seventh&mdash;The  transparent excuse of sympathy for the old man and her desire to save him from  the consequences of his crime, which she offered in extenuation of her own  criminal avowal of having first found and then reburied the ill-gotten gains  she had come upon in her persistent pursuit of the flying criminal. So  impulsive an act might be consistent with the blind compassion of some  weak-headed but warm-hearted woman, but not with her self-interested nature,  incapable of performing any heroic deed save from personal motives or the most  headlong passion.</p>
  <p>Lastly&mdash;The  weakness of her explanation in regard to the cause which led her to peer into  the Zabel cottage through a hole made in the window-shade. Curiosity has its  limits even in a woman&rsquo;s breast, and unless she hoped to see more than was  indicated by her words, her action was but the precursor of a personal entrance  into a room where we have every reason to believe the twenty-dollar bill was  left.</p>
  <p>A  telling record and sufficient to favour the theory of her personal guilt if,  after due thought, certain facts in contradiction to this assumption had not  offered themselves to his mind even before he thought of Frederick as the  unknown man she had followed down the hillside, as, for instance:</p>
  <p>This  crime, if committed by her, was done deliberately and with a premeditation  antedating her departure from the ballroom. Yet she went upon this errand in  slippers, white slippers at that, something which so cool and calculating a  woman would have avoided, however careless she might have shown herself in  other regards.</p>
  <p>Again,  guilt awakens cunning, even in the dullest breast; but she, keen beyond most  men even, and so self-poised that the most searching examination could not  shake her self-control, betrayed an utter carelessness as to what she did with  these slippers on her return, thrusting them into a place easily accessible to  the most casual search. Had she been conscious of guilt and thus amenable to  law, the sight of blood and mud-stains on those slippers would have appalled her,  and she would have made some attempt to destroy them, and not put them behind a  picture and forgotten them.</p>
  <p>Again,  would she have been so careless with a flower she knew to be identified with  herself? A woman who deliberately involves herself in crime has quick eyes; she  would have seen that flower fall. At all events, if she had been immediately  responsible for its being on the scene of crime she would, with her quick wit,  have found some excuse or explanation for it, instead of defying her examiners with  some such words as these: &ldquo;It is a fact for you to explain. I only know that I  did not carry this flower into that room of death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again,  had she been actuated in her attempt to fix the crime on old James Zabel by a  personal consciousness of guilt and a personal dread, she would not have  stopped at suggestion in her allusions to the person she watched burying the  treasure in the woods. Instead of speaking of him as a shadow whose flight she  had followed at a distance, she would have described his figure as that of the  same old man she had seen enter the Zabel cottage a few minutes before, there  being no reason for indefiniteness on this point, her conscience being  sufficiently elastic for any falsehood that would further her ends. And lastly,  her manner, under the examination to which she had been subjected, was not that  of one who felt herself under a personal attack. It was a strange, suggestive,  hesitating manner, baffling alike to him who had more or less sounded her  strange nature and to those who had no previous knowledge of her freaks and  subtle intellectual power, and only reaching its height of hateful charm and  mysterious daring when Frederick appeared on the scene and joined, or seemed to  join, himself to the number of her examiners.</p>
  <p>Now,  let all suspicion of her as an active agent in this crime be dropped, assume  Frederick to be the culprit and she the simple accessory after the fact, and  see how inconsistencies vanish, and how much more natural the whole conduct of  this mysterious woman appears.</p>
  <p>Amabel  Page left a merry dance at midnight and stole away into the Sutherland garden  in her party dress and slippers&mdash;why? Not to fulfil an errand which anyone who  knows her cold and unsympathetic nature can but regard as a pretext, but  because she felt it imperative to see if her lover (with whose character,  temptations, and necessities she was fully acquainted, and in whose excited and  preoccupied manner she had probably discovered signs of a secretly growing  purpose) meant indeed to elude his guests and slip away to town on the  dangerous and unholy enterprise suggested by their mutual knowledge of the  money to be obtained there by one daring enough to enter a certain house open  like their own to midnight visitors.</p>
  <p>She  followed at such an hour and into such a place, not an unknown man casually  come upon, but her lover, whom she had tracked from the garden of his father&rsquo;s  house, where she had lain in wait for him. It took courage to do this, but a  courage no longer beyond the limit of feminine daring, for her fate was bound  up in his and she could not but feel the impulse to save him from the  consequences of crime, if not from the crime itself.</p>
  <p>As  for the aforementioned flower, what more natural than that Frederick should  have transferred it from her hair to his buttonhole during some of their  interviews at the ball, and that it should have fallen from its place to the  floor in the midst of his possible struggle with Batsy?</p>
  <p>And  with this assumption of her perfect knowledge as to who the man was who had  entered Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s house, how much easier it is to understand why she did not  lift her head when she heard him descend the stairs! No woman, even one so  depraved as she, would wish to see the handsome face of her lover in the glare  of a freshly committed crime, and besides she might very easily be afraid of  him, for a man has but a blow for the suddenly detected witness of his crime  unless that witness is his confidant, which from every indication Sweetwater  felt bound to believe Amabel was not.</p>
  <p>Her  flight to the Zabel cottage, after an experience which would madden most women,  can now be understood. She was still following her lover. The plan of making  Agatha&rsquo;s old and wretched friend amenable for her death originated with  Frederick and not with Amabel. It was he who first started for the Zabel  cottage. It was he who left the bank bill there. This is all clear, and even  the one contradictory fact of the dagger having been seen in the old man&rsquo;s hand  was not a stumbling-block to Sweetwater. With the audacity of one confident of  his own insight, he explained it to himself thus: The dagger thrown from the  window by the assassin, possibly because he knew of Zabel&rsquo;s expected visit  there that night, fell on the grass and was picked up by Amabel, only to be  flung down again in the brightest part of the lawn. It was lying there then,  when, a few minutes later and before either Frederick or Amabel had left the  house, the old man entered the yard in a state of misery bordering on frenzy.  He and his brother were starving, had been starving for days. He was too proud  to own his want, and too loyal to his brother to leave him for the sake of the  food prepared for them both at Agatha&rsquo;s house, and this was why he had  hesitated over his duty till this late hour, when his own secret misery or,  perhaps, the hope of relieving his brother drove him to enter the gate he had  been accustomed to see open before him in glad hospitality. He finds the lights  burning in the house above and below, and encouraged by the welcome they seem  to hold out, he staggers up the path, ignorant of the tragedy which was at that  very moment being enacted behind those lighted windows. But half-way toward the  house he stops, the courage which has brought him so far suddenly fails, and in  one of those quick visions which sometimes visit men in extremity, he foresees  the astonishment which his emaciated figure is likely to cause in these two old  friends, and burying his face in his hands he stops and bitterly communes with  himself before venturing farther. Fatal stop! fatal communing! for as he stands  there he sees a dagger, his own old dagger, how lost or how found he probably  did not stop to ask, lying on the grass and offering in its dumb way  suggestions as to how he might end this struggle without any further suffering.  Dizzy with the new hope, preferring death to the humiliation he saw before him  in Agatha&rsquo;s cottage, he dashes out of the yard, almost upsetting Mr. Crane, who  was passing by on his homeward way from an errand of mercy. A little while  later Amabel comes upon him lying across his own doorstep. He has made an  effort to enter, but his long walk and the excitement of this last bitter hour  have been too much for him. As she watches him he gains strength and struggles  to his feet, while she, aghast at the sight of the dagger she had herself flung  down in Agatha&rsquo;s yard, and dreading the encounter between this old man and the  lover she had been following to this place, creeps around the house and looks  into the first window she finds open. What does she expect to see? Frederick  brought face to face with this desperate figure with its uplifted knife. But  instead of that she beholds another old man seated at a table and&mdash;Amabel had  paused when she reached that AND&mdash;and Sweetwater had not then seen how important  this pause was, but now he understood it. Now he saw that if she had not had a  subtle purpose in view, that if she had wished to tell the truth rather than  produce false inferences in the minds of those about her calculated to save the  criminal as she called him, she would have completed her sentence thus: &ldquo;I saw  an old man seated at a table and Frederick Sutherland standing over him.&rdquo; For  Sweetwater had no longer a doubt that Frederick was in that room at that  moment. What further she saw, whether she was witness to an encounter between  this intruder and James, or whether by some lingering on the latter&rsquo;s part  Frederick was able to leave the house without running across him, was a matter  of comparative unimportance. What is of importance is that he did leave it and  that Amabel, knowing it was Frederick, strove to make her auditors believe it  was Zabel, who carried the remainder of the money into the woods. Yet she did  not say so, and if her words on this subject could be carefully recalled, one  would see that it was still her lover she was following and no old man,  tottering on the verge of the grave and only surviving because of the task he  was bent on performing.</p>
  <p>Amabel&rsquo;s  excuse for handling the treasure, and for her reburial of the same, comes now  within the bounds of possibility. She hoped to share this money some day, and  her greed was too great for her to let such an amount lie there untouched,  while her caution led her to bury it deeper, even at the risk of the discovery  she was too inexperienced to fear.</p>
  <p>That  she should forget to feign surprise when the alarm of murder was raised was  very natural, and so was the fact that a woman with a soul so blunted to all  delicate instincts, and with a mind so intent upon perfecting the scheme  entered into by the murderer of throwing the blame upon the man whose dagger  had been made use of, should persist in visiting the scene of crime and calling  attention to the spot where that dagger had fallen. And so with her manner  before her examiners. Baffling as that manner was, it still showed streaks of  consistency, when you thought of it as the cloak of a subtle, unprincipled  woman, who sees amongst her interlocutors the guilty man whom by a word she can  destroy, but whom she exerts herself to save, even at the cost of a series of  bizarre explanations. She was playing with a life, a life she loved, but not  with sincerity sufficient to rob the game of a certain delicate, if  inconceivable, intellectual enjoyment. * </p>
  <p class="footnote">*  That Sweetwater in his hate, and with no real clew to the real situation,  should come so near the truth as in this last supposition, shows the keenness  of his insight.</p>
  <p>And  Frederick? Had there been anything in his former life or in his conduct since  the murder to give the lie to these heavy doubts against him? On the contrary.  Though Sweetwater knew little of the dark record which had made this young man  the disgrace of his family, what he did know was so much against him that he  could well see that the distance usually existing between simple dissipation  and desperate crime might be easily bridged by some great necessity for money.  Had there been such a necessity? Sweetwater found it easy to believe so. And  Frederick&rsquo;s manner? Was it that of an honest man simply shocked by the  suspicions which had fallen upon the woman he loved? Had he, Sweetwater, not  observed certain telltale moments in his late behaviour that required a deeper  explanation even than this?</p>
  <p>The  cry, for instance, with which he had rushed from the empty ballroom into the  woods on the opposite side of the road! Was it a natural cry or an easily  explainable one? &ldquo;Thank God! this terrible night is over!&rdquo; Strange language to  be uttered by this man at such a time and in such a place, if he did not  already know what was to make this night of nights memorable through all this  region. He did know, and this cry which had struck Sweetwater strangely at the  time and still more strangely when he regarded it simply as a coincidence, now  took on all the force of a revelation and the irresistible bubbling up in Frederick&rsquo;s  breast of that remorse which had just found its full expression on Agatha&rsquo;s  grave.</p>
  <p>To  some that remorse and all his other signs of suffering might be explained by  his passion for the real criminal. But to Sweetwater it was only too evident  that an egotist like Frederick Sutherland cannot suffer for another to such an  extent as this, and that a personal explanation must be given for so personal a  grief, even if that explanation involves the dreadful charge of murder.</p>
  <p>It  was when Sweetwater reached this point in his reasoning that Frederick  disappeared beneath Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s porch, and Mr. Sutherland came up behind  him. After the short conversation in which Sweetwater saw his own doubts more  than reflected in the uneasy consciousness of this stricken father, he went  home and the struggle of his life began.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
    Sweetwater Acts</b></h2>
  <p>Sweetwater  had promised Mr. Sutherland that he would keep counsel in regard to his present  convictions concerning Frederick&rsquo;s guilt; but this he knew he could not do if he  remained in Sutherlandtown and fell under the pitiless examination of Mr.  Courtney, the shrewd and able prosecuting attorney of the district. He was too  young, too honest, and had made himself too conspicuous in this affair to  succeed in an undertaking requiring so much dissimulation, if not actual  falsehood. Indeed, he was not sure that in his present state of mind he could  hear Frederick&rsquo;s name mentioned without flushing, and slight as such a hint  might be, it would be enough to direct attention to Frederick, which once done  could but lead to discovery and permanent disgrace to all who bore the name of  Sutherland.</p>
  <p>What  was he to do then? How avoid a consequence he found himself absolutely unable  to face? It was a problem which this night must solve for him. But how? As I  have said, he went down to his house to think.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  was not a man of absolute rectitude. He was not so much high-minded as  large-hearted. He had, besides, certain foibles. In the first place, he was  vain, and vanity in a very plain man is all the more acute since it centres in  his capabilities, rather than in his appearance. Had Sweetwater been handsome,  or even passably attractive, he might have been satisfied with the approbation  of demure maidens and a comradeship with his fellows. But being one who could  hope for nothing of this kind, not even for a decent return to the unreasoning  heart-worship he felt himself capable of paying, and which he had once paid for  a few short days till warned of his presumption by the insolence of the  recipient, he had fixed his hope and his ambition on doing something which  would rouse the admiration of those about him and bring him into that  prominence to which he felt himself entitled. That he, a skilful musician,  should desire to be known as a brilliant detective, is only one of the  anomalies of human nature which it would be folly and a waste of time on our  part to endeavour to explain. That, having chosen to exercise his wits in this  way, he should so well succeed that he dared not for his life continue in the  work he had so publicly undertaken, occasioned in him a pang of disappointment  almost as insufferable as that brought by the realisation of what his efforts  were likely to bring upon the man to whose benevolence he owed his very life.  Hence his struggle, which must be measured by the extent of his desires and the  limitations which had been set to his nature by his surroundings and the  circumstances of his life and daily history.</p>
  <p>If  we enter with him into the humble cottage where he was born and from which he  had hardly strayed more than a dozen miles in the twenty-two years of his  circumscribed life, we may be able to understand him better.</p>
  <p>It  was an unpainted house perched on an arid hillside, with nothing before it but  the limitless sea. He had found his way to it mechanically, but as he  approached the narrow doorway he paused and turned his face towards the stretch  of heaving waters, whose low or loud booming had been first his cradle song and  then the ceaseless accompaniment of his later thoughts and aspirations. It was  heaving yet, ceaselessly heaving, and in its loud complaint there was a sound  of moaning not always to be found there, or so it seemed to Sweetwater in his  present troubled mood.</p>
  <p>Sighing  as this sound reached his ear, and shuddering as its meaning touched his heart,  Sweetwater pushed open the door of his small house, and entered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is I, mamsie!&rdquo; he shouted, in what he meant to be his usual voice; but to a  sensitive ear&mdash;and what ear is so sensitive as a mother&rsquo;s?&mdash;there was a tremble  in it that was not wholly natural.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  anything the matter, dear?&rdquo; called out that mother, in reply.</p>
  <p>The  question made him start, though he replied quickly enough, and in more guarded  tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  mamsie. Go to sleep. I&rsquo;m tired, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Would  to God that was all! He recalled with envy the days when he dragged himself  into the house at sundown, after twelve long hours of work on the docks. As he  paused in the dark hallway and listened till he heard the breathing of her who  had called him <i>dear</i>&mdash;the only one in  the world who ever had or ever would call him <i>dear</i>&mdash;he had glimpses of that old self which made him question if  his self-tutoring on the violin, and the restless ambition which had driven him  out of the ways of his ancestors into strange attempts for which he was not  prepared by any previous discipline, had brought him happiness or improved his  manhood. He was forced to acknowledge that the sleep of those far-distant  nights of his busy boyhood was sweeter than the wakefulness of these later days,  and that it would have been better for him, and infinitely better for her, if  he had remained at the carpenter&rsquo;s bench and been satisfied with a repetition  of his father&rsquo;s existence.</p>
  <p>His  mother was the only person sharing that small house with him, and once assured  that she was asleep, he lighted a lamp in the empty kitchen and sat down.</p>
  <p>It  was just twelve o&rsquo;clock. This, to anyone accustomed to this peculiar young man&rsquo;s  habits, had nothing unusual in it. He was accustomed to come home late and sit  thus by himself for a short time before going up-stairs. But, to one capable of  reading his sharp and none too mobile countenance, there was a change in the  character of the brooding into which he now sank, which, had that mother been  awake to watch him, would have made every turn of his eye and movement of his  hand interesting and important.</p>
  <p>In  the first place, the careless attitude into which he had fallen was totally at  variance with the restless glance which took in every object in that well-known  room so associated with his mother and her daily work that he could not imagine  her in any other surroundings, and wondered sometimes if she would seem any  longer his mother if transplanted to other scenes and engaged in other tasks.</p>
  <p>Little  things, petty objects of household use or ornament, which he had seen all his  life without specially noticing them, seemed under the stress of his present  mood to acquire a sudden importance and fix themselves indelibly in his memory.  There, on a nail driven long before he was born, hung the little round  lid-holder he had pieced together in his earliest years and presented to his  mother in a gush of pride greater than any he had since experienced. She had  never used it, but it always hung upon the one nail in the one place, as a symbol  of his love and of hers. And there, higher up on the end of the shelf barren  enough of ornaments, God wot, were a broken toy and a much-defaced primer,  mementos likewise of his childhood; and farther along the wall, on a sort of  raised bench, a keg, the spigot of which he was once guilty of turning on in  his infantile longing for sweets, only to find he could not turn it back again  until all the floor was covered with molasses, and his appetite for the  forbidden gratified to the full. And yonder, dangling from a peg, never devoted  to any other use, hung his father&rsquo;s old hat, just where he had placed it on the  fatal morning when he came in and lay down on the sitting-room lounge for the  last time; and close to it, lovingly close to it, Sweetwater thought, his  mother&rsquo;s apron, the apron he had seen her wear at supper, and which he would  see her wear at breakfast, with all its suggestions of ceaseless work and  patient every-day thrift.</p>
  <p>Somehow,  he could not bear the sight of that apron. With the expectation now forming in  his mind, of leaving this home and leaving this mother, this symbol of humble  toil became an intolerable grief to him. Jumping up, he turned in another  direction; but now another group of objects equally eloquent came under his  eye. It was his mother&rsquo;s work-basket he saw, with a piece of sewing in it  intended for him, and as if this were not enough, the table set for two, and at  his place a little covered dish which held the one sweetmeat he craved for  breakfast. The spectacles lying beside her plate told him how old she was, and  as he thought of her failing strength and enfeebled ways, he jumped up again  and sought another corner. But here his glances fell on his violin, and a new  series of emotions awakened within him. He loved the instrument and played as  much from natural intuition as acquired knowledge, but in the plan of action he  had laid out for himself his violin could have no part. He would have to leave  it behind. Feeling that his regrets were fast becoming too much for him, he  left the humble kitchen and went up-stairs. But not to sleep. Locking the door  (something he never remembered doing before in all his life), he began to  handle over his clothes and other trivial belongings. Choosing out a certain  strong suit, he laid it out on the bed and then went to a bureau drawer and  drew out an old-fashioned wallet. This he opened, but after he had counted the  few bills it contained he shook his head and put them all back, only retaining  a little silver, which he slipped into one of the pockets of the suit he had  chosen. Then he searched for and found a little Bible which his mother had once  given him. He was about to thrust that into another pocket, but he seemed to  think better of this, too, for he ended by putting it back into the drawer and  taking instead a bit from one of his mother&rsquo;s old aprons which he had chanced  upon on the stairway. This he placed as carefully in his watch pocket as if it  had been the picture of a girl he loved. Then he undressed and went to bed.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Sweetwater said afterwards that she never knew Caleb to talk so much and eat so  little as he did that next morning at breakfast. Such plans as he detailed for  unmasking the murderer of Mrs. Webb! Such business for the day! So many people  to see! It made her quite dizzy, she said. And, indeed, Sweetwater was more  than usually voluble that morning,&mdash;perhaps because he could not bear his mother&rsquo;s  satisfied smile; and when he went out of the house it was with a laugh and a  cheery &ldquo;Good-bye, mamsie&rdquo; that was in spiking contrast to the irrepressible  exclamation of grief which escaped him when the door was closed between them.  Ah, when should he enter those four walls again, and when should he see the old  mother?</p>
  <p>He  proceeded immediately to town. A ship was preparing to sail that morning for  the Brazils, and the wharves were alive with bustle. He stopped a moment to  contemplate the great hulk rising and falling at her moorings, then he passed  on and entered the building where he had every reason to expect to find Dr.  Talbot and Knapp in discussion. It was very important to him that morning to  learn just how they felt concerning the great matter absorbing him, for if  suspicion was taking the direction of Frederick, or if he saw it was at all  likely to do so, then would his struggle be cut short and all necessity for  leaving town be at an end. It was to save Frederick from this danger that he  was prepared to cut all the ties binding him to this place, and nothing short  of the prospect of accomplishing this would make him willing to undergo such a  sacrifice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Sweetwater, any news, eh?&rdquo; was the half-jeering, half-condescending greeting he  received from the coroner.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  who had regained entire control over his feelings as soon as he found himself  under the eye of this man and the supercilious detective he had attempted to  rival, gave a careless shrug and passed the question on to Knapp. &ldquo;Have you any  news?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>Knapp,  who would probably not have acknowledged it if he had, smiled the indulgent  smile of a self-satisfied superior and uttered a few equivocal sentences. This  was gall and wormwood to Sweetwater, but he kept his temper admirably and, with  an air of bravado entirely assumed for the occasion, said to Dr. Talbot:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I shall have something to tell you soon which will materially aid you in  your search for witnesses. By to-morrow, at least, I shall know whether I am  right or wrong in thinking I have discovered an important witness in quite an  unexpected quarter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  knew of no new witness, but it was necessary for him not only to have a pretext  for the move he contemplated, but to so impress these men with an idea of his  extreme interest in the approaching proceedings, that no suspicion should ever  arise of his having premeditated an escape from them. He wished to appear the  victim of accident; and this is why he took nothing from his home which would  betray any intention of leaving it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!  indeed!&rdquo; ejaculated the coroner with growing interest. &ldquo;And may I ask&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo;  urged Sweetwater, with a side look at Knapp, &ldquo;do not ask me anything just yet.  This afternoon, say, after I have had a certain interview with&mdash;What, are they  setting sails on the <i>Hesper</i> already?&rdquo;  he burst out, with a quick glance from the window at the great ship riding at  anchor a little distance from them in the harbour. &ldquo;There is a man on her I  must see. Excuse me&mdash;Oh, Mr. Sutherland!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  fell back in confusion. That gentleman had just entered the room in company  with Frederick.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
    A Sinister Pair</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon,&rdquo; stammered Sweetwater, starting aside and losing on the  instant all further disposition to leave the room.</p>
  <p>Indeed,  he had not the courage to do so, even if he had had the will. The joint  appearance of these two men in this place, and at an hour so far in advance of  that which usually saw Mr. Sutherland enter the town, was far too significant  in his eyes for him to ignore it. Had any explanation taken place between them,  and had Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s integrity triumphed over personal considerations to  the point of his bringing Frederick here to confess?</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Dr. Talbot had risen with a full and hearty greeting which proved to Sweetwater&rsquo;s  uneasy mind that notwithstanding Knapp&rsquo;s disquieting reticence no direct  suspicion had as yet fallen on the unhappy Frederick. Then he waited for what  Mr. Sutherland had to say, for it was evident he had come there to say  something. Sweetwater waited, too, frozen almost into immobility by the fear  that it would be something injudicious, for never had he seen any man so  changed as Mr. Sutherland in these last twelve hours, nor did it need a highly  penetrating eye to detect that the relations between him and Frederick were  strained to a point that made it almost impossible for them to more than assume  their old confidential attitude. Knapp, knowing them but superficially, did not  perceive this, but Dr. Talbot was not blind to it, as was shown by the  inquiring look he directed towards them both while waiting.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland spoke at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me for interrupting you so early,&rdquo; said he, with a certain tremble in his voice  which Sweetwater quaked to hear. &ldquo;For certain reasons, I should be very glad to  know, <i>we</i> should be very glad to know,  if during your investigations into the cause and manner of Agatha Webb&rsquo;s death,  you have come upon a copy of her will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Talbot  was at once interested, so was Knapp, while Sweetwater withdrew further into  his corner in anxious endeavour to hide his blanching cheek. &ldquo;We have found  nothing. We do not even know that she has made a will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ask,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Sutherland, with a slight glance toward Frederick, who  seemed, at least in Sweetwater&rsquo;s judgment, to have braced himself up to bear  this interview unmoved, &ldquo;because I have not only received intimation that she  made such a will, but have even been entrusted with a copy of it as chief  executor of the same. It came to me in a letter from Boston yesterday. Its  contents were a surprise to me. Frederick, hand me a chair. These accumulated  misfortunes&mdash;for we all suffer under the afflictions which have beset this town&mdash;have  made me feel my years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  drew his breath more freely. He thought he might understand by this last  sentence that Mr. Sutherland had come here for a different cause than he had at  first feared. Frederick, on the contrary, betrayed a failing ability to hide  his emotion. He brought his father a chair, placed it, and was drawing back out  of sight when Mr. Sutherland prevented him by a mild command to hand the paper  he had brought to the coroner.</p>
  <p>There  was something in his manner that made Sweetwater lean forward and Frederick  look up, so that the father&rsquo;s and son&rsquo;s eyes met under that young man&rsquo;s  scrutiny. But while he saw meaning in both their regards, there was nothing  like collusion, and, baffled by these appearances, which, while interesting,  told him little or nothing, he transferred his attention to Dr. Talbot and  Knapp, who had drawn together to see what this paper contained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I have said, the contents of this will are a surprise to me,&rdquo; faltered Mr.  Sutherland. &ldquo;They are equally so to my son. He can hardly be said to have been  a friend even of the extraordinary woman who thus leaves him her whole fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never spoke with her but twice,&rdquo; exclaimed Frederick with a studied coldness,  which was so evidently the cloak of inner agitation that Sweetwater trembled  for its effect, notwithstanding the state of his own thoughts, which were in a  ferment. Frederick, the inheritor of Agatha Webb&rsquo;s fortune! Frederick,  concerning whom his father had said on the previous night that he possessed no  motive for wishing this good woman&rsquo;s death! Was it the discovery that such a  motive existed which had so aged this man in the last twelve hours? Sweetwater  dared not turn again to see. His own face might convey too much of his own  fears, doubts, and struggle.</p>
  <p>But  the coroner, for whose next words Sweetwater listened with acute expectancy,  seemed to be moved simply by the unexpectedness of the occurrence. Glancing at  Frederick with more interest than he had ever before shown him, he cried with a  certain show of enthusiasm:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  pretty fortune! A very pretty fortune!&rdquo; Then with a deprecatory air natural to  him in addressing Mr. Sutherland, &ldquo;Would it be indiscreet for me to ask to what  our dear friend Agatha alludes in her reference to your late lamented wife?&rdquo; His  finger was on a clause of the will and his lips next minute mechanically  repeated what he was pointing at:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In  remembrance of services rendered me in early life by Marietta Sutherland, wife  of Charles Sutherland of Sutherlandtown, I bequeath to Frederick, sole child of  her affection, all the property, real and personal, of which I die possessed.&rsquo;  Services rendered! They must have been very important ones,&rdquo; suggested Dr.  Talbot.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland&rsquo;s expression was one of entire perplexity and doubt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not remember my wife ever speaking of any special act of kindness she was  enabled to show Agatha Webb. They were always friends, but never intimate ones.  However, Agatha could be trusted to make no mistake. She doubtless knew to what  she referred. Mrs. Sutherland was fully capable of doing an extremely kind act  in secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  all his respect for the speaker, Dr. Talbot did not seem quite satisfied. He  glanced at Frederick and fumbled the paper uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  you were acquainted with the reason for this legacy&mdash;this large legacy,&rdquo; he  emphasised.</p>
  <p>Frederick,  thus called upon, nay, forced to speak, raised his head, and without perhaps  bestowing so much as a thought on the young man behind him who was inwardly  quivering in anxious expectancy of some betrayal on his part which would  precipitate disgrace and lifelong sorrow on all who bore the name of  Sutherland, met Dr. Talbot&rsquo;s inquiring glance with a simple earnestness  surprising to them all, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  record is so much against me that I am not surprised that you wonder at my  being left with Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s fortune. Perhaps she did not fully realise the lack  of estimation in which I am deservedly held in this place, or perhaps, and this  would be much more like her, she hoped that the responsibility of owing my independence  to so good and so unfortunate a woman might make a man of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a manliness in Frederick&rsquo;s words and bearing that took them all by  surprise. Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s dejection visibly lightened, while Sweetwater,  conscious of the more than vital interests hanging upon the impression which  might be made by this event upon the minds of the men present, turned slightly  so as to bring their faces into the line of his vision.</p>
  <p>The  result was a conviction that as yet no real suspicion of Frederick had seized  upon either of their minds. Knapp&rsquo;s face was perfectly calm and almost  indifferent, while the good coroner, who saw this and every other circumstance  connected with this affair through the one medium of his belief in Amabel&rsquo;s  guilt, was surveying Frederick with something like sympathy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that others were not as ignorant of your prospective good  fortune as you were yourself,&rdquo; at which Frederick&rsquo;s cheek turned a dark red,  though he said nothing, and Sweetwater, with a sudden involuntary gesture  indicative of resolve, gazed for a moment breathlessly at the ship, and then  with an unexpected and highly impetuous movement dashed from the room crying  loudly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  seen him! I&rsquo;ve seen him! he&rsquo;s just going on board the ship. Wait for me, Dr. Talbot.  I&rsquo;ll be back in fifteen minutes with such a witness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  the door slammed. But they could hear his hurrying footsteps as he plunged down  the stairs and rushed away from the building.</p>
  <p>It  was an unexpected termination to an interview fast becoming unbearable to the  two Sutherlands, but no one, not even the old gentleman himself, took in its  full significance.</p>
  <p>He  was, however, more than agitated by the occurrence and could hardly prevent  himself from repeating aloud Sweetwater&rsquo;s final word, which after their  interview at Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s gate, the night before, seemed to convey to him at  once a warning and a threat. To keep himself from what he feared might prove a  self-betrayal, he faltered out in very evident dismay:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter? What has come over the lad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  cried Dr. Talbot, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s been watching that ship for an hour. He is after some  man he has just seen go aboard her. Says he&rsquo;s a new and important witness in  this case. Perhaps he is. Sweetwater is no man&rsquo;s fool, for all his small eyes and  retreating chin. If you want proof of it, wait till he comes back. He&rsquo;ll be  sure to have something to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  they had all pressed forward to the window. Frederick, who carefully kept his  face out of his father&rsquo;s view, bent half-way over the sill in his anxiety to  watch the flying figure of Sweetwater, who was making straight for the dock,  while Knapp, roused at last, leaned over his shoulder and pointed to the  sailors on the deck, who were pulling in the last ropes, preparatory to  sailing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  too late: they won&rsquo;t let him aboard now. What a fool to hang around here till  he saw his man, instead of being at the dock to nab him! That comes of trusting  a country bumpkin. I knew he&rsquo;d fail us at the pinch. They lack training, these  would-be detectives. See, now! He&rsquo;s run up against the mate, and the mate  pushes him back. His cake is all dough, unless he&rsquo;s got a warrant. Has he a  warrant, Dr. Talbot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said the coroner, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t ask for one. He didn&rsquo;t even tell me whom he  wanted. Can it be one of those two passengers you see on the forward deck,  there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  might well be. Even from a distance these two men presented a sinister  appearance that made them quite marked figures among the crowd of hurrying  sailors and belated passengers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of them is peering over the rail with a very evident air of anxiety. His eye is  on Sweetwater, who is dancing with impatience. See, he is gesticulating like a  monkey, and&mdash;By the powers, they are going to let him go aboard!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland, who had been leaning heavily against the window-jamb in the  agitation of doubt and suspense which Sweetwater&rsquo;s unaccountable conduct had  evoked, here crossed to the other side and stole a determined look at  Frederick. Was his son personally interested in this attempt of the amateur  detective? Did he know whom Sweetwater sought, and was he suffering as much or  more than himself from the uncertainty and fearful possibilities of the moment?  He thought he knew Frederick&rsquo;s face, and that he read dread there, but  Frederick had changed so completely since the commission of this crime that  even his father could no longer be sure of the correct meaning either of his  words or expression.</p>
  <p>The  torture of the moment continued.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  climbs like a squirrel,&rdquo; remarked Dr. Talbot, with a touch of enthusiasm. &ldquo;Look  at him now&mdash;he&rsquo;s on the quarterdeck and will be down in the cabins before you  can say Jack Robinson. I warrant they have told him to hurry. Captain Dunlap  isn&rsquo;t the man to wait five minutes after the ropes are pulled in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  two men have shrunk away behind some mast or other,&rdquo; cried Knapp. &ldquo;They are the  fellows he&rsquo;s after. But what can they have to do with the murder? Have you ever  seen them here about town, Dr. Talbot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I remember; they have a foreign air about them. Look like 
    South Americans.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  they&rsquo;re going to South America. Sweetwater can&rsquo;t stop them. He has barely time  to get off the ship himself. There goes the last rope! Have they forgotten him?  They&rsquo;re drawing up the ladder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No:  the mate stops them; see, he&rsquo;s calling the fellow. I can hear his voice, can&rsquo;t  you? Sweetwater&rsquo;s game is up. He&rsquo;ll have to leave in a hurry. What&rsquo;s the rumpus  now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  only they&rsquo;ve scattered to look for him; the fox is down in the cabins and won&rsquo;t  come up, laughing in his sleeve, no doubt, at keeping the vessel waiting while  he hunts up his witness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it&rsquo;s one of those two men he&rsquo;s laying a trap for he won&rsquo;t snare him in a hurry.  They&rsquo;re sneaks, those two, and&mdash;Why, the sailors are coming back shaking their  heads. I can almost hear from here the captain&rsquo;s oaths.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  such a favourable wind for getting out of the harbour! Sweetwater, my boy, you  are distinguishing yourself. If your witness don&rsquo;t pan out well you won&rsquo;t hear  the last of this in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  looks as if they meant to sail without waiting to put him ashore,&rdquo; observed  Frederick in a low tone, too carefully modulated not to strike his father as  unnatural.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  jingoes, so it does!&rdquo; ejaculated Knapp. &ldquo;There go the sails! The pilot&rsquo;s hand  is on the wheel, and Dr. Talbot, are you going to let your cunning amateur  detective and his important witness slip away from you like this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot help myself,&rdquo; said the coroner, a little dazed himself at this  unexpected chance. &ldquo;My voice wouldn&rsquo;t reach them from this place; besides they  wouldn&rsquo;t heed me if it did. The ship is already under way and we won&rsquo;t see  Sweetwater again till the pilot&rsquo;s boat comes back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland moved from the window and crossed to the door like a man in a dream.  Frederick, instantly conscious of his departure, turned to follow him, but  presently stopped and addressing Knapp for the first time, observed quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is all very exciting, but I think your estimate of this fellow Sweetwater is  just. He&rsquo;s a busybody and craves notoriety above everything. He had no witness  on board, or, if he had, it was an imaginary one. You will see him return quite  crestfallen before night, with some trumped-up excuse of mistaken identity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  shrug which Knapp gave dismissed Sweetwater as completely from the affair as if  he had never been in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I may now regard myself as having this matter in my sole charge,&rdquo; was his  curt remark, as he turned away, while Frederick, with a respectful bow to Dr.  Talbot, remarked in leaving:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am at your service, Dr. Talbot, if you require me to testify at the inquest in  regard to this will. My testimony can all be concentrated into the one  sentence, &lsquo;I did not expect this bequest, and have no theories to advance in  explanation of it.&rsquo; But it has made me feel myself Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s debtor, and  given me a justifiable interest in the inquiry which, I am told, you open  to-morrow into the cause and manner of her death. If there is a guilty person  in this case, I shall raise no barrier in the way of his conviction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  while the coroner&rsquo;s face still showed the embarrassment which this last  sentence called up, his mind being now, as ever, fixed on Amabel, Frederick  offered his arm to his father, whose condition was not improved by the  excitements of the last half-hour, and proceeded to lead him from the building.</p>
  <p>Whatever  they thought, or however each strove to hide their conclusions from the other,  no words passed between them till they came in full sight of the sea, on a  distant billow of which the noble-ship bound for the Brazils rode triumphantly  on its outward course. Then Mr. Sutherland remarked, with a suggestive glance  at the vessel:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  young man who has found an unexpected passage on that vessel will not come back  with the pilot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  the sigh which was Frederick&rsquo;s only answer one of relief? It certainly seemed  so.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
    In The Shadow Of The Mast</b></h2>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland was right. Sweetwater did not return with the pilot. According to  the latter there was no Sweetwater on board the ship to return. At all events  the minutest search had not succeeded in finding him in the cabins, though no  one had seen him leave the vessel, or, indeed, seen him at all after his hasty  dash below decks. It was thought on board that he had succeeded in reaching  shore before the ship set sail, and the pilot was suitably surprised at  learning this was not so. So were Sweetwater&rsquo;s friends and associates with the  exception of a certain old gentleman living on the hill, and Knapp the  detective. He, that is the latter, had his explanation at his tongue&rsquo;s end:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweetwater  is a fakir. He thought he could carry off the honours from the regular force,  and when he found he couldn&rsquo;t he quietly disappeared. We shall hear of him  again in the Brazils.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  opinion that speedily gained ground, so that in a few hours Sweetwater was all  but forgotten, save by his mother, whose heart was filled with suspense, and by  Mr. Sutherland, whose breast was burdened by gratitude. The amazing fact of  Frederick, the village scapegrace and Amabel&rsquo;s reckless, if aristocratic,  lover, having been made the legatee of the upright Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s secret savings  had something to do with this. With such a topic at hand, not only the gossips,  but those who had the matter of Agatha&rsquo;s murder in hand, found ample material  to occupy their thoughts and tongues, without wasting time over a presumptuous  busybody, who had not wits enough to know that five minutes before sailing-time  is an unfortunate moment in which to enter a ship.</p>
  <p>And  where was Sweetwater, that he could not be found on the shore or on the ship?  We will follow him and see. Accustomed from his youth to ramble over the  vessels while in port, he knew this one as well as he did his mother&rsquo;s house.  It was, therefore, a surprise to the sailors when, shortly after the departure  of the pilot, they came upon him lying in the hold, half buried under a box  which had partially fallen upon him. He was unconscious, or appeared to be so,  and when brought into open light showed marks of physical distress and injury;  but his eye was clear and his expression hardly as rueful as one would expect  in a man who finds himself en route for the Brazils with barely a couple of  dollars in his pocket and every prospect of being obliged to work before the  mast to earn his passage. Even the captain noticed this and eyed him with suspicion.  But Sweetwater, rousing to the necessities of the occasion, forthwith showed  such a mixture of discouragement and perplexity that the honest sailor was  deceived and abated half at least of his oaths. He gave Sweetwater a hammock  and admitted him to the mess, but told him that as soon as his bruises allowed  him to work he should show himself on deck or expect the rough treatment  commonly bestowed on stowaways.</p>
  <p>It  was a prospect to daunt some men, but not Sweetwater. Indeed it was no more  than he had calculated upon when he left his savings behind with his old mother  and entered upon this enterprise with only a little change in his pocket. He  had undertaken out of love and gratitude to Mr. Sutherland to rid Frederick of  a dangerous witness and he felt able to complete the sacrifice. More than that,  he was even strangely happy for a time. The elation of the willing victim was  his, that is for a few short hours, then he began to think of his mother. How  had she borne his sudden departure? What would she think had befallen him, and  how long would he have to wait before he could send her word of his safety? If  he was to be of real service to the man he venerated, he must be lost long  enough for the public mind to have become settled in regard to the mysteries of  the Webb murder and for his own boastful connection with it to be forgotten.  This might mean years of exile. He rather thought it did; meanwhile his mother!  Of himself he thought little.</p>
  <p>By  sundown he felt himself sufficiently recovered from his bruises to go up on  deck. It was a mild night, and the sea was running in smooth long waves that as  yet but faintly presaged the storm brewing on the distant horizon. As he  inhaled the fresh air, the joy of renewed health began to infuse its life into  his veins and lift the oppression from his heart, and, glad of a few minutes of  quiet enjoyment, he withdrew to a solitary portion of the deck and allowed  himself to forget his troubles in contemplation of the rapidly deepening sky  and boundless stretch of waters.</p>
  <p>But  such griefs and anxieties as weighed upon this man&rsquo;s breast are not so easily  shaken off. Before he realised it his thoughts had recurred to the old theme,  and he was wondering if he was really of sufficient insignificance in the eyes  of his fellow-townsmen not to be sought for and found in that distant country  to which he was bound. Would they, in spite of his precautions, suspect that he  had planned this evasion and insist on his return, or would he be allowed to  slip away and drop out of sight like the white froth he was watching on the top  of the ever-shifting waves? He had boasted of possessing a witness. Would they  believe that boast and send a detective in search of him, or would they take  his words for the bombast they really were and proceed with their  investigations in happy relief at the loss of his intrusive assistance?</p>
  <p>As  this was a question impossible for him to answer, he turned to other thoughts  and fretted himself for a while with memories of Amabel&rsquo;s disdain and Frederick&rsquo;s  careless acceptance of a sacrifice he could never know the cost of, mixed  strangely with relief at being free of it all and on the verge of another life.  As the dark settled, his head fell farther and farther forward on the rail he  was leaning against, till he became to any passing eye but a blurred shadow  mixing with other shadows equally immovable.</p>
  <p>Unlike  them, however, his shadow suddenly shifted. Two men had drawn near him, one  speaking pure Spanish and the other English. The English was all that  Sweetwater could understand, and this half of the conversation was certainly  startling enough. Though he could not, of coarse, know to what or whom it  referred, and though it certainly had nothing to do with him, or any interest  he represented or understood, he could not help listening and remembering every  word. The English-speaking man uttered the first sentence he comprehended. It  was this:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  it be to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  answer was in Spanish.</p>
  <p>Again  the English voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has come up. I saw him distinctly as he passed the second mast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>More  Spanish; then English:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may if you want to, but I&rsquo;ll never breathe easy while he&rsquo;s on the ship. Are you  sure he&rsquo;s the fellow we fear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  rapid flow of words from which Sweetwater got nothing. Then slowly and  distinctly in the sinister tones he had already begun to shiver at:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. The R. F. A. should pay well for this,&rdquo; with the quick addition following  a hurried whisper: &ldquo;All right! I&rsquo;d send a dozen men to the bottom for half that  money. But &lsquo;ware there! Here&rsquo;s a fellow watching us! If he has heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  turned, saw two desperate faces projected toward him, realised that something  awful, unheard of, was about to happen, and would have uttered a yell of  dismay, but that the very intensity of his fright took away his breath. The next  minute he felt himself launched into space and enveloped in the darkness of the  chilling waters. He had been lifted bodily and flung headlong into the sea.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
    In Extremity</b></h2>
  <p>Sweetwater&rsquo;s  one thought as he sank was, &ldquo;Now Mr. Sutherland need fear me no longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the instinct of life is strong in every heart, and when he found himself  breathing the air again he threw out his arms wildly and grasped a spar.</p>
  <p>It  was life to him, hope, reconnection with his kind. He clutched, clung, and,  feeling himself floating, uttered a shout of mingled joy and appeal that  unhappily was smothered in the noise of the waters and the now rapidly rising  wind.</p>
  <p>Whence  had come this spar in his desperate need? He never knew, but somewhere in his  remote consciousness an impression remained of a shock to the waves following  his own plunge into the water, which might mean that this spar had been thrown  out after him, perhaps by the already repentant hands of the wretches who had  tossed him to his death. However it came, or from whatever source, it had at  least given him an opportunity to measure his doom and realise the agonies of  hope when it alternates with despair.</p>
  <p>The  darkness was impenetrable. It was no longer that of heaven, but of the nether  world, or so it seemed to this dazed soul, plunged suddenly from dreams of  exile into the valley of the shadow of death. And such a death! As he realised  its horrors, as he felt the chill of night and the oncoming storm strike its  piercing fangs into his marrow, and knew that his existence and the hope of  ever again seeing the dear old face at the fireside rested upon the strength of  his will and the tenacity of his life-clutch, he felt his heart fail, and the  breath that was his life cease in a gurgle of terror. But he clung on, and, though  no comfort came, still clung, while vague memories of long-ago shipwrecks, and  stories told in his youth of men, women, and children tossing for hours on a  drifting plank, flashed through his benumbed brain, and lent their horror to  his own sensations of apprehension and despair.</p>
  <p>He  wanted to live. Now that the dread spectre had risen out of the water and had  its clutch on his hair, he realised that the world held much for him, and that  even in exile he might work and love and enjoy God&rsquo;s heaven and earth, the  green fields and the blue sky. Not such skies as were above him now. No, this  was not sky that overarched him, but a horrible vault in which the clouds,  rushing in torn masses, had the aspect of demons stooping to contend for him  with those other demons that with long arms and irresistible grip were dragging  at him from below. He was alone on a whirling spar in the midst of a midnight  ocean, but horror and a pitiless imagination made this conflict more than that  of the elements, and his position an isolation beyond that of man removed from  his fellows. He was almost mad. Yet he clung.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  a better frame of mind prevailed. The sky was no lighter, save as the lightning  came to relieve the overwhelming darkness by a still more overwhelming glare,  nor were the waves less importunate or his hold on the spar more secure; but  the horror seemed to have lifted, and the practical nature of the man  reasserted itself. Other men had gone through worse dangers than these and  survived to tell the tale, as he might survive to tell his. The will was  all&mdash;will and an indomitable courage; and he had will and he had courage, or why  had he left his home to dare a hard and threatening future purely from a  sentiment of gratitude? Could he hold on long enough, daylight would come; and  if, as he now thought possible, he had been thrown into the sea within twenty  hours after leaving Sutherlandtown, then he must be not far from Cape Cod, and  in the direct line of travel from New York to Boston. Rescue would come, and if  the storm which was breaking over his head more and more furiously made it  difficult for him to retain his hold, it certainly would not wreck his spar or  drench him more than he was already drenched, while every blast would drive him  shoreward. The clinging was all, and filial love would make him do that, even  in the semi-unconsciousness which now and then swept over him. Only, would it  not be better for Mr. Sutherland if he should fail and drop away into the  yawning chasms of the unknown world beneath? There were moments when he thought  so, and then his clutch perceptibly weakened; but only once did he come near  losing his hold altogether. And that was when he thought he heard a laugh. A  laugh, here in the midst of ocean! in the midst of storm! a laugh! Were demons  a reality, then? Yes; but the demon he had heard was of his own imagination; it  had a face of Medusa sweetness and the laugh&mdash;Only Amabel&rsquo;s rang out so  thrillingly false, and with such diabolic triumph. Amabel, who might be  laughing in her dreams at this very moment of his supreme misery, and who  assuredly would laugh if conscious of his suffering and aware of the doom to  which his self-sacrifice had brought him. Amabel! the thought of her made the  night more dark, the waters more threatening, the future less promising. Yet he  would hold on if only to spite her who hated him and whom he hated almost as  much as he loved Mr. Sutherland.</p>
  <p>It  was his last conscious thought for hours. When morning broke he was but a  nerveless figure, with sense enough to cling, and that was all.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
    The Adventure Of The Parcel</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man! Haul him in! Don&rsquo;t leave a poor fellow drifting about like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  speaker, a bluff, hearty skipper, whose sturdy craft had outridden one of the  worst storms of the season, pointed to our poor friend Sweetwater, whose head  could just be seen above the broken spar he clung to. In another moment a  half-dozen hands were stretched for him, and the insensible form was drawn in  and laid on a deck which still showed the results of the night&rsquo;s fierce  conflict with the waters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn  it! how ugly he is!&rdquo; cried one of the sailors, with a leer at the half-drowned  man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see the lass we&rsquo;d please in saving him. He&rsquo;s only fit  to poison a devil-fish!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  though more than one laugh rang out, they gave him good care, and when  Sweetwater came to life and realised that his blood was pulsing warmly again  through his veins, and that a grey sky had taken the place of darkness, and a  sound board supported limbs which for hours had yielded helplessly to the  rocking billows, he saw a ring of hard but good-natured faces about him and  realised quite well what had been done for him when one of them said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There!  he&rsquo;ll do now; all hands on deck! We can get into New Bedford in two days if  this wind holds. Nor&rsquo; west!&rdquo; shouted the skipper to the man at the tiller. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  sup with our old women in forty-eight hours!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>New  Bedford! It was the only word Sweetwater heard. So, he was no farther away from  Sutherlandtown than that. Evidently Providence had not meant him to escape. Or  was it his fortitude that was being tried? A man as humble as he might easily  be lost even in a place as small as New Bedford. It was his identity he must  suppress. With that unrecognised he might remain in the next village to Sutherlandtown  without fear of being called up as a witness against Frederick. But could he  suppress it? He thought he could. At all events he meant to try.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  your name?&rdquo; were the words he now heard shouted in his ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jonathan  Briggs,&rdquo; was his mumbled reply. &ldquo;I was blown off a ship&rsquo;s deck in the gale last  night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  ship?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The <i>Proserpine</i>.&rdquo; It was the first name  that suggested itself to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I thought it might have been the <i>Hesper</i>;  she foundered off here last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Foundered?  The <i>Hesper</i>?&rdquo; The hot blood was  shooting now through his veins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  we just picked up her name-board. That was before we got a hold on you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Foundered!  The ship from which he had been so mercilessly thrown! And all on board lost,  perhaps. He began to realise the hand of Providence in his fate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was the <i>Hesper</i> I sailed on. I&rsquo;m not  just clear yet in my head. My first voyage was made on the <i>Proserpine</i>. Well, bless the gale that blew me from that deck!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  seemed incoherent, and they left him again for a little while. When they came  back he had his story all ready, which imposed upon them just so far as it was  for their interest. Their business on this coast was not precisely legitimate,  and when they found he simply wanted to be set on shore, they were quite  willing to do thus much for him. Only they regretted that he had barely two  dollars and his own soaked clothing to give in exchange for the motley garments  they trumped up among them for his present comfort. But he, as well as they,  made the best of a bad bargain, he especially, as his clothes, which would be  soon scattered among half a dozen families, were the only remaining clew  connecting him with his native town. He could now be Jonathan Briggs indeed.  Only who was Jonathan Briggs, and how was he to earn a living under these  unexpected conditions?</p>
  <p>At  the end of a couple of days he was dexterously landed on the end of a long  pier, which they passed without stopping, on their way to their own obscure  anchorage. As he jumped from the rail to the pier and felt again the touch of  terra firma he drew a long breath of uncontrollable elation. Yet he had not a  cent in the world, no friends, and certainly no prospects. He did not even know  whether to turn to the right or the left as he stepped out upon the docks, and  when he had decided to turn to the right as being on the whole more lucky, he  did not know whether to risk his fortune in the streets of the town or to  plunge into one of the low-browed drinking houses whose signs confronted him on  this water-lane.</p>
  <p>He  decided that his prospects for a dinner were slim in any case, and that his  only hope of breaking fast that day lay in the use he might make of one of his  three talents. Either he must find a fiddle to play on, a carpenter&rsquo;s bench to  work at, or a piece of detective shadowing to do. The last would bring him  before the notice of the police, which was just the thing he must avoid; so it  was fiddling or carpentry he must seek, either of which would be difficult to  obtain in his present garb. But of difficulties Sweetwater was not a man to  take note. He had undertaken out of pure love for a good man to lose himself.  He had accomplished this, and now was he to complain because in doing so he was  likely to go hungry for a day or two? No; Amabel might laugh at him, or he  might fancy she did, while struggling in the midst of rapidly engulfing waters,  but would she laugh at him now? He did not think she would. She was of the kind  who sometimes go hungry themselves in old age. Some premonition of this might  give her a fellow feeling.</p>
  <p>He  came to a stand before a little child sitting on an ill-kept doorstep. Smiling  at her kindly, he waited for her first expression to see how he appeared in the  eyes of innocence. Not so bad a man, it seemed, though his naturally plain  countenance was not relieved by the seaman&rsquo;s cap and knitted shirt he wore. For  she laughed as she looked at him, and only ran away because there wasn&rsquo;t room  for him to pass beside her.</p>
  <p>Comforted  a little, he sauntered on, glancing here and there with that sharp eye of his  for a piece of work to be done. Suddenly he came to a halt. A market-woman had  got into an altercation with an oysterman, and her stall had been upset in the  contention, and her vegetables were rolling here and there. He righted her  stall, picked up her vegetables, and in return got two apples and a red herring  he would not have given to a dog at home. Yet it was the sweetest morsel he had  ever tasted, and the apples might have been grown in the garden of the  Hesperides from the satisfaction and pleasure they gave this hungry man. Then,  refreshed, he dashed into the town. It should now go hard but he would earn a  night&rsquo;s lodging.</p>
  <p>The  day was windy and he was going along a narrow street, when something floated  down from a window above past his head. It was a woman&rsquo;s veil, and as he looked  up to see where it came from he met the eyes of its owner looking down from an  open casement above him. She was gesticulating, and seemed to point to someone  up the street. Glad to seize at anything which promised emolument or adventure,  he shouted up and asked her what she wanted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  man down there!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;the one in a long black coat going up the street.  Keep after him and stop him; tell him the telegram has come. Quick, quick,  before he gets around the corner! He will pay you; run!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  with joy in his heart,&mdash;for five cents was a boon to him in the present  condition of his affairs,&mdash;rushed after the man she had pointed out and hastily  stopped him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Someone,&rdquo;  he added, &ldquo;a woman in a window back there, bade me run after you and say the  telegram has come. She told me you would pay me,&rdquo; he added, for he saw the man  was turning hastily back, without thinking of the messenger. &ldquo;I need the money,  and the run was a sharp one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a preoccupied air, the man thrust his hand into his pocket, pulled out a coin,  and handed it to him. Then he walked hurriedly off. Evidently the news was  welcome to him. But Sweetwater stood rooted to the ground. The man had given  him a five-dollar gold piece instead of the nickel he had evidently intended.</p>
  <p>How  hungrily Sweetwater eyed that coin! In it was lodging, food, perhaps a new  article or so of clothing. But after a moment of indecision which might well be  forgiven him, he followed speedily after the man and overtook him just as he  reached the house from which the woman&rsquo;s veil had floated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir,  pardon me; but you gave me five dollars instead of five cents. It was a  mistake; I cannot keep the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man, who was not just the sort from whom kindness would be expected, looked at  the money in Sweetwater&rsquo;s palm, then at the miserable, mud-bespattered clothes  he wore (he had got that mud helping the poor market-woman), and stared hard at  the face of the man who looked so needy and yet returned him five dollars.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  an honest fellow,&rdquo; he declared, not offering to take back the gold piece. Then,  with a quick glance up at the window, &ldquo;Would you like to earn that money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  broke out into a smile, which changed his whole countenance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t  I, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man eyed him for another minute with scrutinising intensity. Then he said  shortly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  up-stairs with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  entered the house, went up a flight or two, and stopped at a door which was  slightly ajar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are going into the presence of a lady,&rdquo; remarked the man. &ldquo;Wait here until I  call you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  waited, the many thoughts going through his mind not preventing him from  observing all that passed.</p>
  <p>The  man, who had left the door wide open, approached the lady who was awaiting him,  and who was apparently the same one who had sent Sweetwater on his errand, and  entered into a low but animated conversation. She held a telegram in her hand  which she showed him, and then after a little earnest parley and a number of  pleading looks from them both toward the waiting Sweetwater, she disappeared  into another room, from which she brought a parcel neatly done up, which she  handed to the man with a strange gesture. Another hurried exchange of words and  a meaning look which did not escape the sharp eye of the watchful messenger,  and the man turned and gave the parcel into Sweetwater&rsquo;s hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are to carry this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to the town hall. In the second room to the right  on entering you will see a table surrounded by chairs, which at this hour ought  to be empty. At the head of the table you will find an arm-chair. On the table  directly in front of this you will lay this packet. Mark you, directly before  the chair and not too far from the edge of the table. Then you are to come out.  If you see anyone, say you came to leave some papers for Mr. Gifford. Do this  and you may keep the five dollars and welcome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  hesitated. There was something in the errand or in the manner of the man and  woman that he did not like.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  potter!&rdquo; spoke up the latter, with an impatient look at her watch. &ldquo;Mr. Gifford  will expect those papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater&rsquo;s  sensitive fingers closed on the package he held. It did not feel like papers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you going?&rdquo; asked the man.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  looked up with a smile. &ldquo;Large pay for so slight a commission,&rdquo; he ventured,  turning the packet over and over in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  then you will execute it at once, and according to the instructions I have  given you,&rdquo; retorted the man. &ldquo;It is your trustworthiness I pay for. Now go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  turned to go. After all it was probably all right, and five dollars easily  earned is doubly five dollars. As he reached the staircase he stumbled. The  shoes he wore did not fit him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  careful, there!&rdquo; shouted the woman, in a shrill, almost frightened voice, while  the man stumbled back into the room in a haste which seemed wholly uncalled  for. &ldquo;If you let the packet fall you will do injury to its contents. Go softly,  man, go softly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yet  they had said it held papers!</p>
  <p>Troubled,  yet hardly knowing what his duty was, Sweetwater hastened down the stairs, and  took his way up the street. The town hall should be easy to find; indeed, he  thought he saw it in the distance. As he went, he asked himself two questions:  Could he fail to deliver the package according to instructions, and yet earn  his money? And was there any way of so delivering it without risk to the  recipient or dereliction of duty to the man who had intrusted it to him and  whose money he wished to earn? To the first question his conscience at once  answered no; to the second the reply came more slowly, and before fixing his  mind determinedly upon it he asked himself why he felt that this was no  ordinary commission. He could answer readily enough. First, the pay was too  large, arguing that either the packet or the placing of the packet in a certain  position on Mr. Gifford&rsquo;s table was of uncommon importance to this man or this  woman. Secondly, the woman, though plainly and inconspicuously clad, had the  face of a more than ordinarily unscrupulous adventuress, while her companion  was one of those saturnine-faced men we sometimes meet, whose first look puts  us on our guard and whom, if we hope nothing from him, we instinctively shun.  Third, they did not look like inhabitants of the house and rooms in which he  found them. Nothing beyond the necessary articles of furniture was to be seen  there; not a trunk, not an article of clothing, nor any of the little things  that mark a woman&rsquo;s presence in a spot where she expects to spend a day or even  an hour. Consequently they were transients and perhaps already in the act of  flight. Then he was being followed. Of this he felt sure. He had followed  people himself, and something in his own sensations assured him that his  movements were under surveillance. It would, therefore, not do to show any  consciousness of this, and he went on directly and as straight to his goal as  his rather limited knowledge of the streets would allow. He was determined to  earn this money and to earn it without disadvantage to anyone. And he thought  he saw his way.</p>
  <p>At  the entrance of the town hall he hesitated an instant. An officer was standing  in the doorway, it would be easy to call his attention to the packet he held  and ask him to keep his eye on it. But this might involve him with the police,  and this was something, as we know, which he was more than anxious to avoid. He  reverted to his first idea.</p>
  <p>Mixing  with the crowd just now hurrying to and fro through the long corridors, he  reached the room designated and found it, as he had been warned he should,  empty.</p>
  <p>Approaching  the table, he laid down the packet just as he had been directed, in front of  the big arm chair, and then, casting a hurried look towards the door and  failing to find anyone watching him, he took up a pencil lying near-by and  scrawled hastily across the top of the packet the word &ldquo;Suspicious.&rdquo; This he  calculated would act as a warning to Mr. Gifford in case there was anything  wrong about the package, and pass as a joke with him, and even the sender, if  there was not. And satisfied that he had both earned his money and done justice  to his own apprehensions, he turned to retrace his steps. As before, the  corridors were alive with hurrying men of various ages and appearance, but only  two attracted his notice. One of these was a large, intellectual-looking man,  who turned into the room from which he had just emerged, and the other a short,  fair man, with a countenance he had known from boyhood. Mr. Stone of  Sutherlandtown was within ten paces of him, and he was as well known to the  good postmaster as the postmaster was to him. Could anyone have foreseen such a  chance!</p>
  <p>Turning  his back with a slow slouch, he made for a rear door he saw swinging in and out  before him. As he passed through he cast a quick look behind him. He had not  been recognised. In great relief he rushed on, knocking against a man standing  against one of the outside pillars.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo;  shouted this man.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  stopped. There was a tone of authority in the voice which he could not resist.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
    The Adventure Of The Scrap Of Paper And The Three Words</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you trying to do? Why do you fall over a man like that? Are you drunk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  drew himself up, made a sheepish bow, and muttered pantingly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, sir. I&rsquo;m in a hurry; I&rsquo;m a messenger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man who was not in a hurry seemed disposed to keep him for a moment. He had  caught sight of Sweetwater&rsquo;s eye, which was his one remarkable feature, and he  had also been impressed by that word messenger, for he repeated it with some  emphasis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  messenger, eh? Are you going on a message now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  who was anxious to get away from the vicinity of Mr. Stone, shrugged his  shoulders in careless denial, and was pushing on when the gentleman again  detained him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I like your looks? You are not a beauty, but you look  like a fellow who, if he promised to do a thing, would do it and do it mighty  well too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  could not restrain a certain movement of pride. He was honest, and he knew it,  but the fact had not always been so openly recognised.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have just earned five dollars by doing a commission for a man,&rdquo; said he, with a  straightforward look. &ldquo;See, sir. It was honestly earned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man, who was young and had a rather dashing but inscrutable physiognomy,  glanced at the coin Sweetwater showed him and betrayed a certain disappointment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you&rsquo;re flush,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want another job?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  as to that,&rdquo; said Sweetwater, edging slowly down the street, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always ready  for business. Five dollars won&rsquo;t last forever, and, besides, I&rsquo;m in need of new  togs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  rather,&rdquo; retorted the other, carelessly following him. &ldquo;Do you mind going up to  Boston?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boston!  Another jump toward home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Sweetwater, hesitatingly, &ldquo;not if it&rsquo;s made worth my while. 
    Do you want your message delivered to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  once. That is, this evening. It&rsquo;s a task involving patience and more or less  shrewd judgment. Have you these qualities, my friend? One would not judge it  from your clothes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  clothes!&rdquo; laughed Sweetwater. Life was growing very interesting all at once. &ldquo;I  know it takes patience to <i>wear</i> them,  and as for any lack of judgment I may show in their choice, I should just like  to say I did not choose them myself, sir; they fell to me promiscuous-like as a  sort of legacy from friends. You&rsquo;ll see what I&rsquo;ll do in that way if you give me  the chance to earn an extra ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  it&rsquo;s ten dollars you want. Well, come in here and have a drink and then we&rsquo;ll  see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  were before a saloon house of less than humble pretensions, and as he followed  the young gentleman in it struck him that it was himself rather than his  well-dressed and airy companion who would be expected to drink here. But he  made no remark, though he intended to surprise the man by his temperance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  look here,&rdquo; said the young gentleman, suddenly seating himself at a dingy table  in a very dark corner and motioning Sweetwater to do the same; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been  looking for a man all day to go up to Boston for me, and I think you&rsquo;ll do. You  know Boston?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  had great command over himself, but he flushed slightly at this question,  though it was so dark where he sat with this man that it made very little  difference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been there,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, then, you will go again to-night. You will arrive there about seven, you  will go the rounds of some half-dozen places whose names I will give you, and  when you come across a certain gentleman whom I will describe to you, you will  give him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a package?&rdquo; Sweetwater broke out with a certain sort of dread of a repetition  of his late experience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  this slip on which two words are written. He will want one more word, but  before you give it to him you must ask for your ten dollars. You&rsquo;ll get them,&rdquo;  he answered in response to a glance of suspicion from Sweetwater. Sweetwater  was convinced that he had got hold of another suspicious job. It made him a  little serious. &ldquo;Do I look like a go-between for crooks?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid I&rsquo;m not so much of a success as I thought myself.&rdquo; But he said to the  man before him: &ldquo;Ten dollars is small pay for such business. Twenty-five would  be nearer the mark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, he will give you twenty-five dollars. I forgot that ten dollars was but  little in advance of your expenses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five  if I find him, and he is in funds. What if I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except  your ticket; that I&rsquo;ll give you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  did not know what to say. Like the preceding job it might be innocent and it  might not. And then, he did not like going to Boston, where he was liable to  meet more than one who knew him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no harm in the business,&rdquo; observed the other, carelessly, pushing a glass of  whiskey which had just been served him toward Sweetwater. &ldquo;I would even be  willing to do it myself, if I could leave New Bedford to-night, but I can&rsquo;t.  Come! It&rsquo;s as easy as crooking your elbow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  now you said it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; growled Sweetwater, drinking from his glass. &ldquo;But no  matter about that, go ahead, I&rsquo;ll do it. Shall I have to buy other clothes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  buy a new pair of trousers,&rdquo; suggested the other. &ldquo;The rest you can get in  Boston. You don&rsquo;t want to be too much in evidence, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  agreed with. him. To attract attention was what he most dreaded. &ldquo;When does the  train start?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>The  young man told him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that will give me time to buy what I want. Now, what are your instructions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man gave him a memorandum, containing four addresses. &ldquo;You will find him  at one of these places,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And now to know your man when you see him.  He is a large, handsome fellow, with red hair and a moustache like the devil.  He has been hurt, and wears his left hand in a sling, but he can play cards,  and will be found playing cards, and in very good company too. You will have to  use your discretion in approaching him. When once he sees this bit of paper,  all will be easy. He knows what these two words mean well enough, and the third  one, the one that is worth twenty-five dollars to you, is <i>Frederick</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  who had drunk half his glass, started so at this word, which was always humming  in his brain, that he knocked over his tumbler and spilled what was left in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope I won&rsquo;t forget that word,&rdquo; he remarked, in a careless tone, intended to  carry off his momentary show of feeling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you do, then don&rsquo;t expect the twenty-five dollars,&rdquo; retorted the other,  finishing his own glass, but not offering to renew Sweetwater&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  laughed, said he thought he could trust his memory, and rose. In a half-hour he  was at the depot, and in another fifteen minutes speeding out of New Bedford on  his way to Boston.</p>
  <p>He  had had but one anxiety&mdash;that Mr. Stone might be going up to Boston too. But,  once relieved of this apprehension, he settled back, and for the first time in  twelve hours had a minute in which to ask himself who he was, and what he was  about. Adventure had followed so fast upon adventure that he was in a more or  less dazed condition, and felt as little capable of connecting event with event  as if he had been asked to recall the changing pictures of a kaleidoscope. That  affair of the packet, now, was it or was it not serious, and would he ever know  what it meant or how it turned out?</p>
  <p>Like  a child who had been given a pebble, and told to throw it over the wall, he had  thrown and run, giving a shout of warning, it is true, but not knowing, nor  ever likely to know, where the stone had fallen, or what it was meant to do.  Then this new commission on which he was bent&mdash;was it in any way connected with  the other, or merely the odd result of his being in the right place at the  right moment? He was inclined to think the latter. And yet how odd it was that  one doubtful errand should be followed by another, in a town no larger than New  Bedford, forcing him from scene to scene, till he found himself speeding toward  the city he least desired to enter, and from which he had the most to fear!</p>
  <p>But  brooding over a case like this brings small comfort. He felt that he had been  juggled with, but he neither knew by whose hand nor in what cause. If the hand  was that of Providence, why he had only to go on following the beck of the  moment, while if it was that of Fate, the very uselessness of struggling with  it was apparent at once. Poor reasoning, perhaps, but no other offered, and  satisfied that whatever came his intentions were above question, he settled  himself at last for a nap, of which he certainly stood in good need. When he  awoke he was in Boston.</p>
  <p>The  first thing he did was to show his list of addresses and inquire into what  quarter they would lead him. To his surprise he found it to be the fashionable  quarter. Two of them were names of well-known club-houses, a third that of a  first-class restaurant, and the fourth that of a private house on Commonwealth  Avenue. Heigho! and he was dressed like a tramp, or nearly so!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queer  messenger, I, for such kind of work,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;I wonder why he lighted on  such a rough-looking customer. He must have had his reasons. I wonder if he  wished the errand to fail. He bore himself very nonchalantly at the depot. When  I last saw him his face and attitude were those of a totally unconcerned man.  Have I been sent on a fool&rsquo;s chase after all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  absurdity of this conclusion struck him, however, as he reasoned: &ldquo;Why, then,  should he have paid my fare? Not as a benefit to me, of course, but for his own  ends, whatever they might be. Let us see, then, what those ends are. So now for  the gentleman of the red hair who plays cards with one arm in a sling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  thought that he might get entrance into the club-houses easily enough. He  possessed a certain amount of insinuation when necessity required, and, if  hard-featured, had a good expression which in unprejudiced minds defied  criticism. Of porters and doorkeepers he was not afraid, and these were the men  he must first encounter.</p>
  <p>At  the first club-house he succeeded easily enough in getting word with the man  waiting in the large hall, and before many minutes learned that the object of  his search was not to be found there that evening. He also learned his name,  which was a great step towards the success of his embassy. It was Wattles,  Captain Wattles, a marked man evidently, even in this exclusive and aristocratic  club.</p>
  <p>Armed  with this new knowledge, he made his way to the second building of the kind and  boldly demanded speech with Captain Wattles. But Captain Wattles had not yet  arrived and he went out again this time to look him up at the restaurant.</p>
  <p>He  was not there. As Sweetwater was going out two gentlemen came in, one of whom  said to the other in passing:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sick,  do you say? I thought Wattles was made of iron.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  he was,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;before that accident to his arm. Now the least  thing upsets him. He&rsquo;s down at Haberstow&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  was all; the door was swung to between them. Sweetwater had received his clew,  but what a clew! Haberstow&rsquo;s? Where was that?</p>
  <p>Thinking  the bold course the best one, he re-entered the restaurant and approached the  gentlemen he had just seen enter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard you speak the name of Captain Wattles,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am hunting for  Captain Wattles. Can you tell me where he is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  soon saw that he had struck the wrong men for information. They not only  refused to answer him, but treated him with open disdain. Unwilling to lose  time, he left them, and having no other resource, hastened to the last place  mentioned on his list.</p>
  <p>It  was now late, too late to enter a private house under ordinary circumstances,  but this house was lighted up, and a carriage stood in front of it; so he had  the courage to run up the steps and consult the large door-plate visible from  the sidewalk. It read thus:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700521h-images/page261.png" width="459" height="265"></p>
  <p>Fortune  had favoured him better than he expected.</p>
  <p>He  hesitated a moment, then decided to ring the bell. But before he had done so,  the door opened and an old gentleman appeared seeing a younger man out. The  latter had his arm in a sling, and bore himself with a fierceness that made his  appearance somewhat alarming; the other seemed to be in an irate state of mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  apologies!&rdquo; the former was saying. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the night air; I&rsquo;m not so ill  as that. When I&rsquo;m myself again we&rsquo;ll have a little more talk. My compliments to  your daughter, sir. I wish you a very good evening, or rather night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old gentleman bowed, and as he did so Sweetwater caught a glimpse (it was the  shortest glimpse in the world) of a sweet face beaming from a doorway far down  the hall. There was pain in it and a yearning anxiety that made it very  beautiful; then it vanished, and the old gentleman, uttering some few sarcastic  words, closed the door, and Sweetwater found himself alone and in darkness.</p>
  <p>The  kaleidoscope had been given another turn.</p>
  <p>Dashing  down the stoop, he came upon the gentleman who had preceded him, just as he was  seating himself in the carriage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me,&rdquo; he gasped, as the driver caught up the reins; &ldquo;you have forgotten  something.&rdquo; Then, as Captain Wattles looked hastily out, &ldquo;You have forgotten  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  oath that rang out from under that twitching red moustache was something to  startle even him. But he clung to the carriage window and presently managed to  say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  messenger, sir, from New Bedford. I have been on the hunt for you for two  hours. It won&rsquo;t keep, sir, for more than a half-hour longer. Where shall I find  you during that time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Captain  Wattles, on whom the name New Bedford seemed to have made some impression,  pointed up at the coachman&rsquo;s box with a growl, in which command mingled  strangely with menace. Then he threw himself back. Evidently the captain was  not in very good humour.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  taking this as an order to seat himself beside the driver, did so, and the  carriage drove off. It went at a rapid pace, and before he had time to propound  more than a question or two to the coachman, it stopped before a large  apartment-house in a brilliantly lighted street.</p>
  <p>Captain  Wattles got out, and Sweetwater followed him. The former, who seemed to have  forgotten Sweetwater, walked past him and entered the building with a stride  and swing that made the plain, lean, insignificant-looking messenger behind him  feel smaller than ever. Indeed, he had never felt so small, for not only was  the captain a man of superb proportions and conspicuous bearing, but he  possessed, in spite of his fiery hair and fierce moustache, that <i>beaut&eacute; de  diable</i> which is at once threatening and imposing. Added to this, he was  angry and so absorbed in his own thoughts that he would be very apt to visit  punishment of no light character upon anyone who interfered with him. A  pleasing prospect for Sweetwater, who, however, kept on with the dogged  determination of his character up the first flight of stairs and then up  another till they stopped, Captain Wattles first and afterwards his humble  follower, before a small door into which the captain endeavoured to fit a key.  The oaths which followed his failure to do this were not very encouraging to  the man behind, nor was the kick which he gave the door after the second more  successful attempt calculated to act in a very reassuring way upon anyone whose  future pay for a doubtful task rested upon this man&rsquo;s good nature.</p>
  <p>The  darkness which met them both on the threshold of this now open room was  speedily relieved by a burst of electric light, that flooded the whole  apartment and brought out the captain&rsquo;s swaggering form and threatening  features with startling distinctness. He had thrown off his hat and was  relieving himself of a cloak in a furious way that caused Sweetwater to shrink  back, and, as the French say, efface himself as much as possible behind a  clothes-tree standing near the door. That the captain had entirely forgotten  him was evident, and for the present moment that gentleman was too angry to  care or even notice if a dozen men stood at the door. As he was talking all  this time, or rather jerking out sharp sentences, as men do when in a towering  rage, Sweetwater was glad to be left unnoticed, for much can be gathered from  scattered sentences, especially when a man is in too reckless a frame of mind  to weigh them. He, therefore, made but little movement and listened; and these  are some of the ejaculations and scraps of talk he heard:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  old purse-proud fool! Honoured by my friendship, but not ready to accept me as  his daughter&rsquo;s suitor! As if I would lounge away hours that mean dollars to me  in his stiff old drawing-room, just to hear his everlasting drone about stocks  up and stocks down, and politics gone all wrong. He has heard that I play  cards, and&mdash;How pretty she looked! I believe I half like that girl, and when I  think she has a million in her own right&mdash;Damn it, if I cannot win her openly  and with papa&rsquo;s consent, I will carry her off with only her own. She&rsquo;s worth  the effort, doubly worth it, and when I have her and her money&mdash;Eh! Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had seen Sweetwater at last, which was not strange, seeing that he had turned  his way, and was within two feet of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you doing here, and who let you in? Get out, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  message, Captain Wattles! A message from New Bedford. You have forgotten, sir;  you bade me follow you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was curious to see the menace slowly die out of the face of this flushed and  angry man as he met Sweetwater&rsquo;s calm eye and unabashed front, and noticed, as  he had not done at first, the slip of paper which the latter resolutely held  out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;New  Bedford; ah, from Campbell, I take it. Let me see!&rdquo; And the hand which had  shook with rage now trembled with a very different sort of emotion as he took  the slip, cast his eyes over it, and then looked back at Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>Now,  Sweetwater knew the two words written on that paper. He could see out of the  back of his head at times, and he had been able to make out these words when  the man in New Bedford was writing them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Happenings;  Afghanistan,&rdquo; with the figures 2000 after the latter.</p>
  <p>Not  much sense in them singly or in conjunction, but the captain, muttering them  over to himself, consulted a little book which he took from his breast pocket  and found, or seemed to, a clew to their meaning. It could only have been a  partial one, however, for in another instant he turned on Sweetwater with a  sour look and a thundering oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this all?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Does he call this a complete message?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is another word,&rdquo; returned Sweetwater, &ldquo;which he bade me give you by word of  mouth; but that word don&rsquo;t go for nothing. It&rsquo;s worth just twenty-five dollars.  I&rsquo;ve earned it, sir. I came up from New Bedford on purpose to deliver it to  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  expected a blow, but he only got a stare.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five  dollars,&rdquo; muttered the captain. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s fortunate that I have them. And who  are you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Not one of Campbell&rsquo;s pick-ups, surely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a confidential messenger,&rdquo; smiled Sweetwater, amused against his will at  finding a name for himself. &ldquo;I carry messages and execute commissions that  require more or less discretion in the handling. I am paid well. Twenty-five  dollars is the price of this job.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you have had the honour of informing me before,&rdquo; blustered the other with an  attempt to hide some serious emotion. &ldquo;Why, man, what do you fear? Don&rsquo;t you  see I&rsquo;m hurt? You could knock me over with a feather if you touched my game  arm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five  dollars,&rdquo; repeated Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>The  captain grew angrier. &ldquo;Dash it! aren&rsquo;t you going to have them? 
    What&rsquo;s the word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Sweetwater wasn&rsquo;t going to be caught by chaff.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;C.  O. D.,&rdquo; he insisted firmly, standing his ground, though certain that the blow  would now fall. But no, the captain laughed, and tugging away with his one free  hand at his pocket, he brought out a pocket-book, from which he managed deftly  enough to draw out three bills. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, laying them on the table, but  keeping one long vigorous finger on them. &ldquo;Now, the word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  laid his own hand on the bills.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frederick,&rdquo;  said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said the other thoughtfully, lifting his finger and proceeding to stride up and  down the room. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a stiff one. What he says, he will do. Two thousand  dollars! and soon, too, I warrant. Well, I&rsquo;m in a devil of a fix at last.&rdquo; He  had again forgotten the presence of Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  he turned or rather stopped. His eye was on the messenger, but he did not even  see him. &ldquo;One Frederick must offset the other,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only  loophole out,&rdquo; and he threw himself into a chair from which he immediately  sprang up again with a yell. He had hurt his wounded arm.</p>
  <p>Pandemonium  reigned in that small room for a minute, then his eye fell again on Sweetwater,  who, under the fascination of the spectacle offered him, had only just  succeeded in finding the knob of the door. This time there was recognition in  his look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;  he cried. &ldquo;I may have use for you too. Confidential messengers are hard to come  by, and one that Campbell would employ must be all right. Sit down there! I&rsquo;ll  talk to you when I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  was not slow in obeying this command. Business was booming with him. Besides, the  name of Frederick acted like a charm upon him. There seemed to be so many  Fredericks in the world, and one of them lay in such a curious way near his  heart.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the captain reseated himself, but more carefully. He had a plan or method of  procedure to think out, or so it seemed, for he sat a long time in rigid  immobility, with only the scowl of perplexity or ill-temper on his brow to show  the nature of his thoughts. Then he drew a sheet of paper toward him, and began  to write a letter. He was so absorbed over this letter and the manipulation of  it, having but one hand to work with, that Sweetwater determined upon a  hazardous stroke. The little book which the captain had consulted, and which  had undoubtedly furnished him with a key to those two incongruous words, lay on  the floor not far from him, having been flung from its owner&rsquo;s hand during the  moments of passion and suffering I have above mentioned. To reach this book  with his foot, to draw it toward him, and, finally, to get hold of it with his  hand, was not difficult for one who aspired to be a detective, and had already  done some good work in that direction. But it was harder to turn the leaves and  find the words he sought without attracting the attention of his fierce  companion. He, however, succeeded in doing this at last, the long list of words  he found on every page being arranged alphabetically. It was a private code for  telegraphic or cable messages, and he soon found that &ldquo;Happenings&rdquo; meant: &ldquo;Our  little game discovered; play straight until I give you the wink.&rdquo; And that &ldquo;Afghanistan&rdquo;  stood for: &ldquo;Hush money.&rdquo; As the latter was followed by the figures I have  mentioned, the purport of the message needed no explanation, but the word &ldquo;Frederick&rdquo;  did. So he searched for that, only to find that it was not in the book. There  was but one conclusion to draw. This name was perfectly well known between  them, and was that of the person, no doubt, who laid claim to the two thousand  dollars.</p>
  <p>Satisfied  at holding this clew to the riddle, he dropped the book again at his side and  skilfully kicked it far out into the room. Captain Wattles had seen nothing. He  was a man who took in only one thing at a time.</p>
  <p>The  penning of that letter went on laboriously. It took so long that Sweetwater  dozed, or pretended to, and when it was at last done, the clock on the  mantelpiece had struck two.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Halloo  there, now!&rdquo; suddenly shouted the captain, turning on the messenger. &ldquo;Are you  ready for another journey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends,&rdquo; smiled Sweetwater, rising sleepily and advancing. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t got over  the last one yet, and would rather sleep than start out again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you want pay? Well, you&rsquo;ll get that fast enough if you succeed in your mission.  This letter&rdquo; he shook it with an impatient hand&mdash;&ldquo;should be worth two thousand  five hundred dollars to me. If you bring me back that money or its equivalent  within twenty-four hours, I will give you a clean hundred of it. Good enough  pay, I take it, for five hours&rsquo; journey. Better than sleep, eh? Besides, you  can doze on the cars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  agreed with him in all these assertions. Putting on his cap, he reached for the  letter. He didn&rsquo;t like being made an instrument for blackmail, but he was  curious to see to whom he was about to be sent. But the captain had grown  suddenly wary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is not a letter to be dropped in the mailbox,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You brought me a line  here whose prompt delivery has prevented me from making a fool of myself  to-night. You must do as much with this one. It is to be carried to its  destination by yourself, given to the person whose name you will find written  on it, and the answer brought back before you sleep, mind you, unless you  snatch a wink or so on the cars. That it is night need not disturb you. It will  be daylight before you arrive at the place to which this is addressed, and if  you cannot get into the house at so early an hour, whistle three times like  this&mdash;listen and one of the windows will presently fly up. You have had no  trouble finding me; you&rsquo;ll have no trouble finding him. When you return, hunt  me up as you did to-night. Only you need not trouble yourself to look for me at  Haberstow&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he added under his breath in a tone that was no doubt highly  satisfactory to himself. &ldquo;I shall not be there. And now, off with you!&rdquo; he  shouted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve your hundred dollars to make before daylight, and it&rsquo;s already  after two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  who had stolen a glimpse at the superscription on the letter he held, stumbled  as he went out of the door. It was directed, as he had expected, to a  Frederick, probably to the second one of whom Captain Wattles had spoken, but  not, as he had expected, to a stranger. The name on the letter was Frederick  Sutherland, and the place of his destination was Sutherlandtown.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
  &ldquo;Who Are You?&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>The  round had come full circle. By various chances and a train of circumstances for  which he could not account, he had been turned from his first intention and was  being brought back stage by stage to the very spot he had thought it his duty  to fly from. Was this fate? He began to think so, and no longer so much as  dreamed of struggling against it. But he felt very much dazed, and walked away  through the now partially deserted streets with an odd sense of failure that  was only compensated by the hope he now cherished of seeing his mother again,  and being once more Caleb Sweetwater of Sutherlandtown.</p>
  <p>He  was clearer, however, after a few blocks of rapid walking, and then he began to  wonder over the contents of the letter he held, and how they would affect its  recipient. Was it a new danger he was bringing him? Instead of aiding Mr.  Sutherland in keeping his dangerous secret, was he destined to bring disgrace  upon him, not only by his testimony before the coroner, but by means of this  letter, which, whatever it contained, certainly could not bode good to the man  from whom it was designed to wrest two thousand five hundred dollars?</p>
  <p>The  fear that he was destined to do so grew upon him rapidly, and the temptation to  open the letter and make himself master of its contents before leaving town at  last became so strong that his sense of honour paled before it, and he made up  his mind that before he ventured into the precincts of Sutherlandtown he would  know just what sort of a bombshell he was carrying into the Sutherland family.  To do this he stopped at the first respectable lodging-house he encountered and  hired a room. Calling for hot water &ldquo;piping hot,&rdquo; he told them&mdash;he subjected the  letter to the effects of steam and presently had it open. He was not  disappointed in its contents, save that they were even more dangerous than he  had anticipated. Captain Wattles was an old crony of Frederick&rsquo;s and knew his  record better than anyone else in the world. From this fact and the added one  that Frederick had stood in special need of money at the time of Agatha Webb&rsquo;s  murder, the writer had no hesitation in believing him guilty of the crime which  opened his way to a fortune, and though under ordinary circumstances he would,  as his friend Frederick already knew, be perfectly willing to keep his opinions  to himself, he was just now under the same necessity for money that Frederick  had been at that fatal time, and must therefore see the colour of two thousand  five hundred dollars before the day was out if Frederick desired to have his  name kept out of the Boston papers. That it had been kept out up to this time  argued that the crime had been well enough hidden to make the alternative thus  offered an important one.</p>
  <p>There  was no signature.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  affected to an extent he little expected, resealed the letter, made his excuses  to the landlord, and left the house. Now he could see why he had not been  allowed to make his useless sacrifice. Another man than himself suspected  Frederick, and by a word could precipitate the doom he already saw hung too low  above the devoted head of Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s son to be averted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  I&rsquo;ll attempt that too,&rdquo; burst impetuously from his lips. &ldquo;If I fail, I can but  go back with a knowledge of this added danger. If I succeed, why I must still  go back. From some persons and from some complications it is useless to attempt  flight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Returning  to the club-house he had first entered in his search for Captain Wattles, he  asked if that gentleman had yet come in. This time he was answered by an  affirmative, though he might almost as well have not been, for the captain was playing  cards in a private room and would not submit to any interruption.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will submit to mine,&rdquo; retorted Sweetwater to the man who had told him this. &ldquo;Or  wait; hand him back this letter and say that the messenger refuses to deliver  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  brought the captain out, as he had fully expected it would.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  what&mdash;&rdquo; began that gentleman in a furious rage.</p>
  <p>But  Sweetwater, laying his hand on the arm he knew to be so sensitive, rose on  tiptoe and managed to whisper in the angry man&rsquo;s ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a card-sharp, and it will be easy enough to ruin you. Threaten Frederick  Sutherland and in two weeks you will be boycotted by every club in this city.  Twenty-five hundred dollars won&rsquo;t pay you for that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  from a nondescript fellow with no grains of a gentleman about him in form,  feature, or apparel! The captain stared nonplussed, too much taken aback to be  even angry.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  he cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know all this? How do you know what is or is not in the letter I gave  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  with a shrug that in its quiet significance seemed to make him at once the  equal of his interrogator, quietly pressed the quivering limb under his hand  and calmly replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know because I have read it. Before putting my head in the lion&rsquo;s mouth, I make  it a point to count his teeth,&rdquo; and lifting his hand, he drew back, leaving the  captain reeling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is your name? Who are you?&rdquo; shouted out Wattles as Sweetwater was drawing off.</p>
  <p>It  was the third time he had been asked that question within twenty-four hours,  but not before with this telling emphasis. &ldquo;Who are you, I say, and what can  you do to me&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am&mdash;But that is an insignificant detail unworthy of your curiosity. 
    As to what I can do, wait and see. But first burn that letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  turning his back he fled out of the building, followed by oaths which, if not  loud, were certainly deep and very far-reaching.</p>
  <p>It  was the first time Captain Wattles had met his match in audacity.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
    Home Again</b></h2>
  <p>On  his way to the depot, Sweetwater went into the <i>Herald</i> office and bought a morning paper. At the station he opened  it. There was one column devoted to the wreck of the <i>Hesper</i>, and a whole half-page to the proceedings of the third day&rsquo;s  inquiry into the cause and manner of Agatha Webb&rsquo;s death. Merely noting that  his name was mentioned among the lost, in the first article, he began to read  the latter with justifiable eagerness. The assurance given in Captain Wattles&rsquo;s  letter was true. No direct suspicion had as yet fallen on Frederick. As the  lover of Amabel Page, his name was necessarily mentioned, but neither in the  account of the inquest nor in the editorials on the subject could he find any  proof that either the public or police had got hold of the great idea that he  was the man who had preceded Amabel to Agatha&rsquo;s cottage. Relieved on this  score, Sweetwater entered more fully into the particulars, and found that  though the jury had sat three days, very little more had come to light than was  known on the morning he made that bold dash into the <i>Hesper</i>. Most of the witnesses had given in their testimony, Amabel&rsquo;s  being the chief, and though no open accusation had been made, it was evident  from the trend of the questions put to the latter that Amabel&rsquo;s connection with  the affair was looked upon as criminal and as placing her in a very suspicious  light. Her replies, however, as once before, under a similar but less formal  examination, failed to convey any recognition on her part either of this  suspicion or of her own position; yet they were not exactly frank, and  Sweetwater saw, or thought he saw (naturally failing to have a key to the  situation), that she was still working upon her old plan of saving both herself  and Frederick, by throwing whatever suspicion her words might raise upon the  deceased Zabel. He did not know, and perhaps it was just as well that he did  not at this especial juncture, that she was only biding her time&mdash;now very  nearly at hand&mdash;and that instead of loving Frederick, she hated him, and was  determined upon his destruction. Reading, as a final clause, that Mr.  Sutherland was expected to testify soon in explanation of his position as  executor of Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s will, Sweetwater grew very serious, and, while no  change took place in his mind as to his present duty, he decided that his  return must be as unobtrusive as possible, and his only too timely reappearance  on the scene of the inquiry kept secret till Mr. Sutherland had given his  evidence and retired from under the eyes of his excited fellow-citizens.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  sight of me might unnerve him,&rdquo; was Sweetwater&rsquo;s thought, &ldquo;precipitating the  very catastrophe we dread. One look, one word on his part indicative of his  inner apprehensions that his son had a hand in the crime which has so benefited  him, and nothing can save Frederick from the charge of murder. Not Knapp&rsquo;s  skill, my silence, or Amabel&rsquo;s finesse. The young man will be lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not know, as we do, that Amabel&rsquo;s finesse was devoted to winning a husband  for herself, and that, in the event of failure, the action she threatened  against her quondam lover would be precipitated that very day at the moment  when the clock struck twelve.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  arrived home by the way of Portchester. He had seen one or two persons he knew,  but, so far, had himself escaped recognition. The morning light was dimly  breaking when he strode into the outskirts of Sutherlandtown and began to  descend the hill. As he passed Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s house he looked up, and was  astonished to see a light burning in one deeply embowered window. Alas! he did  not know how early one anxious heart woke during those troublous days. The  Sutherland house was dark, but as he crept very close under its overhanging  eaves he heard a deep sigh uttered over his head, and knew that someone was up  here also in anxious expectation of a day that was destined to hold more than  even he anticipated.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  the sea grew rosy, and the mother&rsquo;s cottage was as yet far off. Hurrying on, he  came at last under the eye of more than one of the early risers of  Sutherlandtown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  Sweetwater! Alive and well!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey,  Sweetwater, we thought you were lost on the <i>Hesper</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Halloo!  Home in time to see the pretty Amabel arrested?&rdquo; Phrases like these met him at  more than one corner; but he eluded them all, stopping only to put one  hesitating question. Was his mother well?</p>
  <p>Home  fears had made themselves felt with his near approach to that humble cottage  door.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
    What Followed The Striking Of The Clock</b></h2>
  <p>It  was the last day of the inquest, and to many it bade fair to be the least  interesting. All the witnesses who had anything to say had long ago given in  their testimony, and when at or near noon Sweetwater slid into the  inconspicuous seat he had succeeded in obtaining near the coroner, it was to  find in two faces only any signs of the eagerness and expectancy which filled  his own breast to suffocation. But as these faces were those of Agnes Halliday  and Amabel Page, he soon recognised that his own judgment was not at fault, and  that notwithstanding outward appearances and the languid interest shown in the  now lagging proceedings, the moment presaged an event full of unseen but vital  consequence.</p>
  <p>Frederick  was not visible in the great hall; but that he was near at hand soon became  evident from the change Sweetwater now saw in Amabel. For while she had  hitherto sat under the universal gaze with only the faint smile of conscious  beauty on her inscrutable features, she roused as the hands of the clock moved  toward noon, and glanced at the great door of entrance with an evil expectancy  that startled even Sweetwater, so little had he really understood the nature of  the passions labouring in that venomous breast.</p>
  <p>Next  moment the door opened, and Frederick and his father came in. The air of  triumphant satisfaction with which Amabel sank back into her seat was as marked  in its character as her previous suspense. What did it mean? Sweetwater, noting  it, and the vivid contrast it offered to Frederick&rsquo;s air of depression, felt  that his return had been well timed.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland was looking very feeble. As he took the chair offered him, the  change in his appearance was apparent to all who knew him, and there were few  there who did not know him. And, startled by these evidences of suffering which  they could not understand and feared to interpret even to themselves, more than  one devoted friend stole uneasy glances at Frederick to see if he too were  under the cloud which seemed to envelop his father almost beyond recognition.</p>
  <p>But  Frederick was looking at Amabel, and his erect head and determined aspect made  him a conspicuous figure in the room. She who had called up this expression,  and alone comprehended it fully, smiled as she met his eye, with that curious  slow dipping of her dimples which had more than once confounded the coroner,  and rendered her at once the admiration and abhorrence of the crowd who for so  long a time had had the opportunity of watching her.</p>
  <p>Frederick,  to whom this smile conveyed a last hope as well as a last threat, looked away  as soon as possible, but not before her eyes had fallen in their old inquiring  way to his hands, from which he had removed the ring which up to this hour he  had invariably worn on his third finger. In this glance of hers and this action  of his began the struggle that was to make that day memorable in many hearts.</p>
  <p>After  the first stir occasioned by the entrance of two such important persons the  crowd settled back into its old quietude under the coroner&rsquo;s hand. A tedious  witness was having his slow say, and to him a full attention was being given in  the hope that some real enlightenment would come at last to settle the questions  which had been raised by Amabel&rsquo;s incomplete and unsatisfactory testimony. But  no man can furnish what he does not possess, and the few final minutes before  noon passed by without any addition being made to the facts which had already  been presented for general consideration.</p>
  <p>As  the witness sat down the clock began to strike. As the slow, hesitating strokes  rang out, Sweetwater saw Frederick yield to a sudden but most profound emotion.  The old fear, which we understand, if Sweetwater did not, had again seized the  victim of Amabel&rsquo;s ambition, and under her eye, which was blazing full upon him  now with a fell and steady purpose, he found his right hand stealing toward the  left in the significant action she expected. Better to yield than fall headlong  into the pit one word of hers would open. He had not meant to yield, but now  that the moment had come, now that he must at once and forever choose between a  course that led simply to personal unhappiness and one that involved not only  himself, but those dearest to him, in disgrace and sorrow, he felt himself  weaken to the point of clutching at whatever would save him from the  consequences of confession. Moral strength and that tenacity of purpose which  only comes from years of self-control were too lately awakened in his breast to  sustain him now. As stroke after stroke fell on the ear, he felt himself  yielding beyond recovery, and had almost touched his finger in the significant  action of assent which Amabel awaited with breathless expectation, when&mdash;was it  miracle or only the suggestion of his better nature?&mdash;the memory of a face full  of holy pleading rose from the past before his eyes and with an inner cry of &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;  he flung his hand out and clutched his father&rsquo;s arm in a way to break the charm  of his own dread and end forever the effects of the intolerable fascination  that was working upon him. Next minute the last stroke of noon rang out, and  the hour was up which Amabel had set as the limit of her silence.</p>
  <p>A  pause, which to their two hearts if to no others seemed strangely appropriate,  followed the cessation of these sounds, then the witness was dismissed, and  Amabel, taking advantage of the movement, was about to lean toward Mr.  Courtney, when Frederick, leaping with a bound to his feet, drew all eyes towards  himself with the cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me be put on my oath. I have testimony to give of the utmost importance in this  case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner was astounded; everyone was astounded. No one had expected anything  from him, and instinctively every eye turned towards Amabel to see how she was  affected by his action.</p>
  <p>Strangely,  evidently, for the look with which she settled back in her seat was one which  no one who saw it ever forgot, though it conveyed no hint of her real feelings,  which were somewhat chaotic.</p>
  <p>Frederick,  who had forgotten her now that he had made up his mind to speak, waited for the  coroner&rsquo;s reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you have testimony,&rdquo; said that gentleman after exchanging a few hurried words  with Mr. Courtney and the surprised Knapp, &ldquo;you can do no better than give it  to us at once. Mr. Frederick Sutherland, will you take the stand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a noble air from which all hesitation had vanished, Frederick started towards  the place indicated, but stopped before he had taken a half-dozen steps and  glanced back at his father, who was visibly succumbing under this last shock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;  he whispered, but in so thrilling a tone it was heard to the remotest corner of  the room. &ldquo;Spare me the anguish of saying what I have to say in your presence.  I could not bear it. You could not bear it. Later, if you will wait for me in  one of these rooms, I will repeat my tale in your ears, but go now. It is my  last entreaty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a silence; no one ventured a dissent, no one so much as made a gesture of  disapproval. Then Mr. Sutherland struggled to his feet, cast one last look  around him, and disappeared through a door which had opened like magic before  him. Then and not till then did Frederick move forward.</p>
  <p>The  moment was intense. The coroner seemed to share the universal excitement, for  his first question was a leading one and brought out this startling admission:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have obtruded myself into this inquiry and now ask to be heard by this jury,  because no man knows more than I do of the manner and cause of Agatha Webb&rsquo;s  death. This you will believe when I tell you that <i>I</i> was the person Miss  Page followed into Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s house and whom she heard descend the stairs  during the moment she crouched behind the figure of the sleeping Philemon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was more, infinitely more, than anyone there had expected. It was not only an  acknowledgment but a confession, and the shock, the surprise, the alarm, which  it occasioned even to those who had never had much confidence in this young man&rsquo;s  virtue, was almost appalling in its intensity. Had it not been for the consciousness  of Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s near presence the feeling would have risen to outbreak; and  many voices were held in subjection by the remembrance of this venerated man&rsquo;s  last look, that otherwise would have made themselves heard in despite of the  restrictions of the place and the authority of the police.</p>
  <p>To  Frederick it was a moment of immeasurable grief and humiliation. On every face,  in every shrinking form, in subdued murmurs and open cries, he read instant and  complete condemnation, and yet in all his life from boyhood up to this hour,  never had he been so worthy of their esteem and consideration. But though he  felt the iron enter his soul, he did not lose his determined attitude. He had  observed a change in Amabel and a change in Agnes, and if only to disappoint  the vile triumph of the one and raise again the drooping courage of the other,  he withstood the clamour and began speaking again, before the coroner had been  able to fully restore quiet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what this acknowledgment must convey to the minds of the jury  and people here assembled. But if anyone who listens to me thinks me guilty of  the death I was so unfortunate as to have witnessed, he will be doing me a  wrong which Agatha Webb would be the first to condemn. Dr. Talbot, and you,  gentlemen of the jury, in the face of God and man, I here declare that Mrs.  Webb, in my presence and before my eyes, gave to herself the blow which has  robbed us all of a most valuable life. She was not murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a solemn assertion, but it failed to convince the crowd before him. As by  one impulse men and women broke into a tumult. Mr. Sutherland was forgotten and  cries of &ldquo;Never! She was too good! It&rsquo;s all calumny! A wretched lie!&rdquo; broke in  unrestrained excitement from every part of the large room. In vain the coroner  smote with his gavel, in vain the local police endeavoured to restore order;  the tide was up and over-swept everything for an instant till silence was  suddenly restored by the sight of Amabel smoothing out the folds of her crisp  white frock with an incredulous, almost insulting, smile that at once fixed  attention again on Frederick. He seized the occasion and spoke up in a tone of  great resolve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have made an assertion,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;before God and before this jury. To make it  seem a credible one I shall have to tell my own story from the beginning. Am I  allowed to do so, Mr. Coroner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are,&rdquo; was the firm response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  gentlemen,&rdquo; continued Frederick, still without looking at Amabel, whose smile  had acquired a mockery that drew the eyes of the jury toward her more than once  during the following recital, &ldquo;you know, and the public generally now know,  that Mrs. Webb has left me the greater portion of the money of which she died  possessed. I have never before acknowledged to anyone, not even to the good man  who awaits this jury&rsquo;s verdict on the other side of that door yonder, that she  had reasons for this, good reasons, reasons of which up to the very evening of  her death I was myself ignorant, as I was ignorant of her intentions in my  regard, or that I was the special object of her attention, or that we were  under any mutual obligations in any way. Why, then, I should have thought of  going to her in the great strait in which I found myself on that day, I cannot  say. I knew she had money in her house; this I had unhappily been made  acquainted with in an accidental way, and I knew she was of kindly disposition  and quite capable of doing a very unselfish act. Still, this would not seem to  be reason enough for me to intrude upon her late at night with a plea for a  large loan of money, had I not been in a desperate condition of mind, which  made any attempt seem reasonable that promised relief from the unendurable  burden of a pressing and disreputable debt. I was obliged to have money, a  great deal of money, and I had to have it at once; and while I know that this  will not serve to lighten the suspicion I have brought upon myself by my late  admissions, it is the only explanation I can give you for leaving the ball at  my father&rsquo;s house and hurrying down secretly and alone into town to the little  cottage where, as I had been told early in the evening, a small entertainment  was being given, which would insure its being open even at so late an hour as  midnight. Miss Page, who will, I am sure, pardon the introduction of her name  into this narrative, has taken pains to declare to you that in the expedition  she herself made into town that evening, she followed some person&rsquo;s steps  down-hill. This is very likely true, and those steps were probably mine, for  after leaving the house by the garden door, I came directly down the main road  to the corner of the lane running past Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s cottage. Having already seen  from the hillside the light burning in her upper windows, I felt encouraged to  proceed, and so hastened on till I came to the gate on High Street. Here I had  a moment of hesitation, and thoughts bitter enough for me to recall them at  this moment came into my mind, making that instant, perhaps, the very worst in  my life; but they passed, thank God, and with no more desperate feeling than a  sullen intention of having my own way about this money, I lifted the latch of  the front door and stepped in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had expected to find a jovial group of friends in her little ground parlour, or  at least to hear the sound of merry voices and laughter in the rooms above; but  no sounds of any sort awaited me; indeed the house seemed strangely silent for  one so fully lighted, and, astonished at this, I pushed the door ajar at my  left and looked in. An unexpected and pitiful sight awaited me. Seated at a  table set with abundance of untasted food, I saw the master of the house with  his head sunk forward on his arms, asleep. The expected guests had failed to  arrive, and he, tired out with waiting, had fallen into a doze at the board.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  was a condition of things for which I was not prepared. Mrs. Webb, whom I  wished to see, was probably up-stairs, and while I might summon her by a sturdy  rap on the door beside which I stood, I had so little desire to wake her  husband, of whose mental condition I was well aware, that I could not bring  myself to make any loud noise within his hearing. Yet I had not the courage to  retreat. All my hope of relief from the many difficulties that menaced me lay  in the generosity of this great-hearted woman, and if out of pusillanimity I  let this hour go by without making my appeal, nothing but shame and disaster  awaited me. Yet how could I hope to lure her down-stairs without noise? I could  not, and so, yielding to the impulse of the moment, without any realisation, I  here swear, of the effect which my unexpected presence would have on the noble  woman overhead, I slipped up the narrow staircase, and catching at that moment  the sound of her voice calling out to Batsy, I stepped up to the door I saw  standing open before me and confronted her before she could move from the table  before which she was sitting, counting over a large roll of money.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  look (and it was doubtless not a common look, for the sight of a mass of money  at that moment, when money was everything to me, roused every lurking demon in  my breast) seemed to appall, if it did not frighten her, for she rose, and  meeting my eye with a gaze in which shock and some strange and poignant agony  totally incomprehensible to me were strangely blended, she cried out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,  no, Frederick! You don&rsquo;t know what you are doing. If you want my money, take  it; if you want my life, I will give it to you with my own hand. Don&rsquo;t stain  yours&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not understand her. I did not know until I thought it over afterward that  my hand was thrust convulsively into my breast in a way which, taken with my  wild mien, made me look as if I had come to murder her for the money over which  she was hovering. I was blind, deaf to everything but that money, and bending  madly forward in a state of mental intoxication awful enough for me to remember  now, I answered her frenzied words by some such broken exclamations as these:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Give,  then! I want hundreds&mdash;thousands&mdash;now, now, to save myself! Disgrace, shame,  prison await me if I don&rsquo;t have them. Give, give!&rsquo; And my hand went out toward  it, not toward her; but she mistook the action, mistook my purpose, and, with a  heart-broken cry, to save me, <i>me</i>, from crime, the worst crime of which humanity  is capable, she caught up a dagger lying only too near her hand in the open  drawer against which she leaned, and in a moment of fathomless anguish which we  who can never know more than the outward seeming of her life can hardly  measure, plunged against it and&mdash;I can tell you no more. Her blood and Batsy&rsquo;s  shriek from the adjoining room swam through my consciousness, and then she  fell, as I supposed, dead upon the floor, and I, in scarcely better case, fell  also.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,  as God lives, is the truth concerning the wound found in the breast of this  never-to-be-forgotten woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  feeling, the pathos, the anguish even, to be found in his tone made this story,  strange and incredible as it seemed, appear for the moment plausible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Batsy?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  have fallen when we did, for I never heard her voice after the first scream.  But I shall speak of her again. What I must now explain is how the money in  Mrs. Webb&rsquo;s drawer came into my possession, and how the dagger she had planted  in her breast came to be found on the lawn outside. When I came to myself, and  that must have been very soon, I found that the blow of which I had been such a  horrified witness had not yet proved fatal. The eyes I had seen close, as I had  supposed, forever, were now open, and she was looking at me with a smile that  has never left my memory, and never will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There  is no blood on you,&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;You did not strike the blow. Was it money  only that you wanted, Frederick? If so, you could have had it without crime.  There are five hundred dollars on that table. Take them and let them pave your  way to a better life. My death will help you to remember.&rsquo; Do these words, this  action of hers, seem incredible to you, sirs? Alas! alas! they will not when I  tell you&rdquo;&mdash;and here he cast one anxious, deeply anxious, glance at the room in  which Mr. Sutherland was hidden&mdash;&ldquo;that unknown to me, unknown to anyone living  but herself, unknown to that good man from whom it can no longer be kept  hidden, Agatha Webb was my mother. I am Philemon&rsquo;s son and not the offspring of  Charles and Marietta Sutherland!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
    A Witness Lost</b></h2>
  <p>Impossible!  Incredible!</p>
  <p>Like  a wave suddenly lifted the whole assemblage rose in surprise if not in protest.  But there was no outburst. The very depth of the feelings evoked made all  ebullition impossible, and as one sees the billow pause ere it breaks, and  gradually subside, so this crowd yielded to its awe, and man by man sank back  into his seat till quiet was again restored, and only a circle of listening  faces confronted the man who had just stirred a whole roomful to its depths.  Seeing this, and realising his opportunity, Frederick at once entered into the  explanations for which each heart there panted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  will be overwhelming news to him who has cared for me since infancy. You have  heard him call me son; with what words shall I overthrow his confidence in the  truth and rectitude of his long-buried wife and make him know in his old age  that he has wasted years of patience upon one who was not of his blood or  lineage? The wonder, the incredulity you manifest are my best excuse for my  long delay in revealing the secret entrusted to me by this dying woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  awed silence greeted these words. Never was the interest of a crowd more  intense or its passions held in greater restraint. Yet Agnes&rsquo;s tears flowed  freely, and Amabel&rsquo;s smiles&mdash;well, their expression had changed; and to  Sweetwater, who alone had eyes for her now, they were surcharged with a tragic  meaning, strange to see in one of her callous nature.</p>
  <p>Frederick&rsquo;s  voice broke as he proceeded in his self-imposed task.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  astounding fact which I have just communicated to you was made known by my  mother, with the dagger still plunged in her breast. She would not let me draw  it out. She knew that death would follow that act, and she prized every moment  remaining to her because of the bliss she enjoyed of seeing and having near her  her only living child. The love, the passion, the boundless devotion she showed  in those last few minutes transformed me in an instant from a selfish brute  into a deeply repentant man. I knelt before her in anguish. I made her feel  that, wicked as I had been, I was not the conscienceless wretch she had  imagined, and that she was mistaken as to the motives which led me into her  presence. And when I saw, by her clearing brow and peaceful look, that I had  fully persuaded her of this, I let her speak what words she would, and tell, as  she was able, the secret tragedy of her life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a sacred story to me, and if you must know it, let it be from her own words  in the letters she left behind her. She only told me that to save me from the  fate of the children who had preceded me, the five little girls and boys who  had perished almost at birth in her arms, she had parted from me in early  infancy to Mrs. Sutherland, then mourning the sudden death of her only child;  that this had been done secretly and under circumstances calculated to deceive  Mr. Sutherland, consequently he had never known I was not his own child, and in  terror of the effect which the truth might have upon him she enjoined me not to  enlighten him now, if by any sacrifice on my part I could rightfully avoid it;  that she was happy in having me hear the truth before she died; that the joy  which this gave her was so great she did not regret her fatal act, violent and  uncalled for as it was, for it had showed her my heart and allowed me to read  hers. Then she talked of my father, by whom I mean him whom you call Philemon;  and she made me promise I would care for him to the last with tenderness,  saying that I would be able to do this without seeming impropriety, since she  had willed me all her fortune under this proviso. Finally, she gave me a key,  and pointing out where the money lay hidden, bade me carry it away as her last  gift, together with the package of letters I would find with it. And when I had  taken these and given her back the key, she told me that but for one thing she  would die happy. And though her strength and breath were fast failing her, she  made me understand that she was worried about the Zabels, who had not come  according to a sacred custom between them, to celebrate the anniversary of her  wedding, and prayed me to see the two old gentlemen before I slept, since  nothing but death or dire distress would have kept them from gratifying the one  whim of my father&rsquo;s failing mind. I promised, and with perfect peace in her  face, she pointed to the dagger in her breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  before I could lay my hand upon it she called for Batsy. &lsquo;I want her to hear me  declare before I go,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that this stroke was delivered by myself upon  myself.&rsquo; But when I rose to look for Batsy I found that the shock of her  mistress&rsquo;s fatal act had killed her and that only her dead body was lying  across the window-sill of the adjoining room. It was a chance that robbed me of  the only witness who could testify to my innocence, in case my presence in this  house of death should become known, and realising all the danger in which it  threw me, I did not dare to tell my mother, for fear it would make her last  moments miserable. So I told her that the poor woman had understood what she  wished, but was too terrified to move or speak; and this satisfied my mother  and made her last breath one of trust and contented love. She died as I drew  the dagger from her breast, and seeing this, I was seized with horror of the  instrument which had cost me such a dear and valuable life and flung it wildly  from the window. Then I lifted her and laid her where you found her, on the  sofa. I did not know that the dagger was an old-time gift of her former lover,  James Zabel, much less that it bore his initials on the handle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused, and the awe occasioned by the scene he had described was so deep and  the silence so prolonged that a shudder passed over the whole assemblage when  from some unknown quarter a single cutting voice arose in this one short,  mocking comment:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the fairy tale!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  it Amabel who spoke? Some thought so and looked her way, but they only beheld a  sweet, tear-stained face turned with an air of moving appeal upon Frederick as  if begging pardon for the wicked doubts which had driven him to this defence.</p>
  <p>Frederick  met that look with one so severe it partook of harshness; then, resuming his  testimony, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is of the Zabel brothers I must now speak, and of how one of them, 
    James by name, came to be involved in this affair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I left my dead mother&rsquo;s side I was in such a state of mind that I passed with  scarcely so much as a glance the room where my new-found father sat sleeping.  But as I hastened on toward the quarter where the Zabels lived, I was seized by  such compunction for his desolate state that I faltered in my rapid flight and  did not arrive at the place of my destination as quickly as I intended. When I  did I found the house dark and the silence sepulchral. But I did not turn away.  Remembering my mother&rsquo;s anxiety, an anxiety so extreme it disturbed her final  moments, I approached the front door and was about to knock when I found it  open. Greatly astonished, I at once passed in, and, seeing my way perfectly in  the moonlight, entered the room on the left, the door of which also stood open.  It was the second house I had entered unannounced that night, and in this as in  the other I encountered a man sitting asleep by the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was John, the elder of the two, and, perceiving that he was suffering for food  and in a condition of extreme misery, I took out the first bill my hand  encountered in my overfull pockets and laid it on the table by his side. As I  did so he gave a sigh, but did not wake; and satisfied that I had done all that  was wise and all that even my mother would expect of me under the  circumstances, and fearing to encounter the other brother if I lingered, I  hastened away and took the shortest path home. Had I been more of a man, or if  my visit to Mrs. Webb had been actuated by a more communicable motive, I would  have gone at once to the good man who believed me to be of his own flesh and  blood, and told him of the strange and heart-rending adventure which had  changed the whole tenor of my thoughts and life, and begged his advice as to  what I had better do under the difficult circumstances in which I found myself  placed. But the memory of a thousand past ingratitudes, together with the  knowledge of the shock which he could not fail to receive on learning at this  late day, and under conditions at once so tragic and full of menace, that the  child which his long-buried wife had once placed in his arms as his own was  neither of her blood nor his, rose up between us and caused me not only to  attempt silence, but to secrete in the adjoining woods the money I had  received, in the vain hope that all visible connection between myself and my  mother&rsquo;s tragic death would thus be lost. You see I had not calculated on Miss  Amabel Page.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  flash he here received from that lady&rsquo;s eyes startled the crowd, and gave  Sweetwater, already suffering under shock after shock of mingled surprise and  wonder, his first definite idea that he had never rightly understood the  relations between these two, and that something besides justice had actuated  Amabel in her treatment of this young man. This feeling was shared by others,  and a reaction set in in Frederick&rsquo;s favour, which even affected the officials  who were conducting the inquiry. This was shown by the difference of manner now  assumed by the coroner and by the more easily impressed Sweetwater, who had not  yet learned the indispensable art of hiding his feelings. Frederick himself  felt the change and showed it by the look of relief and growing confidence he  cast at Agnes.</p>
  <p>Of  the questions and answers which now passed between him and the various members  of the jury I need give no account. They but emphasised facts already known,  and produced but little change in the general feeling, which was now one of  suppressed pity for all who had been drawn into the meshes of this tragic mystery.  When he was allowed to resume his seat, the name of Miss Amabel Page was again  called.</p>
  <p>She  rose with a bound. Nought that she had anticipated had occurred; facts of which  she could know nothing had changed the aspect of affairs and made the position  of Frederick something so remote from any she could have imagined, that she was  still in the maze of the numberless conflicting emotions which these  revelations were calculated to call out in one who had risked all on the hazard  of a die and lost. She did not even know at this moment whether she was glad or  sorry he could explain so cleverly his anomalous position. She had caught the  look he had cast at Agnes, and while this angered her, it did not greatly  modify her opinion that he was destined for herself. For, however other people  might feel, she did not for a moment believe his story. She had not a pure  enough heart to do so. To her all self-sacrifice was an anomaly. No woman of  the mental or physical strength of Agatha Webb would plant a dagger in her own  breast just to prevent another person from committing a crime, were he lover,  husband, or son. So Amabel believed and so would these others believe also when  once relieved of the magnetic personality of this extraordinary witness. Yet  how thrilling it had been to hear him plead his cause so well! It was almost  worth the loss of her revenge to meet his look of hate, and dream of the  possibility of turning it later into the old look of love. Yes, yes, she loved  him now; not for his position, for that was gone; not even for his money, for  she could contemplate its loss; but for himself, who had so boldly shown that  he was stronger than she and could triumph over her by the sheer force of his  masculine daring.</p>
  <p>With  such feelings, what should she say to these men; how conduct herself under  questions which would be much more searching now than before? She could not  even decide in her own mind. She must let impulse have its way.</p>
  <p>Happily,  she took the right stand at first. She did not endeavour to make any corrections  in her former testimony, only acknowledging that the flower whose presence on  the scene of death had been such a mystery, had fallen from her hair at the  ball and that she had seen Frederick pick it up and put it in his buttonhole.  Beyond this, and the inferences it afterward awakened in her mind, she would  not go, though many present, and among them Frederick, felt confident that her  attitude had been one of suspicion from the first, and that it was to follow  him rather than to supply the wants of the old man, Zabel, she had left the  ball and found her way to Agatha Webb&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_32"></a>Chapter 32<br>
    Why Agatha Webb Will Never Be Forgotten In Sutherlandtown</b></h2>
  <p>Meanwhile  Sweetwater had been witness to a series of pantomimic actions that interested  him more than Amabel&rsquo;s conduct under this final examination. Frederick, who had  evidently some request to make or direction to give, had sent a written line to  the coroner, who, on reading it, had passed it over to Knapp, who a few minutes  later was to be seen in conference with Agnes Halliday. As a result, the latter  rose and left the room, followed by the detective. She was gone a half-hour,  then simultaneously with her reappearance, Sweetwater saw Knapp hand a bundle  of letters to the coroner, who, upon opening them, chose out several which he  proceeded to read to the jury. They were the letters referred to by Frederick  as having been given to him by his mother. The first was dated thirty-five  years previously and was in the handwriting of Agatha herself. It was directed  to James Zabel, and was read amid a profound hush.</p>
  <p>Dear James:<br>
    You are too presumptuous. When I let you carry me away from John in that  maddening reel last night, I did not mean you to draw the inference you did.  That you did draw it argues a touch of vanity in a man who is not alone in the  field where he imagines himself victor. John, who is humbler, sees some merit  in&mdash;well, in Frederick Snow, let us say. So do I, but merit does not always win,  any more than presumption. When we meet, let it be as friends, but as friends  only. A girl cannot be driven into love. To ride on your big mare, Judith, is  bliss enough for my twenty years. Why don&rsquo;t you find it so too? I think I hear  you say you do, but only when she stops at a certain gate on Portchester highway.  Folly! there are other roads and other gates, though if I should see you enter  one&mdash;There! my pen is galloping away with me faster than Judith ever did, and it  is time I drew rein. Present my regards to John&mdash;But no; then he would know I  had written you a letter, and that might hurt him. How could he guess it was  only a scolding letter, such as it would grieve him to receive, and that it  does not count for anything! Were it to Frederick Snow, now&mdash;There! some horses  are so hard to pull up&mdash;and so are some pens. I will come to a standstill, but  not before your door.</p>
  <p>Respectfully  your neighbour,<br>
    Agatha Gilchrist.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Dear James:<br>
    I know I have a temper, a wicked temper,  and now you know it too. When it is roused, I forget love, gratitude, and  everything else that should restrain me, and utter words I am myself astonished  at. But I do not get roused often, and when all is over I am not averse to  apologising or even to begging forgiveness. My father says my temper will undo  me, but I am much more afraid of my heart than I am of my temper. For instance,  here I am writing to you again just because I raised my riding-whip and  said&mdash;But you know what I said, and I am not fond of recalling the words, for I  cannot do so without seeing your look of surprise and contrasting it with that  of Philemon&rsquo;s. Yours had judgment in it, while Philemon&rsquo;s held only indulgence.  Yet I liked yours best, or should have liked it best if it were not for the  insufferable pride which is a part of my being. Temper such as mine<i> ought </i>to surprise you, yet would I be  Agatha Gilchrist without it? I very much fear not. And not being Agatha  Gilchrist, should I have your love? Again I fear not. James, forgive me. When I  am happier, when I know my own heart, I will have less provocation. Then, if that  heart turns your way, you will find a great and bountiful serenity where now  there are lowering and thunderous tempests. Philemon said last night that he  would be content to have my fierce word o&rsquo; mornings, if only I would give him  one drop out of the honey of my better nature when the sun went down and  twilight brought reflection and love. But I did not like him any the better for  saying this, <i>you</i> would not halve the  day so. The cup with which you would refresh yourself must hold no bitterness.  Will it not have to be proffered, then, by other hands than those of<br>
    Agatha Gilchrist?</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Mr. Philemon Webb<br>
    Respected Sir:<br>
    You are persistent. I am willing to tell <i>you</i>,  though I shall never confide so much to another, that it will take a stronger  nature than yours, and one that loves me less, to hold me faithful and make me  the happy, devoted wife which I must be if I would not be a demon. I cannot, I  dare not, marry where I am not held in a passionate, self-forgetful subjection.  I am too proud, too sensitive, too little mistress of myself when angry or  aroused. If, like some strong women, I loved what was weaker than myself, and  could be controlled by goodness and unlimited kindness, I might venture to risk  living at the side of the most indulgent and upright man I know. But I am not  of that kind. Strength only can command my admiration or subdue my pride. I  must fear where I love, and own for husband him who has first shown himself my  master.</p>
  <p>So  do not fret any more for me, for you, less than any man I know, will ever claim  my obedience or command my love. Not that I will not yield my heart to you, but  that I cannot; and, knowing that I cannot, feel it honest to say so before any  more of your fine, young manhood is wasted. Go your ways, then, Philemon, and  leave me to the rougher paths my feet were made to tread. I like you now and  feel something like a tender regard for your goodness, but if you persist in a  courtship which only my father is inclined to smile upon, you will call up an  antagonism that can lead to nothing but evil, for the serpent that lies coiled  in my breast has deadly fangs, and is to be feared, as you should know who have  more than once seen me angry.</p>
  <p>Do  not blame John or James Zabel, or Frederick Snow, or even Samuel Barton for  this. It would be the same if none of these men existed. I was not made to  triumph over a kindly nature, but to yield the haughtiest heart in all this  county to the gentle but firm control of its natural master. Do you want to  know who that master is? I cannot tell you, for I have not yet named him to  myself.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Dear James:<br>
    I am going away. I am going to leave  Portchester for several months. I am going to see the world. I did not tell you  this last night for fear of weakening under your entreaties, or should I say  commands? Lately I have felt myself weakening more than once, and I want to  know what it means. Absence will teach me, absence and the sight of new faces.  Do you quarrel with this necessity? Do you think I should know my mind without  any such test? Alas! James, it is not a simple mind and it baffles me at times.  Let us then give it a chance. If the glow and glamour of elegant city life can  make me forget certain snatches of talk at our old gate, or that night when you  drew my hand through your arm and softly kissed my fingertips, then I am no  mate for you, whose love, however critical, has never wavered, but has made  itself felt, even in rebuke, as the strongest, sweetest thing that has entered  my turbulent life. Because I would be worthy of you, I submit to a separation  which will either be a permanent one or the last that will ever take place  between you and me. John will not bear this as well as you, yet he does not  love me as well, possibly because to him I am simply a superior being, while to  you I am a loving but imperfect woman who wishes to do right but can only do so  under the highest guidance.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Dear John:<br>
    I feel that I owe you a letter because  you have been so patient. You may show it to James if you like, but I mean it  for you as an old and dear friend who will one day dance at my wedding.</p>
  <p>I  am living in a whirl of enjoyment. I am seeing and tasting of pleasures I have  only dreamed about till now. From a farmhouse kitchen to Mrs. Andrews&rsquo;s  drawing-room is a lively change for a girl who loves dress and show only less  than daily intercourse with famous men and brilliant women. But I am bearing it  nobly and have developed tastes I did not know I possessed; expensive tastes,  John, which I fear may unfit me for the humble life of a Portchester matron.  Can you imagine me dressed in rich brocade, sitting in the midst of Washington&rsquo;s  choicest citizens and exchanging sallies with senators and judges? You may find  it hard, yet so it is, and no one seems to think I am out of place, nor do I feel  so, only&mdash;do not tell James&mdash;there are movements in my heart at times which make  me shut my eyes when the lights are brightest, and dream, if but for an  instant, of home and the tumble-down gateway where I have so often leaned when  someone (you know who it is now, John, and I shall not hurt you too deeply by  mentioning him) was saying good-night and calling down the blessings of Heaven  upon a head not worthy to receive them.</p>
  <p>Does  this argue my speedy return? Perhaps. Yet I do not know. There are fond hearts  here also, and a life in this country&rsquo;s centre would be a great life for me if  only I could forget the touch of a certain restraining hand which has great  power over me even as a memory. For the sake of that touch shall I give up the  grandeur and charm of this broad life? Answer, John. You know him and me well  enough now to say.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Dear John:<br>
    I do not understand your letter. You  speak in affectionate terms of everybody, yet you beg me to wait and not be in  a hurry to return. Why? Do you not realise that such words only make me the  more anxious to see old Portchester again? If there is anything amiss at home,  or if James is learning to do without me&mdash;but you do not say that; you only  intimate that perhaps I will be better able to make up my mind later than now,  and hint of great things to come if I will only hold my affections in check a  little longer. This is all very ambiguous and demands a fuller explanation. So  write to me once more, John, or I shall sever every engagement I have made here  and return.</p>

    Your letter is plain enough this time.  James read the letter I wrote you about my pleasure in the life here and was  displeased at it. He thinks I am growing worldly and losing that simplicity  which he has always looked upon as my most attractive characteristic. So! so!  Well, James is right; I am becoming less the country girl and more the woman of  the world every day I remain here. That means I am becoming less worthy of him.  So&mdash;But whatever else I have to say on this topic must be said to him. For this  you will pardon me like the good brother you are. I cannot help my preference.  He is nearer my own age; besides, we were made for each other.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Dear James:<br>
    I am not worldly; I am not carried away  by the pleasures and satisfactions of this place,&mdash;at least not to the point of  forgetting what is dearer and better. I have seen Washington, I have seen gay  life; I like it, but I <i>love</i> Portchester. Consequently I am going to return to Portchester, and that very  soon. Indeed I cannot stay away much longer, and if you are glad of this, and  if you wish to be convinced that a girl who has been wearing brocade and jewels  can content herself quite gaily again with calico, come up to the dear old gate  a week from now and you will have the opportunity. Do you object to flowers? I  may wear a flower in my hair.</p>
  <p>Your  wayward but ever-constant<br>
    Agatha.</p>

  <p>Dear James:<br>
    Why must I write? Why am I not content  with the memory of last night? When one&rsquo;s cup is quite full, a cup that has  been so long in filling,&mdash;must some few drops escape just to show that a great  joy like mine is not satisfied to be simply quiescent? I have suffered so long  from uncertainty, have tried you and tried myself with so tedious an  indecision, that, now I know no other man can ever move my heart as you have  done, the ecstasy of it makes me over-demonstrative. I want to tell you that I  love you; that I do not simply accept your love, but give you back in fullest  measure all the devotion you have heaped upon me in spite of my many faults and  failings. You took me to your heart last night, and seemed satisfied; but it  does not satisfy me that I just let you do it without telling you that I am  proud and happy to be the chosen one of your heart, and that as I saw your smile  and the proud passion which lit up your face, I felt how much sweeter was the  dear domestic bliss you promised me than the more brilliant but colder life of  a statesman&rsquo;s wife in Washington.</p>
  <p>I  missed the flower from my hair when I went back to my room last night. Did you  take it, dear? If so, do not cherish it. I hate to think of anything withering  on your breast. My love is deathless, James, and owns no such symbol as that.  But perhaps you are not thinking of my love, but of my faults. If so, let the  flower remain where you have put it; and when you gaze on it say, &ldquo;Thus is it  with the defects of my darling; once in full bloom, now a withered remembrance.  When I gathered her they began to fade.&rdquo; O James, I feel as if I never could  feel anger again.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Dear James:<br>
    I do not, I cannot, believe it. Though  you said to me on going out, &ldquo;Your father will explain,&rdquo; I cannot content  myself with his explanations and will never believe what he said of you except  you confirm his accusations by your own act. If, after I have told you exactly  what passed between us, you return me this and other letters, then I shall know  that I have leaned my weight on a hollow staff, and that henceforth I am to be  without protector or comforter in this world.</p>
  <p>O  James, were we not happy! I believed in you and felt that you believed in me.  When we stood heart to heart under the elm tree (was it only last night?) and  you swore that if it lay in the power of earthly man to make me happy, I should  taste every sweet that a woman&rsquo;s heart naturally craved, I thought my heaven  had already come and that now it only remained for me to create yours. Yet that  very minute my father was approaching us, and in another instant we heard these  words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;James,  I must talk with you before you make my daughter forget herself any further.&rdquo;  Forget herself! What had happened? This was not the way my father had been  accustomed to talk, much as he had always favoured the suit of Philemon Webb,  and pleased as he would have been had my choice fallen on him. Forget herself!  I looked at you to see how these insulting words would affect you. But while  you turned pale, or seemed to do so in the fading moonlight, you were not quite  so unprepared for them as I was myself, and instead of showing anger, followed  my father into the house, leaving me shivering in a spot which had held no  chill for me a moment before. You were gone&mdash;how long? To me it seemed an hour,  and perhaps it was. It would seem to take that long for a man&rsquo;s face to show  such change as yours did when you confronted me again in the moonlight. Yet a  lightning stroke makes quick work, and perhaps my countenance in that one  minute showed as great a change as yours. Else why did you shudder away from  me, and to my passionate appeal reply with this one short phrase: &ldquo;Your father  will explain&rdquo;? Did you think any other words than yours would satisfy me, or  that I could believe even him when he accused you of a base and dishonest act?  Much as I have always loved and revered my father, I find it impossible not to  hope that in his wish to see me united to Philemon he has resorted to an  unworthy subterfuge to separate us; therefore I give you our interview word for  word. May it shock you as much as it shocked me. Here is what he said first:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agatha,  you cannot marry James Zabel. He is not an honest man. He has defrauded me, <i>me</i>, your father, of several thousand  dollars. In a clever way, too, showing him to be as subtle as he is  unprincipled. Shall I tell you the wretched story, my girl? He has left me to  do so. He sees as plainly as I do that any communication between you two after  the discovery I have this day made would be but an added offence. He is at  least a gentleman, which is something, considering how near he came to being my  son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  may have answered. People do cry out when they are stabbed, sometimes, but I  rather think I did not say a word, only looked a disdain which at that minute  was as measureless as my belief in you. <i>You</i> dishonest? <i>You</i>&mdash;Or perhaps I laughed;  that would have been truer to my feeling; yes, I must have laughed.</p>
  <p>My  father&rsquo;s next words indicated that I did something.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not believe in his guilt,&rdquo; he went on, and there was a kindness in his tone  which gave me my first feeling of real terror. &ldquo;I can readily comprehend that,  Agatha. He has been in my office and acted under my eye for several years now,  and I had almost as much confidence in him as you had, notwithstanding the fact  that I liked him much better as my confidential clerk than as your probable or  prospective husband. He has never held the key to my heart; would God he never  had to yours! But he was a good and reliable man in the office, or so I  thought, and I gave into his hand much of the work I ought to have done myself,  especially since my health has more or less failed me. My trust he abused. A  month ago&mdash;it was during that ill turn you remember I received a letter from a  man I had never expected to hear from again. He was in my debt some ten  thousand dollars, and wrote that he had brought with him as much of this sum as  he had been able to save in the last five years, to Sutherlandtown, where he  was now laid up with a dangerous illness from which he had small hope of  recovering. Would I come there and get it? He was a stranger and wished to take  no one into his confidence, but he had the money and would be glad to place it  in my hands. He added that as he was a lone man, without friends or relatives  to inherit from him, he felt a decided pleasure at the prospect of satisfying  his only creditor, and devoutly hoped he would be well enough to realise the  transaction and receive my receipt. But if his fever increased and he should be  delirious or unconscious when I reached him, then I was to lift up the  left-hand corner of the mattress on which he lay and take from underneath his head  a black wallet in which I would find the money promised me. He had elsewhere  enough to pay all his expenses, so that the full contents of the wallet were  mine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remembered the man and I wanted the money; so, not being able to go for it  myself, I authorised James Zabel to collect it for me. He started at once for  Sutherlandtown, and in a few hours returned with the wallet alluded to. Though  I was suffering intensely at the time, I remember distinctly the air with which  he laid it down and the words with which he endeavoured to carry off a certain  secret excitement visible in him. &lsquo;Mr. Orr was alive, sir, and fully conscious;  but he will not outlive the night. He seemed quite satisfied with the messenger  and gave up the wallet without any hesitation.&rsquo; I roused up and looked at him. &lsquo;What  has shaken you up so?&rsquo; I asked. He was silent a moment before replying. &lsquo;I have  ridden fast,&rsquo; said he; then more slowly, &lsquo;One feels sorry for a man dying alone  and amongst strangers.&rsquo; I thought he showed an unnecessary emotion, but paid no  further heed to it at the time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  wallet held two thousand and more dollars, which was less than I expected, but  yet a goodly sum and very welcome. As I was counting it over I glanced at the  paper accompanying it. It was an acknowledgment of debt and mentioned the exact  sum I should find in the wallet&mdash;$2753.67. Pointing them out to James, I  remarked, &lsquo;The figures are in different ink from the words. How do you account  for that?&rsquo; I thought his answer rather long in coming, though when it did come  it was calm, if not studied. &lsquo;I presume,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that the sum was inserted  at Sutherlandtown, after Mr. Orr was quite sure just how much he could spare  for the liquidation of this old debt.&rsquo; &lsquo;Very likely,&rsquo; I assented, not bestowing  another thought upon the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  to-day it has been forced back upon my attention in a curious if not  providential way. I was over in Sutherlandtown for the first time since my  illness, and having some curiosity about my unfortunate but honest debtor, went  to the hotel and asked to see the room in which he died. It being empty they at  once showed it to me; and satisfied that he had been made comfortable in his  last hours, I was turning away, when I espied on a table in one corner an  inkstand and what seemed to be an old copy-book. Why I stopped and approached  this table I do not know, but once in front of it I remembered what Zabel had  said about the figures, and taking up the pen I saw there, I dipped it in the  ink-pot and attempted to scribble a number or two on a piece of loose paper I  found in the copy-book. The ink was thick and the pen corroded, so that it was  not till after several ineffectual efforts that I succeeded in making any  strokes that were at all legible. But when I did, they were so exactly similar  in colour to the numbers inserted in Mr. Orr&rsquo;s memorandum (which I had  fortunately brought with me) that I was instantly satisfied this especial  portion of the writing had been done, as James had said, in this room, and with  the very pen I was then handling. As there was nothing extraordinary in this, I  was turning away, when a gust of wind from the open window lifted the loose  sheet of paper I had been scribbling on and landed it, the other side up, on  the carpet. As I stooped for it I saw figures on it, and feeling sure that they  had been scrawled there by Mr. Orr in his attempt to make the pen write, I  pulled out the memorandum again and compared the two minutely. They were the  work of the same hand, but the figures on the stray leaf differed from those in  the memorandum in a very important particular. Those in the memorandum began  with a 2, while those on the stray sheet began with a 7&mdash;a striking difference.  Look, Agatha, here is the piece of paper just as I found it. You see here,  there, and everywhere the one set of figures, 7753.67. Here it is hardly  legible, here it is blotted with too much ink, here it is faint but  sufficiently distinct, and here&mdash;well, there can be no mistake about these  figures, 7753.67; yet the memorandum reads, $2753.67, and the money returned to  me amounts to $2753.67&mdash;a clean five thousand dollars&rsquo; difference.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here,  James, my father paused, perhaps to give me a commiserating look, though I did  not need it; perhaps to give himself a moment in which to regain courage for  what he still had to say. I did not break the silence; I was too sure of your  integrity; besides, my tongue could not have moved if it would; all my  faculties seemed frozen except that instinct which cried out continually within  me: &ldquo;No! there is no fault in James. He has done no wrong. No one but himself  shall ever convince me that he has robbed anyone of anything except poor me of  my poor heart.&rdquo; But inner cries of this kind are inaudible and after a moment&rsquo;s  interval my father went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  thousand dollars is no petty sum, and the discrepancy in the two sets of  figures which seemed to involve me in so considerable a loss set me thinking.  Convinced that Mr. Orr would not be likely to scribble one number over so many  times if it was not the one then in his mind, I went to Mr. Forsyth&rsquo;s office  and borrowed a magnifying-glass, through which I again subjected the figures in  the memorandum to a rigid scrutiny. The result was a positive conviction that  they had been tampered with after their first writing, either by Mr. Orr  himself or by another whom I need not name. The 2 had originally been a 7, and  I could even see where the top line of the 7 had been given a curl and where a  horizontal stroke had been added at the bottom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agatha,  I came home as troubled a man as there was in all these parts. I remembered the  suppressed excitement which had been in James Zabel&rsquo;s face when he handed me  over the money, and I remembered also that you loved him, or thought you did,  and that, love or no love, you were pledged to marry him. If I had not recalled  all this I might have proceeded more warily. As it was, I took the bold and  open course and gave James Zabel an opportunity to explain himself. Agatha, he  did not embrace it. He listened to my accusations and followed my finger when I  pointed out the discrepancy between the two sets of figures, but he made no  protestations of innocence, nor did he show me the front of an honest man when  I asked if he expected me to believe that the wallet had held only two thousand  and over when Mr. Orr handed it over to him. On the contrary he seemed to  shrink into himself like a person whose life has been suddenly blasted, and  replying that he would expect me to believe nothing except his extreme  contrition at the abuse of confidence of which he had been guilty, begged me to  wait till to-morrow before taking any active steps in the matter. I replied  that I would show him that much consideration if he would immediately drop all  pretensions to your hand. This put him in a bad way; but he left, as you see,  with just a simple injunction to you to seek from me an explanation of his  strange departure. Does that look like innocence or does it look like guilt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  found my tongue at this and passionately cried: &ldquo;James Zabel&rsquo;s life, as I have  known it, shows him to be an honest man. If he has done what you suggest, given  you but a portion of the money entrusted to him and altered the figures in the  memorandum to suit the amount he brought you, then there is a discrepancy  between this act and all the other acts of his life which I find it more  difficult to reconcile than you did the two sets of figures in Mr. Orr&rsquo;s  handwriting. Father, I must hear from his own lips a confirmation of your  suspicions before I will credit them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  this is why I write you so minute an account of what passed between my father  and myself last night. If his account of the matter is a correct one, and you  have nothing to add to it in way of explanation, then the return of this letter  will be token enough that my father has been just in his accusations and that  the bond between us must be broken. But if&mdash;O James, if you are the true man I  consider you, and all that I have heard is a fabrication or mistake, then come  to me at once; do not delay, but come at once, and the sight of your face at  the gate will be enough to establish your innocence in my eyes.<br>
    Agatha.</p>
  <p>The  letter that followed this was very short:</p>
  <p>Dear James:<br>
    The package of letters has been received.  God help me to bear this shock to all my hopes and the death of all my girlish  beliefs. I am not angry. Only those who have something left to hold on to in  life can be angry.</p>
  <p>My  father tells me he has received a packet too. It contained five thousand  dollars in ten five-hundred-dollar notes. James! James! was not my love enough,  that you should want my father&rsquo;s money too?</p>
  <p>I  have begged my father, and he has promised me, to keep the cause of this  rupture secret. No one shall know from either of us that James Zabel has any  flaw in his nature.</p>
  <p>The  next letter was dated some months later. It is to Philemon:</p>
  <p>Dear Philemon:<br>
    The gloves are too small; besides, I  never wear gloves. I hate their restraint and do not feel there is any good  reason for hiding my hands, in this little country town where everyone knows  me. Why not give them to Hattie Weller? She likes such things, while I have had  my fill of finery. A girl whose one duty is to care for a dying father has no  room left in her heart for vanities.</p>
  <p>Dear Philemon:<br>
    It is impossible. I have had my day of  love and my heart is quite dead. Show your magnanimity by ceasing to urge me  any longer to forget the past. It is all you can do for<br>
    Agatha.</p>
  <p>Dear Philemon:<br>
    You <i>will</i> have my hand though I have told you that my heart does not go with it. It is  hard to understand such persistence, but if you are satisfied to take a woman  of my strength against her will, then God have mercy upon you, for I will be  your wife.</p>
  <p>But  do not ask me to go to Sutherlandtown. I will live here. And do not expect to  keep up your intimacy with the Zabels. There is no tie of affection remaining  between James and myself, but if I am to shed that half-light over your home  which is all I can promise and all that you can hope to receive, then keep me  from all influence but your own. That this in time may grow sweet and dear to  me is my earnest prayer to-day, for you are worthy of a true wife.<br>
    Agatha.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Dear John:<br>
    I am going to be married. My father  exacts it and there is no good reason why I should not give him this final  satisfaction. At least I do not think there is; but if you or your brother  differ from me&mdash;Say good-bye to James from me. I pray that his life may be  peaceful. I know that it will be honest.<br>
    Agatha.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Dear Philemon:<br>
    My father is worse. He fears that if we  wait till Tuesday he will not be able to see us married. Decide, then, what our  duty is; I am ready to abide by your pleasure.<br>
    Agatha.</p>
  <p>The  following is from John Zabel to his brother James, and is dated one day after  the above:</p>
  <p>Dear James:<br>
    When you read this I will be far away, never to look in your face again, unless  you bid me. Brother, brother, I meant it for the best, but God was not with me  and I have made four hearts miserable without giving help to anyone.</p>
  <p>When  I read Agatha&rsquo;s letter&mdash;the last for more reasons than one that I shall ever  receive from her&mdash;I seemed to feel as never before what I had done to blast your  two lives. For the first time I realised to the full that but for me she might  have been happy and you the respected husband of the one grand woman to be  found in Portchester. That I had loved her so fiercely myself came back to me  in reproach, and the thought that she perhaps suspected that the blame had  fallen where it was not deserved roused me to such a pitch that I took the  sudden and desperate resolution of telling her the truth before she gave her  hand to Philemon. Why the daily sight of your misery should not have driven me  before to this act, I cannot tell. Some remnants of the old jealousy may have  been still festering in my heart; or the sense of the great distance between your  self-sacrificing spirit and the selfishness of my weaker nature risen like a  barrier between me and the only noble act left for a man in my position.  Whatever the cause, it was not till to-day the full determination came to brave  the obloquy of a full confession; but when it did come I did not pause till I  reached Mr. Gilchrist&rsquo;s house and was ushered into his presence.</p>
  <p>He  was lying on the sitting-room lounge, looking very weak and exhausted, while on  one side of him stood Agatha and on the other Philemon, both contemplating him  with ill-concealed anxiety. I had not expected to find Philemon there, and for  a moment I suffered the extreme agony of a man who has not measured the depth  of the plunge he is about to take; but the sight of Agatha trembling under the  shock of my unexpected presence restored me to myself and gave me firmness to  proceed. Advancing with a bow, I spoke quickly the one word I had come there to  say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agatha,  I have done you a great wrong and I am here to undo it. For months I have felt  driven to confession, but not till to-day have I possessed the necessary  courage. <i>Now</i>, nothing shall hinder  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  said this because I saw in both Mr. Gilchrist and Philemon a disposition to  stop me where I was. Indeed Mr. Gilchrist had risen on his elbow and Philemon  was making that pleading gesture of his which we know so well.</p>
  <p>Agatha  alone looked eager. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I have a right to know.&rdquo; I went  to the door, shut it, and stood with my back against it, a figure of shame and  despair; suddenly the confession burst from me. &ldquo;Agatha,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;why did you  break with my brother James? Because you thought him guilty of theft; because  you believed he took the five thousand dollars out of the sum entrusted to him  by Mr. Orr for your father. Agatha, it was not James who did this it was I; and  James knew it, and bore the blame of my misdoing because he was always a loyal  soul and took account of my weakness and knew, alas! too well, that open shame  would kill me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a weak plea and merited no reply. But the silence was so dreadful and  lasted so long that I felt first crushed and then terrified. Raising my head,  for I had not dared to look any of them in the face, I cast one glance at the  group before me and dropped my head again, startled. Only one of the three was  looking at me, and that was Agatha. The others had their heads turned aside,  and I thought, or rather the passing fancy took me, that they shrank from  meeting her gaze with something of the same shame and dread I myself felt. But  she! Can I ever hope to make you realise her look, or comprehend the pang of  utter self-abasement with which I succumbed before it? It was so terrible that  I seemed to hear her utter words, though I am sure she did not speak; and with  some wild idea of stemming the torrent of her reproaches, I made an effort at  explanation, and impetuously cried: &ldquo;It was not for my own good, Agatha, not  for self altogether, I did this. I too loved you, madly, despairingly, and,  good brother as I seemed, I was jealous of James and hoped to take his place in  your regard if I could show a greater prosperity and get for you those things  his limited prospects denied him. You enjoy money, beauty, ease; I could see  that by your letters, and if James could not give them to you and I could&mdash;Oh,  do not look at me like that! I see now that millions could not have bought you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Despicable!&rdquo;  was all that came from her lips. At which I shuddered and groped about for the  handle of the door. But she would not let me go. Subduing with an unexpected  grand self-restraint the emotions which had hitherto swelled too high in her  breast for either speech or action, she thrust out one arm to stay me and said  in short, commanding tones: &ldquo;How was this thing done? You say you took the  money, yet it was James who was sent to collect it&mdash;or so my father says.&rdquo; Here  she tore her looks from me and cast one glance at her father. What she saw I  cannot say, but her manner changed and henceforth she glanced his way as much  as mine and with nearly as much emotion. &ldquo;I am waiting to hear what you have to  say,&rdquo; she exclaimed, laying her hand on the door over my head so as to leave me  no opportunity for escape. I bowed and attempted an explanation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agatha,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;the commission was given to James and he rode to Sutherlandtown to  perform it. But it was on the day when he was accustomed to write to you, and  he was not easy in his mind, for he feared he would miss sending you his usual  letter. When, therefore, he came to the hotel and saw me in Philemon&rsquo;s room&mdash;I  was often there in those days, often without Philemon&rsquo;s knowing it&mdash;he saw, or  thought he did, a way out of his difficulties. Entering where I was, he  explained to me his errand, and we being then&mdash;though never, alas! since&mdash;one in  everything but the secret hopes he enjoyed, he asked me if I would go in his  stead to Mr. Orr&rsquo;s room, present my credentials, and obtain the money while he  wrote the letter with which his mind was full. Though my jealousy was aroused  and I hated the letter he was about to write, I did not see how I could refuse  him; so after receiving such credentials as he himself carried, and getting  full instructions how to proceed, I left him writing at Philemon&rsquo;s table and  hastened down the hall to the door he had pointed out. If Providence had been  on the side of guilt, the circumstances could not have been more favourable for  the deception I afterwards played. No one was in the hall, no one was with Mr.  Orr to note that it was I instead of James who executed Mr. Gilchrist&rsquo;s  commission. But I was thinking of no deception then. I proceeded quite  innocently on my errand, and when the feeble voice of the invalid bade me  enter, I experienced nothing but a feeling of compassion for a man dying in  this desolate way, alone. Of course Mr. Orr was surprised to see a stranger,  but after reading Mr. Gilchrist&rsquo;s letter which I handed him, he seemed quite  satisfied and himself drew out the wallet at the head of his bed and handed it  over. &lsquo;You will find,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;a memorandum inside of the full amount,  $7758.67. I should like to have returned Mr. Gilchrist the full ten thousand  which I owe him, but this is all I possess, barring a hundred dollars which I  have kept for my final expenses.&rsquo; &lsquo;Mr. Gilchrist will be satisfied,&rsquo; I assured  him. &lsquo;Shall I make you out a receipt?&rsquo; He shook his head with a sad smile. &lsquo;I  shall be dead in twenty-four hours. What good will a receipt do me?&rsquo; But it  seemed unbusinesslike not to give it, so I went over to the table, where I saw  a pen and paper, and recognising the necessity of counting the money before  writing a receipt, I ran my eye over the bills, which were large, and found the  wallet contained just the amount he had named. Then I glanced at the  memorandum. It had evidently been made out by him at some previous time, for  the body of the writing was in firm characters and the ink blue, while the  figures were faintly inscribed in muddy black. The 7 especially was little more  than a straight line, and as I looked at it the devil that is in every man&rsquo;s  nature whispered at first carelessly, then with deeper and deeper insistence: &lsquo;How  easy it would be to change that 7 to a 2! Only a little mark at the top and the  least additional stroke at the bottom and these figures would stand for five  thousand less. It might be a temptation to some men.&rsquo; It presently became a  temptation to me; for, glancing furtively up, I discovered that Mr. Orr had  fallen either into a sleep or into a condition of insensibility which made him  oblivious to my movements. Five thousand dollars! just the sum of the ten  five-hundred-dollar bills that made the bulk of the amount I had counted. In  this village and at my age this sum would raise me at once to comparative  independence. The temptation was too strong for resistance. I succumbed to it,  and seizing the pen before me, I made the fatal marks. When I went back to  James the wallet was in my hand, and the ten five-hundred-dollar bills in my  breast pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agatha  had begun to shudder. She shook so she rattled the door against which I leaned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when you found that Providence was not so much upon your side as you thought,  when you saw that the fraud was known and that your brother was suspected of  it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;  I pleaded, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make me recall that hour!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  she was inexorable. &ldquo;Recall that and every hour,&rdquo; she commanded.  &ldquo;Tell me why he sacrificed himself, why he sacrificed me, to a cur&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  feared her own tongue, she feared her own anger, and stopped. &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; she  whispered, and it was the most ghastly whisper that ever left mortal lips. I  was but a foot from her and she held me as by a strong enchantment. I could not  help obeying her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  make it all clear,&rdquo; I pursued, &ldquo;I must go back to the time I rejoined James in  Philemon&rsquo;s room. He had finished his letter when I entered and was standing  with it, sealed, in his hand. I may have cast it a disdainful glance. I may  have shown that I was no longer the same man I had been when I left him a  half-hour before, for he looked curiously at me for a moment previous to  saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is  that the wallet you have there? Was Mr. Orr conscious, and did he give it to  you himself?&rsquo; &lsquo;Mr. Orr was conscious,&rsquo; I returned,&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t like the sound  of my own voice, careful as I was to speak naturally,&mdash;&rsquo; but he fainted just  before I came out, and I think you had better ask the clerk as you go down to  send someone up to him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;James  was weighing the pocket-book in his hand. &lsquo;How much do you think there is in  here? The debt was ten thousand.&rsquo; I had turned carelessly away and was looking  out of the window. &lsquo;The memorandum inside gives the figures as two thousand,&rsquo; I  declared. &lsquo;He apologises for not sending the full amount. He hasn&rsquo;t it.&rsquo; Again  I felt James looking at me. Why? Could he see that guilty wad of bills lying on  my breast? &lsquo;How came you to read the memorandum?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;Mr. Orr wished me  to. I looked at it to please him.&rsquo; This was a lie&mdash;the first I had ever uttered.  James&rsquo;s eyes had not moved. &lsquo;John,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;this little bit of business seems  to have disturbed you. I ought to have attended to it myself. I am quite sure I  ought to have attended to it myself.&rsquo; &lsquo;The man is dying,&rsquo; I muttered. &lsquo;You  escaped a sad sight. Be satisfied that you have got the money. Shall I post  that letter for you?&rsquo; He put it jealously in his pocket, and again I saw him  look at me, but he said nothing more except that he repeated that same phrase, &lsquo;I  ought to have attended to it myself. Agatha might better have waited.&rsquo; Then he  went out; but I remained till Philemon came home. My brother and myself were no  longer companions; a crime divided us,&mdash;a crime he could not suspect, yet which  made itself felt in both our hearts and prepared him for the revelation made to  him by Mr. Gilchrist some weeks after. That night he came to Sutherlandtown,  where I was, and entered my bedroom&mdash;not in the fraternal way of the old days,  but as an elder enters the presence of a younger. &lsquo;John,&rsquo; he said, without any  preamble or preparation, &lsquo;where are the five thousand dollars you kept back  from Mr. Gilchrist? The memorandum said seven and you delivered to me only two.&rsquo;  There are death-knells sounded in every life; those words sounded mine, or  would have if he had not immediately added: &lsquo;There! I knew you had no stamina.  I have taken your crime on myself, who am really to blame for it, since I  delegated my duty to another, and you will only have to bear the disgrace of  having James Zabel for a brother. In exchange, give me the money; it shall be  returned to-morrow. You cannot have disposed of it already. After which, you,  or rather I, will be in the eyes of the world only a thief in intent, not in fact.&rsquo;  Had he only stopped there!&mdash;but he went on: &lsquo;Agatha is lost to me, John. In  return, be to me the brother I always thought you up to the unhappy day the sin  of Achan came between us.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> were lost to him! It was all I  heard. <i>You</i> were lost to him! Then, if  I acknowledged the crime I should not only take up my own burden of disgrace,  but see him restored to his rights over the only woman I had ever loved. The  sacrifice was great and my virtue was not equal to it. I gave him back the  money, but I did not offer to assume the responsibility of my own crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  since?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  what a hard tone she spoke!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have had to see Philemon gradually assume the rights James once enjoyed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo;  she asked,&mdash;she was under violent self-restraint,&mdash;&ldquo;why do you come now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I cast  my eyes at Philemon. He was standing, as before, with his eyes turned away.  There was discouragement in his attitude, mingled with a certain grand  patience. Seeing that he was better able to bear her loss than either you or  myself, I said to her very low, &ldquo;I thought you ought to know the truth before  you gave your final word. I am late, but I would have been <i>too late</i> a week from now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  hand fell from the door, but her eyes remained fixed on my face.
    Never have I sustained such a look; never will I encounter such another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is too late <i>now</i>,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;The  clergyman has just gone who united me to Philemon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  next minute her back was towards me; she had faced her father and her new-made  husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,  you knew this thing!&rdquo; Keen, sharp, incisive, the words rang out. &ldquo;I saw it in  your face when he began to speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gilchrist drooped slightly; he was a very sick man and the scene had been a  trying one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I did,&rdquo; was his low response, &ldquo;it was but lately. You were engaged then to  Philemon. Why break up this second match?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  eyed him as if she found it difficult to credit her ears. Such indifference to  the claims of innocence was incredible to her. I saw her grand profile quiver,  then the slow ebbing from her cheek of every drop of blood indignation had  summoned there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you, Philemon?&rdquo; she suggested, with a somewhat softened aspect.&ldquo;You committed this wrong ignorantly. Never having heard of this crime, 
    you could not know on what false grounds I had been separated from
    James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had started to escape, but stopped just beyond the threshold of the door as she  uttered these words. Philemon was not as ignorant as she supposed. This was  evident from his attitude and expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agatha,&rdquo;  he began, but at this first word, and before he could clasp the hands held  helplessly out before her, she gave a great cry, and staggering back, eyed both  her father and himself in a frenzy of indignation that was all the more  uncontrollable from the superhuman effort which she had hitherto made to  suppress it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  too!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;You too! and I have just sworn to love, honour, and obey  you! Love <i>you!</i> Honour <i>you!</i> the unconscionable wretch who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  here Mr. Gilchrist rose. Weak, tottering, quivering with something more than  anger, he approached his daughter and laid his finger on her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  quiet!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Philemon is not to blame. A month ago he came to me and  prayed that as a relief to his mind I would tell him why you had separated  yourself from James. He had always thought the match had fallen through on  account of some foolish quarrel or incompatibility, but lately he had feared  there was something more than he suspected in this break, something that he  should know. So I told him why you had dismissed James; and whether he knew  James better than we did, or whether he had seen something in his long  acquaintance with these brothers which influenced his judgment, he said at  once: &lsquo;This cannot be true of James. It is not in his nature to defraud any  man; but John&mdash;I might believe it of John. Isn&rsquo;t there some complication here?&rsquo;  I had never thought of John, and did not see how John could be mixed up with an  affair I had supposed to be a secret between James and myself, but when we came  to locate the day, Philemon remembered that on returning to his room that  night, he had found John awaiting him. As his room was not five doors from that  occupied by Mr. Orr, he was convinced that there was more to this matter than I  had suspected. But when he laid the matter before James, he did not deny that  John was guilty, but was peremptory in wishing you not to be told before your  marriage. He knew that you were engaged to a good man, a man that your father  approved, a man that could and would make you happy. He did not want to be the  means of a second break, and besides, and this, I think, was at the bottom of  the stand he took, for James Zabel was always the proudest man I ever knew,&mdash;he  never could bear, he said, to give to one like Agatha a name which he knew and  she knew was not entirely free from reproach. It would stand in the way of his  happiness and ultimately of hers; his brother&rsquo;s dishonour was his. So while he  still loved you, his only prayer was that after you were safely married and  Philemon was sure of your affection, he should tell you that the man you once  regarded so favourably was not unworthy of that regard. To obey him, Philemon  has kept silent, while I&mdash;Agatha, what are you doing? Are you mad, my child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked so for the moment. Tearing off the ring which she had worn but an hour,  she flung it on the floor. Then she threw her arms high up over her head and  burst out in an awful voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curses  on the father, curses on the husband, who have combined to make me rue the day  I was born! The father I cannot disown, but the husband&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Mr. Gilchrist who dared her fury. Philemon said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  he may be the father of your children. Don&rsquo;t curse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  she only towered the higher and her beauty, from being simply majestic, became  appalling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Children!&rdquo;  she cried. &ldquo;If ever I bear children to this man, may the blight of Heaven  strike them as it has struck me this day. May they die as my hopes have died,  or, if they live, may they bruise his heart as mine is bruised, and curse their  father as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  I fled the house. I was shaking as if this awful denunciation had fallen on my  own head. But before the door closed behind me, a different cry called me back.  Mr. Gilchrist was lying lifeless on the floor, and Philemon, the patient,  tender Philemon, had taken Agatha to his breast and was soothing her there as  if the words she had showered upon him had been blessings instead of the most  fearful curses which had ever left the lips of mortal woman.</p>
  <p>The  next letter was in Agatha&rsquo;s handwriting. It was dated some months later and was  stained and crumpled more than any other in the whole packet. Could Philemon  once have told why? Were these blotted lines the result of his tears falling  fast upon them, tears of forty years ago, when he and she were young and love  had been doubtful? Was the sheet so yellowed and so seamed because it had been  worn on his breast and folded and unfolded so often? Philemon, thou art in thy  grave, sleeping sweetly at last by thy deeply idolised one, but these marks of  feeling still remain indissolubly connected with the words that gave them  birth.</p>
  <p>Dear Philemon:<br>
    You are gone for a day and a night only,  but it seems a lengthened absence to me, meriting a little letter. You have  been so good to me, Philemon, ever since that dreadful hour following our  marriage, that sometimes&mdash;I hardly dare yet to say always&mdash;I feel that I am  beginning to love you and that God did not deal with me so harshly when He cast  me into your arms. Yesterday I tried to tell you this when you almost kissed me  at parting. But I was afraid it was a momentary sentimentality and so kept  still. But to-day such a warm well-spring of joy rises in my heart when I think  that to-morrow the house will be bright again, and that in place of the empty  wall opposite me at table I shall see your kindly and forbearing face, I know  that the heart I had thought impregnable has begun to yield, and that daily  gentleness, and a boundless consideration from one who had excuse for bitter  thoughts and recrimination, are doing what all of us thought impossible a few  short months ago.</p>
  <p>Oh,  I am so happy, Philemon, so happy to love where it is now my duty to love; and  if it were not for that dreadful memory of a father dying with harsh words in  his ears, and the knowledge that you, my husband, yet not my husband, are  bearing ever about with you echoes of words that in another nature would have  turned tenderness into gall, I could be merry also and sing as I go about the  house making it pleasant and comfortable against your speedy return. As it is I  can but lay my hand softly on my heart as its beatings grow too impetuous and  say, &ldquo;God bless my absent Philemon and help him to forgive me! I forgive him  and love him as I never thought I could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  you may see that these are not the weak outpourings of a lonely woman, I will  here write that I heard to-day that John and James Zabel have gone into  partnership in the ship-building business, John&rsquo;s uncle having left him a  legacy of several thousand dollars. I hope they will do well. James, they say,  is full of business and is, to all appearance, perfectly cheerful. This  relieves me from too much worry in his regard. God certainly knew what kind of  a husband I needed. May you find yourself equally blessed in your wife.</p>
  <p>Another  letter to Philemon, a year later:</p>
  <p>Dear Philemon:<br>
    Hasten home, Philemon; I do not like these  absences. I am just now too weak and fearful. Since we knew the great hope  before us, I have looked often in your face for a sign that you remembered what  this hope cannot but recall to my shuddering memory. Philemon, Philemon, was I  mad? When I think what I said in my rage, and then feel the little life  stirring about my heart, I wonder that God did not strike me dead rather than  bestow upon me the greatest blessing that can come to woman. Philemon,  Philemon, if anything should happen to the child! I think of it by day, I think  of it by night. I know you think of it too, though you show me such a cheerful  countenance and make such great plans for the future. &ldquo;Will God remember my  words, or will He forget? It seems as if my reason hung upon this question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  note this time in answer to one from John Zabel:</p>
  <p>Dear John:<br>
    Thank you for words which could have come  from nobody else. My child is dead. Could I expect anything different? If I  did, God has rebuked me.</p>
  <p>Philemon  thinks only of me. We understand each other so perfectly now that our greatest  suffering comes in seeing each other&rsquo;s pain. My load I can bear, but <i>his</i>&mdash;Come and see me, John; and tell  James our house is open to him. We have all done wrong, and are caught in one  net of misfortune. Let it make us friends again.</p>
  <p>Below  this in Philemon&rsquo;s hand:</p>
  <p>My  wife is superstitious. Strong and capable as she is, she has regarded this  sudden taking off of our first-born as a sign that certain words uttered by her  on her marriage day, unhappily known to you and, as I take it, to James also,  have been remembered by the righteous God above us. This is a weakness which I  cannot combat. Can you, who alone of all the world beside know both it and its  cause, help me by a renewed friendship, whose cheerful and natural character  may gradually make her forget? If so, come like old neighbours, and dine with  us on our wedding day. If God sees that we have buried the past and are ready  to forgive each other the faults of our youth, perhaps He will further spare  this good woman. I think she will be able to bear it. She has great strength  except where a little child is concerned. That alone can henceforth stir the  deepest recesses of her heart.</p>
  <p>After  this, a gap of years. One, two, three, four, five children were laid away to  rest in Portchester churchyard, then Philemon and she came to Sutherlandtown;  but not till after a certain event had occurred, best made known by this last  letter to Philemon:</p>
<p>Dearest Husband:<b><br>
  </b>Our babe is born, our sixth and our  dearest, and the reproach of its first look had to be met by me alone. Oh, why  did I leave you and come to this great Boston where I have no friend but Mrs.  Sutherland? Did I think I could break the spell of fate or providence by giving  birth to my last darling among strangers? I shall have to do something more  than that if I would save this child to our old age. It is borne in upon me  like fate that never will a child prosper at my breast or survive the clasp of  my arms. If it is to live it must be reared by others. Some woman who has not  brought down the curse of Heaven upon her by her own blasphemies must nourish  the tender frame and receive the blessing of its growing love. Neither I nor  you can hope to see recognition in our babe&rsquo;s eye. Before it can turn upon us  with love, it will close in its last sleep and we will be left desolate. What  shall we do, then, with this little son? To whose guardianship can we entrust  it? Do you know a man good enough or a woman sufficiently tender? I do not, but  if God wills that our little Frederick should live, He <i>will</i> raise up someone. By the pang of possible separation already  tearing my heart, I believe that He <i>will</i> raise up someone. Meanwhile I do not  dare to kiss the child, lest I should blight it. He is so sturdy, Philemon, so  different from all the other five.</p>
  <p>I  open this to add that Mrs. Sutherland has just been in&mdash;with her five-weeks-old  infant. His father is away, too, and has not yet seen his boy; and this is  their first after ten years of marriage. Oh, that my future opened before me as  brightly as hers!</p>
  <p>The  next letter opens with a cry:</p>
  <p>Philemon!  Come to me, Philemon! I have done what I threatened. I have made the sacrifice.  Our child is no longer ours, and now, perhaps, he may live. But oh, my breaking  heart! my empty arms! Help me to bear my desolation, for it is for life. We  will never have another child.</p>
  <p>And  where is it? Ah, that is the wonder of it. Near you, Philemon, yet not too  near. Mrs. Sutherland has it, and you may have seen its little face through the  car window if you were in the station last night when the express passed  through to Sutherlandtown. Ah! but she has her burden to bear too. An awful,  secret burden like my own, only she will have the child&mdash;for, Philemon, she has  taken it in lieu of her own, which died last night in my sight; and Mr.  Sutherland does not know what she has done, and never will, if you keep the  secret as I shall, for the sake of the life our little innocent has thus won.</p>
  <p>What  do I mean and how was it all? Philemon, it was God&rsquo;s work, all but the deception,  and that is for the good of all, and to save four broken hearts. Listen.  Yesterday, only yesterday,&mdash;it seems a month ago,&mdash;Mrs. Sutherland came again to  see me with her baby in her arms. Mr. Sutherland is expected home, as you know,  this week, and she was about to start out for Sutherlandtown so as to be in her  own house when he came. The baby was looking well and she was the happiest of  women; for the one wish of his heart and hers had been fulfilled and she was  soon going to have the bliss of showing the child to his father. My own babe  was on the bed asleep, and I, who am feeling wonderfully strong, was sitting up  in a little chair as far away from him as possible, not out of hatred or  indifference&mdash;oh, no!&mdash;but because he seemed to rest better when left entirely by  himself and not under the hungry look of my eye. Mrs. Sutherland went over to  look at it. &ldquo;Oh, he is fair like my baby,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and almost as sturdy,  though mine is a month older.&rdquo; And she stooped down and kissed him. Philemon,  he smiled for her, though he never had for me. I saw it with a greedy longing  that almost made me cry out. Then I turned to her and we talked.</p>
  <p>Of  what? I cannot remember now. At home we had never been intimate friends. She is  from Sutherlandtown and I am from Portchester, and the distance of nine miles  is enough to estrange people. But here, each with a husband absent and a  darling infant lying asleep under our eyes, interests we have never thought  identical drew us to one another and we chatted with ever-increasing pleasure&mdash;when  suddenly Mrs. Sutherland jumped up in a terrible fright. The infant she had  been rocking on her breast was blue; the next minute it shuddered; the next&mdash;it  lay in her arms <i>dead</i>!</p>
  <p>I  hear the shriek yet with which she fell with it still in her arms to the floor.  Fortunately no other ears were open to her cry. I alone saw her misery. I alone  heard her tale. The child had been poisoned, Philemon, poisoned by her. She had  mistaken a cup of medicine for a cup of water and had given the child a few drops  in a spoon just before setting out from her hotel. She had not known at the  time what she had done, but now she remembered that the fatal cup was just like  the other and that the two stood very near together. Oh, her innocent child,  and oh, her husband!</p>
  <p>It  seemed as if the latter thought would drive her wild. &ldquo;He has so wished for a  child,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;We have been married ten years and this baby seemed to  have been sent from heaven. He will curse me, he will hate me, he will never be  able after this to bear me in his sight.&rdquo; This was not true of Mr. Sutherland,  but it was useless to argue with her. Instead of attempting it, I took another  way to stop her ravings. Lifting the child out of her hands, I first listened  at its heart, and then, finding it was really dead,&mdash;Philemon, I have seen too  many lifeless children not to know,&mdash;I began slowly to undress it. &ldquo;What are you  doing?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Mrs. Webb, Mrs. Webb, what are you doing?&rdquo; For reply I  pointed to the bed, where two little arms could be seen feebly fluttering. &ldquo;You  shall have my child,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;I have carried too many babies to the tomb  to dare risk bringing up another.&rdquo; And catching her poor wandering spirit with  my eye, I held her while I told her my story.</p>
  <p>Philemon,  I saved that woman. Before I had finished speaking I saw the reason return to  her eye and the dawning of a pitiful hope in her passion-drawn face. She looked  at the child in my arms and then she looked at the one in the bed, and the  long-drawn sigh with which she finally bent down and wept over our darling told  me that my cause was won. The rest was easy. When the clothes of the two  children had been exchanged, she took our baby in her arms and prepared to  leave. Then I stopped her. &ldquo;Swear,&rdquo; I cried, holding her by the arm and lifting  my other hand to heaven, &ldquo;swear you will be a mother to this child! Swear you  will love it as your own and rear it in the paths of truth and righteousness!&rdquo;  The convulsive clasp with which she drew the baby to her breast assured me more  than her shuddering &ldquo;I swear!&rdquo; that her heart had already opened to it. I  dropped her arm and covered my face with my hands. I could not see my darling  go; it was worse than death&mdash;for the moment it was worse than death. &ldquo;O God,  save him!&rdquo; I groaned. &ldquo;God, make him an honour&mdash;&rdquo; But here she caught me by the  arm. Her clutch was frenzied, her teeth were chattering. &ldquo;Swear in your turn!&rdquo;  she gasped. &ldquo;Swear that if I do a mother&rsquo;s duty by this boy, you will keep my  secret and never, never reveal to my husband, to the boy, or to the world that  you have any claims upon him!&rdquo; It was like tearing the heart from my breast  with my own hand, but I swore, Philemon, and she in her turn drew back. But  suddenly she faced me again, terror and doubt in all her looks. &ldquo;Your husband!&rdquo;  she whispered. &ldquo;Can you keep such a secret from him? You will breathe it in  your dreams.&rdquo; &ldquo;I shall tell him,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Tell him!&rdquo; The hair seemed to  rise on her forehead and she shook so that I feared she would drop the babe. &ldquo;Be  careful!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;See! you frighten the babe. My husband has but one heart  with me. What I do he will subscribe to. Do not fear Philemon.&rdquo; So I promised  in your name. Gradually she grew calmer. When I saw she was steady again, I  motioned her to go. Even my more than mortal strength was failing, and the  baby&mdash;Philemon, I had never kissed it and I did not kiss it then. I heard her  feet draw slowly towards the door, I heard her hand fall on the knob, heard it  turn, uttered one cry, and then&mdash;</p>
  <p>They  found me an hour after, lying along the floor, clasping the dead infant in my  arms. I was in a swoon, and they all think I fell with the child, as perhaps I  did, and that its little life went out during my insensibility. Of its  features, like and yet unlike our boy&rsquo;s, no one seems to take heed. The nurse  who cared for it is gone, and who else would know that little face but me? They  are very good to me, and are full of self-reproaches for leaving me so long in  my part of the building alone. But though they watch me now, I have contrived  to write this letter, which you will get with the one telling of the baby&rsquo;s  death and my own dangerous condition. Destroy it, Philemon, and then COME.  Nothing in all the world will give me comfort but your hand laid under my head  and your true eyes looking into mine. Ah, we must love each other now, and live  humbly! All our woe has come from my early girlish delight in gay and elegant  things. From this day on I eschew all vanities and find in your affection alone  the solace which Heaven will not deny to our bewildered hearts. Perhaps in this  way the blessing that has been denied us will be visited on our child, who will  live. I am now sure, to be the delight of our hearts and the pride of our eyes,  even though we are denied the bliss of his presence and affection.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Sutherland was not seen to enter or go out of my rooms. Being on her way to the  depot, she kept on her way, and must be now in her own home. Her secret is  safe, but ours&mdash;oh, you will help me to preserve it! Help me not to betray&mdash;tell  them I have lost five babies before this one&mdash;delirious&mdash;there may be an  inquest&mdash;she must not be mentioned&mdash;let all the blame fall on me if there is  blame&mdash;I fell&mdash;there is a bruise on the baby&rsquo;s forehead&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I am growing  incoherent&mdash;I will try and direct this and then love&mdash;love&mdash;O God!</p>
  <p>[A  scrawl for the name.]</p>
  <p>Under  it these words:</p>
  <p>Though  bidden to destroy this, I have never dared to do so. Some day it may be of  inestimable value to us or our boy. PHILEMON WEBB.</p>
  <p>This  was the last letter found in the first packet. As it was laid down, sobs were  heard all over the room, and Frederick, who for some time now had been sitting  with his head in his hands, ventured to look up and say: &ldquo;Do you wonder that I  endeavoured to keep this secret, bought at such a price and sealed by the death  of her I thought my mother and of her who really was? Gentlemen, Mr. Sutherland  loved his wife and honoured her memory. To tell him, as I shall have to within  the hour, that the child she placed in his arms twenty-five years ago was an  alien, and that all his love, his care, his disappointment, and his sufferings  had been lavished on the son of a neighbour, required greater courage than to  face doubt on the faces of my fellow-townsmen, or anything, in short, but  absolute arraignment on the charge of murder. Hence my silence, hence my  indecision, till this woman&rdquo;&mdash;here he pointed a scornful finger at Amabel, now  shrinking in her chair&mdash;&ldquo;drove me to it by secretly threatening me with a  testimony which would have made me the murderer of my mother and the lasting  disgrace of a good man who alone has been without blame from the beginning to  the end of this desperate affair. She was about to speak when I forestalled  her. My punishment, if I deserve such, will be to sit and hear in your presence  the reading of the letters still remaining in the coroner&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These  letters were certain ones written by Agatha to her unacknowledged son. They had  never been sent. The first one dated from his earliest infancy, and its simple  and touching hopefulness sent a thrill through every heart. It read as follows:</p>
  <p>Three  years old, my darling! and the health flush has not faded from your cheek nor  the bright gold from your hair.</p>
  <p>Oh,  how I bless Mrs. Sutherland that she did not rebuke me when your father and I  came to Sutherlandtown and set up our home where I could at least see your  merry form toddling through the streets, holding on to the hand of her who now  claims your love. My darling, my pride, my angel, so near and yet so far  removed, will you ever know, even in the heaven to which we all look for joy  after our weary pilgrimage is over, how often in this troublous world, and in  these days of your early infancy, I have crept out of my warm bed, dressed  myself, and, without a word to your father, whose heart it would break, gone out  and climbed the steep hillside just to look at the window of your room to see  if it were light or dark and you awake or sleeping? To breathe the scent of the  eglantine which climbs up to your nursery window, I have braved the night-damps  and the watching eyes of Heaven; but you have a child&rsquo;s blissful ignorance of  all this; you only grow and grow and live, my darling, <i>live</i>!&mdash;which is the only  boon I crave, the only recompense I ask.</p>
  <p>Have  I but added another sin to my account and brought a worse vengeance on myself  than that of seeing you die in your early infancy? Frederick, my son, my son, I  heard you swear to-day! Not lightly, thoughtlessly, as boys sometimes will in  imitation of their elders, but bitterly, revengefully, as if the seeds of evil  passions were already pushing to life in the boyish breast I thought so  innocent. Did you wonder at the strange woman who stopped you? Did you realise  the awful woe from which my commonplace words sprang? No, no, what grown mind  could take that in, least of all a child&rsquo;s? To have forsworn the bliss of  motherhood and entered upon a life of deception for <i>this!</i> Truly Heaven is implacable and my last sin is to be punished  more inexorably than my first.</p>
  <p>There  are worse evils than death. This I have always heard, but now I know it. God  was merciful when He slew my babes, and I, presumptous in my rebellion, and the  efforts with which I tried to prevent His work. Frederick, you are weak,  dissipated, and without conscience. The darling babe, the beautiful child, has  grown into a reckless youth whose impulses Mr. Sutherland will find it hard to  restrain, and over whom his mother&mdash;do <i>I</i> call her your mother?&mdash;has little  influence, though she tries hard to do a mother&rsquo;s part and save herself and  myself from boundless regret. My boy, my boy, do you feel the lack of your own  mother&rsquo;s vigour? Might you have lived under my care and owned a better  restraint and learned to work and live a respectable life in circumstances less  provocative of self-indulgence? Such questions, when they rise, are maddening.  When I see them form themselves in Philemon&rsquo;s eyes I drive them out with all  the force of my influence, which is still strong over him. But when they make  way in my own breast, I can find no relief, not even in prayer. Frederick, were  I to tell you the truth about your parentage, would the shock of such an  unexpected revelation make a man of you? I have been tempted to make the trial,  at times. Deep down in my heart I have thought that perhaps I should best serve  the good man who is growing grey under your waywardness, by opening up before  you the past and present agonies of which you are the unconscious centre. But I  cannot do this while <i>she</i> lives. The  look she gave me one day when I approached you a step too near at the church  door, proves that it would be the killing of her to reveal her long-preserved  secret now. I must wait her death, which seems near, and then&mdash;</p>
  <p>No,  I cannot do it. Mr. Sutherland has but one staff to lean on, and that is you.  It may be a poor one, a breaking one, but it is still a staff. I dare not take  it away&mdash;I dare not. Ah, if Philemon was the man he was once, he might counsel  me, but he is only a child now; just as if God had heard my cry for children  and had given me&mdash;<i>him</i>.</p>
  <p>More  money, and still more money! and I hate it except for what it will do for the  poor and incapable about me. How strange are the ways of Providence! To us who  have no need of aught beyond a competence, money pours in almost against our  will, while to those who long and labour for it, it comes not, or comes so  slowly the life wears out in the waiting and the working. The Zabels, now! Once  well-to-do ship-builders, with a good business and a home full of curious works  of art, they now appear to find it hard to obtain even the necessities of life.  Such are the freaks of fortune; or should I say, the dealings of an inscrutable  Providence? Once I tried to give something out of my abundance to these old  friends, but their pride stood in the way and the attempt failed. Worse than  that. As if to show that benefits should proceed from them to me rather than  from me to them, James bestowed on me a gift. It is a strange one,&mdash;nothing more  nor less than a quaint Florentine dagger which I had often admired for its  exquisite workmanship. Was it the last treasure he possessed? I am almost  afraid so. At all events it shall lie here in my table-drawer where I alone can  see it. Such sights are not good for Philemon. He must have cheerful objects  before him, happy faces such as mine tries to be. But ah!</p>
  <p>I  would gladly give my life if I could once hold you in my arms, my erring but  beloved son. Will the day ever come when I can? Will you have strength enough  to hear my story and preserve your peace and let me go down to the grave with  the memory of one look, one smile, that is for me alone? Sometimes I foresee  this hour and am happy for a few short minutes; and then some fresh story of  your recklessness is wafted through the town and&mdash;</p>
  <p>What stopped her at this point  we shall never know. Some want of Philemon&rsquo;s, perhaps. At all events she left  off here and the letter was never resumed. It was the last secret outpouring of  her heart. With this broken sentence Agatha&rsquo;s letters terminated..</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>That  afternoon, before the inquiry broke up, the jury brought in their verdict. It was:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death  by means of a wound inflicted upon herself in a moment of terror and  misapprehension.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was all his fellow-townsmen could do for Frederick.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_33"></a>Chapter 33<br>
    Father And Son</b></h2>
  <p>But  Frederick&rsquo;s day of trial was not yet over. There was a closed door to open and  a father to see (as in his heart he still called Mr. Sutherland). Then there  were friends to face, and foes, under conditions he better than anyone else,  knew were in some regards made worse rather than better by the admissions and  revelations of this eventful day&mdash;Agnes, for instance. How could he meet her  pure gaze? But it was his father he must first confront, his father to whom he  would have to repeat in private the tale which robbed the best of men of a  past, and took from him a son, almost a wife, without leaving him one memory  calculated to console him. Frederick was so absorbed in this anticipation that  he scarcely noticed the two or three timid hands stretched out in encouragement  toward him, and was moving slowly toward the door behind which his father had  disappeared so many hours before, when he was recalled to the interests of the  moment by a single word, uttered not very far from him. It was simply, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  But it was uttered by Knapp and repeated by Mr. Courtney.</p>
  <p>Frederick  shuddered, and was hurrying on when he found himself stopped by a piteous  figure that, with appealing eyes and timid gestures, stepped up before him. It  was Amabel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive!&rdquo;  she murmured, looking like a pleading saint. &ldquo;I did not know&mdash;I never  dreamed&mdash;you were so much of a man, Frederick: that you bore such a heart,  cherished such griefs, were so worthy of love and a woman&rsquo;s admiration. If I  had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  expression was eloquent, more eloquent than he had ever seen it, for it had  real feeling in it; but he put her coldly by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  my father&rsquo;s white hairs become black again, and the story of my shame is  forgotten in this never-forgetting world, then come back and I will forgive  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  he was passing on when another touch detained him. He turned, this time in some  impatience, only to meet the frank eyes of Sweetwater. As he knew very little  of this young man, save that he was the amateur detective who had by some folly  of his own been carried off on the <i>Hesper</i>,  and who was probably the only man saved from its wreck, he was about to greet  him with some commonplace phrase of congratulation, when Sweetwater interrupted  him with the following words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only wanted to say that it may be easier for you to approach your father with  the revelations you are about to make if you knew that in his present frame of  mind he is much more likely to be relieved by such proofs of innocence as you  can give him than overwhelmed by such as show the lack of kinship between you.  For two weeks Mr. Sutherland has been bending under the belief of your personal  criminality in this matter. This was his secret, which was shared by me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  by me! I am more closely linked to this affair than you can readily imagine.  Some day I may be able to explain myself, but not now. Only remember what I  have said about your father&mdash;pardon me, I should perhaps say Mr. Sutherland&mdash;and  act accordingly. Perhaps it was to tell you this that I was forced back here  against my will by the strangest series of events that ever happened to a man.  But,&rdquo; he added, with a sidelong look at the group of men still hovering about  the coroner&rsquo;s table, &ldquo;I had rather think it was for some more important office  still. But this the future will show,&mdash;the future which I seem to see lowering  in the faces over there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And,  waiting for no reply, he melted into the crowd.</p>
  <p>Frederick  passed at once to his father.</p>
  <p>No  one interrupted them during this solemn interview, but the large crowd that in  the halls and on the steps of the building awaited Frederick&rsquo;s reappearance  showed that the public interest was still warm in a matter affecting so deeply  the heart and interests of their best citizen. When, therefore, that  long-closed door finally opened and Frederick was seen escorting Mr. Sutherland  on his arm, the tide of feeling which had not yet subsided since Agatha&rsquo;s  letters were read vented itself in one great sob of relief. For Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s  face was calmer than when they had last seen it, and his step more assured, and  he leaned, or made himself lean, on Frederick&rsquo;s arm, as if to impress upon all  who saw them that the ties of years cannot be shaken off so easily, and that he  still looked upon Frederick as his son.</p>
  <p>But  he was not contented with this dumb show, eloquent as it was. As the crowd  parted and these two imposing figures took their way down the steps to the  carriage which had been sent for them, Mr. Sutherland cast one deep and long  glance about him on faces he knew and on faces he did not know, on those who  were near and those who were far, and raising his voice, which did not tremble  as much as might have been expected, said deliberately:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  son accompanies me to his home. If he should afterwards be wanted, he will be  found at his own fireside. Good-day, my friends. I thank you for the goodwill  you have this day shown us both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  he entered the carriage.</p>
  <p>The  solemn way in which Frederick bared his head in acknowledgment of this public  recognition of the hold he still retained on this one faithful heart, struck  awe into the hearts of all who saw it. So that the carriage rolled off in silence,  closing one of the most thrilling and impressive scenes ever witnessed in that  time-worn village.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_34"></a>Chapter 34<br>
  &ldquo;Not When They Are Young Girls&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>But,  alas! all tides have their ebb as well as flow, and before Mr. Sutherland and  Frederick were well out of the main street the latter became aware that  notwithstanding the respect with which his explanations had been received by  the jury, there were many of his fellow-townsmen who were ready to show  dissatisfaction at his being allowed to return in freedom to that home where he  had still every prospect of being called the young master. Doubt, that seed of  ramifying growth, had been planted in more than one breast, and while it failed  as yet to break out into any open manifestation, there were evidences enough in  the very restraint visible in such groups of people as they passed that  suspicion had not been suppressed or his innocence established by the  over-favourable verdict of the coroner&rsquo;s jury.</p>
  <p>To  Mr. Sutherland, suffering now from the reaction following all great efforts,  much, if not all, of this quiet but significant display of public feeling  passed unnoticed. But to Frederick, alive to the least look, the least sign  that his story had not been accepted unquestioned, this passage through the  town was the occasion of the most poignant suffering.</p>
  <p>For  not only did these marks of public suspicion bespeak possible arraignment in  the future, but through them it became evident that even if he escaped open  condemnation in the courts, he could never hope for complete reinstatement  before the world, nor, what was to him a still deeper source of despair,  anticipate a day when Agnes&rsquo;s love should make amends to him for the grief and  errors of his more than wayward youth. He could never marry so pure a being  while the shadow of crime separated him from the mass of human beings. Her  belief in his innocence and the exact truth of his story (and he was confident  she did believe him) could make no difference in this conclusion. While he was  regarded openly or in dark corners or beside the humblest fireside as a  possible criminal, neither Mr. Sutherland nor her father, nor his own heart  even, would allow him to offer her anything but a friend&rsquo;s gratitude, or win  from her anything but a neighbour&rsquo;s sympathy; yet in bidding good-bye to larger  hopes and more importunate desires, he parted with the better part of his heart  and the only solace remaining in this world for the boundless griefs and tragic  experiences of his still young life. He had learned to love through suffering,  only to realise that the very nature of his suffering forbade him to indulge in  love.</p>
  <p>And  this seemed a final judgment, even in this hour of public justification. He had  told his story and been for the moment believed, but what was there in his  life, what was there in the facts as witnessed by others, what was there in his  mother&rsquo;s letters and the revelation of their secret relationship, to  corroborate his assertions, or to prove that her hand and not his had held the  weapon when the life-blood gushed from her devoted breast? Nothing, nothing;  only his word to stand against all human probabilities and natural inference;  only his word and the generous nature of the great-hearted woman who had thus  perished! Though a dozen of his fellow-citizens had by their verdict professed  their belief in his word and given him the benefit of a doubt involving his  life as well as his honour, he, as well as they, knew that neither the police  nor the general public were given to sentimentality, and that the question of  his guilt still lay open and must remain so till his dying day. For from the  nature of things no proof of the truth was probable. Batsy being dead, only God  and his own heart could know that the facts of that awful half-hour were as he  had told them.</p>
  <p>Had  God in His justice removed in this striking way his only witness, as a  punishment for his sins and his mad indulgence in acts so little short of crime  as to partake of its guilt and merit its obloquy?</p>
  <p>He  was asking himself this question as he bent to fasten the gate. His father had  passed in, the carriage had driven off, and the road was almost solitary&mdash;but  not quite. As he leaned his arm over the gate and turned to take a final glance  down the hillside, he saw, with what feelings no one will ever know, the light figure  of Agnes advancing on the arm of her father.</p>
  <p>He  would have drawn back, but a better impulse intervened and he stood his ground.  Mr. Halliday, who walked very close to Agnes, cast her an admonitory glance  which Frederick was not slow in interpreting, then stopped reluctantly, perhaps  because he saw her falter, perhaps because he knew that an interview between  these two was unavoidable and had best be quickly over.</p>
  <p>Frederick  found his voice first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;I am glad of this opportunity for expressing my gratitude. You have  acted like a friend and have earned my eternal consideration, even if we never  speak again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a momentary silence. Her head, which had drooped under his greeting, rose  again. Her eyes, humid with feeling, sought his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you speak like that?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we meet? Does not everyone  recognise your innocence, and will not the whole world soon see, as I have,  that you have left the old life behind and have only to be your new self to win  everyone&rsquo;s regard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes,&rdquo;  returned Frederick, smiling sadly as he observed the sudden alarm visible in  her father&rsquo;s face at these enthusiastic words, &ldquo;you know me perhaps better than  others do and are prepared to believe my words and my more than unhappy story.  But there are few like you in the world. People in general will not acquit me,  and if there was only one person who doubted&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Halliday began to look  relieved&mdash;&ldquo;I would fail to give any promise of the new life you hope to see me  lead, if I allowed the shadow under which I undoubtedly rest to fall in the  remotest way across yours. You and I have been friends and will continue such,  but we will hold little intercourse in future, hard as I find it to say so.  Does not Mr. Halliday consider this right? As your father he must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes&rsquo;s  eyes, leaving Frederick&rsquo;s for a moment, sought her father&rsquo;s. Alas! there was no  mistaking their language. Sighing deeply, she again hung her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  much care for people&rsquo;s opinion,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and too little for what is best  and noblest in us. I do not recognise the necessity of a farewell between us  any more than I recognise that anyone who saw and heard you to-day can believe  in your guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  there are so many who did not hear and see me. Besides&rdquo; (here he turned a  little and pointed to the garden in his rear), &ldquo;for the past week a man&mdash;I need  not state who, nor under what authority he acts&mdash;has been in hiding under that  arbour, watching my every movement, and almost counting my sighs. Yesterday he  left for a short space, but to-day he is back. What does that argue, dear  friend? Innocence, completely recognised, does not call for such guardianship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  slight frame of the young girl bending so innocently toward him shuddered  involuntarily at this, and her eyes, frightened and flashing, swept over the  arbour before returning to his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  there is a watcher there, and if such a fact proves you to be in danger of  arrest for a crime you never committed, then it behooves your friends to show  where they stand in this matter, and by lending their sympathy give you courage  and power to meet the trials before you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  when they are young girls,&rdquo; murmured Frederick, and casting a glance at Mr.  Halliday, he stepped softly back.</p>
  <p>Agnes  flushed and yielded to her father&rsquo;s gentle pressure. &ldquo;Good-bye, my friend,&rdquo; she  said, the quiver in her tones sinking deep into Frederick&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;Some day it  will be good-morrow,&rdquo; and her head, turned back over her shoulder, took on a  beautiful radiance that fixed itself forever in the hungry heart of him who  watched it disappear. When she was quite gone, a man not the one whom Frederick  had described, as lying in hiding in the arbour, but a different one, in fact,  no other than our old friend the constable&mdash;advanced around the corner of the  house and presented a paper to him.</p>
  <p>It  was the warrant for his arrest on a charge of murder.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_35"></a>Chapter 35<br>
    Sweetwater Pays His Debt At Last To Mr. Sutherland</b></h2>
  <p>Frederick&rsquo;s  arrest had been conducted so quietly that no hint of the matter reached the  village before the next morning. Then the whole town broke into uproar, and  business was not only suspended, but the streets and docks overflowed with  gesticulating men and excited women, carrying on in every corner and across  innumerable doorsteps the endless debate which such an action on the part of  the police necessarily opened.</p>
  <p>But  the most agitated face, though the stillest tongue, was not to be seen in town  that morning, but in a little cottage on an arid hill-slope overlooking the  sea. Here Sweetwater sat and communed with his great monitor, the ocean, and  only from his flashing eye and the firm set of his lips could the mother of  Sweetwater see that the crisis of her son&rsquo;s life was rapidly approaching, and  that on the outcome of this long brooding rested not only his own self-satisfaction,  but the interests of the man most dear to them.</p>
  <p>Suddenly,  from that far horizon upon which Sweetwater&rsquo;s eye rested with a look that was  almost a demand, came an answer that flushed him with a hope as great as it was  unexpected. Bounding to his feet, he confronted his mother with eager eyes and  outstretched hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me money, all the money we have in the house. I have an idea that may be worth  all I can ever make or can ever hope to have. If it succeeds, we save Frederick  Sutherland; if it fails, I have only to meet another of Knapp&rsquo;s scornful looks.  But it won&rsquo;t fail; the inspiration came from the sea, and the sea, you know, is  my second mother!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  this inspiration was he did not say, but it carried him presently into town and  landed him in the telegraph office.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>The  scene later in the day, when Frederick entered the village under the  guardianship of the police, was indescribable. Mr. Sutherland had insisted upon  accompanying him, and when the well-loved figure and white head were  recognised, the throng, which had rapidly collected in the thoroughfare leading  to the depot, succumbed to the feelings occasioned by this devotion, and fell  into a wondering silence.</p>
  <p>Frederick  had never looked better. There is something in the extremity of fate which  brings out a man&rsquo;s best characteristics, and this man, having much that was  good in him, showed it at that moment as never before in his short but  over-eventful life. As the carriage stopped before the court-house on its way  to the train, a glimpse was given of his handsome head to those who had  followed him closest, and as there became visible for the first time in his  face, so altered under his troubles, a likeness to their beautiful and  commanding Agatha, a murmur broke out around him that was half a wail and half  a groan, and which affected him so that he turned from his father, whose hand  he was secretly holding, and taking the whole scene in with one flash of his  eye, was about to speak, when a sudden hubbub broke out in the direction of the  telegraph office, and a man was seen rushing down the street holding a paper  high over his head. It was Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;News!&rdquo;  he cried. &ldquo;News! A cablegram from the Azores! A Swedish sailor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  here a man with more authority than the amateur detective pushed his way to the  carriage and took off his hat to Mr. Sutherland.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but the prisoner will not leave town to-day.  Important evidence has just reached us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sutherland saw that it was in Frederick&rsquo;s favour and fainted on his son&rsquo;s neck.  As the people beheld his head fall forward, and observed the look with which  Frederick received him in his arms, they broke into a great shout.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;News!&rdquo;  they shrieked. &ldquo;News! Frederick Sutherland is innocent! See! the old man has  fainted from joy!&rdquo; And caps went up and tears fell, before a mother&rsquo;s son of  them knew what grounds he had for his enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>Later,  they found they were good and substantial ones. Sweetwater had remembered the  group of sailors who had passed by the corner of Agatha&rsquo;s house just as Batsy  fell forward on the window-sill, and cabling to the captain of the vessel, at  the first port at which they were likely to put in, was fortunate enough to  receive in reply a communication from one of the men, who remembered the words  she shouted. They were in Swedish and none of his mates had understood them,  but he recalled them well. They were:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hjelp!  Hjelp! Frun h&aring;ller p&aring; alb d&ouml;da sig. Hon har en knif. Hjelp!
    Hjelp!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  English:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help!  Help! My mistress kills herself. She has a knife. Help! Help!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  impossible had occurred. Batsy was not dead, or at least her testimony still  remained and had come at Sweetwater&rsquo;s beck from the other side of the sea to  save her mistress&rsquo;s son.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  was a made man. And Frederick? In a week he was the idol of the town. In a  year&mdash;but let Agnes&rsquo;s contented face and happy smile show what he was then.  Sweet Agnes, who first despised, then encouraged, then loved him, and who, next  to Agatha, commanded the open worship of his heart.</p>
  <p>Agatha  is first, must be first, as anyone can see who beholds him, on a certain  anniversary of each year, bury his face in the long grass which covers the  saddest and most passionate heart which ever yielded to the pressure of life&rsquo;s  deepest tragedy.</p>
