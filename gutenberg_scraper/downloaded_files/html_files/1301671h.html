<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THOSE who have discussed the secret of the success
of the great detective, Dr Adrian Hyde, could find no finer example
of his remarkable methods than the affair which came to be called
'The White Pillars Mystery'. But that extraordinary man left no
personal notes and we owe our record of it to his two young
assistants, John Brandon and Walter Weir. Indeed, as will be seen,
it was they who could best describe the first investigations in
detail, from the outside; and that for a rather remarkable reason.
They were both men of exceptional ability; they had fought bravely
and even brilliantly in the Great War, they were cultivated, they
were capable, they were trustworthy, and they were starving. For
such was the reward which England in the hour of victory accorded
to the deliverers of the world. It was a long time before they
consented in desperation to consider anything so remote from their
instincts as employment in a private detective agency. Jack
Brandon, who was a dark, compact, resolute, restless youth, with a
boyish appetite for detective tales and talk, regarded the notion
with a half-fascinated apprehension, but his friend Weir, who was
long and fair and languid, a lover of music and metaphysics, with a
candid disgust.</p>

<p>'I believe it might be frightfully interesting,' said Brandon.
'Haven't you ever had the detective fever when you couldn't help
overhearing somebody say something&mdash;"If only he knew what she
did to the Archdeacon", or "And then the whole business about Susan
and the dog will come out"?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied Weir, 'but you only heard snatches because you
didn't mean to listen and almost immediately left off listening. If
you were a detective, you'd have to crawl under the bed or hide in
the dustbin to hear the whole secret, till your dignity was as
dirty as your clothes!'</p>

<p>'Isn't it better than stealing,' asked Brandon, gloomily, 'which
seems to be the next step?'</p>

<p>'Why, no; I'm not sure that it is!' answered his friend.</p>

<p>Then, after a pause, he added, reflectively, 'Besides, it isn't
as if we'd get the sort of work that's relatively decent. We can't
claim to know the wretched trade. Clumsy eavesdropping must be
worse than the blind spying on the blind. You've not only got to
know what is said, but what is meant. There's a lot of difference
between listening and hearing. I don't say I'm exactly in a
position to fling away a handsome salary offered me by a great
criminologist like Dr Adrian Hyde, but, unfortunately, he isn't
likely to offer it.'</p>

<p>But Dr Adrian Hyde was an unusual person in more ways than one,
and a better judge of applicants than most modern employers. He was
a very tall man with a chin so sunk on his chest as to give him, in
spite of his height, almost a look of being hunchbacked; but though
the face seemed thus fixed as in a frame, the eyes were as active
as a bird's, shifting and darting everywhere and observing
everything; his long limbs ended in large hands and feet, the
former being almost always thrust into his trouser-pockets, and the
latter being loaded with more than appropriately large boots. With
all his awkward figure he was not without gaiety and a taste for
good things, especially good wine and tobacco; his manner was
grimly genial and his insight and personal judgement marvellously
rapid. Which was how it came about that John Brandon and Waiter
Weir were established at comfortable desks in the detective's
private office, when Mr Alfred Morse was shown in, bringing with
him the problem of White Pillars.</p>

<p>Mr Alfred Morse was a very stolid and serious person with
stiffly-brushed brown hair, a heavy brown face and a heavy black
suit of mourning of a cut somewhat provincial, or perhaps colonial.
His first words were accompanied with an inoffensive but dubious
cough and a glance at the two assistants.</p>

<p>'This is rather confidential business.' he said.</p>

<p>'Mr Morse,' said Dr Hyde, with quiet good humour, 'if you were
knocked down by a cab and carried to a hospital, your life might be
saved by the first surgeon in the land: but you couldn't complain
if he let students learn from the operation. These are my two
cleverest pupils, and if you want good detectives, you must let
them be trained.'</p>

<p>'Oh, very well,' said the visitor, 'perhaps it is not quite so
easy to talk of the personal tragedy as if we were alone; but I
think I can lay the main facts before you.</p>

<p>'I am the brother of Melchior Morse, whose dreadful death is so
generally deplored. I need not tell you about him; he was a public
man of more than average public spirit, and I suppose his
benefactions and social work are known throughout the world. I had
not seen so much of him as I could wish till the last few years;
for I have been much abroad; I suppose some would call me the
rolling stone of the family, compared with my brother, but I was
deeply attached to him, and all the resources of the family estate
will be open to anyone ready to avenge his death. You will
understand I shall not lightly abandon that duty.</p>

<p>'The crime occurred, as you probably know, at his country place
called "White Pillars", after its rather unique classical
architecture; a colonnade in the shape of a crescent, like that at
St Peter's, runs halfway round an artificial lake, to which the
descent is by a flight of curved stone steps. It is in the lake
that my brother's body was found floating in the moonlight; but as
his neck was broken, apparently with a blow, he had clearly been
killed elsewhere. When the butler found the body, the moon was on
the other side of the house and threw the inner crescent of the
colonnade and steps into profound shadow. But the butler swears he
saw the figure of the fleeing man in dark outline against the
moonlight as it turned the corner of the house. He says it was a
striking outline, and he would know it again.'</p>

<p>'Those outlines are very vivid sometimes,' said the detective,
thoughtfully, 'but of course very difficult to prove. Were there
any other traces? Any footprints or fingerprints?'</p>

<p>'There were no fingerprints,' said Morse, gravely, 'and the
murderer must have meant to take equal care to leave no footprints.
That is why the crime was probably committed on the great flight of
stone steps. But they say the cleverest murderer forgets something;
and when he threw the body in the lake there must have been a
splash, which was not quite dry when it was discovered; and it
showed the edge of a pretty clear footprint. I have a copy of the
thing here; the original is at home.' He passed a brown slip across
to Hyde, who looked at it and nodded. 'The only other thing on the
stone steps that might be a clue was a cigar-stump. My brother did
not smoke.'</p>

<p>'Well, we will look into those clues more closely in due
course.' said Dr Hyde. 'Now tell me something about the house and
the people in it.'</p>

<p>Mr Morse shrugged his shoulders, as if the family in question
did not impress him.</p>

<p>'There were not many people in it,' he replied, 'putting aside a
fairly large staff of servants, headed by the butler, Barton, who
has been devoted to my brother for years. The servants all bear a
good character; but of course you will consider all that. The other
occupants of the house at the time were my brother's wife, a rather
silent elderly woman, devoted almost entirely to religion and good
works; a niece, of whose prolonged visits the old lady did not
perhaps altogether approve, for Miss Barbara Butler is half Irish
and rather flighty and excitable; my brothers secretary, Mr Graves,
a very silent young man (I confess I could never make out whether
he was shy or sly), and my brother's solicitor, Mr Caxton, who is
an ordinary snuffy lawyer, and happened to be down there on legal
business. They might all be guilty in theory, I suppose, but I'm a
practical man, and I don't imagine such things in practice.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I realised you were a practical man when you first came
in,' said Dr Hyde, rather drily. 'I realised a few other details as
well. Is that all you have to tell me?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied Morse, 'I hope I have made myself clear.'</p>

<p>'It is well not to forget anything,' went on Adrian Hyde, gazing
at him calmly. 'It is still better not to suppress anything, when
confiding in a professional man. You may have heard, perhaps, of a
knack I have of noticing things about people. I knew some of the
things you told me before you opened your mouth; as that you long
lived abroad and had just come up from the country. And it was easy
to infer from your own words that you are the heir of your
brother's considerable fortune.'</p>

<p>'Well, yes, I am,' replied Alfred Morse, stolidly.</p>

<p>'When you said you were a rolling stone,' went on Adrian Hyde,
with the same placid politeness, 'I fear some might say you were a
stone which the builders were justified in rejecting. Your
adventures abroad have not all been happy. I perceive that you
deserted from some foreign navy, and that you were once in prison
for robbing a bank. If it comes to an inquiry into your brother's
death and your present inheritance&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Are you trying to suggest,' cried the other fiercely, 'that
appearances are against me?'</p>

<p>'My dear sir,' said Dr Adrian Hyde blandly, 'appearances are
most damnably against you. But I don't always go by appearances. It
all depends. Good day.'</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p class="first">WHEN the visitor had withdrawn, looking rather
black, the impetuous Brandon broke out into admiration of the
Master's methods and besieged him with questions.</p>

<p>'Look here,' said the great man, good-humouredly, 'you've no
business to be asking how I guessed right. You ought to be guessing
at the guesses yourselves. Think it out.'</p>

<p>'The desertion from a foreign navy,' said Weir, slowly, 'might
be something to do with those bluish marks on his wrist. Perhaps
they were some special tattooing and he'd tried to rub them
out.'</p>

<p>'That's better,' said Dr Hyde, 'you're getting on.'</p>

<p>'I know!' cried Brandon, more excitedly, 'I know about the
prison! They always say, if you once shave your moustache it never
grows the same; perhaps there's something like that about hair
that's been cropped in gaol. Yes, I thought so. The only thing I
can't imagine, is why you should guess he had robbed a bank.'</p>

<p>'Well, you think that out too,' said Adrian Hyde. 'I think
you'll find it's the key to the whole of this riddle. And now I'm
going to leave this case to you. I'm going to have a
half-holiday.'</p>

<p>As a signal that his own working hours were over, he lit a large
and sumptuous cigar, and began pishing and poohing over the
newspapers.</p>

<p>'Lord, what rubbish!' he cried. 'My God, what headlines! Look at
this about White Pillars: "Whose Was the Hand?" They've murdered
even murder with clichés like clubs of wood. Look here, you two
fellows had better go down to White Pillars and try to put some
sense into them. I'll come down later and clear up the mess.'</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p class="first">THE two young detectives had originally intended
to hire a car, but by the end of their journey they were very glad
they had decided to travel by train with the common herd. Even as
they were in the act of leaving the train, they had a stroke of
luck in the matter of that collecting of stray words and whispers
which Weir found the least congenial, but Brandon desperately clung
to as the most practicable, of all forms of detective enquiry. The
steady scream of a steam-whistle, which was covering all the
shouted conversation, stopped suddenly in the fashion that makes a
shout shrivel into a whisper. But there was one whisper caught in
the silence and sounding clear as a bell; a voice that said, 'There
were excellent reasons for killing him. I know them, if nobody else
does.'</p>

<p>Brandon managed to trace the voice to its origin; a sallow face
with a long shaven chin and a rather scornful lower lip. He saw the
same face more than once on the remainder of his journey, passing
the ticket collector, appearing in a car behind them on the road,
haunting him so significantly, that he was not surprised to meet
the man eventually in the garden of White Pillars, and to have him
presented as Mr Claxton, the solicitor.</p>

<p>'That man evidently knows more than he's told the authorities,'
said Brandon to his friend, 'but I can't get anything more out of
him.'</p>

<p>'My dear fellow,' cried Weir, 'that's what they're all like.
Don't you feel by this time that it's the atmosphere of the whole
place? It's not a bit like those delightful detective stories. In a
detective story all the people in the house are gaping imbeciles,
who can't understand anything, and in the midst stands the
brilliant sleuth who understands everything. Here am I standing in
the midst, a brilliant sleuth, and I believe, on my soul, I'm the
only person in the house who doesn't know all about the crime.'</p>

<p>'There's one other anyhow,' said Brandon, with gloom, 'two
brilliant sleuths.'</p>

<p>'Everybody else knows except the detective,' went on Weir;
'everybody knows something, anyhow, if it isn't everything. There's
something odd even about old Mrs Morse; she's devoted to charity,
yet she doesn't seem to have agreed with her husband's
philanthropy. It's as if they'd quarrelled about it. Then there's
the secretary, the quiet, good-looking young man, with a square
face like Napoleon. He looks as if he would get what he wants, and
I've very little doubt that what he wants is that red-haired Irish
girl they call Barbara. I think she wants the same thing; but if so
there's really no reason for them to hide it. And they <i>are</i>
hiding it, or hiding something. Even the butler is secretive. They
can't all have been in a conspiracy to kill the old man.'</p>

<p>'Anyhow, it all comes back to what I said first,' observed
Brandon. 'If they're in a conspiracy, we can only hope to overhear
their talk. It's the only way.'</p>

<p>'It's an excessively beastly way,' said Weir, calmly, 'and we
will proceed to follow it.'</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p class="first">THEY were walking slowly round the great
semicircle of colonnade that looked inwards upon the lake, that
shone like a silver mirror to the moon. It was of the same stretch
of clear moonlit nights as that recent one, on which old Morse had
died mysteriously in the same spot. They could imagine him as he
was in many portraits, a little figure in a skull-cap with a white
beard thrust forward, standing on those steps, till a dreadful
figure that had no face in their dreams descended the stairway and
struck him down. They were standing at one end of the colonnade,
full of these visions, when Brandon said suddenly: 'Did you
speak?'</p>

<p>'I? No,' replied his friend staring.</p>

<p>'Somebody spoke,' said Brandon, in a low voice, 'yet we seem to
be quite alone.'</p>

<p>Then their blood ran cold for an instant. For the wall behind
them spoke; and it seemed to say quite plainly, in a rather harsh
voice: 'Do you remember exactly what you said?'</p>

<p>Weir stared at the wall for an instant; then he slapped it with
his hand with a shaky laugh.</p>

<p>'My God,' he cried, 'what a miracle! And what a satire! We've
sold ourselves to the devil as a couple of damned eavesdroppers;
and he's put us in the very chamber of eavesdropping&mdash;into the
ear of Dionysius, the Tyrant. Don't you see this is a whispering
gallery, and people at the other end of it are whispering?</p>

<p>'No, they're talking too loud to hear us, I think,' whispered
Brandon, 'but we'd better lower our voices. It's Caxton the lawyer,
and the young secretary.'</p>

<p>The secretary's unmistakable and vigorous voice sounded along
the wall saying: 'I told him I was sick of the whole business; and
if I'd known he was such a tyrant, I'd never have had to do with
him. I think I told him he ought to be shot. I was sorry enough for
it afterwards.'</p>

<p>Then they heard the lawyer's more croaking tones saying, 'Oh,
you said that, did you? Well, there seems no more to be said now.
We had better go in,' which was followed by echoing feet and then
silence.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p class="first">THE next day Weir attached himself to the lawyer
with a peculiar pertinacity and made a new effort to get something
more out of that oyster. He was pondering deeply of the very little
that he had got, when Brandon rushed up to him with
hardly-restrained excitement.</p>

<p>'I've been at that place again,' he cried. 'I suppose you'll say
I've sunk lower in the pit of slime, and perhaps I have, but it's
got to be done. I've been listening to the young people this time,
and I believe I begin to see something; though heaven knows, it's
not what I want to see. The secretary and the girl are in love all
right, or have been; and when love is loose pretty dreadful things
can happen. They were talking about getting married, of course, at
least she was, and what do you think she said? "He made an excuse
of my being under age." So it's pretty clear the old man opposed
the match. No doubt that was what the secretary meant by talking
about his tyranny.'</p>

<p>'And what did the secretary say when the girl said that?'</p>

<p>'That's the queer thing,' answered Brandon, 'rather an ugly
thing, I begin to fancy. The young man only answered, rather
sulkily, I thought: "Well, he was within his rights there; and
perhaps it was for the best." She broke out in protest "How can you
say such a thing?" and certainly it was a strange thing for a lover
to say.'</p>

<p>'What are you driving at?' asked his friend.</p>

<p>'Do you know anything about women?' asked Brandon. 'Suppose the
old man was not only trying to break off the engagement but
succeeding in breaking it up. Suppose the young man was weakening
and beginning to wonder whether she was worth losing his job for.
The woman might have waited any time or eloped any time. But if she
thought she was in danger of losing him altogether, don't you think
she might have turned on the tempter with the fury of despair? I
fear we have got a glimpse of a very heart-rending tragedy. Don't
you believe it, too?'</p>

<p>Walter Weir unfolded his long limbs and got slowly to his feet,
filling a pipe and looking at his friend with a sort of quizzical
melancholy.</p>

<p>'No, I don't believe it,' he said, 'but that's because I'm such
an unbeliever. You see, I don't believe in all this eavesdropping
business; I don't think we shine at it. Or, rather, I think you
shine too much at it and dazzle yourself blind. I don't believe in
all this detective romance about deducing everything from a trifle.
I don't believe in your little glimpse of a great tragedy. It would
be a great tragedy no doubt, and does you credit as literature or a
symbol of life; you can build imaginative things of that sort on a
trifle. You can build everything on the trifle except the truth.
But in the present practical issue, I don't believe there's a word
of truth in it. I don't believe the old man was opposed to the
engagement; I don't believe the young man was backing out of it; I
believe the young people are perfectly happy and ready to be
married tomorrow. I don't believe anybody in this house had any
motive to kill Morse or has any notion of how he was killed. In
spite of what I said, the poor shabby old sleuth enjoys his own
again. I believe I am the only person who knows the truth; and it
only came to me in a flash a few minutes ago.'</p>

<p>'Why, how do you mean?' asked the other.</p>

<p>'It came to me in a final flash,' said Weir, 'when you repeated
those words of the girl: "He made the excuse that I was under
age".'</p>

<p>After a few puffs of his pipe, he resumed reflectively: 'One
queer thing is, that the error of the eavesdropper often comes from
a thing being too clear. We're so sure that people mean what we
mean, that we can't believe they mean what they say. Didn't I once
tell you that it's one thing to listen and another to hear? And
sometimes the voice talks too plain. For instance, when young
Graves, the secretary, said that he was sick of the business, he
meant it literally, and not metaphorically. He meant he was sick of
Morse's trade, because it was tyrannical.'</p>

<p>'Morse's trade? What trade?' asked Brandon, staring.</p>

<p>'Our saintly old philanthropist was a money-lender,' replied
Weir, 'and as great a rascal as his rascally brother. That is the
great central fact that explains everything. That is what the girl
meant by talking about being under age. She wasn't talking about
her love-affair at all, but about some small loan she'd tried to
get from the old man and which he refused because she was a minor.
Her fiancé made the very sensible comment that perhaps it was all
for the best; meaning that she had escaped the net of a usurer. And
her momentary protest was only a spirited young lady's lawful
privilege of insisting on her lover agreeing with all the silly
things she says. That is an example of the error of the
eavesdropper, or the fallacy of detection by trifles. But, as I
say, it's the money-lending business that's the clue to everything
in this house. That's what all of them, even the secretary and
solicitor, out of a sort of family pride, are trying to hush up and
hide from detectives and newspapers. But the old man's murder was
much more likely to get it into the newspapers. They had no motive
to murder him, and they didn't murder him.'</p>

<p>'Then who did?' demanded Brandon.</p>

<p>'Ah,' replied his friend, but with less than his usual languor
in the ejaculation and something a little like a hissing intake of
the breath. He had seated himself once more, with his elbows on his
knees, but the other was surprised to realise something rigid about
his new attitude; almost like a creature crouching for a spring. He
still spoke quite drily, however, and merely said: 'In order to
answer that, I fancy we must go back to the first talk that we
overheard, before we came to the house; the very first of all.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I see,' said Brandon, a light dawning on his Face. 'You
mean what we heard the solicitor say in the train.'</p>

<p>'No,' replied Weir, in the same motionless manner, 'that was
only another illustration touching the secret trade. Of course his
solicitor knew he was a money-lender; and knew that any such
money-lender has a crowd of victims, who might kill him. It's quite
true he was killed by one of those victims. But it wasn't the
lawyer's remark in the train that I was talking about, for a very
simple reason.'</p>

<p>'And why not?' enquired his companion.</p>

<p>'Because that was not the first conversation we overheard.'</p>

<p>Walter Weir clutched his knees with his long bony hands, and
seemed to stiffen still more as if in a trance, but he went on
talking steadily.</p>

<p>'I have told you the moral and the burden of all these things;
that it is one thing to hear what men say and another to hear what
they mean. And it was at the very first talk that we heard all the
words and missed all the meaning. We did not overhear that first
talk slinking about in moonlit gardens and whispering-galleries. We
overheard that first talk sitting openly at our regular desks in
broad daylight, in a bright and business-like office. But we no
more made sense of that talk than if it had been half a whisper,
heard in a black forest or a cave.'</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet as if a stiff spring were released and
began striding up and down, with what was for him an unnatural
animation.</p>

<p>'That was the talk we really misunderstood,' he cried. 'That was
the conversation that we heard word for word, and yet missed
entirely! Fools that we were! Deaf and dumb and imbecile, sitting
there like dummies and being stuffed with a stage play! We were
actually allowed to be eavesdroppers, tolerated, ticketed, given
special permits to be eavesdroppers; and still we could not
eavesdrop! I never even guessed till ten minutes ago the meaning of
that conversation in the office. That terrible conversation! That
terrible meaning! Hate and hateful fear and shameless wickedness
and mortal peril&mdash;death and hell wrestled naked before our
eyes in that office, and we never saw them. A man accused another
man of murder across a table, and we never heard it.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' gasped Brandon at last, 'you mean that the Master accused
the brother of murder?'</p>

<p>'No!' retorted Weir, in a voice like a volley, 'I mean that the
brother accused the Master of murder.'</p>

<p>'The Master!'</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered Weir, and his high voice fell suddenly, 'and the
accusation was true. The man who murdered old Morse was our
employer, Dr Adrian Hyde.'</p>

<p>'What can it all mean?' asked Brandon, and thrust his hand
through his thick brown hair.</p>

<p>'That was our mistake at the beginning,' went on the other
calmly, 'that we did not think what it could all mean. Why was the
brother so careful to say the reproduction of the footprint was a
proof and not the original? Why did Dr Hyde say the outline of the
fugitive would be difficult to prove? Why did he tell us, with that
sardonic grin, that the brother having robbed a bank was the key of
the riddle? Because the whole of that consultation of the client
and the specialist was a fiction for our benefit. The whole course
of events was determined by that first thing that happened; that
the young and innocent detectives were allowed to remain in the
room. Didn't you think yourself the interview was a little too like
that at the beginning of every damned detective story? Go over it
speech by speech, and you will see that every speech was a thrust
or parry under a cloak. That blackmailing blackguard Alfred hunted
out Dr Hyde simply to accuse and squeeze him. Seeing us there, he
said, "This is confidential", meaning, "You don't want to be
accused before them." Dr Hyde answered, "They're my favourite
pupils", meaning, "I'm less likely to be blackmailed before them;
they shall stay." Alfred answered, "Well, I can state my business,
if not quite so personally," meaning, "I can accuse you so that you
understand, if they don't."? And he did. He presented his proofs
like pistols across the table; things that sounded rather thin,
but, in Hyde's case, happened to be pretty thick. His boots, for
instance, happened to be very thick. His huge footprint would be
unique enough to be a clue. So would the cigar-end; for very few
people can afford to smoke his cigars. Of course, that's what got
him tangled up with the money-lender&mdash;extravagance. You see
how much money you get through if you smoke those cigars all day
and never drink anything but the best vintage champagne. And though
a black silhouette against the moon sounds as vague as moonshine,
Hyde's huge figure and hunched shoulders would be rather marked.
Well, you know how the blackmailed man hit back: "I perceive by
your left eyebrow that you are a deserter; I deduce from the pimple
on your nose that you were once in gaol," meaning, "I know you, and
you're as much a crook as I am; expose me and I'll expose you."
Then he said he had deduced in the Sherlock Holmes manner that
Alfred had robbed a bank, and that was where he went too far. He
presumed on the incredible credulity, which is the mark of the
modern mind when anyone has uttered the magic word "science". He
presumed on the priestcraft of our time; but he presumed the least
little bit too much, so far as I was concerned. It was then I first
began to doubt. A man might possibly deduce by scientific detection
that another man had been in a certain navy or prison, but by no
possibility could he deduce from a man's appearance that what he
had once robbed was a bank. It was simply impossible. Dr Hyde knew
it was his biggest bluff; that was why he told you in mockery, that
it was the key to the riddle. It was; and I managed to get hold of
the key.'</p>

<p>He chuckled in a hollow fashion as he laid down his pipe. 'That
jibe at his own bluff was like him; he really is a remarkable man
or a remarkable devil. He has a sort of horrible sense of humour.
Do you know, I've got a notion that sounds rather a nightmare,
about what happened on that great slope of steps that night. I
believe Hyde jeered at the journalistic catchword, "Whose Was the
Hand?" partly because he, himself, had managed it without hands. I
believe he managed to commit a murder entirely with his feet. I
believe he tripped up the poor old usurer and stamped on him on the
stone steps with those monstrous boots. An idyllic moonlight scene,
isn't it? But there's something that seems to make it worse. I
think he had the habit anyhow, partly to avoid leaving his
fingerprints, which may be known to the police. Anyhow, I believe
he did the whole murder with his hands in his trouser-pockets.'</p>

<p>Brandon shuddered suddenly; then collected himself and said,
rather weakly: 'Then you don't think the science of
observation&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Science of observation be damned?' cried Weir. 'Do you still
think private detectives get to know about criminals by smelling
their hair-oil, or counting their buttons? They do it, a whole gang
of them do it just as Hyde did. They get to know about criminals by
being half criminals themselves, by being of the same rotten world,
by belonging to it and by betraying it, by setting a thief to catch
a thief, and proving there is no honour among thieves. I don't say
there are no honest private detectives, but if there are, you don't
get into their service as easily as you and I got into the office
of the distinguished Dr Adrian Hyde. You ask what all this means,
and I tell you one thing it means. It means that you and I are
going to sweep crossings or scrub out drains. I feel as if I should
like a clean job.'</p>
