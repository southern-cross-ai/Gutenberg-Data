  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch-01"></a>I. &mdash; "WELL MET!"</h2>

  <p class="first">This is an immoral story. It proves without intending to
  that the best of us are weak, and the worst have elements of decency that
  overwhelm them when the gods get ready; none of which, of course, is
  orthodox. But orthodoxy is missing from the calculations of those Powers that
  rule us&mdash;"whatever gods there be" as Swinburne calls them.</p>

  <p>Cottswold Ommony is incorruptible according to report. Report is wrong.
  They say&mdash;the Press particularly says it and infers it, nearly every
  morning&mdash;that Meldrum Strange is a billionaire with brains but no heart;
  that his heart, if he has one, is made of iron filings; that his belly is of
  brass, and his feet of clay; that his friendship is imaginary, but his enmity
  a bitter and appalling truth; that he lacks remorse, but has insane ambition;
  and that his superficial outward resemblance to General Ulysses Grant was
  devised by Satan expressly to bring the memory of that gallant soldier into
  disrepute.</p>

  <p>Unexplainably in the circumstances, Meldrum Strange has friends, and
  Cottswold Ommony has enemies. We, who view all life accurately, classing this
  man as a hero, that man as a villain, may wonder; but the fact is so. Ommony
  stands for nearly all the things that Meldrum Strange objects to, including
  the heresy that more than enough is much; Strange never had enough, and loves
  power of money, which Ommony despises, like the rest of us he has to bow to
  it quite often. Ommony approves of individual liberty whereas Strange
  believes that all men should be beaten into ploughshares for uplifting use by
  their betters. They met, and there was no explosion, which is the most
  remarkable circumstance; but much else happened.</p>

  <p>Charlie Wear began it. Charley stepped from a first-class compartment (it
  was labelled first-class) on the single-track branch of the Bombay and
  Southern Railway that winds among hills and trees until it makes a short cut
  through the forest where Ommony lives at intervals and is almost king.</p>

  <p>Charley smiled at the naked legs of a porter nearly twice as large as
  himself, and sent up word on the back of a calling card that he had come, and
  would Mr. Ommony care to see him. So Ommony, who cares about everything
  interesting under the sun, sent the tonga. Less than an hour later Charley
  jumped off the back seat of that prehistoric vehicle, pitched his valise on
  to the lower step of the verandah (having not got used yet to being waited
  on) and is aware of Ommony taking his time about rising from a chair under
  the stags' antlers on the verandah. Three dogs came down and made instant
  friends with Charley, while a fourth took guard.</p>

  <p>"Well met," said Ommony. "Come up."</p>

  <p>So Charley climbed the seven steps, shook hands, and sat in a canvas
  chair, while an enormous staghound sniffed him over carefully and Ommony
  filled a pipe.</p>

  <p>"You like it here?" asked Charley.</p>

  <p>"I've liked it for twenty years," said Ommony, observing that Charley
  stroked the staghound's ears without waiting for introductions&mdash;a thing
  very few strangers dare attempt. "Have you had breakfast?"</p>

  <p>"Forgotten what it 'ud feel like! Ate dead goat yesterday afternoon at a
  junction restaurant."</p>

  <p>Ommony sent for the butler, gave orders, and turned to his guest
  again.</p>

  <p>"You've come to stay, of course?"</p>

  <p>"If that's agreeable. You got my letter?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but you didn't say much. Tell me who you are."</p>

  <p>"Nobody important. Strange hired me to travel with him, but I haven't seen
  him in two weeks. He sends me ahead. Time he gets to a place I'm miles
  away."</p>

  <p>"I begin to understand," said Ommony without changing his expression.
  "You're here in advance of Meldrum Strange to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dope you out? Lord, no! I did that coming up the steps. <i>You're</i>
  O.K."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Ommony, without a trace of sarcasm, and sat still, smoking,
  looking at his guest.</p>

  <p>They resembled each other as much as a terrier does a grizzly. Ommony's
  short beard disguises the kindest mouth and the firmest chin in Asia. His
  shoulders have stood up under responsibility for so long that the stamp of
  that is on them permanently. He is staunchly built, muscled up, and is
  exactly in the prime of life&mdash;an age that varies with individuals.</p>

  <p>Charley Wear, on the other hand, with no more than five feet seven to
  boast of, and not much more than a hundred pounds of it, shows twenty-three
  years and weasel alertness on a clean-shaven face. You can't tell what his
  hand holds, but you know he has played worse ones, and at the first glance
  you would trust him with your shirt. He looks like a man who has been hit
  hard, but who invariably won in the last round, if not sooner; nervous, keen,
  amused, aware of the world's rough edges, and as hard to beat as a royal
  flush. His steely grey eyes looked straight into Ommony's dark ones, and each
  in their own way betrayed absorbing interest.</p>

  <p>"Strange heard of you from the gang," said Charley. "Say this for him he
  has the best string ever. Picks 'em. Knows the trick. James Schuyler Grim's a
  pippin. Jeff Ramsden, half-a-ton of he-man, right end up; bet your back teeth
  on him. Athelstan King&mdash;Englishman, but not half-bad&mdash;used to be
  major in the army, but wears no monocle. Says, 'Haw, dontcherknow,' like the
  rest of 'em, but I'll say he's a scrapper if scars mean anything. Olive skin,
  burnt on from outside. Been to places."</p>

  <p>Ommony smiled.</p>

  <p>"You know him?"</p>

  <p>"Years. He's my friend."</p>

  <p>"You're lucky. Strange hired him over the cable and sent Jeff sliding like
  an elephant on ice to deed him up. Strange keeps you busy&mdash;pays good,
  and has his money's worth. Jeff's sweated off about two hundred, but there's
  lots left. Grim and King got past the sweating stage before Strange hired
  'em, so they don't show it much, but they kind o' know they've made the
  team."</p>

  <p>"What is Meldrum Strange doing?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Bits of everything. Reorganizing the universe mostly. They say his roll
  grows faster than he can peel it off; and he's sore with his brother
  man&mdash;thinks we're crashing down to the kyoodles&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which?"</p>

  <p>"Dogs. Wants to stop it, and has it all figured out, I guess. He started a
  kind of detective bureau in New York with branches everywhere, and they tell
  me it went good until he started sleuthing in the U.S. We have legislators
  over there, the same as everywhere; but there's more of 'em, and more pork.
  Strange has his; so he looks back at the barrel and gets disgusted&mdash;goes
  bald-headed after corruption in politics, and siks the gang on. Inside three
  weeks he's foul of the Senate, House o' Representatives, Treasury, and every
  state legislature in the Union. Foul of all the labour unions, most o' the
  newspapers, half the courts, and all the banks. They crucified him good
  between 'em, some just for the fun of it, a few because they were scared, and
  the rest because they didn't see why Meldrum Strange's millions gave him any
  right to call names."</p>

  <p>"I take it you joined him after this?"</p>

  <p>"You bet. I wanted to see the world, but all I'd got was the ambition and
  an imported camera. I've been studying that for seven years, and I've learned
  a little&mdash;not much, you understand, but more than some of 'em. A picture
  concern I was working for went fluey, so I thought I'd pick a fat one next
  time. Strange looked good to me."</p>

  <p>"But what would he do with a camera-man?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"That's it! He hates 'em. When a man gets money he's always crazy on some
  point or other. Strange 'ud rather get shaved than have his picture taken,
  and he's worn foliage since he was old enough to smoke cigars. A man in his
  office told me Strange was all fed up and going to travel. I began to figure
  on it."</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a difficult sum," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"No. Just like any other sum. You've got to know the formula; then it all
  works out. None of the papers had Strange's picture. They were crazy to get
  it, but he was careful. There's an alley behind the office, and he can step
  out of the backdoor into a limousine, and straight home. He doesn't golf. He
  likes yachting, but the crew's hand-picked, and he stays below as long as
  there's chance to snap him. Simply nothing doing; but I'm set on making the
  long trip, and down to borrowing by that time&mdash;mighty near taking a job,
  and praying like a priest to Lady Luck. She shows up at the very last
  minute."</p>

  <p>"Always!" said Ommony, nodding.</p>

  <p>"Female, naturally. The papers never did have Strange in a mix-up with a
  woman. There was a rumour one time, but Strange has teeth and they were
  afraid he'd soak them for libel. Couldn't prove a thing; had to be satisfied
  antagonizing the woman vote by calling him a misogynist&mdash;which they did,
  till further orders.</p>

  <p>"I was down to house-to-house canvassing. But I'd a pull with two or three
  hotel detectives, so I specialized on new arrivals, calling on
  'em&mdash;camera with me. Funny lights are my long suit. Named a big figure,
  and agreed to shade it for the privilege of&mdash;all that hokum. That's how
  I met Zelmira."</p>

  <p>"Sounds Italian," said Ommony. "Come in to breakfast."</p>

  <p>"Greek," said Charley, sitting down in the room where all four walls are
  draped with tiger-skins, and the only other ornament is a case of rifles in a
  corner. "Believe me, Zelmira Poulakis is the goods," he went on between
  mouthfulls. "She's a peach&mdash;over thirty, for you can't fool me, but good
  to look at&mdash;and class if I know it. Must have money, too, if her
  jewellery and clothes are paid for. I got mine in advance, top-figure, and
  she didn't try to beat me down a nickel. I exposed a dozen plates, and we got
  talking."</p>

  <p>Charley poured a whole cup-full of scalding coffee down his throat and
  signed to the hamal for more. Then he looked at Ommony, with that peculiar
  camera-man's eye that sees effects between the shadow and the edge of
  sunlight.</p>

  <p>"She's like you," he said suddenly. "You don't mind what you tell her.
  I've heard since she had a past in Egypt or somewhere. Her husband was a
  crook, but that cuts no ice now she's a widow. I fell for her hard, and got
  telling how I aimed to see the world with Meldrum Strange. She laughed and
  said she'd rather do that, too, than anything!</p>

  <p>"If she'd been real crooked she'd have started in to play me right then,
  but she didn't. I was the Weisenheimer. I told her how set I was on getting
  Meldrum's picture, and she laughed. She said that ought to be easy enough. I
  was wondering just how to play the hand when she suddenly got cold feet and
  said right out that if I tried to blackmail Meldrum she'd never forgive
  herself for having as much as encouraged me."</p>

  <p>"I was wondering about that, too," said Ommony. "Is Strange that kind of
  man?"</p>

  <p>"You needn't let it <i>worry</i> you!" said Charley, putting down his
  cup.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Ommony. "I apologise. It was your own fault, though. You
  might have made it clearer that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, I made it clear to her; but I had the dickens of a time. She's
  sweet on Meldrum or his money&mdash;both maybe; and he might do worse, or buy
  worse, any way you look at it. She swore she had no hold on him, but knew him
  well enough to 'phone and invite him to call. So after she'd put me through a
  questionnaire that 'ud make Edison look like Easy Street she agreed to tip me
  off. I went and lay low near the telephone for two days."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought you'd have made the round of newspaper offices,"
  ventured Ommony.</p>

  <p>"No need. I knew what <i>they'd</i> pay, supposing I was fool enough to
  spill a good thing. I waited until she 'phoned me, and you bet I was at the
  private entrance of that hotel an hour ahead of time. He got there
  half-an-hour ahead of time, and made for the door with a flunkey on each
  side, but I shot him twice and none of 'em saw me. Then I waited another hour
  and Lady Luck came across. Out comes Strange with Madame Zelmira Poulakis on
  his arm, both of 'em smiling, and I took one good shot before the flunkeys
  got wise. They didn't say a word, but came for me to smash the camera; so I
  stepped into the hotel, where the detective was a friend of mine, and there
  wasn't a thing they could do about it inside there. I guess they said nothing
  to Meldrum, for fear of their jobs&mdash;or if they did, maybe they said
  they'd smashed the camera.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I didn't waste any time then. I developed and printed the
  pictures that night, and believe me, they were good. Next morning I put
  copies in an envelope with my calling card, and sent 'em up to Meldrum
  Strange's private office, saying I'd wait for an answer. It wasn't five
  minutes before he sent for me.</p>

  <p>"'How much d'you want?' he demanded. He was scornful, and he had his
  cheque-book on the table. Got to hand it to him; he can eat crow good. I
  could have taxed him. He was three ways when I pulled out the negatives and
  broke them&mdash;pleased, surprised, and curious to see what card I'd play
  next.</p>

  <p>"So I made no bones about it. I said right out I aimed to travel with him,
  and all I'd planned for was an interview. So he said, 'Well, you've had your
  interview, and you've smashed your negatives. What if I turn you down now?'
  And I said, 'Go to it. Then I'll know you're not the kind of man I want to
  travel with.' We hit it off good after that. He hired me at the end of
  fifteen minutes. I went and told Zelmira, and she let me buy the dinner just
  to celebrate.</p>

  <p>"No glad rags, and no money. Had to do something about it. Sooner than
  bleat to anybody else I told her, and she was tickled&mdash;lent me the price
  and some over. I paid her out of the first cheque. Strange had me sworn not
  to say a word about his movements to anyone, so I didn't drop a hint,
  although I saw Zelmira pretty often. But she understood; she isn't like a
  Greek at all&mdash;downy, I dare bet, and up to her eyes in ambition, but on
  the level. She found out when he was going, and where; maybe she asked him; I
  don't know."</p>

  <p>"But what did Strange come to India for?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Open an office, I guess&mdash;Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, Simla&mdash;he
  aims to be a sort of clearing house for information so's to trip crooks
  before they get started&mdash;card indexes to beat the
  encyclopedia&mdash;everything in 'em from a man's past to what he might do if
  the game looked good. Poker out of books, I'd call it, but that's his affair.
  The funny part is this: he'd come away to give the papers and the public time
  to calm down and forget him, Zelmira Poulakis included. I know about her,
  because on the steamer coming out he asked me whether I'd let on to her about
  his Well, we hadn't been in Bombay before she puts up at the same hotel!"</p>

  <p>"Tagged him, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No. We came by way of San Francisco and Hong-Kong. She took the English
  boat by way of New York and Port Said. But Strange wasn't having any. He
  swore a blue streak and took the train that night&mdash;Delhi like a darned
  fool; she could go to Delhi. Who's to stop her? She showed up at our hotel in
  Delhi&mdash;never made a move to interfere with Strange, but treated Grim and
  Jeff Ramsden like old friends. Strange caught me talking to her, so he
  shipped me off all over the place making dates for him, and I was in a place
  called Ahmednugger when I got a telegram a yard long telling me to see you
  and fix up tiger-shooting for him. He wants to hide and have a good time
  until Zelmira picks on someone else."</p>

  <p>"He heard of me, of course, from Athelstan King?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, and I'm to say King sends his compliments, do you mind?"</p>

  <p>"Strange will have to rough it here," said Ommony. "I'm no
  millionaire."</p>

  <p>Charley looked about him. "Seems you've got tigers," he said. "I reckon
  Strange is killing mad!"</p>

  <p>"How old is he?"</p>

  <p>"'Bout fifty&mdash;fifty-five&mdash;somewhere there. Too much stomach, but
  totes it himself. Doesn't need a nurse yet. Say, you'll like him for awhile
  at any rate. He's real good company; there's nothing wrong with him except
  his point of view," said Charley, almost pleadingly. "King said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'd have him here for your sake," Ommony interrupted, laughing. "You
  stay, of course?"</p>

  <p>"That's up to him. No orders about that yet. I've got my camera. Say, the
  gang told me you know animals from A to Issard."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I've got special English plates, the best lens out of Jena, and scads o'
  more plates in Bombay. All that's needed is a dark room&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can fix that up."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and the animals."</p>

  <p>"Make yourself at home," said Ommony. "When will Strange be here? Better
  wire him, hadn't I?"</p>

  <p>Charley's eyes, sky-bright with a hint of steel in them, met Ommony's
  again and dwelt there half a second.</p>

  <p>"If it's all the same I'd sooner wire and you write," he answered.
  "That'll give us four days extra before he comes."</p>

  <p>Ommony laughed again. "All right. I've only one bath room so you mayn't
  have that; but there's running water, cool enough too, in a shed outside, and
  I'll lend you two men to cover the shed with tar-paper; there's lots of it in
  the shed."</p>

  <p>"They <i>told</i> me you were white!" said Charley, grinning.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>II. &mdash; "I'M THINKING"</h2>

  <p class="first">Art is individual, and knows no limits. Fools are they who
  sneer at new tools, and processes of giving form to idea. Ommony, an artist
  in his own way, paid suitable homage to Charley's camera, because the thing
  of brass and glass and wood was the tool of a true enthusiast.</p>

  <p>That forest and its outskirts are a thousand square miles. There are
  temples in it, not wholly ruinous but older than written history, and in
  places trees have forced themselves up from between the stones of forgotten
  cities. Men live there, known now as junglis, naked and afraid, whose
  ancestors were kings in lost Lemuria if the very ancient books are true. And
  the animals live where human pride one time adored itself.</p>

  <p>Above all, there are spots of sunlight filtered through gaps in the
  foliage; and fire-lanes (Ommony's first charge) along which light flows like
  a river; clearing where creatures, whose every habit is an open book to
  Ommony, lie basking, playing with their young; and a look-out rock from
  which, if the bears aren't there before you, you may view the leagues of
  jungle spread like a sunlit sea.</p>

  <p>Charley was in his element, and Ommony no less.</p>

  <p>"My God, you know," said Charley, "you can do this stuff early and late,
  when the raw's left out and the real thing's looking at you! They say you
  can't, but you can! I know you can!"</p>

  <p>"Let's try," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>So they slept at noon, and stalked the mysteries of twilight, when
  two-thirds of the earth is waking and a third shades into the unknown.</p>

  <p>"Any fool can shoot a tiger on the hop!" swore Charley. "Can you shoot him
  so he'll show on the negative how the light ripples off his pelt? I'll bet
  you!"</p>

  <p>"All bets off," said Ommony. "I think you can."</p>

  <p>But they needed the junglis to show exactly where the tiger lay, and
  Ommony's low whistle to make the beast look up in such way that his proper
  aspect faced the lens, while Diana the staghound lay growling in rumbled
  undertones. And once it was Ommony's rifle that changed death's course, when
  a leopard rushed the click of the ambushed camera and Charley hugged his one
  tool, turning his back to protect it better.</p>

  <p>"So that's all right," said Ommony, measuring the two strides and a half
  that death had lacked.</p>

  <p>"Hope so, at any rate," Charley answered. "I think I got him before he
  moved. Half a second, while I slip in another plate. Did you notice the brown
  of that shadow, and how his 'hind-end seemed afloat in it? If that shows on
  the negative it's worth the trip to India."</p>

  <p>"How much will you get for it?"</p>

  <p>"No more than for a punk one. You can't make money at this game."</p>

  <p>"Nor at mine. But it's good, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You bet-yer!"</p>

  <p>They seemed to have been friends a year when Jeff turned up, walking from
  the station because he loved the feel of brown earth underfoot&mdash;Jeff
  with a beard like Ommony's and a boy's grin, but bigger and heavier than
  Ommony and Charley both together. The verandah chair creaked under him, but
  not even the terrier was afraid, and Diana's long tail thumped approval on
  the floor. Jeff's grin set all the servants grinning. They passed and
  repassed on imaginary errands, to admire his hugeness and the depth of his
  bass voice, that is India's measure of a man's heart.</p>

  <p>"Strange wanted me along," he said, "so I came to discover if that's
  convenient. A telegram wouldn't have told you what you want to
  know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean what you want to know, don't you?" said Ommony, chuckling.</p>

  <p>Jeff laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"You're right. Charley wrote such a glowing account of you that Strange is
  suspicious. You know, a multi-millionaire is a poor devil who thinks everyone
  is trying to work him for something. Thirty per cent of what he thinks is
  true. Strange can't escape even in India. There's a lady on his heels. He
  wants to abuse your hospitality until Venus sets, and he'd like to be sure in
  advance that you won't work him for anything."</p>

  <p>"What will you tell him?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Shall I send for my tent from the station, or have you a spare bed?" Jeff
  answered.</p>

  <p>So Jeff's big tent was pitched, and two of the dogs adopted it forthwith,
  while Jeff's one servant cleaned his boots alongside in the sun and bragged
  to Ommony's assembled household about Jeff's prowess.</p>

  <p>"As a horse he is, yet stronger! Lo, with his fist, thus, he slew a man!
  They say the skull was broken like an egg-shell, but that I saw not. I have
  seen him lift a boat with two men in it. When the wrestlers from Tirhoot came
  to Delhi he threw them all, one by one, and he not weary at the end. They say
  that once, when men of evil purpose locked him behind doors, he broke down a
  door with nothing but his hands, and smote them with the pieces of it. Yet he
  laughs, and his heart is, as a woman's, but not as a too inquisitive woman's.
  The dastari* is good."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* pickings]</p>

  <p>So they were now three who trod the jungle lanes, and laughed until rocks
  that had known the laughter of four forgotten races re-echoed to the high,
  the middle, and the bass&mdash;until the junglis brought word of a bear, hurt
  fighting, whom the flies were driving mad, and Jeff strode off to end that
  misery. (For Ommony is a prince of hosts, reserving to himself no more than
  right to judge emergency.) The bearskin lay pegged out raw side upward in the
  sun the morning Strange came, and Charley told him how Jeff had to use four
  bullets and the butt. Jeff's leg was bandaged; it was nothing serious, but he
  did not walk to the station.</p>

  <p>"I hope you didn't shoot all the game before I got here," Strange growled,
  when he met Jeff on the verandah. "Hurt again? You're always in trouble!"</p>

  <p>He was suffering from bachelor's spleen, and as fearful for his tracks as
  a hunted animal.</p>

  <p>"I think I've given a miss in baulk," he said, sitting down at the
  breakfast-table next to Ommony. "It's in the papers that I'm on my way home.
  Met your sister&mdash;splendid woman. It was she who first suggested my
  visiting you. What's Charley doing here? Shooting game too?"</p>

  <p>"Visiting me," said Ommony, meeting no man's eye.</p>

  <p>"I meant that you and I and Ramsden&mdash;" Strange began.</p>

  <p>"I've invited Charley too," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"He has his living to get."</p>

  <p>"Charley has lived more and better in these last few days than in all his
  previous life," said Ommony. "You're entirely welcome here, Strange; but so's
  he."</p>

  <p>"Hurrumm!" Strange nearly exploded, then governed himself. "Where did you
  get these eggs? They're the best I've had in India."</p>

  <p>So Ommony talked poultry for a while, and of the business of keeping
  leopards from the henhouse, which calls for ingenuity.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you shoot' em all?" Strange asked him.</p>

  <p>"I shoot nothing in the jungle as long as it behaves."</p>

  <p>"D'you call stealing chickens behaviour?"</p>

  <p>"It's natural to leopards."</p>

  <p>"Then you mean we're to shoot nothing but beasts that have broken through
  the hen-wire?" Strange asked disgustedly.</p>

  <p>"You'll find criminals in the jungle in the same proportions as among
  humans," Ommony answered.</p>

  <p>"How do you tell 'em?"</p>

  <p>Strange had decided Ommony was crazy, and made a perfectly obvious effort
  to humour him. You could almost hear the mental mechanism click as he decided
  to cut his visit short.</p>

  <p>"They're just like other criminals. <i>They</i> tell <i>you</i>," answered
  Ommony.</p>

  <p>Strange sat there looking like Ulysses Grant&mdash;without the modesty.
  His was the only face at table that was legible. He resembled the bear that
  Jeff killed, hurt and driven nearly crazy by the flies of public criticism,
  and the servants were afraid of him, hardly daring to hand him things to eat.
  Jeff and Charley, having experienced his moods, were careful to say nothing,
  so the brunt of it fell on their host, who was at a loss for the present how
  to manage the situation. Silence fell, as if the fun of recent days had dried
  up and blown away along a bitter wind.</p>

  <p>"I came to kill a tiger," Strange said suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I believe you did. I think you shall," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Now I wonder what the devil you mean by that remark?" Strange asked
  him.</p>

  <p>One thing was obvious. Strange had looked up Ommony in the <i>Gazette</i>
  and so believed him to be quite a minor personage. He spoke rather as a man
  might to his game keeper&mdash;a man who deserved neither game nor keeper,
  but had both. It was in his mind that no man drawing such small salary in
  middle age was of much account, or had much right to dispense the forest
  privileges. Feudalism, an ancient gas that ever crept along with money, and
  deluded men, caused him to regard his host as someone who had scant option in
  the matter. He didn't enjoy being kowtowed to, but expected it, and his new
  great business organization had made him more tyrannous than ever.</p>

  <p>Breakfast, that should have struck the key-note for holiday and
  comradeship, came to an end on B-flat, and Jeff Ramsden tried to corner
  Strange alone; for Jeff fears nothing except his own slow-wittedness, which
  he strangely overestimates.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he began; but Ommony interrupted him, sent him and Charley on
  imaginary business of looking for a leopard's spoor across the vegetable
  garden, and took Strange off alone to introduce him to the wilderness.</p>

  <p>They took rifles and walked to the look-out rock&mdash;two miles down a
  fire-lane rutted by the wheels of loaded carts.</p>

  <p>Strange's mood backed and veered without improving. He may have been
  wondering why a man with an income in the millions should have to hide
  himself in a forest. From hat to shoe-soles, rifles and all, the same
  two-hundred-dollar bill would have purchased the entire kit, down to the
  skin, of either himself or Ommony. It annoyed him that Ommony strode beside
  him like the owner of the place.</p>

  <p>"I've a notion," he said presently, "to buy a tract of desert in Nevada
  or somewhere, and plant such a forest as this."</p>

  <p>"Money won't do it," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you can always hire brains."</p>

  <p>"But not knowledge. Once a man knows, he's his own man."</p>

  <p>"Well, they hired you, didn't they?"</p>

  <p>"Who did?"</p>

  <p>"The Indian Government."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I offered them my services&mdash;years ago&mdash;for just so
  long as I believe I can be useful."</p>

  <p>"They pay you."</p>

  <p>"No. The forest pays me. When I cease to row my own weight and over, I'll
  resign."</p>

  <p>Strange was piqued, but interested.</p>

  <p>"Well: suppose I offer you double what you're getting here to come and
  superintend my forest?"</p>

  <p>"You can't. You haven't got it to offer."</p>

  <p>Strange began to feel like a patient in one of those rest-cure resorts,
  where rest consists in humouring the whims of other inmates.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he blustered.</p>

  <p>"If you'll stay a month, I'll show you."</p>

  <p>A month! Strange wondered whether he could endure it a week. It was not
  the wilderness that got on his nerves; for all his life he had been a
  solitary man, brooding alone over plans and power. He was used to the 'Come,
  and he cometh; go, and he goeth' of Rome's centurion, with reason neither
  asked nor given. Difference of opinion was a trumpet-call to battle, in which
  the strongest will won. There were men, such as Grim and Ramsden, whom he
  hired to tell the truth to him and to apply their brains. To them he
  listened, but always of his own free will, with a feeling he was getting
  something for his money. This man: who did not even own the forest, yet was
  so visibly unimpressed by the power of invested millions, irritated him.</p>

  <p>"This timber's growing to waste here," he said abruptly.</p>

  <p>"The next generation will need it," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"The next generation will govern themselves, let's hope."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we all hope that."</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of Strange's tongue to say something discourteous about
  the British having not so long to rule in India. But it filtered vaguely
  through his mind that Ommony wouldn't care, and, he knew better, from
  experience, than to waste sharp comment on indifference.</p>

  <p>"Then why grow trees for them?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said Ommony.</p>

  <p>Strange could not answer him, or saw the uselessness of answering. He was
  cheek by jowl with a fanatic, it seemed to him and he made a praiseworthy
  effort to change the flow of thought.</p>

  <p>"Well, let's shoot a tiger," he said abruptly. "You promised me one at
  breakfast. Are they as dangerous as they're said to be, or is that another of
  these&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The one I'll let you shoot is," Ommony answered; and Strange looked at
  him sharply again, aware of a hidden meaning, or a double
  meaning&mdash;something he detested. Yet he couldn't lay his finger on
  it.</p>

  <p>"How so?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Tigers are like people. Decent tigers are like decent people, only on a
  lower plane. They only kill for food, and let alone what they can't use. A
  few of them are greedy, and kill too much. Some are lazy, and kill cattle,
  which is stealing. Sometimes you can drive those and make them go to work.
  They've a right to be tigers, just as we've a right to be men, and left to
  themselves, but watched, they work out a destiny that possibly we can't
  understand. Now and then I think I understand it. They turn criminal at
  times, though. Man-killers. Nobody's fault but theirs then. Shortshrift."</p>

  <p>"You're after a man-killer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"This morning?"</p>

  <p>"Get him within the month," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>Strange was more than ever puzzled. "I should think you'd put your whole
  force on a man-killer. Go after him, and get him before he can do anymore
  harm. Why not?"</p>

  <p>"If you have him where he can't do harm, why hurry?" answered Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have him rounded up where he can't escape?"</p>

  <p>"He might escape, but I hope not. No. I didn't round him up. He wandered
  out of his territory into an environment that he thinks he understands, but
  doesn't. We'll have fun with him."</p>

  <p>"I should call that dangerous."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. For him. He won't kill men while we have him under observation.
  This is the lookout rock."</p>

  <p>Ommony sent the stag-hound first up the well worn trail that circled to
  the summit, to make sure there were no bears or leopards to misinterpret the
  intrusion. He went next, springing up quickly, leaving Strange to scramble
  slowly after him. He had talked all the tiger he chose to just then.</p>

  <p>For about five minutes, panting on the summit, Strange took in the view of
  a forest like a raging sea arrested in mid-turmoil. Waves and waves of green,
  and purple where the shadows were, so shook and seemed to plunge in the
  breath of a light wind; that a man could think dead tree-tops were the
  rigging of sunken ships. There were rocks like islands. On the far horizon
  was a bank of clouds for shore. Kites wheeled like darkened sea-gulls; and
  the murmur of the wind among the trees was like the voice of "many-sounding
  ocean."</p>

  <p>Size&mdash;all enormousness&mdash;was something that appealed to Meldrum
  Strange. He could think in millions as he stood there, and it pleased him.
  Sight of all those myriads of living things, governed, as he sensed it, by
  one man, there for one purpose, under his hand, available, awaiting one word
  by a man with brains, to be swept into the jaws of Titan industry and pulped,
  sawed, planed, bent into profitable use by folk who couldn't grow a tree or
  even buy a whole one&mdash;thrilled him.</p>

  <p>"How many of these were here when you came?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Very few. Just scattered copses."</p>

  <p>"Grew them all, eh!"</p>

  <p>"No, they grew themselves. Nature attends to all that, if you coax
  her."</p>

  <p>"This 'ud be a good place to start an industry. This interests me. I must
  interview the Government about it. Cheap labour. A railway. Only a hundred
  miles or so from the coast. We could ship this stuff. No small proprietors to
  bother with. It looks like opportunity. What's the Government thinking of, I
  wonder?"</p>

  <p>"The next generation," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, man! The British won't be here. There'll be an Indian
  Government by that time, grafting and playing politics. They'll waste,
  destroy, ruin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's their look out. It won't be cut in my day."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure."</p>

  <p>Strange was himself again. He stood with arms folded on his breast and the
  old light burning in his eyes&mdash;devouring light, that could not see use
  in unexploited profit. His brain was already figuring in terms of import
  duties, labour, and exchange sea&mdash;freight&mdash;subsidies&mdash;and a
  market where the men who put in number nineteen bolts all day long must have
  what they can pay for ready-made.</p>

  <p>He looked again at Ommony&mdash;made a new appraisal. Mad, of course. A
  fanatic. Yet a man of one idea is like a horse in harness. You can use him.
  He can be a strong cog in the intricate machine. The punishing grind, that
  kills or makes a rebel of the fellow who can see both sides of anything, only
  spurs a fanatic to further effort. He might use Ommony. No doubt
  flattery&mdash;</p>

  <p>"A man needs genius at this business, as at everything else, if he's to
  succeed. You're wasted here now. You've done it. You should go ahead. A man
  on half your salary could carry on, while you devote yourself to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's my ambition," Ommony interrupted. He was tired already of the
  subject Strange had broached. "I'd like to spend my whole time studying
  trees. But my plan would cost too much."</p>

  <p>"There's no such thing as too much, if it's a sound plan," Strange assured
  him.</p>

  <p>"The Government's hard up. Can't afford experiments. They'd listen to me
  if they had the money, but India's poor."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! Turn this into money then!"</p>

  <p>"Trees have never been studied properly. As you see, they grow themselves,
  given a chance and the right location. My theory is that all the waste land
  in the world might be turned into forests at very small expense, if we only
  took the right precautions first and studied the thing from the beginning.
  It's the first part&mdash;travel, observation, comparative analysis,
  experiment on a sufficient scale that would prove too costly."</p>

  <p>Strange made a motion with his tongue, almost suggestive of changing a
  quid of tobacco from one cheek to the other.</p>

  <p>"You say the Government would listen to you. Value your advice, eh? Well:
  advise them to give me a concession to exploit this forest. If it comes off,
  look to me for help in the other matter. Think what it would mean."</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking."</p>

  <p>Diana the stag-hound was growling in a sort of subterranean undertone, not
  more than loud enough for Ommony to hear, He glanced to his right, where an
  enormous teak tree, mother of the grove around her, reached three-quarters as
  high as the rock. An almost naked jungli in a gap among the lower branches
  caught his eye and signalled. Ommony's eye followed the line of the jungli's
  arm.</p>

  <p>"That <i>might</i> be your tiger," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Where? Show me!"</p>

  <p>Strange clutched his rifle that he had leaned against a corner of the
  rock, and looked over Ommony's shoulder, trying to get the line.</p>

  <p>"You see a rock about a hundred yards from the base of this
  one&mdash;shaped roughly like an egg at this end. Carry your eye to the right
  from that. Now: d'you see a patch of brown leaves with light and shadow
  playing on them? Part's lighter than the rest&mdash;more gold in it. You get
  that? That's your tiger. He's looking up at us. It's a very difficult shot
  indeed from here."</p>

  <p>"I used to shoot well once. I'll have a crack at him."</p>

  <p>Strange aimed, and hesitated. The light played tricks with his
  unaccustomed eye. It was almost as if the shadow were limpid water, with
  little patches of sunlight dancing on it. The angle was awkward and the rifle
  heavy. He stepped back behind the rock and rested the weapon on a projecting
  corner.</p>

  <p>"Now!" he said, and began to aim again. "Is he still there? I've lost
  sight of him."</p>

  <p>"Still there, looking up at you."</p>

  <p>"Curse that dog! She'll scare the brute away!"</p>

  <p>"Better shoot then."</p>

  <p>"He's moving, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"That was his head that moved. He's standing head-on toward you. He's
  heard us talking. His tail's twitching now. Can you see it? He'll make his
  mind up in a minute. Better be quick. You'll likely kill him if you hit him
  at this angle."</p>

  <p>Strange fired.</p>

  <p>"Too late, and a yard wide&mdash;to the right and beyond him," said
  Ommony. "Well, perhaps he'll take the hint. Some do."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if this foresight's any good," said Strange, battling with
  irritation. "Was that the man-eater?"</p>

  <p>"No. One at a time. That was only a greedy brute that kills more than he
  needs. Too bad you missed him, but he gets another chance."</p>

  <p>"You don't tell me you can recognize one tiger from another in that light,
  through the branches! How d'you know he isn't hit, and hiding down
  there?"</p>

  <p>"It's part of my business to know that sort of thing," said Ommony, and
  glanced at Diana. She was lying down licking herself. "That tiger's a quarter
  of a mile away by now, and still going."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to look," said Strange. "I didn't see him go. I don't believe he
  did."</p>

  <p>"All right. Go down and look. You'll be perfectly safe. I'll sit here and
  smoke while you hunt for him," said Ommony. But he made a signal to the
  jungli, who dropped from a lower branch and kept an eye on Meldrum Strange as
  one would watch a new unusual animal.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; "PERHAPS A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW"</h2>

  <p class="first">Ommony sat smoking and smiling to himself but he was
  dreadfully afraid. The smile was hard at the corners. No woman feared for her
  child, or fought on occasion more shiftingly for it, than he for that forest.
  His heart was in it. He would have said his soul was in it, too. Several
  times he had had to counter-sap and mine against the assault of British
  capitalists. The American was likely to be more resourceful, that's all. He
  knew the blindness of the money-giant, and its cruelty; its over-riding
  tactics, and the almost insignificance of ordinary honesty opposed to it.</p>

  <p>He had not told Meldrum Strange that nearly all the mother-trees were
  teak. He had not dared. But Strange would find that out. And he had a notion
  that it would be better to inform a wolf that there were lambs in a certain
  valley.</p>

  <p>True, Strange was supposed to have retired from the ranks of industry. But
  there are said-to-be-tamed wolves. Who trusts them? King, Grim, Ramsden were
  as good men as there are. But so is fire good, until employed by an
  incendiary. Strange's eleventh hour resolution to reform the world by the
  weight of his manoeuvred money was only wolf-eat-wolf at best; to judge from
  Charley and Jeff Ramsden's accounts, the again-to-be-protected people had
  preferred to protect themselves in the ancient way from uninvited
  interference. Strange was bitter with ingrowing disappointment. Nothing in
  the circumstances was likelier, thought Ommony, than that in the twinkling of
  an eye new internationally interwoven system of bureaux of impertinent
  information should be changed into the thousand-fanged heads of an industrial
  monster. A wolf is a wolf. A man who is afraid imagines things.</p>

  <p>In one sense Ommony's mood was mischievous. It amused him to see a "money
  baron" stripped of his pretensions, naked, as it were to an observing eye. In
  less than a month he thought he could have fun with Meldrum
  Strange&mdash;quiet fun, it would do Strange no harm, possibly some good,
  certainly amuse himself. But fear for his forest overcame all other
  emotions.</p>

  <p>He knew how sensitive the Government would be to suggestions. Already one
  of the main planks the revolutionary agitators' platform was the British
  Government's alleged neglect of Indian industry. The western disease of
  exploitation for exploitation's sake had its spores in, and was spreading.
  Big Business had its eye on three hundred millions of possible
  "wage-earners." The first thing to go would be the trees. They always go
  first.</p>

  <p>You may much more safely burn a decent fellow's house and take his money
  than undo the work he has laid his hand to. Whatever is indecent in him comes
  to the surface then. There was a change in Ommony's eye. His teeth bit deeper
  into the notch on the horn mouthpiece of his pipe, and Diana, dumb but
  all-observing, came closer to lay a shaggy head on his knee and wonder what
  next?</p>

  <p>Ommony did not move when he heard a rifle shot. He was surprised that
  Meldrum Strange should have gone so far in so few minutes, but supposed the
  man's enthusiasm for the chase, or his rage at having missed, was making a
  fool of him. Now, no doubt, he was shooting at rustling undergrowth. Next, he
  would lose himself. But there was more than one jungli on the job to hunt him
  back, and it would be rather amusing afterwards to compare Strange's version
  of it all with theirs. A man who is lost in the jungle, too, imagines
  things.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later he did not even look up when Diana pricked her ears, and
  he heard Jeff Ramsden's unmistakable heavy footsteps clambering the look-out
  rock. He was not afraid of anything Jeff might do, without Strange to
  persuade him and direct.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, old man," said Jeff from behind leaning on a rifle, "I've made a
  bloomer. Charley and I found what we supposed were leopard tracks and
  followed them to about half a mile here, and I fired at a glimpse in the
  thicket. Hit a tiger, and he got away into the undergrowth Charley's watching
  the place, and I came to I make my peace with you."</p>

  <p>Ommony got to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Did you call the dogs off?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. They're tied up beside Charley."</p>

  <p>"We'll go get the tiger. Where did you him?"</p>

  <p>"It looked like a rib shot."</p>

  <p>"Did you see Strange?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>They strode down the track together, where wheel-marks came to an end and
  the fire-lane advantage of rock on which nothing would grow&mdash;then
  plunged out of that wide opening into a narrow lane made by wild elephants
  and kept growing up again by Ommony's patrol; out of that into a maze of
  criss-cross tracks, along which Jeff led with a hunter's instinct; at last
  into a natural clearing entered by a dozen trails, near the of one of which
  Charley sat on a fallen tree beside the two dogs.</p>

  <p>"No sound of him," said Charley. "But the dogs seem to think he's in
  there."</p>

  <p>Something Charley said after that made Jeff laugh, and the deep note
  boomed along the glade.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Where are you?" shouted another voice, and Ommony chuckled. From
  about a hundred yards away there came a noise greater than that of ten tigers
  as a heavy man thrust his way against dry branches.</p>

  <p>"Better go rescue him, hadn't I?" asked Jeff. "He's in safe hands."</p>

  <p>"Send Diana."</p>

  <p>"No, he'd think she was a wild beast and shoot her. I'll manage it."</p>

  <p>Ommony put two fingers to his teeth and whistled. Within the minute a
  jungli appeared in an opening and stood waiting without any visible emotion.
  Ommony spoke words unintelligible to the others and the jungli
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Is he in there, Di?" said Ommony, and the staghound began nosing, but not
  growling, near the edges of the thicket, into which Jeff and Charley agreed
  the tiger had escaped. Diana barked once, and looked puzzled, but continued
  not to growl at all.</p>

  <p>"He's in there. I think he's dead," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Shall we try?" asked Charley, from the depths of inexperience.</p>

  <p>"No. Wait."</p>

  <p>Strange emerged into the opening, pushed by one jungli, pulled by
  another.</p>

  <p>"These savages are tearing me to pieces!" he objected. "Why are you
  <i>here</i>? I thought you to wait for me on the look-out rock."</p>

  <p>"We think there's a dead tiger," Charley piped up.</p>

  <p>The intention was good. He meant to direct Strange's irritation away from
  Ommony toward himself. He <i>did</i> banish the irritation. Strange's face
  suddenly shone with triumph. He left fingering in his torn jacket.</p>

  <p>"I <i>told</i> you I hit him!" he said, thrusting his chin at Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you did say so."</p>

  <p>Ommony turned his back to hide a grin, winked at the other two, and began
  peering into the undergrowth. Jeff took twenty strides down the behind him,
  picked up an empty brass shell, obliterated traces of his own heels in the
  mould. Ommony sent a jungli up a sar tree, to crawl along an overhanging
  branch and peer downward. The jungli said two words. Ommony answered. The
  jungli broke off dead wood dropped it&mdash;spoke again.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Ommony. "Dogs in first."</p>

  <p>So Diana led the way, with the other two yelping at her heels. The junglis
  hacked behind them with the knives that were their only badge of office. In
  five minutes Ommony was counting the whiskers and claws of a male tiger, lest
  the men who would have to take the pelt off should add to their private store
  of talismans against the devils of the forest.</p>

  <p>"There!" said Strange. "You <i>said</i> I'd kill him if I hit him from
  that angle."</p>

  <p>That was Strange's measure of concession, magnanimous for sake of the
  proprieties. His voice was an unrighteous crow, and Ommony, with his finger
  in the bullet-hole, making note of the angle of impact, said nothing. Jeff
  gathered up the carcase and carried it out into the clearing, while the
  junglis clucked in amazement, because it takes four of them to carry a grown
  tiger on a pole; and only Ommony observed how carefully Jeff laid the carcase
  down. Strange might otherwise have seen the hole through which the bullet
  emerged, after tearing straight across from rib to rib, behind the
  heart&mdash;out of a rifle nearly on a level with the tiger, broadside
  to.</p>

  <p>"Huh! My first tiger! Hu&mdash;humum!"</p>

  <p>It was meant there should be others to follow this one. Acquisitiveness
  had its claws in. To Meldrum Strange there was no such thing as enough of
  anything he liked. Now he would no longer have to be satisfied to smile
  contemptuously at club members who donated big-game trophies to decorate the
  rooms (with their names underneath on neat brass plates); he would be one of
  them. After all, he wasn't only a millionaire, he was human being who had
  missed a lot of fun he was entitled to.</p>

  <p>"You asked me to stay a month, I think?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, at least a month," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"I will."</p>

  <p>Three faces changed. Jeff's and Charley's fell; they had been confident
  that Strange would cut his visit short, and had hoped to be left him for a
  few days. Ommony's rose like a barometer. His enemy had delivered himself
  into his hand.</p>

  <p>"The forest is yours," he said delightedly, but added, "for a month then,"
  by way of afterthought thought.</p>

  <p>"It'll suit me," Strange announced pompously. "Do my health good. And I
  needn't waste time, seeing I've Ramsden with me. Have you horses, Mr.
  Ommony?"</p>

  <p>Jeff's face fell lower yet. He shook his head at Ommony from behind
  Strange's back. But Ommony could not deny he had three horses in the
  stable.</p>

  <p>"Good. If you'll lend me two horses, and a few of your savages to show the
  way, I can ride about with Ramsden and we'll have a good look at this forest
  of yours. Something might come of it."</p>

  <p>Ommony did not care. He never did doubt Destiny when Destiny dealt him the
  joker. He trod homeward with a lighter step, enduring Strange's arrogance
  without a twinge, indifferent to the fact that the other two were gloomy.</p>

  <p>"And as for Charley," Strange said suddenly, "I'll send him home." Perhaps
  some memory of how Charley had attached himself revived resentment. "You're
  not cut out for this kind of thing," he said over his shoulder. "You'd better
  return to New York on the next ship. I'll give you an order on the New York
  office for your pay."</p>

  <p>"Can you beat that?" asked Charley in an overtone to the world at
  large.</p>

  <p>"Keep you from buzzing about India. Go home, and go to work!" Strange
  snorted.</p>

  <p>Jeff's terrific grip on Charley's shoulder saved a hot retort, Jeff having
  notions of his own, and the rest of the walk home was made in silence,
  Strange being awkwardly aware of a great storm brewing behind him. But he was
  set on his purpose now. No argument from Jeff or anyone was going to move him
  one iota. Charley should go home. Jeff and he would ride about the forest,
  appraising it, and killing big game. He strode up the steps of Ommony's
  bungalow as if he owned the place, and Jeff intercepted Ommony.</p>

  <p>"D'you care if I'm in there alone with him first for a minute or two?"
  Jeff asked.</p>

  <p>"Very much. I object!"</p>

  <p>"I want a minute's talk with him. If he answers back, I'll thrash him. He
  may have the tiger, but he can't treat Charley that way, and keep me. I'm
  through with the brute."</p>

  <p>"One minute," said Ommony. "Just how far are you and I friends?"</p>

  <p>Jeff hesitated, looking straight into Ommony's eyes. Each knew the other
  for a man worth trusting but the big man's anger had risen until the veins on
  his forehead swelled.</p>

  <p>"This isn't the first time Strange has made a beast of himself in front of
  me," he said, with that slow, deliberate impressiveness that argues behind
  the words. "It's the last!"</p>

  <p>"After all, I'm host. Why not leave this me?" said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you put it that way, I'll go now. You may tell him I'm through and
  will call or later."</p>

  <p>"Charley's going to stay," said Ommony. "How can he?"</p>

  <p>"He's my guest."</p>

  <p>"Then Strange will go."</p>

  <p>"Not if you stay."</p>

  <p>"What's the use?"</p>

  <p>"You see this forest? Strange has made mind to cut down every tree in it.
  I'm alone against him. I want your backing. I want you to help me keep him
  here occupied, until I have time to upset his plan."</p>

  <p>"Humm! He won't listen to me if I argue against it," said Jeff. "He's
  mule-headed."</p>

  <p>"Precisely. Then argue for it. Stay here and help me."</p>

  <p>"I'm on the brute's pay roll," Jeff objected.</p>

  <p>"All right, give him his money's worth. Show him what the forest would be
  worth to an exploiter."</p>

  <p>"Let me take him by the neck and throw him into the first train leaving
  for Bombay!"</p>

  <p>"The worst thing you could do," said Ommony. "You'd rouse all the monster
  in him. If he couldn't ruin you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He can't. I'm independent, thank the Lord!"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;he'd make me deputy and have revenge on me. He'd have to vent his
  spleen on something, so he'd steal or buy a concession and make this place a
  howling wilderness."</p>

  <p>"I think he would," Jeff answered. "Would it break you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. I've saved a competence. But look." He took Jeff's arm and turned
  him toward the fairest view of nursed and well-loved timber. "Perhaps a
  hundred years from now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jeff nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I've seen him at it. I've exploited for him; but that was gold and
  silver&mdash;you can take them anytime. All right Ommony."</p>

  <p>They did not shake hands. An understanding that was much too deep and
  elemental for surface expression had made them partners. Both men were
  conscious of a pact that might involve immeasurable consequences. The law of
  hospitality, that says a guest may not be allowed to betray himself; the law
  of loyalty, that grants the same grace to the employer; Jeff's habit of open
  dealing, and Ommony's of absolute reliance on a Destiny he trusted, were all
  in danger and both men knew it. They had pledged themselves to the lesser of
  two evils, for lack of an obvious third course, and neither of them liked it,
  but both were resolute. Jeff strode away to the stables to let his anger
  cool, there being something about horses that comforts and restores the
  self-control of outdoor men. Ommony looked for Charley and found him packing
  his camera in the improvised dark-room.</p>

  <p>"You'll stay, of course," he said, abruptly, divining instantly that
  Charley would not.</p>

  <p>"You bet! I'll stay away from him. If this wasn't your house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it is," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"I'd lick him first! Maybe I can't, but I'd treat myself to the
  attempt."</p>

  <p>"I'd have to protect him, of course."</p>

  <p>"Sure. I've no quarrel with you."</p>

  <p>"What's your plan, then?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Pull out of here, and then think. Lend me your rig to the
  station, soon as I get this stuff packed. If I see him again there'll be
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"Have you money?"</p>

  <p>"Not much. But I'll take no more of his."</p>

  <p>"Let me help out."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. No. I've enough to get to Delhi. Zelmira's there. Maybe she'll
  finance a scheme for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ommony whistled softly, so that Diana, close at heel, became alert for the
  unforeseen. She knew that signal of her master's changing mood.</p>

  <p>"Why, what's up?" asked Charley.</p>

  <p>"The flag," said Ommony. "It's nailed up. Any port in a storm, and any
  friend in tr&mdash;. Tell me, to what extent do you feel beholden to your
  late employer?"</p>

  <p>"From now on? Nix! He's mud for all of me."</p>

  <p>"So if Madame Poulakis should ask you for news of Strange's whereabouts,
  you'd&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell her he's not fit to run with. Gee! What a woman like her can see in
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Isn't that her affair?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Maybe. It's mine to tell her what I think, and I will if she freezes me
  for it."</p>

  <p>"But you'll tell her where he is?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe'if she wants to know, after I'm through knocking him."</p>

  <p>"Let me pay your fare to Delhi!"</p>

  <p>Charley made a hand-spring to the workbench, and sat there looking at
  Ommony with those sky-bright eyes that read vague nuances between the light
  and shadow.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" he asked again. "I'd do a lot to help you."</p>

  <p>"Is Madame Poulakis clever?"</p>

  <p>"As blazes! Only dumb thing about her is she wants Strange. Cave-man
  stuff, I reckon."</p>

  <p>"Well: suppose you warn her against Strange&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll do that sure, first thing! What then?"</p>

  <p>"If she persists after that, would you give her a message from me, as an
  absolute stranger?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell her anything you say."</p>

  <p>"Say this: that Strange contemplates using his money and influence to grab
  this forest, and she can have me for ally on sole condition that she helps me
  to prevent that, by using her influence with Strange."</p>

  <p>"If, as, and when!" said Charley. "Sure. I get you. If that's his game,
  why don't you go straight to headquarters and spike it?"</p>

  <p>"Daren't. If I should leave here Strange would jump to the right
  conclusion. Knowledge that I was opposing him would only make him keener, and
  he can beat us all with his money ridden influence. He could buy some
  politicians and the native press'pull strings'and have the forest. This fight
  has got to be personal between Meldrum Strange and me. I'm looking for
  allies."</p>

  <p>"I'm one," said Charley.</p>

  <p>"Let's hope she'll be another."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But listen here," said Charley. "I reserve the right to warn her
  first. I'm going to tell her what I think of Strange, and why."</p>

  <p>"Agreed."</p>

  <p>"I'll warn her he's no good, and that if she gets him she'll regret it
  from the minute they sign up. I'll rub it in good, with illustrations a
  lecture on the side, and give her a day a night to think it over. After that,
  if she's still nuts on him, I'll tell her I know she's crazy, and chip
  in."</p>

  <p>"Satisfactory to me," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"What'll I tell her to do, though?"</p>

  <p>"Leave that to her. Tell her she can count on me to help her, but on what
  terms, and say we've got thirty days to win or lose in. Now, let me provide
  you with money."</p>

  <p>"No. I've enough for the present."</p>

  <p>"Have lunch before you go, then. There's no train till two o'clock."</p>

  <p>"No. Put up some eats for me. Send 'em to the station. I'll wait there. If
  I see Strange again I'll hurt him. Say&mdash;turn round&mdash;look through
  the door! D'you see that line of light down the edge of a monkey on the big
  tree over to the left? Look at him move now! Can you beat it?"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV. &mdash; AS ESTHER TO AKAZUERUS</h2>

  <p class="poem">"Mon ami,<br>
  Bon ami,<br>
  Je fais mes compliments, Hopp-la-la!<br>
  Tra-la-la-la-la!<br>
  Je m'en fiche de vos dents!"</p><br>

  <p>Ommony stepped back into his house, humming, and if not devoid of care,
  inclined to laugh at it. Great-hearted men, forever diving into gloom as the
  price of greatness, rise out of it again and soar the higher for it. Problems
  lie buried in earth; their hearts are of the empyrean. Ommony again could see
  his forest enduring for centuries, ripening, reseeding, fulfilling its
  destiny, as he proposed to fulfil his.</p>

  <p>He was more than courteous to Strange; he charmed him. Gone was the
  feeling of being at the mercy of this invading Visigoth; unnatural restraint
  went with it, and he made it his business to soften the fall of the tyrant by
  giving him good entertainment to remember.</p>

  <p>If he did have qualms, they had vanished. The means he meant to use were
  such as Strange provided him, nor had he any thought of personal gain. At the
  end of that first day he might have entered the millionaire's employment
  almost on his own terms; for it was part of Strange's pride that he could
  pick men, and he began to see the unusual characteristics of his host.</p>

  <p>Of all the men in India who can weave tales from the entrails of events
  Cottswold Ommony stands first. His gift is to see below the surface, and
  interpret; and he sees so much more than camera or microscope, that what he
  says has a sound of half-humorous prophecy.</p>

  <p>All rich men crave amusement, and enjoy the truth if it is handed to them
  on such terms as let them laugh at it, that being the old court jester's
  secret. And there on the fringe of that forest all the world's news seemed to
  come, for Ommony to turn over and subject to scrutiny.</p>

  <p>It was not for Strange to know that Ommony stands high in the counsels of
  the ablest secret service in the world; or that men, near the throne send him
  sealed communications, to be returned with his marginal comment. His duty and
  pleasure are trees, and they, like his natural gifts, are a nation's, to be
  drawn on in emergency.</p>

  <p>So Strange learned things that are only guessed at by the politicians, and
  the days began to pass superbly&mdash:the best, almost the only true vacation
  Strange had in all his life. He and Ommony, and Jeff Ramsden with the least
  decrepit of the horses straining under him, explored the forest in all
  directions, Ommony diverting attention from the trees by telling of ancient
  races that had once owned cities there.</p>

  <p>Whenever Strange became greedy for a stand of timber, it always seemed
  that they came to an ancient ruin, or the traces of a road, immediately.
  There Ommony would dismount, to give Jeff's horse a chance, and would turn
  imagination loose among such facts as he had garnered, speculating on the
  ways and manners of nations dead centuries ago.</p>

  <p>Strange had about decided to endow a new museum in the West when, on the
  fifth morning, as Jeff was starting for the stable to take pity on his horse
  before the day's work, he stopped in the garden face to face with a fat
  Bengali babu.</p>

  <p>"Chullunder Ghose!" he exclaimed. "You were fired for good and all. What
  are <i>you</i> doing here?"</p>

  <p>The babu was resplendent in new cotton clothing and a silk turban of
  rainbow hue that would have shamed a peacock, but he sat down in the dust and
  fanned himself with a palm leaf. The action was apparently impromptu and
  induced by the heat; but he seemed aware that in that position a bed of
  flowers no brighter than his turban screened him effectually from the
  house.</p>

  <p>"You were fired," Jeff repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes. In moment of wrath deprived of pittance for support of wife and
  numerous dependents. Said brutality was highly desperate for brutalee. Am in
  new employment therefore."</p>

  <p>"Oh."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

  <p>"Who's the unfortunate employer? Mr. Ommony?</p>

  <p>"No, sahib, no such luck; yet better luck. This babu is much blessed."</p>

  <p>"Who are you robbing?"</p>

  <p>"Immaculate and gorgeous creature, such as queens should envy and the
  wives of viceroys should imitate, has availed heavenborn self of this babu's
  confidential services."</p>

  <p>"What's her name? Satanita? Jezebel?"</p>

  <p>"Ah! All glorious name, if only for a while! How fleeting are life's
  pseudonyms for spiritual facts! Sahib, pray desist! I said confidential
  services!"</p>

  <p>"You see my boot?" demanded Ramsden.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, yes'emphatically; but desist! I must see Mr. Ommony. Instructions
  are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's on the verandah."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and three dogs. Krishna! Here is one of them! Sahib, call the brute
  off!"</p>

  <p>Diana came and sniffed at the babu, only restraining open enmity on Jeff's
  account. Chullunder Ghose shrugged himself into the smallest space possible,
  covering his bare legs with folds of clothing. His toes twitched in his
  sandals.</p>

  <p>"I am fearful! Yow! What evil incarnated into thee?" he demanded, scowling
  at the dog.</p>

  <p>Jeff scratched his chin. Past experience of the babu warned him; however,
  the house and its problems were Ommony's.</p>

  <p>"Fetch your master, Di!" he ordered; and Di went off at a bound.</p>

  <p>"Oh, excellent!" exclaimed the babu. "Sahib, the embodiment of
  homage'thus!"</p>

  <p>He blew into his right hand and made a gesture as if throwing the result
  at Jeff, who grinned at him.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Smiles! This babu makes salaam of much appreciation!"</p>

  <p>He bowed to the dust.</p>

  <p>"What has Di found?" demanded Ommony, appearing down the path. "Snake?
  Leopard tracks?" he hazarded. "Oh. No, I can't employ a babu. Sorry. You may
  get food from the servants and sleep one night in the godown, if that's
  convenient."</p>

  <p>"Am overwhelmed by courtesy! Sahib, graciously consent to listen to me
  Lend me your ear."</p>

  <p>"I'm listening."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, this babu is not Mark Antony! Publicity, the breath of all things
  temporal, is very well for politicians, but for me, unopulent and pitiful
  babu that I am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right. Come up to the verandah."</p>

  <p>"And spill beans! Sahib, I can say no in seven languages. Will one
  suffice?"</p>

  <p>Ommony glanced sideways, but Jeff had already taken the hint; he strolled
  to the verandah to keep Strange occupied.</p>

  <p>He suspected this man might be of the secret service, that employs the
  unlikeliest individual. But there was no signal. The babu, having ascertained
  by peering around the flower-bed on hands and knees that they actually could
  not be overheard, made ready to enjoy himself. Eyes, gesture, attitude
  betokened mystery.</p>

  <p>"Mellidrum Strange&mdash;" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"What of him?"</p>

  <p>"Is here?"</p>

  <p>"What of that?"</p>

  <p>"<i>She</i> is <i>there</i>!" said the babu, gesturing, thumb over
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>Ommony looked startled, and corrected that too late to spoil the babu's
  exquisite satisfaction. However, he made an effort to seem ignorant.</p>

  <p>"Who is <i>she</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Most glorious of feminines! Amazing woman! Oh! Ah! Wonderful! This
  enraptured babu brings compliments of memsahib Zelmira Poulakis to Ommony
  sahib, who is therefore enviable."</p>

  <p>Ommony turned his back for a moment to consider. The East can read thought
  fairly accurately if allowed to watch the thinker's eyes and face, and it
  seldom pays to betray concern.</p>

  <p>"Is she at <i>the</i> station?" he demanded, turning again suddenly. He
  had not quite mastered irritation; Zelmira's move appeared ill-considered,
  and she a shallow-minded female after all.</p>

  <p>The babu almost chuckled, but refrained from prudence. Ommony's toe was
  too near, and the dog was just behind him.</p>

  <p>"Self am strategist."</p>

  <p>"I asked, where is she?"</p>

  <p>"Not so. The sahib asked, is she at the station? She arrived at a station,
  let us hope. This babu, not having seen his goddess since Sissoo Junction at
  hour of midnight, train being belated, can only surmise her ladyship's
  present whereabouts. Will hazard guess subject to modification by feminine
  caprice."</p>

  <p>"Where is she?" Ommony demanded sternly.</p>

  <p>"This babu, having changed trains at Sissoo Junction, hazards guess her
  ladyship may now be at Chota Pegu&mdash;in direction as thumb
  points&mdash;across forest&mdash;guestess of three-gun rajah of same
  ilk."</p>

  <p>Ommony's face resumed its normal cheerful He had fought the Rajah of Chota
  Pegu to a conclusion long ago, over grazing rights and forest boundary, as
  victor using his influence afterwards to increase the royal revenue by
  getting an anachronistic tribute payable by the rajah to central government
  abolished. In consequence rajah had added an elephant to three that formed
  the tripod of royal dignity, and the men were now as close to being friends
  as fox might be with badger&mdash;mutually tolerant, at least.</p>

  <p>"Am intimate in counsels of Rajah of Chota Pegu," said the babu. His air
  was less of than of possession. Ommony instantly suspected blackmail.</p>

  <p>"How did Madame Poulakis come by <i>your</i> services?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately!" said the babu. "Self was, as Yankees say, up against it,
  perambulating Delhi in vain search of occupation for support of wife and
  numerous dependents. Was shabbiness personified, approaching hotels by back
  way only, much ashamed. Like Romeo, beholding vision of radiant love on hotel
  upper-floor balcony by moonlight&mdash;tourist presumably&mdash;too well
  dressed in view of income-tax for wife of British officer&mdash;sought means
  of approach to offer services as guide, same gainful, generally. Was spurned
  forth from back-entrance by officious Punjabi dippity-steward with soul for
  sale. Returned and purchased same for one rupee eight annas, thus obtaining
  access to upper landing, whence to glorious creature's balcony was one step.
  Climbed over and sat down in deep shadow of potted palm tree, to
  meditate."</p>

  <p>"You mean to listen?"</p>

  <p>"Same thing, sahib. Recent arrival addressed as Charley, picturesquely
  indignant at unknown personage named Melidrum Isstrange, held forth, she
  protesting with much amusement. <i>In vino veritas</i>; in anger
  indiscretion, which is better. This babu ascertained much that otherwise
  finding lodgment among thorns or stones, as in Christian parable, might have
  been unreproductive. Summoning courage to approach expensive suite of rooms
  by door in corridor, knocked and offered to tell fortunes.
  Sahiba&mdash;glorious sahiba&mdash;fell, as Yankees have it. Secret of
  successful fortune-telling is to tell what customer intensely desires to
  hear. Was omniscient in that respect."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you told her she would marry Mr. Meldrum Strange," said Ommony,
  grinning.</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib. I said <i>he</i> will have unmerited but enviable destiny to
  marry <i>her</i>, thus disarming indignation of Charley sahib and encouraging
  her ladyship in one breath, wisdom being two-faced, looking both ways."</p>

  <p>"And she engaged you as guide?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib; as philosopher and friend, same drawing more emolument. Who
  can treat friend with parsimony, or philosopher with mistrust? Being deep in
  confidence of Rajah of Chota Pegu, knowing your honour's reputation&mdash;and
  aware by meditative process aforesaid of your honour's intention to save this
  forest from hoppers of western industry&mdash;natural gift for strategy
  overwhelmed this babu with agenda, naturally. No sleep that night. Self-made
  reservations on morning train. Self-sent cryptically worded telegram to Rajah
  of Chota Pegu, giving also letter to sahiba, same flattering him deeply and
  explaining nothing. Now am here, awaiting your honour's good will and
  cogitation."</p>

  <p>"What's your plan?"</p>

  <p>"Not having one, can't say. Put cat and dog in bag and agitate same. Fight
  ensues. Pour chemicals together. There is combination. Place parties to
  problem at strategic intervals. Game begins. It plays itself, with
  subventitious assistance from all and sundry. Desire, thou seed of Karma,
  what amusement thou providest for the gods!"</p>

  <p>"Where's Mr. Charley Wear now?" Ommony, demanded.</p>

  <p>"Escort to her loveliness. Amazing individual! He likes; he loves her not;
  whereas this babu loves her, and exceedingly dislikes her restlessness, most
  discommoding to person of portly configuration. Krishna! You should see them
  dance together in station waiting-room when trains are late! She carries
  phonograph as baggage."</p>

  <p>"Any message for me?"</p>

  <p>"As aforesaid, sahib-compliments."</p>

  <p>"Nothing else?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, compliments are all-embracing. Charley sahib, having sung your
  honour's praises, sahiba&mdash;sits and waits."</p>

  <p>"Um-m-m! Was there nothing about a promise?"</p>

  <p>"Much! Am promised old-age competency if affair of heart succeeds."</p>

  <p>Ommony's face clouded. Long familiarity had made him alert to the Indian
  trick of obliging the questioner, by strictly defining what he wants to know,
  to admit the questioned into confidence. Thereafter follows blackmail, subtle
  or crude as the case may be, but as inevitable as the day that follows
  night.</p>

  <p>"This is unsatisfactory to me," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose, too wise a strategist to fool himself, conceded a
  reverse.</p>

  <p>"There were words this babu did not understand. Incomprehension being
  cause of mystification of principles&mdash;choosing, therefore, discretion as
  better part of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Out with it! You don't have to understand a message to deliver it."</p>

  <p>"Sahiba said: 'Say this: I will be as Esther with Akazuerus!'"</p>

  <p>"Good!" remarked Ommony, and grinned again. He has a baffling kind of
  grin. "Get your gossip over with the servants," he added' sarcastically,
  "They'll be curious to know all about this."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, in <i>propria persona</i> am dumb discretion, absolutely!"</p>

  <p>"Well: if they learn anything I shall know who has told them. Barring
  that, make yourself at home."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, after light refreshment would prefer to rejoin Fountain of
  Astonishment at Chota Pegu&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ommony's laugh cut the argument short.</p>

  <p>"There's too much at stake for your personal preferences and mine to have
  any weight at all, babu. Stay here, and confer with me on my return. You
  understand me?"</p>

  <p>"Sadly!"</p>

  <p>"Disobey'and deal with me!"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, with what reluctance would I do the first! To deal with your
  honour is a privilege."</p>

  <p>"A privilege that hurts at times!" said Ommony. "All right,
  stay here and entertain yourself."</p>

  <p>Without pausing to consider what the babu might regard as entertainment,
  he returned to the verandah. "Sorry. Urgent business on the other side of the
  forest. Can you and Jeff amuse yourselves?" he asked Strange. And Strange,
  with a second tiger to his bag in mind, made departure easy.</p>

  <p>So Ommony set off on his lean grey pony at a canter, with the staghound
  careering in advance and the inevitable jungli, rag in teeth to keep the
  flies out, racing like a black phantom on foot behind. It was part of the
  honour of those naked forest men never to let out of sight the one white man
  who understood them, and whom in part&mdash;at times&mdash;they thought they
  understood too.</p>

  <p>The forest is long and wide, butt Chota Pegu lies on a promontory, as it
  where, projecting far into an ocean of trees. From Ommony's bungalow to the
  rajah's palace is hardly forty miles, although by train, including the wait
  at Sissoo Junction, the journey would take a day and a night. So it was only
  a little after one that afternoon when the sweating pony steadied to a walk
  between low houses built from the debris of ancient cities, Diana flopped
  panting in the shade of a high wall, the jungli followed suit, and Ommony,
  dismounting, hammered with the butt of his riding-whip on a gate so old that
  the iron studs had rusted themselves loose and shook as the struck wood
  quivered. There was a long pause. Then a bell rang, as it does in temples to
  announce the presence and the service&mdash;one clear note and overtones
  ascending all the way to heaven. A voice, in which a million years of
  melancholy seemed to find expression, gave an order and the flower of the
  rajah's bodyguard&mdash;four men in crimson and yellow uniform&mdash;opened
  the gate with dignity.</p>

  <p>Followed interchange of royal courtesy. Ommony, official tyrant and
  accommodating friend, stood while the army of four presented arms and a
  bare-legged man with a bugle blew a fanfare, cracked, but creditable since he
  did his best. Ommony's right hand went to his helmet-rim in the clean, curt
  fashion of the West, and then came the rigorously conventional question and
  reply between him and the turbaned officer, as to health, the crops, the
  city's peace, and the probable date of the next monsoon.</p>

  <p>It would be ascertained whether His Highness was at home and could give
  audience. Ommony was offered an ancient stool in the shade of a much more
  ancient tree, while half the army went to find out what all already knew.
  Compliments were presented&mdash;more salutes; Ommony mounted the indignant
  grey, who had earned a respite, and rode behind the army up a long drive
  between old sar trees, preceded in defiance of all convention by Diana. But
  the jungli remained in the street; as the descendant of a race that once
  ruled half the earth, such trumpery was not for him. He was afraid of it.
  Perhaps the racial memory had made him wise, as it makes wolves wise, with
  instinct. Then the palace door, wide open; but ceremony to be gone through
  first. A great umbrella trimmed with glass was raised over Ommony's head
  while he dismounted. Two menials removed his riding-boots and gave him
  embroidered slippers in their place&mdash;a great concession, for custom
  demands bare feet across the threshold. Shabby, but important men in turbans
  bowed and walked backwards before him, as the pony was led away and Ommony,
  leaving Diana at the door, entered into the cool gloom of the palace.</p>

  <p>Very little, but too much modern vandalism had crept into that back number
  of the world's volumes of changing manners. Except for some Tottenham Court
  Road furniture, ridiculously set between antiquities, the place was as it had
  been for three centuries, low-ceilinged, stately, down at heel, and
  quiet&mdash;with the quietness that the noise of a phonograph emphasized. The
  thing was playing "Alexander's Ragtime Band," and the racket emerged between
  curtains at a passage-end.</p>

  <p>On the right was the door of the durbar-hall, and Ommony was led through
  that into a room about thirty feet by twenty, lined with teak and polished.
  There was no furniture; visitors were expected to stand in the presence; but
  at one end on a red-carpeted low dais was a gilt and a red silk covered chair
  of the Napoleonic period, that served as throne. Over that was a tasselled,
  square umbrella of native embroidery.</p>

  <p>There was a pause then of at least five minutes, for sake of the
  conventions, Ommony waiting bolt upright in the midst directly in front of
  the throne, wiping the back of his neck with a handkerchief, because there
  was no punkah, and through the windows, that gave on to a deep verandah, very
  little air came in.</p>

  <p>Then pageantry awoke. A bell rang, and through a door on the right of the
  throne came the rajah and his whole official family. The rajah, without
  seeming to notice Ommony, took his seat, bowed to by all five radiantly
  dressed attendants. Two of them took position, one on either hand, each armed
  with a jewelled fan, with which they disturbed the sultry atmosphere; but the
  other three were evidently of inferior rank and did not set foot on the dais.
  They stood in line on Ommony's right hand.</p>

  <p>The men with fans whispered to the rajah, as if informing him who Ommony
  might be. He appeared interested, and at last looked up, meeting Ommony's
  gaze directly. Ommony bowed low, and the rajah nodded. He was a lean-looking,
  whimsically featured man in a yellowish silk suit adorned with a minor
  British Order (procured through Ommony's influence). His fingers were covered
  with valuable rings, but his appearance was not otherwise effeminate. He
  looked like one who practised more or less asceticism for the profit there
  might be in it, and cynicism for his own amusement&mdash;both practices
  diluted with a liberal amount of intellectual sensuousness.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are well. I am pleased to see you," he said solemnly in the
  language of the land, and the whole court of five beamed appreciation of his
  tact and condescension.</p>

  <p>Ommony replied, and for about five minutes there was rigorously regular
  exchange of question and answer, without one hint of human feeling or a word
  said that could by any possibility be construed into importance. Then:</p>

  <p>"I am glad to have seen you," said the rajah, and walked out, followed by
  the court, leaving Ommony standing; whereat he resumed the mopping with his
  handkerchief. He was used to the business&mdash;knew what would happen next.
  Some minutes later the rajah, with the jewels off and a much less ornate suit
  on, pushed his turbaned head through the door Ommony had entered by.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Ommony, old boy!" he called in English. "Are you so fond of
  ceremonial that you'll stand there forever? Let's sit under the punkah in the
  next room."</p>

  <p>They shook hands in the doorway, and Ommony submitted to be patted on the
  back.</p>

  <p>"Opportune as ever! Always in the nick of time! I've a surprise for
  you!"</p>

  <p>The phonograph tune now was "Everybody's doing it;" however, Ommony made
  ready for astonishment. There was a sound of four feet slipping on a polished
  teak floor; but the wise man, like the adder in the Bible, stops his ears to
  sounds it isn't time to hear yet. They went into a room in which comfortable
  couches and a shuttered twilight set the keynote, with lots of French novels
  scattered about, and some pictures on the walls that would have hardly passed
  the U.S. censorship.</p>

  <p>They sat down <i>vis-a-vis</i>, and the rajah lit a cigarette, waving it
  airily.</p>

  <p>"Ha&mdash;ha! Ommony, old boy, you were never more surprised in all your
  life than you're going to be! Downy old dodger! You're not the only man who
  can produce the unexpected! What do you think I've got here?"</p>

  <p>"A new elephant," suggested Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Pooh! Think again. Everybody's scandalized. My chamberlain is wondering
  whether I intend to abdicate! Now guess."</p>

  <p>"A motor-car."</p>

  <p>The rajah's face clouded a moment.</p>

  <p>"Not yet. Well, I'll tell you, for you'll never guess. A European lady of
  most exquisite breeding, looks, and attainments! She is teaching me to dance
  the two-step, and there will jolly well be a revolution in Chota Pegu if I
  don't look out! And by Jove, Ommony old boy, you know, if I could afford to I
  jolly well would abdicate. This business of being a petty rajah is no fun for
  a man of any intellect. I would like to live in Europe. Paris appeals to
  me."</p>

  <p>Ommony assumed an air of sympathy. He knew Chota Pegu's hold on ancientry,
  but understood as well that moth-lure of the City of Bright Lights, Chota
  Pegu's rajah was as obviously fooled as any moonstruck college freshman; out
  even the freshman survives the experience generally, and India has survived
  the worst her weaknesses can do to her. There would be reaction at the proper
  time.</p>

  <p>"Paris is a great place," he answered guardedly.</p>

  <p>"It is, Ommony, it is! Paris is the mother-city of intellectuals. Hah!
  They understand there the inanity of hypocritcial convention! They see
  through things&mdash;live through them, Ommony! The land of Voltaire, Pascal,
  Rousseau&mdash;and delightful women!"</p>

  <p>"Is your guest, then, a Parisienne?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"By birth, no. She is Greek&mdash;true offspring of a race that won at
  Marathon, and moulded the thinking of Rome and all Europe! She knows Paris
  inside out. We have been speaking of it. She is charming&mdash;exquisite! But
  come and see."</p>

  <p>Gesturing for silence, he tiptoed to a corner, where an ancient mirrored
  cabinet stood built into a recess in the solid wall. Searching for a key, he
  unlocked the central mirror, revealing a deep cupboard, whose back was
  nothing but the pierced carving of a wall of the room beyond. The entire room
  was visible, including a phonograph, with its back to a stand of ancient
  weapons, and Charley Wear winding it. The rajah pulled Ommony forward by the
  coat, and signed to him to peer though.</p>

  <p>"Hs&mdash;s&mdash;sh!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>Madame Zelmira Poulakis was sitting almost facing the aperture, turning
  over the pages of a guide-book on her lap, and talking over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"No, Charley, no more dancing, it's too hot. Come and help with this. I
  can't find Chota Pegu in the book; if we can't find something about it we'll
  be at the mercy of our own resources, and the fewer they are the more they'll
  confuse us. Come on. Come and help me."</p>

  <p>Nobody had too much praised her. Ommony conceded that at first glance. The
  mystery remained that she was willing to devote herself to the pursuit of
  Meldrum Strange; but the whole world is full of the unexplainable. If she was
  thirty, she did not look it. If her past was wrapped in coils of Levantine
  intrigue, no symptom of it showed. If she was unchaste, Ommony was
  unobservant. Mischief sparkled an over her, as brightly as the diamonds on
  her left hand, but amused, not venomous. If eyes are windows of the soul, as
  someone says, her merry one looked out at the universe through azure panes
  and liked it all.</p>

  <p>The rajah closed the cabinet again.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see such eyes, or lips&mdash;such hair, and such
  complexion?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Is she not all curves, and suppleness, and lightness? Did you see her
  ankles? And her wrists? Is her voice not perfect&mdash;like the waters
  laughing at you? And she has money, I imagine; her diamonds surpass mine.
  Isn't she wonderful?"</p>

  <p>Ommony agreed. It was policy; but besides, there was no use in denying the
  obvious. But he began to dread the next few days, as sure as that he stood
  there that the management of a forest and a few score men would be as child's
  play compared to partnership in an intrigue with Zelmira Poulakis.</p>

  <p>"Ommony, old boy, I'm going to ask a favour of you," said the rajah,
  buttonholing him. "She will introduce me into Parisian society. Can I go
  there? Can I afford it? Can a capital sum be raised?"</p>

  <p>"Your Highness' subjects are already taxed to about the limit," Ommony
  answered warily. Something was coming, and he did not care to nip sprouting
  information in the bud.</p>

  <p>"Yes, confound it! They're not fit to have a rajah; they can't pay for
  one! I've said that frequently. But I have forest rights, you know. It's all
  very well for you to claim control of the forest, and you've conserved it
  beautifully; but the timber revenue from all this section will have to revert
  to me when it's time to cut down trees. The shroffs* won't lend on it; they
  say there's no knowing when the Government will cut, or to what extent my
  right will be disputed. Now, don't you think, if you advised it, Government
  would buy my rights for money down?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* money-lenders]</p>

  <p>"How much?"</p>

  <p>"My rights are worth a lot&mdash;lakhs and lakhs of rupees," said the
  rajah. "I would be reasonable, on a basis of money down."</p>

  <p>All governments are capable of anything. Ommony, as an individual, is not
  to be judged by that standard. But he was no such fool as to answer outright,
  and to set the rajah dickering with shroffs again. He tickled hope, that
  springs eternal in a rajah's breast as with the rest of us.</p>

  <p>"I'll ask," he said noncommittally.</p>

  <p>"Will you? What a splendid fellow you are! How I wish all Englishmen were
  like you! Now let me do you a favour and introduce you to the most wonderful
  woman in the world."</p>

  <p>"One minute first. How is it you are entertaining her?" asked Ommony, and
  the rajah's face took on that supercilious smile with which the opportunist
  apes omniscience.</p>

  <p>"I have ways and means, old boy, that you don't dream of. Chota Pegu is
  older than the British Raj by quite a few centuries, you know. Connections
  everywhere. Wheels within wheels. You English will never understand how we
  obtain our ends. Ha&mdash;ha! No use asking her, you old fox! She doesn't
  know either! She was 'in maiden meditation fancy free', as the Psalmist or
  Shakespeare or somebody says, and a little bird whispered to her.
  Ha&mdash;ha! I knew she was coming to visit me before she thought of it!"</p>

  <p>Whereat Ommony looked puzzled, concealing his satisfaction at being in no
  way connected in the rajah's mind with Zelmira's visit.</p>

  <p>"But isn't it awfully inconvenient?" he asked. And now he was simply
  curious. The rajah's domestic worries were not even indirectly a concern of
  his. It was only by hearsay that he knew the rajah had two wives and quite a
  nice stable of dancing women; but it is always fun to speculate on how a man
  contrives to keep the peace in such complicated circumstances.</p>

  <p>"I do as I dam-please!" the rajah answered after a moment; and in the set
  lips and studied air of nonchalance was written a whole volume of
  strife-behind-curtains. But that, again, was no affair of Ommony's; he was
  merely glad to know it, since, to quote a favourite proverb of Chota Pegu,
  all straws serve the birds at nesting-time.</p>

  <p>"I'm agog to meet madame," he said, with an air of playfulness that
  overlay real dread lest Zelmira should openly confess him an accomplice.</p>

  <p>But not she! Her poise was perfect and she had evidently tutored Charley
  Wear, whose natural instinct would have been to wear his pleasure on his face
  at meeting Ommony again. Zelmira glanced at the rajah, as if to deduce from
  his her own proper attitude toward this bearded, stocky-shouldered
  individual. She did not shake hands&mdash;did not attempt to shine in
  conversation&mdash;hardly indeed looked at Ommony; it was only little by
  little, as an hour went by, that he knew he was being summed up and analysed
  from under drooped eyelashes. He confessed to himself that the girl was
  adorable, and there was an added charm of deep artfulness without any evident
  malice, that meant more to him than cupid lips or dark, delightful brows.</p>

  <p>And that while, with the rajah playing half-intoxicated host, they talked
  of all inanity, like new neighbours at someone's tea party. A spy, or an
  intruder might have guessed them all bored, except the rajah. Not the
  slightest hint was dropped until the rajah left the room, and Zelmira's face
  became instantly wreathed in smiles. She was about to say something to the
  point, but Ommony checked her.</p>

  <p>"Look annoyed!" he ordered. "You wish the rajah was here! You don't think
  much of me!"</p>

  <p>She registered, and Charley followed suit. Ommony, with forest-trained
  ears alert, was aware of the cabinet in the wall behind him being opened, and
  could almost feel the rajah's eyes making holes in the nape of his neck.</p>

  <p>"Let me show you my dog," he suggested, as if he could not think of any
  other way of entertaining; and, as if even that would be better than a dreary
  conversation with him, Zelmira jumped up with alacrity. Even so, she played
  safe.</p>

  <p>"What fun! Perhaps the rajah will come too. Hadn't we better wait for
  him?</p>

  <p>"Ommony raised his voice a trifle, and capped the safety.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "he's looking up information for me about his claims in
  regard to the forest. It'll take him fifteen minutes."</p>

  <p>With that hint for the man behind the spy-hole he led the way out, and
  they walked three abreast down the long drive, Zelmira in the midst.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk yet," said Ommony. "People's backs give more away than they
  imagine."</p>

  <p>Two hundred yards from the gate in the wall, still in sight from the
  palace windows, Ommony set fingers to his teeth and whistled shrilly.</p>

  <p>"Now watch! The wall's too high for her, but she'll try it first."</p>

  <p>Three disappointed, almost piteous barks, announced that the whistle had
  been heard.</p>

  <p>"Three shots at it," he said. "Now watch again. There's a jungli out
  there. He'll stand against the wall. She'll back across the street and take a
  running jump, using his shoulders for spingboard. Watch that space between
  the two trees."</p>

  <p>He whistled again. There was a pause, and then the hound's paw just
  appeared above the level of the wall, missed hold, and disappeared as
  suddenly. A yelp, half-angry now, another pause&mdash;then head and
  shoulders&mdash;a yelp of triumph&mdash;and the enormous dog came leaping,
  thrusting her nose into Ommony's hand and wriggling satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Ommony, "We can talk while we fool with Diana. That looks
  innocent enough."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V. &mdash; SHEEP'S BONES AND NO STRYCHNINE!</h2>

  <p class="first">Somehow, woman has come to represent temptation in the minds
  of most of us. Doubtless she earned the stigma, and we males the worse one,
  of being weak. Zelmira Poulakis, in pale mauve georgette, was art so refined
  and simplified as almost to seem divine, so that Ommony wondered whether he
  could keep his own head. As to Strange, with himself to load the scale
  clandestinely, he felt no doubt whatever.</p>

  <p>"Have you a plan?" he asked her, so well versed in Indian lore that he
  knew a woman's plan prevails in spite of anything a man can do.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she answered. "He <i>ought to marry</i> me. He ruined my
  husband."</p>

  <p>"Revenge?" asked Ommony, not relishing a campaign for that unprofitable
  stuff.</p>

  <p>"No. My husband probably deserved it. But some of my money went too, and I
  was innocent. Strange needs a wife; he never had one. He kissed me once in
  New York, when I interviewed him as my husband's emissary,
  and&mdash;well&mdash;propose to conquer him, that's all."</p>

  <p>That was frank enough. It was even credible. If money had been her sole
  aim she would never have needed to pursue Strange, limiting her scope to him.
  She was more marketable than the diamonds on her left hand, and no doubt
  scores of wealthy men had let her know it.</p>

  <p>"Conquest, eh?" said Ommony. "Yes, Strange needs conquering."</p>

  <p>"He likes me," she answered. "He is only so cruel and selfish that he
  fears marriage. But I can conquer him. I will make him generous. You'll
  see!"</p>

  <p>"Do you know what Strange will think, if he learns you are staying with
  this rajah?" Ommony asked her. "Our Indian rajahs have a certain
  reputation."</p>

  <p>"Pouf! He knows better. He might pretend to think that. He is cruel enough
  to pretend anything. But he will know it isn't true, so what does <i>that</i>
  matter? It is what one knows that influences, not what one pretends to think.
  He knows in his heart he likes me. He said&mdash;over afternoon tea in New
  York&mdash;he would choose me before any woman in the world, if he were of
  the marrying kind. I <i>am</i> of the marrying kind, and I choose him!
  Presto! That is the end of it!" And she clipped her hands, while Charley
  grinned.</p>

  <p>"Can't you have Strange come in and rescue her from the rajah?" asked
  Charley, fertile in screen-drama expedients.</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't come. He'd send for the police," laughed Ommony. "No, we must
  have <i>her</i> rescue <i>him</i>."</p>

  <p>"From the rajah?"</p>

  <p>"From anything that makes him look ridiculous."</p>

  <p>"Wise man! I like you, Mr. Ommony," Zelmira announced, her whole face
  sparkling with amusement.</p>

  <p>The best and the worst of us like to be liked, more particularly by a
  pretty woman. It gilds the edges of intrigue, and surely dulls conscience to
  the drab grey underside of human schemes. Ommony began to like his task
  amazingly. He almost forgot the forest in determination to make Meldrum
  Strange a captive of this woman's bow and spear.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd tell the rajah about Strange," he said, after making Diana
  jump over his head a time or two&mdash;for he saw the rajah coming. "Not too
  much, of course. Just say he's a millionaire who wants to buy up Indian
  forest rights. Say you've heard he is staying with me. I think we can safely
  leave the rest to Strange, the rajah, and Providence, assisted by Chullunder
  Ghose. You stumbled on a jewel in that babu. By the way&mdash;drop your
  handkerchief! Quickly!"</p>

  <p>She obeyed. Ommony signed to Diana to pick it up. The dog brought it to
  him, not to her, and Ommony put it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"If ever Di comes, look for a letter inside her collar. You can send an
  answer the same way."</p>

  <p>"Ah! That dog! That dog!" said the rajah, joining them. "A perfect beast!
  So intelligent! But someone will poison her one of these days, and then my
  friend Ommony will be disconsolate."</p>

  <p>He, too, it seemed, knew how to drop a hint. Perhaps he had seen the
  handkerchief incident, and guessed its motive. Ommony looked straight at him,
  and their eyes met.</p>

  <p>"Then someone would have a personal fight on his hands with me," he said
  blandly, and the rajah, pinked, with an effort switched attention to
  Zelmira.</p>

  <p>Ommony excused himself then, borrowed a fresh horse from the rajah's
  stable, and started back on the long cross-forest journey. After a while he
  took the jungli up behind him, jungli and dog taking turn about, the jungli
  between-whiles clinging to tail or stirrup, scouting ahead where he knew of
  leopard lairs, and not so weary as the fat horse at the journey's end, three
  hours after dark, an hour too late for dinner.</p>

  <p>Jeff was waiting in the dark by a wood-pile near the house, and the horse
  shied at him. The jungli fled.</p>

  <p>"That rascal Chullunder Ghose is up to no good," Jeff began, seizing a
  rein to hold the horse still. "Strange and I shot a tiger this morning."</p>

  <p>"Which of you?"</p>

  <p>"He wounded and I killed. We were back here for lunch. Chullunder Ghose
  was squatting on the verandah like a big brass idol. Strange began to talk to
  him. All afternoon, when he wasn't taking a nap or smoking by himself,
  Strange has been questioning the babu, and what he hasn't learned about this
  forest and one of the local rajahs&mdash;Chota Pegu, I think his name
  is&mdash;wouldn't fill a nut-shell. I couldn't prevent it."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sorry."</p>

  <p>"If I could have broken the babu's neck before he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You or I would have had to do his work. I expect he has done it
  better."</p>

  <p>"Listen. Don't be over-confident," said Jeff. "We used to employ that
  babu. He plays both ends from the middle always. Nothing he says or does is
  on the level. He'd sell you out to Strange for one rupee over and above what
  he could get from you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let's nope!"</p>

  <p>"And then double-cross Strange!"</p>

  <p>"Excellent!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I've warned you," Jeff grumbled.</p>

  <p>"Be a good fellow and keep Strange occupied while I eat dinner. I'll have
  one of the servants bring the babu to me in the dining-room."</p>

  <p>Ommony saw the horse stabled and the dog fed. Ten minutes later he was in
  the dinning-room, with Chullunder Ghose cross-legged on the floor at his
  right hand.</p>

  <p>"So you've moved without waiting for me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Lot's wife was made pillar of salt, according to Christian missionary.
  She looked back. Kaiser is in Holland, very hard up. He looked forward.
  Chinese suffer presently from foreign creditors. Stood still! Choice of three
  evils leaves enigma up to me. No advice available; no orders, except not to
  talk with servants; no consolation from Ramsden sahib, who threatens me with
  outsize boot. What can do but tickle ear of money-nabob with account of ripe
  apples in next orchard, whetting appetite of octopus for loot, which is envy
  of white man, always? What could do? Must say something! He is incarnation of
  enquiry armed with can-opener and too much zeal."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell about Madame Poulakis?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib. Told nothing this babu knows for certain. Truth is like
  saving's-bank account, for use in dire emergency. Direness not yet obvious.
  Spoke much of Rajah of Chota Pegu, intellectual gent with expensive leanings
  and no cash. Conversation turned on said aristocrat's claim to own birthright
  in enormous tract of this forest. Did mention likelihood of same being
  exchangeable, like Testament swap for mess of pottage&mdash;cash in this
  case."</p>

  <p>"How did you know about that?"</p>

  <p>"Am all things to all men, sahib. To your honour, truthfull. Was employed
  by rajah of that ilk to make rounds of Hindu moneylenders in all cities,
  offering undiscoverable title as security for long-time loan. Was not
  inundated with success, but drew personal expenses in advance."</p>

  <p>To let such a person as Chullunder Ghose into a secret on equal terms
  would have been tantamount to asking him to take advantage of it. Ommony did
  not dare even to smile, much less confess that the babu had led up to his
  hand with perfect intuition.</p>

  <p>"I gave you leave to sleep here one night," he said presently, after
  turning the problem over in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Am 'whelmed with gratitude!"</p>

  <p>"Go in the morning&mdash;at break of day&mdash;before Mr. Strange wakes
  up."</p>

  <p>"On foot? By train? To Hades?"</p>

  <p>"The Rajah of Chota Pegu's horse is in my stable. Ride across the forest
  and return the horse to its owner with my compliments."</p>

  <p>"A red one? Sahib, I know that beast! Self am not expert in equitation.
  Forest, moreover, is full of leopards, tigers, elephants, and snakes of all
  sorts! Do not know way."</p>

  <p>"I will lend you a jungli."</p>

  <p>"Who will kill and eat me! Sahib, with your honour's favour this babu will
  take train and change at Sissoo Junction."</p>

  <p>"You will leave with that horse before daybreak. You may have two
  junglis," answered Ommony. "If you fall off they will catch the horse and put
  you on again."</p>

  <p>"You do not know, sahib, what such fear means to person of unathletic
  temperament!"</p>

  <p>But Ommony did know, and knew, too, the only way short of banishment to
  keep the babu from jockeying for the upper hand of all concerned. Banishment
  was out of the question; he needed the babu's services.</p>

  <p>"You leave before daybreak on the red horse," he insisted
  unsympathetically. "Keep out of Mr. Strange's sight meanwhile."</p>

  <p>"But, sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ommony interrupted by glancing down at him. Their eyes met, and the babu
  understood. There are men who will listen to all sides of a case, but can
  never be wheedled when once they have given decision.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do, then, at Chota Pegu!"</p>

  <p>"My advice to you is to watch your step, Chullunder Ghose. I imagine your
  reward, if Madame Poulakis' plan succeeds, will be proportioned to your zeal.
  But I assure you the penalty, in case the plan fails through any treachery on
  your part, will be out of all proportion to the importance of the matter in
  hand. Let that ride through the jungle tomorrow morning be a hint to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, hint at me with a riding-whip! Take bail! Let me sign a
  stipulation before witnesses! Only not that jungle ride!"</p>

  <p>"And when you get there," Ommony went on, ignoring the babu's outburst,
  "look about you. Get to know people&mdash;as, for instance, priests. If I
  should send word to you by jungli to meet me in a certain place, why not keep
  the appointment? If the rajah asks you about Mr. Meldrum Strange, you may
  say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let me memorize your honour's wisdom!"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;whatever occurs to you as good sense at the moment. Bed now!
  There's a cot in the out-house."</p>

  <p>The babu shuffled off, his bare feet rutching on the polished floor, and
  Ommony joined his guests on the verandah. But Meldrum Strange proved
  taciturn, not even loosening his tongue under the influence of questions
  about the tiger he shot that morning. He was not diffident about having shot
  a tiger without Ommony's permission; he made that obvious. From the first he
  had challenged Ommony's right to have any say in such matters. But there was
  a new challenge noticeable in his whole demeanour. Abruptly, without apology,
  he announced his intention of retiring early, and walked off with hardly a
  muttered good night.</p>

  <p>"The old man's cooking something," Jeff said, as soon as they heard the
  bedroom door slam.</p>

  <p>"Did he overhear me speaking to the babu?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't care what he cooks. He'll choke on it!"</p>

  <p>"Pity I didn't choke him yesterday!" Jeff grumbled. "Strange is no fool
  when it comes to business. All the way home this morning, after we slot the
  tiger, he was telling me what a magnificent property this forest is. He has
  made up his mind to have it. That beastly babu has told him how to get it.
  All he's wondering now is how to meet the Rajah of Chota Pegu without
  arousing your suspicion."</p>

  <p>"That's all arranged," said Ommony. "If I know Chota Pegu he'll be here
  soon after breakfast with his best horse foundered under him. I shan't be
  here. This is the order of the day: Chullunder Ghose rides away before it's
  light. In all likelihood he'll meet the rajah and have word with him. I leave
  an hour later. If I chance to meet the rajah I'll have word with him too. You
  see him next, and leave him alone with Meldrum Strange. They'll cook up
  something or other between them; and there's nothing we can do until we find
  out what that is. There's only one point to be careful on: are you sure the
  babu didn't tell Strange about Madame Poulakis?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty sure. Strange would have blown up if he had told."</p>

  <p>"If the rajah says anything to you about her&mdash;I expect he
  won't&mdash;just warn him that's a dangerous subject. If Strange once learns
  she's near&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He'll run! He'll run like the wind!" said Ramsden.</p>

  <p>"Why is he so afraid of her?"</p>

  <p>"He's afraid of himself. He likes her too well. He's afraid of the papers.
  If he should marry her, they'd dig up the scandal about her first husband in
  Egypt&mdash;scareheads, and a full page in the Sunday supplement. He's afraid
  the scandal might be made to stick to him. If she wins, Ommony, I'll stick to
  Strange; he'll be worth it, with her to take the brute out of him. He has
  imagination, brains, and a kind of courage. She'll give him a heart."</p>

  <p>Ommony turned in and lay awake until after midnight, tossing and retossing
  the problem over in his mind. He was aware of Strange doing the same thing in
  the next room&mdash;brain against brain, greed against conservation,
  selfishness against a life devoted to the trees. But the odds were in favour
  of Ommony, and he fell asleep first. Fate's dice, he felt, were loaded
  against the millionaire.</p>

  <p>He was awakened long before dawn by Strange calling to Jeff Ramsden. Jeff
  came from his tent in pyjamas to sit on Strange's bed, and for a while there
  was only audible an irregular jumble of explosions from Strange and Jeff's
  deep mono-syllabic answers. But once he caught words:</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go straight to headquarters and have it out with the
  Government, if you want the forest?" Jeff insisted.</p>

  <p>"Don't be an ass! They'd listen to him, not me. Whatever I offered, they'd
  think they might get more. Odds are, they'd call in competition. Parcel it
  out in the end to coolie contractors. This has got to be done
  quietly&mdash;jockey 'em into a false position&mdash;crowd 'em to the rails,
  and walk away with it. Ommony's a fanatic. You can't buy or bulldose his
  sort. Nothing to do but beat 'em to it."</p>

  <p>"Well: I've told you what I think," Jeff answered.</p>

  <p>"You think with your biceps! You've a head that 'ud make first class
  <i>wienerwurst</i>!"</p>

  <p>Ommony fell asleep again. But he was up before dawn, helping Chullunder
  Ghose to mount the red horse, charging two junglis to deliver the babu safely
  at Chota Pegu, and seeing to it that they started off by the back way, behind
  the house, out of sight from Strange's bedroom window. He breakfasted alone,
  and was on the way himself less than an hour later, leaving only one horse in
  the stable, and no chance for Destiny to missfire, because that one horse was
  so sore-backed from carrying Jeff's weight that none could ride him. Strange,
  who disliked walking, would have to stay near the house that morning. Ommony,
  too, took the trail for Chota Pegu, but in no hurry. He had all the dogs with
  him&mdash;a sure sign he was out on no forty-mile journey. At the foot of the
  look-out rock he tethered the horse, with a couple of junglis close at hand
  to watch for leopards, then climbed the obelisk-like rock, and waited,
  turning a pair of field-glasses at intervals on the face of a bare hill, over
  whose rock-strewn summit the track to Chota Pegu zigzagged not many miles
  away.</p>

  <p>It was an hour and a half before he saw a horseman hurrying along like an
  insect, downward among the distant rocks. Then it occurred to him there was
  another trail available to a man in a great hurry who knew the forest well.
  He called down to the junglis, and one of them started away through the trees
  like a phantom, followed by Diana and the other dogs. (Hereditary junglis are
  as dirt beneath the feet of an hereditary prince; but a white man's dogs are
  not to be despised.) In course he heard barking&mdash;Diana's echoing bell,
  and the yap-yap of the others. Then Diana came streaking down the lane with
  filtered sunlight poured on her between the trees, so that she looked like a
  golden god-thing. She climbed in a hundred leaps, and lay down panting,
  making no remark. There was nothing untoward. But the yap-yap of the other
  two continued, coming nearer, with now and then an angry shout from someone
  who, perhaps would rather not have his exact location known. Ommony pulled
  tobacco out, and lit his pipe. The gradually closing view of Destiny
  contented him.</p>

  <p>Two dogs, belligerent and pausing every now and then to yelp another
  challenge, galloped into sight, climbed the rock, and lay down gasping beside
  Diana. The drumming of hoofs pursued them. In a minute more the Rajah of
  Chota Pegu reined in a sweating stallion, whose legs were trembling, glanced
  at Ommony's tied horse, looked up, and nodded angrily.</p>

  <p>"Keep your dogs chained!" he shouted. "Why don't you thrash your junglis
  oftener? I'll kill the next beast that gets in my way! Damn them! They drove
  me like a buffalo at milking-time! Get some decent dogs, why can't you!"</p>

  <p>"Come up, and rest your horse," called Ommony. "Why blame the dogs for
  good luck? We might have missed each other."</p>

  <p>Soft answers turn away wrath sometimes. They usually turn violence into
  vehemence. Occasionally they take all the wind out of a man's sails,
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Were you expecting me?" the rajah asked; and his voice betrayed him. He
  had hoped to get in touch with Strange before Ommony could forewarn or
  prevent. Now he was wondering how Ommony could possibly have divined his
  purpose. He was bewildered. He felt like one who sees the rum of his
  calculations.</p>

  <p>"I'm merely delighted to see you," Ommony answered. "Come on up."</p>

  <p>So the rajah hitched his horse beside Ommony's, and climbed slowly,
  turning matters over in his mind. He had to make some excuse for being there,
  at that early hour, on a horse so obviously foundered, some excuse that could
  not compromise him.</p>

  <p>"Have a seat," suggested Ommony; and the rajah produced a cigarette, after
  one enquiring glance into Ommony's eyes, East studying West and learning
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"What's your rush?" Ommony asked, knocking his pipe on the rock and
  refilling it.</p>

  <p>The rajah hesitated. How much had Ommony guessed? He had to answer
  something.</p>

  <p>"Madame Poulakis told me of an American millionaire staying at your
  place," he said at last. "She heard of him yesterday from you. I've never
  seen one of the breed, and I'm curious."</p>

  <p>"Almost eager," ventured Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I propose to invite him to call on me before she goes away. She can
  help entertain him."</p>

  <p>He knew how lame his excuse had sounded, and waited for Ommony to provide
  him a better cue, but Ommony was leading, not following suit.</p>

  <p>"Did you meet anyone on the way?" he asked, with eyes averted. (If he had
  wanted the rajah to lie he would have looked straight at him and forced the
  pace.)</p>

  <p>The rajah thought rapidly, and saw no sense in an evasion. "Only a babu,
  bringing back the horse I lent you yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Have word with him?"</p>

  <p>The rajah thought again. He thought so long that the answer to the
  question became obvious.</p>

  <p>"We spoke. He's a man I have trusted on occasion. Is he in your
  confidence?"</p>

  <p>"God forbid!" said Ommony, grinning.</p>

  <p>The rajah looked relieved, but it did not last long. Elbows on knees,
  pointing the stem of his pipe at him, Ommony cleared the issue and clouded it
  in one breath.</p>

  <p>"See here," he said quietly, Dutch-uncle fashion. "If you want to meet
  Meldrum Strange there's no objection. He's a free man; you're a rajah.
  But&mdash;if you propose to do business with him&mdash;anything along the
  lines you hinted to me yesterday&mdash;count me against you. Understand? I
  don't want Strange owning any of this forest&mdash;don't want him owning even
  a doubtful claim to a reversionary interest. Are we clear as to that?"</p>

  <p>The rajah nodded angrily.</p>

  <p>"They are my personal private rights," he retorted.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Ommony. "Then you do as you personally, privately jolly
  well please with them. But count me out. I refuse my official backing."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Hah! I understand. Unofficially&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unofficially I give you this advice. If you let Meldrum Strange know
  Madame Poulakis is at your place he'll stay away."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. You saved me then from a mistake. Aha! Downy old dodger! I see
  through you! Officially unbending, eh? Unofficially hoping, isn't that it?"
  He slapped Ommony on the thigh in the well-known fashion of the hale and
  hearty West (as per instruction book of Western manners).</p>

  <p>"Tell me: what kind of man is this Strange to deal with?"</p>

  <p>"Hard," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Subtle?"</p>

  <p>"No. Crushes like a python."</p>

  <p>"Slow?"</p>

  <p>"Quick, I should say, when he makes his mind up."</p>

  <p>"Greedy?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely."</p>

  <p>"Cautious?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What is his weakness?"</p>

  <p>"Dread of publicity."</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>There was silence for about a minute, in which Ommony would have given a
  year's pay for the gift of reading what was in the rajah's mind. At the end
  of it the rajah stood up, straightened himself, and salaamed to the dogs with
  both hands.</p>

  <p>"I apologize!" he said, with a big grin. "You saved a <i>faux pas</i>. You
  brought me to the fount of wisdom. When you visit me there shall be sheep's
  bones&mdash;and no strychnine!"</p>

  <p>He waved his hand jauntily, and started down the rock, awkwardly because
  of long spurs. Half-way down he turned and called back:</p>

  <p>"Downy old dodger! After this you will retire, of course! I will meet you
  in Paris!"</p>

  <p>Ommony ignored the innuendo. In India a man grows used to
  misinterpretation of his motives. Even if he could have proved, black on
  white, that Strange had not bribed him, the rajah would have continued
  unconvinced.</p>

  <p>"Don't take my horse," he warned. "That bay's an old friend."</p>

  <p>"A <i>very</i> old one&mdash;yet fresher than mine!"</p>

  <p>"I won't have him ill-treated."</p>

  <p>"Pooh! Use him for tiger-bait! That is all he is fit for!"</p>

  <p>Ten minutes earlier the rajah would have deemed it dangerous to jest in
  that strain. Now he judged himself a sharer of Ommony's guilty secret, with
  privileges accordingly. But Ommony relit his pipe and watched him canter away
  without letting that disturb him. Nothing need disturb a man, except his
  enemy find out the truth; the more lies for the enemy to lose himself among
  the better.</p>

  <p>Presently he came down off the rock and rode his rounds as if the day's
  work in the forest were his sole concern. There was a new fire-lane
  a-cutting; and he superintended that, contriving to let the hours slip by
  without any underlings observing that le was simply squandering time. It was
  high noon before he headed homeward, and met Jeff Ramsden waiting for him at
  the lane end, near the house.</p>

  <p>"They've put you on ice;" said Jeff. "The rajah has been here all morning,
  and the poor fool thinks he can outwit Strange."</p>

  <p>"I think he can, too! grinned Ommony.</p>

  <p>"He has offered to sell Strange his rights in the forest."</p>

  <p>"Has money changed hands?"</p>

  <p>"No, but the rajah has suggested you're corruptible!"</p>

  <p>"I am!"</p>

  <p>Jeff's ponderous shape encloses an unsubtle mind that detests even the
  suggestion of dishonesty.</p>

  <p>"I could have smashed the brute for hinting it!"</p>

  <p>"What did the rajah say, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing definite. When Strange suggested that you might have objections,
  the brute answered by moving his hand like this, and smiling."</p>

  <p>"And Strange?"</p>

  <p>"Saw a great light suddenly! It dawned on him the cheque-book was the key
  to your position."</p>

  <p>"So it is!"</p>

  <p>"I'm an at sea," said Jeff. "Are you joking?"</p>

  <p>"No. I intend to raid Strange's bank account as surely as he means to raid
  my forest. Old fellow, I have sold my soul for a promise by Zelmira
  Poulakis," said Ommony, grinning. "The forests must redeem me. Out of
  corruption shall come forth trees&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This is over my head," Jeff grumbled.</p>

  <p>"So shall the trees be in time!"</p>

  <p>"Ommony, I warn you: Strange has teeth! Take his money on his terms, and
  he'll grind you to the ground. Many a man has rued the day he took
  a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jeff hesitated. Ommony filled in the word.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;a bribe from him? I'll take blood-money. He and the
  rajah&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They're thick as thieves," said Jeff.</p>

  <p>"Thick or thick-headed?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Strange is playing with fire made of ennui, debt, and the lure of a gay
  city, He'll burn his fingers, Jeff, and come to me for salve and bandages.
  You wait and see."</p>

  <p>"I know Strange, and you don't," Jeff answered dubiously.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>VI. &mdash; "C.O. TO Z.P. Z.P. TO C.O."</h2>

  <p class="first">"C.O. to Z.P. Hold the fort. Let nothing persuade you to
  leave the palace until further advice from me. Be sick if necessary. Please
  feed the dog before sending her back."</p>

  <p>In the small, file-littered office behind his bedroom Ommony folded the
  slip of paper and tucked it under the leather loop inside Diana's collar.
  Then he pulled out Zelmira's handkerchief and let the hound smell the vague,
  unusual scent.</p>

  <p>"Go quick!" he ordered.</p>

  <p>The hound's tail drooped. She detested errands so far away from Ommony,
  but was too well used to them to hesitate. As if she had been reproved she
  drew her tail tight under her and slunk out, but broke into a trot the moment
  she left the house, and within the minute was extended in the long, elastic
  canter she could hold all day.</p>

  <p>Ommony had begun to see daylight through the words; but the rajah was in a
  quandary. He stayed to lunch, and used every artifice he could invent for
  decoying Ommony into a <i>tte--tte</i>. But that astute individual
  purposed neither to advise him further nor to arouse suspicion by refusing.
  He could not even be tempted into a corner by the sight of a new, gold-plated
  pistol. He was depending on Destiny, in league with the fire "made of ennui,
  debt, and the lure of a gay city." Prodding at Destiny impatiently is apt to
  bring the importunist down under the flaming wheels, so his artifices for
  avoiding private conversation were better invented than the rajah's for
  procuring it. Even the excuse that the stallion was unfit for the journey
  home availed nothing; while the beast was resting Ommony employed himself
  among the new plantations on his own horse, and in the end the rajah had to
  ride away on the stallion uncomforted by wisdom from his host.</p>

  <p>Then Ommony took tea on the verandah, under the guns of Strange's arrogant
  contempt.</p>

  <p>"That stuff's the undoing of the English!" Strange volunteered. "They sip
  tea like old women&mdash;even in the Bank of England. It's the symbol of
  England's decadence."</p>

  <p>"You think we've fallen far yet?" Ommony asked him.</p>

  <p>Strange snorted. "You're succumbing to the same degeneracy you've imposed
  on conquered Peoples&mdash;just as Rome did. That rajah's a case for you.
  Intelligent in a superficial way, like a monkey. I don't doubt his ancestors
  were <i>men</i>, who could seize, administer, and keep; they'd know enough to
  rule. That fellow's delighted like a child with a new toy
  pistol&mdash;spineless&mdash;no initiative; he's a product of afternoon tea
  and English education!"</p>

  <p>The light back of Ommony's eyes was of a deeper amusement than the
  outburst seemed to warrant. But Strange by habit scorned the men he proposed
  to have the better of, and the strongest are blind when in that mood. It is
  on written record in Millsville, N.H., that Meldrum Strange at fourteen was
  turned out of Sunday school for insisting that, if he had been Goliath, not
  only would he have crushed David at long range with a big rock, but that he
  would have been right to do it.</p>

  <p>"I hate to see the world stand still. Progress!" he insisted. "'That's the
  proper keynote. Progress!"</p>

  <p>After dinner that evening he resumed the topic. He was still laying law
  down, lecturing Ommony on the proper use of opportunity, when Diana slunk up
  through the shadows to the verandah and lay down at Ommony's feet. She was so
  quiet that not even Jeff observed her. The other dogs took no notice. Ommony
  slid his hand down to feel for a message in the loop under the collar, found
  what he expected, snatched it out, and shouted in Tamil:</p>

  <p>"Boy! Bring the flashlight!"</p>

  <p>"Care to come, Jeff?" he asked, explaining nothing, but leading the dog by
  the collar, away from Strange, around the corner of the verandah to where a
  side-door, seldom used, provided access near the bathroom. The servant
  brought the flashlight.</p>

  <p>"Warm water in a hurry!" Ommony commanded.</p>

  <p>"Blood!" said Jeff, fingering the dog's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I thought at first it was a blow from a leopard," said Ommony, "but you
  see, there's a hole in here and out there. It must have left off bleeding
  some time ago. No serious damage. Hurts her, though."</p>

  <p>Diana whimpered as Ommony fingered the loose skin above her powerful
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Bullet undoubtedly," said Jeff.</p>

  <p>"Might be a 32. Did you notice a weapon of that bore this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"The rajah's gold-plated toy!"</p>

  <p>"Exactly! Nobody else anywhere near this forest owns a 32. That rascally
  rajah suspected her of carrying a message; Diana's notorious, ain't you, old
  lady! And he's a good shot with a pistol, damn his eyes!"</p>

  <p>"It was a close call for the dog," said Jeff, examining the wound.</p>

  <p>"As close for me, I think! Let's see what the message says."</p>

  <p>He read it by the bathroom night-lamp, holding Diana with one hand to keep
  her quiet, while the servant held the flashlight and Jeff syringed out the
  wound, the dog whimpering.</p>

  <p>"Z.P. to C.O. Am sitting tight. Chullunder Ghose met him in forest and
  told about Strange liking to shoot tigers. Chullunder Ghose says that may
  open Panch Mahal, but I don't understand what he means. Will be very sick if
  necessary. Please meet Charley at noon to-morrow at the lookout rock. He will
  ride the horse you left here. Chullunder Ghose says the rajah has no funds.
  Shall I lend?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, no!" said Ommony, so that Jeff looked up, whereat Ommony took the
  scissors and clipped carefully.</p>

  <p>"There, old lady; you'll be all right in a few days."</p>

  <p>He stuffed the note in his pocket and scratched his chin, grinning. "It
  beats the Dutch," he said, "the way Dave Destiny arranges things. Strange
  goes from here to the Panch Mahal. That's a little old-fashioned palace
  twenty miles from Chota Pegu, where rajahs hold high revel on occasion. It
  means 'the play-place of the ladies.'"</p>

  <p>"Gosh!" said Jeff.</p>

  <p>"Two tuts! The tiger-shooting's often very good there. Caretakers have
  kept the place from ruin, but it hasn't been used often in the last ten
  years."</p>

  <p>"Any personal risk to Strange?" Jeff asked, acutely conscious of being on
  Strange's pay-roll.</p>

  <p>"Prodigious, I should say it means Zelmira marries him!"</p>

  <p>In spite of his quarrelsome mood Strange presently wearied of sitting
  alone, and came blustering in to see what they were doing. Diana, in no sweet
  mood herself, showed him a glimpse of her fangs.</p>

  <p>"Place looks like a butcher-shop!" he snorted, and blustered out
  again.</p>

  <p>"Thought so!" said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Thought what?"</p>

  <p>"I have what you'd call the dope on him. Men who want to save the world by
  system and tyranny are all alike. Everything's impersonal until it applies to
  him personally&mdash;blood in a bathroom included."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. That's why I'd rather resign and then like him!" said Jeff. "Do
  him good!"</p>

  <p>"No. Save him for Zelmira! That's <i>her</i> job. Besides, you see, she
  has bought my soul!" Ommony answered, grinning his pleasantest.</p>

  <p>Jeff had utterly ceased to enjoy his visit. A stickler for loyalty all his
  life long, he hated to lend a hand against Strange, but hated at least
  equally the thought of Strange accepting Ommony's hospitality and using the
  man's very roof as a cover for intrigue. Ommony's loyalty to the forest and
  the job appealed to Jeff; Strange's greed and arrogance disgusted him; but
  worse than either, he despised himself for not knowing what to do about it.
  Ommony divined the situation pretty accurately.</p>

  <p>"Are Strange's love-affairs your business?" he asked, cleaning out the
  syringe.</p>

  <p>"No, and, by Gad, I'm not his valet!"</p>

  <p>"What is your job?"</p>

  <p>"I'm his partner in business&mdash;salaried partner. He owns control and
  can vote me out any time he sees fit."</p>

  <p>"Stick to business, then."</p>

  <p>"I'll have to warn him to pull out of this, then."</p>

  <p>Ommony grinned again. "I wish you would! If you'll stick strictly to
  business, and leave him to paddle his love canoe, there'll be no
  accidents."</p>

  <p>So Jeff recovered his good-humour, and when bedtime came he followed
  Strange into his room and sat there for an hour, while Ommony, remaining with
  his pipe on the verandah, caught fragments of a violent debate, in between
  the pauses of his own conversation with two men, who wore no clothes, and did
  not trespass on to the verandah, but spoke like dark goblins from the shadow
  beyond the flower-bed.</p>

  <p>"You're a natural born employee! You can't see things on a big scale!"</p>

  <p>"I see more than you imagine! I'm warning you."</p>

  <p>"You've osseous formations on the occiput! Bone and beef aren't brain! How
  d'you suppose I made millions? By being afraid of things? You and this man
  Ommony would make a pair in double harness! Go to bed."</p>

  <p>"All right. I've said my say, and you won't listen. I tell you again,
  you're wrong. D'you want my resignation?"</p>

  <p>"No, you ass! When I want that I'll tell you quick enough. You're a
  first-class detail man&mdash;a perfect child when it comes to visualizing.
  Turn in and sleep off your fears!"</p>

  <p>Jeff came glooming out on the way to his tent, and sat down for a minute
  beside Ommony; and once again, as the pipe-ash glowed and dimmed, Ommony
  divined the wise remark to offer:</p>

  <p>"You see, you're a bit too big to quit in the middle of it all. I've
  depended on you all along to go to the Panch Mahal with Strange and see him
  through it."</p>

  <p>"I'm dumb from now on!" Jeff retorted, and, shoving his pipe in his
  pocket, strode discontentedly to bed. Ommony sat still on the verandah for
  half an hour, chuckling at intervals.</p>

  <p>Next morning only the servants saw him, for he breakfasted alone, and
  thereafter rode to the new plantations, superintending precautions against
  drought until it was nearly noon and time to keep the appointment with
  Charley Wear. He was seated up on the look-out rock when Charley came
  galloping down the glade, and Charley, squinting at lights and half-lights,
  climbed up to sit beside him.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid you wouldn't get the message," Charley began, when lie had
  his breath. "The rajah said he saw your dog limping along as if someone had
  shot her. He sent out men to hunt for anyone with a firearm who might have
  done it.</p>

  <p>"In America you call that 'bull,'" Ommony answered. "Here it's known as
  eye-wash. He shot the dog, but she got home."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>Ommony whistled. Two black, naked shadows emerged from the trees and stood
  bathed in the sun.</p>

  <p>"Those men saw it. They came last night and told me."</p>

  <p>He whistled again and the junglis disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Well I'm damned!" muttered Charley.</p>

  <p>"No. The rajah is. It's too bad poor old Di got hurt, but she'll recover,
  and the rajah won't. For doing that, he shall have his own way and go to
  Paris, where the last state of that rajah will be worse than the first. Do
  you know Paris, Charley? There are professionals there, male and female, who
  can squeeze a rajah dry in shorter time than it takes you and me to squeeze a
  lemon. Thereafter, the ash-heap! He's a nuisance here."</p>

  <p>"Too bad, it'll be his subjects' money."</p>

  <p>"No. Strange's money!"</p>

  <p>"I don't get you."</p>

  <p>"Strange will! And Zelmira will get him, if she plays her hand wisely.
  There's only one link missing now. What did you come to talk to me
  about?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing serious," said Charley. "There's a box on the way from Delhi,
  addressed to me in your care. Do you mind paying the charges on it and
  arranging for me to get it somehow?"</p>

  <p>Ommony filled his pipe and lit it carefully before he answered. He likes
  to suppress excitement. He crowded it down the way he put tobacco in, making
  sure none protruded.</p>

  <p>"I believe I'll be delighted," he said then. "Is it bad manners to ask
  what's in the box?"</p>

  <p>"My motion picture outfit."</p>

  <p>"Any film?"</p>

  <p>"Scads of it."</p>

  <p>Ommony's outgoing breath, smoke-burdened, bore a prayer of thanks into the
  Infinite.</p>

  <p>"The last link! Charley, you shall have that box if I have to set it on my
  own head, and carry it on foot, alone, all the way across the forest to Chota
  Pegu! What did the gods look like who put that thought into your head?"</p>

  <p>"She's a goddess. Zelmira had me send for before he left Delhi," Charley
  answered. "She's as mad about movies as the rest of 'em."</p>

  <p>"Whom attack hath made mad let none offend!" answered Ommony, piously
  quoting Scripture.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-07"
     id="ch-07"></a>VII. &mdash; KEY TO DESTINY!</h2>

  <p class="first">There were days after that when Strange fretted, and the
  problem was to distract him from a too quick move that might have been
  equally advantageous for Ommony, who held all trumps, but none the less fatal
  to Zelmira Poulakis. And Ommony considered her his partner now, to be
  considered only less than the forest.</p>

  <p>The old disease that had rioted unchecked in Strange for forty years,
  lulled for a while by his now great scheme to be the world's arch-sleuth, had
  broken out anew with threefold virulence.</p>

  <p>Attain! Acquire! Possess! Exploit! Then on to something else! It boiled in
  his veins&mdash;set his brain on fire. It was all so easy! All a man needed
  was the money and initiative&mdash;that, and the gift of recognizing
  opportunity.</p>

  <p>The only immediate outlet for his surging energy was the forest, so he
  began to butcher game. The slaughtered buck meant no more to him than
  yesterday when it is past. Blood-lust was not in him. He recoiled from
  carcases, cared nothing for the trophies, only ached to demonstrate his own
  ability and feel the power that fed. Blood on his hands disgusted him; it was
  all too personal. When his clothes were soiled he changed them, and returned
  for more hunting. He was not cruel in the ordinary sense; he killed clean, or
  when he failed to kill, kept after the wounded beast until he had it. But the
  power to kill was his, and he used it, stoking the fires beneath that other
  power, to have, that he intended to use too.</p>

  <p>Jeff protested on occasion, for he was a big-game hunter born.</p>

  <p>"If I don't, someone will," Strange answered. "Life's like that. Take, or
  it shall be taken from you, even that which you have. I've neglected this
  part of my education. You've neglected business. The result is I've got
  millions to your thousands, but you're the better shot. I'll learn this. You
  cultivate your head!"</p>

  <p>Ommony knew what was going on, but had no time to interfere, not much
  inclination. The game had to be sacrificed on the forest altar. Nature, left
  alone, would restore the balance presently. He had the big victory to plan
  for. This butchery was an affair of outposts, not beneath his notice, but
  insufficient to distract him from the main plan. However, it did not reduce
  his grim determination to make the ultimate defeat of Meldrum Strange a rout,
  and if he once had thought of offering quarter, that sweet reasonableness
  vanished. The devil, that in varying percentage lives in every human, had
  Cottswold Ommony by the heart-strings; nor was its grip loosened in the least
  by knowledge that Strange had sent to Bombay for money in large quantities,
  and that the money had arrived.</p>

  <p>So he himself sent a telegram, and then rode to interview the rajah; but
  this time instead of waiting at the outer gate for the usual rigmarole, he
  sent in a note, and rode away to a clearing near the forest edge, where the
  masonry of an ancient well was crumbling to decay. There he dismounted and
  waited, peering curiously into and around the well, as if he had expected
  something, and presently was satisfied. He did not wait long; there was that
  in his note that had not suggested dalliance.</p>

  <p>The rajah came cantering, and drew rein just in sight of him, then
  advanced at a walk, endeavouring to look at ease with all the world and his
  own thoughts. The result was an absurd mixture of nerves and indifference,
  whose effect was heightened by the extravagant gesture with which he threw
  away a half-smoked cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Shall we ride together?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Sit here," said Ommony, laying his hand on the stonework of the ruined
  well.</p>

  <p>The rajah immensely disliked receiving orders, but an open quarrel would
  have been no convenient thing to have on hand at that crisis of his affairs;
  he dismounted with an ill grace, threw his reins over a tree-stump, and sat
  down with arms folded.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked. "What?"</p>

  <p>"Have you your pistol with you?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You're mistaken. It's in that side pocket."</p>

  <p>The rajah muttered an exclamation. It was easy enough to guess what he
  would have liked to do.</p>

  <p>"Huh! My servant put it there, eh? The fool must have thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"May I see it?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>There was no alternative. As resentfully as a boy caught stealing apples,
  the rajah produced the gold-plated thing butt-end first. Ommony took it,
  glanced at it, and dropped it down the well, with his other hand preventing
  the rajah from peering down after it. The well must have been either deep or
  empty. There came no sound of the pistol's reaching bottom.</p>

  <p>"You won't shoot any dog again with that, at all events."</p>

  <p>"I did nothing of the kind&mdash;",</p>

  <p>"I have the dog to prove it, and two witnesses. Shall we ask the dog to
  settle the point? She's not fit to run yet, but I can have her carried over;
  or you may come to my place, and we'll know in a minute who's telling the
  truth."</p>

  <p>The rajah showed his teeth and chewed the end of his moustache. Then he
  glanced to right and left. There were no witnesses.</p>

  <p>"The beast was being used to carry messages from spies on me!" he snarled.
  "How dare you do that!" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I dare worse. I dare charge you with plotting to sell this forest to
  Meldrum Strange without so much as notifying the Government of your
  intention! But be satisfied with throwing your pistol down the well,
  provided!"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Provided you're reasonable, too."</p>

  <p>The rajah glanced to right and left again. The only audience was the
  horses. Rage had him by the throat, but princes in these drab, degenerate
  days are worse off than beggars, in that a beggar need have no master. He
  choked the rage down with an effort, and forced a smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, all right then, we're quits. I did shoot your infernal dog, and
  that well's deep, confound you! But look here, Ommony, old boy, I must have
  money, and the shroffs won't lend."</p>

  <p>"I understand you've told Strange I'm corruptible," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>The rajah glared.</p>

  <p>"He told you that?" He lies! He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, he didn't lie."</p>

  <p>The enemy's mistakes win the victor's battle. The astonishing thought that
  Strange (not Ramsden) had betrayed him to Ommony more unmanned the rajah than
  a thrashing would have done; and Ommony was quick to seize advantage.</p>

  <p>"What a fool you are to trust a stranger and betray an old friend," he
  said indignantly. "I've been your friend through thick and thin! I've backed
  you against the priests, against the central government, against your
  creditors&mdash;against your&mdash;self! You've never set a foot wrong when
  you listened to me. Your revenue is nearly double what it was. You've
  received a coveted honour on my recommendation. You know as well as I do that
  my one concern is this forest. And you reward friendship by trying to undo my
  life's work! What do you think would happen if Strange should ever get a
  foothold here?"</p>

  <p>Now the rajah traced his ancestry so far back into the dawn of time, and
  was so inbred (lest the royal strain should be defiled), that European kings
  were vulgar riff-raff by comparison. And that is a condition that begets a
  point of view. The ancientry arose within him.</p>

  <p>"What do I care? Who are you, you foreigner!" he snorted, "to come here
  and meddle? The land and the forest are mine&mdash;you hear me? mine! You
  English are thieves, that's all&mdash;thieves who will be kicked out
  presently, those of you who are not dead with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With our boots on," Ommony suggested. "Let's not worry about after that.
  Until then, is the problem. Until the Powers hoist my number I'm forest
  guardian, and you've me to deal with. Now then. What are you going to
  do?"</p>

  <p>The rajah confessed to himself, at any rate, that he did not know, and his
  face told Ommony the tale. That is a state of mind that jumps at ready-made
  solutions.</p>

  <p>"What you thought of doing was to sell to Meldrum Strange alleged forest
  rights, that are doubtful, to put it mildly, and to leave him to fight
  through the courts for the title. That's dishonest. Why don't you sell him
  something you do own?"</p>

  <p>"For instance?"</p>

  <p>"Do you own the Panch Mahal?"</p>

  <p>The rajah scowled. That was another property on which the shroffs would
  not lend one rupee, not because the rajah's heritage was doubtful, but
  because the priests of the temple of Siva in Chota Pegu claimed a lien on it.
  There was no pretence of its being a legal lien, only one of those
  theoretical and subtly enforced claims that the Church in all ages and all
  climes has maintained irresistibly.</p>

  <p>"You know what the priests say."</p>

  <p>"What can they do?" demanded Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Dogs! I won't go near them! They avoid my court. They set the rabble
  against me. They have me hooted in the streets. They deny me caste. I will
  make no overtures to that swarm of cankering worms!"</p>

  <p>Pride of that sort is impregnable by direct assault, but more susceptible
  to flank attack than an over-extended speculator.</p>

  <p>"Chullunder Ghose has no pride," Ommony remarked, as if to the blue sky,
  apropos of nothing.</p>

  <p>That set the rajah thinking on a new line. He would have loved to cheat
  the priests&mdash;to double-cross and laugh at them; but he did not dare
  attempt that; the priests' power is too subtle and far-reaching, as well as
  ruthless. Pride, that is sweeter than success, restrained him from an open
  bargain with them. Poverty&mdash;extravagance&mdash;the distant lights of La
  Ville Lumiere impelled. Chullunder Ghose was a rogue with brains, who would
  serve any master who paid him well enough. Strange vs. Priests of Siva would
  be a game worth while for the Pantheon of Heaven to come and watch!</p>

  <p>Ommony, watching the rajah as a salesman studies his prospect, judged his
  time and struck.</p>

  <p>"I'm against Strange," he said frankly, leaning back against the masonry
  with both hands in his pockets. "You'd better sell him the Panch Mahal, and
  stick to your old friends."</p>

  <p>"Will you not prevent my selling him the Panch Mahal?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?"</p>

  <p>"Will you help me against the priests?"</p>

  <p>"It's against British policy to interfere in religious matters. You must
  manage them yourself. Perhaps the priests may make first overtures. They're
  omniscient, you know. They read thoughts. They're always forehanded. You
  won't have to eat humble-pie if they come to you first."</p>

  <p>"I must think this over." said the rajah.</p>

  <p>"Do."</p>

  <p>"And Madame Poulakis?"</p>

  <p>"For the moment leave her out of it."</p>

  <p>"How can I? She is becoming a nuisance. I cannot invite Strange to the
  palace while she is there, and she has begun to have sick headaches. She
  complains she is too unwell to travel."</p>

  <p>"Keep Strange away, then. Take him to the Panch Mahal."</p>

  <p>"But I can't go away and leave her in the palace."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"It is unthinkable."</p>

  <p>"Try to think it. She's a gentlewoman. You can't be rude to her."</p>

  <p>The rajah hesitated, then took two steps and stood in front of Ommony with
  arms folded.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what she is doing here!" he said. "Chullunder Ghose persuaded me
  I might reap advantage from her visit. Whenever I ask her why she came, she
  laughs; and the babu swears he's afraid to tell what her business is. Am I
  being made a catspaw in some scheme?"</p>

  <p>"I'd let the babu manage that, if I were you."</p>

  <p>"That rascal!"</p>

  <p>"You took his advice in the first place. Carry on! You've never failed
  when you took my advice. Go home and think it over!"</p>

  <p>The rajah snapped his fingers with irritation, chewed at his moustache a
  moment, scowled, swore irresolutely, scowled again, glanced once at Ommony,
  who met his eyes good-humouredly, kicked at a stone, and made his mind
  up.</p>

  <p>"I will try the luck a last time. All or nothing! I will carry on. Ommony,
  old boy, if you've misled me this time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He left the nature of the threat to be imagined, mounted, and rode away,
  glancing back twice swiftly over-shoulder, as if to catch Ommony's expression
  unalert and so divine his secret mood. But he was out of sight before a
  peacock-coloured turban arose slowly from within the well, and a full, fat
  face beneath it surveyed the scene cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, choose new assignation spot! Standing on six-inch ledge, holding
  with fingers of one hand, with drop into watery bowels of underworld the
  penalty for least slip, is Grand Guignol sensation!</p>

  <p>"Why not hold on with both hands?" Ommony asked, without looking
  round.</p>

  <p>"Needed one for pistol, which sahib dumped. Self was dumped. Said very
  valuable weapon fell on this babu. Having caught same, could not move for
  purpose of disposal within clothing. <i>Verb. sap.</i> Am
  emasculated&mdash;very!"</p>

  <p>He climbed out over the rim of the well and stretched himself painfully,
  one section at a time.</p>

  <p>"Am creased like old kerosene can! Yow! I need a hammer to outflatten
  me!"</p>

  <p>"Did you hear what was said?" Ommony asked, lighting his pipe, and not
  even looking at him sideways.</p>

  <p>The babu sat down cross-legged on a broken stone to one side of the well,
  where he was least conspicuous, and proceeded to examine the pistol. He faced
  away from Ommony. Their conversation might have been directed to the empty
  air.</p>

  <p>"Unlike regal artillery, am not gold-plated. Oh, no, very far from it. Am
  impoverished person. Nevertheless, resembling gun in other matters, I go off
  when safety catch is released and trigger pressed&mdash;thus. Yow! I did not
  know it was loaded!"</p>

  <p>"Hurt yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Answer my question then."</p>

  <p>"All things on this plane are relative and governed by desire. How much
  did the sahib wish me to hear?"</p>

  <p>"What <i>did</i> you hear?"</p>

  <p>"Acoustic properties of well are excellent."</p>

  <p>"Can you take a hint?"</p>

  <p>"On paper is easiest, sahib&mdash;with signature of executive of bank of
  issue!"</p>

  <p>"Get your pay from your employer.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, it is difficult for untitled and impecunious babu to obtain permit
  to carry firearms. Now if influential sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Should demand the pistol back," suggested Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Will try again! There are but five shots left in magazine, plus one empty
  cartridge, which might be refilled by expedient person in emergency. Sale of
  ammunition to this babu being <i>ultra vires</i> of inspected commerce, sahib
  in his magnanimity might&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Better take the hint," suggested Ommony. "If I heard too much talk about
  pistols I might begin to look for one."</p>

  <p>"Ah doo me!"</p>

  <p>"Have you made the acquaintance of the priests?"</p>

  <p>"Have accumulated glamour of much sanctity."</p>

  <p>"Well? What are you waiting for?</p>

  <p>"Emolument!"</p>

  <p>"I tell you I'm not your employer."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! You are only person who can send me on red stallion through
  forest full of tigers, a pulled by cannibals*, who drive me before them,
  replacing me on back of said terrifying stallion when I frequently fall off!
  You are unconnected person, who can nevertheless compel me to cling by toe
  and finger-nails to wall of snakesome well. Not my employer! Nevertheless,
  this babu awaits emolument."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* There is a rather widely spread but wholly false
  belief held by town-bred Indians to the effect that the jungle natives are
  cannibals.]</p>

  <p>But Ommony knew better. Fifty rupees from him would have made the babu as
  undependable as a dog that is bribed to obey.</p>

  <p>"Get on or get out!" ordered Ommony. "I can manage well without you."</p>

  <p>"Is gratitude always <i>ex post facto</i>? May not generosity cast its
  shadow in advance?" the babu grumbled.</p>

  <p>"It's getting late," said Ommony. "Suppose you walk to the palace and
  present my compliments to Madame Poulakis. Ask, if her head doesn't ache too
  much if she'd care to meet me in the grounds."</p>

  <p>The babu sighed, salaamed, and waddled off. Ommony gave him ample time to
  get out of sight, then mounted and rode slowly after him for a quarter of a
  mile, in order to make sure he had not doubled back to watch him through the
  trees. However, he saw the broad back continuing in the right direction; and
  a back tells more than some men's faces; the babu's air was business-like,
  and Ommony turned again, contented.</p>

  <p>He rode into the forest by a trail not often used, pulled out his watch,
  whistled, peered about him, cantered for a mile or so along a glade, found
  rising ground, and ascending that, at last saw what he was looking for. A
  thing of many legs, like a prehistoric monster, passed slowly over a rise a
  mile beyond him, moving his way. He sat down then and waited until he heard
  grunts, complaints, and quarreling; but before their source appeared in sight
  he mounted and rode back slowly toward the well.</p>

  <p>He had not dared wait. He had done a miracle. He had persuaded sixteen
  junglis, to whom toil at anything but hunting is a worse contemplation than
  hunger, to carry a load to him across the forest, and they are literal-minded
  folk. They would have dropped the load and run away if they found him
  anywhere before the journey's end. So he sat down by a stone but with an iron
  roof, that he himself had built years ago to hold tools, when planting was in
  progress thereabouts. The hut was almost hidden in the trees and undergrowth,
  and the padlock had rusted into uselessness, but he smashed that and put a
  new one in its place.</p>

  <p>Then the junglis came, weary beyond belief, thin-legged and all new to the
  exercise, carrying shoulder high a big box lashed in the midst of four
  poles.</p>

  <p>He praised them, promising that the devils of the jungle should impose no
  more red-sickness for seven years, and rewarded them fabulously from the
  contents of his saddle-bag. Each bewildered one received, when the box was
  safely in the hut, a brand-new, glittering, imported knife, whose blade would
  actually fold into the handle. Each knife had a ring on it, to hang it to a
  fellow's neck by, and a bright brass chain through the ring. It was
  incredible; but there the knives were, and they ran lest the devils should
  see, and envy them, and make new sorts of trouble.</p>

  <p>No need to warn them not to talk. Only Ommony in all that forest could
  converse with them. They understood not more than ten words in any other
  language than their own decayed Lemurian.</p>

  <p>With the key of the hut in his pocket Ommony rode on to the palace, and
  was admitted this time by a side gate, since there was nothing official about
  his call. Zelmira with Charley in attendance waited for him in an open-sided
  summer-house in the midst of three acres of neglected garden. There was no
  chance of eavesdropping, but they themselves were easily visible from the
  palace windows.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asked Charley.</p>

  <p>"A key to Destiny! Your box is in a hut I'll show you. Have you
  developer?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty."</p>

  <p>"Can you overcome the mechanical difficulties?"</p>

  <p>Ommony spoke calmly, but fear was creeping up his back. Knowing nothing of
  the nature of the difficulties, he had not even imagined any until that
  moment, when it dawned on him like the knell of disaster that a reel of film
  might be unmanageable without extensive apparatus.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Charley. "I've spent part of two years figuring out a
  kit that would serve in emergencies. It's all in that box. The hardest job is
  washing and drying. But I've got a collapsible drum to wind the stuff on, if
  there's scads of decent water, cool enough&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's a perennial spring of cool water within fifty yards of where your
  box is," Ommony assured him. "It flows over clean rock, rather slowly."</p>

  <p>Charley nodded. That was settled. But now another dread took Ommony by the
  throat, so that he coughed.</p>

  <p>"Have you a projector?"</p>

  <p>"Bet your life! No use developing film on the spot unless you can test it
  and see what you're doing."</p>

  <p>Ommony laughed outright.</p>

  <p>"What's the joke?"</p>

  <p>"It's on Strange!"</p>

  <p>"I think it's on me," said Zelmira. "I'm feeling so well I could walk
  twenty miles, and I have to play sick with any head in a shawl! I want to
  ride, and dance, and sing, and be alive, but I have to pretend that even the
  phonograph makes my head ache! The rajah's hints that I've been here long
  enough are getting positively rude."</p>

  <p>"That nabob will have his head punched presently!" said Charley, nodding
  confirmation.</p>

  <p>"Faint heart never won fair plutocrat!" laughed Ommony. "Stick it out,
  madame! The rajah will change his tune from now on. Strange goes to the Panch
  Mahal within a day or two. Then everything depends on you. I'll have a parson
  in attendance."</p>

  <p>"So quick?"</p>

  <p>"Surely. Strange needs distraction, or he'll murder everything on four
  legs and cut down all the trees in the universe! Charley, I want you to look
  over that kit of yours and foresee every possible chance of accident. We
  can't afford one <i>faux pas</i>."</p>

  <p>Charley promised that and they went into session of agenda, ways and
  means, Zelmira bubbling laughter and Charley exploding approval at intervals,
  as Ommony unfolded all his plan.</p>

  <p>"It's a sizzling scheme!" said Charley.</p>

  <p>"And if it goes wrong it's only another scandal in high life!" Zelmira
  added, chuckling mischievously.</p>

  <p>"If it misses one cog, Amen to my career!" said Ommony, not copying the
  fabled ostriches that stick their heads in sand. He likes to face all
  issues.</p>

  <p>"The safe bet is," said Charley, "Strange won't dream anyone would try to
  put that over on him. He's so used to people being scared of him, he'll try
  to bluster, and make it worse."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's hope!" said Ommony; and then, as darkness fell, he went to
  interview the rajah.</p>

  <p>He found him <i>tte--tte</i> with the babu, on a side verandah, facing
  the other way from the summer-house. Chullunder Ghose was squatting on the
  floor near the rajah's foot, catching a purple handkerchief between his toes,
  as he let it fall and pulled it back repeatedly in sign of nervousness. They
  were conversing in English, as a precaution against eavesdropping, and
  because each understood that language better than he did the other's; but all
  Ommony overheard was:</p>

  <p>"They are worse than moneylenders!"</p>

  <p>"True, mighty one, they are priests! They will take no loss."</p>

  <p>"Curse them!"</p>

  <p>"This babu, sympathising with your Highness, curses them devoutly!
  Nevertheless&mdash;shall I not say&mdash;fifty-fifty? Yes?"</p>

  <p>"May gangrene rot them! Yes."</p>

  <p>"And my honorarium?"</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;take this&mdash;there's someone coming&mdash;go
  away'hurry!"</p>

  <p>The babu slunk into the shadows, stowing paper money into some recess
  between his stomach and loin cloth.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hullo, Ommony, old boy, I'm glad to see you," said the rajah. "Are
  you feeling sprightly and full of the old corn and all that kind of thing?
  What do you say to a ride through the jungle tonight to your place? Dinner
  and forty winks, then up like Gay Lochinvar and to hell with caution! I'd
  like to ride with you, and call on Strange at breakfast."</p>

  <p>"Suits me well," said Ommony. "You've done your thinking then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dammit! Those lousy priests want everything! They won't sell their
  claim or release it. They offer to say nothing for the present on a
  fifty-fifty basis."</p>

  <p>"Will they <i>do</i> anything?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"That's just what puzzles me," said the rajah. "They sent that babu to say
  they'd <i>do</i> anything in reason. They don't know what reason is, confound
  them! I don't know what they mean, or what you mean, either! You must be a
  wizard! How have you contrived to make priests offer to do anything?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't been near them," said Ommony truthfully.</p>

  <p>"You've had correspondence then!"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You've threatened them?"</p>

  <p>"No. I don't interfere with priests."</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd let <i>me</i> alone as religiously! Well the priests know
  everything in advance as usual; and as usual I'm the only one in the
  dark&mdash;the reigning rajah! Huh! Why don't you take me into your
  confidence?"</p>

  <p>"I will when my dog recovers."</p>

  <p>That rebuke having reduced the rajah to glowering silence, Ommony pursued
  the advantage. "It's enough for you to know there's nothing legal in the
  priests' claim; but I advise you to mention it to Strange and to tell him it
  isn't legal and can't be enforced in court. If Strange asks me, I'll confirm
  that. Represent to Strange that if he buys the Punch Mahal and pays you cash
  for it, then you'll consider the forest deal, but not otherwise. I'll admit
  to him, if necessary, that as a property-owner he'll have a better leg to
  stand on when it comes to arguing with the Government. Now, are we agreed?
  Then good; we'll start after midnight, in time to reach my place for
  breakfast."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-08"
     id="ch-08"></a>VIII. &mdash; "AND NOW FOR THE REALLY DIFFICULT PART!"</h2>

  <p class="poem"
     style="margin-left:40%">"Apprends-moi z'a parler,<br>
  Apprends-moi la manire<br>
  Comment l'amour se fait!"</p><br>

  <p>Ommony liked himself in the guise of good Dan Cupid, and as he rode
  through the forest beside the rajah the trees and rocks re-echoed to his
  song. All he needed was a stringed instrument of some kind to make him look
  like an old-time wandering troubadour. His voice was ordinary, but his
  instinct for the music true. His short, not too well-ordered beard, and a way
  of throwing back his sturdy shoulders as he sang, with face toward the
  tree-tops, made him seem hardly of this day and generation. Moonlight in the
  clearings, gleaming on bridle, his grey shirt, and the bare skin where the
  shirt lay open at the neck, touched him with romance and annoyed the rajah
  beyond reasonableness.</p>

  <p>"You'll attract wild beasts," he objected.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I seem to do that naturally. You and Strange, for instance! Problem
  is to tame you. Can't be done by cruelty. World's already full of brute
  force. Marry Mars to Venus, and produce what? Trees!"</p>

  <p>"I often think you're crazy," said the rajah.</p>

  <p>"And you're right. We all are. The least crazy of us are the keepers of
  the rest. We're Adams, loose in Eden, and we'll get kicked out unless we
  tend to business."</p>

  <p>That being over the rajah's head (for there is no romance and no true
  vision left in men on the descending arc of the Wheel) he lapsed into moody
  silence, wishing the stars between the tree-tops were the lights of Paris,
  and that Ommony's intermittent singing might be conjured into cabaret
  revelry. He hated the night, and the loneliness. Ommony revelled in
  it&mdash;had not known the feel of loneliness since the early days, when the
  forest swallowed him and where began his education. And a pair of junglis,
  flitting in and out among the shadows, peering this and that way on the
  <i>qui vive</i> for marauding animals, believed that Ommony was some old god
  incarnated&mdash;his song the echo of the splendour of another world. So do
  opinions differ, on all sorts of subjects, with the point of view. By the
  time they reached Ommony's house on the edge of the forest the rajah was
  bordering on homicidal frenzy.</p>

  <p>However, Ommony was feeling at his best, which was the main thing. Adam in
  Eden never managed the assembled creatures better. He put Strange in good
  humour by saying wealth must have been imposed on him for inscrutable reasons
  by Providence.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing inscrutable about it," answered Strange. "We're given
  brains; and if we use them we get wealth. That's all there is to it."</p>

  <p>But Ommony was not disturbing heresies that morning. When they finished
  breakfast he led Strange to the verandah.</p>

  <p>"You'll need your brains," he said, "if you really mean business with that
  rajah. He has been trying to get hints from me as to how to handle you."</p>

  <p>"Bah! All he wants is money," Strange retorted. "Western degenerates are
  exactly like him. First they try to borrow. When that fails they sell out.
  There isn't a creative atom in them."</p>

  <p>He paused, and looked at Ommony with slightly changed perspective. So
  Ommony was coming over, was he? Tipping off the rajah how to make the right
  approach, eh? Hah He had seen that happen scores of times. A government
  official, bound by oath of office to present an impregnable front, knows
  better than anyone where the flank is weakest. Same old game, eh? Show the
  line of least resistance surreptitiously, and trust to be rewarded
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>"I'll remember!" he said, nodding. "Does the rajah want to talk to
  me?"</p>

  <p>So Strange and the rajah walked off together, out of earshot of a world
  that might put false constructions on a simple stroke of business. Jeff, on
  the verandah, smoked in ponderous disgruntlement, admiring nothing not
  above-board and branded with its proper name. Ommony opened his mail, and
  studied it until Strange came to interview him in the office, with an
  unlighted cigar projecting upwards from the left side of his mouth&mdash;a
  symptom Jeff recognized.</p>

  <p>"Is there any doubt about the title to the Panch Mahal?" Strange asked
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"None," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"The rajah says the priests of some temple or other assert a claim to it
  under a verbal deed of gift, said to have been made by one of this man's
  ancestors."</p>

  <p>"It isn't legal. They couldn't establish it in court."</p>

  <p>"If I should buy the place, what <i>could</i> they do?"</p>

  <p>"Depends on your state of mind. If you're nervous or
  superstitious&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No!" Strange snorted. "Is that all? No risk of riots?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no."</p>

  <p>"Any risk of the central government objecting?"</p>

  <p>"Why should they? It's the rajah's private property. If you buy it it's
  yours."</p>

  <p>"Will you witness the cash payment and memorandum of agreement?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mind."</p>

  <p>So Jeff and the rajah were summoned into the little file-decked office,
  and a heap of paper money changed hands that made the rajah's eyes glisten in
  spite of himself, and whetted an amazing appetite for more.</p>

  <p>"Bought sight unseen," said Strange. "Now I'll look the place over. You
  say it's furnished?"</p>

  <p>The rajah nodded.</p>

  <p>"How soon can we go?"</p>

  <p>"I've only one fresh horse," said Ommony. "If the rajah's horse is fit for
  the return journey he might show you the way at once. Jeff and I can bring
  along your bag later, if that suits you."</p>

  <p>The rajah was not given to considering horseflesh. Strange considered
  nothing but his own objective. They two left within the hour, the rajah
  chattering to Strange like a schoolboy trying to entertain the principal on a
  picnic.</p>

  <p>"How shall we follow without horses?" Jeff demanded. "Yours is dog-tired,
  and the sore-backed one in the stable isn't up to my weight."</p>

  <p>But the resources of him who overlords an Indian forest are more ample
  than appears. Ommony gave orders, and a man went like the wind. Within the
  hour there came an elephant that knelt at the foot of the verandah steps, and
  into the howdah went Strange's bag, and Jeff's, and Ommony's, along with food
  enough for several days' emergency. Two servants draped themselves in
  picturesque discomfort on the great brute's rump. Jeff and Ommony piled in
  with rifles and shot-guns, and word began to spread in widening rings that
  the sahibs were off on a hunting trip. The mahout exploded harsh impulse; the
  mountain moved; the howdah swayed; and they were off.</p>

  <p>Men carry their emotions with them, and they are more contagious than
  disease. There is nothing about a ride on the back of an old cow-elephant to
  bring good-humour and amusement to the surface, nor yet to drown them under
  gloom. Ommony's high spirits shone forth and aroused Jeff to a similar frame
  of mind. The trap was sprung at last. The forest-devouring ogre had wallowed
  in. He was jubilant, and in a half-hour Jeff was singing too, trolling out
  deep bass harmonies that made the mahout and the servants, clinging like apes
  on perches, thrill and stir until they nearly fell to earth. All India loves
  a deep voice and a man of muscle.</p>

  <p>And because sleep is less an anodyne than a result of poise and the
  relapse of worry&mdash;midway swing of the pendulum, as it were&mdash;Ommony
  fell asleep after a time, curled up with his legs over the hawdah side,
  dreaming of things a man can't imagine except at sea, or on the heaving top
  of an elephant. Bed is a lair of commonplace. Sleep under moving skies, amid
  experience, and learn! He had a new eye&mdash;new confidence when he awoke,
  having dreamt he saw the wheels and works of Destiny.</p>

  <p>He left the elephant resting in the shade of teak trees near the rajah's
  palace wall, and entered through the side gate into the garden, where he
  found Zelmira in the summer-house.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" he said, laughing. "Nets and cords! Your biggest veil, and best
  foot forward! Tiger's in the trap!"</p>

  <p>She ran to her room and came back with head and shoulders wrapped in an
  enormous motor-veil. You could hardly see her smiles through it, but the
  thrill was obvious.</p>

  <p>"Where's Charley?" Ommony demanded.</p>

  <p>"He's hopeless. Since the box came he is like a dog with a bone. Nothing
  else matters. He's deserted me."</p>

  <p>"Good boy, Charley. We'll pick him up <i>en route</i>."</p>

  <p>They climbed on the protesting elephant, who argued reasonably that forty
  miles and a day's work were the same thing. But the iron ankus overruled
  protest, and by the time they picked up Charley at the tool-hut the elephant
  had decided to swing along and get the journey over with. Conversation became
  next to impossible, as the howdah swung like a small boat in a sea-way and
  the dusty track payed out behind.</p>

  <p>"Is the machine in shape?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"I've fixed her so she&mdash;whoops! Look out!"</p>

  <p>Charley hung overside in the spasms of <i>mal de mer</i>, and there was no
  more conversation to be had from him, except once when he demanded to walk.
  But when they stopped and let him down he had grown so weak that even with a
  rope to hold he could not trot alongside; so they had to pick him up again
  and let him sprawl and suffer.</p>

  <p>"What's your rush?" he demanded through a haze of vertigo. But the
  explanation was wasted on him; he did not even try to listen to it.</p>

  <p>"We've got to keep Strange in. Scare him."</p>

  <p>"He'll pick a quarrel with the rajah when he learns where I'm staying!"
  Zelmira prophesied.</p>

  <p>"So much the better. The rajah's out of it now. Paris and the white lights
  for him until the money's spent!"</p>

  <p>Ommony, not all wise&mdash;only wise enough to know the probability of
  guessing wrong&mdash;spoke with more assurance than he felt. He had noticed
  the glint in the rajah's eye when the money changed hands; he understood the
  lure of that stuff and the risk of treachery. He was silent for the last hour
  while the elephant, complaining of aching feet, deliberately made the howdah
  lurch to inconvenience her living burden. Even the servants were feeling
  seasick when at dusk the walls of the Panch Mahal came in view, with clouds
  of screaming parakeets swooping between them and the setting sun. There, by a
  big tree out of sight of the gate, they all got down except Zelmira, taking
  out all the luggage except Strange's bag.</p>

  <p>"Take it to him as if it were the most natural thing in the world," said
  Ommony; and Zelmira laughed down from the howdah. "If he doesn't ask where
  you're staying, volunteer the information."</p>

  <p>The elephant moved on, seeming to swim in golden dust against the sunset
  glow with walls of opal for a background. Men built a gorgeous cage for their
  beloved in the days when that Panch Mahal first rose among primitive trees.
  At evening it resembles a pearl of prodigious price well set in emerald
  greenery. Its roofs are domes its walls aged colour, stained and softened and
  subdued until the whole is lovelier than oyster shells on wet sea-beaches.
  The screaming of parakeets pierced but failed to break the silence; and in
  that stillness the elephant's tired footfall sounded like the beat of muffled
  drums.</p>

  <p>Dame Destiny was at her task, but Ommony proposed to watch her, she being
  a jade who works her will regardless of laggards. "Here's opportunity," she
  seems to say, and passes on, recalling nothing, changing nothing of her plan,
  ignoring prayer, not even pausing in her path to laugh at those who clutched
  and missed. So he is wise who waits alert.</p>

  <p>Ommony took the wall and followed that, a shadow casting shadow on the
  opal, going softly until he reached the corner of the high, projecting
  gate-arch where the branches of tall trees over-hanging from within combined
  with the gloaming to make impenetrable gloom.</p>

  <p>The elephant was kneeling in the road before the gate. The mahout hammered
  on old wood with his ankus-butt and the blows rang out like pistol-shots,
  disturbing parakeets by thousands, sending them screaming in green clouds.
  But for a long, long time there was no answer. Then, when Ommony, imagining
  miscues, had thought of all the accidents that might have happened, and knew
  for certain Strange had gone elsewhere&mdash;and the forest was
  doomed&mdash;and his own career was ended&mdash;Strange himself came, not to
  the door, but angrily looking down from above it through an opening in the
  arch.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he growled. "What are you breaking down the door for?"</p>

  <p>Then his quarrelling eye observed a lady on an elephant, and there was
  pause. He stood still like a baron up above his own portcullis, with stomach
  thrust out easily over the belt and one hand stroking at his black beard.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he demanded at last, a second time.</p>

  <p>"I've brought your bag. I was asked to," Zelmira called back, grateful for
  the light behind her that made her no more than a silhouette.</p>

  <p>"I can't see your face."</p>

  <p>"You're not intended to. That's why I'm veiled."</p>

  <p>"Your voice sounds familiar."</p>

  <p>"Hadn't you better come down and get your bag?"</p>

  <p>"How does it happen you're bringing it?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ommony asked me to."</p>

  <p>"Where's <i>he</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Down the road. He thought I'd get here sooner. Won't you come down for
  the bag?"</p>

  <p>There were supposed to be servants&mdash;caretakers anyhow&mdash;somewhere
  in the building. But even Strange was hardly crude enough to keep her waiting
  while he should go in search of them, and then find the rajah and get his
  command interpreted. He grumbled something half under his breath, and started
  down. Ommony withdrew deeper into the dark angle of the wall.</p>

  <p>After a minute's fumbling at the gate-bolts Strange emerged, and with his
  chin thrust out and upward&mdash;eyes half-closed because of the last rays of
  sunset&mdash;laid a hand on the howdah.</p>

  <p>"I can't see you through that veil," he said testily.</p>

  <p>"You should know me without that, Meldrum!"</p>

  <p>"Zelmira!"</p>

  <p>"Certainly!"</p>

  <p>She drew back the veil and laughed at him. There was nothing that
  resembled pleading in her method. It was challenge pure and simple, and
  amusement&mdash;even, perhaps, a hint of ridicule.</p>

  <p>"How did <i>you</i> get here?" he demanded. By his tone of voice he might
  have been owner of India from the Hindu Koosh to Comorin.</p>

  <p>"By train from Delhi. I'm visiting the Rajah of Chota Pegu. Any
  objection?"</p>

  <p>"How do you propose to get back there tonight?" he demanded, and she
  laughed outright, for it was the first symptom of his caring even with
  qualification about anybody else than Meldrum Strange.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, I'm sure," she answered. "This elephant is tired to death.
  If the rajah were here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This isn't his place. I've bought it."</p>

  <p>"Oh."</p>

  <p>"That's the situation."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I'll sit here until Mr. Ommony comes."</p>

  <p>"How do you happen to know Ommony?"</p>

  <p>"I know him quite well. Mr. Ommony expects his sister, you know."</p>

  <p>"Let's hope she comes!" said Strange, in a voice of absolute disgust. "You
  need a sensible companion!"</p>

  <p>"She may be there this evening. If so, I expect to visit with them."</p>

  <p>So that refuge was cut off! The only line of retreat left open to Strange
  was away by rail from Chota Pegu station. But in the course of the afternoon
  men had actually come with carts to carry off the furniture. He had to stay
  in the neighbourhood and watch, if he hoped to save the very bricks from
  being stolen. He rubbed his chin, pulled out a cigar, and stuck it between
  his teeth.</p>

  <p>"What's the game, Zelmira?" he demanded. "Listen, girl you only compromise
  yourself by visiting with rajahs and tagging me. It won't get you anywhere.
  I'm here on business. Now&mdash;be sensible, Zelmira. Maybe it's inconvenient
  at the moment&mdash;so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused. He was feeling diffident for nearly the first time in his whole
  career. Suddenly he blurted out the rest of the sentence, in a hurry to get
  it over with.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;let me give you a cheque for expenses, and you go home!"</p>

  <p>Zelmira's eyes were seen to twinkle, even in deepening twilight with her
  back to the sunset afterglow.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that's polite, Meldrum? Are you <i>afraid</i> of me?" she
  asked, as merrily as Titania.</p>

  <p>He snorted indignantly, because he <i>was</i> afraid of her. Presumably
  the strongest of us, like Napoleon, have qualms on the eve of our Waterloo.
  He hesitated, which is always fatal, dallying with brutal ruthlessness in the
  one hand, courtesy in the other.</p>

  <p>Something within him, that he judged was weakness, tipped the scale.</p>

  <p>"Well, come inside and wait for Ommony," he grumbled.</p>

  <p>"I can stay out here," she answered.</p>

  <p>"No, come on in."</p>

  <p>He offered his hand to help her down out of the howdah, and presently
  ushered her in through the ancient gate. The elephant rose and hurried off to
  somewhere where hundredweights of food were to be had, and Ommony turned back
  along the wall to where Charley and Jeff and the servants waited.</p>

  <p>"Has Chullunder Ghose come?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Creaking of wheels in the distance and a string of quaint, complaining
  oaths announced the babu on the way.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you oxen! You are snails reincarnated!" Whack! Whack! "You failed to
  learn. You shall be snails again Pigeons shall eat you!" Whack! Whack! "Oh,
  my Karma! What a villain I was formerly that I must endure these consequences
  now!"</p>

  <p>He drew abreast, and the shadows of the men beneath the tree so startled
  him that he nearly fell from the ox-cart.</p>

  <p>"And <i>she</i> said, <i>at</i> the Panch Mahal, yet here they wait.
  Inaccuracy, O thy name is woman! Orders from a woman are a
  bellyache&mdash;incomprehensible wind and weariness!"</p>

  <p>"Have you brought what she told you to?" Ommony demanded.</p>

  <p>"Everything plus! Whatever Charley sahib placed in boxes in hut is now
  here, plus."</p>

  <p>"Plus what?"</p>

  <p>"Plus instructions from Lord God Almighty priests of Siva! This babu has
  received more orders in space of four-and-twenty hours than agency of deity
  creating universe from protoplasm to humanity, all included. Job not worth
  it, either. No emolument!"</p>

  <p>Ommony and Charley checked over what was in the cart, and Ommony, leaving
  the servants behind, showed the way to what had once been elephant stalls at
  the rear of the Panch Mahal. Five brick arches stood in a row intact, and one
  of them had been boarded up before and behind to make a barn of sorts. There
  Jeff unloaded cases of paraphernalia, setting them down very carefully under
  Charley's supervision. There in the bat-flitting gloom they left Charley
  alone.</p>

  <p>"And now for the really difficult part!" grinned Ommony. "Come on."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-09"
     id="ch-09"></a>IX. &mdash; "TIGER!"</h2>

  <p class="first">There is a kind of glamour about decadence until it dips too
  low. Refraction in the unclear atmosphere of low ideals blurs the outline,
  coaxing imagination to see beauty where none is. Age, toning everything and
  introducing beauty of its own, imposes charm that glorifies even
  battlefields, and dead bones please when they are dead enough. So the Panch
  Mahal was a wonder in its way. They built it for living women two full
  centuries after Shah Jehan conceived the Taj at Agra for a dead one; and it
  resembled the Taj as an oleograph by John Smith is said to be "after
  Rembrandt."</p>

  <p>They improved on the Taj, of course, since civilization and modernity are
  one. They made it practical, affording space for merrymaking and eliminating
  austere waste. The money had been sunk in spaciousness instead of exquisite
  refinement; plaster (peeling now) aped marble walls; and in place of the
  clean sublimity of line and curve, obscene gods grinned. But in the
  flickering lamp-light Strange's new possession seemed passing fair
  enough.</p>

  <p>Strange was sitting in a courtyard, on a stone bench by a dry fountain,
  with Zelmira laughing at him from the lap of an immoral-looking deity, when
  Ommony and Jeff walked in.</p>

  <p>"Here's Jeff and his bag," said Ommony, and raised his hat, nodding to
  Zelmira. She grinned, and lamp-light shone on her white teeth.</p>

  <p>Jeff bade the servants follow him, and wandered off to look for quarters,
  with an old campaigner's eye for comfort, and a great dislike for more
  intrigue than he could anyway avoid.</p>

  <p>"How did you get here?" Strange demanded.</p>

  <p>"I've a bullock-cart. Where's the rajah?"</p>

  <p>"Lord knows. Can't find him or servants."</p>

  <p>"We've brought some food and Jeff's man; he can cook supper."</p>

  <p>"Can you take Madame Poulakis back to the palace?" Strange demanded, in a
  voice of iron. Food was not to be considered in a class with peace.</p>

  <p>"If she don't mind riding in a bullock-cart."</p>

  <p>"That settles it then," said Strange, and Zelmira exploded laughter into
  her handkerchief. The man was frank, whatever else.</p>

  <p>"Won't you show us the place?" Ommony wondered.</p>

  <p>"Some other time. Come to-morrow." Strange did not add the word 'alone',
  but he implied it, and Zelmira could hardly get down from the god's lap for
  smothered laughter. She, if none else, was enjoying the game.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye!" said Strange, and held his hand out, but she curtsied
  mockingly instead of taking it, and he did not even follow to the gate to see
  them away in the bullock-cart. By the way he chewed at a cigar and scratched
  his chin, he was perplexed.</p>

  <p>"<i>Chacun a son gout</i>!" said Ommony, who loves to air bad French.
  "He's yours! But I can't think why you want him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's gold!" Zelmira answered. "Gold when you scratch him!"</p>

  <p>"I know! But his heart's brass, and in his boots this minute!"</p>

  <p>Strange must have guessed already he was cornered. The rajah had even
  taken away both horses, but that fact only transpired when someone stopped
  the squeaking bullock-cart. The oxen shied, as they should not have done, for
  the man was in Hindu costume&mdash;bare legs and a turban, with a white man's
  undershirt, and several yards of cotton cloth around his middle. But his
  first words explained the oxen's instinct, that detects meat-eating races by
  the smell street-widths away.</p>

  <p>"Everything's here and it works!" said Charley's voice.</p>

  <p>"My God!" groaned the babu. "This is nth impersonation of bad business. In
  that get-up Charley sahib will exist five minutes&mdash;if, perhaps! They
  will detect him with shut eyes, and beat him to death with lathies*!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* long sticks]</p>

  <p>"I fooled all of you except the oxen," Charley retorted. "Say: what's the
  rajah doing anyway? There was talking in one of those elephant stalls. The
  rajah rode off less than five minutes ago, leading the horse you lent
  Strange; and he's left a gang of three men sitting like stuffed idols right
  next door to where I've got the stuff cached. Beards&mdash;bald
  heads&mdash;lots of white cotton clothes&mdash;might be Hindu bishops at a
  board-meeting."</p>

  <p>"Gad! That's quick!" said Ommony.</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose rolled off his perch in front of the cart and hurried to
  the rear, where Ommony was sitting on the tail.</p>

  <p>"Sahib! Listen! This babu is Codlin, same being friend, not Short! Short
  is rajah! Atheistic apostate! Too much money is as wine in empty head. This
  babu knows! That rajah demanded from priests' reinstatement in circle of
  sanctified orthodoxy."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"Self was intermediary! Self conveyed to him retort discourteous from
  contemptuous ecclesiastics. Exacerbated rajah now seeks double-cross for all
  concerned, you, me, and priests included! What is betting? I bet rajah now
  sends telegram inviting central government to intervene! All is up now!
  Better leave U.S. plutocrat to stew in juices of annoyed administration! Let
  <i>us</i> establish alibi!"</p>

  <p>The babu's panic spread to Charley and Zelmira, both of whom began to fear
  instantly, if vaguely, on Ommony's account. He had admitted more than once
  that a false step would imply the end of his career.</p>

  <p>"What if he <i>does</i> send a telegram?" Zelmira asked excitedly.</p>

  <p>"It will either confirm mine or contradict it. In either case the
  Government will send Sir William Molyneux, who'll bring a padre with him! You
  drive back with Charley to the palace. Charley, I'll meet you in the tool-hut
  sometime between now and to-morrow morning. Come on, Chullunder Ghose."</p>

  <p>"Oh, all inscrutability, what next?" the babu grumbled. But Charley Wear
  jumped up and took the bullocks' tails. The cart bumped forward, and the babu
  was left standing in the dark with Ommony, who called out a final
  warning:</p>

  <p>"Remember, you're deaf and dumb, Charley! If you speak, you'll give the
  whole game away!"</p>

  <p>Deafness and dumbness had begun. There was no answer. Ommony took the babu
  by the arm and started leading him toward the rear of the building where
  Charley had cached his things.</p>

  <p>"Go in and talk to the priests. I'll go one way; you go the other and make
  lots of noise; give me a chance to get into the next stall without being
  heard. You talk, and I'll listen. Be sure you talk loud enough. When it's
  time to bring me a message from them, come out noisily to cover my retreat,
  and I'll meet you here. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand. But sahib, am impoverished babu without&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Without any hope of being paid by me! You may leave me to manage this
  alone, if you'd rather."</p>

  <p>"Is idealism <i>always</i> eleemosynary?"</p>

  <p>"Always!"</p>

  <p>"Hence materialistic tendency of world, no doubt! An idealist,
  nevertheless. Sahib, my salaams!"</p>

  <p>The babu waddled off, remembering the order to go noisily, kicking at
  stones and unchecked rambling vines, singing a song to himself about the love
  of Krishna, darling of the Gopis, idol of the dreaming maids. In less than
  five minutes Ommony was squatting cross-legged in impenetrable shadow under
  an old brick arch, fearful of scorpions, but absolutely still, and listening
  to secrets in the language of the Gods next door.</p>

  <p>"I ask blessing. I kiss feet. Holiest of fathers, this unworthy babu
  abjectly salaams. Pray pardon intrusion. Only reverence and devoted
  attachment to your honours' interest brings these humble feet to threshold of
  divinity. This miserable babu found the Englishman, whose name is Ommony, and
  having with such skill as he possesses tempted the unclean foreigner into
  conversation, hopes now to render acceptable service with much humility!"</p>

  <p>The answer to that overture was proud and curt.</p>

  <p>"Did you warn the fool to keep his hands off?"</p>

  <p>"No use warning him! Moreover, worshipfuls, the unclean fellow pursues
  same object as your heavenborn selves. Great wrath obsesses him. He is
  indignant that the other unclean rogue should buy this place that has been
  rendered blessed by your honours' claim to it. I think I could persuade him
  to give artful assistance in support of the heavenborns' divinely inspired
  intentions."</p>

  <p>"What would he hope to gain by that?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. He is personally essence of unthriftiness. Idealism, much
  mistaken doubtless since he is alien ignoramus, burns in his unclean bosom.
  And he fears lest the other brute, who has bought the Panch Mahal, may aquire
  the forest too. More-over, he knows the rajah may not be trusted. I think he
  would eagerly subserve your honours' interests rather than be defeated by the
  other two."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"At a little distance, cudgelling his brains."</p>

  <p>"He who allies himself with fools must eat the offal of their folly!"</p>

  <p>"True, most worshipfuls. Yet this babu is not a fool. A humble person,
  totally unworthy to stand in the heavenborn presence, but endowed by the
  Creators with an intellect. In this babu's unworthy hands, that foreign
  ignoramus might be trusted."</p>

  <p>"We make no bargains with such people!"</p>

  <p>"Nay! But with this subservient babu as go-between, much might be
  managed."</p>

  <p>There was whispering, which the babu may have heard, but Ommony did not.
  Then:</p>

  <p>"Let no offer of alliance seem to come from us. There is no
  treaty&mdash;no contract&mdash;no given undertaking. Go to him and find out
  what he wishes. Then report to us again."</p>

  <p>The babu backed away, making such a noisy protest of his reverence and
  full obedience, and stumbling so awkwardly over a heap of fallen bricks, that
  Ommony had no trouble at all to escape unheard. There was no risk of being
  seen. The Indian night had shut down like a black dome pierced with diamonds.
  He and Chullunder Ghose met again in the road where they had parted
  company.</p>

  <p>"Offering advice to sahibs is like touching high-tension wire with
  monkey-wrench," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, your advice is?"</p>

  <p>"Ahsti!* Steady the Buffs, by Krishna! Keep priests waiting! Likewise lord
  of dollars in Panch Mahal, where loneliness roars like lions! Let us sit
  down. Smoke a pipe, sahib!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* go slow]</p>

  <p>So they sat, in mid-road, face to face, each able to watch half of the
  mysterious horizon; and Ommony smoked a whole pipe out before he offered a
  suggestion. Then:</p>

  <p>"Why was the last rajah&mdash;this man's uncle&mdash;allowed by the
  priests to use the Panch Mahal undisturbed?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because he submitted to initiation, thus acknowledging the priests as
  superior to himself, and virtual landlords," said the babu.</p>

  <p>"And this man?"</p>

  <p>"Would like to be initiated; but is such religious apostate and renegade
  that the priests will have nothing to do with him. He has applied, but they
  refuse, suspecting he would only turn tables on them, thereafter setting
  people against them, instead of their making a monkey of him on all public
  occasions, as now happens. Oh, yes, invariably."</p>

  <p>"Is there any other reason why this rajah has had to keep his hands off
  the Panch Mahal?"</p>

  <p>"No other reason, sahib. First he tried to live in it with many women.
  They say that two women went mad, and one killed herself."</p>

  <p>"How was that done?"</p>

  <p>"Apparitions! Thefts! Noises in the night! Flesh creeps to think of same!
  Tunnels! Accomplices can accomplish. Dur&mdash;r&mdash;rrh! Have heard
  tales."</p>

  <p>"They plan, of course, to treat Strange the same way?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Have they started on him?"</p>

  <p>"They are not here for nothing."</p>

  <p>Ommony chuckled, and then thought of Jeff Ramsden, which made him chuckle
  more.</p>

  <p>"There'll be heads broken," he said; and the babu twitched his bare toes
  in the sand, comprehending disadvantages.</p>

  <p>"Not good," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" corrected Ommony. "Strange's nerves will be on end, and the
  priests will reconsider agenda. Both sides will need advice and assistance.
  That's where we some in."</p>

  <p>"Self being sahib's co-conspirator!"</p>

  <p>The babu preened himself. Every atom in his being seemed to tingle with
  pride at the thought. He leaned forward, laying a finger on Ommony's knee by
  way of celebrating partnership. But what he was starting to say died
  stillborn.</p>

  <p>"Get away from here! Go and scheme for the other side," said Ommony,
  seizing the upper hand instantly, at any cost. He knew his babu.</p>

  <p>"Betray me all you want to. I'll manage this alone."</p>

  <p>"This babu is mud beneath sahib's feet! Am co-nothing&mdash;but
  coincidence! Am subventitious aspirant for eleemosynary service! My
  excruciated salaams! Only send me not away!"</p>

  <p>"Keep your proper place, then! Now: go to the priests, and suggest to them
  something like this: They're not really owners of this Panch Mahal, but
  they're as good as owners if they can haze the life-tenant into a proper
  attitude toward them. Isn't that the idea?"</p>

  <p>"Core of the belly of truth, sahib! Most explicit!"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing religious about it&mdash;nothing Brahminical."</p>

  <p>"Rather the contrary. Initiation has always been most scandalous. There
  are tales&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind. Why not initiate Strange? Suggest that to them."</p>

  <p>"Tee-hee!" The babu's fat sides began to shake. "Tee&mdash;hee! Has the
  sahib ever witnessed an&mdash;hee-hee!&mdash;initiation?"</p>

  <p>"I've been told. We might get it modified."</p>

  <p>"Tee-hee-hee! Temple nautch-girls! Mu-mu-moderation! Tee-hee!"</p>

  <p>"Suggest it to the priests. Meet me here later. I'll see Strange."</p>

  <p>"Khee-hee-hee! Salaam, sahib! Oh, my ribs! Dee-licious, very! Genius! My
  God, yes! oh, hah-a-hah! Kuh-scuse it, sahib, please! your humble servant!
  He-hee-hee-hee-hee! I go, I go, I go&mdash;no, no, no&mdash;no kick!
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The babu waddled off, aheave with irrepressible emotion. What Ommony had
  only heard of, he had seen. His great bulk shook as long as he was in sight;
  he almost seemed to be dancing as the darkness swallowed him, and the
  hugeness of his amusement gave Ommony pause. He would hardly be willing, even
  for the forest's sake, to overdo the scandal. He decided to commit the
  priests, and then interview them personally. However, Strange first.</p>

  <p>He went and hammered on the wooden gate until it shook and the arch above
  it echoed; then waited several minutes. No answer, so he beat again. Then he
  heard Jeff's heavy footstep approaching, and gave another knock or two.</p>

  <p>"That's enough!" Jeff roared in Urdu. "If I have to open that gate I'll
  loose off both barrels at you! Go to the devil, and leave that gate
  alone!"</p>

  <p>"This is Ommony."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" The bolts began to rattle. "Sorry, old man. Come in."</p>

  <p>Jeff stood in pyjamas and bare feet, with the shotgun ready cocked.</p>

  <p>"I meant business!" he announced gruffly. "Strange is nearly off his head
  with rage. Did you hear me shoot ten minutes ago?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"This place swallows noise and shoots it out in the way deep mines do,"
  Jeff grumbled. "We thought you'd hear the shot 'way off down the road and
  come back."</p>

  <p>"What did you fire at?"</p>

  <p>"Lord knows! There! Look at that damned thing!"</p>

  <p>They were under the arch, looking inward across the first courtyard, where
  Zelmira had sat in a god's lap. Across the court on the far side was a
  verandah covered by a tiled roof, and above that were rows of shuttered
  windows. Along the tiles there crawled, or seemed to crawl, a thing like a
  snake, thirty or forty feet long, moving itself in corkscrew coils, and
  glowing as if drenched in phosphorus. It had eyes, for they shone and were
  moving; and it was solid, or semi-solid, for the tiles were invisible through
  it. Jeff raised the shotgun and fired twice. The pellets rattled on the roof
  and brought a loose tile away, but nothing else happened. The thing like a
  snake continued on its way, and disappeared&mdash;it seemed into the wall at
  the far end of the roof.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen that before?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"No, that's a new one."</p>

  <p>"What else have you seen?</p>

  <p>"The thing I fired at looked like a naked fakir dancing in a corner of the
  big assembly-room, when Strange and I were trying to get some sleep. The
  crittur had horns and a beard like a goat's."</p>

  <p>"Did you hit him?"</p>

  <p>"You bet I did! But he didn't even trouble to stop dancing till I started
  across the room. Then he disappeared. There isn't a hole in the floor or the
  wall thereabouts."</p>

  <p>"How does your servant like it?"</p>

  <p>"Bolted! Can't find him anywhere."</p>

  <p>Strange, in pyjamas too, came to the wide door of the assembly-room, that
  opened on the courtyard.</p>

  <p>"Have you caught someone?" he shouted.</p>

  <p>"Ommony!"</p>

  <p>"Huh! Are <i>you</i> responsible for this?" He came to meet Ommony
  barefooted, looking more than half-inclined to hit him. "If I catch the
  imbecile who's playing these tricks, I'll jail him or know why!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," Jeff advised quietly. "Let's see if Ommony can explain
  it."</p>

  <p>They entered the assembly-room and sat on Strange's cot. It was a huge
  place, like a modern theatre, without seats or stage, but with rows of
  columns down either side supporting a wide balcony, which was grilled up to
  the ceiling, so that women could watch unseen whatever might transpire below.
  The other furniture consisted of gilded, upholstered divans, and six tall
  mirrors in panels against the wall at the farther end.</p>

  <p>Strange started to speak, but as he opened his mouth foreknowledge of
  something about to happen checked him. It was the sort of silence that
  precedes a bomb explosion, and his mouth stayed open wide.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, three times repeated, a breeze several degrees cooler than the
  surrounding atmosphere struck them in the face. There was a sound like the
  flapping of a punkah&mdash;even the squeak of the cord through a hole in a
  wall that pulled it&mdash;but no punkah visible. The wind was real, for it
  blew the lamp out.</p>

  <p>Then, through the ensuing darkness, came a scream that chilled the marrow
  of the listeners' bones. It increased and waned in spasms. They could almost
  see a rack being tightened in jerks, and a woman stretched between the
  rollers.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to kill someone!" Jeff announced, and struck a match. A breath
  of wind blew instantly. He struck another.</p>

  <p>By its light they saw a headless corpse hung by one leg, apparently from a
  hook between two mirrors on the wall that faced them. And between the next
  two mirrors was the corpseless head, hung by a nail driven into the mouth,
  and seeming to have been pulled off, for there were shreds of flesh and sinew
  hanging down from it. The match burned Jeff's fingers. He swore, dropped it
  and struck another. The corpse and the head were gone. But again came the
  cool wind, and the scream of atrocious agony. There were no Words to it. It
  was pain and fear beyond the power of speech.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" Strange exploded. "What kind of place is this anyhow?"</p>

  <p>Ommony found the lamp, relit it, and sat down. By its light Jeff exchanged
  the shotgun for a rifle. The breeze blew out the lamp, and there was silence,
  broken only by a click as Jeff tested the breech-bolt action in the dark.
  Then new horror, unseen, unheard at first, and indescribable, but there; some
  sort of presence, and a musky smell. Presently footfalls, slow, irregular,
  and almost too secretive for the ear to catch.</p>

  <p>Ommony sniffed twice. "Tiger!" he said curtly. There was no sound from
  Jeff. He was ready.</p>

  <p>"My God! A tiger in here? Strike a match!" said Strange, groping vainly
  for the pockets of his suit on the chair beside him.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" Ommony commanded, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

  <p>"No matches!" Jeff growled. "You'll dazzle me."</p>

  <p>The cot creaked under his weight as he leaned forward, peering along the
  rifle-barrel. The creak was too much for Strange's nerves. He jumped off the
  cot, upsetting Ommony, and seized the chair, the only weapon within reach,
  then stepped back until he felt the wall behind him.</p>

  <p>"Now, by God, I can defend myself!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>Ommony lay still. Jeff never moved, bent forward, peering along the
  rifle-barrel. They could hear the soft footfalls more distinctly, as if a
  beast were exploring the floor in widening arcs.</p>

  <p>Then a tiger coughed. That was unmistakable. Jeff's rifle belched
  light&mdash;twice&mdash;three times, with a din that filled the place and
  drowned the answering snarl.</p>

  <p>"Got him!" he said.</p>

  <p>"You fool, you've&mdash;Jesus! Here he is!"</p>

  <p>A leg cracked off the chair as Strange raised it and struck the wall
  behind. Then he hit something with a thud that shivered the chair to pieces,
  and groped for the cot, backwards. The backs of his knees touched it, and he
  collapsed, lying still, with his knees curled up under his chin. Ommony, down
  on the floor, struck a match at last.</p>

  <p>"I <i>thought</i> I got him," Jeff said pleasantly. "See twice. The first
  one missed, but the flash showed his eyes."</p>

  <p>A big male tiger lay within a yard of where Strange had stood&mdash;shot
  twice through the lungs. Blood flowed from the open mouth. The claws were
  extended in his effort to struggle close and slay before life left him.</p>

  <p>"Stone dead," said Ommony. Then the match went out.</p>

  <p>"Don't light the lamp yet," Jeff whispered.</p>

  <p>There were decencies to be attended to, best managed in the dark. He
  groped for Strange and shook him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Come on," he said, "you're all right."</p>

  <p>Strange sat up, trembling, grateful for Jeff's strong grip on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Just nerves, that's all," Jeff said quietly. "You did well for us. When
  you moved you startled him. He coughed, and that gave me the cue."</p>

  <p>"But I hit him with a chair! I broke a chair on him!" Strange
  stammered.</p>

  <p>"I know you did. Are you all right now? Light the lamp, old man."</p>

  <p>Ommony lit the lamp and held it so that the yellow glow shone full on the
  tiger, and the stripes appeared to move a little as the flame danced in the
  chimney.</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?" Strange demanded. "Better put a bullet in him to make
  sure."</p>

  <p>"Stone dead," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Killed a tiger with a chair! Jee-rusalem!" Strange sat down on the cot
  again. "Can you beat that? Killed a tiger with a chair, you fellows! Can you
  beat it?"</p>

  <p>Ommony, with his back to Strange, stooped down, examining the kill. Jeff
  joined him.</p>

  <p>"Caged for a good many years. Well fed," said Ommony. "Probably half-tame.
  See his pugs? They're soft, and the hair has grown long over the claws. He's
  old, too; look at the length of his eye-teeth. That's a collar-mark on his
  neck, or I'm mistaken. He's been somebody's pet cat."</p>

  <p>"Which explains why he didn't attack directly he winded us," said
  Jeff.</p>

  <p>"But he did attack!" Strange got to his feet again and came and stood
  between them. "I stood there. You see how close he got to me? I wonder if I
  cracked his skull&mdash;must have&mdash;his mouth's full of blood." He
  hesitated. "Say, you men, suppose we keep this among ourselves, eh? I don't
  choose to be known as a liar. If we took oath to it, nobody'd believe a man
  of my age killed that brute with a chair-leg. D' you mind keeping it a secret
  to oblige me?"</p>

  <p>Strange was feeling finely again. Even the memory of goose-flesh raising
  screams had dimmed in the glory of this achievement.</p>

  <p>"With all your strength, bet you never pulled off a stunt like that!" he
  said digging Jeff in the ribs. "It was luck of course, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes you're lucky," Jeff said grinning at him. Then suddenly his face grew
  sober. "Ommony, old boy, we're wasting time. Who screamed just now and why?
  We've of to unearth that. Then there's that corpse&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bunkum! Let's sit here and see what happens next," said Ommony. "I don't
  know how they did it, but it's all a trick. The scheme, of course, is to make
  Strange abandon the place, just as his friend the rajah had to. The priests
  are old hands at this frightening business."</p>

  <p>"Huh! Scheme to scare me off the lot, eh? Dammit, you told me their claim
  won't hold water," Strange objected.</p>

  <p>"It won't. But they've defeated everybody yet who tried conclusions with
  them."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me that before?"</p>

  <p>"I warned you. You snorted."</p>

  <p>"Well. I'll fight 'em." Strange found a cigar, and began chewing it.
  "They've a Tartar on their hands."</p>

  <p>"There's a better way," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"The place is <i>mine</i>."</p>

  <p>"Persuade them to admit that, then. Why run the chance of poison, fire,
  Lord knows what else. They claim the right to approve or disapprove a tenant
  for life, and they stop at nothing to uphold their rights."</p>

  <p>"Neither will I."</p>

  <p>"They've always managed to get rid of anyone who disputed their
  right."</p>

  <p>"Oh! They claim right to dispossess?"</p>

  <p>"Only if the tenant for life, after they've approved him, backs out of his
  promise to let them hold a yearly ceremony here."</p>

  <p>"Would they exclude me from the ceremony?" Strange asked.</p>

  <p>"I think not. You see, they insist on initiating any tenant before they'll
  let him occupy in peace."</p>

  <p>"Initiate him into what? Mysteries?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly. They'd never admit a white man into those."</p>

  <p>"Well then, into what?"</p>

  <p>"I've never seen the ceremony. I might not be allowed to witness it, even
  if they accepted you. But once you're accepted and admitted, as an initiate
  they'd very likely let you see the yearly ceremony. It lasts a week, I'm
  told."</p>

  <p>"That might be fun."</p>

  <p>"They say it's wild. Its origin is so far back in time that nobody knows
  its meaning any more, although it was probably religious, once. They used to
  hold it in the Temple, but it got so scandalous that when this place was
  built they persuaded the rajah of that day to let them hold it here instead.
  He was under their thumbs in some way; and ever since then they've asserted
  an unlegal but prehensile claim to nominal overlordship."</p>

  <p>"Scandalous, eh?"</p>

  <p>"So I'm told."</p>

  <p>"Well. If it's a secret, who's to be any wiser afterwards? It might be
  good fun."</p>

  <p>"You're a damned fool, Strange!" Jeff growled. "Keep out of it!"</p>

  <p>"I'm no milksop," Strange retorted. "I'll keep my head in any situation
  those fossils can invent. If you're afraid, suppose you go home!"</p>

  <p>"I've said my say," Jeff answered. "I'll stand by. But you'll get no
  sympathy from me, whatever happens."</p>

  <p>"Nothing'll happen. Huh! They've come to the end of their resources now.
  We've sat here half an hour and not a sign from them. That tiger was
  the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As he spoke the light went out. The chill blast of air was renewed, only
  tenfold. A man's shout, and a scream like a woman's in grief as well as agony
  froze their blood. Something flapped in the air above them, and there was a
  sudden hurrying noise across the floor that sounded as if ghouls were chasing
  one another. Then the thud of a trapdoor closing, or something resembling
  that; and silence, in which Jeff's steady breathing sounded like the ebb and
  flow of six-hour tides. After two interminable, minutes Ommony struck a
  match.</p>

  <p>The tiger was gone. The only trace of him was blood on the wooden floor
  where his head had lain, and a long smear where he had been dragged across
  the room. A blast of cool air blew the match out. Something sighed. A shape
  like a woman's, faintly phosphorescent, seemed to be wafted on a wind across
  the room about fifteen feet in front of them. Jeff made a jump for it, and
  landed heavily on nothing. The shape vanished.</p>

  <p>Ommony lit the lamp again, and the three explored the whole room. There
  were two doors, one they had entered by, and another in the far corner,
  opposite, but no discoverable trapdoor or sliding panel, although the walls
  sounded hollow, and in places the floor seemed to hint at booming caverns
  under it when they jumped.</p>

  <p>They opened the door in the corner with difficulty, for although it was
  not locked something seemed to hold it; but when Jeff exerted his strength
  and it flew wide, there was nothing there&mdash;nobody&mdash;no sign of
  anybody having been there.</p>

  <p>So they took two rifles and a shotgun and explored long passages and rooms
  absurdly furnished with imported export stuff, of the sort that generation
  after generation of rajahs had believed was "quite the thing." There was
  almost nothing antique or genuine in the place, although there was plenty of
  evidence of reckless spending. Not a sign of a human being; only rats that
  had nested in the stuffing of arm-chairs and ran as they entered the echoing
  rooms, striking match after match.</p>

  <p>Jeff was for exploring the cellars, too, but Ommony demurred. "Snakes," he
  suggested. "Ambush. Anything might happen and be explained away as
  accident."</p>

  <p>"Upstairs then," Jeff proposed; but that seemed almost equally risky,
  especially as they had left shotgun in the assembly-room along with their few
  other belongings. So they turned back, expecting to find their way easily by
  the light of the lamp they had left burning.</p>

  <p>But the light was out again. Jeff groped his way in the lead and struck
  out with his fist at something that he felt rather than saw in the passage
  just before he reached the assembly-room; but whatever it might have been, he
  missed it.</p>

  <p>He struck a match and held it high, to get wide a circle of light as
  possible, stepped forward, tripped over something, swore; and the match went
  out. Ommony struck another close behind him. Jeff kicked at what had tripped
  him, and the pieces of a broken shot gun scattered across the floor.</p>

  <p>Ommony looked for the lamp, but it was broke too&mdash;smashed into
  smithereens. His feet crunched broken glass, and his shins struck the legs of
  the overturned cot. Jeff struck his last match, and by the swiftly waning
  light of that they could see the furniture overturned and their torn clothes
  scattered at random about the floor. There was not a seam apparently
  unripped, and the bags were torn to pieces in the bargain. Then darkness, and
  no matches.</p>

  <p>Nothing for it but the courtyard, where the rising moon was just beginning
  to pour amber light over the roof and change a quarter of the paving into a
  floor of pale gold. There Jeff took position in the god's lap that had nursed
  Zelmira recently, and, looking like a herculean god himself in loose pyjamas,
  kept a <i>qui vive</i> with the rifle pointing every way, as one sound or
  another drew attention.</p>

  <p>But the only noises now were owls' hoots. The only movement was the
  swooping of the big bats, looking like spectres as they swerved across
  moonlight and plunged into shadow again. A jackal's yelp broke silence at
  intervals from over the wall, and once in the distance an elephant trumpeted
  disgust at something.</p>

  <p>"Strange," Jeff said, at the end of an hour's vigil, "I advise you to pull
  out of here first thing in the morning."</p>

  <p>"Yes. In pyjamas! I see myself!" Strange answered. "Mr. Ommony, I'll have
  to have my trunk sent over from your place. Can you manage it?"</p>

  <p>Ommony supposed he could. There were more impossible things.</p>

  <p>"It'll take time, though," he warned him. "Meanwhile there's no knowing
  what these priests will do."</p>

  <p>"I'll stay on and stick it out!"</p>

  <p>"How would it be for me to suggest to the priests that you'll stand
  initiation? That might end this foolishness."</p>

  <p>"What does initiation amount to? Don't know, eh? Well, dammit, I'm
  interested&mdash;yes try anything once. Yes, get word to 'em!"</p>

  <p>"Strange," growled Jeff Ramsden, "You're a fool for all your money. You're
  a gilt-edged rube&mdash;no better!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-10"
     id="ch-10"></a>X. &mdash; "UP TO YOU, SIR!"</h2>

  <p class="first">Long before dawn they let Ommony out to interview the
  priests and send for clothes, provisions, servants, and what not else.
  Strange's cigars had all been ruined; the tobacco in Jeff's tin can was
  scattered on a dusty floor; they were a desperate garrison in danger of
  ill-temper.</p>

  <p>"Tobacco first!" said Jeff. "Send stacks of it.</p>

  <p>"And tell those priests I'll fight 'em to the last ditch unless they're
  reasonable," was Strange's final word.</p>

  <p>So Ommony took the dusty road along to where an idol sat in moonlight on a
  pile of masonry that might have been a wayside altar once on a time. The idol
  came suddenly to life as he drew within ten feet of it, rolling off-centre
  and lurching into the road before him.</p>

  <p>"Have seat, sahib. Meditation-place of fakirs&mdash;most gregarious for
  wisdom&mdash;just like sitting under shower-bath of ideas! Thoughts being
  habituated like trained animals to come to holy man in certain place, whoever
  sits there&mdash;take a seat and try, sahib!"</p>

  <p>Ommony preferred to take it standing up, and declined the invitation. Too
  obviously Chullunder Ghose was seeking to soften the impact of bad news.</p>

  <p>"What did the priests say?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"They are worse than Christian Devil, which is saying much!"</p>

  <p>"What did <i>they</i> say?"</p>

  <p>"Very little, yet ultimatively! Proud fools! Unwilling to concede your
  honour's right to dictate outcome of events! This babu, using seven keys of
  argument to unlock hierophantic minds, failed nevertheless. Said locked minds
  are rusty. Nobody home, and nothing doing, same as Charley sahib says! The
  best they will concede is that Panch Mahal must become theirs absolutely. On
  such terms they will play into sahib's hands in matter of initiation. They
  demand explicit promise."</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, how much more of this horseplay have they in mind?"</p>

  <p>"Hee-hee! In mind, much. <i>In posse</i>, very much. <i>In esse</i>, at
  moment, no more. There is armistice. Temporary respite for accumulation of
  resources. Hee-hee! Sahib, they have congeries of living animals, reptiles,
  and insects, that would make Zoological Society of London gnash teeth in
  envy! Noah should be relegated now to second place! Hee! They have gas
  composed of petrifying corpses, mixed with dust of red pepper and sal
  volatile! They have a corpse so realistic that there is serious anxiety lest
  the God of the Dead should demand its immediate decomposition! There is a
  tube concealed in the walls that will magnify a scream; and there are two
  tunnels, through which they have access to the interior of the building by
  secret doors."</p>

  <p>"If they're not careful Strange will discover those tunnels&mdash;or
  Ramsden will. Then the game will be up."</p>

  <p>"They will be <i>very</i> careful, sahib. They are <i>most</i>
  resourceful. Trust them."</p>

  <p>"I don't, and I won't. But will they trust me If I tell them they may have
  the Panch Mahal, will they believe it?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? A promise made to the priests and broken subsequently
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I get you."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, there was a High Commissioner once who broke a promise to the
  priests, and took long leave, and went to London. He had a servant to taste
  his food, but neglected to consider the gum on the flaps of envelopes he
  licked. It is possible to oppose the priests, and even to defeat them without
  unpremeditated consequences. But to break a promise made to them is suicide.
  Speaking of which, I see Charley sahib riding this way on native
  pony!"</p>

  <p>Ommony, who had turned his back to the moonlight in order to see the
  babu's face, did not look round.</p>

  <p>"How d'you know it's Charley?"</p>

  <p>"Blind idiot with head in hag could recognize in darkness U.S. effort to
  ride bareback in fashion of Chota Pegu. Backbone of lean old pony proves
  uncomfortable&mdash;very!"</p>

  <p>The pony's hoofs drummed nearer, and Ommony expecting new awkward
  developments, turned slowly to watch the herald of disposing gods. It was not
  such a bad attempt, after all, that Charley made to ride in Chota Pegu style;
  he looked like a native of the country mimicking a white man, with turban end
  a-stream behind him and his right arm working like a flail to keep his
  balance. The pony 'planted' twenty yards from Ommony, and Charley saved
  himself from a header by vaulting.</p>

  <p>"Glad I've found you," he said. "Your sister has come, along with Sir
  William Molyneux!"</p>

  <p>"Angel of light and devil of darkness in same train, eh!" said the
  babu.</p>

  <p>"Came at midnight in a special locomotive, one car, and caboose. She's
  A-1. Nice old lady. Don't know what to make of him. His voice is like a
  kerosene can falling downhill. He looks like a cross between a prize-fighter
  and an Anglican bishop."</p>

  <p>"He is," said Ommony..</p>

  <p>"I'd nothing to do&mdash;couldn't sleep&mdash;so I went to the station to
  get pointers on how a deaf and dumb Hindu should behave himself. Usual ten or
  a dozen people there, sleeping on the platform, ready for to-morrow's
  train, so I sat around and watched 'em, having fun with the station babu who
  asked to see my ticket. He told me at last to beat it, but I got wise a train
  was coming, so I shook my head and stayed on squatting in the lamp-light like
  a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait!" said Ommony. "How did you cover twenty miles to the palace in an
  ox-cart before midnight?"</p>

  <p>"Hell! That was easy. I ditched the cart and turned the oxen loose.
  Zelmira and I both figured we'd sooner walk. I guess we walked a mile, till
  we came to a thing they call a house in these parts. There were two ponies in
  a thorn corral; this beast's one of 'em. We waked the owner and Zelmira
  bought the critturs; she had cash with her, but it took us half an hour to
  make the guy see reason. Then we rode, and gee! she looked funny. But she
  beat me to the palace gate. I couldn't go in, of course, in this disguise, so
  I went to the station after a while, as I told you; and along come Molyneux
  and your sister, he helping her down out of the car as if she were the
  queen.</p>

  <p>"How's she looking?" Ommony interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Fine. The people on the platform all did poojah and the babu fussed like
  a wet hen. Nobody'd expected 'em, and there weren't any orders, so nobody
  knew what to do about it, and they all did nothing at the limit of their
  lungs. I sat there looking deaf and dumb. I guess I was the only one on the
  platform not yelling&mdash;except maybe your sister; she was coaxing Molyneux
  to keep his temper. Seems a telegram had mined fire. Nowhere to
  go&mdash;nobody to meet 'em&mdash;nothing. Your name bursting on the scene
  like hand-grenades at intervals. Me sitting still.</p>

  <p>"Pretty soon Molyneux gets your sister back in the car, and demands a
  messenger to go and find you. No messenger. Nobody knows where you are.
  Nobody cares a damn, either. The babu tells Molyneux in English that the
  train's got to move of the way, or go back to Sissoo Junction or something,
  and Molyneux swears it shall stay right where it is for a week unless he gets
  a messenger to go on horseback and find Ommony sahib.</p>

  <p>"Well, the babu points to me and says I'm a deaf and dumb lunatic who won't
  go away. He adds I've a pony hitched to the station railings. Molyneux
  strides up to me, takes me by the ear, and yanks me upstanding.</p>

  <p>"'Let's see whether I can make him understand', he said, scowling with his
  forehead all over his eyes&mdash;just like a pug.</p>

  <p>"I didn't take to that any too cordially. So he says: 'Hello! A Hindu who
  can use his fists? What does this mean?' And he pulled my turban off. 'Short
  hair, eh?' I said: 'Shut up, you fool!' and he looked kind of hard at me in
  the lamp-light. I was getting ready to run, for he could have whipped me with
  one hand tied. However, he says: 'We must look into this. Come with me.' So I
  went with him into the car, where I told Miss Ommony howdy and said how glad
  I was to meet a sister of her brother.</p>

  <p>"Well: Molyneux thinks at once I'm in the secret service, and I had a
  dickens of a time to unconvince him. Then he starts to shoot questions at me
  like an old stork picking a dead dog to pieces, and I was plumb scared. I
  didn't know how much it was safe to tell him. At last I doped it out that as
  your sister was there, and he was talking right out in front of her, he was
  prob'ly o.k. with you. I took a chance on that and told him all of it.</p>

  <p>"He laughed for about seven minutes straight on end. His laugh's worse
  than his talking voice. When I'd done counting all the fillings in his teeth
  he asked me to go on the pony and find you. I guessed I'd better. 'Tell him',
  he said, that Brass-face says he is anxious Ommony should watch his step.
  Say, the Rajah of Chota Pegu has wired to the central government that Ommony
  is accepting bribes in league with some priests to give a millionaire named
  Strange a half-nelson on the forest. Tell him we've got to straighten this
  out without pulling feathers within the week or there'll be trouble.' That's
  the message."</p>

  <p>"Brass-face is a brick!" said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"That brick struck this babu once. Not again!" said Chullunder Ghose, and
  he was on his way instantly&mdash;anywhither except in the direction of the
  station.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" commanded Ommony.</p>

  <p>"But that Brass-face sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shan't hurt you this time."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, he hurts all and sundry. His bowels are merciless! He is
  chucker-out-bouncer for Government when illegality shall be done under mask
  of high-handed individual mistake. He thrashed a Maharajah! He will enter
  temples and desecrate holiness at moment's notice on any whim of caprice. He
  deprived me of government office, leaving self, family, and numerous
  dependents at mercy of chance emolument. He kicked me twice in same place,
  which is manifestly unfair. He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I tell you, I'll protect you."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, he will get you next! He is Administration whips and scorpions,
  laying on hard! Not known as Brass-face because he is gentle. By no means.
  Believe me."</p>

  <p>"Brass-face is my friend," said Ommony quietly.</p>

  <p>"Krishna! You and he will then run universe. But if he kicks me, I will
  poison him."</p>

  <p>"My kingdom for a horse!" laughed Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Wireless! Telephone's best. I must talk with my sister or Molyneux. I
  don't care which. Both for choice."</p>

  <p>"This brute's about finished," said Charley.</p>

  <p>"You're too heavy for him anyway."</p>

  <p>"He'll have to serve. Chullunder Ghose! Feed Charley sahib and find him a
  place to sleep."</p>

  <p>"Am I God of Hebrews, producing manna in wilderness?" the babu answered
  impudently.</p>

  <p>"You heard what I said. Work a miracle, confound you! He eats before dawn,
  or you catch it! See you later," he called back to Charley, driving his heels
  into the flanks of the miserable plug.</p>

  <p>Say what you like about oats (and they're needful), but it is the will of
  riders that makes horses gallop when reason declares they can't do it. Ommony
  rode, not using stick or heels too much, those being inefficient substitutes
  for horsemanship. The lean beast scattered three good leagues behind him, and
  most of the dust that covered those, until in the glimmer of a false dawn he
  fetched up foundered near the house of an old-time friend of Ommony's.</p>

  <p>The friend came forth with half a dish-rag on his loins and a turban big
  enough for two men, grinning, and as pleased to be of use as a dog to see his
  master.</p>

  <p>"Aye, sahib, verily; and in haste! The fleetest animal in Hind! A mare I
  bought from the army, cast for vice because the fat soldiery were afraid of
  her. A beast with a heart, and legs. Behold her eye! She has but the one, and
  lo, the white of it! Deal not gently with her, sahib. Best to let her feel a
  strong hand on the rein; and beat her thrice over the buttock as she rears.
  See&mdash;I will stand here, thus, and strike her with a lathi. Aye, sahib, I
  will feed the other carrion, though he isn't worth the meal. Come again,
  sahib! Come soon! Nay, no payment! Nay, the mare is thine!"</p>

  <p>So Ommony came to the station on a squealing bay of nearly seventeen
  hands, who took three fathoms at a spring, and tried to savage him as he
  dismounted. And as he might have guessed if he had stopped to think of it, he
  found Sir William Molyneux asleep and snoring serenades to Miss Ommony, who
  leaned rather bored from the window of the front compartment.</p>

  <p>She refused to kiss Ommony, objecting to his whiskers; but she was a nice
  little middle-aged spinster, with a twinkle in her grey eyes and the same way
  of carrying her chin half-tilted toward the tree-tops that Ommony, and some
  sea-captains, have.</p>

  <p>"He's really ramping," she said calmly, glancing at the open car-window
  whence the snores came.</p>

  <p>"I think it's a good thing he found me waiting at Sisso Junction and
  brought me along in his train. He says you play too much politics and he'll
  break you for it if you don't reform, even if he is your friend. You'd better
  humour him. I know there's no hope of reforming you, but you needn't
  emphasize that."</p>

  <p>So Ommony entered the other compartment and awoke Molyneux, who was
  sleeping fully clothed in deference to mid-Victorian proprieties. (His father
  <i>was</i> a bishop.)</p>

  <p>"Hah Uh-huh-hurrum!" said Molyneux, sitting up, wide awake instantly and
  searching through vest pockets for his monocle.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know all about that, sir," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Point is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The point is, what the devil do you mean by the presumption! Why in
  blazes didn't you refer Strange to the central government, and leave them to
  tell him to go to hell?"</p>

  <p>"Because they wouldn't have told him to," Ommony answered. "They'd have
  referred it home, and Whitehall would have asked the Treasury; the Treasury
  would have called bankers into consultation; and the bankers would have
  backed up Strange on the scratch me and I'll scratch you principle. Farewell,
  forest!"</p>

  <p>"What's this about the priests?</p>

  <p>"They're offering Strange the Third Degree.</p>

  <p>"What for, by Halleluiah?"</p>

  <p>"Same old game. If he recognizes their authority by submitting to that
  they'll let him occupy the Panch Mahal in peace. If not, no."</p>

  <p>"And the idiot consents? By Gad, he must mean business! He realizes if the
  priests once recognize him as lawful life-tenant he'll have a status here no
  government could upset. The priests 'ud construe eviction of him into insult
  to them. 'Twon't do. Got to stop it. You've made a balls of this!"</p>

  <p>"Hear both sides first," said Ommony. "The priests are willing to take our
  side, on condition they get title to the Panch Mahal."</p>

  <p>"We can't do that. It belongs to the rajah."</p>

  <p>"No, he's sold it to Strange."</p>

  <p>"Worse and worse! If we refuse to register the transfer that means a fight
  through three courts against Strange and his millions. Complications, Ommony!
  It won't do."</p>

  <p>"You haven't heard all yet. Did you bring the padre? There's a lady in
  this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not your sister? For Heaven's sake! Yes, the padre's coming. Couldn't
  imagine why you wanted him."</p>

  <p>"A Madame Zelmira Poulakis&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What? Zelmira Poulakis! I met her in Delhi. She's charming."</p>

  <p>Molyneux found his monocle at last, screwed it in, and stared at Ommony,
  frowning over it as if the weight of brow were necessary to keep it in
  place.</p>

  <p>"You'll meet her again then. She's here."</p>

  <p>"The hell you say!"</p>

  <p>"She's crazy enough to want to marry Strange."</p>

  <p>"Crazy my eye! The man's richer than Croesus."</p>

  <p>"And as pleasant as physic! However, she wants him. If she gets him,
  she'll call him off from interfering with the forest. I don't doubt she'll do
  anything we ask about the Panch Mahal."</p>

  <p>"But could she call him off?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. He's run away from her. She's the real reason why he's hiding in
  the Panch Mahal this minute."</p>

  <p>"Hates her, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"'Fraid of her?"</p>

  <p>"No. Afraid of himself. He's got bachelor's bile. He's afraid if he sees
  too much of her he'll discover his heart somewhere, and ask her to marry him,
  and be a bachelor no more, amen."</p>

  <p>"How sure are you of this?"</p>

  <p>"As that I sit here. It all depends on you, sir."</p>

  <p>"Dammy, what have <i>I</i> done?"</p>

  <p>Molyneux sat silent for as long as it took Ommony to charge his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Dammy! Eh? A woman in it!" he said at last. "She's a charming woman,
  Ommony. I'd say she's brains."</p>

  <p>"She's all right."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so. The whole of Delhi was after her, self included. She
  turned us down one after the other. Knows her p's and q's. Can she be
  trusted?</p>

  <p>"I understand she has <i>been</i> trusted by some of the most suspicious
  crooks in the world," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"By Gad, sir, so have you!" said Molyneux. "That's a recommendation.
  Umti-tiddle-i-um-tum-tum. But suppose Strange bolts for it and lays his case
  before the central government?"</p>

  <p>"He can't, sir. He's in pyjamas in the Panch Mahal. No clothes, no horses,
  no servants, no possible messenger except Jeff Ramsden, who's in pyjamas too;
  no telegraph&mdash;telephone&mdash;nothing."</p>

  <p>"Got his cheque-book with him, I suppose! He can buy what he needs.
  There's always someone after money."</p>

  <p>"No, the place is watched."</p>

  <p>"By whom, for instance?</p>

  <p>"Babu Chullunder Ghose for one."</p>

  <p>"That rascal? That settles it! Strange can give us all the slip the moment
  he's inclined."</p>

  <p>"No, sir. Chullunder Chose is in Zelmira Poulakis' pay and in the secret,
  expecting what he calls a 'competency' if she pulls this off."</p>

  <p>"By dammy, the thing looks water-tight!" said Molyneux.</p>

  <p>"Depends on you, sir."</p>

  <p>"Confound it, no! It's you. If you've misjudged the situation&mdash;hell!
  we'll all be in the soup! I admit I've never had cause to regret trusting
  you. But that's the way it goes; you trust a man, and trust him, until he
  lets you down finally; it's human nature."</p>

  <p>"Up to you, sir."</p>

  <p>"What do you want of me?" demanded Molyneux.</p>

  <p>"Tobacco and cigars. The more the merrier. I'll take them to the Panch
  Mahal to keep Strange and Ramsden from going mad, while I get some
  sleep."</p>

  <p>"They're in that handbag. What next?"</p>

  <p>"Take my sister to the palace and introduce her to Madame Poulakis. Talk
  it over with her."</p>

  <p>"Dammy! First thing you know, the rajah will blow the gaff. He's a cheap
  reptile."</p>

  <p>"Promise him a trip to Paris, sir. He's got Strange's money. The shell of
  him that returns in a year's time won't hurt anybody!</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's reasonable. The first demi-mondaine he hooks up with'll put
  the hat on him for ever. All right, what else?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing more now, sir. I'll be off," said Ommony. "Look after my sister.
  Good morning." And Ommony mounted the vicious bay after a five-minute fight
  for mastery, and vanished in clouds of sunlit dust.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-11"
     id="ch-11"></a>XI. &mdash; "WHO EATS CROW, EH? WAIT AND SEE!"</h2>

  <p class="first">Chullunder Ghose meanwhile solved a problem with Alexandrian
  simplicity.</p>

  <p>"He said I must feed you or catch it, sahib. How much can you eat?" he
  asked Charley.</p>

  <p>"A horse. I'm hungry."</p>

  <p>"Carnivorous western blood-hunger! No remedy but this way, then?"</p>

  <p>He led Charley to the front door of the Panch Mahal, gave Charley a rock,
  and bade him hammer on the wood with it.</p>

  <p>"But remember: deaf and dumb!" he cautioned. Then he stepped aside, and
  hid behind the projecting masonry.</p>

  <p>So it was Charley who received on head and shoulders the bucket of water
  that Jeff poured down from above the arch; and Jeff who received the rock,
  plunk in the chest, hurled by a pretty fair to middling bush-league pitcher's
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Try another exchange!" He suggested, and Jeff recognized the voice.</p>

  <p>"You durned young hoodlum! You can't come in here," Jeff laughed. "Strange
  'ud&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sahib! Oh, yes!" Chullunder Ghose came under the arch and made
  violent gestures implying
  intrigue&mdash;conspiracy&mdash;secrecy&mdash;urgency&mdash;silence. "Open
  and let us in!"</p>

  <p>Jeff hesitated. His regard for Charley Wear was nearly as high as his
  opinion of the babu was low.</p>

  <p>"He has promised me breakfast," said Charley.</p>

  <p>"Am magician!" said the babu, gesturing again.</p>

  <p>"Can cook coffee&mdash;fried eggs&mdash;bacon&mdash;toast&mdash;Just think
  of it!"</p>

  <p>Jeff glanced behind him to make sure Strange was out of earshot.</p>

  <p>"We <i>had</i> some food, but it's gone," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Thieves got away with it in the night."</p>

  <p>"Am thief-catcher! Will bring all back. Come, Charley sahib."</p>

  <p>He started off at a fast run round the corner, beckoning to Charley to
  follow.</p>

  <p>"I'll let Charley in," said Jeff.</p>

  <p>"No, no! Charley sahib is deaf and dumb cook's assistant."</p>

  <p>Charley followed the babu. On foot, in the enormous turban, he looked
  exactly like one of those low-caste Hindu youths who do the chores around
  sahibs' kitchens. Jeff shrugged his shoulders and returned to the courtyard,
  less in love than ever with intrigue of any kind.</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose led the way at a surprisingly fast waddle around the
  building to the elephant stalls in the rear, and thence to what had evidently
  been the servants' quarters in the place's palmy days. There was a hut
  divided into cubicles for twenty or thirty men, but nothing in it at the
  first glance except rats and beetles. However, the babu seemed well
  acquainted. Without hesitation he jerked open a cupboard door, disclosing a
  man fast asleep on a long shelf. Bad language ensued in Tamil&mdash;lots of
  it. The fellow was as much annoyed by the incoming light and air as at being
  wakened; he was even angrier when the babu started cuffing him and dragged
  him out on to the floor. Observing then that Charley was the smaller man, and
  of lower caste, he flew at him, and was sent sprawling for his pains.
  Thereafter he decided to be reasonable, and, opening another cupboard with a
  key he kept hidden in his loin-cloth, disclosed the provisions that Ommony
  had brought on the elephant. Nothing had been harmed. No packages were
  broken. There were kettles&mdash;matches&mdash;rather stale
  bread&mdash;everything.</p>

  <p>Chullunder Chose heaped the lot into an empty box and hove it on to
  Charley's head.</p>

  <p>"Act part, sahib! Act part complacently!" he whispered. Then, with a
  parting kick directed at the key's custodian he led the way back to the front
  gate, through which Jeff presently admitted both of them. Strange, naked to
  the waist, was washing himself in the fountain, and as it never entered his
  head that Charley might be Charley, and as the box on top of the turban kept
  the face underneath in shadow, Charley got by undetected. The babu led
  straight to the kitchen, and half an hour later there was nothing lacking but
  cigars to make Strange almost pleasant company. Although he had missed his
  sleep, he was beginning to find the adventure amusing. It rather intrigued
  him to think that a middle-aged rich man like himself should be enjoying poor
  man's fun.</p>

  <p>He unbent toward Chullunder Ghose, and, while Charley made away with
  victuals in the kitchen, using appetite to offset dumbness, asked the babu
  question after question, seeking to throw light on the night's events.
  Nothing suited the babu better than exercise of imagination, so Strange heard
  tales about the priests that, even though he mocked them with explosive
  snorts and hah-hahs, had some effect. His inborn incredulity (the rich man's
  <i>vade-mecum</i>) had been undermined in the night. There had to be some
  explanation, and there might, after all, be something in the babu's.</p>

  <p>"They are great magicians, sahib! They can do things done of old in
  regular course of day's work by wizards only mentioned now in
  fairy-tales."</p>

  <p>Strange encouraged him to talk on, since there was nothing else to do, and
  no tobacco. Jeff, disgusted, went to the kitchen to interview Charley, and
  together they made the round of the upper storey, Jeff looking for something
  to explain the disappearing snake of the night before, and Charley scouting
  on his own account. They both found what they wanted.</p>

  <p>There was a room whose one window provided a full view of every inch of
  the courtyard. It faced a blank white wall on the far side; and the wall was
  overshadowed by a cornice. Charley considered that with an appraising eye.
  Beside the window, just above the floor and on a level with the tiles of the
  verandah roof that ran along the whole of one side of the courtyard on their
  left as they looked out, was a large round hole, closed easily by a lid that
  swung on hinges. The floor-dust was considerably marked with the impress of
  naked feet; there were spots where two men might have knelt beside the hole;
  and there was a long smear where something had obviously been dragged across
  the floor.</p>

  <p>"That settles that!" said Jeff, thinking less than ever of intrigue and
  priestly magic.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that settles that," said Charley. "Problem now is how to get the
  stuff in here unobserved."</p>

  <p>"That ought to be easy enough," Jeff mused; then turned and stared at
  Charley suddenly. "What do you know about it? You weren't here last night!
  You didn't see that snake they pulled along the roof."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of something else," said Charley. "Let's go, Jeff. I don't
  want Strange to catch me up here. We can talk outside."</p>

  <p>They found a stair within a turret that let them reach the courtyard
  without having to pass Strange, and, closing the outer gate behind them, went
  and sat with their backs against a wall in a recess between two buttresses,
  where Jeff's pyjamas were not so likely to attract attention. There they
  talked until it was after nine o'clock, Jeff grumbling away steadily and
  Charley just as steadily insisting that Strange "had it coming to him."</p>

  <p>"Anyone who plans to rough-house him has me to fight first," Jeff said
  definitely, more than once.</p>

  <p>"Aw, shucks! They'll only make a fool of him," Charley argued. "They'll
  fix it so he marries a nautch-girl. I'll have a picture of the ceremony, and
  we'll rub that in. He'll be told afterwards it's regular, and the only way
  out is by public divorce, which'll get in all the papers, naturally. See him
  wince? That's where Zelmira comes to the rescue. She's fake with the priests
  and calls the whole thing off&mdash;on terms."</p>

  <p>"I never heard such rot!" Jeff exploded, beginning to laugh. "Strange
  isn't an idiot. He'll turn the tables on the lot of you, or my name's
  Johnson. Zelmira will lose out, and serve her right!"</p>

  <p>Charley was about to offer further explanation, but they were interrupted.
  Sitting in a recess between two buttresses of the outer wall, they had
  neither seen nor heard three horses cantering steadily toward them in the
  soft dust. Zelmira Poulakis, Miss Ommony, and Sir William Molyneux, all
  mounted on the rajah's Arabs, drew rein in front of them, and Jeff got to his
  feet, buttoning his pyjama jacket nervously. Zelmira laughed. Miss Ommony
  looked sympathetic.</p>

  <p>"Seen anything of Ommony?" demanded Molyneux.</p>

  <p>To Jeff's disgust Zelmira introduced him. To his chagrin Miss Ommony held
  him in conversation. To his utter discomfiture Zelmira and Molyneux rode off
  in search of Ommony, leaving Ommony's sister still conversing with him and
  exhibiting no inclination to leave off. He couldn't be abrupt and walk away.
  He couldn't command her to follow the others. She dismounted, springing down
  from the saddle as easily as a twenty-year-old, and stood in the dust before
  him. He had to hold her horse for her.</p>

  <p>"Jeff Ramsden, I've heard of you. I think you've heard of me. Tell me all
  about this!" she demanded suddenly. "Is my brother Cottswold mad?"</p>

  <p>She had Ommony's face, with the firmness but not the
  pugnacity&mdash;sweetness in the place of subtlety&mdash;and all her
  brother's honesty of purpose shining out of young grey eyes that made the
  silver in her hair look almost comical by contrast. Jeff almost forgot his
  unseemly apparel and bare feet, in admiration of her.</p>

  <p>"My difficulty is," he said, "I seem to be in everybody's confidence. The
  less I say the better."</p>

  <p>"Except to me. I'm trusted with secrets of State," she answered; and Jeff
  believed her. She was that kind. However, he hesitated. Deep answers deep by
  doing as deep does, observing confidences. She respected that, and
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Let me see Meldrum Strange."</p>

  <p>"He's in pyjamas too."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind."</p>

  <p>"He will!"</p>

  <p>"Does that matter?"</p>

  <p>"The gate's not locked," Jeff answered. "I'll hold the horse."</p>

  <p>She smiled and walked in through the gate, closing it behind her. Jeff led
  the horse away to where some trees provided shade, for he had no helmet; and
  thither Charley followed, to sit in the dust with him again, and yawn, and
  swear at flies, and wish there were tobacco, and behave in general as two men
  do who like each other well enough, but disapprove each other's attitude.</p>

  <p>Not even Chullunder Ghose knew what transpired on that occasion inside the
  Panch Mahal. He came out looking like a man rebuked, and in answer to Jeff's
  questions said that Ommony was bad enough, but his sister was the devil.</p>

  <p>"Did she know you?" Jeff asked him.</p>

  <p>"She knows too much!" he answered.</p>

  <p>"How did Strange like her appearance on the scene?"</p>

  <p>"He ran upstairs and shouted at her from upper window. She sat on side of
  fountain, saying she has seen many people in pyjamas, Viceroys included; will
  therefore wait until he shall feel brave enough to interview her in
  riding-suit. He came down, and they talked, this babu listening
  unsuccessfully. Drew closer without ostentation, and received
  rebuke&mdash;extremely acrid&mdash;very! Two minds with but a single thought,
  same being that babu is dirty person devoid of self-respect. Came forth
  accordingly."</p>

  <p>There was no sign of Ommony. It seemed that Zelmira and Molyneux had found
  him, for they did not come back. Jeff, Charley, and the babu sat there
  flapping flies until the shadow shortened to announce approaching noon, and
  still no sign of anyone. Charley fell asleep. The babu dozed at
  intervals.</p>

  <p>At high noon Jeff got up and strolled toward the gate, wondering whether
  he ought not to investigate. Those priests might be up to more deuce. There
  might have been an accident. He should at least peer in through the gate and
  ascertain that all was well. However, the gate was locked, which rather
  scared him. He beat on it, imagining a thousand things.</p>

  <p>To his astonishment, not Strange but Miss Ommony opened it at last, and
  she was laughing. There was more unmixed amusement in her eyes than he
  remembered to have seen in anyone's. Nor did she apologize for having kept
  him so long waiting. But that was deep to deep again. Her air, he thought,
  was rather of camaraderie&mdash;a sort of 'you'll know soon enough'
  attitude&mdash;as if she understood his position fully, and would explain her
  own at the proper time.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind sending the babu here?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>So he walked back, wondering, knowing he liked her amazing well, and
  feeling confident she would not do anything to make the situation worse,
  whatever happened. He was sore with Strange, as who would not be? But loyalty
  to an employer or a partner (Strange was actually both) was almost the breath
  Jeff breathed. He felt comfortable now Miss Ommony had come, yet wondered
  why.</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't go against her brother," he reflected. "She's notoriously
  hand-and-glove with him."</p>

  <p>Puzzled, yet not so irritated as he had been, he sent the babu hurrying,
  and sat down for another hour, sleeping at last beside Charley. It was the
  babu who wakened them both at two o'clock. The horse was gone. There was
  still no sign of Ommony, or Molyneux, or Zelmira. The babu sat in the dust in
  front of them, all his dissatisfaction evaporated and a look of sanctified
  immodesty projecting almost a halo into the air around him. Sunlight
  heightened the effect.</p>

  <p>"Well? What?" Jeff asked him.</p>

  <p>"Tobacco. Cigars likewise!"</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose set them down in the dust&mdash;produced
  matches&mdash;struck one&mdash;passed it.</p>

  <p>"How did you come by these?" Jeff demanded, exhaling imported smoke.</p>

  <p>"This babu, beholding state of mind of sahibs, contemplating same, prayed
  to diverse gods for tobacco, lest ill-temper of deprivees later on make Job
  unendurable. Gods were very generous&mdash;<i>I</i> think."</p>

  <p>"Where did you find 'em?" asked Jeff.</p>

  <p>"Outside gate of Panch Mahal&mdash;in dust. All but trod on same,
  emerging."</p>

  <p>"What went on in there?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Ommony sahib went off&mdash;on horseback, this babu inducing horse
  to walk from here to gate. Very gentle creature&mdash;fortunately!"</p>

  <p>"What happened inside?"</p>

  <p>"Inside horse? He ate nothing. She rode outside, this babu assisting her
  to mount."</p>

  <p>"Inside the Panch Mahal, you ass!"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" The babu tried to look as if he had not understood the first time.
  "Nothing," he answered, more blandly innocent than ever.</p>

  <p>"Then why did they send for you?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps to prove that nothing happened, sahib. Am exquisitely discreet
  witness."</p>

  <p>"Strange has bought you, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Am poor babu, but unpurchasable."</p>

  <p>"Where's Mr. Ommony?"</p>

  <p>"Not knowing, can't say."</p>

  <p>Jeff hove himself erect, left Charley smoking, and walked back to the
  Panch Mahal, where Strange admitted him. Strange grabbed a cigar.</p>

  <p>"Seen Ommony?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Where did you find tobacco?"</p>

  <p>"Ommony seems to have left it outside the gate."</p>

  <p>"Huh! His sister was here."</p>

  <p>"I admitted her."</p>

  <p>"The devil you did! She didn't say that. Have any talk with her?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing to mention."</p>

  <p>"See her ride off?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Talk with the babu?"</p>

  <p>"Questioned him. He told me nothing."</p>

  <p>Strange seemed satisfied to know that. There was a new atmosphere about
  him, hardly less assertive, but more pleasant. He was plainly well pleased
  with something.</p>

  <p>"What's eating you?" Jeff demanded.</p>

  <p>Strange smiled aggravatingly, eyed Jeff as one appraises, say, a horse,
  and kept his own counsel.</p>

  <p>"I like to put one over on Johnny Bull," he answered cryptically.</p>

  <p>"You're the goat all right, this trip," Jeff answered. "Don't be a fool,
  Strange! Pull out of this before they make you look ridiculous. I won't tell
  what I know, but I warn you. Pull out!"</p>

  <p>"I'd stay and watch, if I were you."</p>

  <p>"It won't amuse me to see a man of your age and dignity made the goat by a
  lot of Hindu priests," Jeff retorted.</p>

  <p>"Take my tip and watch!"</p>

  <p>Strange, even in pyjamas, looked almost as he used to in New York when he
  paced the office floor tossing triumphant orders to a corps of clerks. He
  threw a chest. He clasped both hands behind him, and even kicked the fountain
  at the end of a to-and-fro patrol just as he used to kick the office
  wainscot, sitting down at once to curse and fondle his bare toe&mdash;but
  even so, not rabid in his rage as formerly. The pain brought water to his
  eyes, but he found grace to laugh at himself.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you marry Zelmira?" Jeff asked him suddenly, judging that a
  favourable moment to surprise the underlying truth.</p>

  <p>Strange set his toe down and stopped swaying. He glanced up, seeming to
  think deeply for a minute. He looked half-astonished, as if the notion were a
  new one.</p>

  <p>"You think she would?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Jeff laughed. "Save lots of trouble," he said.</p>

  <p>"She's a nice girl."</p>

  <p>"Yes, she's nice&mdash;confounded nice! But d'you think she could endure a
  crabbed old fossil like me?"</p>

  <p>"I suspect she's game to have a crack at it."</p>

  <p>Jeff folded herculean arms across his chest and laughed aloud. If he had
  had clothes and shoes&mdash;or even a horse, without those&mdash;he would
  have started off that minute to find Zelmira and bring her there and offer
  the two his blessing.</p>

  <p>"How long before Ommony sends our trunks?" he wondered. "An elephant might
  make the journey and return in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind," Strange answered. "I've had a long talk
  with&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Ommony. Don't care whether we get the clothes or
  not. They'll up with doodads for the ceremony; you'll look fine in silk and
  ostrich feathers!"</p>

  <p>"I'll kill the man who tries to haze <i>me</i>!" Jeff retorted. "So Miss
  Ommony has been encouraging you, has she?"</p>

  <p>"I found her quite encouraging."</p>

  <p>Strange smiled exasperatingly.</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised at her," Jeff growled back. "It's natural, I suppose, that
  she should take her brother's part, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm surprised at her too."</p>

  <p>"I liked her. I thought she was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I like her, too, first rate."</p>

  <p>"You'll not like anyone&mdash;yourself least&mdash;before long!" Jeff
  assured him. "Strange, you're off your head!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe, maybe. We've all a right to go mad if we want to."</p>

  <p>"Yes!" exploded Jeff, "and take the consequences!"</p>

  <p>"Um-huh! Consequences. Take 'em. That's not half-bad. Who eats crow, eh?
  Wait and see."</p>

  <p>Jeff could get no more out of him. Strange avoided further talk by
  rearranging the overturned cot in the assembly hall and settling down to make
  up for lost sleep. In fifteen minutes he was snoring, seemingly without a
  worry on his mind. Jeff explored the building for a while, then wearied of
  that; cleaned the shotgun and rifles with a fragment of Strange's shirt;
  wished there were something to read, and, wish producing nothing, rearranged
  the other cot and presently slept too. Their snores rose and fell like the
  chorus of a busy lumber-mill.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-12"
     id="ch-12"></a>XII. &mdash; "IS EVERYTHING READY?"</h2>

  <p class="first">The next few days were in some respects the most remarkable
  in Ommony's adventurous career, although at the time he was too occupied to
  realize it. He fretted for the future of his forest like a woman with one
  child, and, being a man of action, it occurred to him that the only way to
  prevent one of those unforeseen slips that send men's plans agley was to keep
  everyone else busy.</p>

  <p>He had to keep good-tempered and apparently serene, which in itself was
  difficult enough; to think in two languages, which was easy; to divine the
  thought of Hindu priests and a Bengali babu, in which practice had made him
  proficient; to foresee chance, which is impossible; and to be everywhere at
  once, which is mainly metaphysics. And he accomplished marvels; but all men
  have their limitations.</p>

  <p>His opinion of Strange by that time was much lower than any man may safely
  entertain about any other man. The trunk arrived by elephant, and he sent it
  to the Panch Mahal. Then, fearing that Strange might walk abroad and stumble
  over facts too plain to be misinterpreted, he begged his sister to see as
  much of the millionaire as possible and use her tact to the utmost to
  persuade him to stay indoors. She consented. She had always been sisterly and
  loyal; many a difficult negotiation Ommony had pulled off with her devoted
  aid. But she disgusted Jeff Ramsden by so obviously aiding in a plot that he
  thought outrageous.</p>

  <p>"Women are all cut from the same piece!" Jeff grumbled to himself, and
  left them as much as possible alone, strolling off for exercise whenever she
  put in an appearance.</p>

  <p>The rajah was another difficulty. Ommony managed him by harping on the
  Ville Lumiere string. He persuaded the rajah to get busy packing, not,
  however, encouraging him to leave Chota Pegu yet, for fear he might meet some
  high official in Bombay or elsewhere and let the cat out of the bag&mdash;a
  thing he would delight in doing.</p>

  <p>Then Zelmira Poulakis needed wisely counselling. He insisted to her that
  the danger was Molyneux, who might at any moment fly of the peg and stop the
  whole proceedings with a high hand.</p>

  <p>"Brass-face is a hard nut for his own sex; but he's putty in a woman's
  hands," he told her. "He's another of these convinced bachelors who'd rather
  flirt than feather a nest. Go riding with him. Use the rajah's horses. Keep
  Brass-face off the lot as much as possible."</p>

  <p>She was nothing if not a good sport; and a good sport, of either sex, was
  the one thing under heaven Molyneux admired. So Molyneux attached himself to
  her court as mounted baronet in&mdash;waiting, and the two rode all about the
  countryside with a Hindu <i>sais</i> behind them, who entertained the other
  <i>saises</i> in the stables afterwards with imitations of the Brass-face
  sahib's Hah-hah-hah. But he could not describe Zelmira's answering music; she
  laughs like Titania, which is over the head of an Indian groom's
  histrionics.</p>

  <p>Then there was the babu. Something had bitten him. He was getting uppish.
  He had altogether too much to say&mdash;too many notions&mdash;too much
  independence altogether. He did not even clamour for emolument. The wine of
  the conspiracy had gone into his head. He talked of "we, ourselves, and us,"
  as if Ommony and he were partners, and he senior. When ordered to do one
  thing he frequently did another; ordered to say one thing, he sometimes said
  the opposite. Abused and threatened for it, he tried to look chastened, but
  failed, and could be heard chuckling the instant Ommony's back was turned.
  Yet Ommony dared not get rid of him at that stage of proceedings. The babu
  knew too much.</p>

  <p>Besides, Chullunder Ghose would have to serve as go-between; almost as
  master of ceremonies. Someone who knew English and could interpret the
  priests' requirements would have to be in attendance, and none except the
  babu was available. Ommony himself could hardly but in an appearance. He
  intended to witness the initiation, but from hiding, along with Charley Wear;
  and it was likely anyhow that Strange would object to having any white man,
  except his own friend Jeff, to witness rites that he felt sure Strange hoped
  would be outrageous.</p>

  <p>And that thought brought another in its wake. He knew Molyneux. He dared
  bet on what Molyneux would do in any given set of circumstances. Nothing less
  than fatal injury would restrain Molyneux from witnessing the
  ceremony&mdash;a certainty that presented advantages, but an obstacle as
  well. Objections raised by the priests themselves would weigh nothing in
  Molyneux's estimate, who would present himself at the front gate, demand
  admittance, and obtain it. That might stop the whole proceedings.</p>

  <p>"Tell you what," he said to Molyneux. "You don't want to appear in this
  officially, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Dammy, sir, by Gad, no!"</p>

  <p>"Strange might jib at that too. He'd hate to be made a fool of in front of
  a uniformed British official."</p>

  <p>"I don't blame him."</p>

  <p>"The rajah won't be there, of course. The priests and he don't hit it off.
  Why don't you borrow an outfit from the rajah? You'll look splendid in it,
  and Strange won't know you're not an Indian prince. He doesn't care in the
  least what Indians think of him."</p>

  <p>"Hah-hah-hah!" The monocle went into place. "Gad, Ommony By dammy, that'ud
  be a good joke, wouldn't it? Think the rajah's finery would fit me? Eh?"</p>

  <p>Ommony took heart of grace. As a machinegun man will test the mechanism
  that he knows is perfect on the eve of action; as a hunter tests a trap-fall;
  as a doctor feels a convalescing patient's pulse, he could not keep himself
  from testing what seemed to him the one uncertain link.</p>

  <p>"You've no objection then to going through with it?"</p>

  <p>"By Gad, no!"</p>

  <p>"No fear of your calling it off at the last minute?"</p>

  <p>"None in the world."</p>

  <p>Ommony sighed silently, relieved beyond expression, and went off for
  another interview with the priests, who he knew might not be trusted, but
  whom he felt he could manage nevertheless. Molyneux was dynamite. If he
  exploded, nothing invented could contain or hold him. The priests were
  mercury, elusive and dangerous, but liable to flow downhill along the lines
  of least resistance.</p>

  <p>On the way he met Charley Wear, and stepped aside behind a garden wall to
  talk with him.</p>

  <p>"Is everything ready?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Sure bet. I got the camera in place while Strange was showing your sister
  the inner courtyard. But it's my belief Strange don't care a hoot. He saw me
  once, and I think he recognized me. He avoids that room upstairs as if he
  knows my things are in there and don't want to seem to know. The doors
  locked, but he's never once tried to open it."</p>

  <p>"That's just fortunate coincidence."</p>

  <p>"Well: he's looked everywhere else. I asked Jeff what he 'thought about
  it, and Jeff just snorted. He's not fit to speak to&mdash;wanders off on his
  own like a bear with a sore head."</p>

  <p>"Last minute nerves, that's all," said Ommony. "Over the top to-morrow,
  and all's well."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I guess it's nerves all right. I've a hunch a peg loose. However,
  you're running it."</p>

  <p>"Everything's in first-class shape," said Ommony, and laughed and left
  him.</p>

  <p>Then the priests: another matter altogether. They were aloof and alone in
  a quiet temple that had seen its better days, perhaps, but still exuded an
  atmosphere of changelessness and influence. Its outer court was hidden among
  sar trees and surrounded by a wall on which the legends of the gods were
  carved with no mean skill. The centuries had smoothed and subdued all
  harshness, and a bell that tolled frequently suggested in mellow overtones
  that there was comfort in austerity&mdash;a thought improved on by the doves,
  that cooed all day long in an endless hymn of mother-magic.</p>

  <p>There was no space in the courtyard where an unclean heretic from oversea
  might stand; but there was an outer court&mdash;a sort of jail-yard, cut off
  by high, squared masonry, where those untouchables who sweep the streets and
  make themselves generally useful may squat and listen to beatitude afar off.
  Ommony was in their class for the time being. He entered the enclosure with
  suitable reverence, and stood still until a twice-born venerable with shaven
  head and straggling beard hailed him reasonably insolently from a platform
  set above the wall. With becoming diffidence Ommony drew nearer.</p>

  <p>The platform was designed, with a round hole on the side toward the
  unclean department, so that from the dregs of the less-than-Brahmin world
  might stand underneath and be blessed by curt phrases, as it were spat down
  at them. They might even make their wishes known by standing beneath with
  faces upturned, that being a properly respectful attitude, calculated to
  enhance the priestly dignity. But it was excruciatingly uncomfortable; and
  the view to be had of the under-side of a priest&mdash;a sort of worm's-eye
  view of heaven&mdash;added nothing to the charm.</p>

  <p>There was silence for quite a long time, while the priest waited for
  Ommony to speak first, and he waited for the priest, neither man choosing to
  overestimate the other's pride. The devil of it was, that if you looked up
  you looked suppliant; and if you looked down you naturally presented a
  hangdog aspect to the haughty ecclesiastic. However, those were the two
  alternatives; if you stepped back you were beyond the pale, not speechless
  necessarily, but according to the rules inaudible.</p>

  <p>The temple bell boomed three times, its golden mote shimmering away into
  infinity, before Ommony could master his exasperation to the point of
  speaking first.</p>

  <p>"Are all things ready?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"All what things?"</p>

  <p>Ommony laid hit head right back to see better through the hole, but had to
  squint because the sun was in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You listen to me!" he retorted angrily. "This affair has gone too far for
  any high-horse business. It you don't talk frankly you can call the whole
  thing off and we'll let the Government interfere."</p>

  <p>That is roughly what he said. The Urdu of it, literally set down, would
  not appeal to a Western sense of proprieties. The words he actually used were
  penetrating&mdash;pierced even priestly armour&mdash;brought response.</p>

  <p>"There is no need for the sahib to feel indignant."</p>

  <p>"No, no need! Permit <i>me</i>, sahib."</p>

  <p>He turned and found Chullunder Ghose behind him, looking meek and amiable,
  which surely implied he was full to the cranium of mischief. What was worse,
  it implied the babu had been spying. Why had he followed Ommony in there
  uninvited? Why should he approach the priests at all by that humiliating
  route, when there was another, fairer court reserved for persons of his
  indeterminate state of unrighteousness?</p>

  <p>However, the babu had seized the upper hand by storm before there was time
  to prevent him. Standing well back, so that he could see the priest over the
  edge of the platform, he began to hurl abuse at him, insulting him with every
  epithet Bengali imagination could invent, ending breathless on the
  point&mdash;his real argument:</p>

  <p>"Moreover, you are a fool. This sahib has brains. You should treat him
  with deference."</p>

  <p>Whereat the incredible occurred. The priest called to someone beneath him
  in the inner courtyard. There was a pause, after which keys were heard to
  jangle on a ring. Then a small door set deeply in a corner of the wall was
  opened cautiously; and through the opening, but touching neither door nor
  wall, an arm emerged and beckoned Ommony and the babu.</p>

  <p>"Quick, sahib! This is a high honour!"</p>

  <p>The babu, almost pushing Ommony in his excitement, hurried through after
  him, and a lean priest locked the door at their backs. Even so, they were not
  in the inner courtyard, but in a sort of cell without a roof, with another
  small door at the far side, through which the man with the keys disappeared.
  It was like a pen for sorting animals, where they might perhaps be
  disinfected before admission to the main corral; only there was a stone bench
  along one side, and Ommony sat down on it.</p>

  <p>"High, very great honour!" said the babu, squatting at his feet.</p>

  <p>Before they had time to exchange a dozen words the inner door opened and
  two priests entered, neither of whom were the same who had spoken from the
  platform. By their air these were "men higher up," although they wore no
  insignia to prove it. They had no need to swagger. Their assurance was too
  absolute to call for self-expression. Self-conscious sanctity had no more use
  for sanctimoniousness. They had come to study an insect, and proceeded:</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked one of them, as if that might be
  interesting.</p>

  <p>Ommony took his time about answering. He was seated, and it did not run
  counter to his humour to keep them standing. What little wind he could feel
  in his sails, so to speak, that minute was so light that he pondered before
  deciding on which way to lay his helm. And before he made decision the babu
  robbed him of what little wind there was.</p>

  <p>"The sahib comes to ask your honour's excellency whether all is in order
  for the initiation. Are there hitches?"</p>

  <p>"No, no hitches." Just three words, spoken without apparent movement of
  the lips, in a voice devoid of emotion. Then: "But delay," said the other
  priest; and if he noticed the look of exasperation that swept over Ommony's
  face he gave no sign of it.</p>

  <p>"The sahib is in haste," said the babu, glancing from Ommony to them and
  back again. No statement ever was more true, but it had no effect on the
  priests. They were as interested as anglers might be in the protests of a
  dying fish. Ommony could not afford to let proceedings hang fire. Strange
  might cut loose any minute. Molyneux might change his mind and decide the
  central government should interfere. Zelmira&mdash;even his own
  sister&mdash;might make some mistake. He himself was nearly worn out with
  sleeplessness and worry; and there was no certainty that the rajah might not
  betray the whole plan any minute. If the rajah should see Strange&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is time," he said simply, mastering the impulse to stand and storm at
  them.</p>

  <p>"Then why does he wait?"</p>

  <p>That was the ultimate of insolence, expressed superbly. No frown&mdash;no
  curling lip&mdash;no hauteur: merely interest, addressed to the babu, not to
  Ommony. Ommony decided it was time to lose his temper.</p>

  <p>"I'm here to tell you I propose to wait no longer!" he answered
  indignantly. "It's time for you to carry out your promises."</p>

  <p>"To what does he refer? We made no promises." To the babu again, not to
  Ommony as if the babu were his keeper. The babu began to speak, but checked
  himself. The other priest had a word to say:</p>

  <p>"It is for suppliants to promise. We have ears, and we remember."</p>

  <p>"What does he mean?" demanded Ommony, trying to turn the tables by
  directing his question at the babu instead of at them. But he gained nothing
  by it the priests' indifference was that of graven marble.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, it is as this babu said. They make no promises to anyone. They
  make stipulation, and await sahib's promise, same not having yet been
  made."</p>

  <p>"What do they want?"</p>

  <p>"Promise of Panch Mahal."</p>

  <p>"It isn't mine," said Ommony. "How can I promise them what doesn't belong
  to me?"</p>

  <p>The babu made no pretence to knowing that. He turned to the priests. The
  exchange between him and Ommony having been in English, he interpreted.</p>

  <p>"Neither does his necessity belong to us," one of the priests
  answered.</p>

  <p>Ommony swore fervently under his breath, not caring whether the priests
  saw his discomfiture or not. They obviously understood the situation. They
  had let him lay his plans to the point where success depended solely on
  themselves, and now took advantage of that to spring impossible demands. How
  could he promise them Strange's property?</p>

  <p>"Tell them I'll do my best," he said angrily.</p>

  <p>One of the priests permitted himself the luxury of a thin, hard smile.</p>

  <p>"They want definite promise," said the babu, without waiting for the
  priests to say the obvious.</p>

  <p>Ommony got to his feet disgusted, feeling for his pipe.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "Let 'em call the whole thing off."</p>

  <p>He did not know what he was going to do, except to turn his back on the
  priests and have no more dealings with them. He supposed he must go first to
  Molyneux and confess failure; then, presumably, to Strange and plead with
  him. He liked that thought about as much as a condemned man enjoys the
  prospect of the gallows. However, what was the use of arguing? He laid his
  hand on the door leading to the outer court. But it was locked.</p>

  <p>"Let me out," he said angrily.</p>

  <p>But while his back was turned he had given the enemy time for conference.
  It does not take long for priests of that religion to exchange glances and a
  nod. They made no move to let him out, and he turned on them again. One of
  the priests said something in a low voice to Chullunder Ghose.</p>

  <p>"Their excellencies say," said the babu, "that the Panch Mahal is theirs
  by right. No white man will be allowed to occupy it."</p>

  <p>The priest spoke again. The babu interpreted.</p>

  <p>"They need it for their purposes. They would be careful for the
  forest:"</p>

  <p>The other priest said something in an undertone. The babu's quick ear
  caught the words, and he turned them promptly into English:</p>

  <p>"Moreover, in the matter of the forest, it is not wise to offend the
  servants of the gods."</p>

  <p>The implied threat was obvious enough, but Ommony's spirit surged in him
  instantly. They were temporizing! They did not wish to close the discussion!
  Then there was a weak joint in their armour somewhere. He prayed to whatever
  gods there might be to point it out to him, but the gods seem always
  humorously dumb in an emergency.</p>

  <p>He looked at the priests. They were emotionless. His eye fell on the babu
  squatting before them in a pose of reverent humility. Reason, intuition,
  instinct, all three warned him that the babu was playing for no hand but his
  own. <i>Ergo</i>, if the babu had a private understanding with the priests
  then <i>he</i> might be the weak joint. But how to prove it? And what
  then?</p>

  <p>Possibly they thought he, Ommony, was somebody whose yea or nay amounted
  to more than it Really did. Priests think in terms of autocracy, and most of
  India deludes itself as to the real power, or lack of it, that legally
  belongs to an official.</p>

  <p>"Ask them what they think of me? he demanded suddenly.</p>

  <p>The question took the priests entirely by surprise. They smirked at each
  other, confessing they did not know how to answer it. Their true thoughts
  would have been so insolent as to make further approach impossible. They had
  a thousand thoughts about him in the relative, where temporary delusions are
  acceptable for the sake of convenience. Which thought did he mean?</p>

  <p>"None!" was the answer they would have liked to give; but one does not
  give that kind of answer to a government official at whose hands advantage is
  sought. One of the priests said something very quickly. The babu caught it
  and interpreted.</p>

  <p>"They say, they know the sahib's influence can prevent a transfer to
  themselves of legal title to the Panch Mahal."</p>

  <p>To tell the truth and deny that would have been mere stupidity.</p>

  <p>"I promise not to try to prevent it," he said simply.</p>

  <p>"If a transfer is arranged, will the sahib permit it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>That was all. The priests nodded, saying something as they turned to
  go.</p>

  <p>"The ceremony may take place to-morrow," said the babu, as the man came
  with the keys to turn them out through the other door. So Ommony went,
  feeling mystified. What had they up their sleeves? How were they going to
  compel Strange? What, he wondered, did the babu know about it?</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-13"
     id="ch-13"></a>XIII- &mdash;"AH-H-H!"</h2>

  <p class="first">All Chota Pegu turned out in gala attire for a holiday. Lord
  knew there were few enough occasions, and few, too, who could afford much
  finery; but such as they had, and such as this was, they made the best of it.
  The huts yclept houses disgorged their living streams at dawn, and those in
  turn were swallowed in a denser stream of country-folk from surrounding
  villages, a trifle shy and rather sniffed at (since even Chota Pegu draws a
  line between the towny and the hick).</p>

  <p>Someone had blundered, or had let the news get out, which amounted to the
  same thing. Ommony suspected the rajah; the rajah blamed it on the priests;
  they dropped dark hints about Chullunder Ghose; and he said nothing. But it
  transpired later that the man who opened up a lemonade stand near the Panch
  Mahal front gate, and did a roaring trade, had to turn over the lion's share
  of the profit to the babu, who financed him.</p>

  <p>Even jugglers came, and snake-charmers from only they knew where, and
  performed for copper coins before the crowd, that waited patiently as Indian
  crowds can be depended on to do when there is entertainment.</p>

  <p>There were even wrestlers&mdash;such artists in their craft that they
  would struggle for twenty minutes and tie themselves into inextricable knots
  of which none could guess the outcome; and they would hold that insoluble
  conundrum, contrary to all Nature's laws, while a small boy took up a
  collection; after which they would calmly unravel themselves and begin all
  over, working up new enthusiasm for a second offertory. And nobody ever did
  learn which would have won if the match had gone on to a finish.</p>

  <p>Then there were acrobats, who could stand on one foot on top of a thin
  pole whose other end rested on bare earth, distorting themselves on that
  giddy perch into likenesses of nothing anyone had ever seen. And there were
  beggars, of course; and a man who said he was a leper, and looked it. And
  they all gave to the leper, although everybody knew that if he really were
  one the Government would have taken him away long ago; they being charitable
  folk, more anxious to acquire merit than to impose it on others.</p>

  <p>Then, about eight in the morning, everyone said "Ah&mdash;h&mdash;h!"
  because the elephants began to come from the direction of the temple. Lots of
  people got in the way and were all but trampled on which was exciting; and
  they naturally laughed because they had escaped, and the rest laughed at
  them, so there was a great time. They had all seen elephants every day of
  their lives; but it is the mood you are in, not what you are looking at, that
  counts.</p>

  <p>Besides: the elephants had curtained howdahs, and everybody knows what
  thrilling secrets that suggests. As each enormous beast padded up, swaying
  and looking for mischief with his trunk, there was silence to see what
  happened when he manoeuvred into position exactly in front of the main gate,
  and knelt there. They all knew what would happen, but they were excited just
  the same.</p>

  <p>Out stepped the most beautiful, ravishing, marvellous, jewelled, and
  scented nautch-girls the world had ever seen; and all the world that knows
  anything at all is familiar with the fact that the temple girls of Chota Pegu
  are the loveliest anywhere. Are they not brought there when hardly old enough
  to toddle, and trained&mdash;and trained&mdash;and trained until they can not
  only dance all the intricate steps that the gods used to dance in the old
  days when they lived on the earth among mortals, but can even look exactly
  like the goddesses, whose portraits for comparison are on the temple
  wall?</p>

  <p>They had all seen the nautch-girls scores of times, but it was always a
  new thrill; and, this being a merry occasion, it led, of course, to jokes
  that it was a good thing the priests did not hear. Sometimes the priest
  knows when it is wisest not to listen.</p>

  <p>They counted nine-and-forty nautch-girls&mdash;seven times seven&mdash;a
  miracle-working number, portentous of good luck. And the last nautch-girl
  laughed aloud as she got down from the elephant, which was an omen
  positively. Nothing could possibly go wrong after that; there must be new
  amazement coming.</p>

  <p>And there was! The rajah's elephants&mdash;the four that had to be
  supported from the taxes (as distinguished from the priests' elephants, which
  were supported by donations, which is different). The rajah was not there,
  but nobody minded that; the priests had called him a low-caste degenerate,
  and they were no doubt right, being priests, who know everything. But on the
  elephants' backs were the most wonderful people they had ever seen, and
  nobody knew who the people were, which made it thrilling.</p>

  <p>On the front elephant there were two ladies&mdash;great queens presumably.
  One was veiled heavily, but the other wore no veil at all. Her jewellery
  sparkled in the sun&mdash;about a crore's-worth* by the most conservative
  estimate. She was a European queen undoubtedly, for she wore the European
  style of dress&mdash;or so they all supposed, for they had never seen
  anything like it. She was all trigged out in silver and grey, with a hat so
  smothered in flowers that it looked as if she must have stolen them that
  morning with the dew on them from the garden of the gods. She smiled to right
  and left, and her smile would have melted the heart of a moneylender, it was
  so genial and kind and merry.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* crore=million]</p>

  <p>Then everyone said "Ah&mdash;h&mdash;h!" again; for on the second elephant
  there was an emperor&mdash;no less! He wore some jewels, although not so many
  as the lady did; but to make up for lack of them he was robed in shimmering
  silver and golden silk! His turban was woven of silver and golden silk in
  alternate layers, criss-crossed up the front; and there were half a dozen
  ostrich feathers stuck into a brooch in front, that would have made the King
  of England purple with acquisitiveness.</p>

  <p>He was a big man&mdash;broad&mdash;up-sitting&mdash;threw his
  shoulders back as if he were well used to leading armies on parade. No doubt
  he was a great king from foreign parts or somewhere. Heavens! but he was
  dignified. His brow, they agreed, was like a mountain frowning down over the
  sea; and if he hadn't worn a monocle in the English fashion they might almost
  have believed him a god. Nobody ever remembered to have seen an image of a
  god who wore a monocle, so that settled that. But he was wonderful.</p>

  <p>And now another wonder! On the elephant behind him rode a plain,
  undignified, unvarnished English clergyman, in a plain black suit, with a
  white topee, mopping his face with a plain white handkerchief, and seeming
  unused to elephants. That was old "Begum" anyhow, a cow whose gait was always
  more uncomfortable than an earthquake. And serve him right! for he was one of
  those black-dyed rogues who, their priests had frequently assured them, are
  worse than all the devils in the Hindu Pantheon. They laughed to see how
  green his face looked; and some said he looked, too, as if he disapproved the
  whole proceedings, which made it even funnier.</p>

  <p>Then, although the rajah stayed away, there were several of his courtiers,
  who arrived in a troop on horseback; and there was a joke to be made about
  every one of them, because everybody knew how in debt they were and who
  really owned their horses if the truth were out. They let the truth out
  merrily. One wag swore he saw a money-lender's name on the accoutrements, and
  that joke was voted so excellent that thereafter you might have trodden on
  folks' toes without making them angry.</p>

  <p>But the most surprising marvel of all was yet to come. There had been
  plans whispered from lip to ear to climb the sar trees presently and see much
  as might be seen of what should transpire within. The walls were high and
  available trees were some way off; but the glimpses so had would serve to
  weave gossip for months to come. Some boys had even gone to fetch a ladder,
  and they had it stowed in a safe place out of sight. They even had prepared
  what to say to the rajah's poo-bah policeman, in case that worthy should turn
  up and make himself objectionable; there were lots of things that might be
  said, nor any very comforting to his esteem, but they chose the most
  scandalous, that being high festival. Whatever that irascible official might
  say in return, they were determined to climb the trees and remain in the
  branches until the show was over, or until he fetched an axe and cut the
  trees down, which they offered to wager he was much too lazy and dignified to
  do. (All Chota Pegu is willing to bet on a certainty.)</p>

  <p>However, when the last of the court noblemen had dismounted, tossed his
  reins to a ragged <i>sais</i>, and swaggered in, the unbelievable occurred.
  Somebody threw the great front gate open wide and invited them all to enter
  and be seated! They could hardly believe their senses! True, the priests had
  a hand in this, and the priests were always generous providers of pageantry;
  dangerous folk&mdash;mean, grasping, contemptible in many ways&mdash;but
  always willing to let the crowd in on eye-feasts. This, though, was a white
  man's <i>tamasha</i>*. Sahibs did not provide fun for mere village
  folk&mdash;at least not often, and when they did there was always a string to
  it, like higher taxes, or vaccination, or some other scheme for impoverishing
  them in this world and depriving them of heaven in the next.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* howdy-do]</p>

  <p>Everybody knew Iss-tee-range had bought the Panch Mahal, and
  that he had gone mad in there, shooting off his rifles at the rats at night
  and prowling around by day in pyjamas and bare feet. Perhaps this was part of
  his madness.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, there were the gates wide open, and somebody beckoning, so they
  all trooped in, treading on one another's heels for fear
  Iss-tee-range might change his crazy mind and slam the gates in
  the faces of the last ones. But there was lots of room and no hurry after
  all. Chullunder Ghose, perspiring and nervous to the verge of a collapse,
  ushered them into long rows on the side of the courtyard facing the door of
  the assembly&mdash;room (in which all the old scandalous debauches used to be
  held, which everyone agreed were a disgrace to the countryside, and nobody
  would have missed for a year's income if by any means he could worm a way
  in).</p>

  <p>And although there was a fountain between them and the other side of the
  courtyard they could all see nicely, because the fountain was not high, and
  some sort of stage had been erected, reaching nearly the full width of the
  courtyard with its back against the assembly&mdash;room wall. They recognized
  that stage; it was the one the priests used when they provided a ceremony
  outside the temple walls in order that all&mdash;even the very lowest castes
  and the caste-less might benefit. And they knew the screens that stood at
  each end of the stage and in the midst in front of the assembly-room door;
  those were the screens the nautch-girls hid behind, to emerge for the ritual
  dance. They were the screens an old-time rajah&mdash;a real one, not to be
  mentioned in the same breath with this man&mdash;had brought from Burma; and
  some said they had been made in China, or some such far-away land. Whether
  that was true or not, they were wooden, and carved all over with delightful
  dragons, and no man now alive possessed the craftsmanship to fashion others
  like them.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the courtyard, with his back to the fountain, beside the
  image of a god who had four faces so that he might see everything, sat the
  magnificent prince with the monocle; and it was well worth a three-hour wait
  to sit in the sun behind him and study the set of his shoulders and see the
  dignity with which he smoked cigars. The princess with the diamonds and
  without the veil was beside him in an ordinary arm-chair, and he paid her a
  great deal of attention&mdash;much more interesting than the antics of a
  leopard in a cage or any other of the sights they were used to.</p>

  <p>After a while he complained of the sun, in a big brass voice that must
  have awakened the gods, because four temple attendants came and rigged up an
  awning over him and the princess, which rather spoiled the view of those
  behind him, but they overcame that by crowding closer toward the right and
  left.</p>

  <p>The princess in the dark veil was missing, and none could guess what had
  happened to her, which was intriguing. But "Mellidrum
  Iss-tee-range," with a big cigar in his mouth, sat in a chair
  over to the left, with an enormous man beside him who was twice as big as
  Ommonee, and who somebody had said could kill an ox with one blow of his
  fist.</p>

  <p>Everybody hoped he would do that as part of the entertainment. He was a
  sahib such as everybody loved; when he spoke his voice rumbled like
  gun-wheels; and even the stray dog that had found its way in was not afraid
  to go near and sniff him. Iss-tee-range and the big sahib were
  dressed in ordinary serge suits, and Iss-tee-range was smiling
  (as who wouldn't be who owned all the crores and crores he was reported to
  own). But the big sahib looked uncomfortable, which nobody could account for.
  Was he not also an Amelikani? And are not all those people fabulously
  wealthy? Can a man be rich and anxious at the same time? Well, there he was.
  Behold him, fidgeting at intervals and throwing away a good cigar before he
  had smoked the half of it.</p>

  <p>Then, Oh! Watch! Watch! Still! Be still! Make those women hush the babies!
  The musicians come!</p>

  <p>And sure enough, out from behind the screen in the midst of the stage, and
  down the steps in front of it, came twenty-eight members of the temple
  orchestra, each with his string or wind instrument; and then seven drummers
  with tom-toms, making thirty-five in all. They squatted in a long row in
  front of the stage and began there and then to discourse sweet music&mdash;so
  sweet and marvellous that it made the great brass-voiced prince from foreign
  parts call out:</p>

  <p>"Dammy! Can we stick it out? By Gad, by Gad, by Gad!"</p>

  <p>They wondered what language that might be, but did not doubt it was
  applause. And so evidently the musicians understood, for they redoubled their
  efforts; and the princess of the sparkling diamonds sitting beside the great
  prince laughed until they all laughed too, they couldn't help it. Nobody in
  all Chan Pegu ever had half such a wonderful time.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-14"
     id="ch-14"></a>XIV. &mdash; CHULLUNDER GHOSE PRAYS TO ALL THE GODS</h2>

  <p class="first">Up in the little hot room with a hole in the wall that
  provided view of the whole courtyard Ommony stood sweating beside Charley
  Wear who had abandoned native costume because there was no more need of it.
  Charley was arrayed in white duck pants and an undershirt. He looked like a
  gun-layer going into action. But his gun was a machine with a powerful lens,
  whose food was sensitized film instead of cartridges.</p>

  <p>The window was shuttered, which made the air stifling, but there were
  holes through which a man could see, and Ommony, wiping the sweat from his
  neck, clapped an eye to each hole in turn repeatedly, careful not to trip
  over the camera legs that were spraddled out in three directions so that the
  camera looked like an enormous spider ready to spring on its prey below.</p>

  <p>"Can't see my sister anywhere," he grumbled. "Did you notice her come
  in?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Charley. "I was sighting the machine."</p>

  <p>"Damn!" remarked Ommony.</p>

  <p>He realized that he had seen too little of his sister during the last few
  days, and she had all the family proclivity for launching off on independent
  lines of action. Brains she had, and loyalty she had, but scant sense of
  obedience, and too much reliance on her own judgment. He recalled more than
  one occasion when she had taken her own course without waiting to consult
  him. Where the dickens was she?</p>

  <p>"Strange is looking much too pleased with himself," he said presently.</p>

  <p>"It's my belief he knows this camera's up here," said Charley, squatting
  down at last beside his gun, since all was ready. "He glanced up here once or
  twice," he added, wiping the sweat off his hands on the seat of his pants.
  "Gee! Is that what they call music?"</p>

  <p>"Who let the crowd in?" Ommony demanded.</p>

  <p>He had been busy talking to an emissary from the priests in one of the
  other rooms, and the man had been so deliberately stupid that everything had
  to be said three or four times over, so that Ommony had missed quite a lot of
  what went on.</p>

  <p>"Dunno," said Charley. "The babu acted usher.''</p>

  <p>"Damn that babu!"</p>

  <p>"He seems like a kind of humorous guy to me," said Charley. But that
  remark was only further irritation.</p>

  <p>Ommony had worse than doubt of the babu, He more than suspected him. He
  was willing to take oath that Chullunder Ghose was up to mischief on his own
  account, making money out of the proceedings in some ingenious way. For one
  thing, he was nearly sure he had an understanding with the priests; and he
  did not flatter himself for one minute that his own bargain with the priests
  was worth an arena if the priests should discover another means of getting
  what they wanted. They had promised nothing&mdash;merely permitted him to
  infer that they would fulfil their part; and he would not have felt much
  easier even if they had made a definite promise.</p>

  <p>"Rascals!" he muttered, over and over again.</p>

  <p>Well: it was too late now to change anything or call the whole proceedings
  off. He foresensed disaster; but in that event he knew what he would do.
  There would be pictures, that much was certain&mdash;pictures that would make
  Strange look ridiculous&mdash;that, if a government a thousand miles away
  should see them, would show Strange in an intriguing light. If worse came to
  worst, he would go down into the courtyard and dare Strange to do a thing
  about the forest&mdash;threaten him&mdash;tell him of the pictures. And there
  was a rope-ladder all ready for Charley to make his escape with the exposed
  reels. If Strange should laugh at the threats, then the reels should go to
  Simla and be shown there.</p>

  <p>His whole plan began to look like a nightmare that might end anyway except
  satisfactorily, and the infernal music in the courtyard heightened the
  suggestion, grating on nerves already on end from lack of sleep and proper
  meals. He had tried to oversee too many things at once, and knew it.</p>

  <p>Charley, eyeing him thoughtfully, diagnosed stage-fright and tried to
  comfort him.</p>

  <p>"You should not worry," he said. "You'll have done your best. That's all a
  man <i>can</i> do."</p>

  <p>But Ommony's creed is stern. He must save the forest. India, the world,
  the universe would undoubtedly continue to evolve, whatever happened. But
  there would be no excuse acceptable in face of leagues and leagues of
  slaughtered trees. There was his life's work. When his own hour came to face
  his Karma there would be the dreadful question&mdash;just, simple,
  inescapable&mdash;"What ha' you <i>done</i>?"</p>

  <p>Not what the other man did. What had he, Cottswold Ommony, done? Where
  were the trees entrusted to his keeping? Sincerely, simply, he would rather
  die than fail the forest. His own personal honour and advantage weighed
  nothing in the scale.</p>

  <p>"Gee! The light off that wall's perfect!" said Charley, scattering
  encouragement at random in the hope that some might stick.</p>

  <p>"Keep Strange in focus. That's the main thing."</p>

  <p>"Can't do a close-up from here, you know. He'll show small but
  recognizable."</p>

  <p>"Are you ready?" Ommony snapped suddenly. "Shoot then!"</p>

  <p>And the crank of the camera began turning steadily, sixteen times a
  minute.</p>

  <p>Below, the weird stringed instruments burst into sudden spasms of twanged
  noise and the flutes screamed through that while the thumping of the tom-toms
  rose and fell. Out filed the nautch-girls from behind the screen&mdash;bare
  of stomach&mdash;breasts hidden under tinselled shields&mdash;skirted to the
  knees in pale blue gauzy stuff. Half moved to the right, half to the left,
  until their line stretched from end to end across the stage and they all
  stood motionless, leaving a gap in their midst through which the forty-ninth,
  the "leading lady," came.</p>

  <p>She was unlike all the others&mdash;prettier; and such scant garments as
  she wore were bronze instead of blue. The bosses on her breasts were studded
  with uncut jewels, and her bracelets glittered. In either hand she held
  garlands made from flower buds threaded on strings, and as she swayed her
  lithe body those shook until they looked like wind-blown blossom falling from
  the trees. But that was not their purpose. She had other use for them.
  Strange sat smiling with a big cigar stuck upward in the corner of his mouth,
  having his money's worth so far by the look of him, and much too pleased with
  himself.</p>

  <p>"You wait!" muttered Ommony. "You forest robber! Wait!"</p>

  <p>But he had an eye, too, for Zelmira, whose golden Indian bracelet rose and
  fell as she tried to find some intelligible rhythm in the music. It did not
  seem to Ommony that she was paying sufficient attention; she should have been
  watching for her cue, instead of whispering to Molyneux and laughing at the
  man's jokes. Molyneux was perfectly capable of spoiling the whole thing by
  keeping her there beside him, instead of letting her slip away behind the
  scenes.</p>

  <p>However, the nautch was on. Ommony's urgent business was to stand ready to
  hand Charley a fresh reel and slip the exposed one into its steel box, so
  that they might miss as few incidents as possible.</p>

  <p>The music diminished to proportions in which some rhythm was at last
  perceptible, and the forty-nine girls began to sing, swaying from the feet
  upward, rather like plants seeking to uproot themselves than women dancing.
  The long line moved in ripples like waving corn, and the song was a wail,
  mad-melancholy, but redeemed by golden notes and the faint, far-away peal of
  a bronze bell struck from behind the scenes at intervals.</p>

  <p>It was a long dance, and a language. Each motion was a symbol that had
  meant the same since India arose from prehistoric sea-bed and became a land;
  plainer and fuller of meaning than words to eyes uneducated in the changing
  symbols of the West. It was a simple enough story, of seed, rain, growth, and
  harvest, with fertilizing wind a-blow through all of it, and all the while a
  lipped hymn to the ancient gods who cause such sequences to
  be&mdash;melancholy only because men refused to recognize the breath of God
  in all things.</p>

  <p>These were the temple virgins&mdash;institution older than the
  hills&mdash;no more conscious of the inner meaning of the ancient rite than
  their audience, that looked for phallic impropriety, and found it, India
  having descended into evil days. Production, reproduction, birth, and
  evolution, all were mocked in a rite designed to glorify them. But it pleased
  Strange. He chewed on his cigar, and smiled with hands across his stomach,
  like a bald-head in the front row at the Gaiety. It was expensive. He had
  paid too much for the Panch Mahal. But this was a pretty good make-weight
  they had thrown in.</p>

  <p>You could see him wondering what the fellows at the club would say when he
  told them all about it. Not many Englishmen, and no Americans, had ever seen
  that dance. There was one Englishman who did not want to see it, and the
  village audience chuckled, for the padre-sahib, who had been sitting out of
  sight of them on a low chair in front of the image of the four-faced god,
  came around and sat between it and them, where he could not see the
  stage.</p>

  <p>The music changed, as if the padre-sahib's mood invited it. It defied
  him&mdash;mocked his disapproval rose into a wild confusion of wailing wind
  and thrumming strings, with the drums doing galloping footfalls. The
  eight-and-forty nautch-girls stood nearly motionless, swaying only slightly
  from the waist. But she in the midst, with a glittering gossamer shawl to aid
  her, began a serpent dance, like the fabled madness of the pythons in the
  spring. And that was devilish.</p>

  <p>"Get this!" urged Ommony. "Focus on her now, and follow her whatever
  happens!"</p>

  <p>"Dammit, she moves too quick!" said Charley. "She's the goods, if she'd go
  slow!"</p>

  <p>"Aim for her and nothing else! We'll get some of it."</p>

  <p>There came eight priests chanting, and walking slowly out from behind the
  screen&mdash;filed down the steps&mdash;and stood in line between them and
  where Strange sat&mdash;backs to the audience&mdash;cutting Strange off, as
  it were, from the common herd. And Ommony laughed, for he saw Jeff Ramsden
  nudge Strange and clench his fist. There was going to be a fight unless the
  priests should watch their step, and that would serve perfectly. Anything, in
  fact, would serve that should give Zelmira her chance to rescue Strange from
  a predicament.</p>

  <p>But Strange whispered behind his hand, and Jeff sat back again apparently
  contented. And why had Zelmira not vanished behind the wings? She should have
  gone already, but there she sat still beside Molyneux, without a trouble in
  the world to look at her.</p>

  <p>"Another reel, quick!" snapped Charley. "This is hot stuff!"</p>

  <p>The python dance was languishing to long, slow, undulating movements that
  the camera could record, and fingers slippery with sweat worked feverishly to
  snap the fresh reel in and resume cranking. Ommony clapped his eye to a hole
  in the shutter again, and almost shouted:</p>

  <p>"Get this now! Get this! Are you sure you're on?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, I've got it. It's good."</p>

  <p>Slowly down the steps the nautch-girl came, pausing on every step to let
  the python spirit torture her into new, monstrous shapes. The priests' chant
  and the music rose to wilder heights. The other nautch-girls swayed in a sort
  of delirious ecstasy, humming <i>obbligato</i> to the priests. The native
  audience moved in unison, their breath expiring in great gasps all together.
  Suddenly Strange let his cigar fall, and sat bolt upright.</p>

  <p>"Keep her in the picture now!" said Ommony excitedly.</p>

  <p>The dancing-girl ceased writhing like a snake and suddenly ran toward
  Strange as if he were her only love. For a second it looked as if she would
  embrace him, and all the audience drew it's breath in sibilantly. But
  instead, she tossed the garlands over his neck and swept back six paces,
  pausing a if to admire him, while the music and the chorus rose to a scream
  and the tom-toms thundered.</p>

  <p>Next she advanced and threw her veil before him, knelt on it as if
  imploring him, and backed away, withdrawing veil and all as if he had
  rejected her advance and she was broken-hearted. Then forward again as if to
  fall into his arms, he grinning, and away before he could touch her, not a
  thread of her gossamer shawl as much as brushing against his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Hah-hah!" laughed Molyneux; and for the first time it seemed to dawn on
  Strange that possibly he was being mocked. He began to look uncomfortable and
  a trifle flushed.</p>

  <p>"Hah-hah!" Molyneux laughed again, and the audience all began to laugh
  too, because that kind of jeer is contagious.</p>

  <p>But the dancing-girl danced on, and the music wailed and shrieked in time
  to the dinning tom-toms until Strange, feeling all eyes on him, glanced to
  right and left looking as if he would like to escape. It is all very well to
  be made a lot of, but to be worshipped in public by a lady in diaphanous
  attire is more than even millionaires can stand. He glanced up once as if he
  knew the camera was recording everything.</p>

  <p>"Did you see that?" said Charley. And as he spoke the woman let her gauzy
  shawl fall over Strange's head and shoulders. The audience yelled as if she
  had crowned him king.</p>

  <p>"Did you get it?" squealed Ommony.</p>

  <p>Strange did not know what to do. He simply sat there looking foolish. But
  Chullunder Ghose appeared from behind somewhere and stood beside him, urging,
  protesting, gesticulating. Jeff Ramsden laid a hand on Strange's sleeve, but
  Strange shook it off; and the girl began to dance as if luring Strange on to
  heaven knew what behind the dragon screens. Chullunder Ghose took him by the
  right arm and almost pulled him out of the chair, ignoring Jeff's protests.
  Jeff shook his fist in the babu's face, and Molyneux barked "Hah-hah!" again,
  while the audience squealed above the din of music. The girl began backing
  away, and Strange, yielding to Chullunder Ghose, got up and followed her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, gorgeous!" chuckled Ommony.</p>

  <p>"'Nother reel, quick!" snapped Charley.</p>

  <p>They reloaded like a destroyer's gun-crew at battle practice, in time to
  catch Strange sprawling up the steps in the girl's wake, for somebody or
  something tripped him. And when he reached the stage the nautch-girls all
  surrounded him and danced in a whirl, so that for a minute nothing could be
  seen of Strange at all; it was as if he had been swallowed. They had his coat
  and collar off, for someone flung them at Zelmira's feet, where she sat
  beside Molyneux, bubbling laughter. And when the whirling circle broke at
  last and the girls spread outward either way along the stage the python-girl
  was gone, and there stood Strange arrayed in a peacock robe and turban with
  aigrette, looking pompous and ridiculous with boots and trousers showing
  underneath. Zelmira's laugh rang like a peal of bells, and Strange frowned at
  her.</p>

  <p>"Damn the woman!" muttered Ommony. "She's done for herself now, that
  settles it!"</p>

  <p>It was hotter than a Turkish bath in there, but a cold chill swept over
  him at the thought that none now would have sufficient hold on Strange to
  make him let the forest go. Half of the plan had failed with Zelmira's
  influence. Surely Strange would never listen to her now. Well: there was the
  other half of the plan&mdash;the alternative. Strange looked ridiculous
  enough, and worse was coming. There would be the pictures to hold over him by
  way of threat.</p>

  <p>Chullunder Ghose, acting fat, obsequious impresario, climbed the steps and
  began tutoring Strange again&mdash;pointing toward the wooden dragon-screen.
  His words were totally inaudible in the din of drums and music, but he seemed
  to insist on something prearranged, with one hand gesturing toward the
  priests, as if he spoke for them, and with the other pushing Strange toward
  the dragon-screen. And out of the mouth of the dragon came a hand&mdash;a
  woman's&mdash;certainly the python-dancer's, for the wrist had the same
  heavy, jewelled bracelet.</p>

  <p>The music crashed, and ceased. In silence, broken only by a crow's caw on
  the roof, Strange walked toward the hand, and seized and kissed it three
  times. Crash! went the music again, and the native audience seemed suddenly
  to go mad, rising and leaping and yelling as if all their future had depended
  on that one piece of foolishness.</p>

  <p>"Have you got that?"</p>

  <p>"Got it all!"</p>

  <p>"Good! Carry on now! I'll go below. You keep on cranking as long as you've
  a foot of film left!"</p>

  <p>Ommony nearly broke the key in his eagerness to get out&mdash;slammed the
  door nearly off its hinges&mdash;and ran stumbling down the stairs, kicking
  open the door at the bottom and wading through the audience like a man
  waist-deep in sea-water. Zelmira nodded to him, but he took no notice of her;
  she had failed the forest, and was out of his calculations for good and all.
  He was actually off his head that minute&mdash;worn out with worry and fear
  and lack of sleep&mdash;fired by the sight of victory almost within his
  grasp. Strange was still standing there, ridiculously foolish with his turban
  awry, looking rather like Henry the Eighth, and holding the hand through the
  screen.</p>

  <p>"Chullunder Ghose! Tell him what that means!" yelled Ommony, not
  recognizing his own voice, it was so strained and high pitched. Jeff Ramsden,
  recognizing breakdown, understanding men as some know horses, began making
  his way toward him. The babu grinned, aping humility, bowing and salaaming to
  Strange, too deferent at last to play a leading part. He began to back away
  and nearly fell off the stage.</p>

  <p>"Strange, you're married!" Ommony roared, his voice cracking strangely.
  "That's the custom! What'll you do now? Every one of those nautch-girls has
  to marry before she dies. Most of 'em marry trees. That one's got you! Now
  then!"</p>

  <p>Strange had the effrontery not even to seem sheepish or annoyed. Jeff,
  getting close enough at last, put his huge arm under Ommony's and tried to
  quiet him; but Ommony only drew strength from the contact, not calmness.</p>

  <p>"You're married, you hear me? You've married a nautch-girl before
  witnesses!"</p>

  <p>It was unseemly&mdash;horrible Ommony was screaming at him. Strange with
  his hunger to exploit had probed the man's secret passion to its depths and
  driven all that was evil in him to the surface. He was worse than a woman
  with her child condemned to death, for in that hour he lacked power to
  plead&mdash;a primitive, abysmal human stricken to the heart and fighting
  back. He struck Jeff's arm away, and Molyneux rose from his chair to help
  restrain him.</p>

  <p>But Strange's answer brought them all to a stand-still.</p>

  <p>"May I have a Christian ceremony, then?"</p>

  <p>The last chance gone! The monster was willing to marry a nautch-girl He
  would use that technicality to reinforce his claim on the forest! Ommony
  stood dumb, bewildered, with the world swaying under his feet, unconscious of
  Jeff's arm again through his&mdash;staring at Strange as at Nemesis.</p>

  <p>And Strange let go the hand. Grinning, he stepped to the side of the
  screen to bring the woman forward; and she came, looking scared, because
  Ommony fainted away.</p>

  <p>She was Ommony's sister.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was an hour before he returned to consciousness, and the
  priests, the nautch-girls, and the crowd were all gone. Two women were
  slapping his hands, and he recognized Zelmira first&mdash;hazily, as one
  awaking from a bad dream. He shook his head at her.</p>

  <p>"Go away!"</p>

  <p>"We're friends. You know me," she answered.</p>

  <p>But he only shook his head again.</p>

  <p>"You failed. You promised me you'd be behind the screen and marry Strange.
  Why didn't you?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't. How could I? I'm Lady Molyneux! Sir William Molyneux and I
  were married this morning at seven o'clock."</p>

  <p>"I'll be damned!" murmured Ommony; and Molyneux' responsive "Hah-hah-hah!"
  seemed to revive him quite a little. He turned his head to see who held the
  other hand, and looked into his sister's eyes.</p>

  <p>"You always would do things your own way," he grumbled. "Have you saved
  the forest?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Here's Meldrum. He'll tell you so."</p>

  <p>Ommony sat up suddenly. Memory galvanized him.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Kate, you're married to him!"</p>

  <p>"No," she said, smiling, "not quite. We're waiting for you to attend the
  wedding. When you're ready we'll begin."</p>

  <p>"You saved the forest?" he repeated. "Marry anyone you like!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, closer than a brother!" she laughed delightedly. "Come, Meldrum. Tell
  him."</p>

  <p>So Meldrum Strange came forward and played the man.</p>

  <p>"Old fellow," he said simply, "If I had known how your heart was wrapped
  up in those trees I'd never have caused you such agony. I beg your
  pardon."</p>

  <p>"By Dammy, Ommony, shake hands with him!" roared Molyneux. "He's played
  the game. He turned the tables on you. He's a good sport after all. What's
  more, he's given this Panch Mahal to those rascally priests. No chance for
  anybody now to get a foothold. Go on, shake hands!"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," said Ommony. "Where's Charley Wear?"</p>

  <p>"Here. I'm all right," said Charley. Then he answered the question
  unspoken on Ommony's lips. "Strange has been damn decent. He bought the film
  for enough to finance a picture-shooting trip all through the Indian jungles.
  Darned white of him, I'll say."</p>

  <p>"All right, I'll shake hands with you, Strange," said Ommony.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>But Ommony was ill, and very nearly at death's door. He collapsed when he
  had seen his sister married, and they put him to bed on the cot in the
  assembly-room, the women taking turns to watch him; and for four-and-twenty
  hours he raved in delirium, calling to half the gods of India to come and
  save his trees, while half a dozen naked junglis camped in the courtyard
  afraid of every-one, but more afraid they might lose Ommony.</p>

  <p>They found roots in the jungle, and they killed fresh meat, and brought
  them and laid them at the threshold, where the women stumbled over them and
  carried them in&mdash;to hide them and pretend they had been put to use. So
  the junglis tell you to this day that they own Ommony by right of capture
  from death's claws. (It was they who brought him his dog Diana, to stand
  guard by the bed; and she did, never stirring until he was well enough to
  recognize her.)</p>

  <p>Then came a night when the women might safely leave him; and he awoke
  after dark, believing himself all alone with the dog. But after a while he
  heard another sound beside her breathing, and saw a white-robed figure dimly
  outlined in the night-lamp glow&mdash;a figure like a great fat idol,
  motionless. For a long time he thought it was an idol, until he remembered
  there was nothing of that kind in the room. So he coughed, and it brought the
  thing to life.</p>

  <p>"This babu salaams respectfully, hoping sahib is remarkably better!"</p>

  <p>"Did the dog let you in?"</p>

  <p>"No, sahib. She-dog was most cantankerous, until memsahib, sahib's sister,
  tendered philharmonic offices. She-dog yielded to blandishment and shrewd
  behaviour. Have sat still."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib's swift recovery."</p>

  <p>"What else?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, just to round out."</p>

  <p>"What?</p>

  <p>"Emolument!"</p>

  <p>"You rascal! You drew pay from Madame Poul&mdash;from Lady Molyneux."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib. Likewise percentage from priests in form of cash, <i>and</i>
  subsidy from rajah, plus gift from Mellidrum Isstrange, added to share of
  profit from sale of soda-water. Am well contented. Oh, no reason to complain.
  However, sahib being babu's friend, in view of Karma and advantage of
  beneficence&mdash;have thought it well to&mdash;permit sahib to&mdash;acquire
  much merit by&mdash;by contributing like-wise and rounding
  out&mdash;emolument? Eh? Yes, sahib? Your very humble and obedient servant!
  Chullunder Ghose prays to all the Gods for your honour's full recovery!"</p>
