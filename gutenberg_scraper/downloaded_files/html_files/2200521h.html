<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In writing the life of Byron in the form of a novel I have
endeavoured, as in <i>The Divine Lady</i> and in my other books, to
touch biography with imagination and to present the essential
truth as I see clothing the historic record with speech and action.
From historic truth I have never knowingly departed, having
consulted the best sources of information, such as Lord Lovelace,
Miss Mayne, Moore, and many other authorities.</p>

<p>The letters though often condensed are all authentic, with the
exception of a note from Lady Melbourne to Miss Milbanke in Chapter
VI. Miss Milbanke's verses are also imaginary. I do not know
whether any of her verses (which Byron commended) have
survived.</p>

<p>The sequence of events must be crowded into a smaller stage than
that set by Life, the great Romancer, and therefore exactitude in
dates is sometimes impossible.</p>

<p>It has not been my part to moralize this tremendous story, but
simply to set down the facts and their issues as I see them.</p>

<p class="poem">"And now the Lord of the unerring Bow,<br>
The God of life and poesy and light.<br>
The Sun in human limbs arrayed, and brow<br>
All radiant from his triumph in the fight."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Byron.</p>

<p>The Nemesis of the Byron ill-luck had pursued him from birth,
and yet on that day one would have thought it might have spared
him. But everything had gone wrong.</p>

<p>In his lodgings in St. James's Street Byron stood, white as
death, shaken by a nerve storm, trembling in every limb, the ordeal
before him of taking his seat in the House of Lords without the
countenance, support or introduction of any of his peers, as lonely
a young man as any in London. Not that formal introduction was
necessary in the routine of business, but believing it to be so, he
had written to his kinsman and guardian, the Earl of Carlisle, to
remind him that he would take his seat at the opening of the
session, expecting at least some show of family support. He had
received a cold reply, referring him to the custom of the House,
feeling he had laid himself open to a calculated rebuff, his
self-consciousness suffered accordingly.</p>

<p>And this was not all. He discovered to his horror that before
taking his seat he must produce evidence of his grandfather's
marriage with Miss Trevanion of Caerhayes, and his solicitors
reported that there was no family record as to where it had taken
place, no legal record that it had ever been celebrated. Byron was
almost mad with anxiety and dismay. Without that proof he could not
take his seat, and himself and his peerage must be alike
discredited. And God knows, he reflected bitterly, the Byrons had
had discredit enough and to spare, and cursed bad luck as well. To
him at times the peerage appeared designed only to draw attention
to misfortunes and ill-doings much better forgotten. They haunted
him, defacing his pride in it like a smear on the face of a
portrait which must catch the eye of all beholders before they have
time to appraise the likeness.</p>

<p>Indeed, the family history was far from pleasant reading. There
was a highly picturesque "Sir John the Little with the Great
Beard," a Byron of Harry the Eighth's time, who had received from
that august hand a grant of the Priory of Newstead&mdash;no doubt an
ancestor to plume oneself upon at the safe distance of three
centuries, had it not been that Sir John's morals were
unfortunately as picturesque as his beard and his eldest son was,
alas, <i>filius naturalis</i>. It could pass no otherwise, and for
all time the bar sinister divided the successors from that Norman
ancestry with which every well-found peerage should be decorated.
That memory was loathsome to Byron.</p>

<p>The peerage itself came later, the reward of devotion to a
family as unlucky as the Byrons themselves; the Stuarts. Charles
the First granted it, and passed, and then set in an era of poverty
and tedium, and no Byron distinguished himself until the fourth
baron, and he did so in a way the family could have well dispensed
with. He killed his cousin, Mr. Chaworth, in a duel so far outside
the line of even the elastic code of the eighteenth century duel,
that he was tried for wilful murder by his peers and found guilty
of manslaughter. Apart from this, he was a village tyrant, who
drove his wife from her home by ill-usage and, installing a tawdry
"Lady Betty" in her place, disgraced himself and all his
connections. And when this wicked old man died, as old in years as
in wickedness, he was succeeded by "the little boy at Aberdeen,"
the Byron whom the world will not forget.</p>

<p>So much for the peerage, but "the little boy at Aberdeen" was no
happier in his parents. His grandmother, a lady of the great
Berkeley blood, had married Admiral Byron, a cadet of the family
and brother of "the wicked lord," and became by that marriage
mother of one of the worst scapegraces of the eighteenth century.
Her son was that Mad Jack Byron whose wild escapades were the talk
of the town, the Berkeley blood mingling with the Byron in most
explosive fashion. And this was the poet's father.</p>

<p>When Mad Jack was twenty-two years of age, he seduced the
beautiful Marchioness of Carmarthen from her husband and children,
the wicked Byron charm proving irresistible, as it had done and was
to do to many women. He married her after the divorce and had by
her a daughter, Augusta; married again, on her death. Miss Gordon
of Gight, a Scotch heiress in a small way, possessed of some ready
money available for his debts. She was descended from the Scotch
royal blood, but a passionate, uncontrolled, coarse creature with
no ladyhood in her and nothing at all to attract her errant husband
when the fortune, such as it was, was spent. Fortunately he died
six years after their marriage. There is a glimpse of her in
girlhood from no less a hand than Sir Walter Scott's, who saw her
screaming and shrieking hysterically at a theatre where the great
Mrs. Siddons had stirred her overwrought sensibilities&mdash;a woman of
innate vulgarity and violence. Her wretched marriage with Mad Jack
Byron worked her up almost to madnesses of rage and grief,
affecting not only herself, but her son through life.</p>

<p>He, the boy the world remembers, was bom four years after his
half-sister Augusta, who was rescued by her maternal grandmother,
Lady Holderness, from the too evident wrath to come of the second
wife and removed from the desperately undesirable Byron
surroundings to a more tranquil sphere which promised well enough
for her future. The boy was left to fate and his mother. But the
child sheltered in the Holderness household was not to escape the
taint of her blood.</p>

<p>These two unhappy children, half-brother and sister, represent
the sorrows of their line to some purpose. They overshadowed them,
black-winged, and when we understand better the problems of life
and death, we shall know that when the Greeks spoke of the
inexorable dooming of the Three Sisters, they meant in one
word&mdash;Heredity.</p>

<p>So the Byrons, in spite of their peerage, stood alone in their
last representative at the moment when the young man might hope to
retrieve that evil past.</p>

<p>The men of law had discovered, with infinite pains and
considerable cost, that Admiral Byron's marriage with Miss
Trevanion had taken place in a private chapel in Cornwall, and so
far all was well. But the episode occasioned talk, it resurrected
family ghosts better laid and it made Byron's difficult position
more difficult and his uneasy self-consciousness a torturing
flame.</p>

<p>He stood now in the sitting room of his lodgings in St. James's
Street, seeking for resolution to face the House without a quiver:
a peer, and yet without one man in the body he was about to join on
whom he could count for a welcoming look or word.</p>

<p>He had had many bitter moments of poverty and slight in his
young life, but this was the bitterest, and when he thought of his
entry alone, uncertain, unwanted, he was trembling on the verge of
resolution to fling the whole thing overboard, take ship for the
wilds of Europe and be seen and heard no more in England. Ferocious
hatred of the country and every one in it shot out of him like
fire. To make himself heard, felt, to be revenged on Lord Carlisle,
on any one and everything which stood coldly aloof, careless of his
pain&mdash;what other comfort could there be in all the world?</p>

<p>Should he go? Should he not go? Not a living soul would care
which decision he made. Lord Carlisle might smile his thin, almost
imperceptible smile. Augusta's grand relations might say that
nothing better could be expected from the son of that appalling
Gordon woman, who had outraged the sensibilities of Lord Carlisle
and every member of the family who, for his sins, had had to do
with her&mdash;a woman who had only £150 a year after Mad Jack Byron had
plundered her, who had brought up her boy almost as a vagrant until
he had succeeded to the title! What could he be expected to turn
out? The comments! Her son knew very well what they must be. Could
he nerve himself to go through with it? His heart beat in his
throat and choked him.</p>

<p>A quick step on the stair. A man's voice at the door&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, Byron, can I come in? Why&mdash;what the devil&mdash;you're as white
as death! What is it?"</p>

<p>Dallas, a kinsman, a friend. Are our friends and relations ever
tactful in the moment and manner of their intrusion? Byron
shuddered with annoyance, yet felt that inspection had its bracing
qualities. And, atter all, to go utterly alone down to Westminster
seemed the uttermost of hurniliation to his tense nerves. Dallas
was better than nothing.</p>

<p>He loosed his grip of the chair and was smiling at once through
fixed lips.</p>

<p>"The very pest of a nuisance! There never was a poor devil with
luck like mine. I must take my seat to-day in that old Museum of
Fogies, the House of Lords, and having unfortunately been seduced
into making a night of it with some Paphian girls and their usual
concomitants of drink and dishes, here I am almost in a fit of
frenzy with nervous pains in the head. Do I look white? God knows I
feel it! Take me as far as the House, Dallas, and bring some brandy
to kick me through the tomfoolery."</p>

<p>Dallas stood looking at him with a peculiar expresion. He was as
sure as that he stood there that this was mere "bam," that Byron
was suffering from stage fright. He could swear his dinner had
consisted of hard bisciuts and soda water, eaten alone, and that he
had spent the night in counting the hours to this awful day, in
alternating convulsions of pride and terror.</p>

<p>For Dallas, as a kinsman, was behind the scenes of Byron's
temperament and knew pretty how to gauge this contempt for the
Museum of Fogies, which in reality meant so much more to him than
to most men. He sat down and looked at him through narrowed eyes,
with a question behind them, half envious, hal cynical. After all,
one could not have much pity for a young man with birth, beauty and
a peerage who might repair his broken fortune by picking and
choosing among the wealthiest women in England if he played his
cards with reasonable dexterity. No doubt be had an atrocious
mother and there was his slight lameness from an injury to the
tendons of one foot at birth, but, all said and done, the
agreeables sent the scales of the disagreeables flying aloft, in
Dallas's opinion, and there were few young men in England who would
not change places with Byron if they could.</p>

<p>"Damn bad luck you're so mossy!" he said coolly. "But how came
you to be so weak, my friend, on the eve of such a tremendous
occasion?"</p>

<p>Byron laughed, from the teeth outward, as the French say.</p>

<p>"Tremendous? I suppose you might call it so, but my reverence
for my country's institutions don't carry me so far, I regret to
say. The thing's a trifle, and a foolish one, but none the less I
have no wish to make a pother by fainting at the Lord Chancellor's
feet. So come along and be my bottle-holder as far as
Westminster."</p>

<p>Dallas stared.</p>

<p>"But surely&mdash;you can never mean to say you're going alone? My
Lord Carlisle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear man, is it possible you believe I would submit to be
led like a good little boy to the Woolsack by that old dotard? I
have a satire in my desk at this moment on his paralytic pulings as
a poet, which will show you and the world what I think of my
valuable guardian! No, no! The company of a friend like yourself to
the door, and I shall know how to carry myself. But for this cursed
pain in my temples, I wouldn't even ask this office of friendship,
if not agreeable to yourself."</p>

<p>"More than agreeable!" Dallas assured him, and sat wondering
what the <i>dessous</i> of the Carlisle business was, while Byron
made his final arrangements. He would have given much to know.
These family matters naturally interest even remoter branches.
Already there was a thick atmosphere of talk about the Byron
<i>ménage</i> at Newstead Abbey. The debts, duns, Mrs. Byron's
extravagant temper, her unbridled tongue, her weakness for the
wines left in the scantily provided cellars, were the bases of
scandal no doubt, but there was more. Byron himself was odd, unlike
other young men of standing. He certainly provoked all manner of
speculation.</p>

<p>They got into the carriage and drove down to Westminster from
the lodgings in St. James's Street. A short drive and Byron was
dumb all the way, near the end of his self-control and desperately
holding on to the fragments. A word would have jarred them into
nothing. Dallas knew that, and sat staring out into the smurr of
rain and fog and pitifully bedrabbled streets, their mud splashing
from the wheels of many hackney coaches on the garments of
unfortunates who were walking along the slippery cobble-stones. A
horrid day. Each of them took a dram from the csse bottle.</p>

<p>In the same silence Byron got out when they reached the august
portals, and, with a would-be air of acquaintanceship with the
place and procedure, nodded to Dallas, tossing a "Wait for me&mdash;the
operation won't take long," behind him, and went off, limping more
than usual in a nervous hurry and excitement which he would not
have had visible for the world. Dallas leaned back and
pondered.</p>

<p>A queer fellow&mdash;a very queer fellow. There could be very few men
of his standing in the same position. Newstead Abbey was a place
that reflected credit on its owner (and, really, on the whole
family) of the sort any man might envy, in spite of its poverty and
disrepair. Yet what had it amounted to? The county gentry and their
ladies fought shy of "the Dowager," as Byron called her, and she
and her son had been more or less isolated ever since he had
succeeded his grand-uncle. That was partly owing to her oddities&mdash;a
barrel of a woman, with the temper of a devil and the manners&mdash;the
less said about them the better.</p>

<p>And what did Byron do with himself at the Abbey, while his meek
mamma raged with inflamed face and temper at a distance?</p>

<p>He was particular that his friends should know he sat in company
with a human skull, dug up from the monks' graveyard and put to the
sacrilegious use of a loving-cup when he wished to be desperately
wicked. He had the girl down there sometimes who, dressed as a boy,
had kept him company in lodgings at Brompton and at Brighton when
he left Cambridge, a frizzle-headed fool with a cockney accent to
tear your ears, who declared of the horse she rode&mdash;"It was gave me
by my brother, his Lordship." It was known that in the Dowager's
absence there had been a gathering at the Abbey where Byron, in the
robes of an abbot, entertained four Cambridge friends as tonsured
monks, the Paphian girls of this desperate party being in private
life the cook and housemaid, with the cockney demoiselle, and this
mummery had got abroad among the county gentry and emphasized their
distrust of New stead Abbey and all its ways.</p>

<p>Still, Dallas knew very well that such pranks would, in any
other case, have been taken as the perfectly excusable and possibly
lovable follies of a young man of quality, who must be expected to
sow a plenteous crop of wild oats before he left husbandry of the
sort and became a prop of Church and State. All that was nothing.
What, then, was the mysterious something about Byron which set him
apart, had already labelled him "Doubtful," and would probably in
the future label him "Dangerous," even as his grandfather, the
Wicked Lord, and Mad Jack, his father, had been labelled?</p>

<p>It was wearisome to watch the rain dripping in runnels down the
panes of the window. Dallas betook himself to memory by way of
diversion.</p>

<p>He had certainly thought Byron at the age of nineteen as
unprepossessing a young man as could be. He was enormousty
corpulent for his height of five feet eight, his features all but
obliterated in a tide of fleshy tissue, giving him an expression of
moony good-nature entirely belying the aesthetic anguish and
self-contempt which lay behind it. He remembered quizzing Byron on
the subject and pointing out that his road to fame as the Fat Boy
was assured&mdash;that, or some such cruelty&mdash;and he was not likely to
forget the blinding fury that broke forth and left them both
speechless and staring. It had frightened Byron himself when it was
over. That was a point which Dallas never touched humorously again.
Of course, it was disgusting, revolting, if one had ambitions, and
obviously his unwieldy mother was a malignant prophecy of his
future. He must just grin and bear it.</p>

<p>That was an outsider's view of the case, not the sufferer's.</p>

<p>Byron did neither. He went down to Newstead Abbey and took
himself in hand with a kind of cruel zest and self-loathing. Rumors
reached Dallas of austerities far exceeding any of those practised
by the long-dead monks of the Priory. He heard of a daily diet of
biscuits and soda water with a meal <i>de luxe</i> once a day of
boiled rice soaked in vinegar, washed down with Epsom salts,
digested with violent exercise and hot baths reminiscent of Trajan
and the decadence of Rome. The aspirant to leanness lay in hot
water, lived in it, except when he was tearing about the country on
his horse, with the dog "Boatswain" racing behind him.</p>

<p>Well, what then? If Byron liked to kill himself, he could, but
any sensible man knew it would make no difference to a family
tendency like that. Absurd vanity&mdash;did any one ever hear the like!
That is, if it were true. It might only be another Newstead story.
One had a sort of contempt for the whole thing.</p>

<p>Of course Byron had another side. He was beginning to write&mdash;had
quite a nice little taste for verses of the satiric order and for
fugitive love lyrics, not quite so chaste as could be wished,
chiefly addressed to young women of the third-rate society of a
provincial town or to girls whom one might take even less
seriously. Such was Dallas's view.</p>

<p>Lately, however, there had been a much more ambitious effort,
nothing less than a full-fledged satire on celebrated English
writers and their audacious Scotch reviewers, and this Dallas, with
his literary experience, had liked well enough to offer to see
through the press, a process quite outside Byron's comprehension.
It was verdantly youthful, mistook bitterness for wit, and would
attract attention, Dallas thought, much after the same fashion as a
cur yapping in the street at respected heels. Still&mdash;it was
readable, its audacity was amazing, and since Byron, towering on
his barony, declined to touch a farthing produced by his pen, it
might be amusing to see how the world and the libelled would take
such a skit, especially if one could turn an honest penny by it. It
appeared to him that Byron, conscious of failure in all else, meant
to pose as a misanthrope, a waspish deformity like Pope and with as
venomous a tongue. It might after all be natural that he should
feed his mind on the intellectual vinegar of Pope and Swift, for if
fate condemned him to that kind of contemptible, absurd ugliness,
he was just the man to take it out in devil-may-care-ishness and
bitter attacks on men more fortunate than himself. Your satirists
are mostly men who have failed in life, have had to stand aside and
see others take the prizes, and if you are negligible otherwise, a
caustic tongue may at least make you feared. Poor Byron! No, he
would never quiz him again.</p>

<p>And then Byron had returned to London.</p>

<p>Dallas was alone in his rooms when the door handle turned and
the lad walked in, and in sober truth he had not, for more than a
moment, the slightest conception of who it was that stood before
him.</p>

<p>Byron? Never!</p>

<p>For there confronted him the most beautiful young man he had
ever seen in his life&mdash;and since the world, especially the world of
women, endorsed this opinion, it may be accepted. He sat up in his
chair and stared silently.</p>

<p>The blockish, moon-faced lout was gone. The marble was
sculptured. He beheld the finished achievement. With laughter
lurking in brilliant, deep-lashed eyes of hazel grey, there stood
the young Apollo, pale with a moonlight pallor, exquisite as the
dream of a love-sick nymph upon the slopes of Latinos, haughty,
clear-featured, divine. Impossible rhetoric, but most true. The
beauty of a beautiful young man, illumined by the summer lightning
of genius, may be allowed to transcend that of any woman, for the
type is higher; and no higher, prouder type than that of the
Byronic beauty has ever been presented to the eye of man.</p>

<p>The comedy of the episode (for it was not devoid of comedy on
either side) escaped Dallas at the moment, so thunderstruck was he
with amazement. He sat and stared, confused, uncertain.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he said at last, clumsily enough. "What on earth
have you been doing to yourself?"</p>

<p>"Undoing, rather!" said the Beautiful, reaching for a chair.
"Don't look so foolish, Dallas. If nature makes a man fat-headed
and thick-witted, what can he do but thwart her ladyship? I've
found the Pilgrim's way. Like others, it must be walked with peas
in your shoes, but you get used to that, and&mdash;<i>me voilà!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't thank God, you ought to! I never saw such a
change!" said Dallas, still astare like an owl against the sun. He
could hardly believe his senses even now.</p>

<p>"Thank God&mdash;the tribal Jehovah of Ikey Mo? No, indeed. What have
I to thank him for? I have been my own sculptor, and with a care, a
pains, a suffering, more than it costs to make a man out of one of
Circe's swine. And the devil of it is, I expect I shall have to
live like a monk all my life I Well, I shall take it out in other
ways."</p>

<p>Dallas was reduced to a feeble&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, in all the course of my life, I never did nor could have
supposed&mdash;"</p>

<p>Byron laughed with a new cynicism almost as startling as the
physical change. No doubt it had been always there, but it is
difficult to be appropriately cynical with amiable puffed cheeks
and eyes buried in creases of fat&mdash;indeed, it was a luxury he had
been obliged to deny himself hitherto. It came to the surface now,
however, when he detailed his methods to Dallas, and Dallas accused
him of inordinate vanity. Later he grew more serious.</p>

<p>"Not vanity. At least&mdash;No, not vanity. My brain was as thick as
my body. I couldn't think, write. Sluggish, my dear man, sluggish
from head to foot. Was I to submit to that? Now I can think,
dream&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And make others dream!" Dallas said, a little grimly.</p>

<p>He was right. For the word "beauty" might have been coined for
the man he saw before him, might have lain inert from the fall of
Hellas until that extraordinary resurgence in England. It can
scarcely be exaggerated. I call witnesses. Set down Sir Walter
Scott's "The beauty of Byron is something which makes one dream"
(exactly what Dallas had set forth in grudging terms!), and
Coleridge's "So beautiful a countenance I scarcely ever saw&mdash;his
eyes the open portals of the sun, things of light and for light,"
and Stendhal's "I never in my life saw anything more beautiful and
impressive. Even now, when I think of the expression which a great
painter should give to genius, I have always before me that
magnificent head!" And of men many more. The women await us further
on.</p>

<p>Perfection, Dallas thought. The close-curled auburn hair, the
hazel-grey eyes, clear as water in the gloom of black lashes, the
firm and beautiful curves of the sensuous mouth, the full under-lip
pressed strongly against the bow of the upper, the clean and noble
line of the jaw from ear to chin, chiselled as by the hand of a
mighty sculptor and curving into the perfect cleft of the strong
uplifted chin, Yes, perfection. And to crown all, the strangely
beautiful pallor of the skin, as though lit from within by some
suffused light, illuminating the face by the spirit, starry against
a cloud.</p>

<p>The wand of the enchanter had touched him&mdash;or, rather, he
himself had become the enchanter&mdash;and, heavens!&mdash;how it set forth
his other gifts, little noticed hitherto: the deep, musical voice,
the flying charm of phrase and word, the strong shoulders, the
light grace of the slender figure, the air of disdain and pride.
Human nature is human nature. It was a little comforting to Dallas
to recollect that there were makeweights and drawbacks to all this
starry splendour. It could not be wholly disagreeable to him, as he
sat waiting behind the dribbling rain on the window, to reflect
that Byron must be feeling somewhat small at the moment in that
austerely silent and disapproving assembly, that Newstead Abbey was
still half ruined and that a ponderous, ill-tempered mother with a
developed taste for champagne still represented all Byron knew of
home. After all, a man can't have everything his own way&mdash;and all
this ambition to write verses would probably slough away in a rich,
uncomfortable marriage. He would subside into being like everybody
else, and the literary honours of the family rest with a deserving
kinsman. Such a man as Byron might easily spare them.</p>

<p>His Lordship at last came down the steps with an air of careful
carelessness. A few distinguished and undistinguished-looking men
filtered out behind him and got into waiting chariots and carriages.
He carried his head magnificently high. His broad shoulders looked
broader, his height greater than it really was, as he picked his way
down the wet steps with studied pride and detachment. But no one
noticed him. The men came out thicker and faster now, talking to one
another in little groups. No one bowed, waved or shook hands with him.
He was entirely alone. The footman threw the door open and he got in
beside Dallas, very stiff and cool.</p>

<p>"What happened?" the latter asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"What should happen? The whole thing the dullest farce ever
played. Something to sign, a certain amount of swearing&mdash;which one
may do more cheaply at home&mdash;God knows what! The Lord Chancellor,
Eldon, tried to shake hands with me and mumbled something&mdash;I
believe it was some sort of a clumsy apology for the delay caused
by the legal forms about my grandfather's marriage."</p>

<p>"Well, that at all events was civil, for he certainly couldn't
avoid it!" Dallas interrupted.</p>

<p>"Civil, was it? I scarcely thought so. He mumbled something
about 'These forms are a part of my duty!' I got at him then. I
said, 'Your Lordship did your duty and you did <i>no more</i>.' He
saw what I meant."</p>

<p>"After all, what could he have done? And then?"</p>

<p>"And then I bowed stiffly and brushed his fingers with mine. If
he thought he could win me over for one of his party men, he was
the more mistaken. I shall speak there once or twice to assert my
rights, but I shall have nothing to do with any of their
fanfaronnades. Besides, I'm going abroad."</p>

<p>Dallas was silent, reflecting that Byron would probably have
fanfaronnades enough of his own without troubling the two great
political parties.</p>

<p>Thus they returned to St. James's Street.</p>

<p>Taking leave, Dallas hung on his foot at the door.</p>

<p>"If I were you, Byron, I wouldn't exactly signalize this
occasion by insulting Lord Carlisle publicly. Think twice!"</p>

<p>Byron laughed inwardly and flourished his desk open.</p>

<p>"Well, what possesses the fool to attempt paddling in Helicon
with his gouty feet? He deserves a lesson. Hear the lines, Cato the
Censor. They're a world too good to be lost on you and me. This is
only part of it."</p>

<p>He sat astride a chair, reading with the utmost relish, Dallas
standing unwilling by the door.</p>

<p class="poem">"No more will cheer with renovating smile<br>
The paralytic puling of Carlisle.<br>
For who forgives the senior's ceaseless verse,<br>
Whose hairs grow hoary as his rhymes grow worse?<br>
What heterogeneous honors deck the peer!<br>
Lord, rhymester, <i>petit-maître</i> and pamphleteer!<br>
So dull in youth, so drivelling in his age<br>
His scenes alone had damned our sinking stage.<br>
Yes, doff that covering where morocco shines,<br>
And hang a calf-skin on those recreant lines."</p>

<p>He paused for approval, in a kind of cruel transport of glee.
Dallas, with tightened lips of disapprobation, held the door open
for an exit.</p>

<p>"And you mean to publish that virulent stuff? You, that wrote
only the other day:</p>

<p class="poem">"'On one alone Apollo deigns to smile,<br>
And crowns a new Roscommon in Carlisle'?</p>

<p>"You were ready enough to flatter him then! The lines are
wicked, impossible!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but that was only in manuscript, and I little knew then
what an old curmudgeon the man is."</p>

<p>"That hardly affects his relation with Apollo and the Muses. Are
you going to print it separately, or what? If I thought you meant to
publish that stuff in 'English Bards and Scotch Reviewers,' I can tell
you, Byron, I for one, would have nothing to do with seeing it through
the press, and I feel pretty sure that neither Cawthorn nor any other
publisher who valued his skin would give it to the world. Well, I must
leave you. If you wish to put fire under your own thatch, add those
lines to the satire. It will have a hard struggle without them, God
knows!&mdash;add them, and the game's up."</p>

<p>"Pooh! It was base jealousy made him take no notice of the
verses I sent him a while ago&mdash;or such notice as was a blow in the
face."</p>

<p>"You'll find he'll notice these," Dallas said, and closed the
door, too angry to argue further. He believed he had impressed
Byron at last.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER 2. THE REBEL</h2>

<p class="poem">"The shaft hath just been shot, the arrow
bright<br>
With an Immortal's vengeance; in his eye<br>
And nostril, beautiful disdain and might<br>
And majesty flash their full lightnings by."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Byron.</p>

<p>The poem was published, and "English Bards and Scotch Reviewers"
took its place in literature. But the latter fact was not obvious
at the moment. All that was certain was that a new writer had
appeared, brandishing the red flag of revolt against established
authority&mdash;if not the Jolly Roger itself, the skull and cross bones
of the pirate. There was the fiction of anonymity&mdash;Dallas had
conditioned for that, but dire was his consternation on seeing,
under a second allusion to Lord Carlisle, the following
footnote:</p>

<p>"It may be asked why I have censured the Earl of Carlisle, my
guardian and relative, to whom I dedicated a volume of puerile
poems a few years ago? The guardianship was nominal, at least as
far as I have been able to discover; the relationship I cannot help
and am very sorry for it: but as his Lordship seemed to forget it
on a very essential occasion to me, I shall not burden my memory
with the recollection. I have heard that some persons conceive me
to be under obligations to Lord Carlisle: if so, I shall be most
particularly happy to learn what they are and when conferred, that
they may be duly appreciated and publicly acknowledged."</p>

<p>Reading this, Dallas almost tore his hair. He was furious with
Byron, for whose vagaries he felt himself partly responsible. He
had undertaken to see the poem through the publisher's hands&mdash;yes.
And it was risky enough from the first. But he had never expected
vitriolic additions, slid through the printer's hands at the last
moment, too late for his interposition. He had left Byron, thinking
him convinced, had not seen him since, and now&mdash;gone was anonymity,
gone the last prospect of family peace. Madness! The young fool
would ruin himself. It was the well-trodden Byron Road to Ruin to
fly in the face of all decent people (and can an Earl be less than
decent?) and to flout all authority. But for a young man with that
scandalous Byron family history behind him, and in addition his
grandfather and great-grandfather on his mother's side both
suspected of suicide, his mother, despite her royal descent, a
vulgar, storming virago who had done her best to alienate all
sympathy from her friendless child, this audacity must be fatal.
What hope now of a Golden Dolly, as Byron persisted in styling the
heiress of Dallas's dreams? A title is and remains a title, but
when charged with such an incumbrance as this young lunatic, what
Golden Dolly but must feel her money could be laid out to better
advantage? And, with this alarming addition, which must draw the
peerage into the quarrel, to quiz such emperors of the flail and
fan as the famous reviewers, to challenge almost every literary man
of mark to mortal combat of pen and ink&mdash;perhaps worse&mdash;What could
be done? He sat long in bleak bewilderment, then slowly betook
himself to Lord Carlisle's mansion and requested an interview.</p>

<p>It was granted. Dallas was ushered into the library, solemn with
brooding Roman busts, Etruscan vases and the true literary odour of
calf-skin and elderly pages perused only by the bookworm on its
travels through costly margins.</p>

<p>My Lord, clad in a flowing, rustling dressing-gown of richest
silk which somehow suggested the magistrate, the Conscript Father,
was seated by the fire, cowering from the bitter March gale
outside, and his features, never of the urbanest, were rigid with
indignation. A copy of the detestable volume lay on the table
beside him. He inclined his head to the visitor.</p>

<p>"Excuse my not rising, Mr. Dallas. A touch of gout. Be
seated."</p>

<p>Dallas was seated and in expectation of a question. None
followed. My Lord stared with as fixed an indignation at the fire
as if it had been a party to Byron's guilt. Dallas pulled himself
together.</p>

<p>"I have called, my Lord, to express my sincere regret for this
unpardonable insult to your Lordship, for such I feel it to be. And
yet, to the generous mind, what is unpardonable? If you have waded
through the poem, with its would-be cleverness and youthful
arrogance, I am certain you will feel the author to be more
deserving of pity than anger."</p>

<p>"Certainly. Pity and contempt," interjected his Lordship.</p>

<p>Dallas could not quite swallow the latter epithet, not being by
any means certain that a regrettable brilliancy in the style might
not carry the thing so high as to damn any man's judgment who had
assented to "contempt."</p>

<p>"It is a deplorable performance," he said mildly; "and my object
in coming is to beseech your Lordship to overlook the personal
insult, which I am sure the young man will be the first to regret
later, and still to extend your protection for the sake of the
family."</p>

<p>"Family, Sir? What family?" cried my Lord, facing round so
suddenly upon the suppliant that Dallas almost jumped out of his
chair. "Because I had the misfortune to be allied by my father's
marriage with a Byron, am I to be forever saddled with a young man
who not only is a disgrace in himself, but whose mother is one of
the most atrocious of her sex? I am told that she permitted her
child to be an errand boy to a low quack in Nottingham, fetching
his daily tankards of beer, forsooth! A woman whose paroxysms of
temper made it absolutely impossible to conduct any business with
her, so that I was compelled virtually to retire from the
guardianship years ago! I am told that she has pursued her son from
room to room, brandishing the fire irons like an Alecto&mdash;"</p>

<p>Indignation and want of breath choked the noble Lord for a
moment, giving Dallas time to speculate on Byron's glee at the
unclassical combination of Fury and fire irons, ere Lord Carlisle
swept on.</p>

<p>"And these are the detestable persons I am asked to countenance!
What, you assert that his mother is his misfortune? May I ask if
his early licentiousness is his misfortune? Accredited stories of
the most lamentable relations with women have reached me, and it is
not because I now live retired that I am unaware of such
productions as the poem 'To Mary,' of which I understand even he
himself is now ashamed. And you ask me to condone these outrages on
religion and virtue? No, Sir. His puny attack on my own productions
as an author are beneath contempt, and are of a piece with his
insulting behaviour to the Lord Chancellor when he recently took
his seat. These might pass as the result of a vulgarity occasioned
by early associations, but the other offences&mdash;"</p>

<p>The noble speaker threw speechless hands to heaven at this
climax. Dallas made to rise; evidently there was no more to be
said. Lord Carlisle, however, turned a glassy eye on him.</p>

<p>"If you are determined to continue your association with the
young man, Mr. Dallas, I can only trust that the goodness of your
intention will not obscure your judgment. I am much mistaken if his
company will not be a disadvantage to those who court it. You will
do well, in my opinion, to suggest his retiring abroad. His
peculiar gifts will be more appreciated among foreigners than in a
kingdom where religious and moral institutions are still
revered."</p>

<p>"My Lord, it is his intention to go abroad. He has been
collecting funds for that purpose."</p>

<p>"I hope it is also his intention to remain abroad. Sir, I have
the honour to wish you a very good morning."</p>

<p>An impassive footman responded to the bell, and Dallas was
ushered through an unfeeling marble hall with repellent echoes up a
Jacob's ladder of a staircase, and so out into the equally
unfeeling March wind.</p>

<p>He went straight to Byron.</p>

<p>He found him sitting over his breakfast, also in the
dressing-gown stage of the chrysalis, a little pile of letters
beside him, suspiciously feminine in spider-web handwriting,
neglected for one as unmistakably masculine, on which his eyes were
glued.</p>

<p>"Dallas&mdash;Dallas! God sent you!" he shouted. "What ho, my
croaker, my raven! What think you of this? You know that Cawthorn
insisted on printing an edition of a thousand, and that I said
'Optimist! We shall never sell a thousand. Why print lumber?' Well,
here he writes that the thousand is melting away already and
another edition in sight, the book-sellers are ranking up for their
copies&mdash;and, by George, Sir (George of England, not he of
Cappadocia!), he believes my name is made and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dallas sat down. His face was sufficient interruption to any
transports. Byron's sails flapped in the dead calm. He tried the
mocking tone, but was visibly alarmed.</p>

<p>"What is it? Newstead burned? Child's Bank gone smash? The
Regent, King? Speak up, man!"</p>

<p>"I think, Byron, you should realize that Lord Carlisle is deeply
offended."</p>

<p>An awful pause. Byron shouted with glee.</p>

<p>"Good God, and is that all? And if he hadn't been, the world
might well have written me down an ass that dipped his pen in
asses' milk instead of the gall I meant. You don't mean to tell me
he has written to complain? Show me the letter. It will be meat and
drink to me."</p>

<p>"He has more sense of his own dignity. No. I felt it my duty to
see him and request that he would consider this escapade as the
ebullition of youth and high spirits only."</p>

<p>Thunder and lightning in a moment on brow and eyes, the
glittering sunshine hidden in sinister gloom.</p>

<p>"You dared? You call yourself my friend, and dared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall dare more than that before I've done," Dallas said
composedly. "Are you aware&mdash;but you must have been&mdash;that when you
wrote that infamous line about 'paralytic puling,' you insulted a
personal ailment? His Lordship has suffered from a slight stroke of
paralysis. I can only think you are bent on alienating every humane
mind. Criticism may be legitimate, but upon my soul&mdash;"</p>

<p>He halted. Byron was staring at him all aghast, with the
terrified eyes of a boy.</p>

<p>"My God!" he said under his breath at last. "I never knew
it&mdash;never a word. And I&mdash;<i>I</i> to taunt any man with a personal
disgrace! I am scarcely the man for that."</p>

<p>Something caught in his throat. He looked down at his lame foot,
and there was a painful silence. Presently:</p>

<p>"He must have thought me a devil. Sometimes I think I am one.
But, oh, Dallas, my ill-luck, my cursed, damned, blasted ill-luck!
Here was a bit of triumph fresh from the hands of the gods.
Cawthorn writes that Gifford&mdash;<i>Gifford</i>&mdash;saw 'English Bards'
in manuscript and liked it. My Magnus Apollo, Gifford! My spiritual
father in the holy bonds of satire! And you'll see that London will
be talking of me in a few days&mdash;and here's the bitter drop I never
miss. I thought I was to escape it this time, but, no, never! Every
living soul will think I did it on purpose."</p>

<p>He hung his head: with one of his quick transitions, the world
was a desert with a shrill wind blowing desolation through it.
Dallas unbent a little.</p>

<p>"Vitriol has an unpleasant way of recoiling in the face of the
thrower," he said sententiously. "And perhaps you will now do
justice to my motive in waiting on Lord Carlisle."</p>

<p>Byron interrupted.</p>

<p>"If you tell me that he expressed any forgiveness, any pity for
a man who had so grossly committed himself, I'll go out and drown
myself. I will, by God!"</p>

<p>"You could scarcely expect&mdash;" Dallas began.</p>

<p>"No. I could scarcely expect&mdash;I never did. That composes me.
Well, I can listen more quietly now. Go on. What happened?"</p>

<p>"His Lordship expressed the deepest resentment, naturally. He
also lamented&mdash;and here, Byron, I have long felt I must be plain
with you myself. Women&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Women!"</p>

<p>All contempt, all mockery in the tone. It needed no comment.</p>

<p>"Well then, surely if you feel in this way about the sex, it is
the easier to end the disreputable ties you have formed. I am no
censor of the average young man's morals, but why brandish these
things in the world's face? Why insult every prejudice? Why take up
with wenches that other men of quality would not touch with a
bargee's pole? Why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The world's a damned hypocrite. It deserves to have the truth
thrust upon it even if it dislikes the smell of its own corruption!
My Lord Carlisle was a rake in his young days&mdash;would be now, if
years and paralysis permitted. Why is the truth to be smothered to
please these Mawworms?"</p>

<p>Dallas persevered.</p>

<p>"You must be aware that all your hopes hang on a brilliant
marriage. What young woman of refined tastes will accept the
leavings of the stews?"</p>

<p>He stopped before the grimace which bitterly distorted the
beautiful lips.</p>

<p>"They do, my friend. They do&mdash;and will. Do you suppose Miss Prue
doesn't know her lover's antecedents? What is it Sheridan calls
it&mdash;'The leaves of the evergreen Tree of Knowledge of the
circulating library' teach her that,&mdash;and more, much more the
deep-sunk instinct in the female breast that teaches her to long
for conquest, not only over the man but over all the other women
who have desired him. No, no. The Golden Dolly will come to my
whistle for all that. They love a rake. They love also to think
they can reform him. Why deprive any pretty lady of her mission?
The worse the man, the greater her glory."</p>

<p>He looked the very incarnation of mocking malice as he spoke.
Dallas sat perplexed.</p>

<p>"No, my good man, I have not much cause to respect the sex so
far. They started their injuries early. My nurse terrified me, my
amiable mamma&mdash;I assure you upon my honour, I have never been so
scurrilously and violently abused by any person as by that woman
who gave me birth. The blackest malevolence! Such is my mother. No,
the sex shall pay dear for the belief in them I might have had and
now never shall. But allow me to correct one mistake. My loves have
by no means been all of the servants' hall. The bright-plumaged
birds of the aviary come as meekly to my call as the sparrows of
the streets. I could a tale unfold!"</p>

<p>He laughed significantly.</p>

<p>Dallas said nothing. Very little indeed could be said profitably
on the subject of Mrs. Byron, except that it might be hoped she
meant better than appeared, which he had said often enough already.
After a minute Byron spoke abruptly.</p>

<p>"If you see any way of my making the <i>amende</i> to Lord
Carlisle without lowering myself too far&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see no way. The thing is published, and in his present frame
of mind I believe any approach might give rise to fresh angers.
Otherwise, I must congratulate you, I suppose, on a literary
success."</p>

<p>"You shall congratulate me to some purpose in a few days. And
then I'm off, out of this foggy, groggy, hypocritical atmosphere to
lands where the sun shines, the skies are blue and women love
without fear or compulsion. I'm half minded to pitch my tent there
for good."</p>

<p>"That was his Lordship's suggestion&mdash;a good riddance of bad
rubbish!" Dallas said seriously.</p>

<p>Byron flamed, furious.</p>

<p>"Said he so, the old Iniquity! Then tell him I shall be back to
plague him before he can digest his present dose! Now, off with
you, Dallas, and sound Cawthorn. Whatever money it makes is yours,
not mine, for I'm damned if I touch a sou for my writing. It's too
dirty a trade for a peer of the realm, though well enough as an
amusement."</p>

<p>Dallas remonstrated, but went. Byron was beyond him. His swift
mind went forward in grasshopper leaps, while Dallas, like panting
Time, toiled after him in vain. He wrung his mental hands, but
prepared to count the shekels, which indeed were very welcome&mdash;his
own work was not exactly a gold mine and if the money was going
begging, a kinsman who had given literary aid had the best right to
it. It might be worth having. It was.</p>

<p>The delight of seeing not only one's acquaintance, but the
renowned, the mighty, soundly castigated, is one of the most widely
spread of human graces, and in a few days London, both literary and
fashionable, was humming with a delicious titillation of
excitement. The onslaught on established reputations was so fast,
so furious, conducted with such a diabolical brilliancy, that there
could be no question of disparaging the author's achievement. His
morals, his taste, one might deplore, with a reservation of
pleasure in such devilish skill in wounding, but every man and
woman with a gust for literature knew very well either that Pope
had reincarnated, or that his scintillations were in a fair way to
being out-sparkled. The Romantics were furious, little guessing
that Romance herself had at last found her Avatar, and there was
not a pedestal in England but trembled in this earthquake shock,
while the majestic figures thus enthroned, themselves showed a
tendency to duck before the flying missiles of mockery. And Gifford
and Jeffery applauded, outdone. What more of delight could earth or
heaven offer?</p>

<p>There could, of course, be no real concealment of the author's
identity, and Byron went down, exultant, to Newstead Abbey to
prepare for the first and most innocent of his pilgrimages. There
were certain things to settle before he could depart. Mrs. Byron
must be left in charge there, and before her arrival there must be
revels of a sort to deck the newly discovered author with the robes
of mystery and dread&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">And raising a ravenous red eye<br>
And blinking a mutinous lid,<br>
He said unto matron and maid, "I<br>
Will shock you!" And did.</p>

<p>But not irreparably. Rumours of the beauty and eccentricity and
brilliant attainments of the new author gilded his coronet with
more than the gold balls of heraldry. They did him no harm. Since
Lords Roscommon, Sheffield, Carlisle and many more had deigned to
handle the grey goose quill, since the Earl of Orford had published
his "Royal and Noble Authors," the Grub Street taint was fading
from Literature, and she was felt to be worthy of noble coquetries.
Scarcely more,&mdash;a mistress, not a wife; an amusement, not a
profession; that must be understood. But it is well to meet the
plebeians on their own ground and show ourselves masters there also
by right divine! Exactly Byron's view. It winged him down to
Newstead in a glitter of joy and vanity.</p>

<p>The monkery, the understudy Paphian girls and all the other
properties of romantic dissipation were got out. A few love lyrics
were transacted. A sentimental epitaph for his dog "Boatswain" was
written while the noble animal was bounding about the park in
rejoicing health (for who could tell what might happen in his
absence, and a Romantic's faithful hound must certainly not pass
without comment). And so the time ran swiftly on.</p>

<p>It is an odd tribute to his thrifty foresight that Boatswain
died before he left, and the epitaph was suitably engraved. The
world knows it, with its inevitable fleer at humanity. Swift and
water. But most people know little of Swift, and it would pass for
pure Byronism.</p>

<p class="poem">"Near this spot<br>
Are deposited the remains of one<br>
Who possessed beauty without vanity,<br>
Strength without insolence,<br>
Courage without ferocity<br>
And all the virtues of Man without his vices.<br>
This praise, which would be unmeaning flattery<br>
If inscribed over human ashes,<br>
Is but a just tribute to the memory of Boatswain, a Dog."</p>

<p>Yet, though this posing was certainly the lad Byron's, Byronic
also was the true devotion which tended the dog to the last and
recorded his passing thus. Pity had its turn also, if it were brief
at best.</p>

<p>"Boatswain is dead. He expired in a state of madness after
suffering much, yet retaining all the gentleness of his nature to
the last, never attempting to do the least injury to anything near
him. I have now lost all, except old Murray."</p>

<p>"Everything by turns and nothing long," was Dallas's comment, as
so often before and later, but more passionately "everything" than
any other man in the world.</p>

<p>He spent a few weeks in London before he started, savouring the
delights of nascent fame, jarred, galled by the holding aloof of
men of his own rank. They distrusted him none the less for "English
Bards." It bore the complexion of crime in England to attack the
long-established, the respectable. Indeed, it was a kind of atheism
and apt to be allied with the real thing. A man who could jeer at
Lord Carlisle and Walter Scott was very unlikely to be reverent in
his approaches to Jehovah. Friendship with such a rebel might
easily imperil one's own standing in society.</p>

<p>Therefore even the boys he had known at Harrow&mdash;boys he had
lorded it over on the historic Hill, shunned or seemed to shun him
now. Lord Delawarr, for instance. He asked him to come and spend an
hour before he left England, perhaps for ever, for who could tell
the chances of travel in wild countries like Spain and Greece and
Albania? And Delawarr&mdash;Delawarr, who had craved his notice at
Harrow, replied with the cold excuse that he was engaged with his
mother and some ladies to go shopping!</p>

<p>Vile, false friend! Out it all burst to Dallas, who naturally
could not miss the opportunity of pointing out the rankling fears
left by the venom of "English Bards and Scotch Reviewers."</p>

<p>"Your tongue, my dear Byron,&mdash;" etc. "You will do well to
consider&mdash;"</p>

<p>So he broke away, with no farewell to his mother and few to
friends&mdash;never to see her in life again. Even Augusta, the
half-sister who had received his confidences about that unhappy
mother, had no personal farewell to boast. But she had no grievance
there, for he had not seen her since early youth, and she, as a
wife and mother, had half forgotten him. He was not in the vein for
memories. The wide world called him with siren voices, dreamed
figures lifted the veil of the dark and laughed with wooing eyes
from bowers of vine, hung with purple clusters and paved with
violets and asphodel. And on England he believed he had already
left his mark indelible. His erratic steps would be watched,
commented on. People cared now what he did and where he went. They
should care still more!</p>

<p>"I am like Adam, the first convict sentenced to transportation;
but I have no Eve and have eaten no apple but what was sour as a
crab. And thus ends my first chapter."</p>

<p>So he sailed to the unknown and to his first romance of the
great world&mdash;for Eve waited a-tiptoe across the sea&mdash;an Eve more
subtle and alluring than any he had yet touched lips with. He had
begun the quest of the Married Woman, while "English Bards and
Scotch Reviewers" was left behind him to perplex and dazzle the
British public.</p>

<p>Dallas experienced a feeling of comparative calm and security
when that boat pulled out to sea. No wonder! Byron had certainly
left a trail of brimstone in his wake.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER 3. CHILDE HAROLD</h2>

<p class="poem">"Faster, faster, O Circe, Goddess,<br>
Let the wild thronging train,<br>
The bright procession<br>
Of eddying forms<br>
Sweep through my soul!"<br>
<br>
&mdash;Matthew Arnold.</p>

<p>Portugal, Spain, the Mediterranean, Greece&mdash;and Byron. Magical,
electrical combination! What intoxication might not be looked for
from that heady draught? Nor was sugar wanting, the sweetness of
fugitive love-passages, adoring women of many nations, tempting,
surrendering, invariably confirming a hero's belief in his own
superlative attractions. Not even his verse could exaggerate the
delights of that almost undiscovered Europe. And he gave more than
he received. Many pilgrims have trodden the same road since then,
and none with such a glory to shed upon beauty and delight. His
Lavish-ship gave with both hands and introduced the Muse of
Romantic Travel to England.</p>

<p>He wrote of some of his adventures with impudent gaiety to Mrs.
Byron, and she is to be pictured seated, impossibly corpulent, at
Newstead, reading these letters with an indignation only not
expressed in terms of fire-irons because the culprit was afar.</p>

<p>"I trust you like Newstead and agree with your neighbours, but
you know you <i>are</i> a vixen,&mdash;is not that a dutiful
appellation? Pray take care of my books and leave me a few bottles
of champagne to drink, for I am very thirsty&mdash;but I do not insist
on the last article without you like it. I suppose you have your
house full of silly women, prating scandalous things!"</p>

<p>And again, to the increasingly furious Mrs. Byron, an account of
a charming lady of Seville who offered a share of her heart and
home to the young traveller, who might be supposed in a
difficulty.</p>

<p>"An offer," he writes, "which Virtue induced me to decline."</p>

<p>Inextinguishable laughter from the Spaniards was his reward.
Why, the lady was just on the point of marriage, and "when a woman
marries," he explains to the Lady of Newstead, "she throws off all
restraint. If you make a proposal which in England would produce a
box on the ear from the meekest of virgins, to a Spanish girl, she
thanks you for the honour you extend her and replies 'Wait till I'm
married and I shall be too happy!' This is iterally true."</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, to substantiate this literal truth that she
sent a tress of beautiful hair, three feet in length, to Mrs.
Byron, who instantly committed it to the names, wishing she could
make the same <i>auto da fé</i> of the owner.</p>

<p>But she was able to take the mockeries and luscious descriptions
alike with a pinch of salt. She knew very well that intrigue of
this kind was a part of the Byron pose: he was to be viewed as a
daring, bold libertine, and much was to be hinted, but very much
more to be suspected of this young monarch who had so lately
entered upon the domain of beauty and romance where he was crowned
and accepted king. If his mother had prating women about her, they
should at all events have something to prate of and to spread far
and wide. She knew that intention of his and despised it, but could
not hold her tongue.</p>

<p>Yet in his heart he feared the Eternal Woman as much as he
despised her. Something inexplicable, handed down from savage
ancestors who knew women to be lower creatures and yet in alliance
with dark powers, haunted him. You might use them, trample upon
them, desert them, but&mdash;they held you! They held you! He wrote to
Hobhouse, about this time:</p>

<p>"Never mention a woman to me, or even allude to the existence of
the sex."</p>

<p>And in his Journal&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"The more I see of men, the less I like them. If
I could but say so of women too, all would be well. Why can't
I?"</p>

<p>It was in vain that he wrote:</p>

<p class="letter">"The whole of the present system with regard to
the female sex is a remnant of barbarism, of the chivalry of our
forefathers. They ought to mind home, to be well fed and clothed,
but not to mix in society. Well educated, too, in religion, but to
read neither poetry nor politics. They should indulge in music,
drawing, dancing, also a little gardening and ploughing now and
then."</p>

<p>Disarm the enemy, in short. Yet still they held him. He desired
they should be charming odalisques, slaves, and nothing more. And
all the time he himself was their slave and knew better than most
men that behind the pretty enticements they showed and he coveted,
lay something dark and primitive, bitter as blood and salt as
tears, something that was to sting and poison him all his days.</p>

<p>That was his riddle of the Sphinx, and, just as he might have
solved it, Death stepped in, impassive, and answered it in his own
way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile one could mock. One might write in Seville&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"'Tis pleasant to be schooled in a strange
tongue<br>
By female lips and eyes&mdash;that is, I mean,<br>
When both the teacher and the taught are young,<br>
As was the case at least where I have been."</p>

<p>But if we are not moral ourselves, we can still acquire merit by
exacting morality from others, and it was about this time that Mrs.
Byron informed him of an illegitimate birth on his estate, and he
wrote as follows:</p>

<p class="letter">"I will have no deceivers on my estate, and I
shall not allow my tenants a privilege I do not permit myself&mdash;that
of debauching each other's daughters. God knows I have been guilty
of many excesses, but as I have laid down a resolution to reform,
and lately kept it, I expect this Lothario to follow my example,
and begin by restoring this girl to society&mdash;or, by the beard of my
father, he shall hear of it!"</p>

<p>Let us be vicariously moral if we can be no more.</p>

<p>The pilgrimage through outer Europe became thus more or less a
sentimental one, excellent food for mockery in home letters and
verses written as time allowed&mdash;verses not estimated highly by the
author, who coveted Pope's crown of satire on the pattern of the
rankling essay still interesting England and provoking brother
bards to rejoinders furious, dignified and inexpressibly diverting
to the gay malice of the offender.</p>

<p>Indeed, he was childishly happy on that marvellous journey&mdash;even
when the fever took him and nearly made an end of him. He could
parody Pope with delight on that occasion:</p>

<p class="poem">On a cold room's cold floor, within a bed<br>
Of iron and three coverlids like lead,<br>
Poor Byron sweats, alas, how changed from him<br>
So plump in feature and so round in limb!<br>
"Odious! In boards, 'twould any bard provoke.<br>
(Were the last words the dying Byron spoke.)<br>
No, let some charming cuts and frontispiece<br>
Adorn my volume and the sale increase.<br>
One would not be unpublished when one's dead,<br>
And, Hobhouse, let my Works be bound in Red."</p>

<p>But he recovered. The fever was to wait a few more years before
it had its will of him.</p>

<p>And now, satiate with conquests, able to boast himself such a
traveller as in England few men's pretensions could rival, England
itself was looming on the horizon to receive its wanderer. Matters
of business recalled him: an offer of sale for Newstead which
roused him to fury&mdash;for what was the peerage without Newstead, its
visible sign and seal of glorious antiquity? A possible offer for
Rochdale, the coal-bearing part of his property&mdash;very welcome, for
one can neither pilgrimage nor make love without money, and in
spite of Mrs. Byron's almost frantic economies, he was deeply
dipped indeed. Still, Newstead should not go. Hobhouse must
understand that.</p>

<p>"I beg you will repeat very seriously for me that, let the
consequence be as it may, ruin to myself and all connected with me
(the Dowager and the old woman inclusive), I will not sell
Newstead. I call Christ, Mahomet, Confucius and Zoroaster to
witness my sincerity and Cam Hobhouse to make it manifest to the
ears and eyes of men."</p>

<p>Yes, but what other road from ruin? How is Newstead itself to be
saved and supported on an empty purse and costly inclinations?
Supposing Rochdale does not sell! And that sale is improbable, such
mad ducks and drakes has the Wicked Old Lord made of it.
Literature? Scarcely, since it is far beneath the dignity of a peer
to accept any payment for goods delivered and sold at a profit.</p>

<p>The Golden Dolly recurs, unpleasing, stout, weighted with money
bags and an iron determination to secure her victim and full value
for herself and their contents. And Byron flinches still, delays.
After all, he has a fine manuscript, "Hints from Horace," in his
portmanteau, and though he can accept no money for it, it will
certainly increase his worth in the marriage and every other
market. Other verses he has written too&mdash;a light, sometimes grave,
sometimes mocking story of his pilgrimage&mdash;but no one will take
them seriously, publishers least of all. They will serve to amuse
friends and no more.</p>

<p>So he turns his face to England, with a variation on the tune of
love with a certain pretty Mrs. Pedley, wife of a doctor, who
finally, in the very madness of passion, seats herself on Byron's
doorstep and refuses to budge. Byron, perplexed with this new
<i>Capriccioso</i>, indites a note to Dr. Pedley to ask what he had
better do with the seated Venus. Passers-by pause and marvel,
Fletcher meditates on my Lord's eccentricities.</p>

<p>Reading the note with grim satisfaction, Dr. Pedley packs up her
clothes and despatches them to Byron, with another note to the
effect that he wishes him joy of the adventure. Joy! And the
forsaken weeping one still rooted on the doorstep, the crowd
enlarging their eyes and comments? The <i>Capriccioso</i> changes
immediately to a <i>Largo</i>, and his Lordship, dreadfully bored,
is beheld consenting to escort Mrs. Pedley to England&mdash;scarcely
seeing her on the way and parting with her on the pier, whence she
vanishes for ever into the shades of night and is no more
visible.</p>

<p>Thus he returns to England, a full-fledged hero, the swimmer of
the Hellespont with no soft Hero-bosom tempting on the other side,
and therefore the more commendable. It must be owned there was a
good deal of unnecessary swagger about that Hellespont business,
which was little but a carefully presented property on the stage in
preparation for Leander's <i>début</i> in London. The Hellespont
has a sonorous sound and is deeply impressive to men and women who
have never seen it nor are likely to; it contradicts also that
unpleasant rumour of deformity which enemies, aided by Mrs. Byron's
indiscretions, were ready to whisper in beautiful ears. He returns
a hero, and swagger and insolence are the peculiar properties of
the Byronic hero; beautiful things indeed in his own eyes, yet with
always a nervous fear behind them that their diamonds may be
suspected to be paste by the uncomfortably keen observer. His
arrogance, it must be remembered, is very much a sense of defiant
inferiority. One must assert oneself, one must be first in all
companies&mdash;if it were but in revenge for that bitter past when his
mother raged at him in a Scotch brogue more reminiscent of the
Glasgow slums than of Holyrood, when he ran errands for a lowborn
quack, when his whole schooling cost but thirty shillings a year,
and dear at that.</p>

<p>These past bitternesses can never be forgotten in estimating the
Byronic pose. There is revenge on fate, on the world, to be
reckoned with. They had pinioned him down to every ignominy: he had
released himself and spat in their faces in spasms of malignity and
hate.</p>

<p>Before his return, however, he was compelled to recapture beauty
also, in preparation for that first appearance in England, for his
travels had brought back a faint indication of the corpulence he
dreaded more than any earthly affliction. And this campaign began
at Athens with three Turkish baths a week and the old diet of rice
and vinegar, and produced its usual ineffable result. The spiritual
pallor returned obedient, the haughty beauty of feature was
decipherable once more.</p>

<p>"How pale I look!" he said, standing half-enamoured before the
looking-glass. "I think I should like to die of a consumption!"</p>

<p>"And pray, why?" asked Lord Sligo, British and
uncomprehending.</p>

<p>"Because then all the women would say, 'See that poor Byron&mdash;how
interesting he looks in dying!'"</p>

<p>Sligo chuckled. He saw the joke, but the Celt in Byron was
nearly impervious to the humour of his own absurdities, though
alive enough to others which Sligo might easily miss.</p>

<p>When the news reached Dallas that Byron was established at
Reddish's Hotel, he lost no time in presenting himself. He was
sincerely pleased at the prospect of seeing him, for surely two
years abroad would have given him a wider and more sensible outlook
on life; and besides, there was always an affection in his
heart&mdash;disapproving, but still an affection&mdash;for the shining,
wayward creature whom he had known so long.</p>

<p>And again, and yet again, the profits of "English Bards and
Scotch Reviewers" had kept his pocket warm, and these allusions to
"Hints from Horace" might mean further payment for literary
services which would be welcome indeed. It was with a pleasant
thrill of excitement running over him, that he was ushered into the
dark parlour at Reddish's.</p>

<p>Byron lay on the sofa, a foaming tankard of soda water beside
him, a sheet of manuscript in his hand. He sat up, stared a moment
bewildered, then got on his feet.</p>

<p>"Dallas! Praise be to all the goddesses of Home-coming (Domiduca
is the only one I remember!), and is it really you? Oh, Dallas, I
have panted for you in the still night, sunburn me if I haven't! I
return with the riches of an Argosy. 'Hints from Horace' will make
your fortune and my reputation! But sit down, man, and tell me how
the world has used you. You look somewhat white about the gills.
How think you the returning Baron shines?"</p>

<p>Dallas could at least be clear upon that point. Byron looked
extraordinarily well. Colour he could never have&mdash;it was not a part
of his scheme&mdash;but his ivory pallor darkened the hazel-grey of his
eyes and heavy lashes and stressed the curls on his forehead,
tossed forward with a Dionysiac luxuriance, the gloss and hue of
chestnut or of dark stems of pines touched with sunlight in
whispering wood-ways. Dallas, half revolting as most men did at
that extraordinary beauty, the Lord of the Unerring Bow incarnate,
was yet compelled to understand how its possession must colour a
man's life and fling him into delights and temptations almost
incomprehensible by the homespun of other men's thoughts and
experiences. And in a sense it affected him unpleasantly&mdash;the
Puritan in him protested. The beauty was not even natural. It was
the work of Byron's own hands. If he let himself go he would be on
the plain level of other men and one could tell better how to deal
with his faults. How could they seem faults with those winning
eyes, that smile? One grew lenient in spite of oneself&mdash;too lenient
by far.</p>

<p>He was tempted to that lenience now, in face of the narrative
pouring from pent-up years: narrative that any respectable
Englishman should have discouraged on the spot. These foreign
women! Heavens, what company for a man of Byron's temperament! He
did his best to listen gravely, to interject the properly serious
disapproval, to point out that excesses of the kind would
inevitably, etc., as he used to do.</p>

<p>"But you are in England again now, and that foreign freedom of
manners is happily not known here&mdash;"</p>

<p>Byron burst into tornadoes of laughter.</p>

<p>"Not known? Oh, Dallas, Dallas! Have you never tasted cakes and
ale? Have you never heard the chimes at midnight? The Englishwoman!
Ice externally&mdash;well, <i>sometimes</i>. But, in any case, when the
ice breaks in a freshet, not Arno, not Po itself, runs so
frantically to the sea of passion."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind!" Dallas said, a little impatiently, wishing
Apollo would keep his Daphnes and Clyties and all their business a
little more to himself. That certainly was un-English, that
shouting aloud of secrets to be murmured only in moon-dappled woods
or to the musical beat of the gondolier's oar, and, being
un-English, severely to be deprecated: men
didn't&mdash;shouldn't&mdash;no!</p>

<p>There is a decency even in vice&mdash;in England.</p>

<p>"Shocked?" Byron asked coolly. "I could tell you much worse if I
chose. And I will, Dallas, if you look so like the presiding deity
of your foggy island, the great god Sham. Of course, you're
tickled. Equally, of course, you disclaim it. Good Lord, what you
lose! The adventures! Ah, Dallas, there's no romance in these cold
climates, and my blood is all meridian. Had you but seen my Maid of
Athens&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do forget her and get on to sense!" Dallas interrupted
irritably. One never could tell on the brink of what revelations
Byron was poised. It was almost compromising even for a man.</p>

<p>But there was no checking him.</p>

<p>"Athens and beauty! You never saw such loveliness. The little
Greek cap and fillet about her brow, with downdropped eyes of a
depth to amaze a man if raised, and a calm sweetness of soft closed
lips. But I taught them to open, and when I had taught her&mdash;then it
was time to go! But oh, Dallas, if I taught her, she taught me. I
have written a lyric about that girl, a lyric&mdash;You shall hear.
Lovers will be singing it when she and I are nothing in the grave.
Listen!"</p>

<p>His voice dropped to a grave cadence.</p>

<p class="poem">"Maid of Athens, ere we part,<br>
Give, O give me back my heart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose she gave what she could not keep!" Dallas interrupted
ironically.</p>

<p>"Beast! Vandal!" Byron ejaculated, resuming:</p>

<p class="poem">Or, since that has left my breast,<br>
Keep it now, and take the rest!<br>
Hear my vow before I go,<br>
(Greek characters).</p>

<p>There's more than you would have patience for, but it ends up
like this&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Maid of Athens, I am gone:<br>
Think of me, Sweet, when alone.<br>
Though I fly to Istambol,<br>
Athens holds my heart and soul:<br>
Can I cease to love thee? No!<br>
(Greek characters).</p>

<p>You can guess the rest, the wild eyes like the roe, tresses
unconfined, wooed by each Aegean wind, and so forth. It made a
great impression.</p>

<p>"There's money in that," Dallas said critically. "A slim volume
of love lyrics to Maids of Athens, and other such heathen cattle,
might take. I don't remember its being done. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Do I, forsooth! Doesn't the romance of it touch you, you old
Jew?</p>

<p class="poem">"'Though I fly to Istambol&mdash;'</p>

<p>"the lovely name! Istambol for the lover and the unending
delight of new scenes and new lips to kiss and longing bosoms and
soft eyes waiting him, and for the deserted Ariadne on the beach of
Naxos tears unending and bitter memories and a thirst of yearning
nothing can assuage. Isn't it romantic? Can't you see that?"</p>

<p>"It's damned unfeeling. I can see that."</p>

<p>"Cruel, perhaps. But life is cruel&mdash;damned cruel, too, my
friend&mdash;and gives nothing to repay you, whereas I&mdash;Teresa Macri
will be remembered when her sweet face is a skull and the worms
crawling in and out of her empty eye-sockets. Those verses are
good, I tell you&mdash;fresh as dew and the Greek refrain&mdash;'My life, I
love you,' something quite new. And then there was my little
Turk-Gulnare&mdash;Gulnare&mdash;</p>

<p>"I love that Oriental submissiveness," he added, and his voice
dropped on a note of memory.</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked the unwilling one, dragged on in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>"Never you mind. Not for you to hear. These women really touch
the heart. Englishwomen only stir the passions and not always that.
I wrote some pretty verses to a Mrs. Spencer Smith, a fair enemy of
Bonaparte's, quite a romantic tale. But she never really tempted
me, though she was as pretty as the verses. You can feel the chill
in them; they should be read in a fur coat. Still, I owe the lady
one invaluable lesson. She first taught me that if married beauty
is fenced and dragon-guarded, the dragon has been known to sleep
and bright eyes to look over the fence with an invitation. That
lesson, at all events I've laid to heart for future reference. Can
I ever settle down in the fog after that bath in real sunshine? You
shall judge when you've heard all my experiences."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" said Dallas hastily. "I've heard enough to
reconstruct the rest. Let's get to sense now. I trant to tell you
about 'English Bards.'"</p>

<p>Byron shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;to business. I've been sweating rhyme&mdash;much better rhyme
than 'English Bards.' Cawthorn will&mdash;but listen."</p>

<p>He caught up a manuscript from the table and began reading in
the curious chant he affected.</p>

<p>Dallas sprang to attention. This was business, real life in
place of those fantastic amours with women named as unpronounceably
as their passions were disgraceful. His eye brightened. Then dulled
slowly, definitely. Horace, no! 'Bards and Reviewers' with the salt
diluted, the bludgeon for the rapier, Billingsgate for wit! He saw
with prophetic eye forty challenges springing up from the coarse
assaults, libel actions, general&mdash;not disapproval, that would
delight Byron as it had done before&mdash;but ridicule of the vain
attempt to overtake and repeat his own powers. His face lengthened
as the author chanted, lost in the bliss of critical and no doubt
approving companionship. But the silence at last reached him. He
laid down the paper and looked at Dallas.</p>

<p>"You like it? You taste the allusions?"</p>

<p>Dallas fumbled his watch-chain.</p>

<p>"Truth or flattery&mdash;which?"</p>

<p>"Truth, you fool. What should I do with flattery? This is
business."</p>

<p>"Then I don't like it."</p>

<p>Silence. Doubtless a tornado brewing, the calm before the
cyclone.</p>

<p>"You don't like it? And why?" In high offence.</p>

<p>"Because it repeats your first success and is far below it.
Because it attacks men and things you should not attack, and
clumsily."</p>

<p>Clumsily! Byron's hand clenched, his lips compressed.</p>

<p>"You've rotted like the fat weed on Lethe's wharf since I left
England, Dallas. You don't know a good thing when you hear it. You
used."</p>

<p>"I know a bad one. No, this won't do. That allusion to the Maid
of Orleans&mdash;that's the kind of thing I mean. It will stir every
generous heart. After all, the English can respect a brave
enemy."</p>

<p>"Well, she was a fanatical French strumpet, no more."</p>

<p>"Much more,&mdash;and even if you were right,&mdash;for a poet to attack
the most poetical figure in history, and with vulgarity into the
bargain! No, you can carry this to the publishers yourself,
Barbarian!"</p>

<p>Furious silence,&mdash;Byron biting his nails like Giant Despair,
after his manner when vexed to the very bowels. Dallas, feeling
himself the conqueror, resumed:</p>

<p>"And this is all you have to show for two years and more! Your
rivals in England have not been standing still, let me tell you.
You're outdistanced&mdash;hopelessly."</p>

<p>With the face and action of a sullen boy, Byron fished beneath
the sofa cushion and pulled out some sheets.</p>

<p>"I did this, but if you condemn verse which I know to be good,
what will you say to this nursery stuff&mdash;pap, caudle. And after the
generous vintage of 'Bards and Reviewers!' Lord&mdash;I'll burn it!"</p>

<p>Dallas composed himself to hear in a deeply depressed frame of
mind. The shekels were vanishing, their tinkle a receding fairy
echo. The dull thunder of the traffic outside was a background for
the beat of the verse.</p>

<p>He heard the first unmoved. A pilgrimage, a young man of birth,
dissipation and many follies, who flees his country&mdash;well, that
<i>might</i> have interest for the public. And then the beautiful
voice slipped out of the artificial chanting into a deep music of
song with the violin quality of poignant defiance, grief, triumph,
in the great roll of the verse.</p>

<p class="poem">"Adieu, adieu! My native shore<br>
Fades o'er the waters blue.<br>
The night winds sigh, the breakers roar,<br>
And shrieks the wild sea-mew.<br>
Yon sun that sets upon the sea<br>
We follow in his flight:<br>
Farewell awhile to him and thee&mdash;<br>
My native land&mdash;good-night!"</p>

<p>Dallas thrilled. That had all the ballad wizardry of Scott, and
a story behind it which Scott could never have attempted: modern,
throbbing, wicked, fascinating. But he was silent, biding his time.
Not a word would he risk, not an interruption. Byron read on,
chilling under what he believed to be silent disapproval, and at
last flung the manuscript down and glared at Dallas.</p>

<p>"I told you! I said you would think it pap. Now, say your
worst."</p>

<p>The critic collected his thoughts. He spoke with a weight of
responsibility on him.</p>

<p>"You have written one of the most delightful poems I ever read.
Story also. I have been entirely fascinated. Give me the rest to
read. Breathe not a word to any one. I pledge my life on its making
your reputation."</p>

<p>Byron laughed, resounding laughter. Not a word did he believe,
not a word more would he hear. He flung the sheets at Dallas.</p>

<p>"Take it, read it, burn it as you please. I give it you to burn
or publish or both. Horace&mdash;Horace is what I stand or fall by. You
demented ass! You double-distilled old woman! To take the paste and
leave the diamond! Get thee behind me, Satan, for thou savourest of
the things of this world, not of the spirit."</p>

<p>He would talk of it no more. After some desultory speech
concerning his prospects in London society and the still more
depressing prospects of selling Rochdale, Dallas took himself off,
his prize (and the world's) under his arm&mdash;"Childe Harold's
Pilgrimage." He literally trembled as he walked. Supposing a
hackney coach should annihilate him and his Argosy. Supposing Byron
in his obstinate madness should revoke his words and flatly decline
publication. Horrors unspeakable crowded upon him before he got
safely to his rooms and sat down to read.</p>

<p>One may abridge the description of his delight, with a tinge of
envy for the first to read it, the Columbus of that land of
captivating romance. There had never been anything like it in the
world before. It could not cloy, for the Byronic salt and sparkle,
the swooping, pouncing audacity of the man who snapped his fingers
in the face of the decorous public and beckoned to the old Adam in
each of them, pervaded every page.</p>

<p>Lord, what an achievement! Of course he would publish it and it
should have every chance. None of your obscure publishers like
Cawthorn. John Murray, second of the glorious dynasty, the dawning
publisher of the fashionable world&mdash;he, he was the man!</p>

<p>Dallas wasted no more time on Byron. He betook himself to
Murray, and found his opinion wholly confirmed. With trembling lips
Dallas suggested "a very liberal agreement" and Murray, keen-eyed,
asked but a few days' consideration of terms.</p>

<p>The poem was a dazzling novelty. The matter must be carried
through as quickly, quietly as possible. Such was Dallas's
stipulation, for he lived in fear of some contradictory folly on
Byron's part which would land him in disappointment. Those days of
Murray's consideration were anxious indeed to him.</p>

<p>Heaven knows what might have happened but that Fate and an
upholsterer intervened. For while Byron still lingered at
Reddish's, taking a fortnight to attend to business and not,
perhaps, overeager for the inevitable meeting with his mother,
alarming intelligence reached him.</p>

<p>She had suffered from one of her many ailments and unfortunately
a firm of upholsterers chose that moment for sending in a bill of a
length and proportion which roused her to one of her furies. The
violent rage brought on an attack of apoplexy and before Byron
could reach Newstead she was dead.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER 4. WOMEN</h2>

<p class="poem">"O where are you going with your lovelocks
flowing,<br>
On the west wing blowing along this valley track?"<br>
"The doumward path is easy, come with me an it please ye,<br>
We shall escape the uphill by never turning back."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Christina Rossetti.</p>

<p>So it was over&mdash;the long antagonism, the cruelties that had
warped his life. She had left her mark behind her, stamped in
shrinking, defiant flesh and blood&mdash;but she was gone. All comes to
an end.</p>

<p>The blow was so sudden, that for a moment&mdash;only a moment&mdash;it
stunned him, less with grief than a kind of wild surprise that such
things could be. Curiously, she had believed when he had left
England that they might never meet again. She had said to her
waiting-woman, "If I should be dead before Lord Byron comes down,
what a strange thing it would be!"</p>

<p>It was a strange thing, and the strangeness left him disordered
and broken in a world of confused thought which might well pass for
grief with himself and others. He rebelled against it inwardly&mdash;one
did not grieve, why should one? She had been harsh, cruel, an
obstacle and hindrance from the beginning of his being&mdash;and
yet&mdash;yet somehow one must care despite all will and reason. The
lurking under-self, which no man can control, winced and was
bruised. He suffered in every fibre, not indeed from love for the
dead woman who had borne him in her bosom, but in touching the
problems of life, of death and their unspeakable correlations and
dreadful possibilities. A ghastly loneliness fell upon him like
eclipse, when Death sat down with him by his fireside, and he
shuddered in vain in the freezing presence&mdash;for himself, not for
her loss.</p>

<p>He would not follow her coffin to the grave&mdash;that would be too
terrible. He stood by the Abbey door and watched the slow blackness
wind away under the trees&mdash;the procession which goes and returns no
more&mdash;then turning, shouted loudly to his servant Rushton to fetch
the gloves: animal exercise, anything to stir his blood, stagnant
in the cold pools of death.</p>

<p>In the churchyard they committed the body of "our sister" to the
dust. In the house she had left for ever the strange product of her
body was sparring, shouting with a servant. He endured it as long
as he could, then flung the gloves aside and vanished. The man had
thought his blows more violent than usual, he said, and that was
true enough, for he was sparring against many things beside his
opponent. But he was beaten at the game, as he was to be beaten at
many more. What he did in his solitude none could tell. There were
miserable memories to be confronted, lost hopes and chances wailing
in his ears, and he was the man to feel those to the last and
uttermost.</p>

<p>But all this was well for Dallas. Byron's absence and absorption
certainly smoothed the way for the hope, the certainty, which
Murray and he shared between them. Murray's reading had produced
the offer of those liberal terms which hung like the golden apples
of the Hesperides before Dallas's bedazzled eyes. All was very
well. And while Byron was making his bitter, misanthropic will at
Newstead (his body to be buried by his dog, without ceremony or
burial service), while all his thoughts were on mortality and the
Angel of the Darker Brink, Fame, Love, Delight were hovering over
him, iris-winged and unseen.</p>

<p>At length, "Childe Harold" in the press beyond recall, he came
slowly, though with returning interest, through Cambridge to
London, to meet the first invitation of the great world&mdash;an
invitation of curiosity more than admiration&mdash;the host, the witty
and fashionable Rogers, poet of "The Pleasures of Memory."</p>

<p>Such a company to meet him! No large, vapid dinners for Rogers,
where true conversation shrieks in vain against a wind of voices:
the guests as carefully chosen as his wines&mdash;the others known
already, Byron to be sampled and his merits considered for future
combination. Thomas Campbell, the singer of robust patriotic
measures (Byron, who had no passion for English patriotic verse,
glancing through his "Mariners of England" and "Battle of the
Baltic" before he started, that he might not be at a disadvantage
in compliment!), Moore and his Anacreontics he knew all too well
already&mdash;it was a great occasion for the young celebrity to be
weighed in such scales.</p>

<p>One may picture his careful mourning toilet, the weight of
melancholy to match it, the unseen but deeply realized decoration
of his peerage and Norman descent, so impressive (one might
suppose) to these men of yesterday, who none the less had cut their
niche in the Temple of Fame. These worldly superiorities must take
the place of accomplishment until Byron had had time to cut his own
beside them. He was determined they should carry their full
weight.</p>

<p>He bowed with cold distinction on entering those delightful
rooms of Rogers', where all was calculated to the perfection of
temperate and genial luxury. That quiet house overlooking the Green
Park was the very meetingplace of intellect, the closed portal of
paradise to many a literary aspirant. And he was within it at
last.</p>

<p>The party of three, none of whom had ever seen Byron before,
awaited him. They gazed in astonishment at the settled melancholy
of his face, the cold silence that possessed him. Beautiful indeed,
but scarcely representing the keen vintage of conversation Rogers
provided as a matter of course at his hospitable board. And this
was the vitriolic author of the famous satire&mdash;this silent young
man, haughty and reserved! Moore blinked to Campbell and essayed a
dying jest.</p>

<p>They sat down to dinner.</p>

<p>"Do you take soup, my Lord?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, no. I never take soup."</p>

<p>Desultory talk. The soup plates disappear.</p>

<p>"May I give you some fish?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, no. I never take fish."</p>

<p>The two others stared. It was becoming oppressive.</p>

<p>"Mutton, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, no. I never touch meat."</p>

<p>Rogers suppressed an interjection.</p>

<p>"A glass of wine?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, no. Wine is a thing I never taste."</p>

<p>The others sat round-eyed. Rogers laid down his carving knife
and fork.</p>

<p>"What <i>will</i> your Lordship take?"</p>

<p>"I take nothing but biscuits and soda water."</p>

<p>Dismay! In that hospitable house there was neither. So Byron
heaped his plate with potatoes, drenched them with vinegar and
dined.</p>

<p>But the effect was made, the story would take wing and he could
now afford to relax into conversation. That, at all events, was
devoid of vinegar, for the guest honestly admired both Rogers and
Moore as poets. The acquaintance was later to ripen into what Byron
accepted as friendship, especially with Moore, who was destined to
be interwoven with his intimacies.</p>

<p>Byron left first, and the three men looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Surely a little mad?" Campbell said, conscious of wholesome
British tastes and prejudices. "An unhappy man in spite of his
advantages. A taste of Prometheus on the rock with the vultures
tearing his liver."</p>

<p>"They won't find it much of a feast if he nourishes it on
potatoes and vinegar!" said Moore.</p>

<p>Something like a smile dawned in Rogers' cold blue eyes.</p>

<p>"A man who delights in distortion and mistakes it for
strength&mdash;but interesting, damned interesting. The women alone will
make his fortune."</p>

<p>That was the summing up.</p>

<p>Byron's arrival in London did not set the Thames afire. The
newspapers duly chronicled his Lordship's return from his
remarkable travels, his baggage consisting, in addition to Mrs.
Pedley, of tortoises and Attic skulls. But Mrs. Pedley had vanished
on arrival, the tortoises excited no interest and skulls were
already a familiar property at Newstead Abbey.</p>

<p>Augusta Leigh, as usual in London without her impedimenta of
husband and children, bleated in Lord Carlisle's hearing something
about her half-brother's return, and was met with a frown so
Olympian, so awful, that she subsided into a silence on the subject
which lasted until she paid an afternoon visit next day to Lady
Melbourne's house and there unburdened herself.</p>

<p>That house was the centre, the Greenwich from which all the
meridians of fashion radiated. To enter it was distinction, to be
intimate, accomplished renown. The sceptre which had been suspended
above the portals of Devonshire House had passed away with the
death of Gainsborough's lovely Duchess, to the Melbourne set-had
indeed passed before her death. She had brushed some of the glitter
off her bright, imperious fame by those kisses spent in buying
votes for Fox in the wild election where beauty, rank and fashion,
maddened with political excitement, flung themselves in the dirt
before plebeian feet. And talk raged round her in other ways, talk
which, however undeserved, struck at her hearth and happiness in
far more poignant manner, she smiling as coldly bright as the moon
over tossing waves. Her son was Fox's&mdash;no, no, the Prince Regent's!
Not that these guesses would have mattered especially in the world
of fashion, but an air of sinister mystery overhung the ducal
household. Why was Lady Elizabeth Foster always there? Why did the
Duchess hold her in close friendship when the Duke-why, indeed?
That story, the motive for a drama, is still one of the unsolved
mysteries of the great English families.</p>

<p>But the bright creature saddened under her burden, the sceptre
slipping from a wearying hand. She had eaten of Dead Sea fruit and
the taste was ash on paling lips. "I am done with it all," she
said.</p>

<p>Many people supposed the sovereignty would pass to her beautiful
sister, Lady Bessborough, but she, too, was bewildered, smirched
with scandal and wearied, wearied with the ironies of life. One had
great possessions, one did as one pleased in all things, and
yet&mdash;it palled. Why should it? Who could understand? Her daughter,
also, engrossed and bewildered her, Caroline Ponsonby, the young
wife of William Lamb, second son of the house of Melbourne. That
was not the marriage Lady Bessborough would have chosen, for
Caroline, if not strictly beautiful, had the more irresistible gift
of charm, the girdle of Venus; was the most pursued girl in London
and might have married whom she would. And William Lamb, very
doubtfully the son of his father, who detested him, though a young
man of fashion and promise, was but a poor match for a girl who
believed all the world was made for beauty and fashion to use as
they would, and intended so to use it.</p>

<p>For financial and other reasons it was found convenient that
Caroline Lamb and her husband should set up housekeeping at
Melbourne House, under the wing of her mother-in-law, Lady
Melbourne. Lady Bessborough could not altogether regret that fact.
A girl with so little ballast, so hotly pursued as Caroline, would
be safer in charge of a careful and observant mother-in-law. And
Caroline could not complain. Lady Melbourne was one of the most
popular women in London and Melbourne House a scene of perpetual
gaiety from morning to night. She slipped into its society without
a jar.</p>

<p>Safety. That was always the consideration which mingled with her
mother's thoughts of Caroline. During her own illnesses the girl
had been brought up at Devonshire House, in the glittering circle
of her lovely sister. What had she learnt? That nothing is worth
consideration but the world where Caprice is the sovereign and
Money the servant, and that if a woman is sufficiently charming,
she is royal by right divine in that fairy kingdom and what she
wills is law. And this precept and example, acting upon a
temperament so lightly balanced that it dipped sometimes almost
below the line of sanity, was Caroline's preparation for life as a
wife and mother. It was as well that Lady Melbourne was a rock of
worldly good sense, if no more. Lady Bessborough herself had been
much otherwise.</p>

<p>When Augusta Leigh, once Augusta Byron, entered the boudoir of
Melbourne House, Lady Caroline and her little King-Charles were
sitting by the open window in a bower of blossoming plants, while
Lady Melbourne wrote invitations in the alcove. Both welcomed her
warmly. It was impossible to dislike Augusta Leigh, and, having
been brought up by her grandmother, Lady Holderness, she had
escaped the Byron stigma and was perfectly acceptable&mdash;a really
delightful woman, not pretty enough to inspire jealousy, not too
highly principled to inspire alarm in the most careless worldling.
There were indeed no prohibitions about Augusta: perfect good
nature, a pagan charm of indolent acquiescence in anything which
pleased anybody and an air of absolute good-breeding, partly
natural, partly acquired by her life amongst the most carelessly
well-bred people of the world. She did not look her twenty-seven
years and had all the softness and bloom of youth with a fair,
country colour in soft cheeks and lips&mdash;one who desired to please
universally and succeeded accordingly.</p>

<p>"Augusta, you dear! (Bijou, stop barking. You know Augusta as
well as you know me!) Come and sit down by me. Lady Melbourne is
busy."</p>

<p>"Never too busy for Mrs. Leigh," Lady Melbourne said, pushing
the notes aside. "And besides, Caroline, I'm perfectly sick of
writing. Why in the world can't you help me instead of incessantly
pulling that dog's ears?"</p>

<p>"Dear Lady Melbourne, he loves to have them pulled, and they're
exactly like velvet. But, Augusta, take off your hat. What's the
news? How is Don Dismallo?"</p>

<p>"If you mean Lord Carlisle, heaven knows he's more dismal than
ever," Augusta said, untying the ribbons of her great shady straw
hat. "I most unluckily let fall yesterday that I had a letter from
Byron, who is <i>de retour</i> from Newstead, and his Lordship went
off like a squib&mdash;a perfect explosion. I must see him when he comes
back, and my husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But why must you see him, <i>cara</i>?" Lady Caroline
interposed with her gay little smile. "He's the most undesirable
relation possible. That awful woman at Newstead&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, awful&mdash;though she did once nurse me kindly enough through
an illness when I was a child. But she's out of the way now, and
Byron and I are brother and sister after all."</p>

<p>"Half," Lady Melbourne threw in.</p>

<p>"Yes, half&mdash;but still&mdash;O I'm not the sort of person to cast him
off because he's unfortunate! And now <i>I'm</i> unfortunate. My
husband is&mdash;well, I think he gets worse every day. Byron has been
unlucky from birth too."</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne laughed.</p>

<p>"What can you expect? All his associations have been so
hopelessly vulgar. That young man has never entered any but
third-rate provincial society at the best. At the worst&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, but what am <i>I</i> to do?" Augusta asked plaintively.
"He writes to me. He has offended Lord Carlisle most frightfully.
What is to become of him? After all, he <i>is</i> my brother. You
forget that, dear Lady Melbourne."</p>

<p>"Can't you suggest a rich wife for him? I'm told there's an
unusually fine crop of young women in the City this year ready to
gild all the broken down coronets." This was Caroline.</p>

<p>"Bless me," cried Augusta, "you little know what you are talking
of, Caroline! He's as proud as Lucifer. A City girl, indeed! Pride!
It's almost a madness with Byron. Unless you behaved yourself
submissively he would no more look at you than fly! He must be
pleased before he takes the least notice of a woman. And then
there's family and manners and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Impudence!" Lady Caroline tossed her charming head. "Silly!
Don't let's talk of him any more. I detest underbred young men.
Come and look at Stowe's miniature of me, Augusta. It has just
come. Do you like it?"</p>

<p>Augusta took the pretty toy, rimmed with small pearls, and
studied it, looking from the picture to the original.</p>

<p>In that original the figure was slender as a boy's in spite of
her motherhood, the boyish illusion carried still further by short,
silky curls clustering about the little head, poised on an
abnormally long and slender throat, graceful as the stem of a
harebell tinkling its dumb music in the breeze. The features were
delicately beautiful, whimsically fine and fair, contradictory from
brow to chin&mdash;the nose, tip-tilted, the baby mouth contrasted with
passionately large eyes, darkling, sparkling, fitfully bright,
mismatched with baby blond hair touched with feathery gleams of
gold&mdash;the expression impossible to catch or describe, changing
every moment like a spring landscape of cloud and sunshine. This
the artist could not fix, and Augusta's criticism was just when she
complained that the likeness was good as far as features went,
but&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, not a bit like you as you really are. It's a butterfly
stuck on a pin. You're the butterfly hovering on a rose."</p>

<p>"Well, William will never trouble about that!" said his wife. "I
meant it for somebody&mdash;ah! somebody who shall be nameless&mdash;can you
guess?&mdash;but now it shall be William's birthday gift. He neither
knows nor cares how I look&mdash;couldn't tell you the colour of my hair
if you asked him. The typical Englishman, his wife a part of the
furniture, no more."</p>

<p>"You give him very little reason to care!" said William's
mother, sighing.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should give him more if he cared more. But he never
did. He should have married you, Augusta. You're all mild
good-temper and yielding, yielding to a fault. You'd do anything
anybody wanted, even anything wicked, simply to make them happy,
whereas I&mdash;let me read you the list of nicknames I've earned from
my friends, and then you'll know me better even than you do
now."</p>

<p>She pulled an album to her, bound in rose velvet and clasped
with gold and mother-of-pearl, and read aloud.</p>

<p>"Savage&mdash;that's because I can bite, and do. Ariel&mdash;because I can
vanish discreetly and indiscreetly. Squirrel&mdash;because I'm light and
quick. Her Lavish-ship&mdash;because I don't care much for anything and
so I toss things aside to other people, hearts included. Spite&mdash;ah,
you know, Augusta, that that isn't true! Fairy Queen&mdash;oh, that's
only because I have small hands and feet." She thrust out an elfin
slipper, embroidered in gold, and looked at it dispassionately.
"After all, what's a foot? My brain is smaller than my feet, and
that's a <i>real</i> pity. Whims&mdash;yes, that's awfully, frightfully
true! Do you remember how the bishop at my wedding drove me mad
with his snuffles, and I tore my dress to ribbons and fainted and
had to be hoisted into the carriage, with William looking as black
as the ace of spades? Oh, Augusta&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Caroline, I do wish you could learn to talk less about
yourself! Your talk is as irritating as a sparrow's chirp. I, I, I,
all the time. It isn't even good manners, and what can be duller?
You can't expect your egotism to be interesting."</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne had raised her fine, imposing head from her
writing to deliver the rebuke.</p>

<p>"Still, it does interest people!" Caroline said with a
<i>moue</i>. "You like to hear, don't you, Augusta? How pretty you
look to-day in that straw hat with roses! Generally you dress so
badly&mdash;the most horrid injustice to your looks. Dress is looks. If
you dressed me like a seamstress, I believe I should be the ugliest
woman in London, and as for you&mdash;why <i>will</i> you be such a
dowdy-goody? Your nose is lovely&mdash;yes, really&mdash;and your hair like
dark brown silk&mdash;no, don't blush! I never said you were a regular
beauty, but you have the most charming points&mdash;hasn't she, Lady
Melbourne? Hayter said the other day that until he studied you for
his sketch he never knew what a pretty woman you were. I was told
that. Your mother was as pretty as a picture, they say."</p>

<p>"Caroline!" Lady Melbourne's tone was severe.</p>

<p>Augusta's mother, the charming divorcee, was not the most
congenial subject in either family. Caroline pouted and pulled her
dog's ears. Augusta picked up the commended hat and proceeded to
tie it on. Of course she knew she was pretty. Did Caroline think
one had given the world up at twenty-seven? One might be married to
a bad husband, but there was never a morning she did not study her
fine little features in the glass and loosen her brown-black locks
to admire them. Silly!</p>

<p>She made one last attempt for Byron.</p>

<p>"If you would have him here," she said, rather wistfully to Lady
Melbourne, "it really would give him a chance of a decent marriage.
He has always known such <i>queer</i> people! Now couldn't you,
Lady Melbourne?"</p>

<p>"For you, my dear, I certainly would do all I could; but Byron
has offended people so dreadfully with that horrid poem, attacking
Lord Carlisle and all the celebrities&mdash;you must own it was in very
ill taste. Well, I'll think about it. There are difficulties as he
has made so many enemies."</p>

<p>Augusta sighed. That could not be denied. Lord Carlisle's
appalling frowns and silence rose before her mind. And yet it would
be very comfortable if Byron could marry well and settle down and
be respectable. She got up and kissed Caroline and curtseyed to
Lady Melbourne and went downstairs with the feeling that there was
really very little in common between herself and these
fashionables. Why, then, did she go? She could not tell. Caroline
would forget her the moment she was out of the house, and as to
their friendship profiting Byron&mdash;they would never give him a
thought either. She could see that in Lady Melbourne's tightened
lips. She supposed he must go down to Newstead and follow the Byron
road to ruin: drink, women&mdash;the property dipping deeper and deeper
every year. After all, what could she do? Her own troubles were
quite enough for her to cope with. Such a husband! Debt and
bailiffs and God knows what, for ever and ever, amen! The world and
society were her only remaining comforts.</p>

<p>She was scarcely down the stair when a girl walked quietly into
the room, a book in her hand; a girl, wellmade, with a serenely
serious face, the very opposite of Caroline's freakish charm, a
girl a little reserved, repelled by the society in which she found
herself at Melbourne House&mdash;let us say, a niece slightly astonished
at her aunt, Lady Melbourne's, laxity on certain points, her
management of those very modish gatherings, for instance. One saw
people there whom&mdash;well, her own mother would scarcely approve of
them. And Caroline&mdash;really, Caroline exceeded all bounds more often
than not. Her calm, well-opened eyes were possibly a little on the
defensive side.</p>

<p>"Do you know, aunt, I have had a letter from mamma, and she
wants me at home again. She is having a large dinner party in two
days and came up a day sooner in consequence. I am so disappointed
to go, but of course I must help her."</p>

<p>"Of course," Lady Melbourne agreed with alacrity. "Then must you
go to-day, Anne? Present my love to Lady Milbanke, and say how
charmed I shall be to visit her when I have a spare moment. Can my
maid or Caroline's help yours?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, aunt. Yes, I am sorry to go. Caro, who was that
who went out now?"</p>

<p>"Augusta Leigh, Byron who was. That odious vulgar brother of
hers is coming back and Lord Carlisle is furious. She wanted Lady
Melbourne to ask him here, but why should we? For my part, I
couldn't struggle through his 'English Bards.' It was just would-be
clever, calling names and as spiteful as a hive of bees
overturned."</p>

<p>"I thought it very clever," Anne Isabella Milbanke said quietly.
"Not that I like satire altogether, from one point of view, because
its whole success lies in wounding. But if the aim is to wound, I
think it could scarcely be better done. He <i>blistered</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, tastes differ," Lady Caroline yawned.</p>

<p>Neither Byron nor his works had the faintest interest for her,
and Anne less, if possible. She thought her a dull, pedantic girl.
To write verses and possess a taste for mathematics&mdash;mathematics,
good heavens!&mdash;and to read anything but the latest, frothiest
novel&mdash;how could any woman of the world be expected to countenance
such absurdities? Of course, she pitied Anne (when she happened to
remember her), because one might as well have a hunched back as be
burdened with such tastes; but surely a sensible girl might hide
her misfortune. Yet Anne went her own way serenely, reading what
she pleased, writing her verses, unmoved by her aunt's evident
disapprobation. One could only say that even an heiress and one to
be a peeress in her own right one of these days, was very much
mistaken in supposing those advantages could make her popular in
society while she had such depressingly tedious accomplishments.
Not even beauty could carry them off, and Anne was no beauty. How
could people be so silly?</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne partly agreed with Caroline. With all her worldly
advantages it would be difficult to marry a girl suitably who had
such unusual tastes. She could not at the moment recall one young
man of position who was likely to be attracted, and the
responsibility was more or less upon her own shoulders, for Lady
Milbanke was nothing of a match-maker, and, of course, Anne must
marry, and well. But she was pretty, certainly pretty. She
inventoried the girl's good points rapidly: a slight, graceful
figure, perfect for her height, the fairest skin imaginable, a
reserved piquancy as though she could laugh and be gay if she
would, clear blue eyes and curling brown hair to set off her little
clear-cut features. If only she could learn to talk nonsense and
look less grave and defensive, she might do very well indeed.</p>

<p>But at present Lady Melbourne herself did not find her niece
attractive&mdash;yet it was difficult to say why, for it must be owned
she never criticized, went her own way in maiden meditation, fancy
free, had no love affairs of her own and never either envied or
intrigued in other people's, after the manner of women in the mode.
Could it be because she was describable in negatives, not in
affirmatives? One knew what she was not, but there was a fund of
reserve behind which it was difficult to discern not only what she
might be but what she was at the moment. Those calm, intelligent
eyes surveying the rabble rout of the drawing-rooms were so
evidently observant as to give an uncomfortable sensation of
devastating conclusions if the discreetly closed lips ever opened
to anything but the obvious. She might occasionally let fall a word
on a book, a play, a song, but from the rocks of personalities her
barque was safely steered. No human being could put on record
against her an opinion against any other. Lady Melbourne was
inclined to predict a fall later&mdash;wisdom so early set is apt to
drop before it ripens.</p>

<p>"For my part, I'm glad she is going," said Caroline, teasing her
spaniel, the door scarce shut behind her cousin. "Miss Prue is as
dull as a twice-read novel."</p>

<p>"Dull?" Lady Melbourne meditated. "I am not sure that's the
right word, Caroline. Reserved, strong&mdash;no, I can't hit the phrase.
Not dull, I think. She impresses me always as being remarkably
self-dependent."</p>

<p>"Well, what is duller than reserve, I ask you? What is there to
be reserved about? For my part, all the world may be in my
confidence, for all I care."</p>

<p>It was, and has been ever since. Little did she then guess how
fully and freely, or even Caroline Lamb might have shuddered.</p>

<p>Cobwebs of the drawing-rooms, women's idle talk, irresponsible
chatter, yet weaving a web of tragedy, dark with terrors and
shames, about the three of them. Could Augusta, Caroline, Anne have
foreseen the strange and terrible intermingling of their fates,
Caroline's bright lips might have blanched and Augusta halted in
horror and Anne trembled, and all the wealth of leaf and blossom in
the beautiful rooms have withered and dropped in bitter winter.</p>

<p>But Rogers, most famous of bachelor hosts, was ushered in, and
Lady Caroline set herself to the charming task of fascinating a man
whose praise was of some consequence even to her wild and delicate
irresponsibility. One must aim at brilliance as well as beauty to
be perfectly in the mode now-a-days, and Rogers was a master of
fashionable repartee. One learnt in his school and therefore it was
worth while to caress him&mdash;unless the wind of caprice happened to
blow from another quarter! But he understood that and his
place.</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne left the room. Caroline, far from a desirable
daughter-in-law, really bored her more than Anne Milbanke. Had she
been compelled to choose between the two for William, she probably
would have preferred the latter, and she found it increasingly
difficult to understand or pardon his forbearance with Caroline's
whims.</p>

<p>Augusta, meanwhile, in a pet of disappointment with the
inconvenience of life in general, wended her way back to Lord
Carlisle's mansion. Not that she cared much what happened to Byron;
she had scarcely seen him since childhood. But with her
half-brothers and sisters on the mother's side so flourishing&mdash;the
Duke of Leeds, Lady Chichester, and all their honours&mdash;the Byron
half-brother was distressing. She herself had been a maid of honour
to Queen Charlotte. If he were to make a scandal it might be bad
for her in that position. Nothing came right for the Byrons! Pity
he was not staying abroad altogether. But thank God that that
appalling mother of his at least was out of the way!</p>

<p>A fortnight later a note was handed to her. It informed "Dearest
Augusta" briefly that Byron was at Reddish's Hotel, St. James's
Street, and wished to see her. She went, dull and disappointed.</p>

<p>The shock, the surprise! He met her as with a brilliant flame of
excitement, a flame at which chilly hands might be warmed and slow
blood made to canter. He was changed, changed: not handsome&mdash;that
may be said of many men, but he was different from them
all&mdash;beautiful, most beautiful, with that electric quality of
beauty which shocks the most reluctant into enthusiasm; all life
and sparkle and eager, nervous energy. She almost blinked at his
swift brilliance as he caught and kissed her and pushed her into a
chair, and sat holding her hand and pouring forth adventures
discreet and indiscreet, as egoistic as Caroline Lamb, but on what
a different plane! One could but listen and marvel. At first she
did not even try to thrust a word in. What could she possibly find
to interest him to whom all the wide world was open, the adored of
women, the pursued of men&mdash;for what man could be cold to this
tossing, glittering fountain of youth and delight? True, they were
not wholly waters of sweetness&mdash;the bitter drop was to be tasted
even in his laughter. But still, the kinship in her gave her
comprehension, and to her he was a creature sphered and
crystalline, in spite of all the wayward masking hiding the
innocent, brighteyed mirth she remembered in the boy. He felt it,
and the contact drew forth instant response.</p>

<p>"The rest, the delight of being with my own sister, my dearest
Augusta!" he cried at last, clasping her hands more fondly. "Oh,
how I wearied for you in all the beauty that surrounded me! You are
like a gentle twilight, veiling all the ruder outlines into a
harmony they never really own. Touch me with dewy fingers, Augusta;
soothe me with your soft eyes. When with you I feel the glare of
day diminish, a peaceful influence is wafted from a moon hidden in
vapour."</p>

<p>She drew the hands sedately away. The rhapsody was a little
exaggerated. He could not&mdash;no one could&mdash;think of her in that
romantic way, she, a lady of quality. He understood her very
little.</p>

<p>"Yes, but, Byron, I feel for you. I fear for you. We must talk
for a moment of family matters. Your mother's conduct at Newstead
while You were away was talked of all round the family, and even
though she's gone, Lord Carlisle's anger is still furious. And then
I have lately been at Melbourne House, begging they would be civil
to you, but Caro Lamb is absolutely selfish and her head a perfect
shuttlecock to which every whim is the battledore. Lady Melbourne
is equally selfish after a harder fashion. In fact, I can see no
outlet at all for you in London."</p>

<p>Instantly the fountain boiled up like a geyser in eruption,
flinging forth stones and mud of malediction, all its brightness
gone. He raged and raved. What did he want of them? Why had she
demeaned herself to visit Melbourne House on his behalf? And much
more.</p>

<p>"Because, my dear Byron, you must marry," Augusta mildly
persisted. "What with your mother and all the other drawbacks, I
have long seen it was the only hope. And if that is so, Melbourne
House is the best prospect&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she was interrupted, shattered. He had brought a poem with
him, "Hints from Horace," which would make his fame, and Melbourne
House might go to the bottomless pit; and as to marriage, God
defend him, God for ever defend him from such a ridiculous
situation! But here Augusta interrupted in her turn.</p>

<p>"As regards poetry," she said calmly, "beautiful as your verses
are, Byron (and nobody admires them more than I), they are not
money and marriage may be. Surely you will grow weary of
love-making. You began with Mary Chaworth. You went on with&mdash;"</p>

<p>She began reckoning on her fingers, but Byron caught the pretty
hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>"You goose, you darling goose! What do you know of love-making,
you that haven't an ounce of deceit or guile in you from head to
heels! No, no, leave all that spiderwork to the Melbourne set and
spin no cobwebs of matchmaking to catch poor devils in, but be your
own sweet self, and I'll tell you all my crimes and you shall
absolve me with a kiss."</p>

<p>And so on for the hour they spent together. He fenced and
sparkled and mocked, and she could not get near him for the
glitter. He did not intend that she should.</p>

<p>They talked the childish nonsense which always appealed to them
both and laughed until she wiped the tears from her eyes. He put
forth all his gifts of wit and humour to please her, and succeeded
to the utmost. Her spirits danced like spray on a wave and she
entirely forgot to pour forth her troubles and bemoan them as she
had intended. No, it was much too amusing to be spoilt like that.
To meet almost as strangers and yet with those innocent, absurd
memories of childhood to share and laugh at
together&mdash;delicious!</p>

<p>She did get in one word about her deplorable husband.</p>

<p>"Never marry a first cousin, Byron. He's the most useless,
selfish, profligate fool in the world, and if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps we all run to that a little," Byron said with sudden
gravity. "But why did you marry him, Goose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, I don't know! One does. He was goodlooking and good
mannered. Of course, if one could foresee&mdash;but I never foresee! To
be happy in the minute, never to look forward&mdash;'Take no thought for
the morrow,' the Bible says that. So Lady Holderness taught
me."</p>

<p>"You Epicurean, you pagan! That was the gospel of dead Greece
and Rome. Are you a Dryad, Augusta, hiding in laurel leaves, or a
cold Nereid, white in deep, green water?"</p>

<p>"Not cold, certainly. They all say I have a good heart. Let us
forget my horrible husband, Byron. You'll take care of me and the
babies now you're back, won't you?"</p>

<p>When Augusta departed from that interview she felt perfectly
certain that so far from influencing Byron for his good, it would
be he who would dominate her&mdash;indeed tyrannize. She felt like a
leaf swept away on the rush of a swirling, tossing stream to some
wild land of freedom she had never dreamed of. It was exhilarating
beyond measure. Her eyes were brighter, she felt years younger than
her twenty-seven as he led her to the carriage, commenting on her
good looks&mdash;but it was also alarming. Could one wish him like the
dull, blunted world about him? And yet&mdash;</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER 5. TRIUMPH</h2>

<p class="poem">"Good reason have I for my love,"<br>
She said, "For he is fair above<br>
All men, and stronger of his hands.<br>
And drops of honey are his words,<br>
And glorious as Asian birds."<br>
<br>
&mdash;W. B. Yeats.</p>

<p>A few days later the advance sheets of "Childe Harold" were, by
special arrangement, in Rogers's hands. Byron's verdict upon him,
given to Murray, had been "Fastidious elegance. He can make or mar
what he wills." And Murray acted accordingly. Rogers was certainly
dazzled as he read. The mockery, the dalliance and the wit, the
descriptions, the personality of the hero&mdash;Byron himself, no doubt,
but in the very apotheosis of fascinating devilry&mdash;all these swept
him off his well-planted and neatly booted feet. He was eager as he
had seldom been. To patronize it would confer distinction on
himself: the sort of distinction he most eagerly coveted.</p>

<p>The book must have a chance&mdash;not only that, but the best, the
most favourable start in London. The women, they would be
intoxicated with the romance of the thing! Caroline Lamb&mdash;of
course, of course! The wild, bewitching elf in her would respond to
every thrill of the Childe. He would swear her to secrecy to ensure
her spreading the news, and lend her the sheets. What better start
in the world!</p>

<p>Finger on lip, caution on knotted brow, he put the prize in her
hand, and my Lady, wild with excitement, exhilarated with rhythmic
beauty that went to her pretty head like the most sparkling,
foaming champagne, flew about the town, breathless, the new poet,
the new poem, bursting from her charming lips in every house she
entered. Never was such an advance agent! There was not a fine
lady, not a man of fashion but prepared to buy, to read, to vaunt
acquaintance with what my Lady Caroline praised.</p>

<p>"But I must see him! I'm dying to see him!" she cried to Rogers.
"And to think Augusta Leigh begged me to take him up and I glowered
and wouldn't! Oh, Rogers, plan a meeting before the book is out! I
won't bear the suspense."</p>

<p>"He's lame and I think he bites his nails," Rogers assured the
quivering beauty.</p>

<p>Suspense and surprise would help the immense, the dazzling
reality in store, he reflected.</p>

<p>"If he were as ugly as the devil, I must know him!" cried the
Queen of Whims, and sent her own enthusiasm palpitating through all
the drawing rooms.</p>

<p>Why say more? "Childe Harold" was published, and in all the
stormy and varied annals of literature where is a like success
recorded?</p>

<p>"I awoke one morning and found myself famous," said Byron,
tasting the delight at first with tremulous doubt, then with lips
that drank and drank the light sparkling foam and could not be
satisfied.</p>

<p>It was more than delight, it was passion. What could he do with
the glittering bird Success, at last perched on his hand, come to
his call? There was money (Murray had paid six hundred pounds for
the poem), but that was nothing, less than nothing; he tossed it
carelessly to Dallas, Dallas who had guessed the singing bird in
the egg and deserved it all. This, then, was what life meant! It
had been dark and sad, but only as a cloudy dawn presages a perfect
day. This had been in store for him always. He had conquered, the
sun had risen and now would mount in splendour to the zenith for
its long day of delight and setting of golden pomps in the far
distant west.</p>

<p>Triumph, and men and women at his feet. Winged on the wind of
it, he made his speech in the House of Lords, and there, too,
triumphed. How could anything fail in this radiant world of
worshippers? Men spoke of the young orator, their envy kissed the
feet of the poet, and miserable croakers like Lord Carlisle and the
few vanished rivals&mdash;who heeded them? Who gave them a thought?</p>

<p>Holland House courted him. Melbourne House&mdash;ah, there one might
think some faint, awful whispering from the wings of Fate, beating
up from the abyss, might have reached him through all the
acclamations! But, no. He was to meet Lady Caroline, he was to
thank her for her enthusiasm. She was only one among thousands now,
yet must be noticed as a daughter of the most socially powerful
house in London. So he said to Augusta, when they met again,
laughing with triumph:</p>

<p>"You begged them to notice me and they held back. Now I'm damned
if I don't drag her Ladyship to my feet!"</p>

<p>"Byron, Byron, be careful!" Augusta cried, paling. Melbourne
House was a mighty stronghold for capture, but something more than
that sent a thrill of fear through her, some vague, dark
premonition. "Caroline is not like other women," she said, and
again, "Be careful."</p>

<p>He kissed the hand he held. That was growing to be a habit of
their intercourse.</p>

<p>"There is no difference between women when it comes to love&mdash;and
me," he said magnificently. "Don't be afraid. I know them to the
bone. She is only a woman."</p>

<p>His influence over her was growing daily. She had his own
recklessness, and more, for she could shut herself into the day
without one forward-looking thought, as he could not. To him the
future loomed terrible enough sometimes, she dared it with light
laughter and a child's ignorant jest. They suited one another
exactly. He could not look, think, speak, but her sympathy was
following him obedient as a spaniel. And in his fame she exulted.
She had not herself the Byron debt to be exacted from the creditor
world, the debt of long contempt and derision, but she felt every
item of it for him. And now Fame, tossing her garlands of roses and
laurel in uplifted arms, danced to meet him and fling herself at
his feet. He had awakened, as it seemed, from a nightmare into the
glow and rapture of a glorious dawn, the reality of life at last,
no dream of the dead or living such as had often haunted him, but
truth. "Childe Harold" had conquered.</p>

<p>The triumph meant everything. All doors were open to him, the
temples of literature, the palaces of the great families, the
commonwealth of the world, and he who had been welcome in none was
now the sought and entreated of each. His rank, the fame of his
extraordinary personal beauty, winged the poetic triumph&mdash;Apollo
incarnate at last.</p>

<p>It is said that the steps of the house where he lived were
crowded with footmen carrying notes of invitation. He laughed a
little cynically from behind the curtains. They had been empty
enough before. The highest fashion struggled now with the most
distinguished ability. Beau Brummell requested the honour of my
Lord Byron's company to dinner at Watier's, and Mr. Gifford, his
"father in the holy bonds of satire," proposed a meeting of chosen
spirits where Rogers, Sir Walter Scott (who happened to be visiting
London) and others desired the distinction of meeting his
Lordship.</p>

<p>But the women! It became a scramble between the great hostesses.
Lady Holland, Lady Jersey, Lady Melbourne&mdash;but why rehearse the
peerage?&mdash;showered notes upon him. Augusta herself came in for a
few rays of the glory.</p>

<p>"Dearest Augusta," said Lady Melbourne, stopping her carriage in
the Park, "I entreat you to secure your brother for the 14th. I
should like a private word with you about our late conversation.
There was a misunderstanding, now wholly removed from my mind, and
it would be really deplorable if such a thing were permitted to
interfere with friendly relations."</p>

<p>Augusta might be good-natured, but she was not blind. She
laughed inwardly as she carried the note of invitation to Byron and
he swore softly.</p>

<p>She still saw him at his rooms, for Lord Carlisle, far from
being mollified by this glare of fame, was but the more enraged. He
had read "Childe Harold" and could not for his life imagine what
any one saw in such lines as those he read angrily aloud&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"The Childe departed from his father's hall;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a vast and venerable pile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So old it seemed only not to fall,<br>
Yet strength was pillared in each massy aisle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Monastic dome, condemned to uses vile!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Superstition once had made her den<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Paphian girls were known to sing and smile;<br>
And monks might deem their time was come again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If ancient tales say true nor wrong those holy men.</p>

<p>"To profane his own ancestors' home, to expose his own
unblushing licence to the public for pay, to flaunt his disregard
for God and man! And in verse which has neither sense nor music!"
She heard the thin, furious voice behind her. "What are we coming
to? The whole poem is a scene of unbridled licence in literature,
subversive of all law and order. For my part, I think the world's
good sense has been utterly overturned by the Revolution in France,
and mere anarchism has since prevailed in every relation of art as
well as life. Your brother, Madam, is a revolutionary himself!"</p>

<p>Lord Carlisle and his antiquated angers! Byron heeded them not
at all. Picking and choosing among his invitations with the skilled
help Augusta could give him, he accepted one from Lady
Westmoreland, whom he had met abroad during the Pilgrimage. He felt
it to be a condescension; she felt it to be the same.</p>

<p>He went with the same pose of melancholy reserve which had
served him at Rogers's dinner-party, a defensive armour to be
unbuckled only when the strange lands had been more thoroughly
surveyed. A free and noble Turk, captured and alien among the
Giaours, was perhaps the clearest image in his mind for that
especial pose. Life is at best a masquerade and some such character
the chosen part for the moment.</p>

<p>As for Lady Westmoreland, she was wearied even before the
evening began by the entreaties which had besieged her since it was
announced that Byron would be present. She gave out to her friends
the fact that rooms were not elastic; to her acquaintances that her
list was already overflowing, with scarcely a polite excuse to save
their faces and stem their tumultuous despair.</p>

<p>And now she stood, tired but triumphant, all azure satin and a
glitter of diamonds, in the midst of an elegantly dressed mob of
men and women a-tiptoe with expectation. And Byron was late. He
made a point of that, half for mischief, half for effect. Let them
wait! He had waited long enough for them. "If I were an Indian
prince or a two-headed negro, they would be as eager!" said he
coolly to Augusta (again in town without her husband or children),
and did not believe his own assertion in the least. Still, they
should wait his pleasure.</p>

<p>A stir, a murmur on the great staircase, a silence spreading up
from the hall beneath and invading the drawing-rooms&mdash;there was a
thrill, a movement as when a singer ascends the platform and looks
about her in silence before the first crystal note drops into the
hush of the waiting audience.</p>

<p>"My Lord Byron!" shouted the gilded lacquey at the door, and my
Lady moved a step forward, the <i>élégantes</i> pressing round her,
the men rather jealously apart, watching with studied
indifference.</p>

<p>A slight young figure in mourning, pale, reserved, haughty,
entered the room, wrapped apparently in his own thoughts and
careless of the crowd as though, wandering through a wood, they had
been trees about him. He drooped his eyelids coolly on his hostess,
accepting her civilities, but no more. How the fire of all eyes
levelled itself upon him, eager, curious, admiring, imploring!
There was scarcely a woman present but would have given her jewels
to see his glance decline upon her with a little interest kindled
in its cool grey depths. Vain hope! He stood at Lady Westmoreland's
shoulder and endured introduction after introduction, unsmiling,
the lips unparted over the beautiful teeth, coldly aloof in his
mourning dress as though alighted from some far planet, frigidly
courteous, no more.</p>

<p>Of course it told&mdash;the effect was exactly what he intended.
Facility would have cheapened; distance awed and delighted.
Introduced, the women would not disperse nor talk among themselves
nor with their men. They remained grouped about him, watching
eagerly while he exchanged a few grave sentences with one or two
specially distinguished&mdash;elder women to whom it was obviously a
duty to be responsive.</p>

<p>Into the room, late also, came Caroline Lamb, light, errant as a
spring cloud blown on the breeze. She wore a white dress with
snowdrops and crystal&mdash;a spring frost in a glittering dawn, the
delicate Ariel, eager, delightful, palpitating with excitement at
the thought of an introduction to the poet wliose reputation her
own little hands had helped to build.</p>

<p>She halted. Good God, how distasteful! That crowd of stupid
women, all staring, bovine-eyed, like frightened cattle at a fair!
To be one of them? What could he think&mdash;how he must despise, detest
them!</p>

<p>Lady Westmoreland beckoned with a flattering smile, way was
made. She glided up.</p>

<p>"May I present Lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>But before the sentence finished, the whim irresistible caught
the Queen of Whims. She looked earnestly at him, turned on her heel
and left the introduction to its fate. No, if she died for it, he
should never have it to say she had bundled up in a crowd for the
honour of a glance unwillingly bestowed!</p>

<p>He met the slight with narrowing eyes, in contemptuous silence.
Lady Westmoreland apologized, laughing, but uncomfortable&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, no one minds what Lady Caroline does. She is not only a law
unto herself, but to every one else. Lady Oxford, will you&mdash;Shall
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>And so it went on incessantly, Byron cold as stone, piqued,
furious at the woman's gesture of contempt. It recalled Augusta's
report of Melbourne House and its rejection of him. How dared she!
She should see&mdash;the world should see&mdash;how little he cared!</p>

<p>He saw her presently in a corner of the great gilded salon,
laughing, talking with a man in a blue ribbon and star, but
watching, watching, he was sure of that&mdash;and suddenly he came to
life. The marble statue woke, colour, light, flowed into the
shining eyes, sparkle, vivacity into his speech. The fountain with
all its music, scattering light and prismatic brilliance, was in
full play.</p>

<p>The women crowded closer about him. They stood four deep to see,
to hear, admire and long. What wonder? "Hyperion, new lighted on a
heaven-kissing hill," was among them. They flattered, wheedled,
worshipped. He laughed aloof, uncaptured. The charm was
complete.</p>

<p>Still she was watching: he could almost hear her absent
rejoinders to the man who tried in vain to possess her ear. Byron
turned his back on her, laughing still, and engrossed himself with
Lady Oxford, the heroine of many a love-episode well known in
London&mdash;a dangerous autumnal beauty, languishing, seductive,
profligate, a sleepy Venus, sidelong-eyed and sweet, with a
stinging wit to give the honey an edge lest it should cloy.</p>

<p>Lady Caroline went home in a pet and found her husband in the
library, buried in papers. He looked up at her with attempted
interest.</p>

<p>"Well, what was the Childe like? Did you capture him, Caro?"</p>

<p>"Mad, bad and dangerous to know," she responded briefly. "I
shall enter that in my journal. Remember I said it, William. I'm
not a bad character reader. Some day I shall write a novel, and
then you'll see. But the women&mdash;disgusting! I refused to have him
introduced to me."</p>

<p>"What, did the fool give himself airs?" William Lamb asked, more
to please his wife than from any real interest.</p>

<p>She came and perched like a bird on the arm of his chair,
flooding him with her white draperies.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;I can't tell. Very courteous, a sort of&mdash;what shall I
say?&mdash;proud indifference. Reserved, cold. On the
whole&mdash;yes&mdash;surprising."</p>

<p>"You must have studied him pretty closely," William Lamb said,
trying to extricate his papers from the falling lace of her
sleeve.</p>

<p>He yawned as he spoke, and, offended, she sprang off the chair
and pushed the papers into a heap of confusion.</p>

<p>"There's for you! Watch him? Not I. I left that to all the
gaping idiots about him. Now, go on with your writing! You never
care. You never understand."</p>

<p>She went out, overturning a little table which caught in her
crystals, and slammed the door behind her. It had happened a
hundred times that William Lamb had offended her. They had nothing
in common, nothing. What did he care for her, she thought angrily.
Certainly nothing for her morals. She, who would not have brooked
an instant's contradiction, rebelled because he never attempted
control.</p>

<p>"I may flirt and go about with what men I please, or live like a
nun in a convent, and he cares not a rap either way&mdash;would not care
whether I lived or died. If I amuse him, he loves me for the
moment; if I am sick or sorry, he is bored. Are all men like
that?"</p>

<p>It might be worth trying to answer that question.</p>

<p>She ran up to her boudoir and scribbled the words in her
journal, "Mad, bad and dangerous to know," then paused and sat
awhile staring at them. Her own face stared back at her from the
long gold mirror before her table, with tossed curls and passionate
dark eyes. He had scarcely looked at her. Had he noticed her at all
or picked her out amongst that rabble of women? He must at least
have seen how proudly she had turned away&mdash;no one else had done
that. They had all fawned and flattered, but she had asserted her
freedom, and had done well.</p>

<p>Freedom? As she looked in the shadowy glass, with the long
vistas of the room in its mysterious deeps, it seemed that she saw
a slight figure in black advancing, with beautiful pale face, the
proud mouth pathetic with a melancholy sweetness softening its
disdain. The eyes were closed, dark lashes shadowing the cheek; the
hands stretched blindly before, as if groping a way to her through
the dark&mdash;nearer, nearer, the lips parting to speak.</p>

<p>She started up in a nervous horror and stretched her own hands
towards his, trembling. And as she did so, the illusion vanished,
the mirror reflected only the wax lights, the table and the empty
room, and a white-faced woman with great, distended eyes staring
fearfully into it.</p>

<p>She flung herself into the chair again and buried her head in
her arms.</p>

<p>"That face is my fate&mdash;my fate!"</p>

<p>The words choked in her throat as she whispered them half aloud,
terrified at the sound of her own voice.</p>

<p>A nervous crisis, the aftermath of hysterical excitement. She
was always subject to uncontrollable nerve storms which threatened
worse, and this was by no means the first of her Irysterical
illusions. William Lamb would have laughed at it, have pulled her
on his knee and tried to jest it away. But he was far off in the
great, echoing house, writing calmly in his own commonplace book at
the moment&mdash;and very commonplace indeed would it have seemed to his
wife&mdash;yet, such as it was, the only companion of his thoughts.</p>

<p>"The general reason against marriage is that two minds, however
congenial they may be, or however submissive the one may be to the
other, can never act like one. By marriage you place yourself on
the defensive instead of the offensive in society."</p>

<p>He paused, then wrote slowly:</p>

<p>"Every man will find his own private affairs more difficult to
control than any public affairs on which he may be engaged."</p>

<p>He closed the book with something like a sigh. Storms of wild
caresses, storms of foolish petulance, absurdities in public and
private&mdash;Yes, his home affairs made parliamentary difficulties tame
indeed. The best he could ever hope was that the world they lived
in would continue its licence to Carolina to be absurd without
stamping her as&mdash;what should one say of a Fairy Queen astray in
Belgravia instead of moonlit forests?&mdash;abandoned. For abandoned
utterly and entirely to her caprices she was and would be. Heaven
send they might not lead her to ruin!</p>

<p>As for Byron, he went home flattered, cloyed with admiration and
incense, but piqued, piqued to the very soul of him. Such Melbourne
House impudence! And to him, him of all men! To turn her back upon
him in the face of all the world! This came of Augusta's going
meddling and whining to Melbourne House&mdash;they thought they could
slight him as they pleased. Caroline Lamb should pay dearly, dearly
for her impertinence. Women! And the fool a man might be by
troubling his head about them! Let them go to the devil! He would
use and abuse them as he pleased, and not a jot more. The Orient
alone had the secret of managing them: seclusion, sensuality, the
bowstring&mdash;in other words, the thick stick which Europe had so
unaccountably discarded.</p>

<p>He met Caroline Lamb next day at Holland House, he very much on
his pedestal as he saw her with a friend. She looked much younger
this time, pale and pensive-eyed and dressed to the part in cloudy
grey like a wistful twilight. Her look implored pardon even before
Lady Holland took possession of him and led him in custody&mdash;for
that was her manner&mdash;to the seated beauty.</p>

<p>"I must present Lord Byron to you."</p>

<p>It was done, and she rose slowly and looked at him. He drew back
a little&mdash;no, no, she should not get off like that! It was not to
be so easy for her!</p>

<p>"That offer was made to you before. May I ask why you rejected
it?" he asked coldly.</p>

<p>Not a word on her fluttering lips. Not one. She looked up, down,
in confusion, and a slow, secret smile showed his teeth. It was
enough, he was satisfied and more. Her look revealed exactly what
he wished to know. His voice softened, into the confidence he
reserved for his friends, his very intimate friends.</p>

<p>"May I beg permission to come and see you? Tomorrow?"</p>

<p>She merely shaped a "yes" with her eyes and turned away, leaving
him unspeakably satisfied. Melbourne House conquered, conquered at
last! Every one that night remarked his gay good-humour&mdash;all but
Caroline Lamb. She had slipped away like a moonbeam.</p>

<p>"That beautiful pale face is my fate."</p>

<p>The words were sounding in her ears night and day as though some
one had spoken them. They frightened her into an ecstasy that was
more pain than joy. She sat in her room repeating them again and
again that night and dreamed them awake and asleep. William was
away, she could have her thoughts to herself and let them loose
until they played strange pranks in the midnight silence. His face
hovered before her, passionless, sweet, with closed eyes. Oh, to
awaken the answer in them, to hear his low voice in the words she
dreamed but dared not whisper even to herself!</p>

<p>She could not tell at what hour he would come next day. She had
been riding in the Park and was sitting hot and flushed, with
Rogers and Moore beside her, when he was announced. Good manners
vanished to the winds&mdash;what, see her like that, an Amazon with
tumbled curls clinging to a moist forehead, her riding gloves
tossed and crumpled? She fled like a lapwing out of one door as he
was ushered in at the other, ashamed of her confusion, but unable
to do otherwise. The men must amuse him meanwhile&mdash;jet what if he
should be angry and go?</p>

<p>In an agony of nervous irritation, with a heart that beat in her
throat and two maids to help her, she flung herself into blue and
white muslin, a falling collar, foams and froths of lace, the
colour in her cheeks as bright with excitement as holly berries in
the hedges, and so flew downstairs after a few minutes which seemed
an hour. She could hear his voice, that deep, gentle note, in
itself a love-charm&mdash;he was there still&mdash;thank God! She would have
died of it if he had gone.</p>

<p>Rogers came forward, laughing a little wickedly.</p>

<p>"Lord Byron, you are a happy man. Realize your good fortune!
Lady Caroline has been sitting here in all her dirt with us&mdash;but
when you were announced she flew to beautify herself."</p>

<p>"But that was foolish," Byron answered, with his strange
under-look from beneath the lashes. "How could she do what nature
has done once and for all? I don't believe you, Mr. Rogers!"</p>

<p>It was a part of Rogers's success in society that his tact was
perfect. He took himself off very soon with the utmost grace and
discretion. Moore lingered. He had always been a favourite with
Lady Caroline, he was sure of Byron's liking&mdash;why should they not
wish for his gay little stories, melodious songs and all the
repertoire of Moore enchantments? He stayed until Byron was frantic
and Lady Caroline on edge. At last Byron rose. A whisper by the
door:</p>

<p>"Could I see you alone if I came at eight o'clock?"</p>

<p>She signed "Yes"&mdash;no more, her eyes glittering dangerously.</p>

<p>He left, still with that inward smile. Melbourne House was at
his feet. Should he or should he not deign to raise it? She was in
the clouds, dreaming awake, dreaming of a lover, passionate,
poetic, delicate in word and deed, noble in birth and thought. She
had found him. For her, for her he had put on flesh and blood and
had come from perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn to tread the
dull London streets and love her through life and death. London
glittered prismatic, a rainbow of smiles and tears.</p>

<p>A few days went by. He came to Melbourne House, captured Lady
Melbourne's good opinion entirely and for the moment disarmed
William Lamb's criticism, apt to be a little destructive of young
men with pale romantic features, deep eyes and poetic pretensions.
He allowed that Byron appeared "reserved, calm and sensible," and
hoped his good sense would not be overturned by silly women and
flattering fools. Caroline bit her lip. What words to describe the
Poet of the Ages, the World's Desire! She had forced the poem into
William's hands and he found her pretty violence delectable and
yawned over the second verse. Hopeless!</p>

<p>She did her best to encourage Byron, to make it clear that the
way was open before him, and her husband all placid indifference,
but still he either refused or failed to understand. He held back,
smiling. But then it must be delicacy, the most tender, reverential
delicacy, though still fatally and cruelly in the way. She could
think of nothing else. How could she wait while his refinement
debated slow and tentative approaches? Should he suffer a pang she
could spare him? No. He would understand and love her motives if
she ventured an approach for his sake. It must be so. Other men's
gross natures might well fail to comprehend if a woman threw
herself at their feet, they might confound it with licence and all
the purchasable freedoms, but Byron&mdash;</p>

<p>She sat with the great poem before her, intoxicating herself
with its romance. Those, those were the women he could understand
and love, and she was one of them. He had been the martyr of
love&mdash;she felt it, she knew it-but now she would be the interpreter
of its bliss and he would repay her with such love as never woman
tasted yet.</p>

<p>In a sort of outburst of delirious courage she snatched her pen
and wrote him a letter, a wild, enthusiastic letter. She could not
doubt he loved her. She was his, her love was his for ever and
ever, all she had was his. Did he need money? All her jewels were
at his disposal. Was he lonely? She could share his every thought.
In life and death she was his, his only. She sent it instantly.</p>

<p>She had a page's dress beside her, the memory of a masquerade of
pretty ladies and Spain and guitars and moonlight casements. She
liked herself in that dress, with the bright curls above the
falling collar. Suppose she delivered the letter with her own
hands? Who would know but he, and he&mdash;how he would love her for the
risk, the sweet folly, the romantic daring! She paused, looked,
longed, hesitated&mdash;and was lost.</p>

<p>That evening as Byron sat alone&mdash;for a wonder!&mdash;the staid
Fletcher opened the door.</p>

<p>"A young man, your Lordship. I believe, a page from Melbourne
House. Will your Lordship see him?"</p>

<p>The door opened again, closed, and she rushed to him, slender,
trembling, throbbing against him, on her knees at his feet.</p>

<p>"Byron, Byron, I couldn't stay away. I love you, you love me,
though you daren't tell me so yet. But don't be afraid, I know
it&mdash;I knew it from the first. Darling, darling! I love you! I love
you so! You knew I did&mdash;tell me! You had my letter?"</p>

<p>She drew his head on her shoulder and wreathed herself about him
in an ecstasy of passion. Not sensuous passion, though he believed
it to be sensuous and took the gift as it came: he thought nothing
else than that she was playing her side of the game charmingly, he
his. It meant no more than that to him. To her it was a rapture
half spiritual, half intellectual, wholly romantic. They were
Tristram and Iseult, lost in fairy woods. She was Juliet, leaning
from the balcony; she, all there ever was of love; he, all there
ever could be of passion and fidelity. Oh, he would understand as
no other man in all the world could do! She never doubted it.</p>

<p>There is no danger so great as that of the woman who loves
spiritually, intellectually. She will go much further and more
madly than the sensuous woman can ever do, for the one can but
surrender her body, the other, heart and soul, this life and the
life beyond. She does not count the risks, for she does not know
them and her love has the fanaticism of religion. An
incomprehensible friendship, passionate, tender, with all the
refinements of love and none of its grossness, that was her soul's
longing&mdash;to hover over the abyss on wings which could never fail,
to become one colour and one splendour with the flame, yet never to
singe those silken wings&mdash;that was her dream.</p>

<p>And Byron, repeating many like occurrences, using the same
words, the same gestures, thinking the same thoughts, responded
with a coinage that might pass for the pure gold of true love&mdash;if
one knew no better. Not otherwise. Yet the moment was sweet, even
to him. She realized his own lines:</p>

<p class="poem">"How beautiful she looked! Her conscious heart<br>
Glowed in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.<br>
O Love, how perfect is thy mystic art,<br>
Strengthening the weak and trampling on the strong!<br>
How self-deceitful is the sagest part<br>
Of mortals whom thy lure has led along!<br>
The precipice she stood on was immense&mdash;<br>
So was her faith in her own innocence."</p>

<p>For, in spite, perhaps because, of her wild aberrations, there
was truly a strange innocence about Caroline Lamb. Byron would
never give her credit for that, but it was there. Her husband
understood her better. It was the secret of his long endurance. He
knew well she was the delicate Ariel toying with the Caliban of
the world, flinging herself recklessly within reach of snatching
paw and trampling hoof. She saw life through some fatal
glamour&mdash;Titania wreathing the clumsy ass's head with flowers of
her own wild imagining while merciless lookers-on mocked and
laughed. They could not mock now, she thought proudly; the mockers
also must adore the young Apollo, the Lord of the Unerring Bow,
beautiful, disdainful, wholly to be worshipped.</p>

<p>When she had left him his most pressing thought was, could he
keep her on the level of good sense which would spare offence to
Lady Melbourne? William Lamb was negligible, but his mother a
power. A wonderful old woman, strange and cynical. The intrigue
would scarcely trouble her provided scandal were avoided&mdash;why
should it? It was the way of her world, with certain restrictions
of common sense, and men and women did these things and no one
cared. But Caroline and common sense! Little as he knew of her yet
he felt the absurdity of that connection of ideas. Well, he would
never wreck himself for her whims! Augusta had warned him; her own
wild self-abandonment was a warning. In short, he would sound Lady
Melbourne and be guided entirely by her indications.</p>

<p>Caroline, dream-haunted, intoxicated with all the perfumes of
moon and stars, staring into the dark, white and quivering with
rapture&mdash;what would such thoughts have meant to her?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER 6. A GREAT LADY</h2>

<p class="poem">"He dwells with Beauty, Beauty that must die,<br>
And Joy whose hand is ever at his lips,<br>
Bidding adieu, and aching Pleasure nigh<br>
Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips"<br>
<br>
&mdash;Keats.</p>

<p>The poem and Byron were a triumph of the personality with which
the world was to credit him. It should never guess the suffering,
irritable creature who was his housecompanion, watchful all day,
wakeful often in the dead, unhappy night, when strange films of
poetic vision, lifting, disclosed the doubts and terrors no longer
to be bluffed and held at arm's length. Only that companion knew
the truth, that his pursuit of pleasure was not as much for any joy
it gave him as for an anodyne in a most tormenting loneliness, that
haunted him even with a fair head on his breast and yielding beauty
clasped in his arms. It stood at his shoulder, waiting the
inevitable moment of satiety and laid a cold hand on his, with a
chilly whisper in his ear:</p>

<p>"The body can protect you thus far and no farther, and when it
falls back exhausted, you are the more mine."</p>

<p>Therefore he filled up every hour. For the nine months following
his introduction to Caroline Lamb, apart from other distractions he
spent every spare moment at Melbourne House, enduring her
infatuation, repaying it with a Sultan's condescension and exerting
himself strenuously to win the liking of that very astute and
observant woman of the great world, old enough to be his
grandmother&mdash;Lady Melbourne. She saw it, and repaid him with such
sterile sincerity as her experience of a very gross and heartless
society had left her. He puzzled and interested her. In all her
memories she could find no man so winning, and so unwon. She found
it difficult to diagnose the symptoms. He could be absorbed in a
passion, yet could never love; could be the first poet of his day,
yet value his peerage much above his poetry. She thought the stir
he made about that a little vulgar&mdash;one had these advantages of
birth as a matter of course, and to insist on them savoured of the
parvenu. She must try to break him of that later on, but
delicately.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what was it that held him? Women were a mere
distraction, priestesses who fed the flame of pleasure, but
mattered no more to his inner life than the darkbrowed ministers of
Astarte to the deity they serve. That was his chief attraction to
them. He kept them on tiptoe, straining after the fruit set above
their highest reach.</p>

<p>She longed to pluck out the heart of his mystery. His essential
aloofness was so plain to her that she might even have found it in
her heart to pity Caroline if she had been a shade less
insufferable in her madness. It all gave Lady Melbourne much food
for thought.</p>

<p>Caroline was foolishly, openly, mad. She was already the talk of
London, and surely it was the very depth of ill fortune to have a
daughter-in-law who could not conduct her intrigues discreetly,
like other people, but must blazon them from pillar to post, as
Lady Melbourne guessed she was doing. Her anxiety reached such a
point at last that she sent for Rogers, who knew everything and
everybody, and charged him to tell her the whole truth as to the
gossip relating to Caroline.</p>

<p>"And I beg you will let no false delicacy stand in the way, for
if I am not much mistaken, there is going to be such a scandal as
will ruin Caroline if she is not headed off in time. She has always
been a fool, though never a mad-woman like this."</p>

<p>Rogers hesitated. The task was an ungrateful one, but he had
felt the pulse of society and knew well that the case was desperate
and demanded some desperate remedy, though what, he could not for
the life of him tell. He temporized. He had seen Byron standing on
the steps of Watier's with Beau Brummell as he came along and he
made some deflecting remark about the latter.</p>

<p>"It is Byron and not Brummell who interests me," Lady Melbourne
said coolly. "Let us discuss Byron, if you please."</p>

<p>"A singular young man," he said, "and far more gifted than he
himself realizes at present."</p>

<p>"Scarcely singular as a young man, my dear Rogers. He is simply
the ordinary young man magnified: sensuous, selfish, vain. If all
young men had his power of attraction they would say what he says,
do exactly what he does. His poetry is an excrescence, for all I
can see, and his genius a thing apart from his daily life. But I
did not drag you here to discuss his talents. I simply wish to hear
the facts which no one will tell me plainly about Caroline. What I
see myself is enough to assure me they must be gross."</p>

<p>Still Rogers hesitated. He was genuinely distressed. But she was
relentless.</p>

<p>"Since you are one of her oldest friends and undoubtedly wish
her well, pray do her the service of enlightening me. It will put
it in my power to be of use in the matter. You must see this. And I
shall have an opportunity to act, as she is now out of London."</p>

<p>He hesitated no longer, knowing well that if worldly wisdom
ruthlessly applied could save the situation, it would be Lady
Melbourne's. There was power in every wrinkle of her face, in every
glint of her hard grey eye. It might or might not be allied with
mercy, but it would scarcely be unjust, even to Caroline.</p>

<p>"It has certainly been discussed," he began, crossing one leg
over the other and settling into greater ease. "It would be
impossible to avoid that when her Ladyship behaves as she is doing.
She seems to have lost even the remnant of discretion since the new
affair&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What affair? Stop there and tell me what you mean," she
commanded. "Is Byron intriguing with any one else?"</p>

<p>"Surely the stories about Lady Oxford have reached your
Ladyship?"</p>

<p>"No. But that explains a great deal," she said slowly. "Pray
tell me all. You will be doing Caroline a real service."</p>

<p>His tongue was unloosed, and with some of the enjoyment
inseparable from the troubles of our friends. No gossip so
inveterate as the club man, and Caroline had set the clubs' tongues
wagging indeed.</p>

<p>"Why, your Ladyship's knowledge is very antiquated! My Lady
Oxford has never been reticent on the subject of her amours, and
Byron spends many days and hours in her delightful company. One may
understand that. I know no one more amusing in her freedom of
speech. But the effect on Lady Caroline has been deplorable. She
haunts him, Madam, haunts him! I give you my word. I declare to you
that I have been horror-struck at her imprudences, and here I speak
from personal knowledge. When not invited to the Oxford and other
parties he attends, she actually waits in the streets to waylay
him, and often enters his carriage and drives back with him. You
may hardly credit what I am about to say, but I saw it with my own
eyes. After the great rout at Devonshire House I saw her waiting in
the street, then talking to Byron in his carriage, with all the
flunkeys looking on, half her body thrust in at the window. You may
conceive the comments. I really believe her to be partially insane
where he is concerned."</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne did not abate her composure by one jot. There was
not a flicker under her grey eyelashes, and she sat massive and
unmoved as ever.</p>

<p>"The world, the only world that concerns us, knows how to
estimate her absurdities. But of course there must be an end to all
this nonsense or she will finish in Bedlam, which I have always
predicted. Have the goodness, my dear Rogers, to give me all the
information in your power about anything which occurs to you. I
should especially like to hear anything which has reached you about
Byron's money affairs."</p>

<p>There he could speak more at his ease. Byron had received four
thousand pounds at his mother's death which had released him from a
few of his more pressing debts, and now that he had made his mark
in literature, he was contemplating the sale of Newstead Abbey,
feeling that his credit in the world no longer rested on the
possession of the estate. He possessed fame apart from the Norman
descent he dwelt on so fondly, forgetting the little hiatus in the
reign of the Eighth Harry, and it was said at the clubs that
Newstead would fetch at least £100,000, and quite possibly more,
which would present him with a respectable income and leave him the
Rochdale estate for the credit of his peerage. It was, of course,
unthinkable that he should accept any payment for his literary
work, but his money position was assured by Newstead.</p>

<p>She listened with the closest attention, but said little, sifted
him a little farther on the facts concerning Lady Oxford and
another lady whom he mentioned, and then thanked him with the
utmost graciousness.</p>

<p>"A friend who can be candid is a friend indeed. I shall know
much better what line to take. But&mdash;will you see my Lord? I believe
he must be in by now."</p>

<p>She touched the bell and, hearing my Lord was in the library,
Rogers went downstairs, soft-footed, and left her to herself. He
was satisfied that his disclosures had done nothing but good. This
was the sort of affair where her cold reasonableness would be
invaluable.</p>

<p>She sat awhile in deep consideration, then wrote a line to
Byron, asking him to spend an hour with her two days hence. She
knew well that invitation would flatter him quite as much as an
assignation with any Lady Oxford of them all.</p>

<p>She had chosen her time purposely. Caroline had been carted off,
all unwilling and struggling to the last, to pay a visit to her
mother, Lady Bessborough, in Ireland&mdash;that mother's ill health the
only reason in the world which would have induced her to leave
London for a moment. The ground, therefore, was clear for
discussion.</p>

<p>When Byron received his summons from the great lady he had not
the faintest notion of what was in the wind. She had never
intervened nor showed herself interested in <i>l'affaire
Caroline</i>. And this had not surprised him. He had been
accustomed to the prim reserves of the little provincial
drawing-rooms he knew best, and had no knowledge as yet of what the
devastating candour of ladies of the highest fashion might be,
especially one with Lady Melbourne's personal and general
experiences behind her. Caroline, indeed, was a child of nature and
alarmingly so in her speech, so also was Lady Oxford, but
then&mdash;women in love! He smiled a little at his memories. Old women
might or might not see what was going on, but they turned their
heads respectably in another direction, leaving a man free to
follow his fancy.</p>

<p>But he liked Lady Melbourne. He respected her keen grey eyes and
the air of power which radiated from her imposing presence in her
drawing-room. A talk with her was a pleasant prospect. She knew her
world to the finger tips and with her he was always on his most
attractively wicked behaviour. She could relish it, he knew, very
well.</p>

<p>He was shown into the boudoir where Caroline's scarlet and
yellow macaw hung upside down, screaming passionately at all and
sundry. Lady Melbourne touched the bell and exiled it and resumed
the composed dignity which might have been so alarming but for the
seasoning of racy common sense. She came straight to the point in
her own fashion&mdash;not a word wasted, no room for tact. A navvy could
be no blunter.</p>

<p>"I want to have a talk with you, Byron, about your affair with
Caroline. Things can't go on in this ridiculous way."</p>

<p>He looked at her in blank amazement. Was this the beginning of
the exile from Melbourne House which he had always dreaded. That
fool, Caroline! He had warned her again and again, and now&mdash;But he
fenced.</p>

<p>"Affair with Lady Caroline? Your Ladyship knows very well there
is nothing but friendship between us."</p>

<p>"My Ladyship knows a great deal more than you imagine, and as I
propose to have no open scandal in the family, I wish to be plain
with you. I am very well aware that she threw herself at your head
from the first. She never yet had a whim but she pursued it like a
lunatic, and you are no exception. If you have a grain of sense you
will tell me exactly how things stand, that I may help you out of
the muddle, which I assure you you will find a burden. You had much
better have confided in me from the beginning. Of the two, I prefer
you to Caroline, but better than either do I like peace and quiet
and decency of the sort the world expects. And I mean to secure
it."</p>

<p>It was an amazing prologue to an amazing conversation, but the
stark candour of her words caught Byron and held him fascinated. As
he said later to Hobhouse: "If she had been a few years younger
than her sixty-two, what a fool that woman would have made of me if
she had thought it worth her while! And then I should have lost a
valued friend. She had real power, of a kind."</p>

<p>"But how could I venture to confide in your Ladyship?" he said
seriously. "The relationship&mdash;I did think of confidence, but how
could I?"</p>

<p>"The relationship had nothing to do with the matter. People get
into these foolish entanglements and for every one's sake they must
be advised how to get out of them. I will do my best for you now if
you will be candid."</p>

<p>A pause. "Do you love her?" she added and looked him straight in
the eyes. Truth begets truth; he returned the look as frankly.</p>

<p>"No. But it isn't that I love another; it is that loving is out
of my way."</p>

<p>"Except yourself."</p>

<p>"That's human. I don't pretend to extra-humanity. But, as a
matter of fact, I don't love women. From early habit one makes love
mechanically as one swims instinctively when one is thrown into the
water, but&mdash;Well, I'm tired of being a fool about them. I have my
own preoccupation and it is not this; far from it&mdash;and yet&mdash;I see
no way of extricating myself if Caroline is determined against it.
That's the truth."</p>

<p>"But you definitely wish the liaison to end?"</p>

<p>The terrible old inquisitor! She sat there, asking unheard-of
questions as coolly as if they concerned the housemaid's amours
with the groom, and yet he could not resent it. He could only
answer:</p>

<p>"Definitely. Yes, I wish that."</p>

<p>"You care nothing for her? I need hardly say I ask out of no
idle curiosity. But things cannot go on in this lunatic way. I
understand she follows you about everywhere with scarcely an
attempt at concealment. It is her first serious love-affair for all
her follies and the poor foolish woman takes it as wildly as a
school-girl. She will know better one day."</p>

<p>There was really no severity in her tone. She stated the fact as
she might have stated the hour. He found it easier and easier to
reply.</p>

<p>"I will be quite candid. At the commencement she piqued my
vanity&mdash;all men are vain&mdash;by telling me she was certain I was not
really the kind of man to inspire a passion for my own
sake&mdash;etc.&mdash;I need not go into that. But it did pique me. I
resolved to sit still and see how far she would go without my
raising a finger, and in a week I was convinced&mdash;not that she loved
me, for I have no belief in love in a woman who gives herself so
cheaply, nor indeed in love in any intrigue, but that there was no
length to which she would not go to make me believe that she did
love me."</p>

<p>"I see," Lady Melbourne answered, and fell into meditation.
Presently:</p>

<p>"I scarcely blame you. It would have been difficult for you to
play the stoic."</p>

<p>"Difficult? Impossible! If only I could be honourably off now!
You would soon see how sincerely I mean what I say."</p>

<p>Again she meditated.</p>

<p>"What is this about Lady Oxford? Does it mean the end of your
affair with Caroline?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. You know Lady Oxford. She makes no
stipulations. An excellent good comrade. But Caroline is frantic
with suspicion."</p>

<p>He looked at her a little apprehensively. She constrained
candour, but the inquisition alarmed him. He was not sure how much
latitude was permitted by society to men of rank and birth, and
Lady Melbourne was society incarnate. Had he exceeded? She would
know to a hair and judge him accordingly.</p>

<p>"I am going to ask you a question which you will think very
singular. You have the reputation of being a man of pleasure
outside the cases we are discussing. Do you ever carry any feeling
of love into these affairs? Would they clash with any prospect of
marriage?"</p>

<p>"Good God, no! How shall I explain myself? I don't even know if
my views are peculiar. Here they are, however, for what they are
worth. Naturally a man takes pleasure of that kind as it
comes&mdash;need I tell a woman of your wisdom that we are more
generally the pursued than the pursuers? My experience is that
women&mdash;But, no&mdash;that chapter is not for ears polite. As to love, I
am utterly incapable of imagining love for a woman in any aspect
that can be presented to my mind. Passion, yes, inevitably. When
youth and beauty touch lips what else can be expected? But it wears
off exactly as do the fumes of wine, and there is nothing drearier
than the reaction from either intoxication. Passion has no more to
do with love&mdash;if love exists&mdash;than the North Pole with the
South."</p>

<p>"I comprehend. But marriage? Does your view of life include
marriage?" her Ladyship suggested quietly.</p>

<p>He was eager in assent.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I used not to think so, but I now feel that all men
who can should marry. One might respect a wife; with other women it
is impossible. But esteem. I could esteem a good woman, beautiful,
yet not so beautiful as to attract others. Intelligent enough to be
able to appreciate her husband, but not to shine herself. Refined
in thought and manner, chaste as ice, dignified, a worthy mother of
children a man might value. In fact, I think this is the only solid
happiness a man can anticipate in any relation with women."</p>

<p>"Does the scheme include fidelity to this paragon?"</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne asked, with a latent smile. She thought him
absurdly, almost lovably, young in his dogmatism on a subject to
which experience had taught her there is neither guide nor answer.
Byron caught the smile and smiled also. For the moment she taught
him to see his own comedy as clearly as other people's, and he
shared her enjoyment.</p>

<p>"I should <i>hope</i> for that consummation," he said modestly,
"and if, like all human hopes, it fell a little short of
fulfilment, I think no woman of the world would condemn me
utterly."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. The protesting shriek of
Caroline's macaw could be heard in some room at hand. He could not
at all fathom her motive in the interview and occupied himself in
wondering what would come next. At last she raised her head.</p>

<p>"I promised you candour, Byron, and you shall have it. Caroline,
I value not at all. William, I do. I spoke to him on this subject
before I spoke to you, and his only reply was that such things if
left alone wear themselves out. He said, were he to interfere,
especially where such a mad-woman as Caroline was concerned, that
inevitable and hideous scandal would result. I am quite unable to
make him comprehend that it can only be avoided now by a miracle.
To her I have not even attempted an appeal. I might as well reason
with her macaw. But in you I have some hope because I realized
long ago that you were weary of her absurdities. Shall we then make
a treaty? Will you break off the liaison as wisely as you can, but
at once? And shall I suggest a wife of exactly the kind you name,
but with advantages of birth and expectations for which you did not
condition? Take a moment to think. No, rather take twenty-four
hours, and then let me know your decision. In any case this
conversation must be a mutual secret."</p>

<p>He sprang at the proposal, immensely flattered. Twenty-four
hours? An instant was all he needed. A release? Yes, he thought
that might be managed, though no doubt Caroline would throw every
difficulty in the way. But he could swear to do his utmost. As to
marriage, certainly, if the right woman could be found, and there
was no one whose judgment he would be prepared to trust so blindly
in such a matter as Lady Melbourne's. Had she any special person in
her mind? His eyes sparkled with interest and curiosity. She shook
her head.</p>

<p>"If I had I should deny it, so there is no good in pressing that
question. But, if we now understand one another thoroughly, I am
ready to carry out my part of the bargain if you will yours. I
suggest your breaking the matter to Caroline by letter while she is
in Ireland, and of course it is plain that the letter should be of
a sort to convince her that no plea she can make will have any
weight whatever. It must be decisive. There are necessary cruelties
which benefit the victim in the long run. Not that I suggest, you
understand. I can take no responsibility in a matter entirely
between you and Caroline. But it should be done at once."</p>

<p>To this he readily engaged himself. They talked for some time
longer, viewing the matter from every possible angle, and he found
himself, to his surprise, opening his mind to her with the same
unreserve as if she had been a man of his own standing. It seemed
impossible either to shock or distress her, and to the calm good
sense of the man of the world she added the intuitive perception of
the woman. Never before had fate sent him such a counsellor, and he
could have sat there for hours, discussing his own feelings and
adventures, and those of others as freely. She smiled in silence&mdash;a
sphinx in lace cap and diamonds, and entirely his match&mdash;and
more.</p>

<p>Mentioning Caroline's agonies at the prospect of Lady Oxford, he
said:</p>

<p>"To me it appears the height of unreason. I entirely fail to
understand why a woman, herself unfaithful to her husband, thinks
herself entitled to expect any fidelity from her lover. Can you
explain that mystery?"</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne put the question gently aside. Her purpose was
achieved and she really had no interest in academic
discussions.</p>

<p>"Women have their prejudices. But I think if you are writing to
Caroline that Lady Oxford might be used to give a touch of finality
to the matter. And now, to my regret, I must dismiss you for I
expect my milliner. I appreciate the good sense you have shown in
your frankness with me, and my help shall not be wanting in the
marriage question. I shall always be ready to advise you, and I
feel sure that is a step Augusta would warmly approve. Indeed, she
once mentioned it here."</p>

<p>Byron was silent on that point. He rose with the grace acquired
in the last year and kissed the veined and wrinkled old hand
sparkling with great diamonds and rubies. He liked their owner as
much as it was in him to like any woman, save one.</p>

<p>She looked into his eyes with her own, bright and hard as the
macaw's.</p>

<p>"Better confide wholly in me, Byron. I know the London rocks and
shoals and you don't."</p>

<p>"The greatest honour!" he protested. "If I only dared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but no half measures. A wise man tells his doctor all or
nothing. Shall it be all?"</p>

<p>"All, and thankfully. If you promise not to be shocked. Even you
can't guess." He broke off, laughing.</p>

<p>"Shocked?" Her expression was enough.</p>

<p>"Then I promise, with the utmost gratitude. How can I thank you
and why are you so gracious to me?"</p>

<p>"Because in the course of my long life you are the only man I
failed to understand at a glance. I can no more predict your
future&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you can help it. Give me a wife."</p>

<p>She laughed and they parted on that.</p>

<p>As he went down the stair she sat thinking, a darkness of anger
settling upon her face which she had not permitted him to see, then
pulled the gold standish toward her with its elegant seals and
tinted waxes, a costly toy given her by Caroline. She wrote swiftly
and steadily.</p>

<p class="letter">"My Dear Anne:<br>
<br>
"You are aware that Caroline is in Ireland with her husband, and I
find myself rather solitary. If Lady Milbanke could spare your
company to me for as long a period as would cover Caroline's
absence it would be a gratification for which I should sincerely
thank her. There has been much gaiety here&mdash;a rout at Devonshire
House and many other pleasures more suited to your age than mine.
But one I believe we have shared is delight in the elegant and
romantic new poem, 'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage.' Sought after as he
is in society, I see much of the author, who is as romantic in
appearance as his poem. It may interest your mother to hear that
blonde is more worn than ever and that Lady Jersey's new dresses
are the talk of the town. Hoping for a favourable reply from her
goodness," etc.</p>

<p>She signed her name firmly, addressed it to Miss Milbanke at
Seaham Hall, folded and despatched it. The first step to the rescue
of her William from the impending scandal was taken.</p>

<p>As to Anne&mdash;any woman of sense and intellect can or ought to be
able to manage her husband if she does not pull too tightly on the
bond. That aspect of the case gave her no concern whatever.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER 7. THE RISEN SUN</h2>

<p class="poem">"For who, if the rose bloomed for ever, so
greatly<br>
would care for the rose?<br>
Wherefore haste! Pluck the time in the blossom."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Owen Meredith.</p>

<p>Byron sat in his rooms, shaping a letter to Caroline. He felt
the task to be difficult, but by no means impossible. It would be
unpleasant for her, no doubt, but who could believe in, much less
respect, the feelings of a woman who had given herself so lightly
and easily. He had no more means of comprehending the depth and
agony of her passion than of deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics. A
light woman was a light woman and must expect to be treated as
such. Indeed, he had told her that his heart was a stage coach
where the passengers came and went. He had assured her that she had
come to him more readily than any Turkish woman in the bazaar at
Stamboul. He had warned her that she was safer with her husband,
"an infinitely better man than myself, if you could but realize
it," and he had found her in all things impervious to insult, a
slave, "less than the dust at his feet," as she said of herself.
His cruelties seemed only to bind her more closely to him, and as
to William Lamb, she spoke of him with the utmost freedom and an
odd affection.</p>

<p>"I like him. I even love him. But he has his political ambition
and that fills his whole heart. What does he care for me? What I
want is love, love, love, and you love me, my own beloved. You love
me?"</p>

<p>The assertion was a cry, but it evoked no answer but a careless
caress; not always even that.</p>

<p>What insult now could he find in the wide world that would
strike home and convince her, not only that he had never loved her
and never could, but that another had taken her place&mdash;such as it
was?</p>

<p>He sat by the darkening window for some time, looking down upon
the hurry of the street and the moving figures, each with its own
romance or tragedy shut behind dulled eyes and insignificant
personality. Life was a strange business&mdash;a thing to mock at if one
would not weep, and the sun setting&mdash;rather, quenched obscurely in
rainy clouds, seemed an epitome of it all.</p>

<p>Augusta was visiting him again, owing to another outburst of
insolvency at Six Mile Bottom, her husband's place in the country.
She had fled to him, leaving her husband and children to face it;
it was a part of her nature to flee always before the disagreeables
of life while being extremely agreeable to those who took her place
in the forefront of the battle. He wondered what her counsel would
be in this dilemma; she was out at the moment&mdash;but he could really
answer for her. The line of least resistance, of course, what else?
That was always her attitude. With none of Lady Melbourne's hard
wisdom, it was as impossible to shock her. He might have thought
this a distinguishing feature of the women of this strange world of
society had it not been for Caroline's horror and shame at the
thought of any possible infidelity. Ridiculous! What in the world
could she expect? Did she think they were to go on like this for
ever? He had mocked her with that absurd attitude and remembered
her streaming eyes and sobbing answer:</p>

<p>"Your fidelity is all the world to me. If that left me I have
nothing, for you are my heart and soul. Think how dear I have paid
for you&mdash;everything I possessed in the universe. My hands are
empty. See!"</p>

<p>She turned them, palms upward, with an infinitely pathetic
gesture which did not touch him in the least.</p>

<p>He sat there, wishing he liked men well enough to dispense
entirely with women. He had an engagement to dine with Rogers that
night, Moore and others to be of the party. But he was not
particularly disposed for it. In his heart he really did not care
much for the society of men, though a few of them, like Hobhouse
and Moore, liked him warmly and all usually found him the best of
good company in a roistering group. He had abandoned the biscuit
<i>régime</i> except in private, and his drinks were of a more
inspiring nature than soda water. It was impossible to do otherwise
in London, though he knew it did not suit him, but if he wanted
popularity, and he wanted it more than anything else, he must do as
other men did.</p>

<p>But, for all that, he never had a true and deep friendship with
any man, nor perhaps greatly regretted the loss. Something held him
apart from them in the secret chambers of the spirit.</p>

<p>For one thing, men of all classes are far better judges of the
breeding and nature of the gentleman&mdash;the man utterly to be
trusted&mdash;than are women. Men are quick to feel the flaw, the
spiritually plebeian streak, and this knowledge keeps them on the
alert and wary in company where they can never give the whole of
themselves, but must treat the alien with reservations.</p>

<p>With women and flatterers only could Byron be his untrammelled
self and perfectly at home. With men of his own class, a little too
familiar or too distant&mdash;conscious, uneasy, overacting his part in
all directions.</p>

<p>He dressed and went off to the quiet house overlooking the Green
Park, remembering with amusement his feelings of hidden fear the
first time he had entered it.</p>

<p>There was a gratifying stir to meet him&mdash;two obsequious
strangers, very much alive both to his rank and renown; men named
Graves and Holdsworth. Hobhouse was there and some others whom he
knew well. It promised a pleasant evening for talk and good cheer,
and Caroline slipped out of his mind altogether, although, with the
wine and the vanishing of the servants, he mentioned that he had
been spending the afternoon with Lady Melbourne.</p>

<p>Rogers smiled inwardty. So she was at work already. He believed
he could very well guess what subject my Lady had chosen for the
entertainment, and felt the deepest curiosity as to the nature of
its treatment.</p>

<p>"A remarkable woman," he said carelessly. "She reminds me of
Queen Elizabeth, with the vanity left out. She is much too clever
for such a weakness. She would be a perfect mistress of statecraft
if it came her way, because she is the only woman I ever knew who
permits neither temper nor prejudice to interfere with her
views."</p>

<p>Byron could only partly agree.</p>

<p>"I feel certain she has an excellent heart and is capable of
real friendship&mdash;a very rare gift in a woman, too. She strikes me
as being perfectly open and candid&mdash;even to a fault."</p>

<p>Moore put in his word.</p>

<p>"She can be as blunt as a bludgeon, but I think, my dear Byron
(don't you?), that bluntness is sometimes the best possible
concealment for finesse&mdash;the last covering one would be likely to
suspect. Lady Melbourne gives me the notion of a woman who would
use man or Avoman unsparingly for her own purpose."</p>

<p>"Unless she cared for him or her." Byron's smile had a tinge of
self-satisfaction. He was very sensible of the distinction of her
Ladyship's favour. Rogers laughed his little inward laugh.</p>

<p>"I have had the pleasure of knowing her for some years, and none
of you have yet named the most remarkable of her amiable qualities.
The best listener in the world! Talk to her for an hour and you
will find that you have told her everything which concerns yourself
and have not got a single word in return of what intimately
concerns her. I never knew another woman of whom that could be
said. It is a gift I have found in three or four great lawyers.
They are probably great because they have it. But a
woman&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>Byron remembered instantly how little he knew of the lady in
question. Her interest had been so natural, so flattering, that
confidence had been the only fitting return.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine her as a gossip or scandalmonger," he said
hastily.</p>

<p>"Gossip and Lady Melbourne! Heavens, no! You might as well
suspect the Egyptian sphinx of tattling to the desert. But when is
your 'Giaour' to appear, Byron? I'm told Murray is radiant with
delight, and that these are passages which raise you to the throne
of British poetry."</p>

<p>Byron was flushed and laughing in a moment.</p>

<p>"It appears very soon. Oh, Murray is easily pleased. He looks
only to the sale. I have other views. But I shall never aspire to
the throne while Mr. Rogers lives to grace it. The most I hope is
that he will accept a very humble dedication of the 'Giaour' from
his very much obliged and affectionate servant. Will you, sir?"</p>

<p>Rogers's eyes brightened. It was an honour which, in such
company, he savoured to the full.</p>

<p>"My dear Lord, you overweight my modesty. Such a dedication one
can neither be worthy of nor yet decline. I accept with enthusiasm.
What more can I say?"</p>

<p>There was a well-bred murmur of applause, and the grave
stranger, Holdsworth, was heard in a plea that his Lordship would
favour them with a few lines of the poem which was to be honoured
by and honour Mr. Rogers.</p>

<p>"It would be <i>the</i> memory of an unforgettable
occasion."</p>

<p>The others chorused the entreaty, and Byron, radiant, upborne on
the excitement of the moment, repeated the beautiful passage
relating to the ruin of the captured butterfly, ending with the
famous lines:</p>

<p class="poem">"The lovely toy so fiercely sought<br>
Hath lost its charm by being caught,<br>
For every touch that wooed its stay<br>
Hath brushed its brightest hues away,<br>
Till charm and hue and beauty gone,<br>
'Tis left to fly or fall alone."</p>

<p>His face was the young Apollo's, his voice, music's own, and the
exquisite tenderness of tone moved all present to the tribute of a
moment's silence.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Holdsworth took the lead, with a bow to the host.</p>

<p>"Setting Mr. Rogers's beautiful verse aside, who is there among
our chief poets who can compete with my Lord Byron? For my part I
see no one. Mr. Scott, who set the fashion of romantic numbers, has
been beaten on his own ground and may retire unwanted to the
Highlands with his Lady of the Lake on finding his own dominion so
brilliantly annexed. Mr. Wordsworth is a moon fading at dawn, and
as for the rest&mdash;"</p>

<p>He threw his hands out expressively. Moore said
meditatively.</p>

<p>"His novels, if one had to judge by Waverley alone, should make
their mark, but I am unwilling to guarantee immortality to his
verse."</p>

<p>Rogers applauded with softly clapping hands.</p>

<p>"My own opinion. The truth is that all lights pale before the
strong noonday sun of our young Apollo. What moon or star survives
the meridian glare? Look at Coleridge! Not that I undervalue that
weird and enchanted spirit, but as far as the public is concerned
he may betake himself to his untracked oceans and Lamia-haunted
castles and no one be a penny the worse."</p>

<p>"Coleridge, however, is a master of measure," said the grave
Holdsworth, "and for my part, though he, like others, must stand
aside while my Lord Byron's volcanic genius blazes abroad, I
believe he will sit with the greater, though not the greatest, gods
on Olympus."</p>

<p>Byron, drinking glass after glass of generous port, intervened
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"You are right, sir. I honour your discrimination. Coleridge is
a great poet. His lilt is magnificent and he is a magician with
words. Look at that passage in the Mariner beginning:</p>

<p class="poem">"'The moving moon went up the sky<br>
And nowhere did abide.'"</p>

<p>He repeated it in tones of perfect melody and added:</p>

<p>"Keats, however, I cannot stomach. What can a half-educated
apothecary's apprentice be supposed to know of the art of verse?
The man should not have the presumption. Because his brain is
crammed with ill-digested romance he takes licence to inflict it on
the world. By all means stifle Keats. He is a mere intruder."</p>

<p>"There I must be permitted to disagree with your Lordship," said
the indomitable Holdsworth, "daring as I think myself. I believe
there are the seeds of immortality in that young man. There is a
quality which, if I may so phrase it, leads the imagination
captive. Were I presumptuous enough to make a list of names which
will live in our richly dowered century I would include Keats. He
has much to learn, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Byron interrupted somewhat abruptly. An undistinguished
Holdsworth, who moreover dared to disagree with him, was scarcely
worth consideration.</p>

<p>"I should like to hear Mr. Rogers's views on Shelley. The fellow
is well born, which is always something. He does not prose like
Wordsworth, who is always half asleep, and I own that Shelley's
notions concerning politics and women, the two chief interests of
man, appeal to my sense of logic. He is not trammelled by the
Jewish teachings which have tyrannized our thought and has returned
to the pure gospel of Hellas and the ancient world."</p>

<p>"Lord bless me!" cried the hitherto silent Scotchman, Graves,
"but isn't the man an atheist and an advocate for free love?"</p>

<p>It fell into that polite circle like an avalanche, and not only
so, but reminded Moore so powerfully of the gentleman who won the
reputation of a sage by his masterly silence at dinner and lost it
by exclaiming when the Norfolk dumplings made their appearance,
"Them's the jockeys for me!" that he was obliged to stifle his
mirth in his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Free love, sir?" retorted Byron, turning the glare of his pale,
disdainful beauty upon Graves. "And has not Love wings? Are men to
be the slaves of an animal emotion common to us and the
brutes?"</p>

<p>("My second cousin and an excellent worthy man!" whispered
Rogers to Hobhouse, "but I could wish he hadn't come.")</p>

<p>Mr. Graves was not in the least cowed by his audience. The
sturdy Edinburgh man prepared himself for battle. He rose
four-square.</p>

<p>"My Lord Byron and gentlemen, this Mr. Shelley, I'm credibly
told, has openly deserted his wife, leaving her to a life of infamy
to support herself, and is living equally openly with another
woman&mdash;the daughter of a person who preaches community of goods and
women. And though I couldn't read a line of his stuff to save my
life, I hear he advocates unions which, though my Lord Byron also
advocates them, I take leave to say any decent person must regard
with abhorrence. English prosperity and piety are based on its
family life and any person who would undermine that had better
betake himself to France where such notions are warmly
welcomed."</p>

<p>"Lord save us! Is it the Kirk in session?" giggled Moore. Nobody
marked him, for every eye was on the antagonists.</p>

<p>Byron, wildly excited by wine and contradiction, blazed forth in
brilliant monologue, Graves still standing, and the company
forgetting even their wine in the interest of the moment.</p>

<p>Shelley was his text. To his doctrines he not only subscribed in
their fulness, but exceeded them, setting in the black and white of
impassioned prose what breathes like changing sunset hues in the
impalpabilities of Shelley's cloudland verse, startling even his
most seasoned hearers. He had the field to himself, for no man
cared to air hia opinion in a mixed company on such ground.</p>

<p>Once, as a hint, Rogers intervened, seeing Graves's horror and
Holdsworth's lowering brows.</p>

<p>"Excellent, my dear Byron, excellent! You are unrivalled in
taking a side you disapprove, and, for the moment, making the worse
appear the better reason. Now, delight us by taking the right side
with all your own fire and conviction. As to Shelley, his mind is
completely at sea, rolling and pitching on the waves of deplorable
personal experience, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the current could not be checked. Byron flowed on in lava,
consuming all the hard-won spoils of the ages and leaving cinders
for blossom, until he had exhausted himself and his invective.</p>

<p>Graves waited the end, and spoke bluntly:</p>

<p>"I can intend no disrespect to my worthy host and kinsman and
his company when I protest that the doctrines set forth by my Lord
Byron are just damnable. If it were possible to believe he intended
them, personal chastisement might be indicated, but I make
allowance for youth and wine. If he should wish to pursue the
matter further, that's where I can be found. I wish you a very good
night, Mr. Rogers and gentlemen. Mr. Holdsworth, sir, are you for
the road?"</p>

<p>"I'm with you, sir," replied Holdsworth, rising stiffly. "I
endorse your remarks."</p>

<p>They stalked to the door, bowed and closed it. Byron, glaring
after them, unable to speak, his face white as death, twitching all
over with nerves, his hands shaking so violently that he could
scarcely lift to his lips the glass of brandy which Moore thrust
upon him, fearing some seizure. Rogers watched quietly, his chin on
his hand. Hobhouse thrust back his chair as if to go. The episode
had had an extraordinary effect on all. Suddenly Byron pushed by
them both and made for the door without a farewell to Rogers or
any, and was gone.</p>

<p>The rest, with some effort, resumed the talk as if nothing had
happened. It seemed best to ignore it, but Hobhouse delayed after
they had dispersed, obedient to a sign from Rogers.</p>

<p>"By God, Byron's a damned fool to talk like that before men he
knows nothing of," he said. "Lord knows what impressions they've
carried away. I've remonstrated with him before now, but he thinks
he can do as he pleases. The spoilt child of genius! The world will
take anything from him."</p>

<p>"He's very gravely wrong," Rogers answered. "His popularity in
England is and will be an accident and a day might destroy it.
Think of it! England the country of conservatism, and the stuff he
has been spouting now. He has a daemonic force, a kind of lurid
conviction that made the French Revolution, and if that's his
line&mdash;well, it speaks for itself."</p>

<p>"He is the French Revolution incarnate. He has the same instinct
for destruction. He could not construct a brick shanty, but he
could tear down Westminster and all its works. As to his theories,
they have been translated into fact by some of the leaders across
the Channel. You have heard the rumours about the Bonaparte family?"</p>

<p>"I have heard. But, Hobhouse, I suppose you are his most
intimate friend except Moore, who would never have the courage to
check him. You should warn him. There are ugly whispers about his
opinions and this is not the first time he has given cause by his
folly. If he goes on England will surely avenge herself for her
intoxication. That voice we heard just now was the voice of the
average Briton and it's a force&mdash;don't forget that. We dally with
our doctrines and theories; they go on their plain bullheaded way,
and when they move, it's as well to jump a gate."</p>

<p>"For my part, though Byron spoke like a fool, the other was no
less, I thought. There's such a thing as literary criticism,"
Hobhouse said coolly.</p>

<p>"No doubt. But in England they like a great man to be great all
through. A Utopian ideal, but a sound one, in a way. I suppose it's
the Cromwellian strain in us. I own to a prejudice in that way
myself. Anyhow he may count on a childish passion of disappointment
and anger if they find the flaw in the diamond. Warn him."</p>

<p>"It's no business of mine," Hobhouse said. "Those are not the
kind of terms we are on. Wonder if he'll fight the man. He may wish
to, but in my opinion it should all be put down to your excellent
wine. Well, good night. He should apologize to you for spoiling the
good fellowship. It's damned underbred to talk like that without
knowing your company."</p>

<p>Rogers admitted that. There was no more to be said. But he
regretted that those two men had left, each a focus of horror.</p>

<p>As to Byron, he got home, scarcely knowing what had happened,
half mad with wine and excitement. His unfinished letter lay on the
table and, remembering his promise to Lady Melbourne, he sat down
to finish it and be done. Beside it was a small writing case with
writing materials which Lady Oxford had left on one of her visits,
her coronet and arms stamped on the paper. It was to inspire him
with a lyric in her honour, and instantly the thought flashed into
his brain that he could find a better use for it now, one which
would gratify her more than verses where Apollo and all the Nine
had conspired in her praises.</p>

<p>He wrote two rough drafts before he could satisfy himself, and
then committed the result to the emblazoned paper which should bear
witness to his desertion.</p>

<p class="letter">"Lady Caroline Lamb, I am no longer your lover,
and since you oblige me to confess it by this unfeminine
persecution, learn that I am attached to another whose name it
would be dishonourable to mention. I shall ever remember with
gratitude the many instances I have received of the predilection
you have shown in my favour. I shall ever continue your friend, if
your Ladyship will permit me so to style myself, and as a first
proof of my regard I offer you this advice: Correct your vanity,
which is ridiculous, exert your absurd caprices on others and leave
me in peace. Your most obedient servant."</p>

<p>There was more, but that was the incredible substance. If it
would not serve it was hard to imagine what would. Late as it was,
he turned from it to set down a few lines for which Murray was
pressing:</p>

<p class="poem">"Soft as the memory of buried love,<br>
Pure as the prayer that Childhood wafts above,<br>
Who hath not proved how feebly words essay<br>
To fix one spark of Beauty's heavenly ray?<br>
His changing cheek, his failing heart confess<br>
The might, the majesty of Loveliness."</p>

<p>It struck him as often before how little relation poetry has to
real life. None whatever, if one were candid with oneself.
"Beauty's heavenly ray," and Caroline Lamb! He smiled as he laid
his pen down.</p>

<p>From that day Lady Melbourne was his confidante and
counsellor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER 8. INTRIGUES</h2>

<p class="poem">"For love upon her Wee a shadow sate,<br>
Patient, a foreseen vision of sweet things,<br>
A dream, with eyes fast shut and plumeless wings,<br>
That knew not what man's love or life should be,<br>
What thing should come; but childlike satisfied<br>
Watched out its virgin vigil in soft pride<br>
And unkissed expectation."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Swinbuene.</p>

<p>When Anne Milbanke received that invitation it gave her sincere
pleasure. Her father's sister, Lady Melbourne, had always been kind
to her and Melbourne House always open, and, on the whole, she
preferred her relations on that side of the family to the Noels
from whom her mother, a daughter of Viscount Wentworth, sprang.
Besides, Halnaby and Seaham were apt to pall upon a girl of such
gifts as her own. The fox-hunting squires and their wives and
daughters in the big houses round about with whom the Milbankes
visited, made few trips to London and moved on an outer orbit very
different from that of the Milbankes, so close to the solar warmth
of fashion. And there was a little awe of Miss Milbanke among the
ladies. They discussed the rumour that she wrote poetry, that she
was interested in abstruse matters which would damn the matrimonial
chances of any girl who could not boast herself the heiress to a
peerage through her mother and a niece to Lady Melbourne through
her father. But, naturally, these were advantages that even
triangles and rhomboids could not rout, and it was allowed that she
did not obtrude her disquieting tastes. In a drawing-room she was
considered perfectly inoffensive and would discuss the last County
Assembly with Charlotte and Amelia Harkaway, and jams and jellies
and flannel petticoats for the old village women with Lady
Fouracres with the most smiling good nature in the world. Even when
she went to London on those starry visits to her aunt, staying
actually in a house where His Royal Highness the Prince Regent
visited as a friend, she did not return puffed up and haughty nor
did her wardrobe blaze the county toilettes into insignificance. In
short, she would have been popular if they could have understood
her. And the real difficulty was that she scarcely understood
herself&mdash;but that is a common enough failing with girls of twenty
who find the world so interesting that they have little time to
look inward.</p>

<p>When she arrived in London her welcome from her aunt was warmer
than usual. No one ever expected Lady Melbourne to be
demonstrative, but she made it apparent that Anne's was a desired
presence. There was much to say and hear of the family news and the
keenest observer could have detected no motive behind the
cordiality. In all honesty, she found the girl's quiet presence
agreeable, and doubly so in contrast with Caroline's flutters and
whirlwinds. And it was pleasanter also to have her alone. Caroline
clashed with Anne, Anne regarded Caroline as a Beautiful
Silliness&mdash;the phrase had slipped out once to her aunt and it
stuck. Lady Melbourne liked it.</p>

<p>They sat now in the boudoir (whence the macaw had been
permanently exiled until his mistress should return), and when the
family talk was ended Anne looked about her for novelties,
especially at the books on the round table between them. A
beautiful presentation copy in silk and gold caught her eye and she
took it up.</p>

<p>"The Giaour," by Lord Byron. Her eyes danced with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Oh, aunt, did he give it to you? I have so longed to read it.
Is his name in it?"</p>

<p>She turned to the title page, where stood the florid compliment
of the period, offering the author's homage to Lady Melbourne.
Aunt, family, all were forgotten and she lost herself in the
flowing music, pulling her chair near the window to catch what
light was left before they rang for candles.</p>

<p class="poem">"There, mildly dimpling, Ocean's cheek<br>
Reflects the tints of many a peak<br>
Caught by the laughing tides that lave<br>
These Edens of the Western wave.<br>
And if at times a transient breeze<br>
Break the blue crystal of the seas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blue crystal! Exquisite, exquisite," she murmured. "Shall I
read to you a little, aunt? You used to like to hear me."</p>

<p>"Yes, read!" Lady Melbourne said.</p>

<p>She was not especially fond of poetry, but she could think
better while that soft undercurrent of melody went on, and Anne
read extremely well. It was one of her accomplishments.</p>

<p>It was to be hoped Byron would not come for the first day or
two, she reflected. Of course she would not ask him, and would have
forbidden it if she had dared, but that would have been too marked.
Nothing must be marked. The two must slide unaware into a
friendship which would have been impossible but for Caroline's
absence.</p>

<p>The light outside was fading. Anne was reading now without the
faintest memory of her aunt's presence, lost in the joy of pure
harmony, untroubled as a happy spirit swaying in the treetops
beneath the crescent moon and evening star.</p>

<p class="poem">"He who hath bent him o'er the dead<br>
Ere the first day of death is fled,<br>
The first dark day of nothingness,<br>
The last of danger and distress<br>
(Before Decay's effacing fingers<br>
Have swept the lines where beauty lingers),<br>
And marked the mild angelic air,<br>
The rapture of repose that's there&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice trembled, sank into silence, and she went en reading
to herself, Lady Melbourne continuing her own train of thought
untroubled and unconscious of the silence.</p>

<p class="poem">"So coldly sweet, so deadly fair&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lacquey at the door:</p>

<p>"My Lord Byron!"</p>

<p>A man advancing slowly, evidently not seeing Anne as she sat
half hidden by the curtain; Lady Melbourne biting her lips with
annoyance. It all looked so detestably <i>planned</i>, the book,
the girl, the whole thing. She would get her out of the room as
quickly as she could.</p>

<p>But, startled into shyness by the announcement, Anne let the
book drop, and the visitor could do no less than pick it up, which
he did with much grace, recognizing it at once. That was nothing,
the same scene might have happened in a thousand London
drawing-rooms, for "The Giaour" was sweeping through England and
carrying hearts before it like dead leaves on a great west wind. If
"Childe Harold" had charmed, this enchanted, and, as usual, the
poet must be identified with the hero. The glow and glory of the
eastern atmosphere must shed its rays about him also. What secrets,
what wild adventures hovered unseen behind the little he chose to
reveal, what unsunned mysteries were hidden beneath the lovely
music of his phrases? To be his Leila, to win him, that was the
useless, hopeless passion which seized the younger women of England
like the dancing madness of the Middle Ages, or any other epidemic
of nerves overstrained. He knew it; he understood his power only
too well.</p>

<p>With his usual swiftness in appraising women's attractions, he
decided that the girl blushing over the book was not beautiful;
certainly not. But the way she raised her long lashes and disclosed
expressive blue eyes, the lovely colour in her round young face,
the shy smile, all pleased. And everything that pleases is pretty.
Was it because she was reading his poem that he decided she had an
air of <i>soul</i> about her? Who could she be?</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne waved an august hand.</p>

<p>"Anne, I wish to present Lord Byron. My niece, Miss
Milbanke."</p>

<p>Her tone was a little dry, for the thing had happened just as
she did not wish, and that small acerbity put him off the scent and
left the occasion natural.</p>

<p>"My niece has been reading aloud to me from 'The Giaour,'" the
old lady added. "I think it is a very sweet composition, and, like
all the young people, I know it pleases her."</p>

<p>"It is very much honoured," Byron said, taking a chair near her
while Lady Milbourne rang for candles. "And I don't say that as a
mere compliment, for I now remember that Lady Caroline once showed
me some charming verses and told me they were her cousin's. And
from that moment my hope was to meet that cousin."</p>

<p>Grace itself. But she, too, had her memories: she remembered
with what rapture she had listened when the authoress of "The
Scottish Chiefs," on a visit to Halnaby, had described him and they
all crowded about the fortunate lady to hear.</p>

<p>"I did not know he was in the room," she had said. "I was
talking myself when suddenly I was arrested by the sound of the
most musical speaking voice I had ever heard. I turned and saw a
gentleman in black, of an elegant figure and a face I shall never
forget. The eyes were deep-set, but mildty lustrous, and the
complexion&mdash;how shall I describe it?&mdash;a sort of moonlight paleness,
so pale yet all so softly brilliant!"</p>

<p>And Caroline, she had written long ago:</p>

<p>"He is so very pale&mdash;it is almost the beauty of death. I never
see him without wanting to cry."</p>

<p>Was all this overstrained? Now she could judge for herself.</p>

<p>The lights came, she could see him plainly at last. Yes, pale as
ivory. Surely his eyes were dark! But how the light from them
overflowed his face&mdash;that was what Miss Porter had tried to
describe as moonlight. "Moonshine!" her mother had said
impatiently. "He must be a goodlooking young man and a very clever
one, but he comes of a bad stock, and, for my part, I think the
women are all raving mad. It is positively indecent."</p>

<p>Well, she could watch at her leisure and form her own opinion,
for Lady Melbourne was monopolizing him of set purpose.</p>

<p>She drew her picture slowly from the original and it remained
for ever fixed in her mind: that first, unf orgotten sight. She had
never seen or imagined a man in the least like him. Where they were
clay, he was light. Where they were body, he was spirit. A most
beautiful, enchanting presence, and gentle, surely gentle as a
woman! His voice was a poignant melody. It enchanted. His manner to
Lady Melbourne was the perfection of deference&mdash;stooping to
conquer&mdash;any courtesy from him, though entirely unaffected, must
have that air. She sat spellbound, listening, her whole face fixed
in deep attention.</p>

<p>If her aunt would but ask him to read aloud a few verses of the
poem! All one's life it would be something to say one had heard
that, a memory to rehearse when one was an old, old woman.</p>

<p>Indeed, she watched him with a child's innocent pleasure; and he
talked the better for it, kindling himself at her vestal flame.
Very skilfully he led the talk again to her verses, entreated a
sight of some more. Should they exchange? If he promised her a
lyric, would she be gracious?</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne unbent. After all, perhaps chance had served
better than her intention, and she smiled with pleasure as,
blushing faintly, Anne promised to try and conquer her terrors. It
pleased Byron that in spite of her very evident alarm she never
lost her composure. That distinguished her from other young women
in an age of flutters and vapours, especially fluttering and
vapouring in his presence. Always she regarded him calmly from
long-lashed, expressive eyes, answering with pleasant frankness;
she might blush, though seldom, but they did not fall before his.
They were frank as a boy's. He thought her now extremely
pretty.</p>

<p>He changed the subject&mdash;and amused Lady Melbourne with an
account of an invitation from the Prince Regent to Carlton
House.</p>

<p>"I never wanted to go. There is an ancient grudge between him
and me which you may remember, though he evidently has the grace to
forgive it. But Brummell, Brummell himself, in a coat and neckcloth
which I despair of describing, walked all the way from Watier's to
my rooms&mdash;at least five minutes' distance&mdash;to assure me that the
stars would stop in their courses if I stayed away."</p>

<p>(She was leaning forward, her round chin on her little hand.
Yes, she was piquant with that light dancing in her eyes, the smile
that showed the tips of pretty teeth!)</p>

<p>"Of course that was irresistible, and I asked what I must wear.
'Powder, my Lord. Impossible to attend otherwise. Levée dress and
powder.'"</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne chuckled. She knew what it must have cost Apollo
to disguise those ambrosial curls in wintry whiteness.</p>

<p>"Well, I wish I had seen how you looked. Apollo at court!"</p>

<p>"Be thankful you didn't! But the cream of the joke is that when
I was powdered and sworded and Dallas beside me almost fainting
with excitement, the levée was put off, and I undressed and had my
head put under the pump."</p>

<p>The fascinations might have flowed on indefinitely, but that
Lady Melbourne dismissed Anne. She thought she had had enough, and,
moreover, wished for a private word with Byron. His eyes followed
the charming little figure through the door he opened for her and
he came back smiling.</p>

<p>"Now, if your Ladyship's promise had included anything of that
type, I might have been grateful to you as long as I live. But
there is no such fortune for me. A Golden Dolly is the best I can
hope, and I only wait to know and accept my doom."</p>

<p>"Pray be serious a moment. You have nothing to do with Miss
Milbanke nor she with you. I wish to ask you a question. You wrote
to Caroline. I could not wholly approve your letter, as you know.
Has she replied?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. But that may be the best possible augury. I think
there's not a woman living who would have replied to the letter I
wrote. Looking back, I scarcely know how I dared."</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne was silent. It was certainly not her part to
comment upon what had been said. There was a hint she burned to
give him, a hint of the utmost delicacy in view of the
circumstances. It must be risked.</p>

<p>"You have just alluded, Byron, to what I may call our treaty.
Has it occurred to you that if I carry out my side of it and
suggest a young woman of any delicacy of feeling, the stories
current about your connection with Lady Oxford and some others
which I don't care to name are likely to be repellent to the kind
of woman you wish to marry."</p>

<p>He looked up with a comical twinkle.</p>

<p>"I certainly hoped for a virgin whom no stories would reach or
who would not understand them if they did. But you are right, as
you always are. Of course, I must be on my best behaviour&mdash;though I
don't see how, for the life of me! And I am in the toils of another
siren at the moment, who speaks nothing but the most dulcet Italian
to me&mdash;a thing I never could resist&mdash;and wings her words with
glances from the loveliest velvet-black eyes. I never could repel
the true antelope eye! But she has one failing that may yet set me
free: I wish she did not swallow so much supper, chicken-wings,
sweetbreads, custards, peaches and port wine. The only thing a
woman should ever be seen swallowing is lobster salad and
champagne. I know nothing else becoming to a pretty mouth. Does
your Ladyship?"</p>

<p>"I have no time for trifling, and I do beg you will consider my
warning in a matter where we have a mutual interest. Those passing
affairs of yours scarcely interest me. There is one matter where
you have confided in me, and there I said, and I repeat, that if you
trifle with temptation you are lost. You are still free. Keep so,
if you value your future&mdash;and <i>hers</i>. You delight in your
reputation, Byron, but remember, you may for once go too far, and
the English people, when they <i>are</i> taken with a spasm of
morality, have blunt ways of expressing their discomfort. Be
warned!"</p>

<p>He was serious in a moment.</p>

<p>"True. Most true. But we will not discuss that. Rely on my good
sense. As to Caroline, her silence is either the best or the worst
omen. Time will show. May I call tomorrow?"</p>

<p>She agreed with a little difficulty.</p>

<p>That evening, when she and her niece were virtually alone (for
my Lord was slumbering peacefully in his velvet chair), she asked
for her opinion of the visitor. Anne hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>"Certainly he is perfectly what he ought to be&mdash;what I should
have imagined the greatest of poets. I find his face nobly
beautiful and his voice is like his own poetry. But, aunt, down in
the country we heard rumours&mdash;I have heard them more than
once&mdash;that he is a bad, untrustworthy man with women. It is
difficult to remember that while he is talking, but I thought of it
after."</p>

<p>"My dear Anne, all men are much alike, and I suppose he is no
worse than other young men of his rank. Of course his temptations
are much greater. The women flutter about him like moths about a
candle. It's revolting to see them, but can you be surprised?"</p>

<p>A pause. The girl was occupied with her own thoughts.
Presently:</p>

<p>"Aunt, is it true about Caroline?"</p>

<p>"Is what true? Any silliness and absurdity that can be imagined
is true about Caroline, if you mean that."</p>

<p>"Is it true that she is in love with Lord Byron, and he with
her?"</p>

<p>"Really, Anne, such questions are almost as absurd as Caroline
herself! There has certainly been a flirtation between them.
Caroline would flirt with a broomstick if no better offered. But
there has never been a question of love. She is incapable of loving
any one but herself; there indeed her passion is deep and sincere.
And I have Lord Byron's assurance that he is perfectly heart-whole
and has never been in love with any woman."</p>

<p>True, but a half-truth. Anne accepted it for the whole.</p>

<p>"But his life?"</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne stiffened her fine head in its drapery of
lace.</p>

<p>"Young women can't be expected to understand these things, nor
should they. You can take my word for it that all men are alike
before marriage. Afterwards, if their wives are not entirely devoid
of tact, they settle down and are the better for their experience
of life. Wild oats are much better sown before than after. And they
are invariably sown."</p>

<p>This, also, the girl accepted. It was the creed of her class,
and if Lady Melbourne did not know, who should? She asked no
more.</p>

<p>But Byron came constantly to the house. She was the first woman
in whom he had interested himself who had intellect and used it.
Very modestly, but in spite of all the reservations of her time and
age, she made it clear that she felt the charm of literature as he
felt it. Therefore, to his own astonishment, he did not make love
to her deliberately. He forgot to be consciously charming, and they
conversed and did not coquet. It was a new sensation and it pleased
and intrigued him. It flattered some remnant of boyhood that
remained unspotted in the midst of ruinous experiences. He broke an
assignation with Mary Musters, declined an invitation to Eywood,
where Lady Oxford waited impatient, witty, free-tongued, eager to
be informed of Caroline Lamb's downfall (a circumstance which gave
her infinite amusement in her solitude). Meeting Hobhouse, who had
been visiting there, Byron asked after his inamorata, but
carelessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I dined there. Lady Oxford most uncommon in her talk&mdash;as
licentious as ever. Uncommon civil. She asked about you, what you
were doing. And all the little Harleys, the Harleian Miscellany,
well also."</p>

<p>The beautiful profligate! Byron laughed to himself. The autumn
of a beauty like hers was preferable to the spring of others, he
thought. But spring&mdash;spring had its primrose charm, too! Would it
hold, would it last? That was the question.</p>

<p>That day Anne had a verse or two to show him&mdash;the first&mdash;and
with infinite timidity, flying blushes, blissful terrors&mdash;that he
should deign, that she should dare.</p>

<p>"But you will tell me the truth, not be polite. Tell me if they
are so bad that I must never try again. I shall do exactly what you
tell me."</p>

<p>"In everything?"</p>

<p>"In that."</p>

<p>She laid the folded paper in his hand and sat, frightened
indeed, but still with her own composure. He read first to
himself&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"I saw the sinking evening star<br>
In oceans of the crimson west.<br>
It sets on us to rise afar<br>
Above the Islands of the Blest.<br>
<br>
"Where happy eyes may turn to see<br>
Its silver trembling like a tear<br>
On Sorrow's cheek, and fearfully<br>
Bethink them of our world too near."</p>

<p>He read it aloud, in a voice which moved her like the cry of a
violin, playing upon the heartstrings of all who hear, then laid it
down and looked at her.</p>

<p>"That idea is poetry. What made you think of it?"</p>

<p>"It came. Where do things come from? But I guess its faults.
Please show them to me."</p>

<p>"It might be better expressed, and in the last line certainly,
but the poet's thought is there. I envy it to you. The very star
carries the taint of our miseries with it to new and happier
heavens. True as truth! But what should you know of misery? May
your eyes be as bright and calm fifty years hence as they are
to-day! And I believe they will. Show me more."</p>

<p>She did so. They passed hours talking, reading, commenting. She
pressed him to industry, for he owned he had laid his pen aside in
the distractions of distracting London. Many women had praised his
work, none but herself had urged him to continue, to excel, to
surpass himself as he had surpassed all others. It touched and
spurred him. He began "The Bride of Abydos." She directed his
attention to Goethe's "Wilhelm Meister" and to the wild and
beautiful song of Mignon, "Kennst du das Land," and its lovely echo
in the opening lines of "The Bride" was hers in right of that
discovery:</p>

<p class="poem">"Knowest thou the land where the cypress and
myrtle<br>
Are emblems of deed that are done in their clime?"</p>

<p>She sat enchanted to hear some of the lines as he wrote them.
Once or twice he consulted her taste, deferred to it. At last he
came almost daily to read, to talk. Happy days, days with the
savour of a lost Eden for him, of an unknown Eden for her. Daily
they drew nearer to each other, their paths converging to the
meeting. Lady Melbourne watched in almost breathless excitement.
She could not tell whether Byron suspected that this had been her
aim all along. She knew Anne did not.</p>

<p>One day he caught her alone.</p>

<p>"Lady Melbourne, we have had confidences which encourage me to
more. I can't tell what wife you had in view for me when I am free
of the miserable tie we discussed, but my own mind is made up. Miss
Milbanke is the woman I mean to marry. I know nothing of her
fortune and care nothing, but when either the Newstead or Rochdale
arrangements are closed, I shall have sufficient for us both. My
debts are not £25,000, and the deuce is in it if I can't contrive
to be as independent as any other peer."</p>

<p>"Do I understand that you love her?"</p>

<p>"How can I say that? I know little of her, and I have not the
most distant reason to suppose she would accept me, but I admire
her, she is a clever girl&mdash;a thing I have detested hitherto, but
she makes everything amiable. She is highly born, and I still have
prejudices on that score, if I am to marry. She is pretty enough to
be loved by her husband&mdash;if such a thing as love exists, which, as
you know, I doubt&mdash;but has none of the glaring beauty which brings
trouble. She is a woman I could marry with esteem and confidence,
and that is the only foundation I believe in for marriage."</p>

<p>"You speak very sensibly, but&mdash;is it not a little cold?"</p>

<p>Byron smiled ironically.</p>

<p>"I have been warm enough with other women, and that did not
please you. What am I to do?"</p>

<p>They were both silent for a moment, and then he looked her in
the face.</p>

<p>"Would it have your approval if I persisted?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I could have no personal objection, though I
shouldn't have supposed her the girl to attract you. For her
parents, I cannot answer."</p>

<p>"If I can win her approval and yours, I shall trust to time for
the rest. As to Caroline, so much time has gone by now that I begin
to believe she has taken the matter as sensibly as any ordinary
woman."</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne shook her head. It might be so, but she could
hardly take that sanguine view. She knew her Caroline too well.</p>

<p>She dropped a hint, no more, and that the faintest, of Byron's
interest to Anne, and though it was calmly received, she observed a
little flutter of the gold-tipped lashes which spoke more than
words.</p>

<p>Peace reigned in Melbourne House. The gay world beat and
throbbed at its doors, but there was no disturbance of heart inside
them&mdash;possibly the calm which old sailors call a weather-breeder,
but infinitely refreshing to the three concerned. Lady Melbourne
was deeply and sincerely gratified at her own success in
match-making. It would extinguish Caroline's hopes and silence
scandal once and for all, it would fix Anne's future in marriage
with possibly the only man in her caste to whom her unusual tastes
could be an allurement and it would be a most desirable match for
Byron himself. That last consideration weighed with her perhaps
most of all. He had won her heart as far as she had any heart to
win, which was not saying a great deal, but he interested and
amused her, and the more alarming his confidences, the more the old
worldling saw the necessity of settling him beyond the reach of
absolutely ruinous temptations. Neither she nor any one else could
expect from him rigorous fidelity to a wife, but the comforts of
domestic life are a sure pull in the long run and Anne might be
more attractive than she supposed. He certainly could not behave
after marriage as he was doing now. If any sense of discomfort as
to some of those confidences invaded her complacency, she could put
it aside very well. Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world, and
if Anne was blessed with the young Apollo, all the world knows
there are spots in the sun.</p>

<p>Four days later, whilst Anne sat writing to her mother, debating
whether she should or should not mention Byron's frequent visits,
and Lady Melbourne read her long, carefully crossed letters in the
depth of her winged chair, there was a rattle of coach wheels
below. Neither heeded and the thing had been forgotten in the
silence that followed, when the door was flung open and Caroline
came into the room, so lean, so pale, her eyes burning so
fever-bright, so ghastly a face, that they both sprang to their
feet. She tottered as she came forward, putting out her hands
blindly before her as if feeling her way, and cried in a hoarse,
muffled voice more dreadful than a shriek:</p>

<p>"He has cast me off! I shall die of it! I refuse to endure this
hell of agony. Send for him&mdash;I must and will see him!"</p>

<p>She pushed Anne from her as she sprang forward to save her from
falling, and sank half fainting into a chair.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER 9. AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE</h2>

<p class="poem">"Shake hands for ever. Cancel all our vows,<br>
And when we meet at any time again<br>
Be it not seen in either of our brows<br>
That we one jot of former love retain."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Michael Drayton.</p>

<p>Caroline Lamb had returned in an alarming condition of body and
mind. They acted and reacted on each other, and both were broken in
the hysterical struggle. But no help was possible, for she was
prisoned in her narrow world of blazing agony and it was peopled
only by herself and Byron. No other voice could reach her, and of
what she inflicted on others she knew and cared nothing.</p>

<p>On them the sun shone&mdash;what did they matter to a dweller in the
dark, lit only by the flames of hell? I, I&mdash;the true ego-maniac,
the <i>I</i> recurrent as the tick of a clock.</p>

<p>For the first few days she was so ill that there was no power to
move. She could only lie and rave about her sufferings to her
husband, to Lady Melbourne, Anne, and any one who happened to be
with her&mdash;all were condemned to hear the reiteration of her bitter
tale. Lady Melbourne drew William aside after one of these visits
when even through the shut door they could hear her cries and
sobs.</p>

<p>"I don't know how you endure it!" she said, with a most unwonted
softening about the lips and eyes. He looked a little wearied, but
had no other sign of emotion.</p>

<p>"It must be endured. Caroline is&mdash;Caroline. I treat her as a
child, and am infinitely sorry for the hard lessons life is
teaching her. It might spare itself the pains. She can never learn.
What else is there to say? No help for either of us."</p>

<p>His mother looked gravely at him.</p>

<p>"There is another thing you can do."</p>

<p>"Divorce? Never! What&mdash;drag that wretched girl and myself
through that immitigable horror? And for what? God forbid she
should marry him or any other, and to me&mdash;marriage is&mdash;"</p>

<p>His face said the rest.</p>

<p>"I see that. I feel it. Separation was in my mind."</p>

<p>"It may come to that. I think it will, but not yet," he
answered, and going off to the library, shut himself in and got out
his papers. They, at least, represented a world of tangible effort
and result. In his miserable home he was perpetually fighting
phantoms, intangible, contemptible things sucking all the good from
life and flitting out of reach whenever he struck at them. He did
not hate Caroline; he loved her still, with a pitiful stooping
tenderness. He did not even hate Byron. Man-like, he could estimate
his temptation, and no man knew better than he that Byron would pay
the price for his distraction. Besides, these things were done in
the world where they both lived and the more public a thing of the
kind the more ridicule for the husband. The days were not so far
distant when he himself had seen the comedy of such affairs. The
manners of the day saw them only with mockery and in what did his
case differ from the rest?</p>

<p>Yet it differed even in the world. He would never be
contemptible, for there was an unusual mercy and understanding for
William Lamb among their friends, strengthening as time went on.
They could not estimate the suffering of that long endurance, but
they saw it with astonishment and paid it the tribute of
silence.</p>

<p>But life was hard&mdash;hard. His children passed the door laughing,
but he did not open it to sun himself in the light of bright
innocent eyes. The eldest boy, the relic of his brief married
happiness, would never grow up, would be a child as long as he
lived, and it was not even in a father's heart to hope his life
might be long.</p>

<p>Next to William, Anne was Lady Melbourne's care. Could she have
foreseen she would have packed her back to her mother out of sight
and hearing of the tragedy. But it was too late. The girl was
plunged into the very heart of its squalor before anything could be
done to blind her. The rumours had reached her much earlier, but
this was realization.</p>

<p>She met the trouble in her own way, efficient, composed&mdash;not a
word, a breath of her feelings. She went to her aunt two days later
and put herself at her disposal.</p>

<p>"Aunt, would you prefer my going home, or can I be useful? I
think Caroline seems quieter with me than with, any one else."</p>

<p>"My dear, what can you be but useful? But you are not to
consider that. What do you wish yourself?"</p>

<p>"I am content either to go or stay. I should like to help
you."</p>

<p>"Then will you stay a week longer?"</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne was almost distracted in this downfall of her
hopes, but it could do no harm now if Anne stayed. She knew all
there was to know, and perhaps, with a week's grace, something
might happen. Caroline might come to her senses. Byron's fixed
resolution might tell. His charm might conquer in spite of all. She
wished Anne were not so silent, for if she would but speak there
might be reasoning, argument.</p>

<p>But never a word. She tended Beautiful Silliness like a sister,
and at the end of the week, when Lady Melbourne did not prolong the
invitation, seeing nothing could come of it, she went quietly home,
with a pressure of the hand to William Lamb, which conveyed the
only sympathy he could accept.</p>

<p>Byron was nearly as frantic in his own fashion as Caroline in
hers. He felt himself thwarted at every turn which presented a
glimmer of hope. The miserable woman!&mdash;he would never forgive her
as long as he lived. He did not know whether he loved Anne
Milbanke, all his self-tormenting introspection was unable to
reveal the mystery of love to eyes blinded by passion. But he did
know that she was the only woman he had ever wished to marry, and
that marriage had come to represent to him peace, security, safety,
and undreamed-of possibilities of work carried to great issues.
There had been a revolution in his thought promising freedom from
strangling bonds, and now all was over.</p>

<p>He saw a house like Newstead, stately, beautiful, with English
trees, sweeping robes of green round bird-haunted lawns and long
glades and woodland alleys where the pheasants strutted and
blackbirds fluted, and deer glimpsed through deep bracken and
leafage. How beautiful! How beautiful! At Newstead he had known and
cared so little. But now, growing into luminance, he saw daily in
his musings the life he yet might choose if he would.</p>

<p>There would be great rooms, filled with the precious relics of
the past, the possessions of the men and women of his blood. Their
faces would smile, familiar, from panelled walls, the evil they had
done washed clean in the cold waters of death, the kinship
left.</p>

<p>There would be generous hospitalities by glowing Christmas
fires, holly berries shining from glittering garlands, the sounds
of wassail from the servants' hall. In cheerful winter sunshine the
hounds would meet before the wide portico with jovial huntsmen in
coats that matched the berries, and shouting and laughter of men
and women, gay in a wholesome sport. His own people, free of the
heritage he was born to, but had never shared. The secrecies, the
sly subterfuges ended, the feverish intrigues with their haunting
pains and pleasures, done for ever.</p>

<p>He mused much on this for a while. Could it be that the true
Romance had been sitting beside him with veiled face while he
sought her feverishly along the Mediterranean shores and in the
ancientries of Italy and Greece? Did she haunt the English woods
and love the primroses and wild blue-bells as well as all the roses
of Stamboul? If so&mdash;O God, what a fool he had been! What a
birthright he had bartered for how miserable a mess of pottage!</p>

<p>But marriage must be the centre of it all. There must be a wife
whom he could trust and honour. She must love him, but she must
love other things better, for these last when the other breaks down
under human failure. Honour, duty, the rights and claims of a great
position must be the lodestars of her life. She must be the
queenconsort, seconding him in her own sphere as in his if he could
hope to take his place as an English peer and lawmaker.</p>

<p>It must be a planned life, steadfastly carried out to a fine
conclusion, if it were to be anything. It would be much&mdash;much to
redeem the Byron follies and set the honour of his house to shine
on high. And it might be done in other ways beside this literary
success of which he was half ashamed in spite of its
sweetness&mdash;half doubtful if it were worthy of him. He felt these
other successes would call to something which lay within him deeper
and stronger than all his lust of fame.</p>

<p>But the wife? She would bring him noble children. Those, at
least, he felt he could love&mdash;his own, the inheritors of his
renown, and more&mdash;of the locked and frozen good in him that could
not be dead, else whence came these phantom longings? Children.
Even now they touched a tenderness in his soul. His verses written
to Ianthe, the small Lady Charlotte Harley, were not written to
please her beautiful vicious mother, Lady Oxford&mdash;the wondering
sweet eyes, water-clear in innocence, had touched some spring of
feeling which brought a mist to his own. If eyes as clear&mdash;his own
and another's mingled&mdash;looked up at him&mdash;how would it be then?</p>

<p>Images, pictures, shifting dreams, filled his mind in those days
of intercourse with Anne Milbanke.</p>

<p>She had the fine tradition of caste and class, and she had more.
Intellect, a kind of proud gentleness, swift response, amazing
dignity for so young a girl. He felt her to be the
stronger-purposed. He could lean on her where he was weak; if
only&mdash;if only he were not bound hand and foot to a most fettering
past!</p>

<p>Lady Oxford could be disposed of; he would see to that, and did
so with very little expenditure of finesse, for there had never
been a question of love between them. They left shortly after for
Italy and he heard of her in Rome, parading with his picture at her
girdle. And for the moment some other follies were quiescent, and
at last he had begun to hope.</p>

<p>And then Caroline's return shattered his hope into
fragments.</p>

<p>He could not go near the house. He wrote incessantly to Lady
Melbourne and she kept him informed. Presently came news that
Caroline was recovered in body and that she had appeared to resume
her normal life.</p>

<p>It caused him only one feeling, cold sharp-edged cruelty, the
resolve to end the persecution somehow, anyhow. There was no room
left for anything but that and a repulsion no words could ever
express.</p>

<p>He was alone one evening, lost in dreams and regrets, when
Fletcher, the valet, came in.</p>

<p>"Boy wants to see your Lordship. Message about some parcel by
the Derbyshire coach. He has it with him, but won't give it to me.
From a lady, he says."</p>

<p>"Bring the young fool in and then kick him out. I'm busy," was
all Byron vouchsafed.</p>

<p>A light step outside, Fletcher outrun, the door flung open and
flung to, and Caroline at his feet, tossing off the hat that had
hid her eyes and brow.</p>

<p>The revulsion of feeling was horrible; he pulled himself back
from her touch as he heard Fletcher's discreet cough outside. He
shook his hand as from the touch of something loathsome. Disgust
ran through him from head to foot. The great lady! Had she bribed
the servant&mdash;was he a party to her shame of abasement? With what
had he himself been trifling?</p>

<p>"Byron, Byron, you're killing me! Do you want me to die? Look at
me. See how ill I have been (displaying piteous hands like bird
claws, that matched her hollow cheeks). You can't mean it.
Something has come between us. Oh, what am I to do. I'm at the
end&mdash;the end. Have pity&mdash;have pity!"</p>

<p>He did his best with words, and there indeed he was a master. He
poured insult upon her as she lay moaning and sobbing on the
ground, and she heard not a word, could not listen, was incapable
of anything but agony.</p>

<p>She implored him to fly with her. She confessed that she had
forged a letter to John Murray to induce him to deliver up a
miniature which had been left in his charge. She spared herself in
nothing.</p>

<p>He sat before her, blind and deaf to entreaty, reiterating the
sentence of doom. He would never see her again. Could he be plainer
than he had been in his letter? And still she sobbed broken-hearted
at his feet.</p>

<p>"I can't live without you, how can I? We are one thing. You
would care for me still if I could hold myself away, but I can't. I
never was wise; I never knew how to pretend that you had to win me,
and must I pay for that? Oh, try to see how much I gave and then
you'll perhaps be a little&mdash;a <i>little</i> grateful. Oh, Byron,
are you so blind; do you know what you are killing?"</p>

<p>"I only know one thing&mdash;you're spoiling my life and I mean to be
rid of you."</p>

<p>"Do you owe me nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"And you taunt me because I gave?"</p>

<p>"Women are always giving&mdash;forcing it on us, and then taunting us
because we take. What are you doing but taunting me now? You'll get
nothing by it. I'm done with you."</p>

<p>She sobbed so cruelly that he was frightened at last. He tried
reason.</p>

<p>"Attend to me, Caroline. Try to understand your position and
mine. I see only two relations between men and women. Marriage and
depravity. A woman is respected in the one&mdash;a man respects his
wife. In the other he despises the woman. There is no halfway
house. Ours was not marriage. Draw your own conclusion. I can feel
no otherwise."</p>

<p>She rose on her knees and looked up at him with tearwashed eyes,
paler than death because of the streaks of red here and there on
ghastly cheeks.</p>

<p>"But you write of love like ours. You make it beautiful. Was
that a lie too? Your men love the women who love them. I can't
understand."</p>

<p>"Poetry and real life have nothing to do with one another.
Certainly not mine. All that is romance and unreal as dreams."</p>

<p>She dragged herself slowly to her feet by the arm of his
chair.</p>

<p>"I had better go."</p>

<p>"Much better," he said. And suddenly something in her look
frightened him in his turn. She looked capable of any desperate
act, and no one who knew her so well as he but must know that moods
like madness took her when self-control was not even a name to her,
and no one on earth could tell where she would be driven. There
might indeed be a scandal which Lady Melbourne would like less than
one which after all was not so uncommon but what it could be
faced.</p>

<p>Worn out and at his wit's end he tried then to compromise&mdash;as
one might with a delirious child. He would write to her
sometimes&mdash;yes, he would write her kind letters if she would now
allow him to take her back to Melbourne House.</p>

<p>She looked at him, exhausted, infinitely pathetic, with that
strange innocency which set her apart.</p>

<p>"I will do what you tell me. You will write? That would almost
satisfy me. I think I could bear it then. You won't cut me off
utterly? Then I will go. I have not been wicked&mdash;I loved you
so!"</p>

<p>He saw no pathos. He was grinding his teeth in impotent anger.
To get rid of her somehow&mdash;anyhow&mdash;that was all he cared for.</p>

<p>His carriage was called. He threw a cloak about her boy's dress
and drove her back to Melbourne House&mdash;would not go in; left her at
the door, saw her totter in, stumbling as she went&mdash;a pitiful and
tragic sight, though not in his eyes.</p>

<p>Then he returned to his rooms and, summoning all his reason,
looked his life in the face. Did he want it to go on like
that&mdash;what happiness or prosperity did it promise him? And in that
mood, and no other, he sat down and wrote a proposal of marriage to
Anne Milbanke. He felt that in her, in the things she represented,
lay his only hope of extrication. In all the wide world he could
see no other.</p>

<p>After the most anxious thought he enclosed the letter in one to
Lady Melbourne, telling her its contents and entreating her good
offices. He felt that if the offer were under her auspices it might
counteract the impression that the Melbourne family thought him
much to blame in his dealings with Caroline. There he was able to
say he had done his utmost, and surely if he were married, she
would realize the affair was ended. Lady Melbourne might perhaps
take that view. Even then he did not understand that it had been
her intention from the first.</p>

<p>The inevitable days between his letter and any possibility of
answer passed like a bad dream. Could he&mdash;dare he&mdash;hope when he
remembered Anne Milbanke had heard Caroline's ravings, and had seen
the wreckage to which he might be supposed to have brought her?</p>

<p>He was too restless either to endure his own company or that of
the gay world, and the only resource was to sit at his club
watching the other men as they came and went, envying their
careless looks.</p>

<p>As soon as it was possible the answer came, enclosed in a letter
from Lady Melbourne. A refusal.</p>

<p>It was gentle, but definitely clear. There was no more to be
said. But there was much to be felt and done.</p>

<p>It was an unbearable shock to his pride. From Lady Melbourne
downward it was now his task to convince all concerned that he
regarded the whole matter as a jest, and was wounded neither in
affection nor self-esteem. If the dream were shattered, at least it
should not shatter his consequence. Lady Melbourne had begged him
not to show any resentment if there should be a refusal. She might
have spared herself the trouble. He wrote to her at once, bleeding
with hurt pride and vanity:</p>

<p>"<i>Cut her!</i> My dear Lady Melbourne. Mahomet forbid! I am
sure we shall be better friends than before, and if I am not
embarrassed by all this I cannot see why she should be. Assure her,
with my respects, that the subject shall never be renewed in any
shape whatever, and assure yourself that were it not for this
<i>embarras</i> with Caroline, I would much rather remain as I am.
I have had so very little intercourse with the fair philosopher
that if, when we meet, I should endeavour to improve her
acquaintance she must not mistake me, and assure her I shall never
mistake her. She is perfectly right in every point of view, and,
during the slight suspense, I felt something very like remorse for
sundry reasons not at all connected with Caroline nor with any
occurrences since I knew you or her or hers. Finding I must marry,
however, on that score I should have preferred a woman of birth and
talents, but such a woman was not at all to blame for not
preferring me. My <i>heart</i> never had an opportunity of being
much interested in the business, further than that I should have
very much liked to be your relation. And now to conclude, like Lord
Toppington, 'I have lost a thousand women in my time, but never had
the ill manners to quarrel with them for such a trifle.'"</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He read and reread this letter and felt it to be a masterpiece of
elegant cynicism. That it would reach Anne he felt sure, and it
would leave the door open for further possibilities. The proposal
of improving her acquaintance, made with the careless good nature
of a man who cared little or nothing for the answer, would pique
her, and at the back of his thought was the chance that he might
yet bring her to his feet and give the opportunity of acceptance or
rejection to himself. Little less would heal his wound.</p>

<p>He felt as he sealed and despatched his letter that the end was
not yet&mdash;at the same time understanding her so little that he took
the precaution to mention jestingly to one or two of his friends
that he had proposed to the heiress and had been refused. She might
boast of it and if he had prepared the ground by boasting of her
refusal no one could suppose it had gone deep. He wished to
persuade himself as well as others that it had not, and then,
trying to put it all behind him for a time, he steadily addressed
himself to the task of breaking with Caroline without the lunatic
outburst which might be his ruin as well as hers. Useless to dwell
on that miserable time. She spared neither him nor herself in
anything and dragged them both through the depths of semi-public
disgrace. He had by no means done with her yet.</p>

<p>As a poet his glory grew daily, and Europe was at his feet. The
great romantic poems appeared one after the other, and with each
the thought glowed in his heart that the woman who had dared to
reject him must see and feel her loss. "The Giaour," "The Bride of
Abydos," "The Corsair," "Lara"&mdash;all built his fame up into a tower
the pride of which reached heaven. Napoleon and Goethe and he
divided the attention of the world between them&mdash;so Moore told him
laughing, and so in his soul he believed. The calm judgment of men
and women was blinded where he was concerned; he dazzled,
fascinated, filled some with a half-superstitious awe.</p>

<p>Southey, who detested the man and his attitude to life, spoke of
the insidious softness of his manner. It was like a tiger, patting
something which had not angered him, with his paw, the talons
sheathed. "The prevailing expression in his fine countenance was
something which distrusted you, and which it could never be
possible for you or me to trust." He could not bring himself to
continue meeting him.</p>

<p>He had almost the snake's power of paralyzing and charming with
a sort of <i>under</i> look he used to give. Many impressions of
that strange, almost sorcerous look survive: some, it
alarmed&mdash;some, it drew irresistibly.</p>

<p>Even those who best realized the poison hidden in the sweetness
of his verse and knew that his practice matched his preaching,
succumbed to the melancholy grace of his manner when he chose to
conquer.</p>

<p>So he lived his life to the uttermost, snatching and bruising
and trampling, pressing every drop of forbidden sweetness from the
clustered vines. He was infinitely more dangerous because of Anne
Milbanke's rejection. It drove him into a mad revolt, alike of
speech and life, which spared none who crossed his path.</p>

<p>There were times when he thought of himself as the great
Florentine (but with what a difference!)&mdash;the man who had passed
through hell. And, if it were so, at all events it should not be
alone. He would drag another with him.</p>

<p>Another.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER 10. ANGLING</h2>

<p class="poem">"The star which rules thy destiny<br>
Was ruled ere earth began by me.<br>
The hour arrived and it became<br>
A wandering mass of shapeless flame,<br>
A bright deformity on high,<br>
The monster of the upper sky."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Byron.</p>

<p>So life developed, and under the glittering surface of triumph,
the sparkles that danced on the blue crystal of the ocean, strange
monsters made their dwelling, haunting the dark deeps. Terrible
ties were now binding him. He believed that he could throw them off
when he would&mdash;what had he not broken loose from when it wearied
him, he thought with pride, never perceiving that his own nature
was now subtly interpenetrated and his citadel possessed by
traitors nearer to him than his own flesh and blood? That
revelation would come in thunder one day, for at present the work
was proceeding with the certitude and quiet of an oak's growth from
the small brown shell which holds its knotted fibre and snaky roots
enclosed in a case a baby may toss away.</p>

<p>On that he never thought, never brooded. He could not think.
Goethe, summing up the matter in his final and august criticism of
Byron's powers, said:</p>

<p>"<i>Sobald er reflectirt ist er ein Kind</i>" "When he begins to
reflect he is but a child." In other words, he is the radiant, the
incomparable poet of the objective life, the life of daring, proud
irresistible power, adventure and rebellion, but in the deeper
things lying below the threshold of consciousness, that wellspring
in the heart of mystery whence the highest minds drink inspiration,
he is an ignorant child. So also with his life.</p>

<p>The poet of a passionate individuality, yet incapable of
understanding the true individuality which is one with the
Absolute, he created his own frightful loneliness in life and death
and made his proper hell. If the deep, serene introspection of
Oriental thought had caught him, if he could have tasted the
ecstasy of the flight of the One to the One, he might have found
peace and his genius have expanded like a broad and tranquil river
mirroring the triumph of the dawn, the glories of sunset, and
fructifying its happy banks instead of dashing itself to dust in
the foaming rapids. But that was never to be. The doctrine of
reincarnation had some charm for him and his imagination played
round the belief that he might be expiating the crimes of some
former earth-life, destined to greater which it was his part to
enact, predestined to his own ruin and that of the lives interwoven
with his fate. The darker side of the belief attracted him, but not
its hope, and the creed of the West accepts his brief six and
thirty years as the sole preparation for an eternal destiny.</p>

<p>He gloried in the fame he was achieving. It was a necessity of
his existence, but also a weapon of war. He went down to Newstead
in Augusta's company to sharpen it, and there shut himself up for a
time to enjoy his success. It seemed the world loved his scowling
romantic despots; then they should have enough and to spare.
Murray, his publisher, kicked. He feared his Lordship was
over-writing, that the public might find a sameness in this
sentimental outpouring, and ventured to express his alarm lest the
vein of gold were being worked out; and Byron, indignant, almost
tore the manuscript from his grasp.</p>

<p>Wisdom was justified of her children. "The Corsair" was
published and Murray himself wrote, borne on a wind of
exultation:</p>

<p class="letter">"My Lord:<br>
<br>
"I have been unwilling to write until I had something to say. I am
most happy to tell you that your last poem is&mdash;what Mr. Southey's
is called&mdash;a Carmen Triumphale. Never in my recollection has any
work excited such a ferment. I sold on the day of publication&mdash;a
thing perfectly unprecedented&mdash;10,000 copies. You have no notion of
the sensation which the publication has excited, and my only regret
is that you were not present to witness it."</p>

<p>Byron's triumph knew no bounds. The money involved would have
been more than welcome, for the sale of Newstead was not completed
nor likely to be as far as he could see, and his affairs were
seriously embarrassed. But the fantastic code of honour of the
English Gentleman of Birth forbade him to touch the money he had
earned, and Dallas, the ever-useful, was obliged to write to the
papers on his behalf to deny the frightful imputation that he had
benefited to the extent of one penny by his labours. A peer might
beg, borrow, and even steal (under certain conditions), but to earn
a farthing by honest labour would leave a spot on his ermine which
no penitence could efface. It was made clear, however, that this
un-Corsair-like crime had not been committed, and the world was
able to enjoy his poetry in comfort.</p>

<p>After long consideration he sent a copy of "The Corsair" to Anne
Milbanke. She came seldom to London now, but the thought of her had
never left him even in the midst of the fatal ties he had formed.
She would always represent certain values which he had not found
elsewhere, and she caused him a fading regret like the dying torch
of sunset on a low sea horizon.</p>

<p>This book would please her, coming from his hand. It would speak
for him of things he could not say himself&mdash;his fame, remembrance,
pardon. There was a song of Medora's which, if she pleased, she
might apply to her own relations with him.</p>

<p class="poem">"Deep in my soul that tender secret dwells,<br>
Lonely and lost to light for evermore,<br>
Save when to thine my heart responsive swells,<br>
Then trembles into silence as before.<br>
<br>
"There in its centre, a sepulchral Lamp,<br>
Burns the slow flame, eternal but unseen,<br>
Which not the darkness of despair can damp,<br>
Though vain its rays as it had never been."</p>

<p>Beautiful and yet more beautiful when the Byronic music was
fresh on the world's ear. Less beautiful now when all can grow the
flower, for all have stolen the seed. Most beautiful of all in a
woman's ear to whom he had offered his heart and who had rejected
it with agony known only to herself.</p>

<p>She knew the handwriting, opened the book with shaking hands,
read the poem from the first bounding line&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea"</p>

<p>to the last&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"He left a Corsair's name to other times<br>
Linked with one virtue and a thousand crimes&mdash;"</p>

<p>and every word of it struck home like a personal experience.</p>

<p>That, that indeed was himself. And was the one virtue fidelity
to a lost ideal, and were the thousand crimes those passionate
pursuits of false fires of which she herself had seen the bitter
fruitage at Melbourne House? And, if so, had he repented, and could
the woman he loved pardon him and believe in his redemption at her
hands? "Yet even Medora might forgive the kiss," she read. The
question was&mdash;could Anne Milbanke forgive, and, forgiving,
forget.</p>

<p>She took the book with her into the whispering woods, and read
it until every word had sunk through her brain to her heart and it
had become a part of all her dreams&mdash;the dawn, the sunset, were
lovely because he had painted their glory as no other living hand
could do:</p>

<p class="poem">"Slow sinks, more lovely ere his race be run,<br>
Along Morea's hills the setting sun."</p>

<p>Could she believe that a heart so attuned to the Beautiful was
anything worse than tempted and falling to rise again? Dangerous
thoughts, the most dangerous such a woman can harbour, besieged
her; the passion for reformation of the man she loved and by her
own strength.</p>

<p>Might she not dedicate herself to his happiness and good? With a
home worthy of him, an adoring wife and children, his great gifts a
world's wonder, a heart to sympathize beside him always, dignity,
honour, friends, what then could harm a nature naturally noble but
bitterly misled by unparalleled temptation?</p>

<p>It was the meeting of the two dreams, his and hers, but many
waters had flowed under the bridge since he had dreamed it, and he
was by no means the man she had known at Melbourne House. Far other
indeed.</p>

<p>It might have profited her if instead of dreaming she had
studied a few simple lines written by a certain Ayrshire ploughman
whom she might have considered uncouth and beneath the notice of a
young woman of birth and intellect, but who nevertheless knew by
bitter experience of what he was writing in words which open the
door of the libertine's heart with the key of bitter truth.</p>

<p class="poem">"I waive the quantum of the sin,<br>
The hazard of concealing,<br>
But, oh, it hardens all within,<br>
And petrifies the feeling."</p>

<p>And the marble heart which Byron had worn on his sleeve for a
decoration was by this time marble indeed, or harder than any
marble, for stone lives its own cold life, and a human heart
petrified is like the devils' work in the Inferno of Dante&mdash;enamel,
where never lodging earth nor blown seed can rest or grow.</p>

<p>But the thought tempted her for love's sake, and with fear, but
a thrilling delight, stepping again into the zone of danger, she
wrote to thank him and to speak of her admiration of this new
outburst of flame and lava from the volcano of his genius. Could
she do less when an honour which half the world would covet was
laid at her feet?</p>

<p>Besides, she had heard from Lady Melbourne of the almost
desperate efforts he had made to repel Caroline. She knew that Lady
Oxford had left England, and that if she was flaunting Byron's
miniature about Rome it was because the original had escaped her.
What was she to think but that her refusal might&mdash;must have
something to do with these portents?</p>

<p>If she could have seen his jesting, mocking correspondence with
Lady Melbourne the tone would have terrified her, but that was a
closed book to her. Her aunt still desired the marriage and was not
likely to inform her. Still less likely was she to pass on her
knowledge that Byron had proposed to leave England for Sicily with
Augusta, whose husband was over head and ears in money
embarrassments.</p>

<p>Yet, when Anne had written her letter, she tore it up and
confined herself to a kind if somewhat frozen letter of thanks. But
she would test him, though much more cautiously.</p>

<p>She wrote instead a letter to Lady Melbourne, alluding to the
engagement of a friend, and giving her own girlviews of what was to
be hoped for in the husband. She wrote often to her aunt and this
would pass for an ordinary letter, though, at the same time, if
passed on, it might provoke some enlightening comment which would
reveal his hidden mind.</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne may have suspected the timid ruse. She sent the
letter to Byron, and he wrote swiftly and cynically in reply&mdash;a
letter not for transmission.</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Lady Melbourne:<br>
<br>
"I return you the plan of A's spouse-elect, of which I shall say
nothing because I do not understand it. I daresay it is exactly
what it ought to be. I would rather have seen your answer. She
seems to have been spoiled, not as children are, but systematically
Clarissa-Harlowed into an awkward kind of correctness which will or
may lead her into some egregious blunder. I don't mean the usual
error of young gentlewomen, but she will find exactly what she
wants and then discover that it is much more dignified than
entertaining."</p>

<p>That strain and the many details of his various gallantries
opened to Lady Melbourne (who indeed was encouraging him in a fresh
pursuit to deflect his mind from matters which alarmed even her
easy judgment) might have saved both Byron and Anne Milbanke if
they could have reached her. For Lady Melbourne, whom he had
believed no avowal could wound or shock, had startled him by her
reply to his intimation of a flight to Sicily. Suddenly becoming a
sibyl, she warned him against "that fatal step. You are on the
brink of a precipice, and if you do not retreat you are lost for
ever&mdash;it is a crime for which there is no salvation in this world,
whatever there may be in the next," and though she relapsed into
the woman of the world farther down the page, she left him uneasy,
alarmed. If <i>she</i> could halt, he had gone too far indeed. His
thought recurred feverishly to the redemption of marriage.</p>

<p>Anne, encouraged alike by silence and information, wrote now
directly to him. Carefully guarded letters&mdash;to what could they
commit her? She knew nothing of the real life underlying his
equally guarded replies.</p>

<p>"I have heard from A," he wrote to his old confidante, "but her
tone is melancholy. I wonder who will have her at last. Her letter
to you is gay, you say. That to me must have been written about the
same time. The little demure non-juror!"</p>

<p>Not a touch, not a trace of feeling must be shown to Lady
Melbourne. The bird must alight on his hand before he would make
the motion of a caress&mdash;and it was hovering above him now. They
should never have it to say he had been refused twice. But he knew
very well she never would have written but for some deep and
abiding interest in her heart.</p>

<p>So he wrote lightly of the affair to her aunt, dwelling much on
his perilous flirtation with Lady Frances Webster; that episode
abounds in the bitter Byronic touch in dealing with women. "She
managed to give me a note and receive another and a ring before
Webster's very face, and yet she is a thorough devotee and takes
prayers morning and evening, besides being measured for a new Bible
once a quarter."</p>

<p>There is indeed material for a dozen dramas in this strange
correspondence. Not the least bewildering feature is the strange
old woman who received his confidences, digested, savoured them,
and still destined him for her niece&mdash;a girl strangely sensitive
for her time and class upon the very subjects of his mockeries.
What was her reason? One may partly guess the cold indifference
which the morals of the period inspired in a woman who saw intrigue
everywhere about her, whose own name had not escaped, who took that
strain for granted in every man and woman she met until the reverse
was indisputable. And even then&mdash;might not the explanation, after
all, be hypocrisy?</p>

<p>Besides, the Byronic malice and mockeries amused her immensely.
They were cayenne and vinegar to a jaded palate, and not only that,
but a flattery she could not put aside. What other old woman could
win the constant correspondence of the most brilliant and courted
man in Europe? No, she must have her amusement, and Caroline's
scandal be kept in the family, and Anne must look out for
herself.</p>

<p>The letters from him to Anne increased in length and number. She
replied now with eagerness. She grew surer and more sure of his
heart. The world became more beautiful about her, beautiful with
tender hopes and terrors locked in her own breast&mdash;daring now to
warm the paper she wrote on with a faint virginal flush of feeling
still cold and shy, but with the thrill of spring's own blood
within it.</p>

<p class="letter">"A very pretty letter" (he writes). "What an odd
situation and friendship is ours, without a spark of love on either
side. She is a very superior woman and very little spoiled, which
is strange in an heiress&mdash;a girl of twenty, a peeress to be in her
own right, an only child, and a 'savante' who has always had her
own way. She is a poetess, a mathematician, a metaphysician, and
yet withal, very kind, generous and gentle, with very little
pretension. Any other head would be turned with a half of her
acquisitions and a tenth of her advantages."</p>

<p>This letter (not to Lady Melbourne) is a strange catalogue for a
man who had no love for the woman he commended. Yet it was true he
had none&mdash;nothing but an immense pride in the shining captive, and
from that angle she grew dearer to him daily. All the interests,
all the hopes, were converging in that direction once more. For the
moment Caroline had subsided into exhaustion, and it appeared that
the way was clear.</p>

<p>He dreamed his dream more passionately as from all sides her
sounded praises reached him. Her brilliant intellect, her keen
critical instinct&mdash;Lady Melbourne had enclosed for his reading part
of a letter, in which, praising his "Lara," she gave the reasons
for her praise in clear nervous English which would have evoked his
admiration if Hobhouse or Murray had been the critic. What thoughts
to lie behind the delicate flush of a girl's colour, the clear,
candid blue of eyes which fell so sweetly before his own. He had
detested clever women heretofore, but this one was tamed by love.
She would be no judge, but an adorer. She supplemented his opinions
with delicate touches that drew them out. Here was a wife whose
worship would exalt her husband. And though he understood from Lady
Melbourne that there would be no large fortune at present, her
ultimate expectations were splendid, and the peerage she must
inherit gave her exactly the dignity which suited his ideal of her.
He could appreciate that; the money was nothing to him in
comparison; he really did not give it a thought.</p>

<p>And she had refused so many men beside himself&mdash;that was common
talk in society. Miss Milbanke was fastidious indeed! It added zest
to his pursuit, and what was there to hinder it?</p>

<p>Nothing. But everything. That voice in his heart he stifled for
the present, blind and deaf to all but the immediate desire. If
once or twice he wavered, his old recklessness urged him on. If
Lady Melbourne saw no hindrance, was it for him to draw back?
To-day was his. Let the morrow take heed for itself.</p>

<p>So, at last, the paths, slowly converging, met after two long
years&mdash;of sorrow to her, of irremediable loss to him. He wrote her
a letter offering himself once more, longing, hoping, trembling,
not with love, but with longing for the deliverance that she might
bring; that had come to have an almost superstitious value in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"A beautiful letter," she called it, and such no doubt it was.
No hand could give it more beauty, and he knew her heart.</p>

<p>And she, in a terror of delight and fear, lest anything should
happen again to snatch the golden cup from her lips before she had
tasted the wine of Paradise, wrote him not only her glad acceptance
but sent it in duplicate lest it should fail to catch him at one or
other of his addresses and keep him one unnecessary moment in
suspense.</p>

<p>A girl's folly&mdash;too soon to be avenged.</p>

<p>Byron was at dinner when the acceptance was handed to him&mdash;at
Newstead. He broke into a loud laugh of delight and triumph. He had
won; his two years' waiting was repaid with victory. She was
his.</p>

<p>With the weird prescience of fate forever at his shoulder,
entered at that moment the old gardener, to restore his mother's
lost wedding ring, lost years before in the garden, and now
rediscovered in digging in time for the new hope&mdash;"Mad Jack
Byron's" worst gift to the woman he had never loved or respected,
the token of a most miserable marriage.</p>

<p>"I will be married with this very ring," cried her son, daring
the Fates as he had dared them often before, but this time once too
often.</p>

<p>Yet, would it have been possible for him or any to believe that
one woman was to avenge the wrongs of her sex upon him, and that
the woman who loved him most tenderly and truly of them all?</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER 11. SUCCESS</h2>

<p class="poem">"Raise me a dais of silk and down,<br>
Hang it with vair and purple dyes.<br>
Carve it in doves and pomegranates<br>
And peacocks with a hundred eyes.<br>
Work it in gold and silver grapes,<br>
In leaves and silver fleur-de-lys,<br>
Because the birthday of my life<br>
Is come. My love is come to me."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Christina Rossetti.</p>

<p>Byron was full of exultation he could not hide, however he might
wish to take his success as a matter of course. He had won in the
game of two years. The bird was in his hand, the quick heart
throbbing against his fingers. His pleasure brimmed and ran over.
He realized then what the strain of suspense had been.</p>

<p>This ended, he must return to the consideration of new
conditions and all that is involved in marriage. His health was the
first important matter. He knew he had been lax there and had
departed from his stoic rule; as he put it to himself, he was
distempered with free living and was now at the freezing point of
returning soberness. In addition to other distractions, he had been
far too free with brandy in Moore's and Sheridan's good company
(not to mention some others less reputable) and it was clear to him
that this was the opportunity for a fresh and determined start
toward the Land of Promise.</p>

<p>There were other steadying considerations as well. The Newstead
sale had fallen through and there was no likelihood of another in
prospect. True, the would-be purchaser was so far bound that he was
compelled to pay a fine of £25,000, but that would settle his most
pressing debts and no more. The fact that Anne was a prospective
heiress had really not influenced him, but it became a matter of
more importance now, especially as no one, including himself, could
accuse him of any mercenary designs. He hoped the time would soon
come for a clear understanding on the point.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he triumphed. To his friends of the great world,
especially the women, he wrote of it with levity, intended to
conceal the real exultation beneath. One letter may serve as the
sample of many:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Lady:<br>
<br>
"Your recollection and invitation do me great honour, but I am
going to be married and can't come. Miss Milbanke is the
good-natured person who has undertaken me, and of course I am very
much in love and as silly as all single gentlemen must be in that
sentimental situation. When the event will take place I don't
exactly know. It depends partly upon lawyers, who are never in a
hurry. She is niece to Lady Melbourne and cousin to Lady Cowper and
others of your acquaintance, and has no fault except being a great
deal too good for me, and that I must pardon, if nobody else
should. It might have been two years ago, and, if it had, would
have saved me a world of trouble. She has employed the interval in
refusing about half a dozen of my particular friends (as she did me
once, by the way) and has taken me at last, for which I am very
much obliged to her. I wish it was well over for I do hate bustle.
And then I must not marry in a black coat, they tell me, and I
can't bear a blue one. Pray forgive me for scribbling all this
nonsense. You know I must be serious all the rest of my life and
this is a parting piece of buffoonery."</p>

<p>Our friends shall know that the lady is so great a prize that
she can pick and choose; that she could, from her virginal heights,
disdain even ourselves, though later Love was lord of all and led
the fair Inviolate captive! Thus is our consequence enhanced in the
eyes of great ladies who themselves have wooed in vain.</p>

<p>His letter to Lady Melbourne, however, demanded very serious
consideration. There could be neither triumph nor bluff in that
quarter. He had made her privy to many of the innermost facts of
his life, and, though she was still his friend, there was that
about her which suggested a heart not likely to lead her into any
weaknesses which reason might condemn. True, she had known these
facts and still countenanced his courtship, but marriage is a
serious matter, and supposing certain facts were to reach the ears
of Anne Milbanke's parents, how far would Lady Melbourne's liking
shield him? Which side would she take?</p>

<p>He knew also that he had been madly, frightfully imprudent in
his confidences to three or four women, though for their own sakes
he was sure they would not dare to attack him&mdash;he, radiant in the
world's eyes, the most famous poet living, the fortunate husband of
the fortunate Miss Milbanke and allied through her to the powerful
Melbourne clan and other great houses of scarcely less consequence.
No, there was little risk. Lady Melbourne was his preoccupation.
Would she now remember, and if so, in what spirit? He wrote with a
most unwonted gravity and anxiety to the terrible old lady who held
so much undesirable knowledge in her hands:</p>

<p class="letter">"My dear Lady Melbourne:<br>
<br>
"Miss Milbanke has accepted me, and her answer was accompanied by a
very kind letter from your brother. May I hope for your consent
too? Without it I should be unhappy, even were it not for many
reasons important in other points of view; and with it I shall have
nothing to require, except your good wishes now and your friendship
always. Of course I mean to reform most thoroughly and become 'a
good man and true.' Seriously, I will endeavour to make your niece
happy. Of my deportment you may reasonably doubt; of her merits you
can have none. As to A. you cannot think higher of her than I do. I
never doubted anything but that she would have me. After all, it is
a match of your making, and better had it been if <i>your</i>
proposal had been accepted at the time. I am quite horrified in
casting up my moral accounts of the two intervening years, all of
which would have been prevented had she&mdash;But I can't blame her, and
there is time yet to do very well. My pride (which my schoolmaster
said was my ruling passion) has in all events been spared. She is
the only woman to whom I ever proposed in that way and it is
something to have got the affirmative at last. I wish one or two of
one's idols had said 'No' instead, however, all that is over. I
suppose a married man never gets any one else, does he? I only ask
for information."</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne must certainly be made to feel her
responsibility, and clearly&mdash;although he knew instinctively that
the alarming old lady was one upon whom it would not sit heavily if
things went wrong. That was not in her nature. Meanwhile he must
hope that when the news reached Caroline it would not produce some
horrible explosion which might alarm Bell's people (for so he now
called her) into retreat. For herself, she had heard the worst that
Caroline could say and her love had survived it.</p>

<p>At the beginning of December Tom Moore returned to London, to be
thrown at once into his usual intimate companionship with Byron.
Besides a good deal of talkative friendship, he had the chirruping
curiosity of the brighteyed little sparrow he was, and as his
pretty literary graces gave him the <i>entrée</i> where he desired
it, he waited for no invitation, but walked straight and
unannounced into Byron's rooms.</p>

<p>He found him alone, his feet propped on a chair, much hipped by
a night of joviality with gay friends at Watier's, and was greeted
with a groan.</p>

<p>"Welcome as ever, Tom, but you behold a wreck. I nearly killed
myself with a collar of brawn I swallowed for supper and have
<i>indigested</i> ever since. What miserable beasts we be when a
crumb of hog can send us spinning off our orbit into the cold outer
spaces of frozen despair! But sit down. I have triumphs for you,
success in the lists of love&mdash;what not?"</p>

<p>"Rehearse. But remember I am cloyed with amatory triumphs. Give
me a repulse for a change."</p>

<p>He stood pulling off his roquelaure, a gay twinkle in his eyes.
Repulse the young Apollo? The only two nymphs who ever resented his
advances, Daphne and Cassandra, both came to the bad ends they
deserved! Moore's morals were those of a man of the world he lived
in, neither better nor worse.</p>

<p>"What's in the wind?" he added.</p>

<p>"Marriage," said Byron.</p>

<p>"Damme!" ejaculated Moore, and sat down abruptly.</p>

<p>"No, no, damn <i>me</i>. 'Tis I am to be damned in a fair wife.
But, on the whole, Moore, I demand your congratulations. There's
brandy by you; let's drink her health to your own verse, which hits
the situation exactly&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"'Here's to her who long<br>
Hath waked the poet's sigh,<br>
The girl who gave to song<br>
What gold could never buy!'</p>

<p>"Here's to Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;" He stopped with sparkling eyes,
tantalizing the victim of curiosity.</p>

<p>Moore drank mechanically and set down the glass.</p>

<p>"'Miss?' But I thought every one of them was a Mrs. or a Lady!
Who in the name of Eros is she? And is it true or a bam?"</p>

<p>"Well, this is friendly! Yes, true. I am going to be
married&mdash;that is, I am accepted, and one usually hopes the rest
will follow. My mother of the Gracchi (that <i>are</i> to be)
<i>you</i> will think too straitlaced for me, although the paragon
of only children and invested with the golden opinions of all sorts
of men and as 'full of most blest conditions' as Desdemona herself.
Miss Milbanke is the lady, and I have her father's invitation to
proceed there in my elect capacity&mdash;which, however, I cannot do
until I have settled some business in London and got a blue
coat."</p>

<p>"Miss Milbanke! Lord, the heiress?"</p>

<p>"She's said to be an heiress, but of that I really know nothing
and shall not ask. But you won't deny her judgment after having
refused six suitors and taken me. And even for me she was the
Unattainable two years ago."</p>

<p>"Lord!" repeated Moore.</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>"But isn't the family somewhat straitlaced and fastidious,
Byron? And isn't the lady herself a model of all the talents, and
haven't you always detested an <i>esprit</i> in petticoats? I
declare, my head's so confused with all this that 'tis more like a
spinning top than a human brain! No, don't drink any more, and I
refuse another drop. Explain, expound."</p>

<p>"My dear Tom, the brawn has reduced me to that condition that
there is no expounding left in me. Certainly, Miss Milbanke has
talents and excellent qualities&mdash;am I to find fault with that?
Naturally, her family will expect a man of decent life: so far as I
am aware, they make no demand for a saint or ascetic. If they did,
they would not get him. But, personally, I've had my fill of vice,
which is as dull as virtue when you get an overdose. I shall reform
thoroughly and seriously."</p>

<p>Up went Moore's humorous eyebrows to the very roots of his hair,
his eyes twinkled beneath them, his silence was eloquent.</p>

<p>"I really sometimes think you are a fool, Moore," Byron growled
irritably. "Cannot you see that a man in my position has other fish
to fry than running eternally after women who are always
manoeuvring to be caught? Running, indeed! It's I who am eternally
being ravished and abducted. Since Helen of Troy no one has been so
perpetually abducted as poor me, and I grow sick of it. Miss
Milbanke is the only woman who has ever given me the trouble of
walking a step after her, and I value her none the less for my
chase of two years. Besides, I want my real life. All this
poetizing and publishing were very well for a young man. It has
amused me and I achieved what I intended, a place in the front
rank. But I want my real life now, a great house in years to come
and men and women of my own class about me and my proper place as a
peer of the realm."</p>

<p>"A law-giver. O Lord!" interjected Moore again.</p>

<p>Byron was seriously annoyed.</p>

<p>"I wish you would dry up with your 'O Lords!' And why, may I
ask, should I not assume the proper duties of nry position as well
as another? And with a wife of talent and birth beside me? I have
made mistakes, but they can be retrieved."</p>

<p>Moore hastened to apologize.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, my dear Byron. Of course you can always achieve
what you will&mdash;I never doubted that. But you will own, this
contrasts oddly with your denunciations of all government, your
views on religion, family relations&mdash;in short, what shall I call
it?&mdash;your revolutionary attitude to life."</p>

<p>Byron was furious.</p>

<p>"And may not a man purge and live cleanly? One would think I was
a dotard in hoary iniquity instead of a man in his twenties! Not
that I regret my experiences&mdash;why should I? Love, as I have known
it, is a coarse folly. The contrast will lend the greater zest to
the calm and trustfulness of married life. My memories will form a
<i>sauce piquante</i> to the very different pleasures I
anticipate."</p>

<p>"Lord!" said Moore, open-mouthed, and immediately ducked to
avoid the book Byron hurled at him.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;buzzard!&mdash;cannot you see that I have gone bankrupt on
vice? I have been a spendthrift&mdash;I have exhausted all my interest
in it. It takes virtue and vice to balance each other, and you can
enjoy neither without its opposite. Could I enjoy my bride's
company if I had not known the reverse? Could I enjoy the
reverse&mdash;"</p>

<p>He pulled his words up on their haunches. Moore was silent; his
thoughts at the moment were not for publication. There was a pause.
Presently Byron resumed in plaintive tones:</p>

<p>"It's damned hard on a man. I did wish to see you and have your
personal congratulations&mdash;if a man with a liver like mine is worth
congratulating!"</p>

<p>Moore made them in due form, but with a slight hesitation which
he intended should be noticed, as it was.</p>

<p>"I see I have not the hearty approval of the Reverend Thomas.
Speak out, my ghostly adviser, and be sure that any gloomy
anticipations will meet with respectful consideration to-day. I see
the whole world, including the holy estate of matrimony, as black
as your boot, in spite of all my trumpeting. Give me your honest
views."</p>

<p>Moore temporized still, and at last cautiously advanced a
doubt.</p>

<p>"My dear Byron, I'm a married man myself, and have cause to
speak well of marriage, but I own to a foreboding anxiety. Your
temperament&mdash;indeed, I might say the temperament of genius, appears
to render it a doubtful experiment for wife as well as
husband."</p>

<p>"Preach! I hear," Byron said languidly. "But you can scarcely
expect me to allow I am a genius. I may be vain&mdash;I am&mdash;but there
are Alps of vanity which I have not yet climbed."</p>

<p>"We will take the world's word for it. But have you never
observed in the history of genius that what wins admiration seldom
holds love?"</p>

<p>Byron was piqued at once.</p>

<p>"Perhaps on love I may suppose myself something of an authority.
I can't say, genius or no, that I have found hearts difficult to
win."</p>

<p>"To keep, was my proposition. Consider your longlasting moods of
abstraction. You must own how often you have told me that you are
really happier in your study, with your books about you when the
spirit moves you, than in company with the most charming woman in
the world. Surely that has a detaching tendency? A wife must feel
it. And I should judge that an only daughter, accustomed to
adoration from parents and relatives, might feel it painfully. I
know you are fond of 'banqueting your own thoughts,' and it was
this solitary luxury which led your favourite, Pope, to prefer his
silent library to the gayest talk. Have you considered this?"</p>

<p>"My dear Moore, I take your warning as it is meant; but have you
considered how the world draws me? I am like the picture of
Garrick, pulled one way by Comedy, the other by Tragedy. Let us
hope my Bell may be comedy! I think myself as ready for a frolic as
any man."</p>

<p>"True. And yet&mdash;you have moods that drive you. And again, is not
the man of genius unduly fastidious about the attainments of
others? Is not the constant society of those less gifted than
themselves often a burden? You remember (for you read him) who
says, 'Nothing is so tiresome as to converse with people who have
not the same information as oneself.'"</p>

<p>"True also. But you forget I am marrying a philosopher. I used
to call her the Princess of Parallelograms to Lady Melbourne. There
is no subject I can start but Bell is ready with her opinion."</p>

<p>"If your sentiments coincide&mdash;" Moore began doubtfully. "But did
you not always quote Pope and say the ideal woman should have no
character whatever&mdash;simply a mirror to reflect her husband, not
understanding him, but feeling with him? Of course, conjugal
affection&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, sentiment be damned! And what can be duller than
agreement&mdash;nothing to argue, nothing to debate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think that advantage will not be lacking in your company,"
Moore said seriously.</p>

<p>"And my sentiments, such as they are, make for sensibility and
tenderness of heart. I can't see a bird in a cage without
compassion, and I vowed that the first bird I shot (a young eagle,
by the way) should be the last, so pathetic to me was its bright
dying eye, the suffering of its wound, the extinction of its
glorious energy of flight."</p>

<p>"I think history tells us that that sort of sensibility may go
hand in hand with a certain hardness. Recall your own words about
Sterne: he preferred whining over a dead ass to relieving a living
mother. Milton's first wife ran away from him, disgusted with his
hard study, and Dante occupied himself so deeply with the ideal
perfections of his Beatrice that he deserted his lawful wife and
children that he might muse upon them in peace."</p>

<p>"If you croak thus, I shall hurl Johnson's Dictionary again at
your head! Am I not sufficiently frightened that you must provoke
me into terror? What have I to do with ideals, I who know women as
they are? Talk of something more cheerful. The combination of
marriage with indigestion is too frightful a burden. I'm sorry I
ever spoke of it."</p>

<p>But Moore was carried away by his thesis.</p>

<p>"I am well aware of Miss Milbanke's merits. Report is not
silent. But you are a great man, and I see in you a restless and
solitary spirit, wrapped in its own thoughts like a silk-worm in
its cocoon, seeking the society of others and the distractions of
women's charms only as food for the purpose which drives you. I
quote your beloved Pope once more: 'To follow poetry as one ought,
one must forget father and mother and cleave to it alone.' No, my
friend, you don't grasp the wonders of your own mind. You may yet
feel the imperative call to sacrifice not only yourself, but all
your domestic ties to the necessity for freedom."</p>

<p>The little man was blown on a wind of prophecy. He had not meant
to say so much, it had spoken itself. Byron looked at this unwonted
counsellor with melancholy.</p>

<p>"It was a bad freedom," he said. "The freedom to seek the
precipice, to skirt the abyss&mdash;the <i>abyss!</i> Need I regret
it?"</p>

<p>"It was <i>freedom</i>" Moore answered emphatically. Then
pausing, and in a different tone: "Well, I have issued my warning
and you will not heed it. Who ever did? But do not forget your old
friend however the dice turn up. You have not a genius for
friendship; we might not have been the friends we are if we had met
perpetually, for I have observed you are the most attached to those
friends you seldom see&mdash;it is easier, they are less likely to vex
you and the novelty is always fresh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By God, that's true!" Byron interrupted. "How you know me,
Moore! I will be candid. That's my own fear about marriage. The
monotony. The same face, the same voice, the same opinions. Can I
stand it? You voice my own alarms&mdash;no, no, this is folly! The thing
has gone too far, and what a man resolves he can do. Marriage means
much more than the confounded companionship. It means interests
proper to my place. As to poetry, I have told you I am not really
a literary man&mdash;that is only an odd excrescence which I shall not
encourage after my marriage. Dedicate my life to it? Not I! And now
tell me, what have you been doing, and answer the riddle why, if
you can be so happy with your Bessy, I am not to be with my
Bell?"</p>

<p>"I am no genius," Moore said soberly. "I hoped it once, but
never pretended it. You and I know better. Now, pack clouds away,
and tell me with how much gold the bride's white hands are laden
and when the marriage is to be."</p>

<p>But Moore's words were destined to hover about Byron like birds
of ill omen. It was his own fear looking him in the eyes. None knew
better than he the sad satiety which overtook him so often in the
glamour of the brightest eyes, the warmth of rose-red lips. There
were moments when he hated them, and these moments grew more
frequent as time went by. And there was more, much more. The
passion that had absorbed him for the past two years (for the
others were but an iridescence on the surface) had a mixture of the
terrible (so he wrote to Lady Melbourne) which rendered all others
insipid. Its effects had been like the habit of Mithridates, who,
by using himself to poison of the strongest kind, at last rendered
all others ineffectual when he sought them as a remedy for his
evils and a release from existence. That was the fact which, even
in the midst of his triumph as an accepted lover, raised a Medusa
head, writhing with snakes, and stared at him with eyes that froze
him to stone. He could forget, he could stifle it still, but
sometimes, in the dark deep and horror of the night, the thought
would rise before him: How if the time should come when he could
not forget, when every thought would be that and that only?
Ghastly! It would make the Greek myth of the Furies terrifically
true: a wretched soul fleeing, fleeing always, never daring to look
behind lest it should behold the pursuing Terror, but with no
refuge before it&mdash;none in all the hells.</p>

<p>He called for brandy&mdash;"the only remedy for the liver and
preachments"&mdash;and drank with Moore until a warm glow pervaded him,
and Destiny was less the blind, pursuing goddess than the fairy
godmother who had provided beauty, birth, genius, good luck, all
the coloured stars at his birth, and would do so to the end. He had
not taken to laudanum with his brandy, as Caroline Lamb was to do
later, and he was certain that he could dispense with it whenever
he pleased, but meanwhile it was comforting in emergencies.</p>

<p>So the great day approached. Anne had not ventured up to London.
She was better out of Caroline's sphere, and if Caroline was
moodily silent, so best, he reflected.</p>

<p>Anne's own heart sang like a lark in the blue abysses of
sunshine. She had never imagined that such happiness was possible.
His letters&mdash;for it was judged best he should await the end of the
lawyers' work before coming to Seaham Hall (where they were at
present, Halnaby being reserved for the honeymoon)&mdash;were the
letters of a sensitive, intellectual girl's realized hopes. Who
could write, could feel like this prince of men&mdash;her own,
immortally her own! When his great name was handed down in the
annals of England, as it must surely be, the sun of poets, the
glorious Apollo, hers would be linked with it, a little, shining
satellite travelling on that vast orbit. What had she ever done to
deserve this crown of honour? Nothing but love him. But that&mdash;if
she could believe his letters&mdash;was all in all to him. Love is
enough.</p>

<p>And now the days were flying like bright birds to the day of
days. He was coming. Would he look the same as when she had last
seen him&mdash;so beautiful that all eyes turned to him naturally and
could fix on no other? But, more important (for whatever he was,
she must love him), what would he think of her? Could she still
hope to please him? Impossible to write the thoughts which must
fill such a girl's mind in such a case, with such a lover.</p>

<p>He came, not well, harassed, Moore's words hovering about him
(though that she could not know), paler than usual and overflowing
with quick, nervous talk and laughter. She did her best, but
something indefinable startled her, silenced her. After all, could
any one hope for absolute perfection of joy? If one held the sun in
one's hand, must one ask the moon also?</p>

<p>Her father liked him. Lady Milbanke was favourably impressed,
though she did her best to hide it. That again was not wonderful.
It must be a Prince Paragon indeed who carries away an only
daughter uncriticized. But there was somehow an air of suspense, of
discomfort in the house. It might only be the suspense and
inevitable discomfort of impending change, and, quick as a
sensitive plant to shrink, brushed even by a breath, Byron feared,
and locked himself into his room to write his fears to Lady
Melbourne.</p>

<p class="letter">"She seems to have more feeling than we imagined,
but is the most silent woman I ever encountered, which perplexes me
extremely. I like them to talk, because then they <i>think</i>
less. I am studying her. However, the die is cast; neither party
can recede. I shall become Lord Annabella! I can't tell yet whether
we are to be happy or not. I have every disposition to do her all
possible justice, but I fear she won't govern me, and if she don't
it won't do at all."</p>

<p>SUCCESS 173</p>

<p>And later he added:</p>

<p class="letter">"My least word or alteration of tone has some
inference drawn from it. Sometimes we are too much alike, and then
again too unlike. For my part, I have lately had recourse to the
eloquence of <i>action</i> and find it succeeds very well and makes
her very quiet. In fact, <i>entre nous</i>, it is really amusing:
she is like a child in that respect and quite caressable into
kindness and good humour, though I don't think her temper bad at
any time, but very self-tormenting and anxious and romantic."</p>

<p>Perhaps, if he had cared to consider, there had been enough to
make her all three, she who had lived through Caroline's frenzies,
who had heard rumours more than he could guess. This bride embarked
on her marriage voyage with a chart marked heavily with dangers.
Indeed, a word, a look, alarmed her.</p>

<p>Yes, those were the happiest moments of her life when she sat
embraced by his arm, her cheek pressed against his and sometimes a
soft kiss like a butterfly dropped on her lips and hair. Then she
could be sure he loved her, could rest in the assurance. When he
spoke, she could not tell why, but it made her heart beat and
shattered the serenity of assurance in her soul. His
voice&mdash;something in the tone, possibly some deep
melancholy&mdash;troubled her. She could understand neither herself nor
him, was only certain she wished they might sit for ever in that
quiet room with the cold moon shining on the wintry trees outside,
their shadows ebon on the snow, the firelight filling the room with
the fire and shadow of a jewel, his cheek against hers, silent, no
words spoken, at peace, peace together at last.</p>

<p>At peace? No. Even then cruel doubts haunted her. His strange,
unequal manner, silences, hesitations&mdash;could there be anything she
should know&mdash;anything between them which he longed, yet dreaded to
confess? Could she make things easier for him, even if it cost her
all her joy? She could risk her own happiness, but never his.</p>

<p>They were sitting together, the evening before the wedding, when
at last she gathered courage to speak. Outside was the breathless
stillness of a midwinter night, when the white trees stand
phantasmal in ghostly moonlight, the chill air frozen into dead
silence. Suspense, mystery, hovered in the silver silences. On
Apollo's lips she had tasted the sweetness of love itself. The very
rapture gave her strength. She drew his arm about her, laid her
head on his breast, clasped his other hand in hers and spoke with a
most disabling fear, but firmly.</p>

<p>"Byron, your manner sometimes perplexes me, and I can't tell
why. When most I long for certainty, I doubt&mdash;not myself, oh,
never, never that!&mdash;but&mdash;may I ask you a question?"</p>

<p>At once he disengaged himself and drew apart. He got up and
stood with one arm on the mantelpiece. She rose also and stood
behind her chair, her hand resting upon it, looking up at him with
the calm, sincere gaze, limpid as a child's, which yet, unlike a
child's, might conceal such grief. He looked back with a would-be
defiance, an entire refusal of confidence.</p>

<p>"Surely you can ask anything you wish. Who has a better
right?"</p>

<p>"Then that gives me courage. I think, I sometimes think, from
your manner that you have no real love for me. You may believe you
have&mdash;surely we should never have been as we are if you had not
believed it?&mdash;but, are you <i>sure?</i>"</p>

<p>Silence. She went on hurriedly, seeing that he grew paler and
paler as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I want you to understand that&mdash;if you are not sure&mdash;if you wish
to dissolve our engagement&mdash;I shall never blame you, even in my
heart of hearts. I will be your friend always. I will permit no
one to blame you. So now, assuring you of this, I beg you to tell
me the truth for both our sakes. I could bear it now. I could never
bear it after our marriage. I entreat you. Do you truly wish to
marry me? Is there anything on your mind that stands between us?
Sometimes I have thought that."</p>

<p>She looked down then at her hand, at the beautiful ring he had
given her in token of their betrothal, and began to draw it slowly
from her finger. A great tear, bright as a jewel, gathered on her
long lashes and fell upon the stone. She dashed it away and drew
the ring off, holding it out to him with head averted.</p>

<p>A deep, broken sigh caught her ear. She looked swiftly round and
to her horror and amazement saw that the colour had dropped away
even from his lips and he was clutching his chair for support as if
the world itself were reeling from him.</p>

<p>In great alarm she caught at him and he fell into the chair in a
dead faint.</p>

<p>She had never seen such a sight before and rushed, calling for
help, for water, wine&mdash;fearing he was dead and she had killed him.
Self-accusation almost overwhelmed her. He loved her, had loved her
for two patient years, and this was her return for his
devotion&mdash;doubt, mistrust! The miserable weakling that she had
been! When he opened heavy eyes to find her kneeling beside him,
half distracted, he should hear nothing but entreaties for
forgiveness!</p>

<p>"And then," as she said long afterwards, "I was <i>sure</i> he
must love me."</p>

<p>After that one brief struggle, Fate worked her will.</p>

<p>The marriage took place in the great drawing-room at Seaham.
Hobhouse, who was present, has his story to tell.</p>

<p>"Miss Milbanke seemed dotingly fond. Byron appears to love her
personally when in her company. My Lady, pettish and tiresome, but
clever. Miss Milbanke, dressed in a muslin gown trimmed with lace,
with nothing on her head, was quite composed, and during the whole
ceremony looked steadily at Byron. Byron, when he came to the
words, 'With all my worldly goods I thee endow,' looked at me with
a half smile."</p>

<p>Hobhouse handed my Lady Byron into the carriage for the
honeymoon trip to Halnaby and congratulated her once more.</p>

<p>The girl looked up in his face.</p>

<p>"If I am not happy it will be my own fault," she said.</p>

<p>How otherwise? She had won the world's prize.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER 12. MARRIAGE</h2>

<p class="poem">"How then should sound upon the darkening slope<br>
The ground-whirl of the perished leaves of Hope,<br>
The wind of death's imperishable wing!"<br>
<br>
&mdash;Dante Rossetti.</p>

<p>When the young bride stepped into that carriage, she stepped
into a misery so strange and terrifying that it has remained a
perplexity until a very few years ago. Partly owing to her devoted
love for her husband, partly to her evident inability to comprehend
the immense misfortune that had befallen her, even she herself
cannot, to lookers on, make very clear the history of the ruin
which overtook them both.</p>

<p>The carriage door was shut upon their happiness and the long
avenue of Seaham Hall was unrolling behind them, the welcome of the
Halnaby tenants before them. She seemed to herself to move between
two worlds, belonging to neither; the one of the past, the other
the glad, untried future. He sat beside her looking out of the
window with a strange, fixed expression which she could not
decipher. She ventured to lay her little hand, with its shining
gold wedding ring, on his&mdash;a small, wifely action of trust,
inviting and beseeching its reward. Did it break some tension of
hard silence in him? Suddenly and furiously he turned upon her.</p>

<p>"You <i>might</i> have saved me once, Madam. You had all in your
power when I offered myself to you first. Then you might have made
me what you pleased. Now you will find you have married a
devil."</p>

<p>The revulsion was so horrible that she flung herself back
against the side of the carriage in an almost hysterical terror,
staring at him with lips apart. What could she have saved him from?
What dreadful thing had taken place in those two unhappy years?
What thought was tearing his heart? She was too confused with
fright for anything but question. He saw her alarm and in a second
the glare, the tone, were gone, he was smiling&mdash;strangely, but
smiling.</p>

<p>"Bell, you little goose, you child! Can't you understand a joke?
A joke, I tell you! I wanted to see how you would look with your
little round face all pale and startled. Very pretty! It suits you.
I believe I shall call you Pippin, round little face!"</p>

<p>He touched it with a shaking finger as if he had meant a caress,
but she could not gather herself together. Some cold chill ran
through her body, colder than any January frost outside that
blurred their breath on the window. She tried for a smile, tried to
speak, faltered and broke down in tears. Natural enough in a bride
leaving a happy home where she had been the centre of all the
joy&mdash;but neither the husband nor wife set it down to that most
obvious cause. They both knew better. A dead silence fell between
them. He picked up a book and sat reading for the rest of the
way.</p>

<p>A welcome had been prepared by the tenants at Halnaby, and a
bride and bridegroom must respond with the expected smiles and
gestures of happiness. That effort she made. When the carriage
stopped, he sprang out and walked moodily away, leaving her to
climb the stately steps alone, smiling and waving her hands in
answer to the acclamations of the kind people who had known her
from a child and must have their share in her bridal joy.</p>

<p>She reached her room too bewildered to think. It was beyond all
comprehension, but whatever she or Byron might say or do now that
one terrible moment in the carriage and the sad journey had opened
a gulf between them. Her faint doubts and girl's fears had been
struck, as by a sudden shock, into a sharp and definite dread.
There was something, something lurking in the dark, awake, alive,
stealthily moving, which he shrank from, defied with a wild
defiance&mdash;she dared not ask even herself what it might be.</p>

<p>And they were alone at Halnaby, but for her faithful maid.
Father, mother, had faded like shadows into the past. There was
Caroline Lamb, nursing her sullen wrath in London. There was Lady
Melbourne, who had pressed and planned their marriage, whom nothing
could shock or alarm. And there were herself and Ityron face to
face at last with the irretrievable. These were the facts she must
face.</p>

<p>Again and again she took herself to task. Of course she was
mistaken, foolish, risking her own and his happiness with these
dangerous doubts. He meant no harm. If he wandered away into the
woods of Halnaby and she sat alone hour after hour with Mrs.
Minns's round, amazed eyes watching her young Ladyship and this
surprising bridegroom, that was only because he was unlike other
men&mdash;and must be. Some beautiful world's wonder of verse would be
the result of those lonely wanderings and ponderings. Surely every
one knew that the wife of a genius must pay her share for her
husband's laurels?</p>

<p>Mrs. Minns was not to be silenced, however. She claimed all the
privileges of a trusted servant.</p>

<p>"Your Ladyship, if you're not happy&mdash;and I have my thoughts on
that&mdash;won't you write and tell your papa? You never kept a thought
from them and this isn't the time to begin, or I'm much mistook.
You're too lonely. 'Tis a thing you was never used to at
home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Minns." She drew herself up in a gallant effort for
the dignity of the married woman. "What should I tell my father? I
have my husband to think of now, and if I were uneasy in any way I
should tell him, not any one else."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lady."</p>

<p>A silence, and Minns burst unaccountably into tears. She loved
her mistress, she dreaded the indeterminate eclipse which shadowed
that waning moon of bliss, and Halnaby had taken on a ghastly
quality it had never known before. The old familiar house seemed
changed.</p>

<p>Things mended, darkened, vacillated, as such things do, but Anne
Byron held bravely on her way. Life is like that. Already she was
asking herself the question of disenchanted middle age: Why should
we expect happiness from life, who experience how little it really
has to give? And she but twenty-two!</p>

<p>Yet she had hopes in Augusta Leigh, his half-sister. She was
known and liked at Melbourne House, and a great favourite with many
of the people who would form her society in London. Easy, amiable,
good-natured, that was the picture she had formed of the woman of
whom he spoke so little. Augusta had written her a kindly letter on
her engagement and Byron had given her, accidentally, a fluffy,
babyish epistle from her a day or two before their marriage, with a
bundle of others. She read it, a little in surprise at such a
childish note in the letter of a married woman of twenty-nine&mdash;it
seemed more like a schoolgirl's.</p>

<p class="letter">"My dearest B.:<br>
<br>
"As usual I have but a short allowance of time to reply to your
<i>tendresses</i>, but a few lines, I know, will be better than
none&mdash;at least <i>I</i> find them so. It was very, very good of you
to think of me amidst all the visitors, etc. I have scarcely
recovered mine of yesterday&mdash;La Dame did talk so&mdash;oh, my stars! But
at least it saved me a world of trouble. Oh, she has found out a
likeness in your picture to Mignonne, who is of course very
good-humoured in consequence. I want to know, dearest B., your
plans-when you go&mdash;umph! When the Cake is to be cut. When the Bells
are to ring, etc., etc. By the bye, my visitors are acquainted with
A. and did praise her to the skies. They say her health has been
hurt by studying, etc. I have not a moment to spare, my dearest,
except to say, Ever thine."</p>

<p>Mignonne, that was the baby of a few months old, Medora her real
name...But the letter encouraged her. No one could be afraid of the
woman who could write it, and no doubt she would understand, would
be able to give valuable hints as to what would please him. At
whose feet would she not sit to learn that secret! His mind is a
labyrinth, she thought despairingly, and I have no way to his
heart. But Augusta's affection for him might be the light she
needed on her perplexed pathway, for he evidently valued it. The
day after their marriage he had shown her the beginning of a letter
from his half-sister&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"Dearest, first and best of human beings,"</p>

<p>with a fierce, exulting pride that startled and mystified her.
Could it be to demonstrate that there were those who could
understand and appreciate him, if his wife could not? But she
could, she did! She redoubled all her cares and tendernesses&mdash;but
to no avail.</p>

<p>One day she came into the library where he stood before the
hearth, staring sullenly into the glowing caverns of fire. He had
not heard her light foot at the door. Something in his face warned
her that she had surprised him, caught him off guard, penetrated
some secret mood. Involuntarily she pulled up short.</p>

<p>"Do I interrupt you, Byron?"</p>

<p>"Damnably."</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her. She fled from the room.</p>

<p>Afterwards Mrs. Minns found her alone, sitting by the great
window in her bedroom, staring out into the frozen stillness of the
park, the leafless trees ranking about the house. Her own face had
a wintry look of stillness upon it&mdash;words locked behind the closed
lips and dulled eyes. The woman came up behind her.</p>

<p>"My dear Ladyship, won't you write to your papa? I'm
frightened&mdash;frightened for you."</p>

<p>Anne put a cold hand on the warm one.</p>

<p>"You're very, very kind, Minns, but there's nothing to be done.
No, I'm not happy. I&mdash;I don't understand. I never thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Then won't your Ladyship come home to Seaham? Let me order the
carriage and it won't be many hours before you're in your own dear
home again with your father and mother that loves you."</p>

<p>To her it was absolutely inconceivable that anything but joy and
honour could befall the only child, the treasure and pride of the
house. Here must be some strange mystery and only her father could
safeguard her. She persisted in her entreaties.</p>

<p>"Then send me back in the carriage and I'll tell her Ladyship
enough so that she'll come to you and bring you back, and then
you'll be safe. I can't stand by and see you like this. No, I
can't."</p>

<p>The touch of sympathy broke down Anne's reserve. She looked at
the woman with wide, woe-stricken eyes.</p>

<p>"I can't tell any one. Perhaps I'm foolish&mdash;this place seems so
strange and lonely now&mdash;I begin to feel as if there were nothing
else, as if all the outside world were dead! But soon it will be
over. In a fortnight, and then we shall go back to Seaham, and
perhaps it will be all right. Promise me, Minns&mdash;give me your
faithful promise that you will never speak of this to any one. I
can't send you back to Seaham. I can't do without you. I would go
back if I could, but that is impossible. So promise!"</p>

<p>Minns promised, and kept her promise for long years, and the
treacle-moon, as Byron called it in his jeering letters, dragged on
to its unhappy close.</p>

<p>It left its mark on her. Hobhouse admitted afterwards in his
"Recollections" that "her Ladyship appeared always dismayed when
she spoke of her residence at Halnaby." She had some reason. Byron
also. There were spectres of the mind which he had thought marriage
would lay for ever, but they watched by him in the dead of night,
walked with him in the long glades of Halnaby and made a ghostly
company about them when he and his wife were alone. It would be
better at Seaham, with other people, and meanwhile he must put a
brave face on it. Everything connected with himself must be a
triumph in the world's eye, and his marriage most of all.</p>

<p>It was easier to write cheerfully when they returned to Seaham,
and thence he wrote to Lady Melbourne (now his aunt):</p>

<p class="letter">"The <i>moon</i> is over, but Bell and I are as
lunatic as heretofore: she does as she likes and don't bore me, and
we may win the Dunmow flitch of bacon for anything I know. Mamma
and Sir Ralph are also very good, but I wish the last would not
speak his speech at the Durham meeting above once a week after its
first delivery."</p>

<p>Another letter in April to Lady Melbourne, informed her that as
a result of Lord Wentworth's will, his estates, entailed on Lady
Milbanke and Anne, "are or may be made nearly £8,000 a year, and
there is a good deal of personality beside, and money and God knows
what, which will come in half to Lady Milbanke now." The Milbankes
were thus obliged to assume the name of Noel, and Byron himself, as
the husband of the heiress, was eventually "Noel Byron."</p>

<p>It cheered him, though the gain to his wife would not be
immediate. He wrote to Moore from Seaham Hall:</p>

<p class="letter">"The treacle-moon is over, and I am awake and
find myself married. My spouse and I agree to&mdash;and in&mdash;admiration.
I still think one ought to marry upon lease, but am very sure I
should renew mine at the expiration, though the next term were for
ninety and nine years. I must go to tea. Damn tea!"</p>

<p>But even in letters appearances were not wholly easy to keep up,
and in February, the month after his marriage, he wrote again to
Moore, and a sentence of ill-omen escaped him:</p>

<p class="letter">"So you won't go abroad then with me&mdash;but alone?
I fully purpose starting much about the time you mention, and
alone, too." And later, in the same letter, alluding to the death
of the Duke of Dorset: "There was a time when this event would have
broken my heart, and all I can say for it now is that&mdash;it is not
worth breaking! Adieu&mdash;it is all a farce."</p>

<p>Moore must have shaken his bird-like but prophetic little head
when he read those sentences. Marriage and genius, the two
incompatibles, had he not known they would never pull together?</p>

<p>But the married pair were on their way to London, staying with
Augusta and her husband at Six Mile Bottom on the way. That strange
visit had its results. The two women liked one another. Anne's
candid eyes studied the good-natured, foolish, easy-going Augusta,
so utterly unlike her half-brother, but with the Byron warp in her
too&mdash;a careless ease about matters which her sister-in-law had been
trained to consider of the most rigid consequence. It was as
impossible to be formal and condemnatory in her company as in that
of a warm Persian tabby purring deliciously by the fire when claws
and feline rages are the last thing to be remembered. She was
expecting her confinement in April, and that circumstance appeared
to make her even more indolently good-humoured and inclined to
settle down to comfortable talks and endless cups of tea. Nothing
was easier than for the bride to slip into confidences with this
sister&mdash;she who had never had a sister of her own nor any close
relation with any woman at all her own age.</p>

<p>Augusta was loud in expressions of satisfaction with the
marriage and of certainty that it would be the most desirable thing
in the world for Byron.</p>

<p>"I certainly think," she said confidentially to Anne, "that his
nerves and spirits now are very far from what they ought to be.
That can't be denied. But you haven't had time yet, my dear, to
work the wonders I foresee. And, of course, his money affairs have
preyed upon him most dreadfully. I hated and hate the thought of
selling Newstead, and yet I almost wish the sale had been completed
when I see how his suspense and poverty have affected him."</p>

<p>"Yes," Anne owned, "that probably explains it all." She blamed
herself that this had not occurred to her. "I'll confess to you,
dear Augusta, that sometimes he has startled me a little. He
<i>is</i> difficult&mdash;peculiar. Sometimes he has seemed to me to
have something mysterious on his mind. It must have been
money."</p>

<p>"Of course it must."</p>

<p>"Oh, how I wish there were no such thing as money&mdash;or that my
share of the Wentworth money were coming to me now!"</p>

<p>"Oh, time enough," Augusta said easily. "Things rub along. I am
very much happier about him since I know you."</p>

<p>She wrote to the same effect to Byron's friend, Hodgson, with
all her facile enthusiasm:</p>

<p class="letter">"Of Lady B. I hardly know how to write, for I
have a sad trick of being struck dumb when I am most happy and
pleased. The expectations I had formed could not be exceeded, but
at least they are fully answered. I think I never saw or heard of a
more perfect human being in mortal mould than she appears to be,
and scarcely dared flatter myself that such a one would fall to the
lot of my dear B. He seems quite sensible of her value."</p>

<p>Was there Augusta's favourite touch of exaggeration, of
plausibility, in her delight? Difficult to say. At all events, she
was determined to be friends, and that spirit made friendship easy
between the women.</p>

<p>Still for Anne there was disappointment. She was not slow to
notice that with all Augusta's indolence she had a strong influence
over her half-brother and that it was not all used for good. Far
from it. But then Augusta had lived so much more in the great world
than she had herself and there they did not set much store on the
stricter side of life and were lax in word and deed. She certainly
permitted more freedoms than she herself had been used to. Anne
wished she would check Byron there. It was one of his faults, and
her laughter or easy rebuke encouraged him. When she knew her
better, she thought, she might perhaps venture a hint. And there
was a lax atmosphere, not only about Augusta, but about the whole
place. She had an influence much stronger than her own&mdash;but then
who could be surprised at that? Hers was such a newcomer in his
life that all she could hope was for its strengthening later.
Meanwhile, she was sure she must not strain it, must not repel him
by any undue Puritanism. That might have been her mistake hitherto.
Accordingly she laughed, or tried to, at many little incidents she
disliked and doubted.</p>

<p>Augusta was so childish, so playful&mdash;how could she ever hope to
imitate that babyish give and take, devoid of all prohibitions and
moralities?</p>

<p>She had no control over her children. Young as they were, they
took their own unquestioning way. As to her husband&mdash;one day Anne
ventured a question.</p>

<p>"You must have dreadful anxieties about money, Augusta dear. Do
you think Colonel Leigh understands how unhappy they make you? You
are so unselfish and always so gay and cheerful that I am sure he
doesn't realize it. Do you ever tell him?"</p>

<p>"My dear, how can I talk to the man? I've never understood the
money matters from the beginning and very soon saw that unless I
meant to lose my wits I must enjoy life as best I could in spite of
them. What is the use of groaning over what can't be mended?
'Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof'&mdash;one can't question
the Bible precept."</p>

<p>"But the children? What will become of them if you take no
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Heaven tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.' That's the Bible,
too. I have always tried to live by the Bible. Lady Holderness
taught me to."</p>

<p>"I don't think that <i>is</i> the Bible. I believe Sterne said
it. But in any case, if one has children&mdash;"</p>

<p>"God will provide. Oh, don't talk of my miseries, Bell, if you
don't want to overwhelm me! How would <i>you</i> like to be married
to Colonel Leigh?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Anne, with perfect candour. "But if I were,
and had children&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would be the dearest, wisest little Solomon that ever cut a
baby in two. My little Mignonne, and would they have divided you to
please two cross cats of women!"</p>

<p>She snatched the baby from Anne and kissed and danced it till
the air rang with her laughter and the child's shrieks of
delight.</p>

<p>"Isn't she delicious?" she said. "How I do love all the soft,
warm, cuddly things of life! To be happy, to make other people
happy, to give them just exactly what they want, that's my
gospel."</p>

<p>"And you live up to it, you dear. I can't imagine you
reproaching anybody with anything&mdash;not even Colonel Leigh.
Still&mdash;if you could hint to Byron that he speaks too freely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear, I never could. That's your place," and she tossed the
child again, laughing her pretty, tinkling laugh, until the nurse
came and carried off the baby. "Thank God, Colonel Leigh's off to
Newmarket to-morrow. There are some mercies at all events to be
thankful for."</p>

<p>It was impossible not to envy such a sunny levity in the face of
what seemed to Anne catastrophe.</p>

<p>They slid into little nicknames. Augusta became Gus, and, by an
inevitable transition, Goose. She really was something of a goose,
the soft-feathered, yielding woman. She talked of joining them in
London about the end of May, and Anne could not make up her mind,
much as she liked (indeed began to love!) Augusta, that hers would
be the most inspiring company in view of the difficulties which
must be faced in London. She knew there would be Caroline and
others to make life complicated. How is a wife to meet her
husband's former mistresses with ease and dignity? And there would
be yet others she would not know of and could only guess or
suspect. Unseen but not unfelt currents of doubt and agitation were
troubling the air about her. What would he wish and expect of her?
How far could she, dared she, yield?</p>

<p>For Augusta had let fall little confidences about Byron's former
attachments. Not that she seemed to think much of them&mdash;rather was
inclined to take such things as a matter of course, though to be
deplored with a glancing word of piety. All that talk stung an old
dread. She would rather not have heard, yet could not shut her
ears. And perhaps knowledge was a safeguard&mdash;who could tell?</p>

<p>Yet in spite of these gathering doubts and disapprovals, a
friendship was concluded between the two women, very much deeper on
Anne's side than on Augusta's&mdash;and with reservations. Much must be
allowed for Augusta's Byron blood, much for her life at Court and
in the world, but when these reservations were made, she still
remained a charming, kind-hearted woman, in all things eager to
befriend the bride and put her experience of her half-brother at
her disposal. That experience would be needed. He grew stranger,
more alarming every day. There were episodes when Augusta was
present which terrified Anne. There was one evening&mdash;no, no, she
would not remember, would not think of it! She must have been
mistaken!</p>

<p>She was glad when they left the easy-going house. It all seemed
a little uncomfortably down-at-heel to the heiress of the Milbankes
and Noels, Augusta herself morally a little down-at-heel also,
though always kindness itself. And there was a matter in which she
must lean on that kindness. She had her hope now of an influence
stronger than any other&mdash;stronger than her own&mdash;to unite her life
with her husband's. A child's hand may lead where a wife's is
nothing.</p>

<p>She needed that hope as a support as life grew more bewildering
daily. Besides all the rest, the money difficulties were a heavy
burden. The Wentworth fortune was not hers in her mother's
lifetime, but since the world persisted in believing otherwise,
Byron's creditors became clamorous. Her parents, in addition to her
small present fortune, had given her £1,000 a year, but that was
little more than the rent of the house he had taken in Piccadilly,
and for Newstead no purchaser had appeared. It was a new and
terrifying experience for her, and as to Byron, he told Hobhouse
his mind with the candour of perfect bitterness and
disillusionment:</p>

<p>"No man should marry. It doubles all his misfortunes and
diminishes his comforts. My wife is perfection itself&mdash;the best
creature breathing. But mind what I say&mdash;don't marry."</p>

<p>So their lives moved onward to the inevitable.</p>

<h2><a name="part3" id="part3"></a>PART 3</h2>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER 13. STORM</h2>

<p class="poem">"I said I would live in all lives that beat and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love in all love that be.<br>
I would crown me lord of the passions. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the passions were lords of me."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Owen Meredith.</p>

<p>It seemed to Anne Byron that grief and fear were her housemates
from the time that London became their home. All the influences she
had foreseen and dreaded clustered thickly about him there and many
were added which her quick intuition warned her were dangerous. A
look was enough to cause her unsleeping fears to spring to arms and
for the first time in her life she knew the tortures of jealousy.
The pain she had endured from the Caroline Lamb episode was as
nothing compared to this hot ache of misery. Then she had no claim
on him. It had been only a shock to her innocence of the world and
to the fairy, fleeting colours of a young girl's ideal. Now he was
her husband, her all, her own, to her the bond most passionately
sacred, and that any woman should dare to intervene or he to
encourage, was as incredible as terrible to her singular
guilelessness. It reduced her to a kind of panic, her heart
fluttered and stopped at the bare thought; for the time it twisted
her very nature awry, until she, who had never a suspicious or
unkind thought of any living soul, lived in an atmosphere of dread
and suspicion which tormented her night and day.</p>

<p>And then he began to boast loudly, openly to her of his
triumphs, with a vanity which she truly believed to be insane. Did
men boast of these things to their wives? It had never been so in
the Noel world nor had she imagined it possible. Names were tossed
freely about, reputations were flung into her hands to deal with as
she dared&mdash;in apparent certainty that she could dare nothing-. A
word involving him would have been impossible to her in any case,
but that such things could be true and he the teller seemed as
impossible. What was to be done? Into what a world had she brought
herself! Could it be only a kind of mad bravado?</p>

<p>Augusta's help seemed the only solution. She understood him and
might possibly help to control him.</p>

<p>He was drinking heavily, too, at Sheridan's, Moore's, Kinnaird's
parties&mdash;Sheridan, sunk now from all his splendour of intellect and
power, a terrible example for a young wife's eyes who had a husband
as brilliant as Sheridan in the days of his glory. She had moments
of distraction when it seemed to her that all the world, men and
women alike, were bent on snatching him from her and embruting his
soul, and that he was leagued against her with them. Her condition,
too, disabled her: it deprived her of the strength to fight her
battle with women at once his prey and scourge.</p>

<p>He had passed altogether beyond her comprehension. Never for one
moment did he attempt to consider her suffering or to lessen the
intolerable strain. In him there was no help. He could do a kind
and generous thing when pity happened to strike him where he was
vulnerable, but never for her. How was it possible that he should
see his wife, the mother of his child to be, desolate and
uncomforted? She could not comprehend his immense selfishness, the
towering egotism, morbid and insane as everything else about him
had come to seem in her eyes. Whoever yielded, as to a sovereign,
he might tolerate: oppose him in the veriest trifle, and anger,
burning often into the red glow of hatred, terrified the
opposer.</p>

<p>She wrote to Augusta, beseeching her to come, and Augusta, ever
ready to desert Six Mile Bottom and its inconveniences, arrived in
the April of 1815, Anne welcoming her with all her heart.</p>

<p>"Augusta, is he mad? What has happened? How can I understand it
all? What do you think? I beseech you to tell me," was her cry at
the end of the confidences she poured out.</p>

<p>"My dear, I am as bewildered as you," was all Augusta would
say. "Can it be drink?"</p>

<p>"Drink? Yes, he drinks too much often, but drink does not make
men loathe the people about them, does it? He hates me with heart
and soul and body."</p>

<p>Augusta put her arms about the shuddering girl and drew her head
to her shoulder.</p>

<p>"No, no. You think these things because you're not well. You're
overstrained. He says them, but he never means them. Put it out of
your head. Think of other things."</p>

<p>She caressed and insisted, would not permit her to shut herself
up, ashamed and afraid to face the world in the morbid agony that
made her flinch.</p>

<p>"He can't be like that when other people are present. Come out
and take your proper place and let him see how others value you.
Men are like that. You won't be afraid&mdash;I am with you."</p>

<p>She went, trembling, clinging to Augusta, depending upon her for
strength to show herself, yet with outward courage to hide the
inward tragedy. A little picture of her in that sad month survives
from the pen of the American, Ticknor, who met her in the great
world of London.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"While I was there, Lady Byron came in. She is
pretty, not beautiful; the prevalent expression of her face is that
of ingenuousness. She is rich in intellectual endowments, possesses
common accomplishments in an uncommon degree and adds to all this a
sweet temper. She is diffident: she is very young, not more, I
think, than nineteen, but is obviously possessed of talent and did
not talk at all for display. She talked upon a considerable variety
of subjects: America, of which she seemed to know considerable; of
France and Greece, with something of her husband's visit there&mdash;and
spoke of all with a justness and a light good humour that would
have struck me in one of whom I had heard nothing. Mrs. Siddons
formed a singular figure by Lady Byron, who sat by her side all
grace and delicacy, and thus showed Mrs. Siddons's masculine powers
in the stronger light of comparison and contrast."</p>

<p>So the little bright picture flashes for a moment, rainbow-like,
on the thunder-clouds and is gone. Could the kind observer but have
known the secret doubt and terror the girl, "all grace and
delicacy," hid under her inflexible courage, he would have
marvelled at the dark decrees of fate.</p>

<p>For Augusta, tenderly protecting her, placing herself as a
shield between the wretched wife and husband, became at times the
deepest dread of all to Anne Byron. There were doubts that she
shook from her with bitter self-condemnation, recurring, vanishing.
Could it be any madness in herself which suggested such thoughts,
such doubts of one she loved, who was her sole comforter in the
darkness? Did women in her condition dream these sick dreams,
involving those most trusted? Had the mad Byron outlook on life
caught her also? The air cleared, she drove them from her, forgot
them. Impossible! Words, looks, incomprehensible otherwise, brought
them back. It became unendurable, and still she endured. That
friendly kindness which shielded her daily, how could any woman
distrust it? It was sheer wickedness to do so, and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>And so her exhausted brain trod the weary round of affirmation
and denial day after day, night after night. The kindness was
there, who could deny it? She must have died without it. But&mdash;what
else was there? What else?</p>

<p>She had no other help. Melbourne House had fallen away from her,
though Byron was constantly there, his friendship with her auat the
excuse. But Caroline was there also, and Caroline held aloof from
her cousin. She had never forgiven the marriage, never come to see
her since, and this made the position intensely difficult for Lady
Melbourne's niece. No, there was no help but Augusta, and
there&mdash;</p>

<p>That way madness lay. She must not think of it. Nor yet of the
ruin of her husband. For, young as she was, Anne Byron knew very
well what his conduct brought daily nearer. He was throwing away
youth, health, beauty, genius, honour, dignity, their child's
future, and more, uncountable in words. Her grief was not selfish,
it was clear-eyed, and the more grievous because, seeing, itwas
helpless. The intellectual woman endures a thousand sufferings in
such a case that her duller sister is spared, and this one was
nerve and brain all over, a million times wiser than he and yet
bound to a wife's silence and submission.</p>

<p>She dragged herself to Melbourne House, and there met Caroline
Lamb and Mary Musters:</p>

<p>"Such a wicked-looking cat I never saw! Some one else looked
quite virtuous by the side of her," she cried to Augusta, and
Augusta soothed and sympathized and did her best.</p>

<p>The tragedy of those three women, the fear and hatred hidden,
and on the surface the forced quiet and courtesies! Lady Melbourne,
who knew the story of each from Byron himself, and more, much more,
may have laughed coldly in her world-hardened heart at the
excellent comedy provided for her amusement, little knowing how
soon and terribly it must all end in tragedy.</p>

<p>And then a new and unforeseen trial for the wife. Byron had
joined the Sub-Committee of Management at the Drury Lane Theatre,
his friendship with Sheridan and others connected with it opening
the way. It was a position which Augusta had been inclined to
advise his accepting on account of its interest and variety for a
man of his tastes. His cousin, George Byron, growing seriously
alarmed at the state of affairs at Piccadilly Terrace, agreed with
her. If his time were filled up with playwrights and the affairs of
Drury Lane there would be less time for the other kinds of
mischief. The advisers failed to foresee that it might bring him in
contact also with many stage aspirants whose beauty was their best
recommendation and that he was the last man likely to resist such
appeals. Fresh boasts were added to the list, and that was the only
appreciable result.</p>

<p>But still she fought her troubles. She knew that he detested the
bother of writing, and offered to become his secretary&mdash;it might
draw them somewhat together. It is pathetic that "The Siege of
Corinth" and "Parisina," when sent in to Murray that year, were
both in her wearied little handwriting.</p>

<p>Almost sinking under her manifold difficulties, it became clear
to her that the strain must be lessened in one way for her child's
sake. Augusta must leave and other companionship be found. She
weighed this resolution long and anxiously and finally wrote to her
mother for advice, touching only upon surface perplexities. Not to
her beloved people would she open her griefs and shatter the peace
of Kirkby Mallory and Seaham. But there were things she might
safely say. Augusta had duties at home. Byron's meals were still of
the biscuit and soda water variety (unless he were enjoying himself
with men friends), and he had an almost insane dislike to see women
eating, unless dainties of such an airy, fairy order as commended
themselves to his poetic taste. Also, he was constantly at Drury
Lane on his Sub-Committee of Management. Should she not have a
sensible companion?</p>

<p>Lady Noel, in her reply, approved and recommended Mrs. Clermont,
a former governess. Certainly she should be there. And this
received, Anne Byron set herself steadily to consider her attitude
towards Augusta.</p>

<p>Her doubts she dismissed as worse than childish&mdash;wicked. They
must be due to her condition, which she had heard laid women open
to the most unreasonable fancies and prejudices. They would pass
with her child's birth, and that friendship remain perhaps the only
sunshine of her life. But for the present, and for Byron's sake,
Augusta must go. For, she asked herself, was this excessive
adulation and worship good for him? Was it desirable that, however
wild and fierce his tempers, there should be a faithful believer at
hand to excuse and adore?</p>

<p>Nothing could be kinder than Augusta's promises and intentions.
She was genuinely shocked at the state of affairs she found, and
her first proposal was that George Byron should be called into
council. When the horrible scenes took place which grew more and
more frequent, Augusta was a fellow victim with herself. The
boasts, the threats, were as much hurled at Augusta as at his wife,
and he had evidently the same frantic pleasure in insulting and
outraging her. And Augusta was terrified, cowering, condoning,
entreating, whispering dark hints of his lunacy when they were
alone, shrinking from any other possibility than that insanity
accounted for his manner to her as well as to his wife.</p>

<p>"He must be mad! I have sometimes thought&mdash;the family
history&mdash;You can see for yourself that there can be no other way of
accounting for it!"</p>

<p>And so forth.</p>

<p>It was hopeless. She was a dear, yielding woman, but had no
dignity whatever. She was as ready to laugh with him when the storm
was over as to cower while it raged. That little, empty, tinkling
laugh! She seemed to have no sense whatever of the consequences of
his conduct to himself or the future. Certainly, it was an
inconvenience, but it blew over and no harm done, while as to a
man's infidelities&mdash;Byron's fault was that he did not keep them to
himself. If a man did that and did not make his wife unhappy, it
would matter so much less&mdash;scarcely at all. That was the way of men
and a woman must expect it, though, of course, no one should be
made unhappy&mdash;she <i>must</i> condemn that in him. It became clear
to Anne that Augusta's company, so far from helping, was hindering.
She must go, but how without wounding one so kind and dear, her
fellow sufferer?</p>

<p>It was a painful matter because she was so deeply attached to
Augusta, who had shown her nothing but warm kindness, yet, if it
would do good&mdash;indeed, things had come to a desperate pass before
they could drive her to any resolution which might wound her. She
hesitated and hesitated.</p>

<p>At last one day she faced the ordeal. They were sitting in the
window overlooking the leafage of the Park, a cheerful, sunshiny
day, the street between full of happy people hastening on their
business or pleasure, the Park gay with groups wandering beneath
the shade, children running and playing about them. Byron was at
the theatre as usual.</p>

<p>Augusta sat with a piece of fancy work on her lap and had the
placid air of one who is comfortably fixed in a place which suits
her. Anne Byron leaned her cheek against the wing of her chair and
looked wistfully out into the sunshine. How it would be dappling
through the boughs at Kirkby Mallory!&mdash;she could see it all, the
sheep nibbling in the happy meadows, the long silences of the warm
green lanes, and peace, peace brooding over the little village and
its small cares and joys. She roused herself at last.</p>

<p>"Had you any news yesterday or to-day from Six Mile Bottom,
Augusta dear? I forgot to ask."</p>

<p>"All perfectly well. The baby had had a bad cold, but it was
clearing off. Would you do this spray of rosebuds in pink or
crimson?"</p>

<p>"A bad cold? Poor little thing! Do you never get anxious about
them so far away? A baby's life is so frail&mdash;and I have heard you
say she is your favourite."</p>

<p>"One shouldn't have favourites, of course, but yet I think she
is. My little Medora!"</p>

<p>"A beautiful name. I remember when I first read 'The Corsair,'
wondering if the rage for the poem would make it fashionable. But
it seems a little too romantic for everyday life to me. What made
you choose it?"</p>

<p>"Byron wished it."</p>

<p>A silence, Augusta sorting and matching her silks. Anne began
again with what courage she could summon.</p>

<p>"Augusta dear, if you could but know how grateful I am for the
way in which you have devoted yourself to us! I shall never forget
it as long as I live, nor cease to be grateful. When I think how
you have deserted your husband and children for so long, and I know
it was done to help me, I can't tell you what I feel."</p>

<p>Augusta's eyes were moist with the tears which came so
readily.</p>

<p>"My dear Bell, say no more! I would do a million times as much
for either of you if I could. And the children are perfectly well
and happy&mdash;I should be recalled if there were any anxiety. I am
always at your service."</p>

<p>"I know it with all mv heart. I know how much I owe you and if
ever I have the opportunity I will repay my debt, happen what
may."</p>

<p>She spoke with enthusiasm, and Augusta, laying down her work,
looked at her with a curious expression.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you would, Bell. I feel you are staunch, and yet&mdash;I
wonder!"</p>

<p>"You wonder, Augusta? Oh, what cause have I ever given you to
doubt me?"</p>

<p>"None, dear, none. One speculates sometimes, that's all. Next to
my dear Mrs. Villiers, my lifelong friend, I am sure I rank
you&mdash;faithful and true. I believe you would defend me to the last
if any one attacked me."</p>

<p>"Attack you? You can never have had an enemy in the world, you
who are all yielding kindness!"</p>

<p>She leaned forward and kissed Augusta tenderly.</p>

<p>"And now I want to tell you something. Mamma thinks, and I
think, too, that since you cannot give me much more of your
precious time, I ought to have some one with me. And&mdash;don't you
agree with me, dear?&mdash;I believe he may control himself when a
stranger is there better than he does with you and me. My mother
has chosen a Mrs. Clermont, who was my governess&mdash;you have heard me
speak of her. She is in London and can come when I wish." Her voice
faltered. "I can't have you sacrificing yourself for ever," she
said.</p>

<p>Augusta paled a little. She looked out into the sunlit green of
the trees, not at her sister-in-law. There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Is it that you wish me to go, Bell? I never thought of
that."</p>

<p>Anne was all tender eagerness.</p>

<p>"In one way the very last thing I wish. I don't even yet know
how I shall spare you. In another&mdash;O Augusta, you know better than
any one what his temper is, and yet you can do nothing with him! I
want to try a stranger. I'll write and tell you faithfully all that
happens. And of course I know you must long to be with the
children. Don't you think yourself it's best?"</p>

<p>Another silence. Augusta laid her work aside. She was pale and
disquieted.</p>

<p>"You don't doubt I have done all I could? You don't mistrust me
in any way? You don't think I have injured you at all? That's not
your reason, is it?"</p>

<p>"Injured me? If all the world had wronged me, I could never
think it of you. No, we have suffered together, and I shall never
forget how you tried to stand between my troubles and me. You have
suffered horribly too. Sometimes I think he is worse to you than to
me. It's as if there were something for which he can never forgive
you. It grieves me, but I see we must part. I must struggle on
alone or with Mrs. Clermont. But I love you. Remember that
always."</p>

<p>The tears rushed from Augusta's eyes and dropped over her work.
She did not even try to dry them. Her attitude was one of weak,
helpless surrender.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right. It may be best. A stranger
sometimes&mdash;Bell, Bell, you do care for me? You <i>will</i> write to
me and tell me your troubles?"</p>

<p>There was a sort of solemnity in the air&mdash;inexplicable. Anne had
never thought it would be like this. Augusta might have been a
little hurt, but this was strange&mdash;so strange! All her life was
turning to strangeness, shadowy faces, voices, calling, fading,
blowing in dark air about her. Even Augusta was strange that
day.</p>

<p>The two women kissed each other silently, and presently Augusta
rose. She turned at the door.</p>

<p>"I shall tell Byron I have had a summons from home. That will be
the easiest way."</p>

<p>The door closed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER 14. A WARNING</h2>

<p class="poem">"So for an hour the storm withheld itself,<br>
Banked up with thunder and the warning flash<br>
Of lightning in the edges, yet was still."<br>
<br>
&mdash;E. B.</p>

<p>Byron took the information in sullen silence, and Anne dared not
open her lips except to mention Mrs. Clermont's coming.</p>

<p>"My mother wished it," she said. "She thought I ought to have
some one with me at meals and to sleep at hand when you are
out."</p>

<p>Not a word.</p>

<p>Not a word for days after. He maintained an insulting,
exasperating, silence. If she entered the room, he never even
looked up. Dead, sullen silence. Augusta left, and not a word. Mrs.
Clermont arrived, and still not a word. It was clear to Anne from
the first that the less Byron saw of her the better, and nothing
could be easier to manage. The two women had their own arrangements
for meals, for their life together, and she only ventured into her
husband's presence to escape the reproach of desertion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Villiers, Augusta's lifelong friend, came to see her a few
days later, a woman of the highest breeding, instinct to her
finger-tips with worldly wisdom tempered with true kindness of the
heart, gracious, lenient so far as sensitive purity could be
lenient to the faults and follies about her. She rustled in, pretty
as a pink and white Dresden figurine in her silks and laces, her
charming face surrounded with snowy ostrich plumes falling from a
drooping hat which Reynolds might have loved to paint.</p>

<p>"I knew you would be lonely and I felt I must come and see you.
So Augusta has gone at last! You must miss her."</p>

<p>"Terribly. She is the most missable person I ever met. Her
presence is just like a fire in winter, burning very softly,
companionable and warm&mdash;you know what I mean. She has all the
qualities one needs in a friend."</p>

<p>"Not <i>quite</i> all, though she is one of the most charming
creatures alive!" Mrs. Villiers said, with a little humorous light
in her face. "There are one or two ingredients left out. She can no
more keep a secret than a sieve can hold water. Never tell her
anything you don't want known. A Byron failing."</p>

<p>Anne's eyes dilated with fear. There were many things she had
confided to Augusta which, if they were repeated&mdash;her heart
plunged, and almost seemed to stop.</p>

<p>"Come, come, dear Lady Byron, you must know the Byron weakness!
They tell the most unheard-of things to all sorts of people. But
Augusta is a dear creature. I don't think being about the Queen was
the best thing for her. The Court has its own atmosphere, and
Augusta is like melted wax&mdash;she takes any impression and keeps it
with a kind of mild obstinacy. Oh, Augusta can be tiresome!&mdash;but,
of course, no one is more lovable in her own way. She is a perfect
comedy."</p>

<p>"No one is more lovable, certainly. My husband always says
Augusta is a fool (<i>I</i> don't think that), but that no one
understands so well how to make him happy. She has that gift. And
the poor dear is so abominably married!" said Anne, a little
bewildered by this outside view of things.</p>

<p>"Abominably. But what could you expect? She married her cousin.
It's sheer madness for a Byron to marry any one of their own blood.
It wants thinning out with some really reliable stock."</p>

<p>"But she is a most religious woman?" Anne's tone was as much a
question as an assertion.</p>

<p>"If kindness is religion, she's religious to her fingertips. Oh,
yes. So long as she's happy herself and every one happy and having
just exactly what they want, that's Augusta's religion. I have
never found out where she draws the line."</p>

<p>Anne was more and more bewildered. This was not the creed of the
Noels.</p>

<p>"But are there to be no restrictions? It seems a kind of moral
idiocy, stated in that way! Surely, religion must sometimes oblige
us to fight certain things and people?"</p>

<p>"Not poor dear Augusta's! I never saw a girl with a purer, more
innocent mind than hers used to be, but she is not strong on the
rights and wrongs of things. I used to call her 'Miss Expedience'
long ago. She was always crammed with expedients, would rather
circle and plan and evade than get straight there, wherever she was
aiming; full of kindly little subterfuges and plannings,
exaggerating, talkative. I am sure the reason you and she are such
friends is because you are as different as two women can be. She is
always most plausible when she is doing just her naughtiest!"</p>

<p>Anne pondered, then raised candid blue eyes to her charming
visitor.</p>

<p>"Don't you <i>like</i> her, that you criticize her in this way,
Mrs. Villiers?"</p>

<p>"Like her? Very warmly and truly. Did you ever know any one to
dislike Augusta? But I shouldn't trust her with a secret. She has a
<i>foggy</i> mind. Things move in it like shadows, and half the
time she doesn't know what she is doing till it's done, and then
she evades and makes the best of it and smothers it over with all
sorts of feathery excuses. She's just the same about other people.
Suppose you committed murder to-morrow or ran away with some one
else's husband, Augusta would never be angry. She would leak it all
out to other people and tell them what a dear you were and what a
sweet temper and how you couldn't help it and how you went to
church&mdash;and it <i>must</i> be all right because you were such a
dear. One gets to have that feeling about Augusta herself. If ever
she murders Colonel Leigh&mdash;and he really does deserve it!&mdash;she will
do it in such an easy, natural, comfortable way that neither she
nor any one else will see any harm in it. I'm never sure that she's
entirely responsible&mdash;not mad, of course, but&mdash;a something gone
loose which, thank heavens, is screwed tight in most of us."</p>

<p>Long after Mrs. Villiers had taken her pretty presence to some
other drawing-room, Anne sat considering her words&mdash;not so much as
concerned Augusta as her husband. Was he wholly responsible? Was
there anything "gone loose" in him which was fixed in other people?
A very favourite subject when he talked at all (when George Byron
or Tom Moore came in and she sat, halfhidden, listening) was his
defence of crimes which seemed hideous to her, of an anarchic
morality (for he called it morality) which aimed at destroying all
the tenets of the creeds she had been taught to build upon as the
very foundations of life and of man's relation to the unseen. He
had often talked like that also when she and Augusta sat silent to
listen. Was it possible that Mrs. Villiers had hit upon the
truth&mdash;could it be that the explanation of all the mystery of her
life with him was that he was not responsible, that (she trembled
before the words shaped in her mind) the Byron taint was a sort of
insanity which permitted men and women to move about the world and
mix with their neighbours and laugh and talk, and yet have
something cruel, sly, secret, desperately daring, lying like a
sleeping wildcat of the woods, behind it all? Evidence pieced
itself in her mind: the day when, in a fury about some trifle, he
had torn a favourite watch from his pocket and dashed it to bits on
the hearth, stamping on it, grinding it to powder, livid with
passion. And why did he sleep with pistol and dagger under his
pillow? Reasonable, if one were travelling in the wilds of
Anatolia&mdash;but in London? She had had these doubts before, but had
stifled them.</p>

<p>Her mind flew back to the stories of "Mad Jack Byron," his
father; the insane rages of his unhappy mother. Augusta had escaped
that last taint, but Mad Jack was her father also, and her mother
the beautiful, frivolous, foolish Marchioness of Carmarthen, who
had forsaken husband and children for Jack Byron and his wild
gallantries. Not much stability there! Could either of them
help&mdash;could any one help what they were? And then that thought, so
contrary to all the teachings of her creed, terrified her, and she
prayed fervently that she might fall into no error of doctrine or
failure of mercy, but be ready to sacrifice herself for them both,
whether mad or sane.</p>

<p>They were hers now, her responsibility, and Augusta had been
very, very good to her. "Forsake also thine own people and thy
father's house"&mdash;that text sounded in her ears. Yes, if one chose
that way one must abide by it and by all it brought. That was the
thorny way of righteousness; what other was worth treading when
that of joy was closed?</p>

<p>There had been a gay gathering at Melbourne House one evening,
at which Byron was present&mdash;a hot, close night with thunder
brooding in purple glooms above the city, the heat intense and
exhausting. In spite of the gaiety there was a sense of suspense,
of dread in the beautiful rooms also. Caroline had not appeared.
She avoided him now. William Lamb had looked in for a moment and
vanished. Lady Melbourne had a stern, preoccupied air which set her
apart from the gaily dressed couples revolving in the fashionable
waltz (she herself thought it beneath the dignity of women of birth
and breeding, but since it was her rule to encourage all that was
approved by society, that too might pass). As the crowd was
dispersing, she beckoned to Byron.</p>

<p>"A word with you when the rest have gone. My boudoir."</p>

<p>He reached that haven before his hostess and stood leaning
against the long open window staring out into the dark street.</p>

<p>Late hours, wine, women, ruinous dissipation, had worn his by no
means stable health. His face was marble pale, the clear features
chiselled into lines of almost unearthly beauty, cold and
disdainful, with a kind of dark dignity upon him. Some foolish
woman, sitting by him while the rest danced (his injured foot
preventing his dancing), had uttered the banality of his likeness
to the young Apollo, beautiful as the dawn, terrible as an army
with banners. The idle words fluttered about him.</p>

<p>Apollo. The god had wandered from the heights of heaven to
Thessaly, where, for a while, he kept the sheep of Admetos, the
wise king. Grey-eyed, crisp-haired, beautiful, he too drawing
sweet, heart-piercing melody from a golden tyre, leaving behind him
a god's gifts, serviceable to men, when he faded like a cloud into
the divine; leaving also a memory of thoughts divine incarnate in
noble human flesh and blood.</p>

<p>But what would Apollo have done with a London season and the
parching gaiety and flattery and women's foolish worship and the
grossnesses of men and the witches' cauldron of it all? Apollo had
the fair Greek country in its serene loveliness and the quiet of
the cropping sheep and immortal dawns and sunsets and&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne entered.</p>

<p>She knew Byron intimately well in face and mind, but at the
moment his beauty startled her, something new in its quality,
fierce, rebellious, clouded with care, the forecast shadow of ruin.
That perception pointed what she had to say.</p>

<p>She ensconced herself in her great chair as he turned to meet
her, and waving him to another, made ready to plunge into her
subject after her own fashion. His expression deflected her.</p>

<p>"What were you thinking of?"</p>

<p>"You would never guess. Greece. Longing for it, craving for the
places I remember, Hymettos, Colonos&mdash;the lovely names&mdash;the
rose-laurels, the umbrage and fountains of clear water. And then,
this squalid street! Oh, for Greece! Great thoughts haunt it like
the shadows of the gods, great&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Byron!" she interrupted in a tone of the utmost
astonishment.</p>

<p>The mocker, the scoffer!</p>

<p>He did not hear her.</p>

<p>"Greece! Oh, when the end comes and the rest after life's fitful
fever, may I sleep there, bathed in the immortal loveliness that is
the nearest I know to what men call God&mdash;in some hollow by the
limpid sea!"</p>

<p>"<i>Byron!</i>" impatiently, "keep that for Murray! I have
things of real consequence to say. Pray attend."</p>

<p>He was himself in a moment.</p>

<p>"I beg your Ladyship's pardon. I was dreaming. I am altogether
at your service."</p>

<p>She paused and collected herself.</p>

<p>"Byron, have I been a good friend to you?"</p>

<p>"The best I ever had!" he answered. "With one reservation&mdash;there
you failed me."</p>

<p>"I know your meaning, but that was to be, I did not plan it. You
snatched at it as you do at everything that glitters. It's about
that I must speak with you."</p>

<p>"Has Bell complained?" His voice was glacial with pride and
anger.</p>

<p>"None of your airs with me! I know you too well. Anne
complained? You know <i>her</i> too well! But do I live in London,
do I hear Caroline's babblings for nothing? I wish to warn you as I
did once before&mdash;and you would not heed me. This is the last time.
It will be soon too late."</p>

<p>"You sibyl!" he said, laughing but nervous.</p>

<p>"I want to warn you that the patience of the world with you has
been almost limitless. Do not try it too far. You have said things
in this house which were sheer madness in any man, <i>criminal</i>
madness in you considering how you have placed your reputation in
Caroline's hands&mdash;not to mention others!"</p>

<p>"A woman won't compromise herself by repeating her lover's
confidences," he answered with pale lips.</p>

<p>The words startled him.</p>

<p>"How much do you think Caroline cares for compromising herself?
Of the others, I cannot speak, but this I do say, that your whole
future rests on Anne. If you drive her to desert you, you will be
quarry for every hound in London. Every one of them will be in full
cry."</p>

<p>"You, at least, would stand by me," he said with earnestness
hidden in jest.</p>

<p>She answered the jest only.</p>

<p>"Who stands by any one who commits moral suicide? How can they?
I am a part of my family and Anne my niece. But my friendship goes
far when it warns you of impending ruin&mdash;<i>ruin</i>."</p>

<p>She spoke the word with emphasis and added:</p>

<p>"Though Anne makes no complaint, I have reason to think her
silences give my brother and his wife a certain uneasiness. Your
wife's condition should appeal to you or any man. Behave yourself
with ordinary decency. No more is needful, but that is
imperative."</p>

<p>Her energy seemed to leave the room doubly silent when she
ceased. There was a long pause. He then said, slowly:</p>

<p>"I know what you say is wise. With every word of it I agree.
But&mdash;I don't know whether the state is common or singular&mdash;in me
there are two selves, one purely contemplative, as calm as a Greek
sage, when the crimes and follies of humanity lie open before me,
my own included, and I see them in all their blackness, and marvel;
the other, when I play my part in life's drama, perfectly heedless
of the consequences though I know the wickedness, the madness of it
all. Some irresistible power drives me like a leaf before the wind.
Is it madness? What is it?"</p>

<p>She grew a little impatient.</p>

<p>"These fine-spun speculations are beyond me. If you know a thing
is folly, why be a fool? I know no man who could less bear the
inevitable consequences. You never have a thing but you despise it.
You never lose it but you want it back. Be warned in time, for time
is running out. And now I must go to bed. I sometimes feel as if
<i>my</i> time were running out. I seem to have less grip of
things, somehow."</p>

<p>"Your ascendency will last while you live," he said with
conviction.</p>

<p>Who could look at that masterful old face, seamed with the
wrinkles of power, and doubt it?</p>

<p>"I fear," she said slowly, "that I shall live to see yours at an
end. Well, I have warned you. Good night."</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER 15. THE DISMISSAL</h2>

<p class="poem">"She stood,<br>
Hand clasping hand, her limbs all tense with will<br>
That strove with anguish; eyes that seemed a soul<br>
Yearning in death to him she loved and left."<br>
<br>
&mdash;George Eliot.</p>

<p>The warning left Byron as it found him, and to George Byron, who
held no key to the situation, madness seemed the one possible
solution. A gentleman might conceivably lead Byron's life, but a
gentleman who could make his wife's a hell to her by dragging her
through the knowledge of it, appeared inconceivable even in the
Byron annals. In one of his frequent conferences with her he
strongly advised that Augusta should be summoned once more.</p>

<p>"You cannot possibly go on like this. It will kill you. Augusta
has the proper experience, and you have always said she is kindness
itself. Have her here again. Things are very bad at Six Mile Bottom
and she will be glad to come."</p>

<p>Yes, she had always said Augusta was kind and knew in her heart
of hearts that it was true. And in her absence all the miserable
doubts had dispersed to the four winds. They were nothing but the
sickly imaginings of a woman out of health&mdash;a mere girl, harassed
almost to death, and utterly incapable of judging facts. She would
write at once.</p>

<p>"Pray do. Mrs. Clermont is a sensible woman, but she is not one
of the family and has no influence. I should lose no time if I were
you."</p>

<p>Augusta's influence. That was always her thought and that of
others. It had given her a little respite in the autumn, for Byron
went down to the Leighs and spent some time there, and returned
better in health and apparently happier. She might attribute that
to Augusta's influence and did so, gratefully. But George Byron was
right. Trouble had again accumulated, and as her confinement drew
nearer she was less and less able to bear the strain.</p>

<p>There was, however, one moment of great relief. Two days later,
as she sat alone, Mrs. Clermont came into the room and closed the
door behind her&mdash;a middle-aged, sensible-looking woman, with bright
healthy colour and a firm mouth and chin. Already she had proved
her value by her dealings with the servants and the difficulties
caused by Byron's irregular hours. Lady Noel's recommendations were
not lightly given, and Anne had confidence in the woman for so many
years attached to the family.</p>

<p>"May I speak with your Ladyship?"</p>

<p>Instinctively she knew there was to be some shock. She clasped
her hands tightly in each other and for an instant shut her eyes to
be alone with herself&mdash;then fronted it.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Anything wrong in the servants' hall?"</p>

<p>"No, madam. I should not have disturbed your Ladyship for that.
But I think there is something you should know, and though I grieve
to trouble you, I feel it may explain some painful matters&mdash;" She
hesitated a moment and then went on:</p>

<p>"I have discovered that his Lordship is taking laudanum. Your
Ladyship is aware how it acts upon the mind as well as the body? I
must be candid, having the honour of yours and Lady Noel's
confidence. Indeed it has been most painful to me to witness your
sufferings, but may we not flatter ourselves that it is not his
Lordship's real nature which uses you so, but this detestable
drug?"</p>

<p>Anne's first sensation was joy. Yes, yes&mdash;that explained. It was
never he. It was a madness, but temporary, a thing which could be
cured and dealt with. She stood up, a light shining in her eyes,
the first for long months.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clermont, I thank you very sincerely. It was right I
should know this. I never dreamt it. I shall speak to the
doctor."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clermont retreated, quiet, watchful. She had seen more than
she judged proper to communicate in Lady Byron's condition, and
would not have mentioned this unless she had assured herself that
it would ease the tension. She still loved him. She would catch
with delight at anything which could excuse his brutalities. And in
that belief Mrs. Clermont was justified. The revelation gave just
the relief which made an intolerable situation almost
tolerable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clermont failed to find any charm in Byron. She was an
unromantic woman and her tersely expressed feeling to her intimates
was that he had no feeling for any one but himself and that any
woman who connected herself with him would live to repent it. She
had perhaps more reasons for this opinion than she cared to
give.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leigh's return was fixed, and of that she disapproved in
silence, warmly as Captain Byron had counselled it. All the
circumstances were displeasing to Mrs. Clermont, who felt her
responsibilities heavily and longed for Lady Noel's presence. That,
however, was impossible, as she knew. The troubles must be faced
without her, for Lady Byron would never permit her mother to know
her miseries.</p>

<p>Augusta came, eager, full of sympathy.</p>

<p>"Oh, the delight of your wanting me, Bell! I thought I had a
little overstayed my welcome last time. Had I, dear? If so, you
must warn me frankly. I am altogether at your disposal. If there
was anything I did, looked, or said to pain you, I have repented of
it in dust and ashes."</p>

<p>"There was nothing. It was all folly," Anne assured her. "You
are my best, my only comforter. But, oh, Augusta, Byron speaks to
me only to reproach me with having married him when he wished not.
You know that is not true. He says he is acquitted of any principle
toward me and that I am answerable for all he does. It is as
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As if what?" Augusta asked, caressing the hand in hers.</p>

<p>"As if I had stepped in and checked him in something he valued
far more than our marriage, and I never have, because I could never
have the courage. But I know he hates me for standing in the way of
something."</p>

<p>Silence. Then Augusta said softly:</p>

<p>"There is nothing, nothing now, whatever there may once have
been in his life. Behind it all he loves you. Believe me he does,
Bell. I remember he told me he wrote to you before your marriage
that there was nothing he wished altered in you, and that he
thought so much of you that he could imagine no greater misery than
failing to make you happy. That is his real mind. I pray, I hope,
that these clouds will blow over and you may both be happy yet. The
child may do it."</p>

<p>She spoke against her belief. No one could live with them and be
ignorant that there were times, growing more frequent, when he
hated his wife. She stood in the way of the perfect freedom which
he craved. Not that he could not recognize her great qualities, but
they galled him the more. What had he to do with that cold
unnatural goodness and self-restraint guarding her deep grief from
open outbursts? He understood her as little as she him, and felt
her to be an unbearable reproach set in his life to mock him with
frozen contempt, when, in truth, her heart was breaking with
rejected love.</p>

<p>As to making her happiness, he knew he had failed, most
dreadfully failed, and had not even the wish to retrieve the
failure. She was his, and must bear the doom which overtook every
woman who had the misfortune to link her life with his. He did
these things, therefore he had the right to do them, and they must
be accepted submissively. He felt sure that she had bent her will
to this. When he came home from the theatre boasting to her and to
Augusta it was hard to say which of the two women received it in
the most resigned silence&mdash;possibly his wife. Augusta sometimes
dared to remonstrate, though mildly. Anne was silent, leaning on
Augusta's kindness and hoping a little still from her presence.</p>

<p>She said to her once, as they sat together after a day when the
storm had been less violent than usual:</p>

<p>"That was because of what you said to him, you dear. I am apt to
believe that the sort of things which please me are to be traced
more or less to the way in which you sometimes appeal to him. Yet
sometimes&mdash;often&mdash;he is as furious with you as with me. The other
day you were 'Mrs. Leigh.' Oh, how impossible it is to deal with.
It is a mystery."</p>

<p>"I am afraid the mystery is the Byron blood," said Augusta
sighing. "No decent person ought to have anything to do with us,
and that's the truth. There are times when I have doubted his
sanity, and I know that before your marriage he told Lady Melbourne
that some doctor he called in for some trifle questioned him very
closely about his excitability and the state of his mind. He told
me that himself. That is the reason why I wish George Byron to be
about, that we may consult him. And of course, what Mrs. Clermont
has told you&mdash;I can't endure that woman!&mdash;about the laudanum may be
at the bottom of a great deal. We must break him of that."</p>

<p>Easily said, but she never had any practical suggestions to
offer. She was mortally afraid of him, entirely under his influence
in word and deed, and her feeble bleatings were less than useless.
But her kindness was everything and Anne Byron clung to her.</p>

<p>Yet her doubts and fears redoubled. There was much in what she
heard and saw which repelled her with a shivering distaste, though
amid all the hurrying clouds and fitful flashes of storm the star
of Augusta's kindness and affection was her only light.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;how could I ever doubt you?" she cried to her one day,
after one of those strange revulsions of spirit. "If all the world
were to deceive me I ought never to doubt you. Promise me that if
ever he drives me out that you will take care of him."</p>

<p>"Doubt me?" faltered Augusta, pale with dismay. "And why? What?
Oh, Bell, you are ill. You don't realize things. I would always do
all I could for you. Don't you know it? I should break my heart if
you didn't believe that."</p>

<p>"I would never&mdash;I ought never to disbelieve it," Anne said
solemnly, and her kiss was less a caress than a pledge.</p>

<p>For his part, George Byron could not understand how either of
them bore the tragedy for a day. There was a time when Byron,
maddened beyond restraint by some inward dreadful sore, threatened
to bring a woman of the many he vaunted into the house if he were
contradicted. Then, for once, in sheer terror Augusta interposed,
braving his fury and telling him he would be responsible for the
lives of wife and child if he could not restrain himself. He
flashed back at first, but possibly astonishment cowed him, for he
said no more and went quietly away as Anne, sobbing with gratitude,
flung herself into Augusta's arms.</p>

<p>So she drew near the time of her peril with such help as Augusta
and Mrs. Clermont could give her. The latter was without the
appreciation of genius which would lead her to condone
ill-treatment because it was inflicted by an inspired hand, and she
had deep sympathy for a girl in such sorrowful case and did her
utmost to safeguard her. She also watched events night and day,
lynx-eyed, firmly holding the conviction that such marriage ties
could not be lasting and that the day was at hand when Lady Byron
and her parents might find it of the utmost importance to have
tangible facts upon which to base a plea for release.</p>

<p>On December 10th, 1815, a daughter was born&mdash;in the midst of
money and other troubles far more poignant. One last faint
flickering hope possessed Anne Byron's mind then&mdash;the hope which
had carried her through her wretchedness. She sent for her husband
directly her battle for life was over and the child lying in its
cradle, and he came.</p>

<p>"Is the child born dead?" he asked her, and as she shrank away
in horror, he turned to the cradle and looked down at his little
new-born daughter:</p>

<p>"Oh, what an implement of torture have I received in you!"</p>

<p>She cried to Mrs. Clermont that she could not, would not, see
him again. It had become a terror increasing, intolerable, burden
after burden laid upon her until she felt she could endure no more.
The true breaking point was, however, not yet.</p>

<p>Recovering her strength, she began to consider the future; the
mother's instinct to save her child giving her a new firmness. She
consulted again with George Byron and with Augusta, and he fully
agreed with them that the case had the appearance of mental
derangement. Augusta harped incessantly upon the subject of
insanity. Some deep fear possessed her and alarmed the wife more
than even her own misgivings.</p>

<p>She felt she must take Mrs. Clermont into her confidence on this
suspicion of insanity. Mrs. Clermont had made many observations,
she knew. They must be referred to the true cause. It might be
needful that people should know he was mad, but they should never
have it in their power to say he was bad if the other were the
truth.</p>

<p>In that painful talk with Mrs. Clermont the thought of insanity
recurred with a kind of dreadful hope.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clermont, have you ever thought Lord Byron insane?" If he
were, her duty lay plainly before her mind&mdash;the child to be
safeguarded, her own lifelong duty of devotion to him clear and
comprehensible.</p>

<p>"Your Ladyship, how can I say? There have been times when I
thought so, and times when I haven't. There's the laudanum, too.
Surely it's a question only the doctors can settle. No one would
listen to any one else. Won't you consult your parents?"</p>

<p>"No, I shall keep it all to myself until I know and understand
exactly. If he is mad, no one in the world shall blame him. I shall
pity and help him all my days."</p>

<p>"And if he is not mad?" There was a peculiar expression in Mrs.
Clermont's eyes as she fixed them on the ground.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" she began courageously, but faltered; "then&mdash;I don't
know. I must think."</p>

<p>"Surely your Ladyship should consult the doctor," was all Mrs.
Clermont answered, as she turned away.</p>

<p>Anne Byron, still weak from her recent peril, made an
appointment to consult Dr. Baillie on the 8th January and even
before that intention could be carried out another blow fell&mdash;a
curt and, as it seemed to her, cruel note from her husband,
requesting her to leave his house as soon as possible and go down
to her parents at Kirkby Mallory.</p>

<p>"The child, of course, will accompany you." She might fix the
date for herself, but he wished to break up his establishment as
soon as possible. True there were money difficulties; she knew
that&mdash;but there was no word of kindness. He wounded her to the
heart, and with a stunned sense of crowding troubles, she answered
coldly and stiffly.</p>

<p>"I shall obey your wishes and fix the earliest day that
circumstances will permit for leaving London."</p>

<p>But the deep love in her relented and wavered in her bitter
bewilderment. The doctor might still pronounce him mad, and if so,
could she ever forgive herself for one harshness uttered, one
kindness forgotten? "The beautiful pale face" still exercised its
spell upon her imagination as well as upon her heart. With women,
even with his almost broken wife, he had that gift&mdash;a word, a look,
an easy momentary kindness, and they were at his feet.</p>

<p>But it had become absolutely necessary that she should consult
Dr. Baillie, and she saw him, confident, as women will be in such
cases, that he could answer her question at once. The girl of
twenty-two forgot, or did not know how all but impossible it is for
the most practised skill to draw the dividing line between sanity
and derangement, and fronted with her imploring eyes, Dr. Baillie
could not answer definitely. He had not examined Byron. The facts
she cited might bear modifying explanations. But it was plain that
things could not rest as they were, that there was danger in their
relations, and that both needed rest and time for
consideration.</p>

<p>He advised her absence for a time; that was necessary, and as
necessary was it that in writing to her husband she should avoid
all painful subjects. The letters must be light and soothing. She
must guard every point which could alarm or annoy him. In short,
the only advice to be given by a sensible man in the
circumstances.</p>

<p>She hurried to Augusta and told her every word, entreating her
to remain on guard in her absence. He must not be left to himself
while there was a doubt. He must be watched and protected.</p>

<p>Augusta promised in her flurry of good nature. Everything,
everything, should be done; she could rely on that.</p>

<p>"Count upon me entirely, Bell. <i>I</i> am certain he is
deranged. I have long thought it. You know I told you I thought he
was quite capable of suicide in his rages. Remember that
always."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course. And write fully to me and I shall write
to you often. With my whole heart and soul I thank you for your
goodness to me. The child and I would have died but for you. I owe
her life to you."</p>

<p>"Then you trust me entirely, Bell?"</p>

<p>The strong truthfulness in her hesitated for a moment, wavered,
but was invincible, unconquered even by her beating heart. She
would give no assurance.</p>

<p>"You are always quoting the Bible, Augusta. Does not perfect
love cast out fear because fear has torment? Why have you asked me
that so often? We love each other. Love is enough, and I will never
fail you nor you me."</p>

<p>Augusta turned sighing away. She had hoped for more.</p>

<p>Her last sight as she left her husband's side was Augusta's pale
disturbed face at the window of that infernal house. Then all was
gone. So, on the 15th January, the child little more than a month
old, she journeyed down to her parents at Kirkby Mallory.</p>

<p>On the way she wrote him an affectionate letter from Woburn and
another on reaching home. She put her heart into those notes; he
should read and know she loved him still and that the past misery
had thrown no permanent shadow between them&mdash;the future was still
theirs.</p>

<p>Her young loving hopefulness, as always, began to doubt and
disbelieve its own doubts and beliefs directly the immediate
darkness was lifted. She knew she was right. He was insane, but not
finally, not irrevocably as she had feared. That would be joy&mdash;the
hope she must accept for all her thoughts and actions. Absence and
the loneliness of separation and the tender thoughts growing up in
it would work his cure, and the cnild&mdash;the child! She went onward
the more cheerfully, her sick fancies, as she might call them now,
dispersing in the country peace. What could she feel for him but
the tenderest pity. Yes, certainly the doctor, though he had given
no definite opinion, had thought him in an alarming state.</p>

<p>To her, country-bred, the quiet of the pale, wintry English
landscape brought inexpressible healing. The lanes, with their tall
hedges, green with reluctant leafage, the long misty meadows where
the cattle browsed in contented solitudes, the distant cawing of
the rookery in the bare and mighty trees of Kirkby Mallory, were
the sights and sounds of home&mdash;home stretching faithful arms to
receive her, speaking to her with beloved voices, nearer, more
intimate than even her child's or her mother's, vibrating in the
deep hereditary sources of being. It was herself&mdash;her unchanging
self, looking at her in the first snowdrops of the year, shuddering
by the tree boles, that she remembered as a fairy wonder of
earliest childhood.</p>

<p>These were the true things&mdash;the things that never could change.
One came back to them, bruised, fevered, exhausted, and they
gathered about one like the outposts of heaven.</p>

<p>It was the more necessary to make the facts clear to her
parents. They saw her return, not the rejoicing young mother, come
home to bring her child and make her boast, but a woman, changed,
nerve-shaken, wincing at a word or look, with heavy care behind her
wearied eyes.</p>

<p>Well, they had never failed her; they would understand with an
even wiser comprehension than her own. So, in trembling anxiety for
their verdict, shot with an intermingling hope, she made her
revelation to her father and mother in the long room at Kirkby
Mallory with the frosty green lawns stretching away into the park,
overhung with grey January mists. It was all a part of the picture
of her mind, wintry, chilly with a deathlike stillness, but the
hope of spring stirring faintly in the roots of the trees waiting
in patient expectation, and in the few small snowdrops in the
sheltered corner by the house.</p>

<p>There was a fear of insanity. No, she had not been happy; how
could that be possible with such a fear? But they must not be
angry&mdash;no. Who could be angry who understood? It had been a
dreadful time and she would want all her strength for what was to
come. But she was certain of their understanding him and
pitying.</p>

<p>That night she wrote to Augusta:</p>

<p class="letter">"I have made the most explicit statement to my
father and mother, and nothing can exceed their tender anxiety to
do everything for the sufferer. They agree that in every point of
view it would be best for B. to come here. They say he shall be
considered in everything and that it will be impossible for him to
offend or disconcert them after the knowledge of this unhappy
cause. My mother suggests what would be more expedient about the
laudanum bottle than taking away. To fill it with three-quarters of
water, which won't make any observable difference, or, if it
should, the brown might easily be made deeper coloured."</p>

<p>This little homely anxious letter was followed by an invitation
from Lady Noel to Byron, most cordially expressed.</p>

<p>Hope was in the air&mdash;faint and cold as yet, but hope, just as
walking in the garden one might see the almost imperceptible
roughening of the buds on black and leafless boughs. And Augusta
was in London, the poor Augusta, whom she could not think wise, but
who certainly would do her best, and could be trusted to give those
confidential reports on the observation of the doctors, for on
their summing up, all must now depend.</p>

<p>Her doubts, as ever, had dissolved in absence, and her young
hopefulness asserted itself to their destruction. She wrote to
Augusta now with passionate frankness even of those doubts, to rid
her mind of the last trace of their poison, repeating her
assurances:</p>

<p class="letter">"If all the world had told me you were doing me
an injury I ought not to have believed it. I have wronged you and
you have never wronged me."</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p class="letter">"My dearest Augusta, it is my great comfort that
you are in Piccadilly. You have been ever since I knew you my best
comforter, and will so remain until you grow tired of the office,
which may well be. My own mind has been more shaken than I thought
and is sometimes in a useless state for hours."</p>

<p>No wonder&mdash;the phantoms she had been fighting&mdash;the terrors!
Indeed it tossed to and fro. Sometimes she repented that she had
breathed a word to her parents, and had not trusted all to time and
to Augusta. Might she not have wrecked the whole future by
impatience? But the matter had passed out of her hands now. The
doctors' verdict would settle all.</p>

<p>And then the blow fell.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER 16. THE THUNDERBOLT</h2>

<p class="poem">"Tea, and a grief more grievous, without name,<br>
A curse too grievous for the name of grief.<br>
Thou sawest, and heardst the rumour scare belief."<br>
<br>
&mdash;SWINBUBNE.</p>

<p>The frost had broken in a great gale, raving and shrieking
through the high wreathed chimneys of Kirkby Mallory, rending the
trees and strewing their ruined branches along the drives and empty
lawns. It was as though an ocean of tempestuous noise and fury were
roaring above them. It could not last&mdash;its very violence slew it,
and there followed a night of peace and passionless snowfall, large
white flakes eddying down from plane to plane of frozen air,
furring the gnarled trunks and branches until they stood in ghostly
beauty, like death arrested, profiled against a leaden sky. The
distances were veiled in softly falling whiteness, only the nearest
trees were visible, and the house of Kirkby Mallory was an island
in a cold world of awful purity and solitude. The long struggle was
over, the victory won by the slowly invading peace of death. So it
seemed, looking out from the great windows. Within there was no
peace either of life or death.</p>

<p>Anne Byron lay almost exhausted by the spasms of neuralgic agony
which had tormented her all night, the mutiny of nerves too long
strained and tortured. As morning came the pain had left her, and
she slept in the great quiet of the drifting silent whiteness, lost
in a pale dream of peace. Surely the worst was past, the pressure
relaxed.</p>

<p>But in the late morning as she waked, worn with hope and
suspense, came the news so long expected, a letter from one of the
doctors attending her husband. She read it with Mrs. Clermont
busying herself in the room but watching in a terror of anxiety,
for if it should bring the tidings which Mrs. Clermont herself
expected, there could be only one possible course for her to take
and that course a dreadful one.</p>

<p>The letter was read, and it dropped upon the wife's lap. The
doctor, Le Mann, wrote with care and detail that he could discover
no symptoms whatever of insanity. Certainly there had been
circumstances which would naturally alarm Lady Byron, Mrs. Leigh,
and Captain Byron, but they represented no more than the action on
his Lordship of excessive vexation from several explicable causes,
his money anxieties, his domestic troubles, and his disordered
health now manifested as an attack of jaundice. There was nothing
beyond this to alarm his family.</p>

<p>The silence in the white world without was reflected in the
white face within, though her thoughts tossed and broke as
desperately as waves in the storm.</p>

<p>Then that hope was over. If it could be possible he should act
and speak as he had done and there was no disorder of the brain to
excuse it, what hope, what help for their future life together?
What hope for the child? Could any child be brought up in such an
atmosphere, and even if it were possible, for her, a child of the
Byron blood, the risks were tenfold. Expedients rushed through her
mind if she herself must be driven back into hell and the gates
closed on her. Could Augusta take the child? No&mdash;no. Augusta was a
good woman, but she had grave faults&mdash;she was a Byron&mdash;there was no
centre, no guiding steadfast principle in her life&mdash;that carolling
laugh was as ready for the great things upon which life is based as
for the trifles, and, after a year of Byron's company, steadfast
principle and every safeguard that example could offer seemed the
only things in the world that could matter to his wife. Then would
her parents keep the child if she herself returned to fulfil the
doom she had chosen and accepted? A wife's duty was first to her
husband, "For better, for worse," and if it was to be so much
harder than thought could dream, still it must be done. Violence,
infidelity, in her code, a wife must bear. But a mother should not
bear it for her little daughter. She would bargain&mdash;she would make
it a condition of her return that the child should remain with her
parents, and after all&mdash;perhaps he hated her sufficiently to let
them both go, leaving him to the freedom he longed for, rid of the
burden and hateful tie he had so often told her his marriage had
become. Why should he keep her? "You are no good to me&mdash;no good at
all," he had said again and again. There was money too, much money,
which would be hers in the future. Perhaps a bargain might be
struck there between her father and husband and a desolate peace
might not be impossible. But in any case she would make
arrangements for return, and there await deliverance if even for
her there could be hope.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clermont drew nearer and stood before her.</p>

<p>"May I enquire what news your Ladyship has of his Lordship's
health?"</p>

<p>She lifted her head and looked at her&mdash;blindly, the inner world
of wretchedness obscuring the outer.</p>

<p>"I forgot&mdash;yes. Yes. The doctor says Lord Byron is quite sane.
There is no question of insanity, none whatever. He has been
worried and irritated. Nothing more."</p>

<p>Dead silence. It lasted so long that it became painful. Not a
sound, not a breath interrupted it. Ann Byron stared at the hands
folded in her lap, forgetting the other woman's existence. There
was so much to think of&mdash;so much!</p>

<p>At last a half-starved bird flew against the window with a sharp
tap of the open beak and fell on the sill&mdash;a ruffle of dead
feathers. Mrs. Clermont turned and walked to the window and stood
there a moment. She spoke from there, not even turning her head&mdash;a
manner very different from her usual decorous courtesy.</p>

<p>"Then would your Ladyship go back, <i>go back</i>, to him?"</p>

<p>It was difficult to rouse herself, but she answered from a kind
of dimness which seemed to cloud her brain like whirling, falling
snowflakes.</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Yes&mdash;certainly."</p>

<p>A moment or two passed. She had relapsed into her cloud again
when Mrs. Clermont turned from the window and, coming back, stood
before her.</p>

<p>"Before you decide, there is something your Ladyship should
know. I must tell it to you because I can't tell whether or no you
would choose to have it mentioned to your parents."</p>

<p>The cloud broke into darting flashes of light in her tortured
brain. More&mdash;more? She could not bear it. She put out her hands as
if to thrust it from her. Mrs. Clermont caught the hands in hers
and held them. Her own face was pale as death.</p>

<p>She spoke.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour the wife rose and supported herself
against the chair. She had uttered no words while the woman told
her story. Now she spoke.</p>

<p>"I shall never go back. You are never to utter one word on this
subject to any living soul. My father and mother are not to know.
You are to keep this secret in life and death. Now, tell my father
and mother to come to me. They are to come this moment. I am afraid
to die before they reach me."</p>

<p>The woman was gone from the room in a breath. The other woman
stood there alone, struck into strength and composure as a chill
unspeakable might strike water into ice. She knew what she had
heard was true. Everything rushed to prove it. The doubts; the
doubts! Forgotten words, actions unnoticed, rose from their graves
like the dead to face the Judgment and stared ghastly in her face.
She knew. Knew also that she had always known, but had thrust it
from her.</p>

<p>Hurrying feet outside&mdash;her father and mother. They came in
alone, and her father closed the door securely.</p>

<p>She spoke without an instant's delay, as if she had been
speaking before and was continuing. Her eyes were dry and bright.
Every word fell clear as a hail-drop.</p>

<p>"I have had a letter from Le Mann. He says my husband is
perfectly sane. No question of insanity. He has been troubled and
angry, no more, and it has made him ill in body. Not in mind. So I
can never go back. I have not told you half the cruelties&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her father interrupted.</p>

<p>"What you have told us is so bad that if the man is not a madman
I will never agree that my child shall return to him."</p>

<p>"Never. Never!" cried Lady Noel, flushing scarlet with anger. "I
could forgive&mdash;I could pity while I thought him mad, but
now&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>She went on as if she had not heard a word and without a sign of
feeling told them his behaviour at the birth of the child, his
boasts of the distractions at the theatre.</p>

<p>"I cannot know if it was true, but you <i>see</i> I can bear no
more. I cannot go back to it. What I wish is this: Write to him and
say it is fixed. I will never go back."</p>

<p>She stopped as if her voice had failed her suddenly and stood
looking at them mutely. They had all three stood while she spoke
and that unusualness gave an air of something hovering and dreadful
in the room.</p>

<p>Her father caught her hand.</p>

<p>"My poor unhappy girl!&mdash;and you bore all that, and in silence.
You did wrong&mdash;very wrong. Could you have thought I would leave my
daughter in his power one instant if I had known the half of it.
I'll write now, now, this minute, and to my lawyers as well. Your
mother will stay with you while I go. Remember&mdash;not a word, not a
word to him yourself."</p>

<p>She shook her head with a gesture of rejection and drew her hand
away. It was as if any touch hurt her physically. Her mother made
to take her in her arms, but she waved that off too.</p>

<p>"We must think of business. We must not think of other things.
It would drive me mad," she said.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph, like a hound unleashed, flung himself off to the
library. He had distrusted the marriage from the beginning. What
Anne wished she must have, but who were the Byrons, what was their
record that they should have his daughter to wreck and ruin&mdash;she
who might have married the greatest man in England and increased
his pride? His face flamed with anger, his voice was thick in his
throat.</p>

<p>Her mother lingered wistfully, but there was a shut look on the
girl's face. She was at the limit of her powers&mdash;she must be alone
or drop. Without another word or even a look behind her, Lady Noel
went softly out and closed the door. The child was crying in the
nursery close by. There was no other sound in the house.</p>

<p>Left alone at long last, she threw herself prone on the floor,
her hands stretched out, her long hair falling about her, and so
lay.</p>

<p>On February 2nd Byron received a curt and sternly worded letter
from Sir Ralph Noel. It recited briefly certain circumstances which
had come "very recently" to his knowledge&mdash;Lady Byron's dismissal
from his house and her causes of complaint while in it. He proposed
a separation, an amicable separation, and demanded as early an
answer as possible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, trusting little to the reply, Lady Noel, taking Mrs.
Clermont with her, journeyed to London, carrying with her a
statement written and signed by her daughter of the causes of her
desire for separation&mdash;a mere repetition of the facts she had given
her father and mother. Her object was to consult the doctors and if
they still alleged Byron's sanity, to consult the famous lawyer,
Dr. Lushington. That was Sir Ralph's determination and to this Anne
Byron agreed with the same unnatural composure. Let what must be
done, be done as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>She had told them all that was necessary for the purpose in
hand. Let them now act upon it and defend her and the child. They
pitied her with a tender compassion&mdash;their attitude would make
return impossible. It would save the child and herself. Therefore
what was necessary was achieved. The rest could be locked for ever
in the secrets of her own breast. For never, never until the
secrets of all hearts shall be revealed should that knowledge be
communicated to any living soul from her lips. She had loved her
husband, she loved Augusta. Come what might, there should be no
hatred where love had been. Hers should never be the hand to wound
either the one or the other. But the strain of thought and dread
was terrible. She lived in such fear that the flicker of a branch
across the window startled her to her feet with hands clasped above
her heart. Suppose he came! Or Augusta.</p>

<p>On most days she had her horse saddled and galloped alone along
the long grassy woodland glades, and the home meadows. Never
outside the gates. There strange eyes might have looked at her and
wondered. Soon all England would be ringing with it like the
booming of a great gong. How&mdash;OGod!&mdash;how could she face it? But
they should not know. They should not know. What was her mother
doing in London? Had her own silence guarded the one point that
mattered?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in London, Lady Noel, steadfastly resolved and calm
alike with the calm of temperament and of good breeding, was a much
fitter person to take the matter in hand than Sir Ralph. She was a
perfectly clear-headed woman and had planned the necessary steps in
the necessary sequence with the utmost foresight. She had taken
Mrs. Clermont with her that she might confirm all that her daughter
had confided to her parents, and her intention was fixed as
fate.</p>

<p>The first step was a visit from a lawyer and the doctor to
Byron. They returned convinced that, however discourteous and
furious his reception of them had been, there could be no question
of insanity. Possibly that information was a relief to Lady Noel
now, for the lifelong care of a lunatic&mdash;and she knew Anne well
enough to be certain that would be her choice&mdash;was a heart-breaking
prospect for a girl of twenty-three. No, the way was clear now.
There need be no hesitation.</p>

<p>She summoned Augusta to a meeting and received her with a
somewhat stiff courtesy&mdash;Augusta all tears and pleading. She came
in in a flurry of feeling, evidently harassed almost beyond
endurance, but still pleading. Of course it was all bad&mdash;very, very
bad. She could not, would not, contradict what they had heard from
Bell. She herself had often marvelled at her endurance. Her own
opinion had ever been that he was mad. But still&mdash;still&mdash;the
doctors laid much stress on this terrible attack of jaundice. Might
it not be that when he was better his temper might improve? She
herself had thought him out of health for a very long time and
still was inclined, in spite of the doctors, to think him insane.
Might not the question of separation be postponed and a chance
given for gentler feelings? She fluttered and cried, but Lady
Noel's lips shut grimly and opened only for an ultimatum.</p>

<p>"I am amazed, Mrs. Leigh, that you who have seen my daughter's
miseries can propose any such thing. Unheard of! No. There can be
no question of delay."</p>

<p>Augusta sobbed.</p>

<p>"I can understand your decision. Perhaps you could hardly be
expected to feel otherwise, but if I must tell Byron that the
decision for a separation is final I do truly and honestly believe
it may induce him to put an end to his existence!"</p>

<p>Lady Noel sat unmoved.</p>

<p>"So much the better. It is not fit such a man should live."</p>

<p>Augusta looked up, her eyes drowned in tears, the sob frozen on
her lips. There was something terrible in the mother's cold
unflinching hatred for the man who had destroyed all her child's
youth and joy.</p>

<p>She said no more. What was there left to say. She returned to
Piccadilly and took Byron's directions to write to his wife on his
behalf and hear directly from herself if the separation were her
own motion or suggested and enforced by her parents. Byron refused
to believe that she herself could wish it. Now, too late, he
recalled her patience, her unvarying tenderness, the true love with
which she had borne so much. He would not believe that at last he
had worn it out, and she had failed him. His wife! What woman had
ever ceased to love him? Caroline Lamb, Mary Chaworth, many, many
more&mdash;and another&mdash;another! He had but to lift his finger, but to
smile, and they would forgive, forget, too thankful for a word of
love or less than love. And was his wife to be the only one with
heart of stone and hard repellent eyes and hands&mdash;she, the mother
of his child? Never would he believe it. Augusta wrote, under his
direction, and the answer came early in February.</p>

<p class="letter">"My dearest Augusta:<br>
<br>
"You are desired by your brother to ask if my father has my
concurrence in proposing a separation. He has. It cannot be
supposed that in my present distressing situation I am capable of
stating in a detailed manner the reasons which will not only
justify this measure, but compel me to take it. I will only recall
to Lord Byron's mind his avowed and unsurmountable aversion to the
married state, and the desire he has expressed ever since the
commencement to free himself from that bondage, as finding it quite
insupportable. He has too painfully convinced me that all my
attempts to contribute to his happiness were wholly useless and
most unwelcome to him. I enclose this letter to my father (in
London) wishing it to receive his sanction."</p>

<p>No, they should not wring a hint from her lips of the cause
behind the causes. They should not even know her knowledge.</p>

<p>Byron, described by Hobhouse as "in an agitation which scarcely
allowed him to speak," wrote meanwhile to his wife:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dearest Bell:<br>
<br>
"No answer from you yet, but perhaps it is as well; only do
recollect that all is at stake, the present, the future, and even
the colouring of the past. My errors, or by whatever harsher name
you may call them, you know; but I loved you and will not part from
you without your express and expressed refusal to return to or
receive me. Only say the word that you are still mine in your
heart, and 'Kate, I will buckler thee against a million!'"</p>

<p>Hobhouse officiously offered intervention. It was coldly
declined. She was inflexible. Every thought and hope now centred
upon the lawyers. They must set her free. The miseries she had put
forward were sufficient, over sufficient. Not another thing need be
added. The child would be safe and once the separation was arranged
she herself could return into solitude like a sick and wounded deer
and break her heart in peace without further injury to him who had
so grievously injured her. That was all she could live for
now&mdash;that and the child.</p>

<p>Her father wrote from London to ask whether if Byron's refusal
to agree to an amicable separation made a stronger course necessary
she would submit to the horror and publicity of a judicial
separation? She wrote back in haste. Certainly; to that or to
anything judged proper by the lawyers.</p>

<p>All now therefore depended upon their decision.</p>

<p>She had written letters many and tender to Augusta since leaving
London. Now there must be a pause. What course to take, which way
to look, she could not tell.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. THE STRUGGLE</h2>

<p class="poem">"Do what thy manhood bids thee do, from none but
self expect applause;<br>
He noblest lives and noblest dies who makes and keeps his self-made
laws.<br>
All other life is living death, a world where none but phantoms

bell."<br>
<br>
&mdash;The Kasîdeh. Richard Burton.</p>

<p>Meanwhile life went on, dragging itself slowly from day to day.
Her letter had reached Augusta, and Byron wrote again in a frenzy
of agitation. He who had always desired to pose as the chartered
libertine, the man of terrible deeds and terrible calm to hide or
confront them, was now compelled to face the consequences of his
deeds and words, and at first he cowered before them. Other women
had endured his insults and faithlessness and slunk away, harmless,
into the dark, but his wife, once so wholly his own, had sprung
apart and now confronted him inflexibly. He found it impossible to
believe that this attitude was final. He implored her to see him,
in words like a cry:</p>

<p class="letter">"When and where you please, in whose presence you
please. The interview shall pledge you to nothing, and I will say
and do nothing to agitate either. It is torture to correspond
thus."</p>

<p>He still believed that the sight of his once beloved face, the
sound of his voice would move her&mdash;she could not have forgotten.
But he was as water beating against rock. She only wrote for the
purpose of explaining why she had written affectionately after
leaving his house, and added:</p>

<p class="letter">"You cannot forget that I had before warned you
earnestly and affectionately of the unhappy and irreparable
consequences which must ensue from your conduct, both to yourself
and me; that to those representations you had replied by a
determination to be wicked though it should break my heart. What
then had I to expect? I cannot attribute your state of mind to any
cause so much as to that total dereliction of principle which since
our marriage you have professed and gloried in. I have consistently
fulfilled my duty as your wife; it was too dear to be resigned
until it became hopeless. Now my resolution cannot be changed."</p>

<p>True as truth itself, yet that was a letter which he might well
show to his friends in the certainty that they would condemn it as
unfeeling, formal, the work of a cold, bitter woman. He himself was
to write of her later as</p>

<p class="letter">"Wanting the one sweet weakness&mdash;to forgive."</p>

<p>And already in his mind, with its swift instinct for the
theatrical, the effective, the thought was shaping that this was
the rock she would split on. She would be cold and silent and
repellent, and the world, wisely led, would gibbet her as the wife
who for a little thing (for what is a husband's temper or an
infidelity here and there in a man so pursued?) had broken up her
child's and husband's home for ever. And all the while in his own
soul he knew well what she had determined his friends should never
know if it lay within her power, the true reasons which froze all
tenderness upon her lips and set a wider river than that of death
between them. She could not and would not blazon her wrongs, and on
that the offenders might count. This thought gave him courage.</p>

<p>For her there was little quiet, even in the outer things. Many
friends, Lord Holland, Hobhouse and others, thought it their duty
to intervene in favour of a reconciliation, for the impression
gained ground that she was hard and unrelenting where mercy would
have best become her. There was little she could say in reply. To
the plea of Francis Hodgson, an old and valued friend, who
approached her with the utmost delicacy and consideration, she said
a little more than to others, but it was only this:</p>

<p>"I believe the nature of Lord Byron's mind to be most
benevolent, but there may have been circumstances which would
render an original tenderness of conscience the motive of
desperation, even guilt, when self-esteem had been forfeited too
far. I entrust this to you under the most absolute secrecy."</p>

<p>Meditating upon it all as she walked under the wintry trees at
Kirkby Mallory, she knew very well that Byron's attitude must and
would be that he had not been told the nature of the charge against
him and therefore it was impossible he could defend himself. There
lay her danger, for he would know her well enough to be sure that
he was safe in taking up that position. Still, even then he could
not wring a word more from her than she thought right, and having
once determined, he should never move her. It was not for nothing
that he had himself taught this girl an almost superhuman
self-control and silence during the miserable year of their
marriage. Where other women would have rushed to their friends,
sobbing hysterically for sympathy, crying their wrongs aloud to
heaven and earth, she had learnt to be mute as death.</p>

<p>But there was the council now sitting in London. Their opinion
must certainly be that the reasons she had given her parents were
sufficient to put reconciliation out of the question. On that
certainty, as she felt it to be, she rested.</p>

<p>Walking up and down under the trees, watching the first faint,
tremulous signs of spring, the slow, reluctant approaches and
retreats of the hope of the world, that one thought filled her mind
and kept monotonous measure with her steps. It must be enough.
Could they expect any woman to endure more than she had told her
father and mother, and which George Byron, Augusta herself, and
Mrs. Clermont must support? And if so, not a word more could be
claimed from her and Byron would see there must be no more delay
and the deed of separation would be signed.</p>

<p>It was as she walked there, alone and brooding, that a letter
was brought to her with fresh news from London, news so dreadful
and unexpected that for the first few minutes she could not realize
it and read it twice, breathless, before she could believe.</p>

<p>The council, sitting in London, had considered the facts put
before them by Lady Noel, and had decided that a reconciliation
between husband and wife might still be possible. The
circumstances, they owned, were such as to justify a separation,
but they nevertheless felt a reconciliation might be the eventual
solution: there are admittedly great offences which mutual
affection may blot out, might not this be such a case? Might not
the wife herself live to regret it if no attempt were made for
peace? And if not now, later? There was also the child to be
considered, and the possibility of an heir eventually to her
husband's title and estates.</p>

<p>It was quiet, quiet under the trees, along the woodways, upon
the chill grey silence of the water. The sky above was dark and
still. It seemed that every blade of grass might claim a peace
which could never be hers. Day handed on to day its fears and
perplexities, growing every hour until the burden seemed more than
humanity could bear. What now was she to do? She could ask no
advice from any human being, for none knew all the facts which must
determine her decision.</p>

<p>All the afternoon she paced the cold gardens or her room,
considering, doubting. She might refuse to return on her own
responsibility and her parents would support her, but what could be
thought of the wife and mother who refused forgiveness and peace
with the opinion of her own chosen advisers against her? Even her
courage might well flinch from that position! And what would be the
child's feelings when the inevitable moment came, as it comes to
all children, and her parents stood for judgment in the court of
her heart?</p>

<p>Suddenly a solution flashed before her. If she could trust,
absolutely trust one of the advisers who had taken counsel
together, if he would swear himself to secrecy until she herself
should release him, then she might have the help she needed&mdash;not
otherwise.</p>

<p>But had she the courage? Would it be possible for her to speak
to any living soul of her true reason? For a long time she was
certain that the thing was impossible and that it must not even be
debated in her mind: the effort was beyond her. For an hour more
she paced swiftly up and down the long glade with its leafless
boughs, considering, doubting, trembling, her limbs almost failing
beneath her. No, no, impossible for ever! The words would die in
her throat. It was settled. She must endure the world's judgment.
She could not speak.</p>

<p>A pale, silvery gleam of sunshine cast faint shadows of the
naked boughs on the gravel, a faint warmth touched her cheek. A
glass door opened and the nurse appeared with the baby, furred and
warm, in her arms. It was natural that the woman should bring her
to her mother and lift the veil and show the little rosebud face
with the dark lashes lying on the silken petals of the cheeks&mdash;but
it changed her life.</p>

<p>She looked, and in a strange flash knew instantly that she could
do that or anything else that might be required of her to keep the
child from the father. For a moment she took the baby in her arms
and held her warm and tender against her desolate bosom, then gave
her back to the nurse and walked quickly to the house.</p>

<p>In four days she was in London and had fixed a meeting for
herself with Dr. Lushington. She had never wavered or doubted
since, for she believed that in that moment it had been given to
her to know and to choose her way. She believed it still as she sat
waiting in the sombre room of the hotel, with its green damask
curtains and mahogany furniture stiffly disposed and polished until
each piece gave gloomy reflections of its gloomy fellows. The
walls, covered with a heavy flock paper, absorbed the dingy light
outside and refused to return a ray to brighten the noonday
twilight of fog and rain.</p>

<p>Dr. Lushington appeared, urbane and courteous, with a face made
to receive secrets and return a ray of knowledge as little as the
paper on the walls. It was a face to be trusted, from the very
absence of sentiment or human feeling. This was but a case to him.
She might display her sick heart as to a doctor a woman displays
her sick body, knowing that it is the ailment only that can
interest.</p>

<p>It was not in her nature to beat about the bush. Her simplicity
and absence of self-consciousness were so complete that the fear
she had thought might disable her only made her voice clearer and
more composed, although it paled her face to an almost deathly
whiteness.</p>

<p>"I have come to see you, Dr. Lushington, on a very painful
matter. My mother has already consulted you."</p>

<p>"Painful indeed, my dear Madam," he answered gravely. "And
doubly so at your age and my Lord Byron's."</p>

<p>She passed that over and continued:</p>

<p>"My mother submitted the statement I signed. I felt sure you
would all agree that my case was a hard one."</p>

<p>"Very hard. But let me remind your Ladyship that the doctors
attribute much to the state of his Lordship's health. When that
improves we may hope for moral improvement with it. And patience
must always be a wife's duty. Moreover, we must consider yourself
and think ahead for you in a way which cannot be expected of so
young a lady. Your husband has many great gifts which have won him
a European reputation. He has still the attractions which won your
heart. You might be the first to reproach us later if we had not
advised patience and the necessity for keeping a possible
reconciliation steadily in view. You are very young, my dear Madam,
and my respect for your parents compels me to speak to you as
candidly as I might to a daughter of my own. And that is my
deliberate opinion."</p>

<p>She listened with the most serious attention, her eyes fixed on
his. He thought at the moment that her manner was older than her
years and that it might certainly have been disconcerting to a man
so universally courted as Byron to find those calm, unwavering eyes
fixed upon him while he boasted and vapoured at home. Women should
scarcely be so calm and clear-eyed. He had the impression that she
might have a very strongly marked character, a possession not
wholly desirable in the female of the species, especially in
relation to the male. When he had finished, she asked gravely:</p>

<p>"Then it was your opinion that I should open the way for a
return to my husband? You remembered that I had a child&mdash;a
girl?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. But the mother's influence counts for so much more
than the father's that your presence would be her safeguard."</p>

<p>"You considered every point?"</p>

<p>"Every point. My dear Madam, search your own heart! These were
great offences&mdash;heaven forbid that I should deny it!&mdash;but it is
your husband. Is there nothing there that pleads for him far more
deeply and sincerely than is in my power?"</p>

<p>She looked straight at him and said:</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable pause, and again Dr. Lushington had
the impression that she so often communicated to others&mdash;an almost
angular strength of purpose. No yielding, no conciliation. He shook
his head a little impatiently. Lady Noel had been easier to
convince in spite of her very natural indignation.</p>

<p>"I have come to London, Dr. Lushington, to consult you
myself."</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>"I wish to tell you something I did not tell my parents, but it
must be on condition that you will promise me secrecy."</p>

<p>He straightened himself. She added:</p>

<p>"Until I myself shall release you."</p>

<p>He began a remonstrance, an exposition of the unwisdom of
fettering his judgment. She half rose from her chair, and he
hesitated.</p>

<p>"If your Ladyship insists&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir, you have the right to refuse to hear me, but secrecy is my
condition if you are good enough to listen."</p>

<p>He looked at her in perplexity for a moment, then composed
himself in a chair with the same gravity of attention which he
would have accorded to a man. No soothing encouragement or delicate
little attentions were necessary here. She was sufficient for
herself&mdash;that self she must disclose as she pleased. Her hands
folded on her knee and her face a white dimness in the gloom of fog
and rain, she told her story with a voice so clear and unfaltering
that it might not have concerned her at all.</p>

<p>But at the end of it, when her words ended abruptly, the man
before her was too well trained an observer to be misled any
longer. He understood her courage now and marvelled.</p>

<p>There was a great quiet in the room when her last word was said.
She put no questions and sat quite still in the same position, her
hands folded on her knee. He saw the glint of the wedding ring on
one and marked it mechanically while he collected his mind for
reply. A cart went by with a thunder of wheels and jingle of
harness, and still she had not moved. Suddenly he spoke.</p>

<p>"You are right. I have changed my opinion. You can never
return."</p>

<p>"You are certain&mdash;absolutely certain?"</p>

<p>"So certain that if you wished it yourself I should decline to
be a party to it in any way, either privately or professionally.
What you have said completely alters the case and puts an entirely
new complexion on it."</p>

<p>"It finishes it?"</p>

<p>"Completely."</p>

<p>Silence. She had no air of victory or triumph. An unspeakable
weariness breathed from her, not only the face, but the whole body
had an air of exhaustion. He had not noticed before how young, how
ill, she looked. The first impression of coldness and hardness had
vanished. He saw now that she had suffered to the very limit of
human strength and was clinging to that composure as a last refuge
from utter breakdown.</p>

<p>"From my soul I pity you," he said, and with deep sincerity.</p>

<p>But that was the wrong note. She waved it aside, for sympathy
was all but unendurable.</p>

<p>"I want your advice. You must understand my position. I will not
injure any human being. My child and myself I must save. That is
done. Now I have to think of others. I have loved&mdash;I love her. I
owe her much kindness when I needed it sorely. She was good to me.
To a certain extent she suffered with me. I decline to injure her.
That is why I swore you to secrecy."</p>

<p>He was almost unable to speak for astonishment.</p>

<p>"But surety you cannot comprehend! Leaving your husband for the
reasons you alleged to your parents you will be under a cloud all
your days. The magnificence of his position in literature will fix
all eyes upon you and condemn you, not only now, but so long as his
name is remembered. The woman in question will consider only her
own safety. Her position is desperate. It is a necessity of their
case that you cannot be spared even if they would, and you may take
my word you will not be."</p>

<p>"I know. But that cannot be helped. I have given you the reason.
I shall tell it to no one else."</p>

<p>"I entirely disapprove. I must beg you to consider before you
adopt a course which is plainly disastrous. All you have said
should be instantly put before your advisers. It is
indispensable."</p>

<p>She sighed patiently, but did not waver.</p>

<p>"You are aware that your husband has complained already that no
specific charge has been made against him, and that your silence
will put a weapon into his hands which he will infallibly use to
divert all sympathy from you, while with a word you can set
yourself terribly right?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of that."</p>

<p>"Then once more I ask, <i>What</i> is your motive, first, in
telling me this; second, in forbidding me to use it?"</p>

<p>"First, because I must save my child and myself. Second, because
I have loved my husband. All my life my difficulty will be not to
think too tenderly of him. And I have loved her. I would not injure
her&mdash;no, not by a hair's breadth. It would tear my heart. And I
should consider it a crime, in view of her ties and relations. I
will never do it."</p>

<p>He looked at her gravely.</p>

<p>"You are a most extraordinary woman. If it were written in a
book, this would not be believed!"</p>

<p>"It is true," she said simply.</p>

<p>Again there was a long silence. Presently he resumed.</p>

<p>"The case is not so clear as you suppose. A circumstance has
arisen&mdash;in short, I must consult with other advisers. The matter is
of the utmost seriousness and&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted hurriedly.</p>

<p>"You promised!"</p>

<p>"I promised. But I must ascertain the views of my colleagues on
certain aspects of the case and then I shall ask you for another
interview. Your Ladyship is remaining in London?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am at your disposal whenever you wish to see me.
Remember, I trust to your promise, Dr. Lushington."</p>

<p>"I shall not mention that you have confided in me."</p>

<p>She rose without a moment's hesitation, having evidently the
same clear confidence in him as in herself. But he detained her a
moment, looking at her with troubled eyes. Indeed, in the latter
part of the interview he had been apparently more deeply moved than
she.</p>

<p>"I wish in my turn to exact a promise. Promise me that you will
see no person referred to in the matter you have just mentioned
unless I authorize you. You may be tempted to do so. Resist that
temptation. It would be a disaster to you and to them. The
consequences would be impossible to foresee."</p>

<p>She considered a moment and then said quietly:</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>When he had left the hotel and returned to his own house he
stood quietly a while by the window looking out into the fog and
slowly dripping rain. But he saw nothing of it. His mind was
absorbed in the woman who had borne herself so strangely. The clock
ticked softly in its coffin-shaped mahogany case, the day darkened
heavily outside.</p>

<p>"I am very much mistaken," he said at last, half aloud, "if the
whole brunt does not fall on her. It is the most singular case that
I have ever met in my life. There is no one who will believe a
woman capable of acting as she proposes to act."</p>

<p>He turned back to his great bureau, strewn with papers.</p>

<p>"But <i>I</i> believe it," he said, and drawing his pens and ink
towards him, he wrote two letters, to Colonel Doyle and Mr. Wilmot
respectively: the first an old friend and a man of the world whose
opinion in social difficulties was all but final, the other a first
cousin of Byron's.</p>

<p>Having written and despatched these, he sat alone, lost in
thought.</p>

<p>Two days later he came to her again, and this time, in the
brighter daylight, could see the worn lines deepened in her face.
Perhaps he was at last able to estimate the depth of her tragedy
and the cost of the fresh pain he must inflict. She looked at him
silently.</p>

<p>"After I left you the other day I summoned Colonel Doyle and Mr.
Wilmot to a meeting to discuss, not what you told me, for I did not
mention that, but a matter connected with it. Your Ladyship must
now learn on the authority of myself, Colonel Doyle, and Mr. Wilmot
that certain circles of society are circulating rumours respecting
the very fact you confided to me. The air is full of it. You will
see, therefore, that all thought of secrecy on your part is
hopeless."</p>

<p>For the first time he saw a sort of ripple of agitation pass
over the nerves of her face, like the breaking up of ice.</p>

<p>"How could it be? No, no! No one knew but myself and one other
person. You are all most terribly mistaken."</p>

<p>She had turned so ghastly pale that he rose and put his hand on
the bell, but she waved him back.</p>

<p>"Tell me. Where?"</p>

<p>"A part of the rumour certainly springs from Melbourne House. It
is said Lady Caroline Lamb has given vent to words relating to
matters she heard from your husband which bear no other
interpretation. Furthermore, it appears that at one time there was
an intention on your husband's part to travel abroad to Sicily with
the person involved, an intention he mentioned in writing to Lady
Melbourne, your aunt, with whom he constantly corresponded. She
dissuaded him, saying it would be a fatal step. She wrote,</p>

<p class="letter">"'You are on the brink of a precipice, and if you
do not retreat you are lost for ever&mdash;it is a crime for which there
is no salvation in this world, whatever there may be in the
next.'"</p>

<p>She screened her face with one hand, leaning her elbow on the
table. He pitied her so profoundly that he sought in his mind for
some scrap of comfort to offer her starvation.</p>

<p>"Your Ladyship must remember we are dealing with a man who
boasts himself to be, and, I think is, in all respects a pagan. The
sanctions of our Christian world are nothing to him. He acts as an
ancient Roman or Egyptian might have done and knows no more wrong
or remorse than they. That is no excuse, but it is an
explanation."</p>

<p>She answered from behind the screen of her hand.</p>

<p>"I was not thinking of that. I was thinking that my own people
knew and still they let me marry."</p>

<p>The heart-piercing simplicity of it was like a child's grief. In
a moment she added:</p>

<p>"Who can understand that?"</p>

<p>"The way of the wicked world we live in," was all he could
say.</p>

<p>He gave her a moment to recover herself and then went on:</p>

<p>"He has really damned himself by the opinions he has openly
expressed on these points, and we need refer no further to all
this. The question for us now is, what is to be your line of
conduct?"</p>

<p>"What should it be?"</p>

<p>Rejoicing at the question, he went on with more confidence.</p>

<p>"There must, of course, be the separation. If, believing you
will not sue for a divorce, your husband refuses it, he must be
threatened with an action in the Ecclesiastical Court. Do you
agree?"</p>

<p>"I agree. But neither he nor I will let it come to that."</p>

<p>"Possibly you are right, but that is the procedure. Meanwhile,
ruin is before them. It is the opinion of your advisers that in a
short while your husband will be compelled to leave the
country&mdash;and not alone."</p>

<p>She dropped her hands and looked up, strained to an agony of
attention.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean that I believe he will take the line from which Lady
Melbourne dissuaded him two years ago. I feel certain of it."</p>

<p>She rose so sharply from her chair that it startled him. He rose
also and they stood facing one another.</p>

<p>"Dr. Lushington, this raises questions for which I was not
prepared. I must think&mdash;I must think. It alters everything. I thank
you for your good counsel. It was fortunate indeed I came to you.
But I must think, and I will tell you then."</p>

<p>He agreed at once.</p>

<p>"On condition that you do nothing without consulting me.
Meanwhile, I shall say openly that my opinion is changed and I
consider a reconciliation impossible. Do you agree to both these
things?"</p>

<p>"I agree."</p>

<p>She was so evidently anxious to be alone that he could not delay
a moment more. He looked back before he closed the door and saw her
standing there "all delicacy and grace" as another described her,
her child in her hand, the wife of one of the foremost men in the
world, gifted, young, good, all the world's treasures at her feet,
and yet so tortured, so desolate that the beggar who whined for an
alms in the street as he left might have pitied her.</p>

<p>"Life is a strange, strange business," he said to himself.</p>

<p class="poem">"For I have seen the open hand of God<br>

<br>
&mdash;EURIPIDES.</p>

<p>In the world outside the deathlike solitude of the inner world
surrounding Anne Byron in her Dark Night of the soul, the hounds of
rumour were unleashed and panting on the track. It could scarcely
be otherwise. It had been felt by the average Englishman that the
epidemic fascination of Byron's verse resembled some malady caused
by its poisonous beauty as of a tropic flower overcharged with
perfume dangerous for those who might linger too long in the
moonlit jungle of his rank imagination. But, they reflected, it was
probably the case that young people took the infection as they did
measles, and recovered as quickly. That was the tendency of poetry:
it mattered very little to sensible grown up people, and daughters
after a bad attack of "Lara" and "The Bride of Abydos" still went
to church and had correct opinions on waltzing, the spring
fashions, and the respect due to parents. And it was a comfortable
reflection also, as it usually has been in England, that any poet
was almost certainly a little mad and that those who read him were
very unlikely after all to be betrayed into a deplorable agreement
with the wild opinions on social, political, and family matters
which are a necessary part of the poet's stock in trade&mdash;which may
even be acceptable when safely secured between the covers of a book
and warranted never to emerge. One must after all be just in facing
the question&mdash;How indeed could a man be a poet if he held the
commonplace respectable opinions? Yes, imagination run mad in verse
could certainly be condoned, and in real life these things were not
taken seriously.</p>

<p>But unhappily Byron did not keep his opinions in the fantastic
world of imagination where Caliban has his rightful place beside
the delicate Ariel. On the contrary, it was known that he had
allowed himself a most dangerous licence of tongue in attacking the
settled sanctities of life and lauding the dead iniquities of the
ancient world, not in poetry, but in plain and excellent English
prose. He had compelled sober people to remember that the seed of
thought and manners sown and harvested by French revolutionaries
has an ugly trick of becoming the daily bread of younger and wilder
spirits even in the land of virtuous conservatism. Was there not a
living poet, a man named Shelley, equally well born with Byron, who
had translated his theories into practice and was even now, not
only shrieking them with fanatic earnestness in the ears of an
affronted England, but living them in deplorable earnest?</p>

<p>For the past two years there had been a sense of danger in the
air that surrounded Byron. There were only whispers, but sibilant,
remembered. Whispers springing not alone from the unhealthy play of
his imagination about the Forbidden, but from the insane
confidences which his vanity thrust upon more than one who, but
halfbelieving at the time, did not forget. He had named names. He
had not only risked but ensured the ruin of another's reputation
when the inevitable spark should fall upon the fire he himself
built up. His contemptuous affection&mdash;if there were in truth
affection&mdash;spared none who trusted him. Their names were in the
power of rivals and therefore in the power of the world, and the
one name to which it was deadliest ruin had also passed, by his own
deed, into the keeping of others.</p>

<p>Lady Melbourne, but not Lady Melbourne only. There was Caroline
Lamb. The confidences flung out to cut her to the soul had wounded
indeed, but became her own weapons now. And she talked madly,
terribly, as did others.</p>

<p>So the muttering of the storm drew nearer and nearer, and soon
it was to burst in thunder on his head. He might count upon his
celebrity and popularity to save him, but, as Rogers had said,
there is no celebrity, no service, no hope of future service, that
can save a man in England who has crossed the invisible line drawn
in the public mind. The band of sycophants who surrounded him were
by their efforts doomed only to failure when they strove to undo
the mischief he had himself wrought. And moreover there was a
feeling in the air that the worship of the poet, even as a poet,
had been overdone, that it was doubtful whether posterity would
back the bill presented to it.</p>

<p>They could not then foresee that though the uneasy ghosts of
"Lara" and the "Giaour" would be laid and posterity trouble itself
little enough about them and their Medoras and Gulnares, the
white-hot metal on the anvil, welded by the strokes of fear and
hatred and maddening defiance, was to emerge at last the
incomparable rapier of the greatest English satirist since Pope
himself. In a word "Don Juan" was still unthinkable, though all the
influences needed to produce him were now loosed and combining.
Those poisonous flowers of Romance adorning corruption, like
garlands bestrewing the hearse, were withering. Byron himself knew
it, was half sick of them, and, as unable to foresee the cool
precision of his new method and manner in the future as the meanest
of his critics, was at the moment ready to lay down his pen for
good.</p>

<p>But the forge was ready, the fire lit, while he waited events in
Piccadilly, alternately defiant with a bitter levity and cowering
in despair, convinced that doom had overtaken him. And the English
people, to whom his nature and his work were in truth wholly alien,
prepared to avenge themselves for the brief season of constrained
adoration by celebrating the carnival of his destruction.</p>

<p>In four days after the last interview Dr. Lushington requested
another interview with Lady Byron on a matter of vital importance,
when he would be accompanied by Colonel Doyle. It had become plain
to her that Fate was to spare her in nothing and that though she
clung with despairing tenacity to her first resolution the widening
circle of events might prison her. There comes a day when even the
strongest will must recognize it is a puppet in the hands of
invisible Destiny and that the only attitude possible to exhausted
humanity is that of passive resignation.</p>

<p>It was in some such mood that she faced the two men when they
entered the room, each evidently with a strong sense of the
difficulties of the position.</p>

<p>Outward composure she could command and it was always an
unfailing surprise to those who had dealings with her, especially
to men who naturally expected some facility of grief in a young
woman confronted with the tragic incidents of Sophoclean drama.</p>

<p>But there was nothing dramatic about the heroine of this drama.
She greeted them with quiet grace and sat prepared for the
worst.</p>

<p>Dr. Lushington began at once.</p>

<p>"I must premise that Colonel Doyle is acquainted with all the
circumstances, including the rumours referred to in our last
interview. I have withheld your views from him according to
promise, but having been in conference with Sir Samuel Romilly and
your other legal advisers, it was their opinion and mine that
Colonel Doyle's advice as an old friend and man of the world would
be invaluable on the social aspect of a case which concerns so many
great names. On this there is entire unanimity of opinion. But some
preliminary information is necessary that you may fully understand
the position."</p>

<p>Colonel Doyle, who had known her for years, kept his eyes fixed
on her during these words. She was grievously changed, but the
innate calm which, however disturbed it might be on the surface,
was still the keynote of her nature was, so far as he could judge,
unruffled. He thought that events had moved her singularly little.
There appeared to be almost apathy, a want of feeling, as if she
scarcely knew or cared&mdash;a lay figure whom an artist uses for the
centre of a tragic picture. Perhaps it was as well, considering the
circumstances, he thought. They might have killed a sensitive
woman. He little understood her or the weary way she must travel
before she attained to look upon the beginnings of peace.</p>

<p>Dr. Lushington continued.</p>

<p>"Lord Byron, after one or two vacillations, declines to accede
to any separation."</p>

<p>Her eyelids seemed to twitch as if with a sudden shoot of pain,
but that was all. Dr. Lushington continued:</p>

<p>"He asserts that he has not been told with what he is charged
and complains of this as a gross injustice, and his solicitor has
communicated to us his positive refusal not to separate by consent.
Now it is of course perfectly plain that Lord Byron could at once
set himself right in the world's eyes and force us into specific
charges by bringing a suit for restitution of conjugal rights, and
the fact that he does not attempt this speaks for itself. The truth
is, he knows the danger in which he stands. Colonel Doyle will
corroborate my statement that the rumours as to himself and another
person were current nearly two years ago and were known to Lord
Byron himself&mdash;whose own madness of confidence to various women
seems to have originated them. The town is ablaze with them now,
and if your Ladyship takes up a strong position with regard to
them, your victory is assured. The persons concerned cannot
confront them. All but personal secrecy is out of the question: the
thing is quite generally discussed."</p>

<p>She took a moment or two for reflection, during which Colonel
Doyle watched her with the deepest interest&mdash;not indeed as doubting
what her answer would be, but because he realized the extraordinary
drama being enacted before him. Probably she did not realize it in
full herself&mdash;that was his belief&mdash;but it was there none the
less.</p>

<p>Her answer, however, when it came was as unexpected as all else
about her.</p>

<p>"I see that it is necessary I should take Colonel Doyle into my
confidence to a certain extent. I told you, Dr. Lushington, that I
knew nothing certainly, that I suspected and believed, and that
though I thrust away the cruel reasons I had for suspicion again
and again, they came back, and could not be forgotten. In my own
mind there is conviction, and if what you have heard of these
rumours is true, it supports my conviction. But I will never attack
the reputation of a woman whom I loved and still love, who has
protected me from my husband's violence of temper and abuse at a
time when without her support it might have killed, not only me,
but my child. I owe her my life and unforgettable gratitude. She
risked her all."</p>

<p>She spoke without any passion, with quiet earnestness, no more.
The two men looked at one another in astonishment. There was a
pause. Then Dr. Lushington said gravely:</p>

<p>"You should also know that Lord Byron has threatened to claim
the child and place it in the care of Mrs. Leigh."</p>

<p>The blood rushed violently to her face and, ebbing, left it
white as death. She put her hand to her throat as if she were
choking for air and Colonel Doyle went to the window and opened it
to let the fresh air into the close room. But in a moment or two
more she had recovered, and even made an apology.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have alarmed you. I have not been sleeping
well&mdash;the noise of London, perhaps. To return&mdash;if I see Mrs. Leigh
I am certain that suggestion will go no further."</p>

<p>"See Mrs. Leigh!" burst from Colonel Doyle. "Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Impossible," repeated Dr. Lushington. "Her interests are
entirely opposed to ours. Such a proceeding would be unseemly and
dangerous in the highest degree. If their side is to be saved it
must be by destroying your character as a trustworthy witness, and
the least slip would be fatal. Traps would be laid for you which
none of us could foresee."</p>

<p>"I shall never be a witness against either the one or the
other," she replied.</p>

<p>There was a pause of blank dismay. Neither of the men spoke.
Indeed, it was impossible at the moment for them to estimate the
consequences of that declaration. The whole situation was
extraordinary. Here was a young woman of twenty-three, with not
only her child's future, but her own dependent upon her strict
obedience to legal advice, and she broke away from all the
safeguards of the law, prepared to face her destiny on rules which
had no relation to any Court, ecclesiastical or temporal.</p>

<p>"You cannot surely mean," said Colonel Doyle at length, "that
you will permit your child to be placed in Mrs. Leigh's hands and
that you will return to your husband? We have certainly
misunderstood you, Lady Byron, or you have not understood us."</p>

<p>She lifted the pale intelligence of her face and looked them
straight in the eyes, A keen observer would have known that the
brain was working hand in hand with the heart now and that together
they might prove a match for the forensic knowledge of the one man
and the worldly knowledge of the other though opposing her
together.</p>

<p>"I told you, Dr. Lushington, that it was a case which I must
consider very deeply. There are cruel complications. But I have
considered and I see my way&mdash;just a few steps ahead, but clearly.
If you will be patient with me I will tell you how. I am not in the
least afraid of my husband. He will threaten and prepare to fight,
and then suddenly give way."</p>

<p>Dr. Lushington raised his hand as if about to speak, but was
silent, waiting.</p>

<p>"And as regards the other person, I have loved her&mdash;she loves
me. We understand each other without intermediaries. She will never
countenance taking the child when she knows my wish. Nor even
without."</p>

<p>"If sentiment is to enter into so serious a matter&mdash;" began
Colonel Doyle, and stopped as Dr. Lushington had done. There was
something in her manner which silenced opposition for the
moment.</p>

<p>"If sentiment and reason go hand in hand is either the worse? My
husband has made that threat, not she. I wish you, gentlemen, to
consider this. Here is a woman with many friends and relations, a
husband and children, whom her ruin in reputation must agonize.
Consider her position. There is only one person in the world who
can save her. Myself. If I still hold out my hand to her she is
safe. If I withdraw it she is lost. Do you think she forgets that?
What is there that I can ask and she refuse? Nothing."</p>

<p>She looked at them in a kind of pale triumph. Dr. Lushington
said loudly:</p>

<p>"I refuse to consider such a course. It is a degradation for
yourself and in every way unsafe and to be deprecated. You cannot
meet her. If you are doing it for the sake of the child, I remind
you that the child can be safeguarded in the proper legal manner at
any moment if it comes to a fight. You have nothing to fear in
coming into the open."</p>

<p>"I have very much to fear," she answered. "The ruin of two
persons both most dear to me once&mdash;dear to me still. And what we
wish to attain can be gained in <i>my</i> way and a woman, whom I
regard as a victim as much as a sinner, saved instead of driven to
desperation."</p>

<p>Colonel Doyle interposed.</p>

<p>"Have you remembered, Lady Byron, that that very desperation
will set you above the mark of all tongues and will justify you,
not only now, but to posterity? I would wager any sum you like to
name that if you are once drawn into the tortuous windings of that
woman's character&mdash;kind, I agree, but thoroughly evasive, without
any fixed principles, crafty, shifty&mdash;fighting for her very
existence, you will regret it to the last day of your life. She
will find a hundred ways of slipping her shoulder from under the
burden and leaving it somehow on yours. Has she not steadily
deceived you hitherto? Did affection prevent that? It is your
solemn duty to be led in this matter by your advisers. Hear reason
before it is too late. Once you have countenanced her now, you can
never afterwards withdraw or explain that countenance. It is her
certificate of character, and you cut the ground from under your
own feet."</p>

<p>She met his eagerness with gratitude.</p>

<p>"I thank you so warmly, you and Dr. Lushington. You have made
almost easy a task I dreaded very greatly. But here I cannot be
shaken. I know I am right. I intend it to be her certificate."</p>

<p>They argued and entreated and the conference lasted until she
was all but exhausted, and the two men in a state of anxious
irritation which scarcely brooked another word. But she held to her
point. The courage which she had thought dying revived and came
back stronger and calmer than before. One concession at last she
made, and that, without difficulty when Dr. Lushington proposed it
because it commended itself at once to her reason as a safeguard if
their prophecies of evil resulting from her mercy should be
fulfilled.</p>

<p>It was resolved that in case of future need of clear record of
present events a statement should be drawn up, signed and attested,
relating her point of view, and her reasons for it. Her reasons
also for consenting to renew her intercourse with the person whose
reputation was affected by rumours never spread or countenanced by
Lady Byron. "Since nothing could so effectually preserve that
person's character as that intercourse, Lady Byron, for the motives
and reasons before mentioned, consented to renew it." So it was
phrased. This statement with its various clauses was eventually
signed and attested by herself, Dr. Lushington, Colonel Doyle and
Mr. Robert Wilmot, Byron's first cousin, and was then placed in
safe keeping, Dr. Lushington, still with some difficulty,
withdrawing his embargo on the renewal of intercourse.</p>

<p>"You will remember I still warmly disapprove it," he said. "I
foresee nothing but danger to yourself from it."</p>

<p>As he and Colonel Doyle left the hotel and went slowly down the
street, the Colonel spoke his mind.</p>

<p>"I think we should never have agreed. We have delivered Lady
Byron to the wolves. Remember it is not only the two principals who
are concerned. This affair will make an enormous noise; and all
Byron's sycophants and toadies will form a party yelling for his
wife's blood. The rumours will be traced to her and it will
eventually be averred that she invented them and then shrank from
facing the consequence of her own evil speaking. She will be set
down as his moral murderess and that of Mrs. L. And I am bound to
own that her reserved quiet and coldness offer a kind of testimony
to the theory that she is unfeeling. That will be travestied into a
selfish care for her own comfort without any regard to the ruin
dealt out to him. It is a bad business. I foresee a life of cruel
suffering for her&mdash;poor young woman."</p>

<p>Dr. Lushington walked along with his eyes on the pavement,
thinking aloud rather than talking.</p>

<p>"Her husband will not spare her. His pen will be vitriol instead
of ink for her. And as for Mrs. L.&mdash;forgiveness and protection will
but inflame the sting to her. She will hate with the weak poison of
a weak mind&mdash;never attacking Lady Byron herself, but permitting the
false deduction&mdash;the evasion of truth, and meanwhile taking
<i>all</i> that extraordinary generosity gives her."</p>

<p>"You are very right," said Colonel Doyle. "Quite certainly the
best, the only hope for Lady Byron's peace of mind is that public
opinion should drive them from the country and together. If that
happens, all is well."</p>

<p>"What different notions of well and ill may be held!" the other
answered with a meditative smile. "To the woman we have just left
that would be the consummation of grief. She will never permit it
to happen if she can help it. She will cling to the other with
every strength of mind and spirit, and she will get no thanks for
it."</p>

<p>"There is certainly much to be said for legal methods in
preference to sentiment," Colonel Doyle answered dryly. They had
come to the corner where their roads parted and stood for a moment
in the cold spring sunshine to finish the conversation. Curiously,
it was the man of law who hesitated to award the crown to the
law.</p>

<p>"I should like to discharge my conscience before we part. We are
both men of the world&mdash;you especially. And my profession is
calculated to promote a somewhat cynical view of human nature.
Well, I yield to none in my admiration of our legal methods, but I
cannot deny the existence of a higher law, come what will of it in
the world's eyes, and I consider that that young woman is one of
the most wonderful persons I have ever come across. There has not
been a thought for her own advantage all through. Her energy of
mind, the strength of her affections, the cool decision of her
judgment&mdash;I am in boundless admiration of her&mdash;of her heart and
intellect and <i>governed</i> mind. Most brightly does she shine in
this dark shade of sorrow."</p>

<p>"I partly agree&mdash;but you will see I am right. She has committed
herself to a life of cruel agitations for the sake of a romantic
self-sacrifice which none will credit. I still hope for the
solution of a flight and her remaining victorious on the
field."</p>

<p>Dr. Lushington apparently had not heard. He concluded
slowly:</p>

<p>"Her husband will lose much in this matter. He has drawn down a
terrible retribution upon himself. But his worst, his irreparable,
loss is his wife."</p>

<p>"He will certainly never know that!" the other retorted
briskly.</p>

<p>"He may. Who can foresee all the designs of fate?" Dr.
Lushington replied, and so with friendly greetings and farewells
each took his own way.</p>

<p>The woman they had left sat down and painfully spent an hour
writing and rewriting a few words to Augusta Leigh.</p>

And petrifies the feeling"<br>
<br>
&mdash;Burns.</p>

<p>The storm broke in thunder and Byron met it at first with wild
defiance. There were moments when he gladdened in it as a man
standing on a mountain peak may exult in the roar of great winds
and the blown torrents of rain lashing his face and sweeping away
all but the indomitable soul within.</p>

<p>"Let them come on!" he cried to George Byron. "Let them do their
worst and I shall glory in it."</p>

<p>Had not the very aim of his verse been to raise mysterious
images of horror, the spectres of the soul made visible to daunt
the daylight? Why should he now shrink from the black evangel he
had preached and the world received with more than
approval&mdash;delight? He had made his own law and might defy the
hide-bound contentions of lesser men.</p>

<p>In this mood his friend, John Cam Hobhouse, found him when he
made his way to Piccadilly. His position set him above the
sycophants of the Byron court, and, a man of the world by birth and
inclination, he not only saw the avalanche swaying to its fall, but
saw no reason why, as an office of friendship (such friendship as
Byron permitted to men), he should not speak plainly before it
crashed in ruin irretrievable. Besides, no man who knew the facts
and had the opportunity of hearing the point of view of Lady
Byron's family but must feel that a woman who had already suffered
almost to death should be spared the misery of greater
publicity.</p>

<p>As he slowly ascended the steps, revolving what he had come to
say, it was as clear to him as the morning light that Byron must be
made to face temporary ruin, must submit in silence and retreat
with his disgrace lest worse should befall him.</p>

<p>He found him sitting, apparently lost in the cloudland of
composition. He looked up with a motion of surprise. All that might
be pose, for it was an appointment, and Hobhouse felt the inner
dart of distrust which so often assailed him and others who
understood the man. What was behind it all if pose were
subtracted?</p>

<p>He wondered what the hitherto idolatrous millions would think of
their idol could they have entered with his knowledge and beheld
the radiant Apollo in the privacy of his study. Would they have
pitied or loathed, scorned or worshipped? God knows, he thought!
Who can decipher the riddle of the general mind?</p>

<p>There was pose also in his array. As a dressing gown he wore
some glowing Oriental garment, sheening like the feathers of a
humming bird, flowered with purple and gold, needing only the
addition of turban and yataghan to make him a most splendid young
Emir of Damascus or Basra. He looked extraordinarily handsome,
though so thin and worn by recent illness that his face appeared
rather the white fire of the spirit within than merely human. The
expression changed and flickered like flame in a wind, there was a
dying fire in the eyes, those eyes, piercing and terrible, which
captured the imagination of all on whom he had willed to exert
their spell.</p>

<p>"So you have chosen to come at last!" was the greeting. "I began
to think you too were one of the rats to quit the sinking ship. But
you may all spare your trouble. Sink it shall not, I swear, while
the breath is in my body. They can only take what I care nothing
for. What I have made for myself no one shall take from me."</p>

<p>Hobhouse, with his neat precision more strongly than ever upon
him in contrast with these elemental passions, took his seat, laid
his gloves on the table and prepared to speak with all his weight
of wisdom, gazing calmly into the haggard, brilliant eyes before
him.</p>

<p>"My dear Byron, I delayed from motives of friendship, and, as
you know, I have written to you. My object was to collect the
general suffrages of people in a position to know what your course
should be. No, no&mdash;I beg of you!&mdash;(waving a protesting hand)&mdash;don't
enter into the merits of the case. I have heard both points of view
<i>ad nauseam</i>. I have no wish to discuss the question as to
whether you or Lady Byron are in the right. I see you in a position
of admitted danger, and I wish, if acceptable to make a few
suggestions as to retrieval. Such is my simple aim."</p>

<p>Byron rounded his shoulders and hunched himself over the table,
dropping his head upon his arms in an attitude of most sullen and
unwilling submission. The rebel was in every line of his figure.
His face was hidden.</p>

<p>Taking silence for consent, Hobhouse proceeded
dispassionately.</p>

<p>"What we have to consider is whether there is any possibility of
restoring you to society in the future. The present I regard as
finished&mdash;done!" He made an expressive gesture as though he whiffed
something daintily away with his fingers and a breath from a pursed
mouth. Byron never looked up.</p>

<p>"The Noel family is resolute and marches like one man and woman
to the sacrifice, and, to be candid, the opinion of society
supports them. No, no&mdash;again I must decline to discuss the ethics
of the case."</p>

<p>Once more Byron dropped his angrily raised head.</p>

<p>"I too have friends," came in a muffled voice from beneath the
shelter of his arms.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I am myself one of them. But such persons as make
their court by counselling you to proceed in resistance, and by
abusing the other side, are enemies, call themselves what they
will."</p>

<p>"My attorney left me last evening, strongly advising
fighting."</p>

<p>"Your attorney! My dear Byron, he has been one of your ghastly
mistakes. You should have had one of the leading men, impeccable&mdash;a
man of the highest repute. Can you fail to see&mdash;can I not make you
understand that the more you now act with the Noels, the more hope
for the future, and the more their unblemished character will
protect you?"</p>

<p>He dropped his arms and sprang to his feet, his face livid with
passion.</p>

<p>"What? Act with the devils who have ruined me, with the fiend
who spread such rumours of her husband and of one to whom she has
the deepest cause to be grateful-one who never injured her? I'll
die before I'll concede an inch."</p>

<p>He raved on while Hobhouse listened, gazing calmly into the
caverns in the glowing coals, until the storm had spent itself and
Byron dropped, half exhausted into his chair.</p>

<p>"What you say might have weight, my friend, if a single rumour
had taken rise from your wife or the Noels, but there you are
wrong. There are several foci. Melbourne House is one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Melbourne House! Caroline Lamb?"</p>

<p>"Caroline Lamb certainly. She appears to alternate between
calumny and the remains of her old attachment. You know her nervous
instability. I am told she is projecting a novel with yourself as
the hero. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>But for some minutes Hobhouse could not go on. Her name was
flame to tinder, and Byron spoke in a fashion "which reduced even
Hobhouse's cool indifference to the silence of distaste. He
shrugged his shoulders as though he shook off the drops of
vitriol.</p>

<p>"She came to the Albany," Byron continued, "and, finding me out,
wrote the words 'Remember me' on a bit of paper and left them, and
I sent her this&mdash;<i>this</i>, to sear her shame on her forehead for
all the world to see!"</p>

<p>Gasping with excitement, he flung over his papers and thrust
before Hobhouse the famous verses which all the world knows:</p>

<p class="poem">"Remember thee! remember thee!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Lethe quench life's burning stream,<br>
Remorse and shame shall cling to thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And haunt thee like a feverish dream.<br>
<br>
"Remember thee&mdash;aye, doubt it not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy husband too shall think of thee;<br>
By neither shalt thou be forgot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou <i>false</i> to him, thou <i>fiend</i> to me."</p>

<p>Hobhouse cast an eye over them.</p>

<p>"Very stinging," he said coldly, "and for all I know, deserved,
but I shall ever hold it a mistake to take the public into one's
confidence on one's amours. However, as I was about to say when you
broke in, there are several foci of rumour, and it is said you
committed yourself and the other person involved to more than one
lady in writing. That's as may be [noting the gesture of dissent]
but it is certain that I myself and many others have heard you at
Holland House and elsewhere give vent to opinions which will help
to damn you now. You may recall an evening at Rogers's with a
Scotchman and others present. 'Nay, never shake thy gory locks at
me [laughing]. Thou canst not say <i>I</i> did it!' But <i>you</i>
certainly did. Our object must be to worst the gossips in the long
run by bending to the storm now. On that point you will hear me if
you are wise."</p>

<p>It took nearly half an hour of argument before Byron would even
consent to listen&mdash;a strain which left him pitifully exhausted,
and, with one of his incredible transitions, quiet as a child with
its storm of passion quenched in submission. He sat, at last,
looking palely at Hobhouse.</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?"</p>

<p>Hobhouse crossed his legs and became didactic.</p>

<p>"The points to consider, my dear Byron, are as follows: You are
for the time a ruined man. Money also. If I mistake not, there is
an execution in the house at the moment. I believe I recognized a
face familiar at Sheridan's as I came up the stair. Your health is
sunk. Your literary fame also may be said to have suffered in so
far as you unfortunately complicated it with your present
distresses. But that is left to you. Were I in your position I
should act as follows: Agree immediately and courteously to the
separation. Surely you belittle yourself by clinging where you are
rejected? Recommend the other lady in question to leave your house
and return to her husband and family&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. Lady Byron approved, nay, insisted she should remain
here."</p>

<p>"I am familiar with the circumstances. Still, that is what
<i>I</i> should do. I would take these steps with the utmost
calmness and courtesy to all concerned. I would lavish especial
courtesy on Lady Byron and her family. I would then leave England
for a time <i>without</i> first appearing in society. And I would,
while abroad, consolidate my literary fame and make it dazzling,
giving my wife to understand that when she relented I was at her
disposal. And I should be particular to give her no cause of
complaint with other women."</p>

<p>There was a faint flicker of interest in Byron's face.</p>

<p>"As to fame&mdash;I could do that," he said.</p>

<p>Hobhouse was brisk and encouraging at once.</p>

<p>"My dear man, who better? And then, when all these animosities
have cooled and the past is forgotten, take cautious steps toward
reconciliation and your game is won."</p>

<p>"Won? And I am to crawl and ask pardon at the feet of my moral
murderess? She is murdering me as surely as ever Clytemnestra did
Agamemnon, and as treacherously. Never in life or death will I see
her false face again."</p>

<p>Hobhouse looked reflectively at him.</p>

<p>"Your wife loves you still. Nothing else can explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I was going to say her extraordinary forbearance&mdash;her silence.
You may come to think very differently of her one day."</p>

<p>"Damn her forbearing silence. It is ruining me. If she did not
start the rumours, her silence endorses them."</p>

<p>On that point Hobhouse could not be explicit. He resumed:</p>

<p>"My gaze is on the future. Let yours be the same. Act as I
advise. Be swept away by no gusts of passion. And above all&mdash;above
<i>all</i>, I beg you, withhold your pen from any comments on your
private affairs either in verse or prose. Trifle as it may seem,
your cruel insult to Lord Carlisle in 'English Bards' has never
been forgotten, and wings the dart even now. Be wise and all is not
lost. Now I must go. Do you promise to consider my advice?"</p>

<p>"I will promise to consider. After all, I have one consolation
which overpowers many miseries&mdash;if I am to lose my wife, my wife's
father keeps <i>his!</i> I ask no better vengeance. Lady Noel is a
devil."</p>

<p>On that they parted; Hobhouse, in a mild glow of
selfapprobation; Byron, exhausted in mind and body.</p>

<p>But it struck Hobhouse, on leaving, as extremely odd and
characteristic that Byron appeared to have no single thought of
regret or instinct of protection for the damaged reputation of his
fellow-sufferer. His interest apparently began and ended with his
own grievances.</p>

<p>The interview had two results and two only. Byron realized that
he had been mistaken in fighting against overwhelming odds. He
consented to the separation. Mrs. Leigh at last decided to brave
his displeasure and to leave the house in Piccadilly for her rooms
in St. James's Palace. She would not however retreat to her family
in the country, which seriously harmed her cause.</p>

<p>Her friends, meanwhile, including Mrs. Villiers, made earnest
appeals to Lady Byron for some declaration which should clear her
character and leave it stainless, and to these, inflexible in truth
as in mercy, she could only reply by disclaiming any share in the
rumours which had now swelled to a roar, and by affectionate
references to kind offices in the past. There were those who did
not think this sufficient; there were also those who considered
that such references, combined with Lady Byron's resolution still
to continue intercourse with her sister-in-law, were an ample
certificate of character. There it rested for the moment. She was
prepared to do anything for Augusta, who had taken a deeply injured
tone, short of giving her own authority for specific denials. That
was out of her power, and at that limit she stopped.</p>

<p>There was a desperate battle made by Byron's friends. Certainly
neither he nor they recognized on what an insecure foundation his
glory in England had rested, with what elements of doubt and
suspicion it had mingled, and with what relief from long restraint
disapproval and dislike broke forth. But it was in his nature to
pose and defy to the last and he was seconded.</p>

<p>A few days before the deed of separation was signed Lady Jersey
gave a large gathering for the purpose of replacing him in society
and invited Augusta also. Public courtesy and friendship were to
supply the certificate, for many of the greatest ladies in London
were to be present, and to pass through that court of honour would
all but constitute acquittal.</p>

<p>It was a terrible and complete failure. Ladies left each room in
droves as he entered it. Augusta was cut by Mrs. George Lamb,
representing Melbourne House, and by others. There was outlawry in
the air.</p>

<p>He had yielded on compulsion and not with his heart's agreement,
and anger, hatred, and scorn possessed his soul and shared it
between them. His last remaining hope was to make the world as
bitter a hell for his enemies as they had made it for him. There
was one weapon and one only of which they could not deprive him and
that he would use until it broke in his hand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was a thing to be done before he left
England&mdash;with which the last tenderness in his heart was bound up.
He wrote to his wife in April, 1816:</p>

<p class="letter">"More last words, not many, and such as you will
attend to&mdash;answer I do not expect nor does it import, but you will
hear me. I have just parted from Augusta, almost the last being you
had left me to part with, and the only unshattered tie of my
existence. Wherever I may go, and I am going far, you and I can
never meet again in this world nor in the next. Let this content
and atone. If any accident occurs to me be kind to her&mdash;if she is
then nothing&mdash;to her children. Be kind to her and hers, for never
has she spoken or acted otherwise towards you; she has ever been
your friend. This may seem valueless to one who now has so many; be
kind to her however and recollect that though it may have been an
advantage to you to have lost your husband, it is sorrow to her to
have the waters now, or the earth hereafter, between her and her
brother. I repeat it, for deep resentments have but half
recollections, that you once did promise me this much&mdash;do not
forget it."</p>

<p>She was little likely to forget it. Pity and affection and that
high thing rooted in her soul of which pity and affection are but
the visible blossoms had won that cause long before he pleaded. He
should indeed have turned the plea inward, for what world's injury
yet was left to be done to Augusta he himself was to do with cruel
pen and tongue.</p>

<p>The deed of separation was signed and what was written was
written. The moment of departure was near and "Childe Harold's"
barque once more upon the sea. He applied to the French Government
for a passport to travel through France, and it was refused unless
he bound himself to travel on an indicated route and to avoid
Paris. There was to be no refuge for him even in the land of
passionate theorists from whom he had imbibed much of his own moral
anarchy. Such conditions he haughtily refused. It was not the only
way out of England. The gate of Ostend stood open and the way
through Flanders and by the Rhine to the Lake of Geneva, then the
abode of literary stars like Madame de Stael and others who might
be supposed to soar above common prejudice.</p>

<p>He was now forging deliberately the armour of bitter levity
which was to be his protection for the rest of his life&mdash;a poor
protection of canvas and buckram, though it might deceive others
with its show of glittering steel. But there were moments of agony
as the last day of home drew near. He could not shut his own heart
to the mute appeal of things inanimate and beloved.</p>

<p>He stood almost alone. Augusta dared not approach him. He knew
that Caroline Lamb and others had broken the confidences he had
made them in the days of his pride. But a closer anguish was the
breaking of hope.</p>

<p>Never, never now, the house filled with happy guests, the
honour, love, obedience he had dreamed of once, with that which
should accompany old age, the trustful love of wife and children.
Yet this and more had been within his grasp. He knew well that in
wide England he could have chosen none more fitted to fill a great
position than his wife. Because she was in nature as in birth a
great lady she could have made his position strong and safe. She
was a part of the clanship of the great families of England, and
the power and influence she brought as her dower would have been
his. And she had loved him so truly, so tenderly, that he had
believed her love proof against every excess, and it was with a
ghastly amazement he realized that love's own hands may destroy
love against which many waters cannot prevail.</p>

<p class="poem">"Love, that if once his own hands guard his
head,<br>
The whole world's wrath and scorn shall not strike dead.<br>
Love, that if once his own hands dig his grave<br>
The whole world's pity and sorrow shall not save."</p>

<p>He had thrown it away for pleasures which in their very nature
age must disclaim, and the age to which he could look forward was
one of exile in foreign cities where mingled curiosity and
servility were the only emotions he was likely to excite. Loss,
loss, irrevocable and terrible, confronted him wherever he turned.
There is none but must pity that tremendous downfall.</p>

<p>The sea, foaming and heaving in storm, flung up a jewel now and
then on the sands beside the bitter spume and sea-wrack, and the
truth of her nobility of nature he knew in his inmost soul and
could not always deny. Possibly also, Augusta's description of his
"implacable foe" may have startled him for the moment. She
wrote:</p>

<p class="letter">"I never can describe Lady Byron's appearance to
you but by comparing it to what I should imagine a being of another
world. She is positively reduced to a skeleton, pale as ashes, a
deep hollow tone of voice, and a calm in her manner quite
supernatural. She received me kindly, but that really appeared the
only surviving feeling, all else was <i>death-like</i> calm. I can
never forget it&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>Yet that too Augusta was to forget when the time came. The
Byrons could forget much.</p>

<p>So she had received Augusta! That at least was kind. He felt
that. It touched him.</p>

<p>But the end was drawing very near. To the last he entertained a
wild and fitful hope that she might yet forgive. As he sat alone in
his empty room it was possible to dream that the door might open
softly and she might enter, not with reproaches (he could remember
little of any reproaches which had passed her lips until she had
been driven out), but quietly and with her own composure&mdash;the wife
who has a right to her husband's hearth and heart taking her
unquestioned place once more. If that could be, the pure ablution
of her presence&mdash;</p>

<p>"Serenely purest of her sex that live," as he himself had
written of her, would surely wash out the past and there might be
hope and a fresh beginning, and, if she would but be patient, some
attainment in years to come.</p>

<p>No. There was always himself&mdash;and another.</p>

<p>He left that miserable house towards the end of April, and with
his travelling servants and the young physician Polidori, went down
to Dover to superintend the packing of the vast travelling coach
which was to be the appanage of an English Milord honouring the
continent with his presence. Hobhouse and Scrope Davies went with
him so far upon his journey.</p>

<p>There was some fear of a popular outbreak against him, some ugly
mark of the public distaste. It was a singular scene when he left
England, the crowd scowling and lowering in a dangerous silence,
and standing about the dark corners of his inn, ladies in the dress
of chambermaids, panting to catch a glimpse of the fallen hero.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock he embarked, a ruined man. The crowd formed
itself into a lane on either side, and he walked between them,
assuming what carelessness he could. The fight was over and he was
vanquished.</p>

<p>Hobhouse and Davies stood to see him go, with their own thoughts
also. He waved his cap and the parting was over, the sea widening
between.</p>

<p>"God bless him for a gallant spirit and a kind one!" Hobhouse
wrote with unwonted emotion in his diary, and the heart will throb
to that pity while there is grief for human misery. The Byron curse
of heredity had fallen heavily on its unhappy children and no human
judgment can apportion blame even in cases more simple than
this.</p>

<p>So the night darkened down over the hard grey Dover cliffs,
which never but in sleep or waking dream would he ever see more.
The receding lights flickered fainter and farther, and as his
natural mother had so often rejected him as a helpless child, his
motherland also in her turn cast him out.</p>

<p>Darkness of the unknown on mingling night and sea, and scarcely
a glimmer of hope behind torn clouds.</p>

<p class="poem">"Once more upon the waters, yet once more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the waves bound beneath me as a steed<br>
That knows his rider. Welcome to their roar!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift be their guidance wheresoe'er it lead!<br>
Though the strained mast should quiver as a reed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rent canvas fluttering strew the gale,<br>
Still must I on, for I am as a weed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flung from the rock on ocean's foam to sail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where'er the surge may sweep, the tempest's breath
prevail."</p>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER 20. ECLIPSE</h2>

<p class="poem">"Blest in her place indeed is she,<br>
And I, departing, seem to be<br>
Like the strange waif that seems to run<br>
A few days flaming near the sun,<br>
Then carries back, through boundless night,<br>
Its lessening memory of light."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Coventry Patmore.</p>

<p>That same day his wife went down into the country, the life she
had hoped lying behind her, a broken thing. She too had had her
dream of the great house and high duties accomplished and the
journey through life hand in hand, their children about them and
the end coming serenely in a noble peace. All was gone, and for
ever.</p>

<p>Friends gathered about her, imploring her not to waste her youth
in hopeless lamentation, to turn her mind to the consolations. Much
was taken, but much remained: her child, all other family loves but
the one, the serenity of a guiltless conscience, the joys of the
intellect and the spirit. And other good things would return,
shyly, slowly, but certainly. The society of her friends would
delight her once again, the country peace of Kirkby Mallory would
soothe her. The world would be good to her with all its healing
influences. Why despair? It was indeed a duty to rejoice in
remembering from what she had escaped, to what she was
returning.</p>

<p>Unanswerable by reason, but she knew and they could not. The
very strength of her nature was its danger now. She knew that
also.</p>

<p>Later Byron wrote to her:</p>

<p class="letter">"Yours has been a bitter connection to me in
every sense: it would have been better for me never to have been
born than to have ever seen you. This sounds harsh, but is it not
true? And recollect, I do not mean that you Were my
<i>intentional</i> evil genius, but an instrument for my
destruction; and you yourself have suffered too (poor thing) in the
agency, as the lightning perishes in the instant with the oak that
it strikes."</p>

<p>But it was she who was the oak stricken to the core, never again
to put forth delicate leafage, stark and bare under the fragrant
breath of breezes, mute when the birds sang in green bowers of
spring and all the world was youth and bliss. It was he who was the
lightning, again and often to flash destruction, resumed only into
his dark cloud for further powers of harm.</p>

<p>A desert stretched before her. At first there was the relief of
breathing purer air: the storm was past, might she not hope for a
clear shining after rain? But she was numbed by long suffering and
the imagination of what might have been was all that was left. The
dream house, set in waving woods, rose warm and kind in that
imagination&mdash;but with shut windows, her face pressed hopelessly
against them. Dream children flitted down the garden ways, their
arms full of flowers less beautiful than they, yet all receding
into far distances. And never in any waking dream could she see him
without a presence beside him which darkened the day. In sleep,
sometimes, they were together as long, long ago; his lips touched
hers, his hands were clasped in hers, she saw the beauty of his
face, pale, most piercingly sweet, most passionately beloved, and
the unspeakable bliss of reunion submerged her in a heavenly quiet.
But the dawn, stealing coldly into the room, brought with it, hand
in hand, memory, and the true name of memory was Desolation.</p>

<p>Her mother saw the danger and wrote to her with tender, homely
insight.</p>

<p class="letter">"I neither do nor can expect that you should not
feelr and deeply feel; but I have sometimes thought (and that not
only lately) that your mind is too high wrought&mdash;too much so for
this world. Only the grander objects engage your thoughts. Your
character is like <i>proof spirits</i>&mdash;not fit for common use. I
could almost wish the tone of it lowered nearer to the level of us
everyday people, and that you would endeavour to take some interest
in everyday concerns. Believe me, by degrees you will feel the
benefit of it. I have not slept on a bed of roses thro' my life, I
have had afflictions, and serious ones&mdash;yet in my sixty-fifth year
I have endeavoured to rally, and shall rally if you do so. Now, my
love, here is a Sunday's sermon for you, and here it shall
end."</p>

<p>It was grievous to her, and naturally, to see her daughter, with
all her gifts and graces, flinging the world aside and seeking her
only relief in philanthropy and a service to the poor which,
according to Lady Noel's conservative ideas, should by no means
occupy all the time and thoughts of a lady of quality, though it
had its proper place in the schedule of her duties.</p>

<p>Of the purpose which most engaged her mind Anne spoke little or
nothing to her parents and it was impossible for them to guess the
pale, fixed determination with which she set her face to it as the
only hope, the only good, to be salvaged from the immeasurable evil
which had overtaken, not only herself, but all concerned in it. For
Byron she had no hope except in some such unimaginable stroke of
fate as might shatter all his illusions and bring him naked and
broken for the first time face to face with truth. Could even that
be hoped when she remembered through what he had lived and how?
What scenes she could recall as she sat alone in gathering
twilights and pallid dawns! He, calling himself a monster and
throwing himself in agony at her feet&mdash;"Astonished at the return of
virtue, my tears, I believe, flowed over my face and I said,
'Byron, all is forgiven. Never, never shall you hear of it more.'
He started up and, folding his arms while he looked at me, burst
into laughter. 'What do you mean?' said I. 'Only a philosophical
experiment: that's all,' he said. 'I wished to ascertain the value
of your resolutions.'"</p>

<p>Hopeless, out of all reach! But her child was still left and a
battle still to fight&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"We, like sentries, are compelled to stand<br>
In starless nights,"</p>

<p>and, exhausted with the struggle, she gathered up her arms once
more.</p>

<p>She knew as well as Dr. Lushington and Colonel Doyle that it
would be entirely to her own advantage if Augusta, driven by
desperation and contumely, fled to him. Her clear brain never
misled her on that point, but she had determined it should not be
if she could stand in the way. When the devil plays dice with God
for a soul, both sides need to be wary, and she was resolved she
would not fail for want of circumspection. She had leisure for much
thought in the time of exhaustion after the first battle and she
used it in preparing for the second encounter.</p>

<p>Considering her course, it was clear that perfect frankness to
Augusta, coupled with the assurance of her support, was the first
step. Without that they could not act together and the battle would
be lost before it began. But the responsibility at this point was
too great to be taken alone and she resolved to consult Augusta's
oldest and best-beloved friend, Mrs. Villiers, and Robert John
Wilmot, Byron's cousin, both of whom were now acquainted with all
the circumstances. The man and woman, viewing the case from their
different standpoints, alike urged her to write as she proposed.
So, strengthened in her own conviction, she wrote, stating her
position and promising her support.</p>

<p>Rumour at the time was in terrible earnest about Mrs. Leigh, and
she knew it. She knew also that though it was impossible to commit
Anne Byron to any guarantee of her innocence, her support, even as
offered, would be vital. She met her sister-in-law in London and
made a complete confession, thereby binding her to her rescue. She
understood her perfectly well.</p>

<p>The next step was to make Augusta's oldest and truest friend her
auxiliary. If Mrs. Villiers, knowing the facts, would use her
influence with Augusta and in the great world, it would be
invaluable; and also, Mrs. Villiers, living in London, would be
much better aware of social drifts and tendencies than she herself
could be. She came to London for the consultation.</p>

<p>It was indeed a strange meeting for those two women, both loving
the third, both resolute to save her from herself and from
destruction, both fully aware that the foundation they hoped to
build on was itself shifting sand, but yet hoping all things.</p>

<p>Each bore very visible tokens of grief and anxiety. Mrs.
Villiers was shocked at the change Augusta had herself described in
Anne Byron. The colour and light of youth were gone. It was as
when the sun dies off a landscape and a dull cloud overhangs
it&mdash;nothing is changed, yet all is changed: there is death where
there was life.</p>

<p>She met her with tender little cares, but soon realized that in
her isolation of the soul such things did not reach her, she was
entirely preoccupied with the struggle before her, and anything
that concerned herself or anything outside it seemed to have no
interest whatever. It alarmed Mrs. Villiers. Wise as she was kind,
doubts assailed her whether it could be a wholesome preoccupation
for the pale woman before her. Merciful and generous beyond
praise&mdash;and yet&mdash;should she not release her mind from the long
tension and fix it on simpler, happier things? Might there not be
grave dangers for her own outlook on life unless some escape and
forgetfulness came her way? The thought was a fluttering anxiety in
her mind as the subject was opened.</p>

<p>"I have thought of it night and day," Anne Byron said, taking
her hat off and passing her hand over her brow with a wearied
gesture. "And I knew your help would be the most valuable of all,
for you understand her thoroughly. So I have come to you. Has she
written?"</p>

<p>"First let me put a cushion for your head. You look so tired and
your eyes have no sleep in them&mdash;nothing but pictures of grief and
care. O, it has been much too great a strain for you&mdash;and this new
one will be very great too! She is such a shifting, helpless
creature at best."</p>

<p>"Don't think of me&mdash;what does that matter? Tell me of her."</p>

<p>"She has written in a tone of despair. She feels that all is
lost and since nothing can keep her afloat in society she may as
well sink and have done with the struggle. A kind of apathy."</p>

<p>"That was exactly what I feared: the feeling that nothing
matters any longer&mdash;and when it is combined with his influence over
her, I fear very much how it will end."</p>

<p>"And so do I. Much will depend upon the attitude of her friends.
I saw Lady Granville not long since and she told me you had begged
that she would return to her former kindness for Augusta, and that
she could not resist your plea."</p>

<p>Anne smiled for the first time.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was good of her! I am glad. There is great kindness in
people when they know they can help. That will give me courage to
ask others. But what did Augusta say?"</p>

<p>"It was the tone of despair. She said her own happiness was now
at an end and she could only look to that of her friends. But
though she writes these things and I am sure feels them at the
moment, I doubt whether she has the power to be unhappy long and
continuously. It is difficult to explain, but I have always felt a
want in her, lovable and sweet as she is&mdash;as if there were nothing
stable to hold on to."</p>

<p>"I have felt that too. She feels keenly at the moment but no
feeling lasts. All is on the surface. At least&mdash;I should say, I
<i>did</i> think this, but surely all is changed now and this awful
grief must create some deep and lasting change?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Villiers looked meditatively toward the sunny window where
the curtain waved in a faint summer breeze.</p>

<p>"My dear Lady Byron, I hope I shall not shock you if I say, 'Can
the Ethiopian change his skin?' Augusta was born a Byron and it is
my firm belief that what is bred in the bone&mdash;you know the proverb.
They have never been like other people. You used a phrase I have
not forgotten when we discussed her before. You said, in answer to
some remark of mine, 'If she thinks in this way, it is moral
idiocy.' That summed up what I believe of Augusta. I believe her to
be a moral idiot, without any balance in her notions of right and
wrong, and I fear, though she may write just what she happens to
feel at the moment, that there is no real resolution in any
direction to build upon."</p>

<p>The other looked at her with deep sadness.</p>

<p>"You think I shall have no influence with her? My mother always
says, 'Beware of her. If I know anything of human nature, she does
and must hate you.' Do you think that?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't think she can hate any one or anything&mdash;better a
thousand times if she could! She may not love you&mdash;I don't think
she loves any one, but&mdash;But why should I pronounce? What do I know?
Our plain duty is to do the best we can for her. He is devilry in
human shape, and she little understands the desperation of trusting
to him. Lady Melbourne said here the other day that they would end
in mutual hatred and reproaches for their inevitable wretchedness,
and I believe her to be absolutely right."</p>

<p>"Then surely, surely, however unpromising, we must cling to our
hope? He is with that unfortunate Mr. Shelley at Geneva, whose
terrible opinions and practice will only confirm his own. And they
are not alone&mdash;I hear from Augusta that he has written to her in a
kind of exultation about some woman named Clairmont who has
followed him there. But you know her obscure, hinting style of
writing, and it is very difficult either to know her mind or what
she wishes to convey."</p>

<p>Mrs. Villiers shook her head.</p>

<p>"She wishes to convey as little as possible and to surround
herself with a cloud of words out of which she can escape in any
direction she pleases. It is natural. It will never be changed.
Have you heard lately?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She told me you had spoken of me as her guardian angel and
said she was sure I was so. If only I could be! I think I
understand her exactly as you do. The most promising feature is
that there is nothing malignant in her. She is only weak."</p>

<p>"And unprincipled. The Byrons lay no stress on education in
principles, and they scarcely come by inheritance in that
family."</p>

<p>There was a long pause, each occupied with her own thoughts. At
last Mrs. Villiers said slowly:</p>

<p>"Would you think me intrusive if I asked you a question, Lady
Byron, which is much on my mind? I have more deeply admired and
venerated your whole conduct in this matter than any words can
convey. I think it wonderful, almost out of the reach of poor human
nature. What I should like to ask is this: On what is it
founded?"</p>

<p>"The wish to save her&mdash;what else?"</p>

<p>"But what is that wish founded on? In other words&mdash;if it is not
an intrusion&mdash;what are your religious views on the question? I
should deeply value your confidence there."</p>

<p>There was hesitation. Very prompt to act when she had considered
the cost, she was much less prompt to speak, and above all to speak
on her deepest feelings. She believed, indeed, that with many
people they evaporate in a vague perfume of sentiment if the hidden
vial of the heart is opened to the air of common day. Mrs.
Villiers's eyes were fixed on her in earnest inquiry. She added
gently:</p>

<p>"You are heavily blamed and the air is full of charges of moral
cruelty against you. You know Augusta herself gave currency to
those. And to some people, sometimes even to myself, your conduct
seems an almost incredible romance of self-sacrifice. You never
attempt to defend yourself at their cost though they invariably do
at yours, yet I am told that in the conventional sense of the word
you are scarcely a Christian. On what ground, then, do you act as
you do? It would be an assistance to me to know."</p>

<p>Even thus questioned, she answered lamely. In words it was
difficult to make a good case for her faith then and later. In
practice, with the reservation of a certain stern aloofness which
was bound to grow upon such a nature so placed, she made a far
better. Her spoken code was too rigorous, her deeds were mercy's
own.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Villiers, I have hardly tried to state those things
to myself&mdash;how can I tell you? I am no lover of creeds. They seem
to me the prisons of the soul, which sits locked behind them so
fettered that it cannot even long for free air. But just as
naturally as wings grow feathered on the bird, so if one reflects
and loves, I believe the needful creed for oneself comes to one
quite naturally and simply and wings the soul. Mine is not drawn
from any book, except in the sense that all one has read and known
sinks into the heart and tinges thought, just as the falling leaves
of many trees make a rich soil for the growth of other plants."</p>

<p>Her eyes were so touching in their almost blindly groping look
of introspection that Mrs. Villiers's own moistened. No truer,
sincerer soul could ever be dreamed, she knew that well. Its
failures might well be nobler than the successes of others.</p>

<p>"It should be a rich soil indeed in your mind," she said; "for
you have read and thought more than many women double your
age."</p>

<p>"I believe most firmly in the innate goodness of mankind. If men
and women could see themselves as they are, there would be no
failures in goodness. But we falsify ourselves by believing in
wickedness until goodness escapes us and we are left in our
miserable illusion."</p>

<p>Mrs. Villiers was a little bewildered.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you deny that the heart of man is deceitful
and desperately wicked? Surely we are taught&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believe that the heart of man is originally noble as it came
from the hand of the Creator, and that if you can convince people
of this truth, you have saved them. They have only to realize that
they are born from the Fount of all nobleness, noble themselves by
inheritance. And when they realize that they have but to be what
they are in truth, all is well. But I also believe that we
all&mdash;young people especially&mdash;need a stern and painful training.
The pleasures of the world so quickly foster all the deadly
illusions which hide us from the light! Forgive me for my poor
speaking. I must not inflict my creed upon you, for you are a soul
that turns naturally to the light, and you will find it&mdash;or have
found it."</p>

<p>There was another long silence, the silence of deep sympathy and
understanding. Presently Anne changed the subject to Augusta's
needs and cares, and they discussed them until the chime of the
little ormolu clock on the mantelpiece roused her. She stood up
then, white and wearied, and held out her hand. Mrs. Villiers
looked at her with such earnest tenderness that it drew a last word
to her lips.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Villiers, I see you are troubled about me, but you
must not be. You perhaps cannot conceive faith outside a collective
body, a church, and because you see me alone, you think I may not
have the faith which will support me. That is not so. My danger
will be lest I should exaggerate the faith that is in me and live
in too narrow a circle of certain deeds and thoughts. Faith may
imprison me if it has not the wide eyes of perfect charity. I have
so much to learn! Pray for me, that I may never forget the greatest
of these is charity."</p>

<p>Holding hands, they stood for a moment. Mrs. Villiers said in a
whisper, "I will pray."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Dr. Lushington still persisted in his aversion to the course she
was taking. He thought it almost frenzied selfsacrifice and
believed it would lead to no eventual good, even for Mrs. Leigh.
When they met shortly afterwards, he made another protest.</p>

<p>"There are worse things for a woman than to damn herself
socially. My dear Lady Byron, look the matter in the face. What you
are forcing upon her is an existence of shifts, evasions and
pretences&mdash;the very faults to which she is most naturally liable.
Let the matter alone, let her follow her star. She may need the
very stern lessons that neither you nor any other can teach her.
The life you propose can teach her nothing other than to walk on
the tight-rope of public opinion, balancing herself in a perpetual
anxiety to keep upright."</p>

<p>She looked at him with the transparent sincerity which made her
gaze more beautiful than beauty.</p>

<p>"But did you think it was the social side I considered, Dr.
Lushington? Oh, no! If she elected to make a public atonement, to
choose a life of retirement and penitence in the face of the world,
I would support and honour her to my last breath. It is the
spiritual fall I dread. If she were driven from England by her
fears&mdash;to what a life!&mdash;what hope for her spiritually?"</p>

<p>"My dear Madam, how can you or any judge what is good for any
person spiritually? The sharp medicine of the life you debar her
from might be her cure eventually, whereas you cosset and pet and
protect&mdash;No, no. I have seen what I may call a cruel surgery
perform cures which all the tender nursing in the world had failed
to effect."</p>

<p>"But her husband, her children&mdash;the misery of her friends!"</p>

<p>"Her children? Will her example and protection at home be the
nest you would choose for a child of your own? Her husband&mdash;a
careless prodigal. Her friends? Do our friends continue more than a
nine daays' grief in most cases, and will not the tight-rope
balancing be productive of very serious discomfort to them? No, my
dear lady, you will deeply injure yourself and you will not advance
your <i>protégée</i> spiritually if I know anything of her and of
you. I own her to be a charming woman&mdash;her very childishness and
pagan levity are a part of her charm&mdash;but do they afford any
promise for the future? I still feel strongly all the objections I
expressed."</p>

<p>She was silent, with closed lips: none the less rooted in the
opinion which was fast becoming an obsession with her. Dr.
Lushington's view appeared to her cruelly worldly and perhaps she
could not appraise it with the wide-eyed charity she could bring to
human suffering (which, indeed, she was inclined to overestimate).
There are many compensations even in wickedness which the good who
divorce themselves entirely from worldly wisdom may not perceive,
and there are also many moments when it is much easier to be good
than wise. Of these she had her full share. She would in no case
have wavered, but Mrs. Villiers's support encouraged her, and that
of another and most unexpected convert still more. For Colonel
Doyle wrote to her:</p>

<p class="letter">"Your feelings I perfectly understand; I will
even <i>whisper</i> to you I approve. But you must remember that
your position is very extraordinary, and though when we have
sufficiently deliberated and decided, we should pursue our course
without embarrassing ourselves with the consequences, yet we should
not neglect the means of fully justifying ourselves if the
necessity be ever imposed on us. I see the possibility of a
contingency under which the fullest explanation of the motives and
grounds of your conduct may be necessary. If you obtain an
acknowledgment of the facts and if your motives are, as you seem to
think, properly appreciated, I think on the whole we shall have
reason to rejoice that you have acted as you have done. The step
you have taken was attended with great risk, and I could not have
originally advised it. I cannot dismiss from my mind the
experiences we have had, nor so far forget the very serious
embarrassment we were under from the effects of your too confiding
disposition as not to implore you to bear in mind the importance of
securing yourself from eventual danger. If that be attained, I
shall approve and applaud all the kindness you can show."</p>

<p>It could not but encourage her that this experienced man of the
world should write thus. She forgot that his ideas and her own as
to what were necessary precautions might differ (and they differed
not only considerably, but vitally) and went her way strengthened
and calm.</p>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER 21. EXILE</h2>

<p class="poem">"For this should drive me from my home and land,<br>
And bid me wander to the extreme verge<br>
Of all the earth...I curse-tormented still<br>
Am driven from land to land before the scourge<br>
The Gods hold over me."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Aeschylus.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Augusta wrote perpetually what Byron called her
"<i>damned crinkum-crankum</i>," enveloping herself, her actions
and hopes and those of other people in such a haze of words and
phrases that even to guess her meaning was sometimes impossible.
She appeared more vacillating than ever, and at last, in the fear
that she might leave England, it was agreed, by Mrs. Villiers's
especial counsel, to inform her how completely Byron had committed
her in his confidences to other women.</p>

<p>That, to a certain extent, influenced her and probably sank the
balance in her mind against flight. She wrote coldly to Geneva and
had replies written in overwhelming anger. It was on her account
principally, he said, that he had given way at all and signed the
separation, believing they would endeavour to drag her into it.</p>

<p>Again and again he besought her to shake the dust of England
from her feet as he had done and join him abroad. But under her
"obscure hinting style of writing, full of megrims and mysteries,"
as he called it, he could at last distinguish two facts; the one,
that she was prepared to risk no more for him publicly; the other,
that his wife's influence was behind much that she wrote. He
scoffed fiercely at Augusta and her platitudes. "As you observe
with equal truth and novelty, we are none of us immortal," and so
forth, alternately mocking and cajoling. His immediate vengeance on
her and others was always his pen.</p>

<p>Of his wife and her family he wrote with ferocity. She was "the
infernal fiend" whose destruction he should yet see. His references
to them in his letters to Moore, Moore has judged best to express
in the peace of asterisks. But he promised Augusta, much to her
alarm, that as regarded his wife, her parents, and his own cousins,
George Byron and Robert Wilmot, "not a fibre of their hearts should
remain unsearched by fire." And fanning the flame of his soul to
fury, he prepared to write. Europe&mdash;not England only&mdash;should be
spectator of the miseries they had inflicted on him and his
vengeance.</p>

<p>Europe was disposed to passionate interest. As the sublime
Goethe at Weimar declared: "The poignant drama of the separation
was so poetical in its circumstances and the mystery in which it
was involved that if he had invented it he could hardly have had a
more fortunate subject for his genius."</p>

<p>In this opinion the world agreed and lent an attentive ear. All
that fell from his lips or his pen was seized, commented on, passed
from hand to hand, and furious armies of partisans were formed on
one side or the other.</p>

<p>Few enough on his wife's, however. He raged for the benefit of
the gallery of Europe. She was dumb, and her silence blunted the
weapons in the hands of her friends.</p>

<p>At this time his mind was nothing but a chaos of frantic railing
against every one but himself. For him alone right was to be wrong
and evil good. And the rage of knowing that in the contest for
Augusta his wife had won a temporary victory dipped his pen in
fire.</p>

<p>In Pope's best manner he wrote a vitriolic satire against the
unfortunate Mrs. Clermont, and then towered like a hawk to fall and
strike nobler prey with the "Farewell" to his wife which gave their
story to the public with his own gloss upon it.</p>

<p>But the trouble with these poems and their insidious attack was,
as always, that he had never been a gentleman. Reproaches,
resentment, were useless&mdash;he could not understand. The radical
insincerity meant nothing to him.</p>

<p>And never were words better calculated to alienate all sympathy
from her and draw it to himself. Women wept over it, and, with
Madame de Stael, felt they might easily have borne her light
sorrows to have that irresistible melancholy of music laid at their
feet. It caused exactly the revulsion of feeling in his favour
which he aimed at.</p>

<p class="poem">Fare thee well, and if for ever<br>
Then for ever, fare thee well.<br>
Even if unforgiving, never<br>
'Gainst thee shall my heart rebel.<br>
Would that breast were bared before thee<br>
Where thy head so oft hath lain<br>
While that placid sleep came o'er thee<br>
Which thou ne'er canst know again.<br>
Would that breast by thee glanced over<br>
Every inmost thought could show!<br>
Then thou wouldst at last discover<br>
'Twas not well to spurn it so.<br>
Though my many faults defaced me<br>
Could no other arm be found,<br>
Than the arm which once embraced me,<br>
To inflict a cureless wound?<br>
Yet, oh, yet, thyself deceive not;<br>
Love may sink by slow decay,<br>
But by sudden wrench, believe not<br>
Hearts can thus be torn away.<br>
These are words of deeper sorrow<br>
Than the wail above the dead;<br>
Both shall live, but every morrow<br>
Wake us from a widowed bed.<br>
And when thou wouldst solace gather<br>
And our child's first accents flow,<br>
Wilt thou teach her to say "Father,"<br>
Though his care she must forego?<br>
Should her lineaments resemble<br>
Those thou never more mayst see,<br>
Then thy heart will softly tremble<br>
With a pulse still true to me.<br>
All my faults perchance thou knowest,<br>
All my madness none can know;<br>
All my hopes, where'er thou goest,<br>
Wither, yet with thee they go.<br>
Every feeling hath been shaken;<br>
Pride which not a world could bow,<br>
Bows to thee by thee forsaken,<br>
Even my soul forsakes me now.<br>
Fare thee well! Thus disunited,<br>
Torn from every nearer tie,<br>
Seared in heart and lone and blighted&mdash;<br>
More than this I scarce can die.</p>

<p>Moore read this almost with tears, declaring that Byron's own
tears had blotted the manuscript. He had seen the marks.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Hobhouse coldly, "that he had used it to dry them
and had flung both on the fire. It is diabolically clever, but a
thing no gentleman could have done. The unfortunate woman is
practically defenceless from that style of assault, and,
considering all the circumstances, why he should alienate the
sympathy of gentlemen and prefer to court the pawings of the women
and rabble of Europe remains a mystery to me and ever will. The one
might have helped him, the other can but damn him deeper."</p>

<p>"My dear Hobhouse, are you not too fastidious?" said Moore, with
his slightly exaggerated deference. "Believe me, our poor friend
felt those touching lines when he wrote them. And again, though I
would not for the world undervalue the suffrages of polite society,
are we wholly to despise the warm-hearted sympathy of females and
of&mdash;ahem&mdash;the People? The exiled husband and father is a figure
which&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hobhouse's lip curled:</p>

<p>"My good Moore, that exiled husband and father is a preposterous
legend which Byron intends to create with every stroke of his pen,
unless indeed the violence of his temper tires under the pose. If
this sounds unfeeling I may quote Plato and say, 'Byron is my
friend, but Truth is my mistress.' I have had many hours of
pleasant converse with him and hope to have again, but I leave it
to his sycophants and toadies to weep over the 'Farewell.'"</p>

<p>The darting glance of Hobhouse's eye, clear and cold as ice,
withered Moore's sentiment on the spot and left him in no
uncertainty as to that great man's meaning.</p>

<p>Certainly Byron's wife had no defence. The words of her advisers
were already in process of fulfilment.</p>

<p>"I told you what would happen," Dr. Lushington said kindly, when
she consulted him. "The attack is dastardly&mdash;pure unadulterated
hypocrisy. But as the world is no judge of a gentleman and loves
sensation, it will move the world's heart against you, and there is
worse in store. It is my daily hope that we may hear Mrs. L. has
left England. That is the sole event which can place you in your
right position."</p>

<p>Her eyes were dry and bright as she replied:</p>

<p>"I must dree my weird, as we say in the north. And, as to
hypocrisy, I should not call it that. Think what a temptation it
must be to be the absolute master of words. He uses them as
Bonaparte used to do lives, for conquest. I have seen that again
and again. He will use them to express the most beautiful
passionate enthusiasm, of of which he never feels one single grain.
Yet it is not hypocrisy&mdash;he works himself up into a mood and writes
from that. Oh, I understand him thoroughly, as far as his mind
goes, and I can make allowance. Of his heart I never knew
anything."</p>

<p>He looked at her with true pity as she gathered up her gloves to
go.</p>

<p>"You can make allowance for every enemy. I trust in God you will
not wreck your life with your mercy, but I fear it very gravely.
When I think of his habitual behaviour and read this&mdash;Well&mdash;I
confess it turns my stomach."</p>

<p>She said no more and went quietly away.</p>

<p>Of the poems addressed to Augusta, she herself expressed the
wish that they were in the Red Sea. They all but ruined her, and
nothing but the strange elasticity of her temperament enabled her
to endure the position in which they placed her&mdash;that and the
support which never failed her, silent and strong.</p>

<p>When Byron joined Shelley and his two companions in Switzerland
he added another and darker shade to the portrait of himself which
England at the moment was contemplating with mingled horror and
curiosity. The latter was so strong that every movement of his was
watched and recorded and when he became one of what was known with
equal detestation as "the Shelley free lovers," he had defied
public opinion once more to a mortal duel.</p>

<p>For when Shelley established himself at the Maison Montalègre
and Byron did the same at the Villa Diodati, it was known that one
of Shelley's companions was Mary Godwin with whom he was living in
"the bonds of love" while his wife, Harriet Westbrook, was treading
the downward path of shame to suicide, and that the other was Jane
Clairmont (who had decorated herself with the more romantic name of
Claire), the daughter of Mary Godwin's stepmother. It was probably
the example of Mary's connection with Shelley which had inspired
Claire with the same design upon Byron's affections. An unsafe
analogy, for two spirits more unlike than Shelley's and Byron's
were never clothed in flesh. The principles taught in the Godwin
household by that very miscalled and venal sage, its master, made
free love the most natural adventure for the singular girls who
found his household, though not his teachings, so much too narrow
for their ambitions. Marriage was a crumbling relic of the slavery
of women, free love the noble protest of generous souls against an
intolerable insult to Liberty. It was a gospel particularly
attractive to spirited young women whose escape from the amenities
of Skinner Street, as <i>bourgeois</i> as its name, could scarcely
in consistency be made through the gate of marriage.</p>

<p>Mary Godwin, who had won all Shelley's tenderness, may be
considered as having shown the way to Claire, who saw in Byron, not
only his irresistible attractions, but an even higher rank, greater
fortunes, a more blazing renown, and a spirit equally rebellious
against all conventions. She did not foresee, nor did Mary, that
the day was at hand when the unanswerable logic of events would
teach them, as they teach most women, that the despised marriage
laws were their sole hope and protection in the age-long duel of
the sexes.</p>

<p>Byron's connection with Drury Lane had made Claire's approaches
possible, for what more natural than that a handsome young woman
with a charming singing voice, should propose to herself a stage
career? The moment was unfavourable and he rebuffed her advances.
For a man who had had so much of the brilliance and beauty of
Europe at his feet there was no attraction in the little bourgeoise
who thrust herself so violently upon him that she would not take
"No" for an answer. But she persisted, frantically persisted, until
at last it became less trouble to accede than to go on refusing,
and he condescended to warm his hands, chilled by English coldness,
at her flame.</p>

<p>She was now waiting for him by the lake, eager, resolute to
chain him, reckless of reputation, ready for any shrill outburst of
defiance, a passionate slave, unable to hide her attack under the
thinnest veil of decency.</p>

<p>It was scarcely wonderful that in such circumstances the British
visitors to Geneva found the poets and their companions more
interesting than all the glitter of waterfalls and solemnities of
the mountains. Crowds followed when they embarked, lined up on the
water side to greet their return, and a large and almost
astronomical telescope was installed at the hotel that these
wandering stars and their astounding satellites might be kept under
close observation.</p>

<p>Black tales flew across the water to England, and even Byron
disguised fear with fury when they returned embellished by popular
imagination and striking him on a point which he had bitter reason
to dread. He had not reached the point&mdash;indeed he never reached
it&mdash;of indifference to his wife's silent opinion, and weary as he
was of Claire Clairmont, he despatched her to England with the
Shelley <i>ménage</i>, the "bonds of love" broken for ever and
nothing but future bitter strife over their child between himself
and Claire.</p>

<p>Only the grim consequences were left&mdash;the ashes of the Dead Sea
fruit she had snatched at so eagerly. He thought the whole episode
over and done with.</p>

<p>By no means, in more ways than one. The passionate foolish woman
who was to pay for her one brief hour by one long mean scramble of
existence beset by every mortification was also to leave her mark
on the imperishable in English literature.</p>

<p>For, floating on the blue deeps of the lake held in the enormous
silence of the mountains, she sang, and they still hold the lovely
ghost of her voice, a sadder echo than that of the nymph Echo whom
Pan loved in Sicily of old though she had given all her heart to
the satyr and not to the god. Claire too had loved a satyr with no
human heart or ruth. Was it wonderful that he trampled her down
with more reckless cruelty than even the Goat-Footed of the
Sicilian mountain valleys, rejoicing in the sorrow of the deserted
who is now but a voice like Echo's own?</p>

<p>For Byron wrote, thrilling to the music, though not to the
woman:</p>

<p class="poem">"There be none of Beauty's daughters<br>
With a magic like thee,<br>
And like music on the waters<br>
Is thy sweet voice to me;<br>
When, as if its sound were causing<br>
The charmed ocean's pausing,<br>
The waves lie still and gleaming<br>
And the lulled winds seem dreaming,<br>
And the midnight moon is weaving<br>
Her bright chain o'er the deep;<br>
Whose breast is gently heaving<br>
As an infant's asleep;<br>
So the spirit bows before thee<br>
To listen and adore thee,<br>
With a soft but full emotion<br>
Like the swell of summer's ocean."</p>

<p>And Shelley, listening also in delight to the moonlight music,
laid at her feet the lovelier "To Constantia, Singing."</p>

<p>There are better and wiser women who have had lesser gifts than
these, diamonds instead of immortal amaranths and asphodels of
Byron's and Shelley's gathering. But flowers plucked in poets'
gardens are often dearly bought. Was it worth while to pay the
price? Who knows but the buyer? One may guess and guess wrong a
hundred times.</p>

<p>The air, however, was calmer when she went, carrying the hope
that the birth of her child might yet bind the cold heart she hoped
to warm. She little understood the frozen repulsion which with
Byron was so often the harvest of his amours.</p>

<p>But women can never understand the heart of the libertine and
never will, save those who are themselves of the same company.</p>

<p>It was a relief to him also to be rid of Shelley's rainbow
idealism and visions of a Utopia he himself was apt to believe
might be much duller than the present world, when all was said and
done. It was amusing enough to drift about the lake listening to
Shelley shrieking denunciations on the iniquities of the English
Church, Law Courts, Monarchy, everything that other men respected.
There Byron could agree. Destruction was his own sport and he an
old hawk at the game. But yet&mdash;though he could never admit it to
Shelley, in this despised England were things which to him
represented a lost heaven. Shelley could set up an ideal of free
love and bow down before its beauty. Byron's attitude was mockery
and contempt. Marriage he could respect, for he could feel its
solid necessities in a world of peerages and estates, but outside
that&mdash;women&mdash;No, he had known them too well to be misled by
Shelley's fantastic worship of what to other men was a sport.</p>

<p>He had also a fastidiousness of rank and taste which had never
possessed Shelley. Harriet Westbrook's lowermiddle-class airs would
have been intolerable to him, and he found Godwin with his
surrounding of oddly mixed families and his subversive theories
intensely repugnant. It was the old story. These things did very
well for poetry when one wished to startle and alarm, but they had
no relation to real life. He would have given Godwin, Shelley and
all their shriekings for Newstead with a desirable income, the
society of men and women of his own world, and the power so far to
control himself that he might not be tempted to cross that line of
permitted pleasures which he had so madly outstepped. Fool that he
had been to take that little more and be compelled for ever into
the position of herding with men and women whose heaven was not
his. The wrong heaven! Can there be a more ingenious hell?</p>

<p>Hobhouse came down through the mountains to the lake after the
air was free of Shelleyisms and to him, the easy man of the world,
lenient and undamnatory, Byron could open his heart.</p>

<p>"I should have liked you to meet Shelley," he said, as they sat
by the lake watching the glitter of the moonlight&mdash;broken glitter
as if some kraken of the depths had shed its golden scales upon the
surface.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't," Hobhouse replied sententiously. "There's no place
in any of my creeds for the screaming theorist, and I think it
unwise company for you. Why be ticketed with follies with which you
have no real affinity? And if you had&mdash;wise men <i>do</i> things,
not talk about them. And now, when things are at their worst, you
join forces with a man who talks like a lunatic even if he does
write like an angel."</p>

<p>"You could never understand him if you lived to be a thousand.
He's all you say&mdash;a fool of fools, and yet-Shelley lives in a queer
heaven of his own that I could envy him at times. I have no real
friendship for him&mdash;not perhaps for any one, but he amuses&mdash;even
touches me occasionally. But tell me about England&mdash;damned England,
Hobhouse. Are they ranting and canting there still, and are the
women trying to frighten Augusta&mdash;poor little silly Augusta, who
never did them any harm? She had much better have come to me."</p>

<p>Hobhouse turned and looked at him.</p>

<p>"You're always damning England. You do it so steadily that I
suspect your abuse is simply inverted love. You can't keep your
mind, your hands off it. Now, if you feel that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? Little do you know me. The English and their country I
loathe. If I meet any of the race here with their smug hypocritical
faces the most distant glimpse poisons the day to me. I would not
live among them if you gave me my amiable mother-in-law's fortune
and threw my wife into the bargain."</p>

<p>His eyes flashed with rage, but Hobhouse met them coolly.</p>

<p>"Exactly. You wish me to believe you prefer a scrambling life on
the Continent with its cheap restaurant atmosphere and a little
romance and moonlight to wash down the sickly draught. And you
prefer Godwin's skimble-skamble half-baked women and their
second-rate rattle and open harlotries that destroy even the zest
of pursuit to the talk of Holland House and the perfect wicked
delightful case of men and women of the great world to whom all the
other world brings all its best if they do but deign to gather it
up. No, Byron, no. You will never get me to believe that. <i>Savoir
vivre</i> saves more men than religion, and I tell you this&mdash;if you
ever hope to get back again into the world you lost, you must cut
off this Shelley connection. He believes in it and therefore can
live by it. No man can live by what he don't believe in and this is
chaff to a hungry stomach for you. He and his will dip you still
deeper. Get back to your wife, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"My wife!" Byron was pale and stuttering.</p>

<p>"Your wife. The best woman in the world for you if you could cut
yourself clear of follies and take your pleasures as other men do.
A good woman, and what's far more, an intellectual woman&mdash;more so
than you are a man. Mind, I said <i>intellectual</i>; I never said
creative. She knows more than you; thinks&mdash;you never think; is as
clear-headed as the Jungfrau on a clear day, and as clean minded as
the snows. If she were a little disagreeable, what matter? Does it
matter one single damn whom we've married when we get older? The
things that count then are place, money, one's proper position in
the world and the only amusements worth a rush in the long run, the
intellectual ones. All that you had, and you've thrown away your
birthright for what a mess of pottage!&mdash;Godwin's envious drivel,
and Shelley's dried peas, and the life of a man who has made an
open fool of himself. God help you!"</p>

<p>He half expected to be hurled over the parapet into the lake.
Silence.</p>

<p>The silence struck him. Turning his head in the moonlight, he
saw Byron's face fixed and pale, neither proud nor angry, with lip
unbent, smiling and quivering. He stretched out a shaking hand and
laid it on Hobhouse's. Who could foresee his moods?</p>

<p>"It's damned devil's truth, Hobhouse. Damned, because the door's
shut and barred. True, because Godwin's and Shelley's crack-brained
theories make me vomit, and their women stink of the Sunday school
with all their revolt. But there's no way back to Eden. The angel
at the door is my mother-in-law, 'with dreadful faces thronged, and
fiery arms.' No, the way lies onward."</p>

<p>He was trying to jest, with such a trembling on him that it made
even the seasoned Hobhouse uncomfortable. He had the impression of
a man at breaking point.</p>

<p>"Let's cry no more over spilt milk, my dear Byron. Look forward.
And for God's sake address no more verses either to your wife or
to&mdash;to&mdash;any one else. I warned you, you know. The eyes of Europe
are on you. Go soberly, keep up appearances. Put your enemies in
the wrong. Avoid loose women. Look at these women here!"</p>

<p>Byron laughed aloud&mdash;himself again&mdash;though his lips still
twitched.</p>

<p>"As to mistresses&mdash;God help me! as you said so beautifully&mdash;I've
had but one. Save your breath to cool your porridge, Hobby&mdash;what
else could I do? She came scrambling eight hundred miles to
unphilosophize me and was planted here when I arrived. The moment I
could I packed her back, though after so much aversion a little
appreciation was not wholly unwelcome. Do you think me repentant?
Not I! I shall follow my star and Murray has that in his hands
which <i>she</i> can never forgive. What matter? They shall reap
the reward of their cruelty and I shall go down into Italy and make
a life for myself there that even old Jesuits like you will
envy."</p>

<p>Hobhouse shook his head. "I've done. You'll go down into Italy,
and the end no man can foresee."</p>

<p>The talk was over. The moon looked down upon them in silver
splendour and the little ripple at the water's edge was sweeter
than all silence. Byron rose and stretched himself, yawning:</p>

<p>"Come up into the Bernese Oberland with me, and up there in the
heights I'll read you an Incantation which I have sent to
England&mdash;a little address to Lady Byron. And you shall own and
<i>they</i> shall own that after all there was something in the
outcast they could not break. Yes, the drawing rooms are good, and
Lalage, softly speaking, softly laughing, is good also&mdash;but there's
this&mdash;[he flung up his hand toward the mountains in their
remoteness] and that means something too, and what it means, is
mine. Not theirs, unless through me."</p>

<p>They went on their Bernese expedition, and who so gay and glad
as Byron! Hobhouse's more stolid enjoyment could keep no pace with
him. As they mounted, it seemed that they left the miasmas of the
plains with all their troubles below them. They saw the Staubbach
bounding down its thousand feet in shattering splendour, and</p>

<p class="poem">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far along<br>
From peak to peak the rattling crags among,<br>
Leaped the live thunder."</p>

<p>The avalanches roared leonine as the spirits of the peaks hurled
them over the precipices in their giant glee. And his spirit
expanded and exulted in its kindred solitudes.</p>

<p>"I am cured, I am free. They cannot harm me with their petty
hatred," he said, looking through the clouds to the west&mdash;to
England.</p>

<p>Yet, none the less, when they touched the shores of the lake,
Misery, hooded and bowed, crouched beside it, waiting for him. He
wrote in his journal:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Neither the music of the shepherd, the
crashing of the avalanche, nor the torrent, the mountain, the
glacier, the forest nor the cloud, have for one moment lightened
the weight on my heart, nor enabled me to lose my own wretched
identity in the majesty, the power and the glory around, above and
beneath me."</p>

<p>So, leaving the high mountains and their august purity, where,
as he wrote, he had led a cleaner life than for many past years, he
went down into the low lagoons of Venice and the mists, poisonous
to body and soul, that rise from the narrow waterways and the vast
palaces, whispering and alive still with the corruptions of the
Renaissance. There, where men, shaking off restraint, united
themselves to the evil past as to a bride, he was to touch a depth
lower than he had touched in his worst moments in England.</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER 22. RUIN</h2>

<p class="poem">"I cried for madder music and stronger wine,<br>
But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,<br>
Then falls thy shadoio, Cynara, the night is thine,<br>
And I am desolate and side of an old passion."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Ernest Dowson.</p>

<p class="letter"><br>
<br>
"On this day two years ago I was married ('Whom the Lord loveth, he
chasteneth.' I shan't forget the day in a hurry!) All the world
here are making up their intrigues for the season, changing or
going upon a renewed lease. The general state of morals here is
much the same as in the Doges' time: a woman is virtuous who limits
herself to her husband and one <i>cavaliere servente</i>: those who
have two, three, or more are a little <i>wild</i>, and it is only
those who are indiscriminately diffuse or who form a low connection
who are considered as overstepping the modesty of marriage. You
talk of marriage&mdash;ever since my own funeral, the word makes me
giddy and throws me into a cold sweat."</p>

<p>So Byron wrote from Venice, where the subtle poison in the air,
rising like mist from the narrow canals, invaded and enervated
brain and body alike. It is a time of his life which should be
touched as briefly as possible, but it cannot be forgotten, for it
shaped the rest of his life. It was the outward and visible sign of
the inward and spiritual disgrace which had befallen him in
England.</p>

<p>His speech was always reckless and bitter; in Venice it became
debased and acrid, and his letters to Murray and Moore and others,
gleefully describing the life of the Palazzo Mocenigo and the
battles with fists and nails among the low women who formed his
harem and contended for the handkerchief their sultan threw them,
are the measure of his fall.</p>

<p>"Even men are sometimes ashamed of passion without love," but at
that stage there was no shame in him, and memory was numbed at
last. Memory would have been but a spectral guest in the squalid
brawls of the Palazzo Mocenigo. If another ghost, that of the
brilliant Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who had once occupied the
Palazzo, ever glided about amongst women whom she would not have
thought fit to sweep her Ladyship's floors, how caustic would have
been that great lady's comments! Not thus did the gallants of her
day embrute themselves. They wore their rue with a difference from
that joyless profligacy. To her mind it would have been the gulf
which yawns between the man of quality and the parvenu.</p>

<p>To those who knew him, it was clear that Byron had always been a
parvenu. The son of an ancient family, the circumstances of his
mother's life had divided him from all the traditions and
surroundings of race and he had never had the education of the
salons. He came to his honours with the mingled zest and alarm of
the man promoted from the ranks and retained them all his life.</p>

<p>In Venice he adapted himself perfectly and without a jolt to the
lowest company, and, relaxing all his acquired tastes, slid
comfortably into slouching carelessness of outward show and inward
reality. What did it matter? The whale among minnows was assured of
servility bought and paid for, do what he would.</p>

<p>He relaxed the Spartan rule which had created and retained his
marvellous, pale beauty, and ate and drank to excess. The
debaucheries of the Palazzo Mocenigo called for the stimulus of
drink. Bodily disgrace overtook him. "He became gross in form and
visage, reassuming in the course of a few months the unwieldy
corpulence and facial obesity that had caused him so much distress
at Cambridge. In Venice his face was pasty and flaccid, and the
pallor of his countenance had a faint yellow tinge and uncleanly
hue. His sleep seldom lasted for an hour; he awoke sometimes to
roll in agony through long assaults of acute dyspepsia, more often
to lie in melancholy moodiness or endure the torture of afflicting
hallucinations."</p>

<p>And an affliction which was no hallucination wounded his pride
more sharply every day&mdash;the knowledge that in England his friends
were slowly forgetting him. They meant well enough, but the
pressure of daily interests is strong and absence the foretaste of
death.</p>

<p>So letters were fewer and fewer. If he hoped that the Venetian
excesses would revive the old "Lara" and "Corsair" legends and
invest him with the halo of infernal fire as of old, he was
entirely mistaken. The English public simply did not care. If Lord
Byron in Venice chose to besmear himself with the mud of the canals
that was his own affair. No doubt he had taken up with foreigners
who suited him very well. There were few hearts in England to whom
it meant more than that.</p>

<p>He felt it bitterly. He had little else to do than to write, and
knew himself an excellent correspondent, and the brief, scanty
responses galled him cruelly. Besides, there was so much he yearned
to know, for all his real interests were in England. He struck no
root in Italy, and the roots in England were withering in a black
frost, and he with them.</p>

<p>His letters grew more and more bitter.</p>

<p class="letter">"Will my wife always live? Will her mother never
die? Is her father immortal? What are you about? Married and
settled in the country, I suppose, by your silence. I am so bilious
that I nearly lose my head, and so nervous that I cry for
nothing&mdash;At least, to-day, I burst into tears, all alone by myself,
over a cistern of goldfishes, which are not pathetic animals."</p>

<p>A sense of weakness invaded him like the forecast shadow of
doom. His defiance, cast at the world, had exhausted him and
irjured it not at all. It went its way and did not care, and even
Fate seemed to have forgotten him and left him to rot, like the fat
ooze which heaves and sways round the piles of his Venetian
home.</p>

<p>Yet in the general disuse of all that makes life worth living,
his genius had not deserted him, and it was in Venice he wrote the
majestic and terrible drama "Manfred," the highest flight of his
purely poetic power. But, as always happened with him, that
loveliness was inspired by his familiar demon also, and nothing he
had ever written or was to write caused such grief and dismay among
those whom he still had the power and will to wound.</p>

<p>Time and death have conspired now to rob it of its sting, for
evil is mortal and beauty immortal, and nothing is left but beauty
and desolation, wild as the Alps, which, mingling with his wrath
and ruin, were its inspiration. He had written the "Incantation,"
which invokes eternal despair upon his wife, in Switzerland, and
round that core grew the poem which cannot die while the language
lasts.</p>

<p>For the understanding of his history "Manfred" cannot be passed
over. Nothing so depicts his chaotic selfishness as the writing of
it. He knew the rumours which had all but destroyed Augusta, and
gave them this sanction of infernal beauty, depicting a soul which
he knew the world must identify with his own, caught and ruined in
the snare of a forbidden passion.</p>

<p>In the castle among the higher Alps is laid the scene of a drama
of the soul more terrible than the Faust of Goethe, though the work
of an intellectual child in comparison with the calm wisdom
inspiring the Faust and leading it to its magnificent close in the
mighty Chorus Mysticus. But "Manfred" has its darkened glories, and
the pale sweet moon of Margaret wanes before the glow of the red
star of the passion of Astarte. Goethe himself, reading it with
profound and comprehending interest, wrote:</p>

<p class="letter">"I cannot enough admire his genius. We find in
this tragedy the quintessence of the most astonishing talent, born
to be its own tormentor."</p>

<p>True, and the tormentor of others. But in the sonorous harmonies
of "Manfred," in this extraordinary out-flinging of hate and
despair, Byron reached his zenith of pure poetry.</p>

<p>Did he feel all he wrote? Was it all sincere, or, in the words
of the woman who knew him best, was he but marshalling his obedient
cohorts of words to destroy? Who can tell? But the armies of the
devil's literature of hate will be led for ever by the
"Incantation" in which he denounces despair and ruin on the wife
who had shielded and hidden the story which "Manfred" was to blazon
abroad.</p>

<p class="poem">"When the moon is on the wave,<br>
And the glow-worm in the grass,<br>
And the meteor on the grave,<br>
And the wisp on the morass:<br>
When the falling stars are shooting<br>
And the answered owls are hooting,<br>
And the silent leaves are still<br>
In the shadow of the hill,<br>
Then my soul shall be on thine<br>
With a power and with a sign.<br>
<br>
"Though thou seest me not pass by,<br>
Thou shalt feel me with thine eye,<br>
As a thing that though unseen,<br>
Must be near thee, and hath been:<br>
And when in that secret dread<br>
Thou hast turned around thy head,<br>
Thou shalt marvel I am not,<br>
As thy shadow on the spot.<br>
<br>
"From thy false tears I did distil<br>
An essence which ha oh strength to kill.<br>
From thine own heart I then did wring<br>
The black blood in its blackest spring:<br>
From thine own smile I snatched the snake,<br>
For there it coiled as in a brake:<br>
From thine own lip I drew the charm<br>
Which gave all these their chiefest harm,<br>
In proving every poison known<br>
I found the strongest was thine own.<br>
<br>
"By thy cold breast and serpent smile,<br>
By thy unfathomed gulfs of guile,<br>
By that most seeming-virtuous eye,<br>
By thy shut soul's hypocrisy,<br>
By the perfection of thine art<br>
Which passed for human thine own heart,<br>
By thy delight in other's pain,<br>
And by thy brotherhood of Cain,<br>
I call upon thee and compel<br>
Thyself to be thy proper hell!<br>
<br>
"And on thy head I pour the vial<br>
Which shall devote thee to this trial:<br>
Nor to slumber, nor to die,<br>
Shall be in thy destiny.<br>
Though thy death shall still seem near<br>
To thy wish, but as a fear.<br>
Lo! the spell now works around thee,<br>
And the clankless chain hath bound thee.<br>
O'er thy heart and brain together<br>
Hath the word been passed. Now wither!"</p>

<p>Whatever he felt, the thought, inspired by the vindictive will,
was there, and round it imagination worked until the image of the
woman who, he conceived, had injured him past redemption, became
the symbol of the wide world's hate and cruelty. But, though the
wound thus dealt was deep, he had a deeper for the woman who had
sinned and suffered for him. If he must be pilloried she shall
stand beside him.</p>

<p>So, in "Manfred," broke forth the long-smouldering fury of the
black angel, Remorse, and this, too, transfigured into something
vast and superhuman such as Byron could never feel on the plane of
consciousness. There, he could jest, be flippant, vain,
self-glorifying in his crime, tossing it to light women for their
half-believing comments, investing it with the cheap horror of his
inferior poems. But deep down in the innermost of the dual
personality of man he had created his hell as surely as Dante
created the Inferno, and when it broke loose it scorched him. It
was the prisoner of day, but the night was its kingdom and he its
victim.</p>

<p>In "Manfred" he strove to discharge his unbearable burden, and
then turned, depleted by that uprush of the Hidden, to other
utterances, complete and perfect of their kind, but children of the
mind only, no more than the mocking cynicism of the man who uses
life as a mirror to flash back their follies to men and dazzle them
with the reflected glitter. It was then he wrote "Don Juan" and
climbed the throne of the consummate satirist.</p>

<p>But the world, thus taken into his confidence, accepted
"Manfred" as the authentic cry of self-revelation, and those who
knew him best, knew, shuddering at their knowledge, that though it
was necessary it should have been written, no eye should have seen
it. Its reverberation in Europe was deep and loud. It stands alone
and supreme and must in a very real sense be the centre of any
attempt at exposition of the man as he was in depths so deep that
he himself could not fathom them, though in moments of inspiration
he could disclose them.</p>

<p>Worn out in health, the body fainting in the race with the
desires of the mind, Byron knew in the spring of 1819 that the
debaucheries of Venice must be relinquished. They had not brought
him the especial sort of attention which he had always relished.
The fallen angel, fascinating and mysterious, moving on his own
dark orbit in awful self-sufficiency, despising the condemnation of
the ordinary human being, was extinct. He was weary of it all,
inexpressibly weary. The dulness of virtue seemed as nothing to the
dulness of vice and the violent, monotonous quarrels of the women
of the Palazzo Mocenigo.</p>

<p>It was about this time he wrote one of the loveliest of his
songs&mdash;a farewell to youth, if rightly read&mdash;to youth so
thriftlessly spent, so irretrievable.</p>

<p class="poem">"So we'll go no more a-roving,<br>
So late into the night,<br>
Though the heart be still as loving<br>
And the moon be still as bright.<br>
<br>
"For the sword outwears its sheath<br>
And the soul wears out the breast,<br>
And the heart must pause to breathe,<br>
And Love itself have rest.<br>
<br>
"Though the night was made for loving<br>
And the day returns too soon,<br>
Yet we'll go no more a-roving<br>
By the light of the moon."</p>

<p>The world seemed to have gone by him and to have left him shut
up and forgotten in Venice with the Comus rabble of his Palazzo. He
wrote to Murray:</p>

<p class="letter">"When I tell you I have not heard a word from
England since very early in May, I have made the eulogium of my
friends, or the persons who call themselves so, since I have
written so often and in the greatest anxiety. Thank God, the longer
I am absent the less cause I see for regretting the country and its
living contents. Tell Mr. Hobhouse that I will never forgive him
(or anybody) the atrocity of their late neglect and silence at a
time when I wished particularly to hear (for every reason) from my
friends."</p>

<p>The truth was that the glamour of the young Apollo was waning,
and the accounts from those who ventured as far as Italy were not
reassuring. His attorney, Hanson, was obliged by business to see
him and, accompanied by his son, journeyed to Venice. The younger
man, shrewd-eyed, made his notes. There was a nervous sensitiveness
in "his Lordship" which suffused his eyes with tears, though, from
what is known of Hanson, one would have thought him as likely to
extract them as the gold fish! The further comment is:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Lord Byron could not have been more than
thirty, but he looked forty. His face had become pale, bloated and
sallow. He had grown very fat, his shoulders broad and round and
the knuckles of his hands were lost in fat."</p>

<p>A poor tale of Apollo to carry back to England!</p>

<p>And Venice had not repaid him for what he had lost there. The
fallen archangel type of debauchee was scarcely understood and
honoured as he had hoped in the beautiful city of the
lagoons&mdash;possibly because debauchees were so common that it was
hardly worth while to study the niceties of the species. And as to
Milord's poetry, there were few natives who knew enough English to
care whether it was bad or good, or to stumble through a canto of
"Childe Harold."</p>

<p>The crowning blow fell when he was informed by Hoppner, the
Consul General, that the Venice which took any interest in his
concerns was laughing at him. They had not even the grace to be
shocked. They found his amours with the coarse women raked in from
the canals frankly ridiculous&mdash;</p>

<p>"These English know no better. Milord has evidently a natural
taste for low life and low living. But absurd!"</p>

<p>That was the fatal, the enraging, note.</p>

<p>What is an Apollo to do with himself in such circumstances? Like
Falstaff, reform and live cleanly? Impossible! But one could at
least wear one's rue with a difference, and the terrible state of
his health and appearance warned him there was no time to lose if
Apollo were not to sink into Silenus and all the world avert their
faces in repulsion.</p>

<p>And first, the inhabitants of the Palazzo Mocenigo must be swept
out into their canals by the swiftly whirling besom of destruction.
The child Allegra, with her maid, must be packed off to Hoppner and
his wife and later to a convent, in spite of the almost shrieking
entreaties of her detested mother, Claire Clairmont, and Shelley;
and Byron set himself seriously to recover his health and graces on
the old Spartan <i>régime</i>.</p>

<p>It may be pleasant to be morally horror-inspiring, it is
unbearable to be contemptible. Long, long ago, as it now seemed, in
days very far beyond recall in Geneva, Madame de Stael had warned
him that the world is a strong antagonist and is sure to win in the
long run. His fear that she might be right prompted swift and
drastic measures.</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, he had lost in Venice some things he
could not recover, do what he Avould. His health was never the same
again. He was still a young man in years, but excesses of food and
drink, with the sharply alterating excesses of austerity when he
stayed his hunger with opium and tobacco juice, had wrought some
organic mischief that was beyond repair, and his mania for dosing
himself with medical remedies which he understood little enough,
did not help matters. The harm was done, there was a flaw, and the
man was henceforward old, tremulous, irritable, though he was as
eager to hide the aging as any reigning beauty. For him it meant
the end of all that made what was left of life worth living. That
gone, the play would be played out and the player hissed off the
stage.</p>

<p>There were two things he could do to retrieve and reassure
himself. He could plunge again into the rejuvenating influence of
literary creation, and he could prove to Venice and the world that
though he had deigned to trifle with the women of the canals, great
ladies were still at his beck and call when he honoured them by
tossing the handkerchief in their direction. He meant, in the first
adventure, to "be a little quietly facetious about everything." The
world which could not be conquered could still perhaps be
ridiculed. It would be worth trying.</p>

<p>He began "Don Juan," the "Donny Johnny" of his letters to Murray
and Moore. Did they think such an essay would be likely to draw the
public? He would not write "for women and the plebeians," as he put
it, but he was extremely anxious to write something for which
Murray would be eager to pay a good price. If England was nothing
else, she should at least be his milch cow and feed the thirst for
money which had grown upon him in Venice.</p>

<p>For he had developed a pressing love of money, which was
henceforth to be a strongly actuating force in all his dealings. He
left in the Swiss mountains the delicate scruple which forbade an
English peer to touch his earnings, and he haggled with Murray now
over the prices of romance, mystery and satire at so much a verse
as sharply as any seller on the Rialto.</p>

<p>But, almost obliterating the love of money in his mind, came a
new and surprising freshness of joy and hope. "Don Juan" astounded
and delighted himself. He knew very well that he could turn out the
"Lara" and "Corsair" rhymes by the volume&mdash;<i>that</i> was for "the
women and plebeians"&mdash;but this, this was for the enchantment of men
of the world who knew the best of its kind when they saw it and
would say, with his own smile:</p>

<p>"Pope&mdash;with the difference which makes it as original as Pope
himself."</p>

<p>That was a wellspring of almost pure hope and joy to very
thirsty lips. It infused power even into his broken body. It pulled
him together, it re-created him, this knowledge that he had the
mastery still, and in the vein he had admired&mdash;nay,
worshipped&mdash;since boyhood.</p>

<p>"Confess, confess, you dog!" he wrote to Kinnaird, "that it is
the sublime of this sort of writings."</p>

<p>He would chasten it, however, because it might not sell
otherwise. He must consider the public he had never considered till
the Venetian days of degradation. It should be "damned modest," for
the outcry had frightened Murray and therefore himself. But, oh,
the pity of it! (as he cried to Kinnaird):</p>

<p>"I had such projects for the Don, but the benefit of my
experiences must now be lost to despairing posterity!"</p>

<p>But even this bliss, and bliss it was, could not turn his
attention from the other and yet more passionate pursuit of his
life. The personal incense of women's adoration, despise it as he
would, and did, was still vital to his comfort (the other name for
his vanity). Without intrigue he could neither live nor convince
the world that Apollo was not yet shorn of his beams, that Venice
had been but an eclipse and the shadow was gliding off the orb of
the Sun-God leaving the radiance undiminished. He began again to
frequent the salons of Venice, the stalking ground of the old
hunter&mdash;a poor apology indeed for the palaces of the great days in
London, but better than nothing.</p>

<p>In the April of 1819 destiny took him to the house of the
Countess Benzoni, who, all unguessing the future, presented him to
a girl of sixteen, the Countess Guiccioli, daughter of a poor
Romagnese family of good descent, bride of a husband aged sixty,
one of the richest nobles of Romagna. Her beauty, of the
fair-flushed, milkskinned, childish type, caught Byron's eye at
once and held it. Here, surely, were all his requirements in
duodecimo!</p>

<p>For her years she was fully formed, with curves alluded to by
one biographer as "an amplitude of snowy developments," and a
velvet bloom seconding the invitation of large blue eyes set in the
charming shadow of brown lashes so long that, like those of one of
Disraeli's heroines, it might almost be feared they would tangle in
her sleep. She had the light artillery of flying blushes and little
laughters to perfection, budded lips and "wickedly pretty
teeth"&mdash;charms enough to captivate even without the showers of
honey-golden hair which, unloosed about her, fell in silky masses
of flix and floss, curling as naturally as vine tendrils, the true
colour of romance. One of her biographers declares that had a
fillet of purest guinea-gold been twisted in those wonderful
tresses, it could not have matched and never Out-matched them (the
likeness may not have been unpleasant to Byron's newly developed
love of the guinea whose jingling helps the hurt that honour
feels). Taken as a whole, a brilliantly fair and sunny young Aurora
of the Romagna, opulent as one of Rubens's goddesses, smiling and
cheerful as a summer morning.</p>

<p>When she entered the room, he was dominating the crowd in the
fashion of the dead English days.</p>

<p>"I saw what appeared to be a beautiful apparition reclining on
the sofa. Asked if he would be presented to me, Byron answered,
'No. I cannot know her&mdash;she is too beautiful,'" she wrote later,
with soft complacency. What woman could resist that reason? "At
parting Lord Byron wrote something on a scrap of paper and handed
it to me."</p>

<p>The Guicciolis were to leave Venice in a fortnight, but the
lovers saw each other daily and when the pair departed Byron was
under orders to follow them to Ravenna and Teresa Guiccioli had met
the fate of every woman who trusted her reputation in Byron's
hands. Already he was writing to Hoppner:</p>

<p class="letter">"She says they must go to Bologna in the middle
of June, and why the devil then drag me to Ravenna? However, I
shall determine nothing till I get to Bologna and probably take
some time to decide when I am there, so that, the gods willing, you
may probably see me soon again. The charmer forgets that a man may
be whistled anywhere <i>before</i>, but that <i>after</i>, a
journey in an Italian June is conscription, and therefore she
should have been less liberal in Venice or less exigent at
Ravenna."</p>

<p>Amazing!</p>

<p>The ramifications of that intrigue are a novel in themselves,
and a tedious one. He had bound a burden on his back, light and
easy at first, almost crushing in its weight at the last. The
Guiccioli did him and the world one service: she saved him from the
wild debaucheries of Venice. But even from the beginning it palled,
palled unspeakably sometimes.</p>

<p>Moore, now in Italy, came to visit him for a few days, and they
were very merry and drank together and there was pride in
presenting the beautiful "lady of quality" for his admiration&mdash;the
woman who had been ready to break through the accommodating canons
of the country and throw in her lot with his openly, to the scandal
of the easy-going women who exacted fidelity from their lovers as a
debt of honour and paid their husbands like tradesmen&mdash;that is, not
at all.</p>

<p>She was with him now at his villa of La Mira, a sight for all
the Italian world to see with horrified ejaculations and
invocations of insulted saints: a <i>cicisbeo</i>, yes, <i>that</i>
any sensible person could understand and approve, but a woman who
<i>leaves</i> her husband for her lover&mdash;Dio mio!</p>

<p>Still, Moore shall take back the news to England that we are
eternally the heart-breaker, the irresistible. The cold wife shall
hear it, the faded loves of England shall suffer yet another pain
in reading of the triumphant Don Juan!</p>

<p>But Moore brought something from England besides the flatteries
which Byron had had so little reason to thank. Memory. He revived
the dead days with all their hopes and delights, strewn and
withered now like leaves in Vallombrosa.</p>

<p>"I could wish you to speak and yet be silent," Byron said.
"Detesting England as I do and must, you yet recall days which I
would to the devil I could forget. What a poor thing is human
nature! Because a fate over which we have no control embeds our
roots in one particular soil no better, nay&mdash;rather worse in some
respects than most others, the very memory of it is to unman one!
But, my dear Tom, it's but a mixture of bile and sentiment when
all's said and done&mdash;bile predominating. A man with ill health and
worse nerves&mdash;what can you expect?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly natural," Moore agreed chirpily. "And certainly
London palls. It is far from being the metropolis of the world, as
Londoners are so apt to vaunt. Hew beautiful is this land of the
olive and fig, how&mdash;"</p>

<p>Byron interrupted roughly:</p>

<p>"Damned romantic! Did you ever hear of the sailor, Tom, who,
beating up channel in a sou'-wester after a five years' absence in
the tropics, cried with exultation, 'None of your damned bluo skies
here!' I think, sometimes, I should like to see the cobblestones
all shining wet under the link-lights for a big party at Holland
House better than the domes and towers of Venice black against the
melancholy gold of sunset. Not so beautiful by a long score,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, and Moore did not dare fill in the silence with the
word "home," which he knew had nearly broken through the lips that
half shaped it. He spoke cheerily.</p>

<p>"A mind as great and as full of resources as yours carries its
own Holland House and all the rest of it wherever it goes. What
does the man who can startle the world with 'Donny Johnny' want of
outside wits to sharpen his? No, my friend, wherever you settle
will be a Mecca for remarkable minds."</p>

<p>But Byron was staring moodily at the ground.</p>

<p>Presently he looked up with that gay and bitter smile upon his
lips which Moore knew best of all the expressions that changed so
often.</p>

<p>"Never mind! <i>Carpe diem</i>, Tom. You're here, and God knows
when we two shall meet again, in thunder, lightning or in rain. I
have leave of absence from my witch, thank God! Did you ever know
that a mistress can be twice as exacting as a wife? But I have
leave, and sunburn me if I don't go with you to Rome and singe the
Pope's beard and wring the last drop of England out of you before I
let you go! It means some days more at least before I sink back
into the Italian slush again."</p>

<p>Moore sat bolt upright in his chair.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Byron, impossible! Im-poss-ible! Just consider, I
beg of you! The Countess has left her husband. You have carried her
off and she has placed herself here under your protection in this
villa of yours-and you would leave her, actually leave her and
proceed with me to Rome! Consider in what a position you would
place her&mdash;what a public affront to a woman who has sacrificed all
for you. O no, that would never do! A lady of birth, too!"</p>

<p>"They and their sacrifices!" growled Byron. "I should like to
know who has been carried off but poor dear <i>me?</i> And what, in
God's name, does one gain? You remind me of what Curran said to
you&mdash;have you forgotten? 'So I hear you have married a pretty woman
and an excellent creature: pray&mdash;um&mdash;<i>how do you pass your
evenings?</i>' It is a devil of a question that, and perhaps as
easily to be answered with a wife as with a mistress. Anyhow, I can
answer for the monotony of both. It is the curse of women that we
can neither live with them nor without them. I'm for Rome."</p>

<p>"My dear Byron, I could not be a party to it. Think of the agony
to a sensitive female. We must consider them somewhat. A wife has
her consequence in the world, which must always be her consolation
and support. But a highly-descended woman in the Countess's
position-No, my dear man. I wonder how your usual consideration
could propose it."</p>

<p>Byron looked at him silently for a moment, then laughed
loudly.</p>

<p>"I have been their martyr one way or another all my life. It is
but another turn on the gridiron! Have your way, I'll stay here&mdash;if
you wish it."</p>

<p>The little man chirped and almost whistled, more birdlike in his
brightness than ever. What? Affront a lady of quality! A very
different matter from sweeping into the canals all the female
refuse of the Palazzo Mocenigo (of that he could unreservedly
approve).</p>

<p>"But I'm tired, Moore, tired," Byron said at last. "It has done
me good, picked me up to see you&mdash;but I'm run down. Every morning
at three o'clock I wake, and&mdash;the blue devils sit on my chest then
to some purpose! We have been talking merrily enough until now,
haven't we? Well, even that they'll turn into&mdash;horror. Yes, horror.
I lie for an hour or two in the thick of&mdash;hell. Is it hypochondria?
What is it? And things are growing on me&mdash;a kind of mental sloth,
as if nothing mattered. Does it? Why did we ever think it did? I
don't care a damn for Rome&mdash;no, nor for you, Tom&mdash;nor you! Nor her,
nor anything. Does it mean that, like Swift, I shall die first at
top? Is my head going? And if it goes, do I care? Mayn't an idiot
be happier sitting in the sun and counting his fingers than
remembering&mdash;remembering&mdash;?"</p>

<p>His voice trailed off into silence, and for the moment Moore's
chirp was hushed. Into that silence dropped the gay notes of a
barrel-organ, one of the odd sub-voices of Italy, a jangling,
drumming thing. It was playing a waltz&mdash;<i>tum-ti-tum, tum, ti-tum
ti-tum</i>. Moore smiled and raised his hand.</p>

<p>"There, my dear Byron, doesn't that recall&mdash;Very old-fashioned
now, but still&mdash;really&mdash;'She gave me a rose, a rose, a rose'&mdash;isn't
that it?"</p>

<p>He turned, laughing. Byron, white as death, every nerve in his
face quivering, was fixed on the miserable jigging.</p>

<p>Yes, he knew very well! It was a waltz he had heard ten thousand
times in London between 1812 and 1815. What phantoms danced to it!
Caroline Lamb, with fevered, reproachful eyes on his; Lady Oxford,
bold and gay; Frances Webster, pale and shadowy, eluding his
pursuit yet trembling to it&mdash;so many women, some dim and confused
now to his memory, the past taking them all like brown autumn
leaves on a chill wind&mdash;Augusta, laughing gaily, brainlessly,
edging nearer with her childish levity that understood nothing, not
even ruin, living only in the impulse of the moment, his
destruction and her own. And beyond and above them all, a face
proud and still, seeming to look down upon the rabble rout flitting
to the harsh music, apart, alone like the lady in Comus:</p>

<p class="poem">"Serenely purest of her sex that live"</p>

<p>the only real thing there, his own and now for ever apart&mdash;she
who had held in her hands all that life might have given him. Her
eyes looked at him mutely, with a grief beyond all tears, and still
the barrel-organ drummed and jigged and still the phantom dance
surrounded him like the witches' Sabbath on the Brocken, face after
face gleaming and passing, broken patterns in a kaleidoscope&mdash;and
she looked never at them, but steadfastly at him.</p>

<p>It stopped suddenly with a broken jangle and there was a whine
outside for money. He wiped his forehead and pushed coins into
Moore's hand.</p>

<p>"Fling it out to him and tell him to go to the devil! No, you're
right. I shall not go with you to Rome. What good? Life is life and
past is past. I shall stay here."</p>

<p>They parted a little later and Moore went his way full of "my
admirable and excellent friend," with a budget for English
consumption (dotted with plentiful asterisks) and one for his own
(the real one), to be laid aside in the recesses of his
reflections. Byron, left alone, and with little temptation to be
diffuse in the interest of those he wrote to, began a letter to
Hobhouse.</p>

<p class="letter">"I have to do with a woman rendered perfectly
disinterested by her situation in life, and young and amiable and
pretty&mdash;in short, as good and at least as attentive as any of her
sex can be. But I feel, and I feel it bitterly, that a man should
not consume his life at the side and on the bosom of a woman and a
stranger, and that this cicisbean existence is to be condemned. But
I have neither the strength of mind to break my chain nor the
insensibility which would deaden its weight. I cannot tell what
will become of me. To what have I conducted myself?"</p>

<p>And to this question there was certainly no answer to be hoped
from Hobhouse or himself. There was one, and one only, in the world
who could have told him the truth and its implications, and life
had silenced her more effectually than death.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER 23. A LOST BATTLE</h2>

<p class="poem">"Que vivre est difficile&mdash;ô mon coeur fatigué!"<br>
<br>
&mdash;Amiel.</p>

<p>When "Manfred" was published in England, the storm, which had
lulled, broke out again with fury, and Anne Byron might well feel
something akin to despair. But to act, not despair, was her nature,
and she armed herself immediately. She knew from Mrs. Villiers and
others that the poem was accepted as self-revelation and that it
would replace Augusta in the perilous position from which she had
been rescued in 1816. It was possible it might drive her to some
wild, impulsive action undoing all the work done and unchaining all
the leashed dangers.</p>

<p>There were moments when Anne Byron felt herself wearying in the
struggle. Her friends noted with grief the expression of strained
resolution in her worn face, a look quivering, yet unflinching,
moving to the heart, which made her appear much older than her
years. But what else could be expected of a woman set to a task so
much beyond her strength, enduring alone and without complaint? It
pierced the tenderness of those who loved her, the few who
understood her nature. The world, looking, as always, on the
surface, wrote her down cold, unsympathetic, the very woman to
invite the troubles she met in such uncommunicative silence. How
much more attractive is she who gossips over them, weeps, smiles
pathetically, makes her little self-pitying confidences! That, at
least, one may understand. But Lady Byron was like a black frost,
so they said, hard and chilling.</p>

<p>Was Augusta in despair at last? Was she, too, failing, exhausted
in the struggle? Not in the least. Talking with Mrs. Villiers, Anne
gathered that this was also her view of Augusta's attitude.</p>

<p>"I wish to be absolutely accurate in what I say about her. No, I
should not describe her as being in despair. She is
<i>incommoded</i>. My dear Lady Byron, if you toil to the day of
your death, you will never make an impression on Augusta. You might
as well try to engrave on running water. Has she ever been shocked
either at the past or present? Have you ever been able to induce
her to cease corresponding with the man whom she knows gave her
name to be a by-word and all but drove her out of society?"</p>

<p>"No, but yet I think she has honestly asked my advice, and I
gave it with much caution, never imposing my thoughts on her, only
suggesting and begging her to be guided by her own conscience."</p>

<p>"I wonder where that precious possession would lead her!" Mrs.
Villiers said, a little grimly. "I have never seen a sign of its
existence. Let the world go well, and she never troubles about
anything but the surface. Let it go ill, and who so injured, so
ready to make use of her friends! In one sense I can never regard
her as a sinner, for she has not the smallest power of realizing
her position and how it affects others, though she pulls a grave
face sometimes for propriety's sake. You might have lifted a real
sinner to the very heaven of heavens with a tenth of the pains you
have given to her, for she has nothing of the Magdalen in her
nature&mdash;would that she had!"</p>

<p>The other woman's sad eyes were exploring the past.</p>

<p>"Long, long ago," she said, "in another life, as it seems now, I
used to think that <i>he</i> had far more moral consciousness than
she. He knew the light and sinned against it. She cared for nothing
but the ease of the moment. She talked of religion, but never knew
its meaning."</p>

<p>"Exactly what I say. Yet, how kind, how charming! I defy any one
not to like and pity her for what she will never pity in herself.
But, though I love her still, I sometimes ask myself, Is she worth
the agony she is inflicting on you? My dear friend, you are aged
and saddened beyond what I could have believed. Might it not be
better to give up and struggle no further with the two of them? You
are so young and you are wasting all your precious life upon
them&mdash;and what can you do?"</p>

<p>"Her children," Lady Byron reminded the speaker.</p>

<p>When she had gone, the tears stood in Mrs. Villiers's bright
eyes. Of all the loss and wreck wrought by that miserable marriage,
to her the most heart-breaking was Anne Byron's. The other two were
what they were, and whoever he had married their story would have
been the same or yet more disastrous; but she, with her calm
intellectual serenity, her fixed adherence to the light as she saw
it, her love of the highest moral beauty&mdash;what ruin had been hers!
Happy, what might she not have done? Now, for this young woman
still in her twenties, looking along a hopeless future, what was
left? She had ceased to believe in joy, and duty untouched by the
sunshine of love had become for her the stern Daughter of the Voice
of God and that alone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Villiers, not analytic, but feeling intensely, saw, with a
certainty beyond mere knowledge, how this must cripple her life. It
would warp her relations with her daughter, as with all the world.
It might never be possible to break away the ice in which her heart
was slowly freezing and restore her to the world of living, loving
men and women once more. The shock had been so frightful that,
except for this one clinging to Augusta's salvation, she had come
to fear individual men and women and to dare nothing beyond
flinging her splendid energy into the colder channels of syndicated
charities and philanthropies where she spent herself ungrudgingly
and received much, indeed, in return, but never the one thing
needful, the heart-glow, warming and responsive.</p>

<p>She could still hope, however, that Augusta's self-respect would
be stirred into life by the "Manfred" outrage, and very soon the
letter which might fulfil her hopes confronted her. Augusta wrote
that he had asked her jestingly whether it had not "caused a
pucker," and added that this most unfeeling and almost insulting
manner of remarking upon "Manfred" had given her the opportunity of
replying&mdash;what? Anne fluttered the pages anxiously to find it. This
was the rebuke:</p>

<p class="letter">"<i>Apropos</i> of 'puckers,' I thought there was
unkindness which I did not expect in doing what was but too sure to
cause one, and so I said nothing, and perhaps should not, but for
your questions."</p>

<p>So that was all she could find to reply to the wickedness of
such a publication at such a time! Who could defend a woman who had
no perception of her own position or his? There were moments when
Anne's resolution did not falter&mdash;no!&mdash;but she was compelled to ask
herself at last what good she was likely to accomplish for Augusta
in the long run. Augusta's own family of halfbrothers and sisters
supported her, and if they or any one could have taken Anne Byron's
place of guardianship, she would have surrendered it now with the
deep thankfulness of exhaustion.</p>

<p>She took up the letter, sighing. Augusta continued her maunders
about Byron's letter from Venice.</p>

<p class="letter">"A more melancholy one I can't well imagine, such
anger and hatred and bitterness to all. In short, it's plain to me
he is angry with himself, poor fellow! What a dreadful existence:
the only account of himself and his proceedings is a dreadful one,
and I suppose intended to vex and perplex me, as is the whole
letter."</p>

<p>What a woman! The utmost tragedies of life confronted her and
troubled her in exactly the same ratio as if the kitchen boiler had
burst! It was "vexing and perplexing," while Anne Byron, stark with
grief and horror, was facing the problems of her life for her,
brokenhearted.</p>

<p>Not long after there was a fresh alarm. In the recoil from the
Venetian dissipations and their ruinous effect upon his health,
Byron had taken it into his head that he would return to England,
if only for a visit. He wrote to Augusta a letter which would have
filled most women with mortal terror and shrinking.</p>

<p class="letter">"We may have been very wrong, but I repent of
nothing except that cursed marriage. If ever I return to England,
it will be to see you, and recollect that in all time and place and
feelings I have never ceased to be the same to you in my heart.
Circumstances may have ruffled my manner and hardened my spirit,
you may have seen me harsh and exasperated with all things round
me, grieved and tortured with your new resolution and the
soon-after persecution of that infamous fiend who drove me from my
country and conspired against my life by endeavouring to deprive me
of all that could render it precious&mdash;but remember that even then
you were the sole object that cost me a tear!&mdash;do you remember our
parting?"</p>

<p>There was more, much more, and Augusta enclosed it to her
sister-in-law with her usual fluffy condemnations, apologizing also
for the pain it must give his wife. Pain? But all the world was
pain and nothing else.</p>

<p class="letter">"I really must enclose the last letter I spoke to
you of, for I have endeavoured in vain to reply to it. I am so
afraid of saying what might do harm, or omitting any possible good.
Burn it, and tell me you have and answer me as soon as you can. I
shall be anxious, and my unusually long silence may cause agitation
which I always avoid. In short, he is surely to be considered a
maniac. I do not believe his feelings are by any means permanent,
only occasioned by the passing and present reflection and
occupation of writing to the unfortunate Being to whom they are
addressed."</p>

<p>The two of them surely formed the most hopeless problem that
ever the mind of woman broke itself against. That was her first
feeling as she sat with the two letters before her. Dr.
Lushington's wise words, which she had thought only worldly-wise at
the time, recurred to her, black and ominous. Had she indeed
succeeded in anything for which she had really struggled in
Augusta? She had kept her from open ruin, but was there not an
inward blight more ruinous still? Did her letters give any hope at
all?</p>

<p>She sat with the letters spread out before her, and the hours
drifted by and still she had not written. One must write not only
as if one hoped, but as if one were <i>sure</i> that all was well
and no traitor within the gates, and it was difficult.</p>

<p>At last she gathered herself together, applying every power of
mind and body to the task of foiling her husband again. She felt
that all now turned upon Augusta's refusal to see him if he should
return to England. If she wrote that as her ultimatum to him, and
persisted in it, it would be possible to believe that there was
some glimpse of a clearer and more steadfast purpose in Augusta
than any she had shown as yet. Would it not be best for Anne to see
her again and discuss the matter more clearly and firmly than could
be done by letter? Such meetings were inexpressibly painful to her,
but if it were the best way, how could she hesitate? Deciding that
it was the only way, she wrote at once.</p>

<p>They met in London. Augusta entered all eagerness and warm,
demonstrative affection and overwhelming gratitude.</p>

<p>"My dearest Bell! And how are you, and how is the child?
Millions of thanks for your kindness! You know how utterly I depend
upon your advice, and certainly this is a very difficult matter to
deal with, for in another letter he speaks of his return to England
as quite probable. Now, what is your opinion?"</p>

<p>Something in the fluent manner made reply very hard for Anne
Byron. She felt herself cold, stiff, ungracious, beside the
facility of the woman who was so pat, so ready. She answered
slowly.</p>

<p>"It does not seem difficult to me. I think it needs only firm
common sense."</p>

<p>"Common sense with him! My dear Bell, common sense and he have
never had the smallest relation to each other. I have never
attempted <i>that!</i>"</p>

<p>"Then is it not worth trying? To my mind the insult of the
'Manfred' publication gave you an opportunity of speaking with the
utmost plainness. You missed that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would not rouse his temper for worlds."</p>

<p>"What worse can he do than he has done? I think, for your own
sake and his, you should close the correspondence entirely. Break
it off short, and if he returns, entirely decline to see him."</p>

<p>"My goodness! But, Bell, you have not considered the effect on
my friends and relations&mdash;what must they think if I decline to see
him?"</p>

<p>Anne Byron looked her in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Is there one who has not heard the rumours you had nearly lived
down when 'Manfred' appeared? Is there one who would not understand
it as a motion of womanly dignity meeting an unforgivable
affront?"</p>

<p>"How am I to know what they would think? Really, I have been so
misused and maltreated by every one's misunderstanding me that I
have not a notion what is best to be done. I am the most
unfortunate being in the world. Tell me, what would <i>you</i>
do?"</p>

<p>"What I have said."</p>

<p>"But you have so much courage! I sometimes think you are made of
iron. And so much less to consider! Do but think of all my
relations and of his ungovernable angers!"</p>

<p>"Why should you think of them? Why not only consider what is
your duty? It makes it so much simpler."</p>

<p>Augusta raised her laced handkerchief to her eyes and wept a
little, gently.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is where you are so fortunate, dear. You see only one
side of a thing and of course you can go on without doubt. I see
every one's point of view and exactly how they feel it&mdash;and
certainly it's very confusing. Decision has never been my
<i>forte</i> in any circumstances, and, God knows, in the
present&mdash;But of course I know one ought to act right as far as one
can and leave the issue to God."</p>

<p>"Duties are ours; events are God's," said Anne Byron.</p>

<p>"Exactly what I feel, and a very fine saying&mdash;but all the same
it's very puzzling. Suppose I don't answer that wicked letter, and
suppose he writes: 'I wrote you such a letter, of such a date. Did
you receive it?' What on earth am I to say then? I <i>could</i> not
reply falsely."</p>

<p>"Why not be silent?"</p>

<p>"The risks! My dear Bell, have you forgotten his furies? What
would you think of acknowledging that my social position is wholly
in his power, and leaving it to his generosity to act
accordingly&mdash;if every spark of good feeling is not wholly dead?
That would be kinder, and to be acting right would be one's
consolation. Let us consider this and calculate the
consequences."</p>

<p>"I cannot calculate them. My only way of approaching the subject
is to consider what would be right to do. I think you are trifling
with a great danger. He will not rest until he has done you all the
temporal harm possible."</p>

<p>"My dear Bell, you terrify me! You sit there so pale and calm
and perfectly unable to comprehend all the fluctuations of a
disposition like mine. I never had your equability. You must not
expect it from me."</p>

<p>The truth of that struck home to the higher nature. Her pale
composure warmed into tenderness.</p>

<p>"Dearest Augusta, no. I do understand. I know what you have
suffered and are suffering. There is not a pain you can feel but
has its response in me. You know I have never tried to impose my
own opinions on you&mdash;never! I have wished you to decide on what you
think right, and then simply to help you through the difficulties.
But think&mdash;are half measures safe? If he knew you were resolute to
defy his power to harm you, would not this persecution cease?"</p>

<p>Augusta wept again, gentle, flowing tears.</p>

<p>"But surely it is the part of a Christian to consider his
welfare also? May he not be driven to the most desperate courses if
he thinks every door is closed against him? You forget his eternal
welfare."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, then Anne Byron said slowly:</p>

<p>"I think of it night and day."</p>

<p>Even Augusta could feel something of the deep passion hidden in
those words. She looked up, silent, startled, with wet eyes. In
that moment she had a glimpse of continents, worlds of feeling
entirely unknown to her. It was as though a fog had lifted
disclosing silver peaks motionless in clear air where never foot of
man could smirch the eternal snows. There was a long silence. They
receded into the heights, the mist closed about them again and at
length Augusta said tremblingly:</p>

<p>"Of course, whatever you tell me, I am bound to do&mdash;the merest
gratitude&mdash;"</p>

<p>Anne Byron leaned forward and clasped her hand.</p>

<p>"Indeed, you are not bound in any way! You must always do what
you think right. Who can judge for another? But, as I told you when
you opened your whole heart to me, though I will never injure you,
nor in that sense desert you, yet if you consented to receive him
if he returns, you and I must inevitably be separated. It could not
be otherwise. You must choose between us."</p>

<p>Augusta gave a little sobbing cry and tried to pull her hand
away, but Anne held it firmly.</p>

<p>"Think for yourself, dearest Augusta, and you will see it must
be so. Your hopes of influencing him for good are unfounded. What
foundation has there ever been for any hope of the kind? But this I
promise you: If he returns, and you receive him and so drive me to
break off my intercourse with you, I will do it in whatever way
will hurt you least. You can trust to that."</p>

<p>Still holding her hand, Anne looked at her with clear eyes of
hope. Augusta broke down into sobs.</p>

<p>"Really, the world is too difficult! I am sure I often Avish I
were dead. And you know I told you he is leaving his money to me
and the children, and you said you were delighted, and if I
offended him, goodness knows what might happen about that&mdash;and the
children so poorly provided for! Oh, my goodness, why can't I die
and be rid of it all?"</p>

<p>"Of course you must think of their future, but still&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused. What more was there to say? Wasted words, wasted
care. The world was dark in that moment.</p>

<p>Augusta sobbed on, then composed herself and regretted her
sensitive feelings.</p>

<p>"How I wish I could feel things less! Never was any one so
unlucky!"</p>

<p>She would consider; she would meet the question prayerfully.
Among other anxieties of his return would be the people he would
meet:</p>

<p>"I think, my dear Bell, one of the worst misfortunes to be
dreaded is that he would be clawed hold of by that most detestable
woman, Caroline Lamb&mdash;I know she's your relation by marriage, so
I'm sorry I can't disguise my horror of her, which <i>all</i> must
feel who know anything of her."</p>

<p>On that point Augusta was diffuse, as, indeed, on many other
irrelevancies, and half an hour and more drifted by in a confusion
of words which led nowhere and were not intended to do so. She got
herself away, voluble to the last, leaving the question exactly
where it had been on her arrival.</p>

<p>It was, then and later, impossible to fix Augusta to a promise
that there should be no personal intercourse if Byron fulfilled his
intention of returning to England. She was apparently quite unable
to see any reason against it. She wrote that there was nothing she
would not do, consistently with her duty to God and others, to
contribute to his good. How far she might be able to assist in
effecting a change of heart in him it was impossible to foresee,
the future being veiled from us. If she did but know how to
contribute to his <i>ultimate</i> good! But nothing should induce
her to see him again so frequently or in the way she had done...And
so forth.</p>

<p>Evasions and confusions, seasoned with religious aspirations,
through which it became impossible to track her. Mrs. Villiers
wrote to Lady Byron:</p>

<p class="letter">"I try to think her sincere, though there are
some things I cannot quite reconcile to my mind."</p>

<p>And Anne Byron, exhausted and foiled, knew with a knowledge
deeper than all reason that a test had been applied and had
revealed a rift between herself and Augusta never to be bridged by
true community of purpose. How can two walk together except they be
agreed on the true fundamentals of right and wrong?</p>

<p>Be that as it might, however, she must now bear the burden she
had shouldered. There was no undoing, in the world's eyes, the
friendship which had saved Augusta. Even if she would&mdash;and she
would not&mdash;that had fixed itself and could never be retracted.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Byron did not return to England; Augusta did not join him. Rumours
might continue, but she and her friends would always point
triumphantly to Lady Byron's confidence and friendship&mdash;Was it not
indeed very warmhearted and forgiving of Augusta to have pardoned
the cruel and vindictive harshness of the wife to a brother whom a
little mercy might have retrieved, whom the reverse had driven to
such desperate courses? And was it not quite credible that a woman
of such concentrated bitterness of nature might herself have been
the starting point for the rumours against a sister who most
naturally took her brother's part? No doubt she had repented later
and done her best to atone, but still&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER 24. SUNSET</h2>

<p class="poem">"There was in him a vital scorn of all<br>
As if the worst had fallen which could befall.<br>
He stood a stranger in this breathing world,<br>
An erring spirit from another hurled.<br>
A thing of dark imaginings that shaped<br>
By choice the perils he by chance escaped,<br>
But 'scaped in vain, for in their memory yet<br>
His mind would half exult and half regret."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Byron.</p>

<p>"To-morrow is my birthday&mdash;that is to say, at twelve of the
clock midnight, in twelve minutes, I shall have completed thirty
and three years of age! and I go to my bed with a heaviness of
heart at having lived so long and to so little purpose. It is three
minutes past twelve and I am now thirty-three.</p>

<p>"1821. Here lies interred in the eternity of the Past, from
which there is no resurrection for the days, whatever there may be
for the dust, the thirty-third year of an ill-spent life, which,
after a lingering disease of many months, sank into a lethargy and
expired, January 1821 A.D. leaving a successor inconsolable for the
very loss which occasioned its existence.</p>

<p class="poem">"'Through life's road so dim and dirty, I have
dragged to three and thirty. What have these years left to me?
Nothing, except thirty-three.'"</p>

<p>These words may well sum up the remainder of Byron's short life,
for whatever the outward conditions, life is lived in the interior
of the Dark Continent of man.</p>

<p>Outside happenings now went and came as unreal as clouds, and in
one sense affected him as little, for the inner world was fixed and
could not change, save in some earthquake shock of life or death,
and these seemed remote, as England drifted farther and farther
into the past. The pain was numbed, except at intervals. He saw
her, enclosed in the mists of her own North Sea, far and dim, the
pictures of his life there small, bright, and diminished like a
child's dream of a fairyland that never had been or could be. There
were times when he doubted that it all had ever happened.</p>

<p>And in England, with a few exceptions, he was remembered neither
fiercely nor tenderly now. A grey indifference slowly invaded all,
like the oncoming of twilight, with its forgetfulness of the hard
colours of the day&mdash;that twilight which brings all home, as he had
written in a poor imitation of Sappho&mdash;all home but himself.</p>

<p>Augusta wrote tediously still, with the old evasions and
mysteries, and it became more and more impossible to decipher what
she really meant&mdash;nor did it seem to matter now. The bondage to the
Guiccioli continued, dull and unbreakable, with the frightful
constancy of the illicit Italian love affair, expected by all the
onlookers to last until you tottered white-haired into the
grave.</p>

<p>Teresa Guiccioli, lived with daily (for she had now forsaken her
husband for good&mdash;or bad), was no more entertaining than a wife.
The honey-coloured hair was as beautiful and it was possible to
remember that sometimes, when a sunbeam struck it to glittering
gold, but difficult at others when it became only a yellow blot,
vaguely seen and about as interesting as mustard spilt on the
table-cloth.</p>

<p>Of course she never tired of it herself&mdash;a woman's beauty is
always her chief romance, fresh as spring. She expected the ardours
of the first day in Venice, and from the most easily wearied man of
pleasure in Europe, with a mind filled with ideal beauties whose
immortal loveliness and submissive sweetness no mortal woman could
match. The unfortunate Teresa! It is pleasant to reflect that a
capacious stupidity and vanity saved her from the worst wounds he
had it in his power to inflict.</p>

<p>For the delight of the boy in teasing and maiming still survived
and afforded him enjoyment of a sort in driving her to peevishness
and in ridiculing her. There were moments when the force of the
proverb, that it is better to be an old man's darling than a young
man's slave, impressed her with a strong sense of the wisdom of the
people who made proverbs for our instruction. And if her ancient
lord had been fond of money, her English lord was fonder.</p>

<p>He was a very much richer man now, for the hated Lady Noel was
dead and the inheritance divided between him and his wife. The name
also: he was henceforward Noel Byron, an addition which he affected
to despise and rejoiced in. He had thought it would be a fine
gesture to decline that money from the hand of his "moral
murderess," but when the time came it was much easier and
pleasanter to pocket it. Why not? A mere matter of business,
leaving him perfect independence to express his anger. Her trustees
had been business-like. He also had no sentiment. So events drifted
by. His child, Allegra, died at the age of five, in the convent
where he had sent her, alone among strangers, to the distraction of
the violent, hysterical Claire Clairmont, who was reaping the
bitter harvest sown by each and every woman who had thrown her fate
into Byron's hands. Did he at all care? He had told Moore he had no
parental feeling. Who can say? For the mother's grief he certainly
cared nothing. It was a disagreeable tie snapped for ever.</p>

<p>And now Shelley himself was gone&mdash;a spirit enfranchised, for
whose bright, unresting feet earth had been a place of thorns and
briars, free henceforward of the immortal ether. Men said&mdash;Byron
himself said&mdash;his life had been wasted, that was the truth. But
finer ears might hear a falling voice from heights unknown
reply:</p>

<p class="poem">"Untrue, Untrue! O Morning Star, O Mine,<br>
Who sittest secret in a veil of light<br>
Far up the starry spaces, say&mdash;Untrue.<br>
Speak but so loud as doth a wasted moon<br>
To Tyrrhene waters.&mdash;I am Hesperos."</p>

<p>Wasted, the sojourn of that exquisite spirit on earth? Never!
Had Byron loved him, he would have understood him, but he owned to
Mary Shelley later (and did not need to own) that he had no
friendship for Shelley nor any man, unless it were perhaps Lord
Clare (an imaginative recollection of boyhood). She had not
forgotten his cruel words&mdash;"How like them," when some base lie
concerning Shelley reached his ears.</p>

<p>He never knew love, either for man or woman. All his life he had
pursued those shining wings which immortally eluded him. But how
they were all passing! Foes and friends drifted away, cloud-like,
and mingled with the blue. Fantasy&mdash;illusion!</p>

<p>Solid facts, however, remained: the Guiccioli and her father,
now a burden not to be evaded, and the certainty that, without his
wife's aid, any hope of return to England was lost for ever.</p>

<p>The Noel money revived all his longing. If all had been
different, what a life he might have had! No such paradise as
England for rank and affluence, where every peer was a little
deity, and a peer with money a great one. Solid comfort and sober
magnificence which left all foreign attempts at imitation a
thread-bare tawdriness, and here in Italy, the wearisome monotony
of a petty society and petty interests, and&mdash;Teresa&mdash;Teresa!</p>

<p>It was then the thought began to shape slowly, vaguely, in his
mind of some great enterprise whereby he might reconquer the
imaginations of men. Something gallant, heroic, romantic&mdash;not with
the false romance of his scowling "Lara," not with the sensuous
romance of his "Donny Johnny," but what would surprise, compel,
admiration, however reluctant, of the sort which grave men called
true greatness. The world had never expected this of him, he had
never dreamed of it for himself, but yet&mdash;with long hesitations, it
seemed to him that there might be that in him too, if the place,
the occasion, were found.</p>

<p>So, pondering much on these things, it was that the star of
Hellas dawned slowly, doubtfully, in his misty skies. Greece. He
was conscious that a slow, subtle corrosion was invading his
powers&mdash;was it age? What was it? He remembered sometimes a saying
of Coleridge's, prosy enough, he had thought it, that if a man is
not rising toward angelhood, he is sinking toward devildom. If so,
what of it? In pursuit of that Luciferian ideal he had dared and
lost much, even in his verse, his sublimities dashed to pieces by
cutting too close with the fiery fourin-hand round the corner of
nonsense. Calm, serenity&mdash;what would those untried forces do for
him in mind and body if combined with a great and noble aim? Men
spoke of such things as redemption, and if England could see-ah, if
his wife could see&mdash;that he too could scale the golden heights,
might there not be the remission of sins of which one read idly as
wind, but which yet might have some undescribed meaning?</p>

<p>Perhaps these things would not have troubled him if he had been
interested in the life about him, but he was so lonely&mdash;so
desperately lonely. To rise in the morning to each desolate day was
more&mdash;almost more than he could endure.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Hobhouse came out on an Italian
visit, and they met. That was a breath of fresh air, though
scarcely an inspiration. One liked Hobhouse, but he was by no means
a trumpet call to deeds of chivalry. Still&mdash;still they talked,
seated on the loggia of the Villa Mira, with the hated Italian
landscape fading in twilight and leaving space for the phantasm of
England which Hobhouse brought with him. That drew near in the
moonlight&mdash;the grey majestic outlines of Newstead, looking down the
long lawns and glades, dreaming its Tudor and Stuart past. And who
was that standing at the door, holding a child by the hand and
laughing as she lifted her to see the dogs leaping on the grass?
His wife&mdash;the child&mdash;and that was "Boatswain"&mdash;how he would rush to
meet his master, wild with joy and pride! Dreams&mdash;dreams I Newstead
had passed into other hands, his wife hated him, the child knew
nothing of him and Boatswain was dead long years ago, and his place
knew him no more. And Hobhouse was talking and Teresa strumming on
her guitar inside. And still he could not banish his wife's
face.</p>

<p>It frightened him, the way these dreams recurred, and their
cruel reality. Indeed he must be up and doing if his brain were not
to slough away in ruin, that was plain. He would broach the matter
to his friend. It seemed a chance that Hobhouse had led the way to
the subject of Greece.</p>

<p>"It stirs the conscience of England," he said, "that the country
is making such a struggle to be rid of the Turkish yoke. After all,
when you think of all Europe has derived from Hellenic thought, it
is not surprising that should be so. Volunteers are going out and
money has been raised. The sinews of war are badly wanted.
Trelawney is going for one, and I could name many more. I own my
sympathies are with the business."</p>

<p>Byron meditated. At last:</p>

<p>"I hear Lady Byron takes up all sorts of crazes. Has Greece the
honour to be one of them?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of. But she is so quixotic that it probably
appeals to any feeling she has left over from her other good works.
As a matter of fact, Greece is an almost universal appeal. A
Christian country in bond to a Mahometan is a good battle-cry."</p>

<p>"The Turks are very fine fellows, however," said Byron,
absently.</p>

<p>"No doubt, in their own way, but they are not to be our masters,
and Greece concerns us."</p>

<p>Byron set this aside for meditation. Time with an English friend
was so precious that as much as possible must be discussed, and
then considered in the desolate hours while Count Gamba took snuff
and Teresa babbled dutifully to her fusty old parent.</p>

<p>"What about Caroline Lamb? How much further on her road to
Bedlam?"</p>

<p>Hobhouse was laconic.</p>

<p>"Nearly arrived, I should say. Of course you have read
'Glenarvon'? Come now, Byron, you never were such a blatant fool as
the hero! And yet there's a kind of misbegotten cleverness too. But
have you heard that she made a pile and burnt you in effigy at
Brocket with copies of your letters to swell the flame, and all the
village girls dressed in white dancing round and singing:</p>

<p class="poem">"'Burn, fire, burn, while wondering boys
exclaim,<br>
And gold and trinkets glitter in the flame.<br>
Ah, look not thus on me so grave, so sad.<br>
Shake not your heads and say the Lady's mad.'</p>

<p>"There was more that I don't recall."</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Byron, too petrified even for fury.</p>

<p>"Yes, and that about finished the Melbournes. William consented
to a separation at long last."</p>

<p>"And is he rid of her? Poor fool, I never hated him."</p>

<p>"Rid? Listen. I had it from Mrs. George. The lawyers prepared
the deeds, and she took not the least notice, busy with her
precious 'Glenarvon.' The deeds were brought for signature, the
family assembled in the library and William went up to her room for
a dignified last farewell. They waited and waited. Nothing. At last
young Lamb went up to see what had happened. He found her chair
pulled up to her husband's and she feeding him with tiny bits of
bread and butter, the separation blown to the winds! They are
together now."</p>

<p>"Women, women!" exclaimed Byron. "How in God's name are we to
deal with them! That a thing so contemptible should be
indispensable is what turns life into a flame-slinging Fury. How
had she done it?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. George Lamb said it was a pity. She told him in a kind of
terrified whisper that he must take care of her&mdash;he knew she never
could take care of herself&mdash;'Don't leave me, darling! Take care of
me!'&mdash;and then a soft subsiding sigh. She certainly is very
winning, and a queer kind of frightened innocence about her with it
all. But, by the way, have you heard that the gorgeous Lady
Blessington is coming here? There's quite another type. She will
amuse you. Her cracked reputation has not hindered great London
successes. She is a remarkably pretty woman."</p>

<p>So, when Hobhouse was gone, he left much behind him which he
little imagined, and the star of Hellas grew large and bright as
Hesperos in evening skies.</p>

<p>For a long time Byron had been beating against the bars,
revolving wild schemes: a flight to South
America&mdash;anything&mdash;anywhere. But if with flight one could combine a
cause which all the world held in honour, if one could achieve a
deed at which men would hold their breath, a deed high and great,
worthy of honour&mdash;why then, there would be a hush; they would say,
"He had that greatness in him, and we never guessed it. The past
wanes and is forgotten in the glory of the splendid present. He who
wrote so nobly of Greece has done nobly by her too, and her freedom
is the star of divine immortality upon his brow."</p>

<p>It would be to meet his wife on her own ground of high
unselfishness and surpass her. And if so&mdash;might she not pause,
look, listen?</p>

<p>No need to dwell on the steps he took to make his dream actual.
The world knows them. With passion he flung himself, his means, his
health, into the pursuit of that last dying vision.</p>

<p>Lady Blessington saw him at Genoa when once more "Childe
Harold's" barque was at the shore&mdash;lovely Lady Blessington, as she
still lives in Lawrence's delightful portrait, leaning forward, all
grace and brilliance, sparkling, smiling, the light, bright word
winged from the bow of charming lips, displaying to fullest
advantage the beautiful bosom and slim-girt waist which, with other
advantages, had raised the pretty Irish girl, in spite of her
flawed reputation, to the altitude of the peerage. With all her
Celtic and feminine quickness she describes him, her
disillusionments and delights in his company, the beautiful
features, thin almost to emaciation, the matchless voice, the
general air of weakness and disrepair&mdash;Apollo shining through a
mist.</p>

<p>Not difficult to discern that the radiance was dying, and that
as the shining sea receded faults came to light&mdash;ugly rocks hidden
before by the shimmering dazzle. She records with surprise that he
was not quite a gentleman&mdash;he who had charmed all hearts.
Amazing!</p>

<p>"Were I to point out the foremost defect I should say it was
flippancy and a total want of the natural self-possession and
dignity which ought to characterize a man of birth and
education."</p>

<p>She watched him with all the Argus-eyes of feminine intuition.
Lady Byron&mdash;he could not keep away from that subject, growing a
little garrulous as his nerves weakened and tears and words flowed
with facility. She thought him in very weak health, and her
impression was that he most earnestly desired a reconciliation.</p>

<p>"Whatever may be the sufferings of Lady Byron, they are more
than avenged by what her husband feels."</p>

<p>But were they? Could even the quick, bright Lady Blessington be
sure? The lights on the road to understanding him were marsh fires
at best. To Lady Blessington he revealed the secret of his life and
did not know that he had done it:</p>

<p>"If I know myself, I have no character at all."</p>

<p>Here is the answer to the riddle of heart, of mind, of taste&mdash;to
all the errors in the many analyses of Byron's character. The truth
is out. There was nothing to analyze. There was a brilliant
kaleidoscope of broken colours, which, stabilized, might have made
a character for the age's wonder, but it fell into patterns with
one shake of the hand and fell out with the next, and that was all.
There was the blood-red of sympathy and affection, the glittering
blue of wit, the diamond-white of intellect, the emerald of
onlooking and hope, but all jostled together into the mere pattern
of talk, no more, and scattering into incoherence when the talk
stopped. Everything by turns and nothing long.</p>

<p>She has preserved, too, a saying of his which casts a glare of
light on the vapidity of the women's figures in all his work. It is
they which have damned it to much desuetude in the public mind
(another vengeance of the implacable sex!).</p>

<p>"He who has known vice can never describe woman as she ought to
be described."</p>

<p>No, for he can see her only in relation to man. There is another
side to that changing moon, and it was beyond him for ever.</p>

<p>Emotion was the note of his later intercourse with the
Blessingtons, the tears flowing plentifully when the inevitable
moment of parting came.</p>

<p>"Poor Byron! I will not allow myself to think we have met for
the last time," she wrote with soft regret, the open door of
England before her, barred for ever to him.</p>

<p>So he made ready for Greece&mdash;Greece where he had been so happy,
long, long ago. He was wearied, frail, aging, though but
thirty-six, if one reckoned by the false count of years, full of
the old suspicions and irritations, ready to break out in flaming
angers, utterly unfit for the errand, needing a home, some kind
woman to treat him as the captious invalid he was and be patient
with him as a froward child, yet by no means past the shows and
pretences, desperately anxious to make the most of the occasion and
wear the <i>panache</i> of Hellas in his helmet&mdash;those helmets so
carefully designed by him for himself, Trelawney, and Gamba,
decorated with his own coat of arms and the terrors of nodding
plumage, while Gamba's bore the image of Athene, the Fighter in the
Front, for all men to see!</p>

<p>They never wore them, however, nor yet the flamboyant uniforms
of scarlet and gold. Misgivings set in. Greece did not seem to
expect them, and the helmets returned to the obscurity of their
cases. The child was wearying of his toys even when they lay before
him.</p>

<p>A most pathetic figure. He really cared little personally for
the adventure, felt most pitifully unequal to it, respected the
Turkish enemy far more profoundly than the Greek ally, and in the
bottom of his heart believed himself very probably doomed, from
some memory of a sibyl's prophecy which had warned him to beware of
his thirtyseventh year. Still, he would go&mdash;what else was there to
do?</p>

<p>But, as in leaving England for ever, so in leaving Italy, there
was one thing yet to be done.</p>

<p>Rail against his wife as he would, she was the one person he
trusted in a fleeting world. He knew her truth unshakable; her
promise, fulfilment; and that to no appeal to the highest in her
could she be deaf. It is very necessary for perfect understanding
of these strange letters, to remember what he really thought of the
wife he had lost. His summing up of her character occurs in the
vitriolic satire on Mrs. Clermont, written after the separation.
And thus he described her:</p>

<p class="poem">"What she (Mrs. Clermont) had made the pupil of her
art<br>
None knows, but that high soul secured the heart,<br>
And panted for the truth it could not hear<br>
With longing breast and undeluded ear.<br>
Foiled was perversion by that youthful mind<br>
Which flattery fooled not, baseness could not bind,<br>
Deceit infect not, nor contagion soil,<br>
Indulgence weaken, nor example spoil,<br>
Nor mastered science tempt her to look down<br>
On humbler talents with a pitying frown,<br>
Nor genius swell, nor beauty render vain,<br>
Nor envy ruffle to retaliate pain,<br>
Nor Fortune change, pride raise, nor passion bow,<br>
Nor virtue teach austerity, till now.<br>
Serenely purest of her sex that live,<br>
But wanting one sweet weakness&mdash;to forgive,<br>
Too shocked at vice her soul can never know,<br>
She deems that all could be like her below."</p>

<p>When the world assailed Lady Byron later, as it was to do, she
might have pointed in silence to that tribute from the husband who
had thrown her love away, and found it sufficient answer.</p>

<p>So, knowing to whom he wrote, he had written letters to
her&mdash;surely, in view of all the circumstances, the strangest ever
written by husband to wife of confession and entreaty.</p>

<p>He had insulted her again by the threat, for it can be called no
other, of the publication of his "Memoirs" after his death: "The
part you occupy is long and minute": and she had, by the advice of
her lawyers, briefly and coldly stated that she considered such a
publication "prejudical to our daughter's happiness"&mdash;there it
should end. But still he wrote, entreating her kindness for
Augusta, alternating his entreaties with imprecations and
insults.</p>

<p>She might well have been dumb, or have made clear the suffering
of her long and cruel servitude to Augusta's interests.</p>

<p>She did neither. She wrote to him for the last time and with her
own simple sincerity&mdash;not one unnecessary word. Those only which
bound her, as he knew, in life and death.</p>

<p class="letter">"When you first expressed the wish respecting
Mrs. Leigh which is repeated in your last letter, I promised to act
consistently with it. If the assurance of that intention would
conduce (as you state in a former letter and as appears from your
reiterated requests) to calm your mind, I will not withhold it. The
past shall not prevent me from befriending Augusta Leigh and her
children in any future circumstances which may call for my
assistance. I promise to do so. She knows nothing of this."</p>

<p>The man also is very visible in his confession and
acknowledgment.</p>

<p class="letter">"I acknowledge your note, which is on the whole
satisfactory, the style a little harsh, but that was to be
expected; it would have been too great a peace offering to have
been gracious in the manner as well as in the matter. Yet you might
have been so, for communications between us are like dialogues of
the dead or letters between this world and the next. You have
alluded to the past and I to the future. As to Augusta, she knows
as little of my request as of your answer. Whatever she is or may
have been, you have never had reason to complain of her; on the
contrary, you are not aware of the obligations you have been under
to her. Her life and mine, and yours and mine, were two things
perfectly distinct from each other: when one ceased the other began
and now both are closed. It is a comfort to me now beyond all
comforts that A. and her children will be thought of after I am
nothing. She and two others were the only things I ever really
loved. I may say it now, for we are young no longer."</p>

<p>Yes, young no longer. Youth, for both of them, had died in
youth.</p>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER 25. THE NIGHT</h2>

<p class="poem">"By grace of God his face is stern,<br>
As one compelled in spite of scorn<br>
To teach a truth he would not learn."<br>
<br>
&mdash;E. Barrett Bbowning.</p>

<p>So, knowing there was a promise never to be broken, he sailed
for Greece, and Italy, like England, receded into the past and was
no more.</p>

<p>Thoughts, hopes, were struggling in his mind.</p>

<p>The splendour of the adventure would lift him into a wholly
different sphere. This was to be no unreal poetic triumph, but a
noble stroke for the liberty of man. He, the despised and rejected,
had become a knight errant, and this a deed worthy of Lancelot du
Lac or Galahad himself. On returning to England he could point to
the enfranchised kingdom of the intellect of Europe as his life's
work, and who should say him nay? And it had been hinted&mdash;more than
hinted&mdash;that the crown of a freed Greece was to be one of his
rewards. King of Greece! The words echoed and re-echoed in his
ear.</p>

<p>Perhaps his brain was weakening already for the dream of ruling
in the City of the Violet Crown mingled strangely with his visions
of settling in England. But he could not control his imaginings.
Newstead haunted him. He would forget that another ruled there now,
and he saw his wife there with the child and himself, all united at
last, the bitter past drowned in glory.</p>

<p>There might be a reconciliation without much said on either
side. If she would have the wisdom to make no allusion to the past
nor would he. She might blot it out with softly flowing tears of
affection, warm and healing as spring rain, and then they could
settle down to peace. Surely she must realize how much he needed
her care? Though only thirty-six, he was growing old, and care is a
wife's duty in any circumstances.</p>

<p>All, then, might be very different from the unlucky obsession of
rhyme which had been one of the follies of his life and quite
unsuited to the preoccupations of a British peer or of a Greek
king. It was part of the madness which had ostracized him, an
undignified, uncontrolled spasm, too disagreeably like the vagaries
of Shelley to form any part of his dreams of the future. See where
it had landed him!&mdash;those mad verses to Augusta, those equally
foolish attacks on his wife. How right Hobhouse had been after all!
He began to realize that a man cannot throw mud at his wife without
some of it recoiling upon himself&mdash;that in the most unforeseen way
they do become one flesh, and that her cold wisdom of silence had
been the impregnable repartee. If he could but enlist her strength
and frigid good sense on his side, she might build up all that life
had broken.</p>

<p>After all, why not? Men lived as he had done and their wives
made nothing of it. Wives were, in his creed, not individual
persons, but a class, a caste, vowed to certain duties. They were
simply bad or good. A bad wife was&mdash;whatever her husband happened
to find inconvenient; a good wife accepted any conduct in her lord
which pleased him, with the sweet meekness of the approved feminine
Variant of the human stock.</p>

<p>Still, it would be kind to let her know that in some material
respects she would find him changed.</p>

<p>For one thing, he meant to govern his temper and his appetites.
It would not be desirable for Ada to see her father, "his face
absolutely festering with ill-temper and all the beauty of it
corrugated and made sore," as Leigh Hunt, who had had opportunities
of judging, described it. And another matter, still more important,
which he had discussed with Lady Blessington, her soft delicious
sympathy and some deplorable experiences of her own coinciding with
his views.</p>

<p>"Liaisons that are not cemented by marriage," he had said, "must
produce unhappiness. The humiliations and vexations a woman is
exposed to cannot fail to have a certain effect on her temper and
spirits which robs her of the charms that won affection. It renders
her susceptible and suspicious. Her self-esteem being diminished,
she becomes doubly jealous of him for whom she lost it, and if he
has the feeling to conciliate her, he must submit to a slavery much
more severe than that of marriage and without its
respectability."</p>

<p>There were memories of Lady Blessington's own which fully
confirmed this point of view. She looked at her lord's figure
through the window (he was walking with Count D'Orsay, her lover)
and she sighed softly. Marriage, wealth, respectability. Beautiful
words!</p>

<p>Mrs. Grundy&mdash;what goddess has her strength, the million-eyed,
the million-armed, the world-worshipped? And, as usual, her rebels
were her warmest converts. Madame de Stael was her prophetess, Lady
Blessington chanted her praises, and Byron sang the antiphon. Sick
of the muddle of his life, he beheld her as a saving Madonna, his
guide to the steps of a throne. A throne!</p>

<p>"If they make me the offer I may not refuse it," he said to
Trelawney on the voyage, as these thoughts slipped through his head
like the leagues of water from the ship's bow. And Trelawney smiled
in that unkempt moustache of his. No, he had never thought that
Byron would refuse such a glittering toy from any hand.</p>

<p>It is impossible to enter into the details of that witches'
caldron of Greek military and political affairs which he found on
landing. And the concern of those who would understand him is less
with outward than inward circumstance.</p>

<p>Nothing effective could at all be done. He poured out money and
counsel, bit nothing came of it. He was condemned to stagnate at
Musolonghi in frightful weather, with sordid surroundings, the air
heavy with malaria, and see all his hopes broken one by one.</p>

<p>It threw him back the more on his inward hopes, his wife and
child, two figures never far from his lips in discussing his
affairs with comparative strangers. It became exceedingly tedious.
Lead the conversation where they would, that theme inevitably and
embarrassingly returned. What could be said or done beyond assuming
a deeply sympathetic expression and skipping away from it again and
again? His wrongs and he were becoming more than a little
tiresome.</p>

<p>And the Greeks were hopeless. They wanted not so much Byron as
his money. His reputation lifted their adventure to the level of
European romance and therefore he was necessary, but, for the rest,
what could the little pale, irritable man, so obviously failing in
health, do for them? The turbulent insurgent chieftains with their
resounding names, Odysseus and the like, went their way, spent his
money and cared little enough when the longthreatening crash came
and epilepsy struck him down with cruel blow after blow&mdash;and he so
little fitted to bear them.</p>

<p>For now Greece dims into a blurred, confused agony, and Byron
passes into the borderland between life and death, where Pity and
Awe are the Angels of the Gate and human judgment is spent.</p>

<p>His lapses and struggles were no longer earthly, but were
resumed into the category of things unknown, incomprehensible to
us, Omniscience alone reckoning cause and effect with passionless
justice: the tainted springs of ancestry, hopeless childhood,
bitter youth, genius and beauty heaped into hands so weakened, and
all that flowed from these sources. Each man, having fulfilled the
tale of his days, passes to his own place and confronts his own
judgment bar, and for him that day of self-judgment, waiting
implacable in the darkness, was now at hand, every day bringing
him, bound and helpless, to its feet.</p>

<p>He had failed. It was too late. Greece had not failed: her day
of deliverance was near, though he would not see it. He had helped
to clear the ground, but not for him the building of the temple. He
lay dying, passing from the Known to the Mysterious, to the things
which now, filling earth and air, thundered on ears slowly
deafening to the sounds of a world sinking away like a faint star
on the horizon.</p>

<p>All that was daemonic in him had now departed and he lay, no
longer adequate to himself, no longer the demi-god, worshipped and
spurned by men who watched the tremendous spectacle of his life and
saw in him a being incomprehensible and unlike themselves. Yet in
the day when the battle-host of the gods was arrayed he did not
fear, and mercy is the smile on the face of Justice.</p>

<p>No tenderness about him: only the alarm and agitation of men of
differing nationalities&mdash;Tita, Gambo, Millingen and others,
unintelligible to each other in their frantic German and Italian in
the responsibility thrust upon them. For this man was not only the
hope of Greece, but the wide world's concern and they its trustees.
What account could they render of their stewardship if he died?</p>

<p>The doctors disputed, wrangled furiously, to bleed or not to
bleed, and the patient intervened, mad with pain and irritability,
and outside the rain poured and poured and did not cease, and
miasmas rose from the stagnant marshes, and the reports of failure
and demands for money came posting in like more deadly miasmas and
Byron was face to face with death, still hoping, and losing ground
every hour.</p>

<p>The impulsive foreigners jabbered and wept about him. Parry and
his faithful Fletcher, utterly bewildered by their hysteria and the
sudden stroke of fate, knew not what to do, and clung about him
helpless. The squalid discomfort of the room shut out the rain and
that was all. He lay, the blood trickling unstaunched down his face
from the bites of leeches applied to reduce the fever&mdash;a piteous
sight. Sometimes delirious, sometimes in his senses, still he hoped
and did not know the inexorable hour.</p>

<p>He spoke at intervals to Parry, who sat beside him.</p>

<p>"My wife, my Ada, my country! Since I have been ill, I have
given to all my plans much serious consideration. When other things
are done we will put the last hand to this work by a visit to
America. To reflect on this has been a pleasure to me. I had time
on board the brig to give full scope to memory and reflection. I am
convinced of the happiness of domestic life. No man on earth
respects a virtuous woman more than I do, and the prospect of
retirement in England with my wife and Ada gives me an idea of
happiness I have never experienced before. Heretofore my life has
been like the ocean in a storm."</p>

<p>She had sent him through Augusta a description, close and
detailed, of the child, which had evidently raised his hopes in
more ways than one. The past, then, was not irrevocable. They could
shatter this sorry scheme of things, the two of them, and remould
it nearer to the heart's desire. His, not hers.</p>

<p>And all the time death brooded over him, at once pardoning and
relentless. His mind wandered weakly through all the broken dreams
of the past. He was a Jew, a Mahometan: "Eternity and space are
before me, but on this subject, thank God, I am happy and at ease."
It moved Parry. He wrote:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"There was the gifted Lord Byron, who had been
the object of universal attention, who had, even as a youth, been
intoxicated with the idolatry of men and the more flattering love
of women, gradually expiring, almost forsaken, and certainly
without the consolation, which generally awaits the meanest of
mankind, of breathing out his last sigh in the arms of some dear
friend. His habitation was weather-tight, but that was all the
comfort his deplorable room afforded. The pestilent scirocco was
blowing a hurricane, and the rain was falling with almost tropical
violence. This evening was, I believe, the last time Lord Byron was
calm and collected for any considerable period."</p>

<p>And still the doctors wrangled over expedient after expedient,
Millingen scarcely comprehending Bruno, and hopeless confusion and
entanglement for both. At long last, a ray of hope from outside:
cheerful letters and commendations with promises of help for the
cause from England. They were hurried in, for they would have
gladdened him.</p>

<p>Too late. He was unconscious.</p>

<p>On the Easter Sunday of that wild April, a delirium which left
him exhausted but conscious&mdash;conscious also that death was upon
him. He called for Fletcher&mdash;quick, not a moment to lose! He had
much to say. He was panting and trembling, wild-eyed with anxiety,
struggling for strength to utter the words which must be said,
which unsaid would be the cruellest agony, groping in darkness
already and in the land where all things are forgotten.</p>

<p>"It is now nearly over. I must tell you all without losing a
moment."</p>

<p>"Shall I go, my Lord, and fetch pen, ink and papers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, no! You will lose too much time and I have it not
to spare. Now, pay attention."</p>

<p>The poor sobbing human breath struggled and fluttered, all but
inarticulate.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor dear child, my dear Ada. My God, could I but have
seen her! Give her my blessing, and my dear sister Augusta and her
children. And you will go to Lady Byron and say&mdash;tell her
everything&mdash;you are friends with her."</p>

<p>The brain reeled, the dying voice failed, but a word,
breathlessly listened for, could be caught at intervals. He was
muttering on, "very seriously," hoping, believing he could be
heard. He raised his voice often.</p>

<p>"Fletcher, now if you do not execute every order which I have
given you, I will torment you hereafter if possible."</p>

<p>Only a word here and there could be distinguished: "Augusta,"
"Ada," "Hobhouse," "Kinnaird."</p>

<p>The man, perplexed and terrified, losing his head in the awful
moment, could only stammer out that he had not understood a
word.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, then all is lost, for it is now too late! Can it be
possible you have not understood me?"</p>

<p>"No, my Lord, but I pray you to try and inform me once
more."</p>

<p>He looked up despairingly.</p>

<p>"How can I? It is now too late, and all is over."</p>

<p>Fletcher bent over him, bowed in the presence of the Mighty.</p>

<p>"Not our will but God's be done."</p>

<p>"Yes. Not mine be done. But I will try&mdash;"</p>

<p>He tried again and again, pitiably.</p>

<p>"My wife, my child, my sister! You must say all. You know my
wishes."</p>

<p>But they were unintelligible.</p>

<p>German, Italian, English, about him, a babel of tongues, and he
beyond all but anguish now. Parry loosened the tight bandage about
his head and he sighed with relief&mdash;"Ah, Christi!" and tears formed
in his eyes and rolled down his face.</p>

<p>Parry spoke tenderly:</p>

<p>"My Lord, I thank God. I hope you will be better now. Shed as
many tears as you can; you will then sleep and find ease."</p>

<p>He uttered a faint "Good night" and sank into sleep.</p>

<p>Once more he waked, muttered and stumbled hopelessly at the
words once more. Impossible. For him all human speech, all touch
with humanity, was broken.</p>

<p>"I must sleep now," he murmured, and the deep sleep which is the
advancing shadow of the last possessed him and closed the gates of
memory. It was Easter Monday when his eyelids fluttered, opened and
dropped for ever.</p>

<p>Outside the wild thunder was roaring and pealing like the
summons of doom. Outside the frightened, huddling people to whom
his name was a legend waited for news, and as the thunder broke
they cried aloud:</p>

<p>"The great man is dead."</p>

<p>All was over.</p>

<p>After the first silence of awe comes the horror of death as the
West meets it&mdash;the mangling, the embalming, in place of swift fire
and grey ash, for him who had implored that his ashes might rest in
the holy soil he had died to save.</p>

<p>So they sent him on his last voyage to the shut doors of
England, and silence fell on all who knew that daemonic force was
spent, that blazing torch plunged violently into the cold waters of
death, extinct for ever.</p>

<p>The evening brings all home, and as the ship glided up Channel
the shut doors opened to the guest whom none may refuse, and Byron
was once more in England.</p>

<p>In the glorious glooms of Westminster, where are the tombs of
men who have done true service to England as she counts it, was no
tomb for him. Some instinct, right or wrong, in the hearts of his
countrymen forbade it. Against him those gates were barred.</p>

<p>Why, they asked, should this believer in creeds that were
ancient when the Star of the East shone in Syrian skies, desire
rest in the silence consecrated by the Cross?</p>

<p>But England had a last, a long-delayed mercy for her son.</p>

<p>In her little villages stand the small churches, reaching far
back into their own antiquity, very still and quiet, gathering
their children, generation after generation, from cottages
clustering about their gates, from manor and hall and parsonage,
those who have built up the life of England in far lands or among
the remote country fields and woods. There they rest in peace. It
is not a great step for these people from the simple life outside
into the silence of the green churchyard or the little chancel with
its inscribed tablets and brasses. Here there is a great
tranquillity within, and without the dewy dawns and stealing
twilights come and go with noiseless feet.</p>

<p>Sunlight and moonlight fall alternate upon a marble tablet in
Hucknell Church, not to be distinguished from others until their
light irradiates the letters charged with meanings transcending all
human judgment.</p>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER 26. EPILOGUE</h2>

<p class="poem">Not with immortal flowers is wreathed thine
head,<br>
No, nor with laurel leaves of victory,<br>
But with keen steadfast stars we crown instead<br>
Thy soul&mdash;a lonely star, Antigone.<br>
<br>
&mdash;E. B.</p>

<p>Of the two women so tragically connected with Byron a little
must be said.</p>

<p>After his death Augusta Leigh slipped gradually away from the
friendship with Anne Byron. There were many reasons, but perhaps
the chief was that to drift was the line of least resistance, and
the difficulties of the alliance were then easier to realize than
its uses. But Fate had no mercy for her. Money difficulties were
overwhelming and the scandal involving her daughter, Medora Leigh,
must have seemed to her and some others the work of implacable
Furies.</p>

<p>Those who best know the history of her life declare that she
suddenly became a very sunk and aged person who had lived through
so much that at last she grew callous.</p>

<p>When she lay dying, Anne Byron broke through the silence of
years in an effort to heal and console. She wrote to the daughter
who was tending her and bid her whisper in her ear the words so
often used, so long disused: "Dearest Augusta." There were only a
few feeble gasps in answer&mdash;nothing that could be distinguished but
that those words were her greatest consolation. They must have
recalled much.</p>

<p>But the story closes on a nobler note.</p>

<p>Lady Byron, the mark of every ignorant abuse and
misunderstanding, survived her own daughter and Augusta Leigh, and
those two events changed her attitude towards the world's mistaken
view of the great tragedy. She resolved that, if her trustees so
judged, the innermost facts might be disclosed at a future time,
after her own death, fixing the year 1880, nearly a hundred years
after her husband's birth, as the earliest time for the
disclosure.</p>

<p>By a regrettable indiscretion it was disclosed, with many
inaccuracies, in 1869, nine years after her death. But that storm,
like others, has died away and matters little now.</p>

<p>She wrote in 1854, six years before her death, as "a calm
spectator of past events," who could at last prepare for their
disclosure:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"I see what was, what might have been, had
there been one person less among the living when I married. Then I
might have had duties, however steeped in sorrow, more congenial
with my nature than those I was compelled to adopt. Then my life
would not have been the concealment of a Truth, whilst my conduct
was in harmony with it. Think of me as a Memory, not as a Person,
for I desire not sympathy, but an impartial hearing. Yet, when I
look at the accumulation of difficulties in my way, I feel that the
truths I bring forward will but partially dispel those illusions so
long accepted as realities, and that even if not a fruitless, it is
yet an ungrateful task to translate fascinating verse into bare
facts. Apart, however, from any view to benefit the Unknown Reader
who may have little disposition to attend to me, I naturally desire
to leave a few counter-statements for the information of my
grandchildren, for I own that on that point the opinion formed of
me does touch me."</p>

<p>These words, in their stark simplicity, are the measures of her
great virtues and small defects.</p>

<p>She did not desire sympathy, and that measures her loss: the
staying of the tides of the heart that loves and is alien to no
human feeling. She gave sympathy abundantly, generously, but cared
little to accept it in return; her long battle had made her
self-sufficing. Life, for her, had frozen into duty; but as beneath
the surface of ice lie blue and living waters to be released into
sunshine with the spring, so it was with her. Her heart could never
freeze at its source, for its waters flowed from the Hills of
Heaven.</p>

<p>When Fletcher brought her the news of the last struggle for
speech at Missolonghi, her stately composure broke down into an
agony of grief&mdash;wringing her hands, sobbing, imploring him to
remember words he had never heard. But the ice closed again over
the surface.</p>

<p>She surrendered her place in society, for it had grown worse
than worthless to her&mdash;a dangerous and terrible Vanity Fair where
souls were the merchandise. And so, dedicating her life to good
works, she hardened into a Puritan who might well be mistaken for a
kill-joy, and this too fed the ignoble stories of those whose
interest and pleasure it was to assert that her heartless coldness
had driven Byron to his ruin.</p>

<p>Her friendship with Augusta Leigh was misread and misunderstood
exactly as her advisers had foreseen, and the one woman was
justified while the other bore the burden of most cruel
misrepresentation.</p>

<p>Who could believe in such a romance of self-sacrifice? Not the
world, winch goes on its loud way, accepting only the things after
its own nature and jeering at all else.</p>

<p>Failure. Augusta had not fled from England, but there again the
advisers were right and the woman who had bled in spirit for her,
wrong. Her character remained what it had always been in
essentials, but hardened by the fight for existence, strengthened
in self-deceit by her morbid anxiety for self-preservation. She
could act with ingratitude to the friend to whom she owed all. The
miracle for which Anne Byron had sacrificed herself had not been
wrought, never could be: the stuff was not there to work on, the
day was not yet.</p>

<p>But was it failure? Even to herself it had not been all gain.
The happiness in her nature had no room to blossom, she went
starved all her days by that painful struggle which to her also
might well seem defeat. No intellectual triumph on which her
friends might congratulate her was hers.</p>

<p>But there are victories with no sound of drums and trumpets. The
longing after the Unattainable is higher than its achievement, and
conquest is not synonymous with the art of being happy. This woman
had the divine instinct to save, and having it, every spiritual
force fought on her side, and however she might seem worsted to
herself and others, the ultimate issue is sure, for it rests on the
foundation of the Universe.</p>

<p>There were moments when she saw victory, though but as a faint
light on a far horizon. Was it none that near the end of her life
she could say to a man who had known the deeps and heights of human
nature: "I loved her always. I love her still"? And in the woman so
loved surely must also have been the seed of brightness, to develop
one day into radiance. The one is the promise of the other.</p>

<p>So she endured, steadfast to the end, sometimes mistaken enough,
but&mdash;enduring.</p>

<p>There is something of the quality of great sculpture in the
marmoreal calm of her life. In some ways a great woman, in others a
most cruelly maimed one. For the full tide of love was in her, but
its expression, save in action, was thwarted and silenced. None who
knew her but must honour her. None could love her but those who
understood her, and they were few&mdash;she did not desire they should
be many.</p>

<p>Perhaps a note by the famous sculptor, Thomas Woolner, in its
grave simplicity best sums up the work that life and death had
accomplished in her:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Yesterday I had to go and see a cast taken of
the left hand of Lady Noel Byron, wife of the poet. The summons
said it was essential that an honourable man should do it, or I
should not have been troubled. I do not much like taking casts of
any one dead, but could not refuse in this case as I knew so many
of their friends. But I am glad I did go, for a nobler sight I
never saw. She looked as if she were living and had just dropped
asleep, and as proud as a Queen in all her splendour. I think there
never was anything finer than her brow and nose. She seems to have
been almost adored by those about her."</p>

<p>One compares this with the lovely child-portrait of this lady by
Hoppner&mdash;the soft thought and dignity of the sweet child face&mdash;and
marvels at the mysteries of life and death.</p>

<p>"To lower natures the olive, the vine and the verdure. To these,
the solitude of the stars, the cry of the thunder: Light, light
alone, and the deep gloom of the passing cloud."</p>

<p>But solitude immeasurable.</p>
