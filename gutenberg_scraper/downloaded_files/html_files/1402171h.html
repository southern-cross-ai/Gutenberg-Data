<br>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> purpose of the following pages is
to lay before persons desirous of emigrating a short, but
impartial, statement of the condition of the colony of Western
Australia, commonly called the Swan River Settlement. The object
of the writer is not to exalt its advantages above those of other
colonies. His statements are put forward neither from motives of
private interest, nor to forward the views of any party or
associated body whatever; and he trusts that, however brief, his
statement will be found throughout essentially correct.</p>
<p>That the subject of colonization is an important one, not only
to the legislator, but to the simple citizen, no one in the
present state of our population will be inclined to question.
That it is felt to be so, the state of the press fully
demonstrates. The published accounts of colonial resources and
expectations held out to the emigrant form, at present, a
considerable branch of our periodical literature, and are sought
after with avidity. It is to be feared, however, that much of
what is thus communicated to the public has no better authority
than the expectations of the sanguine, or the prejudice caused by
failures that arise from the absence of those qualifications
which all emigrants, especially those to a new colony, should
more or less bring with them; as their undertaking, even under
the most favourable circumstances, is an arduous one, requiring
judgment, perseverance, and fortitude.</p>
<p>The author writes for the enterprizing, but rational and
sober-minded, emigrant. If the account he has to give of the
resources of Western Australia present unexpected attractions, he
has no explanation to offer. He only relates what he believes to
be true. The task in which he engages he has undertaken with
reluctance, literary composition being foreign to his habits; but
since his return to England early in the past year, its urgency
has been impressed upon him, from conversations he has had with
persons of all classes (including well-informed individuals in
and out of Parliament) who feel an interest in the settlement. He
has found that the general impression on their minds is, that no
satisfactory conclusion could be arrived at respecting that
colony, the existing accounts of it being so contradictory; and
that families in different parts of the kingdom are still in
uncertainty, after having long since commenced arrangements for
emigrating thither.</p>
<p>The information of the author respecting Western Australia has
been acquired during a residence there of from four to five
years. He proceeded thither in command of the troops with the
expedition that founded the colony in 1829; and, on Sir James
Stirling's return to England in August 1832, the government
devolved upon him, which he continued to administer for upwards
of a twelvemonth, leaving the colony the latter end of September,
in the following year. In the course of his official duties, he
visited more than once King George's Sound, and the other
stations on the coast, and in the interior. It may also be well
to mention that he has held an arable farm for several years on
the Swan, and has been a director of the Agricultural Society
established in the colony: he is, consequently, enabled to speak
on the subject of farming there, from some experience of his own.
And lastly, since his return home, he has had, through both
public and private channels, regular accounts of the progress of
the settlement up to the latest arrivals.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Swan River district is situated in about 32° south latitude,
and 116° east longitude. It resembles in temperature (to speak
from the author's recollections of his residence in those
countries) the south of Italy, parts of Spain and Portugal, and
the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>A register of the weather on the Swan * is furnished in the
concluding pages of this pamphlet, and shows the extremes of
temperature during a year. In that instance the thermometer was
kept in a hut, and ranged fifteen degrees above the highest point
it attained in a brick-house, which was 91°. It there appears
that rain was plentiful for six months successively, and that
partial showers fell throughout the remainder of the year, except
in January. It is here to be remarked, that in the wet season the
rains seldom last longer than three days at a time; and that
there are intervals of beautiful weather, frequently for ten days
in continuance. King George's Sound, in about 35° south latitude,
and 118° east longitude, is remarkable for the mildness of its
climate, and for having rains every month. By an extract from a
meteorological journal,** kept for a year at that place, the
weather appears to be cooler in summer, and warmer in winter,
than at Swan River. But, although it has the advantage of a more
even temperature, the author himself decidedly prefers the
climate of Swan River, which is drier. In this preference, it is
probable that most persons who have resided in India and other
tropical climates, would coincide. At Swan River, although the
heat is generally great from three to four months, for several
hours in the day, the air, even then, is refreshed by the sea
breeze, and the remainder of the day and night is sufficiently
cool and agreeable. During the rest of the year, such is the
weather, that few would desire any alteration in it.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix, No. 1.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Appendix, No. 2.]</p>
<p>It is well known that a high temperature is more or less
tolerable, in proportion to the degree of moisture in the
atmosphere; and this has enabled the author to account for the
fact, that he suffered little comparative inconvenience from the
heat at Swan River, when the thermometer there indicated a
temperature several degrees higher than it had done at Bombay at
times when he had felt the heat at the latter place very
oppressive.</p>
<p>In point of salubrity, Western Australia is equal to any
country the author has visited or heard of. The health of the
troops was put to a severe trial there, especially the first
year. Being few in number, they had frequently harassing duties
to perform: often, after marching throughout the day under a
powerful sun, they have lain down to rest, exposed to the
deleterious influences of the night air; and, at other times,
subjected to all the inclemencies of the winter season. Such
service would have invalided many men in most other countries;
but after being four years in that climate, the troops continued
in good health, with the exception of those who suffered from
their intemperate habits.</p>
<p>Of the settlers, some who declared they could not live in
England from asthma, or other complaints, have enjoyed such
robust health, that they have performed exploring excursions on
foot, for several days successively, carrying their provisions,
and sleeping under trees. The annexed reports of two physicians,*
who have practised several years in the colony, will be found
corroborative of this statement.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix, No. 3.]</p>
<p>The country near the coast generally presents either an open
forest, plains covered with short brushwood mixed with grass, or
open downs. Numerous lakes, fresh and salt, extend along the
coast, as do also hills and ridges of recent calcareous
formation. A peculiar feature of this coast is a succession of
estuaries, each a receptacle of several rivers, and connected
with the sea by a narrow mouth.</p>
<p>A great variety of flowering shrubs cover the country in many
parts, and, occasionally, lofty trees with wide-spreading
branches embellish its surface. But, however it may please the
lover of nature, the aspect of the coast districts is not
generally inviting to the farmer, the soil being of a light sandy
character, and mostly unfit for agriculture. That in the vicinity
of the rivers and lakes, however, is of a different description,
being alluvial, and generally covered, in a state of nature, with
rich pasture, When under cultivation, it bears heavy crops of
wheat and other grain.</p>
<p>The higher ranges of hills are of primitive formation,
occasionally showing the bare granite rock. On these hills, and
between the ranges, where the country is from 500 to 1000 feet
above sea level, the soil is mostly of the red marl formation,
and generally good, bearing fine forests of native mahogany and
other timber. There is feed for sheep on the hills next the coast
district, and rich pasture of wild vetch and other herbage for
cattle in the ravines. Some land between the ranges seems, but
for the lofty timber it bears, wholly sterile: so forbidding is
its aspect, from the ironstone with which it abounds, that it
resembles districts the author has seen in Sicily, that were
overspread with cinders from Mount Etna.</p>
<p>The banks of the rivers, especially of the Swan, present
scenery much admired by all who have visited the country. In some
parts both borders exhibit extensive meadows, ornamented with
trees and flowering shrubs. Elsewhere, high precipitous banks
look down on grassy plains on the opposite side. These banks are
enamelled with a profusion of the amaranthine tribe of plants
(the everlasting flower), and crowned with noble mahogany and
other lofty trees.</p>
<p>The most valuable tracts of land are in the interior, to the
east of the Darling Range of mountains; and similar tracts
approach to within twenty-five miles of the coast, in the
south-east parts of the colony, between Cape Leeuwin and King
George's Sound. The best land of these tracts is not confined to
the vicinity of lakes, rivers, or hills, as is mostly the case on
the west side of the mountains, where the principal body of the
settlers are at present located.</p>
<p>The only district occupied beyond the Darling Range is called
York, and is from fifty to sixty miles from the sea coast. The
same name has been given to the projected chief town, the site of
which is laid out on the river Avon. This river, flowing from the
south, has a north-westerly direction in passing York, and has
been lately found to wind through one of the yanks of the Darling
Range, and to be identical with the Swan. The Avon varies greatly
in width. In some parts, where there are fine reaches of one or
two miles in length, it is sixty and seventy paces broad, with
high banks. Like the Swan and some other rivers on the coast, it
is, in the dry season and towards its source, but a chain of
pools, until filled by the winter torrents.</p>
<p>The climate of York is reckoned cooler than that of the Swan.
There have been established in this district, for the space of
several years, arable and grazing farms; and the proprietors find
the country well suited for both, although the crops raised there
are not equal in quantity to the produce of the rich alluvial
plains of the Swan, Canning, and other rivers in the coast
districts.</p>
<p>The fine condition of the herds, the last time the writer
visited the district, showed the pasture to be good. Indeed, so
very nutritious is the herbage, that a farmer there assured him,
he gave no other food than the hay of that country to a team of
English horses, which appeared in excellent condition, although
employed in drawing heavy loads across the Darling Range.</p>
<p>But the interior of Western Australia is particularly valuable
for its sheep pastures. These are extensive tracts of undulating
surface, covered with a short sweet grass, and are found to be
admirably suited for Merino flocks. Those of Messrs. Bland and
Trimmer, which have been there some years, fully justify this
assertion, from their rapid increase and healthy condition. Sheep
are there exempt from a disease (supposed to originate from
feeding in marshy pastures), from which several flocks to the
west of the range have suffered severely. In a report printed in
the Colonial Gazette of August last, we find Dr. Harris, a
physician who is settled on the Swan, and has ably written on the
disease alluded to, thus addresses the Agricultural Society of
the colony:&mdash;"No country in the world can boast of grounds
more favourable for sheep than the York district of this colony
(only about fifty miles from the coast), where some flocks have
been for some time established with such success, as to dispel
every doubt, and cheer the prospects of the settlers at
large."</p>
<p>The scenery of the interior districts is in many part;
beautiful&mdash;the undulations of hill and dale, ornamented with
clumps of trees and shrubs, present a rich and cheerful aspect.
On one occasion, when riding over a tract of this description, of
which he particularly wished to gain an accurate knowledge, the
author was accompanied by an experienced and intelligent English
farmer; and, after an attentive examination of it during a whole
day, which they devoted to that object, the farmer coincided with
him in opinion, that the tract was well adapted for agricultural
or pastoral purposes, but especially for sheep. In accordance
with the observation before made, that the quality of the will to
the east of the range does not depend on the neighbourhood of
rivers &amp;c., they found the land between three and four miles
from the river superior to that on its banks.</p>
<p>In the interior, alternating with the fertile districts, are
to be found extensive tracts of inferior land. They are either
clayey soil on which the water lodges in winter, or sandy, or
soils impregnated with salt. These lands afford little herbage,
and generally bear forest trees thinly distributed over the
surface. The banks of the salt pools are mostly covered with
samphire.</p>
<p>The seed time is long and favourable, and lasts from early in
May to the end of August. The writer has had, indeed, a good crop
of wheat sown so late as the 15th of September; but it grew on
alluvial soil&mdash;and land should be of this description, or in
good condition, to admit of seed being put in so late even as
August. Experience, however, has proved that the earlier the seed
is sown the better.</p>
<p>Showers commence in March, and increase in duration and
heaviness till August; from which period to November they
gradually diminish. In September there is heavy rain, and fine
showers fall in October and November. By December the grain is
ripe, and therefore suffers nothing from lack of moisture.</p>
<p>There is little or no rain in December, January, and February;
but in these months the dews are heavy. The grain (which sheds
little) may, consequently, be left without injury a long time in
the fields, to suit the convenience of the farmer.</p>
<p>Hay is cut in November, and may be made up six hours after
cutting, without risk of its heating in the stack.</p>
<p>It is apparent, from what has been said, that the farmer is
highly favoured in both seasons&mdash;in seed time and in
harvest.</p>
<p>Although the grass is much burnt up in the summer, live stock
keep in good condition upon it; and young cattle are remarked to
be as large at nine months old as they would be in England at
twelve: this is attributed to their being enabled to graze all
the year without penning up.</p>
<p>The wheat of the colony is a fine grain, and samples of it,
sent to England, have been highly approved of, and preserved for
seed there. It averages from 62 lbs. to 65 lbs. the bushel, and
some of it has weighed 68 lbs.</p>
<p>The average of the crops by the acre has not been great. It
has been computed at twenty-five bushels the English acre; but
the calculation has not been made with accuracy. The imperfect
mode of cultivation should here be borne in mind, as the probable
cause of so moderate a produce, compared with instances,
hereinafter adduced, of the fertility of the soil. The following
is an experiment, made two years in succession.</p>
<p>A piece of alluvial land, measured with exactness, and sown
with wheat, gave, the first year, a produce at the rate of
forty-three bushels; and the second year, of very nearly
sixty-one bushels to the English acre, without the aid of manure.
The latter is a return which farmers consider equal to that of
the best land in England, under the most improved culture. Some
oats, being the second crop raised from the same description of
land, cultivated two, years in succession, were, by an
experienced farmer, judged by the eye to yield from ten to twelve
quarters the English acre. The barley grown in the colony is
mostly Cape barley&mdash;a large four-sided, grain, giving a
heavy produce. It makes fine malt, as has been ascertained: for,
from a bushel and a half of it (dried in the sun) and one pound
of hops, twenty gallons of good ale and fifteen of small beer
have been brewed.</p>
<p>Turnips, particularly the Swedish, give a weighty and sure
crop. Potatoes produce very fair crops, and, in the alluvial
soils, good ones, without manure.</p>
<p>The sandy lands, which have more or less of loam in them, are
becoming more valued every year, and heavy crops of wheat and
barley have been had from them with the aid of very little
manure. Some of the land which gave this return, bore, when in a
state of nature, the grass-tree only, and was cultivated solely
from its being near the farmer's residence.</p>
<p>The productive powers of even inferior sandy soils are often
extraordinary, and show what the combination of heat and moisture
effects in this country. At Perth and Fremantle, vegetables and
fruits of fine size and flavour have been produced in sand,
without manure. In the former town a radish, growing in sand, was
exhibited in 1833, which measured, round the root, more than four
feet; and a plant of mangel wurzel, in sandy soil of a better
quality, on the Upper Swan, was six feet in circumference.</p>
<p>It ought to be noticed here, that the country has not yet been
visited by a drought; and, from its situation on the west coast
of the great continent of New Holland, it seems secured from such
a calamity; as the westerly winds, which prevail during the
winter, bring with them from the sea an abundant supply of rain,
at the most seasonable time of the year.&mdash;The great
advantage the colonists derive from their position in this
particular, will be more apparent, if we refer to what the
settlement at Algoa Bay, in South Africa, suffered in its
infancy, and does still suffer occasionally, from want of rain.
The author is the more impressed with the great advantage that
Western Australia derives from its situation by having, about
three years ago, seen letters from Sydney, on the opposite side
of the continent, written by a large landed proprietor in New
South Wales, which stated that, from a succession of droughts for
several years previous, much distress had been occasioned there,
and that the settlers did not know where to find pasture for
their numerous flocks and herds.</p>
<p>The following circumstance, showing the increasing extent of
that colony, was mentioned by a settler in New South Wales, who
visited Swan River last year, with a view, as was understood, of
ascertaining on what terms land there could be
purchased:&mdash;in order to pasture on unappropriated lands his
flocks (amounting to from 30,000 to 40,000 sheep), lie had, a
short time previous, been obliged to take up his abode in the
interior, four hundred miles from Sydney.</p>
<p>As vegetation in Western Australia continues throughout the
year, a succession of crops of potatoes and other vegetables may
always be had wherever irrigation can be secured.</p>
<p>The following vegetables grow in the open air (if only common
pains be taken), namely, tomatos, pumpkins, gourds, vegetable
marrow, chillies, eggplants; also every English vegetable, and
the following fruits:&mdash;melons, bananas, almonds, figs,
grapes, peaches, strawberries, and Cape gooseberries, all of
which have come to perfection. The olive, pomegranate, apricot,
plum, mango, lemon, and orange; the mulberry, apple, nectarine,
pear, and various other trees, have not yet had time to bear
fruit, but are growing well. Fig-cuttings produce fruit the first
year, and vines frequently do so the second year. Oaks, and other
timber trees from England, are likewise thriving.</p>
<p>Mr. Drummond, the Government botanist&mdash;for several years
in charge of the public garden at Perth, says, in a report on its
progress:&mdash;"The vines planted in May 1831 have made shoots,
in what is past of this season, sixteen feet long, and the
strongest and finest wood I have ever seen; the olives brought
out by Captain Mangles, R. N. have been laid, and produced 150
plants; all the other plants in the garden thrive as well as the
best friends of the colony can wish."</p>
<p>The same gentleman has expressed his opinion, as the result of
his experience, that the climate of Swan River is peculiarly
adapted for the growth of the vine, the olive, and the silk
mulberry.</p>
<p>The forests afford abundance of timber suitable for house and
ship building, cartwright's work, and cabinet-making. The
mahogany of the country is in great plenty. With this wood
principally, the Success frigate was repaired in Cockburn Sound;
and when she was afterwards overhauled at Portsmouth, the
officers of the dock-yard found this timber answering so well,
and in such perfect preservation, that, on their report, the
Lords of the Admiralty instructed Sir James Stirling to send a
quantity of it to England, at a price exceeding, by more than
fifty per cent, that allowed for African oak: specimens of it
(taken out of the Success, when she was overhauled on the above
occasion) are preserved in the model room of the Surveyor General
of the Navy, at Somerset House.</p>
<p>The blue gum tree (which, in the south east parts of the
colony, grows to a gigantic height, and to which it will be
necessary again to advert) has been estimated by an eminent
ship-builder in England, to be equal, if not superior, to teak,
for ship-building.</p>
<p>The opinion of the colonists themselves respecting the quality
of the soil, as expressed in one of their addresses to the
Governor on his return to Swan River in August last, is thus
reported in the Colonial Gazette: "The experience of the interval
between your departure and return has been of the greatest
utility in establishing from facts (without the necessity of
resorting any further to theories), the fertility of a large
portion of the soil of this colony, when under proper
cultivation; and the peculiar adaptation of the great mass of
land beyond the Darling Range, in soil, herbage, and climate, to
the pasturage and rearing of sheep."</p>
<p>The following extract from the report of an overland
expedition from Swan River to King George's Sound (a distance of
from two hundred to three hundred miles) is here given, in order
to show the little probability of good land becoming scarce in
the settlement for many years to come. It is written by the
conductor of the expedition, Captain Bannister, an intelligent
settler, who had travelled in Greece, and other European
countries resembling Western Australia in climate.</p>
<p>He thus writes&mdash;"From the 23rd" of December "to the 5th
of January, we pursued a south-by-east course, for eighty or
ninety miles of actual distance, through, in many tracts, a
country which surpassed our most sanguine expectations. A very
great proportion of this tract was land of the finest
description, fit for the plough, sheep, or cattle. The beauty of
the scenery, near to and distant from the rivers which we
crossed, is equal to any I have seen in the most cultivated
timber country in those parts of Europe which I have happened to
pass through."</p>
<p>Brevity renders it necessary to omit Captain Bannister's
description of rich scenery, and fertile soil, which lie gives in
other parts of his report; but the following is an account of
what may be deemed one of the most magnificent productions of
nature in the vegetable kingdom.</p>
<p>Referring to the country passed over on the 6th and the 9th of
January, this officer says,&mdash;"The trees were principally the
blue gum; and, if others had not seen them, I should be afraid to
speak of their magnitude. I measured one; it was, breast-high,
forty-two feet in circumference, and in height before a branch,
140 or 150, we thought, at least; and as straight as the barrel
of a gun: from the immense growth of these trees, I formed an
opinion that the land upon which they grew could not be bad; what
little we did see was a brown loam, capable of any cultivation,
and, where the underwood was not remarkably thick, grass and
herbage grew luxuriantly:"</p>
<p>It should be observed that no other expedition has explored
the country described by Captain Bannister; and that as he
travelled in the summer or dry season, it must have appeared,
from the effects of the sun, to great disadvantage.</p>
<p>The country in the south-east parts of the settlement is
described by an enterprising traveller, Dr. J. B. Wilson, R.N.
After an excursion of ten days, which he made from King George's
Sound, this gentleman (who is a large landed proprietor in New
South Wales) thus speaks of the country he observed on the eighth
day:&mdash;"I have seen many far-famed views in the four ancient
divisions of the globe, and have ix hesitation in saying that
this of the fifth (if it did not surpass) fell but little short
of any of them." Elsewhere he says,&mdash;"The timber,
principally blue gum, is the finest I ever saw." At the close of
his journal, he gives this opinion of the country he had
explored:&mdash;"I do not hesitate in saying, without fear of
future contradiction, that the area passed over contained as
much, perhaps more land fit for all rural purposes, than any
portion of equal extent (at least as far as I know) in New South
Wales." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* The statements of these two travellers have
been taken from a work published in 1833, by J. Cross, 18
Holborn, entitled "Journals of several expeditions made in
Western Australia, during the years 1829, 1830, 1831, and 1832,
under the sanction of the Governor, Sir James Stirling." In the
Appendix to that work is contained much interesting and useful
information, and from it are taken the journals of the weather at
Perth, and at King George's Sound; and also the reports of the
two physicians adverted to under the head of climate.]</p>
<p>Among those to whose enterprize and exertions the colonists
are indebted for very valuable information respecting their
territory, it would be injustice to omit the name of Lieut. Dale,
of the 63rd regiment, who has been engaged, perhaps more than any
other person, in exploring the interior at Swan River and King
George's Sound.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** This officer has executed, with remarkable
fidelity, a Panoramic View of King George's Sound and the
adjacent country.]</p>
<p>To this officer the colonists are indebted for the discovery,
in August 1830, of the country to the eastward of the Darling
Range, by far the finest district yet occupied. His services in
the Survey Department, to which he was attached for several
years, were deemed so important, that the Governor more than once
expressed his sense of them, in his dispatches to the Secretary
of State.</p>
<p>On the early state of the Swan River Settlement a short memoir
will be found in the first number of the Journal of the Royal
Geographical Society, by Sir John Barrow, whose knowledge and
judgment on all subjects connected with newly-explored countries,
render any information from him on these points peculiarly
valuable. To this is annexed an interesting paper by that most
eminent botanist, Mr. Robert Brown; and a description of the
natives of King George's Sound. This last paper goes fully into
all the details of the habits and character of these people, and
is drawn up with great perspicuity by Scott Nind, Esq., who
accompanied, as a medical officer, the first detachment from
Sydney stationed there. A valuable work on the natural history of
the colony may also be expected (should the delicate state of his
health permit) from Mr. Collie, the colonial surgeon, already
known for his able and scientific researches made during a voyage
round the world in his Majesty's ship Blossom, to which
expedition he was attached as naturalist.</p>
<p>There is a plentiful supply of white fish on the coast,
including the snapper, and many others not known in Europe. Some
of them are well flavoured, and similar to the cod, haddock,
&amp;c. Fish have been taken in large quantities off Rottnest
Island (outside Gage's Roads), in Cockburn Sound, at the Murray
River, and elsewhere. Some samples sent to foreign markets have
brought good prices; and there is no doubt but that when capital
and enterprise are employed in this speculation, it will prove a
fruitful source of wealth to the colony&mdash;having such markets
near as are afforded by Java, and the other Malay isles, the
Mauritius, India, and China. As salt is found in the colony, and
especially in Rottnest Island, the means for curing are at
hand.</p>
<p>A whale fishery would also yield a rich return for the
employment of capital and skill. There is, it is believed, no
frequented coast where whales are found in greater numbers. When
at Port Leschenault, the writer was told by the officer
commanding there, that he had counted fourteen in the bay at
once. During a voyage of the Sulphur down the coast, three
hundred are said to have been seen. Some of these fish were
declared to be sperm, by men of the ship who had been whalers;
but it is chiefly the black whale that frequents the coast.</p>
<p>Soon after the Sulphur's arrival, at an early period of the
settlement, her crew, with that of the Challenger frigate, were
engaged in fishing; and on one occasion, they caught so vast a
quantity of a species called the King fish, that the net they
were using broke, and the fish were literally driven on shore.
After filling three large boats with them, a considerable heap
was left on the beach. Upwards of three hundred people were amply
supplied on this occasion, including the civil and military
establishments then on Garden Island; and also the crews of the
above ships and the Parmelia transport. Close to Garden Island,
is a bank on which the finest whiting are caught in great
quantities; they are larger than those taken on the English
coast, and equal to them in flavour. Mr. D. H. Macleod, late of
the 63rd Regt., and Government Resident at King George's Sound,
informed the writer, that he was along with the crew of the
colonial schooner "Ellen," when they caught on the Five Fathom
Bank, outside of that island, a place greatly frequented by the
snapper&mdash;in less than two hours, and with half a dozen hooks
and lines&mdash;fish of that description, to an extent exceeding
five cwt. Some of them weighed from 20 to 40lbs. each.</p>
<p>In the Swan River there is a great abundance of fish of the
herring tribe, of a flatter description, and broader than those
in the English seas. Some of these, along with the Snapper, were
cured, and taken to Java by Mr. Sholl, the purser of the Sulphur,
acting as the agent of the local government, and were pronounced
by the Malays, at Sourabaya, to be well adapted for the Java
market.</p>
<p>Erroneous impressions have been prevalent respecting the
harbours of Western Australia; and these impressions, for a time,
raised considerably the rate of insurance at Lloyd's. Accurate
information, however, on this head having now been had, the
injurious effect has ceased. As an instance of this, a vessel,
which has just sailed for Swan River and King George's Sound, has
been insured at as low a rate as vessels which are bound for the
neighbouring colonies.</p>
<p>In the Appendix * will be found a particular description of
the harbours of the colony, which has been kindly furnished by
Captain Preston, R. N. This intelligent officer was lieutenant of
the Success frigate, at the time Sir James Stirling was
dispatched to explore the coast in 1827; and, on his
recommendation to the Admiralty, was appointed first lieutenant
of the Sulphur; in which sloop, and in command of a colonial
vessel, he was, for several years, employed on the station.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix, No. 4; where also will be found
inserted a paper extracted from the "Perth Gazette," on the
subject of the buoys in Cockburn Sound, and which has already
appeared in the "Nautical Magazine." This paper, which has been
furnished by the Surveyor-General, Mr. Roe, is particularly
important, as containing a description of Lambert Channel, a
valuable outlet to sea or to Cockburn Sound, from Owen's
Anchorage or Gage's Roads without passing round Rottnest Island,
which, during strong northerly winch may be considered almost
impracticable. The channel was named after Capt. Lambert, of H.
M. ship Alligator, which was last year sent from India for the
purpose of replacing the buoys and beacons at the entrance of the
harbours.]</p>
<p>From Captain Preston's report it will be seen that Owen's
Anchorage, two miles and a quarter from the jetty at Fremantle,
is a good and safe station for ships in the blowing season; and
that they may remain in Gage's Roads, opposite the town, even
during that season, except in a gale, the approach of which is
always indicated by the barometer; when they may run into Owen's
Anchorage. The directions given by that officer, for vessels
entering the harbours, will be found to correspond with those
laid down by Sir James Stirling, and the Surveyor General, Mr.
Roe.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** See a chart of the Harbours, published in
1833, by J. Arrowsmith, 33 East-street, Red Lion-square; who has
also furnished, from documents supplied by the Colonial Office, a
valuable map of the colony, which every person going out ought to
possess.]<br>

<p>The importance of having a secure harbour at Swan River, where
vessels can refit, as well as lie in security in the winter
season, is considerable in a political, as well as a commercial
point of view. This, at present, may chance to be disregarded or
overlooked; but, if an enemy were ever to get possession of the
place, and fortify it, so as to render, it a secure resort, from
whence his privateers might annoy our trade in the Eastern seas,
the British Government would have cause to regret the not having
secured possession by requisite fortifications. The harbour at
Cockburn Sound, which fully answers to the above description, is
so capacious that vessels could lie in it without being annoyed
by batteries from the shore; and it will be seen, by reference to
Captain Preston's report, that when vessels require to be hove
down, Port Royal, within its limits, is well adapted for that
purpose.</p>
<p>The great advantages for commerce which Western Australia
derives from its position, will be obvious from a glance at a map
of the world; but persons acquainted with the coasts of New
Holland, and the monsoons that blow in the Indian seas, will be
better able to appreciate how much it is favoured as to
situation. As the north-west winds prevail from March till
September, during that season vessels from the eastward rarely
succeed in getting up the west coast of Australia; but, most
frequently, after beating about for several weeks off Cape
Leeuwin, they have been forced to put about, and go round the
east coast, and through the dangerous straits of Torres, to get
to India and the westward.* Swan River, on the contrary, is so
much to windward of that formidable Cape, that the passage to and
from the Mauritius is favourable throughout the year.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the work on South Australia, where the
sailing distances are given from Port Lincoln, the wind is said
to be favourable, at all seasons, from that port to Timor, Java,
Madras, Ceylon, Mauritius, and Cape of Good Hope. As South
Australia, however, lies considerably to the south-east of these
ports, it is clear that this cannot be the case while the
north-west winds prevail. The error is palpable.]</p>
<p>The following is a table of the distances, in the favourable
season, from Swan River to the undermentioned countries. The
passage, however, to Ceylon and Madras has occasionally been
performed in much shorter time.</p>

<p>The season most propitious for making a voyage from the colony
to India, is from the beginning of April to the beginning of
September. By leaving Swan River during that period, a vessel
immediately gets into the south-east trade-wind, which carries
her across the line, when she meets with the south-west monsoon,
that takes her at once to Madras. At this season, fine weather
may be reckoned upon for the whole of the way. The "Merope,"
Capt. Pollock, which conveyed a detachment of the 63rd Regt. from
Swan River to Madras, arrived in the roads at the latter place on
the 16th of May 1834, after a voyage of nineteen days.</p>
<p>In his voyage from England to the colony, and in returning
home, the author was, on each occasion, at sea about three months
and a half. The passage out and home, at the proper seasons, is
both safe and agreeable. With a view to fine weather while
passing the Cape, and on his arrival on the coast, it is
desirable that the emigrant should not arrive at those places
during the winter season, which answers to our summer.</p>
<p>If, after what has now been stated, anything can still be
considered wanting to establish the position that Western
Australia is well calculated for colonization, it is furnished in
the following extract from an authority the most disinterested
and unbiassed that, for this particular purpose, can well be
appealed to: viz., a work drawn up under the sanction of the
committee of the South Australian Association,* who have for
their chairman Mr. W. Wolryche Whitmore, the late member for
Wolverhampton, a gentleman who has displayed extensive knowledge
on the subject of colonization:&mdash;"For fear that these
remarks should be attributed to a disposition, which is common
amongst colonists, to praise their own settlement at the expense
of other settlements, this opportunity is taken to express an
opinion, that Western Australia is, as respects soil and climate,
one of the finest countries in the world, and one of the most fit
for supporting a prosperous colony. That the colony there settled
is not prosperous, is, we believe, owing not at all to any
defects of climate or soil, but entirely to a bad system of
colonization, which may be reformed; or rather to the want of a
good system, which may be supplied."</p>

Province of South Australia," and the passage is quoted from a

<br>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> tribes who frequent the districts
in the vicinity of the Swan, Port Augusta, and King George's
Sound (the territory now occupied by the settlers), do not
exceed, perhaps, a thousand souls. The form of their government
is patriarchal, and they live under independent chiefs; to whom,
however, they are little in subjection, except when they are at
war among themselves, which is not unfrequently the case. Their
mode of life is migratory.</p>
<p>Their food is of various kinds, and as the season arrives for
each, they remove to that part of the country most favourable for
obtaining it. At one season they live principally on the
kangaroo. This animal (of which there are several species) they
kill with spears, and occasionally hunt with dogs. These dogs
vary considerably in size, and, from their bushy tail and short
pricked ears, resemble the fox. The natives also eat the opossum,
an animal they find mostly in the hollows of trees: they show
great agility in pursuit of it. At the fishing season they resort
to the vicinity of rivers and lakes. Their mode of taking the
fish is by spearing, at which they are very dexterous. They have
most success at night, when the fish are attracted by the glare
of torches, and in some places they take a great deal by means of
weirs. In the vicinity of these, fish have been found left in
heaps by the natives, after they had used what they needed.</p>
<p>They also live on the tortoise and land-crab, and cat grubs,
which they find of a large size in the bark of certain trees. The
principal root they use is the eringo, or wild parsnip, which
grows to the depth of three or four feet in loam and other strong
soils. Certain nuts of a bitter quality they convert into food,
by previous rubbing over with clay, and baking in hot ashes. In
the proper season, they get honey from the blossoms of the
banksia tree, which they extract by suction.</p>
<p>As to their mode of cooking fish, the author has partaken of a
specimen of it, that would have been no disgrace to a Parisian
cook. It was a flat fish, which, after being washed and prepared,
was wrapped in soft bark, and placed in hot ashes until dressed.
By this process, an acid from the bark was communicated to the
fish, imparting to it so agreeable a flavour, that it required
the addition of no other sauce.</p>
<p>Their only clothing by day, and covering at night, is made of
kangaroo and opossum skins, with which the women are tolerably
well supplied; but the men, especially in summer, often go naked.
Their huts, which in shape resemble bee-hives, are about four
feet high, and capable of containing but three or four persons.
They are constructed in a few minutes with sticks, and covered
with the bark of the Melaleuka, or tea tree, as it is called in
New Holland. This bark is of a soft cottony substance, and strips
off the tree in large flakes. The entrance is on the side which
is sheltered from the prevalent wind; where, instead of a door,
fire is kindled, towards which the inmates stretch their feet
when they lie down.</p>
<p>These savages, though exhibiting fewer marks of approach to
civilization than any others the writer has seen, are yet far
from being deficient in observation, quickness of apprehension,
and docility. Like most savages, they set little value on human
life, and eagerly avenge insult or injury: yet they are not so
sanguinary as the North American Indians; and, except when
provoked, they have seldom been known to attempt the life of a
settler.</p>
<p>The talent of these natives for mimickry is considerable, and
shows their habits of observation. They repeat with great
accuracy the conversation of the Europeans, and pronounce each
word correctly, excepting those beginning with an S; for
instance, "Swan," they call "On." They have also been seen
imitating the walk and gesture of a number of Europeans, some of
whom they had but occasionally met, with such exactness, that the
standers-by were instantly enabled to name the persons intended.
This facility of imitation renders their pantomimic dances, which
they delight in, lively pictures of some of their pursuits. In
these dances, called by them <i>corrobories</i>, they engage
generally at night, near a blazing fire. Their representation of
killing the kangaroo is peculiarly striking. Two are selected out
of the circle to represent the hunter and the kangaroo. One
assumes the attitude of the animal when grazing, and exhibits the
cautious timidity natural to it, pausing from time to time,
rising upon end, looking about, and anxiously listening as it
were, to ascertain whether an enemy be nigh. The hunter,
approaching against the wind, with extreme caution steals on his
prey; and, after frequent change of his position, retreating, or
throwing himself on the ground, the scene at length closes with
the triumph of the hunter, on his discharging the spear, which is
supposed to pierce the animal.</p>
<p>The natives daily enter the towns and farm-houses with
confidence, unless when an interruption occurs of the good
understanding usually subsisting between them and the colonists.
They are partial to our food, especially bread, for which they
often ask, and are willing to perform short tasks of labour, or
give in exchange spears, fish, or whatever else they may have.
This taste has led them to occasional acts of plunder; and
settlers having fired on them in defence of their property, the
natives have retaliated, and thus blood has unhappily been shed
on both sides.</p>
<p>The conduct of the local government towards the natives has
been characterized by lenity; but, a short time previous to the
author's leaving the colony, it became necessary to have a public
execution under the following circumstances:&mdash;a native had
been shot in the act of breaking into a store by night; and, to
revenge his loss, the remainder of the tribe had put to death two
servants of a settler. The chief and his son, having been
identified as principals in these murders, were outlawed; and,
shortly after, the former was captured, and executed at Perth,
and the latter was shot in the woods. These acts of justice so
completely succeeded in their object of intimidating the natives
on the Swan and Canning rivers, that recent accounts from the
colony represent the shepherds and others in the habit of going
about the country, as having for a considerable time laid aside
their usual precaution of carrying fire-arms; so peaceable had
the conduct of these tribes become.</p>
<p>Another proof of the good effects of the course pursued by the
local government was, that a native who had been outlawed with
the chief and his son, and subsequently pardoned, requested an
interview of the Governor, which he obtained: when, after stating
the injuries his tribe had suffered from the colonists, he begged
that a permanent treaty of amity might be made with them: and, in
reply, was told that it was the earnest wish of the Government to
effect this object&mdash;to protect them from injury, and benefit
them in other ways, if they would only abstain from aggression on
the lives and properties of the colonists. The result of the
conference seemed to give great satisfaction to this native, and
to others along with him; and a very marked change for the better
was observed in his subsequent behaviour.</p>
<p>The natives of the Murray river, forty miles to the southward
of the Swan, are a more warlike and athletic race than those
already mentioned. They have, from the first, evinced a desire to
dislodge the settlers located in their district; and have, from
time to time, killed and wounded several of them, with little or
no apparent provocation, contriving, on repeated occasions, to
evade parties of military sent against them after these
outrages.</p>
<p>Recent accounts from the colony contain the report of an
encounter with this tribe, wherein they lost from twenty-five to
thirty men, of whom fifteen were recognised as having been noted
offenders. The party engaged with them was under the conduct of
the Governor, who was proceeding on an excursion to examine a
fertile district, with the view of forming a settlement there. It
consisted of some gentlemen, and a few soldiers and mounted
police, twenty-four in all. On arriving at the place, they heard
the natives talking loudly in the vicinity; and the party, with
the exception of the police, halted at a ford. The police rode
forward, when the natives, who proved to be seventy in number,
and well armed with spears, seeing only five men, commenced the
attack. This little band, however, repulsed them; but the natives
continued the fight, retreating until they reached the ford,
where they found themselves placed between two fires: they,
notwithstanding, fought on resolutely, till they had sustained
the above severe loss. That on the part of the colonists, was
Captain Ellis (commanding the police), and a constable wounded;
the former mortally. Captain Ellis had served in the 14th
Dragoons in the Peninsular war, and was a gallant and
enterprising officer. The great utility of a few mounted police
in the colony was very apparent in this skirmish.</p>
<p>Though the loss of life in this affair is a very painful
consideration, and deeply to be deplored, yet it seems manifest
that without some severe defeat to convince this tribe of their
inferiority in power to the whites, a petty and harassing warfare
might have been indefinitely prolonged, with ultimately much
heavier loss on both sides. It may now be confidently expected
that this tribe will cease to assume a hostile attitude, and will
follow the example of the tribes on the Swan and Canning rivers,
who are evincing, as before shown, a desire to be on friendly
terms with the settlers.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>The author cannot let this opportunity pass, without calling
the attention of the public to the claims which the natives of
New Holland have upon it. It must be confessed that to those
tribes, hitherto, British example and connexion have, for the
most part, been found the very reverse of beneficial. It is
impossible for a moment to maintain or vindicate the abstract
right of civilized nations to establish themselves in the
territories of savage tribes, without, at least, acknowledging
that such intrusions involve the settlers, and the nation to
which they belong, in deep and lasting responsibilities: in other
words, that the latter are bound, by the strongest ties of moral
obligation, to assist the natives in accommodating themselves to
the great changes they have to undergo; for it is incumbent upon
us ever to bear in mind that, by our entry into, and
establishment in the country, the natives are gradually deprived
of their hunting and fishing grounds, and are consequently
forced, unprepared, into new modes of life, and new conditions of
society. The equitable and liberal fulfilment of the obligations
thus incurred, is indispensable to any case of justification,
which even the least scrupulous advocate of such intrusions might
attempt.</p>
<p>Among the primary measures which he is anxious to see adopted,
now that we are possessed of a sufficient knowledge of the
natives of Western Australia and of their language, the writer
would suggest that a formal treaty with them be speedily entered
into. As a measure of healing and pacification, he is persuaded
it would do much to prevent irritation and heart-burnings, and to
promote a permanent good understanding with them. The advantages
of such an arrangement could not fail to be shared by both
parties. It is a favourable circumstance in this view, that the
colony has, in the person of Mr. Moore, the Advocate-General, a
public officer peculiarly gifted for conducting such a
negotiation. The extraordinary aptitude he possesses for holding
intercourse with the natives, has been strikingly exhibited in
the accounts published in the Western Australian journals of July
12 and 19, 1834. The particulars of his conference with an
outlawed chief of one of the tribes are so interesting, that want
of room alone prevents their insertion in the Appendix.</p>
<p>Western Australia, apart from the continent to which it
belongs, has an unquestionable demand upon us for such a solemn
compact and treaty as that already alluded to. It has every right
to expect that a benevolent line of policy will be pursued; but,
on a professedly Christian country, it has a peculiar and
irresistible claim that the blessings of Christianity should be
extended to it. Let it not be said that a nation which includes
among its far-famed institutions, Missionary establishments,
designed to promote the conversion of the heathen in general,
passes by or neglects a country on whose shores it has planted a
colony for its own convenience and advantage. To the religious
part of such a nation, at all events, the appeal seems one that
has only to be made, to be immediately successful.</p>
<p>But if these remarks necessarily apply to Western Australia,
considered apart from the continent to which it belongs,&mdash;if
they cannot be gainsaid or resisted when the case is thus
limited&mdash;with what accumulated force do they apply when we
look at the connexion which all the while subsists between this
settlement and that great continent, a country equal in extent to
Europe; the eastern shores of which have not only sustained all
the common and inseparable injuries attendant upon colonization
conducted under ordinary circumstances, but have had superinduced
all the evils of a penal settlement! Not only has Australia, in
that quarter, experienced none of those compensating results
which every right-minded and considerate person must in all
instances desire; but, on the contrary, evils which are of rare
occurrence in colonization&mdash;evils the most afflicting and
appalling, have been&mdash;thoughtlessly, it is hoped, but on an
extensive scale, inflicted.</p>
<p>It is now about half a century since a penal settlement was
formed on that coast. To those shores a moral pestilence has
since been wafted. The scum and refuse of the civilized nation
(men whose education in their own country has only served to
render them adepts in villainy) have been let loose upon the
natives&mdash;for it seems an almost inevitable result of a penal
settlement, that some of the most desperate and depraved of the
convicts will, from time to time, escape, and lead on the native
tribes to the commission of every enormity that malignant
ingenuity can devise. Such has been the case in New South Wales,
and in Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>For proof that this statement is not overcharged, it is only
necessary to refer the reader to the testimony of the Rev.
Messrs. Watson and Handt, who were sent out in 1832 by the Church
Missionary Society. These gentlemen commenced their labours at
Wellington Valley, in the interior of the country; and, in the
"Church Missionary Record" of November 1834, is given the first
account of their mission. The following remarks, with which that
account is there introduced, but too fully corroborate what has
been already stated of the injuries inflicted on the savages, by
a penal settlement having been fixed among them:&mdash;</p>
<h4>"NEW HOLLAND.</h4>
<blockquote>"In the following extracts from the communications of
the Rev. Messrs. W. Watson and J. C. S. Handt, such particulars
only are presented to our readers as are fit to meet the public
eye; for we are grieved to say, that such are the miseries,
diseases, and degradation, brought on the Aborigines of this vast
country by their intercourse with Europeans, that decency would
be shocked at the recital of their state. Suffice it to say,
that, surrounded by wretchedness of the lowest description, the
missionaries and their wives are giving themselves to their work
of mercy with zeal and self-denial. Without this, it were
impossible ever to hope to see righteousness prevail over a scene
of such complete moral desolation!!!"</blockquote>
<br>
Many individuals as well as societies, it is probable, justify
their having turned a deaf ear to the urgent appeals for relief
which have doubtless, from time to time, been made to them on
behalf of such a complicated state of wretchedness, by the
apparent hopelessness of the undertaking; while they have been
induced to direct missionary efforts to other parts, such as New
Zealand, and the various isles of the Pacific Ocean, where
missionaries have long been labouring; though such quarters have
not the claims which the natives of Australia have upon us, on
the ground of the deep injuries inflicted on their eastern coast,
as well as of their being our fellow-subjects. The writer himself
is not aware that, in a missionary point of view, any thing
whatever has been done for that country, except by the Church
Missionary Society, in the instance of the two missionaries
already referred to, towards whose support his Majesty's
Government contribute 500<i>l</i>. a-year. But, if difficulties
deemed almost insurmountable have hitherto stood in the way of
all attempts to benefit Australia from that side on which alone
we had till lately gained a footing, it must be encouraging to
the Christian philanthropist to learn, that, on its western
coast, an opening is now presented for missionaries to the native
tribes, unaccompanied by any of those peculiar obstacles and
discouragements, which are so deeply to be lamented on the
opposite side. The writer has great pleasure in announcing to the
public, that some friends of the cause in Dublin have just
established a society, called the "Swan River Mission." To this
institution he solicits attention; and, for further particulars
respecting it, refers his readers to the Appendix.*

<br>
<p class="negindent2">Misstatements in recent
Publications&mdash;Mr. Peers Grant&mdash;Causes of early
Failures&mdash;Origin of many injurious Reports&mdash;Instance of
a Settler seriously misled by them&mdash;Want of Money&mdash;High
Prices of Provisions&mdash;Want of Storehouses&mdash;Free Grants,
Tendency of&mdash;Remedies in Progress.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> reader's attention will now be
drawn to some of the misstatements with respect to the colony,
which have appeared in recent publications. Under this head he
would especially notice a work entitled "England and America;" as
the question of colonization is ably discussed in it, and the
system which it recommends is intended to be followed up in the
projected colony of South Australia. The author would here
remark, that from what came under his own observation, when he
was in South Africa in 1817, of the condition of the Boors on the
Caffrarian frontier, as well as from his recent experience in New
Holland, he fully acquiesces in the theory that work
develops&mdash;that, in order to the rapid progress and
prosperity of a free colony, a due proportion ought to be
maintained between land, capital, and labour. Agreeing, however,
as he does on this point, it is at the same time incumbent on
him, as an eye-witness to the progress of the colony of Western
Australia from its origin, to show that the statements therein
made relative to its early condition are incorrect.</p>
<p>At page 33, vol. 2, of the work in question, there is said to
be, in Western Australia, "abundance of good land, and of land,
too, cleared and drained by nature." After adverting to the
amount of capital and live stock, and the number of labourers
introduced by the first settlers, it is asked, what has become of
all that capital, and all those labourers? Then comes the
following passage:&mdash;"Why this failure, with all the elements
of success&mdash;plenty of good land, plenty of capital, and
enough labour?&mdash;The explanation is easy;&mdash;in this
colony there never has been a class of labourers. Those who went
out as labourers no sooner reached the colony than they were
tempted, by the superabundance of good land, to become
landowners."</p>
<p>This writer proceeds to state, that Mr. Peel (who, as he had
been informed, had brought out a capital of 50,000<i>l</i>. and
300 persons of the labouring class) had been thus left without a
servant to make his bed, or to fetch him water from the river;
and that, in the absence of his people, his capital had perished.
"The same thing," he adds, "happened in many cases." Further on,
it is stated that some of the labourers, who had become
independent landowners, died of hunger, at a period when a large
supply of food had reached the colony; and that they were
starved, because where they had settled was not known to the
Governor, nor even to themselves&mdash;"such," says this writer,
"was the dispersion of these colonists, in consequence of the
superabundance of good land." It is added, that the settlers who
remained had petitioned for convicts&mdash;though one of the
chief inducements to settling in the colony was an undertaking,
on the part of the English Government, that none should be sent
thither.</p>
<p>If this writer's statement be correct&mdash;that labourers on
their arrival, tempted by the superabundance of good land, did
with impunity desert their masters, leaving their property to
perish, and did themselves become landowners, it will be
apparent, either that there were then no laws in the colony, or
that they were not in force. The reverse, however, is the
fact,&mdash;there were laws, and they were enforced.</p>
<p>The following is No. 8 of the land regulations:&mdash;"No
grant of land will be made to servants under indenture; nor shall
persons receive grants who shall appear to have come to the
settlement at the expense of other individuals, without
sufficient assurance of their having fulfilled the condition of
any agreement under which they may have come." The author does
not remember an instance of this regulation being relaxed; and it
is manifest that destruction of property and the ruin of the
capitalist must have been inevitable, had the Government not
enforced it.</p>
<p>Equally without foundation is the statement&mdash;that the
indentured servant could desert his master with impunity. The
indenture was binding equally on master and servant, and was
strictly enforced by the colonial law. If the master failed to
give the wages, food, or whatever else might have been stipulated
for in the indenture, the servant, on establishing his complaint
before a magistrate, obtained his discharge. On the other hand,
if the master proved a breach of the indenture by the servant
unduly absenting himself, refusing to work, &amp;c., the
magistrate was under obligation to imprison the servant. Also any
person employing an indentured servant, without permission of the
master, was subject to a very heavy fine.</p>
<p>Mr. Peel and his people were in this manner circumstanced. The
author has read many of their indentures: in all of these Mr.
Peel was bound to pan them daily wages (generally three
shillings), out of which their food and clothing were to be
deducted. The capital imported by Mr. Peel, though very
considerable, was understood to consist chiefly of stores and
live-stock. However this may have been, he found it convenient,
after a time, to grant most of his people permission to work for
other settlers, reserving a right to recal them when he chose;
but allowing them the alternative of their discharge, on their
reimbursing him the expense of their passage out. As his people
could get higher wages when working for others, they gladly
accepted the permission. Occasional misunderstandings took place
between him and some of them, and it was not till after the
Governor, accompanied by the Law-Adviser of Government, had more
than once repaired in person to Mr. Peel's location, that an
adjustment of those differences was effected. The author has
known several servants of Mr. Peel to be imprisoned for breaches
of indenture. A number of them, however, were excellent men, who
would have conscientiously adhered to him, had he not given them
the option of working for others.</p>
<p>It is but justice here to acknowledge the great benefit
conferred on the settlement by Mr. Peel, in the introduction of
men who were not only of good conduct, but well acquainted with
farming pursuits or with trades. For himself, the author feels
happy in having this opportunity to express his sense of it,
having had upwards of four years in his service a family brought
out by Mr. Peel. The father of this family is a man of
intelligence and observation. Besides his own trade of brick and
tile-making, he has a competent knowledge of farming, gardening,
bricklaying, lime-burning, and brewing, in which various
occupations he employs himself. Such is his industry, that he has
been seen working for hours in the garden by moonlight, after
spending a long day at labour in the field. His wife is a regular
dairywoman. One of the sons is a carpenter, and another a
ploughman, besides having each a knowledge of their father's
trade; and the rest of the family, down to the youngest, are
training up in habits of industry and labour.</p>
<p>Desirous of avoiding further allusion than is justifiable to
the affairs of an individual, the writer hopes enough has been
said to demonstrate that, whatever injury Mr. Peel may have
sustained by destruction of stores, and loss of live-stock (and
there is no doubt it was very considerable), the cause is not
attributable to his not having had the aid of such of his people
as he chose to retain in his service.</p>
<p>Although, as has been shown, the conditions of the indentures
were by the colonial laws enforced, it will nevertheless be
manifest, that no law, in any country, can prevent an artful and
unprincipled servant (anxious to be rid of his engagement) from
acting in so vexatious a manner, that some masters, in preference
to keeping such a one, would forego any benefit the indenture
might confer. Such a course has been adopted in the colony by
some masters thus circumstanced. Those, however, who had been
careful to bring out men of good character, and to whom they
allowed an equitable compensation for their services, have rarely
had cause for complaint; and, on the contrary, have generally
been rewarded by the cheerful obedience of their servants.</p>
<p>The author is the more desirous of disproving the alleged
lawless state of society in the colony, as the implied reproach
is totally unmerited by the Governor, Sir James Stirling, who has
been most indefatigable and self-denying in his exertions for the
public welfare; and it is equally so by the magistracy, who,
under the conduct of their chairman Mr. Mackie, formerly Counsel
to the Local Government, and now the colonial judge (a gentleman
whose integrity, assiduity, and professional talent, are highly
appreciated by the colonists), have, from the outset,
administered the laws with vigour and impartiality.</p>
<p>With reference to the assertion that some individuals had
perished with hunger from not having been able to inform the
Governor as to where they had settled, the author cart only say,
that he did not hear of any such circumstance while in the
colony, and that he considers it very improbable; as, with the
exception of the people connected with Mr. Peel, the settlers, at
the period alluded to, were located on the Swan and the Canning,
by following down which rivers they could have reached, in the
course of a single day, the towns of Perth or Fremantle.</p>
<p>He has also to confess his ignorance of the colonists having,
as stated, petitioned for convicts&mdash;he knows that such a
wish was not expressed in their memorial drawn up in 1832, and
laid before his Majesty's Government by Sir James Stirling in
person. The colonists having had before their eyes, in the
neighbouring penal settlements, the serious evils inflicted on
society by the employment of convicts (especially as in-door
servants), have firmly resisted the temptation to seek such a
remedy for their wants. The extreme difficulty, which it is
notorious respectable families there experience, to sufficiently
guard the morals of their offspring, and to secure their being
brought up in the necessary principles of virtue and integrity,
is alone a consideration which, it is believed, will keep the
colonists in Western Australia stedfast on this point. No mere
worldly prosperity whatsoever, can compensate for the tremendous
risk to which children in a penal settlement are exposed, as many
a heart-broken parent can testify.</p>
<p>It is stated, at page 145, vol. 2, of the work already quoted,
that 500,000 acres in the colony had been granted to Mr.
Peel&mdash;that he had been permitted to mark out his grant on
the map, in England&mdash;and that, having selected it about the
port or landing-place, he subsequently took possession of it, to
the great injury of other settlers.</p>
<p>The writer is here in error with respect both to the extent
and the situation of this grant; for, without reference to Mr.
Peel's claim to a larger quantity, the tract assigned him
consists of but half the number of acres stated, and the distance
between its nearest point and the port, is about seven miles.
From thence, the grant extends along the shore to the southward,
as far as the right bank of the Murray river, and, inland, about
thirteen miles.</p>
<p>It is true that in the agreement entered into with Mr. Peel,
he was authorized, when in England, to mark out a portion of his
grant on the map; and the situation he selected reached from the
Swan to the Canning river, and extended towards the port: but his
obtaining possession of this grant, was made contingent on his
arriving in the colony with a stipulated amount of property and
number of souls by an appointed day. He failed to arrive within
the limits of the time fixed; and the land reserved for him was,
in conformity with instructions from his Majesty's Government,
granted to other settlers.</p>
<p>In the passage already quoted, an accusation is repeated which
was circulated at the period in question&mdash;that the large
grant of land made to Mr. Peel was an especial favour conferred
on him in consideration of his relationship to one of his
Majesty's Ministers then in office. This seems a suitable
occasion for examining as to the correctness of that charge. On
reference to the correspondence on the subject, published by
order of the House of Commons, it appears that, on its being
known that His Majesty's Government intended to form a colony in
Western Australia, four gentlemen, one of whom was Mr. Peel,
submitted to the Secretary of State, Sir George Murray, a
proposal to send out a large body of emigrants to the settlement,
on condition of obtaining a proportionate grant of land there.
This proposal was agreed to, except as to some minor
details&mdash;which modification, however, caused three of the
association to withdraw from it; and, on this, an offer was made
by Mr. Peel to complete the project by himself, to which the
Government acceded.</p>
<p>The terms agreed on were these,&mdash;that half a million of
acres should be allotted to Mr. Peel, after the arrival of a
vessel sent out by him, with four hundred settlers; and if, at
the expiration of the year 1840, it should be found that the
requisite investment in the colony of one shilling and sixpence
the acre had been made, another half million of acres would then
be assigned him by degrees, as fresh importations of settlers and
capital were made; in accordance with the original terms
published at the colonial office. Mr. Peel was also informed that
the tract of two hundred and fifty thousand acres (to which
extent the association had been allowed a priority of choice)
would be reserved for him until the 1st of November 1829; and
further, that, should he fail in his contract, and arrive
subsequently to the above period, or with fewer emigrants than
stipulated, he would still have granted to him as many acres as
his actual number of settlers and amount of investment would
cover, at the rate of forty acres for every three pounds
sterling.</p>
<p>The tract marked out by Mr. Peel and his partners on the map
having been given to others, the Governor offered him two hundred
and fifty thousand acres in another part of the colony, which he
took, as above mentioned; and, up to the period of the author's
departure from that country, he was not aware of Mr. Peel's
having taken any steps towards establishing a claim to an
additional quantity of land.</p>
<p>If then it be borne in mind that, towards the fulfilment of
this agreement on his part, Mr. Peel introduced into the colony a
population, to the amount (if the work just quoted be correct) of
300 souls, and a property of 50,000<i>l</i>.; and if the evident
risk is also considered, it will, it is apprehended, be generally
admitted, that few who would regard, the enterprise solely as a
commercial speculation, would have accepted the grant on the
terms represented as so favourable to Mr. Peel.</p>
<p>After observing upon this grant, this writer proceeds to state
the conditions on which other settlers obtained land in the
following passage:&mdash;"It was declared that all the world
should be entitled to unlimited grants on either one of two
conditions, as the grantee should prefer; either an outlay of one
shilling and sixpence per acre in conveying labourers to the
settlement, or the investment of capital on the land at the rate
of one shilling and sixpence per acre." These conditions, he goes
on to contend, are at variance with each other; but on this point
his information has been erroneous. No land could be obtained on
the second condition; and, on the first, land was assigned in
occupancy only (it still continuing crown land), until the
improvement required by the second condition was effected, when
the occupant became entitled to the fee-simple; but, if he failed
to effect the improvement within a stipulated period, his grant
reverted to the Crown.</p>
<p>The above remarks will equally apply to the work on South
Australia, already noticed (which quotes from "England and
America" most of the statements here animadverted upon), and also
to a paper in the "Literary Gazette" for November 1831,
containing similar errors, and which article is quoted by the
first-mentioned work.</p>
<p>Some allusion may here be expected to the statements that have
been made on the subject of labour. The writer of "England and
America," in a passage already quoted, asserts, that in this
colony&mdash;"there never has been a class of labourers." The
Literary Gazette of November 1831 states, that "to the want of
labour, and to that alone, may be traced all the evils that have
afflicted this infant settlement." A third writer (that on "South
Australia") adds:&mdash;"they may be traced, not to a want of
labour absolutely, for plenty of workmen were taken to the colony
by the first emigrant capitalists; but to the want of
arrangements for having constancy and combination of labour."</p>
<p>These writers explain their meaning by asserting, that when
the indentured servants, on their arrival in the colony found
good land so easily to be acquired, they left their masters with
impunity, and became landowners.</p>
<p>These representations have already been shown to be in
material points erroneous, by quoting the Government regulation,
which prevented labourers from acquiring land, without consent of
their masters; and by demonstrating that, to the latter, the
services of their people were secured, by an efficient
administration of the laws. It is true, many of the labouring
class went to Van Diemen's Land, but this was with consent of
their masters. Some capitalists (looking chiefly to the land they
would acquire from the number of people they brought out) had
large families in their service; but, finding the outlay required
for their maintenance to exceed so much their expectations, they
granted discharges to as many as they could dispense with.</p>
<p>The rate of labour in the colony has always been
high&mdash;from thirty to forty shillings a month, with rations
costing about as much more. The usual daily wages of a labourer
have been five shillings, and, of an artificer, from eight to
ten.</p>
<p>As to the scarcity of labour there, the author does not
recollect any period at which agricultural or other labourers
could not be had, unless occasionally in the harvest time; and
then those farmers who offered higher wages than ordinary seldom
failed in getting them. The contrary indeed was not
unfrequent&mdash;that labourers had a difficulty in getting
employment.</p>
<p>The apparent contradiction between the high price of labour
and the occasional want of employment, will be cleared up when
the high price of provisions is considered, and also the want of
capital to give employment to that labour&mdash;evils which have
resulted from causes already adverted to.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>It now remains for the author to offer a few observations,</p>
<p class="indent">(1.) On the failures that occurred among the
early settlers.</p>
<p class="indent">(2.) On the origin of the reports so widely
circulated to the prejudice of the country.</p>
<p class="indent">(3.) On the tardy progress of the colony,
compared with what had been expected.</p>
<p>The following extract from one of the earliest dispatches of
the Governor (written in January 1830, and addressed to the
Secretary of State) will serve to preface these remarks, as it
bears immediately on the first point. Adverting to the
circumstances under which the first settlers came out, he thus
proceeds:&mdash;"There could not be a great number with minds and
bodies suited to encounter the struggle and distresses of a new
settlement. Many, if not all, have accordingly been more or less
disappointed on arrival, with either the state of things here, or
their own want of power to surmount the difficulties pressing
around them. This has been experienced, in the beginning, by
every new colony; and might have been expected to occur here, as
well as elsewhere. The greater part, incapable of succeeding in
England, are not likely to prosper here to the extent of their
groundless and inconsiderate expectations. Many of the settlers
who have come, should never have left in England a safe and
tranquil state of life; and, if it be possible to discourage one
set of people, and to encourage another, I would earnestly
request that, for a few years, the helpless and inefficient may
be kept from the settlement; whilst, as to the active,
industrious, and intelligent, they may be assured with confidence
of a fair reward for their labours."</p>
<p>If, after what has been said, it be granted that Western
Australia, as far as natural advantages go, is well suited for
the purposes of colonization, still it will be apparent, from the
principle on which the colony was founded, that its success must
be greatly dependent on the capital and exertions of the
settlers. The charge of maintaining a military and a civil
establishment being all his Majesty's Government was pledged to,
every other expense was to be borne by the emigrant; such as his
outfit, voyage, and settlement in the colony.</p>
<p>No arrangement prior to leaving England having been made by
the emigrants to ensure the advantages of co-operation on the
part of their friends at home, and among themselves in the
colony, each depended on his own energy and resources for his
success; and the foregoing description of many of the original
settlers will account for the disappointments that ensued in
various instances.</p>
<p>Few who abandoned the settlement under such circumstances,
were willing to admit their failure was the result of their own
want of exertion, or their unfitness for the enterprise in which
they had embarked: accordingly, wherever they went, and in their
letters home, the blame was laid on the country. Thus many of the
evil reports respecting it, which were current at home and in the
neighbouring colonies, may be traced to this source. Of this, the
following is a striking instance.</p>
<p>Among those who first settled at Perth, was a tradesman, who
had been in such circumstances in England as enabled him to bring
out a wooden house, and whatever else was requisite for the
convenience of his family. This man, whose trade was a good one,
seemed a respectable and well-informed person; but, getting
little business, and not embarking in agricultural pursuits, he
soon became addicted to intemperance; and, shortly after, sold
off the remainder of his property, and removed to the Cape of
Good Hope. There&mdash;not contented with disseminating the worst
reports of Western Australia, little of which, if any, he could
have seen, except the sandy district of the coast&mdash;he
industriously sought out those emigrants who touched at the Cape;
and, after telling them he had but lately left Swan River,
proceeded to give such a description of the country as was
calculated to deter them from prosecuting their voyage
thither.</p>
<p>A settler, who had suffered severely from confiding in the
reports of this person and others, related to the author the
following particulars:&mdash;He had left England for Western
Australia in a ship chartered by himself, and freighted with his
own establishment, stores of all kinds, and livestock&mdash;the
latter, of choice breeds; and his people, amounting in number to
seventy persons, or upwards. The reports he heard on his arrival
at the Cape, deterred him from continuing his enterprise; and, in
consequence, he discharged his ship, with a number of his
people&mdash;sold most of his livestock at less than the English
price; and then proceeded with his family, and remaining
establishment, in another vessel bound to Van Diemen's Land, with
a view of settling there. Touching at the Swan, on his voyage, he
had an opportunity of examining the country for himself; and, so
pleased was he with it, that he resumed his purpose of settling
there, although the step he had taken at the Cape had occasioned
him a loss of, at least, several thousand pounds&mdash;and he has
now, for some years, been located on the Swan.</p>
<p>A prevalent cause of distress among the early settlers arose
from their having generally brought out with them little ready
money, compared with their other property. This, was chiefly
owing to the Government regulations admitting of land being
assigned to those only, who introduced labourers and various
kinds of property required by farmers. Many of the settlers,
therefore, to the extent of their means, were in this way amply
provided; but, having understood in England, that money would be
of little use in a new country, numbers, without questioning what
they wished to be true, incautiously expended most of their means
in the property that would entitle them to obtain land in the
colony. However, when they had been some time in the settlement,
they discovered that there&mdash;as in other places&mdash;money
was needful; and, on wishing to procure some by the sale of part
of their property, they found it difficult to do so without loss,
in consequence of most other settlers having brought out similar
investments.</p>
<p>Another cause of depression, which has borne seriously on the
settlers, has been the occasional high price of the necessaries
of life. With a view of remedying this evil, cargoes of
provisions have been repeatedly imported by the Local
Government&mdash;the actual cost alone being charged to the
settler. Even a ship-load of bullocks and pigs was introduced
from Java. It was found impracticable, however, to follow up this
plan, from the loss it entailed, owing to the want of suitable
storehouses, at that early period, for securing the grain and
other provisions so imported from the weather, the ravages of
vermin, and, especially, the white ant. Besides, numbers of the
bullocks and pigs getting loose, soon became as wild and
difficult to recapture, as if they had been natives of the woods,
whither they had betaken themselves.</p>
<p>As another mode of keeping down the markets, an arrangement
was entered into by the Government with some merchants, who
engaged to prevent, by their importations, the prices from rising
above a fixed standard: but the smallness and variableness of the
demand operated to frustrate this measure likewise.</p>
<p>Experience has shown that the system of free grants, which was
the first adopted in Western Australia, is decidedly injurious to
the prosperity of a settlement, from the facility it affords to
persons possessed of comparatively little capital, to acquire
extensive tracts of land, the greater part of which, for want of
means, they cannot use for agricultural or pastoral purposes. It
also occasions the too wide dispersion of the settlers; thus
necessarily increasing the expense of government, and, at the
same time, producing serious inconvenience to the farmer.</p>
<p>To counteract these evils, several causes have been in
operation. On the distribution of land to the first settlers on
the Swan and the Canning, a remedy was provided by a judicious
arrangement on the part of the Governor, restricting the river
frontage of the grants to a seventh or an eighth of what it would
have been, had they been given in squares; and as, for the
convenience of water carriage, and from the superiority of the
land, all erected their dwellings on the banks of the rivers, the
settlers were thus brought as near each other, as if the grants
had been reduced to the square of this narrow frontage on the
rivers. Chiefly owing to this arrangement it happens, that on the
Upper Swan, near where the river debouches from the gorge of the
hills, there are thirteen grants, each from 2000 to 7000 acres in
extent; the farthest removed of which is within a mile and a half
of a central point&mdash;and on nine of them are the habitations
of their respective proprietors. By another Government
regulation, persons entitled to large grants are restricted to a
limited quantity of land on the rivers in question, and are
required to select elsewhere the remainder due to them. A further
remedy has resulted from merchants and others living in the towns
of Perth and Fremantle (and to whom grants in occupancy had been
made) transferring half of their land to other persons, on
condition of their making the improvements requisite to entitle
the former to the fee simple of the whole. In this way, and by
sale, all grants on the Swan, exceeding 5000 acres, have been
reduced. But it is important here to add, that his Majesty's
regulations, which took effect in 1832, abolished the system of
free grants in the colony, and directed the sale of all crown
land at the minimum price of five shillings the acre. Since that
period, the evil has been rapidly diminishing; and will, after a
time, be completely removed.</p>
<p>Many of the original settlers in possession of large tracts,
have exhausted their funds in establishing themselves, and would
gladly sell a portion of their land, which those newly arrived
will purchase in preference to crown land, as better situated,
and doubtless much cheaper.</p>
<p>Should it be apprehended that the extent of Mr. Peel's grant
(so much exceeding what he could farm himself) would in any
degree counteract the benefit expected from the present system,
the circumstance of his grant being situated on the sea coast is
to be considered; for, though it includes excellent land,
particularly on the Murray, yet, as the interior confessedly
contains the best land in the colony, future emigrants will most
probably select their locations in that quarter.</p>

and Water communication&mdash;Canal&mdash;Principal Farms on the
Swart River&mdash;The Canning&mdash;York District&mdash;Murray
River&mdash;Port Leschenault&mdash;Vasse's Inlet&mdash;Port
Augusta&mdash;The Blackwood River&mdash;King George's Sound.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="aa">It</span> may now be desirable to take a view
of the present condition of the settlement, and to enlarge a
little on its prospects. The colony may be considered as having
already surmounted the most trying stage of its existence.-An
emigrant now arriving at Swan River will find that society there
has passed through its primary state, and will be likely to
witness with surprise the progress it has actually made.</p>
<p>On approaching Fremantle from the sea, the site of the town is
indicated by a handsome octagonal building of white cut stone,
erected near the edge of a precipice which overhangs the mouth of
the river. On landing, the stranger has the pleasure of entering
a small but neat town, with wide streets, some of which have been
macadamized. The streets are laid out at right angles with each
other, and the houses are constructed either of white stone, or
of wood that is painted over. As there is abundance of fine
limestone on the spot, it is probable that this will be the
material chiefly resorted to for building there in future.
Fremantle contains several hotels, where travellers may partake
of excellent accommodation and a good table. The principal one is
equal in appearance and comfort to a good English country inn.
Invalids from India, accustomed to every luxury, have been
thoroughly satisfied with their entertainment there, and have
written to their friends in India to that effect. The shops and
stores are provided with almost every thing the settlers are
likely to require.</p>
<p>If the traveller wishes to proceed to Perth, the seat of
Government, he may easily procure good horses or boats on hire.
There are also regular passage-boats, by which the distance is
accomplished within a couple of hours. The water communication
between Fremantle and Perth is by means of an estuary, extending
ten miles into the interior, and to which the general name of the
Swan is given; but the river of that name enters it near Perth.
The estuary has for several miles a winding course through
pleasing and romantic scenery, and is from two furlongs to more
than a mile across. The banks are studded with rocks of grotesque
and singular shapes; some, half concealed by shrubs and trees,
while others are naked and precipitous. The passage is rendered
circuitous by long spits of sand, to avoid which the boats have
often to go a considerable way round to keep in deep water. After
clearing these, the traveller enters Melville Water, which is
some six miles in length, and four in width, having in the
distance a fine view of the Darling Range. Proceeding on his
course, he leaves the mouth of the Canning about four miles on
his right; and, passing through a narrow strait at the foot of
Mount Eliza, a richly wooded hill on his left, discovers the town
of Perth, beautifully situated on one of its declivities, and
extending along the shore of a somewhat circular bay.</p>
<p>In going by land from Fremantle to Perth, the traveller
follows the road to Preston Point, which is a mile and a half
higher up on the estuary; where he finds a horse-ferry to take
him across to the opposite bank, from whence there is a road
leading directly to Perth. This road is through a sandy tract,
generally loose, and mostly an open forest. Midway there is a
good hotel, built of stone, and two stories high.</p>
<p>The town of Perth is much more scattered than that of
Fremantle, and is partially concealed by some fine trees which
have been left standing. The main street extends about a mile
along a ridge which runs parallel with the water's edge. Most of
the houses are of wood, but some good ones of brick have been
erected; and as bricks are made on the spot, and stone can be
brought by barges from Mount Eliza, it is not likely that any
more wooden houses will be built. It may be here well to caution
emigrants against bringing out wooden houses from England. They
are very uncomfortable dwellings in such a climate, for not only
are they liable to warp and shrink, and thus to admit too freely
the external air; but, if constructed with ever such
well-seasoned materials, they are rarely a sufficient protection
from heat and cold. In a wooden house with a thatched roof,
situated at Fremantle, Fahrenheit's thermometer stood 16° higher
in the hot season than it did in a stone house close by. The
appearance of the town of Perth is considerably enhanced by the
officers' barracks, and those of the private soldiers; the other
public buildings are, the jail, and an extensive commissariat
store. In this town are several comfortable inns. One of them is
kept by George Hodges, a discharged soldier of the 63rd regiment.
This settler owes his prosperity in the colony chiefly to the
prudence and good management of his wife. Having a knowledge of
baking, she commenced in a very small way at Perth; and, being
noted for her steady conduct and integrity, merchants and masters
of vessels entrusted her with considerable quantities of flour,
for which she paid with punctuality. From her success in this,
and other undertakings, her husband has now the principal bakery
and inn, besides a general shop. Equally successful is Edward
Barron, the proprietor of another inn there, who had also been in
the 63rd regiment, Sergeant-Major of the detachment. His wife,
whose dairy is one of the most extensive in the colony,
principally supplies the town with milk and butter.</p>
<p>Perth contains several good shops, and merchants' stores.
Horses and boats can be obtained here, as at Fremantle, on hire.
The church is the only one in the colony. It is a temporary
building, erected a few months after the establishment of the
town in 1829, under the direction of Archdeacon Scott, who, on
his way to England from New South Wales, happened to arrive in
the colony at that period in H. M. ship Success; and to whose
gratuitous and zealous services, as an officiating clergyman, for
several months prior to the arrival of Mr. Wittenoom, the
colonial chaplain, the colonists were deeply indebted. Mr.
Wittenoom is, up to this time, the only minister of the gospel,
of any denomination, in the settlement.</p>
<p>Leaving Perth, the Swan winds considerably towards Guildford,
a village on its left bank. The distance between these places by
water, following the channel of the river, is about twelve miles;
but, during summer, considerable difficulty is at present
experienced in crossing the "Flats," which are shoals a little
above Perth, and extend about a mile. To remedy this, the
Government has cut a canal, about a quarter of a mile long; and
so serpentine is the river in that part, that the undertaking,
when completed, will shorten the distance about three miles. The
engineer's plan involves the damming up of the river, in order to
turn its waters into the canal, which at present is but partially
filled.</p>
<p>The distance, by land from Perth to Guildford is but seven
miles. The road is on the right bank of the river, and having
bridges over the brooks and ravines, there is communication for
carriages, but from the sandy nature of the ground the travelling
is heavy. As there is a stiff soil on the opposite side, it is
intended to take advantage of the proposed dam, and carrying the
road across there, to continue it from thence along the left
bank.</p>
<p>Between Perth and Guildford, on both banks of the river, there
are several good farms. The land is confessedly inferior to that
above Guildford, but here is seen what steadiness, perseverance,
and skill, can accomplish even under disadvantages. Among those
who have farms in this quarter, are, the Messrs. Hardy, farmers
from Lincolnshire, and the Messrs. Clarkson, from Yorkshire.
These settlers have arable, as well as grazing farms, and so
early as 1833, had reared a race of tall handsome horses from a
large breed they brought out with them, and crossed with Cape
mares.</p>
<p>In visiting the location of Mr. Joseph Hardy, the writer was
struck with the comfort and neatness exhibited in his dwelling
and out-buildings, as well as with the excellent arrangement of
his farm altogether; but, more particularly, when Mr. Hardy
informed him that it was all the work of his own hands, with the
occasional aid of a farm servant. His house seemed to have no
sawn timber in it, except the doors and windows. The walls were
constructed of stakes driven into the ground, and interlaced with
wattles, the space within being filled with mud-mortar, and the
whole plastered so as to present a smooth surface. The roof was
constructed without nails, except those which fastened the
rafters; the lathing was secured by rope-yarn. The covering was
thatch, made of a fine sort of rush, that lies more compact than
straw, and when clipped, has a very neat appearance. Many of the
farm houses are of this description, and are erected at a
trifling expense; they are every way preferable, both in summer
and winter, to wooden houses.</p>
<p>The following is an extract from a letter, dated Peninsula
Farm, 14th July 1832, and addressed to the author, by this
praiseworthy settler. The document has already appeared in one of
Mr. Cross's publications, and is quoted here for the excellent
spirit and qualities it exhibits; and also, as showing the
success which may generally be expected to result from that union
of judgment, perseverance, and fortitude, the importance of which
has been, in the early pages of this pamphlet, pointed out to the
emigrant.</p>
<blockquote>"February 3, 1830, arrived at Swan River, in the brig
Tranby, from Hull, and found many of the emigrants in their tents
at Fremantle, generally dissatisfied, and full of complaints
respecting the colony, and some of them ready for going away. The
flats up the Swan, the badness of the soil, the heat of the
weather, with many other things of the same kind, appeared to be
subjects of general conversation, when worshipping at the shrine
of Bacchus; and, after being assailed on every hand by such
miserable comforter's, I found it necessary to leave them, and go
to look for myself; and after reaching the Peninsula (where I now
reside), was convinced that the land was of a useful character,
and might be made to suit the general purposes of agriculture,
although inferior to much of the land higher up the Swan. The
first three or four months were taken up by house and
boat-building, getting up the goods from Fremantle to the
Peninsula, &amp;c. &amp;c. In June we began to clear the land,
and plough for wheat, barley, oats, rye, &amp;c., all of which
came up well; but the fences not being sufficiently good, the
cattle broke in, and destroyed a great part of the
crop&mdash;that which escaped their ravages came to maturity, and
was of a very good description. The last year, 1831 has convinced
me that when the land can have tillage, and proper management, it
will grow wheat, barley, oats, rye, potatoes, and turnips, in
great abundance: very good specimens of the aforesaid articles
were produced the last year&mdash;the average weight of wheat
from 62lbs. to 65lbs. the bushel.
*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*
As it respects the colony at large, there is little doubt but it
will succeed, <i>and well</i>, if it receive that encouragement
and support which all colonies need in their infancy. We have
already seen the wilderness become a fruitful field, bending
beneath the gentle breeze, and are looking forward to the time
when every diligent man shall be surrounded with peace and
plenty."</blockquote>
<p>At the date of this letter, Mr. Hardy purchased from the
Governor, then about to return to England, some cows of Colonel
Arbuthnot's fatuous short-horned breed. For these he gave forty
pounds a piece, and, as the author was told; paid for them out of
the produce of the preceding harvest.</p>
<p>At Guildford the town-grants amount to from two to font acres
each. Here are some industrious small farmers (principally
brought out by Mr. Peel). As soon as these men had built cottages
and performed the location duties on their first grants, others
were assigned them by the Government. This village has a very
interesting appearance, and covers a considerable space of
ground. Each cottage is surrounded by its garden, and has fields
neatly fenced contiguous.</p>
<p>The Helena river, flowing from the east, joins the Swan at
Guildford. It takes its rise in an elevated plain, within the
Darling range, and pursues a course of from fifty to sixty miles
through a valley which is in many parts rocky, and singularly
beautiful and romantic. As this river approaches the Swan, its
banks present some of the richest alluvial soil hitherto found in
the country. Here Sir James Stirling has a farm, extending across
from one river to the other, and which has been highly improved.
Woodbridge, his country residence, is a <i>cottage ornée</i>,
beautifully place on a high bank, which overhangs the Swan, and
commanding a view of two fine reaches of the river. On the
opposite bank is the residence of Mr. Walcot, whose farm, garden
and establishment, are such as a traveller would be pleased to
find even at the Cape, but much more so in a recent settlement:
the same observation applies to a number of other farms in the
colony. In this vicinity, and within a distance of three miles,
are the residences of the following gentlemen:&mdash;Messrs.
Tanner, M'Dermott, Ridley, Whitfield, Thompson, Trimmer (two),
Wells, Lewis, Boyd. Brown, Drummond, and Captain Meares, late of
the Life Guards.&mdash;Mr. Tanner is one of the most scientific
and extensive farmers in the colony, and has directed his
attention both to sheep farming and tillage. He possesses one of
the best grants at the head of the river; and which, after
considerably improving and erecting thereon a house and offices,
he has let. He now rents the Governor's farm (on which he
resides), and another in the neighbourhood; besides occupying a
third there, which is his own property.&mdash;Mr. M'Dermott,
after many years spent in the service of his country as a
military officer, is now distinguished by his activity and
unwearied devotedness to his new avocations.&mdash;Captain
Meares, as a settler, still retains the energy and activity which
he displayed while a cavalry officer. With a view to the comfort
of his numerous and amiable family, he is residing at present
near Guildford, but his principal grant is on the
Murray.&mdash;Lieut. Roe, R.N., the Surveyor-General, has a fine
grant in this neighbourhood, to the improvement of which, he has
not yet been able to turn his attention: his professional duties
are laborious, and greatly occupy his time. This gentleman was
for several years employed in surveying the coast of New Holland,
under Captain Philip King, R.N., and owes his present appointment
to the peculiar talent he displayed on that service.</p>
<p>As the traveller continues ascending the river, he passes the
farm of Dr. Harris, and those of Messrs. Andrews and Yule. The
establishment of the latter gentleman is one of the most
complete. His people are Scotch; and, by their trust-worthiness
and sobriety, added to industry and skill in their occupations,
and, above all, their attention to their children's education,
and their observance of the sabbath, they uphold the high
character generally acceded to the Scottish peasant both at home
and abroad.&mdash;Further on is the establishment of Mr. Lennard;
and nearly opposite to it, on the left bank, is that of Mr.
Brockman. These gentlemen are among the most extensive and
successful farmers and graziers in the colony, and practise the
improved modes of culture adopted in Essex and Kent, from which
counties they respectively come. Above these are several smaller
farmers, and some grants of non-resident proprietors.</p>
<p>Still higher up the river, and extending beyond where it is
navigable, the following proprietors have estates:&mdash;Messrs.
Moore, Tanner, Shaw, Brown, Burgess (three), Bull, Leake, Mackie,
and several others. The settlers here are deserving of
distinguished notice. Mr. Moore (the Advocate General) possesses
a considerable flock of sheep, and, in the intervals of his
official occupations, takes great interest in his farm and
garden.&mdash;Mr. Shaw, who was an officer in the Rifle brigade,
is also a sheep-farmer, and is most laborious and indefatigable
in prosecuting his agricultural pursuits.&mdash;Mr. Brown (the
Colonial Secretary) has one of the best farms in this part,
which, with a comfortable house and offices upon it, is let to
another settler. This gentleman has also one of the most improved
farms in the neighbourhood of Guildford.&mdash;The three Messrs.
Burgess, who are brothers, rival Mr. Shaw in the spirit with
which they follow up their occupations. In addition to their own,
they rent the farm of Mr. Tanner in this vicinity, and likewise
carry on a brewery.&mdash;Mr. Leake, who is one of the first
merchants in the colony, and Government Resident at Fremantle, is
connected with Mr. Bull in his farming speculations, in which
they have been remarkably successful.&mdash;Henley Park, so named
by Sir James Stirling, when he explored the country in 1827, from
its resemblance to the estate of a relation of his in
Surrey,&mdash;is the joint property of Mr. Mackie, the colonial
judge, and of the writer; and it is chiefly to their steward,
Richard Edwards (already noticed as a settler brought out by Mr.
Peel), that they are indebted for the high state of cultivation
to which the farm and garden have been brought.</p>
<p>With a view of showing what can be done by a single energetic
mind, it may be, useful to give a slight sketch of what Edwards
has accomplished. One of the first things he set about was, to
prepare materials for a substantial house, for which purpose he
made and burnt bricks and tiles out of the clay required to be
removed to clear the foundation of the house, thereby saving the
expense and labour of carriage. He had to explore the country to
ascertain where the best lime could be procured. This he found,
at the time, no nearer than in one of the bays of Melville Water,
below Perth; whence, after burning, he brought it up in boats.
The timber, which was mahogany, cut down on the estate, was sawn
and prepared by his son, the carpenter, with the assistance of
another man; while he himself was the bricklayer and builder. The
house is double, consisting of two stories, and is one of the
largest in the colony.</p>
<p>In the farm-yard he has many ingenious contrivances to meet
the wants and habits of its various tribes. His geese and ducks
are provided with ample ponds, in the sides of which he has
constructed dwellings suitable to them, where they find
protection from the heat, and security from the native dog, the
only animal they have to fear. His cattle and pigs are kept in
fine order.</p>
<p>In the improvement of the gardens he takes peculiar delight,
and is very successful; having a good knowledge of horticulture,
acquired by serving an apprenticeship to a market gardener. The
spot he fixed upon for his first one was a somewhat elevated
morass, on sloping ground, separated from the house by a ravine,
and covered with rank vegetation, owing to latent springs. These,
after burning off the surface, he dug out, and formed into
circular wells of close and substantial brick-work, rising
several layers above the surface: from these wells, at different
elevations, he is enabled to conduct the water in channels to
almost every part of the garden. When the last accounts left, he
was constructing earthen pipes for the purpose of completing his
plans of irrigation, and also for conveying water across the
ravine to the height on which the house is situated. In this
garden, and in another larger one, hereafter to be noticed,
almost every kind of vegetable, and as many sorts of fruit-trees
as have been introduced from tropical and extra-tropical
countries, are found to flourish. Among the former was the
mangel-wurzel, already mentioned as having a root six feet in
circumference; the tomato grows here luxuriantly, weighed down
with the load of its beautiful fruit, which gives so fine a
flavour to sauces, soups, &amp;c. Among the fruit-trees, he has
raised many hundred almonds and Cape-gooseberries, the latter a
delicious fruit, producing every month; and also figs and vines
in abundance, the latter bearing grapes of a fine and rich
flavour.</p>
<p>In front of the house are about two hundred acres of rich
meadow, encircled nearly by the river. The situation of a part of
this meadow attracted his notice, from its being inclosed between
the river, and a natural moat of a semicircular form. This moat
he dug out, to a considerable depth and breadth, throwing the
soil on the inner banks of the inclosure, which he faced with a
firm wall of green turf, and made to slope down gradually on the
inner side. Along the whole extent of this sloping bank, which is
of the finest alluvial soil, are planted in profusion vegetables
and fruit-trees. The bank shelves down to a walk made all round
within the inclosure, an area of about thirty acres. Most of the
interior is now under cultivation, bearing crops of wheat, oats,
and barley. He intends, both here and in the garden before
mentioned, to shelter some of the walks from the sun by trellised
vines. There is also, adjoining this latter garden, and separated
from the house by the ravine fore alluded to, a small rocky hill,
favourable for vines, and which he has marked out for a vineyard.
In addition to the above, is laid out&mdash;in front of the
house, and on the slope of the hill, where there are no
springs&mdash;a winter garden, in which he has displayed
considerable ingenuity and taste. His two smaller gardens are
from one to two acres each.</p>
<p>In his agricultural pursuits Edwards has been equally
successful. He seems to have acquired his knowledge of farming,
while following his trade of a master-brickmaker in
Gloucestershire, in consequence of having purchased a few acres
of the Forest of Dean, which he reclaimed and made into a farm.
At times when the necessaries of life have been very scarce and
dear in the colony, he has provided for his family in abundance;
and has added to their comforts within the last two years by
availing himself of his knowledge of malting and brewing. This
indefatigable man has found time for performing the location
duties on an adjoining estate, the half of which, amounting to
from two to three thousand acres, he obtained as a return from
the owner, himself a merchant at Fremantle. He also made the
bricks, and constructed the walls, of a dwelling-house recently
erected by Mr. Bull, who resides within a mile of him.&mdash;The
writer has occupied a much larger space than he intended with
these minute details, partly to do justice to a faithful and
valuable servant, and principally with a view of conveying some
useful instruction to those who may have yet to learn what are
the requisites for a successful colonist.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* It ought to be mentioned, to the credit of
this English yeoman, that when a project was started some time
ago of supplying the religious wants of this part of the
settlement, he expressed his desire to contribute by giving his
gratuitous services, as a builder &amp;c., towards the erection
of a church.]</p>
<p>To return from this digression, it is impossible to leave this
part of the colony without giving some account of the really
splendid establishment of Mr. Bull. This gentleman is a
Lieutenant in the Navy, and affords a striking proof how well
qualified officers in his branch of the public service may be to
become settlers, from the energy and fortitude to which their
professional habits give rise. He had acquired some knowledge of
farming during a residence in Bedfordshire. Mr. Bull appears to
have had in his eye the solid comfort of the substantial English
farmer of the olden time. His kitchen, which is lofty and
spacious, and has a fire-place of corresponding dimensions, is
well garnished with flitches of bacon and other tokens of good
cheer. After sharing with his numerous servants in their various
employments&mdash;often himself holding the plough&mdash;it was
his custom to sit down with them, presiding at the head of a long
table plentifully furnished with plain but excellent fare,
chiefly the produce of his own farm; to which were added good
beer and ale, from barley grown, malted, and brewed, on the
premises. The quantity he raises of wheat and other grain, and
also of hay, equals, if not exceeds, the produce of any other
colonist. His mill, which was constructed under his own
direction, and is worked by horses, not only grinds the flour
which is used in his own establishment, but returns him a
considerable profit, by what it grinds for other settlers. Among
his numerous cattle, are some of the finest cows in the colony,
the genuine produce of the Duke of Bedford's famous breed,
obtained directly from Woburn. This gentleman, after having, by
his strenuous exertions, overcome the difficulties of
establishing himself in a new country, and provided an excellent
home, has completed his comforts by marrying a lady in the
colony, whose management of his extensive dairy, and of those
departments which are under her immediate superintendence, is
equally admirable with that of her husband in his peculiar
avocations. The butter and cheese from Mrs. Bull's dairy are in
great request in the market.&mdash;The writer cannot take leave
of this fine establishment and its owners without bearing his
testimony to the hospitality which reigns there; nor can he omit
to mention that, by the settlers in general, this virtue is
practised to an extent that he has not seen surpassed among the
various civilized and barbarous nations that it has been his lot
to visit, while on foreign service, or in the course of somewhat
extensive travels when on leave of absence, from his youth
upwards.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>In proceeding by water from Perth to the Canning, the
traveller has to pass through that part of the estuary called
Melville Water, from which he enters the river in question. A
short distance above its mouth, there are flats similar to those
in the Swan, that impede the navigation, and over which it is
necessary, in the dry season, to shove the boats about half a
mile. The Canning is much narrower than the Swan, and navigable a
less distance; but the principal farms on its banks are
accessible by its means. From Perth to the mouth of the Canning
it is about five miles, and the principal locations are situated
about six or seven miles up the stream.</p>
<p>By land there are two roads by which this district may be
reached; one of them sets out from the point opposite Mount
Eliza, where there is a horse-ferry. This is a bush-road used by
carts, and the distance to the chief farms is about ten miles
from the point. The other road goes round by Guildford, from
whence there is still eight miles further to cross to the
Canning. The road is of a similar description to the other. There
is a shallow lagoon midway from Guildford, but, having a hard
bottom, it presents no serious obstacle to the traveller.</p>
<p>The principal proprietors on the Canning are, Major Nairne,
Messrs. Phillips and Davis, Captains Bannister and Pegus, Messrs.
Bull, Yule, Hester, Gregory, Bickley, Leroux, Drake, and Morgan.
The most improved farm is that of Major Nairne, who furnishes a
striking instance that officers, military as well as naval, are
calculated by their professional habits to become efficient
settlers in a new country. This gentleman, who had been in his
Majesty's 46th regiment nearly half a century, is not surpassed
in energy and enterprise by any settler in the colony. Finding,
on his arrival in 1831, that horses and other working stock were
much in demand, he took the first opportunity to proceed to Van
Diemen's Land; and shortly after, returned with a cargo of horses
and cattle of a very useful description, which he sold to
advantage. Subsequently, the estate of which he is now in
possession came into the market; when, finding the land was
excellent, and had been much improved by its owner Mr. Phillips,
who had also built on it a good house and offices, he purchased
the whole, including some stock, for upwards of 2000<i>l</i>.,
and commenced farming with vigour. On one occasion after harvest,
not finding a ready sale for his crops, and knowing that in
Madras he could sell his potatoes, which formed a considerable
part of them, to great advantage, the Major purchased a vessel of
about 70 tons burden, then lying in Gage's Roads, in which he
proceeded with his produce to Madras; and re, turned from thence
with a cargo laid in there, after having disposed of his original
one to good account.&mdash;Mr. Phillips has taken another grant,
adjoining that which he sold to Major Nairne, where he has
renewed his farming operations. Mr. P. is not only skilful in
farming pursuits, but has a knowledge of mechanics, and has been
his own engineer in the erection of a flour mill.&mdash;Some of
those who have occupied the best cultivated farms in this
district have let them to others, and removed to better or more
extensive grants on the Swan, and in other parts. There is little
natural meadow on the Canning; and, although some of the grants
have a considerable proportion of good land, yet this is far from
being generally the case.</p>
<p>Proceeding upwards, towards the source of the Canning, between
four and five miles above Major Nairne's farm, is the small
village of Kelmscott (also a military post), situated on both
banks of the river, where it issues, a narrow stream, from the
gorge of hills that form part of the Darling Range. There is some
excellent land in the neighbourhood, which induced several
capitalists to settle there; but after establishing themselves,
they removed; principally, it is believed, in consequence of the
site being too sequestered, and remote from the markets. It is
about three miles above the part where the river is
navigable.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>The town of York lies in a due east direction from Guildford.
The road is, at present, circuitous, owing to rocks, trees,
&amp;c., which offer a temporary obstruction, and is about
fifty-five miles in length. It passes for about six miles over a
plain before it ascends the hills; and proceeding for a similar
distance over the mountains, crosses a small stream, which is a
branch of the Helena. The line of this stream has hitherto been
nearly parallel to that of the road; but it here turns off to the
south-east, in which direction the river has its source. Further
on, and about midway between Guildford and York, is a farm, the
owner of which has built a good house for an inn. Descending the
hills, the site of the infant town of York is indicated by Mount
Bakewell, a conical hill on the west bank of the Avon. The town
locations are 50 acres each; and are laid out round the base of
the hill, and along the river to the southward.</p>
<p>The situation is cheerful and open. Plains, resembling park
scenery, and bearing fine pasture for sheep, slope down to the
Avon. Mount Bakewell, and likewise some low hills on the east
bank, are covered with good pasture, which, when turned yellow by
the sun, has the appearance of rich crops; and, being contrasted
with the evergreen shrubs and trees scattered over the surface,
greatly enlivens the landscape. In summer, the bed of the river
may be here crossed dry-shod, although above and below there are
fine deep reaches of water a mile or two in length.</p>
<p>Among the settlers who have been the most prosperous in the
colony, are Messrs. Bland, A. Trimmer, and Heale, who have been
for several years located here. They have succeeded admirably
with their flocks, herds, and crops. The two former gentlemen
have now a flock of 1400 sheep.</p>
<p>The colonists seem now alive to the value of this fine
district. The following is an extract from a letter of Sir James
Stirling, dated the 3rd of December last, and addressed to
Charles E. Mangles, Esq.:&mdash;"I have inspected the York
district, Bland's establishment, &amp;c. They are in a most
prosperous condition; and, undoubtedly, if Bland live, he will be
a man of great wealth. Other flocks are now going over to that
quarter, where there are one thousand square miles of the finest
imaginable sheep land. Amongst others, Lady Stirling's
fine-woolled flock will cross the hills in a few days, and every
exertion is making to procure sheep, it being evidently the best
speculation in this country." Sir James goes on to say, that he
is straining every nerve to promote investments of money in
sheep, in consequence of the extraordinary profit which
sheep-farming there is expected to yield. Some of the colonists,
actuated by similar expectations, have, as recent accounts state,
formed themselves into a company for the purchase of sheep. Their
proposal is to raise a fund by 100<i>l</i>. shares, with a view
to the profit arising from fine wool. They anticipate that much
expense will be saved by keeping combined flocks, in preference
to having smaller ones, each under a distinct shepherd. The plan
will also furnish an opportunity to persons who live in the
towns, and are not immediately engaged in farming pursuits, to
participate in such speculations. Among the most active members
of this association is Mr. Commissary Lewis, who is anxious to
encourage any scheme calculated to promote the welfare of the
settlement. He is possessed of a considerable grant in the York
district, and has, for some time, been a sheep proprietor.</p>
<br>
<p>The writer will now briefly advert to the out-stations on the
coast. Near the mouth of the estuary of the Murray River, forty
miles south of Fremantle, are settled, Mr. Peel, Captain Byrne
(late of the Rifle brigade), and Mr. Hall. There are also other
grants on which the proprietors are not resident, principally
owing to the feeling of insecurity that has existed, from the
hostile character of the Murray tribe. Into this estuary, besides
the Murray River, properly so called, two smaller streams empty
themselves. The estuary varies from two to five miles in breadth,
and its length from north to south is about sixteen. The interior
in this direction is but imperfectly known; but it appears, from
recent explorations, to include some very rich land; and, should
a good understanding be now established with the natives there,
it will probably prove a valuable district for tillage and
grazing. That it is well adapted to the latter purpose, is
indicated by the circumstance, that a considerable herd of wild
cattle in fine condition has been seen in that quarter, which
must have rapidly increased, being the produce of such as had
strayed from the Government herds, and those of the settlers, at
an early period of the colony.</p>
<p>Mr. Peel, though with a very reduced establishment, continues
to prosecute his farming operations with great energy and
perseverance; and has displayed singular fortitude, considering
the severe losses he has sustained.&mdash;Capt. Byrne is also an
active and enterprising colonist, but has not long been located
on the Murray. He has a farm and house on the Swan, which is let
to advantage, and a grant in the York district.&mdash;Mr. Hall,
is a man of singular firmness and intrepidity. He is residing,
with his wife and children and his servants, on the left bank of
the river, the other settlers being located on the opposite side.
This gentleman had mingled more with the aborigines in that
district, and obtained a greater influence over them, than any
other settler. He has been known to pass several days together
along with them in the bush, and has thus acquired a considerable
knowledge of their habits and language. A favourite project of
his, just before the author left the colony, was a fishery, which
he had actually commenced with the assistance of the natives;
and, on one occasion, he came to Fremantle, along the coast, in
his boat manned and rowed by a party of them. The circumstance,
while it shows the remarkable influence this settler had
acquired, evinces also the docility and quickness of the natives.
Mr. Hall is of a commanding appearance, and is generally habited
in a singular costume, of which a conical hat, usually worn by
Malays, forms not the least conspicuous part.</p>
<br>
<p>About fifty miles further to the south is Port Leschenault, or
more correctly speaking Leschenault Inlet, a part of the coast
much exposed, especially to the winds prevailing in winter. Here
two rivers, the Preston and the Collie, fall into an estuary,
which, like all the others on this coast, has a bar-mouth, with
depth of water sufficient only for boats to enter. The best land
in this neighbourhood is on the banks of the Collie, and on the
hills; which last, however, are heavily timbered. The plain
country resembles that of Swan River, but there are no settlers
located on it. About twenty-five miles further down the coast is
Vasse's Inlet, which is likewise exposed to the winter wing The
country here is open, and considered well adapted for the plough,
or the breeding of cattle.</p>
<br>
<p>Some five miles further, proceeding towards the Blackwood and
Augusta, an iron-stone district is passed over, which is heavily
timbered, and bears but scanty herbage. This description of
country continues to within a couple of miles of the river, when
the land changes to a red loam. The distance between the Vasse
and the part of the river nearest it may be about twenty miles.
The banks of the Blackwood are mostly covered with a dense
forest; the soil is occasionally a good sandy loam, but generally
of a lighter and inferior quality. There is much beautiful and
romantic scenery in the neighbourhood of Augusta. The land even
on the shore here is rich; but so thickly wooded, as to render
its clearing very expensive, and discouraging to the settlers.
Fine crops of wheat, barley, Indian corn, oats, and potatoes, are
raised here. Augusta is peculiarly adapted for a whale-fishing
establishment, as the whales frequent this part of the coast in
great numbers; the beach also is well suited for cutting them up,
and the bay sheltered from the prevailing winds in winter. The
fur seal also abounds. Near Augusta there is a fine stream of
fresh water, sufficient to turn a mill, and constant all the year
round, which is rarely the case with the streams in that country.
There are some enterprising settlers located here, especially
Captain Molloy, on half-pay of the Rifle brigade; in which
distinguished corps he served in the Peninsula, and at Waterloo,
where he was severely wounded. This gentleman has a fine and
productive garden, in which he takes great interest. He has been
Government Resident at Augusta since the formation of the
settlement.&mdash;There is likewise a Mr. Turner, who, after many
years of successful occupation in London as a builder, has become
an energetic settler here; also Messrs. Kellum, and others. About
a dozen miles up the Blackwood are located a respectable and
amiable family of the name of Bussell, consisting of a lady, the
widow of a clergyman, and five sons and three daughters grown up.
The eldest of the sons is a graduate of Oxford, and an
accomplished scholar. These gentlemen do not neglect their
literary pursuits, while they find time to attend to all the
various occupations required from settlers. Several miles above
where this family is situated, are the Messrs. Chapman. The
population of this district, including a small detachment of
military, is about a hundred souls. At this station, the settlers
have had the happiness of living in almost uninterrupted
friendship' with the natives: some of the former have extensive
grants at the Vase (where there is an estuary with a river
running into it), and are said to be on the point of removing
thither, on account of its being much more eligible than the
banks of the Blackwood, for farming operations; the Messrs.
Bussell are reported to have already partially located themselves
there.</p>
<p>A lady who is a relative of a family residing at Augusta,
feeling the great disadvantage which that sequestered settlement
labours under, for want of a provision for public worship, has
set on foot a subscription, limited to a very small sum, for the
erection of a church and parsonage, which, it is hoped, will meet
with encouragement. The plan will be found in the Appendix.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix, No. 6.]</p>
<br>
<p>Between Augusta and King George's Sound no intercourse has yet
been opened by land. The distance by sea is about 180 miles. This
latter settlement had been occupied some years by the Sydney
Government as a convict station; but was subsequently handed over
to the Western Australian Government, and the convicts were
withdrawn. The great attraction of King George's Sound is its
splendid harbour; it is also well situated for a whale and seal
fishery station, both which kinds of fish abound on this
coast.</p>
<p>Agriculture here has hitherto made but little progress. The
land immediately adjoining the Sound is, in general, light and
sandy, and, with the exception of a few patches, not at all
calculated for the production of wheat. Settlers, therefore, who
wish to possess arable farms, must go at least twenty-five miles
into the country; and, as there is no water-communication with
the interior of any description, no person should proceed thither
at present, with a view to agricultural pursuits, who does not
possess a sufficient stock of working bullocks or horses.
Allusion has already been made to the circumstance that the land
in the interior of King George's Sound is considered equal to
that of the York district; and so favourable an opinion does Sir
James Stirling entertain of this south-east part of the colony,
that lie has chosen almost all his large grant there. Sir Richard
Spencer, a Captain in the navy, who has been Government Resident
at King George's Sound for nearly two years, is a very active and
enterprising colonist. He and several members of his large family
have commenced, with considerable means, in agriculture and
sheep-farming; and, some of them, with an intention, it is said,
of combining therewith commercial pursuits. Mr. Cheyne is an old
and highly respectable settler here, and has been joined from
time to time by several of his relatives, who went out on his
report. His views are understood to be chiefly commercial. It is
a circumstance in favour of this part of the settlement, that
uninterrupted amity with the natives has been maintained since it
was transferred to the Western Australian Government. Recent
letters from settlers among the latest arrivals there, complain
of the high price of provisions and the failure of their crops of
vegetables; but the accounts of some of the old-established
settlers continue favourable.</p>
<p>Whatever difficulties this part of the colony may have
hitherto presented, the writer ventures his opinion with some
reluctance, that all has not been done by the settlers, with
perhaps two or three exceptions, that might have been expected.
Whether this has been occasioned chiefly by their limited means
and the paucity of their numbers, or by a want of union and
co-operation, in order to bring their actual strength and
resources to bear upon particular points, and thus to avail
themselves of the peculiar advantages which that station, even
now, holds out, he will not venture, at this distance, to
determine; but he cannot bul fear there is much truth in the view
which the Editor of the Western Australian Journal takes of this
subject. The following extract is from an article in that paper,
inserted in November last.</p>
<blockquote>"By the Ellen, Government schooner, we have
intelligence from King George's Sound to the end of October, and,
we lament to say, not altogether of a favourable nature, the
settlers there remaining in a state of torpor, awaiting the
enlivening influence of assistance from Government to open roads
into the interior of the country, where they can find soil and
pasturage adapted for agricultural purposes. That the settlers
may reasonably require this assistance to a limited extent we are
ready to admit, and have little doubt the subject has been under
his Excellency the Governor's consideration; but we would caution
the settlers at the Sound against embarking too generally in
agricultural pursuits, on a spot where their capital can be
applied to much greater advantage to themselves and the
community, in the fisheries or sealing. If strangers can make it
answer their purpose to come to their harbours, and within a
short distance of their doors, for these commodities, surely a
little activity and enterprize, coupled with the means which we
know the inhabitants possess, would soon place them in a state of
positive independence, beyond any thing they can anticipate to
realize after numerous years of toil and anxiety in the pursuits
of agriculture. Some, from choice, their previous habits of life
influencing their determination, will direct their attention to
these pursuits, and they, from experience, may succeed; but the
mere amateur agriculturist must inevitably fail. If wealth is
required, or if it be the patriotic object of advancing the
settlement (some having denied that they are in search of riches,
but merely social ease and the ordinary enjoyments of life), the
end can be most speedily attained by establishing a Whaling
Company; to which enter-prize, we are persuaded, increased
activity would be given, by the ready co-operation of some of our
monied neighbours."</blockquote>
<p>In the same number of that Journal appears a petition
addressed to the Home Government, and signed by sixteen settlers
at King George's Sound, soliciting to have it made a convict
station. This petition fully admits that the colony was
originally founded on the principle of free labour; and that the
general opinion of the settlers formerly was, that the presence
of convicts would be objectionable. It acknowledges, that the
settlement "possesses equal, if not superior advantages to either
of the sister colonies of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land;
"but pleads for convicts on the ground of the difficulties they
have to encounter in opening proper lines of communication.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* It is curious to observe in connexion with the
petition, that the "Sydney Herald" was, almost at the very same
time, calling out for the withdrawal of convicts from that
settlement, in consequence of the "rapid increase of crime." "It
must now be obvious to the colonists," says this journal, "that
if we place the convict system in one scale, and a free
population in the other, the one is an abominable system of
misrule and gross depravity, and the other is the only system by
which this country (New South Wales) can gain a standing among
the British colonies." The writer concludes in these words, "Free
labour will flourish in this country, as it has done in every
<i>free</i> colony under the British crown."<br>
<br>
The following passage is also extracted from an article in the
same journal, written on occasion of the recent murder of Dr.
Wardell:&mdash;"In no country is life so insecure as in this: the
convict servants being, in numerous instances, the first to
destroy it. Let us look back and witness the scenes of atrocious
murders that have been perpetrated under such circumstances. We
see the murder of Mr. Clements; of Mr. M'Intyre, by his convict
servant; of Captain Payne; of Mr. Campbell, at his own door; of
Captain Waldron, by his female convicts; of Captain Logan,
through the instrumentality of blacks, incited by runaway
convicts; and many other individuals of a more lowly rank in
life. Each instance of the kind proves that the convict system,
with its attendant satellite the convict government, is bad, and
must be speedily remedied."]</p>
<p>These few individuals, about half of whom appear to be among
the recent arrivals, wish to get out of their temporary
difficulties, by the adoption of a measure which cannot be too
strongly deprecated. Once introduced to King George's Sound, and
the convicts would soon find their way, as bush-rangers, over the
whole of the colony. Recent accounts state, that a party of
settlers, attended by a Government Surveyor, had visited the
Hotham, a river 100 miles south of the Swan. They are represented
as having returned highly pleased with the country, more
especially with that on the banks of the river. Mr. Tanner, it is
added, had made arrangements to have his grant there located
immediately. With a view of marking out a line of road through
the interior, the Surveyor-General was to proceed, after some
interval, to that neighbourhood, and from thence to King George's
Sound. The Governor himself had just embarked for that port; and,
as the opening of the inland communication is a subject he has
long contemplated, its accomplishment may shortly be expected.
The country the road will penetrate is reported to be abundantly
supplied with water, and places suitable for good stock stations.
It would appear from Captain Bannister's statement, that a great
deal of the country is open, where it would require but little
labour for the formation of a road.</p>
<p>When once this line of communication, however imperfectly, is
opened, King George's Sound will become a station of great
importance, it being but ten days sail from Van Diemen's Land. It
will, consequently, afford great facilities for the introduction
of stock from that colony and Sydney, without exposure to the
risk and loss that are often encountered in doubling Cape
Leeuwin.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the monstrous project of making King
George's Sound a penal settlement, is not likely to gain many
adherents in the colony. The following passages from Archbishop
Whately's First Letter to Earl Grey are presented to the reader,
as calculated for ever to set that question at rest. After
pointing out the results of the errors Great Britain has
committed in her old colonies, and remarking that our new
colonies are not yet out of our forming hands, the writer thus
proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<p class="dindent">"There is one, especially, in the constitution
of which we are bound to retrace, if possible, all our
steps,&mdash;bound on every principle of expediency and national
honour; nay, on a principle (if such principle there be) of
national <i>conscience</i>. It will be readily understood that
this one is the convict colony in New South Wales,&mdash;a colony
founded and maintained on principles which, if acted on by an
individual in private life, would expose him to the charge either
of insanity or of shameless profligacy. Imagine the case of a
household most carefully made up of picked specimens from all the
idle, mischievous, and notoriously bad characters in the country!
Surely the man who should be mad or wicked enough to bring
together this monstrous family, and to keep up its numbers and
character by continual fresh supplies, would be scouted from the
society he so outraged&mdash;would be denounced as the author of
a diabolical nuisance to his neighbours and his country, would be
proclaimed infamous for setting at nought all morality and
decency. What is it better, that, instead of a household, it is a
whole people we have so brought together, and are so keeping
up?&mdash;that it is the wide society of the whole world, and not
of a single country, against which the nuisance is committed?"
After explaining his views as to the remedies to be applied, the
writer adds&mdash;"But these measures, if carried into effect at
all, must be taken in hand soon. Time&mdash;no distant time,
perhaps&mdash;may place this 'foul disnatured' progeny of ours
out of our power for good or for harm. Let us count the years
that have passed since we first scattered emigrants along the
coast of America. It is but as yesterday&mdash;and look at the
gigantic people that has arisen. Thank Heaven! that in morals and
in civilization they are at this day what they are. But can we
look forward without a shudder at the appalling spectacle which a
few generations hence may be doomed to witness in Australia? Pass
by as many years to come as it has taken the United States of
America to attain to their present maturity, and here will be
another new world with another new people, stretching out its
population unchecked; rapid in its increase of wealth, and art,
and power; taking its place in the congress of the mightiest
nations; rivalling, perhaps ruling them; and then think what
stuff this people will have been made of; and who it is that
posterity will then curse for bringing this mildew on the social
intercourse of the world; who it is that will be answerable for
the injury done by it to human virtue and human happiness at a
tribunal more distant, but more awful even than posterity." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Archbishop Whately's Thoughts on Secondary
Punishment, being a Letter addressed to Earl Grey, pp. 202, 3,
4.]</p>
<p>How our transportation system appears in the eyes of Europe
may be judged of, by the following extract from "Remarks of the
French Commissioners on the American System of Secondary
Punishments:"</p>
<p class="dindent">"Society in Australia is divided into
different classes, as distinct and inimical to each other as the
different classes of the middle age. The criminal is exposed to
the contempt of him who has obtained his liberty; he, to the
outrage of his own son, born free; and all, to the pride of the
colonist whose origin is without blemish. They resemble four
hostile nations meeting on the same soil. We may judge of the
feelings which animate these different members of the same
people, by the following extract from the Report of Mr.
Bigges:&mdash;'As long as these sentiments of jealousy and enmity
subsist,' says he, 'the introduction of trial by jury into the
colony must not be thought of. In the actual state of things, a
jury composed of former criminals cannot fail to combine against
an accused person belonging to the class of free colonists; in
the same manner, juries chosen from among free colonists, will
always think they show the purity of their own class in
condemning an old convict against whom a second accusation should
be directed.'" **</p>

<br>
<p><span class="aa">Having</span> now conducted the reader to the
several stations in the colony, with the view of enabling him to
form some idea of the state and progress of the settlement, it
remains to complete this part of the subject by glancing at the
general state of society. On this topic considerable light is
thrown by a little volume made up of passages extracted from
letters and journals * transmitted to his friends at home by Mr.
Moore, the Advocate-General. Originally intended solely for the
perusal of a private circle, and therefore thrown off in evident
haste, and without the slightest view to publication, and often
only recording the fleeting rumour of the day, it is to be
regretted that these documents were not submitted to his pruning
hand. Some inconvenience has arisen from this; and not the least
is, that some of the acts of the colonial government have gone
forth to the public with, though no doubt most unintentionally, a
degree of false colouring; and this communicated by a gentleman
described as filling at the time a judicial situation. But it is
to be borne in mind, that Mr. Moore was then a judge in the Civil
Court only, and had not the slightest connexion with the judicial
inquiries and proceedings which terminated in the acts alluded
to. **</p>
<p class="foot">[* Extracts of the Letters and Journals of George
Fletcher Moore, Esq. &amp;c. &amp;c., edited by Mr. Martin Doyle.
Orr and Smith, Amen Corner.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Though not at all of the <i>spirit</i>, yet
certainly of the <i>heedlessness</i>, with which Col. Napier has
commented upon one especially of these acts, the writer feels he
has occasion to complain. The following passage occurs in page
129 of the Colonel's last work, when alluding to the execution of
Midgegoroo. "Now, if this man bad committed any crime, which may
perhaps have been the case, <i>though it does not so appear by
Mr. Moore's account</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c." Will the reader
believe that the Colonel had himself just recorded, in the next
preceding page of his work, the following extract from Mr.
Moore?&mdash;"May 22nd. <i>Midgegoroo, after having been fully
identified as a principal actor in three murders at least</i>,
has been shot at the jail door by a party of the military."
Incredible as it may appear, such is actually the inconsistency
into which mere heedlessness has betrayed Colonel Napier.]</p>
<br>
<p>As in this work there are frequent complaints of indentured
servants, a few words respecting them may here be called for. The
character of this class of persons is about the average of that
of persons in similar occupations in England, except so far as it
is modified by the new circumstances in which they are placed, of
which they very naturally avail themselves. Feeling their own
importance to their employer's comfort and success, and that he
cannot easily dispense with them, or in most instances readily
supply their places, they are apt to presume on this knowledge,
and thus, in some instances, become an occasion of considerable
annoyance to their masters. Too much pains cannot be taken to
draw them off from the use of spirits, to which they have already
become greatly accustomed, from the absence of malt liquors in
the colony. As brewing succeeds well, and the hop has begun to be
planted, it is hoped that the evil will receive a timely check.
The additional duties that have been lately imposed on spirits
may also contribute to this desirable result.</p>
<br>
<p>In taking a general view of the state of society, it will be
requisite to make some further allusion to the natives. The
writer, indeed, has a particular inducement to revert to them,
having been favoured with a sight of an additional file of the
Perth Gazette, which has reached the Colonial Office, since the
early sheets of this pamphlet went to press. It has been already
noticed as a leading circumstance affecting the state and
progress of society in this settlement, that the aborigines are
so inconsiderable in point of numbers. This will greatly
facilitate the humane and enlightened policy that the Governor is
adopting; and which, if successful (and the writer confesses that
he is inclined to be sanguine on this head), will not only bring
these tribes within the pale of civilization, but speedily render
them useful and valuable members of a British community,
sheltering them under its protection, and enabling them to
participate largely in the general prosperity of the colony. The
last arrivals state that the Governor has formed an institution
at Mount Eliza, near Perth, for the immediate purpose of
civilizing the natives in that district. Mr. Armstrong, a settler
who has acquired a considerable knowledge of their language, and
has associated much with them in their primitive haunts, has been
judiciously selected to act as interpreter and superintendent. A
main object proposed is to teach and encourage the natives to
acquire the means of regular subsistence, whether by working for
individual settlers, or by following up, and improving in, the
various arts to which they are already accustomed. In fishing,
fox instance, a pursuit in which they combine great ignorance
with much dexterity, they are to be assisted by boats nets,
&amp;c. To hunting also, and the rest of their useful
occupations, they will be stimulated; as it will be a part of the
duty of the Superintendent to give them increased facilities for
the disposal of any surplus provisions they may be able to
obtain. Grounds also are to be set apart for them, to which they
are to have free ingress and egress, and no restraint or coercion
will be attempted; while additional protection will be secured to
them, and medical aid in sickness. They will thus, it is hoped,
be gradually trained to make a wise provision for the future. The
rules of the Institution, which seem to be admirably adapted to
the purpose, will be found detailed in the Appendix.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix, No. 7.]</p>
<p>If this friendly and paternal system should answer the design
proposed, it will, no doubt, be followed up by similar
institutions throughout the colony, and thus many important
undertakings of a public nature may ultimately be achieved with
benefit to all parties. The plan, at all events, does great
credit to the benevolence and wisdom of the Governor, and well
deserves to be crowned with success.</p>
<p>A circumstance is related in one of the numbers of the Perth
Gazette just arrived, so highly creditable to two of the Swan
River natives, that no apology can be necessary for inserting it
in the Appendix.** Many extraordinary cases have been related of
the successful tracking of footsteps by savages through a wild
and uncultivated country; but this recent instance exceeds
anything of the kind which the writer remembers to have heard or
read of. The Hottentot corps of riflemen, who are often employed
at the Cape, in tracking the Caffres that have plundered cattle
&amp;c. from the settlers on the frontier, exhibit wonderful
sagacity in this way. They will discover the track or
<i>spur</i>, as it is called, of a man by marks which would
escape the notice of the most observant European. Even the recent
turning of a pebble, or the fracture of a spray, affords them a
clue for continuing their pursuit. This the writer had the
opportunity of knowing, when serving on the Caffrarian frontier.
But however surprising it then appeared to be, the present
instance seems to evince equal, and indeed superior sagacity, on
the part of the Swan River natives, inasmuch as the track of a
child must be more difficult to discover, than that of a bullock
or a man.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Appendix, No. 8.]</p>
<p>The gentleman whose name is mentioned on that occasion as
Superintendent of Police, is the son of General Sir Amos Norcott,
and is singularly well suited for his office, which brings him in
continual contact with the aborigines. He is possessed of energy
and activity, and has acquired a considerable knowledge of their
manners, habits, and language. Mr. Norcott has a great turn for
imitation, and his popularity with the natives may be in part
ascribed to his possession of a talent so conspicuous in
themselves, as well as to his uniform kindness. Such is their
attachment to him, that they are in the habit of shouting out his
name on seeing him at a distance.</p>
<br>
<p>The state of society among the agriculturists themselves is,
in general, of the most friendly description. A kind and cordial
feeling is that which for the most part prevails, and a readiness
to do good offices for each other. Much social intercourse is
kept up, and the laborious occupations of farming are combined
with a refinement of manners and taste, which has surprised and
delighted many who have visited the colony. To the hospitality
which is so generally practised, the writer has already borne
testimony when treating of the Swan River District.</p>
<p>For proof that these statements are not overcharged, the
writer may confidently appeal to a pamphlet on the colony,
written by Lieut. Col. Hanson, Quarter-master-General of the
Madras army, and also to the Journals and Letters of Mr. Moore,
to which reference has already been made. At the dinners of the
Agricultural Society, which occur four times a year, it is usual
for a large party of gentlemen to dine together.</p>
<p>The last occasion is thus described in the "Western Australian
Journal" of November 8, 1834:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The Quarterly Meeting of the Members of the
Agricultural Society took place yesterday at Guildford.<br>
<br>
His Excellency Sir James Stirling, accompanied by Captain
Blackwood of the "Hyacinth," Mr. Taylor of King George's Sound,
and several other gentlemen, after visiting, in the course of the
day, the farms in the neighbourhood of Guildford, and inspecting
the stock brought to the cattle-show, at 4 o'clock joined the
members of the Society, at the Cleikum Inn, where an excellent
dinner was provided, and forty-eight persons sat down to partake
of it.</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<p>To the ladies generally, of the settlement, the weed of praise
is due. Some of them are highly educated as well as most amiable
women. They have not neglected to cultivate and maintain, as
opportunity has occurred, those elegancies and accomplishments in
which they have excelled; and music, especially, forms a most
pleasing part of the evening recreations of several families. The
good sense and intelligence of the sex have been strikingly
displayed in the readiness with which they have borne many
privations, and encountered the difficulties incident to a new
colony. A remarkable example of heroism, for such it really may
be called, occurred some time since, in the instance of an
estimable old lady, the mother of two gentlemen of the name of
Leake, respectable merchants at Fremantle. This lady was induced
by her attachment to her sons, already settled there, and to a
grand-daughter who was coming out, to buffet the waves at seventy
years of age; and is now actively superintending the domestic
arrangements of their hospitable dwelling. The above-named
merchants, as also the Messrs. Samson (gentlemen highly
esteemed), have establishments both there and at Perth.</p>
<p>The town of Perth is particularly favoured in regard to its
social circle, and much friendly intercourse is kept up. To Lady
Stirling, the very amiable wife of the Governor, the colonists
are greatly indebted. The families of the civil officers of
government, and those of some other individuals, contribute to
make this a very agreeable place of residence. "The Perth Gazette
and Western Australian Journal," is published here under the
auspices of the Government, and is ably edited by Mr. Macfaull,
the proprietor. This is a very useful channel of communication,
and circulates much valuable information among the settlers. It
merits, as well by the style and temper in which it is written,
as by the manner in which the mechanical part is conducted, to
take a high rank among our colonial journals.</p>
<p>The town of Guildford may also be named as furnishing
excellent society. The families of Messrs. Tanner, Whitfield,
Walcot, Ridley, Boyd, and Captain Mears (several of them blessed
with amiable and accomplished daughters), add greatly to the
cheerfulness of this neighbourhood. A musical treat may often be
had here, and also at Perth and Fremantle.</p>
<p>At a place called the Peninsula, between Perth and Guildford,
there are located the families of the two Messrs. Hardy, Mr.
Clarkson, and Mr. Drummond, the eminent botanist. Higher up the
Swan River, there are those of Messrs. Brockman, Shaw, and Bull.
Besides these, there are several bachelors located here and
there, some of whom will probably, when they get thoroughly
settled down, be following the excellent example of Mr. Bull,
already quoted. Similar notice might be taken of the friendly
intercourse, and pleasant society to be met with, at the Canning,
York, the Murray, Augusta, and King George's Sound.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>The Colony is highly privileged in its legal institutions,
which afford all the advantages of English law, without the heavy
expense attending it here at home. The only criminal court in the
settlement is the Quarter Sessions, the judges of which are
unpaid magistrates, with the exception of their chairman, who
also presides over the Civil Court, with the title of
Commissioner; and which office, like that of judge in England, is
held during good behaviour. In the Criminal Court the trial is
always by jury, which is likewise the case in the Civil Court,
whenever either of the parties chooses to incur the expense. The
pleadings are oral, and all persons are permitted to practise as
advocates. The fees are very moderate. The present commissioner
is Mr. Mackie, before alluded to, whose first appointment was
that of Advocate-General, or Counsel to the Government; which
situation he held, together with that of Chairman of the Quarter
Sessions, while Mr. Moore presided in the Civil Court; to which,
on its formation, lie had been nominated by the Local Government.
On these appointments, however, being laid before his Majesty's
Government, it was decided that the same functionary should
preside in both courts; and Mr. Mackie, as the senior
law-officer, was made the sole Colonial Judge; the office of
Advocate-General being offered to Mr. Moore, and accepted by that
gentleman. The legal knowledge, professional talent, and equable
temper, which Mr. Moore evinced during the two years and upwards
he presided in the Civil Court, gave the utmost satisfaction to
the colonists, as well as to the Governor.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix, No. 9.]</p>
<p>Into these particulars respecting the free institutions of the
colony the writer has entered thus somewhat minutely, as they
cannot fail to have a material influence upon the state of
society, and greatly contribute to permanent prosperity. How
these advantages are appreciated in the neighbouring penal
settlements, the following extract from a letter in "The
Tasmanian," a Van Diemen's Land journal of recent date,
demonstrates:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The '<i>penal settlement</i>' character of these
colonies is a millstone round their necks, which effectually
prevents their obtaining their rights of <i>free
institutions</i>. Look at Swan River. Depend upon it that, poor
as that colony is, her composition being free from penal
settlementship, she commands infinitely greater attention in
Britain, than does either this, or the great sister colony, with
all its wealth. Thus it is that, while we are here subjected to
the report of the Crown lawyers, whether we shall possess even
the ordinary right of Trial by Jury, the colonists of the Swan
River are in full enjoyment of every privilege of
Englishmen."</blockquote>

to hand. They enable the writer to give the last Report of the
Western Australian Agricultural Society; a document containing
the most gratifying accounts of the progress of the
settlement&mdash;accounts exceeding the expectations of the
writer. From what he knows of the gentlemen who have affixed
their names to the Report, and who have been already referred to,
as among the leading agriculturists in the colony, he has entire
confidence in the accuracy of the information it conveys; while

<br>
<h4>THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS OF THE<br>
AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA.</h4>
<hr class="tenth">
<p class="quote" align="center"><i>To His Excellency Sir James
Stirling, Governor, &amp;c. &amp;c., Patron of the Agricultural
Society of Western Australia</i>.</p>
<blockquote>SIR,&mdash;In laying before your Excellency our third
Agricultural Report for the colony, we cannot but remark, that
though the total amount of live stock in the colony may appear
small, and though a great many farmers have as yet been able to
procure but a very limited supply&mdash;yet, when we reflect,
that only the fifth year of our existence as a community has
passed, and look at the same period of any other colony on
record, it will be found that we stand very far before them in
this respect, as well as in the extent of land in cultivation.
And when we look at the state of importance to which other
colonies have arrived (Sydney, for instance, almost even within
our own knowledge and experience), we think we have reason to
congratulate ourselves.<br>
<br>
From our own observations, we can state that within the last
twelve months, the increase of stock has been very considerable,
the holders having acted more judiciously of late, in withholding
the breeding stock from the butcher, however high the price:
whereas formerly, they thought merely of the present, by killing
ewes &amp;c., whenever the condition of the animal or great
demand for meat gave present profit.<br>
<br>
We believe the number of head of live stock has never before been
taken, to enable us to state with precision what the increase has
been within any given time; but, by as careful a means as could
be adopted, we find the present numbers, and the quantity of land
in cultivation, to be as follows:&mdash;<br>
<br>
Horses, 84; mares, 78; cows, 307; working cattle, 96; bulls and
steers, 97; sheep, 3545; goats, 492; pigs, 374.<br>
<br>
Number of acres in wheat, 564; barley, 100; oats, 116; Kaffre
corn and maize, 29; potatoes, 15; other crops, 94; fallow, 118;
vines half an acre.<br>
<br>
Amongst the horses we must remark, that we have your own
thorough-bred stock, namely, Grey Leg and Chateau Margaux, and
four mares, and your horse Napoleon, the two cart-horses of Mr.
Bull and Mr. J. W. Hardy, and Mr. Peel's Punch. Of cart-mares we
have Mr. Brockman's two, Mr. Bull's one, Mr. Lennard's two, Mr.
Lewis's two, Mr. Phillips's one, Major Nairne's two; also Mr.
Smith's fine half-bred mare.<br>
<br>
Of cows and bulls we possess a good many of the fine English
breeds&mdash;Devon short-horned, Yorkshire, Durham, Alderney,
Ayrshire, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
Of sheep, we have the fine ewes and rams imported from Saxony, by
Mr. M'Dermott, at a great expense, with their descendants; and
the pure Merinos from the flocks of the late Mr. Joshua Trimmer
and others. It is gratifying to know, that the good breeds of the
stock above-mentioned bear such a proportion to the inferior,
that have been, and may be, imported from the neighbouring
colonies, that we have within ourselves the foundation for an
unlimited number of first-rate horses, cattle, and sheep.<br>
<br>
Of wool, the small quantity hitherto exported has been of course
of a very mixed description, and much of it very dirty and badly
packed, from obvious causes. It appears not to have fetched in
the London market more than 2<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. per lb. The
clip of the present season may be rated at about 5884 lbs., and
we are happy to say that a large proportion of it is fine, and
that much more pains have been taken with it than formerly.<br>
<br>
Since making our last Report, explorations that have been made by
individuals have not only confirmed our opinions of the extent of
the pastoral districts in the interior, but have added some not
before known. Added to which, the increased experience of those
settlers on the only located district of this description, more
than confirms the opinions formerly entertained of it for the
breeding of fine-woolled sheep. On this subject, Mr. Bland, one
of the largest flockmasters in the colony, says, "With regard to
the land in this district, my opinion is, that it is as healthy a
sheep-run as can be found; we have resided here with a flock of
sheep for nearly three years, and have not had any disease
amongst them, excepting the foot-rot, which has been brought up
from the Swan. Both sheep and lambs require clipping early in the
spring, to prevent a grass-seed with a barbed point from working
into the skin. We find the grass certainly increase where it has
been most fed off. As to the comparative expense of keeping a
flock here, and on the Swan, I am scarcely able to say, not
having kept one at the latter place myself; but two men can keep
from 700 to 1000, with an extra hand in lambing time, and two or
three at clipping time. I think the country, on the average, will
keep about one sheep to three acres." But as the feed increases
by feeding, a larger proportion may be kept.<br>
<br>
We are sorry to say, that the disease mentioned in our last
report as having proved so serious a drawback to keeping flocks
on the Swan, has not yielded so entirely as we had hoped it was
doing to the medicines employed; nor, with all the care of the
owner and shepherd, has it been kept off so long as the sheep
have remained in those districts of the Swan in which it had
before prevailed. But this has hastened the flockmasters here in
sending them to the Avon, to which river three individuals have
lately removed their sheep, and where there are now no less than
eight flocks. It is the intention of more of the principal
settlers to send their stock over the hills, when the Government
shall have so far improved the road as to enable them to take
over supplies, which, for the present, must be taken from their
farms on the Swan and Canning. It is very gratifying to be able
to state, that of some of the Merino lambs from the Avon, only
six months old, killed at Perth, the carcasses have weighed
upwards of ten pounds a quarter, and this after having been
driven over in two days.<br>
<br>
On the number of acres in wheat showing so small an increase on
that of last year, we would remark, that the great scarcity of
seed prevented more being got in; had it not been for this cause,
we can venture to say, that it would have been <i>very much</i>
greater. Nearly the whole of the land now fallow would have been
in wheat, besides a great deal of new land, had seed been
procurable.<br>
<br>
Kaffre-corn appears to be almost entirely superseding maize, the
former being found not only productive, but answering well on
inferior soils; whereas the latter does not succeed well in this
country without a great deal of manure, except in soils that are
moist in summer.<br>
<br>
During the present season oat-hay has been made, for the first
time, in the colony, and with complete success; the crop being
four or five times as great as that on the natural pastures.<br>
<br>
From the great increase in the number of working bullocks within
the last year or two, we may reasonably calculate on a very
considerable increase in the extent of land under cultivation
next year, if the periodical scarcity which has hitherto usually
visited us be averted, so that we be not obliged to use for food
the wheat intended for seed.<br>
<br>
We deem it right to make one observation on the wheat crop, to
prevent an erroneous opinion being formed as to its
produce,&mdash;that though the quantity sown is considerable, and
is generally looking well, there are many acres that are sown on
inferior land without sufficient tillage, or sown too late, that
cannot be counted on.<br>
<br>
Amongst the plants introduced since our last report, we notice
one of some importance, which is now established; namely, the
<i>hop</i>.<br>
<br>
The white mulberry, of which there are a great number in the
colony, grows most luxuriantly.<br>
<br>
We have now growing in the colony plants of nearly every kind of
European fruit-tree and shrub, all of which appear to thrive
well, as do such of the tropical fruits as have had a fair
trial&mdash;as the date and banana.<br>
<br>
Of figs and vines, the fruit appears to be as good as that grown
in any part of the world. Of the vine, one settler has half an
acre planted. Indeed this, and other fruit-trees and plants, are
becoming very generally cultivated throughout the settlement,
especially the fig, vine, and peach, which here grow to a
certainty from cuttings.<br>
<br>
The olive, although regular plantations have not been made, grows
remarkably fast, and there is one plant at Perth now in
fruit.<br>
<br>
Although garden vegetables cannot be grown in perfection during
every mouth in the year on dry soils, yet in moist ground every
description of vegetables can be grown at any season, and our
supply of them is certainly very superior, with common culture,
to what can be obtained in England, without artificial heat and
the greatest care.<br>
<br>
Of the various kinds of timber-trees and shrubs from Europe,
Africa, &amp;c., that have been tried here, all appear to grow
remarkably well.<br>
<br>
Bees have been landed at King George's Sound since our last
report.<br>
<br>
We are happy to state, that four flour mills are now in
operation, and two others are now in course of erection; also,
that brewing is becoming more general. And notwithstanding the
scarcity of money that continues to be felt, we have ascertained
that upwards of two thousand pounds are ready to be laid out in
the purchase of sheep (including some already sent for), to be
sent to the fine pastures on the Avon and the Hotham.<br>
<br>
It has been ascertained that in upland, two, and in moist soils,
three, crops of potatoes can be produced in the
year.</blockquote>

<br>
<p>A few observations are suggested by this Report. The general
reader's attention is first requested to what is there said of
the quality of the Live Stock already in the colony. After
enumerating the particular breeds of horses, cows, and sheep, the
Report adds, "It is gratifying to know that the good breeds of
the stock above mentioned bear such a proportion to the inferior
that have been, and may be, imported from the neighbouring
colonies, that <i>we have within ourselves the foundation for an
unlimited number of first-rate horses, cattle, and
sheep</i>."</p>
<p>The great importance of this circumstance, as connected with
the future prosperity of the settlement, will be duly appreciated
by those who have visited the Cape.* The colonists there are
possessed of large flocks and herds, but they derive little
profit from them, owing to the inferiority of the breeds, the
nominal value of cattle in the interior being somewhere about
1<i>l</i>. and sheep 2<i>s</i>. a head, for the use of the
butcher; and mares being sold for 5<i>l</i>. The "Fatherland"
breed of cattle there is, however, a fine description of stock;
and during the last twenty years some excellent horses have been
bred, from the first-rate kinds introduced by Lord Charles
Somerset and others. The colonies also seem now alive to the
advantage of displacing their large-tailed sheep by Merinos; but
the foregoing remarks are intended to apply to the general
description of stock to be met with on the farms.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix, No. 10.]</p>
<p>In Van Diemen's Land, also, are large herds of cattle, only of
value for their carcass, and as wild as deer, paying little more
than the cost of catching and driving them to market. The writer,
some years ago, purchased, at a cheap rate, as he then thought,
two cows imported from that colony; but, after being a short time
on his farm, one took to the woods, and was not seen afterwards;
and the other strangled itself in an effort to break loose. The
importance of avoiding these errors, into which the other
colonies of Australia have fallen, at their commencement, will be
appreciated by every practical farmer.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Another very important fact is confirmed by the preceding
Report, viz., <i>the existence of extensive pastoral districts in
the interior</i>. Alluding to one of these, Mr. Bland, a high
authority on such a subject, is quoted as giving his opinion that
it is "as healthy a sheep-run as can be found."</p>
<p>It appears, from the W. A. Journal, that several cargoes of
sheep to the colony were expected, and on the point of being
conveyed thither. The paper of the 18th of December last, states
that Mr. S. G. Henty, a merchant at Fremantle, had freighted the
"Adams" for 600 fine-woolled sheep, having previously made
contracts with some of the settlers to deliver them at that port
at 35<i>s</i>. a head. A subsequent number says,</p>
<p class="dindent">"Mr. Sherwin, of Sydney, we hear, has written
to his correspondent in this colony, intimating his resolution of
visiting us in the 'Australian' freighted with sheep. This
gentleman expects to be able to put on board about 1200. We may
look for his arrival about March next."</p>
<p>In a previous paper it is mentioned that Mr. Taylor, the
master of the Helen, a vessel trading between Sydney and Swan
River, was expected to arrive there from the former port with
stock and sheep on his own account, having purchased a grant in
the York district, where he intended to place them.</p>
<p>Various accounts agree in stating that colonists in New South
Wales are seriously turning their attention to Western Australia,
and that some intend removing thither with their flocks and
herds. One cause of this has been already alluded to, namely, the
difficulty of finding pasture for their rapidly increasing
flocks.</p>
<p>The extracts given from the Sydney Herald, when noticing the
petition from King George's Sound, and which were inserted in the
notes, will be fresh in the mind of the reader. If room allowed,
such extracts might be greatly multiplied. Suffice it to say,
that an increasing feeling of disgust is exhibited at the
consequences a penal settlement inflicts, and that a perpetual
dread exists of brutal outrages being committed, which latter
circumstance alone occasions great uneasiness; but, operating
along with the former, cannot fail to cause many to migrate;
especially whenever the looked-for communication shall be opened
between King George's Sound and Swan River. In the mean time a
proposal has been started in New South Wales so bold and
difficult of accomplishment, and yet related so circumstantially,
that however chimerical the writer must confess it appears to him
to be, yet considering the channel through which it is
communicated, he feels called upon to give it publicity in the
note below. At all events, the suggestion alone, the bare idea of
so arduous a plan being in contemplation, and the mention of so
large a sum offered by the people of Sydney for such an object,
afford additional proofs that a considerable revolution of
opinion respecting Western Australia has taken place there.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The following is an extract from the Western
Australia Journal, of the 27th of last December, and is taken
from an article headed "Overland expedition from Sydney to Swan
River." "A scheme, having for its object the conveyance overland
from Sydney to this colony, of sheep, horses, and cattle, on a
very extensive scale, has been set on foot in the neighbouring
colonies ny Captain Bannister and Mr. Clint, both late residents
in this colony,&mdash;and our Government, we are informed, have
been solicited to extend their aid and countenance to the
enterprize. No pecuniary aid is required; but in consideration of
the magnitude of the undertaking, and the capital risked in the
endeavours to accomplish this desirable object, a recompense is
sought in a grant, in fee simple, of a certain (we believe
moderate) number of acres of land, in proportion to the capital
embarked, and the several persons engaged in the expedition. The
capital is rated at 10,000<i>l</i>., and the persons comprising
the expedition, it is estimated, will amount to about 24." Should
this intelligence prove authentic, the author fully concurs in
the inference drawn from it by the Editor in the following
paragraph: "The proposition, emanating as it does from Captain
Bannister, who was the first to penetrate through our distant
wilds, affords an assurance, were further confirmation required,
to our neighbours and the friends of the colony, that this
country possesses advantages of a high order for the purposes to
which this expedition is directed; and further establishes the
fact of the absence of pasturage on the eastern coast for their
rapidly extending flocks. The flocks and herds of New South
Wales, it now appears, are driven as far as the Morumbidgee river
for pasturage, and are increasing beyond the capabilities of the
country to support. The sheep-owners, it is represented to us,
are constantly and anxiously looking for districts more
advantageously situated."]</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>It is satisfactory to learn from the W. A. Journal, that
almost the whole of the crop of wheat is free from smut and
drake. Taking the quantity of land cropped with grain last year
to have been as stated in the Report, it is probable that it has
not fallen much below a twelvemonth's consumption. To guard,
however, against the recurrence of a scarcity, the Government
will in future retain a <i>corrective</i> supply of flour in the
Commissariat stores, which will be thrown open to the public
whenever the price rises beyond a maximum fixed upon. As the want
of seed alone has limited the aggregate of the harvest to the
amount of acres stated, and the Government has begun to apply the
above expedient, the expectation of the Agricultural Society,
that there will be "<i>a very considerable increase in the extent
of land under cultivation next year</i>," is likely to be
fulfilled. This cannot fail very materially to bring down the
price of bread in the colony. The price of fresh meat also seems
likely to experience a great reduction. The Colonial Journal
computes that about 700 wethers will be brought to market in the
ensuing year, besides an increased number of bullocks, pigs,
poultry, &amp;c. Add to this the fresh importations and
accumulating stock, and in the following year "we may reasonably
calculate," continues that journal, "upon a <i>very
considerable</i> fall in the prices." Though an infant colony
must always be prepared for more or less of fluctuation in the
price of the necessaries of life, yet the causes for uneasiness
on that score, in a country where soil and climate are
propitious, may be expected rapidly to diminish.</p>
<p>No apology can be necessary for introducing the following
extract from a letter, dated Fremantle, Jan. 29, 18351 and
addressed by Mr. James Stokes to Messrs. F. and C. E. Mangles. It
is peculiarly valuable, as being written by a settler, who has
just established himself in the colony as a fellmonger and
woolstapler, &amp;c., and who states that he has had nearly
twelve years experience in the wool trade. He fully corroborates,
as far as lie goes, the preceding statements.</p>
<blockquote>"Having been in this part of the world now seven
months, including great part of the winter and also the summer, I
am convinced of the capabilities of the colony for the growth of
fine wools, also as to the superiority of the climate, soil, and
grasses, &amp;c., for the prevention of diseases and the general
health of sheep. I have visited the farms &amp;c. on the Swan
several times, and was much pleased with the progress made, as
also with the growth of all sorts of fruit, vegetables, corn,
&amp;c. I am now just returned from an excursion into the
interior of the country in the "York District," having been
sixteen miles beyond York with a young man who has settled there
as a sheep farmer. I proceeded on four or five miles more to the
southward; and also, when I returned to York (to remain a few
days, as per invitation, to Messrs. Bland and Trimmer's), I made
a tour to the northward: thus travelling over an extent of near
thirty miles of splendid country, well watered, with an abundance
of grass, and a very superior feed for sheep, or that may be
ploughed without almost any clearing, and very properly described
by some parties in former journals as having more the appearance
of a gentleman's park in England. I was highly gratified with the
country. Messrs. Bland and Trimmer's flocks, and in fact all the
farmers' sheep here, I cannot but speak of in the highest terms;
and Mr. Arthur Trimmer informs me, that it is a very rare
occurrence to lose a sheep, and they are particularly fortunate
in the lambing season.<br>
<br>
All parties now having money to invest, are about doing so in
sheep, as they begin to see that wool will be the staple article
of the country, I think the settlers here may congratulate
themselves when they look back to Sydney in 1806. That settlement
then, after being established about fifteen years, exported "one"
bag of wool, and this colony, next shearing time, will have been
established about six years and a half, when I calculate, with
imports of sheep, and their increase, there will be from "thirty
to forty" bags exported from here, all done by individual
enterprize and private capital, free labour, &amp;c., without
having our "Society" contaminated by "Convicts."</blockquote>

when&mdash;and it is the only way to arrive at a just
conclusion&mdash;"we look," to use the words of the Report, "at
the same period of any other colony on record," the settlers may
justly be proud of the position in which they stand. How
premature and rash have been the opinions to which some writers
stand committed! Where are the proofs of that "failure," of which
the author of the work entitled "England and America" speaks? And
what can be said of the still more extravagant statements
introduced into a very recent work from the pen of Colonel
Napier, that the colony had existed for <span class=
"aa">ten</span> years! and that the Governor had made a
requisition for 600 soldiers! * It is much to be regretted that
the Colonel should have been so easily misled, and have taken
apparently so little trouble to be correctly informed on the
points to which he referred. The military force of the colony has
lately been completed to 150 men; and the writer does not believe
that any further increase has been contemplated or applied for by
the Local Government, though that amount is certainly as small as
is compatible with the wants of the colony.</p>

Mercury&mdash;Interest excited at Calcutta and
Madras&mdash;Rearing of Horses for the India Market&mdash;Remount
of British Cavalry at Madras, procured from Sydney&mdash;Position
of Swan River&mdash;Its superior Advantages for that traffic.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="aa">Some</span> slight reference has already been
made to India, and to the favourable circumstances under which
the voyage to and fro, between that part of our dominions and
Swan River, may be performed. The following additional
particulars will be interesting to those who have friends and
relations in the East Indies.</p>
<p>In 1833, a company was formed at Calcutta for the purpose of
trading with and settling in Western Australia. Among those
principally concerned in establishing the company were, J.
Pattle, Esq., of the Civil Service, and Colonel Becher. In the
same year the bark Mercury was dispatched to King George's Sound
on that undertaking, having on board Captain C. Cowles, H. C. M.,
and J. Calder (late of the firm of Mackintosh and Co.), W.
Raynoe, G. Pattle, S. Beadle, jun., Esqrs., Messrs. T. Nisbett,
S. Austen, two European officers, one carpenter, and seventy
natives of India. This unfortunate bark was never after heard of,
and being an old vessel, is supposed to have foundered at sea, as
H. M. S. Hyacinth, dispatched in the subsequent year in search of
her by Admiral Sir John Gore, could find no trace of the wreck.
The gentlemen on board were preceding others interested in the
adventure, in order to prepare the way, by selecting the most
eligible sites for their future operations. Ten overseers, with
five mechanics attached to each, and engaged for five years, were
said to be on board, for the purpose of erecting buildings on the
respective allotments of the members of the company; and while
these improvements were carrying on, the vessel was to return to
India for the families of the shareholders. The colony was meant
to be the permanent residence of their families, but the
gentlemen were to remain only during the summer months. It
appears that the company intended having two or three trading
vessels, to keep up a regular communication, and also one for
whaling during the season. Messrs. J. Pattle and C. and G.
Becher, in their petition to the Admiral for search to be made
for the Mercury, state, that she sailed in October for Western
Australia, "provided with an extensive establishment of men and
means, for the purpose of obtaining land, and ultimately
effecting colonization at that interesting settlement;" and they
go on to say that, as the average passage from Calcutta to King
George's Sound was a month, and the Mercury had not reached the
colony in March 1834, they feared she had been wrecked on the
Keeling or Coco Islands. While the writer deeply sympathizes with
the relatives and friends of the unfortunate sufferers, he is
happy to find that a strong attachment to the colony, "England's
youngest child," is still maintained at Calcutta, and that
Messrs. Pattle and Mangles, of the Civil Service, Colonels Becher
and Frith, and Captain Lowes, were, according to the latest
accounts, distinguished for the deep interest they were taking in
its welfare. A letter of the 4th of November, from Mr. Mangles,
mentions that one of the greatest sufferers by the loss of the
Mercury has since been most active in promoting schemes having
for their object the formation of another company, and the
keeping up of a constant communication with the colony; "he
desires," says Mr. M., "to get up a joint-stock company, 100
shares of 1500 rupees each, and I dare say it will fill. I will
let you know hereafter how this matter progresses. I hope to see
regular packets for passengers established." A letter from
Calcutta, dated January last, states that a passenger-ship for
Swan River and Van Diemen's Land was to sail early in that month;
so that the proposed communication appears to have fairly
commenced.</p>
<p>In Colonel Hanson, already alluded to, the colony possesses,
at Madras, a zealous and influential advocate. When he visited
Western Australia in 1831, the prejudice against it in public
opinion was at its height; but he soon perceived that this
prejudice had no foundation, and that, with reference to India,
the colony was likely to prove an object of very peculiar
interest. It had long been a desideratum with the officers of the
various branches of the East India Company's Service to find a
country, where, on retiring, they might have a climate that would
renovate their impaired constitutions, and yet prove congenial to
their acquired feelings, so long habituated to the intense heat
of a tropical sun. In these particulars, speaking generally, the
climate of England does not suit them. If it restores the
constitutions of some, with many it does not agree, from the
humidity of the atmosphere; while the cold and long-continued
rains are agreeable to few, if any of them. The Colonel found
that Western Australia answered the desired description. He came
to it an invalid, and left it in rude health; while its climate,
of which he had trial in the hottest season, was delightful to
his feelings. But besides a healthy and pleasant climate, the
servants of the Company are anxious to enjoy society resembling
that which they have left behind them, or look forward to mix
with, in England. On this head, Colonel Hanson, in his pamphlet,
bears a most favourable testimony to the colony, where he found
various families, including near relations of both sexes of his
friends at Madras and in England, no way their inferiors in
refinement of taste and suavity of manners. Recent accounts from
Madras state that the Colonel had left that Presidency for King
George's Sound, where he has a small grant, intending to reside
there for a couple of years while on leave of absence.</p>
<p>The Calcutta Company, in selecting Western Australia as their
place of abode or retirement, appear also to have had in view its
eligibility as a place of residence for their families when in
ill health, or for the education of the children of such members
as continued to fill situations in India. Perhaps the most
painful circumstance connected with the India Service is the
separation of families. How many ladies are obliged to tear
themselves from their husbands, either on account of their own
ill health, or that of their children, on whose tender frames the
deleterious climate soon begins to operate! These separations are
often prolonged for years, and the same causes have obliged many
a delicate female to make the long voyage a second time home and
to India without any relation to protect her. Another frequent
cause of separation is the anxiety to obtain for their children a
suitable education. In Dr. Milligan's Report on the climate * the
following passage occurs:&mdash;"The favourable opinion I have
already expressed of the influence of this climate on European
constitutions, and of the place as a residence for invalids from
India, is strengthened by a further experience of two years." The
Doctor goes on to show that the climate is peculiarly suited to
the female sex, and "children," he adds, "thrive remarkably
well."</p>
<p class="foot">[* Appendix, No. 3.]</p>
<p>With reference to education, the writer has heard of one
family, including several females, who proceeded last year to the
colony, with the view of devoting themselves to that object; and
one or two estimable persons were so occupied when he left
it.</p>
<p>The connexion of the colony with India will also be greatly
promoted by a traffic in horses, when the colonists have had time
to raise them in sufficient numbers to make the exportation of
them an object. The native horses of India are not considered
powerful enough for the mounting of our dragoons. When at the
Mauritius in November 1833, the writer met Captain Collins of H.
M. 13th Light Dragoons, and learned from him that he was
proceeding to Sydney, to procure a remount of several hundred
horses for the British cavalry at Madras, having contracted with
the Government to receive for each, after they were landed and
approved of there, the sum of 54<i>l</i>. or 55<i>l</i>., the
writer forgets which. Capt. Collins mentioned that the number of
horses likely to be wanted in subsequent years would be much
greater, and expressed his intention of visiting King George's
Sound,** with a view to the future establishment of a breeding
stud there, being sensible that a considerable saving would thus
accrue, as the expense and risk at present incurred in importing
them from the Eastern coast are very great.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Now that the harbours in the vicinity of Swan
River are well ascertained, and have been found to afford safe
entrance and anchorage, they are likely to be resorted to in
preference to King George's Sound for the above purpose; as it is
of importance that vessels that have live stock on board, should
not have to double Cape Leeuwin.]</p>
<p>On reference to a preceding part of this pamphlet *** it will
be found that during the winter season in the southern
hemisphere, a vessel may easily accomplish the voyage from Swan
River to Madras in three weeks, and have fine weather the whole
way; but the passage to India from the penal settlements at the
same season would require at least twice that time, as the voyage
would be along the East coast and through Torres Straits.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** See page 20.]</p>
<p>It is needless to dwell on the peculiar advantages Swan River
would afford to the capitalist who embarked in the speculation of
raising horses for the India market, where 150<i>l</i>. is no
unusual price for a good riding horse. Powerful carriage horses
are also in great request there.&mdash;The latest accounts from
the colony mention that it had been proposed to form a company,
having for its object the purchase of Sir James Stirling's fine
stud of eight thoroughbred horses, lately arrived, and which are
mostly, if not entirely, from Lord Egremont's stud. The
suggestion seems to have arisen from an apprehension that part of
the stud was about to be sent to another colony, and a strong
desire to retain so valuable an acquisition.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<br>
<p class="negindent2">Colonization&mdash;Colonel Napier and the
"Self-supporting Principle"&mdash;Mistaken Policy pointed
out&mdash;Article on Colonization in Archbishop Whately's
Work.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="aa">Having</span> now completed the view the
writer had designed to take of the "State and Position of Western
Australia," and brought down the information respecting it to the
period of the latest arrivals, there remain a few points closely
connected with the general principles of Colonial Legislation and
Government, which he is desirous very briefly to notice. And
first, though he has felt it incumbent upon him to notice certain
errors into which Colonel Napier has inadvertently fallen
respecting Western Australia, still he feels called upon to do
justice to the validity of the reasons on which that officer has
declined "the government of the South Australian colony, without
troops, and the power to draw upon the British Government for
money, in case of need."</p>
<p class="dindent">"My demand," says the Colonel, "for soldiers
and money is <i>not</i> at variance with the 'self-supporting
principle of the new colony:' the expression 'self-supporting
principle' is as pretty a little philosophical expression as may
be; but reflection will show the commissioners that it is not
strictly applicable in the present case; for that the very
existence of the colony, as we see by the Act of Parliament,
depends upon a <i>loan</i> of 200,000<i>l</i>. from the good
folks in England; that is to say, upon <i>extraneous</i> support:
what then becomes of the '<i>self-supporting principle</i>?' The
Commissioners must mean '<i>loan-supporting principle</i>,' and
the word 'self' was an accidental slip of the pen? And how is my
demand at variance with this loan-supporting system? In case the
loan of 200,000<i>l</i>. should not prove sufficient to establish
the colony, to pay its own interest, and to defray the cost of
Government, till the state of the colony produces a revenue equal
to all this expense, I demanded to have a pledge from the British
Government, that it would supply the deficiency, and enable me to
protect the colony, which might otherwise be destroyed by the
miscalculation of people in London, on whose correctness
<i>alone</i> I do not think it safe to hang the destinies of some
thousands of people: therefore, my demand was that, <i>in case of
need</i>, the British Government should advance the loan, instead
of private people. How, in the name of common sense, this is at
variance with the 'loan-supporting principle' I cannot imagine,
and must leave the Commissioners to explain.<br>
<br>
"As to the troops, I recommend sending out 200 British soldiers,
because they would be by far the cheapest force that can be
employed. Some force <i>must</i> be employed, and, besides being
the most effectual force, English soldiers would <i>save</i>
expense, both to the mother-country, and the colony. If the
Commissioners abandon the <i>really</i> 'self-supporting' system
of <i>economy</i>, they will soon see the result."</p>
<p>The writer trusts that the remarks into which he may be drawn
by having had his attention turned to the work just quoted for
the purpose of correcting the errors lately adverted to, will be
taken in good part. Attached, as he is ready to acknowledge
himself, to the colony of Western Australia, he is conscious of
no feelings of hostility to the sister settlement, which it is
indeed his cordial wish to serve, rather than to injure, by
warning its Directors of those rocks and quicksands upon which he
fears they may be running their vessel.&mdash;If they persist in
their endeavour to found and establish their intended settlement
without the aid of a military force, not only to protect the
settlers from the aborigines, but to assist in keeping order
among the colonists themselves, and to ensure obedience to the
laws, they will, he feels assured, be only eventually serving the
settlement of Western Australia. His experience and observation
of what settlers ordinarily can accomplish in an infant colony,
and his conviction that few in any hundred of them possess all
the requisites necessary for very speedily mastering the
difficulties they have to encounter, induce him to caution the
projectors against the line of policy which they propose to
adopt, in attempting to dispense with public money, and
especially with troops.</p>
<p>As to any jealousy of the sister colony influencing the mind
of the writer, he utterly disclaims it. It may be as well, in
confirmation of this, to state, that in his opinion, the
situation, the geographical position alone, of Western Australia,
gives it a great and permanent advantage. That in addition to
this, it is no trifling point in favour of the latter, that it
has the start of the new settlement, and that many who leave
Great Britain to go to South Australia, impatient of the total
absence of the comforts they leave behind them, will be likely to
transfer themselves and their capital to the colony which has
passed through the initiatory stage. These reasons alone are
sufficient in the writer's opinion to prove that the capital, and
the energies which the friends of the South Australian project
may be able to call forth, will, under any circumstances, benefit
the settlement of Western Australia. But, if to these causes,
which nothing can keep from operating in a greater or less degree
in the direction described, a third be superadded&mdash;if the
ordinary precautions for the security of the settlers are to be
dispensed with, and they are to be constantly liable to be called
off from their proper pursuits, to defend themselves and the
infant settlement&mdash;it requires no gift of prophecy to
predict, that the result will be, a rapid and general migration,
as opportunity and means may offer, to other colonies; and that
as Western Australia is near at hand, and in the full enjoyment
of free institutions, it cannot but largely participate in the
benefits that must result from the failure of so improvident an
attempt as that in which Colonel Napier has declined risking his
reputation.</p>
<p>The daily employment of settlers in a new colony demands and
engrosses their attention to a degree that people at home, who
have always been used to a long-established and completely
organized state of society, are but little prepared to conceive.
The occupations of such persons being pastoral as well as
agricultural, lead to their distribution over a considerable
extent of country. A colony also like the one proposed, though
happily not intended as a penal settlement, will have its ports
open to all who have the means and inclination to find their way
thither; and granting that it could commence with a greater
proportion of settlers of character and intelligence than ever
yet found their way to the shores of a colony&mdash;still the
stream of emigration will bear along with it many who have not
the qualities that render them desirable to a new settlement, and
who soon evince they need the restraint of a strong and efficient
executive.</p>
<p>Again, many who are good and well-conducted members of an old
community in which they have been brought up, are greatly
indebted, for the character they possess, to those restraints
which it has wisely, and from long experience, provided. The
entire change of habits, and the wider range which a new
settlement involves, not to mention the contact and neighbourhood
of tribes in the lowest state of barbarism, have more or less a
relaxing tendency as regards the moral texture of such minds;
and, if the laws of the colony into which they are transplanted
are not strictly maintained, but, on the contrary, impose little
or no restraint, society must of course deteriorate, and the
entire community ultimately suffer. It is indeed a truism, but
one involving grave considerations, that it is much easier to
prevent the disorganization of a community, than to reunite and
restore it when once it has been suffered to lapse into disorder
and demoralization.</p>
<p>It is also of the utmost importance to bear in mind, that a
colonial Government that cannot secure, in ordinary cases,
protection to the settlers and their property, must operate most
injuriously and cruelly upon the aborigines themselves. These
encompass them on every side&mdash;they cannot help doing so.
Each tribe has its recognised boundaries and landmarks. If but
one is disturbed, it experiences a difficulty in falling back,
and retiring upon the tribes in its rear, who are similarly
situated in their turn. They continue, therefore, to hover about
their ancient grounds, and depend for their subsistence upon
them. The more incompetent the colonial establishments to keep
order in the colony and prevent depredation, the more liable will
be the dispersed settlers to take the law into their own hands;
or rather, to make law for-themselves, and unreservedly to
execute such law as they think fit, or as passion or caprice may
dictate, in every case in which the natives may be involved.
<i>The mere feeling of insecurity has this tendency</i>; and the
result of such a state of things would be the gradual
extermination of the natives, while the sanguinary and lawless
spirit engendered and encouraged, would re-act, and be productive
of frightful consequences to the settlers themselves, continuing
to pervade the community long after the aborigines had ceased to
be objects of terror.</p>
<p>The writer has ventured thus freely, and at greater length
than he had intended, to express his opinion, from the deep
conviction he entertains that a serious error in colonial policy
is about to be committed, which may still be corrected before any
mischievous consequences ensue.* In the mean time he
congratulates the colonists of Western Australia, that no such
visionary experiment is operating there.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The following is an extract from Colonel
Napier's review of the letter he received in reply to his demand
for money and troops, from the South Australian Commissioners,
and which letter bears date May 22, 1835:&mdash;</p>
<p class="dindent" style="font-size:90%;">Paragraph 4. "'The most
flourishing British colonies in North America were founded
without pecuniary aid from the mother-country, and without the
aid of military force, though planted in the immediate
neighbourhood of warlike Indian nations.'"&mdash;<i>See the
Commissioners' Letter</i>.</p>
<p class="foot">On this sentence the Colonel makes the following
"<i>Observation</i>:"&mdash;"I have only to refer to any history
of the British colonies in North America, to contradict the
assertion contained in this paragraph. By such reference the
Commissioners will see that, for <i>many years</i>, these infant
colonies struggled with the <i>greatest hardships</i>, and that
some were <i>entirely destroyed</i>! When Pennsylvania, which
suffered the least, was granted to Penn in 1682, the country had
been previously occupied for above fifty years: it had numerous
settlers, and was not a desert. Besides, he went with Quakers. If
all the colonists going to Australia were Quakers, and that I was
William Penn, neither would I ask for troops! But what was the
consequence of the peaceful government established by that great
man? It was this, that in 1764 a body of Presbyterians chose, in
their zeal against '<i>the heathen</i>,' to massacre a whole
tribe of harmless Indians; and '<i>the weakness of the
Government</i>,' says Robert Proud, the historian of
Pennsylvania, '<i>was not able to punish these murderers, nor to
chastise the insurgents</i>.' For my own part, I have no ambition
to be at the head of such a milk-and-water colonial government,
and, while fancying myself a <i>governor</i>, discover that I was
only a <i>football!</i> But we find the great Penn himself
complaining that it was <i>controversy</i>, not
<i>government</i>,' in Pennsylvania. Let us then put Penn and his
Quakers out of our heads.<br>
<br>
"All other settlements were retarded in their progress by wars.
The want of regular soldiers obliged the settlers to arm, instead
of attending lo their peaceful avocations. Dr. Trumbull, in his
History of Connecticut, says,<br>
<br>
'<i>These infant settlements were surrounded by savages</i>.' (So
the Australian colony will be.) <i>They conceived themselves in
danger when they went out and when they came in; every man was a
soldier, which produced war, and of course injury to the
colonies</i>.' Thus it appears that, contrary to the assertion in
the Commissioners' letter, there <i>was</i> 'a military force;'
and, had it been of a proper description, the colonies would not
have suffered injury.<br>
<br>
"In 1606 King James formed a colony in America, '<i>under the
superintendence of a council in England, composed of few persons
of consideration and talents</i>.' King James made many blunders
during his reign, and this seems to have been one of them! These
Councillors directed the colony in Virginia. For near twenty
years, under their superintendence, the colony suffered all kinds
of misery, and was '<i>a prey to folly, crime, riot, and
insubordination</i>.' During that time '<i>one hundred and fifty
thousand pounds and nine thousand people had been sent from
England</i>;' and when these Commissioners (whose power it was at
last deemed necessary to abolish, and who thought they could
govern across the Atlantic) were upset, there remained but
<i>eighteen hundred</i> miserable colonists in Virginia! And
moreover, the famous Captain Smith, a man of extraordinary
courage and talents, governed this colony for a time, and by his
great abilities prevented its total ruin. Once these wild
colonists expelled him, and afterwards, <i>when danger
pressed</i>, elected him President! Another colony, planted near
Cape Hatteras, disappeared altogether, and was never heard of
more! Twenty-one years are now past since I landed, at the head
of 900 British troops, on this very spot, near Cape Hatteras;
and, from the nature of that coast, I can easily imagine that a
colony might be there surprised and totally destroyed, either by
enemies or sickness. Some of the Australian Commissioners were,
probably, then at school, so I may take the liberty, appertaining
to grey hairs, and tell them that colonies, like camps, are
exposed to many dangers, and, among others, those of <i>site</i>,
which gentlemen, living always in London, are not exactly the
people most fitted either to estimate or provide
against."&mdash;p. xx&mdash;xxiii.]<br></p>
<p>Whenever that colony shall have arrived at the point at which
it can be fairly considered capable of providing for its own
establishments, no principle can be more equitable than that it
should be called upon to do so; but, till then, if the colony is
to be suitably maintained as a part of the British dominions, it
is essential that the mother country continue to extend her
aid.</p>
<p>But hastening from these questions, the writer cannot let this
opportunity pass without expressing the gratification he has
experienced while considering the grand and statesman-like
principles propounded in an article which forms No. III. of the
Appendix to Archbishop Whately's "Thoughts on Secondary
Punishments," and which consists of "Suggestions for the
Improvement of our System of Colonization," written by a friend
of that Prelate. After noticing the instruction to be derived
from the ancients, with respect to the settlement and growth of
colonies, and contrasting their success with that of modern
European States, the writer thus continues:&mdash;</p>
<p class="dindent">"The main cause of this difference may be
stated in a few words. We send out colonies of the limbs, without
the belly and head;&mdash;of needy persons, many of them mere
paupers, or even criminals; colonies made up of <i>a single
class</i> of persons in the community, and that the most
helpless, and the most unfit to perpetuate our national
character, and to become the fathers of a race whose habits of
thinking and feeling shall correspond to those which, in the mean
time, we are cherishing at home. The ancients, on the contrary,
sent out a <i>representation of the parent state&mdash;colonists
from all ranks</i>. We stock the farm with creeping and climbing
plants, without any trees of firmer growth for them to entwine
round. A hop-ground left without poles, the plants matted
confusedly together, and scrambling on the ground in tangled
heaps, with here and there some clinging to rank thistles and
hemlocks, would be an apt emblem of a modern colony. They began
by nominating to the honourable office of captain or leader of
the colony one of the chief men, if not the chief man of the
state,&mdash;like the queen bee leading the workers. Monarchies
provided a prince of the blood royal; an aristocracy its choicest
nobleman; a democracy its most influential citizen. These
naturally carried along with them some of their own station in
life&mdash;their companions and friends; some of their immediate
dependants also&mdash;of those between themselves and the lowest
class; and were encouraged in various ways to do so. The lowest
class again followed with alacrity, because they found themselves
moving <i>with</i>, and not <i>away from</i>, the state of
society in which they had been living. It was the same social and
political union under which they had been born and bred; and to
prevent any contrary impression being made, the utmost solemnity
was observed in transferring the rites of Pagan superstition.
They carried with them their gods&mdash;their
festivals&mdash;their games; all, in short, that held together,
and kept entire the fabric of society as it existed in the parent
state. Nothing was left behind that could be moved,&mdash;of all
that the heart or eye of an exile misses. The new colony was made
to appear as if time or chance had reduced the whole community to
smaller dimensions, leaving it still essentially the same home
and country to its surviving members. It consisted of a general
contribution of members from all classes, and so became, on its
first settlement, a mature state, with all the component parts of
that which sent it forth. It was a transfer of population,
therefore, which gave rise to no sense of degradation, as if the
colonist were thrust out from a higher to a lower description of
community."&mdash;p. 190-2.</p>
<p>The foregoing writer not only contrasts this with all that
happens in a modern colony, but particularly traces its results
in the United States of America, where, he says, whatever
admixture they had of the higher ranks of the British community,
"the advantage, such as it was, was accidental," and formed "no
part of the legislative project." He adds,&mdash;"our later
colonists have not had even this security and ill-administered
aid;" and, after remarking that "honour, rank, and power, are
less ruinous bribes than money, and yet more to the purpose,
inasmuch as they influence more generous minds," he maintains
that if some half dozen gentlemen of influence and competent
fortune were thus tempted out, their united influence would draw
after them numbers of respectable emigrants, including many a
clergyman, "whose acquirements would give him weight with the
better sort, and whose character and talents would, at the same
time, answer for the particular situation in which he would be
placed."</p>
<p class="dindent">"Such a colony," says he, "will be united to
us by ties to which one of a different constitution must be a
stranger. It will have received from us, and will always trace to
us, all its social ingredients. Its highest class will be
ours&mdash;its gentry ours&mdash;its clergy ours&mdash;its lower
and its lowest ranks all ours; all corresponding and congenial to
our manners, institutions, and even our prejudices. Instead of
grudgingly casting our morsels to a miserable dependant, we shall
have sent forth a child worthy of its parent, and capable of
maintaining itself."&mdash;p. 199.</p>
<p>An apology is due to the writer of the splendid article from
which the above extracts are taken, for the very imperfect
attempt at analysis which has been made. The whole paper is well
worthy the consideration of the public and the legislature; and
it is to be hoped that the "detailed scheme," to which that
article is announced as only prefatory, will be speedily
forthcoming.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<br>
<p align="center">A FEW CONCLUDING HINTS TO EMIGRANTS.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="aa">Before</span> the writer takes his final
leave, he would venture to throw out a few suggestions on the
subject of Emigration. Conscious of the responsibility he incurs
in putting forth statements which may lead individuals to take a
step of so much importance to themselves and their families, as
the selection of a distant colony for their future abode, he
would strongly urge upon them to examine well the prospects which
they are leaving at home, and not to act precipitately. They have
to reflect whether&mdash;be a colony ever so inviting&mdash;it is
worth <i>their</i> while to abandon old connexions and
well-established institutions. They have also to consider
whether, favourable as the opening may really be, they are the
kind of persons for whom it is likely to answer. A mistake on
either of these points may be ruinous to their ultimate peace and
happiness. In the "Letters and Journals" of Mr. Moore, to which
reference has already more than once been made, there is a
passage bearing on this point, that well deserves
consideration.</p>
<p class="dindent">"As to coming out, I am still reluctant in
giving advice to any one on the subject. It is a serious
responsibility to hold out strong inducements, when success
depends so much upon the taste, bodily fitness, and preparation
for it. To come here costs much; a considerable sum is also
further necessary to support you until you can maintain yourself.
Land must be paid for&mdash;if obtained from Government, at the
rate of 5<i>s</i>. per acre.". . . . "Two or three stout
hard-working brothers, or a father with a grown-up family able
and willing to assist him, with some money to establish
themselves in rough comfort and plenty, would be independent in a
few years; but there must be no squeamishness as to food, nor
daintiness as to luxuries; it is a <i>plodding, matter-of-fact,
business-like and hard-working life</i>, until you get yourself
established; with very little of that romance and adventure about
it, which is so tempting and alluring to young minds. Yet it has
its pleasures; but it is quite right that people should prepare
themselves for what it really is. I am still unwilling to
recommend emigration to any one; for the sort of life is so
different from that at home, that many would be discontented with
it, and blame the adviser instead of themselves. I had made up my
mind to endure every kind of hardship and privation for three
years at least; yet here, at the end of two years (Oct. 1833), I
live almost as well as I could wish, and certainly lead a
healthier, and happier, and less anxious life,* now that the
first struggle is over."</p>
<p class="foot">[* In this last sentence there appears to be some
obscurity. From conversations the author has bad with Mr. Moore
on the subject, he has no doubt that the comparison intended to
be instituted was between the life Mr. Moore was then passing as
a settler, and that which he had led before he went out to the
colony.]</p>
<p>The writer, after carefully reviewing what has been stated in
the preceding pages respecting the colony of Western Australia,
is satisfied that he has not put forth exaggerated statements,
but has given, to the best of his ability, a fair and impartial
account of the actual state of things. While, on the one hand, he
has felt called upon to notice incorrect reports that have been
published, to the prejudice of the colony, he has, on the other,
studiously rejected exaggerated or erroneous accounts that have
been circulated in its favour.</p>
<p>Those who may be about to emigrate cannot be too often
reminded that <i>judgment, perseverance</i>, and
<i>fortitude</i>, are as essential to their success as good
climate and soil, and moderate means. It is true that the colony
having attained to its present position, much of the difficulty
of the enterprize is removed, and many may now prosper who would
not have done so originally; but without some portion of those
valuable qualities above specified, the emigrant, under the most
favourable circumstances, ought not to expect success.</p>
<p>A colonist, at Swan River, who had seen a great deal of
vicissitude, in a recent letter to a friend in England writes
thus:&mdash;"We have laid the foundation for all new comers to
build on: we have purchased dear-bought
experience&mdash;knowledge to guide all who may feel a wish for
enterprize. Were it in our power to recal the time that is past,
and were we <i>now to come</i> here, with about 100<i>l</i>. in
cash, together with a few of the many useful things we brought
out, we should be certain of prosperity."</p>
<p>The emigrant who has abundant pecuniary resources to draw
upon, will still find his advantage in beginning on a moderate
scale, and in always keeping a considerable portion of capital in
hand, till he can thoroughly judge of the calls there may be upon
him. The neglect of this caution has given rise to much
difficulty and embarrassment, even where the original means of
the settler have been large. The sphere of his operations can
easily be extended afterwards.</p>
<p>If a capitalist, such as is here contemplated, intend to make
the breeding of sheep his principal pursuit, he will do well to
take out with him a couple of shepherds, half-a-dozen Saxon or
Spanish rams, and a few dogs, in the first instance; and to
contract with respectable parties in Van Diemen's Land or Sydney,
for the landing of ewes at Swan River. Each of those places has
its peculiar advantages. At Sydney the wools are finer; while the
distance in the other case is less, and the reduction of freight
in proportion. At both places Merino sheep abound. As the
capitalist would probably stop at the Cape, he might make
arrangements for taking on board some of the Father-land breed of
cattle, which is deservedly esteemed. The writer has had cows of
this kind which were considered equal to the Durham and
Devonshire breeds.</p>
<p>In choosing sites for building, care should be taken to
provide against those occasional floods from which the settlement
is not exempt, though several years sometimes may elapse before
they recur. The early Swan-River settlers were fortunate in
following a season of this kind, which put them on their guard.
Another evil, however, against which some of them have not
sufficiently provided, and in consequence have suffered very
severely, is <i>fire</i>. It is of great importance in a country
where, at times, trees and vegetation are greatly dried up with
sun and heat, to keep the space around a dwelling clear and open.
The <i>thatched</i> roof is rather objectionable for a similar
reason, though in many situations it may at first be in some
measure necessary. The accumulation of farming produce, corn and
hay ricks, &amp;c., at a particular spot, should also be avoided,
as attended with danger.</p>
<p>In reply to a question that has frequently been put to the
writer, as to how much it would be necessary for a person to take
out with him to commence as an agriculturist or sheep farmer, on
a moderate scale, his answer has been from 800<i>l</i>. to
1000<i>l</i>.; and after canvassing the subject of late with
different individuals, who have been for several years in the
colony, some agreeing with him, and others rating the requisite
sum much higher, the writer would still adhere to that opinion;
but the emigrant, to succeed with this sum, must begin at first
in a careful way, and determine to put his <i>own</i> shoulder to
the wheel, and consent to work with his own men, as well as to
direct their labours. A fourth or fifth of the means of such a
settler might be invested in articles that would sell well in the
colony; as salt-pork, butter, American flour in casks (if cheap),
some strong shoes and leather, hops, porter, &amp;c. He should
take for his own use wearing apparel for one or two years,
calculating upon eight summer months and four winter months, and
strong shoes for two or three years, with a good stock of
flannel, and some mattresses;&mdash;also a plough, a small cart,
a pair of harrows, and a few spades and shovels, some plain
carpenter's tools, axes; &amp;c., and spare handles. If the
emigrant last described intends to be a sheep-farmer, he should
take out two or three Merino rams, and some sheep-dogs.</p>
<p>With respect to servants, the emigrant should have two men
understanding arable and sheep farming, or what would be better,
a married man, with one or two sons above the age of ten. Much of
his comfort and success will depend on his servants; the settler
therefore cannot be too scrupulous in his inquiry into their
character for integrity, and fidelity to the masters with whom
they have lived. It will be for the ultimate benefit, as well as
comfort, of the emigrant that the terms of agreement he makes
with his people be liberal; so that, on reaching the colony, they
should not be excited to discontent by any great disproportion
between their wages and the current rate in the colony. Letters
from the settlement, addressed to the writer, and that come down
to the 26th of January last, state, "there is no cause to
complain of the now current price of agricultural labour; very
good hands can be procured at 30<i>s</i>. per month." In addition
to this, are the servants' rations, which hitherto have cost more
than the wages, but they may now be calculated at less. The
entire cost of a <i>shepherd</i> has been from 60<i>l</i>. to
70<i>l</i>., owing to servants of this class, especially good
ones, being scarce. The expense of taking out servants is about
20<i>l</i>. each, and children one-third or one-half of that
amount, according to their ages. The writer would not advise that
the indenture should be for a longer period than three or at most
four years, after which the servant would be at liberty to leave
his master, or enter into a new agreement with him. In suggesting
liberality in agreements entered into with servants, as good
policy on the part of the emigrant, the writer would at the same
time have it prospective, in order that every inducement should
be held out to good conduct and fidelity. With this view the
wages should be somewhat low for the first year, and increase
step by step each succeeding year. The writer would recommend
there being inserted in the indenture a clause to the effect that
if, on completion of the period named therein, the servant has
fulfilled his engagement to the satisfaction of his employer, the
former should become entitled to a bonus of from thirty to fifty
acres of good land. Should the servant choose then to retire on
his land, the master would thus secure in him a valuable
neighbour, to assist in harvest and at other seasons of need.</p>
<p>The mode of paying shepherds adopted on the borders of
Scotland is deserving of imitation. Having lately been trying in
that quarter to get men of character to send out this season to
his farm in the colony, the writer has learned that shepherds in
Selkirkshire receive for wages in lieu of money the product of a
certain number of sheep. The average wages for the last two years
there are calculated at from 28<i>l</i>. to 30<i>l</i>. for the
best hands; while for the nine years preceding, they have been
but from 18<i>l</i>. to 20<i>l</i>. Married shepherds, besides
the product of the sheep, have a cow's grass worth 6<i>l</i>., a
free house and garden in value 5<i>l</i>. or 6<i>l</i>., and
oatmeal to the extent of 5<i>l</i>. more. By the mode of payment
adopted on the borders, the vigilant superintendence of the
shepherd is in a great measure secured, by his interests being
combined with those of his employer.</p>
<p>The emigrant should resolutely avoid engaging to supply his
servants with rations of spirits; a practice which has been
productive of very baneful results in the demoralization of
servants, while it inflicts a heavy tax on the master. Good
colonial beer would form an excellent substitute, and it might be
a stipulation in the indenture that the servant should be
supplied with it whenever there was any ready means of obtaining
it; but the settler, after the second year, ought to brew for his
own establishment.</p>
<p>For the first two years the emigrant should be satisfied to
live in such a cottage as he could erect with the aid of his own
people&mdash;one of a description similar to that mentioned in
pp. 52 and 53. This he will find a sufficiently comfortable
dwelling both in summer and winter. The cottage should be
contiguous to the best site the land affords for a permanent
residence, so that it might serve for a kitchen and servants'
apartments when the farm-house was completed; but the prudent
settler will not undertake this latter work till he is enabled to
do it out of the profits of his farm, whether pastoral or
agricultural; and then it should be a good substantial building
of stone or brick. It need not then, be expensive, as the settler
could in the intermediate time be procuring the materials, either
by the labour of his people, or by barter from his neighbours. If
the means of the emigrant are ample enough to render it
unnecessary for him to put his own hand to the work, the writer
would still advise him to take part with his people in active
labour, as well as to plan and superintend. This will prevent
time hanging heavy on his hands, as he will soon become
interested in the simplest operations, and the want of society
will then be little felt. An additional advantage would be that
the servants would work so much better from seeing their master
not sparing himself. The occasional labour of the master may be
safely reckoned equal, at least, to the work of an additional
servant, even where his people are trustworthy; but if they are
eye-servants, requiring to be watched, the employer's
superintendence will make a much greater difference.</p>
<p>It only remains for the writer now to point out the benefit
the emigrant may derive from proceeding at once to the colony at
the present juncture. A letter from a friend with whom he is in
correspondence, dated January 24, after mentioning how severely
the deplorable condition of the markets for the last four years
had pressed upon many of the first settlers, obliging some to
part with their farms, contains this passage&mdash;"In the end, I
certainly think this change will conduce to the stability of the
colony; inasmuch as the land is gradually getting into the hands
of really practical and laborious farmers, who can produce more,
and live at far less cost, than a superior rank of farmers."
Persons arriving now in the colony may purchase from an
impoverished settler a grant of from 3000 to 4000 acres of good
land, and well situated, in the district of York or elsewhere,
for from 200<i>l</i>. to 300<i>l</i>. perhaps; but when this land
is no longer in the market, the emigrant must purchase land from
the Local Government, in situations beyond those at present
occupied, and at the price of 5<i>s</i>. per acre, being the
minimum fixed by his Majesty's Government.</p>
<p>It may be of importance to emigrants purposing to go out to
Western Australia, as well as to the friends of persons already
settled there, to be informed that Messrs. Mangles, East India
Agents, of Austin Friars, London, who have sent one of their
vessels, the <i>Hero</i>, this year to the colony, have announced
their intention to send a regular packet thither every year, to
sail on the 1st of June, with passengers and freight, and also to
put on one or more additional vessels, as occasion may require.
The remaining ships bound for the colony this year are, the
<i>Giraffe</i>, to sail on the 10th of August, and the
<i>Briton</i>, about the same time.</p>
<br>
<p>Having now touched upon all the various topics that have
occurred to him, and endeavoured to discharge what appeared to be
a duty both to the public and the colonists, in making known the
actual condition of the settlement, the writer has only to hope
that a beneficial purpose will be answered. As there never,
perhaps, was a period when a spirit of emigration more
extensively prevailed, he is induced to believe that the
appearance of this publication at such a juncture will be found
not unseasonable. Should it be the means of rightly directing any
of his countrymen who may now be looking out for a field of
honourable and successful enterprize, he will consider himself
amply recompensed for any labour the task has imposed. In his
judgment&mdash;on a calm and deliberate review of the whole
subject&mdash;the colony of Western Australia is calculated to
yield a rich return to capital, industry, and perseverance, and
appears to be destined by Providence to take a distinguished rank
among the dependencies of the British Empire.</p>

<h4>MEDICAL REPORTS.</h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Extract from Dr.
Wm. Milligan's Report on the Diseases of Western Australia, for
the Year ending 31 December, 1831.</span></div>
<div>(<i>Addressed to the Governor</i>.)</div>
<p>The favourable opinion I have already expressed of the
influence of this climate on European constitutions, and of the
place as a residence for invalids from India, is strengthened by
a further experience of two years.</p>
<p>I have met with several individuals here, who on leaving
England were great sufferers from dyspepsia, and disorders of the
digestive organs, generally from the nervous affections which so
often accompany these&mdash;from hypochondria, from asthma, and
from bronchial diseases&mdash;who have recovered their health in
a remarkable degree since their arrival. Some of slight figure
have become more robust and stronger. Parturition with the female
sex is expeditious and safe; being accomplished by the efforts of
nature alone, within from three to six hours. No woman has died
in childbirth in this colony since its commencement, nor am I
aware of any who died within a month after.</p>
<p>Children thrive remarkably well, and I may add every
description of live stock, although collected from different
climates,&mdash;England. India, South America, Africa, &amp;c.,
and various plants and vegetables, collected from as many
different sources, find here a congenial temperature.</p>
<p>Indeed I am disposed to conclude, that when the settlers are
well lodged and fed, and the country more cultivated and
improved, but few diseases will be met with; I might perhaps say,
only dysentery and ophthalmia, and these of a mild character.</p>

<br>
In compliance with your Excellency's request, as to my opinion of
the climate of Swan River, I beg leave to state, as a climate,
with regard to health, I am not aware of any other that can be
compared with it.</p>
<p>As a proof of its salubrity, during three years his Majesty's
sloop Sulphur was employed upon that station, not a single death,
and very few important cases of disease, occurred;
notwithstanding the very great exposure of her men, not only to
wet, but also night air, in consequence of her boats having been
a great deal employed at a distance from the anchorage. When
exploring the country for several days, and sometimes weeks,
these people have been exposed to the sun, fatigued in the
evening, after a day's excursion, slept in the open air, and that
repeatedly in wet weather, without suffering in the slightest
degree.</p>
<p>Another point ought also to be taken into
consideration&mdash;the debilitated state of those constitutions
which were undergoing this exposure, in consequence of having
been so long a period upon salt provisions and without vegetable
diet&mdash;out of three years and ten months the Sulphur was
employed upon the Swan River service, her crew were only 256 days
upon fresh diet. A life of this description in any other climate,
I have no hesitation in asserting, would have been productive of
the most serious disease.</p>

"aa">Description of the Roadsteads and Harbours of Western
Australia, communicated in a Letter Addressed to the Author by
Capt. Preston, R.N.</span></h4>
<p><i>Cockburn Sound</i>. In approaching the land keep the
Haycock on Garden Island N.E.½.N. (magnetic) till within 1½ miles
of Garden Island, when you will have passed over the five
fathoms' bank, and will be in nine to eleven fathoms water; then
steer to the northward, till the Challenger Buoy comes in one
with the Stags and Spit Beacons: a pilot will then come on board,
but you may safely run into Cockburn Sound by the chart, keeping
the Challenger and Stags-on the right hand, and the Middle Beacon
and Flat Ledge on the left. The Snapper Buoy and Pointer Beacon
show the south passage into Owen's Anchorage or into Gage's
Roads. Not knowing if the buoys and pilots are complete in the
channel into Cockburn Sound, it would be advisable for ships to
make Rottnest Island; keep it on your right hand and run for
Gage's Roads, as off Fremantle you-are sure of getting a pilot,
when you may anchor either in the Roads or Owen's Anchorage,
according to the season. Owen's Anchorage is good and safe at all
seasons of the year; and, in my humble opinion, there is not the
slightest necessity to go into Cockburn Sound, unless a ship
requires to be hove down, when Port Royal will be found well
adapted for that purpose; as his Majesty's ship Success was hove
keel out, during the most tempestuous winter (1830), and was
never obliged to be rightened through any swell setting in to the
Anchorage. The number of ships that were driven on shore during
that winter, was entirely owing to their not being properly found
with anchors and cables, and want of common precaution. The
masters of the ships had all sufficient warning and opportunity
to run into Owen's Anchorage from the Governor (Sir James
Stirling); besides, <i>long</i> before the gale came on, the
barometer fell so much as to make us keep an anchor-watch on
board the Sulphur, which we <i>very</i> seldom had occasion to
do.</p>
<p>From March to the beginning of September gales of wind from
N.W. to S.W. may be expected on the coast. They usually commence
at N.N.E., and are always preceded by very great depression of
the barometer. As they haul round to the westward, they are
accompanied by heavy squalls of wind and rain, and generally blow
most heavily when at N.W. Before the wind gets to the S.W. the
glass is seen to rise suddenly, and the change generally takes
place in a heavy squall; after which the weather becomes clear
and moderate.</p>
<p>Ships should not run for the land during a gale, unless they
are well acquainted with it, and <i>certain</i> of, their
latitude and longitude. In running for the land, in blowing
weather, I have often been certain of my reckoning by the
soundings.</p>
<p>The appearance of Rottnest and Garden Island is low and sandy;
but, in clear weather, the main land will be seen distinctly over
them.</p>
<p>The distance from Owen's Anchorage to Scott's Jetty, in
Fremantle Bay, is about two miles and a quarter.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><i>King George's Sound, with its
Harbours</i>.</p>
<p>In running into King George's Sound there is no danger through
either channel. A spit runs off the N.E. end of Michaelmas
Island, but shoals gradually to the shore. After you are inside
the Island, you may anchor in any part of the Sound in moderate
weather. There are two secure Harbours in the Sound, Princess
Royal and Oyster; the former will admit ships drawing eighteen or
nineteen feet water; the latter vessels drawing ten feet. Wood,
water, and ballast, may be obtained at both places.</p>

<br>
<h4><span class="aa">Cockburn Sound and Owen's
Anchorage.</span></h4>
<p>The following account of the buoys at the entrance of the
above harbours has been extracted from the "Nautical Magazine"
for March 1835, into which it was copied from the "Perth
Gazette," forwarded to that publication by the Surveyor-General,
Lieutenant J. S. Roe, R N.</p>
<p><span class="aa">The Challenger Buoy</span>, painted black, is
moored in six fathoms water, about twenty-five yards to the
north-east of the Challenger Rock, which is nearly awash, and is
situated near the north-western termination of Sea Reef;
extending a mile and a quarter in a north-west direction from the
north-west point of Garden Island. This buoy is visible from a
ship's deck, through a spy-glass, at the distance of five or six
miles, and is a principal object to be made out by a ship
approaching the channel between Carnac and Garden Islands.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Stags Beacon</span>, painted black, is placed
about three furlongs in the direction of S. 65° E. (magnetic)
from the Challenger buoy, in five fathoms water, about five yards
to the N.N.W. of a small rock, with only six or seven feet water
upon it. This rock is the northernmost of many which rise out of
five and six fathoms water, and from a reef called the
"Stags."</p>
<p><span class="aa">Mid Beacon</span>, painted white, is situated
opposite to the Challenger buoy, in nearly four fathoms water,
and in a line with the outer small island off the south point of
Carnac, towards which it is intended shortly to remove it about
eighty yards, into three fathoms on the southern edge of Middle
Shoal. Mid Beacon will then float at the distance of 100 yards to
the S.S.W. of eight and nine feet water on the Middle Shoal.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Flat Ledge Beacon</span>, painted white, is
placed in three fathoms and a half water, about 130 yards N.W. by
W: from the Flat Ledge, a small reef, covered by only six feet
water. This beacon will be shortly removed into three fathoms,
about 130 yards in a south-east direction, to the south side of
the Flat Ledge.</p>
<p>A ship may safely enter Cockburn Sound by passing to the north
of the Challenger Buoy and Stags Beacon, and to the south of the
Mid and Flat Ledge Beacons; steering S.E. by E. ¾ E. in
Mid-channel. This course may be prolonged until the Flat Ledge
and Mid Beacons are brought in a line; then haul up to the east,
until the largest rock of the Stragglers, appearing as two small
hammocks, comes in sight round the north-east point of Carnac.
This will clear the north-east spit, which extends three quarters
of a mile from the north-east point of Garden Island, and a
course may then be shaped for any part of the Sound.</p>
<p>To seaward of the Challenger, the principal dangers to be
avoided are situated on the Five Fathoms Bank, and consist of
Seaward Reef, a small patch, six or seven feet under water, about
three miles and a quarter W. by N. (magnetic) from the north end
of Carnac; and the Casuarina Shoal, with one and two fathoms upon
it, about two miles and a half of W. ½ N. from the north-west
point of Garden Island. Further to the south lies Coventry Reef,
a small patch of rocks just awash, hearing S 18½° W., and distant
eight miles from some remarkable sand-hills on the coast near the
middle of Garden Island, called "Sandown."</p>
<p><span class="aa">Lambert Channel</span>, through which his
Majesty's ship Alligator got to sea from Owen's Anchorage on the
19th of December, is a valuable outlet to sea or to Cockburn
Sound, from Owen's Anchorage or Gage's Roads, without passing
round Rottnest Island, which, during strong northerly winds that
would distress a ship in either of these situations, may be
considered almost impracticable. In the absence of means at the
present time for buoying this channel, it may be found by keeping
the summit of Buckland Downs a very little open to the south of
the Mewstone, in the direction of N.E. ¾ E. and S.W. ¾ W.
(magnetic). This mark will carry a ship through in not less than
four fathoms, and about 100 yards to the northward of a small
rock four or five feet under water, which is detached about a
cable's length to the north-east of the breakers on the western
bank, and is called the Passage Rock. At a cable's length to the
north-west of it is a small patch of two fathoms and
three-quarters. A ship must pass between them in four to five
fathoms water, and then haul up to the W. by S. to avoid a small
shoal spot with 3¼ upon it.</p>
<p>The soundings will then quickly deepen to 7, 5, 6, 8, and 9
fathoms, and a course may be shaped to pass half a mile to the
westward of the Challenger Buoy. This channel being narrow, and
not yet buoyed off, should not be attempted by a stranger without
previously securing a boat or conspicuous cask near the Passage
Rock, and another near the patch of two fathoms and
three-quarters to the north-westward of it.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Medina Beacon</span>, painted red, and the
<span class="aa">Alligator Beacon</span>, white, point out the
channel into Owen's Anchorage. The former is placed in four
fathoms water, on the northern edge of the Parmelia Bank, which
extends from Woodman's Point to Carnac; and the Alligator Beacon
is in five fathoms water, on the southern spit of the Success
Bank. They are nearly a mile apart, in a line between Fremantle
and the Haycock on Garden Island, with seven to nine fathoms
water between them. A ship should steer between them, and, after
passing over a bank of three fathoms water, bring up about a mile
from the shore, and nearly the same distance to the
south-eastward of a beacon which has been placed in two fathoms
water, at fifty yards to the westward of the fish-rocks. Should
this beacon disappear, the Fish-rocks may be found by keeping the
largest Seal-rock on with the south-end of the Mewstone, and
bringing the extremity of Rous Head in a line with a conspicuous
large sand patch on the coast to the northward.</p>
<p>The <span class="aa">Snapper Buoy</span> and <span class=
"aa">Pointer Beacon</span>, as represented in the printed chart
of 1831, have not been laid down, in consequence of the channel
between Carnac and the Western Bank, for which they were intended
as leading marks, having been found too intricate for general
use, until means are available for marking off some of the
principal dangers in it. The same cause has superseded the
present necessity for placing the <i>Basket Beacon</i> at Second
Head, and the <i>Brothers Beacon</i> at Beacon Head; nor has it
been considered necessary at present to place the Spit Beacon off
the north-east point of Garden Island, the foregoing directions
for avoiding it being amply sufficient for keeping a ship out of
danger in that quarter.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Swan-River Mission</span>.</h4>
<p>In the course of the past year a few friends of Missions in
Glasgow, sensible of the claims which the natives of Western
Australia have on them, proposed to the Church Missionary Society
to send a missionary there, and that the expense of the station
should be borne by themselves and other friends interested in the
object. The same proposal was repeated last winter by persons in
Dublin anxious to promote the same cause, but the Society
declined both proposals, assigning as a reason that they had
chosen China, as the next station to which they proposed to
extend their operations.</p>
<p>The failure of these applications has led to the formation in
Dublin of a Society called "The Swan River Mission," having for
its object the sending out missionaries of the Church of England,
and also schoolmasters, to the Aborigines and the colonists. The
committee of this Society are now occupied in looking out for
suitable persons to send thither in those capacities.</p>
<p>Messrs. F. and C. E. Mangles, East India Agents, Austin
Friars, London, on hearing a short time since of the existence of
the Society, liberally offered them a free passage for a
missionary; and as the author is persuaded there are many persons
in the United Kingdom who would, in a similar spirit, extend a
helping hand to the Society, he hopes this publication may be
instrumental in bringing such individuals acquainted with it.</p>
<p>Its committee is composed of the Rev. Messrs. Irwin (of
Sandford Chapel), Lloyd, and Marks (chaplains of Molyneux's
Asylum), and the Rev. H. Verschoyle (Chaplain of the South
Penitentiary); together with the following lay-members: A.
Ferrier, Pollock, Kincaid, and Churchill (M. D.), Esqrs.
Secretary, the Rev. Hamilton Verschoyle, No. 2, Pembroke-place.
The committee are thus particularized, as their names will be a
sufficient guarantee for the character of the Society, with all
who are acquainted with the religious and benevolent institutions
of Dublin.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Postscript</span>.&mdash;Since the above was
in type, the author has learned from the Secretary, that
unforeseen difficulties have arisen in the way of the Committee,
while endeavouring to carry out their plans, and that they have
come to the opinion that London would be the most suitable place
for the position of the Parent Society. At the same time they
express their perfect readiness to co-operate, to the utmost of
their power, as a branch society; and offer, as a proof of their
zeal in the cause, to engage for the raising of the sum of
100<i>l</i>. towards the purpose originally contemplated.</p>

Colony, is extremely anxious that they, and the respectable
community to which they belong, should not, in giving up the many

blessing, she has undertaken to raise a subscription for the
erection of a Church, on the principles of the Establishment and

the Church of England. She has limited the sum to be contributed
to sixpence, not only because she trusts to find it sufficient,
but that it overcomes any reluctance she might otherwise
experience in making her solicitations for this distant though
promising part of our empire&mdash;to feel she is asking for that

<h4><span class="aa">Native Institution.</span></h4>
<p>With a view to try the experiment of civilizing the natives in
the neighbourhood of Perth,&mdash;the plan will of course be
extended to other districts where its beneficial effects have
been made apparent,&mdash;his Excellency, the Governor, has been
pleased to appoint Mr. F. Armstrong interpreter, with a limited
salary, at present; but it will be subject to further improvement
in proportion to the increased utility of the institution. Mr.
Armstrong brings to the task a considerable knowledge of the
native language, obtained through several years of diligent
inquiry, and frequent association with the natives in their
primitive haunts; we are gratified, therefore, to find so
judicious a selection made, and are disposed to augur favourably
of this further attempt at conciliation, under the direction of
one who has hitherto voluntarily devoted his time to the
acquirement of the native language, and has zealously sought an
intimate acquaintance with the habits and manners of the tribes
around us.</p>
<p>A slight sketch of the proposed system to be adopted may not
be unacceptable to our readers; we shall therefore glance over a
few of the principal heads. At the outset the natives are to
understand that they are to procure their own means of
subsistence, either by the remuneration they may derive from work
or labour performed for individuals, or by the exercise of their
own native arts, such as fishing, hunting, &amp;c. It does not
form any part of the intended plan to maintain the natives at the
public expense, or support them in a state of indolence,&mdash;a
boat will be provided for them, for the purpose of fishing, and
any surplus quantity they may have will be disposed of for their
benefit, under the direction of Mr. Armstrong. They will not be
subject to any restraint, but have free ingress and egress, at
all times, to such grounds as may be set apart for them; we
believe it is in contemplation to devote the grounds under Mount
Eliza to that purpose, to which they can have access without
passing through the town.</p>
<p>The advantages the natives will have in attaching themselves
to the institution, will be&mdash;protection from violence,
whether from each other or from white people, medical aid in time
of sickness, and a regular supply of food ensured by cautious
guidance and a provident superintendence; which it is hoped will
gradually bring them to a more civilized and happier state of
existence.</p>
<p>The following we believe to be the substance of the objects to
which it is the desire of his Excellency that the interpreter
should direct the attention of the natives:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. That the Government is actuated, in forming this
institution, by a disposition to do the natives a good.</p>
<p>2nd. That Mr. Armstrong, understanding the native language,
and being a friend to the natives, has been appointed to reside
with such of them as may please to live at Mount Eliza Bay.</p>
<p>3rd. That the Governor has given a boat for their use in
fishing.</p>
<p>4th. That when they have fish to spare, Mr. Armstrong will
help them to dispose of it for flour or money.</p>
<p>5th. That when they are sick, Mr. Armstrong will take them to
the doctor to be cured.</p>
<p>6th. That they will be shown how to build huts for
themselves.</p>
<p>7th. That as long as they behave well they shall not be
molested by any one, whether black or white; and if they are, the
Governor will take their part.</p>
<p>8th. That they are to employ and maintain themselves by
fishing, or such other work as Mr. Armstrong may point out; and
that if they do not procure enough for their own supply, they
must go without.</p>
<p>9th. That if they like to go away from Eliza Bay, they may
always do so, and come back at their pleasure: but while there
they must behave well, and do as Mr. Armstrong directs them; and
if they are not well conducted, Mr. Armstrong will not let them
remain there.&mdash;From the <i>W. A. Journal of Dec</i>. 13,

<hr class="tenth">
<h4><span class="aa">Extraordinary Recovery of a Child by the
Swan-River Natives.</span></h4>
<p>About half-past seven o'clock on the evening of the 11th ult.,
it was reported to Mr. Norcott that one of Mr. Hall's children, a
boy, between five and six years of age, was missing, and that he
had not been seen since one o'clock on that day, when his brother
left him on the beach looking at some soldiers who were fishing
there. The natural conclusion was, that the child had mistaken
his path on returning home, and had wandered into the bush.
Immediate search was made, conceiving that he could not have gone
far from the settlement, and was kept up for two hours, indeed
until the darkness of the night compelled the party to relinquish
all hope of finding him. At four o'clock the next morning, Mr.
Norcott, accompanied by Corporal Blyth, of the 21st regiment,
Smith, of the Police, and the two natives, Migo and Molly-dobbin,
who are now attached to the Mounted Police Corps, set out to
renew the search, fully calculating upon finding the little boy
in less than an hour. They soon came upon the track where he had
been the preceding day, and pursued it for some distance to the
northward, when it was lost to all but the natives, who,
notwithstanding the wind had been blowing very fresh, and had
rendered the traces imperceptible to an unpractised eye, still
continued to follow them up, along the beach, for about four
miles, when they intimated that he had turned into the bush. Here
they still followed him into an almost impenetrable thicket,
through which they said he must have crawled on his hands and
knees. Their progress was now very slow, in consequence of the
thick bush, and the difficulty of perceiving the track on the
loose sand; but the acuteness of the natives, who are certainly
most astonishingly gifted. led them through it, and in about an
hour's time they regained the beach, the boy having made a
circuit inland of about 400 yards. The track was now more
strongly marked, and was perceptible to the whole party,
continuing so over a space of about five miles, occasionally
turning in and out of the bush. At the end of about nine miles
further the natives were quite at fault, owing to his having left
the beach and entered a thicket, which it was with difficulty
they could push themselves through; they, however, persevered,
and delighted the party, by every now and then crying out, "<i>Me
meyal geena</i>," meaning, "I see the foot-marks." Mr. Norcott,
who was on horseback, finding great difficulty in passing through
the scrub, took a position on a high hill, overlooking the
interesting progress of the natives in the hollow below. They
were then making their way through a perfect mass of matted bush;
and Mr. Norcott informs us, such was the apparent difficulty in
tracking the child, that he was about to despair of success,
when, to his astonishment, they held up a cap, which was known to
belong to the boy. This circumstance cheered them in their
pursuit, and about half an hour afterwards the track directed
them again to the beach. They proceeded until they reached the
Sand Cliffs, about ten or twelve miles from Clarence, one native
continuing to walk a little way in the bush, in order to be
certain that the boy had not crossed, or left the beach, and the
other remaining with the party on the beach. Here it was
ascertained he had again taken to the bush, and they found no
difficulty in tracking him until they came to an elevated spot,
where the wind had entirely effaced the marks of his feet. This
was a most anxious moment, as even the natives seemed to be
doubtful whether they would again discover the track. Migo,
however, descended the hill, persisting in search along the
plains inland, and, after having made a circuit of about half a
mile, was once more fortunate to fall in with the track; but
notwithstanding they had found it, they were sorely perplexed to
retain it, and were kept near the spot for two hours, off and on,
losing and again discovering it. The party had nearly given up
all hope of seeing the child, when Molly-dobbin pointed out the
track on the side of a deep ravine. They were then about 600
yards from the beach. The natives then went down into the ravine,
and commenced hallooing, thinking that the child might be asleep
in the bush, and still persevered in pressing through the
thickest scrub, and the most difficult country to penetrate
through which they had yet passed; in a short time they once more
found themselves on the beach; and observing, by the tracks, that
the child had evidently been there within a very short period,
they journeyed on with a better hope of obtaining their object,
and restoring the lost child to his afflicted parents. No sooner
were these feelings of gratification excited, at viewing the
recent footsteps, than, at a distance of about three hundred
yards, the child was seen lying on the beach, its legs washed by
the surf, and apparently, in a state of insensibility. Mr.
Norcott galloped up to him, and, calling him by name, the boy
awoke and instantly jumped up. Another hour, and probably the
child would have perished, as the waves were rapidly gaining on
him. The joy and delight of the two natives is represented to
have been beyond all conception; and their steady perseverance,
Mr. Norcott says, was beyond any thing he could have anticipated
from them: and really, when it is considered that they walked a
distance of nearly twenty-two miles, with their eyes, for ten
hours, constantly fixed upon the ground, and at the same time
evincing the most intense anxiety to be instrumental in rescuing
the child from its impending fate, we cannot but esteem the act,
and highly applaud the noble disposition of these two
savages.</p>
<p>Mr. Norcott took the child up, and placing him on the horse
before him, the party made for the nearest road home, where they
arrived about nine o'clock at night, having been over a distance
of thirty-nine miles, after being out seventeen hours, without
the slightest refreshment.</p>
<p>It is certainly surprising that the child should have got so
far, in the manner he must have been frequently compelled to
force himself through the bush. He is not three feet high. His
clothes were much torn, and his body was covered with scratches
and bruises.</p>
<p>Mr. Norcott, in speaking of the conduct of the natives,
conceives that he cannot too highly commend their behaviour, and
adduces this circumstance as an instance of the great advantage
derived from having these two natives, Migo and Molly-dobbin,
permanently attached to the Corps.&mdash;<i>Extract from the W.

<h4><span class="aa">Government Notice</span>.</h4>
<p align="right">Perth, August 22, 1834.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="aa">Instructions</span> having been received by
me from his Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the
Colonies to appoint Mr. W. H. Mackie as Commissioner of the Civil
Court, under an arrangement made by authority of his Majesty's
Government for consolidating in one individual the two offices of
Criminal and Civil Judge, hitherto held respectively by Mr. W. H.
Mackie, as Chairman of the Quarter Sessions, and by Mr. G. F.
Moore, as Civil Commissioner; the cessation of Mr. Moore's duties
in the Civil Court, pursuant to those instructions, affords me
the opportunity of expressing in the most public manner my
unqualified approbation of his conduct while he has held that
office. Qualified no less by education than by natural talent and
temper for administering justice with wisdom and integrity, the
necessity which has led to this discontinuance of Mr. Moore's
duties in the Civil Court will be duly appreciated by the public
at large, no less than by myself; and he will have the
satisfaction of carrying with him, into whatever employment,
whether of a public or private nature, which he may undertake,
not only the consciousness of high desert, but of knowing, from
this public testimony to his merit, the esteem in which he is
held by me, as the chief authority in this settlement.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX, No. X.</h3>

<h4><span class="aa">Profits Of Sheep Farming.</span></h4>
<p align="center">(<i>This Article oginally appeared in the Cape
Advertiser, and is now copied from the Western Australian Journal
of Nov</i>. 29, 1834.)</p>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> sheep of this colony (the Cape)
have hitherto been reared chiefly for food. But as, with little
or no care, they increase much faster than the human race, and as
their flesh, being impatient of salt, is unfit far exportation,
this article of produce, though most agreeable to the consumer,
has long since ceased to hold out any great prospects of wealth
to the producer. Genuine Cape sheep, with their thin wiry hair,
may be purchased in any numbers from the distant farmers for
1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to 2<i>s</i>. a
head.&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>The total number of these sheep in the colony may be taken at
two millions, and using round numbers, we may take their value at
the same number of rix-dollars, or 150,000<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>The manufacture of woollen cloth from the wool of pure Cape
sheep is unknown. A small quantity has lately been forced into
the service of the hatter, and the remainder has either been
suffered to rot where it was shed, or entombed in the
uncomfortable mattress, or the pack-saddle of the horse, ass, or
ox. It was unfit for any market.</p>
<p>Some improvement in this branch of agriculture has lately been
effected; but in 1830 the total quantity of wool exported from
this fine grazing colony, admirably adapted to the construction
and habits of the animal, was 33,407 lbs., at an average price of
10<i>d</i>. per lb.; so that the whole crop of wool did not
exceed in value the sum of 1,475<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>.
10<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>In New South Wales the climate and face of the country, in
their adaptation to the rearing of sheep, very much resemble
those of the Cape. We believe no difference exists in any point
considerable enough to establish a claim of superiority on either
side. And up to 1816 so little sensible were the stockholders of
New South Wales of the capabilities of their country, with
respect to the production of wool for exportation, that we find
Mr. Riley, an able and zealous improver, strenuously urging them
to "a consideration of the obvious propriety of transforming the
hair that disgraced so many of their sheep into golden fleeces."
The total export of wool for that year amounted to no more than
about 80,000 lbs. But at that moment the spirit of improvement
seems to have caught the whole agricultural population, and the
following facts will give our readers some notion what miracles a
whole population can perform, when they act in concert and from
upright principles.</p>
<p>In 1816, as we have seen, the quantity of wool exported from
New South Wales was about 80,000 lbs., more or less.</p>

<p>Nothing in the history of agriculture has been known parallel
to this&mdash;except in the neighbouring colony Van Diemen's
Land, into which sheep were introduced for the first time in
1826. Indeed it was only discovered to be an island in 1798, and
taken possession of by the British in 1803. In 1830 the
population, exclusive of a few savage natives, amounted to only
21,125, of whom about 10,000 were convicts. And what quantity of
wool did these 11,125 recent free settlers export to the United
Kingdom in 1830, only twenty-seven years after the foundation of
the colony? No less than 993,979 lbs.!</p>
<p>By the above statement we see that the quantity of wool
exported from New South Wales, since 1822, has been more than
doubled every three years. But its improvement in quality has not
been less admirable. In 1816 it was described by Mr. Riley as
"hair which disgraced the sheep." In 1820 a few bales of wool
from Mr. Macarthur's flock sold in England at 5<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. per lb., and one at 10<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.! The common
price was 2<i>s</i>. In 1830 the Australian wool sold in the
London market at the following prices, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>Best, 2<i>s</i>. to 5<i>s</i>.; second and inferior,
1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. to 2<i>s</i>.; lamb's, 1<i>s</i>.
2<i>d</i>. to 2<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>The whole of the enormous quantity they now export, it is
expected, will realize an average price of 2<i>s</i>. per lb.,
which will give for the crop of 1834 the sum of
270,000<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>With respect to the number of sheep from whose backs this
prodigious sum of money is annually extracted, we have, at the
moment, no certain information of later date than 1828. But as
from 1819 to 1828 they had increased from 75,369 to 556,391, we
may safely estimate their present number to be about two
millions.</p>
<p>The sound of these words brings our thoughts back to the Cape.
We have about two millions of sheep; but the wool exported this
year will probably not exceed 100,000 lbs., nor realize a higher
sum than 7000<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>For what purpose are these statements submitted to our
readers? Not to vex them by any humiliating contrast, but to
encourage them by a splendid example of successful industry,
which they have now the opportunity and means to imitate, and
perhaps surpass. Only fourteen years ago the wool exported from
both the Australian colonies did not exceed in quantity that
which we now raise. They had to import the Merino breed from
Europe to improve their coarse and inferior flocks, exposed to a
voyage twice as long as, and more than doubly hazardous that, our
imports have to encounter. We have a more abundant population,
labour cheaper, and most certainly not of a worse description,
and every thing else at least equally favourable. And we have at
the present moment in prospect two additional advantages which
render our position decidedly superior to theirs.</p>
<p>In the first place, an addition is about to be made to the
capital of the colony, not as a balance for exports, the produce
of many years' labour&mdash;but an absolute addition, without any
equivalent being rendered to the source from which it
comes&mdash;of probably not less than 1,200,000<i>l</i>.
sterling, or about eight times the value of all the sheep at
present in the colony!</p>
<p>In the next place, we have discovered a market where we can be
supplied with sheep of equal if not superior quality, at nearly
one half the distance, and at a much cheaper rate than in Europe.
This is no other than New South Wales itself, which has already
begun to export these valuable animals; and from the largeness of
the stock and the rapidity with which they increase, constantly
doubling their numbers in about two years and a half, there is no
risk in our demand, however extensive, making any sensible
impression on their means of supplying us.</p>
<p>The first investment has already arrived in Cape Town. It
consists of thirty males of the pure Saxon breed, selected from
the flock of Alexander Riley, Esq., of Raby.</p>
<p>The history of this Saxon breed is also worthy of notice, as
it another instance of the wonderful results of sheep come
originally from Spain, where they are called Merinos. The late
King of Saxony, when elector, was the first who introduced them
into his dominions. He purchased a small flock from the King of
Spain, and exerted so much diligence and care in promoting their
growth, that they soon succeeded better in Germany than in Spain
itself. In the London market, in March 1832, the best Saxon wool
of the Electoral flocks, sold at from 4<i>s</i>. to 6<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. per lb.; while the best Spanish wool, the Leonesa,
fetched no more than from 2<i>s</i>. to 2<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. And
as to their increase, the following fact may suffice:&mdash;In
1830 there were imported from Germany into the British market
alone, 26,073,822 lbs; while the quantity imported from Spain did
not exceed 1,643,515 lbs.</p>
<p>Indeed the Merino seems to improve by every removal from its
native soil and climate. Even in England, the climate of which
forms a perfect, and to sheep a most severe, contrast with that
of Spain, the Merinos not only thrive but improve, both in the
carcass and in the quality of their wool. And we have already
seen that in 1820 Mr. Macarthur obtained the highest price ever
known in the London market, for a bale of wool taken from Merinos
in New South Wales. Thus, if the scheme we now recommend, obtain
the approbation of our fellow-colonists, we shall probably lay a
better foundation for our future flocks, which are to constitute
the wealth and power of the colony, than has ever yet been laid
in any country. Our breed&mdash;the future Cape breed of
sheep&mdash;will have proceeded from Spain to Saxony, from Saxony
to Australia, and from Australia to South Africa&mdash;improving
at every stage.</p>
<p>These sheep we have seen, in a climate in every respect the
same as ours, double their numbers in every two years and a half,
more or less. In 1838½ we shall, therefore, have 200,000 sheep.
In 1841 we shall have 400,000. In 1843½ they will have increased
to 800,000. In 1846 to 1,600,000. In 1848½, or say in 1850, we
shall have <span class="aa">three millions</span> and
<span class="aa">two hundred thousand</span> sheep, bearing
fleeces of the finest quality in the world, bringing into the
colony an annual return of not less than 350,000<i>l</i>,
independently of their skins and tallow.</p>
<p>Is this extravagant? Look at Australia. It has been
accomplished there, as it were, under our own eyes, in less than
eighteen years, though means and resources there, compared with
what ours will be, were as but one to ten.</p>
