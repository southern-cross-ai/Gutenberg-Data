<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">IT was six o'clock of a March morning, and still
dark. The long train came sidling through the scattered lights of
the yard, clicking gently over the points. Into the glow of the
signal cabin and out again. Under the solitary emerald among the
rubies on the signal bridge. On towards the empty grey waste of
platform that waited under the arcs.</p>

<p>The London mail at the end of its journey.</p>

<p>Five hundred miles of track lay behind it in the darkness all
the way to Euston and last night. Five hundred miles of moonlit
fields and sleeping villages; of black towns and unsleeping
furnaces; rain, fog, and frost; snow flurry and flood; tunnel and
viaduct. Now, in the six o'clock bleakness of a March morning the
hills had risen round it and it was coming, casual-seeming and
quiet, to rest after its long urgency. And only one person in all
its crowded length did not sigh with relief at the realisation.</p>

<p>Of those who sighed two at least sighed with a gladness that
bordered on passion. One of these was a passenger, and the other
was a railway employee. The passenger was Alan Grant; and the
railway employee was Murdo Gallacher.</p>

<p>Murdo Gallacher was a sleeping-car attendant, and the best-hated
living creature between Thurso and Torquay. For twenty years Murdo
had browbeaten the travelling public into acquiescence and
blackmailed them into tribute. Monetary tribute, that is. Their
vocal tribute was voluntary. To first-class passengers far and wide
he was known as Yughourt. (Oh God, it's Old Yughourt! they would
say as his sour face became visible through the steamy gloom of
Euston.) The third-class passengers called him a variety of things,
both frank and descriptive. What his colleagues called him is
nobody's business. Only three people had ever got the better of
Murdo: a cowhand from Texas, a lance-corporal of the Queen's Own
Cameron Highlanders, and an unknown little Cockney woman in the
third-class who had threatened to beat him over his bald head with
a lemonade bottle. Neither rank nor achievement impressed Murdo: he
hated one and resented the other; but he was greatly afraid of
physical pain.</p>

<p>For twenty years Murdo Gallacher had done the absolute minimum.
He had been bored by the job before he had been a week at it, but
he had found it a rich lode and he had stayed to mine it. If you
got morning tea from Murdo the tea would be weak, the biscuit soft,
the sugar dirty, the tray slopped, and the spoon missing; but when
Murdo came to collect the tray the protests which you had been
rehearsing died on your lips. Now and then an Admiral of the Fleet
or something like that would venture an opinion that it was damned
awful tea, but the ruck smiled and paid up. For twenty years they
had paid up, weary and browbeaten and blackmailed. And Murdo had
collected. He was now the owner of a villa at Dunoon, a string of
fried-fish shops in Glasgow, and a very nice bank balance. He might
have retired years ago but he could not bear the thought of losing
his full pension; so he endured the boredom a little longer and
evened things up by not bothering with early morning teas unless
passengers suggested the thing themselves; and sometimes, if he was
very sleepy, forgetting about the order anyway. He hailed the end
of each journey with the relief of a man who is working out his
sentence and has only a short time left.</p>

<p>Alan Grant, watching the lights of the yard float past beyond
the steamed-up window and listening to that gentle sound of the
wheels clicking over the points, was glad because the end of the
journey was the end of a night's suffering. Grant had spent the
night trying not to open the door into the corridor. Wide awake, he
had lain on his expensive pallet and sweated by the hour. He had
sweated not because the compartment was too hot&mdash;the
air-conditioning worked to a marvel&mdash;but because (O Misery! O
Shame! O Mortification!) the compartment represented A Small
Enclosed Space. To the normal eye the compartment was just a neat
little room with a bunk, a wash-basin, a mirror, luggage racks in
assorted sizes, shelves that appeared or disappeared as bidden, a
fine little drawer for one's hypothetical valuables, and a hook for
one's presumably unhocked watch. But to the initiate, the sad and
haunted initiate, it was A Small Enclosed Space.</p>

<p>Overwork, the doctor called it.</p>

<p>'Sit back and browse for a little,' the doctor had said,
crossing one elegant Wimpole Street leg over the other and admiring
the hang of it.</p>

<p>Grant could not imagine himself sitting back, and he considered
browsing a loathsome word and a contemptible occupation. Browsing.
A fattening-up for the table. A mindless satisfaction of animal
desires. Browse, indeed! The very sound of the word was an offence.
A snore.</p>

<p>'Have you any hobbies?' the doctor had asked, his admiring
glance going on to his shoes.</p>

<p>'No,' Grant had said shortly.</p>

<p>'What do you do when you go on holiday?'</p>

<p>'I fish.'</p>

<p>'You fish?' said the psychologist, seduced from his Narcissian
gazing. 'And you don't consider that a hobby?'</p>

<p>'Certainly not.'</p>

<p>'What is it, then, would you say?'</p>

<p>'Something between a sport and a religion.'</p>

<p>And at that Wimpole Street had smiled and had looked quite
human; and assured him that his cure was only a matter of time.
Time and relaxation.</p>

<p>Well, at least he had managed not to open that door last night.
But the triumph had been dearly bought. He was drained and empty; a
walking nothingness. 'Don't fight it,' the doctor had said. 'If you
want to be in the open, go into the open.' But to have opened that
door last night would have meant a defeat so mortal that he felt
there would be no recovery. It would have been an unconditional
surrender to the forces of Unreason. So he had lain and sweated.
And the door had stayed closed.</p>

<p>But now, in the unrewarding dark of early morning, in the bleak
anonymous dark, he was as without virtue as if he had lost. 'I
suppose this is how women feel after long labour,' he thought, with
that fundamental detachment which Wimpole Street had noted and
approved. 'But at least they have a brat to show for it. What have
I got?'</p>

<p>His pride, he supposed. Pride that he had not opened a door that
there was no reason to open. Oh God!</p>

<p>He opened the door now. Reluctantly; and appreciating the irony
of that reluctance. Loath to face the morning and life. Wishing
that he could throw himself back on that rumpled couch and sleep
and sleep and sleep.</p>

<p>He picked up the two suitcases which Yughourt had not offered to
do anything about, tucked the bundle of unread periodicals under
his arm, and went out into the corridor. The little vestibule at
the end of it was blocked almost to the roof with the luggage of
the more lavish tippers, so that the door was nearly invisible; and
Grant moved on into the second of the first-class coaches. The
forward end of that too was stacked waist-deep with privileged
obstacles, and he began to walk down the corridor towards the door
at the rear end. As he did so Yughourt himself came from his
cubby-hole at the far end to make sure that Number B Seven was
aware that they were nearly at the terminus. It was the
acknowledged right of Number B Seven, or of any Number whatever, to
leave the train at his leisure after arrival; but Yughourt had of
course no intention of hanging round while someone had his sleep
out. So he knocked loudly on the door of B Seven and went in.</p>

<p>As Grant came level with the open door Yughourt was shaking B
Seven, who was lying fully dressed on the bunk, by the cloth of his
sleeve and saying in choked exasperation: 'Come on, sir, come on!
We're practically in.'</p>

<p>He looked up as Grant's shadow darkened the door and said
disgustedly: 'Tight as an owl!'</p>

<p>The compartment was so solid with the reek of whisky that you
could stand a walking-stick in it, Grant noticed. Automatically he
picked up the newspaper that Yughourt's shaking had dislodged on to
the compartment floor, and straightened the man's jacket.</p>

<p>'Can't you recognise a dead man when you see one?' he said.
Through the haze of his tiredness he heard his own voice say it:
'Can't you recognise a dead man when you see one? As if it were a
thing of no moment. Can't you recognise a primrose when you see
one? Can't you recognise a Rubens when you see one? Can't you
recognise the Albert Memorial when&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Dead!' said Yughourt in a kind of howl. 'He can't be! I'm due
to go off.'</p>

<p>That, Grant noted from his far-away stance, was all that it
meant to Mr Blast His Soul Gallacher. Someone had taken leave of
life, had gone out from warmth and feeling and perception to
nothingness, and all it meant to Damn His Eyes Gallacher was that
he would be late in getting off duty.</p>

<p>'What'll I do?' said Yughourt. 'How was I to know anyone was
drinking themselves to death in my coach! What'll I do?'</p>

<p>'Report to the police, of course,' Grant said, and for the first
time was conscious of life again as a place where one might have
pleasure. It gave him a twisted macabre pleasure that Yughourt had
at last met his match: the man who would get out of tipping him;
and that that man should be the one to put him to more
inconvenience than anyone had succeeded in doing in all his twenty
years in the railway service.</p>

<p>He looked again at the young face under the rumpled dark hair,
and went away down the corridor. Dead men were not his
responsibility. He had had his fill of dead men in his time, and
although he had never quite lost a heart-contraction at its
irrevocability, death had no longer power to shock him.</p>

<p>The wheels ceased their clicking and instead came the long low
hollow sound that a train makes coming into a railway station.
Grant lowered the window and watched the grey ribbon of the
platform run past. The cold struck him like a blow in the face and
he began to shiver uncontrollably.</p>

<p>He dropped the two suitcases on the platform and stood there
(chattering like a blasted monkey, he thought resentfully) and
wished that it were possible to die temporarily. In some last dim
recess of his mind he knew that to dither with cold and nerves on a
station platform at six of a winter morning was in the final resort
a privilege; a corollary to being alive; but oh, how wonderful it
would be to achieve temporary death and pick up life again at some
happier moment.</p>

<p>'To the hotel, sir?' the porter said. 'Yes, I'll take them over
when I've seen to this barrow-load.'</p>

<p>He stumbled up the steps and across the bridge. The wood sounded
drumlike and hollow under his tread, great bursts of steam billowed
up round him from below, noises clanged and echoed from the dark
vault about him. They were all wrong about hell, he thought. Hell
wasn't a nice cosy place where you fried. Hell was a great cold
echoing cave where there was neither past nor future; a black,
echoing desolation. Hell was concentrated essence of a winter
morning after a sleepless night of self-distaste.</p>

<p>He stepped out into the empty courtyard, and the sudden quiet
soothed him. The darkness was cold but clean. A hint of greyness in
its quality spoke of morning, and a breath of snow in its cleanness
spoke of the 'high tops'. Presently, when it was daylight, Tommy
would come to the hotel and pick him up and they would drive away
into the great clean Highland country; away into the wide,
unchanging, undemanding Highland world where people died only in
their beds and no one bothered to shut a door anyhow because it was
too much trouble.</p>

<p>In the hotel dining-room the lights were on only at one end, and
into the gloom of the unlit spaces marched ranks of naked
baize-topped tables. He had never before, now he came to think of
it, seen restaurant tables undressed. They were really very humble
shabby things stripped of their white armour. Like waiters without
their shirt-fronts.</p>

<p>A child in a black uniform dress and a green jersey coat
embroidered with flowers poked her head round a screen and seemed
startled to see him. He asked what he might have for breakfast. She
took a cruet from the sideboard and set it on the cloth in front of
him with an air of ringing the curtain up.</p>

<p>'I'll send Mary to you,' she said kindly, and went away behind
the screen.</p>

<p>Service, he thought, had lost its starch and its high glaze. It
had become what housewives call rough-dried. But now and then a
promise to send Mary to one made up for embroidered jerseys and
similar infelicities.</p>

<p>Mary was a plump calm creature who would inevitably have been a
Nannie if Nannies were not out of fashion, and under her
ministrations Grant felt himself relaxing as a child does in the
presence of a benevolent authority. It was a fine state of affairs,
he thought bitterly, when he needed reassurance so badly that a fat
hotel waitress could provide it.</p>

<p>But he ate what she put in front of him and began to feel
better. Presently she came back, removed the slices of cut bread,
and put in their place a plate of morning rolls.</p>

<p>'Here's the baps to you,' she said. 'They've just this minute
come. They're poor things nowadays. No chew in them at all. But
they're better than that bread.'</p>

<p>She pushed the marmalade nearer to his hand, looked to see if he
needed more milk, and went away again. Grant, who had had no
intention of eating any more, buttered a bap and reached for one of
the unread papers from last night's store. What came to his hand
was a London evening paper, and he looked at it with a puzzled lack
of recognition. Had he bought an evening paper? Surely he had read
the evening paper at the normal hour of four o'clock in the
afternoon. Why buy another at seven o'clock in the evening? Had
buying an evening paper become a reflex action; as automatic as
brushing one's teeth? Lighted bookstall: evening paper. Was that
the way it worked?</p>

<p>The paper was a <i>Signal</i>; the afternoon voice of the
morning <i>Clarion</i>. Grant looked again at the headlines which
he had absorbed yesterday afternoon and thought how constant in
kind they were. It was yesterday's paper, but it might equally be
last year's or next month's. The headlines would for ever be the
ones that he was looking at now: the Cabinet row, the dead body of
the blonde in Maida Vale, the Customs prosecution, the hold-up, the
arrival of an American actor, the street accident. He pushed the
thing away from him, but as he reached out a hand for the next in
the pile he noticed that the blank space for the Stop Press news
bore scribblings in pencil. He turned the paper round so that he
could see what someone had been calculating. But it seemed that the
scribble was not after all some newsboy's hasty reckoning of the
odds. It was someone's attempt at verse. That it was an original
work and not an attempt to remember some verse already known was
apparent in the desultory writing and in the fact that the writer
had filled the two missing lines by ticking in the required number
of feet; a trick that Grant himself had used in the days when he
had been the best sonnet-writer in the sixth form.</p>

<p>But this time the poem was none of his.</p>

<p>And suddenly he knew where the paper had come from. He had
acquired it by an action much more automatic than buying an evening
paper. He had put it under his arm with the others when he picked
it up as it slipped to the floor of compartment B Seven. His
conscious mind&mdash;or as much of it as was conscious after last
night&mdash;was concerned with the disarray that Yughourt was
making of a helpless man. His only deliberate action had been his
reproof to Yughourt in his straightening of the man's jacket, and
for that he had needed a hand, and so the paper had gone under his
arm with the rest.</p>

<p>So the young man with the tumbled black hair and the reckless
eyebrows had been a poet, had he?</p>

<p>Grant looked with interest at the pencilled words. The writer
had designed his effort in eight lines, it seemed, but had not been
able to think of the fifth and sixth. So that the scribble
read:</p>

<p><i>The beasts that talk,<br>
The streams that stand,<br>
The stones that walk,<br>
The singing sand,</i><br>
...<br>
...<br>
<i>That guard the way<br>
To Paradise.</i></p>

<p>Well, it was odd enough, in all conscience. The beginnings of
delirium tremens?</p>

<p>It was understandable that the owner of that very individual
face would see nothing so ordinary in his alcoholic dreams as pink
rats. Nature itself would turn cartwheels for the young man with
the reckless eyebrows. What was the Paradise that was guarded by so
terrifying a strangeness? Oblivion? Why had he needed oblivion so
badly that it represented Paradise to him? That he had been
prepared to run the known horror of the approaches to it?</p>

<p>Grant ate the fine fresh bap that there was 'no chew in' and
considered the matter. The writing was unformed but not at all
shaky; it looked the writing of an adult who wrote an unformed hand
not because his co-ordination was bad but because he had never
quite grown up. Because in essentials he was still the schoolboy
who had originally written that way. This theory was confirmed by
the shape of the capital letters, which were made in pure copy-book
form. Odd, that so individual a creature had had no desire to
impress his individuality on the form of his letters. Very few
people indeed did not adapt the copy-book form to their own liking;
to their own unconscious need.</p>

<p>One of Grant's milder interests had for years been this business
of handwriting; and in his work he had found the results of his
long observation greatly useful. Now and then, of course, he was
shaken out of any complacency about his deductions&mdash;a multiple
murderer who dissolved his victims in acid turned out to have
handwriting remarkable only for its extreme logic; which after all
was perhaps appropriate enough&mdash;but in general, handwriting
provided a very good index to a man. And in general a man who
continued to use the schoolboy form for his letters did so for one
of two reasons: either he was unintelligent, or he wrote so little
that the writing had had no chance of absorbing his
personality.</p>

<p>Considering the high degree of intelligence that had put into
words that nightmare hazard at the gates of Paradise, it was
obvious that it was not lack of personality that had kept the young
man's writing adolescent. His personality&mdash;his vitality and
interest&mdash;had gone into something else.</p>

<p>Into what? Something active, something extrovert. Something in
which writing was used for messages like: 'Meet me Cumberland bar,
6.45, Tony', or for filling up a log.</p>

<p>But he was introvert enough to have analysed and put into words
that country-of-the-moon on the way to his Paradise. Introvert
enough to have stood apart and looked at it; to have wanted to
record it.</p>

<p>Grant sat in a pleasant warm daze, chewing and considering. He
noted the tightly-joined tops of the n's and m's. A liar? Or just
secretive? A curiously cautious trait to appear in the writing of a
man with those eyebrows. It was a strange thing how much the
meaning of a countenance depended on eyebrows. One change of degree
in the angle this way or that and the whole effect was different.
Film magnates took nice little girls from Balham and Muswell Hill
and rubbed out their eyebrows and painted in other ones and they
became straightway mysterious creatures from Omsk and Tomsk. He had
once been told by Trabb, the cartoonist, that it was his eyebrows
that had lost Ernie Price his chance of being Prime Minister. 'They
didn't like his eyebrows,' Trabb had said, blinking owlishly over
his beer. 'Why? Don't ask me. I just draw. Because they looked
bad-tempered, perhaps. They don't like a bad-tempered man. Don't
trust him. But that's what lost him his chance, take it from me.
His eyebrows. They didn't like 'em.' Bad-tempered eyebrows,
supercilious eyebrows, calm eyebrows, worried eyebrows&mdash;it was
the eyebrows that gave a face its keynote. And it was the slant of
the black eyebrows that had given that thin white face on the
pillow its reckless look even in death.</p>

<p>Well, the man had been sober when he wrote those words, that at
least was clear. That toper's oblivion in compartment B
Seven&mdash;the fugged air, the rucked blankets, the empty bottle
rolling about on the floor, the overturned glass on the
shelf&mdash;may have been the Paradise he sought, but he was sober
when he blue-printed the way to it.</p>

<p>The singing sand.</p>

<p>Uncanny but somehow attractive.</p>

<p>Singing sand. Surely there actually were singing sands
somewhere? It had a vaguely familiar sound. Singing sands. They
cried out under your feet as you walked. Or the wind did it, or
something. A man's forearm in a checked tweed sleeve reached in
front of him and took a bap from the plate.</p>

<p>'You seem to be doing yourself very well,' Tommy said, pulling
out a chair and sitting down. He split the bap and buttered it.
'There's no chew in these things at all nowadays. When I was a boy
you sank your teeth in them and pulled. It was evens which came
away first: your teeth or the bit of bap. But if your teeth won you
really had something worth having. A nice floury, yeasty mouthful
that would last you for a couple of minutes. They don't taste of
anything nowadays, and you could fold them in two and put the whole
thing in your mouth without any danger of choking yourself.'</p>

<p>Grant looked at him in silence and with affection. There was no
intimacy so close, he thought, as the intimacy that bound you to a
man with whom you'd shared a Prep. school dorm. They had shared
their public school days too, but it was Prep. school that he
remembered each time he encountered Tommy anew. Perhaps because in
all essentials that fresh pinky-brown face with the round ingenuous
blue eyes was the same face that used to appear above a
crookedly-buttoned maroon blazer. Tommy had always buttoned his
blazer with a fine insouciance.</p>

<p>It was so like Tommy not to waste time or vitality on
conventional inquiries as to his journey and his health. Neither
would Laura, of course. They would accept him as he stood; as if he
had been there for some time. As if he had never gone away at all
but was still on his previous visit. It was an extraordinarily
restful atmosphere to sink back into.</p>

<p>'How is Laura?'</p>

<p>'Never better. Putting on a bit of weight. At least that's what
she says. Don't see it myself. I never liked skinny women.'</p>

<p>There had been a time, when they were both about twenty, when
Grant had thought of marrying his cousin Laura; and she, he had
been sure, had had thoughts of marrying him. But before any word
had been said the magic had faded and they were back on the old
friendly footing. The magic had been part of the long intoxication
of a Highland summer. Part of hill mornings smelling of pine
needles, and of endless twilights sweet with the scent of clover.
For Grant his cousin Laura had always been part of the happiness of
summer holidays; they had graduated together from burn-paddling to
their first fishing-rods, and together they had first walked the
Larig and together had stood for the first time on the top of
Braeriach. But it was not until that summer at the end of their
adolescence that the happiness had crystallised into Laura herself;
that the whole of summer was focused into the person of Laura
Grant. He still had a slight lifting of the heart when he thought
of that summer. It had the light perfection, the iridescence, of a
bubble. And because no word had been said the bubble would never
now be broken. It stayed light and perfect and iridescent and
poised, where they had left it. They had both gone on to other
things; to other people. Laura indeed had skipped from one person
to the next one with the bright indifference of a child playing
hop-scotch. And then he had taken her to that Old Boys' dance. And
she had met Tommy Rankin. And that had been that.</p>

<p>'What's the fuss at the station?' Tommy asked. 'Ambulances and
things.'</p>

<p>'A man died on the train. I expect it is that.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said Tommy, dismissing it. 'Not your funeral this time,'
he added in a congratulatory way.</p>

<p>'No. Not my funeral, thank Heaven.'</p>

<p>'They'll miss you on the Embankment.'</p>

<p>'I doubt it.'</p>

<p>'Mary,' said Tommy, 'I could do with a pot of good strong tea.'
He flicked the plate that held the baps with a contemptuous
forefinger. 'And another couple of these poor bargains.' He turned
his serious childlike gaze on Grant and said: 'They'll have to miss
you. They'll be one short, won't they?'</p>

<p>Grant expelled his breath in the nearest he had come to a laugh
for months. Tommy had been commiserating with Headquarters, not on
the loss of his genius, but on the lack of his presence. His
'family' attitude had been almost identical with the professional
reaction of his Chief. 'Sick leave!' Bryce had said, his little
elephant eyes running over Grant's healthy-looking frame and coming
back to his face with disgust. 'Well, well! What is the Force
coming to! In my young days you stayed on duty until you fell over.
And you went on writing up your notes until the ambulance carted
you away off the floor.' It had not been easy to tell Bryce what
the doctor had said, and Bryce had not made it any easier. Bryce
had never had a nerve of any sort in his body; he was mere physical
force animated by a shrewd if limited brain. There had been neither
comprehension nor sympathy in his reception of Grant's news.
Indeed, there had been a subtle suggestion, a mere whiff of an
implication, that Grant was malingering. That this so-strange
breakdown that left him so markedly well and fit in appearance had
something to do with the spring run in Highland rivers; that he had
already arranged his fishing flies before going to Wimpole
Street.</p>

<p>'What will they do to fill the gap?' Tommy asked.</p>

<p>'Promote Sergeant Williams, probably. His promotion is long
overdue anyhow.'</p>

<p>It had been no easier to tell the faithful Williams. When your
subordinate has openly hero-worshipped you for years it is not
pleasant to have to appear before him as a poor nerve-ridden
creature at the mercy of non-existent demons. Williams, too, had
never had a nerve in his body. He took everything as it came,
placid and unquestioning. It had not been easy to tell Williams and
see the admiration change to concern. To&mdash;pity?</p>

<p>'Push over the marmalade,' Tommy said.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">THE peace induced by Tommy's matter-of-fact
acceptance of him deepened as they drove into the hills. These two
accepted him; standing around in a detached benevolence, watching
him come in a familiar quiet. It was a grey morning, and still. The
landscape was tidy and bare. Tidy grey walls round bare fields,
bare fences along the tidy ditches. Nothing had begun to grow yet
in this waiting countryside. Only a willow here and there by a
culvert side showed live and green in the half-shades.</p>

<p>It was going to be all right. This is what he had needed; this
wide silence, this space, this serenity. He had forgotten how
benevolent the place was; how satisfying. The near hills were round
and green and kind; beyond them were farther ones, stained blue by
the distance. And behind all stood the long rampart of the Highland
line, white and remote against the calm sky.</p>

<p>'The river is very low, isn't it?' he said, as they came down
into the valley of the Turlie. And was invaded by panic.</p>

<p>That was the way it always happened. One moment a sane, free,
self-possessed human being, and the next a helpless creature in the
grip of unreason. He pressed his hands together to keep himself
from flinging the door open and tried to listen to what Tommy was
saying. No rain for weeks. They had had no rain for weeks. Let him
think about the lack of rain. It was important, the lack of rain.
It spoiled the fishing. It was to fish he had come to Clune. If
they didn't have rain there would be no run of fish. No water for
them. Oh God, help me not to make Tommy stop! No water. Think
intelligently about fishing. If they had had no rain for weeks then
rain must be due, mustn't it? Why could you ask a friend to stop
the car and let you be sick and yet not ask him to stop the car so
that you could get out of its small shut-in-ness? Look at the
river. <i>Look</i> at it. Remember things about it. That was where
you caught your best fish last year. That was where Pat slipped
down when he was sitting on the rock and was left hanging by the
seat of his pants.</p>

<p>'As nice a clean-run fish as ever you saw,' Tommy was
saying.</p>

<p>The hazels by the river made a bright mauve smudge in the
grey-green of the moor. Presently, when it was summer-time, the
cold clattering of their leaves would make an obbligato to the
river's song, but just now they stood in a pink silent huddle along
the bank.</p>

<p>Tommy, looking at the state of the water, also noticed the bare
hazel twigs, but being a parent he was not moved to think of summer
afternoons. 'Pat has discovered that he is a diviner,' he said.</p>

<p>That was better. Think about Pat. Talk about Pat.</p>

<p>'The house is strewn with twigs of all shapes and sizes.'</p>

<p>'Has he discovered anything?' If he could keep his mind on Pat
it might be all right.</p>

<p>'He has discovered gold under the sitting-room hearth, a body
under the whatyoumaycallem in the downstairs bathroom, and two
wells.'</p>

<p>'Where are the wells?' It couldn't be so very long now. Five
miles to the head of the glen and Clune.</p>

<p>'One under the dining-room floor and one under the kitchen
passage.'</p>

<p>'I take it that you haven't dug up the sitting-room hearth.' The
window was wide open. What was there to worry about? It wasn't
really a closed space, not a closed space at all.</p>

<p>'We have not. He is very peeved about that. Said I was a
once-born.'</p>

<p>'Once-born?'</p>

<p>'Yes. It's his latest word. It ranks just one degree below a
stinker, I understand.'</p>

<p>'Where did he get the word?' He would hang on till they got to
that birch wood at the corner. Then he would ask Tommy to stop.</p>

<p>'Don't know. From some Theosophist woman who talked to the
W.R.I, last autumn, I should think.'</p>

<p>Why should he mind Tommy's knowing? There was nothing shameful
about it. If he were a paralysed syphilitic he would accept Tommy's
help and sympathy. Why should he want to keep from Tommy's
knowledge the fact that he was sweating with terror because of
something that didn't exist? Perhaps he could cheat? Perhaps he
could just ask Tommy to stop for a little while he admired the
view?</p>

<p>Here was the birch wood. At least he had lasted that far.</p>

<p>He would make it the bit of road level with the bend of the
river. He would make the excuse of having a look at the water. Much
more plausible than looking at the view. Tommy would look with
alacrity at a river and only with passive protest at a view.</p>

<p>About fifty seconds more. One, two, three, four....</p>

<p>Now.</p>

<p>'We lost two sheep in that pool this winter,' Tommy said,
sweeping past the bend.</p>

<p>Too late.</p>

<p>What other excuse could he make? He was too near Clune now for
excuses to be easy to find.</p>

<p>He could not even light a cigarette in case his hands were
shaking too much.</p>

<p>Perhaps if he did something, however trivial....</p>

<p>He took the bundle of papers from the seat by his side,
rearranging them, shuffling them busily and without point. He
noticed that the <i>Signal</i> was not among them. He had meant to
take it with him because of the odd little tentative verse in the
Stop Press, but he must have left it in the hotel dining-room. Oh,
well. It didn't matter. It had served its turn in giving interest
to his breakfast. And the owner certainly would not want it again.
He had achieved his Paradise, his oblivion; if that is what he had
wanted. Not for him the privilege of uncontrolled hands and
sweating skin. The privilege of wrestling with demons. Not for him
the clean morning, the kind earth, the loveliness of the Highland
line against the sky.</p>

<p>For the first time it occurred to him to wonder what had brought
the young man to the North.</p>

<p>He had not, presumably, engaged a first-class sleeping
compartment just to drink himself insensible in. He had had an
intended destination. He had had business and desire. A
purpose.</p>

<p>Why had he come to the North at this bleak unfashionable season?
To fish? To climb? The compartment as he remembered it had given an
impression of bareness, but the heavy luggage might have been under
the bunk. Or, indeed, in the van. Apart from sport what was
there?</p>

<p>Official business?</p>

<p>Not with that face; no.</p>

<p>An actor? An artist? Just possibly.</p>

<p>A sailor going to join his ship? Going to some naval base beyond
Inverness? That was possible. The face would look very well on the
bridge of a ship. A small ship; very fast; and hellish in any kind
of a sea.</p>

<p>What else was there? What would bring a dark, thin young man
with reckless eyebrows and a passion for alcohol to the Highlands
at the beginning of March? Unless in these days of whisky shortage
he had had thoughts of starting an illicit still?</p>

<p>It was a pleasant idea, at that. How easy would it be? Not as
easy as in Ireland, because the will to lawlessness was lacking;
but once you had achieved it the whisky would be a great deal
better. He almost wished that he could have put the idea to the
young man. Could have sat opposite him at dinner last night,
perhaps, and watched the gleam come into his eye at the thought of
such delicious flouting of the Law. He wished that he could have
talked to him anyway; exchanged ideas with him; found out about
him. If someone had talked with him last night he might now be part
of this living morning, of this fine gracious world with its gifts
and its promise, instead of&mdash;</p>

<p>'And gaffed him in the pool below the footbridge,' said Tommy,
finishing a story.</p>

<p>Grant looked down at his hands, and found that they were
still.</p>

<p>The dead young man, who could not save himself, had saved
him.</p>

<p>He looked up and saw in front of him the white house of Clune.
It lay in the green cup of the hill, alone except for its attendant
slab of sheltering fir-wood stuck like some dark green wool-work on
the bare landscape. A blue curl of smoke rose up from the chimney
into the still air. It was the fine essence of peace.</p>

<p>As they drove up the sandy track from the road he saw Laura come
out of the door and stand waiting for them. She waved to them, and
as her arm came down from its wave she tucked in the strand of hair
that fell on to her forehead. The familiar gesture warmed his
chilled being. Just so she used to be waiting on the little
Badenoch platform for him when she was a child; with just that wave
and that tucking-in of a strand of hair. The same strand of
hair.</p>

<p>'Damn,' said Tommy, 'I forgot to post her letters. Don't mention
it unless she asks.'</p>

<p>Laura kissed him on both cheeks, took one look at him, and
said:</p>

<p>'I have a lovely bird for your lunch, but you look as if a good
long sleep would do you more good. So go straight up and have it
and forget about food until you waken. We have weeks to gossip in,
so we don't have to start right now.'</p>

<p>Only Laura, he thought, would have streamlined her hostess rôle
to a guest's need so neatly. No subtle touting of the beautifully
planned luncheon; no concealed blackmail. She did not even ply one
with unwanted cups of tea, nor pointedly recommend her fine hot
bath-water. She did not even demand the small-chat of arrival, the
polite hanging around. She supplied without question and without
hesitation the thing that he needed. A pillow.</p>

<p>He wondered whether it was that he looked a wreck or whether it
was just that Laura knew him so well. It occurred to him that he
would not mind Laura's knowing about his bondage of fear. It was
odd that where he had shrunk from exhibiting his weakness to Tommy
he should not care that Laura might learn about it. It should have
been the other way about.</p>

<p>'I have put you in the other bedroom this time,' she said
preceding him up the stairs, 'because the west one has been done up
and it still stinks a bit.'</p>

<p>She was in truth putting on weight a little, he noticed; but her
ankles were as good as ever. And then, with that native detachment
that never quite deserted him, he realised that his lack of any
desire to conceal from Laura his childish fits of panic was proof
that no small remote part of him was still in love with her. The
need of the male to look well in the eyes of the beloved one was no
part of his relation with Laura.</p>

<p>'People always say about east bedrooms that they get the morning
sun,' she said, standing in the middle of the east bedroom and
looking at it as if she had never seen it before. 'As if it were a
recommendation. I think myself it's much nicer to be able to look
out on a sunny landscape. Which you can't do with the sun in your
eyes.' She stuck her thumbs in her waistband and eased the belt
that was growing too tight. 'But the west room will be habitable in
a day or two, so you can change over then if you want to. How is my
dear Sergeant Williams?'</p>

<p>'Pink and clean.'</p>

<p>He had an instant picture of Williams, sitting solid and shy at
the tea-table in the lounge of the Westmorland. He had been on his
way out after a session with the manager and had come across Laura
and Grant having tea, and had been persuaded to join them. He had
made a great success with Laura.</p>

<p>'You know, whenever this country is in one of its periodic
messes, I think of Sergeant Williams and am quite sure on the
instant that everything is going to be all right.'</p>

<p>'I suppose <i>I</i> don't reassure you at all,' Grant said, busy
unstrapping luggage.</p>

<p>'Not noticeably. Not that way, anyway. You'd only be a comfort
if everything <i>wasn't</i> going to be all right.' With which
cryptic statement she left him. 'Don't come down until you want to.
Don't come down at all, if it comes to that. Just ring when you
waken.'</p>

<p>Her footsteps went away down the passage, and the silence
flooded in behind her.</p>

<p>He stripped off his clothes and without bothering to pull a
curtain over the light he fell into bed. Presently he thought: I'd
better draw those curtains or the light may waken me too soon. He
opened his eyes reluctantly, to gauge the degree of light, and
found that the light was no longer coming in at the window at all.
It was lying on the out-of-doors instead. He lifted his head from
the pillow to consider this oddity, and realised that it was late
afternoon.</p>

<p>Relaxed and amused, he turned on to his back and lay listening
to the quiet. The immemorial quiet. He savoured it, and luxuriated
in his long reprieve. Not an enclosed space between this and the
Pentland Firth. Between this and the North Pole, if it came to
that. Through the wide-open window he could see the evening sky,
still grey but faintly luminous and streaked with level cloud. No
rain in that sky; only an echo of the peace that held the world in
this contented quiet. Oh, well, if he could not fish he could walk.
If the worst came to the worst he could shoot rabbits.</p>

<p>He watched the level clouds darken against their background and
wondered whom Laura would have got for him to marry this time. It
was an extraordinary thing how all married women were banded
together against the state of singleness in man. If the women were
happily married, like Laura, they considered marriage the only
satisfactory state for an adult not suffering from any marked
incapacity or relevant hindrance. If they were unhappily yoked,
then they were filled with resentment of anyone who had escaped
such punishment. Each time that he came to Clune, Laura was in the
habit of producing some carefully vetted female for his
consideration. Nothing was ever said about their desirable
qualities, of course; they were just trotted up and down in front
of him so that he might view their paces. Nor, when he showed no
particular interest in a candidate, was there any overt regret in
the atmosphere; any suggestion of reproof. All that happened was
that next time Laura had a new idea.</p>

<p>Somewhere, far away, was a sound that was either the lazy
clucking of a hen or the clash of teacups being assembled. He
listened for a little, hoping that it was a hen, but decided with
regret that it was tea in preparation. He must get up. Pat would be
home from school, and Bridget awake from her afternoon nap. It was
quite typically Laura that she should not even have demanded from
him a due admiration of her daughter; that he had not been asked to
exclaim over her growth in the last year, her intelligence, her
looks. Bridget had not been mentioned at all. She was merely a
young creature somewhere out of sight, like the rest of the farm
animals.</p>

<p>He got up and went to have a bath. And twenty minutes later he
went downstairs conscious that he was hungry for the first time for
months.</p>

<p>The family picture upon which the sitting-room door opened was
pure Zoffany, he thought. The sitting-room at Clune occupied almost
the whole of what had been the original farmhouse and was now a
small wing to the main building. Because it had once been several
rooms instead of one it had more windows than are usual in its
kind; because it had thick walls it was warm and safe-feeling; and
because it had a south-west outlook it was brighter than most. So
all the traffic of the house was concentrated there, as in the hall
of some medieval manor. Only at luncheon and supper was any other
room used by the family. A large round table by the fire ensured
the comforts of 'dining-room' meals at tea and breakfast, and the
rest of the room was a fine free mixture of office, drawing-room,
music-room, schoolroom and greenhouse. Johan, Grant thought, would
not have had to alter one detail. It was all there already, even to
the cadging terrier at the table and Bridget splay-legged on the
hearthrug.</p>

<p>Bridget was a blonde, silent child of three who spent her days
endlessly rearranging the same few objects into new patterns. 'I
can't make up my mind whether she is mentally deficient or a
genius,' Laura said. But Grant thought that the two-second glance
with which Bridget favoured him on introduction entirely justified
the cheerfulness of Laura's tone; there was nothing wrong with the
intelligence of The Child, as Patrick called her. This epithet as
used by Pat had no sense of opprobrium; nor even any marked
condescension; it merely emphasised his own inclusion in the adult
group, to which his six years seniority in his own estimation
entitled him.</p>

<p>Pat had red hair, and a bleak and intimidating grey eye. He was
wearing a tattered green tartan kilt, smoke-blue stockings, and a
much-darned grey jersey. His greeting to Grant was off-hand but
reassuringly uncouth. Pat spoke from choice what his mother called
'clotted Perthshire', his bosom friend at the village school being
the shepherd's son, who hailed from Killin. He could, of course,
when he had a mind, speak faultless English, but it was always a
bad sign. When Pat was 'not speaking' to you he was always not
speaking in the best English.</p>

<p>Over tea, Grant asked him if he had yet made up his mind what he
was going to be; Pat's invariable answer to the question from the
age of four having been: 'A'm taking it into avizandum.' A phrase
borrowed from his J.P. father.</p>

<p>'Ay,' said Pat, spreading jam with a liberal hand. 'A've made up
muh mind.'</p>

<p>'You have? That's fine. What are you going to be?'</p>

<p>'A revolutionary.'</p>

<p>'I hope I never have to arrest you.'</p>

<p>'Yu couldna,' said Pat simply.</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'A'll be <i>good</i>, man,' said Pat, dipping the spoon
again.</p>

<p>'I'm sure that's the sense Queen Victoria used the word in,'
Laura said, removing the jam from her son's possession.</p>

<p>It was for that sort of thing that he had loved her. The odd
glinting detachment that shot the texture of her maternalism.</p>

<p>'I have a fish for you,' Pat said, scraping the jam to one side
of the slice of bread, so that it would, over at least half the
surface, achieve the required depth. (What he actually said was:
'Ah hiv a fush forrya,' but Pat's phonetics are no pleasanter to
the eye than they are on the ear, and may be left to the
imagination.) 'Under the ledge in the Cuddy Pool. You can have a
len' of my fly, if you like.'</p>

<p>Since Pat possessed a large tin box full of assorted invitations
to slaughter, 'my fly' in the singular could only mean 'the fly I
have invented'.</p>

<p>'What is Pat's lure like?' he asked when Pat had taken himself
off.</p>

<p>'Actionable, I should say,' said his mother. 'A fearsome
object.'</p>

<p>'Does he catch anything with it?'</p>

<p>'Oddly enough, yes,' Tommy said. 'I suppose there are suckers in
the fish world just the same as in any other.'</p>

<p>'The poor things just gape with astonishment at sight of it,'
Laura said, 'and before they have time to shut their mouths the
current has swept it in. Tomorrow's Saturday, so you can see it in
operation. But I don't think that anything, even Pat's unholy
creation, will lure that six-pounder in the Cuddy Pool to the
surface with the water the way it is just now.'</p>

<p>And of course Laura was right. Saturday morning was bright and
rainless and the six-pounder in the Cuddy Pool was far too dismayed
by his imprisonment, far too obsessed with his desire to go higher
up the river, to be interested in surface distractions. So it was
suggested that Grant should go trout fishing in the loch, with Pat
as gillie. The loch was two miles away in the hills, a flat pool on
a bleak bit of moor. When it was windy on Lochan Dhu the gale took
your line out of the water at right angles and held it stiff as a
telephone wire. When it was calm the midges made a meal of you
while the trout came to the surface and openly laughed. But if
trout fishing was not Grant's idea of the perfect occupation, being
gillie was obviously Patrick's idea of heaven. There was nothing,
from riding the black bull down at Dalmore to demanding
threepence-worth of sweets from Mrs Mair at the post-office with
the aid of a ha'penny and menaces, that Pat was not capable of. But
the joy of messing about in a boat was still something that he
could not provide for himself. The boat at the loch was
padlocked.</p>

<p>So Grant set off up the sandy path through the dry heather, with
Pat at his side and one pace in the rear like a gun dog on its best
behaviour. And as he went he was conscious of his own reluctance
and wondered at it.</p>

<p>Why should there be any qualification in his pleasure this
morning, in his delight in going fishing? Brown trout might not be
his idea of a sporting contest, but he was glad enough to be
spending the day with a rod in his hand even if he caught nothing
whatever. He was supremely glad to be out in the open, alive and at
leisure, with the familiar spring of peaty turf under his feet, and
the hills before him. Why the small unwillingness at the back of
his mind? Why, instead of taking a boat out for the day on Lochan
Dhu, did he want to hang round the farm?</p>

<p>They had walked for a mile before he had flushed the reason from
the cover of his subconscious. He had wanted to stay at Clune today
so that he could see the daily paper when it arrived.</p>

<p>He had wanted to find out about B Seven.</p>

<p>His conscious mind had dropped B Seven behind, with the
tribulations of the journey and the memory of his humiliation. He
had not consciously remembered him from the moment when he fell
into bed on arrival until now, nearly twenty-four hours later. But
B Seven was still with him, it would seem.</p>

<p>'When does the daily paper arrive at Clune these days?' he asked
Pat, still silent and on his best behaviour one pace in the
rear.</p>

<p>'If it's Johnny it comes at twelve, but if it's Kenny it's often
near one before it comes.' And Pat added, as if glad to have
conversation introduced into the expeditionary routine, 'Kenny
stops to have a cup at Dalmore, east the road. He's gone on the
MacFadyean's Kirsty.'</p>

<p>A world where the news of the nations' clamour waited while
Kenny had a cup from the MacFadyean's Kirsty was a very pleasant
one, Grant thought. In the days before radio it must have bordered
on Paradise.</p>

<p>'<i>That guard the way to Paradise.</i>'</p>

<p>The singing sands.</p>

<p><i>The beasts that talk,<br>
The streams that stand,<br>
The stones that walk,<br>
The singing sand</i>...</p>

<p>What had it stood for? <i>Was</i> it just a country of the
mind?</p>

<p>Out here in the open, in this elemental land, it had an
appropriateness that somehow lessened its strangeness. It was quite
possible to believe this morning that there were places on this
earth where stones might walk. Were there not places, known places,
even in the Highlands where a man alone in the bright sunlight of a
summer day could be invaded by the knowledge of unseen watchers, so
that he was filled with a great fear and ran panic-stricken from
the place? Yes, and without any previous interviews in Wimpole
Street, either. In the 'old' places anything was possible. Even
beasts that talked.</p>

<p>Where had B Seven got his idea of strangeness?</p>

<p>They launched the light boat from its wooden runway, and Grant
pulled out into the loch and made for the windward end. It was much
too bright, but there was a breath of air that might lift to a
breeze strong enough to put a ripple on the surface. He watched Pat
put his rod together and bend a fly on the line, and thought that
if he could not have the felicity of possessing a son then a small
red-headed cousin made a very good substitute.</p>

<p>'Did you ever present a bouquet, Alan?' asked Pat, busy with the
fly. He called it 'a bookey'.</p>

<p>'Not that I can remember,' Grant said carefully. 'Why?'</p>

<p>'They're at me to present a bookey to a Viscountess that's
coming to open the Dalmore hall.'</p>

<p>'Hall?'</p>

<p>'That shed place at the cross-roads,' Pat said bitterly. He was
silent a moment, evidently mulling it over. 'It's an awful
jessie-like thing to present a bookey.'</p>

<p>Grant, bound in duty to the absent Laura, searched his mind.
'It's a great honour,' he said.</p>

<p>'Then let The Child have the honour.'</p>

<p>'She is a little young yet for such responsibility.'</p>

<p>'Well, if she's too young for such responsibility I'm too old
for such capers. So they'll have to get some other family to do it.
It's all havers anyway. The hall's been open for months.'</p>

<p>To this disillusioned contempt for adult pretence Grant had no
answer.</p>

<p>They fished turn-about, in a fine male amity; Grant flicking his
line with a lazy indifference, Pat with the incurable optimism of
his kind. By noon they had drifted back to a point level with the
little jetty, and they turned in-shore to make tea on the primus in
the little bothy. As Grant was paddling the last few yards he saw
Pat's eye fixed on something along the shore, and turned to see
what occasioned such marked distaste. Having looked at the
advancing figure with its shoggly body and inappropriate
magnificence, he asked who that might be.</p>

<p>'That's Wee Archie,' said Pat.</p>

<p>Wee Archie was wielding a shepherd's crook that, as Tommy
remarked later, no shepherd would be found dead with, and he was
wearing a kilt that no Highlander would dream of being found alive
in. The crook stood nearly two feet above his head; and the kilt
hung down at the back from his non-existent hips like a draggled
petticoat. But it was obvious that the wearer was conscious of no
lack. The tartan of his sad little skirt screamed like a peacock,
raucous and alien against the moor. His small dark eel's head was
crowned by a pale blue Balmoral with a diced band, the bonnet being
pulled down sideways at such a dashing angle that the slack covered
his right ear. On the upper side a large piece of vegetation
sprouted from the crest on the band. The socks on the hairpin legs
were a brilliant blue, and so hairy in texture that they gave the
effect of some unfortunate growth. Round the meagre ankles the
thongs of the brogues were cross-gartered with a verve that even
Malvolio had never achieved.</p>

<p>'What is he doing round here?' Grant asked, fascinated.</p>

<p>'He lives at the inn at Moymore.'</p>

<p>'Oh. What does he do?'</p>

<p>'He's a revolutionary.'</p>

<p>'Really? Is that the same revolution as yours?'</p>

<p>'Nah!' said Pat in great scorn. 'Oh, I'm not saying maybe he
didn't put the idea in my head. But no one would take heed of the
likes of him. He writes pomes.'</p>

<p>'I take it that he is a once-born.'</p>

<p>'Him! He's not born at all, man. He's a&mdash;a&mdash;a
<i>egg</i>.'</p>

<p>Grant concluded that the word Pat had sought was amoeba, but
that knowledge had not reached so far. The lowest form of life he
knew of was the egg.</p>

<p>The 'egg' came blithely towards them along the stony beach,
swinging the tail of his deplorable petticoat with a fine swagger
that went ill with his hirpling movement over the stones. Grant was
suddenly convinced that he had corns. Corns on thin pink feet that
sweated easily. The kind of feet people were always writing to
medical columns in the Press about. (Wash every evening without
fail and dry thoroughly, especially between the toes. Dust well
with talcum powder and put on fresh socks each morning.)</p>

<p>'<i>Cia mar tha si?</i>' he called as he came within hailing
distance.</p>

<p>Was it just chance, Grant wondered, that all cranky people had
that thin bodyless voice? Or was it that thin bodyless voices
belonged to the failures and the frustrated and that frustration
and failure bred the desire to repudiate the herd?</p>

<p>He had not heard that Gaelic phrase since he was a child, and
the affectation of it cooled his welcome. He bade the man
good-morning.</p>

<p>'Patrick should have told you that it was too bright to fish
today,' he said, swinging up to them. Grant did not know which
displeased him more: the vile Glasgow speech or the unwarranted
patronage.</p>

<p>The freckles on Pat's fair skin were lost in a red tide. Speech
trembled on his lips.</p>

<p>'I expect he didn't want to do me out of my pleasure,' Grant
said smoothly; and watched the tide recede and a slow appreciation
dawn. Pat had discovered that there were more effective ways of
dealing with folly than direct attack. It was a quite new idea and
he was trying the taste of it, rolling it on his tongue.</p>

<p>'You've come ashore for your elevenses, I take it,' Wee Archie
said brightly. 'I'll be glad to join you if you've no
objection.'</p>

<p>So they made tea for Wee Archie, glum and polite. He produced
his own sandwiches, and while they ate he lectured them on the
glory of Scotland; its mighty past and dazzling future. He had not
asked Grant's name and was betrayed by his speech into taking him
for an Englishman. Surprised, Grant heard of England's iniquities
to a captive and helpless Scotland. (Anything less captive or less
helpless than the Scotland he had known would be difficult to
imagine.) England, it seemed, was a blood-sucker, a vampire,
draining the good blood of Scotland and leaving her limp and white.
Scotland had groaned under the foreign yoke, she had come
staggering behind the conqueror's chariot, she had paid tribute and
prostituted her talents to the tyrant's needs. But she was about to
throw off the yoke, to unloose the bands; the fiery cross was about
to be sent out once more, and soon the heather would be alight.
There was no cliché that Wee Archie spared them.</p>

<p>Grant watched him with the interest one accords to a new exhibit
in a collection. He decided that the man was older than he had
thought. Forty-five at least; probably nearer fifty. Too old to be
curable. Whatever success he had coveted had passed him by; there
would never be anything for him but his pitiable fancy-dress and
his clichés.</p>

<p>He looked across to see what effect this perversion of
patriotism was having on Young Scotland, and rejoiced in his heart.
Young Scotland was sitting facing the loch, as if even the sight of
Wee Archie was too much for him. He was chewing in a dogged
detachment, and his eye reminded Grant of Flurry Knox: 'an eye like
a stone wall with broken glass on top'. The revolutionaries would
want heavier guns than Archie to make any impression on their
countrymen.</p>

<p>Grant wondered what the creature lived on. 'Pomes' did not
provide a living. Nor did free-lance journalism; or, rather, the
kind of journalism that Archie was likely to write. Perhaps he
scraped a living from 'criticism'. It was from the ranks of the
ineffective that the minor critics were recruited. There was always
the chance, of course, that he was subsidised; if not by some
native malcontent with a thirst for power, then by some foreign
agency with an interest in trouble-making. He was of a type very
familiar to the Special Branch: the failure, sick of a curdled
vanity.</p>

<p>Grant, still hankering after that midday newspaper that Johnny
or Kenny was due to deliver at Clune, had had thoughts of
suggesting to Pat that they call it a day, and give up enticing
fish that had no intention of biting. But if they went now they
would have to walk back in Wee Archie's company, and that was
something to be avoided. So he prepared to resume his idle flicking
of the loch water.</p>

<p>But Archie, it seemed, was anxious to make one of the fishing
party. If there was room in the boat for a third passenger, he
said, he would be glad to accompany them.</p>

<p>Again speech trembled on Pat's lips.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Grant, 'do come. You can help to bale.'</p>

<p>'Bale?' said the saviour of Scotland, blenching.</p>

<p>'Yes. Her seams are not too good. She makes a lot of water.'</p>

<p>On second thoughts Archie decided that perhaps after all it was
time that he was wending his way (Archie never went anywhere, he
always wended his way) towards Moymore. The post would be in, and
there would be his mail to deal with. And then, lest it might cross
their minds that he was unused to boats, he told them how good he
was in a boat. It was thanks only to his skill in a boat that he
and four others had reached a Hebridean beach alive last summer. He
told the tale with a growing verve that gave rise to a base
suspicion that he was making it up as he went along, and having
finished he switched hastily from the subject, as if afraid of
questions, and asked if Grant knew the islands.</p>

<p>Grant, locking up the bothy and pocketing the key, said that he
did not. Whereupon Archie made him free of them with a proprietor's
generosity. The herring fleets of Lewis, the cliffs of Mingulay,
the songs of Barra, the hills of Harris, the wild flowers of
Benbecula, and the sands, the endless wonderful white sand, of
Berneray.</p>

<p>'The sands don't sing, I suppose,' Grant said, putting bounds to
the boasting. He stepped into the boat, and pushed off.</p>

<p>'No,' said Wee Archie, 'no. They're in Cladda.'</p>

<p>'What are?' asked Grant, startled.</p>

<p>'The singing sands. Well, good fishing to you, but it's not a
day for fishing, you know. Much too bright.'</p>

<p>And with this kindly pat on the head he re-erected his
shepherd's crook, and swung away along the shore towards Moymore
and his letters. Grant stood motionless in the boat, watching him
go. When he was nearly beyond earshot he called to him
suddenly:</p>

<p>'Are there any walking stones on Cladda?'</p>

<p>'What?' said Archie's inadequate pipe.</p>

<p>'Are there <i>any walking stones on Cladda</i>?'</p>

<p>'No. They're in Lewis.'</p>

<p>And the dragonfly creature with its mosquito voice went away
into the brown distance.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">THEY came home at tea-time with five
unimpressive-looking trout and large appetites. Pat, excusing the
thin trout, pointed out that on such a day you couldn't expect to
catch any but what he called 'the sillies'; the respect-worthy fish
had more sense than to be caught in such weather. They came down
the last half-mile to Clune like homing horses, Pat skipping from
turf to turf like a young goat and as voluble as he had been silent
on the way out. The world and London river seemed the width of
stellar space away, and Grant would not have called the King his
cousin.</p>

<p>But as they scraped their shoes at the flagged doorway of Clune,
he became aware of his unreasonable impatience to see that
newspaper. And since he resented unreason in anyone and abominated
it in himself he carefully scraped his shoes all over a second
time.</p>

<p>'Man, you're awfully particular,' said Pat, giving his footgear
a rudimentary wipe on the twin scraper.</p>

<p>'It's a boorish thing to go into a house with mud on one's
shoes.'</p>

<p>'Boorish?' asked Pat, who, as Grant suspected, held it a
'jessie-like' thing to be clean.</p>

<p>'Yes. Slovenly and un-grown-up.'</p>

<p>'Huh,' said Pat; and surreptitiously scraped his shoes again.
'It's a poor house that can't stand a few dollops of mud,' he said,
reasserting his independence, and went storming into the
sitting-room like an invading army.</p>

<p>In the sitting-room Tommy was dripping honey on to a hot scone,
Laura was pouring tea, Bridget was arranging a new set of objects
in a design on the floor, and the terrier was on the make round the
table. Except that sunlight had been added to firelight it was the
same picture as last night. With one difference. Somewhere in the
room there was a daily paper that mattered.</p>

<p>Laura, seeing his searching eye, asked him if he was looking for
something.</p>

<p>'Yes, the daily paper.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Bella has it.' Bella was the cook. 'I'll get it from her
after tea if you want to see it.'</p>

<p>He had a moment of stinging impatience with her. She was far too
complacent. She was far too happy, here in her fastness, with her
laden tea-table, and her little roll of fat above the belt, and her
healthy children, and her nice Tommy, and her security. It would do
her good to have some demons to fight; to be swung out in space and
held over some bottomless pit now and then. But his own absurdity
rescued him, and he knew that it was not so. There was no
complacence in Laura's happiness, nor was Clune any refuge from the
realities. The two young sheep-dogs who had welcomed them at the
road gate in a swirl of black-and-white bodies and lashing tails
would once upon a time have been called Moss, or Glen, or Trim or
something like that. Today, he had noticed, they answered to Tong
and Zang. The waters of the Chindwin had long ago flowed into the
Turlie. There were no Ivory Towers any more.</p>

<p>'There is <i>The Times</i>, of course,' Laura said, 'but it is
always yesterday's, so you will have seen it.'</p>

<p>'Who is Wee Archie?' he asked, sitting down at the table.</p>

<p>'So you've met Archie Brown, have you?' Tommy said, clapping the
top half on his hot scone, and licking the honey that oozed from
it.</p>

<p>'Is that his name?'</p>

<p>'It used to be. Since he elected himself the champion of Gaeldom
he calls himself Gilleasbuig Mac-a'-Bruithainn. He's frightfully
unpopular at hotels.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'How would <i>you</i> like to page someone called Gilleasbuig
Mac-a'-Bruithainn?'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't like to have him under my roof at all. What is he
doing here?'</p>

<p>'He's writing an epic poem in Gaelic, so he says. He didn't know
any Gaelic until about two years ago, so I don't think the poem can
be up to much. He used to belong to the cleesh-clavers-clatter
school. You know: the Lowland-Scots boys. He was one of them for
years. But he didn't get anywhere very much. The competition was
too keen. So he decided that Lowland Scots was just debased English
and very reprehensible, and that there was nothing like a return to
the "old tongue", to a real language. So he "sat under" a bank
clerk in Glasgow, a chap from Uist, and swotted up some Gaelic. He
comes to the back door and talks to Bella now and then, but she
says she doesn't understand a word. She thinks he's "not right in
the head".'</p>

<p>'There's nothing wrong with Archie Brown's head,' Laura said
tartly. 'If he hadn't had the wit to think up this rôle for himself
he would be teaching school in some god-forsaken backwater and even
the school inspector wouldn't have known his name.'</p>

<p>'He's very conspicuous on a moor, anyhow,' Grant said.</p>

<p>'He's even worse on a platform. Like one of those awful souvenir
dolls that tourists take home; and just about as Scottish.'</p>

<p>'Isn't he Scots?'</p>

<p>'No. He hasn't a drop of Scottish blood in him. His father came
from Liverpool and his mother was an O'Hanrahan.'</p>

<p>'Odd how all the most bigoted patriots are Auslanders,' Grant
said. 'I don't think he'll get very far with those xenophobes, the
Gaels.'</p>

<p>'He has a much worse handicap than that,' Laura said.</p>

<p>'What is that?'</p>

<p>'His Glasgow accent.'</p>

<p>'Yes. It is pretty repellent.'</p>

<p>'I didn't mean that. I mean, every time he opens his mouth his
audience is reminded of the possibility of being ruled from
Glasgow: a fate worse than death.'</p>

<p>'When he was talking about the beauty of the Islands he
mentioned some sands that "sing". Do you know anything about
them?'</p>

<p>'I seem to,' said Tommy, not interested. 'On Barra or Berneray
or somewhere.'</p>

<p>'On Cladda, he said.'</p>

<p>'Yes, perhaps it's Cladda. Do you think that boat at Lochan Dhu
will last a season or two yet?'</p>

<p>'Can I go and get the <i>Clarion</i> from Bella now?' asked Pat,
having wolfed four scones and a slab of cake with the neat speed of
a sheep-dog consuming a stolen tit-bit.</p>

<p>'If she has finished with it,' his mother said.</p>

<p>'Uch, she'll have finished with it this long time,' Pat said.
'She only reads the bits about the stars.'</p>

<p>'Stars?' said Grant, as the door closed behind Pat. 'Film
stars?'</p>

<p>'No,' Laura said. 'The Great Bear and Co.'</p>

<p>'Oh. The day as arranged by Sirius, Vega, and Capella.'</p>

<p>'Yes. In Lewis they have to wait for the second-sight, she says.
It's a fine convenient thing to have the future in the paper every
day.'</p>

<p>'What does Pat want with the <i>Clarion</i>?'</p>

<p>'The strip, of course. Two objects called Tolly and Snib. I
can't remember whether they are ducks or rabbits.'</p>

<p>So Grant had to wait until Pat had finished with Tolly and Snib,
and by that time both Laura and Tommy had taken themselves off, the
one to the kitchen and the other to out-of-doors, so that he was
left alone with the silent child on the mat, endlessly rearranging
her treasures. He took the tidily-folded paper from Pat
ceremoniously, and as Pat went away he unfolded it with controlled
interest. It was a Scottish edition and apart from the 'middles'
the paper was crammed with the most parochial of news, but there
seemed to be nothing about yesterday's railway event in it. To and
fro he went, through the jungle of unimportances, like a terrier
routing through bracken, and at last he came on it: a tiny
paragraph at the bottom of a column, down among the bicycle
accidents and the centenarians. 'MAN DIES IN TRAIN', said the
inconspicuous heading. And under the heading was a succinct
statement:</p>

<blockquote>On the arrival of the <i>Flying Highlander</i> at its
destination yesterday morning it was found that one of the
passengers, a young Frenchman, Charles Martin, had died during the
night. It is understood that the death was due to natural causes,
but since the death occurred in England, the body is being returned
to London for an inquest.</blockquote>

<p>'<i>French</i>!' he said aloud, and Bridget looked up from her
playthings to watch him.</p>

<p>French? Surely not! Surely not?</p>

<p>The face, yes. Perhaps. The face quite likely. But not that
writing. That very English, schoolboy writing.</p>

<p>Had the paper not belonged to B Seven at all?</p>

<p>Had he just picked it up? In a restaurant where he was having a
meal before boarding the train, perhaps. The chairs of station
dining-rooms were habitually strewn with the discarded papers of
those who had eaten there. Or in his home, for that matter; or his
rooms or wherever he lived. He might have come by the paper in a
score of casual ways.</p>

<p>Or, of course, he might be a Frenchman who was educated in
England, so that the round untidy script was substituted for the
slanting elegant spidery handwriting of his inheritance. There was
nothing fundamentally incompatible with B Seven having been the
author of those pencilled lines.</p>

<p>All the same, it was an oddity.</p>

<p>And in cases of sudden death, however natural, oddities have
importance. When he first came in contact with B Seven he was so
divorced from his professional self, so detached from the world at
large, that he had considered the matter as any other sleep-sodden
civilian would. B Seven had been for him merely the young dead
occupant of a whisky-sodden compartment who was being mauled about
by a furiously impatient sleeping-car attendant. Now he became
something quite different; he became The Subject Of An Inquest. A
professional matter; a matter bound by rules and regulations; a
matter to be proceeded with circumspectly, with due decorum and by
the book. And it occurred to Grant for the first time that his
abstraction of that newspaper might be held, if orthodoxy must be
pushed to its furthest point, to be a little irregular. It had been
an entirely unintended abstraction; an accidental purloining. But
it had, if one had to be analytical about it, been a removal of
evidence.</p>

<p>While Grant was debating the matter, Laura came back from the
kitchen and said: 'Alan, I want you to do something for me.'</p>

<p>She took her mending basket and brought it over to a chair
beside him.</p>

<p>'Anything I can do.'</p>

<p>'Pat is sticking in his toes about something that he has to do
and I want you to talk him into it. You're his hero, and he will
listen to you.'</p>

<p>'It isn't about presenting a bouquet, by any chance?'</p>

<p>'How did you know? Has he talked about it to you already?'</p>

<p>'He just mentioned it this morning on the loch.'</p>

<p>'You didn't take his side, did you?'</p>

<p>'With you in the background! No. I expressed the opinion that it
was a great honour.'</p>

<p>'Was he convinced?'</p>

<p>'No. He thinks the whole thing is "havers".'</p>

<p>'So it is. The hall has been in unofficial use for weeks. But
the glen people spent a lot of money and energy on getting that
thing put up, and it is only right that it should be opened with a
"splash".'</p>

<p>'But does it have to be Pat who presents the bouquet?'</p>

<p>'Yes. If he doesn't do it, the MacFadyean's Willie will.'</p>

<p>'Laura, you shock me.'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't if you could see the MacFadyean's Willie. He looks
like a frog with elephantiasis. And his socks are always falling
down. It should be a little girl's business, but there is no female
child of the right age in the glen. So it rests between Pat and the
MacFadyean's Willie. And quite apart from Pat's looking nicer, it
is right that someone from Clune should do it. And don't say "Why?"
and don't say I shock you. You just see what you can do to talk Pat
into it.'</p>

<p>'I'll try,' Grant said, smiling at her. 'Who is his
Viscountess?'</p>

<p>'Lady Kentallen.'</p>

<p>'The dowager?'</p>

<p>'The widow, you mean. There is only one, so far. Her boy isn't
old enough yet to be married.'</p>

<p>'How did you get her?'</p>

<p>'She was at school with me. At St Louisa's.'</p>

<p>'Oh: blackmail. The tyranny of auld lang syne.'</p>

<p>'Tyranny nothing,' said Laura. 'She was glad to come and do the
chore. She's a darling.'</p>

<p>'The best way to bring Pat up to his bit would be to make her
attractive in his eyes.'</p>

<p>'She's ragingly attractive.'</p>

<p>'I don't mean that way. I mean, make her good at something he
admires.'</p>

<p>'She's an expert with a fly,' Laura said doubtfully, 'but I
don't know that Pat would find that very impressive. He just thinks
that someone who can't fish is abnormal.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you couldn't endow her with a few revolutionary
tendencies.'</p>

<p>'Revolutionary!' said Laura, her eye brightening. 'Now that's an
idea. Revolutionary. She used to be a little on the pink side. She
did it "to annoy Miles and Georgiana", she used to say. They are
her parents. She was never very serious about it; she was much too
good-looking to need anything like that. But I might build
something on that foundation. Yes. We might make her a
revolutionary.'</p>

<p>The quirks that women are reduced to! thought Grant, watching
her needle nicker through the wool of the sock she was darning; and
went back to considering his own problem. He was still considering
it when he went to bed. But before he went to sleep he decided that
he would write to Bryce in the morning. It would be to all intents
a letter reporting his arrival in these healthful surroundings and
his hope to be better in less time than the doctor had given him,
but in the course of it he would take the opportunity of putting
himself in the right by passing the knowledge of the newspaper's
presence on to those whom it might concern.</p>

<p>He slept the deep uninterrupted sleep induced by fresh air and
an unsullied conscience, and woke to an immense silence. The
silence was not only out-of-doors; the house itself was in a
trance. And Grant suddenly remembered that it was Sunday. There
would be no post out of the glen today. He would have to go all the
way to Scoone with his letter.</p>

<p>He asked Tommy at breakfast if he might borrow the car to go to
Scoone to post an important letter, and Laura offered to drive him.
So as soon as breakfast was over he went back to his room to
compose the letter, and in the end was very pleased with it. He
brought the matter of B Seven into the texture of it as neatly as
an invisible mender fits an unbelonging piece to the over-all
pattern. He had not been able to shake the memory of work from him
as soon as he might, he said, because the first thing he had been
confronted with at the end of the journey was a dead body. The body
was being furiously shaken by an enraged sleeping-car attendant who
thought that the man was just sleeping it off. However, it had been
none of his business, thank Heaven. His only part in the affair had
been to purloin unintentionally a newspaper from the compartment.
He had found it among his own when he was having breakfast. It was
a <i>Signal</i>, and he would have taken it for granted that it was
his own property if it had not been that in the Stop Press space
someone had been pencilling a scribbled attempt at verse. The verse
was in English and in English writing, and might not have been
written by the dead man at all. He understood that the inquest was
being held in London. If Bryce thought that it was of any
importance he might hand on the small item of information to the
relevant authority.</p>

<p>He came downstairs again to find the Sabbath atmosphere
shattered. The house rocked with war and rebellion. Pat had
discovered that someone was going in to Scoone (which in his
country eyes was even on a Sunday a metropolis of delectable
variety) and he wanted to go too. His mother, on the other hand,
was determined that he was going to Sunday school as usual.</p>

<p>'You ought to be very glad of the lift,' she was saying,
'instead of grumbling about not wanting to go.'</p>

<p>Grant thought that 'grumbling' was a highly inadequate word to
describe the blazing opposition that lighted Pat like a torch. He
throbbed with it, like a car at rest with the engine running.</p>

<p>'If we didn't happen to be going in to Scoone you would have to
walk to the church as usual,' she reminded him.</p>

<p>'Huch, who ever minds walking! We have fine talks when we're
walking, Duggie and me.' Duggie was the shepherd's son. 'It's
wasting time at Sunday school when I might be going to Scoone
that's a fact. It's not fair.'</p>

<p>'Pat, I will not have you referring to Sunday school as a waste
of time.'</p>

<p>'You won't have me at all if you're not careful. I'll die of a
decline.'</p>

<p>'Oh. What would bring that on?'</p>

<p>'Lack of fresh air.'</p>

<p>She began to laugh. 'Pat, you're wonderful!' But it was always
the wrong thing to laugh at Pat. He took himself as seriously as an
animal does.</p>

<p>'All right, laugh!' he said bitterly. 'You'll be going to church
on Sundays to put wreaths on my grave, that's what you'll be doing
on Sundays, not going into Scoone!'</p>

<p>'I shouldn't dream of doing anything so extravagant. A few
dog-daisies now and then when I'm passing is as much as you'll get
from me. Go and get your scarf; you'll need it.'</p>

<p>'A gravat! It's March!'</p>

<p>'It's also cold. Get your scarf. It will help to keep off that
decline.'</p>

<p>'A lot you care about my decline, you and your daisies. A mean
family the Grants always were. A poor mean lot. I'm very glad I'm a
Rankin, and I'm very glad I don't have to wear their horrible red
tartan.' Pat's tattered green kilt was Macintyre, which went better
with his red hair than the gay Grant. It had been part of Tommy's
mother's web, and she, as a good Macintyre, had been glad to see
her grandson in what she called a civilised cloth.</p>

<p>He stumped his way into the back of the car and sat there
simmering, the despised 'gravat' flung in a limp disavowed heap at
the far end of the seat.</p>

<p>'Heathen aren't supposed to go to church,' he offered, as they
slipped down the sandy road to the gate, the loose stones spurting
from under the tyres.</p>

<p>'Who is heathen?' his mother asked, her mind on the road.</p>

<p>'I am. I'm a Mohammedan.'</p>

<p>'Then you have great need to go to a Christian church and be
converted. Open the gate, Pat.'</p>

<p>'I've no wish to be converted. I'm fine as I am.' He held the
gate open for them and shut it behind them. 'I disapprove of the
Bible,' he said, as he got in again.</p>

<p>'Then you can't be a good Mohammedan.'</p>

<p>'What for no?'</p>

<p>'They have some of the Bible too.'</p>

<p>'I bet they don't have David!'</p>

<p>'Don't you approve of David?' Grant asked.</p>

<p>'A poor soppy thing, dancing and singing like a lassie. There's
not a soul in the Old Testament I'd trust to go to a sheep
sale.'</p>

<p>He sat erect in the middle of the back seat, too alive with
rebellion to relax, his bleak eye watching the road ahead in
absent-minded fury. And it occurred to Grant that he might equally
have slumped in a corner and sulked. He was glad that this cousin
of his was a rude and erect flame of resentment and not a small
collapsed bundle of self-pity.</p>

<p>The injured heathen got out at the church, still rude and erect,
and walked away without a backward glance, to join the small group
of children by the side door.</p>

<p>'Will he behave, now he is there?' Grant asked as Laura set the
car in motion again.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes. He really likes it, you know. And of course Douglas
will be there: his Jonathan. A day when he couldn't spend part of
it laying down the law to Duggie would be a day wasted. He didn't
really believe that I would let him come to Scoone instead. It was
just a try-on.'</p>

<p>'It was a very effective try-on.'</p>

<p>'Yes. There's a lot of the actor in Pat.'</p>

<p>They had gone another two miles before the thought of Pat faded
from his mind. And, then, quite suddenly, into the blank that Pat's
departure left, came the realisation that he was in a car. That he
was shut into a car. He ceased on the instant to be an adult
watching, tolerant and amused, the unreasonable antics of a child,
and became a child watching, gibbering and aghast, the hostile
advance of giants.</p>

<p>He let down the window on his side to its fullest extent. 'Let
me know if you feel that too much,' he said.</p>

<p>'You've been too long in London,' she said.</p>

<p>'How?'</p>

<p>'Only people who live in towns are fresh-air fiends. Country
people like a nice fug as a change from unlimited
out-of-doors.'</p>

<p>'I'll put it up, if you like,' he said, although his mouth was
stiff with effort as he said the words.</p>

<p>'No, of course not,' she said, and began to talk about a car
they had ordered.</p>

<p>So the old battle started. The old arguments, the old tricks,
the old cajoling. The pointing out of the open windows, the
reminding himself that it was only a car and could be stopped at
any moment, the willing himself to consider a subject far removed
from the present, the self-persuading that he was lucky to be alive
at all. But the tide of his panic rose with a slow abominable
menace. A black evil tide, scummy and revolting. Now it was round
his chest, pressing and holding, so that he could hardly breathe.
Now it was up to his throat, feeling round his windpipe, clutching
his neck in a pincer embrace. In a moment it would be over his
mouth.</p>

<p>'Lalla, stop!'</p>

<p>'Stop the car?' she asked, surprised.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>She brought the car to a standstill, and he got out on trembling
legs and hung over the dry-stone dyke sucking in great mouthfuls of
the clean air.</p>

<p>'Are you feeling ill, Alan?' she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>'No, I just wanted to get out of the car.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' she said in a relieved tone. 'Is that all!'</p>

<p>'Is that <i>all</i>?'</p>

<p>'Yes: claustrophobia. I was afraid you were ill.'</p>

<p>'And you don't call that being ill?' he said bitterly.</p>

<p>'Of course not. I nearly died of terror once, when I was taken
to see the Cheddar caves. I had never been in a cave before.' She
had switched off the motor and now she sat down on a roadside
boulder with her back half-turned to him. 'Except those rabbit
burrows that we called caves in our youth.' She held up her
cigarette case to him. 'I'd never been really underground before,
and I didn't mind going in the least. I went all eager and
delighted, I was a good half-mile from the entrance when it struck
me. I sweated with terror. Do you have it often?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Do you know that you're the only person who still calls me
Lalla sometimes? We are getting very old.'</p>

<p>He looked round and down at her, the strain fading from his
expression.</p>

<p>'I didn't know you had any terrors other than rats.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes. I have a fine variety. Everyone has, I think. At least
everyone who is not just a clod. I keep placid because I lead a
placid life and collect adipose tissue. If I overworked the way you
do I'd be a raving maniac. I'd probably have claustrophobia
<i>and</i> agoraphobia, and make medical history. One would have
the enormous consolation of being something in the <i>Lancet</i>,
of course.'</p>

<p>He turned from leaning over the wall and sat down beside her.
'Look,' he said, and held out the shaking hand that held his
cigarette for her to see.</p>

<p>'Poor Alan.'</p>

<p>'Poor Alan indeed,' he agreed. 'That came not from being half a
mile underground in the dark, but from being a passenger in a car
with wide-open windows in an open countryside on a fine Sunday in a
free country.'</p>

<p>'It didn't, of course.'</p>

<p>'It didn't?'</p>

<p>'It came from four years of consistent overwork and an overgrown
conscience. You always were a demon where conscience was concerned.
Quite tiresome you could be. Would you rather have a spot of
claustrophobia or a stroke?'</p>

<p>'A stroke?'</p>

<p>'If you work yourself half to death you have to pay in some
manner or other. Would you rather pay in the more usual physical
manner with high blood-pressure or a strained heart? It's better to
be scared of being shut into a car than to be pushed about in a
bath-chair. At least you have time off from being scared. If you
hate the thought of getting back into the car, by the way, I can go
on to Scoone with your letter and pick you up on the way back.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no, I'll go on.'</p>

<p>'I thought it was better not to fight it?'</p>

<p>'Did <i>you</i> scream and yell half a mile underground in the
Cheddar Gorge?'</p>

<p>'No. But I wasn't a pathological specimen suffering from
overwork.'</p>

<p>He smiled suddenly. 'It's extraordinary how comforting it is to
be called a pathological specimen. Or rather, to be called a
pathological specimen in just those tones.'</p>

<p>'Do you remember the day at Varese when it rained and we went to
the museum and saw those specimens in bottles?'</p>

<p>'Yes; you were sick on the pavement outside.'</p>

<p>'Well, you were sick when we had sheep's heart for lunch because
you had watched it being stuffed,' she said instantly.</p>

<p>'Lalla, darling,' he said, beginning to laugh, 'you haven't
grown-up at all.'</p>

<p>'Well, it's nice that you can still laugh, even if it's only at
me,' she said, caught out in that flash of childhood rivalry. 'Say
when you want to go on.'</p>

<p>'Now.'</p>

<p>'Now? Are you sure?'</p>

<p>'Quite sure. Being called a pathological specimen has
wonderfully curative qualities, I find.'</p>

<p>'Well, next time don't wait until you are on the point of
suffocation,' she said matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>He did not know which he found more reassuring: her awareness
that the thing was a sort of suffocation or her matter-of-fact
acceptance of unreason.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">IF Grant had imagined that his chief would be
gratified either by the possibility of his earlier recovery or by
his punctiliousness in the matter of the newspaper, he was wrong.
Bryce was still antagonist rather than colleague. And his reply
contained a right-and-left that was typically Bryce. Reading it,
Grant thought that only Bryce could manage to have his cake and eat
it so successfully. In the first paragraph he rebuked Grant for his
unprofessional conduct in abstracting any article from the vicinity
of sudden and unexplained death. In the second paragraph he was
surprised that Grant should have thought of bothering a busy
Department with any matter as trivial as that of the purloined
paper, but supposed that no doubt his divorce from workaday
surroundings had contributed to a lack of judgement and proportion.
There was no third paragraph.</p>

<p>What came off the familiar thin office paper was a strong
impression that he had been put, not in his place, but outside.
What the letter really said was: 'I can't imagine why you, Alan
Grant, should be bothering us, either to report on your health or
to take an interest in our business. We are not interested in the
one and you have no concern with the other.' He was an outsider. A
renegade.</p>

<p>And it was only now, reading the snubbing letter and having the
door banged in his face, that he became aware that beyond his
conscientious need to put himself straight with the Department over
the purloined paper had been the desire to hang on to B Seven. His
letter, as well as an apology, had been a way to information. There
was no longer hope of obtaining information from the Press. B Seven
was not news. Every day people died in trains. There was nothing to
interest the lieges in that. As far as the Press was concerned B
Seven was dead twice over, once in fact and once as news. But he
had wanted to know more about B Seven, and he had hoped without
knowing it that his colleagues might be chatty on the subject.</p>

<p>He might have known Bryce better, he thought, tearing up the
sheet of paper and dropping it into the wastepaper basket. However,
there was always Sergeant Williams, thank Heaven; the faithful
Williams. Williams would wonder why someone of his rank and
experience should be interested in an unknown dead body seen once
for a moment or two, but he would probably put it down to boredom.
In any case there would be no lack of chat about Williams. So to
Williams he wrote. Would Williams find out what the result of the
inquest had been on a young man, Charles Martin, who had died on
Thursday night a week ago on the night train to the Highlands; and
anything else about the young man that might have transpired in the
course of the inquiry. And kind regards to Mrs Williams and Angela
and Leonard.</p>

<p>And for two days he settled back in a sort of happy impatience
to wait for Williams's reply. He inspected the unfishable Turlie,
pool by pool; he caulked the boat at Lochan Dhu; he walked the hill
in the company of Graham the shepherd with Tong and Zang more or
less at heel; and he listened to Tommy's plan for a nine-hole
private golf course between the house and the hillside. And on the
third day he went homing at post time with an eagerness he had not
known since he was nineteen and used to send his poems to
magazines.</p>

<p>Nor was his blank unbelief when there was nothing for him any
less poignant than it had been in those callow years.</p>

<p>He reminded himself that he was being unreasonable. (The
unforgivable sin, always, in Grant's estimation.) The inquest had
nothing to do with the Department. He did not even know which
Division might have been landed with the job. Williams would have
to find out. Williams had work of his own; twenty-four-hours-a-day
work. It was unreasonable to expect him to drop everything to
satisfy some holiday-making colleague's frivolous questions.</p>

<p>For two more days he waited, and then it came.</p>

<p>Williams hoped that Grant wasn't hankering after work. He was
supposed to be having a rest, and everyone in the Department hoped
that he was getting it (not everyone! thought Grant, remembering
Bryce) and feeling the better for it. They missed him very badly.
As to Charles Martin, there was no mystery about him. Or about his
death, if that is what Grant had been thinking. He had hit the back
of his head against the edge of the porcelain wash-hand basin, and
although able to crawl around for a little on his hands and knees
and eventually reach the bed, he had died from internal haemorrhage
very shortly after falling over. The fact that he had fallen
backwards at all was due to the amount of neat whisky he had
consumed. Not enough to make him drunk but quite enough to make him
muzzy, and the tilt of the coach as it changed direction had done
the rest. There was no mystery either about the man himself. He had
had the usual bundle of French identity papers in his possession,
and his people were still living at his home address near
Marseilles. They had not seen him for some years&mdash;he had left
home after being in trouble for stabbing his girl in a fit of
jealousy&mdash;but they had sent money to bury him so that he
should not be buried in a pauper's grave.</p>

<p>This left Grant with an appetite whetted rather than
assuaged.</p>

<p>He waited until, according to his reckoning, Williams would be
happily settled down with his pipe and his paper, while Mrs
Williams mended and Angela and Leonard did their homework, and put
in a personal call to him. There was always the chance that
Williams was out pursuing the ill-doer through the devious ways of
his inhabiting, but there was, too, the chance that he was at
home.</p>

<p>He was at home.</p>

<p>When he had been duly thanked for his letter, Grant said: 'You
said his people sent money to bury him. Didn't anyone come to
identify him?'</p>

<p>'No; they identified a photograph.'</p>

<p>'A live photograph?'</p>

<p>'No, no. A photograph of the body.'</p>

<p>'Didn't anyone turn up to identify him in London?'</p>

<p>'Not a soul, it seems.'</p>

<p>'That's odd.'</p>

<p>'Not so odd if he was a wide boy. Wide boys don't want
trouble.'</p>

<p>'Was there any suggestion that he was wide?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't think so.'</p>

<p>'What was his profession?'</p>

<p>'Mechanic.'</p>

<p>'Did he have a passport?'</p>

<p>'No. Just the usual papers. And letters.'</p>

<p>'Oh, he had letters?'</p>

<p>'Yes; the usual odd two or three that people carry. One was from
a girl saying she would wait for him. She's going to wait some
time.'</p>

<p>'Were the letters in French?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'What money had he?'</p>

<p>'Wait a minute till I find my notes. Um&mdash;m&mdash;m.
Twenty-two, ten, in mixed notes; eighteen and tuppence ha'penny in
silver and copper.'</p>

<p>'All English?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Between the lack of passport and the English currency it looks
as if he had been in England a good long time. I wonder why no one
came to claim him.'</p>

<p>'They may not know yet that he is dead. It didn't get much
publicity.'</p>

<p>'Didn't he have any address in Britain?'</p>

<p>'He had no address on him. The letters were not in envelopes:
just in his wallet. His friends will probably turn up yet.'</p>

<p>'Does anyone know where he was going? Or why?'</p>

<p>'No; seemingly not.'</p>

<p>'What luggage had he?'</p>

<p>'An overnight case. Shirt, socks, pyjamas and bedroom slippers.
No laundry marks.'</p>

<p>'<i>What?</i> Why? Were the things new?'</p>

<p>'No, oh, no.' Williams sounded amused at Grant's overt
suspicion. 'Very well worn.'</p>

<p>'Maker's name in the slippers?'</p>

<p>'No; those hand-made thick leather things you find in North
African bazaars and in the Mediterranean ports.'</p>

<p>'What else?'</p>

<p>'In the case? A New Testament in French, and a yellow
paper-backed novel, also in French. Both well worn.'</p>

<p>'Your three minutes are up,' said the Post Office.</p>

<p>Grant had another three minutes, but he got no nearer an
explanation of B Seven. Apart from the fact that he had no record,
either in France (the stabbing had been merely a domestic incident,
it seemed) or in Britain, nothing was known of him. It was indeed
typical that the one positive thing about him should be a
negation.</p>

<p>'By the way,' Williams said, 'when I was writing I quite forgot
to answer your postscript.'</p>

<p>'What postscript?' Grant asked, and then remembered that he had
written as an afterthought:</p>

<blockquote>'If you ever have nothing better to do you might ask
the Special Branch if they are interested at all in a man called
Archibald Brown. Scottish patriot. Ask for Ted Hanna and tell him I
was asking.'</blockquote>

<p>'Oh, yes, of course. About the patriot. Did you have time to do
anything about it? It wasn't important.'</p>

<p>'Well, as it happened, I met your reference on a Whitehall bus,
day before yesterday. He says he has nothing against your bird but
they would very much like to know who the ravens are. Do you know
what he was talking about?'</p>

<p>'I think I do,' Grant said, amused. 'I'll do my best to find out
for them. Just as a piece of holiday homework, tell him.'</p>

<p>'You keep your mind off your work, if you please, and get well
enough to be back here before the place falls to pieces without
you.'</p>

<p>'The shoes he was wearing: where were they made?'</p>

<p>'Who was wearing? Oh. Yes. Karachi.'</p>

<p>'<i>Where?</i>'</p>

<p>'Karachi.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that's what I thought you said. He seems to have got
around. No name on the fly-leaf of the Testament?'</p>

<p>'Don't think so. I don't think I made any note of that when I
read the evidence. Just a minute. Oh, yes, I did. No name.'</p>

<p>'And no one in "missing persons" that fits him?'</p>

<p>'No. No one. No one even approximately like him, it seems. He
isn't "missing" from anywhere.'</p>

<p>'Well, it was wonderful of you to go to all that trouble for me
instead of telling me to go fish in my burn. I'll do as much for
you some day.'</p>

<p>'Are the fish in your burn biting?'</p>

<p>'There's hardly any burn, and the fish are cowering in the
deepest recesses of the remaining pools. That is why I am reduced
to taking an interest in cases that aren't worth a flicker of real
interest in busy places like South West One.'</p>

<p>But he knew that that was not so. It was not boredom that had
driven him to this interest in B Seven. This&mdash;he had almost
said&mdash;alliance. He had a curious feeling of identification
with B Seven. Not in the sense of being one, but in the sense of
having an identity of interests. This, in view of the fact that he
had seen him only once and knew nothing whatever about him, was
highly unreasonable. Was it perhaps that he had thought of B Seven
as also wrestling with demons? Had the feeling of personal
interest, the championship, begun in that?</p>

<p>He had supposed that B Seven's Paradise had been oblivion. He
had supposed that because of the whisky-sodden fug in the
compartment. But the young man had not after all been sodden. He
had not indeed been very drunk. Just tipsy. His flying backwards
fall against the solid round bulk of the basin had been the kind of
thing that might happen to anyone. His so-strangely guarded
Paradise had not after all been oblivion.</p>

<p>He caught his attention back to what Williams was saying.</p>

<p>'<i>What's</i> that?'</p>

<p>'I forgot to say that the sleeping-car attendant is of the
opinion that Martin was seen off by someone at Euston.'</p>

<p>'Why is this an afterthought?'</p>

<p>'Well, I gather that he wasn't much of a help anyway, the
sleeping-car chap. He seemed to treat the whole thing as a personal
insult, the sergeant who was there said.'</p>

<p>Old Yughourt seemed to have run very true to form.</p>

<p>'What <i>did</i> he say?'</p>

<p>'He said that when he walked through the corridor, at Euston,
Martin had someone with him in the compartment. Another man. He
didn't see the man because Martin was facing him and the door was
half-open, so that all he noticed was that Martin was talking to
another man. They seemed very happy and friendly. They were talking
about robbing a hotel.'</p>

<p>'<i>What!</i>'</p>

<p>'You see what I mean? The coroner said "What!" too. The railway
chap said that they were talking about "robbing the Caley" and
since no one could rob a football team it must have been a hotel.
It seems that all the hotels in Scotland that are not called
Waverley are called Caledonian. Popularly known as "Caley". They
weren't serious about it, he said.'</p>

<p>'And that was all he saw of the see-er-off?'</p>

<p>'Yes, that was all.'</p>

<p>'He mightn't have been a see-er-off at all. He might have been
just a friend who came across him on the train. Saw his name on the
sleeper list, or noticed him in passing.'</p>

<p>'Yes; except that you'd expect a friend to turn up again in the
morning.'</p>

<p>'Not necessarily. Especially if he was far down the train. And
the removal of the body would have been so discreet that I doubt if
any passengers knew that someone had died. The station was clear of
passengers long before the ambulance arrived. I know, because the
ambulance fuss was taking place when I had nearly finished
breakfast.'</p>

<p>'Yes. The sleeping-car chap said he took it for granted that the
other man was a see-er-off because he was standing in hat and coat.
Mostly, he says, when people go coffee-housing along the train they
take their hats off. It's the first thing they do, he says: throw
their hat on a rack. When they get to their compartment, I
mean.'</p>

<p>'Talking of names on the sleeper list, how was the berth
booked?'</p>

<p>'By phone; but he picked up the ticket himself. At least, it was
picked up by a thin dark man. Booked a week in advance.'</p>

<p>'All right. Go on about Yughourt.'</p>

<p>'About who?'</p>

<p>'About the sleeping-car attendant.'</p>

<p>'Oh. Well. He said that when he came down the train collecting
tickets, about twenty minutes out from Euston, Martin had gone to
the lavatory, but his sleeper ticket and the outward half of his
ticket to Scoone were lying ready on the little shelf below the
mirror. He took them and marked them off in his book, and as he was
passing the lavatory he knocked at the door and said: "Are you in B
Seven, sir?" Martin said yes. The attendant said: "I've taken your
tickets, thank you, sir. Will you be wanting tea in the morning?"
And Martin said: "No, thank you; good-night."'</p>

<p>'So he had a return ticket.'</p>

<p>'Yes. The return half was in his wallet.'</p>

<p>'Well, it's all straightforward enough, it seems. Even the lack
of anyone to make inquiries about him, or to claim his body, may be
due to the fact that he was off on a trip and people didn't expect
to hear from him.'</p>

<p>'That and the lack of publicity. I don't suppose his people even
bothered to put an announcement in an English paper; they would
just announce it in their own local affair, where people knew
him.'</p>

<p>'What did the P.M. say?'</p>

<p>'Oh, the usual. Light meal about an hour before death, large
quantity of whisky in stomach and a fair amount in the blood. Quite
enough to make him tight.'</p>

<p>'No suggestion that he was a soak?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no. No degeneration of any kind. Head and shoulder injuries
at some earlier period, but otherwise good healthy specimen. Not to
say tough.'</p>

<p>'So he had some earlier injury?'</p>

<p>'Yes, but a long time ago. I mean, nothing to do with this. He
had at some time had a fractured skull and a broken collar-bone.
Would it be very bad-mannered or very indiscreet of me to ask why
all this interest in a simple case?'</p>

<p>'So help me, sergeant, if I knew I would tell you. I think I
must be getting childish.'</p>

<p>'It's more likely that you're just bored,' Williams said
sympathetically. 'Me, I was brought up in the country and I was
never a one for watching the grass grow. An over-rated place, the
country. Everything's too far away. Once that burn of yours starts
flowing you'll forget about Mr Martin. It's pouring stair-rods here
so you probably won't have long to wait for rain now.'</p>

<p>It did not, in fact, rain that night in the Turlie valley, but
something else happened. The cold bright stillness gave place to a
light wind. The wind was soft and warm, the air hung damp and heavy
between gusts, the earth was moist and slippery, and down from the
high tops came the snow water, filling the river bed from bank to
bank. And up the brown racing water came the fish, flashing silver
in the light as they leaped over the broken ledges of rock and up
the narrow sluicing current between the boulders. Pat took his
precious invention from his fly case (where it had a special
compartment of its own) and presented it to Grant with the formal
benevolence of a headmaster handing over a certificate. 'You'll
take care of it, won't you?' he said. 'It took me a long time to
make.' The thing was, as his mother had said, a fearsome object.
Grant thought that it was rather like something for a woman's hat;
but he was aware that he was being singled out among men as the
sole recipient worthy of such an honour and he accepted it with due
gratification. He put it safely away in his own case and hoped that
Pat would not supervise his efforts to the extent of making him use
it. But each time he chose a new fly in the days that followed, he
caught sight of the fearsome object and was warmed by his small
cousin's approval of him.</p>

<p>He spent his days by the Turlie; happy and relaxed above the
brown swirling water. The water was clear as beer and its foam
froth-white; it filled his ears with music and his days with
delight. The damp soft air smurred his tweed with fine dew and the
hazel twigs dripped down the back of his neck.</p>

<p>For nearly a week he thought fish, talked fish, and ate
fish.</p>

<p>And then, one evening, on his pet pool below the swing bridge,
he was startled out of his complacence.</p>

<p>He saw a man's face in the water.</p>

<p>There was time for his heart to come up into his mouth before he
realised that the face was not under the surface of the water but
at the back of his eyes. It was the dead white face with the
reckless eyebrows.</p>

<p>He swore, and sent his Jock Scott singing viciously to the far
side of the pool. He was finished with B Seven. He had grown
interested in B Seven under a complete misunderstanding of the
situation. He had thought that B Seven too had been hounded by
demons. He had built up for himself an entirely fallacious picture
of B Seven. That toper's Paradise in B Seven's compartment boiled
down to an overturned whisky bottle. He was no longer interested in
B Seven: a very ordinary young man, bursting with rude health to
the point of toughness, who had had one over the eight on a night
journey and ended his life in the highly undignified manner of
falling backwards and then crawling about on his hands and knees
until he stopped breathing.</p>

<p>'But he wrote those line about Paradise,' a voice in him
said.</p>

<p>'He didn't,' he said to the voice. 'There's not the slightest
evidence that he did any such thing.'</p>

<p>'There's his face. No ordinary face. It was the face that you
first succumbed to. Long before you began to think of his Paradise
at all.'</p>

<p>'I have <i>not</i> succumbed,' he said. 'In my job you take an
automatic interest in people.'</p>

<p>'Yes? You mean, if the occupant of that whisky-sodden
compartment had been a fat commercial traveller with a moustache
like a badly kept hedge and a face like a boiled pudding, you would
still have been interested?'</p>

<p>'I might.'</p>

<p>'You lying dishonest bastard. You were B Seven's champion the
minute you saw his face and noticed the way that Yughourt was
mauling him about. You snatched him from Yughourt's grip and
straightened his jacket like a mother pulling a shawl over her
baby.'</p>

<p>'Shut up.'</p>

<p>'You wanted to know about him not because you thought there was
anything odd about his death but because, quite simply, you wanted
to know about him. He was young and dead, and he had been reckless
and alive. You wanted to know what he had been like when he was
reckless and alive.'</p>

<p>'All right, I wanted to know. I also want to know who is going
to ride the Lincolnshire favourite, and what my shares are quoted
at in today's market, and what June Kaye's next picture is going to
be; but I'm not losing any sleep about any of them.'</p>

<p>'No; and you don't see June Kaye's face between you and the
water, either.'</p>

<p>'I have no intention of seeing anyone's face between me and the
river. <i>Nothing</i> is going to come between me and the river. I
came here to fish and nothing is going to muck up that for me.'</p>

<p>'B Seven came North to do something too. I wonder what it
was?'</p>

<p>'How should I know?'</p>

<p>'It couldn't be fishing, anyhow.'</p>

<p>'Why couldn't it?'</p>

<p>'No one who was going five or six hundred miles to fish would be
without tackle of some kind. If he was as keen as that he would at
least have his own pet lures with him, even if he was going to be
lent a rod.'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps his Paradise was Tir nan Og. You know: the Gaelic one.
That would fit.'</p>

<p>'How would it fit?'</p>

<p>'Tir nan Og is supposed to be away out to the west, beyond the
outermost islands. The Land of the Young. The land of eternal
youth, that's the Gaelic Paradise. And what "guards the way" to it?
Islands with singing sands, it seems. Islands with stones that
stand up like men walking.'</p>

<p>'And beasts that talk? Do you find them too in the Outer
Isles?'</p>

<p>'You do.'</p>

<p>'You do? What are they?'</p>

<p>'Seals.'</p>

<p>'Oh, go away and leave me alone. I'm busy. I'm fishing.'</p>

<p>'You may be fishing, but you're not catching a damned thing.
Your Jock Scott might as well be stuck in your hat. Now you listen
to me.'</p>

<p>'I will <i>not</i> listen to you. All <i>right</i>, there are
singing sands in the Islands! All <i>right</i>, there are walking
stones! <i>All right</i>, there are gabby seals! It has nothing to
do with me. And I don't suppose it had anything to do with B
Seven.'</p>

<p>'No? What was he going North for?'</p>

<p>'To bury a relation, to sleep with a woman, to climb a rock! How
should I know? And why should I care?'</p>

<p>'He was going to stay at a Caledonian Hotel somewhere.'</p>

<p>'He was not.'</p>

<p>'How do <i>you</i> know where he was going to stay?'</p>

<p>'I don't. Nobody does.'</p>

<p>'Why should one of them be all facetious about "robbing the
Caley" if he was going to stay at a Waverley?'</p>

<p>'If he was going to Cladda&mdash;and I'll bet there's no inn on
Cladda called anything as reeking of the mainland as the
Caledonian&mdash;if he was going to Cladda he would have gone via
Glasgow and Oban.'</p>

<p>'Not necessarily. It's just as short and just as comfortable via
Scoone. He probably loathed Glasgow. A lot of people do. Why not
ring up the Caledonian in Scoone when you go back to the house
tonight and find out if a Charles Martin was expected there?'</p>

<p>'I shall do no such thing.'</p>

<p>'If you slap the water like that you'll frighten every fish in
the river.'</p>

<p>He went back to the house at supper time in a very bad mood. He
had caught nothing and had lost his peace.</p>

<p>And in the somnolent hush that filled the sitting-room when work
was over for the day and the children in bed, he caught his eye
wandering from his book to the telephone at the other end of the
room. It stood on Tommy's desk, provocative in its suggestion of
latent power, in the infinite promise of its silent presence. He
had only to lift that receiver and he could speak to a man on the
Pacific coast of America, he could speak to a man in the wastes of
the Atlantic Ocean, he could speak to a man two miles above the
earth.</p>

<p>He could speak to a man in the Caledonian Hotel in Scoone.</p>

<p>He resisted this thought, with growing annoyance, for an hour.
Then Laura went to get bed-time drinks, and Tommy went to let the
dogs out, and Grant reached the telephone in a dive that was nearer
a rugby tackle than any civilised method of crossing a room.</p>

<p>He had lifted the receiver before he realised that he did not
know the number. He put the receiver back in its cradle and felt
that he had been saved. He turned to go back to his book but picked
up the telephone book instead. He would have no peace until he had
talked to the Caledonian in Scoone; it was cheap enough to have
peace at the cost of being a little silly.</p>

<p>'Scoone 1460....Caledonian Hotel? Can you tell me: did a Mr
Charles Martin book accommodation with you any time in the last
fortnight?...Yes, thank you, I'll wait....No? No one of that
name...Oh...Thank you very much. So sorry to have bothered
you.'</p>

<p>And that was that, he thought, slamming the receiver down. That,
as far as he was concerned, was definitely the end of B Seven.</p>

<p>He drank his nice soothing bed-time drink, and went to bed, and
lay wide awake staring at the ceiling. He put the light out, and
resorted to his own cure for insomnia: pretending to himself that
he had to stay awake. He had evolved this long ago from the simple
premise that human nature wants to do the thing it is forbidden to
do. And so far it had never failed him. He had only to begin
pretending that he was not allowed to go to sleep for his eyelids
to droop. The pretence eliminated in one move the greatest barrier
to sleep: the fear that one is not going to; and so left the beach
clear for the invading tide.</p>

<p>Tonight his eyelids dropped as usual, but a jingle ran round and
round in his head like a rat in a cage:</p>

<blockquote><i>The beasts that talk,<br>
The streams that stand,<br>
The stones that walk,<br>
The singing sand</i>...</blockquote>

<p>What were the streams that stand? Was there something in the
Islands that corresponded to that?</p>

<p>Not frozen streams. There was little snow or frost in the
Islands. Then, what? Streams that ran into the sand and stood
still? No. Fanciful. Streams that stand. Streams that stand?</p>

<p>Perhaps a librarian might know. There must be a goodish Public
Library in Scoone.</p>

<p>'I thought you weren't interested any more?' said the voice.</p>

<p>'You go to hell.'</p>

<p>A mechanic, he was. What did that mean? <i>Mechanicien.</i> It
involved an endless range of possibilities.</p>

<p>Whatever he did, he was successful enough to be able to travel
First Class on a British railway. Which in these days made one
practically a millionaire. And he had spent all that money on what,
to judge by his overnight case, was a flying visit.</p>

<p>A girl, perhaps? The girl who had promised to wait?</p>

<p>But she had been French.</p>

<p>A woman? No Englishman would go five hundred miles for a woman,
but a Frenchman might. Especially a Frenchman who had knifed his
girl for letting her glance stray.</p>

<p><i>The beasts that talk<br>
The streams that stand</i>
</p>

<p>Oh, God! not again. Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet eating
her curds and whey. Hickory dickory dock. Simple Simon met a pieman
going to the fair, said Simple Simon to the pieman Let me taste
your ware. Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross&mdash;Your
imagination had to be caught before you were fired by the need to
write down a thing. You could, if your imagination was vivid, get
to a stage when you were in bondage to an idea. When it became an
<i>idée fixe</i>. You could become so enraptured by the pictured
grace of a temple's flight of steps that you would work for years
to earn the money and gain the leisure to take you there. In
extreme cases it became a compulsion, and you dropped everything
and went to the thing that had seduced you: a mountain, a green
stone head in a museum, an uncharted river, a bit of
sail-cloth.</p>

<p>How far had B Seven's vision ridden him? Enough to send him
searching? Or just enough to make him write it down?</p>

<p>Because he <i>had</i> written those pencilled words.</p>

<p>Of course he had written them.</p>

<p>They belonged to B Seven as much as his eyebrows did. As much as
those schoolboy capital letters did.</p>

<p>'Those <i>English</i> capital letters?' said the voice,
provocative.</p>

<p>'<i>Yes</i>, those English letters.'</p>

<p>'But he was a native of Marseilles.'</p>

<p>'He could have been educated in England, couldn't he?'</p>

<p>'In two shakes you'll be telling me that he wasn't a Frenchman
at all.'</p>

<p>'In two shakes I will.'</p>

<p>But that, of course, was to enter the realm of fantasy. There
was no mystery about B Seven. He had an identity, a home and
people, a girl who was waiting for him. He was demonstrably a
Frenchman, and the fact that he wrote English verse in English
handwriting was entirely by the way.</p>

<p>'He probably went to school in Clapham,' he said nastily to the
voice; and fell instantly asleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">IN the morning he woke with rheumatism in his
right shoulder. He lay considering this in slow amusement. There
was no end to what your subconscious and your body could achieve
between them. They would provide you with any alibi you wanted. A
perfectly good honest alibi. He had known husbands who developed
high temperatures and the symptoms of 'flu each time their wives
were on the point of departure to visit relations. He had known
women who were so tough that they could watch a razor fight unmoved
and yet would pass out in the deadest of dead faints when asked an
awkward question. ('Was the accused so persecuted by police
cross-examination that she was unconscious for fifteen minutes?'
'She fainted, certainly.' 'There was no question of a simulated
faint, was there? The doctor says that he saw her at the material
time and there was great difficulty in reviving her. And that
collapse was a direct result of the police cross-examination to
which she was being&mdash;' etc.) Oh, yes. There was no limit to
what your subconscious and your body could cook up together. And
today they had cooked up something that would keep him off the
river. His subconscious had wanted to go in to Scoone today and
talk to the librarian at the Public Library. His subconscious had
remembered, moreover, that it was market day and Tommy would be
taking the car into Scoone. So his subconscious had set to work on
the eternally sycophantic body and between them they had made a
tired shoulder muscle into an unworkable joint.</p>

<p>Very neat.</p>

<p>He got up and dressed, wincing each time he lifted an arm, and
went down to cadge a lift from Tommy. Tommy was heart-broken at his
disablement but delighted by his company, and they were so gay
together, this warm spring morning, and Grant was so filled with
the pleasure that ferreting out information always provided for
him, that they were running through the outer suburbs of Scoone
before he remembered that he was in a car. That he was shut into a
car.</p>

<p>He was enormously gratified.</p>

<p>He promised to meet Tommy for lunch at the Caledonian, and went
away to find the Public Library. But before he had gone far a new
idea struck him. The <i>Flying Highlander</i> would have come
clicking over the points at Scoone only a few hours ago. Every
twenty-four hours from year's end to year's end the <i>Flying
Highlander</i> made that night journey and came into Scoone in the
morning. And since the train crews habitually stuck to the same
run, alternating time on and time off, there was just the chance
that one of the staff who had come into Scoone on the <i>Flying
Highlander</i> this morning was Murdo Gallacher.</p>

<p>So he changed direction and went to the station instead.</p>

<p>'Were you on duty when the London mail arrived this morning?' he
asked a porter.</p>

<p>'No, but Lachie was,' said the porter. He stretched his mouth
into a line, let out a whistle that would have done credit to an
engine, tilted his head back an inch to summon a distant colleague,
and went back to reading the racing page of the <i>Clarion</i>.</p>

<p>Grant went to meet the slowly advancing Lachie and asked him the
same question.</p>

<p>Yes, Lachie had been on duty.</p>

<p>'Can you tell me if Murdo Gallacher was one of the sleeping-car
attendants?'</p>

<p>Lachie said that yes, Old Sourpuss was on her.</p>

<p>Could Lachie say where Old Sourpuss could be found now?</p>

<p>Lachie glanced up at the station clock. It was after eleven.</p>

<p>Yes, Lachie could say where he would be. He would be in the
Eagle Bar waiting for someone to stand him a drink.</p>

<p>So to the Eagle Bar at the back of Scoone Station Grant went,
and found that Lachie had been, in the main, right. Yughourt was
indeed there, mooning over a half pint. Grant ordered a whisky for
himself and saw Yughourt's ears prick.</p>

<p>'Good-morning,' he said amiably to Yughourt. 'I've had some very
good fishing since I saw you last.' And was pleased to notice the
hope grow on Yughourt's face.</p>

<p>'I'm glad of that, sir, very glad,' he said, pretending to
remember Grant. 'The Tay, is it?'</p>

<p>'No, the Turlie. By the way, what did your dead young man die
of? The one I left you trying to waken.' Antagonism began to wither
the eagerness on Yughourt's face. 'Won't you join me?' Grant added.
'A whisky?' Yughourt relaxed.</p>

<p>After that it was easy. Yughourt was still prickled with
resentment at the inconvenience that he had been caused. He had
even had to attend the inquest in his spare time. It was, Grant
thought, as easy as dealing with a toddler who has just learned to
run. It needed only a touch to steer him in any required
direction.</p>

<p>Yughourt had not only hated having to attend the inquest, he had
hated the inquest and he had hated every single soul connected with
the inquest. Between his hatred and two double whiskies he provided
Grant with the most detailed account of everyone and everything. He
was the best value for money that Grant had ever had. He had been
'on' in the affair from first to last; from the first appearance of
B Seven at Euston to the coroner's verdict. As a source of
information he was pure horse's-mouth, and he 'gave' like a beer
tap.</p>

<p>'Had he travelled with you before?' Grant asked.</p>

<p>No, Yughourt had never seen him before and was glad that he was
never going to again.</p>

<p>This was where Grant's satisfaction suddenly changed to
satiation. One more half-minute of Yughourt and he would be sick.
He pushed himself off the counter of the Eagle bar and went to look
for the Public Library.</p>

<p>The library was frightful beyond description: a monstrosity in
liver-coloured stone; but after Yughourt it seemed the fine flower
of civilisation. The assistants were charming and the librarian was
a thin little piece of faded elegance with a tie no broader than
the black silk ribbon of his eyeglasses. As an antidote to too much
Murdo Gallacher it could not have been better.</p>

<p>Little Mr Tallisker was a Scot from Orkney&mdash;which, he
pointed out, was not being a Scot at all&mdash;and he was both
interested in and knowledgeable about the Islands. He knew all
about the singing sands on Cladda. There were other alleged singing
sands, too (every Island wanted to have what its neighbours had as
soon as they heard about any new possession, whether it was a pier
or a legend), but the Cladda ones were the original. They lay, like
most of the Island sands, on the Atlantic side, facing the unbroken
ocean. Looking out to Tir nan Og. Which, as Mr Grant might know,
was the Gaelic heaven. The land of the eternally young. It was
interesting, wasn't it, how each people evolved their own idea of
Heaven? One as a feast of lovely women, one as forgetfulness, one
as continuous music and no work, one as good hunting grounds. The
Gaels, Mr Tallisker thought, had had the loveliest idea. The land
of youth.</p>

<p>What sang? Grant asked, interrupting the dissection of
comparative bliss.</p>

<p>It was a moot point, Mr Tallisker said. Indeed, you could have
it either way. He had walked them himself. Endless miles of pure
white sand by a brilliant sea. They did 'sing' as one trod on them,
but he himself held that 'squeak' would be a better description. On
the other hand on any day that provided a steady wind&mdash;and
such days were of no unusual occurrence in the Islands&mdash;the
fine, almost invisible, surface sand was swept along the wide
beaches so that they did in fact 'sing'.</p>

<p>From sand Grant led him to seals (the Islands were full of seal
stories, it seemed; the translation of seals into men and vice
versa; if they were to be believed half the population of the
Islands had some seal blood in them) and from seals to walking
stones, and on all Mr Tallisker was interesting and informative.
But on streams he fell down. Streams seemed to be the only things
on Cladda that were exactly like their counterpart anywhere else.
Except that they too often spread into little lochs or lost
themselves in bog, the streams of Cladda were just streams; water
in the process of finding its own level.</p>

<p>Well, thought Grant, going away to meet Tommy for lunch, that in
a way was 'standing'. Running into standing water; into bog. B
Seven might have used the word because he needed the rhyme. He had
wanted something to rhyme with sand.</p>

<p>He listened with only half an ear to the talk of the two fellow
sheep-farmers that Tommy brought to lunch, and envied them their
untroubled eyes and their air of unlimited leisure. Nothing hounded
these large <i>rangé</i> creatures. Their flocks were decimated
every now and then by strokes of fate; great snowstorms or swift
disease. But they themselves stayed quiet and sane, like the hills
that bred them. Big slow men, full of little jokes and pleased with
small things. Grant was very conscious that his obsession with B
Seven was an unreasonable thing; abnormal; that it was part of his
illness. That in his sober mind he would not have thought a second
time about B Seven. He resented his obsession and clung to it. It
was at once his bane and his refuge.</p>

<p>But he drove home with Tommy even more cheerful than when he had
set out. There was practically nothing about the inquest on Charles
Martin, French mechanic, that he did not now know. He was that much
to the good. And that was a lot.</p>

<p>After supper that night he discarded the book on European
politics which had shared with Tommy's telephone his interest on
the previous evening and went hunting along the bookshelves for
something about the Islands.</p>

<p>'Are you looking for anything in particular, Alan?' Laura asked,
looking up from <i>The Times</i>.</p>

<p>'I'm looking for something about the Islands.'</p>

<p>'The Hebrides?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I suppose there is a book about them.'</p>

<p>'Hah!' said Laura, mock amused. 'Is there a book about them!
There's a whole literature, my dear. It's a distinction in Scotland
not to have written a book about the Islands.'</p>

<p>'Have you any of them?'</p>

<p>'We have practically all of them. Everyone who has ever come to
stay here has brought one.'</p>

<p>'Why didn't they take them away with them?'</p>

<p>'You'll see why when you have a taste of them. You'll find them
on the bottom shelf. A whole row of them.'</p>

<p>He began to go through the row, gutting the books with a swift
practised eye.</p>

<p>'Why this sudden interest in the Hebrides?' Laura asked.</p>

<p>'Those singing sands that Wee Archie talked about stuck in my
mind.'</p>

<p>'That must be the first time Wee Archie has ever said anything
that stuck in someone's mind.'</p>

<p>'I expect his mother remembers his first word,' Tommy put in
from behind the <i>Clarion</i>.</p>

<p>'It seems that Tir nan Og is just one jump west from the singing
sands.'</p>

<p>'So is America,' said Laura. 'Which is much nearer the
Islanders' idea of Heaven than Tir nan Og is.'</p>

<p>Grant, repeating Mr Tallisker's speech on comparative heavens,
said that the Gaels were the only race who visualised Heaven as a
country of the young; which was endearing of them.</p>

<p>'They are the only known race who have no word for no,' Laura
said drily. 'That is a much more revealing characteristic than
their notions of eternity.'</p>

<p>Grant came back to the fire with an armful of books and began to
go through them at leisure.</p>

<p>'It is difficult to imagine a mind that has never evolved a word
for no, isn't it?' Laura said musingly, and went back to <i>The
Times</i>.</p>

<p>The books varied from the scientific, through the sentimental,
to the purely fantastic. From kelp-burning to the saints and
heroes. From bird-watching to soul's pilgrimages. They varied, too,
from the admirable but dull to the unbelievably bad. It seemed that
no one who had ever visited the Islands had refrained from writing
about them. The bibliographies at the end of the soberer books
would have done justice to the Roman Empire. On one thing all were
agreed, however: the Islands were magic. The Islands were the last
refuge of civilisation in a world gone mad. The Islands were
beautiful beyond imagining; a world carpeted with wild flowers and
bounded by a sea that broke in sapphire on silver beaches. A land
of brilliant sunlight; of good-looking people and heart-searching
music. Wild, lovely music handed down from the beginning of time,
from an age when the gods were young. And if you wanted to go
there, see MacBrayne's time-table on Page 3 of the Appendix.</p>

<p>The books lasted Grant very happily until bed-time. And while
they drank their nightcaps he said: 'I'd like to have a look at the
Islands.'</p>

<p>'Make a plan for next year,' Tommy said, agreeing. 'There's
quite good fishing on Lewis.'</p>

<p>'No, I mean now.'</p>

<p>'Go now!' Laura said. 'I never heard anything so daft.'</p>

<p>'Why? I can't fish until my shoulder is better, so I might as
well go exploring.'</p>

<p>'Your shoulder will be better in two days with my
treatment.'</p>

<p>'How does one get to Cladda?'</p>

<p>'From Oban, I should think,' Tommy said.</p>

<p>'Alan Grant, don't be absurd. If you can't fish for a day or two
there are a hundred other things you can do instead of being
bucketed about on a Minch crossing in March.'</p>

<p>'Spring comes early to the Islands, they say.'</p>

<p>'It doesn't to the Minch, believe me.'</p>

<p>'You could fly, of course,' Tommy said, considering the subject
as he considered everything that was put in front of him, with a
kind sobriety. 'You could fly one day and come back the next, if
you liked. It's quite a good service.'</p>

<p>There was a little silence while Grant met his cousin's eye. She
knew that he could not fly; and why.</p>

<p>'Give it up, Alan,' she said, in a kinder tone. 'There are much
nicer things to do than being stood on one's head in the middle of
the Minch in March. If you just want to get away from Clune for a
bit why don't you hire a car&mdash;there's a very good garage in
Scoone&mdash;and go exploring on the mainland for a week or so? Now
that the weather is soft it will be getting green in the West.'</p>

<p>'It isn't that I want to get away from Clune. Quite the
contrary. If I could take Clune <i>en bloc</i> with me I would. It
is just that I have got bitten with the idea of those sands.'</p>

<p>He saw Laura begin to consider the idea from a new angle, and he
could follow her thought quite well. If this was what his sick mind
wanted, then it would be wrong to try to dissuade him. The interest
of a place he had never seen before should be an ideal
counteraction to self-conscious brooding.</p>

<p>'Oh, well, what you want is a Bradshaw, I suppose. We do have
one, but it's mostly used as a door-stop or a step for the top
bookshelf, so it's a little out of date.'</p>

<p>'As far as the services to the Outer Islands are concerned, it
won't matter what the date of it is,' said Tommy. 'The Laws of the
Medes and the Persians are not more unchangeable than MacBrayne's
schedules. As someone has remarked, they don't exactly encroach on
eternity but they very nearly outlast time.'</p>

<p>So Grant found the Bradshaw and took it to bed with him.</p>

<p>And in the morning he borrowed a small case from Tommy, and
packed into it the bare necessities of existence for a week or so.
He had always had a passion for travelling light, and it always
pleased him to be getting away by himself, even from people he
loved (a trait that had done much to keep him single) and he caught
himself whistling under his breath as he put the few things into
the small space. He had not whistled to himself since the shadow of
unreason had reached out and taken the sunlight from him.</p>

<p>He was going to be foot-loose again; foot-loose. It was a
beautiful thought.</p>

<p>Laura had promised to drive him into Scoone in time to catch the
train to Oban, but Graham was late in coming back with the car from
Moymore village, so that it was touch-and-go whether he caught the
train at all. They made it with thirty seconds to spare, and a
breathless Laura pushed a bundle of papers into the open window as
the train pulled out, and gasped: 'Enjoy yourself, my dear.
Seasickness does wonders for the liver.'</p>

<p>He sat, alone in the compartment, in a daze of contentment with
the magazines unheeded on the seat beside him. He watched the bare
empty landscape trundle by and grow slowly greener as they went
west. He had no idea why he was going to Cladda. It was certainly
not to gather information in the police sense. He was
going&mdash;to find B Seven. That is as near as it could be put
into words. He wanted to go and see this place which so nearly
reproduced the landscape of the poem. He wondered, sunk in sleepy
bliss, whether B Seven had ever talked to anyone about his
Paradise. He remembered the writing and thought not. Those tightly
arcaded M's and N's were too defensive to have been made by a
talker. In any case, it didn't matter how many people he had talked
to about the thing, since there was no way of making contact with
them. He could hardly put an advertisement in the papers saying:
Read this poem and tell me if you recognise it.</p>

<p>Or&mdash;why couldn't he?</p>

<p>His sleepiness fell from him while he considered this new
angle.</p>

<p>He considered it all the way to Oban.</p>

<p>In Oban he went to a hotel, ordered a self-congratulatory drink,
and while he consumed it he wrote to each of the London daily
papers enclosing a cheque and asking them to print an identical
notice in their personal column. The notice said:</p>

<blockquote>'The beasts that talk, the streams that stand, the
stones that walk, the singing sand....Anyone recognising please
communicate with A. Grant, c/o P.O., Moymore,
Comrieshire.'</blockquote>

<p>The only daily papers to which he did not send this appeal were
the <i>Clarion</i> and <i>The Times</i>. He did not want Clune to
think that he had taken leave of his senses altogether.</p>

<p>As he made his way along the front to the cockleshell in which
he was due to brave the Minch, he thought: 'It will serve me right
if someone writes to say that the thing is one of the best-known
lines of some Xanadu concoction of Coleridge's, and that I must be
illiterate not to have known it!'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">THE wallpaper consisted of far too heavy roses
hanging from a far too slender trellis-work, and the insecure
character of the whole thing was increased by the fact that the
paper not only hung away from the wall but moved about in the
draught. It was not readily obvious where the draught came from
because the small window was not only tightly shut but had patently
been tightly shut since its manufacture and original insertion in
the house structure about the beginning of the century. The little
swing mirror on the chest of drawers lived up to its promise in the
first respect but not in the second. It would swing with ease
amounting to abandon through the whole circle of three hundred and
sixty degrees; but it did not reflect anything to any noticeable
degree. A last year's cardboard calendar folded in four kept its
gyratory talents in check, but nothing of course could be done to
increase its powers of reflection.</p>

<p>Two of the four drawers in the chest were capable of being
opened. The third would not open because it had lost its knob, and
the fourth because it had lost the will. Above the black iron
fireplace with its frill of red crinkled paper brown with age was
an engraving of a partially clothed Venus comforting a quite
unclothed Cupid. If the cold had not already eaten into his bones
Grant thought that this picture would have finished the
process.</p>

<p>He looked from the little window down on the small harbour with
its collection of fishing-boats, at the grey sea slapping drearily
against the breakwater, and the grey rain beating on the cobbles,
and thought of the log fire in the sitting-room at Clune. He toyed
with the idea of going to bed as the quickest way of getting warm,
but a second glance at the bed dissuaded him. Its plate-like
thinness was made even more plate-like by the meagre covering of a
white honeycomb cotton cover. At the foot, a turkey-red cotton
quilt suitable for a doll's perambulator was folded into an
elaborate pattern. Above it brooded the finest collection of
unmatching brass knobs that it had ever been Grant's fortune to
meet.</p>

<p>Cladda Hotel. The gateway to Tir nan Og.</p>

<p>He went downstairs and poked the smoky fire in the sitting-room.
Someone had banked up the fire with the potato peelings from lunch,
so his efforts were not very successful. Rage came to his rescue
and he rang the bell with all his might. The wires jangled in a
crazy dance somewhere in the walls but no bell rang. He went out
into the lobby where the wind was coming soughing in under the
front door and shouted. Never, even in his best form on the
'square', had he used his voice with so passionate a determination
to produce results. A young female creature came from the back
regions and stared at him. She had a face like a rather practical
Madonna and legs the same length as her body.</p>

<p>'Wis yu bawling?' she asked.</p>

<p>'No, I wasn't bawling. That sound you heard was my teeth
chattering. In my country a sitting-room fire is designed to give
out heat not to consume refuse.'</p>

<p>She looked at him a little longer as if translating his speech
into a more understandable idiom, and then moved past him to look
at the fire.</p>

<p>'<i>Oh Dé</i>,' she said, 'that will never do. Stop you and I'll
get you a bit of fire.'</p>

<p>She went away and came back with what seemed to be most of the
kitchen fire blazing on a shovel. Before he could remove some of
the packed dross and vegetable matter from the grate she had dumped
the flaming mass on top of all.</p>

<p>'I'll be getting some tea to warm you,' she said. 'Mr Todd is
down at the pier seeing did the things come on the boat. He'll be
back in no time at all.'</p>

<p>She said it comfortingly, as if the presence of the proprietor
would automatically be warming. Grant took it for granted that she
was apologising for the absence of an official welcome to a
guest.</p>

<p>He sat and watched the kitchen fire gradually lose heart as it
became conscious of the bed of potato peelings on which it had been
cast away. He did his best to rake out some of the damp black mass
from underneath so as to provide an encouraging draught, but the
thing merely settled down in a sad heap. He watched the glow fade
until only little red worms of incandescence ran to and fro across
the surface of the blackened coals as the passing wind sucked the
air from the room into the chimney. He thought of putting on his
waterproof and walking in the rain; walking in the rain could be a
delightful thing. But the thought of hot tea held him where he
was.</p>

<p>After nearly an hour of firewatching, no tea had come. But 'N.
Todd, Prop.' came back from the harbour, accompanied by a boy in a
navy-blue jersey pushing a wheelbarrow laden with large cardboard
cartons, and came in to welcome his guest. They did not expect
guests at this time of the year, he said; he thought when he had
seen him come off the boat that he would be staying with someone on
the island. Gathering songs, or something.</p>

<p>There was something in the way he said 'gathering songs'&mdash;a
detached tone bordering on comment&mdash;that made Grant sure that
he was no native.</p>

<p>No, said Mr Todd, when asked, he did not belong to the place. He
had had a good little commercial hotel in the Lowlands, but this
was more to his taste. And, seeing the surprise on his guest's face
he added: 'To tell you the truth, Mr Grant, I was tired of
counter-rappers. You know: the kind of chap who can't wait a
minute. Out here no one ever thinks of rapping on a counter. Today,
tomorrow, or next week is all the same to an Islander. It's a bit
maddening now and then, when you want something done, but for most
of the time it's fine and restful. My blood pressure's away down.'
He noticed the fire. 'That's a poor sort of fire Katie-Ann's given
you. You'd better come ben to my office and warm yourself.'</p>

<p>At this moment Katie-Ann put her head in at the door and said
that it had taken all this time to boil the kettle because the
kitchen fire had gone out on her, and would Mr Grant now think it a
good thing to have his tea and his high-tea at one and the same
time. Grant did indeed think it a good thing, and as she went away
to prepare this evening repast he asked his host for a drink.</p>

<p>'The magistrates took away the licence from my predecessor, and
I haven't yet got it back. I'll get it back at the next Licensing
Court. So I can't sell you a drink. There isn't a licence on the
island. But if you'll come ben to my office I'll be glad to stand
you a whisky.'</p>

<p>The office was a tiny place, tropical in its breathless heat.
Grant savoured the oven atmosphere gratefully, and drank the bad
whisky neat, as it was proffered. He took the indicated chair and
stretched out his feet to the blaze.</p>

<p>'You're not an authority on the island, then,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr Todd grinned. 'In one way I am,' he said wickedly. 'But
probably not the way you mean it.'</p>

<p>'To whom should I go to learn about the place?'</p>

<p>'Well, there's two authorities. Father Heslop and the Reverend
Mr MacKay. On the whole perhaps Father Heslop would be better.'</p>

<p>'You think he is the more knowledgeable?'</p>

<p>'No; they're about fifty-fifty as far as that goes. But
two-thirds of the islanders are R.C. If you go to the priest you'll
only have a third of the population against you, instead of
two-thirds. Of course the Presbyterian third are much nastier
customers to be up against, but if numbers count with you then
you'd better see Father Heslop. Better see Father Heslop anyway.
I'm a heathen myself so I'm an outcast from both flocks, but Father
Heslop is for a Licence and Mr MacKay dead against it.' He grinned
again and refilled Grant's glass.</p>

<p>'I take it the priest would rather see the stuff sold openly
than drunk on the sly.'</p>

<p>'That's it.'</p>

<p>'Did you ever have a visitor called Charles Martin staying
here?'</p>

<p>'Martin? No. Not in my time. But if you'd like to look through
the visitors' book it's on the table in the lobby.'</p>

<p>'If a visitor doesn't stay at the hotel where would he be likely
to stay? In rooms?'</p>

<p>'No, no one lets rooms on the island. The houses are too small
for that. They'd stay either with Father Heslop or at the
manse.'</p>

<p>By the time that Katie-Ann came to say that his tea was waiting
on him in the sitting-room the blood was flowing freely again
through Grant's once-moribund body and he was hungry. He looked
forward to his first meal in this 'tiny oasis of civilisation in a
barbarous world' (see <i>Dream Islands</i> by H. G. F.
Pynche-Maxwell, Beal and Batter, 15/6). He rather hoped that it
might not be either salmon or sea-trout, having had an elegant
sufficiency of both in the last eight or nine days. He would not
turn up his nose at a piece of grilled sea-trout if it happened to
be that. Grilled with some local butter. But he hoped for
lobster&mdash;the island was famous for its lobsters&mdash;and
failing that some herring fresh from the sea, split, and fried
after being dipped in oatmeal.</p>

<p>His first meal in the isles of delight consisted of a couple of
bright orange kippers inadequately cured and liberally dyed in
Aberdeen, bread made in Glasgow, oatcakes baked by a factory in
Edinburgh and never toasted since, jam manufactured in Dundee, and
butter made in Canada. The only local produce was a pallid,
haggis-shaped mound of crowdie; a white crumbly by-product without
smell or taste.</p>

<p>The sitting-room in unshaded lamplight was even less appetising
than it had been in the grey light of afternoon, and Grant fled to
his freezing little bedroom. He demanded two hot-water bottles and
suggested to Katie-Ann that since he was the sole guest she should
filch the quilts from every other bedroom in the house and dedicate
them to his use. She did this with all her native Celt pleasure in
the irregular, heaping his bed with borrowed luxury and suffocating
with giggles.</p>

<p>He lay under the five meagre bits of wadding, topped off with
his own coat and Burberry, and pretended that the whole thing was
one good English eiderdown. As he grew warm he became conscious of
the cold stuffiness of the room. This was the last straw and quite
suddenly he began to laugh. He lay there and laughed as he had not
laughed for nearly a year. Laughed till the tears came, laughed
until he was so exhausted that he could no more, and lay spent and
purged and happy under his fine variety of bedclothes.</p>

<p>Laughter must do untold things for one's endocrine glands, he
thought, feeling the well-being flood through him in a life-giving
tide. More especially, perhaps, when it is laughter at oneself. At
the fine glorious absurdity of oneself in relation to the world. To
set out for the threshold of Tir nan Og and fetch up at the Cladda
Hotel had an exquisite ridiculousness. If the Islands provided him
with nothing but this he would consider himself well rewarded.</p>

<p>He ceased to care that the room was airless and the covers
insecure. He lay looking at the rose-heavy wallpaper and wished
that he could show it to Laura. He remembered that he had not yet
been transferred into that newly-decorated bedroom at Clune which,
up till now, had always been his. Was Laura expecting another
visitor? Was it possible that her latest candidate for his
affections was to be housed under the same roof? So far he had been
happily free of female society; the evenings at Clune had been
family evenings, peaceful and long-breathing. Had Laura been merely
holding her hand until he was, so to speak, able to sit up and take
notice? She had been suspiciously regretful that he was going to
miss the opening of the new hall at Moymore. A ceremony that she
would have in her normal mind not expected him to attend at all.
Had she expected a guest for the opening? The bedroom could not be
meant for Lady Kentallen, because she would come over from Angus
and go back the same afternoon. Then for whom was that bedroom
redecorated and kept empty?</p>

<p>He was still turning the small question over in his mind when he
fell asleep. And it was only in the morning that it occurred to him
that he had hated the closed window because it made the room stuffy
and not because it was closed.</p>

<p>He washed in the two pints of tepid water that Katie-Ann brought
him and went downstairs rejoicing. He felt on top of the world. He
ate the Glasgow bread, still another day older this morning, and
the Edinburgh oatcakes, and the Dundee jam, and the Canadian
butter, together with some sausages from the English midlands, and
enjoyed them. Having given up his expectation of primitive
elegance, he was prepared to accept primitive existence.</p>

<p>He was gratified to find that in spite of cold wind and wet
weather and thinly covered hard beds his rheumatism had entirely
gone, being no longer needed by his subconscious to provide an
alibi. The wind was still howling in the chimney and the water
spouting up from the breakwater, but the rain had stopped. He put
on his Burberry and tacked round the harbour front to the shop.
There were only two places of business in the row of houses that
fringed the harbour: a post-office and a provision merchant. These
two between them supplied the island with all that it needed. The
post-office was also a newsagent; and the provision merchant was a
combination of grocer, ironmonger, chemist, draper, shoe-shop,
tobacconist, china-merchant, and ship's chandler. Bolts of sprigged
cotton for curtains or dresses lay on shelves alongside the biscuit
tins, and hams hung from the roof among strings of locknit
undergarments. Today, Grant noticed, there was also a large wooden
tray of tuppenny buns baked, if the paper round the queen cakes was
to be believed, in Oban. They were crummy and depressed-looking, as
if they had been tumbled about in one of the cardboard cartons that
were such an indispensable part of island life, and they smelled
very faintly of paraffin, but he supposed that they made a change
from the Glasgow bread.</p>

<p>In the shop were several men from the fishing-boats in the
harbour and a little round man in a black raincoat who could be
nothing but a priest. This was a fortunate thing. Even the
Presbyterian third, he felt, could hardly hold against him a
fortuitous meeting in a public store. He edged in beside His
Reverence and waited with him while the fishermen were being
served. After that it was plain sailing. The priest 'picked him up'
and he had five witnesses to it. Moreover, Father Heslop deftly
included the proprietor, one Duncan Tavish, in the conversation,
and, from the fact that Father Heslop called him Mr Tavish and not
Duncan, Grant deduced that the proprietor was not one of his flock.
So he was very happily parcelled out among the islanders over the
paraffiny buns and the margarine, and there would be no internecine
war over the possession of his person.</p>

<p>He went out into the gale with Father Heslop and strolled home
with him. Or rather they beat up against the wind together,
staggering a few steps forward at a time, and shouting remarks to
each other above the noise of their flapping garments. Grant had
the advantage of his companion in that he wore no hat, but Father
Heslop was not only lower on the ground but had a figure ideally
streamlined for life in a gale. He had no angles anywhere.</p>

<p>It was good to go in from the blast to a warm turf fire and
silence.</p>

<p>'Morag!' called Father Heslop, into the further end of the
house, 'Some tea for me and my friend here. And a scone maybe, like
a good girl.'</p>

<p>But Morag had not baked, any more than Katie-Ann had. They were
given Marie biscuits, a little soft in the island dampness. But the
tea was wonderful.</p>

<p>Because he knew that he was an object of curiosity to Father
Heslop, as he was to everyone on the island, he said that he had
been fishing with relations in Scotland, but had to stop owing to a
bad shoulder. And because he had been bitten with the idea of the
Islands, and more especially with the Singing Sands on Cladda, he
had taken the chance of coming to see them; a chance he might never
have presented to him again. He supposed that Father Heslop was
well acquainted with the sands?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, of course Father Heslop knew the sands. He had been
fifteen years on the island. They were on the west side of the
island, facing the Atlantic. It was no distance across the island.
Grant could walk there this afternoon.</p>

<p>'I would rather wait for fine weather. It would be better to see
them in sunlight, wouldn't it?'</p>

<p>'At this time of year you might wait for weeks before you'd see
them in sunlight.'</p>

<p>'I thought spring came early to the Islands?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I think, myself, that's just an idea of the people who
write books about them. This is my sixteenth spring on Cladda, and
I have yet to catch one here before its time. The spring's an
Islander too,' he added with a little smile.</p>

<p>They talked of the weather, the winter gales (which made today,
according to Father Heslop, a thing of zephyrs), the penetrating
damp, the occasionally idyllic summer days.</p>

<p>Why had a place of so few attractions captured the imagination
of so many people, Grant wanted to know.</p>

<p>Well, partly it was that they saw it only at high summer, and
partly it was that those who came and were disappointed, were
reluctant to admit their disappointment either to themselves or the
friends they had left behind. They compensated themselves by
talking big. But it was Father Heslop's own theory that most people
who came were unconsciously running away from life, and they found
what their imaginations prepared for them. Through their eyes the
Islands were beautiful.</p>

<p>Grant thought this over, and then asked him if he had ever known
a Charles Martin, who had been interested in singing sands.</p>

<p>No; Father Heslop had never met a Charles Martin, as far as he
could remember. Had he come to Cladda?</p>

<p>Grant did not know.</p>

<p>He went out into the blast, and was blown back to the hotel at
an undignified trot, teetering on his toes like an elderly toper.
The bare lobby at the hotel smelled of unidentifiable hot food and
sang like a choir as the wind came shrieking in under the outside
door. But they had managed a fire that looked like a fire, in the
sitting-room. To the scream of wind in the passage and the yowling
of wind in the chimney he ate beef from South America, carrots
tinned in Lincolnshire, potatoes grown in Moray, milk pudding
packaged in North London, and fruit bottled in the Vale of Evesham.
Now that he was no longer conditioned to magic, he filled his
stomach thankfully with what was put in front of him. If Cladda had
denied him spiritual joy it had provided him with a fine physical
appetite.</p>

<p>'Don't you ever bake scones, Katie-Ann?' he said, when he was
arranging the time of his high tea.</p>

<p>'Is it scones you'll be wanting?' she said surprised. 'Indeed,
yes, I'll bake you some. But we have baker's cakes for your tea.
And biscuits, and ginger-snaps. Would you rather be having scones
than them?'</p>

<p>Remembering the 'baker's cakes' Grant said enthusiastically that
he would, he would indeed.</p>

<p>'Well, then,' she said kindly, 'of course, I'll bake you a
scone.'</p>

<p>For an hour he walked; along a flat grey road through a flat
grey desolation. To his right, distant in the mist, was a hill; the
only visible height. The whole thing was as inspiring as the fens
on a wet January day. Every now and then the wind on his left flank
would send him spinning sideways off the road altogether, and he
struggled back half amused, half irritated. At long distances, odd
cottages lay cowering close to the earth, blind and limpet-like,
without any sign of human habitation. Some had stones slung from
the roof by ropes to weight the structure against the wind's
importunity. None of them had fence, outhouse, garden or bush. It
was living at its most primitive; inside four walls; everything
under hatches and battened down.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, the wind smelt salt.</p>

<p>And in less than half an hour he came on it. He came on it
without warning, across a great waste of wet green grass that in
summer-time must be starred with flowers. There had been no visible
reason why the long levels of grassy land should not go on for ever
to the horizon; it was all part of this flat grey endless world of
bog. He had been prepared to go on walking to the horizon; so that
he was startled to find that the horizon was ten miles out at sea.
There it lay in front of him, the Atlantic; and if it was not
beautiful it was, nevertheless, impressive in its sweep and
simplicity. The dirty green water, dirty and ragged, roared on to
the beach and broke in a flash of white that was vicious. To right
and left, as far as eye could see, were the long lines of breaking
water and the pale sands. There was nothing else in all the world
but the green torn sea and the sands.</p>

<p>He stood there looking at it, and remembering that the nearest
land was America. Not since he had stood in the North African
desert had he known that uncanny feeling that is born of unlimited
space. That feeling of human diminution.</p>

<p>So sudden had been the presence of the sea, and its rage and
extent so overwhelming, that he had hung there motionless for
several moments before realising that here were the sands that had
brought him to the fringe of the western world in March. These were
the singing sands.</p>

<p>Nothing sang today but the wind and the Atlantic. Together they
made a Wagnerian tumult that buffeted one almost as physically as
did the gale and the spray. The whole world was one mad uproar of
grey-green and white and wild noise.</p>

<p>He walked down over the fine white sand to the edge of the
water, and let the tumult roar over him. At close quarters it had a
senseless quality that dissolved his uncomfortable sense of
diminution and made him feel human and superior. He turned his back
on it almost contemptuously as one would on a bad-mannered child
who was making an exhibition of himself. He felt warm and alive and
master of himself; admirably intelligent and gratifyingly sentient.
He walked back up the sand, absurdly, and extravagantly glad to be
a human being and alive. The air that came off the land when he had
turned his back on the salt sterile wind from the sea was gentle
and warm. It was like opening the door of a house. He went on
across the grassy levels without once looking back. The wind
hounded him along the flat bogs, but it was no longer in his face
and the salt was no longer in his nostrils. His nostrils were full
of the good smell of damp earth; the smell of growing things.</p>

<p>He was happy.</p>

<p>As he came at last down the slope to the harbour he looked up at
the hill in the mist and decided that tomorrow he would climb
it.</p>

<p>He came back to the hotel ravenous, and was gratified to be
given no fewer than two items of local manufacture for his high
tea. One was a plate of Katie-Ann's scones, and the other was
'sleeshacks': a delicacy he had known of old. Sleeshacks were
mashed potatoes fried in slices; and they certainly helped to make
appetising the remains of cold beef from lunch which was the
<i>pièce de résistance</i> of the meal. But as he ate his first
course he kept smelling something more evocative of those early
Strathspey days than even sleeshacks could be. An aroma both sharp
and subtle it was, floating and circling about his brain in a
nostalgic tantalisation. It was not until he had put his knife into
one of Katie-Ann's scones that he knew what it was. The scone was
yellow with soda and quite uneatable. With a regretful salute to
her for the memory (platefuls of yellow soda-laden scones laid out
in the farmhouse kitchen table for the farm-hands' tea: Oh, Tir nan
Og!) he buried two of Katie-Ann's scones under the glowing coals in
the grate and made do with the Glasgow bread.</p>

<p>And that night he fell asleep without looking at the wallpaper
and without remembering the closed window at all.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">IN the morning he ran into the Reverend Mr MacKay
in the post-office and felt that he was distributing his favours
very successfully. Mr MacKay was on his way down to the harbour to
see if the crew of a Swedish fishing-boat that was lying there
would like to come to church if they were still there the day after
tomorrow. There was also, he understood, a Dutch vessel, that might
be presumed to be of a Presbyterian persuasion. If they showed
signs of wanting to come he would prepare a sermon in the English
for them.</p>

<p>He condoled with Grant about the rough weather. It was early in
the year for the Islands, but he supposed that one had to take
holidays when one was given them.</p>

<p>'You'll be a schoolmaster, maybe, Mr Grant.'</p>

<p>No, Grant said, he was a Civil Servant. Which was his normal
answer to questions about his profession. People were prepared to
believe that Civil Servants were human beings; no one ever believed
that a policeman was one. They were two-dimensional characters with
silver buttons and a notebook.</p>

<p>'You'd be amazed, now, you that has not been here before, if you
could see what the Islands are like in June, Mr Grant. Not a cloud
in the sky, day after day, and the air so hot that ye'll see it
dancing before you. And the mirage as mad as ever it was in the
desert.'</p>

<p>'Were you in North Africa?'</p>

<p>Och, yes; Mr MacKay had been in North Africa with the Jocks.
'And believe me, Mr Grant, I've seen odder things from my window up
in the manse there than ever I did between Alamein and Tripoli.
I've seen the lighthouse on the point there standing up in the air.
Yes, halfway up the sky. I've seen the hill there change shape till
it looked like a great mushroom. And as for the rocks by the sea,
those great pillars of stone, they can turn light and transparent
and move about as if they were walking through a set of the
Lancers.'</p>

<p>Grant considered this with interest, and ceased to listen to the
rest of Mr MacKay's discourse. As he parted from him alongside the
<i>Ann Loefquist</i> of Goteborg, Mr MacKay hoped that he was
coming to the <i>ceilidh</i> tonight. All the island would be there
and he would hear some fine singing.</p>

<p>When he asked his host about the <i>ceilidh</i> and where it was
being held, Mr Todd said that it would be the usual mixture of song
and talk and end up with the usual dance and that it would be held
in the only place on the island suitable for such a
gathering&mdash;the Peregrine Hall.</p>

<p>'Why Peregrine?'</p>

<p>'That is the name of the lady who gave it. She used to come to
the island in the summer and she was all for improving trade and
making the islanders self-supporting, so she built a fine long hut
with big windows and skylights so that they could weave in company
and not be ruining their eyes over looms in tiny dark rooms. They
should get together, she said, and have a Cladda mark for their
tweed and make it sought-after, like Harris. She could have saved
her breath and her bawbees, poor lady. No islander would walk a
yard to work. They would rather go blind than move out of their own
light. But the hut is very useful for island gatherings. Why don't
you have a look in tonight when it gets going?'</p>

<p>Grant said that he would do that, and went away to spend the
rest of the day climbing Cladda's solitary hill. There was no mist
today although the wind was still moisture-laden, and as he went
upward the seas opened under him, scattered with islands and
streaked with the tides. Here and there a single line, unnaturally
straight in this arrangement of nature, marked the track of a ship.
From the top he had the whole Hebridean world at his feet. He sat
there and considered it, this barren water-logged universe, and it
seemed to him the ultimate in desolation. A world half-emerged from
chaos, formless and void. Looking down on Cladda itself it was
impossible to tell, so mixed were sea and land, whether one was
looking at a land full of lochs or a sea full of islands. It was a
place best left to the grey geese and the seals.</p>

<p>He was happy up there, however; watching the changing patterns
on the sea floor, violet and grey and green; watching the sea birds
soar to inspect him and the flutter of nesting plovers on the low
ground. Thinking about Mr MacKay's mirages and the stones that
walked. Thinking, as he never ceased for any length of time to
think, about B Seven. Here was B Seven's world, according to
specification. The singing sands, the talking beasts, the walking
stones, the streams that ceased to run. What had B Seven intended
to do here? Just to come, as he himself had done, and look?</p>

<p>A flying dash, with an overnight case. That surely portended one
of two things: a meeting, or an inspection. Since no one had yet
missed him, then it could not have been a rendezvous. Therefore it
was an inspection. One could go to inspect many things: a house; a
prospect; a painting. But if one was driven to write verse <i>en
route</i> then the verse was surely a pointer to the subject for
inspection.</p>

<p>What had held B Seven in bondage to this bleak world? Had he
been reading too many books by H. G. F. Pynche-Maxwell and his
like? Had he forgotten that the silver sands and the wild flowers
and the sapphire seas were strictly seasonal?</p>

<p>From the top of the hill at Cladda, Grant sent B Seven a salute
and a blessing. But for B Seven he would not be sitting above this
sodden world feeling like a king. New-born and self-owning. He was
something more than B Seven's champion now: he was his debtor. His
servant.</p>

<p>As he left the shelter he had found for himself the wind caught
him in the chest, and he leaned on it as he went downhill as he
used to when he was a boy, so that it supported him and he could
almost fall downhill in the most surprising manner and still be
safe.</p>

<p>'How long do gales usually last in this part of the world?' he
asked his host as they staggered through the darkness after supper
towards the <i>ceilidh</i>.</p>

<p>'Three days is the minimum,' Mr Todd said, 'but that doesn't
happen often. Last winter it blew for a month on end. You got so
used to the roar of it that if it died away for a moment you
thought you'd gone deaf. You'd be better to fly back, when you go,
than cross the Minch in this weather. Most people fly nowadays,
even the old people who've never seen a train. They take aeroplanes
for granted.'</p>

<p>It occurred to Grant that he might indeed fly back. That if he
waited another few days, if he had a little longer to grow
accustomed to his new-found well-being, he might use the air
journey as a test. It would be a pretty severe test; the severest
he could subject himself to. To any claustrophobic the prospect of
being boxed into a small space and hung helplessly in the air was
sheer horror. If he faced it without wincing, and accomplished it
without disaster, then he could pronounce himself cured. He would
be a man again.</p>

<p>But he would wait a little; it was too early yet to ask himself
the question.</p>

<p>The <i>ceilidh</i> had been in progress for some twenty minutes
when they arrived, and they stood with the rest of the male
population at the back. Only the women and the ancients occupied
the chairs in the hall. Except for a row of male heads in the very
front, where the Importances of the island sat (Duncan Tavish, the
merchant, who was uncrowned king of Cladda, the two Churches, and
some lesser lights), the male population lined the walls at the
back and clustered round the entrance. It was an abnormally
cosmopolitan gathering, Grant noticed, as the outsiders made way
for them; both the Swedes and the Hollanders had come in force, and
there were accents that belonged to the Aberdeenshire coast.</p>

<p>A girl was singing in a thin soprano. Her voice was sweet and
true but without expression. It was like someone trying over an air
on a flute. She was succeeded by a self-confident youngish man who
received an ovation, on which he plumed himself so obviously that
it was funny; one waited for him to bill his breast feathers like a
bird. He was a great favourite, it seemed, with audiences of exiled
Gaels on the mainland and spent more time being encored there than
he did on his neglected croft. He sang a hearty ditty in a rough
over-worked tenor and was cheered to the echo. It surprised Grant a
little that he had never bothered to learn the rudiments of
singing. He must, in his jaunts to the mainland, have met real
singers, who had been taught how to use their voices; even in the
case of someone so vain it was astonishing that he had not been
moved to learn the basis of the art he professed.</p>

<p>Another woman sang another expressionless song, contralto, and a
man recited a funny story. Except for the few phrases that he had
learned from the old folk in Strathspey when he was a child, Grant
understood no Gaelic, and listened as he would have listened to an
entertainment in Italian or Tamil. Except for the delight of the
people themselves in the thing, it was a sufficiently dull affair.
The songs were musically negligible; some of them deplorable. If
this was the kind of thing that people came to the Hebrides to
'gather', then they were hardly worth the gathering. The few
inspired songs had, like all products of inspiration, gone over the
world on their own wings. It was better that these feeble
imitations should be left to die.</p>

<p>Throughout the concert there was a continuous coming and going
among the men at the back of the hall, but Grant had been aware of
it only as an obbligato, until his arm was pressed and a voice said
in his ear: 'Could you be doing with a wee drop yourself, perhaps?'
and he realised that Island hospitality was offering him a share of
the scarcest commodity known to Island economy. Since it would have
been ungracious to refuse, he thanked his benefactor and followed
him out into the darkness. Against the lee wall of the
meeting-place leaned a representative minority of the male
population of Cladda in a contented silence. A flat two-gill bottle
was thrust into his hands. '<i>Slainte!</i>' he said, and took a
swig of it. A hand, guided by an eye more acclimatised to the dark
than his own, took the bottle back from him and a voice wished him
health in return. Then he followed his unknown friend back to the
lighted hall. Presently he saw Mr Todd being surreptitiously tapped
on the arm, and Mr Todd too went out into the darkness to be
sustained with something out of the bottle. It could happen nowhere
else, Grant thought. Unless in the States during prohibition. Not
much wonder that the Scots were silly and arch and coy about
whisky. (Except of course in Strathspey, where the stuff was made.
In Strathspey they put the bottle in the middle of the table, as
matter-of-factly as an Englishman would, if a little more proudly.)
Not much wonder that they behaved as if there was something very
dashing, not to say, daring, about having a drink of whisky. The
surprising, the knowing leer with which the ordinary Scot referred
to his national drink could only come from inherited knowledge of
prohibition: either the Kirk's or the Law's.</p>

<p>Warmed by his mouthful out of the flat bottle, he listened
tolerantly to Duncan Tavish being confident and long-winded in
Gaelic. He was introducing a guest who had come a long way to speak
to them. A guest who needed no introduction from him or from
anyone; whose own achievements spoke for themselves. (Nevertheless
Duncan spoke for them at length.) Grant did not catch the Gaelic
name of the guest, but he was aware that the renegades from outside
came pressing in at the sound of the cheering that greeted Mr
Tavish's peroration. Either the speaker was the real interest of
the evening or the whisky had given out.</p>

<p>He watched in idle curiosity the small figure detach itself from
the front row, clamber up on to the platform with the aid of the
piano, and stride into the middle of it.</p>

<p>It was Wee Archie.</p>

<p>Wee Archie looked even odder in Cladda than he had on Clune
moor; his stature more inadequate, his cockatoo brightness more
startling. The kilt was not the dress of the islands, and among all
these sober-coloured males in their thick, stiff clothes he looked
more than ever 'a souvenir doll'. Without his dashing bonnet with
its sprouting greenery he looked somehow undressed, like a
policeman without his helmet. His hair was very scanty, and was
drawn in thin strings across the top of his head to hide the bare
patch. He was like something out of a not very expensive Christmas
stocking.</p>

<p>However, there was no qualification to the welcome he was given.
Apart from the Royal Family, in person and <i>in toto</i>, Grant
could think of no one who could be guaranteed the equivalent of the
reception that Wee Archie was now being accorded. Even discounting
the effect of libations at the lee end, it was surprising. And the
silence that succeeded it when he began to talk was flattering.
Grant wished that he could see the faces. He remembered that Bella
from Lewis had had no use for his back-door proselytising; and what
Pat Rankin thought of him would not go through the post. But what
did these Islanders, cut off from the world and from the variety
that alone could teach a man to judge between this and that, what
did these Islanders think of him? Here was the material of his
dreams; innocent, acquisitive, self-conscious, egotistical. They
could not be subverted to another rule, the Islanders, because no
one had ever ruled them in any real sense. A Government was there,
as far as the Islanders were concerned, to be milked of benefits
and diddled out of its dues. But their separateness could be played
upon to alienate sympathy; their opportunism could be sharpened by
dangled benefits. In Cladda, Wee Archie was not the embarrassing
nonentity he had been at Lochan Dhu; in Cladda he was a possible
power. Cladda and all its attendant islands represented, in the
ultimate reckoning, submarine bases, smuggling points, stepping-off
places, watch-towers, airfields, patrol bases. What did the
Islanders think of Gilleasbuig Mac-a'-Bruithainn and his creed? He
wished that he could see the faces.</p>

<p>For half an hour Wee Archie spoke to them in his thin, angry
voice, with passion and without pause, and they listened without a
sound. And then Grant, casting a glance at the rows of seats in
front of him, thought that they looked less full than they had been
at the beginning of the evening. This was so unlikely that he took
his attention from Archie to consider the matter. He caught a
stealthy movement along the trough between Row 5 and Row 6 and
followed it with his eye until it reached the end of the row. There
it stood upright and materialised into the person of Katie-Ann.
With no fuss at all Katie-Ann, still with demure eyes fixed on the
speaker, faded backwards through the standing rows of males and
disappeared into the outer air.</p>

<p>Grant watched a little longer and found that this melting
process was continuous, both among the seated audience and among
the males standing round the walls. The audience was melting away
invisibly under Archie's very nose. This was so unusual&mdash;a
country audience will always wait to the end however boring an
entertainment&mdash;that Grant turned to Mr Todd and whispered:
'Why are they leaving?'</p>

<p>'They're going to watch the ballet.'</p>

<p>'The <i>ballet</i>?'</p>

<p>'Television. It's their great treat. Everything else they see on
television is just a version of something they've seen already.
Plays, and singing, and what not. But ballet is something they've
never seen before. They wouldn't miss ballet for anything or
anyone....What is so amusing about that?'</p>

<p>But Grant was not amused by Cladda's passion for ballet. He was
enjoying Archie's so-unlikely disarming. Poor Archie. Poor wee
deluded Archie. He had been overthrown by an arabesque, foiled by
an <i>entrechat</i>, defeated by a <i>plié</i>. It was
fantastically appropriate.</p>

<p>'Have they gone for good?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no, they'll be back for the dance.'</p>

<p>And back they were, in force. Every soul on the island was at
the dance; the ancients sitting round, and the active taking the
roof off with their wild yelling. It was less agile dancing than
Grant was used to on the mainland, less graceful; for Highland
dancing one needed the kilt, and the soft thonged shoes that made
no sound on the floor and let a man dance like a flame among the
sword points. The Island dancing had much of the Irish in it; much
of the sad Irish immobility that left the dancing a matter of
foot-work only, and not an uprush of joy that filled a man to the
last finger-tip of his up-flung hands. But if the dancing itself
lacked art and gaiety there was a fine wholesale merriment in its
stamping performance. There was room, with some squeezing, for
three eightsomes, and sooner or later everyone, including the
Swedes and the Hollanders, were dragged into this orgy of exercise.
A fiddle and a piano gave out the lovely floating rhythm (for that
one needed a regimental band, thought Grant as he swung Katie-Ann
into the arms of a delighted Swede, one needed that double
drum-beat and pause; it might not be purist but it certainly was
effective) and the hands of those at rest beat time. The wind
howled along the skylights on the roof, the dancers yelled, the
fiddle sawed, and the piano thumped, and a wonderful time was had
by all.</p>

<p>Including Alan Grant.</p>

<p>He swayed home through the stinging lash of hail wielded by a
pitiless south-wester, and dropped into bed drunk with exercise and
fresh air. It had been a delightful day.</p>

<p>It had also been a profitable one. He would have something to
tell Ted Hanna when he got back to town. He knew now who Archie
Brown's 'ravens' were.</p>

<p>Tonight he did not look at the closed window with misgiving. Nor
tonight did he forget it altogether. He looked at the closed window
and was glad of it. He had absorbed the Island point of view that a
window is there to keep out the weather.</p>

<p>He burrowed into his cotton-quilt nest, out of the wind and the
weather, and fell into dreamless depths of sleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">WEE ARCHIE departed next morning when 'the boat'
called, on his way to spread light throughout all the other dark
places of the archipelago. He had been staying with the Reverend Mr
MacKay, it transpired; and Grant wondered what that blameless padre
to a Highland regiment would think if he knew what he had been
sheltering under his roof. Or was the Reverend Mr MacKay, too, sick
of Archie Brown's disease?</p>

<p>On the whole Grant thought not.</p>

<p>Mr MacKay had all the authority that mortal man could crave; he
had a satisfaction for his vanity every Sunday morning; he had seen
the world, and life and death, and men's souls in relation to both,
and he was not likely to hanker after esoteric glories. He had
merely been host to a Scottish celebrity. For in a small country
like Scotland Archie ranked as a celebrity, and Mr MacKay was no
doubt greatly pleased to entertain him.</p>

<p>So Grant had the island to himself, and for five days in the
company of the whooping wind he quartered his bleak kingdom. It was
rather like walking with a bad-mannered dog; a dog that rushes past
you on narrow paths, leaps on you in ecstasy so that you are nearly
knocked over, and drags you from the direction in which you want to
go. He spent his evenings with his legs stretched out to the office
fire listening to Mr Todd's tales of pub-owning in the Lowlands. He
ate enormously. He put on weight visibly. He slept as soon as his
head touched the pillow and woke only when it was morning. And by
the end of the fifth day he was ready to face a hundred air
journeys rather than spend another twelve hours in the place.</p>

<p>So on the sixth morning he stood on the great flat of white sand
waiting for the little plane to pick him up on its way back from
Stornoway. And the small misgiving somewhere in the depths of him
was nothing like the pervading apprehension with which he had
expected to be filled at this moment. Mr Todd stood with him, and
beside them on the sand was his small case. Up on the grass, where
the road ended, was the Cladda Hotel car, the only one on the
island and the only one of its class anywhere in the world. They
stood there, four tiny dark objects in the shining waste, watching
the small bird-like thing in the sky drop down to them.</p>

<p>This, Grant thought, was as near to the original idea of flight
as one was likely to get nowadays. As someone had pointed out, when
man first dreamed of flying he had seen himself rising on his own
silver wings into the blue empyrean, but it hadn't turned out at
all like that. First he was trundled to a field, then he was shut
in a box, then he was terrified, then he was sick, then he was in
Paris. Being picked up from the sands on the sea-ward fringe of the
world by a casual-alighting bird was as near as one would ever come
to the free soaring of man's original vision.</p>

<p>The great bird idled up to them along the sand, and for a moment
Grant panicked. It was, when all was said, a box. A tight-closed
trap of a thing. But the casualness of everything loosened his
rigid muscles almost as soon as they had stiffened. In the clinical
order of an airport, shepherded and compelled, panic might have
conquered. But here, on the open sand, with the pilot draped about
the top step as he gossiped with Mr Todd, and the crying of gulls
and the smell of the sea, it was a thing one could take or leave.
There was no compulsion to be afraid of.</p>

<p>So when the moment came he put his foot over the last step with
nothing more than a slight heart-quickening. And before he could
analyse his reaction to that closing door a nearer interest caught
his mind. In front of him, on the other side of the gangway, was
Wee Archie.</p>

<p>Wee Archie looked as if he had just got out of bed, and as if he
had done that getting-out in some hurry. His dishevelled splendour
looked more than ever as if they were someone's else's clothes
altogether. He looked like a discarded armature with some studio
props flung on top of it. He greeted Grant like an old friend,
condescended to him about his ignorance of the Islands, recommended
Gaelic to him as a language it would pay him to study, and went
back to sleep. Grant sat and looked at him.</p>

<p>The little bastard, he thought. The vain, worthless little
bastard.</p>

<p>Archie's mouth had fallen open, and the strands of black hair no
longer covered the thin patch. The knees above the fat brilliant
socks were more like anatomical specimens than any mechanism
designed for the propulsion of a living being. They weren't knees;
they were 'the knee joint'. The articulation of the fibula was
particularly interesting.</p>

<p>The vain vicious little bastard. He had had a profession that
would give him his bread and butter, a profession that would have
given him a certain standing, a profession that would have brought
him spiritual reward. But that had not satisfied his egotistical
soul. He had needed the limelight. And as long as he could strut in
the light he did not care who paid for the illumination.</p>

<p>Grant was still considering the fundamental part that vanity
played in the make-up of the criminal when a geometrical pattern
opened below him like a Japanese flower in water. He took his
thoughts from psychological matters in order to consider this
Euclidean phenomenon in a world of nature and found that they were
circling the mainland airport. He had flown back from Cladda and
had hardly been aware of it.</p>

<p>He climbed down on to the tarmac and wondered what would happen
if he did a war-dance of joy there and then. He wanted to go
whooping and prancing round the aerodrome like a child on his first
hobby-horse. Instead he went to the telephone booths and asked
Tommy if he could pick him up at the Caledonian in Scoone in about
two hours. Tommy could and would.</p>

<p>The food at the airport restaurant tasted like Lucas-Carton, the
Tour d'Argent, and La Crémaillière all rolled into one. The man at
the next table was complaining bitterly about it. But he of course
had not just been reborn after five months of hell and seven days
of Katie-Ann.</p>

<p>Tommy's round, kind face in the lounge of the Caledonian looked
rounder and kinder than even Tommy's face had ever looked
before.</p>

<p>There was no wind.</p>

<p>No wind at all.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful world.</p>

<p>What a frightful anticlimax it would be, he thought, if when he
got into the car with Tommy the old horror overcame him. Perhaps
the thing was just waiting there for him, licking its lips with
anticipation.</p>

<p>But there was nothing in the car. Just himself and Tommy and the
good relaxed atmosphere of their habitual intercourse. They drove
away into the country, an appreciably greener country than it had
been ten days ago, and the evening sun came out and sent long
golden fingers of light across the calm fields.</p>

<p>'How did the Moymore ceremony come off?' he asked. 'The bouquet
presentation.'</p>

<p>'Oh, heavens: that!' Tommy said, making motions as of a man
mopping his forehead.</p>

<p>'Didn't he present it?'</p>

<p>'If letting her have it is presenting it, I suppose technically
he presented it. He handed it over with a speech he had thought up
himself.'</p>

<p>'What kind of speech?'</p>

<p>'I think he had been rehearsing a sort of get-out for himself
ever since we talked him into it by making Zoë Kentallen a rebel of
some kind. Which was Laura's idea, by the way, not mine. Well, when
she stooped to take the great bush of carnations from
him&mdash;she's very tall&mdash;he held them out of her reach for a
moment and said firmly: "I'm only giving you this, mind, because
you're a fellow-revolutionary." She took it without batting an
eyelid. She said: "Yes, of course. How very kind of you," although
she hadn't an idea what he was talking about. She bowled him over,
by the way.'</p>

<p>'How?'</p>

<p>'In the good old female way. Pat is in the throes of his first
infatuation.'</p>

<p>Grant looked forward to seeing this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Clune lay very peaceful in its green hollow, and Grant looked at
it as one coming home victorious from battle. Last time he had
driven up that sandy road he had been a slave; now he was a free
man. He had gone out to look for B Seven and had found himself.</p>

<p>Laura came out to meet him at the doorstep and said: 'Alan, have
you taken to a tipster's business on the side?'</p>

<p>'No. Why?'</p>

<p>'Or one of those Lonely Hearts columns, or something?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Because Mrs Mair says there is a whole sackful of mail waiting
for you at the post-office.'</p>

<p>'Oh. How did Mrs Mair know that the letters were for me?'</p>

<p>'She said you were the only A. Grant in the district. I take it
you haven't advertised for a wife?'</p>

<p>'No, just for a bit of information,' he said, going with her
into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>The room in the early dusk was full of firelight and wavering
shadows. He thought it was empty until he noticed that someone was
sitting in the big wing-chair by the hearth. A woman; so long and
slender that she seemed as fluid as the shadows and he had to look
a second time to be sure that she was not in truth a shadow.</p>

<p>'Lady Kentallen,' said Laura's voice behind him, in an
introducing tone. 'Zoë has come back to Clune for a few days'
fishing.'</p>

<p>The woman leant forward to shake hands with him and he saw that
she was a girl.</p>

<p>'Mr Grant,' she said, greeting him. 'Laura says that you like to
be called Mr.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Yes, I do. "Inspector" has a grim sound in private
life.'</p>

<p>'And a little unreal, too,' she said in her gentle voice. 'Like
something out of a detective story.'</p>

<p>'Yes; people expect you to say: "Where were you on the evening
of the umpteenth inst?"' How could this virginal creature be the
mother of three sons, one of them nearly old enough to leave
school? 'Have you been having any luck on the river?'</p>

<p>'I had a nice grilse this morning. You are going to have it for
supper.'</p>

<p>She had the kind of beauty that allows a woman to part her hair
in the middle and wear it smooth to her head. A dark, small head on
a long graceful neck.</p>

<p>He remembered suddenly about the newly decorated bedroom. So the
fresh paint had been for Zoë Kentallen, and not for Laura's latest
candidate for his interest. That was an enormous relief. It had
been bad enough to have Laura's selections put under his nose, but
to have had the latest one actually under the same roof would have
been, to put it mildly, tiresome.</p>

<p>'The Oban train must have been in time for once,' Laura said,
remarking on his early arrival.</p>

<p>'Oh, he flew back,' Tommy said, throwing another log on the
fire. He said it casually, unaware that the fact had any
importance.</p>

<p>Grant looked over at Laura and saw her face light with
happiness. She turned her head to find him among the shadows and
saw that he was looking at her, and smiled. Had it mattered so much
to her then? Dear Lalla. Dear kind understanding Lalla.</p>

<p>They began to talk about the Islands. Tommy had a fine tale of a
man whose hat blew off as he was boarding a boat in Barra and who
found it waiting for him on the pier at Mallaig. Laura was funny
about the impossibility of carrying on a conversation in a language
that has no words for anything less than two hundred years old and
supplied an imaginary account of a road accident. ('Blah-blah
bicycle blah-blah S-bend blah-blah brakes blah-blah traction-engine
blah-blah ambulance blah-blah stretcher blah-blah anaesthetic
blah-blah private ward blah-blah temperature-chart blah-blah
chrysanthemums freezias ranunculus narcissus carnations....) Zoë
had stayed in the Islands as a child and was very knowledgeable
about poaching salmon; an art she had been taught by local talent
under the very nose of her host's game-keeper.</p>

<p>Grant was pleased to find that the family atmosphere of Clune
had been in no way disturbed by the presence of this guest. She
seemed unaware of her beauty, and unexpectant of attention. He was
not surprised that Pat had been 'bowled over'.</p>

<p>It was only when his bedroom door finally closed on him and he
was alone that his mind went to that waiting sack of letters in the
post-office at Moymore. A sack of them! Well, that was not
unbearably surprising, after all. A life in the C.I.D. conditioned
one to the existence of the letter-writer. There were people whose
only interest in life was writing letters. To the newspapers, to
authors, to strangers, to City Councils, to the police. It did not
much matter to whom; the satisfaction of writing seemed to be all.
Seven-eighths of that pile of letters would be the product of those
whose hobby was writing letters.</p>

<p>But there was still the odd eighth.</p>

<p>What would the odd eighth have to say?</p>

<p>In the morning he watched the guest getting her tackle ready for
the river and wished that he was going with her, but still more he
wanted to go to the post-office at Moymore. She set off without
fuss, self-sufficient and unobtrusive, and Grant, watching her walk
down the path, thought that she was more like an adolescent boy
than a prospective dowager. She was wearing very elegant trousers
and a disreputable old lumber jacket, and he remarked to Tommy that
she was one of the few women who looked really well in
trousers.</p>

<p>'She's the only woman in the <i>world</i>,' Tommy said, 'who
looks beautiful in waders.'</p>

<p>So Grant went away to interview Mrs Mair at Moymore. Mrs Mair
hoped that he had a secretary and presented him with a paper-knife.
It was a thin silver affair, very tarnished, with a thistle head
made of amethyst. When he pointed out that the thing was
hall-marked and of some value nowadays and that he could not accept
expensive presents from strange women, she said:</p>

<p>'Mr Grant, that thing has been in my shop for twenty-five years.
It was made for the souvenir trade in the days when people could
read. Now they just look and listen. You're the first person I've
met in a quarter of a century that <i>needed</i> a paper-knife.
Indeed, by the time you've slit open all the letters in that sack,
you'll need more than a paper-knife, I'm thinking. Anyway it's the
first and last time I'll ever have a sack of mail addressed to one
person in this office and I'd like to mark the occasion. So you
take the wee knife!'</p>

<p>He took it gratefully, hoisted the sack into the car, and went
back to Clune.</p>

<p>'The bag's post-office property,' she said after him, 'so see
you bring it back!'</p>

<p>He took the sack to his own room, polished the little knife
until it shone with a pleased and grateful air as if glad to be
noticed after all those years, emptied the bag on to the floor, and
slipped the knife into the first letter to come to hand. The first
letter asked him how he dared expose to the public gaze the words
the writer had written, with such pain and heart-searching, in the
spring of 1911, under the orders of her spirit guide Azul. It was
like being publicly exhibited without clothes, to see her own
precious lines so wantonly laid bare.</p>

<p>Thirteen other correspondents claimed to have written the lines
(without spirit guidance) and asked what was in it for them. Five
sent the completed poem&mdash;five different poems&mdash;and
claimed that they were the author of it. Three accused him of
blasphemy, and seven said he was plagiarising from Revelations. One
said: 'Thank you very much for an evening's entertainment, old boy,
and how is the fishing on the Turlie this year?' One directed him
to the Apocrypha, one to the Arabian Nights, one to Rider Haggard,
one to Theosophy, one to Grand Canyon, and five to various parts of
Central and South America. Nine sent him cures for alcoholism, and
twenty-two sent him circulars about esoteric cults. Two suggested
subscriptions to poetry magazines, and one offered to teach him to
write salable verse. One said: 'If you are the A. Grant I sat
through the monsoon with at Bishenpur this is my present address.'
One said: 'If you are the A. Grant I spent the night with in a rest
hotel in Amalfi this is just to say hullo, and I wish my husband
was as good.' One sent him particulars of a Clan Grant association.
Nine were obscene. Three were illegible.</p>

<p>There were one hundred and seventeen letters.</p>

<p>The one that gave him most pleasure was one that read: 'I've
fathomed your code, you bloody traitor, and I shall report you to
the Special Branch.'</p>

<p>Not one of them was of any help at all.</p>

<p>Oh, well. He had not really hoped. It had been a shot in the
dark.</p>

<p>He had at least had some amusement out of it. Now he could
settle down and fish until the end of his sick-leave. He wondered
how long Zoë Kentallen was staying.</p>

<p>The guest had taken sandwiches with her and did not appear for
lunch, but in the afternoon Grant took his rod and followed her
down to the river. She had probably already fished the whole of the
Clune water, but perhaps she did not know it as well as he did. She
might be glad of some unobtrusive advice. Not, of course, that he
was going down to the river for the sole purpose of talking to her.
He was going to fish. But he would have to find out first which
part of the water she herself was fishing. And he could hardly,
having found her, pass with a casual wave of the hand.</p>

<p>He did not pass at all, of course. He sat on the bank watching
her drop a Green Highlander above the big one that she had been
pursuing with various lures for the last hour. 'He just thumbs his
nose at me,' she said. 'It has become a personal affair between
us.' She used her rod with the ease of someone who has fished since
she was a child; almost absent-mindedly, as Laura did. It was very
satisfying to watch.</p>

<p>He gaffed the fish for her an hour later, and they sat together
on the grass and ate the rest of her sandwiches. She asked about
his work, not as if it was a sensational matter, but as she might
inquire about it if he had been an architect or an engine-driver;
and told him about her three boys and what they were going to be.
Her simplicity was indestructible, and her unselfconsciousness
child-like in its completeness.</p>

<p>'Nigel will be sick when he hears that I have been fishing the
Turlie,' she said. She said it as a girl might say it of a
schoolboy brother; and he deduced that this described with fair
accuracy the relationship between herself and her sons.</p>

<p>There were hours yet of daylight, but neither of them made any
move to go back to the river. They sat there looking down on the
brown water and talked. Grant, out of his wide acquaintance, tried
to think of an equivalent to her, and failed. None of the beautiful
women he had seen in his time had had her fairy-princess quality;
her air of timeless youth. A stray from Tir nan Og, he thought. It
was surprising that she should, soberly considered, be the same age
as Laura.</p>

<p>'Did you know Laura well at school?'</p>

<p>'Not bosom-friend well. I was terribly in awe of her, you
see.'</p>

<p>'In awe? Of Laura?'</p>

<p>'Yes. She was very clever, you know, and good at everything, and
I never could add two and two.'</p>

<p>Since part of his delight in her was the contrast between her
Hans Andersen-illustration quality and her practicality, he deduced
that this was an exaggeration. But it was probably true that she
had no&mdash;no branches to her, so to speak. No multitude of
leaves to breathe the air of the world. The climate of her mind was
uncritical. Her utterance had none of Laura's glancing comment;
none of Laura's swift interest and dissection.</p>

<p>'We are very lucky, you and Laura and I, to have known the
Highlands when we were children,' she said, when they were talking
of early fishing experiences. 'That is what I should wish most for
a child. To have a beautiful calf-country. When David&mdash;my
husband&mdash;was killed they wanted me to sell Kentallen. We had
never had much money, and the Death Duties took the margin that
made the place workable. But I wanted to hang on to it at least
until Nigel and Timmy and Charles are grown-up. They will hate
losing it, but at least they will have had the years that matter in
a beautiful country.'</p>

<p>He looked at her, putting her tackle neatly away in its box with
the sober care of a tidy child, and thought that the solution of
her problem was surely remarriage. The West End that he knew so
well was lousy with sleek men in shiny cars who could keep
Kentallen with no more effort than they would keep a Japanese
garden in one of the rooms that they called lounges. The difficulty
was, he supposed, that in Zoë Kentallen's world money was neither
an introduction nor an absolution.</p>

<p>The spring sunlight faded. The skies grew luminous. The hills
went far away and lay down, as Laura had once said as a child;
describing in eight easy words the whole look and atmosphere of an
evening of settled weather when tomorrow is going to be a wonderful
day.</p>

<p>'We ought to be getting back,' Zoë said.</p>

<p>As he picked up their fishing things from the bank he thought
that there had been more magic in this one afternoon on the Turlie
than in all the much advertised Islands of the West.</p>

<p>'You love your work, don't you?' she said as they walked up the
hill to Clune. 'Laura told me that you could have retired years ago
if you had wanted to.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, a little surprised. 'I suppose that I could have
retired. My mother's sister left me a legacy. She married a man who
did well in Australia and she had no children.'</p>

<p>'What would you do if you retired?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. I have never even considered it.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">BUT that night, going to sleep, he did consider
it. Not as a prospect, but with speculation. What would it be like
to retire? To retire while he was still young enough to begin
something else? If he began something else what would it be? A
sheep-farm like Tommy's? That would be a good life. But could he
make a success of an entirely country existence? He doubted it. And
if not, then what else could he do?</p>

<p>He played with this nice new toy until he fell asleep and he
took it to the river with him next morning. One of the really
charming facets of the game was the thought of Bryce's face when he
read his resignation. Bryce would not merely be short of staff for
a week or two; he would find himself deprived for good and all of
his most valued subordinate. It was a delicious thought.</p>

<p>He fished his favourite pool, below the swing bridge, and
conducted delightful conversations with Bryce. Because of course
there would be a conversation. He would give himself the ineffable
delight of laying that written resignation on the desk in front of
Bryce's nose; laying it there himself, in person. Then there would
be some really satisfying chat, and he would walk out into the
street a free man.</p>

<p>Free to do what?</p>

<p>To be himself, at the beck and call of nobody.</p>

<p>To do things he had always wanted to do and had had no time for.
To mess about in small boats, for instance.</p>

<p>To get married, perhaps.</p>

<p>Yes, to get married. With leisure there would be time to share
his life. Time to love and be loved.</p>

<p>This lasted him very happily for another hour.</p>

<p>About noon he became aware that he was not alone. He looked up
and saw that a man was standing on the bridge watching him. He was
standing only a few yards from the bank, and since the bridge was
motionless he must have been there for some time. The bridge was
the usual trough of wire floored with wooden slats, a structure so
light that even the wind was capable of moving it. He was grateful
to the stranger for not walking into the middle of the thing and
swaying about there so that he distracted every fish in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>He nodded to the man by way of expressing his approval.</p>

<p>'Your name Grant?' asked the man.</p>

<p>After the circumlocutions of a people so devious-minded that
they had no word for No, it was pleasant to be asked a straight
question in simple English.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, and wondered a little. The man sounded as if he
might be an American.</p>

<p>'You the guy who put that advertisement in the paper?'</p>

<p>There was no doubt about the nationality this time.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>The man tipped his hat further back on his head and said in a
resigned way: 'Oh, well. I'm crazy too, I guess, or I wouldn't be
here.'</p>

<p>Grant began to reel in.</p>

<p>'Won't you come down, Mr&mdash;?'</p>

<p>The man moved off the bridge and came down the bank to him.</p>

<p>He was youngish, well-dressed, and pleasant-looking.</p>

<p>'My name is Cullen,' he said. 'Tad Cullen. I'm a flyer. I fly
freight for OCAL. You know: Oriental Commercial Airlines Ltd.'</p>

<p>It was said that all you needed to fly for OCAL was a
certificate and no sign of leprosy. But that was an exaggeration.
Indeed, it was a perversion. You had to be good to fly for OCAL. In
the big shiny passenger lines, if you made a mistake you were on
the carpet. In OCAL, if you made a mistake you were out on your
ear. OCAL had an unlimited supply of personnel to draw upon. OCAL
cared nothing for your grammar, your colour, your antecedents, your
manners, your nationality, or your looks, as long as you could fly.
You had to be able to fly. Grant looked at Mr Cullen with a double
interest.</p>

<p>'Look, Mr Grant, I know that that thing, those words in the
paper, I know they were just some kind of quotation that you wanted
identified, or something like that. And of course I can't identify
them. I was never any good at books. I haven't come here to be any
use to you. Quite the opposite, I guess. But I've been very
worried, and I thought even a long shot like this might be worth
trying. You see, Bill used words like that one night when he was a
bit high&mdash;Bill's my buddy&mdash;and I thought, maybe, it might
be a place. I mean the description might be a place. Even if it is
a quotation. I'm afraid I'm not making myself very clear.'</p>

<p>Grant smiled a little and said No, not so far, but suppose they
both sat down and straightened it out. 'Am I to understand that you
have come here looking for me?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I actually came last night. But the post-office place was
shut, so I got a bed at the inn. Moymore, they call it. And then I
went to the post-office this morning and asked them where I could
find the A. Grant who had a lot of letters. I was sure you'd have
had a lot, you see, after that advertisement. And they said Oh,
yes, if it was Mr Grant I wanted I would find him on the river
somewhere. Well, I came down to look and the only other person on
the river was a lady, so I guessed you must be it. You see it
wasn't any good writing to you because I really hadn't anything
that seemed worth putting on paper. I mean, it was just a daffy
kind of hope. And you mightn't have bothered answering it
anyway&mdash;when it had nothing to do with you, I mean.' He paused
a moment, and added in a half-hopeful half-hoping-for-nothing tone:
'It isn't a night-club, is it?'</p>

<p>'What isn't?' Grant asked, surprised.</p>

<p>'That place with talking beasts at the door. And the odd
scenery. It sounded like a fun-fair place. You know: the kind of
place where you go in a boat through tunnels in the dark and see
ridiculous and frightening things unexpectedly. But Bill wouldn't
be interested in a place like that. So I thought of a night-club.
You know: one of those got up with oddities to impress the
customers. That would be much more Bill's mixture. Especially in
Paris. And it was in Paris that I was to meet him.'</p>

<p>For the first time a gleam of light appeared.</p>

<p>'You mean that you were due to meet this Bill? And he didn't
keep the appointment?'</p>

<p>'He didn't show up at all. And that's very unlike Bill. If Bill
says he'll do a thing, or be in a place, or remember a thing,
believe you me he'll deliver. That's why I'm so worried. And not a
word of explanation. Not a message left at the hotel or anything.
Of course they may have forgotten to put down the message, hotels
being what they are. But even if they did forget, there would have
been some follow-up. I mean, when I didn't react, Bill would have
telephoned again saying: What are you up to, you old so-and-so,
didn't you get my message? But there wasn't anything like that.
It's funny, isn't it, that he would book a room and then not turn
up to occupy it and not send a word in explanation?'</p>

<p>'Very strange indeed. Especially since you say your friend was a
dependable type. But why were you interested in my advertisement? I
mean: in connection with Bill? Bill&mdash;, what, by the way?'</p>

<p>'Bill Kenrick. He's a flyer like me. With OCAL. We've been
friends for a year or two now. The best friend I ever had, I don't
mind saying. Well, it was like this, Mr Grant. When he didn't turn
up, and no one seemed to know anything about him or to have heard
from him&mdash;and he had no people in England that I could write
to&mdash;I thought about what other ways there were of
communicating with people. Other than telephones and letters and
telegrams and what not. And so I thought of what you call the Agony
Column. You know: in the newspapers. So I got the Paris edition of
the <i>Clarion</i>&mdash;the files, I mean, at their Paris
office&mdash;and went through them, and there was nothing. And then
I tried <i>The Times</i>, and there was nothing there either. This
was after some time, of course, so I had to go back through the
files, but there was nothing. I was going to give it up because I
thought that that was all the English papers that had regular Paris
editions, but someone said why didn't I try the <i>Morning
News</i>. Well, I went to the <i>News</i>, and there didn't seem to
be anything from Bill, but there was this thing of yours that rang
a bell. If Bill hadn't been missing I don't suppose I would have
thought twice about it, but having heard Bill gabble something
along those lines made me notice it and be interested. Are you with
me, as Bill says?'</p>

<p>'Entirely. Go on. When was it that Bill talked about the odd
landscape?'</p>

<p>'He didn't talk about it at all. He just babbled one night when
we were all a little drunk. Bill doesn't drink, Mr Grant. I don't
want you to get the wrong idea. I mean: drink as a habit. A few of
the boys in our lot do, I admit, but they don't last long in OCAL.
They don't last long anyway. That's why OCAL heaves them out. They
don't mind them killing themselves, but it gets expensive in
crates. But now and then we have a night-out like other people. And
it was on one of those nights out that Bill got going. We were all
a little high so I don't remember anything in detail. I know we
were drinking toasts and we were running out of subjects by that
time. And we were taking it in turn to think up unlikely things to
toast. You know: like "The third daughter of the Lord Mayor of
Bagdad", or "June Kaye's left little toe". And Bill said: "To
Paradise!" and then gabbled a piece about talking beasts and
singing sands and what not.'</p>

<p>'Didn't anyone ask about this Paradise of his?'</p>

<p>'No! The next fellow was just waiting to get his word in. No one
was paying any attention to anything. They'd just think Bill's
toast pretty dull. I wouldn't have remembered it myself if I hadn't
come across the words in the paper when my mind was full of
Bill.'</p>

<p>'And he never mentioned it again? Never talked about anything
like that in his sober moments.'</p>

<p>'No. He isn't much of a talker at the best of times.'</p>

<p>'You think, perhaps, if he was greatly interested in something
he would keep it to himself?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, he does that, he does that. He's not close, you know;
just a bit cagey. In most ways he's the most open guy you could
imagine. Generous with his roll, and careless with his things, and
willing to do anything for anyone. But in the things that&mdash;in
personal things, if you know what I mean, he sort of shuts the door
on you.'</p>

<p>'Did he have a girl?'</p>

<p>'Not more than any of us can be said to have one. But that's a
very good sample of what I mean. When the rest of us are out for an
evening we take what's going. But Bill will go off by himself to
some other quarter of the town where he has picked something more
to his fancy.'</p>

<p>'What town?'</p>

<p>'Any town we happen to be in. Kuwait, Masquat, Quatif, Mukalla.
Anything from Aden to Karachi, if it comes to that. Most of us fly
scheduled routes, but some fly tramps. Take anything anywhere.'</p>

<p>'What did&mdash;does Bill fly?'</p>

<p>'He's flown all sorts. But lately he's been flying between the
Gulf and the South Coast.'</p>

<p>'Arabia, you mean.'</p>

<p>'Yes. It's a damned dreary route but Bill seemed to like it. Me,
I think he was too long on it. If you're too long on one route you
get stale.'</p>

<p>'Why do you think he was too long on it? Had he changed at
all?'</p>

<p>Mr Cullen hesitated. 'Not exactly. He was just the old Bill,
easy-going and nice. But he got so that he couldn't leave it behind
him.'</p>

<p>'Leave his work behind, you mean?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Most of us&mdash;all of us, in fact&mdash;drop work when
we turn the bus over to the ground staff. We don't remember it
until we say hullo to the mechanic in charge next morning. But Bill
got so that he would pore over maps of the route as if he had never
flown the hop before.'</p>

<p>'Why this interest in the route, do you think?'</p>

<p>'Well, I did think maybe he was figuring out a way to avoid the
bad weather areas. It did begin&mdash;the interest in maps, I
mean&mdash;one time when he came in very late after being blown out
of his way by one of those terrific hurricanes that come out of
nowhere in that country. We had nearly given him up that time.'</p>

<p>'Don't you fly above the weather?'</p>

<p>'On a long hop, of course. But when you're flying freight you
have to come down at the oddest places. So you're always more or
less at the mercy of the weather.'</p>

<p>'I see. And you think Bill changed after that experience?'</p>

<p>'Well, I think it left a mark on him. I was there when he came
in. In the plane, I mean. I was waiting for him, on the field. And
he seemed to me a bit&mdash;concussed, if you get me.'</p>

<p>'Suffering from shock.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Still back there, if you know what I mean. Not really
listening to what you said to him.'</p>

<p>'And after that he began to study maps. To plan his route, you
think.'</p>

<p>'Yes. From then on it was in the forefront of his mind instead
of being something that you drop with your working clothes. He even
began to come in late as a habit. As if he went out of his way to
look for an easier route.' He paused a moment, and then added in a
quick warning tone: 'Please understand, Mr Grant, I'm not saying
Bill has lost his nerve.'</p>

<p>'No, of course not.'</p>

<p>'Lost nerves don't take you that way at all, believe me.</p>

<p>'You get quite the opposite. You don't want to think of flying
at all. You get short in the temper, and you drink too much and too
early in the day, and you try to wangle short hops, and you go sick
when there's nothing wrong with you. There's no mystery about lost
nerve, Mr Grant. It announces itself like a name on a marquee.
There was nothing like that about Bill&mdash;and I don't think
there ever will be. It was just that he couldn't leave the thing
behind.'</p>

<p>'It became an obsession with him.'</p>

<p>'That's about it, I suppose.'</p>

<p>'Did he have other interests?'</p>

<p>'He read books,' Mr Cullen said, in an apologetic way; as one
confessing a peculiarity in a friend. 'Even in that, it
showed.'</p>

<p>'How: showed?'</p>

<p>'I mean, instead of the books being the usual story affairs
they'd as likely as not be about Arabia.'</p>

<p>'Yes?' Grant said, thoughtfully. Ever since this stranger had
first mentioned Arabia, Grant had been altogether 'with him'.
Arabia to all the world meant one thing: sand. And what was more,
he realised that when he had had the feeling, that morning in the
Scoone hotel, that 'singing sands' did actually exist somewhere, it
was with Arabia that he should have connected them. Somewhere in
Arabia there were in fact sands that were alleged to sing.</p>

<p>'So I was glad when he took his "leave" earlier than he meant
to,' Mr Cullen was saying. 'We had planned to go together, and
spend our leave in Paris. But he changed his mind and said he
wanted a week or two in London first. He's English, you know. So we
arranged to meet at the Hotel St Jacques in Paris. He was to meet
me there on the 4th of March.'</p>

<p>'<i>When?</i>' said Grant; and was suddenly still. Mind and body
still, like a pointer with the bird in sight; like a man with the
target in his sights.</p>

<p>'The 4th of March. Why?'</p>

<p>Singing sands were anyone's interest. Men who fly for OCAL were
two a penny. But the wide, vague, indefinite affair of Bill Kenrick
who was obsessed with Southern Arabia and did not turn up to his
appointments in Paris narrowed suddenly to one small focused point.
To a date.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March, when Bill Kenrick should have turned up in
Paris, the London mail had come into Scoone bearing the dead body
of a young man who was interested in singing sands. A young man
with reckless eyebrows. A young man who, on looks, would have made
a very likely flyer. Grant remembered that he had tried him, in
imagination, on the bridge of a small ship; a fast small ship, hell
in any kind of a sea. He had looked well there. But he would look
just as well at the controls of a plane.</p>

<p>'Why did Bill choose Paris?'</p>

<p>'Why does anyone choose Paris!'</p>

<p>'It wasn't because he was French?'</p>

<p>'Bill? No, Bill's English. Very English.'</p>

<p>'Did you ever see his passport?'</p>

<p>'Not that I can remember. Why?'</p>

<p>'You don't think that he might have been French by birth?'</p>

<p>It wouldn't work out, anyway. The Frenchman was called Martin.
Unless his English upbringing had made him want to adopt an English
name?</p>

<p>'You don't happen to have a photograph of your friend, do
you?'</p>

<p>But Mr Cullen's attention was on something else. Grant turned to
look, and found that Zoë was approaching them along the river bank.
He looked at his watch.</p>

<p>'Hell!' he said. 'And I promised to have the stove going!' He
turned to his bag and fished the primus from it.</p>

<p>'Your wife?' asked Mr Cullen, with that refreshing frankness. In
the Islands it would have taken five minutes conversation to have
elicited that information from him.</p>

<p>'No. That's Lady Kentallen.'</p>

<p>'Lady? A title?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Grant said, busy with the stove. 'She is Viscountess
Kentallen.'</p>

<p>Mr Cullen considered this in silence for a little.</p>

<p>'I supposed that's a sort of marked-down Countess.'</p>

<p>'No. On the contrary. A very superior kind. Practically a
Marchioness. Look, Mr Cullen, let's postpone this matter of your
friend for a little. It's a matter that interests me more than I
can say, but&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, of course, I'll go. When can I talk to you again about
it?'</p>

<p>'Of course you will not go! You'll stay and have some food with
us.'</p>

<p>'You mean you want me to meet this Marchioness,
this&mdash;whatyoumaycallit, Viscountess?'</p>

<p>'Why not? She is a very nice person to meet. One of the nicest
persons I know.'</p>

<p>'Yes?' Mr Cullen looked with interest at the approaching Zoë.
'She's certainly very nice to look at. I didn't know they came like
that. Somehow I imagined all aristocrats had beaky noses.'</p>

<p>'Specially provided for looking down, I take it.'</p>

<p>'Something like that.'</p>

<p>'I don't know how far back in English history one would have to
go to find an aristocratic nose that was looked down. I doubt if
you'd find one at all. The only place to find a looked-down nose is
in the suburbs. In what is known as lower-middle-class
circles.'</p>

<p>Mr Cullen looked puzzled. 'But the aristocrats keep themselves
to themselves and look down on the rest, don't they?'</p>

<p>'It has never been possible in England for any class to keep
themselves to themselves, as you call it. They have been
intermarrying at all levels for two thousand years. There never
have been separate and distinct classes&mdash;or an aristocratic
class at all in the sense that you mean it.'</p>

<p>'I suppose nowadays things are even-ing up,' Mr Cullen
suggested, faintly unbelieving.</p>

<p>'Oh, no. It has always been a fluid thing. Even our Royalty.
Elizabeth the First was the grand-daughter of a Lord Mayor. And
you'll find that Royalty's personal friends have no titles at all:
I mean the people who are on calling-terms at Buckingham Palace.
Whereas the bold bad baron who sits next you in an expensive
restaurant probably started life as a platelayer on the railway.
There is no keeping oneself to oneself in England, as far as class
goes. It can't be done. It can only be done by Mrs Jones who sniffs
at her neighbour Mrs Smith because Mr Jones makes two pounds a week
more than Mr Smith.'</p>

<p>He turned from the puzzled American to greet Zoë. 'I'm truly
sorry about the stove. I'm afraid I got it going too late to be
ready. We were having a very interesting conversation. This is Mr
Cullen, who flies freight for Oriental Commercial Airlines.'</p>

<p>Zoë shook hands, and asked him what kind of plane he flew.</p>

<p>From the tone of his voice when he told her Grant deduced that
Mr Cullen thought that Zoë was merely taking a condescending
interest. Condescension was what he would expect from an
'aristocrat'.</p>

<p>'They're very heavy in hand, aren't they?' Zoë remarked
sympathetically. 'My brother used to fly one when he was on the
Australia run. He was always cursing it.' She began to open the
packets of food. 'But now that he works in an office in Sydney he
has a little runabout of his own. A Beamish Eight. A lovely thing.
I used to fly it when he first bought it; before he took it to
Australia. David&mdash;my husband&mdash;and I used to dream of
having one too, but we could never afford it.'</p>

<p>'But a Beamish Eight costs only four hundred,' Mr Cullen
blurted.</p>

<p>Zoë licked her fingers, sticky from a leaking apple tart, and
said: 'Yes, I know, but we never had four hundred to spare.'</p>

<p>Mr Cullen, feeling himself being washed out to sea, sought some
terra firma.</p>

<p>'I oughtn't to be eating your food this way,' he said. 'They'll
have plenty for me back at the hotel. I really ought to go
back.'</p>

<p>'Oh, don't go,' Zoë said with a simplicity so genuine that it
penetrated even Mr Cullen's defences. 'There is enough for a
platoon.'</p>

<p>So to Grant's pleasure in more ways than one, Mr Cullen stayed.
And Zoë, unaware that she was providing the United States with a
revised view of the genus English Aristocrat, ate like a hungry
schoolboy and talked in her gentle voice to the stranger as if she
had known him all her life. By the apple tart stage, Mr Cullen had
ceased to be on his guard. By the time that they were handing round
the chocolates that Laura had included he had surrendered
unconditionally.</p>

<p>They sat together in the spring sunshine, full-fed and content.
Zoë lying back against the grassy bank with her feet crossed and
her hands behind her head, her eyes closed against the sun. Grant
with his mind busy with B Seven, and the material that Tad Cullen
had brought him. Mr Cullen himself perched on a rock looking down
the river to the green civilised strath where the moors ended and
the fields began.</p>

<p>'It's a fine little country, this,' he said. 'I like it. If you
ever decide to fight for your freedom, count me in.'</p>

<p>'Freedom?' said Zoë, opening her eyes. 'Freedom from whom or
what?'</p>

<p>'From England, of course.'</p>

<p>Zoë looked helpless, but Grant began to laugh. 'I think you must
have been talking to a little black man in a kilt,' he said.</p>

<p>'He had a kilt, yes, but he wasn't coloured,' Mr Cullen
said.</p>

<p>'No, I meant black-haired. You've been talking to Archie
Brown.'</p>

<p>'Who is Archie Brown?' asked Zoë.</p>

<p>'He is the self-appointed saviour of Gaeldom, and our future
Sovereign, Commissar, President or what have you, when Scotland has
freed herself from the murderous burden of the English yoke.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes. That man,' Zoë said mildly, identifying Archie in her
mind. 'He is a little off his head, isn't he? Does he live around
here?'</p>

<p>'He is staying at the hotel at Moymore, I understand. He has
been doing missionary work on Mr Cullen, it seems.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Mr Cullen grinned a little sheepishly, 'I did just
wonder if he wasn't over-stating things a bit. I've met some Scots
in my time and they didn't seem to me to be the kind of people to
put up with the treatment Mr Brown was describing. Indeed, if
you'll forgive me, Mr Grant, they always seemed to me the kind of
people to get the best of whatever bargain was going.'</p>

<p>'Did you ever hear the Union better described?' Grant said to
Zoë.</p>

<p>'I never knew anything about the Union,' Zoë said comfortably,
'except that it took place in 1707.'</p>

<p>'Was there a battle, then?' Mr Cullen asked.</p>

<p>'No,' Grant said. 'Scotland stepped thankfully on to England's
band-wagon, and fell heir to all the benefits. Colonies,
Shakespeare, soap, solvency and so forth.'</p>

<p>'I hope Mr Brown doesn't go lecture-touring in the States,' Zoë
said, half asleep.</p>

<p>'He will,' Grant said. 'He will. All vociferous minorities go
lecture-touring in the States.'</p>

<p>'It will give them very wrong ideas, won't it?' Zoë said mildly.
Grant thought with what a blistering phrase Laura would have
expressed the same idea. 'They have the oddest ideas. When David
and I were there, the year before he was killed, we were always
being asked why we didn't stop taxing Canada. When we said we had
never taxed Canada they just looked at us as if we were telling
lies. Not very good lies, either.'</p>

<p>From Mr Cullen's expression Grant deduced that he too had had
'odd' ideas about Canadian taxation, but Zoë's eyes were closed.
Grant wondered if Mr Cullen realised that Zoë was quite unaware
that he was an American; that it had not occurred to her to
consider his accent, his nationality, his clothes or any personal
thing about him. She had accepted him as he stood, as a person. He
was just a flyer, like her brother; someone who had turned up in
time to share their picnic and who was pleasant and interesting to
talk to. It would not occur to her to pigeon-hole him, to put him
in any special category. If she was conscious at all of his narrow
a's she no doubt took him for a North-countryman.</p>

<p>He looked at her, half asleep there in the sun, and thought how
beautiful she was. He looked across at Mr Cullen and saw that he
too was looking at Zoë Kentallen and thinking how beautiful she
was. Their glances met and ran away from each other.</p>

<p>But Grant, who last night could imagine no greater felicity than
to sit and look at Zoë Kentallen, was conscious now of a faint
impatience with her, and this so shocked him that he took it out,
in his self-analytical way, to examine it. What flaw could there be
in this divinity? What imperfection in this princess from a
fairy-tale?</p>

<p>'You know very well what's wrong,' said that irreverent voice in
him. 'You want her to get the hell out of here so that you can find
out about B Seven.'</p>

<p>And for once he did not try to contradict the voice. He did in
brutal fact wish that Zoë would 'get the hell out of here'. The Zoë
whose very presence had made magic of yesterday afternoon was now
an encumbrance. Tiny prickles of boredom chased each other up and
down his spine. Lovely, simple, heavenly Zoë, do get a move on.
Creature of delight and princess of my dreams, go away.</p>

<p>He was rehearsing phrases for taking his own departure, when she
gave the abrupt half-sigh half-yawn of a child and said: 'Well,
there is a seven-pounder in the Cuddy Pool that must be finding
life dull without me.' And with her usual lack of fuss or chat she
took her things and departed into the spring afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr Cullen looked after her approvingly, and Grant waited for
comment. But it seemed that Mr Cullen too had been waiting for the
departure of his 'marked-down Countess'. He watched her out of
earshot and then said immediately:</p>

<p>'Mr Grant, why did you ask me if I had a photograph of Bill?
Does that mean that you think you know him?'</p>

<p>'No. No. But it would eliminate people who could not be
Bill.'</p>

<p>'Oh. Yes. Well, I haven't one in my pocket but I have one in my
grip at the hotel. It isn't a very good one, but it would give you
the general idea. Could I bring it to you sometime?'</p>

<p>'No. I'll walk down to Moymore with you now.'</p>

<p>'You will? You're certainly very kind, Mr Grant. You think
you've got a line on this thing? You haven't told me what those
words were. That quotation or whatever it was. That's really what I
came to ask you. What the talking-beasts thing was all about. If it
was a place he was interested in, you see, he might have gone
there, and I could go there too and cross his trail that way.'</p>

<p>'You're very fond of this Bill, aren't you?'</p>

<p>'Well, we've been together quite a time and though we're
opposites in most ways we get along fine. Just fine. I wouldn't
like anything to happen to Bill.'</p>

<p>Grant changed the conversation and asked about Tad Cullen's own
life. And while they walked down the glen to Moymore he heard about
the clean small town back in the States, and what a dull place it
seemed to a boy who could fly, and how wonderful the East had
seemed in the distance and how unexciting close up.</p>

<p>'Just Main Street with some smells,' Mr Cullen said.</p>

<p>'What did you do in Paris during your long wait for Bill to turn
up?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I helled around some. It wasn't much fun without Bill. I
met a couple of chaps I'd known in India, and we went places
together, but I was impatient all the time for Bill to be there. I
let them go, after a bit, and went to look at some of the places in
the tourist folders. Some of those old places are pretty nice.
There was one place built right over the water&mdash;a castle, I
mean&mdash;on stone arches, so that the river flowed underneath.
That was fine. It would have done very well for the Countess. Is
that the kind of place she lives in?'</p>

<p>'No,' Grant said, thinking of the difference between Chenonceaux
and Kentallen. 'She lives in a grim, flat, grey house with tiny
windows and poky rooms and narrow stairs and a front door as
welcoming as the exit of a laundry chute. It has two little turrets
on the fourth-storey level, next the roof, and in Scotland that
makes it a castle.'</p>

<p>'Sounds like a prison. Why does she stay?'</p>

<p>'A prison! No Prison Committee would consider it for a moment;
questions would be asked in the House immediately about its lack of
light, heating, sanitary conveniences, colour, beauty, space, and
what not. She stays because she loves the place. I doubt if she can
stay much longer, however. Death duties have been so heavy that she
will have to sell.'</p>

<p>'But will anyone buy it?'</p>

<p>'Not to live in. But some speculator will buy it, and cut down
the woods. The lead on the roof would probably fetch something; and
they'd have to take the roof off anyhow to avoid paying tax on the
house.'</p>

<p>'Hah! Dust-bowl stuff,' remarked Mr Cullen. 'It hasn't a moat,
by any chance?'</p>

<p>'No. Why?'</p>

<p>'I must see a moat before I go back to OCAL.' And then, after a
pause, 'I'm really very worried about Bill, Mr Grant.'</p>

<p>'Yes, it is certainly very odd.'</p>

<p>'That was nice of you,' Mr Cullen said unexpectedly.</p>

<p>'What was?'</p>

<p>'Not to say: "Don't you worry, he'll turn up all right!" I can
hardly keep my hands off people who say: "Don't you worry, he'll
turn up." I could strangle them.'</p>

<p>Moymore Hotel was a tiny version of Kentallen, without the
turrets. But it was whitewashed and cheerful, and the trees behind
it were coming into leaf. In the little flagged entrance-hall Mr
Cullen hesitated.</p>

<p>'In Britain I notice people don't ask you up to their hotel
bedroom. Would you like to wait in the sitting-room, perhaps?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no; I'll come up. I don't think we have any feeling about
hotel bedrooms. It is probably just that our hotel sitting-rooms
are so near our bedrooms that there is no need to go up, and so we
don't suggest it. When a public lounge is a day's journey from your
own room it is easier to take a guest with you, I suppose. That way
you are at least in the same hemisphere.'</p>

<p>Mr Cullen had a front room, looking across the road to the
fields and the river and the hills beyond. With his professional
eye Grant noticed the log fire ready-laid in the hearth and the
daffodils in the window: Moymore had standards; with his personal
mind he was concerned for this Tad Cullen, who had interrupted his
leave and come to the wilds of Caledonia to find the friend who
meant so much to him. A foreboding that he could not shake off had
grown in him with every step of the way to Moymore, and now it
filled him to the point of nausea.</p>

<p>The young man took a letter-case from his travelling-bag and
opened it on the dressing-table. It contained practically
everything but the wherewithal for writing letters. Among the mess
of papers, maps, travel folders and what not, there were two
leather articles: an address-book and a pocket-book. From the
pocket-book he took some photographs and riffled through the
feminine smiles until he found what he was looking for.</p>

<p>'Here it is. I'm afraid it isn't a very good one. It's just a
snapshot, you see. It was taken when a crowd of us were at the
beach.'</p>

<p>Grant took the proffered piece of paper, almost reluctantly.</p>

<p>'That's&mdash;' Tad Cullen was beginning, lifting his arm to
point.</p>

<p>'No, wait!' Grant said, stopping him. 'Let me see if I&mdash;if
I recognise anyone.'</p>

<p>There were perhaps a dozen young men in the photograph, which
had been taken on the verandah of some beach-house. They were
clustered round the steps and draped over the rickety wooden
railing in various stages of <i>deshabille</i>. Grant swept a swift
glance over their laughing faces and was conscious of a great
relief. There was no one there that he had ever&mdash;</p>

<p>And then he saw the man on the bottom step.</p>

<p>He was sitting with his feet pushed away from him into the sand,
his eyes screwed up against the sun and his chin tilted back a
little as if he had been in the act of turning to say something to
the men behind. It was just so that his head had been tilted back
against the pillow in Compartment B Seven on the morning of the 4th
of March.</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'Is that your friend?' Grant said, pointing to the man on the
bottom step.</p>

<p>'Yes, that's Bill. How did you know? Have you met him somewhere,
then?'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I'm inclined to think that I have. But of course, on
that photograph, I could hardly swear to it.'</p>

<p>'I don't want you to do any swearing. Just give me a general
weather report. Just tell me roughly when and where you saw him and
I'll track him down, don't you be in any doubt about it. Do you
know where you met him? I mean, do you remember?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes. I remember. I saw him in a compartment&mdash;a
sleeping-berth compartment&mdash;of the London mail when it was
running into Scoone early in the morning of the 4th of March. That
was the train I came north on.'</p>

<p>'You mean Bill came <i>here</i>? To Scotland? What for?'</p>

<p>'I don't know.'</p>

<p>'Didn't he tell you? Did you talk to him?'</p>

<p>'No. I couldn't.'</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>Grant put out his hand and pushed his companion gently backwards
so that he sat down in the chair that was behind him.</p>

<p>'I couldn't because he was no longer alive.'</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>'I'm truly sorry, Cullen. I wish I could pretend to you that it
might not be Bill, but short of going into a witness-box on oath I
am prepared to back my belief that it is.'</p>

<p>After another little silence Cullen said: 'Why was he dead? What
happened to him?'</p>

<p>'He had had a fair load of whisky and he fell backwards against
the solid porcelain wash-basin. It fractured his skull.'</p>

<p>'Who said all this?'</p>

<p>'That was the finding of the coroner's court. In London.'</p>

<p>'In London? Why in London?'</p>

<p>'Because he had died, according to the post-mortem, very shortly
after leaving Euston. And by English law, a sudden death is
investigated by a coroner and a jury.'</p>

<p>'But all that's just&mdash;just supposition,' Cullen said,
beginning to come alive and be angry. 'If he was alone, how can
anyone tell what happened to him?'</p>

<p>'Because the English police are the most painstaking creatures
as well as the most suspicious.'</p>

<p>'Police? There were police in on this thing?'</p>

<p>'Oh, assuredly. The police do the investigating and report in
public to the coroner and his jury. In this case there had been the
most exhaustive examination and tests. They knew in the end almost
to a mouthful how much neat whisky he had drunk, and at what
intervals before his&mdash;his death.'</p>

<p>'And that about his falling backwards&mdash;how could they know
that?'</p>

<p>'They went prowling with microscopes. The oil and broken hair
were still evident on the edge of the basin. And the skull injury
was consistent with a backwards fall against just such an
object.'</p>

<p>Cullen calmed down at this, but he looked disorientated.</p>

<p>'How do you know all this?' he asked, vaguely; and then with
growing suspicion: 'How did you come to see him anyway?'</p>

<p>'When I was on my way out I came across the sleeping-car
attendant trying to rouse him. The man thought he was just sleeping
it off, because the whisky bottle had rolled all over the floor and
the compartment smelt as if he had been making a night of it.'</p>

<p>This did not satisfy Tad Cullen. 'You mean that was the only
time you saw him? Just for a moment, lying&mdash;lying dead there,
and you could recognise him from a snapshot&mdash;a not very good
snapshot&mdash;weeks later?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I was impressed by his face. Faces are my business; and in
a way my hobby. I was interested in the way the slant of the
eyebrows gave the face a reckless expression, even&mdash;even as it
was, without any real expression whatever. And the interest was
intensified in a way that was quite accidental.'</p>

<p>'What was that?' Cullen was not giving an inch.</p>

<p>'When I was having breakfast, in the Station Hotel at Scoone, I
found that I had picked up by accident a newspaper that had been
tumbled off the berth when the attendant was trying to waken him,
and in the Stop Press&mdash;the blank space, you know&mdash;someone
had been pencilling some lines of verse. "The beasts that talk, the
streams that stand, the stones that walk, the singing sand&mdash;"
then two blank lines, and then: "that guard the way to
Paradise."'</p>

<p>'That was what you advertised about,' Cullen said, his face
growing momentarily blacker. 'What was it to you that you went to
the trouble of advertising about it?'</p>

<p>'I wanted to know where the lines came from if they were lines
from some book. If they were lines in the process of being made
into a poem, then I wanted to know what the subject was.'</p>

<p>'Why? What should you care?'</p>

<p>'I had no choice in the matter. The thing ran round and round in
my head. Do you know anyone called Charles Martin?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't. And don't change the subject.'</p>

<p>'I'm not changing the subject, oddly enough. Do me the kindness
to think of it seriously for a moment. Have you ever, at any time,
heard of or known a Charles Martin?'</p>

<p>'I've told you, no! I don't have to think. And <i>of course</i>
you're changing the subject! What has Charles Martin got to do with
this?'</p>

<p>'According to the police, the man who was found dead in
Compartment B Seven was a French mechanic called Charles
Martin.'</p>

<p>After a moment Cullen said: 'Look, Mr Grant, maybe I'm not very
bright, but you're not making sense. What you're saying is that you
saw Bill Kenrick lying dead in a compartment of a train, but he
wasn't Bill Kenrick at all; he was a man called Martin.'</p>

<p>'No, what I'm saying is that the police believe him to be a man
called Martin.'</p>

<p>'Well, I take it they have good grounds for their belief.'</p>

<p>'Excellent grounds. He had letters, and identity papers. Even
better, his people have identified him.'</p>

<p>'They did! Then what have you been stringing me along for! There
isn't any suggestion that that man was Bill! If the police are
satisfied that the man was a Frenchman called Martin, why in
thunder should you decide that he wasn't Martin at all but Bill
Kenrick!'</p>

<p>'Because I'm the only person in the world who has seen both the
man in B Seven and that snapshot.' Grant nodded at the photograph
where it lay on the dressing-table.</p>

<p>This gave Cullen pause. Then he said: 'But that's a poor
photograph. It can't convey much to someone who has never seen
Bill.'</p>

<p>'It may be a poor photograph in the sense that it is a mere
snapshot, but it is a very good likeness indeed.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Cullen said slowly, 'it is.'</p>

<p>'Consider three things; three facts. One: Charles Martin's
people had not seen him for years, and then they saw only a dead
face; if you are told that your son has died, and no one suggests
that there is any doubt as to identity, you see the face you
expected to see. Two: the man known as Charles Martin was found
dead on a train on the same day as Bill Kenrick was due to join you
in Paris. Three: in his compartment there was a pencilled jingle
about talking beasts and singing sands, a subject that on your own
showing had interested Bill Kenrick.'</p>

<p>'Did you tell the police about the paper?'</p>

<p>'I tried to. They weren't interested. There was no mystery, you
see. They knew who the man was, and how he died, and that was all
that concerned them.'</p>

<p>'It might have interested them that he was writing verse in
English.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no. There is no evidence that he wrote anything, or that
the paper belonged to him at all. He may have picked it up
somewhere.'</p>

<p>'The whole thing's crazy,' Cullen said, angry and
bewildered.</p>

<p>'It's fantastic. But at the heart of all the whirling absurdity
there is a small core of stillness.'</p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'Yes. There is one small clear space on which one can stand
while taking one's bearings.'</p>

<p>'What is that?'</p>

<p>'Your friend Bill Kenrick is missing. And out of a crowd of
strange faces, I pick Bill Kenrick as a man I saw dead in a
sleeping-compartment at Scoone on the morning of the 4th of
March.'</p>

<p>Cullen thought this over. 'Yes,' he said drearily, 'I suppose
that makes sense. I suppose it must be Bill. I suppose I knew all
the time that something&mdash;something awful had happened. He
would never have left me without word. He would have written or
telephoned or something to say why he hadn't turned up on time. But
what was he doing on a train to Scotland? What was he doing on a
train anyhow?'</p>

<p>'How: anyhow?'</p>

<p>'If Bill wanted to go somewhere he would fly. He wouldn't take a
train.'</p>

<p>'Lots of people take a night train because it saves time. You
sleep and travel at the same time. The question is: why as Charles
Martin?'</p>

<p>'I think it's a case for Scotland Yard.'</p>

<p>'I don't think the Yard would thank us.'</p>

<p>'I'm not asking for their thanks,' Cullen said tartly, 'I'm
instructing them to find out what happened to my buddy.'</p>

<p>'I still don't think they would be interested.'</p>

<p>'They'd better be!'</p>

<p>'You have no evidence at all that Bill Kenrick didn't duck of
his own accord; that he isn't having a good time on his own until
it is time to go back to OCAL.'</p>

<p>'But he was found dead in a railway compartment!' Cullen said in
a voice that was nearly a howl.</p>

<p>'Oh, no. That was Charles Martin. About whom there is no mystery
whatever.'</p>

<p>'But you can identify Martin as Kenrick!'</p>

<p>'I can say, of course, that in my opinion that face in the
snapshot is the face I saw in Compartment B Seven on the morning of
March the 4th. Scotland Yard will say that I am entitled to my
opinion, but that I am without doubt misled by a resemblance, since
the man in Compartment B Seven is one Charles Martin, a mechanic,
and a native of Marseilles, in the suburbs of which his parents
still live.'</p>

<p>'You're very smooth in the part of Scotland Yard, aren't you!
All the same&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I ought to be. I've worked there for more years than I care to
think about. I shall be going back there a week Monday, as soon as
my holiday is over.'</p>

<p>'You mean that <i>you</i> are Scotland Yard?'</p>

<p>'Not the whole of it. One of its minor props. Props in the
support sense. I don't carry cards in my fishing clothes but if you
come up to my host's house with me he will vouch for my
genuineness.'</p>

<p>'Oh. No. No, of course I believe you, Mr&mdash;er&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Inspector. But we'll stick to Mr, since I'm off duty.'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry if I was fresh. It just didn't occur to me&mdash;You
see, you don't expect to meet Scotland Yard in real life. It's just
something you read about. You don't expect them
to&mdash;to&mdash;'</p>

<p>'To go fishing.'</p>

<p>'No, I guess you don't, at that. Only in books.'</p>

<p>'Well, now that you have accepted me as genuine, and you know
that my version of Scotland Yard's reaction is not only accurate
but straight from the horse's mouth, what are we going to do?'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Laura heard next morning that Grant intended
to go in to Scoone instead of spending the day on the river, she
was indignant.</p>

<p>'But I've just made up a wonderful luncheon for you and Zoë,'
she said. He was left with the impression that her dismay was
rooted in some cause more valid than a miscalculated meal, but his
mind was too busy with more important matters to analyse
trivialities.</p>

<p>'There's a young American staying at Moymore who has come to ask
my help about something. I thought that he might take my place on
the river, if no one has any objection. He has fished quite a bit,
he tells me. Perhaps Pat would like to show him the ropes.'</p>

<p>Pat had come to breakfast in a state so radiant that the glow of
it could be felt clear across the table. It was the first day of
the Easter holidays. He looked with interest when he heard his
cousin's suggestion. There were few things in life that he enjoyed
so much as showing someone something.</p>

<p>'What's his name?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Tad Cullen.'</p>

<p>'What's "Tad"?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. Short for Theodore, perhaps.'</p>

<p>'M&mdash;m&mdash;m,' said Pat doubtfully.</p>

<p>'He's a flyer.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said Pat, his brow clearing. 'I thought maybe with a name
like that he was a professor.'</p>

<p>'No. He flies to and fro across Arabia.'</p>

<p>'Arabia!' said Pat, rolling the R so that the mundane Scots
breakfast table scintillated with reflections of the jewelled East.
Between modern transport and ancient Bagdad, Tad Cullen seemed to
have satisfactory credentials. Pat would 'show him' with
pleasure.</p>

<p>'Of course Zoë gets first choice of places to fish,' Pat
said.</p>

<p>If Grant had imagined that Pat's infatuation would take the form
of blushing silences and a mooning adoration, he was wrong. Pat's
only sign of surrender was the constant interjection of 'me and
Zoë' into his conversation; and it was to be observed that the
personal pronoun still came first.</p>

<p>So Grant borrowed the car after breakfast and went down to
Moymore to tell Tad Cullen that a small boy with red hair and a
green kilt would be waiting for him, with all appliances and means
to boot, by the swing bridge across the Turlie. He himself would be
back from Scoone in time to join them on the river some time in the
afternoon, he hoped.</p>

<p>'I'd like to come with you, Mr Grant,' Cullen said. 'Have you
got a line on this thing? Is that why you're going in to Scoone
this morning?'</p>

<p>'No. It's to look for a line that I'm going in. There's not a
thing you can do just now, so you might as well have a day on the
river.'</p>

<p>'All right, Mr Grant. You're the boss. What's your young
friend's name?'</p>

<p>'Pat Rankin,' Grant said, and drove away to Scoone.</p>

<p>He had spent most of last night lying awake with his eyes on the
ceiling, letting the patterns in his mind slip and fade into each
other like trick camera work in a film. Constantly the patterns
materialised, and broke, and dissolved, never the same for two
moments together. He lay supine and let them dance their endless
slow interlacing; taking no part in their gyrations; as detached as
if they were a display of Northern Lights.</p>

<p>It was that way his mind worked best. It would also work the
other way, of course. Work very well. In problems involving a
time-place sequence for instance. In matters where A was at a spot
X at 5.30 p.m. on the umpteenth inst, Grant's mind worked with the
tidiness of a calculating machine. But in an affair where motive
was all, he sat back and let his mind loose on the problem.
Presently, if he left it alone, it would throw up the pattern that
he needed.</p>

<p>He still had no idea why Bill Kenrick had journeyed to the north
of Scotland when he should have been travelling to Paris to meet
his friend; still less had he any idea why he should have been
travelling with another man's papers. But he was beginning to have
an idea as to why Bill Kenrick developed his sudden interest in
Arabia. Cullen, looking at the world from his limited, flyer's
point of view, had thought of that interest in terms of flying
routes. But Grant was sure that the interest had other origins. On
Cullen's own showing, Kenrick had exhibited none of the usual signs
of 'nerves'. It was unlikely that his obsession with the route he
flew had anything to do with weather in any of its forms.
Somewhere, sometime, on one of those flights over that 'damned
dreary' route, Kenrick had found something that interested him. And
that interest had begun on an occasion when he had been blown far
off his course by one of the dust-storms that haunted the interior
of Arabia. He had come back from that experience 'concussed'. 'Not
listening to what was said to him.' 'Still back there.'</p>

<p>So this morning Grant was going in to Scoone to find out what
might possibly have interested Bill Kenrick in the interior of that
bleak and stony immensity; in the desert and forbidding
half-continent that was Arabia. And for that, of course, he was
going to Mr Tallisker. Whether it was the rateable value of a
cottage or the composition of lava that one wanted to be
enlightened about, one went to Mr Tallisker.</p>

<p>The Public Library in Scoone was deserted at this hour of the
morning and he found Mr Tallisker having a doughnut and a cup of
coffee. Grant thought the doughnut an endearingly childish and
robust choice for a man who looked as though he lived on gaufrettes
and China tea with lemon. Mr Tallisker was delighted to see Grant,
asked how his study of the Islands was progressing, listened with
interest to Grant's heretic account of that Paradise, and was
helpful about his new search. Arabia? Oh, yes, they had a whole
shelf of books about the country. Almost as many people wrote books
about Arabia as about the Hebrides. There was, too, if Mr Tallisker
might be permitted to say so, the same tendency to idealise the
subject in its devotees.</p>

<p>'You think that, boiled down to plain fact, they are both just
windy deserts.'</p>

<p>Oh, no; not entirely. That was being a little&mdash;wholesale.
Mr Tallisker had had much happiness and beauty from the Islands.
But the tendency to idealise a primitive people was perhaps the
same in each case. And here was the shelf of books on the subject,
and he would leave Mr Grant to study them at his leisure.</p>

<p>The books were in a reference room, and there was no other
reader there. The door closed on the silence and he was left with
his search. He went through the row of books very much as he had
gone through the row about the Hebrides in the sitting-room at
Clune, gutting each book with a swift practised eye. The range was
much the same as it had been in the earlier case: all the way from
the sentimentalists to the scientists. The only difference was that
in this case some of the books were classics, as befitted a classic
subject.</p>

<p>If Grant had had any last lingering doubt that the man in B
Seven was Bill Kenrick, it went when he found that the desert part
of south-eastern Arabia, the Empty Quarter, was called the
Rub'al-Khali.</p>

<p>So that was what 'robbing the Caley' had been!</p>

<p>After that he devoted his interest to the Empty Quarter, picking
each book from the shelf, flipping through the pages on this one
region, and putting it back again to go on to the next. And
presently a phrase caught his eye. 'Inhabited by monkeys.' Monkeys,
said his mind. Talking beasts. He turned the page back to see what
the paragraph had been talking about.</p>

<p>It was talking about Wabar.</p>

<p>Wabar, it seemed, was the Atlantis of Arabia. The fabled city of
Ad ibn Kin'ad. Somewhere in the time between legend and history it
had been destroyed by fire for its sins. For it had been rich and
sinful beyond the power of words to express. Its palaces had housed
the most beautiful concubines and its stables the most perfect
horses in the world, the one no less finely decked than the other.
It stood in country so fertile that one had only to reach out a
hand to pluck the fruits of the soil. There was infinite leisure to
sin old sins and devise new ones. So destruction had come on the
city. It had come in a night, with cleansing fire. And now Wabar,
the fabled city, was a cluster of ruins; guarded by the shifting
sands, by cliffs of stone that for ever changed place and form; and
inhabited by a monkey race and by evil jinns. No one could approach
the place because the jinns blew dust-storms in the faces of those
who sought it.</p>

<p>That was Wabar.</p>

<p>And no one, it seemed, had ever found the ruins although every
Arabian explorer had looked for them, openly or secretly. Indeed,
no two explorers agreed as to which part of Arabia the legend
referred to. Grant went back through the various volumes, using the
magic key, the word Wabar, and found that each authority had his
own pet theory, and that the argued sites lay as far apart as Oman
and the Yemen. None of the writers, he noticed, attempted to
belittle or discount the legend as palliation of their failure; the
story was universal in Arabia and constant in its form, and
sentimentalist and scientist alike believed that it had its basis
in fact. It had been every explorer's dream to be the discoverer of
Wabar, but the sands and the jinns and the mirages had guarded it
well.</p>

<p>'It is probable,' wrote one of the greatest, 'that when the
fabled city is at last found it will be by no striving or
calculation but by accident.'</p>

<p>By accident.</p>

<p>By a flyer blown off his course by a dust-storm?</p>

<p>Was that what Bill Kenrick had seen when he came out of the
solid brown cloud of sand that had blinded and buffeted him? Empty
palaces in the sand? Was that what he had gone out of his way to
look for&mdash;perhaps to look <i>at</i>&mdash;when he 'began to
come in late as a habit'?</p>

<p>He had said nothing after that first experience. And that, if
what he had seen was a city in the sand, was understandable. He
would have been teased about it: teased about mirages, and one over
the eight, and what not. Even if any of the OCAL boys had ever
heard the legend&mdash;and in so shifting, so easy-come a crowd it
was unlikely&mdash;they would still have teased him about
wish-fathered ideas. So Bill, who wrote those tight-closed M's and
N's and was 'just a bit cagey', said nothing and went back to have
another look. Went back again and again. Either because he wanted
to find the place he had seen, or to look at a place he had already
pin-pointed.</p>

<p>He studied maps. He read books about Arabia. And
then&mdash;?</p>

<p>Then he decided to come to England.</p>

<p>He had arranged to go to Paris with Tad Cullen. But instead he
wanted a little time by himself in England. He had no people in
England. He had not been in England for years, and according to
Cullen had never seemed homesick for the place nor written to
anyone there in any kind of regular correspondence. He had been
brought up by an aunt when his parents were killed and she too was
now dead. He had never until then had any desire to go back to
England.</p>

<p>Grant sat back and let the stillness fall round him. He could
almost hear the dust coming to rest. Year after year the dust
falling in the quiet. Like Wabar.</p>

<p>Bill Kenrick came to England. And about three weeks later, when
he is due to meet his friend in Paris, he turns up in Scotland as
Charles Martin.</p>

<p>Grant could imagine why he wanted to come to England, but why
the masquerade? Why the flying visit to the North?</p>

<p>Whom was he going to visit as Charles Martin?</p>

<p>He could have paid that flying visit and still have met his
friend in Paris on the appointed date if it had not been for the
accident of his tipsy fall. He could have interviewed someone in
the Highlands and then flown from Scoone to meet his friend at the
Hotel St Jacques for dinner.</p>

<p>But why as Charles Martin?</p>

<p>Grant put the books back on their shelf with an approving pat
that he had never wasted on the Hebrides selection, and went to
call on Mr Tallisker in his little office. He had at least got his
line on Kenrick. He knew how to cross his trail.</p>

<p>'Who would you say was the greatest authority on Arabia in
England today?' he asked Mr Tallisker.</p>

<p>Mr Tallisker waved his beribboned pince-nez and smiled in a
deprecating way. There were what might be termed a swarm of
successors to Thomas and Philby and the other great names, he said,
but he supposed that only Heron Lloyd ranked as a really great
authority. It was possible that he, Mr Tallisker, was prejudiced in
Lloyd's favour because he was the only one of the crowd who wrote
English that was literature, but it was true that apart from his
gifts as a writer he had stature and integrity and a great
reputation. He had done some spectacular journeys in the course of
his various explorations, and had considerable standing among the
Arabs.</p>

<p>Grant thanked Mr Tallisker and went away to look up <i>Who's
Who</i>. He wanted Heron Lloyd's address.</p>

<p>Then he went to have a meal; and instead of going to the
Caledonian, which was convenient and sufficiently bestarred, he
obeyed an obscure impulse and walked to the other side of the town
so that he could eat where he had eaten breakfast with the shade of
B Seven on that dark morning only a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>There was no half-fit gloom in the dining-room today; the place
was starched and shining, silver, glass and linen. There was even a
shirt-front where a head waiter hovered. But there was also Mary;
calm and comfortable and plump as she had been that morning. He
remembered how in need of soothing and reassurance he had been, and
could hardly believe that that tortured and exhausted creature
could have been himself.</p>

<p>He sat down at the same table, near the screens in front of the
service door, and Mary came to take his order and to ask how the
fishing on the Turlie was these days.</p>

<p>'How did you know I was fishing the Turlie?'</p>

<p>'You were with Mr Rankin when you came in for breakfast, off the
train.'</p>

<p>Off the train. He had come off the train after that night of
conflict and suffering; that loathsome night. He had come off the
train, leaving B Seven dead there with a casual glance and a
passing moment of regret. But B Seven had paid back a hundred-fold
that moment of easy compassion. B Seven had come with him and in
the end had saved him. It was B Seven who had sent him to the
Islands, on that mad, cold, blown search for nothing. In that
strange absurd limbo he had done all those things that he could
never have done elsewhere; he had laughed till the tears ran, he
had danced, he had let himself be flung about like a leaf from one
empty horizon to the next, he had sung, he had sat still and
looked. And he had come back a whole man. He owed B Seven more than
he could ever repay.</p>

<p>He thought about Bill Kenrick while he had his luncheon; the
young man who had had no roots. Had he been lonely in his
unattached life, or just free? And if free, was it a swallow's
freedom, or an eagle's? A sun-seeking skimming, or a soaring
lordliness?</p>

<p>At least he had had a trait that in all climes and ages has been
both rare and endearing: he was the man of action who was also by
instinct a poet. It was what distinguished him from the light-come
crowds of OCAL employees who span their airy patterns across the
continents as unthinking as mosquitoes. It was what distinguished
him from the milling five-o'clock crowds in a London railway
station to whom adventure was half-a-crown each way. If the dead
boy in B Seven had been neither a Sidney nor a Grenfell, he had at
least been of their kind.</p>

<p>And for that Grant loved him.</p>

<p>'You know,' said that voice in him, 'if you don't take care
you'll develop a "thing" about Bill Kenrick.'</p>

<p>'I've got it already,' he said cheerfully; and the voice retired
in a defeated silence.</p>

<p>He over-tipped Mary and went away to book two seats on the
morning plane to London. He had still more than a week of holiday
to come and the Turlie still swarmed with fish, beautiful silver
clean-run fighting fish, but he had other business. Since yesterday
afternoon he had only one business: Bill Kenrick.</p>

<p>He had qualms about that air journey to London, but not very
serious qualms. He could hardly recognise, when he looked back at
him, that demon-ridden frightened creature who had stepped down on
to Scoone platform from the London mail less than a month ago. All
that was left of that deplorable object was a slight fear of being
afraid. The terror itself was no longer there.</p>

<p>He bought enough sweets for Patrick to keep him sick for three
months on end, and drove back to the hills. He was afraid that the
sweets were a little too elegant to please Patrick entirely&mdash;a
little too 'jessie-like' perhaps?&mdash;since Pat's avowed
favourites were something in Mrs Mair's window labelled Ogo-Pogo
Eyes. But Laura would no doubt dole out the Scoone ones in driblets
anyway.</p>

<p>He halted the car above the river, half-way between Moymore and
Scoone, and went down across the moor to look for Tad Cullen. It
was still early afternoon and he would not yet have finished his
after-luncheon spell on the river.</p>

<p>He had not yet begun it. As Grant came to the edge of the moor
and looked down at the river's immediate hollow, he saw below him
in the mid-distance a small group of three persons, idle and
relaxed on the bank. Zoë was propped in her favourite position
against a rock, and on either side of her, on a level with her
crossed feet and gazing at her with an unwavering attention, were
her two followers: Pat Rankin and Tad Cullen. Looking at them,
amused and indulgent, Grant became aware that Bill Kenrick had done
him a final service for which he had not yet had credit. Bill
Kenrick had saved him from falling in love with Zoë Kentallen.</p>

<p>A few more hours would have done it. A few more hours in her
uninterrupted company, and he would have been involved past
recovery. Bill Kenrick had intervened just in time.</p>

<p>It was Pat who saw him first and came to meet him and bring him
back to the company as children and dogs do to those of whom they
approve. Zoë tilted her head back to watch him come and said: 'You
haven't missed anything, Alan Grant. No one has had a nibble all
day. Would you like to take my rod for a little? Perhaps a change
of rhythm will fetch them.'</p>

<p>Grant said that he would like that very much, since his time for
fishing was running out.</p>

<p>'You have still a week to catch everything in the river,' she
said.</p>

<p>Grant wondered how she had known that. 'No,' he said, 'I am
going back to London tomorrow morning,' and for the first time saw
Zoë react to a stimulus as an adult would. The instant regret on
her face was as vivid as that on Pat's, but unlike Pat she
controlled and removed it. She said in her polite gentle voice how
sorry she was, but her face no longer showed any emotion. It was
her fairy-tale face again; the Hans Andersen illustration.</p>

<p>Before he could consider this phenomenon, Tad Cullen said: 'Can
I come back with you, Mr Grant? To London.'</p>

<p>'I meant you to. I've booked two seats on the morning
plane.'</p>

<p>In the end Grant took the rod that Tad Cullen was using&mdash;a
spare one from Clune&mdash;so that they could go down river
together and talk. But Zoë made no motion to continue her
fishing.</p>

<p>'I've had enough,' she said, unjointing her rod. 'I think I
shall go back to Clune and write some letters.'</p>

<p>Pat stood irresolute, still like a friendly dog between two
allegiances, and then said: 'I'm going back with Zoë.'</p>

<p>He said it, Grant thought, almost as if he were championing her
instead of merely accompanying her; as if he had joined an
Unfair-To-Zoë movement. But since no one could ever think of being
unfair to Zoë, his attitude was surely unnecessary.</p>

<p>From the rock where he sat with Tad Cullen to give him the news
he watched the two figures grow small across the moor, and wondered
a little at that sudden withdrawal, at the dispirited air that hung
about her progress. She looked like a discouraged child, tired and
trailing homeward unexpectant. Perhaps the thought of David, her
husband, had suddenly drowned her. That was the way with grief: it
left you alone for months together until you thought that you were
cured, and then without warning it blotted out the sunlight.</p>

<p>'But that wouldn't be much to get excited about, would it?' Tad
Cullen was saying.</p>

<p>'What wouldn't?'</p>

<p>'This ancient city you're talking about. Would anyone get all
that excited about it? I mean, about a few ruins. Ruins are two a
nickel in the world nowadays.'</p>

<p>'Not these, they aren't,' Grant said, forgetting Zoë. 'The man
who found Wabar would make history.'</p>

<p>'I thought when you said he had found something important you
were going to say munition works in the desert or something like
that.'</p>

<p>'Now that really is something that is two for a nickel!'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Secret munition plants. No one who found one of those would be
a celebrity.'</p>

<p>Tad's ears pricked. 'A celebrity? You mean the man who found
this place would be a celebrity?'</p>

<p>'I've already said so.'</p>

<p>'No. You just said he would make history.'</p>

<p>'True. Too true,' Grant said. 'The terms are not synonymous any
more. Yes, he would be a celebrity. Tutankhamen's tomb would be
nothing to it.'</p>

<p>'And you think Bill will have gone to see this fellow, this
Lloyd guy?'</p>

<p>'If not to him, then to someone else in that line. He wanted to
talk to someone who would take what he had to tell as a serious
matter; I mean, who would not just tease him about seeing things.
And he wanted to meet someone who would be personally interested
and excited by his news. Well, he would do just what I did. He
would go to a museum, or a library, or perhaps even to one of the
Information departments at the big stores, and find out who the
best-known English explorer of Arabia happened to be. He would
probably be given a choice, since librarians and curators are
pedantic people and Information departments subject to the law of
libel, but Lloyd is head-and-shoulders above the others because he
writes almost as well as he explores. He is the household word of
the bunch, so to speak. So the chances are twenty to one that Bill
would choose Lloyd.'</p>

<p>'So we find out when and where he saw Lloyd and pick up his
trail from there.'</p>

<p>'Yes. We also find out whether he went to see Lloyd as Charles
Martin or under his own name.'</p>

<p>'Why would he go as Charles Martin?'</p>

<p>'Who knows? You said that he was a little cagey. He may have
wanted to keep back his connection with OCAL. Are OCAL strict about
their routes and schedules? It may be as simple as that.'</p>

<p>Cullen sat in silence for a little, making a pattern in the turf
with the butt of the fishing-rod. Then he said:</p>

<p>'Mr Grant, don't think I'm being dramatic or&mdash;or
sensational or silly, but you don't think, do you, that Bill could
have been bumped off?'</p>

<p>'He could have been, of course. Murder does happen. Even clever
murders. But the chances against it are very long.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Well, for one thing it has passed a police investigation. In
spite of all the detective stories to the contrary the Criminal
Investigation Department really is a highly efficient organisation.
By far the most efficient organisation, if you'll accept a slightly
prejudiced opinion, that exists in this country today&mdash;or in
any other country, in any period.'</p>

<p>'But the police have already been wrong about one thing.'</p>

<p>'About his identity, you mean. Yes, but they can hardly be
blamed for that.'</p>

<p>'You mean because the set-up was perfect. Well, what's to hinder
the other set-up being as perfect as the Charles Martin one?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, of course. Clever murders, as I say, do happen. But it
is much easier to forge an identity than to get away with murder.
How do you think it was done? Someone came in and slugged him after
the train left Euston, and arranged it to look like a fall?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'But no one visited B Seven after the train left Euston. B Eight
heard him come back shortly after the attendant had done his round,
and close his door. After that there was no conversation.'</p>

<p>'It doesn't need conversation to slug a man on the back of the
head.'</p>

<p>'No, but it does need opportunity. The chances against opening
that door and finding the occupant in the right position for
slugging him are astronomical. It's not an easy place to take a
swing at anyone, even choosing your own time: a sleeping
compartment. Anyone with lethal intentions would have to come into
the compartment: it couldn't be done from the corridor. It couldn't
be done when the victim was in bed. And it couldn't be done with
the victim facing you; and he would face round as soon as he was
aware that there was someone in the compartment. Therefore it could
only be done after preliminary conversation. And B Eight says there
was no conversation or visiting. B Eight is the kind of woman who
"can't sleep on a train". She makes up her mind about that
beforehand, and every little sound and squeak and rattle is
welcomed as a sign of her suffering. She is usually dead asleep and
snoring by about half-past two; but long before that time Bill
Kenrick was dead.'</p>

<p>'Did she hear him fall?'</p>

<p>'She heard a "thump", it seems, and thought that he was taking
down a suitcase. He had no suitcase, of course, that would make a
thump in being handled. Did Bill speak French, by the way?'</p>

<p>'Well enough to get by.'</p>

<p>'<i>Avec moi.</i>'</p>

<p>'Yes. About that. Why?'</p>

<p>'I just wondered. It looks as if he planned to spend a night
somewhere.'</p>

<p>'In Scotland, you mean?'</p>

<p>'Yes. The Testament and the French novel. And yet he didn't
speak French.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps the Scotch party didn't either.'</p>

<p>'No. Scotch parties usually don't. But if he planned to spend a
night somewhere he couldn't meet you that day in Paris.'</p>

<p>'Oh, being a day late wouldn't worry Bill. He could have sent me
a wire on the 4th.'</p>

<p>'Yes...I wish I could think of his reason for blacking himself
all over.'</p>

<p>'Blacking himself?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Dressing the part so completely. Why did he want someone
to think that he was French?'</p>

<p>'I can't think why anyone would want anyone to think they were
French,' Mr Cullen said. 'What are you hoping from this Lloyd
guy?'</p>

<p>'I'm hoping that it was Lloyd who saw him away at Euston. They
were talking about the Rub'al-Khali, remember. What sounded to Old
Yughourt's ear&mdash;quite typically&mdash;as "rob the Caley".'</p>

<p>'Does this Lloyd live in London?'</p>

<p>'Yes. In Chelsea.'</p>

<p>'I hope he is at home.'</p>

<p>'I hope so indeed. Now I am going to have a last hour with the
Turlie, and if you can bear just to sit and think the problem over
for a little, then perhaps you would come back to supper at Clune
and meet the Rankin family?'</p>

<p>'That would be fine,' Tad said. 'I haven't said goodbye to the
Countess. I'm a convert to Countesses. Would you say that the
Countess is typical of your aristocracy, Mr Grant?'</p>

<p>'In the sense of having all the qualities of the type, she is
indeed typical,' Grant said, picking his way down the bank to the
water.</p>

<p>He fished until the level light warned him that it was evening,
but he caught nothing. This was a result that neither surprised nor
disappointed him. His thoughts were elsewhere. He no longer saw
Bill Kenrick's dead face in the swirling water, but Bill Kenrick's
personality was all round him. Bill Kenrick possessed his mind.</p>

<p>He reeled in for the last time with a sigh, not for his empty
bag or his farewell to the Turlie, but because he was no nearer to
finding a reason why Bill Kenrick should have blacked himself all
over.</p>

<p>'I'm glad I had this chance of seeing this island,' Tad said as
they walked up to Clune. 'It's not a bit the way I imagined
it.'</p>

<p>From his tone Grant deduced that he had imagined it as a sort of
Wabar; inhabited by monkeys and jinns.</p>

<p>'I wish it had been a happier way of seeing it,' he said. 'You
must come back some day and fish in peace.'</p>

<p>Tad grinned a little shamefacedly and rubbed his tumbled hair.
'Oh, I guess it will always be Paris for me. Or Vienna, maybe. When
you spend your days in godforsaken little towns you look forward to
the bright lights.'</p>

<p>'Well, we do have bright lights in London.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Maybe I'll have another smack at London. London's all
right.'</p>

<p>Laura came to the door as they arrived and said: 'Alan, what's
this I hear about&mdash;' and then noticed his companion. 'Oh. You
must be Tad. Pat says you don't believe that there <i>are</i> any
fish in the Turlie. How d'you do. I'm so glad you've come up. Go in
and Pat will show you where to wash, and then come and join us in a
drink before supper.' She summoned Pat, who was hovering, and
passed the visitor into his charge, blocking the way firmly on any
advance by her cousin. When she had got rid of Mr Cullen she turned
again to her charge. 'Alan, you're <i>not</i> going back to town
tomorrow?'</p>

<p>'But I'm cured, Lalla,' he said, thinking that that was what
disturbed her.</p>

<p>'Well, what if you are? There is still more than a week of your
leave, and the Turlie better than it has been for seasons. You
can't give up all that just to get some young man out of some hole
that he's got himself into.'</p>

<p>'Tad Cullen's not in any hole. I'm not being quixotic, if that
is what you're thinking. I'm going away tomorrow because that is
the thing I want to do.' He was going to add, 'I just can't wait to
get away', but even with an intimate like Laura that might lead to
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>'But we are all so happy, and things were&mdash;' she broke off.
'Oh, well. Nothing I can say will make you change your mind. I
ought to know that. Nothing has ever made you deviate by a hair's
breadth from any line that you once set your mind on. You've always
been a damned Juggernaut.'</p>

<p>'A damned horrible metaphor,' he said. 'Couldn't you make it a
bullet or a bee-line or something equally undeviating but less
destructive?'</p>

<p>She put her arm through his, friendly and a little amused. 'But
you are destructive, darling.' And as he began a protest: 'All in
the very kindest and most lethal way imaginable. Come and have a
drink. You look as if you could do with one.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">EVEN the undeviating Grant, of course, had his
unsure moments.</p>

<p>'You fool!' said that inner voice, as he was climbing into the
London plane at Scoone. 'Giving up even a day of your precious
leave to hunt will-o'-the-wisps.'</p>

<p>'I'm not hunting any will-o'-the-wisps. I just want to know what
happened to Bill Kenrick.'</p>

<p>'And what is Bill Kenrick to you that you should give up even an
hour of your free time for him?'</p>

<p>'I'm interested in him. If you want to know, I like him.'</p>

<p>'You don't know a thing about him. You have made a god in your
own image, and are busy worshipping it.'</p>

<p>'I know quite a lot about him. I've listened to Tad Cullen.'</p>

<p>'A prejudiced witness.'</p>

<p>'A nice boy, which is more important. The Cullen boy had a wide
choice of friends in an organisation like OCAL and he chose Bill
Kenrick.'</p>

<p>'Lots of nice boys have chosen criminal friends.'</p>

<p>'Come to that, I've known some nice criminals.'</p>

<p>'Yeah? How many? And how many minutes of your leave would you
give up to a criminal type?'</p>

<p>'Not thirty seconds. But the Kenrick boy is no criminal.'</p>

<p>'A complete set of another man's papers isn't a particularly
law-abiding thing to be carrying round, is it?'</p>

<p>'I'll find out about that presently. Meanwhile shut up and leave
me alone.'</p>

<p>'Huh! Stumped, aren't you!'</p>

<p>'Go away.'</p>

<p>'Sticking your neck out for an unknown boy at your age!'</p>

<p>'Who's sticking his neck out?'</p>

<p>'You didn't have to do this plane journey at all. You could have
gone back by train or by road. But no, you had to arrange to have
yourself shut into a box. A box without a window or a door that
will open. A box you can't escape from. A tight, silent, enclosed,
sealed&mdash;'</p>

<p>'<i>Shut up!</i>'</p>

<p>'Huh! You're breathing short already! In about ten minutes the
thing will hit you for six. You ought to have your head examined,
Alan Grant, you certainly ought to have your head examined.'</p>

<p>'There is one part of my cranial equipment that is still in
admirable working order.'</p>

<p>'What is that?'</p>

<p>'My teeth.'</p>

<p>'You planning to chew something? That's no cure.'</p>

<p>'No. I plan to grit them.'</p>

<p>And whether it was because he had thumbed his nose at the devil
or whether it was that Bill Kenrick stood beside him all the way,
Grant made that journey in peace. Tad Cullen slumped into the seat
beside him and fell instantly asleep. Grant closed his eyes and let
the patterns form in his mind and dissolve and fade and form
anew.</p>

<p>Why had Bill Kenrick blacked himself all over?</p>

<p>Whom was he trying to fool?</p>

<p>Why had it been necessary to fool anyone?</p>

<p>As they were circling to land Tad woke up and without looking
out of the window began to pull up his tie and smooth his hair.
Apparently some sixth sense in a flyer's brain kept tally of speed,
distance and angle, even when he was unconscious.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Tad. 'Back to the lights of London and the old
Westmorland.'</p>

<p>'You don't have to go back to your hotel,' Grant said. 'I can
give you a bed.'</p>

<p>'That's very kind of you, Mr Grant, and I appreciate it. But I
don't have to put your wife&mdash;or&mdash;or whoever it
is&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My housekeeper.'</p>

<p>'I don't have to put your housekeeper about.' He slapped his
pocket. 'I'm loaded.'</p>

<p>'Even after&mdash;what was it?&mdash;a fortnight in Paris? I
congratulate you.'</p>

<p>'Oh, well. I don't think Paris is what it used to be. Or perhaps
it was just that I missed Bill. Anyhow, I don't need to fuss anyone
making beds for me, thanks all the same. And if you're going to be
busy you don't want me around. But you'll not shut me out of this
thing, will you? You'll keep me "with you", as Bill says. Said, I
mean.'</p>

<p>'I will indeed, Tad, I will indeed. I put a fly on a line in a
hotel in Oban and fished you out of the white population of the
world. I'm certainly not going to throw you back now.'</p>

<p>Tad grinned. 'I suppose you know what you're talking about. When
are you going to see this Lloyd guy?'</p>

<p>'This evening if he is at home. The worst of explorers is that
if they are not exploring they are lecturing; so he may be anywhere
between China and Peru. What startled you?'</p>

<p>'How did you know I was startled?'</p>

<p>'My dear Tad, your fresh and open countenance was never made for
either poker or diplomacy.'</p>

<p>'No, it was just that you chose two places that Bill always
chose. He used to say that, "From China to Peru".'</p>

<p>'He did? He seems to have known his Johnson.'</p>

<p>'Johnson?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Samuel Johnson. It's a quotation.'</p>

<p>'Oh. Oh, I see.' Tad looked faintly abashed.</p>

<p>'If you're still doubtful about me, Tad Cullen, you had better
come along the Embankment with me now and let some of my colleagues
vouch for me.'</p>

<p>Mr Cullen's fair skin went a deep red. 'I'm sorry. Just for a
moment there I&mdash;. It did sound as if you had known Bill.
You'll have to forgive me being suspicious, Mr Grant. I'm all at
sea, you know. I don't know a soul in this country. I just have to
take people as they come. On face value, I mean. Of <i>course</i>
I'm not doubtful about you. I'm too grateful to you to be able to
find words to describe how grateful I am. You have to believe
that.'</p>

<p>'Of course I believe it. I was only teasing you, and I had no
right to. It would be unintelligent of you not to be suspicious.
Here is my address and telephone number. I'll telephone you as soon
as I've seen Lloyd.'</p>

<p>'You don't think I should come with you, perhaps?'</p>

<p>'No. I think a deputation of two would be a little excessive for
so slight an occasion. What time will you be at the Westmorland
tonight to take a phone call?'</p>

<p>'Mr Grant, I'll be sitting with my hand on that thing until you
call.'</p>

<p>'Better eat some time. I'll call you at half-past eight.'</p>

<p>'Okay. Half-past eight.'</p>

<p>London was a misty grey with scarlet trimmings, and Grant looked
at it with affection. Army nurses used to have that rig-out; that
grey and scarlet. And in some ways London gave one the same sense
of grace and power that went with that Sister's uniform. The
dignity, the underlying kindness beneath the surface indifference,
the respect-worthiness that compensated for the lack of pretty
frills. He watched the red buses making the grey day beautiful, and
blessed them. What a happy thing it was that London buses should be
scarlet. In Scotland the buses were painted that most miserable of
all colours: blue. A colour so miserable that it was a synonym for
depression. But the English, God bless them, had had gayer
ideas.</p>

<p>He found Mrs Tinker turning out the spare bedroom. There was not
the slightest need for anyone to turn out the spare bedroom, but
Mrs Tinker obtained the same pleasure from turning out a room that
other people get from writing a symphony, or winning a cup at golf,
or swimming the Channel. She belonged to that numerous species once
succinctly described by Laura as 'the kind of woman who washes her
front doorstep every day and her own hair every six weeks'.</p>

<p>She came to the door of the spare bedroom when she heard the key
in the lock, and said: 'Well, now! And not a bite in the house! Why
didn't you let me know you was comin' back from foreign parts
before your time?'</p>

<p>'It's all right, Tink. I don't want a meal anyhow. I've just
looked in to leave my luggage. Get in something and leave it for me
when you go, so that there is something for me to eat tonight.'</p>

<p>Mrs Tinker went home every night, partly because she had to see
to the evening meal of someone she referred to as 'Tinker', and
partly because Grant had always liked to have the flat to himself
in the evenings. Grant had never seen 'Tinker', and Mrs Tinker's
only connection with him seemed to consist of this matter of an
evening meal and some marriage lines. Her real life and interest
was in 19 Tenby Court, S.W.1.</p>

<p>'Any telephones?' Grant asked, thumbing through the telephone
pad.</p>

<p>'Miss Hallard telephoned to say ring her up and dine with her as
soon as you were back.'</p>

<p>'Oh. Did the new play go well? What were the notices like?'</p>

<p>'Stinkers.'</p>

<p>'All of them?'</p>

<p>'Every one I seen, anyway.'</p>

<p>In the days of her freedom, before Tinker, Mrs Tinker had been a
theatre dresser. Indeed, if it had not been for this ritual of the
evening meal it was likely that she would still be dressing someone
each evening in W.1 or W.C.2 instead of turning out spare bedrooms
in S.W.1. Her interest in theatre matters was therefore that of an
initiate.</p>

<p>'Have you seen the play?'</p>

<p>'Not me. It's one of them plays what means something else. You
know. She keeps a china dog on the mantelpiece, but it isn't a
china dog at all, it's 'er ex-husband, and 'e breaks the dog, the
new boy-friend does, and she goes mad. Not <i>gets</i> mad, you
know; <i>goes</i> mad. 'Ighbrow. But I suppose if you want to be a
Dame you got to act 'ighbrow plays. What was you thinkin' of 'avin'
for your supper?'</p>

<p>'I wasn't thinking.'</p>

<p>'I could leave a nice bit of fish poachin' over some hot water
for you.'</p>

<p>'Not fish, if you love me. I've eaten enough fish in the last
month to last me a lifetime. As long as it isn't fish or mutton I
don't mind what it is.'</p>

<p>'Well, it's too late now to get any kidneys out of Mr Bridges,
but I'll see what I can do. You 'ad a good 'oliday?'</p>

<p>'A wonderful, wonderful holiday.'</p>

<p>'That's good. You bin and put on a little weight, I'm glad to
see. And you needn't slap your stomach in that doubtful way
neither. A little bit of weight never 'urt no one. It don't do to
be as thin as a rail. You don't 'ave no reserves.'</p>

<p>She hung around while Grant changed into his best town suit,
doling out bits of gossip as they happened to occur to her. Then he
shooed her back to her piece of self-indulgence with the spare
bedroom, dealt with the small businesses that had piled up in his
absence, and went out into the calm of the early April evening. He
went round to the garage, answered questions about his fishing,
listened to three fishing stories that he had listened to before he
set out for the Highlands a month ago, and reclaimed the little
two-seater that he used when on his own business.</p>

<p>Number 5 Britt Lane took some finding. In this huddle of old
houses all kinds of adaptation and conditioning had taken place.
Stables had become cottages, kitchen wings had become houses, odd
storeys had become maisonettes. Number 5 Britt Lane seemed to be
just a number on a gate. The gate was in a brick wall, and its
iron-studded oak seemed to Grant a little affected in so
unpretentious a stretch of ordinary London brick. However, it was
solid and in itself unexceptional, and it opened easily when asked
to. It opened on to what had been a kitchen yard when Number 5 had
been merely the back wing of a house in another street altogether.
Now the yard was a small paved court with a fountain playing in the
middle of it, and the one-time wing was a small flat stucco house
of three storeys, painted cream with green window-sashes. As Grant
crossed the little court to the doorway he noticed that the paving
was of tiles, some of them old and many of them beautiful. The
fountain too was beautiful. He mentally applauded Heron Lloyd for
not having replaced the plain London electric bell-push by some
more aesthetic piece of fancy-work; it augured a good taste that
the inappropriate gate had left open to question.</p>

<p>The interior of the house, too, had the Arab bareness and space
without any suggestion that a piece of the East had been
transported to London. Beyond the figure of the manservant who
answered his ring, he could see the clean walls and the rich
carpet; an idiom adapted, not a décor transposed. His respect for
Heron Lloyd mounted.</p>

<p>The manservant appeared to be Arab; an Arab of the towns,
plumpish, lively-eyed and good-mannered. He listened to Grant's
inquiry and asked in a gentle too-correct English if he had an
appointment. Grant said no, but that he would not detain Mr Lloyd
more than a moment. Mr Lloyd could be of some help in giving
information connected with Arabia.</p>

<p>'If you will come in, please, and wait for a moment, I ask.'</p>

<p>He ushered Grant into a tiny room just inside the front door
which, judging from its limited space and scanty furnishing, was
used for just this purpose of waiting. He supposed that someone
like Heron Lloyd must be used to strangers appearing on his
doorstep to claim his interest or help. Even perhaps just to ask
for his autograph. A realisation that made his own intrusion less
deplorable.</p>

<p>Mr Lloyd had not debated his desirability very long, it seemed,
for the man was back in a few moments.</p>

<p>'Will you come, please? Mr Lloyd will be very happy to see
you.'</p>

<p>A formula, but such a pleasant formula. How good manners did
cushion life, he thought as he followed the man up the narrow
stairs and into the big room that occupied the whole of the first
floor.</p>

<p>'Mr Grant, <i>hadji</i>,' said the man, standing aside to let
him come. Grant caught the word and thought: That is the first
piece of chi-chi: Englishmen don't make the pilgrimage to Mecca,
surely.</p>

<p>Watching Heron Lloyd as he was made welcome, Grant wondered
whether he had first thought of going to desert Arabia because he
looked like a desert Arab, or whether he had come to look like a
desert Arab after years in desert Arabia. Lloyd was the Arab of the
desert idealised to the nth. He was, Grant thought with amusement,
the Arab of the circulating libraries. It was across the saddle of
Arabs like Heron Lloyd that blameless matrons in the Crescents and
Drives and Avenues had been carried off to a fate worse than death.
The black eyes, the lean brown face, the white teeth, the whip-lash
body, the delicate hands, the graceful movements: it was all there,
straight out of Page Seventeen of Miss Tilly Tally's latest (two
hundred and fifty-four thousand, new printing next week). Grant had
to remind himself forcibly that he must not judge on looks.</p>

<p>For this man had done journeys that had made history in the
world of exploration, and had written about them in English which,
even if a little lush (Grant had bought a copy of his latest in
Scoone yesterday afternoon) was nevertheless recognisable as
literature. Heron Lloyd was no parlour sheik.</p>

<p>Lloyd was wearing orthodox London clothes and a manner to match.
If one had never heard of him one would accept him as a Londoner of
the well-to-do professional classes. One of the slightly more
flamboyant classes, perhaps; an actor, or conceivably a Harley
Street consultant or a Society photographer; but a Londoner of the
orthodox professions, when all was considered.</p>

<p>'Mr Grant,' he said, shaking hands. 'Mahmoud says that I can be
of service to you.'</p>

<p>His voice surprised Grant. It had no body and a faintly
querulous tone that had nothing to do with the sense of the words
or their mood. He took a box of cigarettes from the low coffee
table and offered them. He did not smoke himself, he said, because
he had adopted Mohammedan customs during his long life in the East,
but he could recommend the cigarettes if Grant cared to try
something that tasted a little out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>Grant took the cigarette, as he took every new experience and
sensation, with interest, and apologised for his intrusion. He
wanted to know whether a young man called Charles Martin had
applied to him at any time within the last year or so for
information about Arabia.</p>

<p>'Charles Martin? No. No, I don't think so. Many people do come,
of course, to see me about one thing and another. And I cannot
always remember their names afterwards. But I think I should
remember anyone with that simple name. You like that tobacco? I
know the very half-acre where it is grown. A beautiful place that
has not changed since Alexander the Macedonian passed that way.' He
smiled a little and added: 'Except, of course, that they have
learned how to grow this weed. The weed, I understand, goes very
well with a not too dry sherry. Another of the grosser indulgences
that I avoid; but I shall have a fruit drink to keep you
company.'</p>

<p>Grant thought that the desert tradition of hospitality to the
stranger must come a little expensive in a London where you were a
celebrity and all and sundry were free to drop in. He noticed that
the label on the bottle that Lloyd had picked up was a guarantee as
well as an announcement. It seemed that Lloyd was neither a pauper
nor a piker.</p>

<p>'Charles Martin was also known as Bill Kenrick,' he said.</p>

<p>Lloyd lowered the glass which he was about to fill, and
said:</p>

<p>'Kenrick! But he was here only the other day. Or rather, when I
say only the other day, I mean a week or two ago. Quite lately,
anyway. Why should he have an alias?'</p>

<p>'I don't know that myself. I am making inquiries about him on
behalf of his friend. He was due to meet his friend in Paris at the
beginning of March. On the 4th, to be exact. But he didn't turn up.
We have discovered that he died as the result of an accident on the
very day that he should have turned up in Paris.'</p>

<p>Lloyd put the glass slowly down on to the table.</p>

<p>'So <i>that</i> is why he did not come back,' he said in that
querulous voice that did not mean to be querulous. 'Poor boy. Poor
boy.'</p>

<p>'You had arranged to see him again?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I thought him charming and very intelligent. He was bitten
with the desert&mdash;but perhaps you know that. He had ideas about
exploring. A few young men still have. There are still the
adventurers, even in this hedged and garnished world. Of which one
must be glad. What happened to Kenrick? A car smash?'</p>

<p>'No. He had a fall on a train and fractured his skull.'</p>

<p>'Poor wretch. Poor wretch. A pity. I could have supplied the
jealous gods with a dozen more expendable in his place. An
atrocious word: expendable. The expression of an idea that would
not even have been conceivable a few years ago. So far have we
progressed towards our ultimate barbarism. Why did you want to know
if the Kenrick boy had come to see me?'</p>

<p>'We wanted to pick up his trail. When he died he was
masquerading as Charles Martin, with a complete set of Charles
Martin's papers. We want to know at what stage he began to be
Charles Martin. We were almost certain that, being bitten by the
desert, he would come to see some authority on the subject in
London, and since you, sir, are the ultimate authority we began
with you.'</p>

<p>'I see. Well, it was most certainly as Kenrick, Bill Kenrick I
think, that he came to see me. A dark young man, very attractive.
Tough, too, in a nice way. I mean, good manners covering unknown
possibilities. I found him delightful.'</p>

<p>'Had he come to you with any definite plans? I mean, with a
specific proposition?'</p>

<p>Lloyd smiled a little. 'He came to me with one of the commonest
of all the propositions that are habitually put to me. An
expedition to the site of Wabar. Do you know about Wabar? It is the
fabled city of Arabia. It is Arabia's "cities of the plain". How
that pattern does repeat itself in legend. The human race feels
eternally guilty when it is happy. We cannot even remark on our
good health without touching wood or crossing our fingers or
otherwise averting the gods' anger at mortal well-being. So Arabia
has its Wabar: the city that was destroyed by fire because of its
wealth and its sins.'</p>

<p>'And Kenrick thought that he had discovered the site.'</p>

<p>'He was sure of it. Poor boy, I hope that I was not
short-tempered with him.'</p>

<p>'You think that he was wrong, then?'</p>

<p>'Mr Grant, the legend of Wabar exists from the Red Sea clear
across Arabia to the Persian Gulf, and for almost every mile of
that distance there is a different alleged site for the city.'</p>

<p>'And you don't believe that perhaps someone might stumble on it
by accident?'</p>

<p>'By accident?'</p>

<p>'Kenrick was a flyer. It is possible that he saw the place when
blown off his course, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'Had he talked to his friend about it then?'</p>

<p>'No. He had talked to no one that I know of. That was my own
deduction. What is to hinder the discovery being made that
way?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, of course, nothing; if the place exists at all. I have
said: it is a legend almost universal throughout the world. But
where stories of ruins have been tracked to their source the
"ruins" have always proved to be something else. Natural rock
formation, mirage, cloud-formation even. I think what poor Kenrick
saw was the crater of a meteor. I have seen the place myself. A
predecessor of mine discovered it when he was looking for Wabar. It
is unbelievably like a place made with hands. The thrown-up earth
makes pinnacles and jagged ruinous-looking heights. I think I have
a photograph somewhere. You might like to see it: it is a unique
affair.' He got up and slid back a panel in the bare painted-wood
wall, disclosing shelves of books all the way from floor to
ceiling. 'It is, perhaps mercifully, not every day a meteor of any
size falls on the earth.'</p>

<p>He picked a photograph album from one of the lower shelves, and
came back across the room looking for the place in the collection.
And Grant was seized without warning by a strange sense of
familiarity; a feeling of having met Lloyd somewhere before.</p>

<p>He looked at the photograph that Lloyd laid before him. It was
certainly an uncanny thing. An almost mocking pastiche of human
achievement. But his mind was busy with that odd moment of
recognition.</p>

<p>Was it just that he had seen Heron Lloyd's photograph somewhere?
But if it had been that, if he had merely seen Lloyd's face as
adjunct to some description of his exploits, then the sense of
recognition would have come when he had first walked into the room
and seen him. It was not so much a recognition as a sense of having
known Lloyd somewhere else. In some other surroundings.</p>

<p>'You see?' Lloyd was saying. 'Even on the ground, one has to go
close up to it before one can be sure that the thing is not a
collection of human dwellings. How much more misleading it must be
from the air.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' agreed Grant, and did not believe it. For one very good
reason. From the air the crater would have been plainly visible.
From the air it would have looked exactly what it was: a circular
hollow surrounded by the thrown-up earth. But he was not going to
say that to Lloyd. Let Lloyd talk. He was growing very interested
in Lloyd.</p>

<p>'That lies very close to the Kenrick boy's route across the
desert, as described by himself, and I think that that is what he
saw.'</p>

<p>'Did he pin-point the place, do you know?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. I didn't ask him. But I should think he would. He
struck me as being a very efficient and intelligent young man.'</p>

<p>'You didn't ask him for details?'</p>

<p>'If someone told you, Mr Grant, that he had discovered a holly
tree growing in the middle of Piccadilly immediately opposite the
In and Out, would you be interested? Or would you just think that
you must be patient with him? I know the Empty Quarter as well as
you know Piccadilly.'</p>

<p>'Yes, of course. Then it was not you who saw him off at the
station?'</p>

<p>'Mr Grant, I never see <i>anyone</i> off. A combination of
masochism and sadism that I have always deplored. Off where, by the
way?'</p>

<p>'To Scoone.'</p>

<p>'To the Highlands? I understood that he was longing for some
gaiety. Why was he going to the Highlands?'</p>

<p>'We don't know. That is one of the things we are most anxious to
find out. He said nothing to you that might provide a clue?'</p>

<p>'No. He did suggest finding other backing. I mean, when I had
proved a broken reed. Perhaps he had found a backer, or hoped to
find a backer, who lives up there. I can't think of any obvious one
off-hand. There is Kinsey-Hewitt, of course. He has Scottish
connections. But I think he is in Arabia at the moment.'</p>

<p>Well, at least Lloyd had provided the first reasonable
explanation of the flying visit north with an overnight case. To
talk to a possible backer. He had found a backer at the last
moment, when he was almost due to meet Tad Cullen in Paris, and had
dashed north to see him. That fitted beautifully. They were getting
on. But why as Charles Martin?</p>

<p>As if the thought had been transferred, Lloyd said: 'By the way,
if the Kenrick boy was travelling as Charles Martin, how has he
been identified as Kenrick?'</p>

<p>'I travelled on that train to Scoone. I saw him when he was
dead, and grew interested in some verse he had been
scribbling.'</p>

<p>'Scribbling? On what?'</p>

<p>'On a blank bit of an evening paper,' Grant said, wondering why
it should matter what Kenrick had been writing on.</p>

<p>'Oh.'</p>

<p>'I was on holiday, with nothing else to do, so I amused myself
with the clues provided.'</p>

<p>'You played detective.'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'What is your profession, Mr Grant?'</p>

<p>'I'm a Civil Servant.'</p>

<p>'Ah. I was going to suggest the Army.' He smiled a little and
picked up Grant's glass to refill it. 'The more rarefied ranks, of
course.'</p>

<p>'G.S.O. 1?'</p>

<p>'No. An attaché, I think. Or Intelligence.'</p>

<p>'I have done a spot of Intelligence during my Army career.'</p>

<p>'So that is where you developed your taste for it. May I say,
your flair.'</p>

<p>'Thank you.'</p>

<p>'It was no ordinary talent that identified Charles Martin as
Bill Kenrick. Or had he Kenrick belongings that made the
identification easy?'</p>

<p>'No. He was buried as Charles Martin.'</p>

<p>Lloyd paused as he was setting the filled glass down and said:
'That is so typical of that careless Scottish way of dealing with
sudden death. They are always very smug about their lack of
inquests. Myself, I think Scotland must be an ideal place in which
to get away with murder. If ever I plan one, I shall lure my victim
north of the Border.'</p>

<p>'There was an inquest, as it happens. The accident took place
shortly after the train left Euston.'</p>

<p>'Oh.' Lloyd thought this over and then said: 'Don't you think
that this should be reported to the police? I mean the fact that
they have buried someone under a wrong name.'</p>

<p>Grant was about to say: 'The only proof we have that the dead
Charles Martin was Kenrick is my identification of a not very good
snapshot.' But something stopped him. Instead he said: 'We should
like first to know why he had Charles Martin's papers.'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes. I see. That of course is a sufficiently questionable
matter. One doesn't acquire a man's papers without
some&mdash;preliminaries. Does anyone know who Charles Martin
is&mdash;or was?'</p>

<p>'Yes. The police were satisfied on that score. There was no
mystery.'</p>

<p>'The only mystery is how Kenrick came by his papers. I see why
you are reluctant to go to official sources. What about this man
who saw him off? At Euston. Could he have been Charles Martin?'</p>

<p>'He could, I suppose.'</p>

<p>'The papers may merely have been lent. Kenrick somehow did not
strike me as a&mdash;shall we say, nefarious type.'</p>

<p>'No. On all the evidence, he wasn't.'</p>

<p>'It's a very curious business altogether. This accident that you
say he had: I suppose there is no doubt that it was an accident? No
suggestion of a quarrel?'</p>

<p>'No, it was just one of those things. A fall that might happen
to anyone.'</p>

<p>'Distressing. As I say, there are too few young men nowadays who
have the combination of courage and intelligence. A great many come
to me, indeed they travel great distances to see me&mdash;'</p>

<p>He went on talking, and Grant sat watching and listening.</p>

<p>Were there, in fact, so many who came? Lloyd seemed very pleased
to sit and talk to a stranger. There was no suggestion that he had
an engagement for the evening or guests coming to dinner. None of
the convenient pauses that a host leaves in the conversation so
that a casual guest may take his leave. Lloyd sat talking in that
thin, fanatic's voice and admiring the hands that lay in his lap.
He continually changed the position of the hands, not as a gesture
to emphasise a phrase, but as one making a new arrangement of some
decoration. Grant found this Narcissus-like preoccupation
fascinating. He listened to the silence of the little house, shut
away from the town and its traffic. In that biography in <i>Who's
Who</i> there had been no mention of wife or children; possessions
that the owners of both are habitually proud to mention; so the
household no doubt consisted of Lloyd and his servants. Had he
sufficient interests to compensate for that lack of human
companionship?</p>

<p>He, Alan Grant, had a household just as bare of human warmth;
but his life was so full of people that to come back to his empty
flat was a luxury, a spiritual delight. Was Heron Lloyd's life full
and satisfying?</p>

<p>Or did your true Narcissus ever need any company other than his
own image?</p>

<p>He wondered how old the man was. Older than he seemed,
certainly; he was the doyen of Arabian exploration. Fifty-five or
more. Probably nearer sixty. He had not given his date of birth in
that biography, so the chances were that he was nearly sixty. There
could not be many years of hard-living left to him, even given his
good physique and condition. What would he do with the remaining
years? Spend them admiring his hands?</p>

<p>'The only true democracy in the world today,' Lloyd was saying,
'and it is being destroyed by the thing that we call
civilisation.'</p>

<p>And again Grant had that sense of familiarity, of recognition.
Was it that he had met Lloyd before? Or was it that Lloyd reminded
him of someone?</p>

<p>If so, of whom?</p>

<p>He must get away and think about this. It was time that he took
his leave anyhow.</p>

<p>'Did Kenrick tell you where he was staying?' he asked as he
began to take his leave.</p>

<p>'No. We made no definite appointment to meet again, you
understand. I asked him to come to see me again before he left
London. When he did not come I believed that he was resentful,
perhaps angry, at my lack of&mdash;sympathy, shall we say?'</p>

<p>'Yes, it must have been a blow to him. Well, I have taken up a
great deal of your time, and you have been very forbearing. I am
most grateful.'</p>

<p>'I am very glad to have been of help. I am afraid it has not
been very valuable help. If there is anything else that I can do in
the matter I hope very much that you will not hesitate to call on
me.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;there is one thing, but you have already been so
kind that I hate to ask you. Especially since it is a little
irrelevant.'</p>

<p>'What is it?'</p>

<p>'May I perhaps borrow the photograph?'</p>

<p>'The photograph?'</p>

<p>'The photograph of the meteor crater. I notice that the print is
slotted into your album, not pasted. I should like very much to
show it to Kenrick's friend. I promise faithfully to return it. And
in perfect&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But of course you may have the photograph. And don't bother to
return it. I took the picture myself, and the negative is filed in
the proper place. I can replace the print at any time with
ease.'</p>

<p>He manoeuvred the print from its anchorage in the album, and
handed it to Grant. He came downstairs with Grant and saw him to
the door, talked a little about the little courtyard when Grant
admired it, and waited courteously until Grant had reached the gate
before closing the door on him.</p>

<p>Grant opened the evening paper that was lying on the car
cushions and laid the photograph carefully between its folds. Then
he drove down to the river and along the Embankment.</p>

<p>The old place looked very much as usual, he thought, as the
hideous pile loomed up in the dusk. And so, too, did the
finger-print department once he got there. Cartwright was stubbing
out a cigarette in the saucer of a half-drunk cup of cold tea and
admiring his latest handiwork: a complete set of left-hand
prints.</p>

<p>'Lovely, 'm?' he said, looking up as Grant's shadow fell across
him. 'These are going to hang Pinky Mason.'</p>

<p>'Hadn't Pinky the price of a pair of gloves?'</p>

<p>'Huh! Pinky could have bought up Dents. He just couldn't
believe, clever little man Pinky, that the police would ever get
round to thinking it anything but a suicide. Gloves are for
small-time trash: burglars and such; not for master-minds like
Pinky. You been away?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I've been fishing in the Highlands. If you're not too busy
could you do something off the cuff for me?'</p>

<p>'Now?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no. Tomorrow would do.'</p>

<p>Cartwright looked at the clock. 'I've nothing to do till I meet
my wife at the theatre. We're going to Marta Hallard's new play. So
I can do it now, if you like. Is it a difficult job?'</p>

<p>'No. Dead easy. Just here, in the lower right-hand corner of
this photograph, there is a beautiful thumb-print. And at the back
I think you'll find a nice set of finger-tips. I want to check them
with the files.'</p>

<p>'All right. Will you wait?'</p>

<p>'I'm going to the library. I'll come back.'</p>

<p>In the library he took down <i>Who's Who</i>, and looked up
Kinsey-Hewitt. The paragraph on Kinsey-Hewitt was a very modest
little affair compared with the half-column on Heron Lloyd. He was
a much younger man, it seemed; married, with two children; and his
address was a London one. The 'Scottish connection' that Lloyd had
mentioned seemed to consist in the fact that he was the younger son
of some Kinsey-Hewitt who had a place in Fife.</p>

<p>Well, there was always the chance that he was now, or had been
lately, in Scotland. Grant went to a telephone and called the
London address. A woman with a pleasant voice answered, and said
that her husband was not at home. No, he would not be at home for
some time; he was in Arabia. He had been in Arabia since November
and was not expected back until May at the earliest. Grant thanked
her and hung up. It had not been to Kinsey-Hewitt that Bill Kenrick
had gone. Tomorrow, he would have to go through the various
authorities on Arabia, one by one, and ask them the question.</p>

<p>He went back, after some coffee-housing with such friends as he
happened to run into at that hour, to Cartwright.</p>

<p>'Got the photograph or am I too early?'</p>

<p>'I've not only got it but looked it up for you. The answer is
no.'</p>

<p>'No, I didn't really think there would be anything. I was just
clearing decks. But thank you, all the same. I'll take the print
with me. I thought the new Hallard show got awful notices.'</p>

<p>'Did it? I never read 'em. Neither does Beryl. She just likes
Marta Hallard. So do I, if it comes to that. Nice long legs. Good
night.'</p>

<p>'Good night, and thanks again.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">YOU don't seem awfully sweet on this guy,' Tad
Cullen said, when Grant had finished this story over the
telephone.</p>

<p>'Don't I? Oh, well, perhaps it's just that he doesn't happen to
be what we call my cup of tea. Look, Tad, you're quite sure that
you have no idea, even in the back of your mind, where Bill could
have been staying?'</p>

<p>'I haven't got a back to my mind. I have just a small, narrow
space in front where I keep all that's useful to me. A few
telephone numbers, and a prayer or two.'</p>

<p>'Well, tomorrow I'd like you to do the round of the more obvious
places, if you would.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sure. I'll do anything. Anything you say.'</p>

<p>'All right. Have you got a pen? Here's the list.'</p>

<p>Grant gave him the names of twenty of the more likely places,
going on the assumption that a young man from the wide open spaces
and the small towns would look for a caravanserai that was both
large and gay and not too expensive. And just for good measure he
added a couple of the best-known expensive ones; young men with
several months' back-pay were liable to be extravagant.</p>

<p>'I don't think I'd bother with any more than that,' he said.</p>

<p>'<i>Are</i> there any more?'</p>

<p>'If he didn't stay in one of these, then we're sunk, because if
he didn't stay in any of them we'd have to hunt every hotel in
London to find him, to say nothing of the boarding-houses.'</p>

<p>'Okay. I'll start first thing in the morning. Mr Grant, I'd like
to tell you how much I appreciate what you're doing for me. Giving
up your time to something that no one else could do; I mean,
something the police wouldn't touch. If it wasn't for
you&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Listen, Tad. I'm not being benevolent. I'm being self-indulgent
and typically nosey and I'm enjoying myself to the top of my bent.
If I wasn't, believe me I wouldn't be in London. I'd be going to
sleep tonight in Clune. So good night and sleep well. We'll crack
this thing between us.'</p>

<p>He hung up and went to see what Mrs Tinker had left on the
stove. It seemed to be a sort of shepherd's pie. He carried it into
the living-room and ate it absent-mindedly, his thoughts still on
Lloyd.</p>

<p>What was familiar about Lloyd?</p>

<p>He went back in his mind over the few moments before his first
feeling of recognition. What had Lloyd been doing? Pulling open the
panel of the book cupboard. Pulling it open with a gesture
self-consciously graceful; faintly exhibitionist. What was there in
that to provoke a sense of familiarity?</p>

<p>And there was something even more curious.</p>

<p>Why had Lloyd said 'On what?' when he had mentioned Kenrick's
scribbling?</p>

<p>That, surely, was a most unnatural reaction.</p>

<p>What exactly had he said to Lloyd? He had said that he became
interested in Kenrick because of some verses he had been
scribbling. The normal come-back to that was surely: 'Verses?' The
operative word in the sentence was verses. That he was scribbling
was entirely by the way.</p>

<p>And that anyone's reaction to the information should be to say
'On what?' was inexplicable.</p>

<p>Except that no human reaction was inexplicable.</p>

<p>It was Grant's experience that it was the irrelevant, the
unconsidered words in a statement that were important. Quite
surprising and gratifying revelations lay in the gap between an
assertion and a non-sequitur.</p>

<p>Why had Lloyd said 'On what?'</p>

<p>He took the problem to bed with him, and fell asleep with
it.</p>

<p>In the morning he began his hunt through the authorities on
Arabia, and finished it not at all astonished that it had produced
no result. People who explored Arabia as a hobby very seldom had
money to back anything. They were, on the contrary, usually
prospecting for backing themselves. The only chance had been that
some one of them had proved interested to the point of being
willing to share his backing. But none of them had ever heard of
either Charles Martin or Bill Kenrick.</p>

<p>It was lunch-time before he finished, and he stood by the window
waiting for Tad's call and wondering whether to go out to luncheon
or to let Mrs Tinker make him an omelette. It was another grey day
but there was a slight breeze and a smell of damp earth that was
queerly countrified. A fine fishing day, he noted. He wished for a
moment that he was walking down over the moor to the river instead
of wrestling with the London telephone system. It wouldn't even
have to be the river. He would settle for an afternoon on Lochan
Dhu in a leaky boat with Pat for company.</p>

<p>He turned to his desk and began to clear up the mess of this
morning's opened mail. He had stooped to throw the torn pages and
the empty envelopes into the waste-paper basket, but he stopped
with the action half spent.</p>

<p>It had come to him.</p>

<p>He knew now who it was that Heron Lloyd reminded him of.</p>

<p>It was Wee Archie.</p>

<p>This was so unexpected and so ridiculous that he sat down on the
chair by his desk and began to laugh.</p>

<p>What had Wee Archie in common with that elegant and
sophisticated creature who was Heron Lloyd?</p>

<p>Frustration? Of a surety not. The fact that he was an Auslander
in the country of his devotion? No; too far-fetched. It was
something nearer home than that.</p>

<p>For it <i>was</i> of Wee Archie that Lloyd had reminded him. He
had no doubt of that now. He was experiencing that inimitable
relief that comes when one has remembered a name that has eluded
one.</p>

<p>Yes, it was Wee Archie.</p>

<p>But why?</p>

<p>What had that incongruous pair in common?</p>

<p>Their gestures? No. Their physique? No. Their voices? Was that
it?</p>

<p>'Their vanity, you fool!' said that inner voice in him.</p>

<p>Yes; that was it. Their vanity. Their pathological vanity.</p>

<p>He sat very still, considering this; not amused any longer.</p>

<p>Vanity. The first requisite in wrong-doing. The constant factor
in the criminal mind.</p>

<p>Just supposing that&mdash;</p>

<p>The telephone at his elbow gave its sudden purr.</p>

<p>It was Tad. He had reached number eighteen, he said, and was now
an old old man but the blood of pioneers was in his veins and he
was pursuing the search.</p>

<p>'Drop it for a little and come and eat with me somewhere.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I've had my lunch. I had a coupla bananas and a milk shake
in Leicester Square.'</p>

<p>'Merciful Heaven!' said Grant.</p>

<p>'What's the matter with that?'</p>

<p>'Starch; that's what's the matter with it.'</p>

<p>'A little starch is fine when you're ironed out. No luck your
end?'</p>

<p>'No. If it was a backer he was going North to see, then the
backer was merely some amateur who had money; not anyone actively
engaged in Arabian exploration.'</p>

<p>'Oh. Well. I'll be on my way. When shall I ring you next?'</p>

<p>'As soon as you come to the end of the list. I'll wait here for
your call.'</p>

<p>Grant decided to have the omelette, and while Mrs Tinker
prepared it he walked about his living-room letting his mind soar
into speculation and pulling it down instantly to a common-sense
level, so that it behaved like telegraph lines outside a railway
compartment; continually soaring and continually caught back.</p>

<p>If only they had a starting-point. What if Tad came to the end
of the likely hotels and still drew a blank? It was only a matter
of days before he would have to go back to work. He stopped
speculating on vanity and its possibilities and began to reckon how
long it would take Tad to cover the remaining four hotels.</p>

<p>But before his omelette was half finished Tad arrived in person.
He was flushed and triumphant.</p>

<p>'I don't know how you ever thought of that dull little dump in
connection with Bill,' he said, 'but you were right. That's where
he stayed all right.'</p>

<p>'And which is the dull little dump?'</p>

<p>'The Pentland. How did you think of that one?'</p>

<p>'It has an international reputation.'</p>

<p>'<i>That</i> one has?'</p>

<p>'And English people go on going to it generation after
generation.'</p>

<p>'That's what it looks like!'</p>

<p>'So that is where Bill Kenrick stayed. I like him more than
ever.'</p>

<p>'Yeah,' Tad said more quietly. And the flush of triumph died
away. 'I wish you'd known Bill. I sure wish you'd known him. They
don't come any better than Bill.'</p>

<p>'Sit down and have some coffee to settle your milk shake. Or
would you like a drink?'</p>

<p>'No, thanks, I'll have coffee. It actually smells like coffee,'
he added in a surprised way. 'Bill checked out on the 3rd. The 3rd
of March.'</p>

<p>'Did you ask about his luggage?'</p>

<p>'Sure. They weren't all that interested at first. But eventually
they got out a ledger the size of the Judgement Book and said that
Mr Kenrick had left nothing either in the box-room or the
safe.'</p>

<p>'That means that he took them to a cloak-room&mdash;to a
left-luggage office, that is&mdash;to be ready to his hand when he
came back from Scotland. If he meant to fly when he came back, then
I suppose he would leave them at Euston to be picked up on his way
to the airport. If he meant to go by sea, then he may have taken
them to Victoria before going to Euston. Did he like the sea?'</p>

<p>'So-so. He wasn't daffy about it. But he had a mania for
ferries.'</p>

<p>'Ferries?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Seems it began when he was a kid at a place called
Pompey&mdash;know where that is?' Grant nodded. 'And he spent all
his time on a penny ferry.'</p>

<p>'A ha'penny one, it used to be.'</p>

<p>'Well, anyway.'</p>

<p>'So the train-ferry might have had an interest for him, you
think. Well, we can but try. But if he was going to be late in
meeting you, I should think he would fly over. Would you know the
cases if you saw them?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes. Bill and I shared a Company bungalow. I helped pack
them. In fact one of them's mine, if it comes to that. He just took
the two of them. He said if we bought many things we could buy a
suitcase to&mdash;' Tad's voice died away suddenly and he buried
his face in his coffee cup. It was a great flat bowl of a cup,
willow-patterned in pink, which Marta Hallard had brought back from
Sweden for Grant because he liked his coffee out of large cups; and
it made a very good screen for emotion.</p>

<p>'We have no ticket to recover them with, you see. And I can't
use any official means. But I know most of the men on duty at the
big terminuses, and can probably wangle our way behind the scenes.
It will be up to you to spot the cases. Was Bill a labeller by
nature, would you say?'</p>

<p>'I expect he'd label things he was going to leave behind like
that. Why, do you think, did he not have the left-luggage ticket in
his pocket-book?'</p>

<p>'I did think that someone else may have deposited those cases
for him. The person who saw him off at Euston, for instance.'</p>

<p>'The Martin guy?'</p>

<p>'It might be. If he had borrowed papers for this odd masquerade,
he would have to return them. Perhaps Martin was going to meet him
at the airport, or at Victoria, or wherever it was that he had
planned to leave England from, with the cases and collect his own
papers.'</p>

<p>'Yeah. That makes sense. I suppose we couldn't Agony-advertise
for this Martin?'</p>

<p>'I don't think that this Martin would be very willing to answer,
having lent his papers for a piece of sharp practice and being now
without identity.'</p>

<p>'No. Perhaps you're right. He wasn't anyone who was staying at
that hotel, anyway.'</p>

<p>'How do you know that?' asked Grant, surprised.</p>

<p>'I looked through the book: the register. When I was identifying
Bill's signature.'</p>

<p>'You're wasted in OCAL, Tad. You should come to us.'</p>

<p>But Tad was not listening. 'You've no idea what a queer feeling
it was to see Bill's writing suddenly like that, among all those
strange names. It sort of stopped my breath.'</p>

<p>Grant took Lloyd's picture of the crater 'ruins' from his desk
and brought it over to the table. 'That is what Heron Lloyd thinks
that Bill saw.'</p>

<p>Tad looked at it with interest. 'It sure is queer, isn't it?
Just like ruined sky-scrapers. You know, until I saw Arabia I
thought the United States invented sky-scrapers. But some of those
old Arab towns are just the Empire State on a smaller scale. But
you say it couldn't have been this that Bill saw.'</p>

<p>'No. From the air it must be quite obvious what it is.'</p>

<p>'Did you tell Lloyd that?'</p>

<p>'No. I just let him talk.'</p>

<p>'Why do you dislike the guy so much?'</p>

<p>'I didn't say that I disliked him.'</p>

<p>'You don't have to.'</p>

<p>Grant hesitated; analysing, as always, just exactly what he did
feel.</p>

<p>'I find vanity repellent. As a person I loathe it, and as a
policeman I distrust it.'</p>

<p>'It's a harmless sort of weakness,' Tad said, with a tolerant
lift of a shoulder.</p>

<p>'That is just where you are wrong. It is <i>the</i> utterly
destructive quality. When you say vanity, you are thinking of the
kind that admires itself in mirrors and buys things to deck itself
out in. But that is merely personal conceit. Real vanity is
something quite different. A matter not of person but of
personality. Vanity says "I must have this because I am me". It is
a frightening thing because it is incurable. You can never convince
Vanity that anyone else is of the slightest importance; he just
doesn't understand what you are talking about. He will kill a
person rather than be put to the inconvenience of doing a six
months' stretch.'</p>

<p>'But that's being insane.'</p>

<p>'Not according to Vanity's reckoning. And certainly not in the
medical sense. It is merely Vanity being logical. It is, as I said,
a frightening trait; and the basis of all criminal personality.
Criminals&mdash;true criminals, as opposed to the little man who
cooks the accounts in an emergency or the man who kills his wife
when he finds her in bed with a stranger&mdash;true criminals vary
in looks and tastes and intelligence and method as widely as the
rest of the world does, but they have one invariable
characteristic: their pathological vanity.'</p>

<p>Tad looked as though he were only half-listening because he was
using this information on some private reference of his own.
'Listen, Mr Grant,' he said, 'are you saying that this guy Lloyd
isn't to be trusted?'</p>

<p>Grant thought that over.</p>

<p>'I wish I knew,' he said at last. 'I wish I knew.'</p>

<p>'We-e-ll!' said Tad. 'That sure puts a different look on things,
don't it!'</p>

<p>'I've spent quite a long time this morning wondering whether I
have seen so much of the vanity in criminals that I have begun to
have a "thing" about it; to distrust it unduly. On the face of it
Heron Lloyd is irreproachable. He is more: he is admirable. He has
a fine record behind him; he lives simply; he has excellent taste,
which means a natural sense of proportion; and he has achieved
enough surely to satisfy the most egotistical soul.'</p>

<p>'But you think&mdash;there's something wrong somewhere.'</p>

<p>'Do you remember a little man in the hotel at Moymore who did
missionary work on you?'</p>

<p>'Persecuted Scotland! The little man in kilts.'</p>

<p>'A kilt,' said Grant automatically. 'Well, for some reason Lloyd
gives me the same feeling as Archie Brown. It's absurd, but it is
very strong. They have the same&mdash;' He looked for a word.</p>

<p>'Smell,' said Tad.</p>

<p>'Yes. That's about it. They have the same smell.'</p>

<p>After a long silence Tad said: 'Mr Grant, are you still of the
opinion that what happened to Bill was an accident?'</p>

<p>'Yes, because there is no evidence to the contrary. But I'm
quite prepared to believe that it wasn't, if I can see any reason
for it. Can you clean windows?'</p>

<p>'Can I what?'</p>

<p>'Clean windows.'</p>

<p>'I could make a shot at it if really pushed, I suppose,' Tad
said, staring. 'Why?'</p>

<p>'You may have to before this is over. Let us go and collect
those suitcases. I'm hoping that all the information we want will
be in those cases. I've just remembered that Bill booked that berth
to Scoone a week in advance.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps his backer in Scotland couldn't see him until the
4th.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps. Anyhow, all his papers and personal things will be in
one of the cases, and I'm hoping that it will include a diary.'</p>

<p>'Bill wouldn't keep a diary!'</p>

<p>'Not that kind. The Meet-Jack-1.15-Call-For-Toots-7.30
kind.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, that. Yes, I expect he'd have one of those if he was
going touting round London for backing. Brother, that may be all we
need!'</p>

<p>'That <i>will</i> be all we need. If it is there.'</p>

<p>But nothing was there.</p>

<p>Nothing at all.</p>

<p>They began light-heartedly with the obvious places: Euston, the
airport, Victoria; pleased with the formula that worked so
well.</p>

<p>'Hullo, Inspector. What can I do for you today?'</p>

<p>'Well, you might be able to help my young friend from
America.'</p>

<p>'Yes? One for the three-thirty?'</p>

<p>'We've got one for the three-thirty. He wants to know whether
his buddy left a couple of suitcases here. Do you mind if he has a
look round? We don't want to move anything. Just to look.'</p>

<p>'Well, that's something that's still free in this country,
Inspector, believe it or not. Come behind, will you?'</p>

<p>So they came behind. Each time they came behind. And each time
the tiered luggage looked back at them, contemptuous and withdrawn.
As detached as only other people's belongings can look.</p>

<p>From the likely places they moved on to the mere possibles,
sobered and apprehensive. They had hoped for a diary, for personal
papers. Now they would settle for even a sight of those
suitcases.</p>

<p>But there were no familiar cases on any of the shelves.</p>

<p>This so staggered Tad that Grant had difficulty in dragging him
away from the later ports-of-call. He went round and round the
filled racks in an unbelieving daze.</p>

<p>'They must be here,' he kept saying. 'They must be here.'</p>

<p>But they were not there.</p>

<p>As they came out on to the street, baffled, after their last bet
had gone down the drain, he said: 'Inspector, I mean Mr Grant,
where else is there that you would leave luggage after checking out
of a hotel? Have you those personal lock-up places?'</p>

<p>'Only limited-period ones. For people who want to park a case
for an hour or two while they do something.'</p>

<p>'Well, where <i>are</i> Bill's things, why aren't they in any of
the obvious places?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. They may be with his girl.'</p>

<p>'What girl?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. He was young, and handsome, and celibate; he
would have a fairly wide choice.'</p>

<p>'Yes, of course. That's maybe what he did with them. Which
reminds me.' His face lost its discontented, purposeless look. He
glanced at his watch. It was nearly dinner-time. 'I've got a date
with that girl in the milk-bar.' He caught Grant's eye and looked
faintly abashed. 'But I'll stand her up if you think I can be any
good to you.'</p>

<p>Grant sent him away to meet his milk-bar sweetie with a slight
sense of relief. It was rather like having a mournful puppy around.
He himself decided to postpone dinner for a little and go and see
some of his Metropolitan friends.</p>

<p>He dropped into the Astwick Street Police Station and was
greeted with the identical phrase that he had been listening to all
the afternoon and evening: 'Hullo, Inspector, what can we do for
you?'</p>

<p>Grant said that they might tell him who was on the Britt Lane
beat just now.</p>

<p>The man on the beat was P.C. Bithel, it seemed; and if the
Inspector wanted to see him he was at this moment in the canteen
having sausage-and-mash. His number was 30.</p>

<p>Grant found Number Thirty at a table by himself at the far end
of the room. A French grammar was propped up in front of him.
Looking at him, sitting there unaware, Grant thought how London
policemen had changed in type in the short space of a
quarter-century. He himself, he knew, was a departure from type; a
fact that had been of great use to him on various occasions. P.C.
Bithel was a dark, slight boy from County Down with a matt sallow
skin and a kind reassuring drawl. Between the French grammar and
the drawl, Grant felt that P.C. Bithel was headed for great
things.</p>

<p>The boy began to get up when Grant had introduced himself, but
Grant sat down and said: 'There's one small thing you might do for
me. I'd like to know who cleans the windows of 5 Britt Lane. You
might make a few inquiries when&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mr Lloyd's place?' the boy said. 'Richards does them.'</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, and indeed P.C. Bithel had a future; he must keep
his eye on P.C. Bithel.</p>

<p>'How do you know that?'</p>

<p>'I pass the time of day with him here and there on my beat. He
stables his barrow and things in that mews further along Britt
Lane.'</p>

<p>He thanked the budding Superintendent and went away to find
Richards. Richards, it seemed, lived above his barrow. He was a
bachelor ex-serviceman with a short leg, a cat, a collection of
china mugs, and a passion for darts. There was nothing that P.C.
Bithel, not long from County Down, did not know about his London
beat.</p>

<p>At the corner of Britt Lane was the Sun, where Richards played
darts, and it was to the Sun that Grant went. This was to be an
altogether informal arrangement and it demanded an informal
launching. He did not know the Sun or its proprietor, but he had
only to sit still and behave himself and presently he would be
invited to play darts, and from that to having a quiet one with
Richards was only a step.</p>

<p>It was a step that took a couple of hours, as it turned out; but
eventually he had Richards to himself in a corner with a pint. He
was debating with himself whether to produce his card and use his
official credentials for unofficial business, or to make it an
affair of one ex-serviceman obliging another for a small
consideration, when Richards said:</p>

<p>'You don't seem to have put on any weight with the years,
sir.'</p>

<p>'Have I met you somewhere?' Grant asked, a little annoyed that
he should have forgotten a face.</p>

<p>'Camberley. More years ago than I like to think about. And you
needn't worry about forgetting me,' he added, 'because I doubt if
you ever saw me. I was a cook. You still in the Army?'</p>

<p>'No, I'm a policeman.'</p>

<p>'No kidding! Well, well. I'd have said you were a dead cert for
C.I.G.S. I see now why you were so anxious to get me into a corner.
And me thinking it was my way with a dart that won you!'</p>

<p>Grant laughed. 'Yes, you can do something for me, but it isn't
official business. Would you take a pupil tomorrow for a small
consideration?'</p>

<p>'To do any special windows?' Richards asked, after a moment's
thought.</p>

<p>'Number 5 Britt Lane.'</p>

<p>'Ho!' said Richards, amused. '<i>I'd</i> pay <i>him</i> to do
<i>them</i>?'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'That bastard is never pleased. There's no hanky-panky about
this, is there?'</p>

<p>'Neither hanky, nor panky. Nothing is going to be abstracted
from the house, and nothing upset. I'll go bail for that. Indeed,
if it will make you any happier, I'll put the contract in
writing.'</p>

<p>'I'll take your word for it, sir. And your man can have the
privilege of doing Mr Flipping Lloyd's windows for nothing.' He
lifted his mug. 'Here's to the old eyes-right. What time will your
pupil be coming along tomorrow?'</p>

<p>'Ten o'clock do?'</p>

<p>'Make it half-past. Your valentine goes out most mornings about
eleven.'</p>

<p>'That's very thoughtful of you.'</p>

<p>'I'll get my early windows done and meet him at my place&mdash;3
Britt Mews&mdash;at half-past ten.'</p>

<p>It was no use trying to telephone Tad Cullen again tonight, so
Grant left a message at the Westmorland asking him to come to the
flat as soon as he had had breakfast in the morning.</p>

<p>Then he at last had dinner, and went thankfully to bed.</p>

<p>As he was falling asleep a voice in his head said: 'Because he
knew that there was nothing to write on.'</p>

<p>'What?' he said, coming awake. 'Who knew?'</p>

<p>'Lloyd. He said: "On what?"'</p>

<p>'Yes. Well?'</p>

<p>'He said it because he was startled.'</p>

<p>'He certainly sounded surprised.'</p>

<p>'He was surprised because he knew that there was nothing to
write on.'</p>

<p>He lay thinking about this until he fell asleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">TAD arrived, very washed and shining, before Grant
had finished breakfast. His soul was troubled, however, and he had
to be coaxed out of a contrite mood ('Can't help feeling that I
walked out on you, Mr Grant') before he was any good to anyone. He
cheered up at last when he found that there were definite plans for
the day.</p>

<p>'You mean you were serious about window cleaning? I thought it
was only a&mdash;a sort of figure of speech, maybe. You know: like
"I'll be selling matches for a living if this goes on." Why am I
going to clean Lloyd's windows?'</p>

<p>'Because it is the only honest way of getting a foot inside the
house. My colleagues can prove that you have no right to read a
gas-meter, or test the electricity, or the telephone. But they
cannot deny that you are a window-cleaner and are legally and
professionally getting on with your job. Richards&mdash;your boss
for today&mdash;says that Lloyd goes out nearly every day about
eleven, and he is going to take you there when Lloyd has gone.
He'll stay with you and work with you, of course, so that he can
introduce you as his assistant who is learning the trade. That way
you will be accepted without suspicion and left alone.'</p>

<p>'So I'm left alone.'</p>

<p>'On the desk in the big room that occupies most of the first
floor there is an engagement book. A large, very expensive,
red-leather affair. The desk is a table one&mdash;I mean that it
doesn't shut&mdash;and it stands just inside the middle
window.'</p>

<p>'So?'</p>

<p>'I want to know Lloyd's engagements for the 3rd and 4th of
March.'</p>

<p>'You think maybe he travelled on that train, 'm?'</p>

<p>'I should like to be sure that he didn't, anyhow. If I know what
his engagements were I can find out quite easily whether he kept
them or not.'</p>

<p>'Okay. That's quite easy. I'm looking forward to that window
cleaning. I've always wondered what I could do when I get too old
for flying. I might as well look into the window trade. To say
nothing of looking into a few windows.'</p>

<p>He went away, blithe and apparently forgetful that half an hour
ago he was 'lower than a worm's belly', and Grant looked round in
his mind for any acquaintances that he and Heron Lloyd might have
in common. He remembered that he had not yet rung up Marta Hallard
to announce his return to town. It might be a little early in the
day to break in on Marta's slumbers, but he would risk it.</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' Marta said, 'you didn't wake me. I'm half-way through
my breakfast and having my daily dose of news. Every day I swear
that never again will I read a daily paper, and every morning there
is the blasted thing lying waiting for me to open it and every
morning I open it. It upsets my digestive juices, and hardens my
arteries, and my face falls with a thud and undoes five guineas'
worth of Ayesha's ministrations in five minutes, but I have to have
my daily dose of poison. How are you, my dear? Are you better?'</p>

<p>She listened to his answer without interrupting. One of Marta's
more charming characteristics was her capacity for listening. With
most of his other women friends silence meant that they were
preparing their next speech and were merely waiting for the next
appropriate moment to give utterance to it.</p>

<p>'Have supper with me tonight. I'll be alone,' she said when she
had heard about Clune and his recovered health.</p>

<p>'Make it early next week, can you? How is the play going?'</p>

<p>'Well, darling, it would be going a lot better if Ronnie would
come up-stage now and then and talk to me instead of to the
audience. He says it emphasises the detachment of the character to
practically stamp on the floats and let the front stalls count his
eyelashes, but I think myself it's just a hangover from his
music-hall days.'</p>

<p>They discussed both Ronnie and the play for a little, and then
Grant said: 'Do you know Heron Lloyd, by the way?'</p>

<p>'The Arabia man? Not to say know; no. But I understand he's
almost as much of a hogger as Ronnie.'</p>

<p>'How?'</p>

<p>'Rory&mdash;my brother's boy&mdash;was mad to go exploring in
Arabia&mdash;though why anyone should want to go exploring in
Arabia I can't imagine&mdash;all dust and dates&mdash;anyway, Rory
wanted to go with Heron Lloyd, but it seems that Lloyd travels only
with Arabs. Rory, who is a nice child, says that that is because
Lloyd is so Arabian that he is <i>plus royaliste que le roi</i>,
but I think myself&mdash;being a low-minded creature and a rogue
and vagabond&mdash;that he is just suffering from Ronnie's trouble
and wants the whole stage.'</p>

<p>'What is Rory doing now?' Grant asked, skating away from Heron
Lloyd.</p>

<p>'Oh, he's in Arabia. The other man took him. Kinsey-Hewitt. Oh,
yes, Rory wouldn't be put off by a little thing like a snub. Can
you make it Tuesday: the supper?'</p>

<p>Yes, he would make it Tuesday. Before Tuesday he would be back
at work, and the matter of Bill Kenrick, who had come to England
full of excitement about Arabia and had died as Charles Martin in a
train going to the Highlands, would have to be put behind him. He
had only a day or two more.</p>

<p>He went out to have a hair-cut, and to think in that relaxed
hypnotic atmosphere of anything that they had left undone. Tad
Cullen was lunching with his boss. 'Richards won't accept anything
for this,' he had said to Tad, 'so take him out to lunch and give
him a thundering good one and I'll pay for it.'</p>

<p>'I'll take him out all right and be glad to,' Tad said, 'but I'm
damned if I'll let you pay for it. Bill Kenrick was my buddy, not
yours.'</p>

<p>So he sat in the warm, aromatic air of the barber's shop, half
dive half clinic, and tried to think of something that they could
still do to find Bill Kenrick's suitcases. But it was the returning
Tad who provided the suggestion.</p>

<p>Why, said Tad, not Agony-advertise for this girl.</p>

<p>'What girl?'</p>

<p>'The girl who has his luggage. <i>She</i> has no reason to be
shy&mdash;unless she's been helping herself to the contents, which
wouldn't be unknown. But Bill is a&mdash;was a better picker than
that. Why don't we say in capital letters: "BILL KENRICK"&mdash;to
catch the eye, get it?&mdash;and then just: "Any friend get in
touch with Number what's-it." Is there anything against that?'</p>

<p>No, Grant could think of nothing against that, but his eye was
on the piece of paper that Tad was fishing from his pocket.</p>

<p>'Did you find the book?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes. I had only to lean in and pick it up. That guy doesn't
do any homework, it seems. It's the dullest list of engagements
outside a prison. Not a gardenia from start to finish. And no good
to us anyway.'</p>

<p>'No good?'</p>

<p>'He was busy, it seems. Will I write out that advertisement for
the papers?'</p>

<p>'Yes, do. There's paper in my desk.'</p>

<p>'Which papers shall we send it to?'</p>

<p>'Write six, and we can address them later.'</p>

<p>He looked down at Tad's child-like copy of the entries in
Lloyd's engagement book. The entries for the 3rd and 4th of March.
And as he read them the full absurdity of his suspicions came home
to him. What was he thinking of? Was his mind still the
too-impressionable mind of a sick man? How could he ever have
dreamed that Heron Lloyd could possibly have been moved to murder?
Because that was what he had been thinking, wasn't it? That
somehow, in some way that they could not guess, Lloyd had been
responsible for Bill Kenrick's death.</p>

<p>He looked at the crucial entries, and thought that even if it
were proved that Lloyd had not kept these particular engagements it
would be fantastic to read into that absence any more than the
normal explanation: that Lloyd had been indisposed or had changed
his mind. On the night of the 3rd he had apparently attended a
dinner. 'Pioneer Society, Normandie, 7.15' the entry read. At 9.30
the following morning a Pathé Magazine film unit were due to arrive
at 5 Britt Lane and make him into number something-or-other of
their Celebrities At Home series. It would seem that Heron Lloyd
had more important things to think of than an unknown flyer who
claimed to have seen ruins in the sands of Arabia.</p>

<p>'But he said: "On what?"' said that voice in him.</p>

<p>'All <i>right</i>, he said: "On what?"! A fine world it would be
if one was going to be suspected, if one was going to be judged, by
every unconsidered remark.'</p>

<p>The Commissioner had once said to him: 'You have the most
priceless of all attributes for your job, and that is flair. But
don't let it ride you, Grant. Don't let your imagination take hold.
Keep it your servant.'</p>

<p>He had been in danger of letting his flair bolt with him. He
must take a pull on himself.</p>

<p>He would go back to where he was before he saw Lloyd. Back to
the company of Bill Kenrick. Back from wild imaginings to fact.
Hard, bare, uncompromising fact.</p>

<p>He looked across at Tad, nose to paper and pursuing his pen
across the page with it as a terrier noses a spider across a
floor.</p>

<p>'How was your milk-bar lady?'</p>

<p>'Oh, fine, fine,' said Tad, absent-minded and not lifting his
glance from his handiwork.</p>

<p>'Taking her out again?'</p>

<p>'Uh-huh. Meeting her tonight.'</p>

<p>'Think she will do as a steady?'</p>

<p>'She might,' Tad said, and then as he became aware of this
unusual interest he looked up and said: 'What's this in aid
of?'</p>

<p>'I'm thinking of deserting you for a day or two, and I'd like to
know that you won't be bored if left to your own devices.'</p>

<p>'Oh. Oh, no; I'll be all right. It's time you took some time off
to attend to your own affairs, I guess. After all, this is no
trouble of yours. You've done far too much as it is.'</p>

<p>'I'm not taking time off. I'm planning to fly over and see
Charles Martin's people.'</p>

<p>'People?'</p>

<p>'His family. They live just outside Marseilles.'</p>

<p>Tad's face, which had looked for a moment like a lost child's,
grew animated again.</p>

<p>'What do you reckon to get from them?'</p>

<p>'I'm not doing any reckoning. I'm just beginning from the other
end. We've come to a blank wall where Bill Kenrick is
concerned&mdash;unless his hypothetical girl-friend answers that
advertisement and that won't be for two days at the very
least&mdash;so we'll try the Charles Martin end and where we get
from there.'</p>

<p>'Fine. What about me coming with you?'</p>

<p>'I think not, Tad. I think you had better stay here and be O.C.
the Press. See that all these are inserted and pick up any
answers.'</p>

<p>'You're the boss,' Tad said in a resigned way. 'But I sure would
like to see Marseilles.'</p>

<p>'It's not a bit the way you picture it,' Grant said, amused.</p>

<p>'How do you know how I picture it?'</p>

<p>'I can imagine.'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, I suppose I can sit on a stool and look at Daphne.
What funny names girls have in this neck of the woods. It's a bit
draughty, but I can count up the number of times people say
thank-you for doing other people service.'</p>

<p>'If it's iniquity you're looking for you'll find as much on a
Leicester Square pavement as you will on the Cannebière.'</p>

<p>'Maybe, but I like my iniquity with some ooh-la-la in it.'</p>

<p>'Hasn't Daphne got any ooh-la-la?'</p>

<p>'No. Daphne's very la-di-da. I have an awful suspicion that she
wears woollen underwear.'</p>

<p>'She would need it in a milk-bar in Leicester Square in April.
She sounds a nice girl.'</p>

<p>'Oh, she's fine, fine. But don't you stay too long away, or the
wolf in me will prove too strong and I'll take the first plane out
to Marseilles to join you. When do you plan to go?'</p>

<p>'Tomorrow morning, if I can get a seat. Move over and let me
reach the telephone. If I get an early-morning service I can, with
a piece of luck, get back the following day. If not, then Friday at
the latest. How did you get on with Richards?'</p>

<p>'Oh, we're great buddies. But I'm a bit disillusioned.'</p>

<p>'About what?'</p>

<p>'About the possibilities of the trade.'</p>

<p>'Doesn't it pay?'</p>

<p>'I expect it pays off in coin but not any other way, take it
from me. All you can see from outside a window, believe it or not,
is your own reflection in the glass. What are the names of those
papers you want me to address these things to?'</p>

<p>Grant gave him the names of the six newspapers with the largest
circulations, and sent him away with his blessing to employ his
time as he saw fit until they met again.</p>

<p>'I certainly wish I was going with you,' Tad said once more as
he was leaving, and Grant wondered if seeing the South of France as
one big honky-tonk was any more absurd than seeing it as mimosa.
Which was what it was to him.</p>

<p>'France!' said Mrs Tinker. 'When you've only just come back from
foreign parts!'</p>

<p>'The Highlands may be foreign parts, but the South of France is
merely an extension of England.'</p>

<p>'It's a very expensive extension, I've 'eard. <i>Roonous.</i>
When was you expectin' to be back? I got a loverly chicken from
Carr's for you.'</p>

<p>'The day after tomorrow, I hope. Friday at the latest.'</p>

<p>'Oh, then it'll keep. Was you wantin' to be called earlier
tomorrow mornin', then?'</p>

<p>'I'll be away before you come in, I think. So you can have a
late morning tomorrow.'</p>

<p>'A late mornin' wouldn't suit Tinker, it wouldn't. But I'll get
me shoppin' done before I come in. Now you see and take care of
yerself. No burning the candle at both ends and comin' back lookin'
no better than when you went away to Scotland in the beginnin'. I
'ope it keeps fine for you!'</p>

<p>Fine indeed, Grant thought, looking down at the map of France
next morning. From that height on this crystal morning it was not a
thing of earth and water and crops. It was a small jewelled pattern
set in a lapis-lazuli sea; a Fabergé creation. Not much wonder that
flyers as a species had a detached attitude to the world. What had
the world&mdash;its literature, its music, its philosophies, or its
history&mdash;to do with a man who saw it habitually for the thing
it was: a bit of Fabergé nonsense?</p>

<p>Marseilles, at close quarters, was no jeweller's creation. It
was the usual noisy crowded place filled with impatient taxi-horns
and the smell of stale coffee; that very French smell that haunts
its houses with the ghosts of ten million coffee-brewings. But the
sun shone, and the striped awnings flapped a little in the breeze
from the Mediterranean, and the mimosa displayed its pale expensive
yellow in prodigal masses. As a companion picture to the grey and
scarlet of London it was, he thought, perfect. If he ever was rich
he would commission one of the best artists in the world to put the
two pictures on canvas for him; the chiaroscuro of London and
bright positive blaze of Marseilles. Or perhaps two different
artists. It was unlikely that the man who could convey the London
of a grey day in April would also be able to paint the essence of
Marseilles on a spring noon.</p>

<p>He stopped thinking about artists and ceased to find Marseilles
either bright or positive when he found that the Martin family had
left their suburb only the week before for parts unknown. Unknown,
that was, to the neighbours. By the time that he had with the help
of the local authorities discovered that 'part unknown' merely
meant Toulon, a great deal of precious time had been wasted, and
still more was wasted in journeying to Toulon and finding the
Martins among its teeming inhabitants.</p>

<p>But in the end he found them and listened to the little they had
to tell. Charles was a 'bad boy', they said, with all the
antagonism of the French for someone who has apostatised from that
supreme god of the French idolatry, the Family. He had always been
a wilful, headstrong creature and (crime of crimes in the French
calendar) lazy. Bone lazy. He had gone away five years ago after a
small trouble over a girl&mdash;no, no, he had merely stabbed
her&mdash;and had not bothered to write to them. They had had no
news of him in all those years except that a friend had run into
him in Port Said about three years ago. He was doing pavement deals
in second-hand cars, the friend said. Buying up crocks and selling
them after he had tinkered with them a little. He was a very good
mechanic; he could have been a very successful man, with a garage
of his own and people working for him, if he had not been so lazy.
Bone lazy. A laziness that was formidable. A laziness that was a
disease. They had heard nothing more of him until they had been
asked to identify his body.</p>

<p>Grant asked if they had a photograph of Charles.</p>

<p>Yes, they had several, but of course they were of Charles when
he was much younger.</p>

<p>They showed him the photographs, and Grant saw why Bill Kenrick,
dead, looked not too unlike the Charles Martin that his family had
remembered. One thin dark man with marked eyebrows, hollowed
cheeks, and straight dark hair looked very like any other similar
young man when the individuality of life was quenched. They did not
even have to have the same colour of eyes. A parent receives a
message saying: Your son is dead as the result of a regrettable
accident; would you please identify him as your son and arrange for
the burial. The bereaved parent is presented with his dead son's
papers and belongings and is asked to identify the owner as his
son. There is no question in his conditioned mind; he accepts what
he sees, and what he sees is what he expected to see. It would not
occur to him to say: Are this man's eyes blue or brown?</p>

<p>In the end, of course, it was Grant who submitted to
questioning. Why was he interested in Charles? Had Charles after
all left some money? Was it that Grant was looking for the legal
heirs, perhaps?</p>

<p>No, Grant had promised to look Charles up on behalf of a friend
who had known him on the Persian Gulf coast. No, he did not know
what the friend wanted of him. He understood that there was some
suggestion of a future partnership.</p>

<p>In the expressed opinion of the Martin family the friend was
lucky.</p>

<p>They gave him Armagnac and coffee and little biscuits with
Bath-bun sugar on them, and asked him to come again if he was ever
in Toulon.</p>

<p>On the doorstep he asked if they had possession of their son's
papers. Only his personal ones, they said: his letters. The
official ones they had not bothered with or thought about. They
were no doubt still with the Marseilles police, who had first made
contact with them when the accident happened.</p>

<p>So a little more time was wasted in making friends with the
Marseilles officials; but this time Grant spent no energy on
conscientiously-unofficial methods. He produced his credentials and
asked for a loan of the papers. He drank a <i>sirop</i>, and signed
a receipt. And he caught the afternoon plane to London on Friday
afternoon.</p>

<p>He had two more days. Or one day and a Sunday, to be
accurate.</p>

<p>France was still a jewelled pattern as he flew back over it, but
Britain seemed to have disappeared altogether. Beyond the familiar
outline of the western European coast there was nothing but an
ocean of haze. Very odd and incomplete the map looked without the
familiar shape of that very individual island. Supposing there
never had been that island: how different would the history of the
world have been? It was a fascinating speculation. An all-Spanish
America, one supposed. A French India; an India without a
colour-bar and so racially intermarried that it had lost its
identity. A Dutch South Africa ruled by a fanatic Church.
Australia? Who would have discovered and colonised Australia? The
Dutch from South Africa, or the Spaniards from America? It was
immaterial, he supposed, since either race would in a generation
have become tall, lean, tough, nasal, drawling, sceptical and
indestructible. Just as all Americans eventually began to look like
Red Indians even if they entered the country as broad large-boned
Saxons.</p>

<p>They dropped into the ocean of cloud and found Britain again. A
very mundane, muddy, and workaday place to have changed the history
of a world. A steady drizzle soaked the land and the lieges. London
was a water-colour of grey reflections with spots of vermilion oil
paint where the buses plunged dripping through the haze.</p>

<p>All the lights were on in the finger-print department although
it was still daylight; and Cartwright was sitting just as he had
last seen him&mdash;as he had always seen him&mdash;with a
half-drunk cup of cold tea at his elbow, the saucer filled with
cigarette butts.</p>

<p>'Something I can do for you this beautiful spring afternoon?'
Cartwright said.</p>

<p>'Yes. There is one thing I want very much to know. Have you ever
drunk the second half of a cup of tea?'</p>

<p>Cartwright considered this. 'Come to think of it, I don't know
that I ever have. Beryl usually takes my cup away and fills it up
with fresh stuff. Something else off the cuff? Or is this just a
social call?'</p>

<p>'Yes, something else. But you'll be <i>working</i> for me on
Monday, so don't let your sense of benevolence get out of hand.' He
put Charles Martin's papers on the table. 'When can you do these
for me?'</p>

<p>'What is this? French identity papers. What are you getting
into&mdash;or do you want to keep it to yourself?'</p>

<p>'I'm just having one last bet on a horse called Flair. If it
comes off I'll tell you about it. I'll pick up the prints tomorrow
morning.'</p>

<p>He looked at the clock and reckoned that if Tad Cullen was
'dating' Daphne, or any other female creature, tonight, he would at
this moment be dolling himself up in his hotel room. He left
Cartwright and went to a telephone where he could talk unheard.</p>

<p>'<i>We-e-ll!</i>' said Tad joyously, when he heard Grant's
voice. 'Where are you talking from? Are you back?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I'm back. I'm in London. Look, Tad, you say you've never
known anyone called Charles Martin. But is it possible that you
knew him under another name? Did you ever know a very good
mechanic, very good with cars, who was French and looked a little
like Bill?'</p>

<p>Tad thought this over.</p>

<p>'I don't think I've ever known any mechanic who was French. I've
known a Swedish mechanic and a Greek mechanic, but neither of them
was in the least like Bill. Why?'</p>

<p>'Because Martin worked in the Middle East. And it is just
possible that Bill got those papers from him before he ever came to
Britain at all. Martin may have sold them to him. He was&mdash;is:
he may be living&mdash;a lazy creature and probably very hard-up at
intervals. Out there, where no one bothers very much about
credentials, he might have tried to cash them.'</p>

<p>'Yes; he might. Someone else's papers are usually more valuable
than your own out there. To have around, I mean. But why would
<i>Bill</i> buy them? Bill never did anything on the side.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps because he looked a little like Martin. I don't know.
Anyhow, you yourself have never run into anyone like Martin in the
Middle East?'</p>

<p>'Not anywhere, that I can think of. What did you get? Out of the
Martins. Anything worth while?'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid not. They showed me photographs; which made it clear
how much he would look like Bill if he was not alive. Something
that we knew already. And of course the fact that he had gone East
to work. Any answers to the advertisement?'</p>

<p>'Five.'</p>

<p>'<i>Five?</i>'</p>

<p>'All from fellows called Bill Kenrick.'</p>

<p>'Oh. Asking what was in it for them?'</p>

<p>'You've got it.'</p>

<p>'Not a word from anyone who knew him?'</p>

<p>'Not a peep. And nothing at the Charles Martin end either, it
seems. We're sunk, aren't we?'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;waterlogged, shall we say. We have one remaining
asset.'</p>

<p>'We have? What is that?'</p>

<p>'Time. We have forty-eight more hours.'</p>

<p>'Mr Grant, you're an optimist.'</p>

<p>'You have to be in my business,' Grant said, but he did not feel
very optimistic. He felt flat and tired. He was within an ace of
wishing that he had never heard of Bill Kenrick. Wishing that he
had come down that corridor at Scoone just ten seconds later. In
ten more seconds Yughourt would have realised that the man was dead
and would have shut the door and gone for help; and he, Grant,
would have walked down that empty corridor and stepped down on to
the platform unaware that there had ever existed a young man called
Bill Kenrick. He would never have known that anyone had died on the
train. He would have driven away with Tommy to the hills, and no
words about singing sands would have disturbed his holiday. He
would have fished in peace, and finished his holiday in peace.</p>

<p>In too much peace&mdash;perhaps? With too much time to think
about himself and his bondage to unreason. Too much time to take
his own mental and spiritual pulse.</p>

<p>No, of course he was not sorry that he had heard of Bill
Kenrick. He was Bill Kenrick's debtor as long as he lived, and if
it took him till the end of his days he would find out what had
changed Bill Kenrick into Charles Martin. But if only he could
clear up this thing before he was swamped by that demanding life
that was waiting for him on Monday.</p>

<p>He asked how Daphne was, and Tad said that as a female companion
she had one enormous advantage over everyone he had ever known: she
was pleased with very little. If you gave her a bunch of violets
she was as pleased as most girls are with orchids. It was Tad's
considered opinion that she had never heard of orchids, and he,
personally, had no intention of bringing them to her notice.</p>

<p>'She sounds the domestic type. You take care, Tad, or she'll be
going back to the Middle East with you.'</p>

<p>'Not while I'm conscious,' Tad said. 'No female is going back
East with me. I'm not having any little-woman-round-the-house
cluttering up <i>our</i> bungalow. I mean, my bun&mdash;. I
mean&mdash;' His voice died away.</p>

<p>The conversation became suddenly broken-backed, and Grant rang
off after promising to call him as soon as he had anything to
report or an idea to share.</p>

<p>He went out into the wet haze, bought himself an evening paper,
and found a taxi to take him home. The paper was a <i>Signal</i>,
and the sight of the familiar heading took him back to that
breakfast at Scoone four weeks ago. He thought again how constant
in kind the headlines were. The Cabinet row, the dead body of the
blonde in Maida Vale, the Customs prosecution, the hold-up, the
arrival of an American actor, the street accident. Even 'PLANE
CRASH IN ALPS' was common enough to rank as a constant.</p>

<p>'Yesterday evening the dwellers in the high valleys of Chamonix
saw a rose of flame break out on the icy summit of Mont
Blanc&mdash;'</p>

<p>The <i>Signal's</i> style was constant too.</p>

<p>The only thing waiting for him at 19 Tenby Court was a letter
from Pat, which said:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">Dear Alan, they say you must have marjuns but I
think marjuns is havers. waste not want not. this is a fly I made
for you. it was not done in time before you went. it may not be any
good for those english rivers but you better have it anyway your
affectionate cousin Patrick.</p>
<br>

<p>This production cheered Grant considerably, and while he ate his
dinner he considered alternately the economy, in capitals as well
as in margins, and the enclosed lure. The fly exceeded in
originality even that remarkable affair which he had been lent at
Clune. He decided to use it on the Severn on a day when they would
'take' a piece of red rubber hot-water-bottle, so that he could
write honestly to Pat and report that the Rankin fly had landed a
big one.</p>

<p>The typical Scots insularity in 'those English rivers' made him
hope that Laura would not wait too long before sending Pat away to
his English school. The quality of Scotchness was a highly
concentrated essence, and should always be diluted. As an
ingredient it was admirable; neat, it was as abominable as
ammonia.</p>

<p>He stuck the fly above the calendar on his desk, so that he
might go on being amused by its catholicity and warmed by his young
cousin's devotion, and got thankfully into pyjamas and a
dressing-gown. There was at least one consolation for being in town
when he might still be in the country: he could get into a
dressing-gown and put his feet on the mantelpiece in the sure and
certain knowledge that no telephone call from Whitehall 1212 would
intrude on his leisure.</p>

<p>But he had not had his feet up for twenty minutes when Whitehall
1212 was on the telephone.</p>

<p>It was Cartwright.</p>

<p>'Did I understand you to say that you had had a bet on Flair?'
said Cartwright's voice.</p>

<p>'Yes. Why?'</p>

<p>'I don't know anything about it but I have an idea that your
horse has won,' said Cartwright. He added, very silky and sweet
like a Broadcasting Aunt: '<i>Good</i> night, sir,' and hung
up.</p>

<p>'Hey!' said Grant, and jiggled the telephone key.
'<i>Hey!</i>'</p>

<p>But Cartwright had gone. And it would be no use trying to bring
him to the telephone any more tonight. This amiable piece of
teasing was Cartwright's come-back; his charge for doing a couple
of buckshee jobs.</p>

<p>Grant went back to his Runyon, but he could no longer keep his
attention on that strictly legit character, Judge Henry G. Blake.
Blast Cartwright and his little jokes. Now he would have to go to
the Yard first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>But in the morning he forgot all about Cartwright.</p>

<p>By eight o'clock in the morning Cartwright had sunk back into
the great ocean of incidentals that bear us on from one day to the
next, unremarkable in their plankton swarming.</p>

<p>The morning began as it always did, with the rattle of china and
the voice of Mrs Tinker as she set down his early-morning tea. This
was the preliminary to four glorious minutes during which he lay
still more asleep than awake and let his tea cool, so Mrs Tinker's
voice came to him down a long tunnel that led to life and the
daylight but need not yet be traversed.</p>

<p>'Just listen to it,' Mrs Tinker's voice said, referring
apparently to the steady beat of the rain. 'Stair rods, cats and
dogs, reservoyers. Niagara also ran. Seems they've bin and found
Shangri-la. I could do with a spot of Shangri-la myself this
morning.'</p>

<p>The word turned over in his sleepy mind like a weed in calm
water. Shangri-la. Very soporific. Very soporific. Shangri-la. Some
place in a film. In a novel. Some unspoiled Eden. Shut away from
the world.</p>

<p>'According to this mornin's papers they never 'ave no rain at
all there.'</p>

<p>'Where?' he said, to show that he was awake.</p>

<p>'Arabia, so it seems.'</p>

<p>He heard the door close and dropped a little further under the
surface of things for the enjoyment of those four minutes. Arabia.
Arabia. Another soporific. They had found Shangri-la in Arabia.
They&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Arabia!</i>
</p>

<p>In one great whirl of blankets he came to the surface and
reached for the papers. There were two, but it was the
<i>Clarion</i> that came to his hand first because it was the
<i>Clarion</i> whose headlines constituted Mrs Tinker's daily dose
of reading.</p>

<p>He did not have to search for it. It was there on the front
page. It was the best front-page stuff that any newspaper had had
since Crippen.</p>

<p>SHANGRI-LA REALLY EXISTS. SENSATIONAL DISCOVERY. HISTORIC FIND
IN ARABIA.</p>

<p>He glanced over the hysterically excited paragraphs and
discarded the paper impatiently for the more trustworthy <i>Morning
News</i>. But the <i>Morning News</i> was almost as excited as the
<i>Clarion</i>. KINSEY-HEWITT'S GREAT FIND, said the <i>Morning
News</i>. ASTOUNDING NEWS FROM ARABIA.</p>

<p>'We print, with great pride, Paul Kinsey-Hewitt's own despatch,'
said the <i>Morning News</i>. 'As our readers will see his
discovery had been vouched for by three R.A.F. planes sent to
locate the place after Mr Kinsey-Hewitt's arrival at Makallah.' The
<i>Morning News</i> had had a contract with Kinsey-Hewitt for a
series of articles on his present journey, when that journey should
be completed, and was now delirious with pleasure at its unexpected
luck.</p>

<p>He skipped the <i>Morning News</i> on its own triumph and went
on to the far soberer prose of the triumphant explorer himself.</p>

<p>'We were in the Empty Quarter on scientific errands...no thought
in our minds of human history either factual or legendary...a
well-explored country...bare mountains that no one had ever
considered climbing...a waste of time between one well and the
next...in a land where water is life no one turns aside to climb
precipitous heights...attention caught by a plane that came twice
in five days and spent some time circling low above the
mountains...occurred to us that some plane had crashed...possible
rescue...conference...Rory Hallard and I to search while Daoud went
on to the well at Zaruba and brought a load of water back to meet
us...no entrance apparent...walls like the Garbh Coire on
Braeriach...giving up...Rory...a track that even a goat would baulk
at...two hours to the ridge...a valley of astounding beauty...green
almost shocking...kind of tamarisk...architecture reminiscent of

friendly...greatly excited by the appearance of the plane which
they seemed to have taken to be some kind of bird...paved squares
and streets...oddly metropolitan...isolation due not to the
difficulties of the mountain track but to lack of animal transport

of a small island in an ocean of desert...as unaware what lay
beyond that desert or how far it might extend as the Ancients were
of what lay beyond the Atlantic...tradition of disaster, but owing
to language difficulties this is surmise, being a translation of
sign-talk rather than...strip cultivation...monkey god in
stone...Wabar...volcanic convulsion...Wabar...Wabar....'</p>

<p>The <i>Morning News</i> had inset a neat outline map of Arabia
with crosses in the appropriate place.</p>

<p>Grant lay and stared at it.</p>

<p>So <i>that</i> was what Bill Kenrick had seen.</p>

<p>He had come out of the shouting heart of the storm, out of the
whirling sand and the darkness, and looked down at that green
civilised valley lying among the rocks. Not much wonder that he had
come back looking 'concussed', looking as if his mind were 'still
back there'. He had not quite believed it himself. He had gone back
to search; to look for, and eventually look at, this place that
appeared on no map. This&mdash;<i>this</i>&mdash;was his
Paradise.</p>

<p>This was what he had been writing about on the blank space of an
evening paper.</p>

<p>This was what he had come to England to&mdash;</p>

<p>To Heron Lloyd to&mdash;</p>

<p>To <i>Heron Lloyd</i>&mdash;!</p>

<p>He flung the <i>News</i> away and leaped out of bed.</p>

<p>'Tink!' he called as he turned on the bath-water. 'Tink, never
mind breakfast. Get me some coffee.'</p>

<p>'But you can't go out on a morning like this with just a cup
of&mdash;'</p>

<p>'<i>Don't argue!</i> Get me some coffee!'</p>

<p>The water roared into the bath. The liar. The god-damned smooth
heartless lime-hogging liar. The vain vicious murdering liar. How
had he done it?</p>

<p>By God, he would see that he hanged for this.</p>

<p>'On what evidence?' said his inner voice, nasty-polite.</p>

<p>'You shut up! I'll get the evidence if I have to discover a
whole new continent to find it! "Poor boy! Poor boy!" said he,
shaking his head over so sad a fate. Sweet Christ, I'll hang for
him myself if I can't kill him any other way!'</p>

<p>'Calm down, calm down. That's no mood to interview a suspect
in.'</p>

<p>'I'm not interviewing a suspect, blast your police mind. I'm
going to tell Heron Lloyd what I think of him. I'm not a
police-officer until after I've dealt personally with Lloyd.'</p>

<p>'You can't hit a man of sixty.'</p>

<p>'I'm not going to hit him. I'm going to half-murder him. The
ethics of hitting or not hitting don't enter into the matter at
all.'</p>

<p>'He may be worth hanging for but not worth being requested to
resign for.'</p>

<p>'"I found him delightful," said he, kind and patronising. The
bastard. The smooth vain murdering bastard. The&mdash;'</p>

<p>From the wells of his experience he dredged up words to serve
his need. But his anger went on consuming him like a furnace.</p>

<p>He flung out of the house after two mouthfuls of toast and three
gulps of coffee, and went round to the garage at the double. It was
too early to hope for a taxi; the quickest way was to use his
car.</p>

<p>Would Lloyd have read the papers yet?</p>

<p>If he did not normally leave the house before eleven o'clock,
then surely breakfast could not be until nine. He would like very
much to be at 5 Britt Lane before Lloyd opened his morning paper.
It would be sweet, consoling sweet, satisfying sweet, to watch
Lloyd take the news. He had murdered to keep that secret his own,
to ensure that the glory should be his, and now the secret was
front-page news and the glory belonged to his rival. Oh, Sweet
Jesus, let him not have read about it yet.</p>

<p>He rang twice at 5 Britt Lane before his summons was answered,
and then it was answered not by the amiable Mahmoud but by a large
woman in felt slippers.</p>

<p>'Mr Lloyd?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, Mr Lloyd's up in Cumberland for a day or two.'</p>

<p>'Cumberland! When did he go to Cumberland?'</p>

<p>'Thursday afternoon.'</p>

<p>'When do you expect him back?'</p>

<p>'Oh, they've just gone for a day or two.'</p>

<p>'They? Mahmoud too.'</p>

<p>'Of course Mahmoud too. Mr Lloyd he doesn't go anywhere without
Mahmoud goes with him.'</p>

<p>'I see. Can you give me his address?'</p>

<p>'I'd give it you if I had it. But they don't bother with
re-addressing when they go for only a day or two. Will you leave a
message? Or will you call back, perhaps? They'll like as not arrive
back this afternoon.'</p>

<p>No, he would not leave a message. He would come back. His name
did not matter.</p>

<p>He felt like someone who has braked too suddenly and been hit in
the wind. As he went out to his car he remembered that Tad Cullen
would read that story in a few minutes' time; if he had not read it
already. He went back to the flat and was met in the lobby by a
relieved Mrs Tinker.</p>

<p>'Thank heaven you're back. That American boy's been on the phone
and goin' on somethink awful. I can't make 'ead or tail of what 'e
thinks he's talkin' about. Ravin' mad, 'e is. I says: Mr Grant'll
ring you, I says, the minute 'e come in, but 'e can't leave the
phone alone. Just puts it down an' picks it up again. I bin running
backwards and forwards between the sink and the phone like
a&mdash;' The telephone rang. 'There you are! There 'e is
again!'</p>

<p>Grant picked up the receiver. It was indeed Tad, and he was all
that Mrs Tinker had said. He was incoherent with rage.</p>

<p>'But he lied!' he kept saying. 'That guy lied. Of <i>course</i>
Bill told him all that!'</p>

<p>'Yes, of course he did. Listen Tad...Listen...No, you can't go
and beat him to a jelly...Yes, of course you can find his house for
yourself; I don't doubt it, but...<i>Listen</i>, Tad!...I've
<i>been</i> to his house...Oh, yes, even at <i>this</i> hour of the
morning. I read my papers earlier than you do...No, I didn't beat
him up. I couldn't...No, not because I'm windy but because he's in
Cumberland...Yes. Since Thursday...I don't know. I'll have to think
about it. Give me until lunch-time. Do you trust my judgement on
things in general?...Well, you'll have to trust it in this. I must
have time to think...To think up some evidence, of course...It's
customary...I'll tell my story to the Yard, of course, and of
course they will believe me. I mean, my story of Bill's visit to
Lloyd, and Lloyd's lies to me. But proving that Charles Martin was
Bill Kenrick is quite a different matter. Until lunch-time I shall
be writing out a statement for the Yard. Come about one o'clock and
we can have lunch together. In the afternoon I must turn the whole
thing over to the authorities.'</p>

<p>He hated the thought. This was his own private fight. It had
been his own private fight from the very beginning. From that
moment when he had looked down through the open compartment door on
to the dead face of an unknown boy. It was a thousand times more
his private fight since his meeting with Lloyd.</p>

<p>He had begun to write, when he remembered that he had not yet
picked up the papers he had left with Cartwright. He lifted the
receiver, dialled the number, and asked for Cartwright's extension.
Could Cartwright possibly find a messenger to send round with those
papers? He, Grant, was frantically busy. It was Saturday, and he
was clearing up before going back to work on Monday. He would be
very grateful.</p>

<p>He went back to his writing, and became so absorbed that he was
conscious only in a dim way that Mrs Tinker had brought in the
second post: the noon one. It was when he raised his glance from
the paper to search his mind for a word, that his eye fell on the
envelope she had laid beside him on the desk. It was a foolscap
envelope, rather stiff and expensive, well-filled, and addressed in
a thin, angular cramped hand that managed to be at once finicking
and flamboyant.</p>

<p>Grant had never seen Heron Lloyd's handwriting. He recognised it
instantly.</p>

<p>He put down his pen; cautiously, as if the strange letter was a
bomb and any undue vibration might send it off.</p>

<p>He wiped his palms down the thighs of his trousers in a gesture
he had not used since he was a child, the gesture of a small boy
facing the incalculable, and put out his hand for the envelope.</p>

<p>It had been posted in London.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">THE letter was dated Thursday morning.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr Grant</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">Or should I say Inspector? Oh, yes, I know about
that. It did not take me long to find out. My excellent Mahmoud is
a better detective than any of your well-meaning amateurs on the
Embankment. But I shall not give you your rank, because this is a
social communication. I write to you as one unique human being to
another worthy of his attention. Indeed, it is because you are the
only Englishman who has ever moved me to even a momentary
admiration that I present these facts to you and not to the
Press.</p>

<p class="letter">And because, of course, I am sure of your
interest.</p>

<p class="letter">I have this morning had a letter from my
follower, Paul Kinsey-Hewitt, announcing his discovery in Arabia.
The letter was sent from the <i>Morning News</i> office at his
request, to anticipate the publication of the news tomorrow
morning. A piece of courtesy for which I am grateful to him. It is
ironic that it should have been the Kenrick youth who was
responsible for bringing to him, too, the knowledge of the valley's
existence. I saw a great deal of the Kenrick youth while he was in
London and I could find nothing in him worthy of so great a
destiny. He was a very common-place young man. He spent his days
flying a mechanical contraption mindlessly across deserts that men
had conquered only with suffering and resolution. He was full of a
plan whereby I should provide the transport and he should lead me
to this find of his. But that of course was absurd. I have not
lived my life and made a great name in the desert to be led to
discovery by an instrument-watcher from the back streets of
Portsmouth; to be a transport provider, a camel-hirer, for some
other man's convenience. It was not to be thought of that a youth
who by a climatic hazard, a geographical accident, had stumbled on
one of the great discoveries of the world should be allowed to
profit by it at the expense of men who had given their lives to
exploration.</p>

<p class="letter">As far as I could judge, the young man's only
virtue (why do you waste your interest on so dull a piece of human
mass-production?) was a capacity for continence. In speech, of
course; please don't misunderstand me. And it was important from my
point of view that the tongue which he had held with so rare a
continence should go on being unwagged.</p>

<p class="letter">Since he had arranged to meet another of his kind
in Paris on the 4th (poor beautiful Lutetia, for ever raped by the
barbarian) I had a little less than a fortnight to contrive this. I
did not in fact need the fortnight. I could have achieved my end in
two days if necessary.</p>

<p class="letter">I had once, when travelling to Scotland by night,
stayed awake to write some letters and post them at Crewe when the
train would reach its first stop. I had thought then, as I sat
looking at the platform after getting rid of my letters, how easy
it would be to leave the train unobserved. The attendant stepped
out to receive late-joining passengers and then went away on
affairs of his own. There was a long wait at a quite deserted
platform while luggage was loaded into the distant vans. If one had
managed to travel so far unaccounted for, one could step off the
train and no one would ever know that one had been on it.</p>

<p class="letter">That memory was the first of the two props for my
inspiration.</p>

<p class="letter">The second was my possession of Charles Martin's
papers.</p>

<p class="letter">Charles Martin was my mechanic. He was the only
European and the only technician (what an appropriately deplorable
word!) ever employed by me. I engaged him for the least successful
of my expeditions, the semi-mechanised one, because my Arabs
(though learning rapidly, alas!) were not skilful with machinery.
He was a repellent creature, interested in nothing but internal
combustion and the avoidance of his share of camp duties, and I was
not sorry when he died in mid-desert. We had by that time found the
vehicles a liability rather than a help and had decided to abandon
them, so Martin had already outlived his usefulness. (No, I had
nothing to do with his death; Heaven in this instance did its own
scavenging.) No one asked for his papers, and since the journey was
from coast to coast we never returned to the town in which I had
engaged him. His papers lay in my baggage, a matter of no interest
to me or to anyone else, and came back to England with me.</p>

<p class="letter">I remembered them when it was necessary to
silence the Kenrick youth. Kenrick looked not too unlike Charles
Martin.</p>

<p class="letter">It was Kenrick's plan to go back to his
Carter-Paterson occupation in the East until such time as I should
join him there, and we should then set out on our expedition
together. He came to see me at Britt Lane very often, to discuss
routes and plume himself on the prospect in front of him, and it
amused me to see him sit there and babble his nonsense when I had
so strange a translation prepared for him.</p>

<p class="letter">He had arranged to go to Paris by the night-ferry
on the 3rd. He 'collected' ferries, it seemed. He would go many
miles out of his way to be punted across a stream which he could
have crossed by a bridge a few yards from where he was standing.
The Dover ferry was to be his two-hundredth, I think. When he told
me that he had booked a berth on the train-ferry I telephoned, as
soon as he had gone, and booked a berth to Scoone in the name of
Charles Martin for the same night.</p>

<p class="letter">When I next saw him I suggested that since I was
going to Scotland on the same evening on which he was leaving for
Paris, he should leave his luggage (he had only two suitcases) in
the cloak-room at Victoria, dine early with me at Britt Lane, and
see me off at Euston.</p>

<p class="letter">He was always delighted to fall in with any
suggestion that I was moved to put to him, and he agreed, as I knew
he would, to this. We dined, on a rice and cutlets and apricots
dish that Mahmoud has taught Mrs Lucas to make (it needs long
cooking so that the dish is impregnated with the flavour of the
apricots) and Mahmoud drove us to Euston. At Euston I sent Kenrick
to pick up my sleeper ticket while I went ahead. By the time
Kenrick rejoined me I had found my compartment and was waiting on
the platform for his arrival. If by chance he wondered why I was
travelling as Charles Martin I had the excuse of my fame to account
for an incognito. But he made no comment.</p>

<p class="letter">I felt that the gods were on my side when I saw
that the attendant was Old Yughourt. You will not know Old
Yughourt. He has never in the whole course of his career been known
to take an interest in any passenger whatever, his chief object
when on duty being to retire to his own unsavoury compartment at
the earliest possible moment and go to sleep there.</p>

<p class="letter">We had less than five minutes before the train
was due to depart. We stood talking for a little with the door
half-closed, Kenrick facing the corridor. Presently he said that he
had better get out, or he might be carried to the Highlands. I
indicated my small overnight case which was lying beside him on the
bunk and said: 'If you open my case you'll find something in it for
you. A keepsake till we meet again.'</p>

<p class="letter">He bent over, with an almost childish eagerness,
to unfasten the two locks. The position was perfect. I took from my
pocket the most satisfactory weapon ever devised by man for the
destruction of his unsuspecting enemy. Primitive man in desert
countries had neither knife nor rifle, but he made the sand serve.
A rag and a few handfuls of sand, and a skull would crack like an
egg-shell; very neatly it would crack, without blood or fuss. He
gave a small grunt and fell forward over the case. I shut and
locked the door and looked to see if his nose was bleeding. It was
not. I dragged him off the berth and bundled him under it. This was
my only miscalculation. One half of the space under the berth was
occupied by some permanent obstruction, and thin and slight as he
was his knees could not be pushed back out of sight. I took off my
own coat and flung it on the berth so that it hung over and hid his
legs. As I arranged the folds in a manner at once concealing and
suitably casual, the whistle went. I put the outward half of my
ticket to Scoone, together with my sleeper ticket, on the small
shelf below the mirror where Yughourt would see it, and walked down
the corridor to the lavatory. No one had interest for anything but
the moment of leave-taking. I shut myself into the lavatory and
waited.</p>

<p class="letter">About twenty minutes later I heard the successive
closing of doors that meant that Yughourt was making his rounds.
When I heard him in the compartment next door I began to wash,
noisily. He tapped at the door a few moments later and asked if I
were the passenger in B Seven. I said that I was. He announced that
he had found my tickets and taken them. I heard him go through to
the next coach and begin his door-slamming, and I walked back to B
Seven and locked myself in.</p>

<p class="letter">After that I had three uninterrupted hours to
make all perfect.</p>

<p class="letter">If you ever want to be sure of uninterrupted
peace, my dear Mr Grant, buy yourself a sleeper ticket to the North
of Scotland. There is nowhere in this world where one is so safe
from interruption as one is in a sleeping compartment once the
attendant has done his round. Not even in the desert.</p>

<p class="letter">I retrieved Kenrick from below the bunk, rubbed
his head on the edge of the wash-hand basin, and laid him on the
bunk. An examination of his clothes showed a gratifying
cosmopolitanism. His underclothes seemed to be dhobi-washed, his
suit made in Hong Kong, and his shoes in Karachi. His watch was a
cheap metal one with neither name nor initials.</p>

<p class="letter">I removed the contents of his pockets and
substituted Charles Martin's pocket-book and its contents.</p>

<p class="letter">He was still alive, but he stopped breathing as
we were running through the yards at Rugby.</p>

<p class="letter">From then on I dressed the set, as they say in
the theatre. And I don't think that I missed anything; did I, Mr
Grant? The details were perfect, even to the crushed hairs in the
wash-hand basin and the dusty palms of his hands. In the case that
I was leaving behind were old clothes of my own, well-worn and
washed, and of a type that he was in the habit of wearing; and such
Frenchness as I had been able to supply from my own store: a novel
and a Testament. The case also, of course, contained the
all-important bottle.</p>

<p class="letter">Kenrick had an extraordinarily hard head. I refer
to the matter of drink, of course, not to the results of
sand-bagging. I had plied him with whisky at dinner, and had
offered him a stirrup-cup of such dimensions that any other man
would have blenched at the prospect. He did indeed look at the
half-tumbler of neat whisky a little doubtfully, but, as I have
said, he was always anxious to please me and he drank it down
without protest. He remained sober; or to all appearances sober.
But both his blood and his stomach would be whisky-sodden when he
died.</p>

<p class="letter">So was his compartment when I had finished with
it. As the lights of Crewe began to go by I put the final touch. I
laid the half-full bottle on the floor and rolled it to and fro
over the carpet. As the train slowed down I unlocked the door, shut
it behind me, walked away down the train until I had several
coaches between me and B Seven, stood looking in a casual,
interested way at the traffic on the platform, stepped, still
casual, down on to that platform and strolled along it. In hat and
coat I did not look like a passenger and no one took any notice of
me.</p>

<p class="letter">I came back to London on the midnight train,
arriving at Euston at half-past three, and was so exhilarated that
I walked all the way home. I walked as if on air. I let myself in,
and was sleeping peacefully when Mahmoud came to call me at
seven-thirty and to remind me that I had an appointment to
entertain Pathé representatives at half-past nine.</p>

<p class="letter">It was not until you called to see me that I knew
about the scribbled words on the newspaper that had been in his
coat pocket. I admit that I was for a moment dismayed that I should
have overlooked anything at all, but I was instantly comforted by
the venial nature of the slip. It did not in any way detract from
nor endanger my unique achievement. I had let him keep his
deplorable rag, as a piece of set-dressing. That it proved to have
Kenrick's handwriting on it would not be of interest to authorities
who had accepted the young man as Charles Martin.</p>

<p class="letter">The following evening, at the rush hour, I drove
myself to Victoria and retrieved Kenrick's two cases from the
cloak-room. I took them home, removed from them all maker's marks
and easily identifiable articles, sewed them both up in canvas, and
sent them with their contents to a refugee organisation in the Near
East. If you ever want to get rid of anything, my dear Mr Grant, do
not burn it. Post it to a remote island in the South Seas.</p>

<p class="letter">Having seen to it that the admirably reticent
tongue of the Kenrick youth would stay reticent, I looked forward
to enjoying the fruits of my labours. Indeed, yesterday I had
assurance of sufficient backing for my new expedition, and had
planned to fly out next week. The letter from Kinsey-Hewitt this
morning alters all that, of course. The fruits of my achievement
have been taken from me. But no one can take from me the
achievement itself. If I cannot be known as the discoverer of
Wabar, I shall be known as the author of the only perfect murder
ever perpetrated.</p>

<p class="letter">I cannot stay to be a candle-holder at
Kinsey-Hewitt's triumph. And I am too old to have more triumphs of
my own. But I <i>can</i> light a blaze that will make the candles
on the Kinsey-Hewitt altar look small and pale and uninteresting.
My funeral pyre will be a beacon to light all Europe, and my
achievement in murder a tidal-wave that will sweep Kinsey-Hewitt
and Wabar into the waste-paper baskets of the world's Press.</p>

<p class="letter">This evening, at dusk, I light my own pyre, on
the highest slope of the highest mountain in Europe. Mahmoud does
not know this. He thinks we are flying out to Athens. But he has
been with me for many years and would be very unhappy without me.
So I am taking him with me.</p>

<p class="letter">Good-bye, my dear Mr Grant. It grieves me that
someone of your intelligence should be wasting his talents in that
rather stupid establishment on the Embankment. It was clever of you
to discover that Charles Martin was not Charles Martin but someone
called Kenrick, and I salute you. What you are not clever enough to
discover is that he did not die by accident. What no one would ever
be clever enough to discover is that I am the man who killed
him.</p>

<p class="letter">Please take this letter as a mark of my esteem
and pour prendre congé. Mrs Lucas will post this on Friday
morning.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">H. C. Heron Lloyd</span>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Grant became aware that Mrs Tinker was showing Tad Cullen into
the room, and that she must already have been in without his
noticing because the envelope from the Yard was lying beside him on
the desk.</p>

<p>'Well?' said Tad, his face still thunderous. 'Where do we go
from here?'</p>

<p>Grant pushed over the pages of Lloyd's letter for him to
read.</p>

<p>'What's all this?'</p>

<p>'Read it.'</p>

<p>Tad took the thing up doubtfully, looked for a signature, and
then fell on the manuscript. Grant put his thumb in the envelope
from Cartwright and broke it open.</p>

<p>When Tad had finished he looked up with a shocked face and
stared at Grant. When at last he spoke what he said was: 'I feel
dirty all over.'</p>

<p>'Yes. It is an evil thing.'</p>

<p>'Vanity.'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'That's the crash that was in the evening papers last night. The
crate in flames on Mont Blanc.'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'So he would have got away with it after all.'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'No? He had thought of everything, hadn't he?'</p>

<p>'They never think of everything.'</p>

<p>'They?'</p>

<p>'Murderers. Lloyd forgot so obvious a thing as
finger-prints.'</p>

<p>'You mean he didn't do that job in gloves? I don't believe
it!'</p>

<p>'Of course he did it in gloves. Nothing he touched in that
compartment would have any print of his. What he forgot was that
there was something in that compartment that he had handled
before.'</p>

<p>'What was that?'</p>

<p>'Charles Martin's papers.' Grant flipped them with his
finger-tip where they lay on the desk. 'They are covered with
Lloyd's prints. They never think of everything.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">YOU look like a bridegroom,' Sergeant Williams
said in great satisfaction, pump-handling Grant on Monday
morning.</p>

<p>'Well, I'd better go and have rice thrown at me, I suppose. How
is the old man's rheumatism this morning?'</p>

<p>'Oh, fairly good, I think.'</p>

<p>'What is he smoking? A pipe? Or cigarettes?'</p>

<p>'Oh, a pipe.'</p>

<p>'Then I'd better go in while the barometer is still high.'</p>

<p>In the passage he encountered Ted Hanna.</p>

<p>'How did you run into Archie Brown?' Hanna asked, when he had
greeted him.</p>

<p>'He's writing a Gaelic epic in the hotel at the place where I
was staying. And his "ravens", by the way, are foreign
fishing-boats.'</p>

<p>'Yes?' said Hanna, stiffening into interest. 'How do you
know?'</p>

<p>'They got together at a party. It was the old
"have-a-cigarette-no-no-keep-the-packet" routine.'</p>

<p>'Sure it <i>wasn't</i> cigarettes?'</p>

<p>'Quite sure. I picked his pocket in the course of one Grand
Chain and unpicked it next time round.'</p>

<p>'Don't tell me you've been <i>country dancing</i>!'</p>

<p>'You'd be surprised at the things that I've been doing. I'm a
little surprised myself.'</p>

<p>'What was the "bread" like?'</p>

<p>'A packetful of the most beautiful "large coarse" notes you ever
saw.'</p>

<p>'Yes?' Hanna said, thoughtfully; and then amusement grew in his
face and spread to a grin. 'Someone's wasting an awful lot of the
needful.'</p>

<p>'Yes. A sheep in wolf's clothing. And you should see the
clothing!' Grant said and moved on towards his Chief's door.</p>

<p>'Your holiday seems to have done you good,' Hanna said. 'I've
never seen you so on top of the world. You're positively
purring.'</p>

<p>'As they say in the far North, I wouldn't call the King my
cousin,' Grant said, and meant it.</p>

<p>He was happy not because of the report that he was going to give
Bryce, not even because he was his own man again; he was happy
because of something young Cullen had said to him at the airport
that morning.</p>

<p>'Mr Grant,' Tad had said, standing very straight and solemn and
making a formal little speech of leave-taking like a
well-brought-up American, 'I want you to know that I'll never
forget what you've done for me and Bill. You couldn't bring Bill
back to me, but you've done something much more wonderful: you've
made him immortal.'</p>

<p>And indeed that was just what he had done. As long as books were
written and history read, Bill Kenrick would live; and it was he,
Alan Grant, who had done that. They had buried Bill Kenrick six
feet deep in oblivion, but he, Alan Grant, had dug him up again and
set him in his rightful place as the discoverer of Wabar.</p>

<p>He had paid back the debt he owed that dead boy in B Seven.</p>

<p>Bryce greeted him amiably, and said that he was looking well
(which didn't count, because he had said that at their last
interview) and suggested that he might go down to Hampshire in
answer to an appeal from the Hampshire police which had just come
in.</p>

<p>'Well, if it's all the same to you, sir, I'd like to get the
Kenrick murder off my chest first.'</p>

<p>'The what?'</p>

<p>'This is my written report on it,' Grant said, laying in front
of Bryce the neat bundle of quarto pages that was the product of
his pleasant Sunday at home.</p>

<p>As he laid the thing down he remembered in a vague, surprised
way that what he had planned to lay in front of Bryce was his
resignation.</p>

<p>What odd notions occurred to one on holiday.</p>

<p>He was going to resign, and be a sheep farmer or something, and
get married.</p>

<p>What an extraordinary idea. What a most extraordinary idea.</p>
